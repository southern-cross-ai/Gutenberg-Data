    A Novel Case</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Talking of sudden disappearances the one you mention  of Hannah in that Leavenworth case of ours, is not the only remarkable one  which has come under my direct notice. Indeed, I know of another that in some  respects, at least, surpasses that in points of interest, and if you will  promise not to inquire into the real names of the parties concerned, as the  affair is a <i>secret</i>, I will relate you my experience regarding it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The speaker was Q, the rising young detective,  universally acknowledged by us of the force as the most astute man for  mysterious and unprecedented cases, then in the bureau, always and of course  excepting Mr. Gryce; and such a statement from him could not but arouse our  deepest curiosity. Drawing up, then, to the stove around which we were sitting  in lazy enjoyment of one of those off-hours so dear to a detective&rsquo;s heart, we  gave with alacrity the required promise; and settling himself back with the  satisfied air of a man who has a good story to tell that does not entirely lack  certain points redounding to his own credit, he began:</p>
  <p>I was one Sunday morning loitering at the &mdash;Precinct  Station, when the door opened and a respectable-looking middle-aged woman came  in, whose agitated air at once attracted my attention. Going up to her, I asked  her what she wanted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A detective,&rdquo; she replied, glancing cautiously about  on the faces of the various men scattered through the room. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish  anything said about it, but a girl disappeared from our house last night, and&rdquo;&mdash;she  stopped here, her emotion seeming to choke her&mdash;&ldquo;and I want some one to look her  up,&rdquo; she went on at last with the most intense emphasis.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A girl? what kind of a girl; and what house do you  mean when you say our house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She looked at me keenly before replying. &ldquo;You are a  young man,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t there some one here more responsible than yourself  that I can talk to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I shrugged my shoulders and beckoned to Mr. Gryce who  was just then passing. She at once seemed to put confidence in him. Drawing him  aside, she whispered a few low eager words which I could not hear. He listened  nonchalantly for a moment but suddenly made a move which I knew indicated  strong and surprised interest, though from his face&mdash;but you know what Gryce&rsquo;s  face is. I was about to walk off, convinced he had got hold of something he would  prefer to manage himself, when the Superintendent came in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is Gryce?&rdquo; asked he; &ldquo;tell him I want him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Gryce heard him and hastened forward. As he passed  me, he whispered, &ldquo;Take a man and go with this woman; look into matters and  send me word if you want me; I will be here for two hours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I did not need a second permission. Beckoning to  Harris, I reapproached the woman. &ldquo;Where do you come from,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am to go  back with you and investigate the affair it seems.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did <i>he </i>say so?&rdquo; she asked, pointing to Mr. Gryce who  now stood with his back to us busily talking with the Superintendent.</p>
  <p>I nodded, and she at once moved towards the door. &ldquo;I  come from No.&mdash;Second Avenue: Mr. Blake&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; she whispered, uttering a  name so well known, I at once understood Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s movement of sudden  interest &ldquo;A girl&mdash;one who sewed for us&mdash;disappeared last night in a way to alarm  us very much. She was taken from her room&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she cried vehemently, seeing  my look of sarcastic incredulity, &ldquo;<i>taken</i> from her room; she <i>never</i> went of her  own accord; and she must be found if I spend every dollar of the pittance I  have laid up in the bank against my old age.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her manner was so intense, her tone so marked and her  words so vehement, I at once and naturally asked if the girl was a relative of  hers that she felt her abduction so keenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;not a relative, but,&rdquo; she went on,  looking every way but in my face, &ldquo;a very dear friend&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;protegee, I think  they call it, of mine; I&mdash;I&mdash;She<i> must </i>be found,&rdquo; she again reiterated.</p>
  <p>We were by this time in the street.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing must be said about it,&rdquo; she now whispered,  catching me by the arm. &ldquo;I told <i>him</i> so,&rdquo; nodding back to the building from  which we had just issued, &ldquo;and he promised secrecy. It can be done without  folks knowing anything about it, can&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Finding the girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we can tell you better about that  when we know a few more of the facts. What is the girl&rsquo;s name and what makes  you think she didn&rsquo;t go out of the house-door of her own accord?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, why, everything. She wasn&rsquo;t the person to do it;  then the looks of her room, and&mdash;They all got out of the window,&rdquo; she cried  suddenly, &ldquo;and went away by the side gate into&mdash;Street.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They? Who do you mean by they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, whoever they were who carried her off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I could not suppress the &ldquo;bah!&rdquo; that rose to my lips.  Mr. Gryce might have been able to, but I am not Gryce.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that she was carried  off?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;not in the sense you mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She gave another nod back to the police station now a  block or so distant. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t seem to doubt it at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I laughed. &ldquo;Did you tell him you thought she had been  taken off in this way?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, and he said, &lsquo;Very likely.&rsquo; And well he might,  for I heard the men talking in her room, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You heard men talking in her room&mdash;when?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O, it must have been as late as half-past twelve. I  had been asleep and the noise they made whispering, woke me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;tell me where her room is, hers and  yours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hers is the third story back, mine the front one on  the same floor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; I now inquired. &ldquo;What position do you  occupy in Mr. Blake&rsquo;s house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am the housekeeper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Blake was a bachelor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you were wakened last night by hearing whispering  which seemed to come from this girl&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I at first thought it was the folks next  door,&mdash;we often hear them when they are unusually noisy,&mdash;but soon I became  assured it came from her room; and more astonished than I could say,&mdash;She is a  good girl,&rdquo; she broke in, suddenly looking at me with hotly indignant eyes, &ldquo;a&mdash;a&mdash;as  good a girl as this whole city can show; don&rsquo;t you dare, any of you, to hint at  anything else or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; I said soothingly, a little ashamed of  my too communicative face, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t said anything, we will take it for  granted she is as good as gold, go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The woman wiped her forehead with a hand that trembled  like a leaf. &ldquo;Where was I?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;O, I heard voices and was surprised and  got up and went to her door. The noise I made unlocking my own must have  startled her, for all was perfectly quiet when I got there. I waited a moment,  then I turned the knob and called her: she did not reply and I called again.  Then she came to the door, but did not unlock it. &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; she asked. &lsquo;O,&rsquo;  said I, &lsquo;I thought I heard talking here and I was frightened,&rsquo; &lsquo;It must have  been next door,&rsquo; said she. I begged pardon and went back to my room. There was  no more noise, but when in the morning we broke into her room and found her  gone, the window open and signs of distress and struggle around, I knew I had  not been mistaken; that there were men with her when I went to her door, and  that they had carried her off&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This time I could not restrain myself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did they drop her out of the window?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;we are building an extension, and  there is a ladder running up to the third floor, and it was by means of that  they took her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed! she seems at least to have been a willing  victim,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>
  <p>The woman clutched my arm with a grip like iron. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you believe it,&rdquo; gasped she, stopping me in the street where we were. &ldquo;I tell  you if what I say is true, and these burglars or whatever they were, did carry  her off, it was an agony to her, an awful, awful thing that will kill her if it  has not done so already. You don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about, you never  saw her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was she pretty,&rdquo; I asked, hurrying the woman along,  for more than one passer-by had turned their heads to look at us. The question  seemed in some way to give her a shock.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she muttered; &ldquo;some might not  think so, I always did; it depended upon the way you looked at her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For the first time I felt a thrill of anticipation  shoot through my veins. Why, I could not say. Her tone was peculiar, and she  spoke in a sort of brooding way as though she were weighing something in her  own mind; but then her manner had been peculiar throughout. Whatever it was  that aroused my suspicion, I determined henceforth to keep a very sharp eye  upon her ladyship. Levelling a straight glance at her face, I asked her how it  was that she came to be the one to inform the authorities of the girl&rsquo;s  disappearance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t Mr. Blake know anything about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The faintest shadow of a change came into her manner. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said she, &ldquo;I told him at breakfast time; but Mr. Blake doesn&rsquo;t take much  interest in his servants; he leaves all such matters to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then he does not know you have come for the police?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, sir, and O, if you would be so good as to keep it  from him. It is not necessary he should know. I shall let you in the back way.  Mr. Blake is a man who never meddles with anything, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did Mr. Blake say this morning when you told him  that this girl&mdash;By the way, what is her name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Emily.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That this girl, Emily, had disappeared during the night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not much of anything, sir. He was sitting at the  breakfast table reading his paper, he merely looked up, frowned a little in an  absent-minded way, and told me I must manage the servants&rsquo; affairs without  troubling him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you let it drop?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes sir; Mr. Blake is not a man to speak twice to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I could easily believe that from what I had seen of  him in public, for though by no means a harsh looking man, he had a reserved  air which if maintained in private must have made him very difficult of approach.</p>
  <p>We were now within a half block or so of the  old-fashioned mansion regarded by this scion of New York&rsquo;s aristocracy as one  of the most desirable residences in the city; so motioning to the man who had  accompanied me to take his stand in a doorway near by and watch for the signal  I would give him in case I wanted Mr. Gryce, I turned to the woman, who was now  all in a flutter, and asked her how she proposed to get me into the house  without the knowledge of Mr. Blake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O sir, all you have got to do is to follow me right  up the back stairs; he won&rsquo;t notice, or if he does will not ask any questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And having by this time reached the basement door, she  took out a key from her pocket and inserting it in the lock, at once admitted  us into the dwelling.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter02"></a><b>Chapter II<br>
    A Few Points</b></h2>
  <p>Mrs. Daniels, for that was her name, took me at once  up stairs to the third story back room. As we passed through the halls, I could  not but notice how rich, though sombre were the old fashioned walls and heavily  frescoed ceilings, so different in style and coloring from what we see  now-a-days in our secret penetrations into Fifth Avenue mansions. Many as are  the wealthy houses I have been called upon to enter in the line of my  profession, I had never crossed the threshold of such an one as this before,  and impervious as I am to any foolish sentimentalities, I felt a certain degree  of awe at the thought of invading with police investigation, this home of  ancient Knicker-bocker respectability. But once in the room of the missing  girl, every consideration fled save that of professional pride and curiosity.  For almost at first blush, I saw that whether Mrs. Daniels was correct or not  in her surmises as to the manner of the girl&rsquo;s disappearance, the fact that she  had disappeared was likely to prove an affair of some importance. For, let me  state the facts in the order in which I noticed them. The first thing that  impressed me was, that whatever Mrs. Daniels called her, this was no sewing  girl&rsquo;s room into which I now stepped. Plain as was the furniture in comparison  with the elaborate richness of the walls and ceiling, there were still  scattered through the room, which was large even for a thirty foot house,  articles of sufficient elegance to make the supposition that it was the abode  of an ordinary seamstress open to suspicion, if no more.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Daniels, seeing my look of surprise, hastened to  provide some explanation. &ldquo;It is the room which has always been devoted to  sewing,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;and when Emily came, I thought it would be easier to put up  a bed here than to send her upstairs. She was a very nice girl and disarranged  nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I glanced around on the writing-case lying open on a  small table in the centre of the room, on the vase half full of partly withered  roses, on the mantel-piece, the Shakespeare, and Macaulay&rsquo;s History lying on  the stand at my right, thought my own thoughts, but said nothing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You found the door locked this morning?&rdquo; asked I,  after a moment&rsquo;s scrutiny of the room in which three facts had become manifest:  first, that the girl had not occupied the bed the night before; second, that  there had been some sort of struggle or surprise,&mdash;one of the curtains being  violently torn as if grasped by an agitated hand, to say nothing of a chair  lying upset on the floor with one of its legs broken; third, that the  departure, strange as it may seem, had been by the window.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned she; &ldquo;but there is a passageway  leading from my room to hers and it was by that means we entered. There was a  chair placed against the door on this side but we easily pushed it away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I stepped to the window and looked out. Ah, it would  not be so very difficult for a man to gain the street from that spot in a dark  night, for the roof of the newly-erected extension was almost on a level with  the window.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she anxiously, &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t she have been  got out that way?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More difficult things have been done,&rdquo; said I; and  was about to step out upon the roof when I bethought to inquire of Mrs. Daniels  if any of the girl&rsquo;s clothing was missing.</p>
  <p>She immediately flew to the closets and thence to  bureau drawers which she turned hastily over. &ldquo;No, nothing is missing but a hat  and cloak and&mdash;&rdquo; She paused confusedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; returned she, hurriedly closing the bureau  drawer; &ldquo;only some little knick-knacks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Knick-knacks!&rdquo; quoth I. &ldquo;If she stopped for  knick-knacks, she couldn&rsquo;t have gone in any very unwilling frame of mind.&rdquo; And  somewhat disgusted, I was about to throw up the whole affair and leave the  room. But the indecision in Mrs. Daniels&rsquo; own face deterred me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; murmured she, drawing her  hand across her eyes. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it. But,&rdquo; she went on with even an  increase in her old tone of heart-felt conviction, &ldquo;no matter whether we  understand it or not, the case is serious; I tell you so, and she <i>must</i> be  found.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I resolved to know the nature of that <i>must</i>, used as  few women in her position would use it even under circumstances to all  appearance more aggravated than these.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, must?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;If the girl went of her own  accord as some things seem to show, why should you, no relative as you  acknowledge, take the matter so to heart as to insist she shall be followed and  brought back?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She turned away, uneasily taking up and putting down  some little matters on the table before her. &ldquo;Is it not enough that I promise  to pay for all expenses which a search will occasion, without my being forced  to declare just why I should be willing to do so? Am I bound to tell you I love  the girl? that I believe she has been taken away by foul means, and that to her  great suffering and distress? that being fond of her and believing this, I am  conscientious enough to put every means I possess at the command of those who  will recover her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I was not satisfied with this but on that very account  felt my enthusiasm revive.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Mr. Blake? Surely he is the one to take this  interest if anybody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have before said,&rdquo; returned she, paling however as  she spoke, &ldquo;that Mr. Blake takes very little interest in his servants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I cast another glance about the room. &ldquo;How long have  you been in this house?&rdquo; asked I.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was in the service of Mr. Blake&rsquo;s father and he  died a year ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Since when you have remained with Mr. Blake himself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And this Emily, when did she come here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh it must be eleven months or so ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An Irish girl?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O no, American. She is not a common person, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that? That she was educated,  lady-like, pretty, or what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to say. She was educated, yes, but  not as you would call a lady educated. Yet she knew a great many things the  rest of us didn&rsquo;t. She liked to read, you see, and&mdash;O sir, ask the girls about  her, I never know what to say when I am questioned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I scanned the gray-haired woman still more intently  than I had yet done. Was she the weak common-place creature she seemed, or had  she really some cause other than appeared for these her numerous breaks and  hesitations.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where did you get this girl?&rdquo; I inquired. &ldquo;Where did  she live before coming here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I cannot say, I never asked her to talk about  herself. She came to me for work and I liked her and took her without  recommendation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And she has served you well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Excellently.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Been out much? Had any visitors?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She shook her head. &ldquo;Never went out and never had any  visitors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I own I was nonplussed, &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;no more of  this at present. I must first find out if she left this house alone or in  company with others.&rdquo; And without further parley I stepped out upon the roof of  the extension.</p>
  <p>As I did so I debated with myself whether the case warranted  me or not in sending for Mr. Gryce. As yet there was nothing to show that the  girl had come to any harm. A mere elopement with or without a lover to help  her, was not such a serious matter that the whole police force need be stirred  up on the subject; and if the woman had money, as she said, ready to give the  man who should discover the whereabouts of this girl, why need that money be  divided up any more than was necessary. Yet Gryce was not one to be dallied  with. He had said, send for him if the affair seemed to call for his judgment,  and somehow the affair did promise to be a trifle complicated. I was yet  undetermined when I reached the edge of the roof.</p>
  <p>It was a dizzy descent, but once made, escape from the  yard beneath would be easy. A man could take that road without difficulty; but  a woman! Baffled at the idea I turned thoughtfully back, when I beheld  something on the roof before me that caused me to pause and ask myself if this  was going to turn out to be a tragedy after all. It was a drop of congealed  blood. Further on towards the window was another, and yes, further still,  another and another. I even found one upon the very window ledge itself.  Bounding into the room, I searched the carpet for further traces. It was the  worst one in the world to find anything upon of the nature of which I was  seeking, being a confused pattern of mingled drab and red, and in my difficulty  I had to stoop very low.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are you looking for?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Daniels.</p>
  <p>I pointed to the drop on the window sill. &ldquo;Do you see  that?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>She uttered an exclamation and bent nearer. &ldquo;Blood!&rdquo;  cried she, and stood staring, with rapidly paling cheeks and trembling form. &ldquo;They  have killed her and he will never&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As she did not finish I looked up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you think it was <i>her</i> blood?&rdquo; she whispered in a  horrified tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is every reason to believe so,&rdquo; rejoined I,  pointing to a spot where I had at last discovered not only one crimson drop but  many, scattered over the scarcely redder roses under my feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, it is worse than I thought,&rdquo; murmured she. &ldquo;What  are you going to do? What can we do?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am going to send for another detective,&rdquo; returned  I; and stepping to the window I telegraphed at once to the man Harris to go for  Mr. Gryce.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The one we saw at the Station?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I bowed assent.</p>
  <p>Her face lost something of its drawn expression. &ldquo;O I  am glad; <i>he</i> will do something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Subduing my indignation at this back thrust, I  employed my time in taking note of such details as had escaped my previous  attention. They were not many. The open writing-desk&mdash;in which, however I found  no letters or written documents of any kind, only a few sheets of paper, with  pen, ink, etc.; the brush and hairpins scattered on the bureau as though the  girl had been interrupted while arranging her hair (if she had been  interrupted); and the absence of any great pile of work such as one would  expect to see in a room set apart for sewing, were all I could discover. Not  much to help us, in case this was to prove an affair of importance as I began  to suspect.</p>
  <p>With Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s arrival, however, things soon assumed  a better shape. He came to the basement door, was ushered in by your humble  servant, had the whole matter as far as I had investigated it, at his  finger-ends in a moment, and was up-stairs and in that room before I, who am  called the quickest man in the force as you all know, could have time to  determine just what difference his presence would make to me in a pecuniary way  in event of Mrs. Daniels&rsquo; promises amounting to anything. He did not remain  there long, but when he came down I saw that his interest was in no wise  lessened.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What kind of a looking girl was this?&rdquo; he asked,  hurrying up to Mrs. Daniels who had withdrawn into a recess in the lower hall  while all this was going on. &ldquo;Describe her to me, hair, eyes, complexion, etc.;  you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t know as I can,&rdquo; she stammered reluctantly,  turning very red in the face. &ldquo;I am a poor one for noticing. I will call one of  the girls, I&mdash;&rdquo; She was gone before we realized she had not finished her  sentence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; broke from Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s lips as he  thoughtfully took down a vase that stood on a bracket near by and looked into  it.</p>
  <p>I did not venture a word.</p>
  <p>When Mrs. Daniels came back she had with her a  trim-looking girl of prepossessing appearance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is Fanny,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;she knows Emily well,  being in the habit of waiting on her at table; she will tell you what you want  to hear. I have explained to her,&rdquo; she went on, nodding towards Mr. Gryce with  a composure such as she had not before displayed; &ldquo;that you are looking for  your niece who ran away from home some time ago to go into some sort of  service.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; quoth that gentleman, bowing with  mock admiration to the gas-fixture. Then carelessly shifting his glance to the  cleaning-cloth which Fanny held rather conspicuously in her hand, he repeated  the question he had already put to Mrs. Daniels.</p>
  <p>The girl, tossing her head just a trifle, at once  replied:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O she was good-looking enough, if that is what you  mean, for them as likes a girl with cheeks as white as this cloth was afore I  rubbed the spoons with it. As for her eyes, they was blacker than her hair,  which was the blackest I ever see. She had no flesh at all, and as for her  figure&mdash;&rdquo; Fanny glanced down on her own well developed person, and gave a shrug  inexpressibly suggestive.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is this description true?&rdquo; Mr. Gryce asked, seemingly  of Mrs. Daniels, though his gaze rested with curious intentness on the girl&rsquo;s  head which was covered with a little cap.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sufficiently so,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Daniels in a very low  tone, however. Then with a sudden display of energy, &ldquo;Emily&rsquo;s figure is not  what you would call plump. I have seen her&mdash;&rdquo; She broke off as if a little  startled at herself and motioned Fanny to go.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Gryce in his soft way.  &ldquo;You said the girl&rsquo;s hair and eyes were dark; were they darker than yours?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O, yes sir;&rdquo; replied the girl simpering, as she  settled the ribbons on her cap.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me see your hair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She took off her cap with a smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha, very pretty, very pretty. And the other girls?  You have other girls I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two, sir;&rdquo; returned Mrs. Daniels.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How about their complexions? Are they lighter too  than Emily&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; about like Fanny&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Gryce spread his hand over his breast in a way  that assured me of his satisfaction, and allowed the girl to go.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We will now proceed to the yard,&rdquo; said he. But at  that moment the door of the front room opened and a gentleman stepped leisurely  into the hall, whom at first glance I recognized as the master of the house. He  was dressed for the street and had his hat in his hand. At the sight we all  stood silent, Mrs. Daniels flushing up to the roots of her gray hair.</p>
  <p>Mr. Blake is an elegant-looking man as you perhaps  know; proud, reserved, and a trifle sombre. As he turned to come towards us,  the light shining through the windows at our right, fell full upon his face,  revealing such a self-absorbed and melancholy expression, I involuntarily drew  back as if I had unwittingly intruded upon a great man&rsquo;s privacy. Mr. Gryce on  the contrary stepped forward.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Blake, I believe,&rdquo; said he, bowing in that  deferential way he knows so well how to assume.</p>
  <p>The gentleman, startled as it evidently seemed from a  reverie, looked hastily up. Meeting Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s bland smile, he returned the  bow, but haughtily, and as it appeared in an abstracted way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Allow me to introduce myself,&rdquo; proceeded my superior.  &ldquo;I am Mr. Gryce from the detective bureau. We were notified this morning that a  girl in your employ had disappeared from your house last night in a somewhat  strange and unusual way, and I just stepped over with my man here, to see if  the matter is of sufficient importance to inquire into. With many apologies for  the intrusion, I stand obedient to your orders.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With a frown expressive of annoyance, Mr. Blake glanced  around and detecting Mrs. Daniels, said: &ldquo;Did you consider the affair so  serious as that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She nodded, seeming to find it difficult to speak.</p>
  <p>He remained looking at her with an expression of some  doubt. &ldquo;I can hardly think,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;such extreme measures were necessary;  the girl will doubtless come back, or if not&mdash;&rdquo; His shoulders gave a slight  shrug and he took out his gloves.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The difficulty seems to be,&rdquo; quoth Mr. Gryce eyeing  those gloves with his most intent and concentrated look, &ldquo;that the girl did not  go alone, but was helped away, or forced away, by parties who had previously  broken into your house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is a strange circumstance,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Blake,  but still without any appearance of interest, &ldquo;and if you are sure of what you  say, demands, perhaps, some inquiry. I would not wish to put anything in the  way of justice succoring the injured. But&mdash;&rdquo; again he gave that slight shrug of  the shoulders, indicative of doubt, if not indifference.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Daniels trembled, and took a step forward. I thought  she was going to speak, but instead of that she drew back again in her strange  hesitating way.</p>
  <p>Mr. Gryce did not seem to notice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if you will step upstairs  with me to the room occupied by this girl, I may be able to show you certain  evidences which will convince you that our errand here is not one of  presumption.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am ready to concede that without troubling myself  with proof,&rdquo; observed the master of the house with the faintest show of  asperity. &ldquo;Yet if there is anything to see of a startling nature, perhaps I had  best yield to your wishes. Whereabouts in the house is this girl&rsquo;s room, Mrs.  Daniels?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is&mdash;I gave her the third story back, Mr. Blake;&rdquo;  replied that woman, nervously eyeing his face. &ldquo;It was large and light for sewing,  and she was so nice&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He impatiently waved his hand on which he had by this  time fitted his glove to a nicety, as if these details were an unnecessary bore  to him, and motioned her to show the way. Instantly a new feeling appeared to  seize her, that of alarm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hardly think you need trouble Mr. Blake to go  up-stairs,&rdquo; she murmured, turning towards Mr. Gryce. &ldquo;I am sure when you tell  him the curtains were torn, and the chair upset, the window open and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Mr. Gryce was already on the stairs with Mr. Blake,  whom this small opposition seemed to have at once determined.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O my God!&rdquo; she murmured to herself, &ldquo;who could have  foreseen this.&rdquo; And ignoring my presence with all the egotism of extreme  agitation, she hurried past me to the room above, where I speedily joined her.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter03"></a><b>Chapter III<br>
    The Contents Of A Bureau Drawer</b></h2>
  <p>Mr. Blake was standing in the centre of the room when  I entered, carelessly following with his eyes the motion of Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s finger  as that gentleman pointed with unwearying assiduity to the various little  details that had struck us. His hat was still in his hand, and he presented a  very formidable and imposing appearance, or so Mrs. Daniels appeared to think  as she stood watching him from the corner, whither she had withdrawn herself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A forcible departure you see,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Gryce; &ldquo;she  had not even time to gather up her clothes;&rdquo; and with a sudden movement he  stooped and pulled out one of the bureau drawers before the eyes of his  nonchalant listener.</p>
  <p>Immediately a smothered exclamation struck our ears,  and Mrs. Daniels started forward.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I pray, gentlemen,&rdquo; she entreated, advancing in such  a way as to place herself against the front of the bureau in a manner to  preclude the opening of any more drawers, &ldquo;that you will remember that a modest  woman such as this girl was, would hardly like to have her clothing displayed  before the eyes of strangers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Gryce instantly closed the drawer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;pardon the rough ways of a  somewhat hardened officer of the law.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She drew up closer to the bureau, still protecting it  with her meagre but energetic form while her eyes rested with almost a savage  expression upon the master of the house as if he, and not the detective, had  been the aggressor whose advances she feared.</p>
  <p>Mr. Blake did not return the look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If that is all you can show me, I think I will  proceed to my appointment,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The matter does seem to be more serious  than I thought, and if you judge it necessary to take any active measures, why,  let no consideration of my great and inherent dislike to notoriety of any kind,  interfere with what you consider your duty. As for the house, it is at your  command, under Mrs. Daniels&rsquo; direction. Good morning.&rdquo; And returning our bows  with one singularly impressive for all its elegant carelessness, he at once  withdrew.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Daniels took one long deep breath and came from  the bureau. Instantly Mr. Gryce stooped and pulled out the drawer she had so  visibly protected. A white towel met our eyes, spread neatly out at its full  length. Lifting it, we looked beneath. A carefully folded dress of dark blue  silk, to all appearance elegantly made, confronted our rather eager eyes.  Beside it, a collar of exquisite lace&mdash;I know enough of such matters to be a  judge&mdash;pricked through by a gold breast-pin of a strange and unique pattern. A  withered bunch of what appeared to have been a bouquet of red roses, surmounted  the whole, giving to the otherwise commonplace collection the appearance of a  relic from the tomb.</p>
  <p>We both drew back in some amazement, involuntarily  glancing up at Mrs. Daniels.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have no explanation to give,&rdquo; said that woman, with  a calmness strangely in contrast to the agitation she had displayed while Mr.  Blake had remained in the room. &ldquo;That those things rich as they are, really  belonged to the girl, I have no doubt. She brought them when she came, and they  only confirm what I have before intimated: that she was no ordinary sewing  girl, but a woman who had seen better days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With a low &ldquo;humph!&rdquo; and another glance at the dark  blue dress and delicate collar, Mr. Gryce carefully replaced the cloth he had  taken from them, and softly closed the drawer without either of us having laid  a finger upon a single article. Five minutes later he disappeared from the  room.</p>
  <p>I did not see him again till occasion took me below,  when I beheld him softly issue from Mr. Blake&rsquo;s private apartment. Meeting me,  he smiled, and I saw that whether he was conscious of betraying it or not, he  had come upon some clue or at the least fashioned for himself some theory with  which he was more or less satisfied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An elegant apartment, that,&rdquo; whispered he, nodding  sideways toward the room he had just left, &ldquo;pity you haven&rsquo;t time to examine  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you sure that I haven&rsquo;t?&rdquo; returned I, drawing a  step nearer to escape the eyes of Mrs. Daniels who had descended after me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite sure;&rdquo; and we hastened down together into the  yard.</p>
  <p>But my curiosity once aroused in this way would not  let me rest. Taking an opportunity when Mr. Gryce was engaged in banter with  the girls below, and in this way learning more in a minute of what he wanted to  know than some men would gather in an hour by that or any other method, I stole  lightly back and entered this room.</p>
  <p>I almost started in my surprise. Instead of the  luxurious apartment I had prepared myself to behold, a plain,  scantily-furnished room opened before me, of a nature between a library and a  studio. There was not even a carpet on the polished floor, only a rug, which  strange to say was not placed in the centre of the room or even before the fireplace,  but on one side, and directly in front of a picture that almost at first blush  had attracted my attention as being the only article in the room worth looking  at. It was the portrait of a woman, handsome, haughty and alluring; a modern  beauty, with eyes of fire burning beneath high piled locks of jetty blackness,  that were only relieved from being too intense by the scarlet hood of an opera  cloak, that was drawn over them. &ldquo;A sister,&rdquo; I thought to myself, &ldquo;it is too  modern for his mother,&rdquo; and I took a step nearer to see if I could trace any  likeness in the chiselled features of this disdainful brunette, to the more  characteristic ones of the careless gentleman who had stood but a few moments  before in my presence. As I did so, I was struck with the distance with which  the picture stood out from the wall, and thought to myself that the awkwardness  of the framing came near marring the beauty of this otherwise lovely work of  art. As for the likeness I was in search of, I found it or thought I did, in the  expression of the eyes which were of the same color as Mr. Blake&rsquo;s but more  full and passionate; and satisfied that I had exhausted all the picture could  tell me, I turned to make what other observations I could, when I was startled  by confronting the agitated countenance of Mrs. Daniels who had entered behind  me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is Mr. Blake&rsquo;s room,&rdquo; said she with dignity; &ldquo;no  one ever intrudes here but myself, not even the servants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I beg pardon,&rdquo; said I, glancing around in vain for  the something which had awakened that look of satisfaction in Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s eyes.  &ldquo;I was attracted by the beauty of this picture visible through the half open  door and stepped in to favor myself with a nearer view. It is very lovely. A  sister of Mr. Blake?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, his cousin;&rdquo; and she closed the door after us  with an emphasis that proclaimed she was anything but pleased.</p>
  <p>It was my last effort to obtain information on my own  account. In a few moments later Mr. Gryce appeared from below, and a  conversation ensued with Mrs. Daniels that absorbed my whole attention.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are very anxious, my man here tells me, that this  girl should be found?&rdquo; remarked Mr. Gryce; &ldquo;so much so that you are willing to  defray all the expenses of a search?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She bowed. &ldquo;As far as I am able sir; I have a few  hundreds in the bank, you are welcome to them. I would not keep a dollar back  if I had thousands, but I am poor, and can only promise you what I myself  possess; though&mdash;&rdquo; and her cheeks grew flushed and hot with an unnatural  agitation&mdash;&ldquo;I believe that thousands would not be lacking if they were found  necessary. I&mdash;I could almost swear you shall have anything in reason which you  require; only the girl must be found and soon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you thought,&rdquo; proceeded Mr. Gryce, utterly  ignoring the wildness of these statements, &ldquo;that the girl may come back herself  if let alone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She will come back if she can,&rdquo; quoth Mrs. Daniels.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did she seem so well satisfied with her home as to  warrant you in saying that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She liked her home, but she <i>loved</i> me,&rdquo; returned the  woman steadily. &ldquo;She loved me so well she would never have gone as she did  without being forced. Yes,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;though she made no outcry and stopped to  put on her bonnet and shawl. She was not a girl to make a fuss. If they had  killed her outright, she would never have uttered a cry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why do you say they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because I am confident I heard more than one man&rsquo;s  voice in her room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph! Would you know those voices if you heard them  again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a surprise in this last negative which Mr.  Gryce evidently noticed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ask,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;because I have been told that Mr.  Blake lately kept a body servant who has been seen to look at this girl more  than once, when she has passed him on the stairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Daniels&rsquo; face turned scarlet with rage and she  hastily rose from the chair. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;Henry was a man  who knew his place, and&mdash;I won&rsquo;t hear such things,&rdquo; she suddenly exclaimed; &ldquo;Emily  was&mdash;was a lady, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Gryce soothingly, &ldquo;though  the cat looks at the king, it is no sign the king looks at the cat. We have to  think of everything you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must never think of anything like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Gryce softly ran his thumb around the brim of the  hat he held in his hand. &ldquo;Mrs. Daniels,&rdquo; observed he, &ldquo;it would greatly  facilitate matters if you would kindly tell us why you take such an interest in  this girl. One glimpse at her real history would do more towards setting us on  the right track than anything else you could offer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her face assumed an unmistakable frown. &ldquo;Have I not  told you,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;what is known of it? That she came to me about two years  ago for work; that I liked her, and so hired her; that she has been with us  ever since and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you will not tell us?&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Gryce.</p>
  <p>Her face fell and a look of hesitation crossed it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I doubt if we can do anything unless you do,&rdquo;  continued he.</p>
  <p>Her countenance settled again into a resolved  expression.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;if the girl had a  secret&mdash;as nearly all girls have, brought low as she has evidently been&mdash;it had  nothing to do with her disappearance, nor would a knowledge of it help you in  any way. I am confident of this and so shall hold my peace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was not a woman to be frightened or cajoled into  making revelations she did not think necessary, and seeing it, Mr. Gryce  refrained from urging her further.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;However, you will at least tell me this,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what  were the knick-knacks she took away with her from her bureau drawer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;for they have nothing to do with her  abduction. They were articles of positive value to her, though I assure you of  little importance to any one else. All that is shown by their disappearance is  the fact that she had a moment&rsquo;s time allowed her in which to collect what she  most wanted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Gryce arose. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you have given us a  hard sum to work out, but I am not the man to recoil from anything hard. If I  can discover the whereabouts of this girl I will certainly do it, but you must  help me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I, how?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By inserting a personal in the Herald. You say she  loves you; and would come back if she could. Now whether you believe it or not  this is open to doubt; therefore I would advise that you take some such means  as that to inform her of the anxiety of her friends and their desire to  communicate with her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; she cried vehemently. &ldquo;I should be  afraid&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I might put it that Mrs. D&mdash;, anxious about Emily,  desires information of her whereabouts&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Put it any way you like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You had better add,&rdquo; said I, speaking for the first  time, &ldquo;that you would be willing to pay for information.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Gryce, &ldquo;add that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Daniels frowned, but made no objection, and after  getting as minute a description as possible of the clothing worn by the girl  the night before, we left the house.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter04"></a><b>Chapter IV<br>
    Thompson&rsquo;s Story</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;An affair of some mystery,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Gryce, as we  halted at the corner to take a final look at the house and its environs. &ldquo;Why a  girl should choose such a method of descent as that,&rdquo;&mdash;and he pointed to the  ladder down which we believed her to have come&mdash;&ldquo;to leave a house of which she  had been an inmate for a year, baffles me, I can tell you. If it were not for  those marks of blood which betray her track, I would be disinclined to believe  any such hare-brained adventure was ever perpetrated by a woman. As it is, what  wouldn&rsquo;t I give for her photograph. Black hair, black eyes, white face and thin  figure! what a description whereby to find a girl in this great city of New  York. Ah!&rdquo; said he with sudden gratification, &ldquo;here is Mr. Blake again; his  appointment must have been a failure. Let us see if his description will be any  more definite.&rdquo; And hurrying towards the advancing figure of that gentleman, he  put some questions to him.</p>
  <p>Instantly Mr. Blake stopped, looked at him blankly for  a moment, then replied in a tone sufficiently loud for me to hear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry, sir, if my description could have done  you any good, but I have not the remotest idea how the girl looked. I did not  know till this morning even, that there was such a person in my house as a  sewing-woman. I leave all such domestic concerns entirely with Mrs. Daniels.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Gryce again bowed low and ventured another  question. The answer came as before, distinctly to my ears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O, I may have seen her, I can not say about that; I  very often run across the servants in the hall; but whether she is tall or  short, light or dark, pretty or ugly, I know no more than you do, sir.&rdquo; Then  with a dignified nod calculated to abash a man in Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s position,  inquired,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It did not seem to be, Mr. Gryce put another question.</p>
  <p>Mr. Blake give him a surprised stare before replying,  then courteously remarked,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not concern myself with servants after they have  left me. Henry was an excellent valet, but a trifle domineering, something  which I never allow in any one who approaches me. I dismissed him and that was  the end of it, I know nothing of what has become of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Gryce bowed and drew back, and Mr. Blake, with the  haughty step peculiar to him, passed by him and re&euml;ntered his house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I should not like to get into that man&rsquo;s clutches,&rdquo;  said I, as my superior rejoined me; &ldquo;he has a way of making one appear so  small.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Gryce shot an askance look at his shadow gloomily  following him along the pavement. &ldquo;Yet it may happen that you will have to run  the risk of that very experience.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I glanced towards him in amazement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If the girl does not turn up of her own accord, or if  we do not succeed in getting some trace of her movements, I shall be tempted to  place you where you can study into the ways of this gentleman&rsquo;s household. If  the affair is a mystery, it has its centre in that house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I stared at Mr. Gryce good and roundly. &ldquo;You have come  across something which I have missed,&rdquo; observed I, &ldquo;or you could not speak so  positively.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have come across nothing that was not in plain  sight of any body who had eyes to see it,&rdquo; he returned shortly.</p>
  <p>I shook my head slightly mortified.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You had it all before you,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;and if you  were not able to pick up sufficient facts on which to base a conclusion, you mustn&rsquo;t  blame me for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>More nettled than I would be willing to confess, I  walked back with him to the station, saying nothing then, but inwardly  determined to reestablish my reputation with Mr. Gryce before the affair was  over. Accordingly hunting up the man who had patrolled the district the night  before, I inquired if he had seen any one go in or out of the side gate of Mr.  Blake&rsquo;s house on &mdash;street, between the hours of eleven and one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I heard Thompson tell a curious  story this morning about some one he had seen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He said he was passing that way last night about  twelve o&rsquo;clock when he remarked standing under the lamp on the corner of Second  Avenue, a group consisting of two men and a woman, who no sooner beheld him than  they separated, the men drawing back into Second Avenue and the woman coming  hastily towards him. Not understanding the move, he stood waiting her approach,  when instead of advancing to where he was, she paused at the gate of Mr. Blake&rsquo;s  house and lifted her hand as if to open it, when with a wild and terrified  gesture she started back, covering her face with her hands, and before he knew  it, had actually fled in the direction from which she had come. A little  startled, Thompson advanced and looked through the gate before him to see if  possible what had alarmed her, when to his great surprise, he beheld the pale  face of the master of the house, Mr. Blake himself, looking through the bars  from the other side of the gate. He in his turn started back and before he  could recover himself, Mr. Blake had disappeared. He says he tried the gate  after that, but found it locked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thompson tells you this story, does he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a pretty wild kind of a tale,  and all I have got to say is, that neither you nor Thompson had better go  blabbing it around too much. <i>Mum</i> is the word where such men as Mr. Blake are  concerned.&rdquo; And I departed to hunt up Thompson.</p>
  <p>But he had nothing to add to his statement, except  that the girl appeared to be tall and thin, and was closely wrapped about in a  shawl. My next move was to make such inquiries as I could with safety into the  private concerns of Mr. Blake and his family, and discovered&mdash;well, such facts  as these:</p>
  <p>That Mr. Blake was a man who if he paid but little attention  to domestic affairs was yet rarely seen out of his own house, except upon  occasions of great political importance, when he was always to be found on the  platform at meetings of his constituents. Though to the ordinary observer a man  eminently calculated, from his good looks, fine position, and solid wealth to  enjoy society, he not only manifested a distaste for it, but even went so far  as to refuse to participate in the social dinners of his most intimate friends;  the only table to which he would sit down being that of some public caterer,  where he was sure of finding none but his political associates assembled.</p>
  <p>To all appearance he wished to avoid the ladies, a  theory borne out by the fact that never, even in church, on the street, or at  any place of amusement, was he observed with one at his side. This fact in a  man, young&mdash;he was not far from thirty-five at that time&mdash;rich, and marriageable,  would, however, have been more noteworthy than it was if he had not been known  to belong to a family eminent for their eccentricities. Not a man of all his  race but had possessed some marked peculiarity. His father, bibliomaniac though  he was, would never treat a man or a woman with decency, who mentioned  Shakspeare to him, nor would he acknowledge to his dying day any excellence in  that divine poet beyond a happy way of putting words together. Mr. Blake&rsquo;s  uncle hated all members of the legal profession, and as for his grandfather&mdash;but  you have heard what a mania of dislike he had against that simple article of  diet, fish; how his friends were obliged to omit it from their bills of fare  whenever they expected him to dinner. If then Mr. Blake chose to have any pet  antipathy&mdash;as for women for instance&mdash;he surely had precedent enough in his own  family to back him. However, it was whispered in my ear by one gentleman, a  former political colleague of his who had been with him in Washington, that he  was known at one time to show considerable attention to Miss Evelyn Blake, that  cousin of his who has since made such a brilliant thing of it by marrying, and  straightway losing by death, a wealthy old scapegrace of a French noble, the  Count De Mirac. But that was not a matter to be talked about, Madame the  Countess being free at present and in New York, though to all appearance upon  anything but pleasant terms with her quondam admirer.</p>
  <p>Remembering the picture I had seen in Mr. Blake&rsquo;s  private apartment, I asked if this lady was a brunette, and being told she was,  and of the most pronounced type, felt for the moment I had stumbled upon  something in the shape of a clue; but upon resorting to Mr. Gryce with my  information, he shook his head with a short laugh and told me I would have to  dive deeper than that if I wanted to fish up the truth lying at the bottom of<i> this </i>well.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter05"></a><b>Chapter V<br>
    A New York Belle</b></h2>
  <p>Meanwhile all our efforts to obtain information in  regard to the fate or whereabouts of the missing girl, had so far proved  utterly futile. Even the advertisements inserted by Mrs. Daniels had produced  no effect; and frustrated in my scheme I began to despair, when the accounts of  that same Mrs. Daniels&rsquo; strange and unaccountable behavior during these days of  suspense, which came to me through Fanny, (the pretty housemaid at Mr. Blake&rsquo;s,  whose acquaintance I had lately taken to cultivating,) aroused once more my  dormant energies and led me to ask myself if the affair was quite as hopeless  as it seemed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If she was a ghost,&rdquo; was her final expression on the  subject, &ldquo;she couldn&rsquo;t go peramberlating this house more than she does. It  seems as if she couldn&rsquo;t keep still a minute. Upstairs and down, upstairs and  down, till we&rsquo;re most wild. And so white as she is and so trembling! Why her  hands shake so all the time she never dares lift a dish off the table. And then  the way she hangs about Mr. Blake&rsquo;s door when he&rsquo;s at home! She never goes in,  that&rsquo;s the oddest part of it, but walks up and down before it, wringing her  hands and talking to herself just like a mad woman. Why, I have seen her almost  put her hand on the knob twice in an afternoon perhaps, then draw back as if  she was afraid it would burn her; and if by any chance the door opened and Mr.  Blake came out, you ought to have seen how she run. What it all means I don&rsquo;t  know, but I have my imaginings, and if she isn&rsquo;t crazy, why&mdash;&rdquo; etc., etc.</p>
  <p>In face of facts like these I felt it would be pure  insanity to despair. Let there be but a mystery, though it involved a man of  the position of Mr. Blake and I was safe. My only apprehension had been that  the whole affair would dissolve itself into an ordinary elopement or some such  common-place matter.</p>
  <p>When, therefore, a few minutes later, Fanny announced  that Mr. Blake had ordered a carriage to take him to the Charity Ball that  evening, I determined to follow him and learn if possible what change had taken  place in himself or his circumstances, to lead him into such an innovation upon  his usual habits. Though the hour was late I had but little difficulty in  carrying out my plan, arriving at the Academy something less than an hour after  the opening dance.</p>
  <p>The crowd was great and I circulated the floor three  times before I came upon him. When I did, I own I was slightly disappointed;  for instead of finding him as I anticipated, the centre of an admiring circle  of ladies and gentlemen, I espied him withdrawn into a corner with a bland old  politician of the Fifteenth Ward, discussing, as I presently overheard, the  merits and demerits of a certain Smith who at that time was making some  disturbance in the party.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If that is all he has come for,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;I had  better have stayed at home and made love to the pretty Fanny.&rdquo; And somewhat  chagrined, I took up my stand near by, and began scrutinizing the ladies.</p>
  <p>Suddenly I felt my heart stand still, the noise of  voices ceasing the same instant behind me. A lady was passing on the arm of a  foreign-looking gentleman, whom it did not require a second glance to identify  with the subject of the portrait in Mr. Blake&rsquo;s house. Older by some few years  than when her picture was painted, her beauty had assumed a certain defiant expression  that sufficiently betrayed the fact that the years had not been so wholly happy  as she had probably anticipated when she jilted handsome Holman Blake for the  old French Count. At all events so I interpreted the look of latent scorn that  burned in her dark eyes, as she slowly turned her richly bejeweled head towards  the corner where that gentleman stood, and meeting his eyes no doubt, bowed  with a sudden loss of self-possession that not all the haughty carriage of her  noble form, held doubly erect for the next few moments, could quite conceal or  make forgotten.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She still loves him,&rdquo; I inwardly commented and turned  to see if the surprise had awakened any expression on his uncommunicative  countenance.</p>
  <p>Evidently not, for the tough old politician of the Fifteenth  Ward was laughing, at one of his own jokes probably, and looking up in the face  of Mr. Blake, whose back was turned to me, in a way that entirely precluded all  thought of any tragic expression in that quarter. Somewhat disgusted, I  withdrew and followed the lady.</p>
  <p>I could not get very near. By this time the presence  of a live countess in the assembly had become known, and I found her surrounded  by a swarm of half-fledged youths. But I cared little for this; all I wanted to  know was whether Mr. Blake would approach her or not during the evening.  Tediously the moments passed; but a detective on duty, or on fancied duty,  succumbs to no weariness. I had a woman before me worth studying and the time  could not be thrown away. I learned to know her beauty; the poise of her head,  the flush of her cheek, the curl of her lip, the glance&mdash;yes, the glance of her  eye, though that was more difficult to understand, for she had a way of  drooping her lids at times that, while exceedingly effective upon the poor wretch  toward whom she might be directing that half-veiled shaft of light, was  anything but conducive to my purposes.</p>
  <p>At length with a restless shrug of her haughty  shoulders she turned away from her crowd of adorers, her breast heaving under  its robing of garnet velvet, and her whole face flaring with a light that might  mean resolve and might mean simply love. I had no need to turn my head to see  who was advancing towards her; her stately attitude as countess, her thrilling  glance as woman, betrayed only too readily.</p>
  <p>He was the more composed of the two. Bowing over her  hand with a few words I could not hear, he drew back a step and began uttering  the usual common-place sentiments of the occasion.</p>
  <p>She did not respond. With a splendor of indifference  not often seen even in the manner of our grandest ladies, she waited, opening  and shutting her richly feathered fan, as one who would say, &ldquo;I know all this  has to be gone through with, therefore I will be patient.&rdquo; But as the moments  passed, and his tone remained unchanged, I could detect a slight gleam of  impatience flash in the depths of her dark eyes, and a change come into the  conventional smile that had hitherto lighted, without illuminating her  countenance. Drawing still further back from the crowd that was not to be awed  from pressing upon her, she looked around as if seeking a refuge. Her glance  fell upon a certain window, with a gleam of satisfaction. Seeing they would  straightway withdraw there, I took advantage of the moment and made haste to  conceal myself behind a curtain as near that vicinity as possible. In another  instant I heard them approaching.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You seem to be rather overwhelmed with attention  to-night,&rdquo; were the first words I caught, uttered in Mr. Blake&rsquo;s calmest and  most courteous tones.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; was the slightly sarcastic reply. &ldquo;I  was just deciding to the contrary when you came up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a pause. Taking out my knife, I ripped open  a seam in the curtain hanging before me, and looked through. He was eyeing her  intently, a firm look upon his face that made its reserve more marked than  common. I saw him gaze at her handsome head piled with its midnight tresses  amid which the jewels, doubtless of her dead lord, burned with a fierce and  ominous glare, at her smooth olive brow, her partly veiled eyes where the fire  passionately blazed, at her scarlet lips trembling with an emotion her rapidly  flushing cheeks would not allow her to conceal. I saw his glances fall and  embrace her whole elegant form with its casing of ruby velvet and ornamentation  of lace and diamonds, and an expectant thrill passed through me almost as if I  already beheld the mask of his reserve falling, and the true man flash out in  response to the wooing beauty of this full-blown rose, evidently in waiting for  him. But it died away and a deeper feeling seized me as I saw his glances  return unkindled to her countenance, and heard him say in still more measured  accents than before:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is it possible then that the Countess De Mirac can  desire the adulation of us poor American plebeians? I had not thought it,  madame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Slowly her dark eyes turned towards him; she stood a  statue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I forget,&rdquo; he went on, a tinge of bitterness for  a moment showing itself in his smile: &ldquo;perhaps in returning to her own country,  Evelyn Blake has so far forgotten the last two years as to find pleasure again  in the toys and foibles of her youth. Such things have been, I hear.&rdquo; And he  bowed almost to the ground in his half sarcastic homage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Evelyn Blake! It is long since I have heard that  name,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
  <p>He could not restrain the quick flush from mounting to  his brow. &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if it brings you sadness or unwelcome  memories. I promise you I will not so transgress again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A wan smile crossed her lips grown suddenly pallid.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mistake,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;if my name brings up a past  laden with bitter memories and shadowed by regret, it also recalls much that is  pleasant and never to be forgotten. I do not object to hearing my girlhood&rsquo;s  name uttered&mdash;by my nearest relative.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The answer was dignity itself. &ldquo;Your name is Countess  De Mirac, your relatives must be proud to utter it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A gleam not unlike the lightning&rsquo;s quick flash shot  from the eyes she drooped before him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is it Holman Blake I am listening to,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I  do not recognize my old friend in the cool and sarcastic man of the world now  before me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We often fail to recognize the work of our hands,  madame, after it has fallen from our grasp.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;do you mean&mdash;would you say that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would say nothing,&rdquo; interrupted he calmly, stooping  for the fan she had dropped. &ldquo;At an interview which is at once a meeting and a  parting, I would give utterance to nothing which would seem like recrimination.  I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed she, reaching out her hand  for her fan with a gesture lofty as it was resolute. &ldquo;You have spoken a word  which demands explanation; what have I ever done to you that you should speak  the word recrimination to me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What? You shook my faith in womankind; you showed me  that a woman who had once told a man she loved him, could so far forget that  love as to marry one she could never respect, for the sake of titles and  jewels. You showed me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold,&rdquo; said she again, this time without gesture or  any movement, save that of her lips grown pallid as marble, &ldquo;and what did you show  me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He started, colored profoundly, and for a moment stood  before her unmasked of his stern self-possession. &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said he,  &ldquo;I take back that word, recrimination.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was now her turn to lift her head and survey him.  With glance less cool than his, but fully as deliberate, she looked at his  proud head bending before her; studying his face, line by line, from the stern  brow to the closely compressed lips on which melancholy seemed to have set its  everlasting seal, and a change passed over her countenance. &ldquo;Holman,&rdquo; said she,  with a sudden rush of tenderness, &ldquo;if in the times gone by, we both behaved  with too much worldly prudence for it now to be any great pleasure for either  of us to look back, is that any reason why we should mar our whole future by  dwelling too long upon what we are surely still young enough to bury if not  forget? I acknowledge that I would have behaved in a more ideal fashion, if,  after I had been forsaken by you, I had turned my face from society, and let  the canker-worm of despair slowly destroy whatever life and bloom I had left.  But I was young, and society had its charms, so did the prospect of wealth and  position, however hollow they may have proved; you who are the master of both  this day, because twelve months ago you forsook Evelyn Blake, should be the  last to reproach me with them. <i>I</i> do not reproach you; I only say let the past  be forgotten&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; exclaimed he, his whole face darkening  with an expression I could not fathom. &ldquo;What was done at that time cannot be  undone. For you and me there is no future. Yes,&rdquo; he said turning towards her as  she made a slight fluttering move of dissent, &ldquo;<i>no future</i>; we can bury the past,  but we can not resurrect it. I doubt if you would wish to if we could; as we  cannot, of course you will not desire even to converse upon the subject again.  Evelyn I wanted to see you <i>once</i>, but I do not wish to see you again; will you  pardon my plain speaking, and release me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will pardon your plain speaking, but&mdash;&rdquo; Her look  said she would not release him.</p>
  <p>He seemed to understand it so, and smiled, but very  bitterly. In another moment he had bowed and gone, and she had returned to her  crowd of adoring sycophants.</p>

    A Bit Of Calico</b></h2>
  <p>It was about this time that I took up my residence in  a sort of lodging-house that occupied the opposite corner to that of Mr. Blake.  My room, as I took pains to have it, overlooked the avenue, and from its  windows I could easily watch the goings and comings of the gentleman whose  movements were daily becoming of more and more interest to me. For set it down  to caprice&mdash;and men are often as capricious as women&mdash;or account for it as you  will, his restlessness at this period was truly remarkable. Not a day that he  did not spend his time in walking the streets, and that not in his usual  aimless gentlemanly fashion, but eagerly and with an intent gaze that roamed  here and there, like a bird seeking its prey. It would often be as late as five  o&rsquo;clock before he came in, and if, as now frequently happened, he did not have  company to dinner, he was even known to start out again after seven o&rsquo;clock and  go over the same ground as in the morning, looking with strained gaze, that  vainly endeavored to appear unconcerned, into the faces of the women that he  passed. I not unfrequently followed him at these times as much for my own  amusement as from any hope I had of coming upon anything that should aid me in  the work before me. But when he suddenly changed his route of travel from a  promenade in the fashionable thoroughfares of Broadway and Fourteenth Street to  a walk through Chatham Square and the dark, narrow streets of the East side, I  began to scent whom the prey might be that he was seeking, and putting every  other consideration aside, regularly set myself to dog his steps, as only I,  with my innumerable disguises, knew how to do. For three separate days I kept  at his heels wherever he went, each day growing more and more astonished if not  to say hopeful, as I found myself treading the narrowest and most disreputable  streets of the city; halting at the shops of pawnbrokers; peering into the  back-rooms of liquor shops; mixing with the crowds that infest the corner  groceries at nightfall, and even slinking with hand on the trigger of the  pistol I carried in my pocket, up dark alleys where every door that swung  noiselessly to and fro as we passed, shut upon haunts of such villainy as only  is known to us of the police, or to those good souls that for the sake of One  whose example they follow, lay aside their fears and sensitiveness to carry  light into the dim pits of this wretched world. At first I thought Mr. Blake  might have some such reason for the peculiar course he took. But his  indifference to all crowds where only men were collected, his silence where a  word would have been well received, convinced me it was a woman he was seeking  and that with an intentness which blinded him to the commonest needs of the  hour. I even saw him once in his hurry and abstraction, step across the body of  a child who had fallen face downward on the stones, and that with an expression  showing he was utterly unconscious of anything but an obstacle in his path. The  strangest part of it all was that he seemed to have no fear. To be sure he took  pains to leave his watch at home; but with such a figure and carriage as he  possessed, the absence of jewelry could never deceive the eye for a moment as  to the fact of his being a man of wealth, and those he went among would do  anything for money. Perhaps, like me, he carried a pistol. At all events he  shunned no spot where either poverty lay hid or deviltry reigned, his proud  stern head bending to enter the lowest doors without a tremble of the haughty  lips that remained compressed as by an iron force; except when some poor  forlorn creature with flaunting head-gear, and tremulous hands, attracted by  his bearing would hastily brush against him, when he would turn and look,  perhaps speak, though what he said I always failed to catch; after which he  would hurry on as if possessed by seven devils. The evenings of those three  days were notable also. Two of them he spent in the manner I have described;  the third he went to the Windsor House&mdash;where the Countess De Mirac had taken  rooms&mdash;going up to the ladies&rsquo; entrance and actually ringing the bell, only to  start back and walk up and down on the opposite side of the way, with his hands  behind his back, and his head bent, evidently deliberating as to whether he  should or should not carry out his original intention of entering. The arrival  of a carriage with the stately subject of his deliberations, who from her  elaborate costume had seemingly been to some kettledrum or private reception,  speedily put an end to his doubts. As the door opened to admit her, I saw him  cast one look at her heavily draped person, with its snowy opera-cloak drawn  tightly over the sweeping folds of her maize colored silk, and shrink back with  what sounded like a sigh of anger or distrust, and without waiting for the  closing of the door upon her, turn toward home with a step that hesitated no  longer.</p>
  <p>The fourth day to my infinite chagrin, I was sick and  could not go with him. All I could do was to wrap myself in blankets and sit in  my window from which I had the satisfaction of viewing him start as I supposed  upon his usual course. The rest of the day was employed in a long, dull waiting  for his return, only relieved by casual glimpses of Mrs. Daniels&rsquo; troubled face  as she appeared at one window or another of the old-fashioned mansion before  me. She seemed, too, to be unusually restless, opening the windows and looking  out with forlorn cranings of her neck as if she too were watching for her  master. Indeed I have no doubt from what I afterwards learned, that she was in  a state of constant suspense during these days. Her frequent appearance at the  station house, where she in vain sought for some news of the girl in whose fate  she was so absorbed, confirmed this. Only the day before I gave myself up to my  unreserved espionage of Mr. Blake, she had had an interview with Mr. Gryce in  which she had let fall her apprehensions that the girl was dead, and asked  whether if that were the case, the police would be likely to come into a  knowledge of the fact. Upon being assured that if she had not been privately  made way with, there was every chance in their favor, she had grown a little  calmer, but before going away had so far forgotten herself as to intimate that  if some result was not reached before another fortnight had elapsed, she should  take the matter into her own hands and&mdash;She did not say what she would do, but  her looks were of a very menacing character. It was no wonder, then, that her  countenance bore marks of the keenest anxiety as she trod the halls of that dim  old mansion, with its dusky corners rich with bronzes and the glimmering shine  of ancient brocades, breathing suggestions of loss and wrong; or bent her  wrinkled forehead to gaze from the windows for the coming of one whose  footsteps were ever delayed. She happened to be looking out, when after a  longer stroll than usual the master of the house returned. As he made his  appearance at the corner, I saw her hurriedly withdraw her head and hide  herself behind the curtain, from which position she watched him as with tired  steps and somewhat dejected mien, he passed up the steps and entered the house.  Not till the door closed upon him, did she venture to issue forth and with a  hurried movement shut the blinds and disappear. This anxiety on her part  redoubled mine, and thankful enough was I when on the next day I found myself  well enough to renew my operations. To ferret out this mystery, if mystery it  was,&mdash;I still found myself forced to admit the possibility of there being  none&mdash;had now become the one ambition of my life; and all because it was not  only an unusually blind one, but of a nature that involved danger to my  position as detective, I entered upon it with a zest rare even to me who love  my work and all it involves with an undivided passion.</p>
  <p>To equip myself, then, in a fresh disguise and to join  Mr. Blake shortly after he had left his own corner, was anything but a hardship  to me that bright winter morning, though I knew from past experience, a long  and wearisome walk was before me with nothing in all probability at the end but  reiterated disappointment. But for once the fates had willed it otherwise. Whether  Mr. Blake, discouraged at the failure of his own attempts, whatever they were,  felt less heart to prosecute them than usual I cannot say, but we had scarcely  entered upon the lower end of the Bowery, before he suddenly turned with a look  of disgust, and gazing hurriedly about him, hailed a Madison Avenue car that  was rapidly approaching. I was at that moment on the other side of the way, but  I hurried forward too, and signaled the same car. But just as I was on the  point of entering it I perceived Mr. Blake step hastily back and with his eyes  upon a girl that was hurrying past him with a basket on her arm, regain the  sidewalk with a swiftness that argued his desire to stop her. Of course I let  the car pass me, though I did not dare approach him too closely after my late  conspicuous attempt to enter it with him. But from my stand on the opposite  curb-stone I saw him draw aside the girl, who from her garments might have been  the daughter or wife of any one of the shiftless, drinking wretches lounging  about on the four corners within my view, and after talking earnestly with her  for a few moments, saunter at her side down Broome Street, still talking.  Reckless at this sight of the consequences which might follow his detection of  the part I was playing, I hasted after them, when I was suddenly disconcerted  by observing him hurriedly separate from the girl and turn towards me with  intention as it were to regain the corner he had left. Weighing in an instant  the probable good to be obtained by following either party, I determined to  leave Mr. Blake for one day to himself, and turn my attention to the girl he  had addressed, especially as she was tall and thin and bore herself with  something like grace.</p>
  <p>Barely bestowing a glance upon him, then, as he  passed, in a vain attempt to read the sombre expression of his inscrutable face  grown five years older in the last five days, I shuffled after the girl now  flitting before me down Broome Street. As I did so, I noticed her dress to its  minutest details, somewhat surprised to find how ragged and uncouth it was.  That Mr. Blake should stop a girl wherever seen, clad in a black alpaca frock,  a striped shawl and a Bowery hat trimmed with feathers, I could easily  understand; but that this creature with her faded calico dress, dingy cape  thrown carelessly over her head, and ragged basket, should arrest his  attention, was a riddle to me. I hastened forward with intent to catch a  glimpse of her countenance if possible; but she seemed to have acquired wings  to her feet since her interview with Mr. Blake. Darting into a crowd of hooting  urchins that were rushing from Centre Street after a broken wagon and runaway  horse, she sped from my sight with such rapidity, I soon saw that my only hope  of overtaking her lay in running. I accordingly quickened my steps when those  same hooting youngsters getting in the way of my feet, I tripped up and&mdash;well, I  own I retired from that field baffled. Not entirely so, however. Just as I was  going down, I caught sight of the girl tearing away from a box of garbage on  the curb-stone; and when order having been restored, by which lofty statement I  mean to say when your humble servant had regained his equilibrium, I awoke to  the fact that she had effectually disappeared, I hurried to that box and  succeeded in finding hanging to it a bit of rag easily recognized as a piece of  the old calico frock of nameless color which I had been following a moment  before. Regarding it as the sole spoils of a very unsatisfactory day&rsquo;s work, I  put it carefully away in my pocket book, where it lay till&mdash;But with all my zeal  for compression, I must not anticipate.</p>
  <p>When I came home that afternoon I found myself  unexpectedly involved in a matter that for the remainder of the day at least,  prevented me from further attending to the affair I had in hand. The next  morning Mr. Blake did not start out as usual, and at noon I received intimation  from Fanny that he was preparing to take a journey. Where, she could not inform  me, nor when, though she thought it probable he would take an early train. Mrs.  Daniels was feeling dreadfully, she informed me; and the house was like a  grave. Greatly excited at this unexpected move on Mr. Blake&rsquo;s part, I went home  and packed my valise with something of the spirit of her who once said, under  somewhat different circumstances I allow, &ldquo;Whither thou goest I will go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The truth was, I had travelled so far and learned so  little, that my professional pride was piqued. That expression of Mr. Gryce  still rankled, and nothing could soothe my injured spirit now but success.  Accordingly when Mr. Blake stepped up to the ticket office of the Hudson River  Railroad next morning, to buy a ticket for Putney, a small town in the northern  part of Vermont, he found beside him a spruce young drummer, or what certainly  appeared such, who by some strange coincidence, wanted a ticket for the same  place. The fact did not seem in the least to surprise him, nor did he cast me a  look beyond the ordinary glance of one stranger at another. Indeed Mr. Blake  had no appearance of being a suspicious man, nor do I think at this time, he  had the remotest idea that he was either watched or followed; an ignorance of  the truth which I took care to preserve by taking my seat in a different car  from him and not showing myself again during the whole ride from New York to  Putney.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter07"></a><b>Chapter VII<br>
    The House At The Granby Cross Roads</b></h2>
  <p>Why Mr. Blake should take a journey at all at this  time, and why of all places in the world he should choose such an insignificant  town as Putney for his destination, was of course the mystery upon which I  brooded during the entire distance. But when somewhere near five in the  afternoon I stepped from the cars on to the platform at Putney Station only to  hear Mr. Blake making inquiries in regard to a certain stage running between  that town and a still smaller village further east, I own I was not only  surprised but well-nigh nonplussed. Especially as he seemed greatly  disappointed to hear that it only ran once a day, and then for an earlier train  in the morning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will have to wait till to-morrow I fear,&rdquo; said  the ticket agent, &ldquo;unless the landlord of the hotel down yonder, can harness  you up a team. There is a funeral out west to-day and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I did not wait to hear more but hurried down to the  hotel he had pointed out, and hunting up the landlord inquired if for love or  money he could get me any sort of a conveyance for Melville that afternoon. He  assured me it would be impossible, the livery stable as well as his own being  entirely empty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Such a thing don&rsquo;t happen here once in five years,&rdquo;  said he to me. &ldquo;But the old codger who is dead, though a queer dick was a noted  personage in these parts, and not a man, woman or child, who could find a  horse, mule or donkey, but what availed himself of the privilege. Even the  doctor&rsquo;s spavined mare was pressed into service, though she halts on one leg  and stops to get her breath half a dozen times in going up one short hill. You  will have to wait for the stage, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I am in a hurry,&rdquo; said I as I saw Mr. Blake  enter. &ldquo;I have business in Melville tonight, and I would pay anything in reason  to get there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the landlord only shook his head; and drawing back  with the air of an abused man, I took up my stand in the doorway where I could  hear the same colloquy entered into with Mr. Blake, with the same  unsatisfactory termination. He did not take it quite as calmly as I did, though  he was of too reserved a nature to display much emotion over anything. The  prospect of a long tedious evening spent in a country hotel seemed almost  unendurable to him, but he finally succumbed to the force of circumstances, as  indeed he seemed obliged to do, and partaking of such refreshment as the rather  poorly managed hotel afforded, retired without ceremony to his room, from which  he did not emerge again till next morning. In all this he had somehow managed  not to give his name; and by means of some inquiries I succeeded in making that  evening, I found his person was unknown in the town.</p>
  <p>By a little management I secured the next room to his,  by which arrangement I succeeded in passing a sleepless night, Mr. Blake  spending most of the wee small hours in pacing the floor of his room, with an  unremitting regularity that had anything but a soothing effect upon my nerves.  Early the next morning we took the stage, he sitting on the back seat, and I in  front with the driver. There were other passengers, but I noticed he never  spoke to any of them, nor through all the long drive did he once look up from  the corner where he had ensconced himself. It was twelve o&rsquo;clock when we  reached the end of the route, a small town of somewhat less than the usual  pretensions of mountain villages; so insignificant indeed, that I found it more  and more difficult to imagine what the wealthy ex-Congressman could find in  such a spot as this, to make amends for a journey of such length and  discomfort; when to my increasing wonder I heard him give orders for a horse to  be saddled and brought round to the inn door directly after dinner. This was a  move I had not expected and it threw me a little aback, for although I had thus  far managed to hold myself so aloof from Mr. Blake, even while keeping him  under my eye, that no suspicion of my interest in his movements had as yet been  awakened, how could I thus for the third time follow his order with one precisely  similar, without attracting an attention that would be fatal to my plans. Yet  to let him ride off alone now, would be to drop the trail at the very moment  the scent became of importance.</p>
  <p>The landlord, a bustling, wiry little man all  nervousness and questions, unwittingly helped me at this crisis.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you going on to Perry, sir?&rdquo; inquired he of that  gentleman, &ldquo;I have been expecting a man along these three days bound for Perry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am that man,&rdquo; I broke in, stepping forward with  some appearance of asperity, &ldquo;and I hope you won&rsquo;t keep me waiting. A horse as  soon as dinner is over, do you hear? I am two days late now, and won&rsquo;t stand  any nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And to escape the questions sure to follow, I strode  into the dining-room with a half-fierce, half-sullen countenance, that  effectually precluded all advances. During the meal I saw Mr. Blake&rsquo;s eye roam  more than once towards my face; but I did not return his gaze, or notice him in  any way; hurrying through my dinner, and mounting the first horse brought around,  as if time were my only consideration. But once on the road I took the first  opportunity to draw rein and wait, suddenly remembering that I had not heard  Mr. Blake give any intimation of the direction he intended taking. A few  minutes revealed to me his elegant form well mounted and showing to perfection  in his closely buttoned coat, slowly approaching up the road. Taking advantage  of a rise in the ground, I lingered till he was almost upon me, when I cantered  quickly on, fearing to arouse his apprehensions if I allowed him to pass me on  a road so solitary as that which now stretched out before us: a move  provocative of much embarassment to me, as I dared not turn my head for the  same reason, anxious as I was to keep him in sight.</p>
  <p>The roads dividing before me, at length gave me my  first opportunity to pause and look back. He was some fifty paces behind.  Waiting till he came up, I bowed with the surly courtesy I thought in keeping  with the character I had assumed, and asked if he knew which road led towards  Perry, saying I had come off in such haste I had forgotten to inquire my way.  He returned my bow, pointed towards the left hand road and saying, &ldquo;I know this  does <i>not</i>,&rdquo; calmly took it.</p>
  <p>Now here was a dilemma. If in face of this curt  response I proceeded to follow him, my hand was revealed at once; yet the  circumstances would admit of no other course. I determined to compromise  matters by pretending to take the right hand road till he was out of sight,  when I would return and follow him swiftly upon the left. Accordingly I reined  my horse to the right, and for some fifteen minutes galloped slowly away  towards the north; but another fifteen saw me facing the west, and riding with  a force and fury of which I had not thought the old mare they had given me capable,  till I put her to the test. It was not long before I saw my fine gentleman  trotting in front of me up a long but gentle slope that rose in the distance;  and slackening my own rein, I withdrew into the forest at the side of the road,  till he had passed its summit and disappeared, when I again galloped forward.</p>
  <p>And thus we went on for an hour, over the most uneven  country I ever traversed, he always one hill ahead; when suddenly, by what  instinct I cannot determine, I felt myself approaching the end, and hastening  to the top of the ascent up which I was then laboring, looked down into the  shallow valley spread out before me.</p>
  <p>What a sight met my eyes if I had been intent on  anything less practical than the movements of the solitary horseman below!  Hills on hills piled about a verdant basin in whose depths nestled a scanty  collection of houses, in number so small they could be told upon the fingers of  the right hand, but which notwithstanding lent an indescribable aspect of  comfort to this remote region of hill and forest.</p>
  <p>But the vision of Mr. Blake pausing half way down the  slope before me, examining, yes examining a pistol which he held in his hand,  soon put an end to all ideas of romance. Somewhat alarmed I reined back; but  his action had evidently no connection with me, for he did not once glance  behind him, but kept his eye on the road which I now observed took a short turn  towards a house of so weird and ominous an appearance that I scarcely marvelled  at his precaution.</p>
  <p>Situated on a level track of land at the crossing of  three roads, its spacious front, rude and unpainted as it was, presented every  appearance of an inn, but from its moss-grown chimneys no smoke arose, nor  could I detect any sign of life in its shutterless windows and closed doors, across  which shivered the dark shadow of the one gaunt and aged pine, that stood like  a guard beside its tumbled-down porch.</p>
  <p>Mr. Blake seemed to have been struck by the same fact  concerning its loneliness, for hurriedly replacing his pistol in his breast  pocket, he rode slowly forward. I instantly conceived the plan of striking  across the belt of underbrush that separated me from this old dwelling, and by  taking my stand opposite its front, intercept a view of Mr. Blake as he  approached. Hastily dismounting, therefore, I led my horse into the bushes and  tied her to a tree, proceeding to carry out my plan on foot. I was so far  successful as to arrive at the further edge of the wood, which was thick enough  to conceal my presence without being too dense to obstruct my vision, just as  Mr. Blake passed on his way to this solitary dwelling. He was looking very  anxious, but determined. Turning my eyes from him, I took another glance at the  house, which by this movement I had brought directly before me. It was even more  deserted-looking than I had thought; its unpainted front with its double row of  blank windows meeting your gaze without a response, while the huge old pine  with half its limbs dismantled of foliage, rattled its old bones against its  sides and moaned in its aged fashion like the solitary retainer of a dead race.</p>
  <p>I own I felt the cold shivers creep down my back as  that creaking sound struck my ears, though as the day was chill with an east  wind I dare say it was more the effect of my sudden cessation from exercise,  than of any superstitious awe I felt. Mr. Blake seemed to labor under no such  impressions. Riding up to the front door he knocked without dismounting, on its  dismal panels with his riding whip. No response was heard. Knitting his brows  impatiently, he tried the latch: the door was locked. Hastily running his eye  over the face of the building, he drew rein and proceeded to ride around the  house, which he could easily do owing to the absence of every obstruction in  the way of fence or shrubbery. Finding no means of entrance he returned again  to the front door which he shook with an impatient hand that however produced  no impression upon the trusty lock, and recognizing, doubtless, the futility of  his endeavors, he drew back, and merely pausing to give one other look at its  deserted front, turned his horse&rsquo;s head, and to my great amazement, proceeded  with sombre mien and clouded brow to retake the road to Melville.</p>
  <p>This old inn or decayed homestead was then the object  of his lengthened and tedious journey; this ancient house rotting away among  the bleak hills of Vermont, the bourne towards which his steps had been tending  for these past two days. I could not understand it. Rapidly emerging from the  spot where I had secreted myself, I in my turn made a circuit of the house, if  happily I should discover some loophole of entrance which had escaped his  attention. But every door and window was securely barred, and I was about to  follow his example and leave the spot, when I saw two or three children  advancing towards me down the cross roads, gaily swinging their school books. I  noticed they hesitated and huddled together as they approached and saw me, but  not heeding this, I accosted them with a pleasant word or so, then pointing  over my shoulder to the house behind, asked who lived there. Instantly their  already pale faces grew paler.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; cried one, a boy, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know? That is  where the two wicked men lived who stole the money out of the Rutland bank.  They were put in prison, but they got away and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here, the other, a little girl, plucked him by the  sleeve with such affright, that he himself took alarm and just giving me one  quick stare out of his wide eyes, grasped his companion by the hand and took to  his heels. As for myself I stood rooted to the ground in my astonishment. This  blank, sleepy old house the home of the notorious Schoenmakers after whom half  of the detectives of the country were searching? I could scarcely credit my own  ears. True I now remembered they had come from these parts, still&mdash;</p>
  <p>Turning round I eyed the house once more. How altered  it looked to me! What a murderous aspect it wore, and how dismally secret were  the tight shut windows and closely fastened doors, on one of which a rude cross  scrawled in red chalk met the eye with a mysterious significance. Even the old  pine had acquired the villainous air of the uncanny repositor of secrets too  dreadful to reveal, as it groaned and murmured to itself in the keen east wind.  Dark deeds and foul wrong seemed written all over the fearful place, from the  long strings of black moss that clung to the worm-eaten eaves, to the worn  stone with its great blotch of something,&mdash;could it have been blood?&mdash;that served  as a threshold to the door. Suddenly with the quickness of lightning the  thought flashed across me, what could Mr. Blake, the aristocratic  representative of New York&rsquo;s oldest family, have wanted in this nest of infamy?  What errand of hope, fear, despair, avarice or revenge, could have brought this  superior gentleman with his refined tastes and proudly reticent manners, so  many miles from home, to the forsaken den of a brace of hardy villains whose  name for two years now, had stood as the type of all that was bold, bad and  lawless, and for whom during the last six weeks the prison had yawned, and the  gallows hungered. Contemplation brought no reply, and shocked at my own  thoughts, I put the question by for steadier brains than mine; and instead of  trying further to solve it, cast about how I was to gain entrance into this  deserted building; for to enter it I was more than ever determined, now that I  had heard to whom it had once belonged.</p>
  <p>Examining with a glance the several roads that  branched off in every direction from where I stood, I found them all equally  deserted. Even the school children had disappeared in some one of the four or  five houses scattered in the remote distance.</p>
  <p>If I was willing to enter upon any daring exploit,  there was no one to observe or interrupt. I resolved to make the attempt with  which my mind was full. This was to climb the old tree, and from one of the two  or three branches that brushed against the house, gain entrance at an open  garret window that stared at me from amid the pine&rsquo;s dark needles. Taking off  my coat with a sigh over the immaculate condition of my new cassimere trousers,  I bent my energies to the task. A difficult one you will say for a city lad,  but thanks to fortune I was not brought up in New York, and know how to climb  trees with the best. With little more than a scratch or so, I reached the  window of which I have spoken, and after a moment spent in regaining my breath,  gave one spring and accomplished my purpose. I alighted upon a heap of broken  glass in a large bare room. An ominous chill at once struck to my heart. Though  I am anything but a sensitive man as far as physical impressions are concerned,  there was something in the hollow echo that arose from the four blank walls  about me as my feet alighted on that rough, uncarpeted floor, that struck a  vague chill through my blood, and I actually hesitated for the moment whether  to pursue the investigations I had promised myself, or beat a hasty retreat. A  glance at the huge distorted limbs swaying across the square of the open window  decided me. It was easy to enter by means of that unsteady support, but it  would be extremely unsafe to venture forth in that way. If I prized life and  limb I must seek some other method of egress. I at once put my apprehensions in  my pocket and entered upon my self imposed task.</p>
  <p>A single glance was sufficient to exhaust the resources  of the empty garret in which I found myself. Two or three old chairs piled in  one corner, a rusty stove or so, a heap of tattered and decaying clothing, were  all that met my gaze. Taking my way, then, at once to the ladder, whose narrow  ends projecting above a hole in the garret floor, seemed to proffer the means  of reaching the rooms below, I proceeded to descend into what to my excited  imagination looked like a gulf of darkness. It proved, however, to be nothing  more nor less than an unlighted hall of small dimensions, with a stair-case at  one end and a door at the other, which, upon opening I found myself in a large,  square room whose immense four-post bedstead entirely denuded of its usual  accompaniments of bed and bolster at once struck my eye and for a moment held  it enchained. There were other articles in the room; a disused bureau, a  rocking chair, even a table, but nothing had such a ghostly look as that  antique bedstead with its curtains of calico tied back over its naked  framework, like rags draped from the bare bones of a skeleton. Passing  hurriedly by, I tried a closet door or so, finding little, however, to reward  my search; and eager to be done with what was every moment becoming more and  more drearisome, I hastened across the floor to the front of the house where I  found another hall and a row of rooms that, while not entirely stripped of  furniture, were yet sufficiently barren to offer little encouragement to my  curiosity. One only, a small but not uncomfortable apartment, showed any signs  of having been occupied within a reasonable length of time; and as I paused  before its hastily spread bed, thrown together as only a man would do it, and  wondering why the room was so dark, looked up and saw that the window was  entirely covered by an old shawl and a couple of heavy coats that had been  hastily nailed across it, I own I felt my hand go to my breast pocket almost as  if I expected to see the wild faces of the dreaded Schoenmakers start up all  aglare from one of the dim corners before me. Rushing to the window, I tore  down with one sweep of my arm both coat and shawl, and with a start discovered  that the window still possessed its draperies in the shape of a pair of  discolored and tattered curtains tied with ribbons that must once have been brilliant  and cheery of color.</p>
  <p>Nor was this the only sign in the room of a bygone  presence that had possessed a taste for something beyond the mere necessities  of life. On the grim coarsely papered wall hung more than one picture; cut from  pictorial newspapers to be sure, but each and every one, if I may be called a  judge of such matters, possessing some quality of expression to commend it to a  certain order of taste. They were all strong pictures. Vivid faces of men and  women in daring positions; a hunter holding back a jaguar from his throat; a  soldier protecting his comrade from the stroke; and most striking of all, a  woman lissome as she was powerful, starting aghast and horror stricken  from&mdash;what? I could not tell; a rough hand had stripped the remainder of the  picture from the wall.</p>
  <p>A bit of candle and a half sheet of a newspaper lay on  the floor. I picked up the paper. It was a <i>Rutland Herald</i> and bore the date of  <i>two days before</i>. As I read I realized what I had done. If these daring robbers  were not at this very moment in the house, they had been there, and that within  two or three days. The broken panes of glass in the garret above were now  explained. I was not the first one who had climbed that creaking pine tree this  fall.</p>
  <p>Something like a sensible dread of a very possible  danger now seized hold of me. If I had stumbled upon these strangely subtile,  yet devilishly bold creatures in their secret lair, the pistol I carried was  not going to save me. Shut in like a fox in a hole, I had little to hope for, if  they once made their appearance at the stairhead or came upon me from any of  the dim halls of the crazy old dwelling, which I now began to find altogether  too large for my comfort. Stealing cautiously forth from the room in which I  had found so much to disconcert me, I crept towards the front staircase and  listened. All was deathly quiet. The old pine tree moaned and twisted without,  and from time to time the wind came sweeping down the chimney with an unearthly  shrieking sound that was weirdly in keeping with the place. But within and  below all was still as the tomb, and though in no ways reassured, I determined  to descend and have the suspense over at once. I did so, pistol in hand and  ears stretched to their utmost to catch the slightest rustle, but no sound came  to disturb me, nor did I meet on this lower floor the sign of any other  presence in the house but my own. Passing hastily through what appeared to be a  sort of rude parlor, I stepped into the kitchen and tried one of the windows.  Finding I could easily lift it from the inside, I drew my breath with ease for  the first time since I had alighted among the broken glass above, and turning  back, deliberately opened the door of the kitchen stove, and looked in. As I  half expected, I found a pile of partly charred rags, showing where the  wretches had burned their prison clothing, and proceeding further, picked up  from the ashes a ring which whether or not they were conscious of having  attempted to destroy in this way I cannot say, but which I thankfully put in my  pocket against the day it might be required as proof.</p>
  <p>Discerning nothing more in that quarter inviting  interest, I asked myself if I had nerve to descend into the cellar. Finally  concluding that that was more than could be expected from any man in my  position, I gave one look of farewell to the damp and desolate walls about me,  then with a breath of relief jumped from the kitchen window again into the  light and air of day. As I did so I could swear I heard a door within that old  house swing on its hinges and softly close. With a thrill I recognized the fact  that it came from the cellar.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>My thoughts on the road back to Melville were many and  conflicting. Chief above them all, however, rose the comfortable conclusion  that in the pursuit of one mysterious affair, I had stumbled, as is often the  case, upon the clue to another of yet greater importance, and by so doing got a  start that might yet redound greatly to my advantage. For the reward offered  for the recapture of the Schoenmakers was large, and the possibility of my  being the one to put the authorities upon their track, certainly appeared after  this day&rsquo;s developements, open at least to a very reasonable hope. At all  events I determined not to let the grass grow under my feet till I had informed  the Superintendent of what I had seen and heard that day in the old haunt of  these two escaped convicts.</p>
  <p>Arrived at the public house in Melville, and learning  that Mr. Blake had safely returned there an hour before, I drew the landlord to  one side and asked what he could tell me about that old house of the two noted  robbers Schoenmaker, I had passed on my way back among the hills.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wa&rsquo;al now,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;this is curious. Here I&rsquo;ve  just been answering the gentleman up stairs a heap of questions concerning that  self same old place, and now you come along with another batch of them; just as  if that rickety old den was the only spot of interest we had in these parts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps that may be the truth,&rdquo; I laughed. &ldquo;Just now  when the papers are full of these rogues, anything concerning <i>them</i> must be of  superior interest of course.&rdquo; And I pressed him again to give me a history of  the house and the two thieves who had inhabited it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wa&rsquo;al,&rdquo; drawled he &ldquo; &lsquo;taint much we know about them,  yet after all it may be a trifle too much for their necks some day. Time was  when nobody thought especial ill of them beyond a suspicion or so of their  being somewhat mean about money. That was when they kept an inn there, but when  the robbery of the Rutland bank was so clearly traced to them, more than one  man about here started up and said as how they had always suspected them  Shoenmakers of being villains, and even hinted at something worse than robbery.  But nothing beyond that one rascality has yet been proved against them, and for  that they were sent to jail for twenty years as you know. Two months ago they  escaped, and that is the last known of them. A precious set, too, they are; the  father being only so much the greater rogue than the son as he is years older.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the inn? When was that closed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just after their arrest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t it been opened since?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only once when a brace of detectives came up from  Troy to investigate, as they called it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who has the key?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s more than I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I dared not ask how my questions differed from those  of Mr. Blake, nor indeed touch upon that point in any way. I was chiefly  anxious now to return to New York without delay; so paying my bill I thanked  the landlord, and without waiting for the stage, remounted my horse and proceeded  at once to Putney where I was fortunate enough to catch the evening train. By  five o&rsquo;clock next morning I was in New York where I proceeded to carry out my  programme by hastening at once to headquarters and reporting my suspicions  regarding the whereabouts of the Schoenmakers. The information was received  with interest and I had the satisfaction of seeing two men despatched north  that very day with orders to procure the arrest of the two notable villains  wherever found.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter08"></a><b>Chapter VIII<br>
    A Word Overheard</b></h2>
  <p>That evening I had a talk with Fanny over the area  gate. She came out when she saw me approach, with her eyes staring and her  whole form in a flutter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;such things as I have heard this day!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what? let me hear too.&rdquo; She put her  hand on her heart. &ldquo;I never was so frightened,&rdquo; whispered she, &ldquo;I thought I  should have fainted right away. To hear that elegant lady use such a word as  crime,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What elegant lady?&rdquo; interrupted I. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t begin in  the middle of your story, that&rsquo;s a good girl; I want to hear it all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she, calming down a little, &ldquo;Mrs. Daniels  had a visitor to-day, a lady. She was dressed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O, now,&rdquo; interrupted I for the second time, &ldquo;you can  leave that out. Tell me what her name was and let the fol-de-rols go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her name?&rdquo; exclaimed the girl with some sharpness, &ldquo;how  should I know her name; she didn&rsquo;t come to see me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How did she look then? You saw her I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And wasn&rsquo;t that what I was telling you, when you  stopped me. She looked like a queen, that she did; as grand a lady as ever I  see, in her velvet dress sweeping over the floor, and her diamonds as big as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was she a dark woman?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her hair was black and so were her eyes, if that is  what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And was she very tall and proud looking?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The girl nodded. &ldquo;You know her?&rdquo; whispered she.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;not exactly; but I think I can tell who  she is. And so she called to-day on Mrs. Daniels, did she.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, but I guess she knew master would be home before  she got away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;tell me all about it; I&rsquo;m getting  impatient.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And ain&rsquo;t I telling you?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;It was about  three o&rsquo;clock this afternoon, the time I go up stairs to dress, so I just hangs  about in the hall a bit, near the parlor door, and I hear her gossiping with  Mrs. Daniels almost as if she was an old friend, and Mrs. Daniels answering her  mighty stiffly and as if she wasn&rsquo;t glad to see her at all. But the lady didn&rsquo;t  seem to mind, but went on talking as sweet as honey, and when they came out,  you would have thought she loved the old woman like a sister to see her look  into her face and say something about knowing how busy she was, but that it  would give her so much pleasure if she would come some day to see her and talk  over old times. But Mrs. Daniels wasn&rsquo;t pleased a bit and showed plain enough  she didn&rsquo;t like the lady, fine as she was in her ways. She was going to answer  her too, but just then the front door opened and Mr. Blake with his satchel in  his hand, came into the house. And how he did start, to be sure, when he saw  them, though he tried to say something perlite which she didn&rsquo;t seem to take to  at all, for after muttering something about not expecting to see <i>him</i>, she put  her hand on the knob and was going right out. But he stopped her and they went  into the parlor together while Mrs. Daniels stood staring after them like one  mad, her hand held out with his bag and umbrella in it, stiff as a statter in  the Central Park. She didn&rsquo;t stand so long, though, but came running down the  hall, as if she was bewitched. I was dreadful flustered, for though I was hid  behind the wall that juts out there by the back stairs, I was afraid she would  see me and shame me before Mr. Blake. But she passed right by and never looked  up. &lsquo;There is something dreadful mysterious in this,&rsquo; thought I, and I just  made up my mind to stay where I was till Mr. Blake and the lady should come out  again from the parlor. I didn&rsquo;t have to wait very long. In a few minutes the  door opened and they stepped out, he ahead and she coming after. I thought this  was queer, he is always so dreadful perlite in his ways, but I thought it was a  deal queerer when I saw him go up the front stairs, she hurrying after, looking  I cannot tell you how, but awful troubled and anxious, I should say.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They went into that room of his he calls his studio  and though I knew it might cost me my place if I was found out, I couldn&rsquo;t help  following and listening at the keyhole.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what did you hear?&rdquo; I asked, for she paused to  take breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, the first thing I heard was a cry of pleasure  from her, and the words, &lsquo;You keep that always before you? You cannot dislike  me, then, as much as you pretend.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t know what she meant nor what he did,  but he stepped across the room and I heard her cry out this time as if she was  hurt as well as awful surprised; and he talked and talked, and I couldn&rsquo;t catch  a word, he spoke so low; and by and by she sobbed just a little, and I got  scared and would have run away but she cried out with a kind of shriek, &lsquo;O, don&rsquo;t  say any more; to think that <i>crime</i> should come into our family, the proudest in  the land. How could you, Holman, how could you.&rsquo; Yes,&rdquo; the girl went on,  flushing in her excitement till she was as red as the cherry ribbons in her  cap, &ldquo;those were the very words she used: &lsquo;To think that crime should come into  our family! the proudest one in the land!&rsquo; And she called him by his first  name, and asked him how he could do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what did Mr. Blake say?&rdquo; returned I, a little  taken back myself at this result of my efforts with Fanny.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O, I didn&rsquo;t wait to hear. I didn&rsquo;t wait for anything.  If folks was going to talk about such things as that, I thought I had better be  anywhere than listening at the keyhole. I went right up stairs I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And whom have you told of what you heard in the half  dozen hours that have gone by?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nobody; how could you think so mean of me when I  promised, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It is not necessary to go any further into this  portion of the interview.</p>
  <p>The Countess De Mirac possessed to its fullest extent  the present fine lady&rsquo;s taste for bric-a-brac. So much I had learned in my  inquiries concerning her. Remembering this, I took the bold resolution of  profiting by this weakness of hers to gain admission to her presence, she being  the only one sharing Mr. Blake&rsquo;s mysterious secret. Borrowing a valuable  antique from a friend of mine at that time in the business, I made my  appearance the very next day at her apartments, and sending in an urgent  request to see Madame, by the trim negress who answered my summons, waited in  some doubt for her reply.</p>
  <p>It came all too soon; Madame was ill and could see no  one. I was not, however, to be baffled by one rebuff. Handing the basket I held  to the girl, I urged her to take it in and show her mistress what it contained,  saying it was a rare article which might never again come her way.</p>
  <p>The girl complied, though with a doubtful shake of the  head which was anything but encouraging. Her incredulity, however, must have  been speedily rebuked, for she almost immediately returned without the basket,  saying Madame would see me.</p>
  <p>My first thoughts upon entering the grand lady&rsquo;s  presence, was that the girl had been mistaken, for I found the Countess walking  the floor in an abstracted way, drying a letter she had evidently but just  completed, by shaking it to and fro with an unsteady hand; the placque I had  brought, lying neglected on the table.</p>
  <p>But at sight of my respectful form standing with bent  head in the doorway, she hurriedly thrust the letter into a book and took up  the placque. As she did so I marked her well and almost started at the change I  observed in her since that evening at the Academy. It was not only that she was  dressed in some sort of loose dishabille that was in eminent contrast to the  sweeping silks and satins in which I had hitherto beheld her adorned; or that  she was laboring under some physical disability that robbed her dark cheek of  the bloom that was its chiefest charm. The change I observed went deeper than  that; it was more as if a light had been extinguished in her countenance. It was  the same woman I had beheld standing like a glowing column of will and strength  before the melancholy form of Mr. Blake, but with the will and strength gone,  and with them all the glow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She no longer hopes,&rdquo; thought I, and already felt  repaid for my trouble.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is a very pretty article you have brought me,&rdquo;  said she with something of the unrestrained love of art which she undoubtedly  possessed, showing itself through all her languor. &ldquo;Where did it come from, and  what recommendations have you, to prove it is an honest sale you offer me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; returned I, ignoring with a reassuring smile  the first question, &ldquo;except that I should not be afraid if all the police in  New York knew I was here with this fine placque for sale.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She gave a shrug of her proud shoulder that bespoke  the French Countess and softly ran her finger round the edge of the placque.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need anything more of this kind,&rdquo; said she  languidly; &ldquo;besides,&rdquo; and she set it down with a fretful air, &ldquo;I am in no mood  to buy this afternoon.&rdquo; Then shortly, &ldquo;What do you ask for it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I named a fabulous price.</p>
  <p>She started and cast me a keen glance. &ldquo;You had better  take it to some one else; I have no money to throw away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With a hesitating hand I lifted the placque towards  the basket. &ldquo;I would very much like to sell it to you,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Just then a lady&rsquo;s fluttering voice rose from the room  beyond inquiring for the Countess, and hurriedly taking the placque from my  hand with an impulsive &ldquo;O there&rsquo;s Amy,&rdquo; she passed into the adjoining apartment,  leaving the door open behind her.</p>
  <p>I saw a quick interchange of greetings between her and  a fashionably dressed lady, then they withdrew to one side with the ornament I  had brought, evidently consulting in regard to its merits. Now was my time. The  book in which she had placed the letter she had been writing lay on the table  right before me, not two inches from my hand. I had only to throw back the  cover and my curiosity would be satisfied. Taking advantage of a moment when  their backs were both turned, I pressed open the book with a careful hand, and  with one eye on them and one on the sheet before me, managed to read these  words:&mdash;</p>
  <p class="letter">My Dearest Cecilia, <br>
  I have tried in vain to match the sample you sent me  at Stewart&rsquo;s, Arnold&rsquo;s and McCreery&rsquo;s. If you still insist upon  making up the dress in the way you propose, I will see what Madame  Dudevant can do for us, though I cannot but advise you to alter  your plans and make the darker shade of velvet do. I went to the Cary  reception last night and met Lulu Chittenden. She has actually  grown old, but was as lively as ever. She created a great stir in  Paris when she was there; but a husband who comes home two o&rsquo;clock  in the morning with bleared eyes and empty pockets, is not  conducive to the preservation of a woman&rsquo;s beauty. How she manages  to retain her spirits I cannot imagine. You ask me news of  cousin Holman. I meet him occasionally and he looks well, but has grown  into the most sombre man you ever saw. In regard to certain  hopes of which you have sometimes made mention, let me assure you  they are no longer practicable. He has done what&mdash;</p>
  <p>Here the conversation ceased in the other room, the  Countess made a movement of advance and I closed the book with an inward groan  over my ill-luck.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is very pretty,&rdquo; said she with a weary air; &ldquo;but  as I remarked before, I am not in the buying mood. If you will take half you  mention, I may consider the subject, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon me, Madame,&rdquo; I interrupted, being in no wise  anxious to leave the placque behind me, &ldquo;I have been considering the matter and  I hold to my original price. Mr. Blake of Second Avenue may give it to me if  you do not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Blake!&rdquo; She eyed me suspiciously. &ldquo;Do you sell to  him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I sell to anyone I can,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;and as he has an  artist&rsquo;s eye for such things&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her brows knitted and she turned away. &ldquo;I do not want  it;&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;sell it to whom you please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I took up the placque and left the room.</p>

    A Few Golden Hairs</b></h2>
  <p>When a few days from that I made my appearance before  Mr. Gryce, it was to find him looking somewhat sober. &ldquo;Those Schoenmakers,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;are making a deal of trouble. It seems they escaped the fellows up  north and are now somewhere in this city, but where&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An expressive gesture finished the sentence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; exclaimed I. &ldquo;Then we are sure to nab  them. Given time and a pair of low, restless German thieves, I will wager  anything, our hands will be upon them before the month is over. I only hope,  when we do come across them, it will not be to find their betters too much  mixed up with their devilish practices.&rdquo; And I related to him what Fanny had  told me a few evenings before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The coil is tightening,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What the end will  be I don&rsquo;t know. <i>Crime</i>, said she? I wish I knew in what blind hole of the earth  that girl we are after lies hidden.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As if in answer to this wish the door opened and one  of our men came in with a letter in his hand. &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Gryce, after  he had perused it, &ldquo;look at that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I took the letter from his hand and read:</p>
  <p class="letter">The dead body of a girl such as you describe was found  in the East river off Fiftieth Street this morning. From  appearance has been dead some time. Have telegraphed to Police  Headquarters for orders. Should you wish to see the body before it is  removed to the Morgue or otherwise disturbed, please hasten to  Pier 48 E. R.<br>
  Graham.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go and see for ourselves. If it  should be the one&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The dinner party proposed by Mr. Blake for to-night,  may have its interruptions,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
  <p>I do not wish to make my story any longer than is necessary,  but I must say that when in an hour or so later, I stood with Mr. Gryce before  the unconscious form of that poor drowned girl I felt an unusual degree of awe  stealing over me: there was so much mystery connected with this affair, and the  parties implicated were of such standing and repute.</p>
  <p>I almost dreaded to see the covering removed from her  face lest I should behold, what? I could not have told if I had tried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A trim made body enough,&rdquo; cried the official in  charge as Mr. Gryce lifted an end of the cloth that enveloped her and threw it  back. &ldquo;Pity the features are not better preserved.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No need for us to see the features,&rdquo; exclaimed I,  pointing to the locks of golden red hair that hung in tangled masses about her.  &ldquo;The hair is enough; she is not the one.&rdquo; And I turned aside, asking myself if  it was relief I felt.</p>
  <p>To my surprise Mr. Gryce did not follow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tall, thin, white face, black eyes.&rdquo; I heard him  whisper to himself. &ldquo;It is a pity the features are not better preserved.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, taking him by the arm, &ldquo;Fanny spoke  particularly of her hair being black, while this girl&rsquo;s&mdash;Good heavens!&rdquo; I  suddenly ejaculated as I looked again at the prostrate form before me. &ldquo;Yellow  hair or black, this is the girl I saw him speaking to that day in Broome Street.  I remember her clothes if nothing more.&rdquo; And opening my pocketbook, I took out  the morsel of cloth I had plucked that day from the ash barrel, lifted up the  discolored rags that hung about the body and compared the two. The pattern,  texture and color were the same.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Gryce, pointing to certain  contusions, like marks from the blow of some heavy instrument on the head and  bared arms of the girl before us; &ldquo;he will have to answer me one question  anyhow, and that is, who this poor creature is who lies here the victim of  treachery or despair.&rdquo; And turning to the official he asked if there were any  other signs of violence on the body.</p>
  <p>The answer came deliberately, &ldquo;Yes, she has evidently  been battered to death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s lips closed with grim decision. &ldquo;A most  brutal murder,&rdquo; said he and lifting up the cloth with a hand that visibly  trembled, he softly covered her face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I as we slowly paced back up the pier, &ldquo;there  is one thing certain, she is not the one who disappeared from Mr. Blake&rsquo;s  house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not so sure of that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;You believed Fanny lied when she gave  that description of the missing girl upon which we have gone till now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Gryce smiled, and turning back, beckoned to the  official behind us. &ldquo;Let me have that description,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;which I  distributed among the Harbor Police some days ago for the identification of a  certain corpse I was on the lookout for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man opened his coat and drew out a printed paper  which at Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s word he put into my hand. It ran as follows:</p>
  <p class="letter">Look out for the body of a young girl, tall, well  shaped but thin, of fair complexion and golden hair of a peculiar  bright and beautiful color, and when found, acquaint me at once.<br>
  G.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; began I.</p>
  <p>But Mr. Gryce tapping me on the arm said in his most  deliberate tones, &ldquo;Next time you examine a room in which anything of a  mysterious nature has occurred, look under the bureau and if you find a comb  there with several long golden hairs tangled in it, be very sure before you  draw any definite conclusions, that your Fannys know what they are talking  about when they declare the girl who used that comb had black hair on her head.&rdquo;</p>

    The Secret Of Mr. Blake&rsquo;s Studio</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Blake is at dinner, sir, with company, but I will  call him if you say so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Mr. Gryce; &ldquo;show us into some room  where we can be comfortable and we will wait till he has finished.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The servant bowed, and stepping forward down the hall,  opened the door of a small and cosy room heavily hung with crimson curtains. &ldquo;I  will let him know that you are here,&rdquo; said he, and vanished towards the  dining-room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I doubt if Mr. Blake will enjoy the latter half of  his bill of fare as much as the first,&rdquo; said I, drawing up one of the luxurious  arm-chairs to the side of my principal. &ldquo;I wonder if he will break away from  his guests and come in here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; if I am not mistaken we shall find Mr. Blake a  man of nerve. Not a muscle of his face will show that he is disturbed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I dread it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Gryce looked about on the gorgeous walls and the  rich old fashioned furniture that surrounded him, and smiled one of his  grimmest smiles.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you may,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>The next instant a servant stood in the doorway,  bearing to our great astonishment, a tray well set with decanter and glasses.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Blake&rsquo;s compliments, gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, setting  it down on the table before us. &ldquo;He hopes you will make yourselves at home and  he will see you as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The <i>humph!</i> of Mr. Gryce when the servant had gone  would have done your soul good, also the look he cast at the pretty Dresden  Shepherdess on the mantel-piece, as I reached out my hand towards the decanter.  Somehow it made me draw back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think we had better leave his wine alone,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>And for half an hour we sat there, the wine untouched  between us, listening alternately to the sound of speech-making and laughter  that came from the dining-room, and the solemn ticking of the clock as it  counted out the seconds on the mantel-piece. Then the guests came in from the  table, filing before us past the open door on their way to the parlors. They  were all gentlemen of course&mdash;Mr. Blake never invited ladies to his house&mdash;and  gentlemen of well known repute. The dinner had been given in honor of a certain  celebrated statesman, and the character of his guests was in keeping with that  of the one thus complimented.</p>
  <p>As they went by us gaily indulging in the jokes and  light banter with which such men season a social dinner, I saw Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s face  grow sober by many a shade; and when in the midst of it all, we heard the voice  of Mr. Blake rise in that courteous and measured tone for which it is  distinguished, I saw him reach forward and grasp his cane with an uneasiness I  had never seen displayed by him before. But when some time later, the guests  having departed, the dignified host advanced with some apology to where we  were, I never beheld a firmer look on Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s face than that with which he  rose and confronted him. Mr. Blake&rsquo;s own had not more character in it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have called at a rather inauspicious time, Mr.  Gryce,&rdquo; said the latter, glancing at the card which he held in his hand. &ldquo;What  may your business be? Something to do with politics, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I surveyed the man in amazement. Was this great  politician stooping to act a part, or had he forgotten our physiognomies as  completely as appeared?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Our business is not politics,&rdquo; replied Mr. Gryce; &ldquo;but  fully as important. May I request the doors be closed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I thought Mr. Blake looked surprised, but he  immediately stepped to the door and shut it. Then coming back, he looked at Mr.  Gryce more closely and a change took place in his manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think I have seen you before,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>Mr. Gryce bowed with just the suspicion of a smile. &ldquo;I  have had the honor of consulting you before in this very house,&rdquo; observed he.</p>
  <p>A look of full recognition passed over the dignified  countenance of the man before us.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said he, shrugging his shoulders in the  old way. &ldquo;You are interested in some servant girl or other who ran away from  this house a week or so ago. Have you found her?&rdquo; This with no apparent  concern.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We think we have,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Gryce with some  solemnity. &ldquo;The river gives up its prey now and then, Mr. Blake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Still only that look of natural surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed! You do not mean to say she has drowned  herself? I am sorry for that, a girl who had once lived in my house. What  trouble could she have had to drive her to such an act?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Gryce advanced a step nearer the gentleman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is what we have come here to learn,&rdquo; said he  with a deliberation that yet was not lacking in the respect due to a man so  universally esteemed as Mr. Blake. &ldquo;You who have seen her so lately ought to be  able to throw some light upon the subject at least.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.&mdash;&rdquo; he again glanced at the card, &ldquo;Mr. Gryce,&mdash;excuse  me&mdash;I believe I told you when you were here before that I had no remembrance of  this girl at all. That if such a person was in my house I did not know it, and  that all questions put to me on that subject would be so much labor thrown  away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Gryce bowed. &ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I was not  alluding to any connection you may have had with the girl in this house, but to  the interview you were seen to have with her on the corner of Broome Street  some days ago. You had such an interview, did you not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A flush, deep as it was sudden, swept over Mr. Blake&rsquo;s  usually unmoved cheek. &ldquo;You are transgressing sir,&rdquo; said he and stopped. Though  a man of intense personal pride, he had but little of that quality called  temper, or perhaps if he had, thought it unwise to display it on this occasion.  &ldquo;I saw and spoke to a girl on the corner of that street some days ago,&rdquo; he went  on more mildly, &ldquo;but that she was the one who lived here, I neither knew at the  time nor feel willing to believe now without positive proof.&rdquo; Then in a deep  ringing tone the stateliness of which it would be impossible to describe, he  inquired, &ldquo;Have the city authorities presumed to put a spy on my movements,  that the fact of my speaking to a poor forsaken creature on the corner of the  street should be not only noted but remembered?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Blake,&rdquo; observed Mr. Gryce, and I declare I was  proud of my superior at that moment, &ldquo;no man who is a true citizen and a  Christian should object to have his steps followed, when by his own  thoughtlessness, perhaps, he has incurred a suspicion which demands it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And do you mean to say that I have been followed,&rdquo;  inquired he, clenching his hand and looking steadily, but with a blanching  cheek, first at Mr. Gryce then at me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was indispensable,&rdquo; quoth that functionary gently.</p>
  <p>The outraged gentleman riveted his gaze upon me. &ldquo;In  town and out of town?&rdquo; demanded he.</p>
  <p>I let Mr. Gryce reply. &ldquo;It is known that you have  lately sought to visit the Schoenmakers,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>Mr. Blake drew a deep breath, cast his eyes about the  handsome apartment in which we were, let them rest for a moment upon a portrait  that graced one side of the wall, and which was I have since learned a picture  of his father, and slowly drew forward a chair. &ldquo;Let me hear what your  suspicions are,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>I noticed Mr. Gryce colored at this; he had evidently  been met in a different way from what he expected. &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I do  not say <i>I</i> have any suspicions; my errand is simply to notify you of the death  of the girl you were seen to speak with, and to ask whether or not you can give  us any information that can aid us in the matter before the coroner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know I have not. If I have been as closely  followed as you say, you must know why I spoke to that girl and others, why I  went to the house of the Schoenmakers and&mdash;Do you know?&rdquo; he suddenly inquired.</p>
  <p>Mr. Gryce was not the man to answer such a question as  that. He eyed the rich signet ring that adorned the hand of the gentleman  before him and suavely smiled. &ldquo;I am ready to listen to any explanations,&rdquo; said  he.</p>
  <p>Mr. Blake&rsquo;s haughty countenance became almost stern. &ldquo;You  consider you have a right to demand them; let me hear why.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Gryce with a change of tone, &ldquo;you  shall. Unprofessional as it is, I will tell you why I, a member of the police  force, dare enter the house of such a man as you are, and put him the questions  I have concerning his domestic affairs. Mr. Blake, imagine yourself in a  detective&rsquo;s office. A woman comes in, the housekeeper of a respected citizen,  and informs us that a girl employed by her as seamstress has disappeared in a  very unaccountable way from her master&rsquo;s house the night before; in fact been  abducted as she thinks from certain evidences, through the window. Her manner  is agitated, her appeal for assistance urgent, though she acknowledges no  relationship to the girl or expresses any especial cause for her interest  beyond that of common humanity. &lsquo;She must be found,&rsquo; she declares, and hints  that any sum necessary will be forthcoming, though from what source after her  own pittance is expended she does not state. When asked if her master has no  interest in the matter, she changes color and puts us off. He never noticed his  servants, left all such concerns to her, etc.; but shows fear when a  proposition is made to consult him. Next imagine yourself with the detectives  in that gentleman&rsquo;s house. You enter the girl&rsquo;s room; what is the first thing  you observe? Why that it is not only one of the best in the house, but that it  is conspicuous for its comforts if not for its elegancies. More than that, that  there are books of poetry and history lying around, showing that the woman who  inhabited it was above her station; a fact which the housekeeper is presently  brought to acknowledge. You notice also that the wild surmise of her abduction  by means of the window, has some ground in appearance, though the fact that she  went with entire unwillingness is not made so apparent. The housekeeper,  however, insists in a way that must have had some special knowledge of the girl&rsquo;s  character or circumstances to back it, that she never went without compulsion;  a statement which the torn curtains and the track of blood over the roof of the  extension, would seem to emphasize. A few other facts are made known. First, a  pen-knife is picked up from the grass plot in the yard beneath, showing with  what instrument the wound was inflicted, whose drippings made those marks of  blood alluded to. It was a pearl-handled knife belonging to the writing desk  found open on her table, and its frail and dainty character proved  indisputably, that it was employed by the girl herself, and that against  manifest enemies; no man being likely to snatch up any such puny weapon for the  purpose either of offence or defence. That these enemies were two and were both  men, was insisted upon by Mrs. Daniels who overheard their voices the night  before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Blake, such facts as these arouse curiosity,  especially when the master of the house being introduced upon the scene, <i>he</i>  fails to manifest common human interest, while his housekeeper betrays in every  involuntary gesture and expression she makes use of, her horror if not her fear  of his presence, and her relief at his departure. Yes,&rdquo; he exclaimed, unheeding  the sudden look here cast him by Mr. Blake, &ldquo;and curiosity begets inquiry, and  inquiry elucidated further facts such as these, that the mysterious master of  the house was in his garden at the hour of the girl&rsquo;s departure, was even  looking through the bars of his gate when she, having evidently escaped from  her captors, came back with every apparent desire to reenter her home, but  seeing him, betrayed an unreasonable amount of fear and fled back even into the  very arms of the men she had endeavored to avoid. Did you speak sir?&rdquo; asked Mr.  Gryce suddenly stopping, with a sly look at his left boot tip.</p>
  <p>Mr. Blake shook his head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he shortly, &ldquo;go  on.&rdquo; But that last remark of Mr. Gryce had evidently made its impression.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Inquiry revealed, also, two or three other  interesting facts. First, that this gentleman qualified though he was to shine  in ladies&rsquo; society, never obtruded himself there, but employed his leisure time  instead, in walking the lower streets of the city, where he was seen more than  once conversing with certain poor girls at street corners and in blind alleys. The  last one he talked with, believed from her characteristics to be the same one  that was abducted from his house&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold there,&rdquo; said Mr. Blake with some authority in  his tone, &ldquo;there you are mistaken; that is impossible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, and why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The girl you allude to had bright golden hair,  something which the woman who lived in my house did not possess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed. I thought you had never noticed the woman who  sewed for you, sir,&mdash;did not know how she looked?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I should have noticed her if she had had such hair as  the girl you speak of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Gryce smiled and opened his pocketbook.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is a sample of her hair, sir,&rdquo; said he, taking  out a thin strand of brilliant hair and showing it to the gentleman before him.  &ldquo;Bright you see, and golden as that of the unfortunate creature you talked with  the other night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Blake stooped forward and lifted it with a hand  that visibly trembled. &ldquo;Where did you get this?&rdquo; asked he at last, clenching it  to his breast with sudden passion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From out of the comb which the girl had been using  the night before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The imperious man flung it hastily from him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We waste our time,&rdquo; said he, looking Mr. Gryce  intently in the face. &ldquo;All that you have said does not account for your  presence here nor the tone you have used while addressing me. What are you  keeping back? I am not a man to be trifled with.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Gryce rose to his feet. &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said he,  and he gave a short glance in my direction. &ldquo;All that I have said would not  perhaps justify me in this intrusion, if&mdash;&rdquo; he looked again towards me. &ldquo;Do you  wish me to continue?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>Mr. Blake&rsquo;s intent look deepened. &ldquo;I see no reason why  you should not utter the whole,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;A good story loses nothing by being  told to the end. You wish to say something about my journey to Schoenmaker&rsquo;s  house, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Gryce gravely shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What, you can let such a mystery as that go without a  word?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not here to discuss mysteries that have no  connection with the sewing-girl in whose cause I am interested.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Mr. Blake, turning for the first time  upon my superior with all the dignified composure for which he was eminent, &ldquo;it  is no longer necessary for us to prolong this interview. I have allowed, nay  encouraged you to state in the plainest terms what it was you had or imagined  you had against me, knowing that my actions of late, seen by those who did not  possess the key to them, must have seemed a little peculiar. But when you say  you have no interest in any mystery disconnected with the girl who has lived  the last few months in my house, I can with assurance say that it is time we  quitted this unprofitable conversation, as nothing which I have lately done,  said or thought here or elsewhere has in any way had even the remotest bearing  upon that individual; she having been a stranger to me while in my house, and  quite forgotten by me, after her unaccountable departure hence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s hand which had been stretched out towards  the hitherto untouched decanter before him, suddenly dropped. &ldquo;You deny then,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;all connection between yourself and the woman, lady or sewing-girl,  who occupied that room above our heads for eleven months previous to the Sunday  morning I first had the honor to make your acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not in the habit of repeating my assertions,&rdquo;  said Mr. Blake with some severity, &ldquo;even when they relate to a less  disagreeable matter than the one under discussion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Gryce bowed, and slowly reached out for his hat; I  had never seen him so disturbed. &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he began and stopped, fingering  his hat-brim nervously. Suddenly he laid his hat back, and drew up his form  into as near a semblance of dignity as its portliness would allow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Blake,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have too much respect for the  man I believed you to be when I entered this house to-night, to go with the  thing unsaid which is lying at present like a dead weight upon my lips. I dare  not leave you to the consequence of my silence; for duty will compel me to  speak some day and in some presence where you may not have the opportunity  which you can have here, to explain yourself with satisfaction. Mr. Blake I  cannot believe you when you say the girl who lived in this house was a stranger  to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Blake drew his proud form up in a disdain that was  only held in check by the very evident honesty of the man before him. &ldquo;You are  courageous at least,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I regret you are not equally discriminating.&rdquo;  And raising Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s hat he placed it in his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said that gentleman, &ldquo;I would like to  justify myself before I go. Not with words,&rdquo; he proceeded as the other folded  his arms with a sarcastic bow. &ldquo;I am done with words; action accomplishes the  rest. Mr. Blake I believe you consider me an honest officer and a reliable man.  Will you accompany me to your private room for a moment? There is something  there which may convince you I was neither playing the fool nor the bravado  when I uttered the phrase I did an instant ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I expected to hear the haughty master of the house  refuse a request so peculiar. But he only bowed, though in a surprised way that  showed his curiosity if no more was aroused. &ldquo;My room and company are at your  disposal,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but you will find nothing there to justify you in your  assertions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me at least make the effort,&rdquo; entreated my  superior.</p>
  <p>Mr. Blake smiling bitterly immediately led the way to  the door. &ldquo;The man may come,&rdquo; he remarked carelessly as Mr. Gryce waved his  hand in my direction. &ldquo;Your justification if not mine may need witnesses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rejoiced at the permission, for my curiosity was by  this time raised to fever pitch, I at once followed. Not without anxiety. The  assured poise of Mr. Blake&rsquo;s head seemed to argue that the confidence betrayed  by my superior might receive a shock; and I felt it would be a serious blow to  his pride to fail now. But once within the room above, my doubts speedily fled.  There was that in Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s face which anyone acquainted with him could not  easily mistake. Whatever might be the mysterious something which the room  contained, it was evidently sufficient in his eyes to justify his whole  conduct.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Blake, turning upon my superior  with his sternest expression, &ldquo;the room and its contents are before you; what  have you to say for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Gryce equally stern, if not equally composed, cast  one of his inscrutable glances round the apartment and without a word stepped  before the picture that was as I have said, the only ornamentation of the  otherwise bare and unattractive room.</p>
  <p>I thought Mr. Blake looked surprised, but his face was  not one that lightly expressed emotion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A portrait of my cousin the Countess De Mirac,&rdquo; said  he with a certain dryness of tone hard to interpret.</p>
  <p>Mr. Gryce bowed and for a moment stood looking with a  strange lack of interest at the proudly brilliant face of the painting before  him, then to our great amazement stepped forward and with a quick gesture  turned the picture rapidly to the wall, when&mdash;Gracious heavens! what a vision  started out before us from the reverse side of that painted canvas! No  luxurious brunette countenance now, steeped in pride and languor, but a  face&mdash;Let me see if I can describe it. But no, it was one of those faces that  are indescribable. You draw your breath as you view it; you feel as if you had  had an electric shock; but as for knowing ten minutes later whether the eyes  that so enthralled you were blue or black, or the locks that clustered  halo-like about a forehead almost awful in its expression of weird,  unfathomable power, were brown or red, you could not nor would you pretend to  say. It was the character of the countenance itself that impressed you. You did  not even know if this woman who might have been anything wonderful or grand you  ever read of, were beautiful or not. You did not care; it was as if you had  been gazing on a tranquil evening sky and a lightning flash had suddenly  startled you. Is the lightning beautiful? Who asks! But I know from what  presently transpired, that the face was ivory pale in complexion, the eyes  deeply dark, and the hair,&mdash;strange and uncanny combination,&mdash;of a bright and  peculiar golden hue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You dare!&rdquo; came forth in strange broken tones from  Mr. Blake&rsquo;s lips.</p>
  <p>I instantly turned towards him. He was gazing with a  look that was half indignant, half menacing at the silent detective who with  eyes drooped and finger directed towards the picture, seemed to be waiting for  him to finish.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not understand an audacity that allows you  to&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo; Was this the haughty gentleman we had known, this hesitating troubled  man with bloodless lips and trembling hands?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I declared my desire to justify myself,&rdquo; said my  principal with a respectful bow. &ldquo;This is my justification. Do you note the  color of the woman&rsquo;s hair whose portrait hangs with its face turned to the wall  in your room? Is it like or unlike that of the strand you held in your hand a  few moments ago; a strand taken as I swear, hair by hair from the comb of the  poor creature who occupied the room above. But that is not all,&rdquo; he continued  as Mr. Blake fell a trifle aback; &ldquo;just observe the dress in which this woman  is painted; blue silk you see, dark and rich; a wide collar cunningly executed,  you can almost trace the pattern; a brooch; then the roses in the hand, do you  see? Now come with me upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Too much startled to speak, Mr. Blake, haughty  aristocrat as he was, turned like a little child and followed the detective who  with an assured step and unembarassed mien led the way into the deserted room  above.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You accuse me of insulting you, when I express  disbelief of your assertion that there was no connection between you and the  girl Emily,&rdquo; said Mr. Gryce as he lit the gas and unlocked that famous bureau  drawer. &ldquo;Will you do so any longer in face of these?&rdquo; And drawing off the towel  that lay uppermost, he revealed the neatly folded dress, wide collar, brooch  and faded roses that lay beneath. &ldquo;Mrs. Daniels assures us these articles  belonged to the sewing-woman Emily; were brought here by her. Dare you say they  are not the ones reproduced in the portrait below?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Blake uttering a cry sank on his knees before the  drawer. &ldquo;My God! My God!&rdquo; was his only reply, &ldquo;what are these?&rdquo; Suddenly he  rose, his whole form quivering, his eyes burning. &ldquo;Where is Mrs. Daniels?&rdquo; he  cried, hastily advancing and pulling the bell. &ldquo;I must see her at once. Send  the house-keeper here,&rdquo; he ordered as Fanny smiling demurely made her  appearance at the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Daniels is out,&rdquo; returned the girl, &ldquo;went out as  soon as ever you got up from dinner, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gone out at this hour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes sir; she goes out very often nowadays, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her master frowned. &ldquo;Send her to me as soon as she  returns,&rdquo; he commanded, and dismissed the girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to make of this,&rdquo; he now said in a  strange tone, approaching again the touching contents of that open bureau  drawer with a look in which longing and doubt seemed in some way to be strangely  commingled. &ldquo;I cannot explain the presence of these articles in this room; but  if you will come below I will see what I can do to make other matters  intelligible to you. Disagreeable as it is for me to take anyone into my  confidence, affairs have gone too far for me to hope any longer to preserve  secrecy as to my private concerns.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2><a name="Chapter11"></a><b>Chapter XI<br>
    Luttra</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said he as he ushered us once more into  his studio, &ldquo;you have presumed, and not without reason I should say, to infer  that the original of this portrait and the woman who has so long occupied the  position of sewing-woman in my house, are one and the same. You will no longer  retain that opinion when I inform you that this picture, strange as it may  appear to you, is the likeness of my wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wife!&rdquo; We both were astonished as I take it, but it  was my voice which spoke. &ldquo;We were ignorant you ever had a wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; continued our host smiling bitterly, &ldquo;that  at least has evaded the knowledge even of the detectives.&rdquo; Then with a return  to his naturally courteous manner, &ldquo;She was never acknowledged by me as my  wife, nor have we ever lived together, but if priestly benediction can make a  man and woman one, that woman as you see her there is my lawful wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rising, he softly turned the lovely, potent face back  to the wall, leaving us once more confronted by the dark and glowing  countenance of his cousin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am not called upon,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to go any further  with you than this. I have told you what no man till this hour has ever heard  from my lips, and it should serve to exonerate me from any unjust suspicions  you may have entertained. But to one of my temperament, secret scandal and the  gossip it engenders is only less painful than open notoriety. If I leave the  subject here, a thousand conjectures will at once seize upon you, and my name  if not hers will become, before I know it, the football of gossip if not of  worse and deeper suspicion than has yet assailed me. Gentleman I take you to be  honest men; husbands, perhaps, and fathers; proud, too, in your way and jealous  of your own reputation and that of those with whom you are connected. If I  succeed in convincing you that my movements of late have been totally  disconnected with the girl whose cause you profess solely to be interested in,  may I count upon your silence as regards those actions and the real motive that  led to them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You may count upon my discretion as regards all  matters that do not come under the scope of police duty,&rdquo; returned Mr. Gryce. &ldquo;I  haven&rsquo;t much time for gossip.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And your man here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O, he&rsquo;s safe where it profits him to be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well, then, I shall count upon you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And with the knitted brows and clinched hands of a  proudly reticent man who, perhaps for the first time in his life finds himself  forced to reveal his inner nature to the world, he began his story in these  words:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Difficult as it is for me to introduce into a  relation like this the name of my father, I shall be obliged to do so in order  to make my conduct at a momentous crisis of my life intelligible to you. My  father, then, was a man of strong will and a few but determined prejudices.  Resolved that I should sustain the reputation of the family for wealth and  respectability, he gave me to understand from my earliest years, that as long  as I preserved my manhood from reproach, I had only to make my wishes known, to  have them immediately gratified; while if I crossed his will either by  indulging in dissipation or engaging in pursuits unworthy of my name, I no  longer need expect the favor of his countenance or the assistance of his purse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When, therefore, at a certain period of my life, I  found that the charms of my cousin Evelyn were making rather too strong an  impression upon my fancy for a secured peace of mind, I first inquired how such  a union would affect my father, and learning that it would be in direct  opposition to his views, cast about in my mind what I should do to overcome my  passion. Travel suggested itself, and I took a trip to Europe. But the sight of  new faces only awakened in me comparisons anything but detrimental to the  beauty of her who was at that time my standard of feminine loveliness. Nature  and the sports connected with a wild life were my next resort. I went overland  to California, roamed the orange groves of Florida, and probed the wildernesses  of Canada and our Northern states. It was during these last excursions that an  event occurred which has exercised the most material influence upon my fate,  though at the time it seemed to me no more than the matter of a day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had just returned from Canada and was resting in  tolerable enjoyment of a very beautiful autumn at Lake George, when a letter  reached me from a friend then loitering in the vicinity, urging me to join him  in a certain small town in Vermont where trout streams abounded and what is not  so often the case under the circumstances, fishers were few.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Being in a somewhat reckless mood I at once wrote a  consent, and before another day was over, started for the remote village whence  his letter was postmarked. I found it by no means easy of access. Situated in  the midst of hills some twenty miles or so distant from any railroad, I  discovered that in order to reach it, a long ride in a stage-coach was  necessary, followed by a somewhat shorter journey on horseback. Not being  acquainted with the route, I timed my connections wrong, so that when evening  came I found myself riding over a strange road in the darkest night I had ever  known. As if this was not enough, my horse suddenly began to limp and presently  became so lame I found it impossible to urge her beyond a slow walk. It was  therefore with no ordinary satisfaction that I presently beheld a lighted  building in the distance, which as I approached resolved itself into an inn.  Stopping in front of the house, which was closed against the chill night air, I  called out lustily for someone to take my horse, whereupon the door opened and  a man appeared on the threshold with a lantern in his hand. I at once made my  wishes known, receiving in turn a somewhat gruff,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well it is a nasty night and it will be nastier  before it&rsquo;s over;&rsquo; an opinion instantly endorsed by a sudden swoop of wind that  rushed by at that moment, slamming the door behind him and awakening over my  head a lugubrious groaning as from the twisting boughs of some old tree, that  was almost threatening in its character.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You had better go in,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;the rain will come  next.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I at once leaped from my horse and pushing open the  door with main strength, entered the house. Another man met me on the threshold  who merely pointing over his shoulder to a lighted room in his rear, passed out  without a word, to help the somewhat younger man, who had first appeared, in  putting up my horse. I at once accepted his silent invitation and stepped into  the room before me. Instantly I found myself confronted by the rather startling  vision of a young girl of a unique and haunting style of beauty, who rising at  my approach now stood with her eyes on my face and her hands resting on the  deal table before which she had been sitting, in an attitude expressive of mingled  surprise and alarm. To see a woman in that place was not so strange; but such a  woman! Even in the first casual glance I gave her, I at once acknowledged to  myself her extraordinary power. Not the slightness of her form, the palor of  her countenance, or the fairness of the locks of golden red hair that fell in  two long braids over her bosom, could for a moment counteract the effect of her  dark glance or the vivid almost unearthly force of her expression. It was as if  you saw a flame upstarting before you, waving tremulously here and there, but  burning and resistless in its white heat. I took off my hat with deference.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A shudder passed over her, but she made no effort to  return my acknowledgement. As we cast our eyes dilating with horror, down some  horrible pit upon whose verge we suddenly find ourselves, she allowed her gaze  for a moment to dwell upon my face, then with a sudden lifting of her hand,  pointed towards the door as if to bid me depart&mdash;when it swung open with that  shrill rushing of wind that involuntarily awakes a shudder within you, and the  two men entered and came stamping up to my side. Instantly her hand sunk, not  feebly as with fear, but calmly as if at the bidding of her will, and without  waiting for them to speak, she turned away and quietly left the room. As the  door closed upon her I noticed that she wore a calico frock and that her face  did not own one perfect feature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go after Luttra and tell her to make up the bed in  the northwest room,&rsquo; said the elder of the two in deep gutteral tones  unmistakably German in their accent, to the other who stood shaking the wet off  his coat into the leaping flames of a small wood fire that burned on the hearth  before us.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O, she&rsquo;ll do without my bothering,&rsquo; was the sullen  return. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m wet through.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The elder man, a large powerfully framed fellow of  some fifty years or so, frowned. It was an evil frown, and the younger one  seemed to feel it. He immediately tossed his coat onto a chair and left the  room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Boys are so obstropolous now-a-days,&rsquo; remarked his  companion to me with what he evidently intended for a conciliatory nod. &lsquo;In my  time they were broke in, did what they were told and asked no questions.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I smiled to myself at his calling the broad  shouldered six-footer who had just left us a boy, but merely remarking, &lsquo;He is  your son is he not!&rsquo; seated myself before the blaze which shot up a tongue of  white flame at my approach, that irresistibly recalled to my fancy the  appearance of the girl who had gone out a moment before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O, yes, he is my son, and that girl you saw here was  my daughter; I keep this inn and they help me, but it is a slow way to live, I  can tell you. Travel on these roads is slim.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I should think likely,&rsquo; I returned, remembering the  half dozen or so hills up which I had clambered since I took to my horse. &lsquo;How  far are we from Pentonville?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O, two or three miles,&rsquo; he replied, but in a hurried  kind of a way. &lsquo;Not far in the daytime but a regular journey in a night like  this?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I, as the house shook under a fresh gust;  &lsquo;it is fortunate I have a place in which to put up.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He glanced down at my baggage which consisted of a  small hand bag, an over-coat and a fishing pole, with something like a gleam of  disappointment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Going fishing?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I returned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good trout up those streams and plenty of them,&rsquo; he  went on. &lsquo;Going alone?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did not half like his importunity, but considering  I had nothing better to do, replied as affably as possible. &lsquo;No, I expect to  meet a friend in Pentonville who will accompany me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His hand went to his beard in a thoughtful attitude  and he cast me what, with my increased experience of the world, I should now  consider a sinister glance. &lsquo;Then you are expected?&rsquo; said he.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not considering this worth reply, I stretched out my  feet to the blaze and began to warm them, for I felt chilled through.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Been on the road long?&rsquo; he now asked, glancing at  the blue flannel suit I wore.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All summer,&rsquo; I returned,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I again thought he looked disappointed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;From Troy or New York?&rsquo; he went on with a vague  endeavor to appear good naturally off hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;New York.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A big place that,&rsquo; he continued. &lsquo;I was there once,  lots of money stored away in them big buildings down in Wall Street, eh?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I assented, and he drew a chair up to my side, a  proceeding that was interrupted, however, by the reentrance of his son, who  without any apology crowded into the other side of the fire-place in a way to  sandwich me between them. Not fancying this arrangement which I, however,  imputed to ignorance, I drew back and asked if my room was ready. It seemed it  was not, and unpleasantly as it promised, I felt forced to reseat myself and  join in, if not support, the conversation that followed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A half hour passed away, during which the wind  increased till it almost amounted to a gale. Spurts of rain dashed against the  windows with a sharp crackling sound that suggested hail, while ever and anon a  distant roll as of rousing thunder, rumbled away among the hills in a long and  reverberating peal, that made me feel glad to be housed even under the roof of  these rude and uncongenial creatures. Suddenly the conversation turned upon the  time and time-pieces, when in a low even tone I heard murmured behind me,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The gentleman&rsquo;s room is ready;&rsquo; and turning, I saw  standing in the doorway the slight figure of the young girl whose appearance  had previously so impressed me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I immediately arose. &lsquo;Then I will proceed to it at  once,&rsquo; said I, taking up my traps and advancing towards her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do not be alarmed if you hear creaks and cracklings  all over the house,&rsquo; observed the landlord as I departed. &lsquo;The windows are  loose and the doors ill-fitting. In such a storm as this they make noise enough  to keep an army awake. The house is safe enough though and if you don&rsquo;t mind  noise&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O I don&rsquo;t mind noise,&rsquo; rejoined I, feeling at that  moment tired enough to fall into a doze on the staircase. &lsquo;I shall sleep, never  fear,&rsquo; and without further ado followed the girl upstairs into a large clumsily  furnished room whose enormous bed draped with heavy curtains at once attracted  my attention.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O I cannot sleep under those things,&rsquo; remarked I,  with a gesture towards the dismal draperies which to me were another name for  suffocation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With a single arm-sweep she threw them back. &lsquo;Is  there anything more I can do for you?&rsquo; asked she, glancing hastily about the  room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thanked her and said &lsquo;no,&rsquo; at which she at once  departed with a look of still determination upon her countenance that I found  it hard to explain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Left alone in that large, bare and dimly lighted  room, with the wind shrieking in the chimney and the powerful limbs of some  huge tree beating against the walls without, with a heavy thud inexpressibly  mournful, I found to my surprise and something like dismay, that the sleepiness  which had hitherto oppressed me, had in some unaccountable way entirely fled.  In vain I contemplated the bed, comfortable enough now in its appearance that  the stifling curtains were withdrawn; no temptation to invade it came to arouse  me from the chair into which I had thrown myself. It was as if I felt myself  under the spell of some invisible influence that like the eye of a basilisk,  held me enchained. I remember turning my head towards a certain quarter of the  wall as if I half expected to encounter there the bewildering glance of a  serpent. Yet far from being apprehensive of any danger, I only wondered over  the weakness of mind that made such fancies possible.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An extra loud swirl of the foliage without,  accompanied by a quick vibration of the house, aroused me at last. If I was to  lose the sense of this furious storm careering over my head, I must court sleep  at once. Rising, I drew off my coat, unloosened my vest and was about to throw  it off, when I bethought me of a certain wallet it contained. Going to the door  in some unconscious impulse of precaution I suppose, I locked myself in, and  then drawing out my wallet, took from it a roll of bills which I put into a  small side pocket, returning the wallet to its old place.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why I did this I can scarcely say. As I have before  intimated, I was under no special apprehension. I was at that time anything but  a suspicious man, and the manner and appearance of the men below struck me as  unpleasantly disagreeable but nothing more. But I not only did what I have  related, but allowed the lamp to remain lighted, lying down finally in my  clothes; an almost unprecedented act on my part, warranted however as I said to  myself, by the fury of the gale which at that time seemed as if it would tumble  the roof over our heads.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How long I lay listening to the creakings and  groanings of the rickety old house, I cannot say, nor how long I remained in  the doze which finally seized me as I became accustomed to the sounds around  and over me. Enough that before the storm had passed its height, I awoke as if  at the touch of a hand, and leaping with a bound out of the bed, beheld to my  incredible amazement, the alert, nervous form of Luttra standing before me. She  had my coat in her hand, and it was her touch that had evidently awakened me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I want you to put this on,&rsquo; said she in a low  thrilling tone totally new in my experience, &lsquo;and come with me. The house is  unsafe for you to remain in. Hear how it cracks and trembles. Another blast  like that and we shall be roofless.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was moving toward the door, which to my amazement  stood ajar, but my hesitation stopped her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you come?&rsquo; she whispered, turning her face  towards me with a look of such potent determination, I followed in spite of  myself &lsquo;I dare not let you stay here, your blood will be upon my head.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You exaggerate,&rsquo; I replied, shrinking back with a  longing look at the comfortable bed I had just left. &lsquo;These old houses are  always strong. It will take many such a gust as that you hear, to overturn it,  I assure you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;<i>I</i> exaggerate!&rsquo; she returned with a look of scorn  impossible to describe. &lsquo;Hark!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;hear that.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did hear, and I must acknowledge that it seemed is  if we were about to be swept from our foundations.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;but it is a fearful night to be out  in.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I shall go with you,&rsquo; said she.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In that case&mdash;&rsquo; I began with an ill-advised attempt  at gallantry which she cut short with a gesture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Here is your hat,&rsquo; remarked she, &lsquo;and here is your  bag. The fishing-pole must remain, you cannot carry it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But,&mdash;&rsquo; I expostulated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; said she with her ear turned towards the  depths of the staircase at the top of which we stood. &lsquo;My father and brother  will think as you do that it is folly to leave the shelter of a roof for the  uncertainties of the road on such a night as this, but you must not heed them.  I tell you shelter this night is danger, and that the only safety to be found  is on the stormy highway.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And without waiting for my reply, she passed rapidly  down stairs, pushed open a door at the bottom, and stepped at once into the room  we had left an hour or so before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What was there in that room that for the first time  struck an ominous chill as of distinct peril through my veins? Nothing at first  sight, everything at the second. The fire which had not been allowed to die  out, still burned brightly on the ruddy hearthstone, but it was not that which  awakened my apprehension. Nor was it the loud ticking clock on the mantel-piece  with its hand pointing silently to the hour of eleven. Nor yet the heavy quiet  of the scantily-furnished room with its one lamp burning on the deal table  against the side of the wall. It was the sight of those two powerful men drawn  up in grim silence, the one against the door leading to the front hall, the  other against that opening into the kitchen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A glance at Luttra standing silent and undismayed at  my side, however, instantly reassured me. With that will exercised in my favor,  I could not but win through whatever it was that menaced me. Slinging my bag  over my shoulder, I made a move towards the door and the silent figure of my  host. But with a quick outreaching of her hand, she drew me back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Stand still!&rsquo; said she. &lsquo;Karl,&rsquo; she went on, turning  her face towards the more sullen but less intent countenance of her brother, &lsquo;open  the door and let this gentleman pass. He finds the house unsafe in such a gale  and desires to leave it. At once!&rsquo; she continued as her brother settled himself  more determinedly against the lock: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t often ask favors.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The man is a fool that wants to go out in a night  like this,&rsquo; quoth the fellow with a dogged move; &lsquo;and so are you to encourage  it. I think too much of your health to allow it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She did not seem to hear. &lsquo;Will you open the door?&rsquo;  she went on, not advancing a step from the fire, before which she had placed  herself and me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, I won&rsquo;t,&rsquo; was the brutal reply. &lsquo;Its been locked  for the night and its not me nor one like me, that will open it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With a sudden whitening of her already pale face, she  turned towards her father. He was not even looking at her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Some one must open the house,&rsquo; said she, glancing  back at her brother. &lsquo;This gentleman purposes to leave and his whim must be  humored. Will you unlock that door or shall I?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An angry snarl interrupted her. Her father had  bounded from the door where he stood and was striding hastily towards her. In  my apprehension I put up my arm for a shield, for he looked ready to murder  her, but I let it drop again as l caught her glance which was like white flame  undisturbed by the least breeze of personal terror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You will stop there,&rsquo; said she, pointing to a spot a  few feet from where she stood. &lsquo;Another step and I let that for which I have  heard you declare you would peril your very soul, fall into the heart of the  flames.&rsquo; And drawing from her breast a roll of bills, she stretched them out  above the fire before which she was standing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You &mdash;&rsquo; broke from the gray-bearded lips of the old  man, but he stopped where he was, eyeing those bills as if fascinated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am not a girl of many words, as you know,&rsquo;  continued she in a lofty tone inexpressibly commanding. &lsquo;You may strangle me,  you may kill me, it matters little; but this gentleman leaves the house this  night, or I destroy the money with a gesture.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You &mdash;&rsquo; again broke from those quivering lips, but  the old man did not move.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not so the younger. With a rush he left his post and  in another instant would have had his powerful arms about her slender form,  only that I met him half way with a blow that laid him on the floor at her  feet. She said nothing, but one of the bills immediately left her hand and  fluttered into the fire where it instantly shrivelled into nothing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With the yell of a mad beast wounded in his most  vulnerable spot, the old man before us stamped with his heel upon the floor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Stop!&rsquo; cried he; and going rapidly to the front door  he opened it. &lsquo;There!&rsquo; shrieked he, &lsquo;if you will be fools, go! and may the  lightning blast you. But first give me the money.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Come from the door,&rsquo; said she, reaching out her left  hand for the lantern hanging at the side of the fireplace, &lsquo;and let Karl light  this and keep himself out of the way.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was all done. In less time than I can tell it, the  old man had stepped from the door, the younger one had lit the lantern and we  were in readiness to depart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now do you proceed,&rsquo; said she to me, &lsquo;I will follow.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;we will go together.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But the money?&rsquo; growled the heavy voice of my host  over my shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will give it to you on my return,&rsquo; said the girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter12"></a><b>Chapter XII<br>
    A Woman&rsquo;s Love</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall I ever forget the blast of driving rain that  struck our faces and enveloped us in a cloud of wet, as the door swung on its  hinges and let us forth into the night; or the electric thrill that shot  through me as that slender girl grasped my hand and drew me away through the  blinding darkness. It was not that I was so much affected by her beauty as  influenced by her power and energy. The fury of the gale seemed to bend to her  will, the wind lend wings to her feet. I began to realize what intellect was.  Arrived at the roadside, she paused and looked back. The two burly forms of the  men we had left behind us were standing in the door of the inn; in another  moment they had plunged forth and towards us. With a low cry the young girl  leaped towards a tree where to my unbounded astonishment I beheld my horse  standing ready saddled. Dragging the mare from her fastenings, she hung the  lantern, burning as it was, on the pommel of the saddle, struck the panting  creature a smart blow upon the flank, and drew back with a leap to my side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The startled horse snorted, gave a plunge of dismay  and started away from us down the road.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We will wait,&rsquo; said Luttra.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The words were no sooner out of her mouth than her  father and brother rushed by.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They will follow the light,&rsquo; whispered she; and  seizing me again by the hand, she hurried me away in the direction opposite to  that which the horse had taken. &lsquo;If you will trust me, I will bring you to  shelter,&rsquo; she murmured, bending her slight form to the gusty wind but relaxing  not a whit of her speed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are too kind,&rsquo; I murmured in return. &lsquo;Why should  you expose yourself to such an extent for a stranger?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her hand tightened on mine, but she did not reply,  and we hastened on as speedily as the wind and rain would allow. After a short  but determined breasting of the storm, during which my breath had nearly failed  me, she suddenly stopped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you know,&rsquo; she exclaimed in a low impressive  tone, &lsquo;that we are on the verge of a steep and dreadful precipice? It runs  along here for a quarter of a mile and it is not an uncommon thing for a horse  and rider to be dashed over it in a night like this.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was something in her manner that awakened a  chill in my veins almost as if she had pointed out some dreadful doom which I  had unwittingly escaped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This is, then, a dangerous road,&rsquo; I murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Very,&rsquo; was her hurried and almost incoherent reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How far we travelled through the mud and tangled  grasses of that horrible road I do not know. It seemed a long distance; it was  probably not more than three quarters of a mile. At last she paused with a  short &lsquo;Here we are;&rsquo; and looking up, I saw that we were in front of a small  unlighted cottage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No refuge ever appeared more welcome to a pair of  sinking wanderers I am sure. Wet to the skin, bedrabbled with mud, exhausted  with breasting the gale, we stood for a moment under the porch to regain our  breath, then with her characteristic energy she lifted the knocker and struck a  smart blow on the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We will find shelter here,&rsquo; said she.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was not mistaken. In a few moments we were  standing once more before a comfortable fire hastily built by the worthy couple  whose slumbers we had thus interrupted. As I began to realize the sweetness of  conscious safety, all that this young, heroic creature had done for me swept  warmly across my mind. Looking up from the fire that was beginning to infuse  its heat through my grateful system, I surveyed her as she slowly undid her  long braids and shook them dry over the blaze, and almost started to see how  young she was. Not more than sixteen I should say, and yet what an invincible  will shone from her dark eyes and dignified her slender form; a will gentle as  it was strong, elevated as it was unbending. I bowed my head as I watched her,  in grateful thankfulness which I presently put into words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At once she drew herself erect. &lsquo;I did but my duty,&rsquo;  said she quietly. &lsquo;I am glad I was prospered in it.&rsquo; Then slowly. &lsquo;If you <i>are</i>  grateful, sir, will you promise to say nothing of&mdash;of what took place at the  inn?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Instantly I remembered a suspicion which had crossed  my mind while there, and my hand went involuntarily to my vest pocket. The roll  of bills was gone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She did not falter. &lsquo;I would be relieved if you  would,&rsquo; continued she.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I drew out my empty hand, looked at it, but said  nothing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Have you lost anything?&rsquo; asked she. &lsquo;Search in your  overcoat pockets.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I plunged my hand into the one nearest her and drew  it out with satisfaction; the roll of bills was there. &lsquo;I give you my promise,&rsquo;  said I.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You will find a bill missing,&rsquo; she murmured; &lsquo;for  what amount I do not know; the sacrifice of something was inevitable.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I can only wonder over the ingenuity you displayed,  as well as express my appreciation for your bravery,&rsquo; returned I with  enthusiasm. &lsquo;You are a noble girl.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She put out her hand as if compliments hurt her. &lsquo;It  is the first time they have ever attempted anything like that,&rsquo; cried she in a  quick low tone full of shame and suffering. &lsquo;They have shown a disposition  to&mdash;to take money sometimes, but they never threatened life before. And they did  threaten yours. They saw you take out your money, through a hole pierced in the  wall of the room you occupied, and the sight made them mad. They were going to  kill you and then tumble you and your horse over the precipice below there. But  I overheard them talking and when they went out to saddle the horse, I hurried  up to your room to wake you. I had to take possession of the bills; you were  not safe while you held them. I took them quietly because I hoped to save you  without betraying them. But I failed in that. You must remember they are my  father and my brother.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;I will not betray them,&rsquo; said I.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She smiled. It was a wintry gleam but it ineffably  softened her face. I became conscious of a movement of pity towards her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You have a hard lot,&rsquo; remarked I. &lsquo;Your life must be  a sad one.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She flashed upon me one glance of her dark eye. &lsquo;I  was born for hardship,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;but&mdash;&rsquo; and a sudden wild shudder seized her, &lsquo;but  not for <i>crime</i>.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The word fell like a drop of blood wrung from her  heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Good heavens!&rsquo; cried I, &lsquo;and must you&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; rang from her lips in a clarion-like peal; &lsquo;some  things cut the very bonds of nature. I am not called upon to cleave to what  will drag me into infamy.&rsquo; Then calmly, as if speaking of the most ordinary  matter in the world, &lsquo;I shall never go back to that house we have left behind  us, sir.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;But,&rsquo; cried I, glancing at her scanty garments, &lsquo;where  will you go? What will you do? You are young&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;And very strong,&rsquo; she interrupted. &lsquo;Do not fear for  me.&rsquo; And her smile was like a burst of sudden sunshine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I said no more that night.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But when in the morning I stumbled upon her sitting  in the kitchen reading a book not only above her position but beyond her years,  a sudden impulse seized me and I asked her if she would like to be educated.  The instantaneous illumining of her whole face was sufficient reply without her  low emphatic words,</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;I would be content to study on my knees to know what  some women do, whom I have seen.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is not necessary for me to relate with what  pleasure I caught at the idea that here was a chance to repay in some slight  measure the inestimable favor she had done me; nor by what arguments I finally  won her to accept an education at my hands as some sort of recompense for the  life she had saved. The advantage which it would give her in her struggle with  the world she seemed duly to appreciate, but that so great a favor could be  shown her without causing me much trouble and an unwarrantable expense, she  could not at once be brought to comprehend, and till she could, she held out  with that gentle but inflexible will of hers. The battle, however, was won at  last and I left her in that little cottage, with the understanding that as soon  as the matter could be arranged, she was to enter a certain boarding-school in Troy  with the mistress of which I was acquainted. Meanwhile she was to go out to  service at Melville and earn enough money to provide herself with clothes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was a careless fellow in those days but I kept my  promise to that girl. I not only entered her into that school for a course of  three years, but acting through its mistress who had taken a great fancy to  her, supplied her with the necessities her position required. It was so easy;  merely the signing of a check from time to time, and it was done. I say this  because I really think if it had involved any personal sacrifice on my part,  even of an hour of my time, or the labor of a thought, I should not have done  it. For with my return to the city my interest in my cousin revived, absorbing  me to such an extent that any matter disconnected with her soon lost all charm  for me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two years passed; I was the slave of Evelyn Blake,  but there was no engagement between us. My father&rsquo;s determined opposition was  enough to prevent that. But there was an understanding which I fondly hoped  would one day open for me the way of happiness. But I did not know my father.  Sick as he was&mdash;he was at that time laboring under the disease which in a couple  of months later bore him to the tomb&mdash;he kept an eye upon my movements and seemed  to probe my inmost heart. At last he came to a definite decision and spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His words opened a world of dismay before me. I was  his only child, as he remarked, and it had been and was the desire of his heart  to leave me as rich and independent a man as himself. But I seemed disposed to  commit one of those acts against which he had the most determined prejudice;  marriage between cousins being in his eyes an unsanctified and dangerous  proceeding, liable to consequences the most unhappy. If I persisted, he must  will his property elsewhere. The Blake estate should never descend with the  seal of his approbation to a race of probable imbeciles.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor was this enough. He not only robbed me of the  woman I loved, but with a clear insight into the future, I presume, insisted  upon my marrying some one else of respectability and worth before he died. &lsquo;Anyone  whose appearance will do you credit and whose virtue is beyond reproach,&rsquo; said  he. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t ask her to be rich or even the offspring of one of our old  families. Let her be good and pure and of no connection to us, and I will bless  her and you with my dying breath.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The idea had seized upon him with great force, and I  soon saw he was not to be shaken out of it. To all my objections he returned  but the one word,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t restrict your choice and I give you a month  in which to make it. If at the end of that time you cannot bring your bride to  my bedside, I must look around for an heir who will not thwart my dying wishes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A month! I surveyed the fashionable belles that  nightly thronged the parlors of my friends and felt my heart sink within me.  Take one of them for my wife, loving another woman? Impossible. Women like  these demanded something in return for the honor they conferred upon a man by  marrying him. Wealth? they had it. Position? that was theirs also.  Consideration? ah, what consideration had I to give? I turned from them with  distaste.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My cousin Evelyn gave me no help. She was a proud  woman and loved my money and my expectations as much as she did me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If you must marry another woman to retain your  wealth, marry, said she, &lsquo;but do not marry one of my associates. I will have no  rival in my own empire; your wife must be a plainer and a less aspiring woman  than Evelyn Blake. Yet do not discredit your name,&mdash;which is mine,&rsquo; she would  always add.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meanwhile the days flew by. If my own conscience had  allowed me to forget the fact, my father&rsquo;s eagerly inquiring, but sternly  unrelenting gaze as I came each evening to his bedside, would have kept it  sufficiently in my mind. I began to feel like one in the power of some huge  crushing machine whose slowly descending weight he in vain endeavors to escape.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How or when the thought of Luttra first crossed my  mind I cannot say. At first I recoiled at the suggestion and put it away from  me in disdain; but it ever recurred and with it so many arguments in her favor  that before long I found myself regarding it as a refuge. To be sure she was a  waif and a stray, but that seemed to be the kind of wife demanded of me. She  was allied to rogues if not villains, I knew; but then had she not cut all  connection with them, dropped away from them, planted her feet on new ground  which they would never invade? I commenced to cherish the idea. With this  friendless, grateful, unassuming protegee of mine for a wife, I would be as  little bound as might be. She would ask nothing, and I need give nothing,  beyond a home and the common attentions required of a gentleman and a friend.  Then she was not disagreeable, nor was her beauty of a type to suggest the  charms of her I had lost. None of the graces of the haughty patrician lady  whose lightest gesture was a command, would appear in this humble girl, to mock  and constrain me. No, I should have a fair wife and an obedient one, but no  vulgarized shadow of Evelyn, thank God, or of any of her fashionably dressed  friends.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Advanced thus far towards the end, I went to see  Luttra. I had not beheld her since the morning we parted at the door of that  little cottage in Vermont, and her presence caused me a shock. This, the humble  waif with the appealing grateful eyes I had expected to encounter? this tall  and slender creature with an aureola of golden hair about a face that it was an  education to behold! I felt a half movement of anger as I surveyed her. I had  been cheated; I had planted a grape seed and a palm tree had sprung up in its  place. I was so taken aback, my salute lost something of the benevolent  condescension I had intended to infuse into it. She seemed to feel my  embarassment and a half smile fluttered to her lips. That smile decided me. It  was sweet but above all else it was appealing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How I won that woman to marry me in ten days time I  care not to state. Not by holding up my wealth and position before her.  Something restrained me from that. I was resolved, and perhaps it was the only  point of light in my conduct at that time, not to buy this young girl. I never  spoke of my expectations, I never alluded to my present advantages yet I won  her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We were married, there, in Troy in the quietest and  most unpretending manner. Why the fact has never transpired I cannot say. I  certainly took no especial pains to conceal it at the time, though I  acknowledge that after our separation I did resort to such measures as I  thought necessary, to suppress what had become gall and wormwood to my pride.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My first move after the ceremony was to bring her  immediately to New York and to this house. With perhaps a pardonable bitterness  of spirit, I had refrained from any notification of my intentions, and it was  as strangers might enter an unprepared dwelling, that we stepped across the  threshold of this house and passed immediately to my father&rsquo;s room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I can give you no wedding and no honeymoon,&rsquo; I had  told her. &lsquo;My father is dying and demands my care. From the altar to a  death-bed may be sad for you, but it is an inevitable condition of your  marriage with me.&rsquo; And she had accepted her fate with a deep unspeakable smile  it has taken me long months of loneliness and suffering to understand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Father, I bring you my bride,&rsquo; were my first words  to him as the door closed behind us shutting us in with the dread, invisible  Presence that for so long a time had been relentlessly advancing upon our home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall never forget how he roused himself in his  bed, nor with what eager eyes he read her young face and surveyed her slight  form swaying towards him in her sudden emotion like a flame in a breeze. Nor  while I live shall I lose sight of the spasm of uncontrollable joy with which  he lifted his aged arms towards her, nor the look with which she sprang from my  side and nestled, yes nestled, on the breast that never to my remembrance had  opened itself to me even in the years of my earliest childhood. For my father  was a stern man who believed in holding love at arm&rsquo;s length and measured  affection by the depth of awe it inspired.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My daughter!&rsquo; broke from his lips, and he never  inquired who she was or what; no, not even when after a moment of silence she  raised her head and with a sudden low cry of passionate longing looked in his  face and murmured,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I never had a father.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sirs, it is impossible for me to continue without  revealing depths of pride and bitterness in my own nature, from which I now  shrink with unspeakable pain. So far from being touched by this scene, I felt  myself grow hard under it. If he had been disappointed in my choice, queried at  it or even been simply pleased at my obedience, I might have accepted the wife  I had won, and been tolerably grateful. But to love her, admire her, glory in  her when Evelyn Blake had never succeeded in winning a glance from his eyes  that was not a public disapprobation! I could not endure it; my whole being  rebelled, and a movement like hate took possession of me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bidding my wife to leave me with my father alone, I  scarcely waited for the door to close upon the poor young thing before all that  had been seething in my breast for a month, burst from me in the one cry,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have brought you a daughter as you commanded me.  Now give me the blessing you promised and let me go; for I cannot live with a  woman I do not love.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Instantly, and before his lips could move, the door  opened and the woman I thus repudiated in the first dawning hour of her young  bliss, stood before us. My God! what a face! When I think of it now in the  night season&mdash;when from dreams that gloomy as they are, are often elysian to the  thoughts which beset me in my waking hours, I suddenly arouse to see starting  upon me from the surrounding shadows that young fair brow with its halo of  golden tresses, blotted, ay blotted by the agony that turned her that instant  into stone, I wonder I did not take out the pistol that lay in the table near  which I stood, and shoot her lifeless on the spot as some sort of a  compensation for the misery I had caused her. I say I wonder now: then I only  thought of braving it out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Straight as a dart, but with that look on her face,  she came towards us. &lsquo;Did I hear aright?&rsquo; were the words that came from her  lips. &lsquo;Have you married me, a woman beneath your station as I now perceive,  because you were commanded to do so? Have you not loved me? given me that which  alone makes marriage a sacrament or even a possibility? and must you leave this  house made sacred by the recumbent form of your dying father if I remain within  it?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I saw my father&rsquo;s stiff and pallid lips move silently  as though he would answer for me if he could, and summoning up what courage I  possessed, I told her that I deeply regretted she had overheard my  inconsiderate words. That I had never meant to wound <i>her</i>, whatever bitterness  lay in my heart towards one who had thwarted me in my dearest and most  cherished hopes. That I humbly begged her pardon and would so far acknowledge  her claim upon me as to promise that I would not leave my home at this time, if  it distressed her; my desire being not to injure her, only to protect myself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O the scorn that mounted to her brow at these weak  words. Not scorn of me, thank God, worthy as I was of it that hour, but scorn  of my slight opinion of her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then I heard aright,&rsquo; she murmured, and waited with  a look that would not be gainsaid.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I could only bow my head, cursing the day I was born.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Holman! Holman!&rsquo; came in agonized entreaty from the  bed, &lsquo;you will not rob me of my daughter <i>now</i>?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Startled, I looked up. Luttra was half way to the  door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;What are you going to do?&rsquo; cried I, bounding towards  her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She stopped me with a look. &lsquo;The son must never  forsake the father,&rsquo; said she. &lsquo;If either of us must leave the house this day,  let it be I.&rsquo; Then in a softer tone, &lsquo;When you asked me to be your wife, I who  had worshipped you from the moment you entered my father&rsquo;s house on the  memorable night I left it, was so overcome at your condescension that I forgot  you did not preface it by the usual passionate, &lsquo;I love you,&rsquo; which more than  the marriage ring binds two hearts together. In the glamour and glow of my joy,  I did not see that the smile that was in my heart, was missing from your face.  I was to be your wife and that was enough, or so I thought then, for I loved  you. Ah, and I do now, my husband, love you so that I leave you. Were it for  your happiness I would do more than that, I would give you back your freedom,  but from what I hear, it seems that you need a wife in name and I will be but  fulfilling your desire in holding that place for you. I will never disgrace the  position high as it is above my poor deserts. When the day comes&mdash;if the day  comes&mdash;that you need or feel you need the sustainment of my presence or the  devotion of my heart, no power on earth save that of death itself, shall keep  me from your side. Till that day arrives I remain what you have made me, a  bride who lays no claim to the name you this morning bestowed upon her.&rsquo; And  with a gesture that was like a benediction, she turned, and noiselessly,  breathlessly as a dream that vanishes, left the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sirs, I believe I uttered a cry and stumbled towards  her. Some one in that room uttered a cry, but it may be that it only rose in my  heart and that the one I heard came from my father&rsquo;s lips. For when at the door  I turned, startled at the deathly silence, I saw he had fainted on his pillow.  I could not leave him so. Calling to Mrs. Daniels, who was never far from my  father in those days, I bade her stop the lady&mdash;I believe I called her my  wife&mdash;who was going down the stairs, and then rushed to his side. It took  minutes to revive him. When he came to himself it was to ask for the creature  who had flashed like a beacon of light upon his darkening path. I rose as if to  fetch her but before I could advance I heard a voice say, &lsquo;She is not here,&rsquo;  and looking up I saw Mrs. Daniels glide into the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mrs. Blake has gone, sir, I could not keep her.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter13"></a><b>Chapter XIII<br>
    A Man&rsquo;s Heart</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;That was the last time my eyes ever rested upon my  wife. Whither she went or what refuge she gained, I never knew. My father who  had received in this scene a great shock, began to fail so rapidly, he demanded  my constant care; and though from time to time as I ministered to him and noted  with what a yearning persistency he would eye the door and then turn and meet  my gaze with a look I could not understand, I caught myself asking whether I  had done a deed destined to hang forever about me like a pall; it was not till  after his death that the despairing image of the bright young creature to whom  I had given my name, returned with any startling distinctness to my mind, or  that I allowed myself to ask whether the heavy gloom which I now felt settling  upon me was owing to the sense of shame that overpowered me at the remembrance  of the past, or to the possible loss I had sustained in the departure of my  young unloved bride.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The announcement at this time of the engagement  between Evelyn Blake and the Count De Mirac may have had something to do with  this. Though I had never in the most passionate hours of my love for her, lost  sight of that side of her nature which demanded as her right the luxury of  great wealth; and though in my tacit abandonment of her and secret marriage  with another I had certainly lost the right to complain of her actions whatever  they might be, this manifest surrendering of herself to the power of wealth and  show at the price of all that women are believed to hold dear, was an undoubted  blow to my pride and the confidence I had till now unconsciously reposed in her  inherent womanliness and affection. That she had but made on a more conspicuous  scale, the same sacrifice as myself to the god of Wealth and Position, was in  my eyes at that time, no palliation of her conduct. I was a man none too good  or exalted at the best; she, a woman, should have been superior to the temptations  that overpowered me. That she was not, seemed to drag all womanhood a little  nearer the dust; fashionable womanhood I ought to say, for somehow even at that  early day her conduct did not seem to affect the vivid image of Luttra standing  upon my threshold, shorn of her joy but burning with a devotion I did not  comprehend, and saying,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I loved you. Ah, and I do yet, my husband, love you  so that I leave you. When the day comes&mdash;if the day comes&mdash;you need or feel you  need the sustainment of my presence or the devotion of my heart, no power on  earth save that of death itself, shall keep me from your side.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, with the fading away of other faces and other  forms, that face and that form now began to usurp the chief place in my  thoughts. Not to my relief and pleasure. That could scarcely be, remembering  all that had occurred; rather to my increasing distress and passionate  resentment. I longed to forget I was held by a tie, that known to the world  would cause me the bitterest shame. For by this time the true character of her  father and brother had been revealed and I found myself bound to the daughter  of a convicted criminal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I could not forget <i>her</i>. The look with which she  had left me was branded into my consciousness. Night and day it floated before  me, till to escape it I resolved to fasten it upon canvas, if by that means I  might succeed in eliminating it from my dreams.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The painting you have seen this night is the result.  Born with an artist&rsquo;s touch and insight that under other circumstances might,  perhaps, have raised me into the cold dry atmosphere of fame, the execution of  this piece of work, presented but few difficulties to my somewhat accustomed  hand. Day by day her beauty grew beneath my brush, startling me often with its  spiritual force and significance till my mind grew feverish over its work, and  I could scarcely refrain from rising at night to give a touch here or there to  the floating golden hair or the piercing, tender eyes turned, ah, ever turned  upon the inmost citadel of my heart with that look that slew my father before  his time and made me, yes me, old in spirit even in the ardent years of my  first manhood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At last it was finished and she stood before me  life-like and real in the very garments and with almost the very aspect of that  never to be forgotten moment. Even the roses which in the secret uneasiness of  my conscience I had put in her hand on our departure from Troy, as a sort of  visible token that I regarded her as my bride, and which through all her  interview with my father she had never dropped, blossomed before me on the  canvas. Nothing that could give reality to the likeness, was lacking; the  vision of my dreams stood embodied in my sight, and I looked for peace. Alas,  that picture now became my dream.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Inserting it behind that of Evelyn which for two  years had held its place above my armchair, I turned its face to the wall when  I rose in the morning. But at night it beamed ever upon me, becoming as the  months passed, the one thing to hold to and muse over when the world grew a little  noisy in my ears and the never ceasing conflict of the ages beat a trifle too  loudly on heart and brain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meanwhile no word of her, only of her villainous  father and brother; no token that she had escaped evil or was removed from  want. If I had loved her I could not have succored her, for I did not know  where to find her. Her countenance illumined my wall, but her fair young self  lay for all I knew sheltered within the darkness and silence of the tomb.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At length my morbid broodings worked out their natural  result. A dull melancholy settled upon me which nothing could break. Even the  news that my cousin who had lost her husband a month after marriage, had  returned to America with expectation to remain, scarcely caused a ripple in my  apathy. Was I sinking into a hypochrondriac? or was my passion for the  beautiful brunette dead? I determined to solve the doubt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seeking her where I knew she would be found, I gazed  again upon her beauty. It was absolutely nothing to me. A fair young face with  high thoughts in every glance floated like sunshine between us and I left the  haughty Countess, with the knowledge burned deep into my brain, that the love I  had considered slain was alive and demanding, but that the object of it past  recall, was my lost young wife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Once assured of this, my apathy vanished like mist  before a kindled torch. Henceforth the future held a hope, and life a purpose.  I would seek my wife throughout the world and bring her back if I found her in  prison between the men whose existence was a curse to my pride. But where  should I turn my steps? What golden thread had she left in my hand by which to  trace her through the labyrinth of this world? I could think of but one, and  that was the love which would restrain her from going away from me too far. The  Luttra of old would not leave the city where her husband lived. If she was not  changed, I ought to be able to find her somewhere within this great Babylon of  ours. Wisdom told me to set the police upon her track, but pride bade me try  every other means first. So with the feverish energy of one leading a forlorn  hope, I began to pace the streets if haply I might see her face shine upon me  from the crowd of passers by; a foolish fancy, unproductive of result! I not  only failed to see her, but anyone like her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the midst of the despair occasioned by this  failure a thought flashed across me or rather a remembrance. One night not long  since, being uncommonly restless, I had risen from my bed, dressed me and gone  out into the yard back of my house for a little air. It was an unusual thing  for me to do but I seemed to be suffocating where I was, and nothing else would  satisfy me. As you already surmise, it was the night on which disappeared the  sewing girl of which you have so often spoken, but I knew nothing of that, my  thoughts were far from my own home and its concerns. You may judge what a state  of mind I was in when I tell you that I even thought at one moment while I  paused before the gate leading into &mdash;Street that I saw the face of her with  whom my thoughts were ever busy, peering upon me through the bars.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You tell me that I did see a girl there, and that it  was the one who had lived as sewing woman in my house; it may be so, but at the  time I considered it a vision of my wife, and the remembrance of it, coming as  it did after my repeated failures to encounter her in the street, worked a  change in my plans. For regard it as weakness or not, the recollection that the  vision I had seen wore the garments of a working-woman rather than a lady,  acted upon me like a warning not to search for her any longer among the resorts  of the well-dressed, but in the regions of poverty and toil. I therefore took  to wanderings such as I have no heart to describe. Nor do I need to, if, as you  have informed me, I have been followed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The result was almost madness. Though deep in my  heart I felt a steadfast trust in the purity of her intentions, the fear of  what she might have been driven to by the awful poverty and despair I every day  saw seething about me, was like hot steel in brain and heart. Then her father  and her brother! To what might they not have forced her, innocent and loving  soul though she was! Drinking the dregs of a cup such as I had never considered  it possible for me to taste, I got so far as to believe that her eyes would yet  flash upon me from beneath some of the tattered shawls I saw sullying the forms  of the young girls upon which I hourly stumbled. Yes, and even made a move to  see my cousin, if haply I could so win upon her compassion as to gain her consent  to shelter the poor creature of my dreams in case the necessity came. But my  heart failed me at the sight of her cold face above the splendor she had bought  with her charms, and I was saved a humiliation I might never have risen above.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At last, one day I saw a girl&mdash;no, it was not she, but  her hair was similar to hers in hue, and the impulse to follow her was  irresistible. I did more than that, I spoke to her. I asked her if she could  tell me anything of one whose locks were golden red like hers&mdash;But I need not  tell you what I said nor what she replied with a gentle delicacy that was  almost a shock to me as showing from what heights to what depths a woman can  fall. Enough that nothing passed between us beyond what I have intimated, and  that in all she said she gave me no news of Luttra.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Next day I started for the rambling old house in  Vermont, if haply in the spot where I first saw her, I might come upon some  clue to her present whereabouts. But the old inn was deserted, and whatever  hope I may have had in that direction, perished with the rest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Concerning the contents of that bureau-drawer above,  I can say nothing. If, as I scarcely dare to hope, they should prove to have  been indeed brought here by the girl who has since disappeared so strangely,  who knows but what in those folded garments a clue is given which will lead me  at last to the knowledge for which I would now barter all I possess. My  wife&mdash;But I can mention her name no more till the question that now assails us  is set at rest. Mrs. Daniels must&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But at that moment the door opened and Mrs. Daniels  came in.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter14"></a><b>Chapter XIV<br>
    Mrs. Daniels</b></h2>
  <p>She still wore her bonnet and shawl and her face was  like marble.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You want me?&rdquo; said she with a hurried look towards  Mr. Blake that had as much fear as surprise in it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; murmured that gentleman moving towards her with  an effort we could very well appreciate. &ldquo;Mrs. Daniels, who was the girl you  harbored in that room above us for so long? Speak; what was her name and where  did she come from?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The housekeeper trembling in every limb, cast us one  hurried appeal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Speak!&rdquo; reechoed Mr. Gryce; &ldquo;the time for secrecy has  passed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; cried she, sinking into a chair from sheer  inability to stand, &ldquo;it was your wife, Mr. Blake, the young creature you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All the agony, the hopelessness, the love, the passion  of those last few months flashed up in that word. She stopped as if she had  been shot, but seeing the hand which he had hurriedly raised, fall slowly  before him, went on with a burst,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O sir, she made me swear on my knees I would never  betray her, no matter what happened. When not two weeks after your father died  she came to the house and asking for me, told me all her story and all her  love; how she could not reconcile it with her idea of a wife&rsquo;s duty to live  under any other roof than that of her husband, and lifting off the black wig  which she wore, showed me how altered she had made herself by that simple  change&mdash;in her case more marked by the fact that her eyes were in keeping with  black hair, while with her own bright locks they always gave you a shock as of  something strange and haunting&mdash;I gave up my will as if forced by a magnetic  power, and not only opened the house to her but my heart as well; swearing to  all she demanded and keeping my oath too, as I would preserve my soul from sin  and my life from the knife of the destroyer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, when she went,&rdquo; broke from the pallid lips of  the man before her, &ldquo;when she was taken away from the house, what then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; returned the agitated woman, &ldquo;what then! Do you  not think I suffered? To be held by my oath, an oath I was satisfied she would  wish kept even at this crisis, yet knowing all the while she was drifting away  into some evil that you, if you knew who she was, would give your life to avert  from your honor if not from her innocent head! To see you cold, indifferent,  absorbed in other things, while she, who would have perished any day for your  happiness, was losing her life perhaps in the clutches of those horrible  villains! Do not ask me to tell you what I have suffered since she went; I can  never tell you,&mdash;innocent, tender, noble-hearted creature that she was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was?&rdquo; His hand clutched his heart as if it had been  seized by a deathly spasm. &ldquo;Why do you say <i>was?</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because I have just come from the Morgue where she  lies dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; came in a low shriek from his lips, &ldquo;that is  not she; that is another woman, like her perhaps, but not she.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would to God you were right; but the long golden  braids! Such hair as hers I never saw on anyone before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Blake is right,&rdquo; I broke in, for I could not  endure this scene any longer. &ldquo;The woman taken out of the East river to-day has  been both seen and spoken to by him and that not long since. He should know if  it is his wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, a thousand times no; the girl was a perfect  stranger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The assurance seemed to lift a leaden weight from her  heart. &ldquo;O thank God,&rdquo; she murmured dropping with an irresistible impulse on her  knees. Then with a sudden return of her old tremble, &ldquo;But I was only to reveal  her secret in case of her death! What have I done, O what have I done! Her only  hope lay in my faithfulness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Blake leaning heavily on the table before him,  looked in her face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Daniels,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I love my wife; her hope now  lies in me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She leaped to her feet with a joyous bound. &ldquo;You love  her? O thank God!&rdquo; she again reiterated but this time in a low murmur to her  self. &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; and weeping with unrestrained joy, she drew back into a  corner.</p>
  <p>Of course after that, all that remained for us to do  was to lay our heads together and consult as to the best method of renewing our  search after the unhappy girl, now rendered of double interest to us by the  facts with which we had just been made acquainted. That she had been forced  away from the roof that sheltered her by the power of her father and brother  was of course no longer open to doubt. To discover them, therefore, meant to  recover her. Do you wonder, then, that from the moment we left Mr. Blake&rsquo;s  house, the capture of that brace of thieves became the leading purpose of our  two lives?</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter15"></a><b>Chapter XV<br>
    A Confab</b></h2>
  <p>Next morning Mr. Gryce and I met in serious  consultation. How, and in what direction should we extend the inquiries  necessary to a discovery of these Schoenmakers?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I advise a thorough overhauling of the German quarter,&rdquo;  said my superior. &ldquo;Schmidt, and Rosenthal will help us and the result ought to  be satisfactory.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But I shook my head at this. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe,&rdquo; said  I, &ldquo;that they will hide among their own people. You must remember they are not  alone, but have with them a young woman of a somewhat distinguished appearance,  whose presence in a crowded district, like that, would be sure to awaken  gossip; something which above all else they must want to avoid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is true; the Germans are a dreadful race for  gossip.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If they dared to ill-dress her or ill-treat her, it  would be different. But she is a valuable piece of property to them you see, a  choice lot of goods which it is for their interest to preserve in first-class  condition till the day comes for its disposal. For I presume you have no doubt  that it is for the purpose of extorting money from Mr. Blake that they have  carried off his young wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For that reason or one similar. He is a man of  resources, they may have hoped he would help them to escape the country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t hide in the German quarter they  certainly won&rsquo;t in the Italian, French or Irish. What they want is to keep  close and rouse no questions. I think they will be found to have gone up the  river somewhere, or over to Jersey. Hoboken wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad place to send  Schmidt to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You forget what it is they&rsquo;ve got on their minds;  besides no conspicuous party such as they could live in a rural district  without attracting more attention than in the most crowded tenement house in  the city.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where do you think, then, they would be liable to go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well my most matured thought on the subject,&rdquo;  returned Mr. Gryce, after a moment&rsquo;s deliberation, &ldquo;is this,&mdash;you say, and I  agree, that they have hampered themselves with this woman at this time for the  purpose of using her hereafter in a scheme of black-mail upon Mr. Blake. He,  then, must be the object about which their thoughts revolve and toward which  whatever operations or plans they may be engaged upon must tend. What follows?  When a company of men have made up their minds to rob a bank, what is the first  thing they do? They hire, if possible, a house next to the especial building  they intend to enter, and for months work upon the secret passage through which  they hope to reach the safe and its contents; or they make friends with the  watchman that guards its treasures, and the janitor who opens and shuts the  doors. In short they hang about their prey before they pounce upon it. And so  will these Schoenmakers do in the somewhat different robbery which they plan  sooner or later to effect. Whatever may keep them close at this moment, Mr.  Blake and Mr. Blake&rsquo;s house is the point toward which their eyes are turned,  and if we had time&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But we haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I broke in impetuously. &ldquo;It is  horrible to think of that grand woman languishing away in the power of such  rascals.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If we had time,&rdquo; Mr. Gryce persisted, &ldquo;all it would  be necessary to do would be to wait, they would come into our hands as easily  and naturally as a hawk into the snare of the fowler. But as you say we have  not, and therefore, I would recommend a little beating of the bush directly  about Mr. Blake&rsquo;s house; for if all my experience is not at fault, those men  are already within eye-shot of the prey they intend to run down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have been living myself in that very  neighborhood and know by this time the ways of every house in the vicinity.  There is not a spot up and down the Avenue for ten blocks where they could hide  away for two days much less two weeks. And as for the side streets,&mdash;why I could  tell you the names of those who live in each house for a considerable distance.  Yet if you say so I will go to work&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do, and meanwhile Schmidt and Rosenthal shall rummage  the German quarter and even go through Williamsburgh and Hoboken. The end justifies  any amount of labor that can be spent upon this matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will do my part when you have done yours.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter16"></a><b>Chapter XVI<br>
    The Mark Of The Red Cross</b></h2>
  <p>And what success did I meet? The best in the world.  And by what means did I attain it? By that of the simplest, prettiest clue I  ever came upon. But let me explain.</p>
  <p>When after a wearisome day spent in an ineffectual  search through the neighborhood, I went home to my room, which as you remember  was a front one in a lodging-house on the opposite corner from Mr. Blake, I was  so absorbed in mind and perhaps I may say shaken in nerve, by the strain under  which I had been laboring for some time now, that I stumbled up an extra flight  of stairs, and without any suspicion of the fact, tried the door of the room  directly over mine. It is a wonder to me now that I could have made the  mistake, for the halls were totally dissimilar, the one above being much more  cut up than the one below, besides being flanked by a greater number of doors.  But the intoxication of the mind is not far removed from that of the body, and  as I say it was not till I had tried the door and found it locked, that I  became aware of the mistake I had made.</p>
  <p>With the foolish sense of shame that always overcomes  us at the committal of any such trivial error, I stumbled hastily back, when my  foot trod upon something that broke under my weight. I never let even small  things pass without some notice. Stooping, then, for what I had thus  inadvertently crushed, I carried it to where a single gas jet turned down very  low, made a partial light in the long hall, and examining it, found it to be a  piece of red chalk.</p>
  <p>What was there in that simple fact to make me start  and hastily recall one or two half-forgotten incidents which, once brought to  mind, awoke a train of thought that led to the discovery and capture of those  two desperate thieves? I will tell you.</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t remember now whether in my account of the  visit I paid to the Schoenmakers&rsquo; house in Vermont, I informed you of the red  cross I noticed scrawled on the panel of one of the doors. It seemed a trivial  thing at the time and made little or no impression upon me, the chances being  that I should never have thought of it again, if I had not come upon the  article just mentioned at a moment when my mind was full of those very  Schoenmakers. But remembered now, together with another half-forgotten  fact,&mdash;that some days previous I had been told by the woman who kept the house I  was in, that the parties over my head (two men and a woman I believe she said)  were giving her some trouble, but that they paid well and therefore she did not  like to turn them out,&mdash;it aroused a vague suspicion in my mind, and led to my  walking back to the door I had endeavored to open in my abstraction, and  carefully looking at it.</p>
  <p>It was plain and white, rather ruder of make than  those below, but offering no inducements for prolonged scrutiny. But not so  with the one that stood at right angles to it on the left. Full in the centre  of that, I beheld distinctly scrawled, probably with the very piece of chalk I  then held, a red cross precisely similar in outline to the one I had seen a few  days before on the panel of the Schoenmakers&rsquo; door at Granby.</p>
  <p>The discovery sent a thrill over me that almost raised  my hair on end. Was, then, this famous trio to be found in the very house in  which I had been myself living for a week or more? over my head in fact? I  could not withdraw my gaze from the mysterious looking object. I bent near, I  listened, I heard what sounded like the suppressed snore of a powerful man, and  almost had to lay hold of myself to prevent my hand from pushing open that  closed door and my feet from entering. As it was I did finger the knob a  little, but an extra loud snore from within reminded me by its suggestion of strength  that I was but a small man and that in this case and at this hour, discretion  was the better part of valor.</p>
  <p>I therefore withdrew, but for the whole night lay  awake listening to catch any sounds that might come from above, and going so  far as to plan what I would do if it should be proved that I was indeed upon  the trail of the men I was so anxious to encounter.</p>
  <p>With the breaking of day I was upon my feet. A rude  step had gone up the stairs a few minutes before and I was all alert to follow.  But I presently considered that my wisest course would be to sound the landlady  and learn if possible with what sort of characters I had to deal. Routing her  out of the kitchen, where at that early hour she was already engaged in  domestic duties, I drew her into a retired corner and put my questions. She was  not backward in replying. She had conceived an innocent liking for me in the  short time I had been with her&mdash;a display of weakness for which I was myself,  perhaps, as much to blame as she&mdash;and was only too ready to pour out her griefs  into my sympathizing ear. For those men were a grief to her, acceptable as was  the money they were careful to provide her with. They were not only always in  the house, that is one of them, smoking his old pipe and blackening up the walls,  but they looked so shabby, and kept the girl so close, and if they did go out,  came in at such unheard of hours. It was enough to drive her crazy; yet the  money, the <i>money</i>&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I know; and the money ought to make  you overlook all the small disagreeablenesses you mention. What is a landlady  without patience.&rdquo; And I urged her not to turn them out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the girl,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;so nice, so quiet, so  sick-looking! I cannot stand it to see her cooped up in that small room, always  watched over by one or both of those burly wretches. The old man says she is  his daughter and she does not deny it, but I would as soon think of that little  rosy child you see cooing in the window over the way, belonging to the beggar  going in at the gate, as of her with her lady-like ways having any connection  with him and his rough-acting son. You ought to see her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is just what I want to do,&rdquo; interrupted I. &ldquo;Not  because you have tempted my fancy by a recital of her charms,&rdquo; I hastened to  add, &ldquo;but because she is, if I don&rsquo;t mistake, a woman for whose discovery and  rescue, a large sum of money has been offered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And without further disguise I acquainted the startled  woman before me with the fact that I was not, as she had always considered, the  clerk out of employment whose daily business it was to sally forth in quest of  a situation, but a member of the city police.</p>
  <p>She was duly impressed and easily persuaded to second  all my operations as far as her poor wits would allow, giving me free range of  her upper story, and above all, promising that secrecy without which all my  finely laid plans for capturing the rogues without raising a scandal, would  fall headlong to the ground.</p>
  <p>Behold me, then, by noon of that same day domiciled in  an apartment next to the one whose door bore that scarlet sign which had  aroused within me such feverish hopes the night before. Clad in the seedy  garments of a broken down French artist whose acquaintance I had once made,  with something of his air and general appearance and with a few of his wretched  daubs hung about on the whitewashed wall, I commenced with every prospect of  success as I thought, that quiet espionage of the hall and its inhabitants  which I considered necessary to a proper attainment of the end I had in view.</p>
  <p>A racking cough was one of the peculiarities of my  friend, and determined to assume the character <i>in toto</i>, I allowed myself to  startle the silence now and then with a series of gasps and chokings that  whether agreeable or not, certainly were of a character to show that I had no  desire to conceal my presence from those I had come among. Indeed it was my  desire to acquaint them as fully and as soon as possible with the fact of their  having a neighbor: a weak-eyed half-alive innocent to be sure, but yet a  neighbor who would keep his door open night and day&mdash;for the warmth of the hall  of course&mdash;and who with the fretful habit of an old man who had once been a  gentleman and a beau, went rambling about through the hall speaking to those he  met and expecting a civil word in return. When he was not rambling or coughing  he made architectural monsters out of cardboard, wherewith to tempt the pennies  out of the pockets of unwary children, an employment that kept him chained to a  small table in the centre of his room directly opposite the open door.</p>
  <p>As I expected I had scarcely given way to three  separate fits of coughing, when the door next me opened with a jerk and a rough  voice called out,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that making all that to do about here? If you  don&rsquo;t stop that infernal noise in a hurry&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A soft voice interrupted him and he drew back. &ldquo;I will  go see,&rdquo; said those gentle tones, and Luttra Blake, for I knew it was she  before the skirt of her robe had advanced beyond the door, stepped out into the  hall.</p>
  <p>I was yet bent over my work when she paused before me.  The fact is I did not dare look up, the moment was one of such importance to  me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have a dreadful cough,&rdquo; said she with that low  ring of sympathy in her voice that goes unconsciously to the heart. &ldquo;Is there  no help for it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I pushed back my work, drew my hand over my eyes, (I  did not need to make it tremble) and glanced up. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I with a shake of  my head, &ldquo;but it is not always so bad. I beg your pardon, miss, if it disturbs  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She threw back the shawl which she had held drawn  tightly over her head, and advanced with an easy gliding step close to my side.  &ldquo;You do not disturb <i>me</i>, but my father is&mdash;is, well a trifle cross sometimes, and  if he should speak up a little harsh now and then, you must not mind. I am  sorry you are so ill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What is there in some women&rsquo;s look, some women&rsquo;s touch  that more than all beauty goes to the heart and subdues it. As she stood there  before me in her dark worsted dress and coarse shawl, with her locks simply  braided and her whole person undignified by art and ungraced by ornament, she  seemed just by the power of her expression and the witchery of her manner, the  loveliest woman I had ever beheld.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are veree kind, veree good,&rdquo; I murmured, half  ashamed of my disguise, though it was assumed for the purpose of rescuing her. &ldquo;Your  sympathy goes to my heart.&rdquo; Then as a deep growl of impatience rose from the  room at my side, I motioned her to go and not irritate the man who seemed to  have such control over her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In a minute,&rdquo; answered she, &ldquo;first tell me what you are  making.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So I told her and in the course of telling, let drop  such other facts about my fancied life as I wished to have known to her and  through her to her father. She looked sweetly interested and more than once  turned upon me that dark eye, of which I had heard so much, full of tears that  were as much for me, scamp that I was, as for her own secret trouble. But the  growls becoming more and more impatient she speedily turned to go, repeating,  however, as she did so,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now remember what I say, you are not to be troubled  if they do speak cross to you. They make noise enough themselves sometimes, as  you will doubtless be assured of to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And the lips which seemed to have grown stiff and cold  with her misery, actually softened into something like a smile.</p>
  <p>The nod which I gave her in return had the solemnity  of a vow in it.</p>
  <p>My mind thus assured as to the correctness of my  suspicions, and the way thus paved to the carrying out of my plans, I allowed  some few days to elapse without further action on my part. My motive was to  acquaint myself as fully as possible with the habits and ways of these two  desperate men, before making the attempt to capture them upon which so many  interests hung. For while I felt it would be highly creditable to my sagacity,  as well as valuable to my reputation as a detective, to restore these escaped  convicts in any way possible into the hands of justice, my chief ambition after  all was to so manage the affair as to save the wife of Mr. Blake, not only from  the consequences of their despair, but from the publicity and scandal attendant  upon the open arrest of two heavily armed men. Strategy, therefore, rather than  force was to be employed, and strategy to be successful must be founded upon  the most thorough knowledge of the matter with which one has to deal. Three  days, then, did I give to the acquiring of that knowledge, the result of which  was the possession of the following facts.</p>
  <p>1. That the landlady was right when she told me the  girl was never left alone, one of the men, if not the father then the son,  always remaining with her.</p>
  <p>2. That while thus guarded, she was not so restricted  but that she had the liberty of walking in the hall, though never for any  length of time.</p>
  <p>3. That the cross on the door seemed to possess some  secret meaning connected with their presence in the house, it having been  erased one evening when the whole three went out on some matter or other, only  to be chalked on again when in an hour or so later, father and daughter  returned alone.</p>
  <p>4. That it was the father and not the son who made  such purchases as were needed, while it was the son and not the father who  carried on whatever operations they had on hand; nightfall being the favorite  hour for the one and midnight for the other; though it not infrequently happened  that the latter sauntered out for a short time also in the afternoon, probably  for the drink he could not go long without.</p>
  <p>5. That they were men of great strength but little  alertness; the stray glimpses I had had of them, revealing a breadth of back  that was truly formidable, if it had not been joined to a heaviness of motion  that proclaimed a certain stolidity of mind that was eminently in our favor.</p>
  <p>How best to use these facts in the building up of a  matured plan of action, was, then, the problem. By noon of a certain day I  believed it to have been solved, and reluctant as I was to leave the spot of my  espionage even for the hour or two necessary to a visit to headquarters, I  found myself compelled to do so. Packing up in a small basket I had for the  purpose, the little articles I had been engaged during the last few days in  making, I gave way to a final fit of coughing so hollow and sepulchral in its  tone, that it awoke a curse from the next room deep as the growl of a wild  beast, and still continuing, finally brought Luttra to the door with that look  of compassion on her face that always called up a flush to my cheek whether I  wished it or no.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, Monsieur, I am afraid your cough is very bad  to-day. O I see; you have been getting ready to go out&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come back here,&rdquo; broke in a heavy voice from the room  she had left. &ldquo;What do you mean by running off to palaver with that old rascal  every time he opens his &mdash;battery of a cough?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A smile that went through me like the cut of a knife,  flashed for a moment on her face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My father is in one of his impatient moods,&rdquo; said  she, &ldquo;you had better go. I hope you will be successful,&rdquo; she murmured, glancing  wistfully at my basket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; again came thundering on our ears. &ldquo;Successful?  What are you two up to?&rdquo; And we heard the rough clatter of advancing steps.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;you are weak and old; and when you  come back, try and not cough.&rdquo; And she gave me a gentle push towards the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When I come back,&rdquo; I began, but was forced to pause,  the elder Schoenmaker having by this time reached the open doorway where he  stood frowning in upon us in a way that made my heart stand still for her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are you two talking about?&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and what  have you got in your basket there?&rdquo; he continued with a stride forward that  shook the floor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only some little toys that he has been making, and is  now going out to sell,&rdquo; was her low answer given with a quick deprecatory  gesture such as I doubt if she ever used for herself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing more?&rdquo; asked he in German with a red glare in  the eye he turned towards her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing more,&rdquo; replied she in the same tongue. &ldquo;You  may believe me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He gave a deep growl and turned away. &ldquo;If there was,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;you know what would happen.&rdquo; And unheeding the wild keen shudder that  seized her at the word, making her insensible for the moment to all and  everything about her, he laid one heavy hand upon her slight shoulder and led  her from the room.</p>
  <p>I waited no longer than was necessary to carry my  feeble and faltering steps appropriately down the stairs, to reach the floor  below and gain the landlady&rsquo;s presence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you go up,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and sit on those stairs till  I come back. If you hear the least cry of pain or sound of struggle from that  young girl&rsquo;s room, do you call at once for help. I will have a policeman  standing on the corner below.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The good woman nodded and proceeded at once to take up  her work-basket. &ldquo;Lucky there&rsquo;s a window up there, so I can see,&rdquo; I heard her  mutter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no time to throw away even on deeds of charity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Notwithstanding which precaution, I was in constant  anxiety during my absence; an absence necessarily prolonged as I had to stop  and explain matters to the Superintendent, as well as hunt up Mr. Gryce and get  his consent to assist me in the matter of the impending arrest.</p>
  <p>I found the latter in his own home and more than  enthusiastic upon the subject.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he after I had informed him of the  discoveries I had made, &ldquo;the fates seem to prosper you in this. <i>I</i> have not  received an inkling of light upon the matter since I parted from you at Mr.  Blake&rsquo;s house. By the way I saw that gentleman this morning and I tell you we  will find him a grateful man if this affair can be resolved satisfactorily.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is good,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;gratitude is what we want.&rdquo;  Then shortly, &ldquo;Perhaps it is no more than our duty to let him know that his  wife is safe and under my eye; though I would by no means advocate his knowing  just how near him she is, till the moment comes when he is wanted, or we shall  have a lover&rsquo;s impetuosity to deal with as well as all the rest.&rdquo; Then with a  hurried remembrance of a possible contingency, went on to say, &ldquo;But, by the  way, in case we should need the cooperation of Mrs. Blake in what we have  before us, you had better get a line written in French from Mrs. Daniels,  expressive of her belief in Mr. Blake&rsquo;s present affection for his wife. The  latter will not otherwise trust us, or understand that we are to be obeyed in  whatever we may demand. Let it be unsigned and without names in case of  accident; and if the housekeeper don&rsquo;t understand French, tell her to get some  one to help her that does, only be sure that the handwriting employed is her  own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr. Gryce seemed to perceive the wisdom of this  precaution and promised to procure me such a note by a certain hour, after which  I related to him the various other details of the capture such as I had planned  it, meeting to my secret gratification an unqualified approval that went far  towards alleviating that wound to my pride which I had received from him in the  beginning of this affair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let all things proceed as you have determined, and we  shall accomplish something that it will be a life-long satisfaction to  remember,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but you must be prepared for some twist of the screw which  you do not anticipate. I never knew anything to go off just as one  prognosticates it must, except once,&rdquo; he added thoughtfully, &ldquo;and then it was  with a surprise attached to it that well nigh upset me notwithstanding all my  preparations.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You won a great success that day,&rdquo; remarked I. &ldquo;I  hope the fates will be as propitious to me to-morrow. Failure now would break  my heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t fail,&rdquo; exclaimed he. &ldquo;I myself am  resolved to see you through this matter with credit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And in this assurance I returned to my lodgings where  I found the landlady sitting where I had left her, darning her twenty-third  sock.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have to mend for a dozen men and three boys,&rdquo; said  she, &ldquo;and the boys are the worst by a heap sight. Look at that, will you,&rdquo;  holding up a darn with a bit of stocking attached. &ldquo;<i>That</i> hole was made playing  shinny.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I uttered my condolences and asked if any sound or  disturbance had reached her ears from above.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O no, all is right up there; I&rsquo;ve scarcely heard a  whisper since you&rsquo;ve been gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I gave her a pat on the chin scarcely consistent with  my aged and tottering mien and proceeded to shamble painfully to my room.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter17"></a><b>Chapter XVII<br>
    The Capture</b></h2>
  <p>Promptly next morning at the designated hour, came the  little note promised me by Mr. Gryce. It was put in my hand with many sly winks  by the landlady herself, who developed at this crisis quite an adaptation for,  if not absolute love of intrigue and mystery. Glancing over it&mdash;it was  unsealed&mdash;and finding it entirely unintelligible, I took it for granted it was  all right and put it by till chance, or if that failed, strategy, should give  me an opportunity to communicate with Mrs. Blake. An hour passed; the doors of  their rooms remained unclosed. A half hour more dragged its slow minutes away,  and no sound had come from their precincts save now and then a mumbled word of  parley between the father and son, a short command to the daughter, or a  not-to-be-restrained oath of annoyance from one or both of the heavy-limbed  brutes as something was said or done to disturb them in their indolent repose.  At last my impatience was to be no longer restrained. Rising, I took a bold  resolution. If the mountain would not come to Mahomet, Mahomet would go to the  mountain. Taking my letter in the hand, I deliberately proceeded to the door  marked with the ominous red cross and knocked.</p>
  <p>A surprised snarl from within, followed by a sudden  shuffling of feet as the two men leaped upright from what I presume had been a  recumbent position, warned me to be ready to face defiance if not the fury of  despair; and curbing with a determined effort the slight sinking of heart  natural to a man of my make on the threshold of a very doubtful adventure, I  awaited with as much apparent unconcern as possible, the quick advance of that  light foot which seemed to be ready to perform all the biddings of these  hardened wretches, much as it shrunk from following in the ways of their  infamy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah miss,&rdquo; said I, as the door opened revealing in the  gap her white face clouded with some new and sudden apprehension, &ldquo;I beg your  pardon but I am an old man, and I got a letter to-day and my eyes are so weak  with the work I&rsquo;ve been doing that I cannot read it. It is from some one I  love, and would you be so kind as to read off the words for me and so relieve  an old man from his anxiety.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The murmur of suspicion behind her, warned her to  throw wide open the door. &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;if I can,&rdquo; taking the paper  in her hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just let me get a squint at that first,&rdquo; said a  sullen voice behind her; and the youngest of the two Schoenmakers stepped  forward and tore the paper out of her grasp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are too suspicious,&rdquo; murmured she, looking after  him with the first assumption of that air of power and determination which I  had heard so eloquently described by the man who loved her. &ldquo;There is nothing  in those lines which concerns us; let me have them back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You hold your tongue,&rdquo; was the brutal reply as the  rough man opened the folded paper and read or tried to read what was written  within. &ldquo;Blast it! it&rsquo;s French,&rdquo; was his slow exclamation after a moment spent  in this way. &ldquo;See,&rdquo; and he thrust it towards his father who stood frowning  heavily a few feet off.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course, it&rsquo;s French,&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;Would you  write a note in English to father there? The man&rsquo;s friends are French like  himself, and must write in their own language.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here take it and read it out,&rdquo; commanded her father; &ldquo;and  mind you tell us what it means. I&rsquo;ll have nothing going on here that I don&rsquo;t  understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Read me the French words first, miss,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;It is  my letter and I want to know what my friend has to say to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nodding at me with a gentle look, she cast her eyes on  the paper and began to read:</p>
  <p class="letter">&ldquo;Calmez vous, mon amie, il vous aime et il vous  cherche. Dans quatre heures vous serez heureuse. Allons du courage,  et surtout soyez maitre de vous meme.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; I exclaimed in a calm matter-of-fact way as  I perceived the sudden tremor that seized her as she recognized the handwriting  and realized that the words were for her. &ldquo;My friend says he will pay my week&rsquo;s  rent and bids me be at home to receive him,&rdquo; said I, turning upon the two  ferocious faces peering over her shoulder, with a look of meek unsuspiciousness  in my eye, that in a theatre would have brought down the house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is that what those words say, you?&rdquo; asked the father,  pointing over her shoulder to the paper she held.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will translate for you word by word what it says,&rdquo;  replied she, nerving herself for the crisis till her face was like marble,  though I could see she could not prevent the gleam of secret rapture that had  visited her, from flashing fitfully across it. &ldquo;<i>Calmez vous, mon amie.</i> Do not  be afraid, my friend. <i>Il vous aime et il vous cherche</i>. He loves you and is  hunting for you. <i>Dans quatre heures vous serez heureuse</i>. In four hours you will  be happy. <i>Allons du courage, et surtout soyez maitre de vous meme</i>. Then take  courage and above all preserve your self-possession. It is the French way of  expressing one&rsquo;s self,&rdquo; observed she. &ldquo;I am glad your friend is disposed to  help you,&rdquo; she continued, giving me back the letter with a smile. &ldquo;I am afraid  you needed it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In a sort of maze I folded up the letter, bowed my  very humble thanks to her and shuffled slowly back. The fact is I had no words;  I was utterly dumbfounded. Half way through that letter, with whose contents  you must remember I was unacquainted, I would have given my whole chance of  expected reward to have stopped her. Read out such words as those before these  men! Was she crazy? But how naturally at the conclusion did she with a word  make its language seem consistent with the meaning I had given it. With a fresh  sense of my obligation to her, I hurried to my room, there to count out the  minutes of another long hour in anxious expectation of her making that endeavor  to communicate with me, which her new hopes and fears must force her to feel  almost necessary to her existence. At length, my confidence in her was  rewarded. Coming out into the hall, she hurried past my door, her finger on her  lip. I immediately rose and stood on the threshold with another paper in my  hand, which I had prepared against this opportunity. As she glided back, I put  it in her hand, and warning her with a look not to speak, resumed my usual  occupation. The words I had written were as follows:</p>
  <p class="newspaper">At or as near the time as possible of your brother&rsquo;s  going out, you are to come to this room wrapped in an extra skirt  and with your shawl over your head. Leave the skirt and shawl  behind you, and withdraw at once to the room at the head of the  stairs. You are not to speak, and you are not to vary from the  plan thus laid down. Your brother and father are to be arrested,  whether or no; but if you will do as this commands, they will be  arrested without bloodshed and without shame to <i>one you know</i>.</p>
  <p>Her face while she read these lines, was a study, but  I dared not soften toward it. Dropping the paper from her hand, she gave me one  inquiring look. But I pointed determinedly to the words lying upward on the  floor, and would listen to no appeal. My resolve had its effect. Bowing her  head with a sorrowful gesture, she laid her hand on her heart, looked up and  glided from the room. I took up that paper and tore it into bits.</p>
  <p>And now for the first time since I had been in the  house, I closed the door of my room. I had a part to perform that rendered the  dropping of my disguise indispensable. The old French artist had finished his  work, and henceforth must merge into Q. the detective. Shortly before two o&rsquo;clock  my assistants began to arrive. First, Mr. Gryce appeared on the scene and was  stowed away in a large room on the other side of mine. Next, two of the most  agile, as well as muscular men in the force who, thanks to having taken off  their shoes in the lower hall, gained the same refuge without awakening the  suspicions of those we were anxious to surprise. Lastly, the landlady who went  into the closet to which I had bidden Mrs. Blake retire after leaving in my  room the articles I had mentioned.</p>
  <p>All was now ready and waiting for the departure of the  youngest Schoenmaker. Would he disappoint us and remain at home that day? Had  any suspicions been awakened in the stolid breasts of these men, that would  serve to make them more watchful than usual against running unnecessary risks?  No; at or near the time for the clock to strike two, their door opened and the  tread of a lumbering foot was heard in the hall. On it came, passing my room  with a rude stamping that gradually grew less distinct as the hardy rough went  down the corridor, brushing the wall behind which Mr. Gryce and his men lay  concealed with his thick cane, and even stopping to light his pipe in front of  the small apartment where cowered our good landlady with her eternal basket of  mending in her lap.</p>
  <p>At length all was quiet, and throwing open my door, I  withdrew into a small closet connected with my room, to wait with indescribable  impatience, the appearance of Mrs. Blake. She came in a very few minutes,  remained for an instant, and departed, leaving behind her as I had requested,  the skirt and shawl in which she had left her father&rsquo;s presence. I at once  endued myself in these articles of apparel&mdash;taking care to draw the shawl well  over my head&mdash;and with a pocket handkerchief to my face, (a proceeding made  natural enough by the sneeze which at that very moment I took care should  assail me) walked boldly back to the room from which she had just come.</p>
  <p>The door was of course ajar, and as I swung it open  with as near a simulation of her manner as possible, the vision of her powerful  father lolling on a bench directly before me, offered anything but an  encouraging spectacle to my eyes. But doubling myself almost together with as  ladylike an <i>atch-ee</i> as my masculine nostrils would allow, I succeeded in  closing the door and reaching a low stool by the window without calling from  him anything worse than a fretful &ldquo;I hope you are not going to bark too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I did not reply to this of course, but sat with my  face turned towards the street in an attitude which I hoped would awaken his  attention sufficiently to cause him to get up and come over to my side. For as  he sat face to the door it would be impossible to take him by surprise, and  that, now that I saw what a huge and muscular creature he was, seemed to me to  be the only safe method before us. But, whether from the sullenness of his  disposition or the very evident laziness of the moment, he manifested no  disposition to move, and hearing or thinking I did, the stealthy advance of Mr.  Gryce and his companions down the hall, I allowed myself to give way to a  suppressed exclamation, and leaning forward, pressed my forehead against the  pane of glass before me as if something of absorbing interest had just taken  place in the street beneath.</p>
  <p>His fears at once took alarm. Bounding up with a  curse, he strode towards me, muttering,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up now? What&rsquo;s that you are looking at?&rdquo;  reaching my side just as Mr. Gryce and his two men softly opened the door and  with a quick leap threw their arms about him, closing upon him with a force he  could not resist, desperate as he was and mighty in the huge strength of an  unusually developed muscular organization.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You, you girl there, are to blame for this!&rdquo; came  mingled with curses from his lips, as with one huge pant he submitted to his  captors. &ldquo;Only let me get my hand well upon you once&mdash;Damn it!&rdquo; he suddenly  exclaimed, dragging the whole three men forward in his effort to get his mouth  down to my ear, &ldquo;go and rub that sign out on the door or I&rsquo;ll&mdash;you know what I&rsquo;ll  do well enough. Do you hear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Rising, still with face averted, I proceeded to do  what he asked. But in another moment seeing that he had been effectually bound  and gagged, I took out the piece of red chalk I had kept in my pocket, and  deliberately chalked it on again, after which operation I came back and took my  seat as before on the low stool by the window.</p>
  <p>The object now was to secure the second rascal in the  same way we had the first; and for this purpose Mr. Gryce ordered the now  helpless giant to be dragged into the adjoining small room formerly occupied by  Mrs. Blake, where he and his men likewise took up their station leaving me to  confront as best I might, the surprise and consternation of the one whose  return we now awaited.</p>
  <p>I did not shrink. With that brave woman&rsquo;s garments  drawn about me, something of her dauntless spirit seemed to invade my soul, and  though I expected&mdash;But let that come in its place, I am not here to interest you  in myself or my selfish thoughts.</p>
  <p>A half hour passed; he had never lingered away so long  before, or so it seemed, and I was beginning to wonder if we should have to  keep up this strain of nerve for hours, when the heavy tread was again heard in  the hall, and with a blow of the fist that argued anger or a brutal impatience,  he flung open the door and came in, I did not turn my head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s father?&rdquo; he growled, stopping where he was a  foot or so from the door.</p>
  <p>I shook my head with a slight gesture and remained  looking out.</p>
  <p>He brought his cane down on the floor with a thump. &ldquo;What  do you mean by sitting there staring out of the window like mad and not  answering when I ask you a decent question?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Still I made no reply.</p>
  <p>Provoked beyond endurance, yet held in check by that  vague sense of danger in the air,&mdash;which while not amounting to apprehension is  often sufficient to hold back from advance the most daring foot,&mdash;he stood  glaring at me in what I felt to be a very ferocious attitude, but made no offer  to move. Instantly I rose and still looking out of the window, made with my  hand what appeared to be a signal to some one on the opposite side of the way.  The ruse was effective. With an oath that rings in my ears yet, he lifted his  heavy cane and advanced upon me with a bound, only to meet the same fate as his  father at the hands of the watchful detectives. Not, however, before that heavy  cane came down upon my head in a way to lay me in a heap at his feet and to sow  the seeds of that blinding head-ache, which has afflicted me by spells ever  since. But this termination of the affair was no more than I had feared from  the beginning; and indeed it was as much to protect Mrs. Blake from the wrath  of these men, as from any requirements of the situation I had assumed the  disguise I then wore. I therefore did not allow this mishap to greatly trouble  me, unpleasant as it was at the time, but, as soon as ever I could do so, rose  from the floor and throwing off my strange habiliments, proceeded to finish up  to my satisfaction, the work already so successfully begun.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter18"></a><b>Chapter XVIII<br>
    Love And Duty</b></h2>
  <p>Dismissing the men who had assisted us in the capture  of these two hardy villains, we ranged our prisoners before us.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Mr. Gryce, &ldquo;no fuss and no swearing; you  are in for it, and you might as well take it quietly as any other way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give me a clutch on that girl, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said her  father, &ldquo;Where is she? Let me see her; every father has a right to see his own  daughter,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You shall see her,&rdquo; returned my superior, &ldquo;but not  till her husband is here to protect her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her husband? ah, you know about that do you?&rdquo; growled  the heavy voice of the son. &ldquo;A rich man they say he is and a proud one. Let him  come and look at us lying here like dogs and say how he will enjoy having his  wife&rsquo;s father and brother grinding away their lives in prison.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Blake <i>is</i> coming,&rdquo; quoth Mr. Gryce, who by some  preconcerted signal from the window had drawn that gentleman across the street.  &ldquo;He will tell you himself that he considers prison the best place for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&quot;Blast you! but he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But he, what?&rdquo; inquired I, as the door opened and Mr.  Blake with a pale face and agitated mien entered the room.</p>
  <p>The wretch did not answer. Rousing from the cowering  position in which they had both lain since their capture, the father and son  struggled up in some sort of measure to their feet, and with hot, anxious eyes  surveyed the countenance of the gentleman before them, as if they felt their  fate hung upon the expression of his pallid face. The son was the first to  speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you do, brother-in-law,&rdquo; were his sullen and  insulting words.</p>
  <p>Mr. Blake shuddered and cast a look around.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My wife?&rdquo; murmured he.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She is well,&rdquo; was the assurance given by Mr. Gryce, &ldquo;and  in a room not far from this. I will send for her if you say so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, not yet,&rdquo; came in a sort of gasp; &ldquo;let me look at  these wretches first, and understand if I can what my wife has to suffer from  her connection with them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your wife,&rdquo; broke in the father, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s that to do  with it; the question is how do you like it and what will you do to get us  clear of this thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will do nothing,&rdquo; returned Mr. Blake. &ldquo;You amply  merit your doom and you shall suffer it to the end for all time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It will read well in the papers,&rdquo; exclaimed the son.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The papers are to know nothing about it,&rdquo; I broke in.  &ldquo;All knowledge of your connection with Mr. or Mrs. Blake is to be buried in  this spot before we or you leave it. Not a word of her or him is to cross the  lips of either of you from this hour. I have set that down as a condition and  it has got to be kept.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have, have you,&rdquo; thundered in chorus from father  and son. &ldquo;And who are you to make conditions, and what do you think we are that  you expect us to keep them? Can you do anymore than put us back from where we  came from?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For reply I took from my pocket the ring I had fished  out of the ashes of their kitchen stove on that memorable visit to their house,  and holding it up before their faces, looked them steadily in the eye.</p>
  <p>A sudden wild glare followed by a bluish palor that  robbed their countenances of their usual semblance of daring ferocity, answered  me beyond my fondest hopes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I got that out of the stove where you had burned your  prison clothing,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;It is a cheap affair, but it will send you to the  gallows if I choose to use it against you. The pedlar&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; exclaimed the father in a low choked tone  greatly in contrast to any he had yet used in all our dealings with him. &ldquo;Throw  that ring out of the window and I promise to hold my tongue about any matter  you don&rsquo;t want spoke of. I&rsquo;m not a fool&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; was my quick reply, as I restored the ring to  my pocket. &ldquo;While that remains in my possession together with certain facts  concerning your habits in that old house of yours which have lately been made  known to me, your life hangs by a thread I can any minute snip in two. Mr.  Blake here, has spent some portion of a night in your house and knows how near  it lies to a certain precipice, at foot of which&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mein Gott, father, why don&rsquo;t you say something!&rdquo;  leaped in cowed accents from the son&rsquo;s white lips. &ldquo;If they want us to keep  quiet, let them say so and not go talking about things that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now look here,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Gryce stepping before  them with a look that closed their mouths at once. &ldquo;I will just tell you what  we propose to do. You are to go back to prison and serve your time out, there  is no help for that, but as long as you behave yourselves and continue  absolutely silent regarding your relationship to the wife of this gentleman,  you shall have paid into a certain bank that he will name, a monthly sum that  upon your dismissal from jail shall be paid you with whatever interest it may  have accumulated. You are ready to promise that, are you not?&rdquo; he inquired  turning to Mr. Blake.</p>
  <p>That gentleman bowed and named the sum, which was  liberal enough, and the bank.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued the detective, ignoring the sudden  flash of eye that passed between the father and son, &ldquo;let me or any of us hear  of a word having been uttered by you, which in the remotest way shall suggest  that you have in the world such a connection as Mrs. Blake, and the money not  only stops going into the bank, but old scores shall be raked up against you  with a zeal which if it does not stop your mouth in one way, will in another, and  that with a suddenness you will not altogether relish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The men with a dogged air from which the bravado had  however fled, turned and looked from one to the other of us in a fearful,  inquiring way that duly confessed to the force of the impression made by these  words upon their slow but not unimaginative minds.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you three promise to keep our secret if we keep  yours?&rdquo; muttered the father with an uneasy glance at my pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We certainly do,&rdquo; was our solemn return.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well; call in the girl and let me just look at  her, then, before we go. We won&rsquo;t say nothing,&rdquo; continued he, seeing Mr. Blake  shrink, &ldquo;only she is my daughter and if I cannot bid her good-bye&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let him see his child,&rdquo; cried Mr. Blake turning with  a shudder to the window. &ldquo;I&mdash;I wish it,&rdquo; added he.</p>
  <p>Straightway with hasty foot I left the room. Going to  the little closet where I had ordered his wife to remain concealed, I knocked  and entered. She was crouched in an attitude of prayer on the floor, her face  buried in her hands, and her whole person breathing that agony of suspense that  is a torture to the sensitive soul.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Blake,&rdquo; said I, dismissing the landlady who  stood in helpless distress beside her, &ldquo;the arrest has been satisfactorily made  and your father calls for you to say good-bye before going away with us. Will  you come?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But my&mdash;my&mdash;Mr. Blake?&rdquo; exclaimed she leaping to her  feet. &ldquo;I am sure I heard his footstep in the hall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is with your father and brother. It was at his  command I came for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A gleam hard to interpret flashed for an instant over  her face. With her eye on the door she towered in her womanly dignity, while  thoughts innumerable seemed to rush in wild succession through her mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you not come?&rdquo; I urged.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;,&rdquo; she paused. &ldquo;I will go see my father,&rdquo; she  murmured, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Suddenly she trembled and drew back; a step was in the  hall, on the threshold, at her side; Mr. Blake had come to reclaim his bride.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Blake!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The word came from her in a low tone shaken with the  concentrated anguish of many a month of longing and despair, but there was no  invitation in its sound, and he who had held out his arms, stopped and  surveying her with a certain deprecatory glance in his proud eye, said,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are right; I have first my acknowledgments to  make and your forgiveness to ask before I can hope&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she broke in, &ldquo;your coming here is enough, I  request no more. If you felt unkindly toward me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unkindly?&rdquo; A world of love thrilled in that word. &ldquo;Luttra,  I am your husband and rejoice that I am so; it is to lay the devotion of my  heart and life at your feet that I seek your presence this hour. The year has  taught me&mdash;ah, what has not the year taught me of the worth of her I so  recklessly threw from me on my wedding day. Luttra,&rdquo;&mdash;he held out his hand&mdash;&ldquo;will  you crown all your other acts of devotion with a pardon that will restore me to  my manhood and that place in your esteem which I covet above every other  earthly good?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her face which had been raised to his with that  earnest look we knew so well, softened with an ineffable smile, but still she  did not lay her hand in his.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you say this to me in the very hour of my father&rsquo;s  and brother&rsquo;s arrest! With the remembrance in your mind of their bound and  abject forms lying before you guarded by police; knowing too, that they deserve  their ignominy and the long imprisonment that awaits them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I say it on the day of the discovery and the  restoration of that wife for whom I have long searched, and to whom when found  I have no word to give but welcome, welcome, welcome.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With the same deep smile she bowed her head, &ldquo;Now let  come what will, I can never again be unhappy,&rdquo; were the words I caught, uttered  in the lowest of undertones. But in another moment her head had regained its  steady poise and a great change had passed over her manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Blake,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you are good; how good, I  alone can know and duly appreciate who have lived in your house this last year  and seen with eyes that missed nothing, just what your surroundings are and  have been from the earliest years of your proud life. But goodness must not  lead you into the committal of an act you must and will repent to your dying  day; or if it does, I who have learned my duty in the school of adversity, must  show the courage of two and forbid what every secret instinct of my soul  declares to be only provocative of shame and sorrow. You would take me to your  heart as your wife; do you realize what that means?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think I do,&rdquo; was his earnest reply. &ldquo;Relief from  heart-ache, Luttra.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her smooth brow wrinkled with a sudden spasm of pain  but her firm lips did not quiver.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It means,&rdquo; said she, drawing nearer but not with that  approach which indicates yielding, &ldquo;it means, shame to the proudest family that  lives in the land. It means silence as regards a past blotted by suggestions of  crime; and apprehension concerning a future across which the shadow of prison  walls must for so many years lie. It means, the hushing of certain words upon  beloved lips; the turning of cherished eyes from visions where fathers and  daughters ay, brothers and sisters are seen joined together in tender  companionship or loving embrace. It means,&mdash;God help me to speak out&mdash;a home  without the sanctity of memories; a husband without the honors he has been  accustomed to enjoy; a wife with a fear gnawing like a serpent into her breast;  and children, yes, perhaps children from whose innocent lips the sacred word of  grandfather can never fall without wakening a blush on the cheeks of their  parents, which all their lovesome prattle will be helpless to chase away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Luttra, your father and your brother have given their  consent to go their dark way alone and trouble you no more. The shadow you  speak of may lie on your heart, dear wife, for these men are of your own blood,  but it need never invade the hearthstone beside which I ask you to sit. The  world will never know, whether you come with me or not, that Luttra Blake was  ever Luttra Schoenmaker. Will you not then give me the happiness of striving to  make such amends for the past, that you too, will forget you ever bore any other  name than the one you now honor so truly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O do not,&rdquo; she began but paused with a sudden control  of her emotion that lifted her into an atmosphere almost holy in its  significance. &ldquo;Mr. Blake,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I am a woman and therefore weak to the  voice of love pleading in my ear. But in one thing I am strong, and that is in  my sense of what is due to the man I have sworn to honor. Eleven months ago I  left you because your pleasure and my own dignity demanded it; to-day I put by  all the joy and exaltation you offer, because your position as a gentleman, and  your happiness as a man equally requires it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My happiness as a man!&rdquo; he broke in. &ldquo;Ah, Luttra if  you love me as I do you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I might perhaps yield,&rdquo; she allowed with a faint  smile. &ldquo;But I love you as a girl brought up amid surroundings from which her  whole being recoiled, must love the one who first brought light into her  darkness and opened up to her longing feet the way to a life of culture, purity  and honor. I were the basest of women could I consent to repay such a boundless  favor&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Luttra,&rdquo; he again broke in, &ldquo;you married me  knowing what your father and brother were capable of committing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; I was blinded by passion, a girl&rsquo;s passion,  Mr. Blake, born of glamour and gratitude; not the self-forgetting devotion of a  woman who has tasted the bitterness of life and so learned its lesson of  sacrifice. I may not have thought, certainly I did not realize, what I was  doing. Besides, my father and brother were not convicted criminals at that time,  however weak they had proved themselves under temptation. And then I believed I  had left them behind me on the road of life; that we were sundered, irrevocably  cut loose from all possible connection. But such ties are not to be snapped so  easily. They found me, you see, and they will find me again&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; exclaimed her husband. &ldquo;They are as dead to  you as if the grave had swallowed them. I have taken care of that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the shame! you have not taken care of that. That  exists and must, and while it does I remain where I can meet it alone. I love  you; God&rsquo;s sun is not dearer to my eyes; but I will never cross your threshold  as your wife till the opprobrium can be cut loose from my skirts, and the  shadow uplifted from my brow. A queen with high thoughts in her eyes and brave  hopes in her heart were not too good to enter that door with you. Shall a girl  who has lived three weeks in an atmosphere of such crime and despair, that  these rooms have often seemed to me the gateway to hell, carry there, even in  secrecy, the effects of that atmosphere? I will cherish your goodness in my  heart but do not ask me to bury that heart in any more exalted spot, than some  humble country home, where my life may be spent in good deeds and my love in  prayers for the man I hold dear, and because I hold dear, leave to his own high  path among the straight and unshadowed courses of the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And with a gesture that inexorably shut him off while  it expressed the most touching appeal, she glided by him and took her way to  the room where her father and brother awaited her presence.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter19"></a><b>Chapter XIX<br>
    Explanations</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;I cannot endure this,&rdquo; came in one burst of feeling  from the lips of Mr. Blake. &ldquo;She don&rsquo;t know, she don&rsquo;t realize&mdash;Sir,&rdquo; cried he,  suddenly becoming conscious of my presence in the room, &ldquo;will you be good  enough to see that this note,&rdquo; he hastily scribbled one, &ldquo;is carried across the  way to my house and given to Mrs. Daniels.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I bowed assent, routed up one of the men in the next  room and despatched it at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps she will listen to the voice of one of her  own sex if not to me,&rdquo; said he; and began pacing the floor of the narrow room  in which we were, with a wildness of impatience that showed to what depths had  sunk the hope of gaining this lovely woman for his own.</p>
  <p>Feeling myself no longer necessary in that spot, I  followed where my wishes led and entered the room where Luttra was bidding  good-bye to her father.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shall never forget,&rdquo; I heard her say as I crossed  the floor to where Mr. Gryce stood looking out of the window, &ldquo;that your blood  runs in my veins together with that of my gentle-hearted, never-to-be-forgotten  mother. Whatever my fate may be or wherever I may hide the head you have bowed  to the dust, be sure I shall always lift up my hands in prayer for your  repentance and return to an honest life. God grant that my prayers may be heard  and that I may yet receive at your hands, a father&rsquo;s kindly blessing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The only answer to this was a heavily muttered growl  that gave but little promise of any such peaceful termination to a deeply  vicious life. Hearing it, Mr. Gryce hastened to procure his men and remove the  hardened wretches from the spot. All through the preparations for their  departure, she stood and watched their sullen faces with a wild yearning in her  eye that could scarcely be denied, but when the door finally closed upon them,  and she was left standing there with no one in the room but myself she steadied  herself up as one who is conscious that all the storms of heaven are about to  break upon her; and turning slowly to the door waited with arms crossed and a  still determination upon her brow, the coming of the feet of him whose resolve  she felt must have, as yet been only strengthened by her resistance.</p>
  <p>She had not long to wait. Almost with the closing of  the street door upon the detectives and their prisoners, Mr. Blake followed by  Mrs. Daniels and another lady whose thick veil and long cloak but illy  concealed the patrician features and stately form of the Countess De Mirac,  entered the room.</p>
  <p>The surprise had its effect; Luttra was evidently for  the moment thrown off her guard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Daniels!&rdquo; she breathed, holding out her hands  with a longing gesture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My dear mistress!&rdquo; returned that good woman, taking  those hands in hers but in a respectful way that proved the constraint imposed  upon her by Mr. Blake&rsquo;s presence. &ldquo;Do I see you again and safe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must have thought I cared little for the anxiety  you would be sure to feel,&rdquo; said that fair young mistress, gazing with  earnestness into the glad but tearful eyes of the housekeeper. &ldquo;But indeed, I  have been in no position to communicate with you, nor could I do so without  risking that to protect which I so outraged my feelings as to leave the house  at all. I mean the life and welfare of its master, Mrs. Daniels.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha, what is that?&rdquo; quoth Mr. Blake. &ldquo;It was to save  me, you consented to follow them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; what else would have led me to such an action?  They might have killed me, I would not have cared, but when they began to utter  threats against you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Blake,&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Daniels, catching hold of  her mistress&rsquo;s uplifted hand, and pointing to a scar that slightly disfigured  her white arm a little above the wrist, &ldquo;Mrs. Blake, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A pink flush, the first I had seen on her usually pale  countenance, rose for an instant to her cheeks, and she seemed to hesitate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was not there when I last saw you, Mrs. Blake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the slow reply, &ldquo;I found myself forced that  night to inflict upon myself a little wound. It is nothing, let it go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Luttra I cannot let it go,&rdquo; said her husband,  advancing towards her with something like gentle command. &ldquo;I must hear not only  about this but all the other occurrences of that night. How came they to find  you in the refuge you had attained?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said she in a low tone the underlying  suffering of which it would be hard to describe, &ldquo;that it was not to seek me  they first invaded your house. They had heard you were a rich man, and the  sight of that ladder running up the side of the new extension was too much for  them. Indeed I know that it was for purposes of robbery they came, for they had  hired this room opposite you some days previous to making the attempt. You see  they were almost destitute of money and though they had some buried in the  cellar of the old house in Vermont, they dared not leave the city to procure  it. My brother was obliged to do so later, however. It was a surprise to them  seeing me in your house. They had reached the roof of the extension and were  just lifting up the corner of the shade I had dropped across the open window&mdash;I  always open my window a few minutes before preparing to retire&mdash;when I rose from  the chair in which I had been brooding, and turned up the gas. I was combing my  hair at the time and so of course they recognized me. Instantly they gave a  secret signal I, alas, remembered only too well, and crouching back, bade me  put out the light that they might enter with safety. I was at first too much  startled to realize the consequences of my action, and with some vague idea  that they had discovered my retreat and come for purposes of advice or  assistance, I did what they bid. Immediately they threw back the shade and came  in, their huge figures looming frightfully in the faint light made by a distant  gas lamp in the street below. &lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo; were my first words uttered  in a voice I scarcely recognized for my own; &lsquo;why do you steal on me like this  in the night and through an open window fifty feet from the ground? Aren&rsquo;t you  afraid you will be discovered and sent back to the prison from which you have  escaped?&rsquo; Their reply sent a chill through my blood and awoke me to a  realization of what I had done in thus allowing two escaped convicts to enter a  house not my own. &lsquo;We want money and we&rsquo;re not afraid of anything now you are  here.&rsquo; And without heeding my exclamation of horror, they coolly told me that  they would wait where they were till the household was asleep, when they would  expect me to show them the way to the silver closet or what was better, the  safe or wherever it was Mr. Blake kept his money. I saw they took me for a  servant, as indeed I was, and for some minutes I managed to preserve that  position in their eyes. But when in a sudden burst of rage at my refusal to  help them, they pushed me aside and hurried to the door with the manifest  intention of going below, I forgot prudence in my fears and uttered some wild  appeal to them not to do injury to any one in the house for it was my husband&rsquo;s.  Of course that disclosure had its natural effect.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They stopped, but only to beset me with questions  till the whole truth came out. I could not have committed a worse folly than  thus taking them into my confidence. Instantly the advantages to be gained by  using my secret connection with so wealthy a man for the purpose of cowering me  and blackmailing him, seemed to strike both their minds at once, slow as they  usually are to receive impressions. The silver-closet and money-safe sank to a  comparatively insignificant position in their eyes, and to get me out of the  house, and with my happiness at stake, treat with the honorable man who  notwithstanding his non-approval of me as a woman, still regarded me as his  lawfully wedded wife, became in their eyes a thing of such wonderful promise  they were willing to run any and every risk to test its value. But here to  their great astonishment I rebelled; astonishment because they could not  realize my desiring anything above money and the position to which they  declared I was by law entitled. In vain I pleaded my love; in vain I threatened  exposure of their plans if not whereabouts. The mine of gold which they fondly  believed they had stumbled upon unawares, promised too richly to be easily  abandoned. &lsquo;You must go with us,&rsquo; said they, &lsquo;if not peaceably then by force,&rsquo;  and they actually advanced upon me, upsetting a chair and tearing down one of  the curtains to which I clung. It was then I committed that little act  concerning which you questioned me. I wanted to show them I was not to be moved  by threats of that character; that I did not even fear the shedding of my blood;  and that they would only be wasting their time in trying to sway me by hints of  personal violence. And they were a little impressed, sufficiently so at least  to turn their threats in another direction, awakening fears at last which I  could not conceal, much as I felt it would be policy to do so. Gathering up a  few articles I most prized, my wedding ring, Mr. Blake, and a photograph of  yourself that Mrs. Daniels had been kind enough to give me, I put on my bonnet  and cloak and said I would go with them, since they persisted in requiring it.  The fact is I no longer possessed motive or strength to resist. Even your  unexpected appearance at the door, Mrs. Daniels, offered no prospect of hope.  Arouse the house? what would that do? only reveal my cherished secret and  perhaps jeopardize the life of my husband. Besides, they were my own near kin,  remember, and so had some little claim upon my consideration, at least to the  point of my not personally betraying them unless they menaced immediate and  actual harm. The escape by the window which would have been a difficult task  for most women to perform, was easy enough for me. I was brought up to wild  ways you know, and the descent of a ladder forty feet long was a comparatively  trivial thing for me to accomplish. It was the tearing away from a life of  silent peace, the reentrance of my soul into an atmosphere of sin and deadly  plotting, that was the hard thing, the difficult dreadful thing which hung  weights to my feet, and made me well nigh mad. And it was this which at the  sight of a policeman in the street led me to make an effort to escape. But it  was not successful. Though I was fortunate enough to free myself from the grasp  of my father and brother, I reached the gate on&mdash;street only to encounter the  eyes of him whose displeasure I most feared, looking sternly upon me from the  other side. The shock was too much for me in my then weak and unnerved  condition. Without considering anything but the fact that he never had known  and never must, that I had been in the same house with him for so long, I  rushed back to the corner and into the arms of the men who awaited me. How you  came to be there, Mr. Blake, or why you did not open the gate and follow, I  cannot say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The gate was locked,&rdquo; returned that gentleman. &ldquo;You  remember it closes with a spring, and can only be opened by means of a key  which I did not have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My father had it,&rdquo; she murmured; &ldquo;he spent a whole  week in the endeavor to get hold of it, and finally succeeded on the evening of  the very day he used it. It was left in the lock I believe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So much for servants,&rdquo; I whispered to myself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The next morning,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;they put the case  very plainly before me. I was at liberty to return at once to my home if I  would promise to work in their interest by making certain demands upon you as  your wife. All they wanted, said they, was a snug little sum and a lift out of  the country. If I would secure them these, they would trouble me no more. But I  could not concede to anything of that nature, of course, and the consequence  was these long weeks of imprisonment and suspense; weeks that I do not now  begrudge, seeing they have brought me the assurance of your esteem and the  knowledge, that wherever I go, your thoughts will follow me with compassion if  not with love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And having told her story and thus answered his  demands, she assumed once more the position of lofty reserve that seemed to  shut him back from advance like a wall of invincible crystal.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter20"></a><b>Chapter XX<br>
    The Bond That Unites</b></h2>
  <p>But he was not to be discouraged. &ldquo;And after all this,  after all you have suffered for my sake and your own, do you think you have a  right to deny me the one desire of my heart? How can you reconcile it with your  ideas of devotion, Luttra?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My ideas of devotion look beyond the present, Mr.  Blake. It is to save you from years of wearing anxiety that I consent to the  infliction upon you of a passing pang.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He took a bold step forward. &ldquo;Luttra, you do not know  a man&rsquo;s heart. To lose you now would not merely inflict a passing pang, but sow  the seeds of a grief that would go with me to the grave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you then&rdquo;&mdash;she began, but paused blushing. Mrs.  Daniels took the opportunity to approach her on the other side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My dear mistress,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you are wrong to hold  out in this matter.&rdquo; And her manner betrayed something of the peculiar  agitation that had belonged to it in the former times of her secret  embarassment. &ldquo;I, who have honored the family which I have so long served,  above every other in the land, tell you that you can do it no greater good than  to join it now, or inflict upon it any greater harm than to wilfully withdraw  yourself from the position in which God has placed you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said another voice, that of the Countess de  Mirac, who up to this time had held herself in the background, but who now came  forward and took her place with the rest, &ldquo;I, who have borne the name of Blake,  and who am still the proudest of them all at heart, I, the Countess de Mirac,  cousin to your husband there, repeat what this good woman has said, and in  holding out my hand to you, ask you to make my cousin happy and his family  contented by assuming that position in his household which the law as well as  his love accords you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The girl looked at the daintily gloved hand held out  to her, colored faintly, and put her own within it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thank you for your goodness,&rdquo; said she, surveying  with half-sad, half-admiring glances, the somewhat pale face of the beautiful  brunette.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you will yield to our united requests?&rdquo; She cast  her eye down at the spot where her father and brother had cowered in their  shackles, and shook her head. &ldquo;I dare not,&rdquo; said she.</p>
  <p>Immediately Mrs. Daniels, whose emotion had been  increasing every moment since she last spoke, plunged her hand into her bosom  and drew out a folded paper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Blake,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;if you could be convinced  that what I have told you was true, and that you would be irretrievably  injuring your husband and his interests, by persisting in that desertion of him  which you purpose, would you not consent to reconsider your determination,  settled as it appears to be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I could be made to see that, most certainly,&rdquo;  returned she in a low voice whose broken accents betrayed at what cost she  remained true to her resolve. &ldquo;But I cannot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps the sight of this paper will help you,&rdquo; said  she. And turning to Mr. Blake she exclaimed, &ldquo;Your pardon for what I am called  upon to do. A duty has been laid upon me which I cannot avoid, hard as it is  for an old servant to perform. This paper&mdash;but it is no more than just that you,  sir, should see and read it first.&rdquo; And with a hand that quivered with fear or  some equally strong emotion, she put it in his clasp.</p>
  <p>The exclamation that rewarded the act made us all  start forward. &ldquo;My father&rsquo;s handwriting!&rdquo; were his words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Executed under my eye,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Daniels.</p>
  <p>His glance ran rapidly down the sheet and rested upon  the final signature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why has this been kept from me?&rdquo; demanded he, turning  upon Mrs. Daniels with sternness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your father so willed it,&rdquo; was her reply. &ldquo;&lsquo;For a  year&rsquo; was his command, &lsquo;you shall keep this my last will and testament which I  give into your care with my dying hands, a secret from the world. At the  expiration of that time mark if my son&rsquo;s wife sits at the head of her husband&rsquo;s  table; if she does and is happy, suppress this by deliberately giving it to the  flames, but if from any reason other than death, she is not seen there, carry  it at once to my son, and bid him as he honors my memory, to see that my wishes  as there expressed are at once carried out.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The paper in Mr. Blake&rsquo;s hand fluttered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are aware what those wishes are?&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I steadied his hand while he wrote,&rdquo; was her sad and  earnest reply.</p>
  <p>Mr. Blake turned with a look of inexpressible  deference to his wife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said he &ldquo;when I urged you with such warmth  to join your fate to mine and honor my house by presiding over it, I thought I  was inviting you to share the advantages of wealth as well as the love of a  lonely man&rsquo;s heart. This paper undeceives me. Luttra, the daughter-in-law of  Abner Blake, not Holman, his son, is the one who by the inheritance of his  millions has the right to command in this presence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With a cry she took from him the will whose purport  was thus briefly made known. &ldquo;O, how could he, how could he?&rdquo; exclaimed she,  running her eye down the sheet, and then crushing it spasmodically to her  breast. &ldquo;Did he not realize that he could do me no greater wrong?&rdquo; Then in one  yielding up of her whole womanhood to the mighty burst of passion that had been  flooding the defenses of her heart for so long, she exclaimed in a voice the  mingled rapture and determination of which rings in my ears even now, &ldquo;And is  it a thing like this with its suggestions of mercenary interest that shall  bridge the gulf that separates you and me? Shall the giving or the gaining of a  fortune make necessary the unital of lives over which holier influences have  beamed and loftier hopes shone? No, no; by the smile with which your dying  father took me to his breast, love alone, with the hope and confidence it  gives, shall be the bond to draw us together and make of the two separate  planes on which we stand, a common ground where we can meet and be happy.&rdquo;</p>

It was an act that  merits the gratitude of years, and as such shall be always remembered by me. If  the old French artist with the racking cough ever desires a favor at my hands,  let him feel free to ask it. The interest I experienced in him in the days of  my trouble, will suffer no abatement in these of my joy and prosperity.&rdquo; And  with a look that was more than words, she gave me a flower from the bouquet she  held in her hand, and smilingly withdrew.</p>
