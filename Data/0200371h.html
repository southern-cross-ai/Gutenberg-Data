<h2><a name="part_1" id="part_1">THE ETERNAL LOVER</a>
</h2>

<h2><a name="cha1" id="cha1">I. &mdash; NU OF THE NIOCENE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Nu the son of Nu, his mighty muscles rolling
beneath his smooth bronzed skin, moved silently through the jungle
primeval. His handsome head with its shock of black hair, roughly
cropped between sharpened stones, was high held, the delicate
nostrils questioning each vagrant breeze for word of Oo, hunter of
men.</p>

<p>Now his trained senses catch the familiar odor of Ta, the great
woolly rhinoceros, directly in his path, but Nu, the son of Nu,
does not hunt Ta this day. Does not the hide of Ta's brother
already hang before the entrance of Nu's cave? No, today Nu hunts
the gigantic cat, the fierce saber-toothed tiger, Oo, for Nat-ul,
wondrous daughter of old Tha, will mate with none but the mightiest
of hunters.</p>

<p>Only so recently as the last darkness, as, beneath the great,
equatorial moon, the two had walked hand in hand beside the
restless sea she had made it quite plain to Nu, the son of Nu, that
not even he, son of the chief of chiefs, could claim her unless
there hung at the thong of his loin cloth the fangs of Oo.</p>

<p>"Nat-ul," she had said to him, "wishes her man to be greater
than other men. She loves Nu now better than her very life, but if
Love is to walk at her side during a long life Pride and Respect
must walk with it." Her slender hand reached up to stroke the young
giant's black hair. "I am very proud of my Nu even now," she
continued, "for among all the young men of the tribe there is no
greater hunter, or no mightier fighter than Nu, the son of Nu.
Should you, single-handed, slay Oo before a grown man's beard has
darkened your cheek there will be none greater in all the world
than Nat-ul's mate, Nu, the son of Nu."</p>

<p>The young man was still sensible to the sound of her soft voice
and the caress of her gentle touch upon his brow. As these things
had sent him speeding forth into the savage jungle in search of Oo
while the day was still so young that the night-prowling beasts of
prey were yet abroad, so they urged him forward deeper and deeper
into the dark and trackless mazes of the tangled forest.</p>

<p>As he forged on the scent of Ta became stronger, until at last
the huge, ungainly beast loomed large before Nu's eyes. He was
standing in a little clearing, in deep, rank jungle grasses and had
he not been head on toward Nu he would not have seen him, since
even his acute hearing was far too dull to apprehend the noiseless
tread of the cave man, moving lightly up wind.</p>

<p>As the tiny, blood-shot eyes of the primordial beast discovered
the man the great head went down, and Ta, ill-natured and bellicose
progenitor of the equally ill-natured and bellicose rhino of the
twentieth century, charged the lithe giant who had disturbed his
antediluvian meditation.</p>

<p>The creature's great bulk and awkward, uncouth lines belied his
speed, for he tore down upon Nu with all the swiftness of a
thoroughbred and had not the brain and muscle of the troglodyte
been fitted by heritage and training to the successful meeting of
such emergencies there would be no tale to tell today of Nu of the
Niocene.</p>

<p>But the young man was prepared, and turning he ran with the
swiftness of a hare toward the nearest tree, a huge, arboraceous
fern towering upon the verge of the little clearing. Like a cat the
man ran up the perpendicular bole, his hands and feet seeming
barely to touch the projecting knobs marking the remains of former
fronds which converted the towering stem into an easy stairway for
such as he.</p>

<p>About Nu's neck his stone-tipped spear hung by its rawhide thong
down his back, while stone hatchet and stone knife dangled from his
G-string, giving him free use of his hands for climbing. You or I,
having once gained the seeming safety of the lowest fronds of the
great tree, fifty feet above the ground, might have heaved a great
sigh of relief that we had thus easily escaped the hideous monster
beneath; but not so Nu, who was wise to the ways of the creatures
of his remote age.</p>

<p>Not one whit did he abate his speed as he neared the lowest
branch, nor did he even waste a precious second in a downward
glance at his enemy. What need, indeed? Did he not know precisely
what Ta would do? Instead he swung, monkey-like, to the broad leaf,
and though the chances he took would have paled the face of a brave
man today they did not cause Nu even to hesitate, as he ran lightly
and swiftly along the bending, swaying frond, leaping just at the
right instant toward the bole of a nearby jungle giant.</p>

<p>Nor was he an instant too soon. The frond from which he had
sprung had scarce whipped up from beneath his weight when Ta, with
all the force and momentum of a runaway locomotive, struck the base
of the tree head on. The jar of that terrific collision shook the
earth, there was the sound of the splintering of wood, and the
mighty tree toppled to the ground with a deafening crash.</p>

<p>Nu, from an adjoining tree, looked down and grinned. He was not
hunting Ta that day, and so he sprang from tree to tree until he
had passed around the clearing, and then, coming to the surface
once more, continued his way toward the distant lava cliffs where
Oo, the man hunter, made his grim lair.</p>

<p>From among the tangled creepers through which the man wormed his
sinuous way ugly little eyes peered down upon him from beneath
shaggy, beetling brows, and great fighting tusks were bared, as the
hairy ones growled and threatened from above; but Nu paid not the
slightest attention to the huge, ferocious creatures that menaced
him upon every hand. From earliest childhood he had been accustomed
to the jabberings and scoldings of the ape-people, and so he knew
that if he went his way in peace, harming them not, they would
offer him no harm. One of lesser experience might have attempted to
drive them away with menacing spear, or well-aimed hatchet, and
thus have drawn down upon him a half-dozen or more ferocious bulls
against which no single warrior, however doughty, might have lived
long enough to count his antagonists.</p>

<p>Threatening and unfriendly as the apes seemed the cave man
really looked upon them as friends and allies, since between them
and his own people there existed a species of friendly alliance,
due no doubt to the similarity of their form and structure. In that
long gone age when the world was young and its broad bosom teemed
with countless thousands of carnivorous beasts and reptiles, and
other myriads blackened the bosoms of its inland seas, and filled
its warm, moist air with the flutter of their mighty, bat-like
wings, man's battle for survival stretched from sun to
sun&mdash;there was no respite. His semi-arboreal habits took him
often into the domains of the great and lesser apes, and from this
contact had arisen what might best be termed an armed truce, for
they alone of all the other inhabitants of the earth had spoken
languages, both meager it is true, yet sufficient to their
primitive wants, and as both languages had been born of the same
needs to deal with identical conditions there were many words and
phrases identical to both. Thus the troglodyte and the primordial
ape could converse when necessity demanded, and as Nu traversed
their country he understood their grumbling and chattering merely
as warnings to him against the performance of any overt act. Had
danger lurked in his path the hairy ones would have warned him of
that too, for of such was their service to man who in return often
hunted the more remorseless of their enemies, driving them from the
land of the anthropoids.</p>

<p>On and on went Nu occasionally questioning the hairy ones he
encountered for word of Oo, and always the replies confirmed him in
his belief that he should come upon the man eater before the sun
crawled into its dark cave for the night.</p>

<p>And so he did. He had passed out of the heavier vegetation, and
was ascending a gentle rise that terminated in low volcanic cliffs
when there came down upon the breeze to his alert nostrils the
strong scent of Oo. There was little or no cover now, other than
the rank jungle grass that overgrew the slope, and an occasional
lofty fern rearing its tufted pinnacle a hundred feet above the
ground; but Nu was in no way desirous of cover. Cover that would
protect him from the view of Oo would hide Oo from him. He was not
afraid that the saber-toothed tiger would run away from
him&mdash;that was not Oo's way&mdash;but he did not wish to come
unexpectedly upon the animal in the thick grass.</p>

<p>He had approached to within a hundred yards of the cliffs now,
and the scent of Oo had become as a stench in the sensitive
nostrils of the cave man. Just ahead he could see the openings to
several caves in the face of the rocky barrier, and in one of these
he knew must lie the lair of his quarry.</p>

<p>Fifty yards from the cliff the grasses ceased except for
scattered tufts that had found foothold among the broken rocks that
strewed the ground, and as Nu emerged into this clear space he
breathed a sigh of relief for during the past fifty yards a
considerable portion of the way had been through a matted jungle
that rose above his head. To have met Oo there would have spelled
almost certain death for the cave man.</p>

<p>Now, as he bent his eyes toward the nearby cave mouths he
discovered one before which was strewn such an array of gigantic
bones that he needed no other evidence as to the identity of its
occupant. Here, indeed, laired no lesser creature than the awesome
Oo, the gigantic, saber-toothed tiger of antiquity. Even as Nu
looked there came a low and ominous growl from the dark mouth of
the foul cavern, and then in the blackness beyond the entrance Nu
saw two flaming blotches of yellow glaring out upon him.</p>

<p>A moment later the mighty beast itself sauntered majestically
into the sunlight. There it stood lashing its long tail from side
to side, glaring with unblinking eyes straight at the rash
man-thing who dared venture thus near its abode of death. The huge
body, fully as large as that of a full grown bull, was beautifully
marked with black stripes upon a vivid yellow background, while the
belly and breast were of the purest white.</p>

<p>As Nu advanced the great upper lip curled back revealing in all
their terrible ferocity the eighteen inch curved fangs that armed
either side of the upper jaw, and from the cavernous throat came a
fearsome scream of rage that brought frightened silence upon the
jungle for miles around.</p>

<p>The hunter loosened the stone knife at his gee string and
transferred it to his mouth where he held it firmly, ready for
instant use, between his strong, white teeth. In his left hand he
carried his stone-tipped spear, and in his right the heavy stone
hatchet that was so effective both at a distance and at close
range.</p>

<p>Oo is creeping upon him now. The grinning jaws drip saliva. The
yellow-green eyes gleam blood-thirstily. Can it be possible that
this fragile pygmy dreams of meeting in hand-to-hand combat the
terror of a world, the scourge of the jungle, the hunter of men and
of mammoths?</p>

<p>"For Nat-ul," murmured Nu, for Oo was about to spring.</p>

<p>As the mighty hurtling mass of bone and muscle, claws and fangs,
shot through the air toward him the man swung his tiny stone
hatchet with all the power behind his giant muscles, timing its
release so nicely that it caught Oo in mid leap squarely between
the eyes with the terrific force of a powder sped projectile. Then
Nu, cat-like as Oo himself, leaped agilely to one side as the huge
bulk of the beast dashed, sprawling to the ground at the spot where
the man had stood.</p>

<p>Scarce had the beast struck the earth than the cave man, knowing
that his puny weapon could at best but momentarily stun the
monster, drove his heavy spear deep into the glossy side just
behind the giant shoulder.</p>

<p>Already Oo has regained his feet, roaring and screaming in pain
and rage. The air vibrates and the earth trembles to his hideous
shrieks. For miles around the savage denizens of the savage jungle
bristle in terror, slinking further into the depths of their dank
and gloomy haunts, casting the while affrighted glances rearward in
the direction of that awesome sound.</p>

<p>With gaping jaws and wide spread talons the tiger lunges toward
its rash tormentor who still stands gripping the haft of his
primitive weapon. As the beast turns the spear turns also, and Nu
is whipped about as a leaf at the extremity of a gale-tossed
branch.</p>

<p>Striking and cavorting futilely the colossal feline leaps hither
and thither in prodigious bounds as he strives to reach the
taunting figure that remains ever just beyond the zone of those
destroying talons. But presently Oo goes more slowly, and now he
stops and crouches flat upon his belly. Slowly and cautiously he
reaches out-ward and backward with one huge paw until the torturing
spear is within his grasp.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the man screams taunts and insults into the face of
his enemy, at the same time forcing the spear further and further
into the vitals of the tiger, for he knows that once that paw
encircles the spear's haft his chances for survival will be of the
slenderest. He has seen that Oo is weakening from loss of blood,
but there are many fighting minutes left in the big carcass unless
a happy twist of the spear sends its point through the wall of the
great heart.</p>

<p>But at length the beast succeeds. The paw closes upon the spear.
The tough wood bends beneath the weight of those steel thews, then
snaps short a foot from the tiger's body, and at the same instant
Oo rears and throws himself upon the youth, who has snatched his
stone hunting knife from between his teeth and crouches, ready for
the impact.</p>

<p>Down they go, the man entirely buried beneath the great body of
his antagonist. Again and again the crude knife is buried in the
snowy breast of the tiger even while Nu is falling beneath the
screaming, tearing incarnation of bestial rage.</p>

<p>At the instant it strikes the man as strange that not once have
the snapping jaws or frightful talons touched him, and then he is
crushed to earth beneath the dead weight of Oo. The beast gives one
last, titanic struggle, and is still.</p>

<p>With difficulty Nu wriggles from beneath the carcass of his
kill. At the last moment the tiger itself had forced the spear's
point into its own heart as it bent and broke the haft. The man
leaps to his feet and cuts the great throat. Then, as the blood
flows, he dances about the dead body of his vanquished foe,
brandishing his knife and recovered hatchet, and emitting now
shrill shrieks in mimicry of Oo, and now deep toned roars&mdash;the
call of the victorious cave man.</p>

<p>From the surrounding cliffs and jungle came answering challenges
from a hundred savage throats&mdash;the rumbling thunder of the
cave bear's growl; the roar of Zor, the lion; the wail of the
hyena; the trumpeting of the mammoth; the deep toned bellowing of
the bull bos, and from distant swamp and sea came the hissing and
whistling of saurians and amphibians.</p>

<p>His victory dance completed, Nu busied himself in the removal of
the broken spear from the carcass of his kill. At the same time he
removed several strong tendons from Oo's fore arm, with which he
roughly spliced the broken haft, for there was never an instant in
the danger fraught existence of his kind when it was well to be
without the service of a stone-tipped spear.</p>

<p>This precaution taken, the man busied himself with the task of
cutting off Oo's head, that he might bear it in triumph to the cave
of his love. With stone hatchet and knife he hacked and hewed for
the better part of a half-hour, until at last he raised the
dripping trophy above his head, as, leaping high in the air, he
screamed once more the gloating challenge of the victor, that all
the world might know that there was no greater hunter than Nu, the
son of Nu.</p>

<p>Even as the last note of his fierce cry rolled through the
heavy, humid, super-heated air of the Niocene there came a sudden
hush upon the face of the world. A strange darkness obscured the
swollen sun. The ground trembled and shook. Deep rumblings muttered
upward from the bowels of the young earth, and answering grumblings
thundered down from the firmament above.</p>

<p>The startled troglodyte looked quickly in every direction,
searching for the great beast who could thus cause the whole land
to tremble and cry out in fear, and the heavens above to moan, and
the sun to hide itself in terror.</p>

<p>In every direction he saw frightened beasts and birds and flying
reptiles scurrying in panic stricken terror in search of hiding
places, and moved by the same primitive instinct the young giant
grabbed up his weapons and his trophy, and ran like an antelope for
the sheltering darkness of the cave of Oo.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he reached the fancied safety of the interior when
the earth's crust crumpled and rocked&mdash;there was a sickening
sensation of sudden sinking, and amidst the awful roar and thunder
of rending rock, the cave mouth closed, and in the impenetrable
darkness of his living tomb Nu, the son of Nu, Nu of the Niocene,
lost consciousness.</p>

<p>That was a hundred thousand years ago.</p>

<h2><a name="cha2" id="cha2">II. &mdash; THE EARTHQUAKE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">To have looked at her, merely, you would never
have thought Victoria Custer, of Beatrice, Nebraska, at all the
sort of girl she really was. Her large dreamy eyes, and the
graceful lines of her slender figure gave one an impression of that
physical cowardice which we have grown to take for granted as an
inherent characteristic of the truly womanly woman. And yet I dare
say there were only two things on God's green earth that Victoria
Custer feared, or beneath it or above it, for that
matter&mdash;mice and earthquakes.</p>

<p>She readily admitted the deadly terror which the former aroused
within her; but of earthquakes she seldom if ever would speak. To
her brother Barney, her chum and confidant, she had on one or two
occasions unburdened her soul.</p>

<p>The two were guests now of Lord and Lady Greystoke upon the
Englishman's vast estate in equatorial Africa, in the country of
the Waziri, to which Barney Custer had come to hunt big
game&mdash;and forget. But all that has nothing to do with this
story; nor has John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, who was, once upon a
time, Tarzan of the Apes, except that my having chanced to be a
guest of his at the same time as the Custers makes it possible for
me to give you a story that otherwise might never have been
told.</p>

<p>South of Uziri, the country of the Waziri, lies a chain of
rugged mountains at the foot of which stretches a broad plain where
antelope, zebra, giraffe, rhinos and elephant abound, and here are
lion and leopard and hyena preying, each after his own fashion,
upon the sleek, fat herds of antelope, zebra and giraffe. Here,
too, are buffalo&mdash;irritable, savage beasts, more formidable
than the lion himself Clayton says.</p>

<p>It is indeed a hunter's paradise, and scarce a day passed that
did not find a party absent from the low, rambling bungalow of the
Greystokes in search of game and adventure, nor seldom was it that
Victoria Custer failed to be of the party.</p>

<p>Already she had bagged two leopards, in addition to numerous
antelope and zebra, and on foot had faced a bull buffalo's charge,
bringing him down with a perfect shot within ten paces of where she
stood.</p>

<p>At first she had kept her brother in a state bordering on
nervous collapse, for the risks she took were such as few men would
care to undertake; but after he had discovered that she possessed
perfect coolness in the face of danger, and that the accuracy of
her aim was so almost uncanny as to wring unstinted praise from the
oldest hunters among them, he commenced to lean a trifle too far in
the other direction, so that Victoria was often in positions where
she found herself entirely separated from the other members of the
party&mdash;a compliment to her prowess which she greatly prized,
since women and beginners were usually surrounded by precautions
and guards through which it was difficult to get within firing
distance of any sort of game.</p>

<p>As they were riding homeward one evening after a hunt in the
foothills Barney noticed that his sister was unusually quiet, and
apparently depressed.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Vic?" he asked. "Dead tired, eh?"</p>

<p>The girl looked up with a bright smile, which was immediately
followed by an expression of puzzled bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Barney," she said, after a moment of silence, "there is
something about those hills back there that fills me with the
strangest sensation of terror imaginable. Today I passed an
outcropping of volcanic rock that gave evidence of a frightful
convulsion of nature in some bygone age. At sight of it I commenced
to tremble from head to foot, a cold perspiration breaking out all
over me. But that part is not so strange&mdash;you know I have
always been subject to these same silly attacks of unreasoning
terror at the sight of any evidence of the mighty forces that have
wrought changes in the earth's crust, or of the slightest tremor of
an earthquake; but today the feeling of unutterable personal loss
which overwhelmed me was almost unbearable&mdash;it was as though
one whom I loved above all others had been taken from me.</p>

<p>"And yet," she continued, "through all my inexplicable sorrow
there shone a ray of brilliant hope as remarkable and unfathomable
as the deeper and depressing emotion which still stirred me."</p>

<p>For some time neither spoke, but rode silently stirrup to
stirrup as their ponies picked their ways daintily through the knee
high grass. The girl was thinking&mdash;trying to puzzle out an
explanation of the rather weird sensations which had so recently
claimed her. Barney Custer was one of those unusual and delightful
people who do not scoff at whatever they cannot understand; the
reason, doubtless, that his sister as well as others chose him as
the recipient of their confidences. Not understanding her emotion
he had nothing to offer, and so remained silent. He was, however,
not a little puzzled, as he had always been at each new
manifestation of Victoria's uncanny reaction to every indication of
the great upheavals which marked the physical changes in the
conformation of the earth's crust.</p>

<p>He recalled former occasions upon which his sister had confided
in him something of similar terrors. Once in The Garden of the
Gods, and again during a trip through The Grand Canyon in Arizona,
and very vivid indeed was the recollection of Victoria's nervous
collapse following the reading of the press despatches describing
the San Francisco earthquake. In all other respects his sister was
an exceptionally normal well-balanced young American
woman&mdash;which fact, doubtless, rendered her one weakness the
more apparent.</p>

<p>But Victoria Custer's terror of earthquakes was not her only
peculiarity. The other was her strange contempt for the men who had
sued for her hand&mdash;and these had been many. Her brother had
thought several of them the salt of the earth, and Victoria had
liked them, too, but as for loving them? Perish the thought!</p>

<p>Oddly enough recollection of this other phase of her character
obtruded itself upon Barney's memory as the two rode on toward the
Clayton bungalow, and with it he recalled a persistent dream which
Victoria had said recurred after each reminder of a great
convulsion of nature. At the thought he broke the silence.</p>

<p>"Has your-ah-avatar made his customary appearance?" he asked,
smiling.</p>

<p>The girl extended her hand toward her brother and laid it on his
where it rested upon his thigh as he rode, looking up at him with
half-frightened, half-longing eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, Barney," she cried, "you are such a dear never to have
laughed at my silly dreams. I'm sure I should go quite mad did I
not have you in whom to confide; but lately I have hesitated to
speak of it even to you&mdash;he has been coming so often! Every
night since we first hunted in the vicinity of the hills I have
walked hand in hand with him beneath a great equatorial moon beside
a restless sea, and more clearly than ever in the past have I seen
his form and features. He is very handsome, Barney, and very tall
and strong, and clean limbed&mdash;I wish that I might meet such a
man in real life. I know it is a ridiculous thing to say, but I can
never love any of the pusillanimous weaklings who are forever
falling in love with me&mdash;not after having walked hand in hand
with such as he and read the love in his clear eyes. And yet,
Barney, I am afraid of him. Is it not odd?"</p>

<p>At this juncture they were joined by other members of the party,
so that no further reference to the subject was made by either. At
the Claytons they found that an addition had been made to the
number of guests by the unheralded advent of two khaki-clad young
men, one of whom rose and came forward to meet the returning
hunters while they were yet a hundred yards away.</p>

<p>He was a tall, athletic appearing man. As Victoria Custer
recognized his features she did not know whether to be pleased or
angry. Here was the one man she had ever met who came nearest to
the realization of her dream-man, and this one of all the others
had never spoken a word of love to her. His companion who had now
risen from the cool shade of the low veranda was also coming
forward, but more slowly, the set of his shoulders and the swing of
his stride betokening his military vocation.</p>

<p>"Mr. Curtiss!" exclaimed Victoria, and looking past him, "and
Lieutenant Butzow! Where in the world did you come from?"</p>

<p>"The world left us," replied the officer, smiling, "and we have
followed her to the wilds of Equatorial Africa."</p>

<p>"We found Nebraska a very tame place after you and Barney left,"
explained Mr. Curtiss, "and when I discovered that Butzow would
accompany me we lost no time in following you, and here we are
throwing ourselves upon the mercy and hospitality of Lady
Greystoke."</p>

<p>"I have been trying to convince them," said that lady, who had
now joined the party at the foot of the veranda steps, "that the
obligation is all upon our side. It taxes our ingenuity and the
generosity of our friends to keep the house even half-full of
congenial companions."</p>

<p>It was not until after dinner that night that Mr. William
Curtiss had an opportunity to draw Miss Victoria Custer away from
the others upon some more or less hazy pretext that he might
explain for her ears alone just why he had suddenly found Beatrice,
Nebraska, such a desolate place and had realized that it was
imperative to the salvation of his life and happiness that he
travel halfway around the world in search of a certain slender bit
of femininity.</p>

<p>This usually self-possessed young man stammered and hesitated
like a bashful school boy speaking his Friday afternoon piece; but
finally he managed to expel from his system, more or less
coherently, the fact that he was very much in love with Victoria
Custer, and that he should never again eat or sleep until she had
promised to be his wife.</p>

<p>There was a strong appeal to the girl in the masterful thing the
man had done in searching her out in the wilds of Africa to tell
her of his love, for it seemed that he and Butzow had forced their
way with but a handful of carriers through a very savage section of
the savage jungle because it was the shortest route from the coast
to the Greystoke ranch.</p>

<p>Then there was that about him which appealed to the same
attribute of her nature to which the young giant of her dreams
appealed&mdash;a primitive strength and masterfulness that left her
both frightened and happily helpless in the presence of both these
strong loves, for the love of her dream man was to Victoria Custer
a real and living love.</p>

<p>Curtiss saw assent in the silence which followed his outbreak,
and taking advantage of this tacit encouragement, he seized her
hands in his and drew her toward him.</p>

<p>"Oh, Victoria," he whispered, "tell me that thing I wish to hear
from your dear lips. Tell me that even a tenth part of my love is
returned, and I shall be happy."</p>

<p>She looked up into his eyes, shining down upon her in the
moonlight, and on her lips trembled an avowal of the love she
honestly believed she could at last bestow upon the man of her
choice. In the past few moments she had thrashed out the question
of that other, unreal and intangible love that had held her chained
to a dream for years, and in the cold light of twentieth century
American rationality she had found it possible to put her
hallucinations from her and find happiness in the love of this very
real and very earnest young man.</p>

<p>"Billy," she said, "I," but she got no further. Even as the
words that would have bound her to him were forming upon her tongue
there came a low sullen rumbling from the bowels of the
earth&mdash;the ground rose and fell beneath them as the swell of
the sea rises and falls. Then there came a violent trembling and
shaking and a final deafening crash in the distance that might have
accompanied the birth of mountain ranges.</p>

<p>With a little moan of terror the girl drew away from Curtiss,
and then, before he could restrain her, she had turned and fled
toward the bungalow. At the veranda steps she was met by the other
members of the house party, and by the Greystokes and numerous
servants who had rushed out at the first premonition of the coming
shock.</p>

<p>Barney Custer saw his sister running toward the house, and
knowing her terror of such phenomena ran to meet her. Close behind
her came Curtiss, just in time to see the girl swoon in her
brother's arms. Barney carried her to her room, where Lady
Greystoke, abandoning the youthful "Jack" to his black mammy,
Esmeralda, ministered to her.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="cha3" id="cha3">III. &mdash; NU, THE SLEEPER,
AWAKES</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">The shock that had been felt so plainly in the
valley had been much more severe in the mountains to the south. In
one place an overhanging cliff had split and fallen away from the
face of the mountain, tumbling with a mighty roar into the valley
below. As it hurtled down the mountain side the moonlight shining
upon the fresh scar that it had left behind it upon the hill's face
revealed the mouth of a gloomy cave from which there tumbled the
inert figure of an animal which rolled down the steep declivity in
the wake of the mass of rock that had preceded it&mdash;the tearing
away of which had opened up the cavern in which it had lain.</p>

<p>For a hundred feet perhaps the body rolled, coming to a stop
upon a broad ledge. For some time it lay perfectly motionless, but
at last a feeble movement of the limbs was discernible. Then for
another long period it was quiet. Minutes dragged into hours and
still the lonely thing lay upon the mountain side, while upon the
plain below it hungry lions moaned and roared, and all the teeming
life of the savage wilds took up their search for food, their
sleeping and their love-making where they had dropped them in the
fright of the earthquake.</p>

<p>At last the stars paled and the eastern horizon glowed to a new
day, and then the thing upon the ledge sat up. It was a man. Still
partially dazed he drew his hand across his eyes and looked about
him in bewilderment. Then, staggering a little, he rose to his
feet, and as he came erect, the new sun shining on his bronzed
limbs and his shock of black hair, roughly cropped between
sharpened stones, his youth and beauty became startlingly
apparent.</p>

<p>He looked about him upon the ground, and not finding that which
he sought turned his eyes upward toward the mountain until they
fell upon the cave mouth he had just quitted so precipitately.
Quickly he clambered back to the cavern, his stone hatchet and
knife beating against his bare hips as he climbed. For a moment he
was lost to view within the cave, but presently he emerged, in one
hand a stone-tipped spear, which seemed recently to have been
broken and roughly spliced with raw tendons, and in the other the
severed head of an enormous beast, which more nearly resembled the
royal tiger of Asia than it did any other beast, though that
resemblance was little closer than is the resemblance of the Royal
Bengal to a house kitten.</p>

<p>The young man was Nu, the son of Nu. For a hundred thousand
years he had lain hermetically sealed in his rocky tomb, as toads
remain in suspended animation for similar periods of time. The
earthquake had unsealed his sepulcher, and the rough tumble down
the mountainside had induced respiration. His heart had responded
to the pumping of his lungs, and simultaneously the other organs of
his body had taken up their various functions as though they had
never ceased functioning.</p>

<p>As he stood upon the threshold of the cave of Oo, the man
hunter, the look of bewilderment grew upon his features as his eyes
roved over the panorama of the unfamiliar world which lay spread
below him. There was scarce an object to remind him of the world
that had been but a brief instant before, for Nu could not know
that ages had rolled by since he took hasty refuge in the lair of
the great beast he had slain.</p>

<p>He thought that he might be dreaming, and so he rubbed his eyes
and looked again; but still he saw the unfamiliar trees and bushes
about him and further down in the valley the odd appearing
vegetation of the jungle. Nu could not fathom the mystery of it.
Slowly he stepped from the cave and began the descent toward the
valley, for he was very thirsty and very hungry. Below him he saw
animals grazing upon the broad plain, but even at that distance he
realized that they were such as no mortal eye had ever before
rested upon.</p>

<p>Warily he advanced, every sense alert against whatever new form
of danger might lurk in this strange, new world. Had he had any
conception of a life after death he would doubtless have felt
assured that the earthquake had killed him and that he was now
wandering through the heavenly vale; but the men of Nu's age had
not yet conceived any sort of religion, other than a vague fear of
certain natural phenomena such as storms and earthquakes, the
movements of the sun and moon, and those familiar happenings which
first awake the questionings of the primitive.</p>

<p>He saw the sun; but to him it was a different sun from the
great, swollen orb that had shone through the thick, humid
atmosphere of the Niocene. From Oo's lair only the day before he
had been able to see in the distance the shimmering surface of the
restless sea; but now as far as eye could reach there stretched an
interminable jungle of gently waving tree tops, except for the
rolling plain at his feet where yesterday the black jungle of the
ape-people had reared its lofty fronds.</p>

<p>Nu shook his head. It was all quite beyond him; but there were
certain things which he could comprehend, and so, after the manner
of the self-reliant, he set about to wrest his livelihood from
nature under the new conditions which had been imposed upon him
while he slept.</p>

<p>First of all his spear must be attended to. It would never do to
trust to that crude patch longer than it would take him to find and
fit a new haft. His meat must wait until that thing was
accomplished. In the meantime he might pick up what fruit was
available in the forest toward which he was bending his steps in
search of a long, straight shoot of the hard wood which alone would
meet his requirements. In the days that had been Nu's there had
grown in isolated patches a few lone clumps of very straight,
hard-wood trees. The smaller of these the men of the tribe would
cut down and split lengthways with stone wedges until from a single
tree they might have produced material for a score or more spear
shafts; but now Nu must see the very smallest of saplings, for he
had no time to waste in splitting a larger tree, even had he had
the necessary wedges and hammers.</p>

<p>Into the forest the youth crept, for though a hundred thousand
years had elapsed since his birth he was still to all intent and
purpose a youth. Upon all sides he saw strange and wonderful trees,
the likes of which had never been in the forests of yesterday. The
growths were not so luxuriant or prodigious, but for the most part
the trees offered suggestions of alluring possibilities to the
semiarboreal Nu, for the branches were much heavier and more solid
than those of the great tree-ferns of his own epoch, and commenced
much nearer the ground. Cat-like he leaped into the lower branches
of them, reveling in the ease with which he could travel from tree
to tree.</p>

<p>Gay colored birds of strange appearance screamed and scolded at
him. Little monkeys hurried, chattering, from his path. Nu laughed.
What a quaint, diminutive world it was indeed! Nowhere had he yet
seen a tree or creature that might compare in size to the monsters
among which he had traveled the preceding day.</p>

<p>The fruits, too, were small and strange. He scarcely dared
venture to eat of them lest they be poisonous. If the lesser ape
folk would only let him come close enough to speak with them he
might ascertain from them which were safe, but for some
unaccountable reason they seemed to fear and mistrust him. This
above all other considerations argued to Nu that he had come in
some mysterious way into another world.</p>

<p>Presently the troglodyte discovered a slender, straight young
sapling. He came to the ground and tested its strength by bending
it back and forth. Apparently it met the requirements of a new
shaft. With his stone hatchet he hewed it off close to the ground,
stripped it of branches, and climbing to the safety of the trees
again, where he need fear no interruption from the huge monsters of
the world he knew, set to work with his stone knife to remove the
bark and shape the end to receive his spear head. First he split it
down the center for four or five inches, and then he cut notches in
the surface upon either side of the split portion. Now he carefully
unwraps the rawhide that binds the spear head into his old haft,
and for want of water to moisten it, crams the whole unfragrant
mass into his mouth that it may be softened by warmth and saliva.
For several minutes he busies himself in shaping the point of the
new shaft that it may exactly fit the inequalities in the shank of
the spear head. By the time this is done the rawhide has been
sufficiently moistened to permit him to wind it tightly about the
new haft into which he has set the spear head.</p>

<p>As he works he hears the noises of the jungle about him. There
are many familiar voices, but more strange ones. Not once has the
cave bear spoken; nor Zor, the mighty lion of the Niocene; nor Oo,
the saber-toothed tiger. He misses the bellowing of the bull bos,
and the hissing and whistling of monster saurian and amphibian. To
Nu it seems a silent world. Propped against the bole of the tree
before him grins the hideous head of Oo, the man hunter, the only
familiar object in all this strange, curiously changed world about
him.</p>

<p>Presently he becomes aware that the lesser apes are creeping
warily closer to have a better look at him. He waits silently until
from the tail of his eye he glimpses one quite near, and then in a
low voice he speaks in the language that his allies of yesterday
understood, and though ages had elapsed since that long gone day
the little monkey above him understood, for the language of the
apes can never change.</p>

<p>"Why do you fear Nu, the son of Nu?" asked the man. "When has he
ever harmed the ape-people?"</p>

<p>"The hairless ones kill us with sharp sticks that fly through
the air," replied the monkey; "or with little sticks that make a
great noise and kill us from afar; but you seem not to be of these.
We have never seen one like you until now. Do you not wish to kill
us?"</p>

<p>"Why should I?" replied Nu. "It is better that we be friends.
All that I wish of you is that you tell me which of the fruits that
grow here be safe for me to eat, and then direct me to the sea
beside which dwell the tribe of Nu, my father."</p>

<p>The monkeys had gathered in force by this time, seeing that the
strange white ape offered no harm to their fellows and when they
learned his wants they scampered about in all directions to gather
nuts and fruits and berries for him. It is true that some of them
forgot what they had intended doing before the task was half
completed, and ended by pulling one another's tails and frolicking
among the higher branches, or else ate the fruit they had gone to
gather for their new friend; but a few there were with greater
powers of concentration than their fellows who returned with fruit
and berries and caterpillars, all of which Nu devoured with the
avidity of the half-famished.</p>

<p>Of the whereabouts of the tribe of his father they could tell
him nothing, for they had never heard of such a people, or of the
great sea beside which he told them that his people dwelt.</p>

<p>His breakfast finished, and his spear repaired Nu set out toward
the plain to bring down one of the beasts he had seen grazing
there, for his stomach called aloud for flesh. Fruit and bugs might
be all right for children and ape-people; but a full grown man must
have meat, warm and red and dripping.</p>

<p>Closest to him as he emerged from the jungle browsed a small
herd of zebra. They were directly up wind, and between him and them
were patches of tall grass and clumps of trees scattered about the
surface of the plain. Nu wondered at the strange beasts, admiring
their gaudy markings as he came closer to them. Upon the edge of
the herd nearest him a plump stallion stood switching his tail
against the annoying flies, occasionally raising his head from his
feeding to search the horizon for signs of danger, sniffing the air
for the tell-tale scent of an enemy. It was he that Nu selected for
his prey.</p>

<p>Stealthily the cave man crept through the tall grass, scarce a
blade moving to the sinuous advance of his sleek body. Within fifty
feet of the zebra Nu stopped, for the stallion was giving evidence
of restlessness, as though sensing intuitively the near approach of
a foe he could neither see, nor hear, nor smell.</p>

<p>The man, still prone upon his belly, drew his spear into the
throwing grasp. With utmost caution he wormed his legs beneath him,
and then, like lightning and all with a single movement, he leaped
to his feet and cast the stone-tipped weapon at his quarry.</p>

<p>With a snort of terror the stallion reared to plunge away, but
the spear had found the point behind his shoulder even as he saw
the figure of the man arise from the tall grasses, and as the
balance of the herd galloped madly off, their leader pitched
headlong to the earth.</p>

<p>Nu ran forward with ready knife, but the animal was dead before
he reached its side&mdash;the great spear had passed through its
heart and was protruding upon the opposite side of the body. The
man removed the weapon, and with his knife cut several long strips
of meat from the plump haunches.</p>

<p>Ever and anon he raised his head to scan the plain and jungle
for evidences of danger, sniffing the breeze just as had the
stallion he had killed. His work was but partially completed when
he caught the scent of man yet a long way off. He knew that he
could not be mistaken, yet never had he sensed so strange an odor.
There were men coming, he knew, but of the other odors that
accompanied them he could make nothing, for khaki and guns and
sweaty saddle blankets and the stench of tanned leather were to
Nu's nostrils as Greek would have been to his ears.</p>

<p>It would be best thought Nu to retreat to the safety of the
forest until he could ascertain the number and kind of beings that
were approaching, and so, taking but careless advantage of the
handier shelter, the cave man sauntered toward the forest, for now
he was not stalking game, and never yet had he shown fear in the
presence of an enemy. If their numbers were too great for him to
cope with single handed he would not show himself; but none might
ever say that he had seen Nu, the son of Nu, run away from
danger.</p>

<p>In his hand still swung the head of Oo, and as the man leaped to
the low branches of a tree at the jungle's edge to spy upon the men
he knew to be advancing from the far side of the plain, he fell to
wondering how he was to find his way back to Nat-ul that he might
place the trophy at her feet and claim her as his mate.</p>

<p>Only the previous evening they had walked together hand in hand
along the beach, and now he had not the remotest conception of
where that beach lay. Straight across the plain should be the
direction of it, for from that direction had he come to find the
lair of Oo! But now all was changed. There was no single familiar
landmark to guide him, not even the ape-people knew of any sea
nearby, and he himself had no conception as to whether he was in
the same world that he had traversed when last the sun shone upon
him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="cha4" id="cha4">IV. &mdash; THE MYSTERIOUS HUNTER</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">The morning following the earthquake found
Victoria Custer still confined to her bed. She told Lady Greystoke
that she felt weak from the effects of the nervous shock; but the
truth of the matter was that she dreaded to meet Curtiss and
undergo the ordeal which she knew confronted her.</p>

<p>How was she to explain to him the effect that the subterranean
rumblings and the shaking of the outer crust had had upon her and
her sentiments toward him? When her brother came in to see her she
drew his head down upon the pillow beside hers and whispered
something of the terrible hallucinations that had haunted her since
the previous evening.</p>

<p>"Oh, Barney," she cried, "what can it be? What can it be? The
first deep grumblings that preceded the shock seemed to awake me as
from a lethargy, and as plainly as I see you beside me now, I saw
the half-naked creature of my dreams, and when I saw him I knew
that I could never wed Mr. Curtiss or any other&mdash;it is awful
to have to admit it even to you, Barney, but I&mdash;I knew when I
saw him that I loved him&mdash;that I was his. Not his wife,
Barney, but his woman&mdash;his mate, and I had to fight with
myself to keep from rushing out into the terrible blackness of the
night to throw myself into his arms. It was then that I managed to
control myself long enough to run to you, where I fainted. And last
night, in my dreams, I saw him again,&mdash;alone and lonely,
searching through a strange and hostile world to find and claim
me.</p>

<p>"You cannot know, Barney, how real he is to me. It is not as
other dreams, but instead I really see him&mdash;the satin texture
of his smooth, bronzed skin; the lordly poise of his perfect head;
the tousled shock of coal black hair that I have learned to love
and through which I know I have run my fingers as he stooped to
kiss me.</p>

<p>"He carries a great spear, stone-tipped&mdash;I should know it
the moment that I saw it&mdash;and a knife and hatchet of the same
flinty material, and in his left hand he bears the severed head of
a mighty beast.</p>

<p>"He is a noble figure, but of another world or of another age;
and somewhere he wanders so lonely and alone that my heart weeps at
the thought of him. Oh, Barney, either he is true and I shall find
him, or I am gone mad. Tell me Barney, for the love of heaven you
believe that I am sane."</p>

<p>Barney Custer drew his sister's face close to his and kissed her
tenderly.</p>

<p>"Of course you're sane, Vic," he reassured her. "You've just
allowed that old dream of yours to become a sort of obsession with
you, and now it's gotten on your nerves until you are commencing to
believe it even against your better judgment. Take a good grip on
yourself, get up and join Curtiss in a long ride. Have it out with
him. Tell him just what you have told me, and then tell him you'll
marry him, and I'll warrant that you'll be dreaming about him
instead of that young giant that you have stolen out of some fairy
tale."</p>

<p>"I'll get up and take a ride, Barney," replied the girl; "but as
for marrying Mr. Curtiss&mdash;well, I'll have to think it
over."</p>

<p>But after all she did not join the party that was riding toward
the hills that morning, for the thought of seeing the torn and
twisted strata of a bygone age that lifted its scarred head above
the surface of the plain at the base of the mountains was more than
she felt equal to. They did not urge her, and as she insisted that
Mr. Curtiss accompany the other men she was left alone at the
bungalow with Lady Greystoke, the baby and the servants.</p>

<p>As the party trotted across the rolling land that stretched
before them to the foothills they sighted a herd of zebras coming
toward them in mad stampede.</p>

<p>"Something is hunting ahead of us," remarked one of the men.</p>

<p>"We may get a shot at a lion from the looks of it," replied
another.</p>

<p>A short distance further on they came upon the carcass of a
zebra stallion. Barney and Butzow dismounted to examine it in an
effort to determine the nature of the enemy that had dispatched it.
At the first glance Barney called to one of the other members of
the party, an experienced big-game hunter.</p>

<p>"What do you make of this, Brown," he asked, pointing to the
exposed haunch.</p>

<p>"It is a man's kill," replied the other. "Look at that gaping
hole over the heart, that would tell the story were it not for the
evidence of the knife that cut away these strips from the rump. The
carcass is still warm&mdash;the kill must have been made within the
past few minutes.</p>

<p>"Then it couldn't have been a man," spoke up another, "or we
should have heard the shot. Wait, here's Greystoke, let's see what
he thinks of it."</p>

<p>The ape man, who had been riding a couple hundred yards in rear
of the others with one of the older men, now reined in close to the
dead zebra.</p>

<p>"What have we here?" he asked, swinging from his saddle.</p>

<p>"Brown says this looks like the kill of a man," said Barney;
"but none of us heard any shot."</p>

<p>Tarzan grasped the zebra by a front and hind pastern and rolled
him over upon his other side.</p>

<p>"It went way through, whatever it was," said Butzow, as the hole
behind this shoulder was exposed to view. "Must have been a bullet
even if we didn't hear the report of the gun."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure of that," said Tarzan, and then he glanced
casually at the ground about the carcass, and bending lower brought
his sensitive nostrils close to the mutilated haunch and then to
the tramped grasses at the zebra's side. When he straightened up
the others looked at him questioningly.</p>

<p>"A man," he said&mdash;"a white man, has been here since the
zebra died. He cut these steaks from the haunches. There is not the
slightest odor of gun powder about the wound&mdash;it was not made
by a powder-sped projectile. It is too large and too deep for an
arrow wound. The only other weapon that could have inflicted it is
a spear; but to cast a spear entirely through the carcass of a
zebra at the distance to which a man could approach one in the open
presupposes a mightiness of muscle and an accuracy of aim little
short of superhuman."</p>

<p>"And you think&mdash;?" commenced Brown.</p>

<p>"I think nothing," interrupted Tarzan, "except that my judgment
tells me that my senses are in error&mdash;there is no naked, white
giant hunting through the country of the Waziri. Come, let's ride
on to the hills and see if we can't locate the old villain who has
been stealing my sheep. From his spoor I'll venture to say that
when we bring him down we shall see the largest lion that any of us
has ever seen."</p>

<h2><a name="cha5" id="cha5">V. &mdash; THE WATCHER</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">As the party remounted and rode away toward the
foothills two wondering black eyes watched them from the safety of
the jungle. Nu was utterly non-plussed. What sort of men were these
who rode upon beasts the like of which Nu had never dreamed? At
first he thought their pith helmets and khaki clothing a part of
them; but when one of them removed his helmet and another
unbuttoned his jacket Nu saw that they were merely coverings for
the head and body, though why men should wish to hamper themselves
with such foolish and cumbersome contraptions the troglodyte could
not imagine.</p>

<p>As the party rode toward the foothills Nu paralleled them,
keeping always downwind from them. He followed them all day during
their fruitless search for the lion that had been entering
Greystoke's compound and stealing his sheep, and as they retraced
their way toward the bungalow late in the afternoon Nu followed
after them.</p>

<p>Never in his life had he been so deeply interested in anything
as he was in these strange creatures, and when, halfway across the
plain, the party came unexpectedly upon a band of antelope grazing
in a little hollow and Nu heard the voice of one of the little
black sticks the men carried and saw a buck leap into the air and
then come heavily to the ground quite dead, deep respect was added
to his interest, and possibly a trace of awe as well&mdash;fear he
knew not.</p>

<p>In a clump of bushes a quarter of a mile from the bungalow Nu
came to a halt. The strange odors that assailed his nostrils as he
approached the ranch warned him to caution. The black servants and
the Waziri warriors, some of whom were always visiting their former
chief, presented to Nu's nostrils an unfamiliar scent&mdash;one
which made the black shock upon his head stiffen as you have seen
the hair upon the neck of a white man's hound stiffen when for the
first time his nose detects the odor of an Indian. And,
half-smothered in the riot of more powerful odors, there came to
Nu's nostrils now and then a tantalizing suggestion of a faint
aroma that set his heart to pounding and the red blood coursing
through his veins.</p>

<p>Never did it abide for a sufficient time to make Nu quite sure
that it was more than a wanton trick of his senses&mdash;the result
of the great longing that was in his lonely heart for her whom this
ephemeral and elusive effluvium proclaimed. As darkness came he
approached closer to the bungalow, always careful, however, to keep
downwind from it.</p>

<p>Through the windows he could see people moving about within the
lighted interior, but he was not close enough to distinguish
features. He saw men and women sitting about a long table, eating
with strange weapons upon which they impaled tiny morsels of food
which lay upon round, flat stones before them.</p>

<p>There was much laughter and talking, which floated through the
open windows to the cave man's eager ears; but throughout it all
there came to him no single word which he could interpret. After
these men and women had eaten they came out and sat in the shadows
before the entrance to their strange cave, and here again they
laughed and chattered, for all the world, thought Nu, like the
ape-people; and yet, though it was different from the ways of his
own people the troglodyte could not help but note within his own
breast a strange yearning to take part in it&mdash;a longing for
the company of these strange, new people.</p>

<p>He had crept quite close to the veranda now, and presently there
floated down to him upon the almost stagnant air a subtle
exhalation that is not precisely scent, and for which the languages
of modern men have no expression since men themselves have no
powers of perception which may grasp it; but to Nu of the Niocene
it carried as clear and unmistakable a message as could word of
mouth, and it told him that Nat-ul, the daughter of Tha, sat among
these strange people before the entrance to their wonderful
cave.</p>

<p>And yet Nu could not believe the evidence of his own senses.
What could Nat-ul be doing among such as these? How, between two
suns, could she have learned the language and the ways of these
strangers? It was impossible; and then a man upon the veranda, who
sat close beside Victoria Custer, struck a match to light a
cigarette, and the flare of the blaze lit up the girl's features.
At the sight of them the cave man involuntarily sprang to his feet.
A half-smothered exclamation broke from his lips: "Nat-ul!"</p>

<p>"What was that?" exclaimed Barney Custer. "I thought I heard
some one speak out there near the rose bushes."</p>

<p>He rose as though to investigate, but his sister laid her hand
upon his arm.</p>

<p>"Don't go, Barney," she whispered.</p>

<p>He turned toward her with a questioning look.</p>

<p>"Why?" he asked. "There is no danger. Did you not hear it,
too?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered in a low voice, "I heard it,
Barney&mdash;please don't leave me."</p>

<p>He felt the trembling of her hand where it rested upon his
sleeve. One of the other men heard the conversation, but of course
he could not guess that it carried any peculiar
significance&mdash;it was merely an expression of the natural
timidity of the civilized white woman in the midst of the savage
African night.</p>

<p>"It's nothing, Miss Custer," he said. "I'll just walk down there
to reassure you&mdash;a prowling hyena, perhaps, but nothing
more."</p>

<p>The girl would have been glad to deter him, but she felt that
she had already evinced more perturbation than the occasion
warranted, and so she but forced a laugh, remarking that it was not
at all worthwhile, yet in her ears rang the familiar name that had
so often fallen from the lips of her dream man.</p>

<p>When one of the others suggested that the investigator had
better take an express rifle with him on the chance that the
intruder might be "old Raffles," the sheep thief, the girl started
up as though to object but realizing how ridiculous such an
attitude would be, and how impossible to explain, she turned
instead and entered the house.</p>

<p>Several of the men walked down into the garden, but though they
searched for the better part of half an hour they came upon no
indication that any savage beast was nearby. Always in front of
them a silent figure moved just outside the range of their vision,
and when they returned again to the veranda it took up its position
once more behind the rose bushes, nor until all had entered the
bungalow and sought their beds did the figure stir.</p>

<p>Nu was hungry again, and knowing no law of property rights he
found the odor of the Greystoke sheep as appetizing as that of any
other of the numerous creatures that were penned within their
compounds for the night. Like a supple panther the man scaled the
high fence that guarded the imported, pedigreed stock in which Lord
Greystoke took such just pride. A moment later there was the
frightened rush of animals to the far side of the enclosure, where
they halted to turn fear-filled eyes back toward the silent beast
of prey that crouched over the carcass of a plump ewe. Within the
pen Nu ate his fill, and then, cat-like as he had come, he glided
back stealthily toward the garden before the darkened bungalow.</p>

<p>Out across the plain, downwind from Nu, another silent figure
moved stealthily toward the ranch. It was a huge, maned lion. Every
now and then he would halt and lift his sniffing nose to the gentle
breeze, and his lips would lift baring the mighty fangs beneath,
but no sound came from his deep throat, for he was old, and his
wisdom was as the wisdom of the fox.</p>

<p>Once upon a time he would have coughed and moaned and roared
after the manner of his hungry brethren, but much experience with
men-people and their deafening thunder sticks had taught him that
he hunted longest who hunted in silence.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="cha6" id="cha6">VI. &mdash; NU AND THE LION</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Victoria Custer had gone to her room much earlier
in the evening than was her custom, but not to sleep. She did not
even disrobe, but sat instead in the darkness beside her window
looking out toward the black and mysterious jungle in the distance,
and the shadowy outlines of the southern hills.</p>

<p>She was trying to fight down forever the foolish obsession that
had been growing upon her slowly and insidiously for years. Since
the first awakening of developing womanhood within her she had been
subject to the strange dream that was now becoming an almost
nightly occurrence. At first she had thought nothing of it, other
than it was odd that she should continue to dream the same thing so
many times; but of late these nightly visions had seemed to hold
more of reality than formerly, and to presage some eventful
happening in her career&mdash;some crisis that was to alter the
course of her life. Even by day she could not rid herself of the
vision of the black-haired young giant, and tonight the culmination
had come when she had heard his voice calling to her from the rose
thicket. She knew that he was but a creature of her dreams, and it
was this knowledge which frightened her so&mdash;for it meant but
one thing; her mind was tottering beneath the burden of the nervous
strain these hallucinations had imposed upon it.</p>

<p>She must gather all the resources of her nervous energy and
throw off this terrible obsession forever. She must! She must!
Rising, the girl paced back and forth the length of her room. She
felt stifled and confined within its narrow limits. Outside,
beneath the open sky, with no boundaries save the distant horizon
was the place best fitted for such a battle as was raging within
her. Snatching up a silken scarf she threw it about her
shoulders&mdash;a concession to habit, for the night was
hot&mdash;and stepping through her window to the porch that
encircled the bungalow she passed on into the garden.</p>

<p>Just around the nearest angle of the house her brother and Billy
Curtiss sat smoking before the window of their bedroom, clad in
pajamas and slippers. Curtiss was cleaning the rifle he had used
that day&mdash;the same that he had carried into the rose garden
earlier in the evening. Neither heard the girl's light footsteps
upon the sward, and the corner of the building hid her from their
view.</p>

<p>In the open moonlight beside the rose thicket Victoria Custer
paced back and forth. A dozen times she reached a determination to
seek the first opportunity upon the morrow to give Billy Curtiss an
affirmative answer to the question he had asked her the night
before&mdash;the night of the earthquake; but each time that she
thought she had disposed of the matter definitely she found herself
involuntarily comparing him with the heroic figure of her
dream-man, and again she must need re-wage her battle.</p>

<p>As she walked in the moonlight two pairs of eyes watched her
every movement&mdash;one pair, clear, black eyes, from the rose
thicket&mdash;the other flaming yellow-green orbs hidden in a
little clump of bushes at the point where she turned in her passing
to retrace her steps&mdash;at the point farthest from the watcher
among the roses.</p>

<p>Twenty times Nu was on the point of leaping from his concealment
and taking the girl in his arms, for to him she was Nat-ul,
daughter of Tha, and it had not been a hundred thousand years, but
only since the day before yesterday that he had last seen her. Yet
each time something deterred him&mdash;a strange, vague,
indefinable fear of this wondrous creature who was Nat-ul, and yet
who was not Nat-ul, but another made in Nat-ul's image.</p>

<p>The strange things that covered her fair form seemed to have
raised a barrier between them&mdash;the last time that he had
walked hand in hand with her upon the beach naught but a soft strip
of the skin of a red doe's calf had circled her gracefully
undulating hips. Her familiar association, too, with these strange
people, coupled with the fact that she spoke and understood their
language only tended to remove her further from him. Nu was very
sad, and very lonely; and the sight of Nat-ul seemed to accentuate
rather than relieve his depression. Slowly there was born within
him the conviction that Nat-ul was no longer for Nu, the son of Nu.
Why, he could not guess; but the bitter fact seemed
irrevocable.</p>

<p>The girl had turned quite close to him now, and was retracing
her steps toward the bushes twenty yards away. Behind their
screening verdure "old Raffles" twitched his tufted tail and drew
his steel thewed legs beneath him for the spring, and as he waited
just the faintest of purrs escaped his slavering jowls. Too faint
the sound to pierce the dulled senses of the twentieth-century
maiden; but to the man hiding in the rose thicket twenty paces
further from the lion than she, it fell deep and sinister upon his
unspoiled ear.</p>

<p>Like a bolt of lightning&mdash;so quickly his muscles responded
to his will&mdash;the cave man hurtled the intervening rose bushes
with a single bound, and, raised spear in hand, bounded after the
unconscious girl. The great lion saw him coming, and lest he be
cheated of his prey leaped into the moonlight before his intended
victim was quite within the radius of his spring.</p>

<p>The beast emitted a horrid roar that froze the girl with terror,
and then in the face of his terrific charge the figure of a naked
giant leaped past her. She saw a great arm, wielding a mighty
spear, hurl the weapon at the infuriated beast&mdash;and then she
swooned.</p>

<p>As the savage note of the lion's roar broke the stillness of the
quiet night Curtiss and Barney Custer sprang to their feet, running
toward the side of the bungalow from which the sound had come.
Curtiss grasped the rifle he had but just reloaded, and as he
turned the corner of the building he caught one fleeting glimpse of
something moving near the bushes fifty yards away. Raising his
weapon he fired.</p>

<p>The whole household had been aroused by the lion's deep voice
and the answering boom of the big rifle, so that scarcely a minute
after Barney and Curtiss reached the side of the prostrate girl a
score of white men and black were gathered about them.</p>

<p>The dead body of a huge lion lay scarce twenty feet from
Victoria Custer, but a hurried examination of the girl brought
unutterable relief to them all, for she was uninjured. Barney
lifted her in his arms and carried her to her room while the others
examined the dead beast. From the center of the breast a wooden
shaft protruded, and when they had drawn this out, and it required
the united efforts of four strong men to do it, they found that a
stone-tipped spear had passed straight through the savage heart
almost the full length of the brute's body.</p>

<p>"The zebra killer," said Brown to Greystoke. The latter nodded
his head.</p>

<p>"We must find him," he said. "He has rendered us a great
service. But for him Miss Custer would not be alive now;" but
though twenty men scouted the grounds and the plain beyond for
several hours no trace of the killer of "old Raffles" could be
found, and the reason that they did not find him abroad was because
he lay directly beneath their noses in a little clump of low,
flowering shrubs, with a bullet wound in his head.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="cha7" id="cha7">VII. &mdash; VICTORIA OBEYS THE
CALL</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">The next morning the men were examining the
stone-headed spear upon the veranda just outside the breakfast
room.</p>

<p>"It's the oddest thing of its kind I ever saw," said Greystoke.
"I can almost swear that it was never made by any of the tribesmen
of present day Africa. I once saw several similar heads, though, in
the British Museum. They had been taken from the debris of a
prehistoric cave dwelling."</p>

<p>From the window of the breakfast room just behind them a wide
eyed girl was staring in breathless wonderment at the rude weapon,
which to her presented concrete evidence of the reality of the
thing she had thought but another hallucination&mdash;the leaping
figure of the naked man that had sprung past her into the face of
the charging lion an instant before she had swooned. One of the men
turned and saw her standing there.</p>

<p>"Ah, Miss Custer," he exclaimed; "no worse off this morning I
see for your little adventure of last night. Here's a memento that
your rescuer left behind him in the heart of 'old Raffles.' Would
you like it?"</p>

<p>The girl stepped forward hiding her true emotions behind the
mask of a gay smile. She took the spear of Nu, the son of Nu, in
her hands, and her heart leaped in half-savage pride as she felt
the weight of the great missile.</p>

<p>"What a man he must be who wields such a mighty weapon!" she
exclaimed. Barney Custer was watching his sister closely, for with
the discovery of the spear in the lion's body had come the sudden
recollection of Victoria's description of her dream-man&mdash;"He
carries a great spear, stone-tipped&mdash;I should know it the
moment that I saw it."</p>

<p>The young man stepped to his sister's side, putting an arm about
her shoulders. She looked up into his face, and then in a low voice
that was not audible to the others she whispered: "It is his,
Barney. I knew that I should know it."</p>

<p>For some time the young man had been harassed by fears as to his
sister's sanity. Now he was forced to entertain fears of an even
more sinister nature, or else admit that he too had gone mad. If he
were sane, then it was God's truth that somewhere in this savage
land a savage white man roamed in search of Victoria. Now that he
had found her would he not claim her? He shuddered at the thought.
He must do something to avert a tragedy, and he must act at once.
He drew Lord Greystoke to one side.</p>

<p>"Victoria and I must leave at once," he said. "The nervous
strain of the earthquake and this last adventure have told upon her
to such an extent that I fear we may have a very sick girl upon our
hands if I do not get her back to civilization and home as quickly
as possible."</p>

<p>Greystoke did not attempt to offer any remonstrances. He, too,
felt that it would be best for Miss Custer to go home. He had noted
her growing nervousness with increasing apprehension. It was
decided that they should leave on the morrow. There were fifty
black carriers anxious to return to the coast, and Butzow and
Curtiss readily signified their willingness to accompany the
Nebraskan and his sister.</p>

<p>As he was explaining his decision to Victoria a black servant
came excitedly to Lord Greystoke. He told of the finding of a dead
ewe in the compound. The animal's neck had been broken, the man
said, and several strips of meat cut from its haunches with a
knife. Beside it in the soft mud of the enclosure the prints of an
unshod human foot were plainly in evidence.</p>

<p>Greystoke smiled. "The zebra killer again," he said. "Well, he
is welcome to all he can eat."</p>

<p>Before he had finished speaking, Brown, who had been nosing
around in the garden, called to him from a little clump of bushes
beside the spot where the lion's body had lain.</p>

<p>"Look here, Clayton," he called. "Here's something we overlooked
in the darkness last night."</p>

<p>The men upon the veranda followed Greystoke to the garden.
Behind them came Victoria Custer, drawn as though by a magnet to
the spot where they had gathered.</p>

<p>In the bushes was a little pool of dried blood, and where the
earth near the roots was free from sod there were several
impressions of a bare foot.</p>

<p>"He must have been wounded," exclaimed Brown, "by Curtiss's
shot. I doubt if the lion touched him&mdash;the beast must have
died instantly the spear entered its heart. But where can he have
disappeared to?"</p>

<p>Victoria Custer was examining the grass a little distance beyond
the bushes. She saw what the others failed to see&mdash;a drop of
blood now and then leading away in the direction of the mountains
to the south. At the sight of it a great compassion welled in her
heart for the lonely, wounded man who had saved her life and then
staggered, bleeding, toward the savage wilderness from which he had
come. It seemed to her that somewhere out there he was calling to
her now, and that she must go.</p>

<p>She did not call the attention of the others to her discovery,
and presently they all returned to the veranda, where Barney again
took up the discussion of their plans for tomorrow's departure. The
girl interposed no objections. Barney was delighted to see that she
was apparently as anxious to return home as he was to have
her&mdash;he had feared a flat refusal.</p>

<p>Barney had wanted to get a buffalo bull before he left, and when
one of the Waziri warriors brought word that morning that there was
a splendid herd a few miles north of the ranch, Victoria urged him
to accompany the other men upon the hunt.</p>

<p>"I'll attend to the balance of the packing," she said. "There's
not the slightest reason in the world why you shouldn't go."</p>

<p>And so he went, and Victoria busied herself in the gathering
together of the odds and ends of their personal belongings. All
morning the household was alive with its numerous duties, but after
luncheon while the heat of the day was greatest the bungalow might
have been entirely deserted for any sign of life that there was
about it. Lady Greystoke was taking her siesta, as were practically
all of the servants. Victoria Custer had paused in her work to gaze
out of her window toward the distant hills far to the south. At her
side, nosing his muzzle into her palm, stood one of Lord
Greystoke's great wolfhounds, Terkoz. He had taken a great fancy to
Victoria Custer from the first and whenever permitted to do so
remained close beside her.</p>

<p>The girl's heart filled with a great longing as she looked
wistfully out toward the hills that she had so feared before. She
feared them still, yet something there called her. She tried to
fight against the mad desire with every ounce of her reason, but
she was fighting against an unreasoning instinct that was far
stronger than any argument she could bring to bear against it.</p>

<p>Presently the hound's cold muzzle brought forth an idea in her
mind, and with it she cast aside the last semblance of attempted
restraint upon her mad desire. Seizing her rifle and ammunition
belt she moved noiselessly into the veranda. There she found a
number of leashes hanging from a peg. One of these she snapped to
the hound's collar. Unseen, she crossed the garden to the little
patch of bushes where the dried blood was. Here she gathered up
some of the brown stained earth and held it close to Terkoz's nose.
Then she put her finger to the ground where the trail of blood led
away toward the south.</p>

<p>"Here, Terkoz!" she whispered.</p>

<p>The beast gave a low growl as the scent of the new blood filled
his nostrils, and with nose close to ground started off, tugging
upon the leash, in the direction of the mountains upon the opposite
side of the plain.</p>

<p>Beside him walked the girl, across her shoulder was slung a
modern big-game rifle, and in her left hand swung the stone-tipped
spear of the savage mate she sought.</p>

<p>What motive prompted her act she did not even pause to consider.
The results she gave not the slightest thought. It seemed the most
natural thing in the world that she should be seeking this lonely,
wounded man. Her place was at his side. He needed her&mdash;that
was enough for her to know. She was no longer the pampered, petted
child of an effete civilization. That any metamorphosis had taken
place within her she did not dream, nor is it certain that any
change had occurred, for who may say that it is such a far step
from one incarnation to another however many countless years of
man-measured time may have intervened?</p>

<p>Darkness had fallen upon the plain and the jungle and the
mountain, and still Terkoz forged ahead, nose to ground, and beside
him moved the slender figure of the graceful girl. Now the roar of
a distant lion came faintly to her ears, answered, quite close, by
the moaning of another&mdash;a sound that is infinitely more weird
and terrifying than the deeper-throated challenge. The cough of the
leopard and the uncanny "laughter" of hyenas added their evidence
that the night-prowling carnivora were abroad.</p>

<p>The hair along the wolfhound's spine stiffened in a little ridge
of bristling rage. The girl unslung her rifle, shifting the leash
to the hand that carried the heavy spear of the troglodyte; but she
was unafraid. Suddenly, just before her, a little band of antelope
sprang from the grass in startled terror&mdash;there was a hideous
roar, and a great body hurtled through the air to alight upon the
rump of the hindmost of the herd. A single scream of pain and
terror from the stricken animal, a succession of low growls and the
sound of huge jaws crunching through flesh and bone, and then
silence.</p>

<p>The girl made a slight detour to avoid the beast and its kill,
passing a hundred yards above them. In the moonlight the lion saw
her and the hound. Standing across his fallen prey, his flaming
eyes glaring at the intruders, he rumbled his deep warning to them;
but Victoria, dragging the growling Terkoz after her, passed on,
and the king of beasts turned to his feast.</p>

<p>It was fifteen minutes before Terkoz could relocate the trail,
and then the two took up their lonely way once more. Into the
foothills past the tortured strata of an ancient age it wound. At
sight of the naked rock the girl shuddered, yet on and up she went
until Terkoz halted, bristling and growling, before the inky
entrance to a gloomy cave.</p>

<p>Holding the beast back Victoria peered within. Her eyes could
not penetrate the Stygian darkness. Here, evidently, the trail
ended, but of a sudden it occurred to her that she had only
surmised that the bloody spoor they had been following was that of
the man she sought. It was almost equally as probable that
Curtiss's shot had struck "old Raffles'" mate and that after all
she had followed the blood of a wounded lioness to the creature's
rocky lair.</p>

<p>Bending low she listened, and at last there came to her ears a
sound as of a body moving, and then heavy breathing, and a
sigh.</p>

<p>"Nu!" she whispered. "Is it you? I have come," nor did it seem
strange to her that she spoke in a strange tongue, no word of which
she had ever heard in all her life before. For a moment there was
silence, and then, weakly, from the depths of the cave a voice
replied.</p>

<p>"Nat-ul!" It was barely a whisper.</p>

<p>Quickly the girl groped her way into the cavern, feeling before
her with her hands, until she came to the prostrate form of a man
lying upon the cold, hard rock. With difficulty she kept the
growling wolfhound from his throat. Terkoz had found the prey that
he had tracked, and he could not understand why he should not now
be allowed to make the kill; but he was a well-trained beast, and
at last at the girl's command he took up a position at the cave's
mouth on guard.</p>

<p>Victoria kneeled beside the prostrate form of Nu, the son of Nu;
but she was no longer Victoria Custer. It was Nat-ul, the daughter
of Tha, who kneeled there beside the man she loved. Gently she
passed her slim fingers across his forehead&mdash;it was burning
with a raging fever. She felt the wound along the side of his head
and shuddered. Then she raised him in her arms so that his head was
pillowed in her lap, and stooping kissed his cheek.</p>

<p>Halfway down the mountain side, she recalled, there was a little
spring of fresh, cold water. Removing her hunting jacket she rolled
it into a pillow for the unconscious man, and then with Terkoz at
her side clambered down the rocky way. Filling her hat with water
she returned to the cave. All night she bathed the fevered head,
and washed the ugly wound, at times squeezing a few refreshing
drops between the hot lips.</p>

<p>At last the restless tossing of the wounded man ceased, and the
girl saw that he had fallen into a natural sleep, and that the
fever had abated. When the first rays of the rising sun relieved
the gloom within the cavern Terkoz, rising to stretch himself,
looked backward into the interior. He saw a black-haired giant
sleeping quietly, his head pillowed upon a khaki hunting coat, and
beside him sat the girl, her loosened hair tumbled about her
shoulders and over the breast of the sleeping man upon which her
own tired head had dropped in the sleep of utter exhaustion. Terkoz
yawned and lay down again.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="cha8" id="cha8">VIII. &mdash; CAPTURED BY ARABS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">After a time the girl awoke. For a few minutes she
could not assure herself of the reality of her surroundings. She
thought that this was but another of her dreams. Gently she put out
her hand and touched the face of the sleeper. It was very real.
Also she noted that the fever had left. She sat in silence for a
few minutes attempting to adjust herself to the new and strange
conditions which surrounded her. She seemed to be two
people&mdash;the American girl, Victoria Custer, and Nat-ul; but
who or from where was Nat-ul she could not fathom, other than that
she was beloved by Nu and that she returned his love.</p>

<p>She wondered that she did not regret the life of ease she had
abandoned, and which she knew that she could never again return to.
She was still sufficiently of the twentieth century to realize that
the step she had taken must cut her off forever from her past
life&mdash;yet she was very happy. Bending low over the man she
kissed his lips, and then rising went outside, and calling Terkoz
with her descended to the spring, for she was thirsty.</p>

<p>Neither the girl nor the hound saw the white-robed figures that
withdrew suddenly behind a huge boulder as the two emerged from the
cave's mouth. Nor did they see him signal to others behind him who
had not yet rounded the shoulder of the cliff at the base of which
they had been marching.</p>

<p>Victoria stooped to fill her hat at the spring. First she leaned
far down to quench her own thirst. A sudden, warning growl from
Terkoz brought her head up, and there, not ten paces from her, she
saw a dozen white-robed Arabs, and behind them half a hundred
blacks. All were armed&mdash;evil looking fellows they were, and
one of the Arabs had covered her with his long gun.</p>

<p>Now he spoke to her, but in a tongue she did not understand,
though she knew that his message was unfriendly, and imagined that
it warned her not to attempt to use her own rifle which lay beside
her. Next he spoke to those behind him and two of them approached
the girl, one from either side, while the leader continued to keep
his piece leveled at her.</p>

<p>As the two came toward her she heard a menacing growl from the
wolfhound, and then saw him leap for the nearest Arab. The fellow
clubbed his gun and swung it full upon Terkoz's skull, so that the
faithful hound collapsed in a silent heap at their feet. Then the
two rushed in and seized Victoria's rifle, and a moment later she
was roughly dragged toward the leader of the ill-favored gang.</p>

<p>Through one of the blacks, a West Coast negro who had picked up
a smattering of pidgin English, the leader questioned the girl, and
when he found that she was a guest of Lord Greystoke an ugly grin
crossed his evil face, for the fellow recalled what had befallen
another Arab slave and ivory caravan at the hands of the Englishman
and his Waziri warriors. Here was an opportunity for partial
revenge. He motioned for his followers to bring her
along&mdash;there was no time to tarry in this country of their
enemies into which they had accidentally stumbled after being lost
in the jungle for the better part of a month.</p>

<p>Victoria asked what their intentions toward her were; but all
that she could learn was that they would take her north with them.
She offered to arrange the payment of a suitable ransom if they
would return her to her friends unharmed, but the Arab only laughed
at her.</p>

<p>"You will bring a good price," he said, "at the court of the
sultan of Fulad, north of Tagwara, and for the rest I shall have
partly settled the score which I have against the Englishman," and
so Victoria Custer disappeared from the sight of men at the border
of the savage land of the Waziri nor was there any other than her
captors to know the devious route that they followed to gain the
country north of Waziri.</p>

<p>When at last Nu, the son of Nu, opened his eyes from the deep
slumber that had refreshed and invigorated him, he looked up
expectantly for the sweet face that had been hovering above his,
and as he realized that the cave was tenantless except for himself
a sigh that was half a sob broke from the depth of his lonely
heart, for he knew that Nat-ul had been with him only in his
dreams.</p>

<p>Yet it had been so real! Even now he could feel the touch of her
cool hand upon his forehead, and her slim fingers running through
his hair. His cheek glowed to her hot kisses, and in his nostrils
was the sweet aroma of her dear presence. The disillusionment of
his waking brought with it bitter disappointment, and a return of
the fever. Again Nu lapsed into semi-consciousness and delirium, so
that he was not aware of the figure of the khaki-clad white man
that crept warily into the half-darkness of his lair shortly after
noon.</p>

<p>It was Barney Custer, and behind him came Curtiss, Butzow and a
half-dozen others of the searching party. They had stumbled upon
the half-dead Terkoz beside the spring, and there also they had
found Victoria Custer's hat, and plainly in the soft earth between
the boulders of the hillside they had seen the new-made path to the
cave higher up.</p>

<p>When Barney saw that the prostrate figure within the cavern did
not stir at his entrance a stifling fear rose in his throat, for he
was sure that he had found the dead body of his sister; but as his
eyes became more accustomed to the dim light of the interior he
realized his mistake&mdash;at first with a sense of infinite relief
and later with misgivings that amounted almost to a wish that it
had been Victoria, safe in death; for among the savage men of
savage Africa there are fates worse than death for women.</p>

<p>The others had crowded in beside him, and one had lighted a
torch of dry twigs which illuminated the interior of the cave
brightly for a few seconds. In that time they saw that the man was
the only occupant and that he was helpless from fever. Beside him
lay the stone spear that had slain "old Raffles"&mdash;each of them
recognized it. How could it have been brought to him?</p>

<p>"The zebra killer," said Brown. "What's that beneath his head?
Looks like a khaki coat."</p>

<p>Barney drew it out and held it up.</p>

<p>"God!" muttered Curtiss. "It's hers."</p>

<p>"He must 'ave come down there after we left, an' got his spear
an' stole your sister," said Brown.</p>

<p>Curtiss drew his revolver and pushed closer toward the
unconscious Nu.</p>

<p>"The beast," he growled; "shootin's too damned good for him. Get
out of the way, Barney, I'm going to give him all six
chambers."</p>

<p>"No," said Barney quietly.</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded Curtiss, trying to push past Custer.</p>

<p>"Because I don't believe that he harmed Victoria," replied
Barney. "That's sufficient reason for waiting until we know the
truth. Then I won't stand for the killing of an unconscious man
anyway."</p>

<p>"He's nothing but a beast&mdash;a mad dog," insisted Curtiss.
"He should be killed for what he is. I'd never have thought to see
you defending the man who killed your sister&mdash;God alone knows
what worse crime he committed before he killed her."</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool, Curtiss," snapped Barney. "We don't even know
that Victoria's dead. The chances are that this man has been
helpless from fever for a long time. There's a wound in his head
that was probably made by your shot last night. If he recovers from
that he may be able to throw some light on Victoria's
disappearance. If it develops that he has harmed her I'm the one to
demand an accounting&mdash;not you; but as I said before I do not
believe that this man would have harmed a hair of my sister's
head."</p>

<p>"What do you know about him?" demanded Curtiss.</p>

<p>"I never saw him before," replied Barney. "I don't know who he
is or where he came from; but I know&mdash;well, never mind what I
know, except that there isn't anybody going to kill him, other than
Barney Custer."</p>

<p>"Custer's right," broke in Brown. "It would be murder to kill
this fellow in cold blood. You have jumped to the conclusion,
Curtiss, that Miss Custer is dead. If we let you kill this man we
might be destroying our best chance to locate and rescue her."</p>

<p>As they talked the gaunt figure of the wolfhound, Terkoz, crept
into the cave. He had not been killed by the Arab's blow, and a
liberal dose of cold water poured over his head had helped to
hasten returning consciousness. He nosed, whining, about the cavern
as though in search of Victoria. The men watched him in silence
after Brown had said: "If this man harmed Miss Custer and laid out
Terkoz the beast'll be keen for revenge. Watch him, and if Curtiss
is right there won't any of us have to avenge your
sister&mdash;Terkoz'll take care of that. I know him."</p>

<p>"We'll leave it to Terkoz," said Barney confidently.</p>

<p>After the animal had made the complete rounds of the cave,
sniffing at every crack and crevice, he came to each of the
watching men, nosing them carefully. Then he walked directly to the
side of the unconscious Nu, licked his cheek, and lying down beside
him rested his head upon the man's breast so that his fierce,
wolfish eyes were pointed straight and watchful at the group of men
opposite him.</p>

<p>"There," said Barney, leaning down and stroking the beast's
head.</p>

<p>The hound whined up into his face; but when Curtiss approached
he rose, bristling, and standing across the body of Nu growled
ominously at him.</p>

<p>"You'd better keep away from him, Curtiss," warned Brown. "He
always has had a strange way with him in his likes and dislikes,
and he's a mighty ugly customer to deal with when he's crossed.
He's killed one man already&mdash;a big Wamboli spearman who was
stalking Greystoke up in the north country last fall. Let's see if
he's got it in for the rest of us;" but one by one Terkoz suffered
the others to approach Nu&mdash;only Curtiss seemed to rouse his
savage, protective instinct.</p>

<p>As they discussed their plans for the immediate future Nu opened
his eyes with a return of consciousness. At sight of the strange
figures about him he sat up and reached for his spear; but Barney
had had the foresight to remove this weapon as well as the man's
knife and hatchet from his reach.</p>

<p>As the cave man came to a sitting posture Barney laid a hand
upon his shoulder. "We shall not harm you," he said; "if you will
tell us what has become of my sister," and then placing his lips
close to the other's ear he whispered: "Where is Nat-ul?"</p>

<p>Nu understood but the single word, Nat-ul; but the friendly tone
and the hand upon his shoulder convinced him that this man was no
enemy. He shook his head negatively. "Nu does not understand the
stranger's tongue," he said. And then he asked the same question as
had Barney: "Where is Nat-ul?" But the American could translate
only the name, yet it told him that here indeed was the dream-man
of his sister.</p>

<p>When it became quite evident that the man could not understand
anything that they said to him, and that he was in no condition to
march, it was decided to send him back to the ranch by some of the
native carriers that accompanied the searching party, while the
others continued the search for the missing girl.</p>

<p>Terkoz suffered them to lift Nu in their arms and carry him
outside where he was transferred to a rude litter constructed with
a saddle blanket and two spears belonging to the Waziri hunters who
had accompanied them.</p>

<p>Barney felt that this man might prove the key to the solution of
Victoria's whereabouts, and so for fear that he might attempt to
escape he decided to accompany him personally, knowing that the
search for his sister would proceed as thoroughly without him as
with. In the meantime he might be working out some plan whereby he
could communicate with the stranger.</p>

<p>And so they set out for the ranch. Four half-naked blacks bore
the rude stretcher. Upon one side walked Terkoz, the wolfhound, and
upon the other, Barney Custer. Four Waziri warriors accompanied
them.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="cha9" id="cha9">IX. &mdash; NU GOES TO FIND NAT-UL</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Nu, weak and sick, was indifferent to his fate. If
he had been captured by enemies, well and good. He knew what to
expect&mdash;either slavery or death, for that was the way of men
as Nu knew them. If slavery, there was always the chance to escape.
If death, he would at least no longer suffer from loneliness in a
strange world far from his own people and his matchless Nat-ul;
whom he only saw now in his dreams.</p>

<p>He wondered what this strangely garbed stranger knew of Nat-ul.
The man had most certainly spoken her name. Could it be possible
that she, too, was a prisoner among these people? He had most
certainly seen her in the garden before the strange cave where he
had slain the diminutive Zor that had been about to devour her.
That was no dream, he was positive, and so she must indeed be a
prisoner.</p>

<p>As he recalled the lion he half smiled. What a runt of a beast
it had been indeed! Why old Zor who hunted in the forest of the
ape-people and dwelt in the caves upon the hither slopes of the
Barren Hills would have snapped that fellow up in two bites. And
Oo! A sneeze from Oo would have sent him scurrying into the Dark
Swamp where Oo could not venture because of his great weight. It
was an odd world in which Nu found himself. The country seemed
almost barren to him, and yet he was in the heart of tropical
Africa. The creatures seemed small and insignificant&mdash;yet the
lion he had killed was one of the largest that Brown or Greystoke
had ever seen&mdash;and he shivered, even in the heat of the
equatorial sun.</p>

<p>How he longed for the world of his birth, with its mighty
beasts, its gigantic vegetation, and its hot, humid atmosphere
through which its great, blurred sun appeared grotesquely large and
close at hand!</p>

<p>For a week they doctored Nu at the bungalow of the Greystokes.
There were times when they despaired of his life, for the bullet
wound that creased his temple clear to the skull had become
infected; but at last he commenced to mend, and after that his
recovery was rapid, for his constitution was that of untainted
physical perfection.</p>

<p>The several searching parties returned one by one without a clue
to the whereabouts of Victoria Custer. Barney knew that all was
being done that could be done by his friends; but he clung
tenaciously to the belief that the solution to the baffling mystery
lay locked in the breast of the strange giant who was convalescing
upon the cot that had been set up for him in Barney's own room, for
such had been the young American's wish. Curtiss had been relegated
to other apartments, and Barney stuck close to the bedside of his
patient day and night.</p>

<p>His principal reasons for so doing were his wish to prevent the
man's escape, and his desire to open some method of communication
with the stranger as rapidly as possible. Already the wounded man
had learned to make known his simpler wants in English, and the
ease with which he mastered whatever Barney attempted to teach him
assured the American of the early success of his venture in this
direction.</p>

<p>Curtiss continued to view the stranger with suspicion and
ill-disguised hostility. He was positive that the man had murdered
Victoria Custer, and failing to persuade the others that they
should take justice into their own hands and execute the prisoner
forthwith, he now insisted that he be taken to the nearest point at
which civilization had established the machinery of law and turned
over to the authorities.</p>

<p>Barney, on the other hand, was just as firm in his determination
to wait until the man had gained a sufficient command of English to
enable them to give him a fair hearing, and then be governed
accordingly. He could not forget that there had existed some
strange and inexplicable bond between this handsome giant and his
sister, nor that unquestionably the man had saved her life when
"old Raffles" had sprung upon her. Barney had loved and lost
because he had loved a girl beyond his reach, and so his sympathies
went out to this man who, he was confident, loved his sister.
Uncanny as her dreams had been, Barney was forced to admit that
there had been more to them than either Victoria or he had
imagined, and now he felt that for Victoria's sake he should
champion her dream-man in her absence.</p>

<p>One of the first things that Barney tried to impress upon the
man was that he was a prisoner, and lest he should escape by night
when Barney slept, Greystoke set Terkoz to watch over him. But Nu
did not seem inclined to wish to escape. His one desire apparently
was to master the strange tongue of his captors. For two weeks
after he was able to quit his bed he devoted his time to learning
English. He had the freedom of the ranch, coming and going as he
pleased, but his weapons were kept from him, hidden in Lord
Greystoke's study, and Barney, sometimes with others of the
household, always accompanied him.</p>

<p>Nu was waiting for Nat-ul. He was sure that she would come back
again to this cave that his new acquaintances called a bungalow.
Barney was waiting for the man to mention his sister. One day
Curtiss came upon Nu sitting upon the veranda. Terkoz lay at his
feet. Nu was clothed in khaki&mdash;an old suit of Greystoke's
being the largest that could be found upon the place, and that was
none too large. As Curtiss approached, the wolfhound turned his
wicked little eyes upon him, without moving his head from where it
lay stretched upon his forepaws, and growled. Nu extended a booted
foot across the beast's neck to hold him in check.</p>

<p>The hound's show of hostility angered Curtiss. He hated the
brute, and he hated Nu as cordially&mdash;just why, he did not
know, for it seemed that his hatred of the stranger was a thing
apart from his righteous anger in his belief that the man had
guilty knowledge of the fate of Victoria Custer. He halted in front
of the caveman.</p>

<p>"I want to ask you a question," he said coldly. "I have been
wanting to do so for a long time; but there has always been someone
else around."</p>

<p>Nu nodded. "What can Nu tell you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You can tell me where Miss Custer is," replied Curtiss.</p>

<p>"Miss Custer? I do not know what you mean. I never heard of Miss
Custer."</p>

<p>"You lie!" cried Curtiss, losing control of himself. "Her jacket
was found beneath your head in that foul den of yours."</p>

<p>Nu came slowly to his feet.</p>

<p>"What does 'lie' mean?" he asked. "I do not understand all that
people say to me, yet; but I can translate much from the manner and
tone of the saying, and I do not like your tone, Curtiss."</p>

<p>"Answer my question," cried Curtiss. "Where is Victoria Custer?
And when you speak to me remember that I'm Mr. Curtiss&mdash;you
damned white nigger."</p>

<p>"What does 'lie' mean?" persisted Nu. "And what is a 'nigger'?
And why should I call you mister? I do not like the sound of your
voice, Curtiss."</p>

<p>It was at this moment that Barney appeared. A single glance at
the attitude of the two men warned him that he was barely in time
to avert a tragedy. The black-haired giant stood with the bristling
wolfhound at his side. The attitude of the man resembled nothing
more closely than that of a big, black panther tensed for a spring.
Curtiss's hand was reaching for the butt of the gun at his hip.
Barney stepped between them.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this, Curtiss?" he asked sharply.
Curtiss had been a warm friend for years&mdash;a friend of
civilization, and luxury and ease. He had known Curtiss under
conditions which gave Curtiss everything that Curtiss wished, and
Curtiss had seemed a fine fellow, but lately, since Curtiss had
been crossed and disappointed, he had found sides to the man's
character that had never before presented themselves. His narrow
and unreasoning hatred for the half-savage white man had caused the
first doubts in Barney's mind as to the breadth of his friend's
character. And then&mdash;most unpardonable of sins&mdash;Curtiss
had grumbled at the hardships of the field while the searching
parties had been out. Butzow had told Barney of it, and of how
Curtiss had shirked much of the work which the other white men had
assumed when there had been a dearth of competent servants in the
camp.</p>

<p>Curtiss made no reply to Barney's question. Instead he turned on
his heel and walked away. Nu laid a hand upon the American's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"What does 'lie' mean, Custer?" he asked.</p>

<p>Barney tried to explain.</p>

<p>"I see," said Nu. "And what is a 'nigger' and a 'mister'?"</p>

<p>Again Barney did his best to explain.</p>

<p>"Who is Miss Custer?" Nu asked.</p>

<p>Barney looked at the man in surprise.</p>

<p>"Do you not know?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why should I?"</p>

<p>"She is my sister," said Barney, looking closely at the man.</p>

<p>"Your sister?" questioned Nu. "I did not know you had a sister,
Custer."</p>

<p>"You did not know my sister, Nat-ul?" cried Barney.</p>

<p>"Nat-ul!" exclaimed the man. "Nat-ul your sister?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I supposed that you knew it.</p>

<p>"But you are not Aht, son of Tha," said Nu, "and Nat-ul had no
other brother."</p>

<p>"I am brother of the girl you saved from the lion in the garden
yonder," said Barney. "Is it she you know as Nat-ul?"</p>

<p>"She was Nat-ul."</p>

<p>"Where is she?" cried Barney.</p>

<p>"I do not know," replied Nu. "I thought that she was a prisoner
among you and I have been waiting here quietly for her to be
brought back."</p>

<p>"You saw her last," said Barney. The time had come to have it
out with this man. "You saw her last. She was in your cave in the
mountain. We found her jacket there, and beside the spring this dog
lay senseless. What became of her?"</p>

<p>Nu stood with an expression of dull incomprehension upon his
fine features. It was as though he had received a stunning
blow.</p>

<p>"She was there?" he said at last in a low voice. "She was there
in my cave and I thought it was but a dream. She has gone away, and
for many days I have remained here doing nothing while she roams
amidst the dangers of the forest alone and unprotected. Unless,"
his tone became more hopeful, "she has found her way back to our
own people among the caves beside the Restless Sea. But how could
she? Not even I, a man and a great hunter, can even guess in what
direction lies the country of my father, Nu. Perhaps you can tell
me?"</p>

<p>Barney shook his head. His disappointment was great. He had been
sure that Nu could cast some light upon the whereabouts of
Victoria. He wondered if the man was telling him the truth. Doubts
began to assail him. It seemed scarce credible that Victoria could
have been in the fellow's lair without his knowing of her presence.
That she had been there there seemed little or no doubt. The only
other explanation was that Nu had, as Curtiss had suggested, stolen
her from the vicinity of the bungalow, killed her, and taken his
spear and her coat back to his cave with him; but that did not
account for the presence of the hound or the beast's evident
loyalty to the man.</p>

<p>Nu had turned from the veranda and entered the bungalow. Barney
followed him. The cave man was hunting about the house for
something.</p>

<p>"What are you looking for?" asked the American.</p>

<p>"My spear," replied Nu.</p>

<p>"What do you want of it?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to find Nat-ul."</p>

<p>Barney laid a hand upon the other's arm.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "you are not going away from here until we find
my sister&mdash;you are a prisoner. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>The cave man drew himself to his full height. There was a sneer
upon his lip. "Who can prevent me?"</p>

<p>Barney drew his revolver. "This," he said.</p>

<p>For a moment the man seemed plunged in thought. He looked at the
menacing gun, and then off through the open windows toward the
distant hills.</p>

<p>"I can wait, for her sake," he said.</p>

<p>"Don't make any attempt to escape," warned Barney. "You will be
watched carefully. Terkoz will give the alarm even if he should be
unable to stop you, though as a matter of fact he can stop you
easily enough. Were I you I should hate to be stopped by
Terkoz&mdash;he is as savage as a lion when aroused, and almost as
formidable."</p>

<p>Barney did not see the smile that touched the cave man's lips at
this for he had turned away to resume his chair upon the veranda.
Later Barney told the others that Nu seemed to realize the futility
of attempting to get away, but that night he locked their door
securely, placed the key under his pillow and drew his cot beneath
the double windows of their room. It would take a mighty stealthy
cat, thought he, to leave the apartment without arousing him, even
were Terkoz not stretched beside the prisoner's cot.</p>

<p>About midnight the cave man opened his eyes. The regular
breathing of the American attested the soundness of his slumber. Nu
extended a hand toward the sleeping Terkoz, at the same time making
a low, purring sound with his lips. The beast raised his head.</p>

<p>"Sh-h!" whispered Nu. Then he rose to a sitting posture, and
very carefully put his feet to the floor. Stooping he lifted the
heavy wolfhound in his arms. The only sign the animal made was to
raise his muzzle to the man's face and lick his cheek. Nu smiled.
He recalled Custer's words: "Terkoz will give the alarm even if he
should be unable to stop you."</p>

<p>The troglodyte approached the cot on which Barney lay in
peaceful slumber. He rested one hand upon the sill of the open
window, leaning across the sleeper. The hound was tucked under his
other arm. Without a sound he vaulted over the cot, through the
window and alighted noiselessly upon the veranda without. In the
garden he deposited Terkoz, telling him to wait there, then he
returned to the living room of the bungalow to fetch his spear, his
hatchet and his knife. A moment later the figures of a naked man
and a gaunt wolfhound swung away beneath the tropic moon across the
rolling plain toward the mountains to the south.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="cha10" id="cha10">X. &mdash; ON THE TRAIL</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">It was daylight when Barney Custer awoke. His
first thought was for his prisoner, and when his eyes fell upon the
empty cot across the room the American came to the center of the
floor with a single bound. Clad in his pajamas he ran out into the
living room and gave the alarm. In another moment the search was
on, but no sign of the caveman was to be found, nor of the guardian
Terkoz.</p>

<p>"He must have killed the dog," insisted Greystoke; but they
failed to find the beast's body, for the excellent reason that at
that very moment Terkoz, bristling with anger, was nosing about the
spot where, nearly a month before, he had been struck down by the
Arab, as he had sought to protect the girl to whom he had attached
himself.</p>

<p>As he searched the spot his equally savage companion hastened to
the cave further up the mountainside, and with his knife unearthed
the head of Oo which he had buried there in the soft earth of a
crevice within the lair. The trophy was now in a rather sad state
of putrefaction, and Nu felt that he must forego the pleasure of
laying it intact at the feet of his future mate; but the great
saber-teeth were there and the skull. He removed the former,
fastening them to his gee string and laid the balance of the head
outside the cave where vultures might strip it clean of flesh
against Nu's return, for he did not wish to be burdened with it
during his search for Nat-ul.</p>

<p>A deep bay from Terkoz presently announced the finding of the
trail and at the signal Nu leaped down the mountainside where the
impatient beast awaited him. A moment later the two savage trailers
were speeding away upon the spoor of the Arab slave and ivory
raiders. Though the trail was old it still was sufficiently plain
for these two. The hound's scent was but a trifle more acute than
his human companion's, but the man depended almost solely upon the
tell-tale evidences which his eyes could apprehend, leaving the
scent-spoor to the beast, for thus it had been his custom to hunt
with the savage wolfish progenitors of Terkoz a hundred thousand
years before.</p>

<p>They moved silently and swiftly through the jungle, across
valleys, over winding hill-trails, wherever the broad path of the
caravan led. In a day they covered as much ground as the caravan
had covered in a week. By night they slept at the foot of some
great tree, the man and beast curled up together; or crawled within
dark caves when the way led through the mountains; or, when Zor,
the lion, was abroad the man would build a rude platform high among
the branches of a tree that he and the hound might sleep in peace
throughout the night.</p>

<p>Nu saw strange sights that filled him with wonder and sealed his
belief that he had been miraculously transferred to another world.
There were villages of black men, some of which gave evidence of
recent conflict. Burned huts and mutilated corpses were all that
remained of many, and in others only a few old men and women were
to be seen.</p>

<p>He also passed herds of giraffe-a beast that had been unknown in
his own world, and many elephant which reminded him of Gluh, the
mammoth. But all these beasts were smaller than those he had known
in his other life, nor nearly so ferocious. Why, he could scarce
recall a beast of any description that did not rush into a
death-struggle with the first member of another species which it
came upon&mdash;provided, of course, that it stood the slightest
show of dispatching its antagonist. Of course there had been the
smaller and more timid animals whose entire existence had consisted
in snatching what food they could as they fled through the savage
days and awful nights of that fierce age in the perpetual effort to
escape or elude the countless myriads of huge carnivora and
bellicose ruminants whose trails formed a mighty network from pole
to pole.</p>

<p>So to Nu the jungles of Africa seemed silent and deserted
places. The beasts, even the more savage of them, seldom attacked
except in hunger or the protection of their young. Why, he had
passed within a dozen paces of a great herd of these diminutive,
hairless mammoths and they had but raised their little, pig eyes
and glanced at him, as they flapped their great ears back and forth
against the annoying flies and browsed upon the branches of young
trees.</p>

<p>The ape-people seemed frightened out of their wits at his
approach, and he had even seen the tawny bodies of lions pass
within a stone's throw of him without charging. It was amazing.
Life in such a world would scarce be worth the living. It made him
lonelier than ever to feel that he could travel for miles without
encountering a single danger.</p>

<p>Far behind him along the trail of the Arabs came a dozen white
men and half a hundred savage Waziri warriors. Not an hour after
Barney Custer discovered Nu's absence a native runner had come
hurrying in from the north to beg Lord Greystoke's help in pursuing
and punishing a band of Arab slave and ivory raiders who were
laying waste the villages, murdering the old men and the children
and carrying the young men and women into slavery.</p>

<p>While Greystoke was questioning the fellow he let drop the fact
that among the other prisoners of the Arabs was a young white
woman. Instantly commotion reigned upon the Greystoke ranch. White
men were jumping into field khaki, looking to firearms and
ammunition lest their black body servants should have neglected
some essential. Stable boys were saddling the horses, and the
sleek, ebon warriors of Uziri were greasing their black hides,
adjusting barbaric war bonnets, streaking faces, breasts, limbs and
bellies with ocher, vermillion or ghastly bluish white, and looking
to slim shield, poisoned arrow and formidable war spear.</p>

<p>For a time the fugitive was forgotten, but as the march
proceeded they came upon certain reminders that recalled him to
their thoughts and indicated that he was far in advance of them
upon the trail of the Arabs. The first sign of him was the carcass
of a bull buffalo. Straight through the heart was the great hole
that they now knew was made by the passage of the ancient, stone
tipped spear. Strips had been knife cut from the sides, and the
belly was torn as though by a wild beast. Brown stooped to examine
the ground about the bull. When he straightened up he looked at
Greystoke and laughed.</p>

<p>"Didn't I understand you to say that he must have killed the
dog?" he asked. "Look here&mdash;they ate side by side from the

<h2><a name="cha11" id="cha11">XI. &mdash; THE ABDUCTION</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">For three weeks now Victoria Custer had been a
prisoner of Sheik Ibn Aswad, but other than the ordinary hardships
of African travel she had experienced nothing of which she might
complain. She had even been permitted to ride upon one of the few
donkeys that still survived, and her food was as good as that of
Ibn Aswad himself, for the canny old sheik knew that the better the
condition of his prisoner the better the price she would bring at
the court of the sultan of Fulad.</p>

<p>Abul Mukarram, Ibn Aswad's right-hand man, a swaggering young
Arab from the rim of the Sahara, had cast covetous eyes upon the
beautiful prisoner, but the old sheik delivered himself of a
peremptory no when his lieutenant broached a proposal to him. Then
Abul Mukarram, balked in his passing desire found the thing growing
upon him until the idea of possessing the girl became a veritable
obsession with him.</p>

<p>Victoria, forced to it by necessity, had picked up enough of the
language of the sons of the desert to be able to converse with
them, and Abul Mukarram often rode at her side feasting his eyes
upon her face and figure the while he attempted to ingratiate
himself into her esteem by accounts of his prowess; but when at
last he spoke of love the girl turned her flushed and angry face
away from him, and reining in her donkey refused to ride further
beside him.</p>

<p>Ibn Aswad from afar witnessed the altercation, and when he rode
to Victoria's side and learned the truth of the matter he berated
Abul Mukarram roundly, ordered him to the rear of the column and
placed another Arab over the prisoner. Thereafter the venomous
looks which the discredited Abul cast upon Victoria often-times
caused her to shudder inwardly, for she knew that she had made a
cruel and implacable enemy of the man.</p>

<p>Ibn Aswad had given her but a hint of the fate which awaited
her, yet it had been sufficient to warn her that death were better
than the thing she was being dragged through the jungles to suffer.
Every waking minute her mind was occupied with plans for escape,
yet not one presented itself which did not offer insuperable
obstacles.</p>

<p>Even had she been able to leave the camp undetected how long
could she hope to survive in the savage jungle? And should, by some
miracle, her life be spared even for months, of what avail would
that be, for she could no more have retraced her way to Lord
Greystoke's ranch than she could have laid a true course upon the
trackless ocean.</p>

<p>The horrors of the march that passed daily in hideous review
before her left her sick and disgusted. The cruelly beaten slaves
who carried the great burdens of ivory, tents and provisions
brought tears to her eyes. The brutal massacres that followed the
forcible entrance into each succeeding village wrung her heart and
aroused her shame for those beasts in human form who urged on their
savage and cowardly Manyuema cannibals to commit nameless excesses
against the cowering prisoners that fell into their hands.</p>

<p>But at last they came to a village where victory failed to rush
forward and fall into their arms. Instead they were met with sullen
resistance. Ferocious, painted devils fought them stubbornly every
inch of the way, until Ibn Aswad decided to make a detour and pass
around the village rather than sacrifice more of his followers.</p>

<p>In the confusion of the fight, and the near-retreat which
followed it, Abul Mukarram found the opportunity he had been
awaiting. The prisoners, including the white girl, were being
pushed ahead of the retreating raiders, while the Arabs and
Manyuema brought up the rear, fighting off the pursuing
savages.</p>

<p>Now Abul Mukarram knew a way to the northland that two might
traverse with ease, and over which one could fairly fly; but which
was impossible for a slave caravan because it passed through the
territory of the English. If the girl would accompany him
willingly, well and good&mdash;if not, then he would go alone but
not before he had committed upon her the revenge he had planned. He
left the firing line, therefore, and pushed his way through the
terror-stricken slaves to the side of the Arab who guarded Victoria
Custer.</p>

<p>"Go back to Ibn Aswad," he said to the Arab. "He desires your
presence."</p>

<p>The other looked at him closely for a moment. "You lie, Abul
Mukarram," he said at last. "Ibn Aswad commanded me particularly
against permitting you to be alone with the girl. Go to!"</p>

<p>"Fool!" muttered Abul Mukarram, and with the word he pulled the
trigger of the long gun that rested across the pommel of his saddle
with its muzzle scarce a foot from the stomach of the other Arab.
With a single shriek the man lunged from his donkey.</p>

<p>"Come!" cried Abul Mukarram, seizing the bridle of Victoria's
beast and turning into the jungle to the west.</p>

<p>The girl tried to slip from her saddle, but a strong arm went
about her waist and held her firm as the two donkeys forged,
shoulder to shoulder through the tangled mass of creepers which all
but blocked their way. Once Victoria screamed for help, but the
savage war cries of the natives drowned her voice. Fifteen minutes
later the two came out upon the trail again that they had followed
when they approached the village and soon the sounds of the
conflict behind them grew fainter and fainter until they were lost
entirely in the distance.</p>

<p>Victoria Custer's mind was working rapidly, casting about for
some means of escape from the silent figure at her side. A revolver
or even a knife would have solved her difficulty, but she had
neither. Had she, the life of Abul Mukarram would have been worth
but little, for the girl was beside herself with hopeless horror of
the fate that now loomed so close at hand. The thought that she had
not even the means to take her own life left her numb and cold.
There was but one way; to battle with tooth and nail until, in
anger, the man himself should kill her; yet until the last moment
she might hope against hope for the succor which she knew in her
heart of hearts it was impossible to receive.</p>

<p>For the better part of two hours Abul Mukarram kept on away from
the master he had robbed. He spoke but little, and when he did it
was in the tone of the master to his slave. Near noon they left the
jungle and came out into a higher country where the space between
the trees was greater, and there was little or no underbrush.
Traveling was much easier here and they made better time. They were
still retracing the trail along which the caravan had traveled. It
would be some time during the next morning that they would turn
north again upon a new trail.</p>

<p>Beside a stream Abul Mukarram halted. He tethered the donkeys,
and then turned toward the girl. "Come," he said, and laid his hand
upon her.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="cha12" id="cha12">XII. &mdash; THE CAVE MAN FINDS HIS
MATE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Each day Nu realized that he was gaining rapidly
upon those with whom Nat-ul traveled. The experiences of his other
life assured him that she must be a prisoner, yet at the same time
he realized that such might not be the case at all, for had he not
thought her a prisoner among the others who had held him prisoner,
only to learn that one of them claimed her as a sister. It all
seemed very strange to Nu. It was quite beyond him. Nat-ul could
not be the sister of Custer, and yet he had seen her apparently
happy and contented in the society of these strangers, and Custer
unquestionably appeared to feel for her the solicitude of a
brother. Curtiss, it was evident, loved Nat-ul&mdash;that much he
had gleaned from conversations he had overheard between him and
Custer. How the man could have become so well acquainted with
Nat-ul between the two days that had elapsed since Nu had set forth
from the caves beside the Restless Sea to hunt down Oo and the
morning that he had awakened following the mighty shaking of the
world was quite as much a mystery as was the remarkable changes
that had taken place in the aspect of the world during the same
brief period. Nu had given much thought to those miraculous
happenings, with the result that he had about convinced himself
that he must have slept much longer than he had believed; but that
a hundred thousand years had rolled their slow and weary progress
above his unconscious head could not, of course, have occurred to
him even as the remotest of possibilities.</p>

<p>He had also weighed the sneering words of Curtiss and with them
the attitude of the strangers with whom he had been thrown. He had
quickly appreciated the fact that their manners and customs were as
far removed from his as they were from those of the beasts of the
jungle. He had seen that his own ways were more in accordance with
the ways of the black and half-naked natives whom the whites looked
upon as so much their inferiors that they would not even eat at the
same table with them.</p>

<p>He had noted the fact that the blacks treated the other whites
with a marked respect which they did not extend to Nu, and being no
fool Nu had come to the conclusion that the whites themselves
looked upon him as an inferior, even before Curtiss's words
convinced him of the truth of his suspicions. Evidently, though his
skin was white, he was in some subtle way different from the other
whites. Possibly it was in the matter of raiment. He had tried to
wear the strange body coverings they had given him, but they were
cumbersome and uncomfortable and though he was seldom warm enough
now he had nevertheless been glad when the opportunity came to
discard the hampering and unaccustomed clothing.</p>

<p>These thoughts suggested the possibility that if Nat-ul had
found recognition among the strangers upon an equal footing with
them that she, too, might have those attributes of superiority
which the strangers claimed, and if such was the fact it became
evident that she would consider Nu from the viewpoint of her new
friends&mdash;as an inferior.</p>

<p>Such reveries made Nu very sad, for he loved Nat-ul just as you
or I would love&mdash;just as normal white men have always
loved&mdash;with a devotion that placed the object of his affection
upon a pedestal before which he was happy to bow down and worship.
His passion was not of the brute type of the inferior races which
oftentimes solemnizes the marriage ceremony with a cudgel and ever
places the woman in the position of an inferior and a chattel.</p>

<p>Even as Nu pondered the puzzling questions which confronted him
his eyes and ears were alert as he sped along the now fresh trail
of the caravan. Every indication pointed the recent passing of many
men, and the troglodyte was positive that he could be but a few
hours behind his quarry.</p>

<p>A few miles east of him the rescue party from the Greystoke
ranch were pushing rapidly ahead upon a different trail with a view
to heading off the Arabs. Ibn Aswad had taken a circuitous route in
order that he might pass around the Country of the Waziri, and with
his slow moving slave caravan he had now reached a point but a few
days' journey in a direct line from the ranch. The lightly equipped
pursuers having knowledge of the route taken by the Arabs from the
messenger who had come to seek their assistance had not been
compelled to follow the spoor of their quarry but instead had
marched straight across country in a direct line for a point which
they believed would bring them ahead of the caravan.</p>

<p>Thus it was that Nu and Terkoz, and the party of whites and
Waziri from the ranch were closing in upon Ibn Aswad from opposite
directions simultaneously; but Nu was not destined to follow the
trail of the raiders to where they were still engaged in repelling
the savage attacks of the fierce Wamboli, for as he trotted along
with the dog at his side his quick eyes detected that which the
hound, with all his wondrous instinctive powers, would have passed
by, unnoticing&mdash;the well-marked prints of the hoofs of two
donkeys that had come back along the trail since the caravan had
passed.</p>

<p>That they were donkeys belonging to the Arabs was evident to Nu
through his familiarity with the distinctive hoof prints of each,
which during the past three days had become as well known to him as
his mother's face had been. But what were they doing retracing the
way they had but just covered! Nu halted and raised his head to
sniff the air and listen intently for the faintest sound from the
direction in which the beasts had gone when they left the old trail
at the point where he had discovered their spoor.</p>

<p>But the wind was blowing from the opposite direction, so there
was no chance that Nu could scent them. He was in doubt as to
whether he should leave the trail of the main body and follow these
two, or continue on his way. From the manner of their
passing&mdash;side by side&mdash;he was convinced that each carried
a rider, since otherwise they would have gone in single file after
the manner of beasts moving along a none too wide trail; but there
was nothing to indicate that either rider was Nat-ul.</p>

<p>For an instant he hesitated, and then his judgment told him to
keep on after the main body, for if Nat-ul was a prisoner she would
be with the larger force&mdash;not riding in the opposite direction
with a single guard. Even as he turned to take up the pursuit again
there came faintly to his ears from the jungle at his left the
sound of a human voice&mdash;it was a woman's, raised in frightened
protest.</p>

<p>Like a deer Nu turned and leaped in the direction of that
familiar voice. The fleet wolfhound was put to it to keep pace with
the agile caveman, for Nu had left the earth and taken to the
branches of the trees where no underbrush retarded his swift
flight. From tree to tree he leaped or swung, sometimes hurling his
body twenty feet through the air from one jungle giant to another.
Below him raced the panting Terkoz, red tongue lolling from his
foam flecked mouth; but with all their speed the two moved with the
noiselessness of shadowy ghosts.</p>

<p>At the edge of the jungle Nu came upon a parklike forest, and
well into this he saw a white-robed Arab forcing a woman slowly
backward across his knee. One sinewy, brown hand clutched her
throat, the other was raised to strike her in the face.</p>

<p>Nu saw that he could not reach the man in time to prevent the
blow, but he might distract his attention for the moment that would
be required for him to reach his side. From his throat there rose
the savage war cry of his long dead people&mdash;a cry that brought
a hundred jungle creatures to their feet trembling in fear or in
rage according to their kind. And it brought Abul Mukarram
upstanding too, for in all his life he had never heard the like of
that blood-freezing challenge.</p>

<p>At the sight which met his eyes he dropped the girl and darted
toward his donkey where hung his long-barreled rifle in its boot.
Victoria Custer looked, too, and what she saw brought unutterable
relief and happiness to her. Then the Arab had turned with levelled
gun just as the cave man leaped upon him. There was the report of
the firearm ere it was wrenched from Abul Mukarram's grasp and
hurled to one side, but the bullet went wide of its mark and the
next instant the girl saw the two men locked in what she knew was a
death struggle. The Arab struck mighty blows at the head and face
of his antagonist, while the cave man, the great muscles rolling
beneath his smooth hide, sought for a hold upon the other's
throat.</p>

<p>About the two the vicious wolfhound slunk growling with
bristling hair, waiting for an opportunity to rush in upon the
white-robed antagonist of his master. Victoria Custer, her clenched
fists tight pressed against her bosom, watched the two men who
battled for her. She saw the handsome black head of her savage man
bend lower and lower toward the throat of his foeman, and when the
strong, white teeth buried themselves in the jugular of the other
it was with no sickening qualm of nausea that the girl witnessed
the bestial act.</p>

<p>She heard the half-wolfish growl of Nu as he tasted the hot, red
blood of his enemy. She saw the strong jaws tear and rend the soft
flesh of the Arab's throat. She saw the powerful hands bend back
the head of the doomed Abul Mukarram. She saw her ferocious mate
shake the man as a terrier shakes a rat, and her heart swelled in
fierce primitive pride at the prowess of her man.</p>

<p>No longer did Victoria Custer exist. It was Nat-ul, the savage
maiden of the Niocene who, as Nu threw the lifeless corpse of his
kill to one side, and opened his arms, flung herself into his
embrace. It was Nat-ul, daughter of Tha&mdash;Nat-ul of the tribe
of Nu that dwelt beyond the Barren Cliffs beside the Restless Sea
who threw her arms about her lord and master's neck and drew his
mouth down to her hot lips.</p>

<p>It was Nat-ul of the first-born who watched Nu and the fierce
wolfhound circle about the corpse of the dead Arab. The cave man,
moving in the graceful, savage steps of the death dance of his
tribe, now bent half over, now leaping high in the air, throwing
his stone-tipped spear aloft, chanted the weird victory song of a
dead and buried age, and beside him his equally savage mate
squatted upon her haunches beating time with her slim, white
hands.</p>

<p>When the dance was done Nu halted before Nat-ul. The girl rose,
facing him and for a long minute the two stood in silence looking
at one another. It was the first opportunity that either had had to
study the features of the other since the strange miracle that had
separated them. Nu found that some subtle change had taken place in
his Nat-ul. It was she&mdash;of that there could be no doubt; but
yet there was that about her which cast a spell of awe over
him&mdash;she was infinitely finer and more wonderful than he ever
had realized.</p>

<p>With the passing of the excitement of the battle and the dance
the strange ecstasy which had held the girl in thrall passed slowly
away. The rhythm of the dancing of the savage, black-haired giant
had touched some chord within her which awoke the long dormant
instincts of the primordial. For the time she had been carried back
a hundred thousand years to the childhood of the human
race&mdash;she had not known for those brief instants Victoria
Custer, or the twentieth century, or its civilization, for they
were yet a thousand centuries in the future.</p>

<p>But now she commenced once more to look through the eyes of
generations of culture and refinement. Before her she saw a savage,
primitive man. In his eyes was the fire of a great love that would
not for long be denied. About her she saw the wild, fierce forest
and the cruel jungle, and behind all this, and beyond, her vision
wandered to the world she had always known&mdash;the world of
cities and homes and gentle-folk. She saw her father and her mother
and her friends. What would they say?</p>

<p>Again she let her eyes rest upon the man. It was with difficulty
that she restrained a mad desire to throw herself upon his broad
breast and weep out her doubts and fears close to the beating of
his great heart and in the safety of those mighty, protecting arms.
But with the wish there arose again the question&mdash;what would
they say?&mdash;held her trembling and frightened from him.</p>

<p>The man saw something of the girl's trouble in her eyes, but he
partially misinterpreted it, for he read fear of himself where
there was principally self-fear, and because of what he had heard
Curtiss say he thought that he saw contempt too, for primitive
people are infinitely more sensitive than their more sophisticated
brothers.</p>

<p>"You do not love me, Nat-ul?" he asked. "Have the strangers
turned you against me? What one of them could have fetched you the
head of Oo, the man hunter? See!" He tapped the two great tusks
that hung from his loin cloth. "Nu slew the mightiest of beasts for
his Nat-ul&mdash;the head is buried in the cave of Oo&mdash;yet now
that I come to take you as my mate I see fear in your eyes and
something else which never was there before. What is it,
Nat-ul&mdash;have the strangers stolen your love from Nu?"</p>

<p>The man spoke in a tongue so ancient that in all the world there
lived no man who spoke or knew a word of it, yet to Victoria Custer
it was as intelligible as her own English, nor did it seem strange
to her that she answered Nu in his own language.</p>

<p>"My heart tells me that I am yours, Nu," she said, "but my
judgment and my training warn me against the step that my heart
prompts. I love you; but I could not be happy to wander, half
naked, through the jungle for the balance of my life, and if I go
with you now, even for a day, I may never return to my people. Nor
would you be happy in the life that I lead&mdash;it would stifle
and kill you. I think I see now something of the miracle that has
overwhelmed us. To you it has been but a few days since you left
your Nat-ul to hunt down the ferocious Oo; but in reality countless
ages have rolled by. By some strange freak of fate you have
remained unchanged during all these ages until now you step forth
from your long sleep an unspoiled cave man of the stone age into
the midst of the twentieth century, while I, doubtless, have been
born and reborn a thousand times, merging from one incarnation to
another until in this we are again united. Had you, too, died and
been born again during all these weary years no gap of ages would
intervene between us now and we should meet again upon a common
footing as do other souls, and mate and die to be born again to a
new mating and a new life with its inevitable death. But you have
defied the laws of life and death&mdash;you have refused to die and
now that we meet again at last a hundred thousand years lie between
us&mdash;an unbridgeable gulf across which I may not return and
over which you may not come other than by the same route which I
have followed&mdash;through death and a new life thereafter."</p>

<p>Much that the girl said was beyond Nu's comprehension, and the
most of it without the scope of his primitive language so that she
had been forced to draw liberally upon her twentieth century
English to fill in the gaps, yet Nu had caught the idea in a vague
sort of way&mdash;at least that his Nat-ul was far removed from him
because of a great lapse of time that had occurred while he slept
in the cave of Oo, and that through his own death alone could he
span the gulf between them and claim her as his mate.</p>

<p>He placed the butt of his spear upon the ground, resting the
stone tip against his heart.</p>

<p>"I go, Nat-ul," he said simply, "that I may return again as you
would have me&mdash;no longer the 'white nigger' that Curtiss says
I am."</p>

<p>The girl and the man were so occupied and engrossed with their
own tragedy that they did not note the restless pacing of Terkoz,
the wolfhound, or hear the ominous growls that rumbled from his
savage throat as he looked toward the jungle behind them.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="cha13" id="cha13">XIII. &mdash; INTO THE JUNGLE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">The searching party from the Greystoke ranch had
come upon Ibn Aswad so unexpectedly that not a shot had been
exchanged between the two parties. The Arabs pressed from behind by
the savage Wamboli warriors had literally run into the arms of the
whites and the Waziri.</p>

<p>When Greystoke demanded that the white girl be turned over to
him at once Ibn Aswad smote his breast and swore that there had
been no white girl with them, but one of the slaves told a
different story to a Waziri, and when the whites found that
Victoria had been stolen from Ibn Aswad by one of the sheik's
lieutenants only a few hours before they hastened to scour the
jungle in search of her.</p>

<p>To facilitate their movements and insure covering as wide a
territory as possible each of the whites took a few Waziri and
spreading out in a far-flung skirmish line beat the jungle in the
direction toward which the slave had told them Abul Mukarram had
ridden.</p>

<p>To comb the jungle finely each white spread his Waziri upon
either side of him and thus they advanced, seldom in sight of one
another, but always within hailing distance. And so it happened
that chance brought William Curtiss, unseen, to the edge of the
jungle beside the park-like forest beneath the giant trees of which
he saw a tableau that brought him to a sudden halt.</p>

<p>There was the girl he loved and sought, apparently unharmed, and
two donkeys, and the dead body of an Arab, and the great wolfhound,
looking toward his hiding place and growling menacingly; and before
the girl the savage white man stood. Curtiss was about to spring
forward when he saw the man place the butt of his spear upon the
ground and the point against his heart. The act and the expression
upon the man's face proclaimed his intention, and so Curtiss drew
back again waiting for the perpetration of the deed that he knew
was coming. A smile of anticipation played about the American's
lips.</p>

<p>Victoria Custer, too, guessed the thing that Nu contemplated. It
was, in accordance with her own reasoning, the only logical thing
for the man to do; but love is not logical, and when love saw and
realized the imminence of its bereavement it cast logic to the
winds, and with a little scream of terror the girl threw herself
upon Nu of the Niocene, striking the spear from its goal.</p>

<p>"No! No!" she cried. "You must not do it. I cannot let you go. I
love you, Nu; oh, how I love you," and as the strong arms enfolded
her once more she gave a happy sigh of content and let her head
drop again upon the breast of him who had come back out of the ages
to claim her.</p>

<p>The man put an arm about her waist, and together the two turned
toward the west in the direction that Abul Mukarram had been
fleeing; nor did either see the white-faced, scowling man who
leaped from the jungle behind them, and with leveled rifle took
deliberate aim at the back of the black-haired giant.</p>

<p>Nor did they see the swift spring of the wolfhound, nor the
thing that followed there beneath the brooding silence of the
savage jungle.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Barney Custer broke through the tangled wall
of verdure upon a sight that took his breath away&mdash;there stood
the two patient donkeys, switching their tails and flapping their
long ears; beside them lay the corpse of Abul Mukarram, and upon
the edge of the jungle, at his feet, was stretched the dead body of
William Curtiss, his breast and throat torn by savage fangs. Across
the clearing a great, gaunt wolfhound halted in its retreat at the
sound of Barney's approach. It bared its bloody fangs in an ominous
growl of warning, and then turned and disappeared into the
jungle.</p>

<p>Barney advanced and examined the soft ground about the donkeys
and the body of the Arab. He saw the imprints of a man's naked
feet, and the smaller impress of a woman's riding boot. He looked
toward the jungle where Terkoz had disappeared.</p>

<p>What had his sister gone to within the somber, savage depths
beyond? What would he bring her back to were he to follow after? He
doubted that she would come without her dream-man. Where would she
be happier with him&mdash;in the pitiless jungle which was the only
world he knew, or in the still more pitiless haunts of civilized
men?</p>

<h2><a name="part_2" id="part_2">SWEETHEART PRIMEVAL</a>
</h2>

<h3><a name="chb1" id="chb1">I. &mdash; AGAIN A WORLD UPHEAVAL</a>
</h3>

<p class="first">Victoria Custer was aware that Barney Custer, her
brother, was forcing his way through the jungle behind
them&mdash;that he was coming to take her away from Nu.</p>

<p>Many lifetimes of culture and refinement pleaded with her to
relinquish her mad, idyllic purpose&mdash;to give up her savage man
and return to the protection and comforts that her brother and
civilization represented. But there was still another force at
work, older by far than the brief span of cultivation that had
marked the advancement of her more recent forebears&mdash;the
countless ages of prehistoric savagery in which the mind and heart
and soul of man were born&mdash;the countless awful ages that have
left upon the soul and heart and mind of man an impress that will
endure so long as man endures. From out of that black abyss before
man had either mind or soul there still emanates the same mighty
power that was his sole master then&mdash;instinct. And it was
instinct that drove Victoria Custer deeper into the jungle with her
savage lover as she sensed the nearer approach of her
brother&mdash;one of the two master instincts that have dominated
and preserved life upon the face of the earth. Yet it was not
without a struggle. She hesitated, half turning backward. Nu cast a
questioning look upon her.</p>

<p>"They are coming, Nat-ul," he said. "Nu cannot fight these
strange men who hurl lead with the thunders they have stolen from
the skies. Come! We must hurry back to the cave of Oo, and on the
morrow we shall go forth and search for the tribe of Nu, my father,
that dwells beyond the Barren Cliffs beside the Restless Sea.
There, in our own world, we shall be happy."</p>

<p>And yet the girl held back, afraid. Then the man gathered her in
his mighty arms and ran on in the direction of the cave of Oo, the
saber-toothed tiger. The girl did not even struggle to escape,
instead she lay quietly, as over her fell a sensation of peace and
happiness, as though, after a long absence, she was being borne
home. And at their heels trotted Terkoz, the wolfhound.</p>

<p>Sometimes Nu took to the lower branches of the trees, for in his
own age his race had been semiarboreal. Here he traveled with the
ease and agility of a squirrel, though oftentimes the modern woman
that still lived in the breast of Victoria Custer quailed at the
dizzy leaps, and the swaying, perilous trail. Yet, as they fled,
her fears were greatest now that they might be overtaken, and
herself snatched back into the world of civilization where her Nu
could never follow.</p>

<p>It was dusk of the third evening when they came again to the
cave of Oo. Up the steep cliff side they clambered, hand in hand.
Together they entered the dark and forbidding hole.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow," said Nu, "we will search for the caves of our
people, and we shall find them."</p>

<p>Darkness settled upon the jungle, the plain and the mountains.
Nu and Nat-ul slept, for both were exhausted from the long days of
flight.</p>

<p>And then there came, out of the bowels of the earth, a deep and
ominous rumbling. The earth shook. The cliff rocked. Great masses
of shattered rock shaken from its summit roared and tumbled down
its face.</p>

<p>Nu sprang to his feet, only to be hurled immediately to the
floor of the cave stunned and senseless. Within all was darkness.
No light filtered through the opening. For minutes the frightful
din endured, and with it the sickening tossing of the earth; but,
at last, the rumblings ceased, the world sank back to rest,
exhausted.</p>

<p>And Nu lay unconscious where he had fallen.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chb2" id="chb2">II. &mdash; BACK TO THE STONE AGE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">It was morning when Nat-ul awoke. The sun was
streaming in across a wide sea to illumine the interior of the cave
where she lay huddled in a great pile of soft, furry pelts. Near
her lay a woman, older than herself, but still beautiful. In front
of them, nearer the mouth of the cave, two men slept. One was Tha,
her father, and the other her brother, Aht. The woman was Nat-ul's
mother, Lu-tan. Now she, too, opened her eyes. She stretched,
raising her bare, brown arms above her head, and half turning on
her side toward Nat-ul&mdash;it was the luxurious movement of the
she-tiger&mdash;the embodiment of perfect health and grace. Lu-tan
smiled at her daughter, exposing a row of strong, white, even
teeth. Nat-ul returned the smile.</p>

<p>"I am glad that it is light again," said the girl. "The shaking
of the ground, yesterday, frightened me, so that I had the most
terrible dreams all during the darkness&mdash;ugh!" and Nat-ul
shuddered.</p>

<p>Tha opened his eyes and looked at the two women.</p>

<p>"I, too, dreamed," he said. "I dreamed that the earth shook
again; the cliffs sank; and the Restless Sea rolled in upon them,
drowning us all. This is no longer a good place to live. After we
have eaten I shall go speak to Nu, telling him that we should seek
other caves in a new country."</p>

<p>Nat-ul rose and stepping between the two men came to the ledge
before the entrance to the cave. Before her stretched a scene that
was perfectly familiar and yet strangely new. Below her was an open
patch at the foot of the cliff, all barren and boulder strewn
except for a rude rectangle that had been cleared of rock and
debris. Beyond lay a narrow strip of tangled tropical jungle.
Enormous fern-like trees lifted their huge fronds a hundred feet
into the air. The sun was topping the horizon, coming out of a
great sea that lay just beyond the jungle. And such a sun! It was
dull red and swollen to an enormous size. The atmosphere was thick
and hot&mdash;almost sticky. And the life! Such countless myriads
of creatures teeming through the jungle, winging their way through
the air, and blackening the surface of the sea!</p>

<p>Nat-ul knit her brows. She was trying to think&mdash;trying to
recall something. Was it her dream that she attempted to visualize,
or was this the dream? She shook herself. Then she glanced quickly
down at her apparel. For an instant she seemed not to comprehend
the meaning of her garmenture&mdash;the single red-doe skin, or the
sandals of the thick hide of Ta, the woolly rhinoceros, held to her
shapely feet by thin lacings of the rawhide of the great Bos. And
yet, she quickly realized, she had always been clothed just
thus&mdash;but, had she? The question puzzled her.</p>

<p>Mechanically her hand slipped to the back of her head above the
nape of her neck. A look of puzzlement entered her eyes as her
fingers fell upon the loose strands of her long hair that tumbled
to her waist in the riotous and lovely confusion of early morning.
What was it that her light touch missed? A barrette? What could
Nat-ul, child of the stone age, know of barrettes?</p>

<p>Slowly her fingers felt about her head. When they came in
contact with the broad fillet that bound her hair back from her
forehead she smiled. This was the fillet that Nu, the son of Nu,
had fashioned for her from a single gorgeous snake skin of black
and red and yellow, split lengthwise and dried. It awoke her to a
more vivid realization of the present. She turned and reentered the
cave. From a wooden peg driven into a hole in the wall she took a
handful of brilliant feathers. These she stuck in the front of the
fillet, where they nodded in a gay plume above her sweet face.</p>

<p>By this time Lu-tan, Tha, and Aht had risen. The older woman was
busying herself with some dry tinder and a fire stick, just inside
the entrance to the cave. Tha and Aht had stepped out upon the
ledge, filling their lungs with the morning air. Nat-ul joined
them. In her hand was a bladder. The three clambered down the face
of the cliff.</p>

<p>Other men and women were emerging from other caves that pitted
the rocky escarpment. They greeted the three with smiles and
pleasant words, and upon every tongue was some comment upon the
earthquake of the preceding night.</p>

<p>Tha and Aht went into the jungle toward the sea. Nat-ul stopped
beside a little spring, that bubbled, clear and cold, at the foot
of the cliff. Here were other girls with bladders which they were
filling with water. There was Ra-el, daughter of Kor, who made the
keenest spear tips and the best balanced. And there was Una,
daughter of Nu, the chief, and sister of Nu, the son of Nu. And
beside these were half a dozen others&mdash;all clean limbed, fine
featured girls, straight as arrows, supple as panthers. They
laughed and talked as they filled their bladders at the spring.</p>

<p>"Were you not frightened when the earth shook, Nat-ul?" asked
Una.</p>

<p>"I was frightened," replied Nat-ul&mdash;"yes; but I was more
frightened by the dream I had after the shaking had stopped."</p>

<p>"What did you dream?" cried Ra-el, daughter of Kor&mdash;Kor who
made the truest spear heads, with which a strong man could strike a
flying reptile in mid-air.</p>

<p>"I dreamed that I was not Nat-ul," replied the girl. "I dreamed
of a strange world and strange people. I was one of them. I was
clothed in many garments that were not skin at all. I lived in a
cave that was not a cave&mdash;it was built upon the ground of the
stuff of which trees are made, only cut into thin slabs and
fastened together. There were many caves in the one cave.</p>

<p>"There were men and women, and some of the men were black."</p>

<p><i>"Black!"</i> echoed the other girls.</p>

<p>"Yes, black," insisted Nat-ul. "And they alone were garbed
something as are our men. The white men wore strange garments and
things upon their heads, and had no beards. They carried short
spears that spit smoke and great noise out upon their enemies and
the wild beasts, and slew them at a great distance."</p>

<p>"And was Nu, the son of Nu, there?" asked Ra-el, tittering
behind her hand.</p>

<p>"He came and took me away," replied Nat-ul, gravely. "And at
night the earth shook as we slept in the cave of Oo. And when I
awoke I was here in the cave of Tha, my father."</p>

<p>"Nu has not returned," said Una.</p>

<p>Nat-ul looked at her inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Where did Nu, the son of Nu, go?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Who should know better than Nat-ul, daughter of Tha, that Nu,
the son of Nu, went forth to slay Oo, the killer of men and
mammoths, that he might lay Oo's head before the cave of Nat-ul?"
she asked, in reply.</p>

<p>"He has not returned?" asked Nat-ul. "He said that he would go
but I thought that he joked, for one man alone may not slay Oo, the
killer of men and of mammoths." But she did not use the word
"mammoth," nor the word "man." Instead she spoke in a language that
survives only among the apes of our day, if it survives at all, and
among them only in crude and disjointed monosyllables. When she
spoke of the mammoth she called him Gluh, and man was Pah. The
tongue was low and liquid and entirely beautiful and enchanting,
and she spoke, too, much with her eyes and with her graceful hands,
as did her companions, for the tribe of Nu was not far removed from
those earlier peoples, descended from the alalus who were
speechless, and who preceded those who spoke by signs.</p>

<p>The girls, having filled the bladders with water, now returned
to their respective caves. Nat-ul had scarce entered and hung up
the bladder ere Tha and Aht returned&mdash;one with the carcass of
an antelope, the other with an armful of fruits.</p>

<p>In the floor of the cave beside the fire a little hollow had
been chipped from the living rock. Into this Nat-ul poured some
water, while Lu-tan cut pieces of the antelope's flesh into small
bits, dropping them into the water. Then she scooped a large pebble
from the fire where it had been raised to a high temperature. This
she dropped into the water with the meat. There was a great
bubbling and sputtering, which was repeated as Lu-tan dropped one
super-heated pebble after another into the water until the whole
became a boiling cauldron. When the water continued to boil for a
few moments after a pebble was thrown in Lu-tan ceased her
operation, sitting quietly with her family about the primitive stew
for several minutes. Occasionally she would stick a finger into the
water to test its temperature, and when at last she seemed
satisfied she signalled Tha to eat.</p>

<p>The man plunged his stone knife into a piece of the half-cooked
meat, withdrew it from the cauldron and tossed it upon the floor
beside Lu-tan. A second piece was given to Nat-ul, a third to Aht,
and the fourth Tha kept to himself. The four ate with a certain
dignity. There was nothing bestial nor repulsive in their manners,
and as they ate they talked and laughed among
themselves&mdash;there seemed great good-fellowship in the cavehold
of Tha.</p>

<p>Aht joked with Nat-ul about Nu, the son of Nu, telling her that
doubtless a hyena had devoured the mighty hunter before ever he had
had a chance to slay Oo. But Lu-tan came to her daughter's rescue,
saying that it was more likely that Nu, the son of Nu, had
discovered Oo and all his family and had remained to kill them
all.</p>

<p>"I do not fear for Nu, because of Oo," said Tha, presently. "For
Nu, the son of Nu, is as great a hunter as his father; but I shall
be glad to see him safe again from all that might have befallen him
when the earth rocked and the thunder came from below instead of
from above. I shall be glad to have him return and take my daughter
as his mate, whether he brings back the head of Oo or not."</p>

<p>Nat-ul was silent, but she was worried, for all feared the power
of the elements against which no man might survive in battle, no
matter how brave he might be.</p>

<p>After breakfast Tha went, as he had said that he should, to the
cave of Nu, the chief. There he found many of the older warriors
and the young men. There were so many of them that there was not
room within the cave and upon the narrow ledge without, so, at a
word from Nu, they all descended to the little, roughly cleared
rectangle at the base of the cliff. This place was where their
councils were held and where the tribe congregated for feasts, or
other purposes that called many together.</p>

<p>Nu sat at one end of the clearing upon a flat rock. About his
shoulders fell the shaggy haired skin of a huge cave bear. In the
string that supported his loin cloth reposed a wooden handled stone
axe and a stone knife. Upright in his hand, its butt between his
feet, rose a tall, slim spear, stone tipped. His black hair was
rudely cut into a shock. A fillet of tiger hide encircled his head,
supporting a single long, straight feather. About his neck depended
a string of long, sharp fangs and talons, and from cheek to heel
his smooth, bronzed hide was marked with many scars inflicted by
these same mementos when they had armed the mighty paws and jaws of
the fierce denizens of that primeval world. He let the skin that
covered him slip from his shoulders, for the morning was warm. In
that hot and humid atmosphere there was seldom need for covering,
but even then men were slaves to fashion. They wore the trophies of
their prowess, and bedecked their women similarly.</p>

<p>Tha, being second only to Nu, was the first among the warriors
to speak. As speech was young and words comparatively few they must
needs be supplemented with many signs and gestures. Oratory was,
therefore, a strenuous business, and one which required a keen
imagination, more than ordinary intelligence, and considerable
histrionic ability. Because it was so difficult to convey one's
ideas to one's fellowmen the art of speech, in its infancy, was of
infinitely more value to the human race than it is today. Now, we
converse mechanically&mdash;the more one listens to ordinary
conversations the more apparent it becomes that the reasoning
faculties of the brain take little part in the direction of the
vocal organs. When Tha spoke to Nu and the warriors of his tribe he
was constantly required to invent signs and words to carry varying
shades of meaning to his listeners. It was great mental exercise
for Tha and for his audience as well&mdash;men were good listeners
in those days; they had to be and they advanced more rapidly in
proportion to our advancement, because what little speech they
heard meant something&mdash;it was too precious to waste, nor could
men afford to attend to foolish matters where it required all their
eyes as well as their ears and the concentration of the best of
their mental faculties to follow the thread of an argument.</p>

<p>Tha stepped to the center of the group of warriors. There was a
little open space left there for the speaker. About it squatted the
older men. Behind them knelt others, and behind these stood the
young men of the tribe of Nu.</p>

<p>Tha uttered a deep rumbling from his chest cavity. He shook his
giant frame.</p>

<p>"The ground roars and trembles where we live," he said. "The
cliffs will fall." He pointed toward their dwellings, making a
gesture with his open palms toward the ground. "We shall all be
killed. Let us go. Let us seek a new place where the ground does
not tremble. The beasts are everywhere. Fruit is everywhere. Grain
grows in the valley of every river. We may hunt elsewhere as well
as here. We shall find plenty to eat. Let us take our women and our
children and go out of this place."</p>

<p>As he spoke he mimicked the hunting of game, the gathering of
fruit and grain, the marching and the search for a new home. His
motions were both dignified and graceful. His listeners sat in rapt
attention. When he had done he squatted down among the older
warriors. Then another rose&mdash;a very old man. He came to the
center of the open space, and told, by word and pantomime, the
dangers of migration. He recalled the numerous instances when
strangers, in small parties and in great numbers had come too close
to the country of Nu, and how they, Nu's warriors, had rushed upon
them, slaying all who could not escape.</p>

<p>"Others will do the same to us," he said, "if we approach their
dwellings."</p>

<p>When he had sat down Hud pushed through to the center from the
ring of younger warriors. Hud desired Nat-ul, the daughter of Tha.
Therefore he had two good reasons for espousing the cause of her
father. One was that he might ingratiate himself with the older
man, and the other was the hope that the tribe might migrate at
once while Nu, the son of Nu, was absent, thus giving Hud
uninterrupted opportunity to push his suit for the girl.</p>

<p>"Tha has spoken wisely," he said. "This land is no longer safe
for man or beast. Scarce a moon passes that does not see the ground
tremble and crack, and in places have faces of the mountains
tumbled away. Any time it may be the turn of our cliff to fall. Let
us go to a land where the ground does not tremble. We need not fear
the strangers. That is the talk of old men, and women who are big
with child. The tribe of Nu is mighty. It can go where it pleases,
and slay those who would block its way. Let us do as Tha says, and
go away from here at once&mdash;another great trembling may come at
any moment. Let us leave now, for we have eaten."</p>

<p>Others spoke, and so great was the fear of the earthquakes among
them that there was scarce a dissenting voice&mdash;nearly all
wished to go. Nu listened with grave dignity. When all had spoken
who wished to speak he arose.</p>

<p>"It is best," he said. "We will go away&mdash;" Hud could scarce
repress a smile of elation "so soon as Nu, my son, returns." Hud
scowled. "I go to seek him," concluded Nu.</p>

<p>The council was over. The men dispersed to their various duties.
Tha accompanied Nu in search of the latter's son. A party of
hunters went north toward the Barren Cliffs, at the foot of which,
not far from the sea, one of the tribe had seen a bull mammoth the
previous day.</p>

<p>Hud went to his cave and watched his opportunity to see Nat-ul
alone. At last his patience was rewarded by sight of her going down
toward the spring, which was now deserted. Hud ran after her. He
overtook her as she stooped to fill the bladder.</p>

<p>"I want you," said Hud, coming directly to the point in most
primitive fashion, "to be my mate."</p>

<p>Nat-ul looked at him for a moment and then laughed full in his
face.</p>

<p>"Go fetch the head of Oo and lay it before my father's cave,"
she answered, "and then, maybe, Nat-ul will think about becoming
the mate of Hud. But I forgot," she suddenly cried, "Hud does not
hunt&mdash;he prefers to remain at home with the old men and the
women and the children while the men go forth in search of Gluh."
She emphasized the word men.</p>

<p>The man colored. He was far from being a physical
coward&mdash;cowards were not bred until a later age. He seized her
roughly by the arm.</p>

<p>"Hud will show you that he is no coward," he cried, "for he will
take you away to be his mate, defying Nu and Tha and Nu, the son of
Nu. If they come to take you from him, Hud will slay them all."</p>

<p>As he spoke he dragged her toward the jungle beyond the
spring&mdash;the jungle that lay between the cliff and the sea.
Nat-ul struggled, fighting to be free; but Hud, a great hand across
her mouth and an arm about her body, forged silently ahead with his
captive. Beyond the jungle the man turned north along the beach.
Now he relaxed his hold upon the girl's mouth.</p>

<p>"Will you come with me?" he asked, "or must I drag you thus all
day?"</p>

<p>"I shall not come willingly," she replied, "for otherwise Nu,
the son of Nu, nor my father, nor my brother might have the right
to kill you for what you have done; but now they may, for you are
taking me by force as did the hairy people who lived long time ago
take their mates. You are a beast, Hud, and when my men come upon
you they will slay you for the beast you are."</p>

<p>"You will suffer most," retorted Hud, "for if you do not come
willingly with me the tribe will kill the child."</p>

<p>"There will be no child," replied Nat-ul, and beneath her
red-doe skin she hugged the stag handle of a stone knife.</p>

<p>Hud kept to the beach to escape detection by the mammoth hunters
upon their return from the chase, for they, too, had gone
northward; but along the base of the cliffs upon the opposite side
of the strip of jungle that extended parallel with the beach to the
very foot of the Barren Cliffs, where they jutted boldly out into
the Restless Sea half a day's journey northward.</p>

<p>The sun was directly above the two when Hud dragged his
unwilling companion up the steep face of the Barren Cliffs which he
had determined to cross in search of a secure hiding place, for he
knew that he might not return to the tribe for a full moon after
the thing that he had done. Even then it might not be safe, for the
men of the tribe of Nu had not taken their mates by force for many
generations. There was a strong belief among them that the children
of women who mated through their own choice were more beautiful,
better natured and braver than those whose mothers were little
better than prisoners and slaves. Hud hoped, however, to persuade
Nat-ul to say that she had run away with him voluntarily, to which
there could be no objection. But that might require many days.</p>

<p>From the top of the Barren Cliffs there stretched away toward
the north an entirely different landscape than that upon the
southern side. Here was a great level plain, dotted with occasional
clumps of trees. At a little distance a broad river ran down to the
sea, its banks clothed in jungle. Upon the plain, herds of
antelope, bison and bos browsed in tall grasses and wild grains.
Sheep, too, were there, and rooting just within the jungle were
great droves of wild hog. Now and then there would be a sudden
stampede among the feeding herbivores as some beast of prey dashed
among them. Bleating, bellowing, squealing or grunting they would
race off madly for a short distance only to resume their feeding
and love-making when assured that they were not pursued, though the
great carnivore might be standing in full sight of them above the
carcass of its kill. But why run further? All about them, in every
direction, were other savage, blood-thirsty beasts. It was but a
part of their terror-stricken lives, fleeing hither and thither as
they snatched sustenance, and only surviving because they bred more
surely than the beasts that preyed upon them and could live further
from water.</p>

<p>Hud led Nat-ul down the northern face of the Barren Cliffs,
searching for a cavern in which they might make their temporary
home. Halfway between the summit and the base he came upon a cave.
Before it were strewn gnawed bones of antelope, buffalo and even
mammoth. Hud grasped his spear more firmly as he peered into the
dark interior. Here was the cave of Ur, the cave-bear. Hud picked
up a bone and threw it within. There was no remonstrative
growl&mdash;Ur was not at home.</p>

<p>Hud pushed Nat-ul within, then he rolled a few large boulders
before the cave's mouth&mdash;enough to bar the entrance of the
gigantic bear upon his return. After, he crawled through the small
opening that he had left. In the dim light of the interior he saw
Nat-ul flattened against the further side of the cave. He crossed
toward her to take her in his arms.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chb3" id="chb3">III. &mdash; THE GREAT CAVE-BEAR</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">When Nu, the son of Nu, regained consciousness
daylight was filtering through several tiny crevices in the debris
that blocked the entrance to the cave in which the earthquake had
found and imprisoned him. As he sat up, half bewildered, he cast
his eyes about the dim interior in search of Nat-ul. Not seeing her
he sprang to his feet and searched each corner of the cavern
minutely. She was not there! Nu stood for a moment with one hand
pressed to his forehead, deep in thought. He was trying to marshal
from the recesses of his memory the occurrences of his immediate
past.</p>

<p>Finally he recalled that he had set forth from the village of
his people in search of Oo, as he had been wont to do often in the
past, that he might bring the head of the fierce monster and lay it
before the cave of Nat-ul, daughter of Tha. But what had led him to
believe that Nat-ul should be there now in the cave beside him? He
passed his hand across his eyes, yet the same memory-vision
persisted&mdash;a confused and chaotic muddle of strange beasts and
stranger men, among which he and Nat-ul fled through an unknown
world.</p>

<p>Nu shook his head and stamped his foot&mdash;it was all a
ridiculous dream. The shaking of the earth the previous night,
however, had been no dream&mdash;this and the fact that he was
buried alive were all too self-evident. He remembered that he had
not found Oo at home, and when the quake had come he had run into
the cave of the great beast to hide from the wrath of the
elements.</p>

<p>Now he turned his attention to the broken rock piled before the
mouth of the cave. To his immense relief he discovered that it was
composed largely of small fragments. These he loosened and removed
one by one, and though others continued to roll down from above and
take their places for a while, until the cave behind him was half
filled with the debris, he eventually succeeded in making an
opening of sufficient size to pass his body through into the outer
air.</p>

<p>Looking about him he discovered that the quake seemed to have
done but little damage other than to the top of the cliff which had
overhung before and now had fallen from above, scattering its
fragments upon the ledges and at the foot of the escarpment.</p>

<p>For years Oo had laired here. It was here that Nu had sought him
since he had determined to win his mate with the greatest of all
trophies, but now that his cave was choked with the debris of the
cliff top Oo would have to seek elsewhere for a den, and that might
carry him far from the haunts of Nu. That would never do at
all&mdash;Oo must be kept within striking distance until his head
had served the purpose for which the troglodyte intended it.</p>

<p>So for several hours Nu labored industriously to remove the
rocks from the cave and from the ledge immediately before it, as
well as from the rough trail that led up from the foot of the
cliff. All the time he kept his spear close to his hand, and his
stone ax and knife ready in his gee-string, for at any moment Oo
might return. As the great cat had a way of appearing with most
uncanny silence and unexpectedness it behooved one to be ever on
the alert. But at last the work was completed and Nu set forth to
search for a breakfast.</p>

<p>He had determined to await the return of the saber-toothed tiger
and have the encounter over for good and all. Had not the young men
and women of the tribe begun to smile of late each time that he
returned empty handed from the hunt for Oo? None had doubted the
sincerity of his desire to meet the formidable beast from which it
was no disgrace to fly, for none doubted the courage of Nu; but
nevertheless it was humiliating to return always with excuses
instead of the head of his quarry.</p>

<p>Nu had scarce settled himself comfortably upon the branch of a
tree where he could command the various approaches to the tiger's
lair when his keen ear caught the sound of movement in the jungle
at his back. The noise was up wind from him and presently the scent
of man came down the breeze to the sensitive nostrils of the
watcher. Now he was alert in this new direction, every faculty bent
to discovering the identity of the newcomers before they sensed his
presence.</p>

<p>Soon they came in view&mdash;two men, Nu and Tha searching for
the former's son. At sight of them Nu, the son of Nu, called out a
greeting.</p>

<p>"Where go Nu and Tha?" he asked, as the two came to a halt
beneath his perch.</p>

<p>"They sought Nu, the son of Nu," replied the young man's father,
"and having found him they return to the dwellings of Nu's people,
and Nu, the son of Nu, returns with them."</p>

<p>The young man shrugged his broad shoulders.</p>

<p>"Nu, the son of Nu, would remain and slay Oo," he replied.</p>

<p>"Come down and accompany your father," returned the older man,
"for the people of Nu start today in search of other dwelling where
the earth does not shake, or the cliffs crumble and fall."</p>

<p>Nu slid nimbly to the ground.</p>

<p>"Tell me which way the tribe travels," said Nu, the son of Nu,
"that I may find them after I have slain Oo, if he returns today.
If he does not return today, then will I set out tomorrow after the
tribe."</p>

<p>The young man's father thought in silence for a moment. He was
very proud of the prowess of his son. He should be as elated as the
young man himself when he returned with the head of the hunter of
men and of mammoths. Then, too, he realized the humiliation which
his son might feel on being forced to return again without the
trophy. He laid his hand upon the young man's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Remain, my son," he said, "until the next light. The tribe will
travel north beside the Restless Sea beyond the Barren Cliffs.
Because of the old and the babes we shall move slowly. It will be
easy for you to overtake us. If you do not come we shall know that
Oo was mightier than the son of Nu."</p>

<p>Without other words the two older men turned and retraced their
steps toward the village, while Nu, the son of Nu, climbed again to
his perch within the tree.</p>

<p>All day he watched for the return of Oo. The great apes and the
lesser apes passed below and above and around him. Sometimes they
threw him a word in passing. Below, the woolly rhinoceros browsed
and lay down to sleep. A pack of hyenas slunk down from the plateau
above the cliffs. They circled the sleeping perissodactyl. The
great beast opened its little eyes. Lumberingly it came to its
feet, wheeling about until it faced up wind, then, like a mountain
run amuck, it charged straight for the line of now growling hyenas.
The cowardly brutes leaped aside, and the whole pack closed upon
the rear of the rhinoceros. The big beast turned, quick as a cat.
Down went his armed snout and one of his tormentors was hurled far
aloft, torn by the mighty horn that had pierced him through. Again
the rhinoceros wheeled and ran, and again the pack closed in upon
him. The jungle swallowed them, but for a long time Nu could hear
the savage growls of the pursuing beasts, and the yells of pain as
from time to time the rhinoceros turned upon his tormentors.</p>

<p>Then came a cave bear, lumbering down the face of the cliff. At
the mouth of the cave of Oo he halted sniffing about warily, and
uttering deep-throated growls of rage and hate. Nu listened for the
answering challenge of the ancient enemy of Ur, but no sound came.
Nu shrugged his shoulders. It was evident that Oo was far away,
otherwise he would never have let Ur's challenge go unanswered.</p>

<p>Now the bear had continued his way to the foot of the cliff. He
was advancing toward the tree in which Nu sat. At the edge of the
jungle the beast halted and commenced to nose in the soft earth for
roots. Nu watched him. If not the head of Oo, why not the head of
Ur? Oo would not return that day, of that Nu was positive, for it
was already late in the afternoon and if the great tiger had been
near he would have heard and answered the challenge of the cave
bear.</p>

<p>Nu dropped lightly to the ground upon the opposite side of the
tree from Ur. In his right hand he grasped his long, heavy spear.
In his left was his stone ax. He approached the huge beast from the
rear, coming within a few paces of it before the animal was aware
of his presence, for none of the jungle folk moved more noiselessly
than primeval man.</p>

<p>But at last Ur looked up, and at the same instant Nu's mighty
muscles launched the stone tipped spear. Straight as a bullet it
sped toward the breast of the hairy monster, burying itself deep in
his body as he lunged forward to seize the rash creature that dared
attack him.</p>

<p>Nu held his ground, standing with feet apart and swinging his
heavy stone ax to and fro in both hands. The cave bear rose upon
his hind feet as he neared the man, towering high above his enemy's
head. With gaping jaws and outstretched paws the terrible beast
advanced, now and then tearing at the stout haft of the spear
protruding from its breast, and giving tongue to roars of rage and
pain that shook the earth.</p>

<p>As the mighty forearms reached for him, Nu dodged beneath them,
swinging his ax to the side of the bear's head as he passed. With a
howl the beast wheeled and charged in the new direction, but again
Nu followed his previous tactics, and again a crushing blow fell
upon the side of the cave bear's jaw.</p>

<p>Blood spurted from the creature's mouth and nostrils, for not
only had the Stone ax brought blood, but the stone spear had
penetrated the savage lungs. And now Ur did what Nu had been
waiting for him to do. He dropped upon all fours and raced madly
toward his tormentor. The changed position brought the top of the
skull within reach of the man's weapon, and this time, as he
sidestepped the charge, he brought the ax down full upon the bear's
forehead, between his eyes.</p>

<p>Stunned, the beast staggered and stumbled, his nose buried in
the trampled mud and grass of the battlefield. Only for an instant
would he be thus, and in that instant must Nu leap in and finish
him. Nor did he hesitate. Dropping his ax he sprang upon Ur with
his stone knife, and again and again sent the blade into the wild
heart. Before the cave bear regained full consciousness he rolled
over upon his side, dead.</p>

<p>For half an hour Nu was busy removing the head, and then he set
himself to the task of skinning the beast. His methods were crude,
but he worked much faster with his primitive implements than modern
man with keen knives. Before another hour had passed he had the
skin off and rolled into a bundle, and had cut a great steak from
Ur's loin. Now he gathered some dry leaves and tinder and with a
sharpened bit of hardwood produced fire by twirling the point
vigorously in a tiny hollow scooped from another piece of hard
wood. When the blaze had been nursed to a fire of respectable
dimensions, Nu impaled the steak upon a small branch and squatting
before the blaze grilled his supper. It was half-burned and half
raw and partially smoked, but that he enjoyed it was evidenced by
the fact that he devoured it all.</p>

<p>Afterward he placed the pelt upon his shoulder and set forth
upon his return to his people. He returned directly to the cliffs
by the Restless Sea, for he did not know whether the tribe had yet
left in search of the new camping ground or not. It was night by
the time he emerged from the jungle at the foot of the cliff. A
cursory exploration showed him that the tribe had gone, and so he
crawled into his own cave for the night. In the morning he easily
could overtake them.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">When Hud crossed the cave toward Nat-ul he had
expected to encounter physical resistance, and so he came
half-crouched and with hands outstretched to seize and subdue
her.</p>

<p>"Hud," said the girl, "if I come to you willingly will you treat
me kindly always?"</p>

<p>The man came to a stop a few feet from his victim. Evidently it
was going to be more easy than he had anticipated. He did not
relish the idea of taking a she-tiger for mate, and so he was glad
to make whatever promises the girl required. Afterward he could
keep such as were easiest to keep.</p>

<p>"Hud will be a kind mate," he answered.</p>

<p>The girl stepped toward him, and Hud met her with encircling
arms; but as hers went around him he failed to see the sharp stone
knife in Nat-ul's right hand. The first he knew of it was when it
was plunged remorselessly into his back beneath his left shoulder
blade. Then Hud tried to disengage himself from the girl's embrace,
but struggle as he would, she clung to him tenaciously, plunging
the weapon time and time again into his back.</p>

<p>He tried to reach her throat with his fingers, but her sharp
teeth fastened upon his hand, and then, with his free hand, he beat
upon her face, but only for an instant, as the knife found his
heart, and with a groan he sank to the rocky floor of the cave.</p>

<p>Without waiting to know that he was dead Nat-ul rushed from the
dark interior. Swiftly she scaled the Barren Cliffs and dropped
once more into her own valley upon the other side. Along the beach
she raced back toward the dwellings of her people, not knowing that
at that very moment they were setting out in search of a new home.
At mid-afternoon she passed them scarce half a mile away, for they
had taken the way that led upon the far side of the jungle that
they might meet the returning mammoth hunters, and so Nat-ul came
to the deserted caves of her tribe at night-fall only to find that
her people had departed.</p>

<p>Supperless, she crawled into one of the smaller and higher
caves, for it would be futile to attempt to discover the trail of
the departed tribe while night with its darkness and its
innumerable horrors enveloped the earth. She had dozed once when
she was awakened by the sound of movement upon the face of the
cliff. Scarce breathing, she lay listening. Was it man or beast
that roamed through the deserted haunts of her tribe? Higher and
higher up the face of the cliff came the sound of the midnight
prowler. That the creature, whatever it was, was making a
systematic search of the caves seemed all too apparent. It would be
but a question of minutes before it would reach her hiding
place.</p>

<p>Nat-ul grasped her knife more firmly. The sounds ceased upon the
ledge directly beneath her. Then, after a few moments they were
resumed, but to the girl's relief they now retreated down the steep
bluff. Presently they ceased entirely, and though it was hours
before she could quiet her fears she at last fell into a deep
slumber.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">At dawn Nu, the son of Nu, awoke. He rose and
stretched himself, standing in the glare of the new sun upon the
ledge before his cave. Fifty feet above him slept the girl he
loved. Nu gathered up his weapons and his bear skin, and moved
silently down to the spring where he quenched his thirst. Then he
passed through the jungle to the sea. Here he removed his loincloth
and the skin that covered his shoulders and waded into the surf. In
his right hand he held his knife, for great reptiles inhabited the
Restless Sea. Carefully he bathed, keeping a wary watch for enemies
in the water or upon the land behind. In him was no fear, for he
knew no other existence than that which might present at any moment
the necessity of battling for his life with some slimy creature of
the deep, or equally ferocious denizen of the jungle or the hills.
To Nu it was but a part of the day's work. You or I might survive a
single day were we suddenly cast back into the primeval savagery of
Nu's long dead age, and Nu, if as suddenly transplanted to the
corner of Fifth Avenue and Twenty-third Street might escape
destruction for a few hours, but sooner or later a trolley car or a
taxi would pounce upon him.</p>

<p>His ablutions completed, the troglodyte replaced his loin cloth
and his shaggy fur, took up his weapons and his burden and set
forth upon the trail of his father's people. And above him, as he
passed again along the foot of the cliff, the woman that he loved
slept in ignorance of his presence.</p>

<p>When, at last, Nat-ul awoke the sun was high in the heavens. The
girl came cautiously down the cliff face, looking first in one
direction and then another, often pausing for several minutes at a
time to listen. All about her were the noises of the jungle and the
sea and the air, for great birds and horrid winged reptiles
threatened primeval men as sorely from above as did the carnivora
of the land from his own plane.</p>

<p>She came to the spring in safety, and passed on into the jungle
in search of food, for she was half-famished. Fruits and
vegetables, with grasshoppers, caterpillars and small rodents, and
the eggs of birds and reptiles were what she sought, nor was she
long in satisfying the cravings of her appetite. Nature was
infinitely more bountiful in those days than at the present, for
she had infinitely more numerous and often far greater stomachs to
satisfy then than now.</p>

<p>Nat-ul passed through the jungle to the beach. She had wanted to
bathe, but, alone, she dared not. Now she stood wondering in which
direction the tribe had gone. She knew that ordinarily if they had
been traveling either north or south they would follow the
hard-packed sand of the beach, for there the traveling was easiest,
but the tide would have washed away their spoor long before this.
She had seen signs of their passage north beside the jungle, but
the trail was an old, well worn one traversed daily by many feet,
so she had not been able to guess from it that it contained the
guide to the direction her people had taken.</p>

<p>As she stood upon the beach trying to reason out her future
plans, it became apparent that if the tribe had gone north she
would have met them on her return from the Barren Cliffs yesterday,
and so, as she had not met them, they must have gone south.</p>

<p>And so she turned her own footsteps south away from her people
and from Nu.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chb4" id="chb4">IV. &mdash; THE BOAT-BUILDERS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Nat-ul kept to the beach as she tramped southward.
Upon her right was the jungle, upon her left the great sea,
stretching away she knew not whither. To her it represented the
boundary of the world&mdash;all beyond was an appalling waste of
water. To the southeast she could see the outlines of islands. They
were familiar objects, yet shrouded in mystery. Often they formed
the topic of conversation among her people. What was there upon
them? Were they inhabited? And if so, were the creatures men and
women like themselves? To Nat-ul they were as full of romantic
mystery as are the stars and planets to us, but she knew less of
them than we do of the countless brilliant islands that dot the
silent sea of space&mdash;they were further from Nat-ul and her
people than is Mars from us. A boat was as utterly unknown to
Nat-ul as was a telescope.</p>

<p>Just beyond a rise of ground ahead of Nat-ul fifty or sixty men,
women and children were busy beside a little stream that flowed
into the sea. When Nat-ul topped the rise and her eyes fell upon
these strangers she dropped suddenly flat upon her belly behind a
bush. There she watched the peculiar actions of these people. It
was evident that they had but just arrived after a long march. They
differed in many ways from any people she had ever seen. Their
skins were of the less dangerous animals&mdash;those which fed upon
grasses. Their head-dresses bore the horns of bulls and antelope,
giving them, altogether, a most fearsome aspect.</p>

<p>But it was their habitations and the work upon which they were
engaged which caused Nat-ul the greatest wonderment. Their caves
were not caves at all. They were constructed of a number of long
saplings leaned inward against one another in a circle, and covered
with skins and brush, or the great fronds of giant palms as well as
those of the plant which is known today as it was in Nat-ul's time
as elephant's ear, because of its resemblance to that portion of
the great pachyderm.</p>

<p>The weapons of these peoples were unlike those with which Nat-ul
was familiar. The stone ax was of a different shape, and the spear
was much shorter and stouter, its point being barbed, and having
one end of a long, plaited sinew rope tied to it, while the balance
of the rope was fastened in a coil at the warrior's side. Nat-ul
knew nothing of fisher folk. Her own people often caught fish.
Sometimes they speared them with their light spears, but they did
not make a business of fishing. So she did not know that the spears
of these strangers answered the double purpose of weapons of
warfare and harpoons.</p>

<p>What interested her most, however, was the strange work upon
which many of the people were engaged. They had cut down a number
of large trees, which they had chopped and burned into different
lengths, from fifteen to twenty feet. With their stone axes they
had hewn away the bark and heavier growth along the upper surfaces
of the logs. The softer, pithy centers had been scooped out and
fires built within.</p>

<p>Nat-ul could not but wonder at the purpose of all this labor.
She saw the men and women tending the fires carefully,
extinguishing with water any blaze that seemed threatening to
pierce too far from the center of a tree. Deeper and deeper the
flames ate until there remained but a thin outer husk of
fire-hardened wood.</p>

<p>So intent was the girl upon the strange sights before her that
she did not note the approach of a tall, young warrior from the
jungle at her right and a little behind her. The man was tall and
straight. A shaggy bison hide fell from his shoulders, the tail
dragging upon the ground behind him. Upon his head the skull of the
bull fitted firmly&mdash;a primitive helmet&mdash;clothed in its
dried skin and with the short, stout horns protruding at right
angles from his temples.</p>

<p>In his right hand was the stout harpoon and at his waist the
coil of sinew rope. The robe, falling away in front, disclosed a
well knit, muscular figure, naked but for a loin cloth of doe skin
in which was stuck his stone knife and ax.</p>

<p>For several minutes he stood watching the girl, his eyes glowing
at the beauties of her profile and lithe, graceful figure. Then,
very cautiously, he crept toward her. It was Tur of the Boat
Builders. Never in his life had Tur looked upon a more beautiful
woman. To see her was to want her. Tur must own her. He was almost
upon her when a dried twig snapped beneath his tread.</p>

<p>Like a startled antelope Nat-ul was upon her feet. At the same
instant Tur leaped forward to seize her. She was between him and
the camp she had been watching. To run toward them would have meant
certain capture. Like a shot she wheeled right into Tur's
outstretched arms, but as they closed to grasp her they encircled
but empty air. Nat-ul had ducked beneath the young warrior's eager
embrace and was fleeing north along the beach, like a frightened
deer.</p>

<p>After her sprang Tur, calling upon her to stop; but with terror
goaded speed the fleet footed Nat-ul raced on. A hundred paces
behind her came Tur. For a short distance she might outstrip him,
he knew, but in the end his mightier muscles would prevail. Already
she was lagging. No longer was the distance between them growing.
Soon it would lessen. He would close upon her&mdash;and then!</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">To the north of the Barren Cliffs Nu overtook the
tribe of Nu, his father. He came upon them during a period of rest,
and as he approached he noted the constraint of their manners as
they greeted him. The young women looked at him with sorrowing
eyes. His young warrior friends did not smile as he called their
names in passing.</p>

<p>Straight to Nu, his father, he went, as became a returning
warrior. He found the chief sitting with Tha before a small fire
where a ptarmigan, clay wrapped, was roasting.</p>

<p>His father rose and greeted him. There was pleasure in the older
man's eyes at sight of his son, but no smile upon his lips. He
glanced at the head and pelt of Ur.</p>

<p>"Oo did not return?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oo did not return," replied the son.</p>

<p>Nu, the son of Nu, looked about among the women and children and
the uneasy warriors. She he sought was not there. His mother came
and kissed him as did Una his sister.</p>

<p>"Where is Nat-ul?" asked Nu.</p>

<p>His mother and his sister looked at one another and then at his
father. Nu, the chief, looked at Tha. Tha rose and came before the
young man. He laid his hand upon the other's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Since your mother bore you," he said, "always have I loved
you&mdash;loved you second only to Aht, my own son. Some day I
hoped that you would become my son, for I saw that you loved
Nat-ul, my daughter. But now Nat-ul has gone away with Hud. We know
not how it happened, but Ra-el, the daughter of Kor, says that she
went willingly."</p>

<p>He got no further.</p>

<p>"It is a lie!" cried Nu, the son of Nu. "Nat-ul never went
willingly with Hud or any other. When did they go? Whither went
they? Tell me, and I will follow and bring back Nat-ul, and with
her own lips she will give Ra-el the lie. I will bring her back if
she still lives, but unless she escaped Hud she is dead, for she
would have died rather than mate with another than Nu, the son of
Nu. I have spoken. Which way went they?"</p>

<p>No one could tell him. All that they knew was that when the
tribe set out from their old dwellings Hud and Nat-ul could not be
found, and then Ra-el had come forward and said that the two had
fled together. When he questioned Ra-el he could glean nothing more
from her, but she stuck obstinately to her assertion that Nat-ul
had gone willingly.</p>

<p>"And will Nu, the son of Nu, be such a fool as to follow after a
woman who has chosen another mate when there are those as beautiful
whom Nu, the son of Nu, could have for the asking?" she said.</p>

<p>At her words the young man saw the motive behind her statement
that Nat-ul had run away voluntarily with Hud, and now he was more
positive than ever that the girl did not speak the truth. Her words
recalled many little occurrences in the past that had slipped by
unnoticed at a time when all his thoughts were of the splendid
Nat-ul. It was evident that Ra-el would have liked Nu for
herself.</p>

<p>The young man returned to his father's side.</p>

<p>"I go," he said, "nor shall I return until I know the
truth."</p>

<p>The older man laid his hand upon the shoulder of the
younger.</p>

<p>"Go, my son," he said; "your father's heart goes with you."</p>

<p>In silence Nu, the son of Nu, retraced his steps southward
toward the Barren Cliffs. It was his intention to return directly
to the former dwellings of his people and there search out the
spoor of Hud and Nat-ul. A great rage burned in his heart as he
thought of the foul deed that Hud had done. The tribe of Nu had
progressed far beyond the status of the beasts. They acknowledged
certain property rights, among them the inalienable right of the
man to his mate, and, going a step further, the right of the woman
to mate as she chose. That Nat-ul had chosen to mate with Hud, Nu
could not for a moment admit. He knew the courageous nature of the
girl, and, knowing it, knew that had she preferred Hud to him she
would have mated with the man of her choice openly after the manner
of the tribe. No, Nat-ul would never have run off with any
man&mdash;not even himself.</p>

<p>Halfway up the face of the Barren Cliffs Nu was arrested by a
faint moan, coming apparently from a cave at his right. He had no
time to devote to the pleasures of the chase, but there was a human
note in the sound that he had heard that brought him up all
suddenly alert and listening. After a moment it was repeated. No,
there could be no doubt of it&mdash;that sound came only from a
human throat. Cautiously Nu crept toward the mouth of the cave from
which the moaning seemed to issue. At the entrance he came to a
sudden halt, at the sight that met his eyes.</p>

<p>There, in the half-light of the entrance, lay Hud in a pool of
blood. The man was breathing feebly. Nu called him by name. Hud
opened his eyes. When he saw who stood over him he shrugged his
shoulders and lay still, as though to say, the worst has already
been done to me&mdash;you can do no more.</p>

<p>"Where is Nat-ul?" asked Nu.</p>

<p>Hud shook his head. Nu knelt beside him raising his head in his
arms.</p>

<p>"Where is Nat-ul, man?" he cried, shaking the dying warrior.
"Tell me before you die. I do not ask if she went with you
willingly, for I know that she did not&mdash;all I ask is what have
you done with her? Does she live? And if she lives, where is
she?"</p>

<p>Hud tried to speak. The effort cost him dear. But at last he
managed to whisper a few words.</p>

<p>"She-did-this," he panted. "Then she&mdash;went&mdash;away. I
don't&mdash;know&mdash;" he gasped, and died.</p>

<p>Nu dropped him back upon the stone floor of the cave and ran out
upon the ledge. He searched about the face of the cliff, even going
down upon all fours and creeping from ledge to ledge, oftentimes
with his nose close to the trail&mdash;sniffing.</p>

<p>After half an hour of going back and forth over the same ground
and following a rocky ascent upward toward the summit of the cliff
a dozen times, as though proving and reproving the correctness of
his deductions, Nu at last set forth across the Barren Cliffs and
down onto the beach beside the Restless Sea.</p>

<p>Here he found the spoor more plainly marked in many places above
high tide where Nat-ul's little sandals had left their legible
record in the soft loam or upon the higher sand that the water had
not reached. The way led southward, and southward hurried Nu, the
son of Nu. Straight to the old dwellings led the trail. There Nu
found evidence that Nat-ul had spent the night in a cave above the
one in which he had slept. There was the bed of grasses and a trace
of the delicate aroma that our blunted sense of smell could never
have detected, but which was plain to Nu, and deliciously
familiar.</p>

<p>A pang of regret seized him as he realized that his Nat-ul had
been so close to him, and that he had unwittingly permitted her to
remain alone and unprotected amidst the countless dangers of their
savage world, and to go forth, none knew where, into other myriad
dangers.</p>

<p>Returning to the foot of the cliff he once more came upon the
girl's spoor. Again it led south along the beach. Swiftly he
followed it until it stopped behind a little clump of bushes at the
top of a rise in the ground. Before Nu realized that this was the
southern limit of the trail he had seen the village beyond and the
people engaged in what to him seemed a strange occupation. He knew
that the same sight had brought Nat-ul to a halt a few hours
before, and now he saw where she had lain upon her belly watching,
just as he was watching. For a few minutes he lay watching the
workers and seeking through the little cluster of skin and thatch
shelters for some sign that Nat-ul was a prisoner there.</p>

<p>Nu had never seen a boat or guessed that such a thing might be.
His people had been hunters from time immemorial. They had come
down from the great plateaus far inland but a few generations
since. Then, for the first time, had his forefathers seen the
ocean. As yet they had not met with any need that required them to
navigate its waters, nor had they come in contact with the Boat
Builders who dwelt far south at the mouth of a great river that
emptied into the Restless Sea.</p>

<p>Now, for the first time, Nu saw both the boats and the Boat
Builders. For the first time he saw artificial shelters, and to Nu
they seemed frail and uncomfortable things by comparison with his
eternal caves. The Boat Builders had been several days in this new
camp. What had driven them so far north of their ancestral home,
who may guess? A tribal feud, perhaps; or the birth of a new force
that was to drive them and their progeny across the face of the
world in restless wanderings to the end of time&mdash;the primitive
wanderlust from which so many of us suffer, and yet would not
forego.</p>

<p>Nu saw that of all the workers one tall young giant labored most
rapidly. His haste seemed almost verging upon frenzy. Nu wondered
what he could be about upon the felled tree trunk that required so
much exertion. Nu did not like work of that nature. It is true that
he had never done any manual labor outside the needs of the chase,
but intuitively he knew that he disliked it. He was a hunter, a
warrior, and even then, in his primitive and untutored mind, there
arose a species of contempt for the drudge. At last, tiring of
watching, he turned his attention again to the spoor he had been
following. Where had Nat-ul gone after lying here behind these
bushes?</p>

<p>Nu crawled about until he saw evidences of the girl's quick leap
to her feet and her rapid flight. Then it was he came upon the
footprints of Tur. Now Nu's blood ran hot. It surged through his
heart and pounded against his temples&mdash;Nat-ul, his Nat-ul, was
in danger.</p>

<p>He saw where the girl had dodged past the man. He saw,
distinctly in the sand, the marks of Tur's quickly turning
footsteps as he wheeled in pursuit. He saw that the two had been
running rapidly along the beach toward the north&mdash;the man
following the girl, and then, to his surprise, he saw that the man
had come to a sudden stop, had taken a few steps forward, stood for
some time looking seaward and then turned and raced back toward the
strange camp at breakneck speed.</p>

<p>And the girl's trail had continued toward the north for perhaps
a hundred paces beyond the point at which the man had halted. Nu
followed it easily&mdash;they were fresh signs since the last high
tide, alone and uncrossed upon a wide stretch of smooth, white
sand.</p>

<p>Nu followed the dainty imprints of Nat-ul's swiftly flying
little feet for a hundred paces beyond the end of the man's
pursuit&mdash;and came to a dead, bewildered halt. The foot prints
ended abruptly upon the beach midway between the ocean and the
jungle. About them was only an expanse of unbroken sand. They
simply ceased, that was all. They did not double back upon
themselves. They did not enter the ocean. They did not approach the
jungle. They stopped as though Nat-ul had suddenly been swallowed
by a great hole in the beach. But there was no hole. Nu halted and
looked about in every direction. There was no trace of any living
thing about. Where had Nat-ul gone? What had become of her? Had the
foot prints of the man who pursued her reached the point upon the
sand where hers ended, Nu would have concluded that he had picked
her up and carried her back to his village; but the man had been a
hundred paces behind Nat-ul when her trail ceased, nor had he
approached closer to the spot at any time. And when he had returned
to his village he had done so at a rapid run, and the lightness of
his spoor indicated that he had not been burdened with a heavy
load.</p>

<p>For some time Nu stood in bewildered thought, but at last he
turned back toward the village of the Boat Builders. Nu knew little
of the super-natural, and so he turned first to the nearest
material and natural cause of Nat-ul's disappearance that he could
conceive&mdash;the man who had pursued her. And that man had
returned to the village of the strangers who were diligently
burning and scooping the hearts out of felled trees.</p>

<p>Nu returned to the vantage of the bush before the village. Here
he lay down again to watch&mdash;he was positive that in some way
these people were responsible for the disappearance of Nat-ul. They
knew where she was, and, judging by his own estimate of the girl,
he knew that the man who had seen her and pursued her would not
lightly relinquish his attempts to obtain her. Nu had seen the
women of the strangers&mdash;beside his Nat-ul they looked like the
shes of the ape-folk. No, the man would seek to follow and capture
the radiant stranger. Nu wished that he could guess which of the
men it was who had chased Nat-ul. Something told him that it was
the young giant who worked with such feverish haste, so Nu watched
him most closely.</p>

<p>At last Tur's boat was completed. The centers of the trees the
Boat Builders selected for their craft is soft, and easily burned
and scooped. The fires kindled in the hollowed trunk served a
double purpose&mdash;they ate away the harder portions nearer the
outside and at the same time tended to harden what remained. The
result was a fairly light and staunch dug-out.</p>

<p>When Tur's boat was finished he called to several of the other
workers. These came, and, lending a hand with Tur, dragged the
hollowed log down to the water. One of the women came with a long
stick, larger at one end than the other, and with the large end
flattened upon both sides. It was a paddle. Tur tossed this into
the boat and then running through the surf he launched his
primitive craft upon the crest of a receding roller, leaped in, and
seizing the paddle struck out vigorously against the next incoming
wave.</p>

<p>Nu watched him with wide eyes. His estimate of the man rose in
leaps and bounds. Here was sport! And Nu did not have to attempt
the feat he had witnessed to know that it required skill and
courage. Only a brave man would venture the perils of the awful
waters. Where was he going? Nu saw that he paddled straight out
into the sea. In the distance were the islands. Could he be going
to these? Nu, from childhood, had always longed to explore those
distant lands of mystery. These people had found a way. Nu had
learned something&mdash;an aeroplane could not have presented
greater wonders to him than did this crude dug-out.</p>

<p>For a while he watched the man in the little boat. They grew
smaller and smaller as wind, tide and the sturdy strokes of the
paddler carried the hollowed log farther out to sea. Then Nu turned
his attention once more to the other workers. He saw that they,
too, were rapidly completing their boats. They were talking back
and forth among themselves, raising their voices, as they were
scattered over a considerable distance about the village. Nu caught
a word now and then. The language was similar to his own. He
discovered that they were talking about the man who had just
departed, and about his venture. Nu wanted to hear more. He crept
cautiously to his right into the jungle, circling about until he
was in the rear of the camp. Then he approached through the dense
vegetation to the little clearing the strangers had made about
their shelters. As he peered through the curtain of tangled
creepers that hid him from their view, he saw the camp more
closely. He saw the ring of ashes that surrounded it&mdash;the
remains of the nocturnal fires that kept off the beasts of prey by
night. He saw the cooking fire before each rude shelter. He saw
pots of clay&mdash;something new to him. He saw the women and the
children and the men. They did not differ greatly from his own
people, though their garments and weapons were dissimilar. And now
he could hear all their conversation.</p>

<p>"She must be beautiful," a man was saying, "or Tur would not
venture across this strange water to those unknown lands in search
of her," and he grinned broadly, casting a knowing glance at a
young woman who suckled a babe, as she sat scraping, scraping,
scraping with a bit of sharpened flint upon the hide of an aurochs,
pegged out upon the ground before her.</p>

<p>The young woman looked up with an ugly scowl.</p>

<p>"Let him bring her back," she cried, "and she will no longer be
beautiful. This will I do to her face," and she fell to scraping
viciously upon the skin.</p>

<p>"Tur was very angry when she escaped him," continued the man.
"He almost had his hands upon her; but he will find her, though
whether there will be enough left of her to bring back is hard to
say&mdash;I, myself, rather doubt it and think that it is a foolish
thing for Tur to waste his time thus."</p>

<p>Nu was nonplused. Could it be possible that the man they called
Tur was pursuing Nat-ul to those distant islands? How could Nat-ul
be there? It was impossible. And yet there seemed little doubt from
the conversation he had overheard that the man was following some
woman across the water to the mysterious lands&mdash;a woman he had
just surprised and chased that very day, and who had eluded him.
Who else could it be but Nat-ul?</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chb5" id="chb5">V. &mdash; NU'S FIRST VOYAGE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Presently all the boats were completed, and the
men dragged them one by one down close to the water. In them they
placed their paddles, their axes and their harpoons, just as Tur
had before he departed. Nu watched them with feverish interest. At
last all have been launched, and are being paddled vigorously
beyond the surf. In the comparatively smoother water the boats turn
toward the north and south, scattering. Evidently they are not
bound for the distant islands. Nu sees a warrior rise suddenly in
the bow of one of the boats and hurl his spear quickly into the
water. Immediately there is a great commotion in the boat and in
the water beside it. There are three men in each boat. Two in the
boat Nu is watching, paddle frantically away from the thing that
lashes the sea beside them. Nu guessed what had occurred.</p>

<p>The spearman had buried his weapon in some huge creature of the
deep, and the battle was on. They were too far out for Nu to see
the details of the conflict, but he saw the boat towed swiftly by
the wounded creature as it raced toward the open sea. He saw the
boat pulled closer along-side and another spear hurled into the
fleeing thing. He understood now why these men tied their
spear-heads to long ropes. He saw the sudden commotion in the
dug-out as the hunted turned upon the hunters. He saw the swift
stroke of a mighty flipper as it rose from the water and fell with
awful fury across the boat. He saw the other boats hurrying toward
the scene of battle; but before they reached the spot all was quiet
save for two pieces of bobbing tree trunk and the head and
shoulders of a single man who clung to one of them. A few minutes
later he was dragged into another boat and the fleet dispersed
again to search out other prey.</p>

<p>Soon all were out of sight beyond a promontory except a single
craft which fished before the village. These men evidently sought
less formidable game, and Nu could see that from the teeming sea
they were dragging in great fish almost as rapidly as they could
hurl their weapons. Soon the boat was completely filled, and with
their great load the men paddled slowly inshore.</p>

<p>As they came a sudden resolution formed in Nu's mind. The sight
of the dangerous sport upon the waters had filled him with a strong
desire to emulate these strangers, but greater than that was the
power of another suggestion which the idea held forth.</p>

<p>As the men dragged the boat upon the beach the women came down
to meet them, carrying great bags of bull hide sewn with bullock
sinew. Into these they gathered the fish and dragged their loads
over the ground toward their camp.</p>

<p>The men, their day's work evidently finished, stretched out
beneath the shade of trees to sleep. This was the time! Nu moved
stealthily to his hands and knees. He grasped his long spear and
his stone ax tightly in his hands. The boat lay upon the open
beach. There was no near point where he might reach it undetected
by the women. The alternative rather appealed to Nu's warlike
nature. It was nothing less than rushing directly through the
village.</p>

<p>He came to his feet and advanced lightly among the shelters. No
need to give the alarm before he was detected. He was directly
behind the young woman who scraped the aurochs' skin. She did not
hear his light footfall. The baby, now sitting by her side playing
with the aurochs' tail, looked up to see the stranger close upon
him. He lunged toward his mother with a lusty shriek. Instantly the
camp was in commotion. No need now for stealth. With a war whoop
that might have sprung from a score of lusty lungs Nu leaped
through the village among the frightened women and the startled
men, awakened rudely from their sleep.</p>

<p>Straight toward the boat ran Nu, and upon his heels raced the
three warriors. One was coming toward him from the side. He was
quite close, so close that he came upon Nu at the same instant that
the latter reached the boat. The two fell upon one another with
their great axes, but Nu, the son of Nu, was a mighty warrior. He
dodged the blow of the other's ax, and before his adversary could
recover himself to deliver a second Nu's weapon fell upon his
skull, crushing it as if it had been an egg shell.</p>

<p>Now Nu seized the boat and dragged it toward the water as he had
seen the strangers do. But he had taken but a half-dozen steps when
he was forced to turn and defend himself against the remaining
warriors. With savage howls they were upon him, their women huddled
upon the beach behind them shouting wild cries of encouragement to
their men and defiance to the enemy. Nu abandoned the boat and
rushed to meet his antagonists. His long spear, thrown with the
power of his mighty muscles, passed through the body of the
foremost Boat Builder, who was upon the point of hurling his stout
harpoon at Nu. Down went the harpooner. Up rose a chorus of howls
and lamentations from the women. Now the third warrior closed upon
the troglodyte. It was too close for spear work, and so the fellow
dropped his heavy weapon and leaped to close quarters with his
knife. Down the two men went into the knee deep water, striking at
one another with their knives as they sought death holds with their
free hands. A great roller rumbled in upon them, turning them over
and over as it carried them up the beach. Still they fought,
sputtering and choking in the salty brine, but when the wave
receded it left a corpse behind it upon the beach, stabbed through
and through the great hairy chest by the long, keen knife of Nu,
the son of Nu.</p>

<p>The cave man rose, dripping, to his feet and turned back toward
the sea. The roller had carried the boat out with it. The women,
furious now at the death of their three men, rushed forward to drag
down the victor. Savage creatures they were, but little less
sinister than their males. Their long hair streamed in the wind.
Their faces were distorted by rage and hatred. They screamed aloud
their taunts and insults and challenges; but Nu did not wait to
battle with them. Instead he dove into the surf and struck out for
the drifting boat. His spear was lost, but he clung to his ax. His
knife he had returned to his gee-string.</p>

<p>They ran into the water to their waists, but Nu was beyond their
reach. In a moment more he had come to the side of the boat.
Tossing in his ax he clambered over the side, scarce escaping
overturning the hollowed log. Once safely within he took up the
paddle, an unaccustomed implement, and, fashioning his strokes
after those of the men he had watched, he made headway from the
shore.</p>

<p>The tide and the wind helped him, but he found, too, that he
quickly mastered the art of paddling. First he discovered that when
he paddled exclusively upon the side of his spear hand the boat
turned in the opposite direction, and so he understood why the
boatmen had paddled alternately upon one side and the other. When
he did this the craft kept a straighter course in the direction he
wished to go&mdash;the distant land of mystery.</p>

<p>Halfway across the water that spread between the main land and
the nearest island a monstrous shape loomed suddenly close to the
boat's side. A long neck surmounted by a huge reptilian head shot
above the surface, and wide gaping jaws opened to seize the
paddler. Protruding eyes glared down upon him, and then the thing
struck. Nu dodged to one side and struck back with his knife. With
a hiss and scream the creature dove beneath the surface only to
reappear a moment later upon the opposite side of the boat. Blood
flowed from the knife wound in its neck. Again it snapped at the
man, again the knife found its neck as Nu crouched to one side to
elude the gaping jaws. Once more the thing dove, and almost
simultaneously a mighty tail rose high out of the water above the
man's head. Nu seized the paddle and drove the boat forward just as
that terrific engine of destruction fell with a mighty whack upon
the very spot the boat had quit. The blow, had it touched the
craft, would have splintered it into firewood. For a few minutes
the sea was churned to white, crimson stained by the creature's
blood, as it thrashed about in impotent fury. Then, as Nu paddled
away, the raging ceased and the great carcass floated upon its
side.</p>

<p>On went Nu, paddling with redoubled energy toward the distant
goal. What he expected to find at his journey's end he could scarce
have told. That Nat-ul was there he could not believe, yet what
else was drawing him through countless dangers across the face of
the terrible waters? The man, Tur, had come hither. He it was who
had pursued Nat-ul. Was he still pursuing her? That he was
following some woman Nu was positive from the fragments of
conversation he had overheard, and yet though try as he would to
believe it he could not make his judgment accept as a possibility
the chance that it was really Nat-ul whom the man expected to find
upon this distant land.</p>

<p>The wind had risen considerably since Nu set out upon his
perilous journey. Already the waves were running high, tipped with
white. That the island lay straight before the wind was all that
saved the rude craft from instant annihilation. All about him the
sea was alive with preying monsters. Titanic duels were in progress
upon every hand, as the ferocious reptilia battled over their
kills, or, turning from the chase, fell upon one another in
frenzied joy of battle while their fortunate quarry swam rapidly
away.</p>

<p>Through innumerable dangers swept the little tree-trunk skiff to
be deposited at last upon the surf beaten beach of the nearest
island. Scarce had Nu landed and dragged his boat above the rollers
when he descried another boat a short distance from his own. That
this belonged to the man, Tur, he had no doubt, and seizing his ax
he hastened to it to pick up and follow the other's spoor wherever
it might lead.</p>

<p>Clean cut and distinct in the sand Nu found the impress of Tur's
sandals, nor did it require a second glance at them to convince the
troglodyte that they had been made by the same feet that had
pursued Nat-ul upon the mainland beach.</p>

<p>The trail led around a rocky promontory into a deep and somber
gorge. Up the center of this it followed the course of a rapid
brook, leaping downward toward the sea. From time to time the man
had evidently essayed to scale the cliffs, first upon one side and
then upon the other, but each time he had abandoned the attempt
before the difficulties and dangers of the precipitous crags.</p>

<p>To Nu the ascent would have proved a simple matter, and so he
wondered why the man had turned back each time after clambering but
a short distance from the base of the cliffs; but Tur was not a
cliff dweller. His peoples had come from a great, level river
valley beside the sea&mdash;from a country where cliffs and natural
caves were the exception rather than the rule, so he had had but
little practice in climbing of that sort.</p>

<p>Finally, at the head of the ravine, he had been forced to climb
or retrace his steps, and here, at last, he had managed to clamber
out upon the table land that stretched beyond the summit. Across
this the trail led, turning suddenly toward the west at the edge of
another ravine. The abruptness with which the spoor wheeled to the
right indicated to Nu that something had suddenly attracted the
man's attention toward the new direction and that he had proceeded
at a rapid run to investigate. Could he here have discovered the
woman he sought? Was he already in pursuit of Nat-ul?&mdash;if it
was, indeed, she. Was he even now in possession of her?</p>

<p>Nu, too, wheeled to the west and raced rapidly along the
well-marked trail. Since he had come upon the signs of Tur, Nu's
speed had been infinitely greater than that of the Boat
Builder.</p>

<p>This his woodcraft told him, so he knew that he was constantly
gaining upon the man who was still unconscious of the fact that he
was being pursued.</p>

<p>Down the steep side of the ravine Tur must have slid and rolled
in a most reckless fashion. At the bottom was a dense forest
through which the trail led back toward the sea, after the man had
made a series of frantic but futile attempts to scale the opposite
heights.</p>

<p>What had he seen or heard or followed that had led him to make
such desperate attempts to gain the opposite summit? Should Nu
follow him down the ravine, or clamber to the vantage point the
other had been unable to reach?</p>

<p>For an instant the troglodyte hesitated. Then he wheeled toward
the cliff, and with the agility of long practice backed by ages of
cliff dwelling forebears he clambered rapidly upward. At times he
was forced to leap for a projecting rock above his head, dangling
out over space as he drew himself, by mighty biceps and forearm, to
the tiny foothold it afforded. Again, a gnarled root or a small
crevice aided him in his ascent, until presently he crawled over
the brow and stood erect once more on level ground.</p>

<p>Nu looked about, warily&mdash;there was no sign of the man or
the woman. Then he examined the ground in ever enlarging circles,
but no spoor such as he sought rewarded his eager eyes.</p>

<p>He had about decided to return to the bottom of the ravine and
follow Tur's spoor when, clear and shrill from the west, there came
to his ears the scream of a woman in distress.</p>

<p>And scarce had its first note risen upon the air than Nu, the
son of Nu, was dashing madly in the direction of the sound.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chb6" id="chb6">VI. &mdash; THE ANTHROPOID APES</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">As Nat-ul, surprised by Tur in her spying upon the
village of the Boat Builders, fled north along the beach she had
little hope of permanently distancing her pursuer. But she could do
no less than flee, hoping against hope, that some chance accident
might save her from capture.</p>

<p>It was in her mind to dodge into the jungle where it came down
close to the water a quarter of a mile ahead of her. Here she might
elude the man and reach the cliffs that lay a short distance
inland. Once there, there was an excellent chance of hiding from
him or holding him off with pieces of rock until nightfall. Then
she would retrace her steps northward, for it was evident that her
people had not traveled in this direction.</p>

<p>The jungle was already quite close, but, on the other hand, the
man was gaining upon her. Could she reach the tangled screen in
time to elude him before he should be upon her? At least she could
do no less than try.</p>

<p>Suddenly from directly above her head came a loud flapping of
great wings. A black shadow fell upon the sand about her. She
glanced upward, and the sight that met her eyes froze her brave
heart in terror. There, poised just above her ready to strike with
its mighty talons, hovered one of those huge flying reptiles, that
even in Nat-ul's day were practically extinct&mdash;a gigantic
pterodactyl.</p>

<p>The man behind her screamed a shout of warning. He launched his
barbed spear for the great creature, catching it in the fatty
portion of the long tail, near the body. With a whistling scream of
pain and rage the hideous thing swooped down upon the girl beneath.
Nat-ul felt the huge talons close upon her body. The heavy hide
that covered her kept them from piercing through to her flesh as
the pterodactyl rose swiftly, bearing her victim with her.</p>

<p>For a moment Nat-ul had battled and struggled for freedom, but
almost at once she had realized the futility of her pitiful
efforts. In that awful clutch even the cave bear or the bull bos
would have been helpless. Now she hung inert and limp, waiting for
the end. She could not even draw her stone knife, for one of the
great talons was closed tightly over it where it rested in the cord
that supported her loin cloth.</p>

<p>Below her she could see the tossing waters. The thing was
bearing her far out from shore. The great wings flapped noisily
above her. The long neck and the hideous head were stretched far
forward as the creature flew in a straight line, high in the
air.</p>

<p>Presently the girl saw land ahead. Terror filled her heart as
she realized that the thing was bearing her to the mysterious
country that lay far out upon the bosom of the Restless Sea. She
had dreamed of this strange, unattainable country. There were
stories among her people of the awful creatures that dwelt within
it. She had sometimes longed to visit it, but always with the brave
warriors of her tribe to protect her. To come thus alone to the
terrifying shore, in the clutches of the most fearsome beast that
terrified primeval man was beyond conception. Her mind was
partially stupefied by the enormity of the fate that had
overwhelmed her.</p>

<p>Now the great reptile was above the nearest island. A jagged,
rocky hill raised its bare summit in a huge index finger that
pointed straight into the air far above the surrounding hill tops
and the dense vegetation of the encircling jungle. Toward this the
creature bore its prey. As it hovered above the rocky pinnacle
Nat-ul glanced fearfully downward. Directly below her her horrified
sight fell upon the goal toward which her captor had been winging
its rapid way&mdash;upon the cruel and hideous fate that awaited
her there.</p>

<p>Craning their long necks upward from a cup-like nest of
mud-matted grasses, three young pterodactyls shrilled and hissed in
anticipatory joy at their returning mother and the food she brought
them.</p>

<p>Several times the adult circled above the young, dropping lower
and lower toward the nest in a diminishing spiral. For a second she
hovered almost at rest, a few feet above them. Then she loosed her
hold upon Nat-ul, dropping her squarely amongst her wide-jawed
progeny, and with a final wheel above them soared away in search of
her own dinner.</p>

<p>As Nat-ul touched the nest three sets of sharp toothed jaws
snapped at her simultaneously. The creatures were quite young, but
for all of that they were formidable antagonists, with their many
teeth, their sharp talons and their strong tails.</p>

<p>The girl dodged the first assault and drew her knife. Here was
no time or place for hysteria or nerves. Death, unthinkably
horrible, was upon her. Her chances of escape were practically
non-existent, and yet, so strong is the instinct of
self-preservation, Nat-ul battled as heroically as though safety
depended upon a single lucky knife thrust.</p>

<p>And, though she knew it not, so it did. The three heads were
close together as the three monsters sought greedily to devour the
tender morsel brought to them by their parent. Nat-ul for a moment
eluded the snapping jaws of the awkward young, and then as the
three heads came together in a mad attempt to seize her she plunged
her blade into two of the long, scraggy necks. Instantly the
wounded creatures set up a chorus of whistling shrieks. Their
minute brains told them only that they had been hurt, and with
bestial fury they set upon one another, each attributing its pain
to one of its fellows. Instantly the nest became a mad whirling of
wings, tails and hideous jaws. The two that had been wounded set
upon each other, and the third, ignoring Nat-ul, fell upon the two
contestants with impartial fury.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of their distraction the girl clambered quickly
over the side of the nest. Below her the sheer side of the lofty
pinnacle dropped fearfully downward a hundred feet. Vertical
crevices and slight protuberances of harder rocks that had
withstood the ravages of time and the elements afforded the only
means of descent. But death, certain and terrible, lay in the nest.
Below, there was some hope, however slight.</p>

<p>Clinging to the outside of the nest Nat-ul lowered her body
until her feet found a precarious foothold upon a slightly jutting
surface of the spire-like needle. Slowly she lowered herself,
clinging desperately to each crevice and outcropping. Time and time
again it seemed that she must give up, and cling where she was
until, exhausted, she toppled to the depth below. Twice she circled
the rocky finger in search of a new foothold further down, and each
time, when hope seemed hopeless, she had found some meager thing,
once only a little rounded roughness, to which her hand or foot
could cling a few inches further away from the awful nest above
her.</p>

<p>And so at last she came to the base of the gigantic needle, but
even here she could not rest. At any moment the mighty mother might
return and snatch her back once more to the horrors of her slimy
nest.</p>

<p>The descent of the lower summit was, in places, but little less
hazardous than that of the surmounting spire; but finally it was
accomplished and Nat-ul found herself in a broad ravine, densely
wooded. Here she lay down upon the grass to rest, for her labors
had exhausted her. She knew not what other dangers menaced her; but
for the moment she was numb to further terror. Pillowing her head
upon her arm she fell asleep.</p>

<p>About her were the million sounds of the jungle&mdash;the lesser
animals, the birds, the insects, the swaying branches. They but
lulled her to deeper slumber. The winds blowing up the ravine from
the sea, fanned her cheek. It moved the soft, luxuriant hair that
fell about her shoulders. It soothed and comforted her, but it did
not whisper to her of the close-set, wicked eyes that peered out of
the trees upon her. It did not warn her of the drooling jaws, the
pendulous lower lip, the hairy breast beneath which a savage heart
beat faster as the little eyes feasted upon her form. It did not
tell her that a huge body had slipped from a nearby tree and was
slinking toward her. It did not tell her; but a broken twig,
snapping beneath the wary foot of the stalker, did.</p>

<p>Among the primordial there was no easy transition from sleep to
wakefulness. There could not be for those who would survive. As the
twig snapped Nat-ul was upon her feet facing the new danger that
menaced her. She saw a great man-like form slinking toward her. She
saw the reddish hair that covered the giant body. She saw the pig
eyes and the wolf fangs, the hulking slouch of the heavy torso upon
the short, crooked legs. And seeing, all in one swift glance, she
turned and fled up the face of the cliff down which she had so
recently descended.</p>

<p>As she clambered swiftly aloft the creature behind her rushed
forward in pursuit, and behind him came a half-dozen others like
him. Nat-ul knew them as the hairy, tree people. They differed from
the greater ape-folk in that they went always upon two legs when on
the ground, and when they were killed and cut up for food they
yielded one less rib than their apish prototype. She knew how
terrible it was to fall into their hands&mdash;worse than the fate
that had almost claimed her in the lofty nest, far above.</p>

<p>A hundred feet up the cliff side Nat-ul paused to look back. A
dozen yards below her was the hairy one. The girl loosened a bit of
rock and hurled it down upon him. He dodged it, and with a shrill
scream continued the pursuit. Upward she fled for another hundred
feet. Again she paused to look downward. The tree-man was gaining
on her. She loosened a bit of quartz and dropped it upon him. Just
below him were six others. The missile struck her foremost pursuer.
He toppled for an instant, and then tumbled backward upon those
behind him. He knocked one from a scant hand hold upon the
precipitous cliff, and the two dashed violently downward toward the
jagged rocks at the bottom.</p>

<p>With an exultant taunt upon her lips Nat-ul resumed her upward
flight. Now she came to a point near the summit. The hillside was
less steep. Here she could go with only occasional use of her
hands. Halfway up, her foot slipped upon a loose, round rock. She
fell heavily to the ground, clutching for support as she did so.
The few rocks that met her hands gave way beneath her weight. With
sickening velocity she hurtled down toward the brink of the
perpendicular cliff face&mdash;toward mangled, tortured death
beside the bodies of the two who had preceded her to the same
destruction.</p>

<p>Above the brink of the chasm the first of the remaining pursuers
was emerging. He was directly in the path of Nat-ul's swiftly
rolling body. It struck him in his hairy breast, hurling him
backward into the precipice, to his death. But his body had served
a purpose. It had broken the velocity of the girl's fall, so that
now she but rolled gently over the edge of the cliff, clutching at
the top as she went, and thus further diminishing her speed.</p>

<p>Directly below the summit lay a narrow ledge. Upon this Nat-ul
came almost to a full stop, but there was nothing there upon which
she could gain a handhold, and so she toppled slowly over the
edge&mdash;into the arms of another of the man-apes.</p>

<p>Close beside him was one of his fellows, and a little way below
the third who remained of the original six. The nearer clutched at
Nat-ul to drag her from the arms of her captor, who drew back with
bared fangs and menacing growl. But the other was insistent.
Evidently he desired the prey fully as much as he who had obtained
it. He came closer. The ledge upon which they stood was very
narrow. A battle there would have meant death for all three.</p>

<p>With a cat-like leap the creature that held Nat-ul in his arms
sprang to one side, turned, and with the strength and agility of a
chamois leaped down the steep cliff-face. In his path was the
remaining tree-man. To have met that charge would have meant being
catapulted to the bottom of the ravine. Wisely, the man-ape
side-stepped, but immediately the two had passed he fell into
pursuit of them. Behind him came the other that Nat-ul's captor had
eluded.</p>

<p>There ensued a mad chase that often blanched the cheek of the
almost fearless cave girl. From the base of the cliffs the man-ape
leaped across the intervening jungle toward the trees. To the lower
branches of these he took without lessening his speed in the least.
He almost flew, so swiftly he passed through the tangled mazes of
the primeval forest.</p>

<p>Close behind him, screaming and roaring came his two fellows,
intent upon robbing him of his prey. He carried Nat-ul across one
shoulder, gripping her firmly with a gigantic hand. She could
plainly see the pursuers behind them. They were gaining on their
burdened fellow. Already the foremost was reaching out to clutch
the girl. Her captor shooting a quick glance rearward discovered
the imminence of his despoilment. Wheeling suddenly upon the
precarious trail he snapped viciously at the nearer pursuer, who,
with bared fangs and growling horribly, retreated out of reach.
Then the creature recommenced his flight only to be at once pursued
again by his two kinsmen.</p>

<p>Up and down the jungle the savage trio raced. Twice they crossed
the heights separating one ravine from another. More and more
insistent became the pursuers. Oftener the captor was forced to
halt with his prize and fight off first one of them and then the
other. At last, at the edge of the jungle close to the mouth of a
narrow, rocky gorge the beast went mad with rage. He wheeled
suddenly upon his pursuers, hurled Nat-ul heavily to the ground,
and charged, roaring and foaming, upon them.</p>

<p>They were running side by side, and so quick was the offensive
movement of their fellow that they had no time to dodge him. His
great hands seized them and then all three went to the earth,
tearing at one another, burying their formidable tusks in throat
and breast, and all the while keeping up a terrific growling and
roaring.</p>

<p>Warily Nat-ul raised herself upon all fours. Her eyes were
fastened intently upon the three savage beasts. They paid no
attention to her. It was evident that their every faculty was
wholly engaged in the life and death struggle upon which they had
entered. Nat-ul came to her feet and without another backward
glance fled into the narrow gorge behind her. She ran as swiftly as
she could that she might put as great a distance as possible
between herself and the horrid beasts that battled for her. Where
the gorge led she had no conception. What other horrors lay at its
end she could not guess. She only knew that hope had almost left
her, for that she ever could regain the mainland she had not the
faintest belief. Nor could her people succor her even should they
discover her whereabouts, which in itself was equally beyond the
pale of probability. That she could long survive the dangers of the
mysterious country she doubted. Even a mighty warrior, fully armed,
would fare ill in this place of terror. What, indeed, was to become
of a girl armed only with a knife!</p>

<p>That Nu already was searching for her she did not doubt; but
long ere this the tide had washed the imprints of her sandals from
the sandy beach. Where would he search? And even had he followed
her spoor before the tide had erased it how could he guess what had
befallen her, or interpret the sudden ending of her trail in the
center of the beach?</p>

<p>The stranger had seen the winged reptile pounce upon her and
bear her away; but even if Nu should come upon him how could he
learn of the truth, since the moment that the two met they would
fall upon one another in mortal combat, as was the way of strangers
then.</p>

<p>Or if, by any chance, Nu discovered that she had been carried to
the mysterious country how could he follow, even though he
believed, against all reason, that she still lived?</p>

<p>No, there seemed no hope anywhere upon Nat-ul's horizon, or
below it. There was nothing left for her but to battle for
survival, pitting her wits and her agility against the brute force
and cunning of the brutes that would menace her to the end of her
days&mdash;the end that could not be far distant.</p>

<p>The windings of the gorge as she traversed it downward had shut
off the louder sounds of the combat raging behind her, though still
she could hear an occasional roar, or shriller scream of pain. She
hoped that they would fight until all were dead. Otherwise the
survivor would continue the pursuit.</p>

<p>As she stopped once to listen that she might know the three were
still engaged in battle she turned her eyes backward up the gorge,
so that, for the moment, she failed to see that she had reached the
end of the narrow canyon and that the beach and the sea lay before
her. Nor did she see the figure of the man who came to a sudden
stop at the gorge's mouth as his eyes fell upon her, nor the quick
movement that took him behind a projecting boulder.</p>

<p>Satisfied that she was not as yet being pursued Nat-ul resumed
her way down the rocky trail. As she turned she saw the sea, and,
far away, the mainland across the water. She hurried onward toward
the beach, that she might reach a point as close as possible to her
beloved country.</p>

<p>As she passed the boulder behind which the man hid the scraping
of a pebble beneath his sandal attracted her attention. She wheeled
toward him and then turned to fly; but he was too close. Already he
had leaped for her. One brawny hand closed in her flowing hair, the
other grasped the wrist of the upraised hand in which the long
knife of the girl had flashed above him with incredible
swiftness.</p>

<p>He laughed in her face&mdash;it was the stranger who had pursued
her upon the mainland beach&mdash;and then he drew her toward him.
Nat-ul fought like a tigress, and once she screamed.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chb7" id="chb7">VII. &mdash; THE BEAST-FIRES</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Tur carried the girl, still struggling and
fighting, toward his boat. For the first time he saw the boat that
had brought Nu, and wondered at the presence of another craft. Who
could it be? A closer inspection revealed that the boat was one
that had just been fashioned by others of his own tribe. Some of
the men must have followed him. Still clasping Nat-ul firmly as he
stood ankle deep in the water beside his boat he raised his voice
in a loud hallo.</p>

<p>Presently a clattering of falling stones from the cliff facing
the beach attracted the attention of Tur and the girl. Already
halfway down, the figure of an agile giant was leaping toward them
in descent. From his shoulders fluttered the skin of a cave-lion.
From his shock of black hair a single long feather rose straight
and defiantly aloft.</p>

<p>A single glance revealed to Tur the fact that this was no member
of his tribe. It was a stranger, and so an enemy. Nat-ul recognized
Nu at once. She gave a little cry of delight at sight of him, a cry
that was answered by a shout of encouragement from Nu. Tur threw
the girl roughly into the bottom of the boat, holding her there
with one hand, though she fought bitterly to escape, while with his
free hand he dragged first his boat and then Nu's out into deeper
water.</p>

<p>Handicapped though he was, Tur worked rapidly, for he was at
home in the surf and wonderfully proficient in the handling of the
cumbersome craft of his tribe even under the most adverse
conditions. At last he succeeded in shoving Nu's boat into the grip
of a receding roller that carried it swiftly away from shore, and
at the same time he shoved his own through, leaping into it with
his captive.</p>

<p>Nat-ul fought her way to her knees, calling aloud to Nu, and
striving desperately to throw herself overboard, but Tur held her
fast, paddling with one hand, and when Nu reached the water's edge
they were well beyond his reach. So, too, was his own tree-trunk.
Between him and Nat-ul the sea swarmed with carnivorous reptiles.
Every instant was carrying her away from him. The troglodyte scarce
hesitated. With a swift movement he threw off his lion skin and
discarded his stone ax, then, naked but for a loin cloth, and armed
only with his knife he dove through the pounding surf into the
frightful sea.</p>

<p>As Nat-ul witnessed his act she redoubled her efforts to retard
Tur. Crawling to her knees she threw both arms about her captor's
neck, dragging him down until he could no longer wield his paddle.
Tur fought to disengage himself. He did not wish to kill or maim
his captive&mdash;she was far too beautiful to destroy or
disfigure&mdash;he wanted her in all her physical perfection, just
as she was.</p>

<p>Gradually Nu was overhauling them. Twice he was attacked by
slimy monsters. Once he fought his way to victory, and again the
two who menaced him fell to fighting between themselves and forgot
their prey. At last he was within reach of Tur's boat. Nat-ul
battling with desperation and every ounce of her strength to hamper
Tur's movements was tugging at the man's arms. He could do nothing,
and already Nu had seized the side of the craft and was raising one
leg over it.</p>

<p>With a sudden wrench Tur freed his right hand. Nat-ul strove to
regain it, but the great fist rose above her face. With terrific
impact it fell upon her forehead. All went black before her as she
released her hold upon Tur and sank to the bottom of the boat,
unconscious.</p>

<p>Instantly Tur snatched up his paddle and leaping to his feet
beat furiously at Nu's head and hands. Bravely the man strove to
force his way into the boat in the face of this terrific
punishment; but it was too severe, and at last, half-stunned, he
slipped back into the water, as Tur drove his paddle once again and
the rude craft forged away toward the mainland.</p>

<p>When Nat-ul regained consciousness she found herself lying upon
a shaggy aurochs skin beneath a rude shelter of thatch and hide.
Her hands and feet were securely bound with tough bullock sinew.
When she struggled to free herself they cut into her soft flesh,
hurting cruelly. So she lay still looking straight up at the
funnel-like peak of the shelter's interior.</p>

<p>She knew where she was. This was one of the strange caves of the
people she had seen working upon the tree trunks, for what purpose
she now knew. She turned her head toward the entrance. Beyond she
saw men and women squatting about small fires, eating. It was
already dark. Beyond them were other fires, larger fires that kept
the savage carnivora at bay.</p>

<p>And beyond this outer circle of fires, from out of the outer
darkness, came the roaring and the coughing, the grunting and the
growling of scores of terrible beasts of prey, that slunk back and
forth about the encampment thirsting for the blood of the men and
women and children who huddled within the safety of the protecting
fires.</p>

<p>Occasionally a little boy would snatch up a burning brand and
hurl it among the night prowlers. There would be a chorus of angry
screams and low toned, rumbling growls as the menacers retreated
for an instant, then the ring of shadowy forms, and the glowing
spots of burning flame that were their eyes, would reform out of
the stygian blackness of the night.</p>

<p>Once a cave lion, emboldened by familiarity with the camp fires
of primitive people, leaped through the encircling ring of flame.
Into the midst of a family party he sprang, seizing upon an old
man. Instantly a half-hundred warriors snatched up their spears,
and as the lion turned with his prey and leaped back into the night
fifty harpoons caught him in mid-air.</p>

<p>Down he came directly on top of a flaming pile of brush, and
with him came the old man. The warriors leaped forward with
whirling axes. What mattered it if the old man was pierced by a
dozen of the spears that had been intended for the marauder? They
leaped and shouted in savage glee, for the lion was dead even
before a single ax had smitten him. The old man was dead, too. Him
they hurled out to the beasts beyond the flames; the lion they
first skinned.</p>

<p>It was an awful spectacle, that evening scene in the far
antiquity of man, when the Boat Builders, come north in search of
new fisheries, camped upon the shore of the Restless Sea in the
edge of the jungle primeval; but to Nat-ul it presented nothing
remarkable. To such scenes she had been accustomed since earliest
childhood. Of course, with her people the danger of attack by wild
beasts at night was minimized by the fact that her tribe dwelt in
caves, the mouths of which could be easily blocked against
four-footed enemies; but she was familiar with the evening fires
which burned at the cliff's base while the tribe was gathered to
feast or council, and she was used, too, to the sudden charge of
some bolder individual amongst the many that always fore-gathered
about the haunts of man at night.</p>

<p>At last the people withdrew to their shelters. Only two girls
were left, whose business it was to keep the fires burning
brightly. Nat-ul was familiar with this custom and she knew the
utilitarian origin of it. Women were the least valuable assets of a
tribe. They could best be spared in case of a sudden onslaught by
some fierce beast at night&mdash;it was the young men, who soon
were to become warriors, that must be preserved. The death of a
single girl would count for little&mdash;her purpose would have
been served if the screams of herself and her companion aroused the
warriors.</p>

<p>But why not old and useless women instead of young girls? Merely
because the instinct of self-preservation is stronger in the young
than in the very old. An old woman would have been much less
careless of her life than would a young woman, and so might sleep
and permit the fires to die out&mdash;she would have but a few
years or months to live anyway and little or nothing to live for in
those primitive days.</p>

<p>The young woman, on the contrary, would watch the fires
zealously for her own protection, and so ensure the greater safety
of the tribe. Thus, perhaps, was born the custom from which sprung
the order of holy virgins who tended the eternal fires in the
temples that were yet unbuilt in the still undreamed-of Rome.</p>

<p>Presently the entrance to the shelter in which Nat-ul was
secured was darkened by the figure of a man&mdash;it was Tur.
Nat-ul recognized him at once. He came to her side and knelt.</p>

<p>"I have kept the women from you," he said. "Gron would have torn
you to pieces, and the others would have helped her. But you need
not fear them. Promise me that you will not resist, or attempt to
escape, and you shall be freed from your bonds permanently.
Otherwise I shall have to tie you up whenever I am away, and then
there is no telling what Gron may do, since you will be defenseless
and I not here to keep her from you. What do you say?"</p>

<p>"I say that the moment my hands are freed I shall fight until I
kill or am killed," replied the girl; "and when my feet are loosed
I shall run away as fast as I can."</p>

<p>Tur shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said. "It will profit you nothing, unless you
enjoy being always tied in this uncomfortable position."</p>

<p>He stooped and commenced to work upon the knots that held her
feet and ankles. Outside the shelter something slunk stealthily in
the shadows. Tur did not hear the faint scraping sound of the
creature's wary advance. His back was toward the entrance of the
shelter as he knelt low over the hard knots in the bullock sinews.
Already he had released the cords that encircled Nat-ul's ankles,
and now he was turning his attention to those at her knees. The
girl lay quietly, her face toward the lesser darkness which showed
through the entrance. She would wait patiently until he had freed
her, and then she would fight until the man was forced to kill
her.</p>

<p>Suddenly she became aware of the darker shadow of a form
blotting a portion of the dark entrance way. The creature was not
large enough to be of the more formidable carnivora, though it
might have been a hyena or a wild dog. Nat-ul was on the point of
warning the man, when it occurred to her that here might be not
only the quick death she now craved, but at the same time a means
of revenging herself upon her captor.</p>

<p>She lay very quiet while Tur labored over the last knot. Close
behind the man crept the silent prowler of the night. Nat-ul could
imagine the bared fangs and the slavering jowls. In another instant
there would be a savage growl as the thing closed with a swift
spring upon its prey.</p>

<p>Or would it leap past the man upon her unprotected throat? The
girl's eyes were wide in fascinated horror. She shuddered once as
in the close presence of death. The last knot loosened beneath
Tur's fingers. He jerked the cord from about the girl's knees with
a low exclamation of satisfaction.</p>

<p>And then Nat-ul saw the thing behind the man rear upon its hind
legs and spring full upon his back. There was no savage
growl&mdash;no sound. The silence of the attack rendered it
infinitely more horrible than would bestial roars and growls that
might have proclaimed the nature of the animal.</p>

<p>Tur rolled over upon his side to grapple with his antagonist. In
an instant they were locked in furious combat. Nat-ul staggered to
her feet. Her arms still were pinioned, but her legs were free.
Here was her opportunity! Leaping over the two blood-mad beasts she
darted from the shelter and plunged into the nearby jungle.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chb8" id="chb8">VIII. &mdash; BOUND TO THE STAKE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Nu, the son of Nu, half-stunned by the paddle of
Tur, still managed to keep afloat until he partially regained his
senses. Then, seeing the futility of further attempt to overtake
the boat in which Nat-ul was being borne toward the mainland, he
struck out for the shore of the island. For a while he lay upon the
hot sand, resting. Then he arose looking out across the water. Far
in the distance he could see a tiny speck approaching the opposite
shore. It must be the boat in which Nat-ul had been carried off. Nu
marked the spot&mdash;in the distance a lofty mountain peak reared
its head far inland.</p>

<p>Nu bethought himself of the boat that had brought him to the
island. He looked out to sea for it, but it was not in sight there.
He walked along the beach. Beyond a heap of wave washed boulders he
came upon the thing he sought. He could have shouted aloud, so
elated was he. There before him lay the boat and in it was the
paddle. He ran forward and pulled it up upon the beach, then he
hurried back to the spot at which he had discarded his robe and ax,
and after regaining them returned to the dug-out.</p>

<p>A moment more saw him floundering out through the surf. He
leaped into the craft, seized the paddle and struck out for the
far-off shore line. With paddle and ax and stone knife he fought
off the marauders of the sea. The journey was marked by a series of
duels and battles that greatly impeded the man's progress. But he
was not discouraged. He was accustomed to nothing else. It was his
life, as it was the life of every creature that roamed the land or
haunted the deeps in those stupendously savage days.</p>

<p>It was quite dark when the heavy booming of the surf before him
warned Nu that he was close in-shore. For some time he had seen the
fires of the Boat Builders ahead of him and toward these he had
directed his way. Now his boat ran its blunt nose out upon the sand
a hundred yards north of the camp. Nu leaped out, leaving the boat
where it lay. He doubted that he should ever have further use for
it, but should he live to return to his people he would lose no
time in building a similar craft with which he should fill his
father's people with awe and admiration.</p>

<p>About the camp of the Boat Builders, as Nu approached, he
discovered the usual cordon of night prowlers that he had naturally
expected. Circling until he was downwind from the shelters he was
enabled to reach the jungle without being discovered by any of the
more ferocious beasts. Once he just eluded a ponderous cave bear
that was lumbering toward the encampment in search of prey, and
again he almost stumbled against a huge rhinoceros as it lay in the
long grasses upon the jungle's outer fringe. But once within the
jungle he took to the trees, since among their branches there were
few that he had reason to fear. The panther sometimes climbed to
the lower branches, but, though he was a mighty beast by comparison
with the panther of the twentieth century, Nu looked upon him with
contempt, since he seldom deliberately hunted man and could be put
to flight, if not killed, by a well-hurled ax. Reptiles constituted
the greatest menace to the jungle traveler who chose the branches
of the trees, for here often lurked enormous snakes in whose giant
coils the mightiest hunters were helpless as babes.</p>

<p>To the rear of the village Nu traveled through the trees,
leaping in the dark from one huge frond to another. When the
distance was too great to span in a single leap he came to the
ground, springing across the intervening space with the speed and
agility of a deer. At last he came to the edge of the jungle
opposite the camp. The fires came close beneath the tree in which
he hid. He could see the girls tending them, and further in, the
balance of the tribe squatting about their smaller cooking fires,
gnawing upon bones, or splitting them to extract the marrow.</p>

<p>He saw the rush of the lion upon the opposite side of the camp.
He saw him seize the old man. He saw the warriors leap to their
feet and run toward the beast. He saw the eyes and attention of
every member of the tribe directed toward the spot which was
farthest from Nu. Even the girls who were tending the fires below
him ran quickly across the village to witness the killing of the
marauder.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of this fortuitous good fortune Nu dropped
quickly to the ground and ran for the shadows of the shelters which
were placed in a rude circle facing outward toward the outer circle
of fires with the result that the circular space they enclosed was
in partial shadow. Here Nu threw himself upon his belly in the
darkest spot he could find. For some time he lay motionless,
listening and sniffing the air. As nothing rewarded his
observations at this point he rose cautiously upon all fours and
crept a few feet further on in the shadows of the shelters. Again
he lay down to listen and sniff. For half an hour he pursued his
slow way about the inner circle behind the dwellings. The
inhabitants had retired&mdash;all except the girls who tended the
fires.</p>

<p>At last Nu heard low voices coming from the interior of a
shelter behind which he had but just crawled. He lay very quiet
with his nose a few inches from the bottom of the skin and thatch
hut. Presently there came to his sensitive nostrils the evidence he
had been seeking&mdash;within was Nat-ul; but there was someone
with her. Cautiously Nu crept around to the front of the shelter.
Even there it was very dark, for the girls had permitted the fires
to die down to a few fitful flames. Opposite the entrance Nu heard
Nat-ul's voice distinctly. He saw the form of a man leaning over
her. He went hot with hate and rage. Like a beast of prey he slunk
noiselessly upon all fours into the shelter directly behind the
unsuspecting Tur. Then without a sound he rose to his feet and
threw himself full upon the back of the stranger.</p>

<p>His knife was out and his fighting fangs were bared as the two
rolled about the floor of the shelter striking, clawing and biting
at one another. At last the man raised his voice in a call for
help, for Nu was getting the better of him. The long knife had not
found a vital spot as yet, for Tur was an experienced fighter and
so far had been able to ward off the more dangerous blows; but
nevertheless he was bleeding from several wounds and his throat and
breast were lacerated by the other's teeth.</p>

<p>In reply to his shouts the village awoke with answering cries.
Warriors, bearing their short spears, ran from every shelter. Women
and children scampered at their heels. Gron, Tur's mate, was among
the first to come. She had recognized the voice of her man and had
guessed where he might be in trouble. Like an angry tigress she
sprang for the shelter in which the beautiful stranger had been
confined. Behind her came the warriors. One carried a burning brand
from a nearby fire. He flung it into the interior, careless of
where it might land. Fortunately for the inmates it fell beyond
them, rolling against the further side of the hut. Instantly the
dry fronds of the thatch that had been leaned against the bottom of
the skins to fill in the gaps caught fire and the inside of the
shelter was illumined by the sudden glare of flames.</p>

<p>When the rescuers saw that but a single man opposed their fellow
they threw themselves upon the two, and though Nu battled bravely
he was presently overcome. The entire hut was now aflame, so that
his captors were forced to drag him outside. Here they bound his
arms and legs, and then turned their attention to saving the
balance of the village from destruction. This they accomplished by
pulling down the blazing shelter with their spears and beating out
the flames with fresh hides.</p>

<p>Even in the excitement of the fight Nu had not for a moment
forgotten Nat-ul, and when the brand lighted up the interior he had
sought for her with his eyes, unsuccessfully&mdash;Nat-ul had
disappeared.</p>

<p>He wondered what could have become of her. From her position
upon the floor of the hut he had been sure that she was securely
bound&mdash;otherwise she would have been fighting tooth and nail
against her captor. He looked about him from where he lay before
the ruins of the burned shelter. He could see nothing of her; but
he saw another woman&mdash;a young woman with good features but
with the expression of a wild beast. Hate, jealousy and rage were
mirrored in every line of the passion-distorted countenance. It was
Gron. She came toward him.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" she cried.</p>

<p>"I am Nu, the son of Nu," replied the man.</p>

<p>"Are you of the same people as the woman in whose shelter you
found my man?" she continued.</p>

<p>Nu nodded affirmatively.</p>

<p>"She was to have been my mate," he said. "Where is she?"</p>

<p>For the first time the woman seemed to realize the absence of
the fair prisoner. She turned toward Tur.</p>

<p>"Where is the woman?" she shrieked. "Where have you hidden the
woman? No longer shall you keep me from her. This time I shall tear
out her heart and drink her blood."</p>

<p>Tur looked about in consternation.</p>

<p>"Where is the woman?" he called to the warriors; but none seemed
to know.</p>

<p>Immediately a search of the village commenced. The warriors ran
hither and thither through the huts, and into the enclosure behind
them. Nu lay awaiting the outcome of the search. As it became
evident that Nat-ul had escaped his heart leaped with joy. At last
there was no other place to look and all the searchers had
returned&mdash;Nat-ul was not in the village.</p>

<p>Gron turned toward Nu.</p>

<p>"Your woman has escaped me," she shouted; "but you shall suffer
for her," and she leaped upon him as he lay there bound and
defenseless.</p>

<p>In her mad rage she would have torn his eyes out had not a tall
warrior interfered. He seized the woman by her hair, jerking her
roughly from her victim. Then he swung her, still by the hair,
brutally to the ground.</p>

<p>"Take your woman away," he called to Tur. "Does a woman rule my
people? Take her away and beat her, that she may learn that it is
not a woman's place to interfere with the doings of men. Then take
you another mate, that this woman may be taught her place."</p>

<p>Tur seized upon the unfortunate Gron and dragged her toward his
own shelter, from which, later, could be heard the sound of a spear
haft falling upon flesh, and the shrieks and moans of a woman.</p>

<p>Nu was disgusted. Among his people women were not treated thus.
He looked up at the burly form of the chief who was standing over
him. Well, why didn't they kill him? That was the proper thing to
do with male prisoners. Among his own tribe a spear thrust through
the heart would long since have settled the fate of one in Nu's
position. He wondered where Nat-ul was. Could she find her way back
to the tribe, safely? He wished that he might live but long enough
to find her, and see her safe in her father's cave.</p>

<p>The chief was gazing intently upon him; but he had as yet made
no move to finish him.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he at length asked.</p>

<p>"I am Nu, the son of Nu," replied the prisoner.</p>

<p>"From where do you come?"</p>

<p>Nu nodded toward the north.</p>

<p>"From near the Barren Cliffs," he replied. "And should you go
thither, beater of women, my father's tribe would fall upon you and
kill you all."</p>

<p>"You talk big," said the chief.</p>

<p>"I talk truth," retorted Nu. "My father's people would laugh at
such as you&mdash;at men clothed in the skins of cows. It shows
what manner of people you be. Now, my father's warriors wear the
skins of Ur, and Zor and Oo, and upon their feet are sandals of the
hides of Ta and Gluh. They are men. They would laugh as they sent
their women and children out with sticks to drive you away."</p>

<p>This was a terrible insult. The chief of the Boat Builders
trembled with rage.</p>

<p>"You shall see," he cried, "that we are men. And the manner of
your death will prove if you be such a brave man as you say.
Tomorrow you shall die&mdash;after the day is done and the fires
are lighted you shall begin to die; but it will be long before you
are dead, and all the time you will be crying out against the woman
who bore you, and begging us to put you out of your misery."</p>

<p>Nu laughed at him. He had heard of distant peoples who tortured
their prisoners, and so he guessed what the chief meant to suggest.
Well, he would show them how the son of Nu could die.</p>

<p>Presently at the chief's command a couple of warriors dragged Nu
into a nearby shelter. A guard was placed before the door, for the
escape of Nat-ul had warned them to greater watchfulness.</p>

<p>The long night dragged itself to a slow end. The sun rose out of
the Restless Sea. The villagers bestirred themselves. Nu could
smell the cooking food. He was very hungry, but they offered him
not a single morsel. He was thirsty but none brought him water, and
he was too proud to ask favors of his captors.</p>

<p>If the night had been long the day seemed an eternity, and
though he knew that darkness was to be the signal for the
commencement of the tortures that were to mark his passing he
welcomed the first shadows of the declining sun.</p>

<p>Whatever cruelties they might perpetrate upon him could not last
forever. Sooner or later he would die, and with this slim comfort
Nu, the son of Nu, waited for the end.</p>

<p>The fishers had all returned. The outer ring of fires had been
kindled, as well as the smaller cooking fires within. The people
squatted about on their haunches gnawing upon their food like
beasts. At last they had completed their evening meal. A couple of
men brought a small post and after scooping a hole in the ground
with their spears set it up halfway between the shelters and the
outer fires.</p>

<p>Then two warriors came to the hut where Nu lay. They seized him
by the feet and dragged him, upon his back and shoulders, through
the village. The women and children poked him with sharp sticks,
threw stones at him and spat upon him. Nu, the son of Nu, made no
remonstrances. Not by so much as a line did the expression of utter
indifference that set his features like a mask alter in response to
painful blows or foul indignities.</p>

<p>At last his guard stopped before the post which was now set
firmly upright in the ground. They jerked Nu to his feet, and bound
him securely to the stake. In a circle about him was a ring of
brush wood. He knew that he was to be slowly roasted, for the brush
was nowhere quite close enough for the flames to reach him. It
would be a slow death, very pleasant to the eyes of the
audience&mdash;especially if the victim gave evidence of his
agonies. But it was far from the intention of Nu, the son of Nu, to
afford the Boat Builders this satisfaction. He looked around upon
the ring of eager, savage faces with bored contempt. Nu despised
them, not because they would kill him, for that he might expect
from any strangers, but because they wore the skins of "cows" and
the men labored instead of devoting all their time and energies to
the chase and to warfare.</p>

<p>Their boats were fine to have&mdash;Nu had even thought of
fashioning one upon his return to his people; but to make a
business of such labor&mdash;ugh! it was disgusting. Had he escaped
he should have returned to the Boat Builders with his father's
warriors and taken what boats he wished.</p>

<p>His meditations were cut short by the ceremonies which were
going on about him. There had been dancing, and a certain primitive
chanting, and now one of the warriors lighted the brush that
surrounded the victim at the stake.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chb9" id="chb9">IX. &mdash; THE FIGHT</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">After Nu, the son of Nu, had left his father and
his father's people to go in search of Nat-ul and Hud, the warrior
chief had sat in silence for many minutes. Beside him sat Tha,
father of Nat-ul, and round about squatted the other members of the
tribe. All were silent in the face of the sorrow that had overtaken
their chief and his principal lieutenant. Nu and Nat-ul were great
favorites among their savage fellows. Not so, however, Hud, and the
anger against him was bitter.</p>

<p>Presently Nu, the chief, spoke.</p>

<p>"We cannot go in search of a new home," he said, "leaving two of
our children behind."</p>

<p>His listeners knew that he ignored Hud&mdash;that Hud, in
bringing this sorrow upon the tribe, had forfeited his rights among
them. They were satisfied that it should be so. A young warrior
stood up. With his spear he drew a line upon the ground from east
to west and lying just north of him.</p>

<p>"Nu, the son of Nu, passed through the ordeals with me&mdash;we
became men and warriors upon the same day. Together we hunted our
first lion." He paused, and then, pointing to the line he had drawn
upon the ground, continued: "Never shall I cross this line until I
have found Nu, the son of Nu."</p>

<p>As he ceased speaking he drew himself to his full height and
with arms folded across his broad chest turned to face his
chief.</p>

<p>From the tribe came grunts of approval. All eyes turned toward
Nu. What would he do? The young warrior's act was nothing short of
rebellion. Suddenly Aht, brother of Nat-ul, sprang to his feet and
stood beside the defiant warrior. He said nothing&mdash;his act
proclaimed his intention.</p>

<p>Nu, the chief, looked at the two young men from beneath his
shaggy brows. The watchers were almost certain that a half-smile
played grimly about his grim countenance. He, too, arose. He walked
to where the two stood and ranged himself beside them.</p>

<p>Tha was the first to guess the significance of the act, and the
instant that he did so he leaped to Nu's side. Then the others
understood, and a moment later the whole tribe was ranged with
their backs to Dag's line, facing toward the south. They were
dancing and shouting now. The men waved their stone axes or threw
their long spears high in the air. The women beat their palms
together, and the little children ran skipping about, getting in
everyone's way.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of this Nu started off toward the south,
telling off a score of men to remain with the women and children
who were to follow slowly back toward their former dwellings while
the chief with the balance of the fighting men searched rapidly
ahead for signs of Nu and Nat-ul.</p>

<p>First they came upon the dead body of Hud within the cave in the
face of the Barren Cliffs. From there they discovered Nu's spoor
and faint traces of the older spoor of the girl, showing that Nu
had not overtaken her at this point.</p>

<p>On they went along the beach toward their old caves, and
everywhere the signs of one or the other of those they followed
were distinguishable. It was dark when they reached the caves, and
the following morning they had difficulty in again picking up the
spoor because of the fact that the tide had obliterated it where it
had touched the sandy beach at low tide. Now Nu separated his
warriors into three parties. One, with which he remained, was to
keep south along the beach, the second was to work into the jungle
for a mile and then turn south, while the third was to search
straight inland toward the west. In this way one of them must come
upon those they sought, or some sign of them.</p>

<p>Tha was in command of the central party, and Aht was with him.
Dag was with Nu, the chief. They beat rapidly along the beach, and
spread out across it from the water to the jungle, that nothing
might escape their observation.</p>

<p>Several times they followed false leads into the jungle, so that
they lost much time, with the result that darkness came upon them
without their having discovered the two they sought.</p>

<p>They camped upon the sand just outside the jungle, building a
ring of fires about them to keep off the wild beasts. Then they lay
down to sleep&mdash;all but two who kept watch and tended the
fires.</p>

<p>Dag was one of the watchers. As the night grew darker he became
aware of a glow in the south. He called his companion's attention
to it.</p>

<p>"There are men there," he said. "That is the light from
beast-fires. Listen!"</p>

<p>Savage yells rose faintly from the distance, and in the
direction of the lights. Dag was on the point of arousing Nu when
his keen eyes detected something moving warily between the jungle
and the camp. Evidently it had but just crept out of the dense
vegetation. Ordinarily Dag might have thought it a beast of prey;
but with the discovery of the nearness of a camp of men, he was not
so sure.</p>

<p>True, men seldom crept through the jungle after darkness had
fallen; but there was something about the movements of this
creature that suggested the crawling of a man on all fours.</p>

<p>Dag circled the camp, apparently oblivious of the presence of
the intruder. He threw a stick upon a blaze here, and there he
stamped out some smoking faggots that had fallen inside the ring.
But all the while he watched the movements of the thing that crept
through the outer darkness toward the camp.</p>

<p>He could see it more distinctly now, and was aware that from
time to time it cast a backward glance over its shoulder.</p>

<p>"Had it a companion, or companions? Was something following it?"
Dag scrutinized the black face of the jungle beyond the creeping
thing.</p>

<p>"Ah! so that was it?"</p>

<p>A dark shadow had stepped from the somber wood upon the trail of
the creature that was now halfway across the open space between the
jungle and the camp. Dag needed no second glance to attest the
identity of the newcomer. The lithe body, the black mass that
marked the bristling mane, the crouching pose, the two angry
splotches of yellow-green fire&mdash;no doubt here. It was Zor, the
lion, stalking his prey.</p>

<p>Dag whispered a word to his companion who came to his side. The
two stood looking straight toward the nearer creature, with no
attempt to disguise the fact that they had discovered it.</p>

<p>"It is a man," whispered Dag's companion.</p>

<p>And then, with a frightful roar, Zor charged, and the creature
before it rose upon two feet full in the light of the nearer blaze.
With a cry that aroused the whole camp Dag leaped beyond the
flaming circle, his spear hand thrown back, the stone head,
laboriously chipped to a sharp point, directed at the charging
Zor.</p>

<p>The weapon passed scarce a hand's breadth from the shoulder of
Zor's prey and buried itself in the breast of the beast. At the
same instant Dag leaped past the fugitive, placing himself directly
in the path of the lion with only an ax and knife of stone to
combat the fury of the raging, wounded demon of destruction.</p>

<p>Over his shoulder he threw a word to the one he had leaped forth
to succor.</p>

<p>"Run within the beast-fires, Nat-ul," he cried; "Zor's mate is
coming to his aid."</p>

<p>And sure enough, springing lightly across the sands came a
fierce lioness, maned like her lord.</p>

<p>Now Dag's fellow warrior had sprung to his side, and from the
camp were running the balance of the savage spearmen. Zor, rearing
upon his hind feet, was striking at Dag who leaped nimbly from side
to side, dodging the terrific blows of the mighty, taloned paws,
and striking the beast's head repeatedly with his heavy ax. The
other warrior met the charge of the infuriated lioness with his
spear. Straight into the broad breast ran the sharp point, the
while the man clung tenaciously to the haft, whipped hither and
thither as the beast reared and wheeled and struck at him with her
claws.</p>

<p>Now Nu, the chief, and his fellows arrived upon the scene. A
score of spears bristled from the bodies of Zor and his mate. Axes
fell upon their heads, and Nu, the mighty, leaped upon Zor's back
with only his stone knife. There he clung to the thick mane,
driving the puny weapon time and again into back and side until at
last the roaring, screaming beast rolled over upon its side to rise
no more.</p>

<p>The lioness proved more tenacious of life than her lord, and
though bristling with spears and cut to ribbons with the knives of
her antagonists she charged into close quarters with a sudden rush
that found one of the cave men a fraction of a second too slow. The
strong claws raked him from neck to groin and as he fell the mighty
jaws closed with a sickening crunch upon his skull.</p>

<p>At bay over her victim the lioness stood growling and
threatening, while the wild warriors danced in a circle about her
awaiting the chance to rush in and avenge their comrade.</p>

<p>Within the circle of fires Nat-ul replenished the blaze, keeping
the whole scene brilliantly lighted for the warriors. That she had
stumbled upon men of her own tribe so unexpectedly seemed little
short of miraculous. She could scarce wait for the battle with the
lions to be concluded, so urgent was the business that filled her
thoughts.</p>

<p>But at last Zor's savage mate lay dead, and as Nu, the chief,
returned to the camp Nat-ul leaped forward to meet him.</p>

<p>"Quick!" she cried. "They are killing Nu, thy son," and she
pointed toward the south in the direction of the glare that was now
plainly visible through the darkness.</p>

<p>Nu did not wait to ask questions then. He called his warriors
about him.</p>

<p>"Nat-ul says that they slay Nu, the son of Nu, there," he said,
pointing toward the distant fire-glow. "Come!"</p>

<p>As Nat-ul led them along the beach and through the jungle she
told Nu, the chief, all that had transpired since Hud had stolen
her away. She told of her wanderings, and of the Boat Builders. Of
how one had chased her, and of the terrible creature that had
seized and carried her to its nest. She told of the strange
creature that crawled into the shelter where she was confined,
leaping upon the back of Tur. And of how she slipped out of the
shelter as the two battled, and escaped into the jungle, wriggling
her hands from their bonds as she ran. She shuddered as she told Nu
of the gauntlet of savage beasts she had been forced to run between
the beast-fires of the Boat Builders and the safety of the jungle
trees.</p>

<p>"I rested for the balance of the night in a great tree close
beside the village of the strangers," she said. "Early the next
morning I set out in search of food, intending to travel northward
until I came to our old dwellings where I could live in comparative
safety.</p>

<p>"But all the time I kept wondering what it might have been that
leaped upon Tur's back in the shelter the night before and the more
I thought about it the more apparent it became that it might have
been a man&mdash;that it must have been a man, for what animal
could pass through the beast-fires unseen?</p>

<p>"And so, after filling my stomach, I crept back through the
trees to the edge of the village, and there I watched. The sun then
was straight above me&mdash;half the day was gone. I could not
reach the caves before darkness if anything occurred to delay me,
and as I might at any moment stumble upon some of the strangers or
be treed by Ur, or Zor, or Oo, I decided to wait until early
tomorrow morning before setting out for the caves. There was
something within me that urged me to remain. What it was I do not
know; but it was as though there were two Nat-uls, one wishing to
hurry away from the land of the strangers as rapidly as possible
and the other insisting that it was her duty to remain. At last I
could deny my other self no longer&mdash;I must stay, and so I
found a comfortable position in a great tree that grows close
beside the clearing where the strangers' village stands, and there
I remained until long after darkness came.</p>

<p>"It was then that I saw the thing within the village that sent
me here. Before, I had seen your fires, and wondered who it might
be that came from the north. I knew that all the strangers had
returned in the afternoon, so it could be none of them, and the
first tribe to the north I knew was my own, so I hoped, without
believing, that it might indeed be some of thy warriors, Nu.</p>

<p>"And then I saw that something was going to occur in the village
below me. Warriors approached a hut from which they dragged a
captive. By the legs they dragged him, through the village and
about it, and as they did so the women and children tortured and
spat upon the prisoner.</p>

<p>"At first I could not see the victim plainly, but at last as
they raised him to his feet and bound him to a stake where they are
going to roast him alive among slow fires I saw his face.</p>

<p>"Oh, Nu, can you not guess who it was that had followed me so
far, had overcome such dangers and fought his way through the awful
waters to rescue me?"</p>

<p>"Nu, the son of Nu," said the old warrior, and his chest swelled
with pride as he strode through the jungle in the rear of the
village.</p>

<p>Angry beasts of prey menaced the rescuing party upon every hand.
Twice were they attacked and compelled to battle with some fierce,
primordial brute; but at last they won to the edge of the jungle
behind the village they sought.</p>

<p>There the sight that met their eyes and ears was one of wild
confusion. Men and women were running hither and thither uttering
shouts of rage. Beyond them was a circle of flaming brush. In the
center of this, Nat-ul told the rescuers, Nu, the son of Nu, was
fast bound to a stake. Slowly he was roasting to
death&mdash;possibly he was already dead.</p>

<p>Nu gathered his warriors about him. Two he commanded to remain
always beside Nat-ul. Then, with the others at his heels, his long,
white feather nodding bravely above his noble head, and the shaggy
pelt of Ur, the cave bear, falling from his shoulders, Nu, the
chief, slunk silently out of the jungle toward the village of the
excited Boat Builders.</p>

<p>There were forty of them, mighty men, mightily muscled. In their
strong hands they grasped their formidable spears and heavy axes.
In their loin cloths rested their stone knives for the moment when
they closed in hand-to-hand combat with foes. In their savage
brains was but a single idea&mdash;to kill&mdash;to kill&mdash;to
kill!</p>

<p>To the outer rim of fires they came and yet the excited populace
within had not discovered them. Then a girl, remembering tardily
her duties at the fires, turned to throw more brush upon the blaze
and saw them&mdash;saw a score of handsome, savage faces just
beyond the flames.</p>

<p>With a scream of terror and warning she turned and scurried
amongst the villagers. For an instant the hub-bub was stilled, only
to break out anew at the girl's frightened cry of: "Warriors!
Warriors!"</p>

<p>Then Nu and his men were among them. The warriors of the Boat
Builders ran forward to meet the attackers. The women and children
fled to the opposite side of the enclosure. Hoarse shouts and
battle cries rang out as the Cliff Dwellers hurled themselves upon
the Boat Builders. A shower of long slim spears volleyed from one
side, to be answered by the short, stout harpoons of the
villagers.</p>

<p>Then the warriors rushed to closer conflict with their axes.
Never after the first assault was the outcome of the battle in
question&mdash;the fiercer tribe of Nu&mdash;the hunters of beasts
of prey&mdash;the warrior people&mdash;were the masters at every
turn. Back, back they forced the wearers of "cow" skins, until the
defenders had been driven across the enclosure upon their women and
children.</p>

<p>And now the inner circle of fires was surrendered to the
invaders, and as Nat-ul sprang between the warriors of her people
to be first to the side of Nu and cut away his bonds, the last of
the Boat Builders turned and fled into the outer darkness, along
the beach to where their boats were drawn up beyond the tide.</p>

<p>Nu, the chief, leaped through the flames upon the heels of
Nat-ul. In the terrible heat within the two came side by side
before the stake. The girl gave a single glance at the bare and
smoking pole and at the ground around it before she turned and
threw herself into Nu's arms.</p>

<p>Nu, the son of Nu, was not there, nor was his body within the
enclosure.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chb10" id="chb10">X. &mdash; GRON'S REVENGE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Gron, suffering and exhausted from the effects of
the cruel beating Tur had administered, lay all the following day
in her shelter. Tur did not molest her further. Apparently he had
forgotten her, a suggestion which aroused all her primitive
savagery and jealousy as no amount of brutal punishment might have
done.</p>

<p>All day she lay suffering, and hating Tur. All day she planned
new and diabolical schemes for revenge. Close to her breast she
hugged her stone knife. It was well for Tur that he did not chance
to venture near her then. While he had beaten her the knife had
remained in her loin cloth, nor had the thought to use it against
her mate entered the head of Gron; but now, now that he had
deserted her, now that he was doubtless thinking upon a new mate
her thoughts constantly reverted to the weapon. It was not until
after nightfall that Gron crawled from beneath the hides and thatch
of her shelter. She had not eaten for twenty-four hours, yet she
felt no hunger&mdash;every other sense and emotion was paralyzed by
the poison of jealousy and hate. Gron slunk about the outskirts of
the crowd that pressed around the figure at the stake.</p>

<p>Ah, they were about to torture the prisoner! What pleasure they
would derive from that! Gron raised herself on tip-toe to look over
the shoulder of a woman. The latter turned, and, recognizing her,
grinned.</p>

<p>"Tur will enjoy the death agonies of the mate of the woman he is
going to take in your stead, Gron," taunted her friend.</p>

<p>Gron made no reply. It was not the way of her period to betray
the emotions of the heart. She would rather have died than let this
woman know that she suffered.</p>

<p>"That is why he was so angry," continued the tormentor, "when
you tried to rob him of this pleasure."</p>

<p>With the woman's words a sudden inspiration flashed into the
mind of Gron. Yes, Tur would be made mad if the prisoner escaped.
So would Scarb, the chief who had commanded Tur to beat her and to
take another mate.</p>

<p>Gron raised herself again upon her toes and looked long and
earnestly at the face of the man bound to the stake. Already the
flames of the encircling fires illuminated his figure and his every
feature&mdash;they stood out as distinctly as by sunlight. The man
was very handsome. There was no man among the tribe of Scarb who
could compare with the stranger in physical perfection and beauty.
A gleam of pleasure shot through Gron's dark eyes. If she could
only find such another man, and run off with him then, indeed,
would she be revenged upon Tur. If it could be this very man! Ah,
then, indeed, would Scarb and Tur both be punished. But that, of
course, was impossible&mdash;the man would be dead in a few
hours.</p>

<p>Gron wandered about the village&mdash;too filled with her hate
to remain long in one place. Like an angry tigress she paced to and
fro. Now and again some other woman of the tribe hurled a taunt or
a reproach at her.</p>

<p>It would be ever thus. How she hated them&mdash;every one of
them. As she passed her shelter in her restless rounds she heard
the plaintive wailing of her child. She had almost forgotten him.
She hurried within, snatching up the infant from where it lay upon
a pile of otter and fox skins.</p>

<p>This was Tur's child&mdash;his man-child. Already it commenced
to resemble the father. How proud Tur was of it. Gron gasped at the
hideous thought that followed remorselessly upon the heels of this
recollection. She held the child at arm's length and tried to
scrutinize its features in the dim interior of the hut.</p>

<p>How Tur would suffer if harm befell his first
man-child&mdash;his only offspring! Gron almost threw the wee
bundle of humanity back upon its pile of skins, and leaping to her
feet ran from the shelter.</p>

<p>For half an hour she roamed restlessly about the camp. Her brain
was a whirling chaos of conflicting emotions. A dozen times she
approached the death fires that were slowly roasting alive the man
bound to the stake they encircled. As yet they had not injured
him&mdash;but given him a taste of the suffering to come, that was
all.</p>

<p>Suddenly she came face to face with Tur. Involuntarily her hands
went out in a gesture of appeal and supplication. She was directly
in Tur's path. The man stopped and looked at her for an instant,
then with a sneer that was half snarl he raised his hand and struck
her in the face.</p>

<p>"Get out of my way, woman!" he growled, and passed on.</p>

<p>A group of women, standing near, had seen. They laughed
boisterously at the discomfiture of their sister. But let us not
judge them too harshly&mdash;it was to require countless ages of
humanizing culture before their sisters yet unborn were to be able
to hide the same emotions.</p>

<p>Gron went cold and hot and cold again. She burned with rage and
humiliation. She froze with resolve&mdash;a horrid resolve. And
suddenly she went mad. Wheeling from where she stood she ran to the
shelter that housed her babe. In the darkness she found the wee
thing. It was Tur's. Tur loved it. For a moment she pressed the
soft cheek to her own, she strained the warm body close to her
breasts. Then&mdash;May God forgive her, for she was only a wild
thing goaded to desperation.</p>

<p>Dropping the pitiful bundle to the floor of the shelter Gron ran
back into the open. She was wild eyed and disheveled. Her long
black hair streamed about her face and across her shoulders. She
ran to the outskirts of the crowd that was watching the victim who
obstinately refused to gratify their appetite for human
suffering&mdash;Nu would not wince. Already the heat of the flames
must have caused him excruciating agony, yet not by the movement of
a muscle did he admit knowledge of either the surrounding fires or
the savage, eager spectators.</p>

<p>Gron watched him for a moment. His fate was to be hers when Tur
and Scarb discovered the deed she had committed, for a man-child
was a sacred thing.</p>

<p>And now there sprang to Gron's mind a recurrence of the thought
that the taunting female's words had implanted there earlier in the
evening. How could she compass this last stroke of revenge? It
seemed practically impossible. The stake was hemmed in upon all
sides by the clustering horde of eager tribesmen.</p>

<p>Gron turned and ran to the opposite side of the village, beyond
the shelters. There was no one there. Even the girls tending the
fires had deserted their posts to witness the last agonies of the
prisoner. Gron seized a leafy branch that lay among the firewood
that was to replenish the blaze. With it she beat out two of the
fires, leaving an open avenue into the enclosure through which
savage beasts might reasonably be expected to venture. Then she ran
back to the crowding ring of watchers.</p>

<p>As she approached them she cried out in apparently incoherent
terror. Those nearest her turned, startled by her shrieks.</p>

<p>"Zors!" she cried. "The fires have died and four of them have
entered the shelters where they are devouring the babes. On that
side," and she pointed to the opposite side of the enclosure.</p>

<p>Instantly the whole tribe rushed toward the ring of huts. First
the warriors, then the women and children. The victim at the stake
was deserted. Scarce was every back turned toward the prisoner than
Gron leaped through the fiery girdle to his side.</p>

<p>Nu saw the woman and recognized her. He saw the knife in her
hand. She had tried to kill him the previous night, and now she was
going to have her way. Well, it was better than the slow death by
fire.</p>

<p>But Gron's knife did not touch Nu. Instead it cut quickly
through the bullock sinews that bound him to the stake. As the last
strand parted the woman seized him by the hand.</p>

<p>"Come!" she cried. "Quick, before they return&mdash;there are no
Zors in the village."</p>

<p>Nu did not pause to question her, or her motives. For a few
steps he staggered drunkenly, for the bonds had stopped the
circulation in his arms and legs. But Gron, half-supporting,
half-dragging him, pulled him across the fires about the stake, on
past the outer circle of the beast-fires toward the Stygian
blackness that enveloped the beach toward the sea.</p>

<p>As Nu advanced the blood commenced to circulate once more
through the veins from which it had been choked, so that by the
time they came to the water he was almost in perfect command of his
muscles.</p>

<p>Here Gron led him to a dug-out.</p>

<p>"Quick!" she urged, as the two seized it to run it through the
surf. "They will soon be upon us and then we shall both die."</p>

<p>Already angry shouts were plainly distinguishable from the
village, and the firelight disclosed the tribe running hither and
thither about the fires that encircled the stake to which Nu had
been secured. The boat was through the surf and riding the waves
beyond. Gron had clambered in and Nu was taking his place in the
opposite end of the craft, when a new note arose from the village.
The savage shouting carried a different tone. Now there were battle
cries where before there had been but howls of rage. Even at the
distance at which they were Gron and Nu could see that a battle was
raging among the shelters of the Boat Builders. What could it
mean?</p>

<p>"They have fallen upon one another," said Gron. "And while they
fight let us hasten to put as great a distance between them and
ourselves as we can before the day returns."</p>

<p>But Nu was not so anxious to leave. He wanted to know more of
the cause of the battle. It was not within the bounds of reason
that the villagers could have set upon one another with such
apparent unanimity, and without any seeming provocation, and, too,
it appeared to Nu that there were more people in the village now
than there had been before he left it. What did all this mean? Why
it meant to the troglodyte that the village had been attacked by
enemies, and he wished to wait until he might discover the identity
of the invaders.</p>

<p>But Gron did not wish to wait. She seized her paddle and
commenced to ply it.</p>

<p>"Wait!" urged Nu, but the woman insisted that they must hasten
or be lost.</p>

<p>Even as they argued Gron suddenly leaned forward pointing toward
the beach.</p>

<p>"See!" she whispered. "They have discovered us. We are being
pursued."</p>

<p>Nu looked in the direction that she pointed, and, sure enough,
dimly through the night he described two forms racing toward the
beach. As he looked he saw them seize upon a boat and start
launching it, and then he knew that only in immediate flight lay
safety. He seized his paddle and in concert with Gron struck out
for the open sea.</p>

<p>"We can turn to one side presently and elude them," whispered
the woman.</p>

<p>Nu nodded.</p>

<p>"We will turn north toward my country," he said.</p>

<p>Gron did not demur. She might as well go north as south. Her
life was spent. There was to be no more happiness for her. Her
thoughts haunted the dim interior of a hide shelter where lay a
pathetic bundle upon a pile of fox and otter skins.</p>

<p>For a while both were silent, paddling out away from shore.
Behind them they now and then discerned the darker blotch of the
pursuing canoe upon the dark waters of the sea.</p>

<p>"Why did you save me?" asked Nu, at length.</p>

<p>"Because I hated Tur," replied the woman.</p>

<p>Nu fell silent, thinking. But he was not thinking of Gron. His
mind was filled with speculations as to the fate of Nat-ul. Whither
had she fled when she had escaped from the clutches of the Boat
Builders? Could she have reached the tribe in safety? Had she known
that it was Nu who had entered the shelter where she lay and
rescued her from Tur? He thought not, for had she known it he was
sure that she would have remained and fought with him.</p>

<p>Presently Gron interrupted his reveries. She was pointing over
the stern of the boat. There, not fifty yards away, Nu saw the
outlines of another craft with two paddlers within.</p>

<p>"Hasten!" whispered Gron. "They are overtaking us, and but for
my knife we are unarmed."</p>

<p>Nu bent to his paddle. On the boat wallowed toward the open sea.
There was no chance to elude the pursuers and turn north. First
they must put sufficient distance between them that the others
might not see which way they turned. But there seemed little
likelihood of their being able to accomplish this for, strive as
they would, they could not shake off the silent twain.</p>

<p>The darkest hours of the night were upon them&mdash;those that
precede dawn. They struggled to outdistance their pursuers. That
they were lengthening the distance between the two boats seemed
certain. In another few minutes they might risk the stratagem. But
they had scarcely more than turned when the surge of surf upon a
beach rose directly before them. Both were nonplused. What had
happened? Where were they? They had been moving straight out to sea
for some time, and yet there could be no mistaking that familiar
sound&mdash;land was directly ahead of them. To turn back now would
mean to run straight into the arms of their pursuers&mdash;which
neither had the slightest desire to do. Had Nu been armed he would
not have hesitated to grapple with the two occupants of the boat
that had clung so tenaciously to their wake, but with only the
woman's knife and a couple of wooden paddles it would have been a
fruitless thing to do.</p>

<p>Exerting all their strength the two drove the dug-out through
the surf until its nose ran upon the sand. Then they leaped out and
dragged the boat still further up beyond the reach of the mightiest
roller.</p>

<p>Where were they? Nu guessed a part of the truth. He reasoned
that they had fallen upon the same island from which he had seen
Nat-ul snatched by the Boat Builder, and from which he himself had
escaped so recently.</p>

<p>But he was not quite right. Their strenuous paddling during the
hours of darkness had carried them to the north of the nearer
island and beyond it. As a matter of fact they had been deposited
upon the southern coast of the largest island of the group which
lay several miles northeast of the one with which Nu had had
acquaintance.</p>

<p>But what mattered it? One was as bad as another. Both belonged
to the Mysterious Country. They were inhabited by hideous flying
reptiles, and legend held that frightful men dwelt upon them. And
Nu was without weapons of defense!</p>

<p>Who of us has not dreamed of going abroad upon the public
streets in scant attire or in no attire whatever? What painful
emotions we have suffered! Yet how insignificant our plight by
comparison with that of the primeval troglodyte thrown into a
strange country without his weapons&mdash;without even a knife!</p>

<p>Nu was lost, but far from hopeless. He did not turn to the woman
with the question: "What shall we do now?" If primeval man was
anything he was self-reliant. Heredity, environment and all of
Nature's mightiest laws combined to make him so. Otherwise he would
have perished off the face of the earth long before he had had an
opportunity to transmit his image to posterity&mdash;there would
have been no posterity for him. Some other form than ours would
have exhumed his bones from the drift of the ages and wondered upon
the structure and habits of the extinct monstrosity whose hind
limbs were so much longer than his fore limbs that locomotion must
have been a tiresome and painful process interrupted by many
disastrous tumbles upon the prehistoric countenance.</p>

<p>But Nu, the son of Nu, was not of a race doomed to extinction.
He knew when to fight and when to flee. At present there was
nothing to flee from, but a place of safe hiding must be their
first concern. He grasped Gron by the wrist.</p>

<p>"Come!" he said. "We must find a cave or a tree to preserve us
until the day comes again."</p>

<p>The woman cast a backward glance over her shoulder&mdash;a way
with women.</p>

<p>"Look!" she whispered, and pointed toward the surf.</p>

<p>Nu looked, and there upon the crest of a great wave, outlined
against the dark horizon, loomed a boat in which sat two figures,
plying paddles. One glance was enough. The pursuers were close upon
them. Nu, still holding Gron's wrist, started toward the black
shadows above the beach. The woman ran swiftly by his side.</p>

<p>Nu wondered not a little that the woman should thus flee her own
people to save him, a stranger and an enemy. Again he raised the
question that Gron had so illy answered.</p>

<p>"Why do you seek to save me," he asked, "from your own
people?"</p>

<p>"I do not seek to save you," replied the woman. "I wish to make
Tur mad&mdash;that is all. He will think I have run off to mate
with you. When he thinks that, you may die, for all that I care. I
hate you, but not quite so much as I hate Tur."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chb11" id="chb11">XI. &mdash; THE AUROCHS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">As Nu led Gron through the dark night amidst the
blackness of the tropical forest that clothed the gentle ascent
leading inland from the beach he grinned at the thought of Tur's
discomfiture, as well as the candor of his rescuer.</p>

<p>But now Nu was the protector. He might have left the woman to
shift for herself. She had made it quite plain that she had no love
for him&mdash;as plain as words could convey the idea: "I hate you,
but not quite so much as I hate Tur." But the idea of deserting
Gron never occurred to him. She was a woman. She had saved Nu's
life. Her motive was of negligible import.</p>

<p>In the darkness Nu found a large tree. He entered the lower
branches to reconnoiter. There were no dangerous foes lurking
there, so he reached down and assisted Gron to his side. There they
must make the best of it until daylight returned&mdash;it would
never do to roam through the woods unarmed at night longer than was
absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Nu was accustomed to sleeping in trees. His people often did so
when on the march, or when the quarry of the chase led them overfar
from their caves by day, necessitating the spending of the night
abroad; but Gron was not so familiar with life arboreal. She clung,
fearful, to the bole of the tree in a position that precluded
sleep.</p>

<p>Nu showed her how to compose herself upon a limb with her back
to the tree stem, but even then she was afraid of falling should
she chance to doze. At last Nu placed an arm about her to support
her, and thus she slept, her head pillowed upon the shoulder of her
enemy.</p>

<p>The sun was high when the sleepers awoke. Gron was the first to
open her eyes. For a moment she was bewildered by the strangeness
of her surroundings. Where was she? Upon what was her head
pillowed? She raised her eyes. They fell upon the sun-tanned,
regular features of the god-like Nu. Slowly recollection forced its
way through the misty pall of somnolence. She felt the arm of the
man about her, still firmly flexed in protective support.</p>

<p>This was her enemy&mdash;the enemy of her people. She looked at
Nu through new eyes. It was as though the awakening day had brought
an awakening of her soul. The man was undeniably beautiful&mdash;of
a masculine beauty that was all strength. Gron closed her eyes
again dreamily and let her head sink closer to the strong, brown
shoulder. But presently came entire wakefulness, and with it a full
return of actively functioning recollection. She saw the pitiful
bundle lying among the fox and otter skins upon the floor of the
distant shelter.</p>

<p>With a sudden intaking of her breath that was almost a scream,
Gron sat erect. The movement awakened Nu. He opened his eyes,
looked at the woman, and removing his arm from about her stood
upright upon the tree branch.</p>

<p>"First we must seek food and weapons," he said, "and then return
to the land that holds my country. Come."</p>

<p>His quick eyes had scanned the ground below. There were no
beasts of prey in sight. Nu lowered the woman to the base of the
tree, leaping lightly to her side. Fruits, growing in plenitude,
assuaged the keenest pangs of hunger. This accomplished, Nu led the
way inland toward higher ground where he might find growing the
harder wood necessary for a spear shaft. A fire-hardened point was
the best that he might hope for temporarily unless chance should
direct him upon a fragment of leek-green nephrite, or a piece of
flint.</p>

<p>Onward and upward toiled the searchers, but though they scaled
the low and rugged mountains that paralleled the coast they came
upon neither the straight hard wood that Nu sought, nor any sign of
the prized minerals from which he might fashion a spear head, an
ax, or a knife.</p>

<p>Down the further slopes of the mountains they made their way,
glimpsing at times through the break of a gorge a forest in a
valley far below. Toward this Nu bent his steps. There might grow
the wood he sought. At last they reached the last steep declivity,
a sheer drop of two hundred feet to the leveler slopes whereon the
forest grew almost to the base of the cliff.</p>

<p>For a moment the two stood gazing out over the unfamiliar
scene&mdash;a rather open woodland that seemed to fringe the
shoulder of a plateau, dropping from sight a mile or so beyond them
into an invisible valley above which hung a soft, warm haze. Far
beyond all this, dimly rose the outlines of far-off mountains,
their serrated crests seemingly floating upon the haze that
obscured their bases.</p>

<p>"Let us descend," said Nu, and started to lower his legs over
the edge of the precipice.</p>

<p>Gron drew back with a little exclamation of terror.</p>

<p>"You will fall!" she cried. "Let us search out an easier
way."</p>

<p>Nu looked up and laughed.</p>

<p>"What could be easier than this?" he asked.</p>

<p>Gron peered over the edge. She saw the face of a rocky wall,
broken here and there by protruding boulders, and again by narrow
ledges where a harder stratum had better withstood the ravages of
the elements. In occasional spots where lodgment had been afforded
lay accumulations of loose rock, ready to trip the unwary foot, and
below all a tumbled mass of jagged pieces waiting to receive the
bruised and mangled body of whomever might be so foolhardy as to
choose this way to the forest. Nu saw that Gron was but little
reassured by her inspection.</p>

<p>"Come!" he said. "There is no danger with me."</p>

<p>Gron looked at him, conscious of an admiration for his courage
and prowess&mdash;an admiration for an enemy that she would rather
not have felt. Yet she did feel the truth of his words: "There is
no danger-with me." She sat down upon the edge of the cliff,
letting her legs dangle over the abyss. Nu reached up and grasped
her arm, drawing her down to his side. How he clung there she could
not guess, but somehow, as he supported her in the descent, he
found hand-holds and stepping stones that made the path seem a
miracle of ease. Long before they reached the bottom Gron ceased to
be afraid and even found herself discovering ledges and
outcroppings that made the journey easier for them both. And when
they stood safely amid the clutter of debris at the base she threw
a glance of ill-concealed admiration upon her enemy. Mentally she
compared him with Tur and Scarb and the other males of the Boat
Builders, nor would the comparison have swelled the manly chests of
the latter could they have had knowledge of it.</p>

<p>"Those who follow us will stop here," she said, "nor do I see
any break in the cliff as far as my eye can travel," and she looked
to right and left along the rocky escarpment.</p>

<p>"I had forgotten that we might be followed," said Nu; "but when
we have found wherewith to fashion a spear and an ax, let them
come&mdash;Nu, the son of Nu, will welcome them."</p>

<p>From the base of the cliff they crossed the rubble and stepped
out into the grassy clearing that reached to the forest's edge.
They had crossed but halfway to the wood when they heard the
crashing of great bodies ahead of them, and as they paused the head
of a bull aurochs appeared among the trees before them. Another and
another came into sight, and as the animals saw the couple they
halted, the bulls bellowing, the cows peering wide-eyed across the
shaggy backs of their lords.</p>

<p>Here was meat and only the knife of the woman to bring it down.
Nu reached for Gron's weapon.</p>

<p>"Go back to the cliff," he said, "lest they charge. I will bring
down a young she."</p>

<p>Gron was about to turn back as Nu had bid her, and the man was
on the point of circling toward the right when there appeared on
either side of the aurochs several men. They were clothed in the
skins of the species they accompanied, and were armed with spears
and axes. At sight of Nu and Gron they raised a great shout and
dashed forward toward the two. Nu, unarmed, perceived the futility
of accepting battle. Instead he grasped Gron's hand and with her
fled back toward the cliffs. Close upon their heels came the
herders, shouting savage cries of carnage and victory. They had
their quarry cornered. The cliff would stop them, and then, with
their backs against the wall, the man would be quickly killed and
the woman captured.</p>

<p>But these were not cliff dwellers&mdash;they knew nothing of the
agility of Nu. Otherwise they would not have slowed up, as they
did, nor spread out to right and left for the purpose of preventing
a flank escape by the fugitives. Across the rubble ran Nu and Gron,
and at the foot of the cliff where they should have stopped,
according to the reasoning of the herders, they did not even
hesitate. Straight up the sheer wall sprang Nu, dragging the woman
after him. Now the aurochs herders raised a mighty shout of anger
and dismay. Who had ever seen such a thing! It was impossible, and
yet there before their very eyes they beheld a man, encumbered by a
woman, scaling the unscalable heights.</p>

<p>With renewed speed the herders dashed straight toward the foot
of the cliff, but Nu and Gron were beyond the reach of their hands
before ever they arrived. Turning for an instant, Nu saw they were
not yet out of reach of the weapons. He reached down with his right
hand and picked up a loose bit of rock, hurling it toward the
nearest spear-man. The missile struck its target full upon the
forehead, crumpling him to an inert mass.</p>

<p>Then Nu scrambled upward again, and before the herders could
recover from their surprise he had dragged Gron out of range of the
spears. Squatting upon a narrow ledge, the woman at his side, Nu
hurled insulting epithets at their pursuers. These he punctuated
with well-timed and equally well-aimed rocks, until the yelling
herders were glad to retreat to a safer distance.</p>

<p>The enemy did not even venture the attempt to follow the
fugitives. It was evident that they were no better climbers than
Gron. Nu held them in supreme contempt. Had he but a good ax he
would descend and annihilate the whole crew!</p>

<p>Gron, sitting close beside Nu, was filled with wonder and
something more than wonder that this enemy should have risked so
much to save her, for at the bottom of the cliff Nu had evidently
forgotten for the instant that the woman was not of his own breed,
able to climb equally as well as he, and had ascended a short
distance before he had discovered that Gron was scrambling futilely
for a foothold at the bottom. Then, in the face of the advancing
foemen, he had descended to her side, risking capture and death in
the act, and had hoisted her to a point of safety far up the cliff
face. Tur would never have done so much.</p>

<p>The woman, stealing stealthy glances at the profile of the young
giant beside her, felt her sentiments undergoing a strange
metamorphosis. Nu was no longer her enemy. He protected her, and
now she looked to him for protection with greater assurance of
receiving it than ever she had looked to Tur for the same thing.
She knew that Nu would forage for her&mdash;upon him she depended
for food as well as protection. She had never looked for more from
her mate. Her mate! She stole another half-shy glance at Nu. Ah,
what a mate he would have been! And why not? They were alone in the
world, separated from their people, doubtless forever. Gron
suddenly realized that she hoped that it was forever. She wondered
what was passing in Nu's mind.</p>

<p>Apparently the man was wholly occupied with the joys of
insulting the threatening savages beneath him; but yet his thoughts
were busy with plans for escape. And why? Solely because he yearned
for his own land and his father's people? Far from it. Nu might
have been happy upon this island forever had there been another
there in place of Gron. He thought of Nat-ul&mdash;no other woman
occupied his mind, and his plans for escape were solely a means for
returning to the mainland and again taking up his search for the
daughter of Tha.</p>

<p>For an hour the herders remained in the clearing near the foot
of the cliff, then, evidently tiring of the fruitless sport, they
collected their scattered herd and disappeared in the wood toward
the direction from which they had come. A half-hour later Nu
ventured down. He had discovered a cave in the face of the cliff
and there he left Gron, telling her that he would fetch food to
her, since in case of pursuit he could escape more easily alone
than when burdened with her.</p>

<p>After a short absence he returned with both food and drink, the
latter carried in the bladder that always hung from his gee-string.
He had seen nothing of the herders and naught of the hard wood or
the materials for spear and ax heads that he had desired.</p>

<p>"There is an easier way, however," he confided to the woman, as
they squatted at the mouth of the cave and ate. "The drivers of
aurochs bore spears and axes and knives. It will be easier to
follow them and take theirs than to make weapons of my own. Stay
here, Gron, in safety, and Nu will follow the strangers, returning
shortly with weapons and the flesh of the fattest of the she
aurochs. Then we will return to the coast, fearless of enemies,
find the boat and go back to Nu's country. There you will be well
received, for Nu, my father, is chief, and when he learns that you
have saved my life he will treat you well."</p>

<p>So Nu dropped quickly down to the foot of the cliff, crossed the
clearing, and a moment later disappeared from the eyes of Gron into
the shadows of the wood.</p>

<p>For a while he could make neither head nor tail to the tangled
spoor of the herd, but at last he found the point where the herders
evidently had collected their charges and driven them in a more or
less compact formation toward the opposite side of the forest. Nu
went warily, keeping every sense alert against surprise by savage
beast or man. Every living thing that he might encounter could be
nothing other than an enemy. He stopped often, listening and
sniffing the air. Twice he was compelled to take to the trees upon
the approach of wandering beasts of prey; but when they had passed
on Nu descended and resumed his trailing.</p>

<p>The trampled path of the herd led to the further edge of the
forest, and there Nu saw unfolded below him as beautiful a scene as
had ever broken upon his vision. The western sun hung low over a
broad valley that stretched below him, for the wood ended upon the
brow of a gentle slope that dropped downward to a blue lake
sparkling in the midst of green meadows a couple of miles away.</p>

<p>Upon the surface of the lake, apparently floating, were a score
or more strange structures. That they were man-built Nu was
certain, though he never had seen nor dreamed of their like. To
himself he thought of them as "caves," just as he had mentally
described the shelters of the Boat Builders, for to Nu any human
habitation was a "cave," and that they were the dwellings of men he
had no doubt since he could see human figures passing back and
forth along the narrow causeways that connected the thatched
structures with the shore of the lake. Across these long bridges
they were driving aurochs, too, evidently to pen them safely for
the night against the night prowlers of the forest and the
plain.</p>

<p>Until darkness settled Nu watched with unflagging interest the
activities of the floating village. Then in the comparative safety
of the darkness he crept down close to the water's edge. He took
advantage of every tree and bush, of every rock and hollow that
intervened between himself and the enemy to shelter and hide his
advance. At last he lay concealed in a heavy growth of reeds upon
the bank of the lake. By separating them before his eyes he could
obtain an excellent view of the village without himself being
discovered. The moon had risen, brilliantly flooding the unusual
scene. Now Nu saw that the dwellings did not really float upon the
surface. He discovered the ends of piles that disappeared beneath
the surface of the water. The habitations stood upon these. He saw
men and women and little children gathered upon the open platforms
that encircled many of the structures, and upon the narrow bridges
that spanned the water between the dwellings and the shore. Fires
burned before many of the huts, blazing upon little hearths of clay
that protected the planking beneath them from combustion. Nu could
smell the savory aroma of cooking fish, and his mouth watered as he
saw the teeth of the Lake Dwellers close upon juicy aurochs steaks,
while others opened shellfish and devoured their contents raw,
throwing the shells into the water below them.</p>

<p>But, hungry though he was for meat, the objects of his
particular desire were the long spear, the heavy ax and the sharp
knife of the hairy giant standing guard upon the nearest causeway.
Upon him Nu's eyes rested the oftenest. He saw the villagers, the
evening meal consumed and the scraps tossed into the water beneath
their dwellings, engaged in noisy gossip about their fires.
Children romped and tumbled perilously close to the edges of the
platforms. Youths and maidens strolled to the darker corners of the
village, and leaning over the low rails above the water conversed
in whispers. Loud voiced warriors recounted for the thousandth time
the details of past valorous deeds. The younger mothers, in little
circles, gossiped with much nodding of heads, the while they
suckled their babes. The old women, toothless and white-haired, but
still erect and agile in token of the rigid primitive laws which
governed the survival of the fit alone, busied themselves with the
care of the older children and various phases of the simple
household economy which devolved upon them.</p>

<p>The evening drew on into darkness. The children had been posted
off to their skin-covered, grass pallets. For another half-hour the
elders remained about the fires, then, by twos and threes, they
also sought the interiors of the huts, and sleep. Quiet settled
upon the village, and still Nu, hidden in the reeds beside the
lake, watched the nearest guardsman. Now and then the fellow would
leave his post to replenish a watch fire that blazed close to the
shore end of his causeway. Past this no ordinary beast of prey
would dare venture, nor could any do so without detection, for its
light illumined brightly the end of the narrow bridge.</p>

<p>Nu found himself wondering how he was to reach the sentry
unseen. To rush past the watch fire would have been madness, for
the guard then would have ample time to raise an alarm that would
call forth the entire population of the village before ever Nu
could reach the fellow's side.</p>

<p>There was the water, of course, but even there there was an
excellent chance of detection, since upon the mirrorlike surface of
the moonlit lake the swimmer would be all too apparent from the
village. A shadow fell directly along the side of the causeway.
Could he reach that he might make his way to a point near the
sentry and then clamber to close quarters before the man realized
that a foe was upon him. However, the chance was slight at best,
and so Nu waited hoping for some fortuitous circumstance to offer
him a happier solution of his problem.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact he rather shrank from the unknown dangers of
the strange waters in which might lurk countless creatures of
destruction; but there was that brewing close at hand that was to
force a decision quickly upon the troglodyte, leaving but an
immediate choice between two horns of a dilemma, one carrying a
known death and the other a precarious problematical fate.</p>

<p>It was Nu's quick ears that first detected the stealthy movement
in the reeds behind him, downwind, where his scent must have been
carrying tidings of his presence to whatever roamed abroad in that
locality. Now the passing of a great beast of prey upon its way
through the grasses or the jungle is almost noiseless, and more so
are his stealthy footfalls when he stalks his quarry. You or I
could not detect them with our dull ears amid the myriad sounds of
a primeval night&mdash;the coughing and the moaning of the great
cats punctuated by deafening roars, the lowing and bellowing and
grunting of the herds&mdash;the shrill scream of pain and terror as
a hunter lands upon the neck or rump of his prey&mdash;the hum of
insects&mdash;the hissing of reptiles&mdash;the rustling and
soughing of the night wind among the grasses and the trees. But
Nu's ears were not as ours. Not only had he been aware of the
passing and repassing of great beasts through the reeds behind him,
but, so quick his perceptive faculties, he immediately caught the
change from mere careless passage to that of stealthy stalking on
the part of the creature in his rear. The beast had caught his
scent and now, cautiously, he was moving straight toward the
watcher upon the shore.</p>

<p>Nu did not need the evidence of his eyes to picture the great
pads carefully raised and cautiously placed so that not a bent
grass might give out its faint alarm, the lowered and flattened
head, the forward tilted ears, the gentle undulations of the
swaying tail, lashing a little at the tufted tip. He saw it all,
realizing too all that it meant to him. There was no escape to
right or left, and before him lay the waters of the unknown lake.
He was all unarmed, and the mighty cat was now almost within its
leap.</p>

<p>Nu looked toward the sentry. The fellow had just returned from
replenishing his watch fire. He stood leaning over the railing
gazing into the water. What was that? Nu's eyes strained through
the darkness toward the platform where the warrior stood. Just
behind him was another figure. Ah! the figure of a woman.
Stealthily, with many a backward glance, she approached the
sentinel. There was a low word. The man turned, and at sight of the
figure so close beside him now he opened his arms and crushed the
woman to him.</p>

<p>Her face was buried on his shoulder, his head turned from Nu and
doubtless his eyes hidden in the red-brown hair that fell,
unconfined, almost to the woman's waist.</p>

<p>And then the great carnivore at Nu's back sprang.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chb12" id="chb12">XII. &mdash; TUR'S DECEPTION</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">In the instant that the beast leaped for him Nu
dove forward into the lake. The water was shallow, not over two or
three feet deep, but the cave man hugged the bottom, worming his
way to the left toward the shadows of the causeway. He knew that
the cat would not follow him into the lake&mdash;his greatest
danger now lay in the unknown denizens of the water. But, though
every instant he expected to feel a slimy body or sharp teeth, he
met with no attack. At last, his breath spent, he turned upon his
back, floating until his nose and mouth rose above the surface.
Filling his lungs with air he sank again and continued his way in
the direction of the piling. After what seemed an eternity to him
his hands came at last in contact with the rough surface of a pile.
Immediately he rose to the surface, and to his delight found that
he was beneath the causeway, safe from the eyes of the guardsman
and his companion.</p>

<p>Upon the bank behind him he could hear the angry complaining of
the baffled cat. He wondered if the noise of his escape had alarmed
the sentry to greater watchfulness. For long he listened for some
sign from above, and at last he caught the low tones of whispered
conversation. Good! they were still at their lovemaking, with never
a thought for the dangers lying close at hand.</p>

<p>Nu wished that they would be done. He dared not venture aloft
while the woman was there. For an hour he waited waist deep in
water, until finally he heard her retreating footsteps above him.
He gave her time to regain her dwelling, and then with the agility
of a cat he clambered up the slippery pile until his fingers closed
upon the edge of the flooring of the causeway. Cautiously he drew
himself up so that his eyes topped the upper surface of the
platform.</p>

<p>A dozen paces from him was the sentry moving slowly shoreward
toward the watchfire. The man's back was toward Nu, and he was
already between Nu and the shore. Nothing could have been
better.</p>

<p>The cave man crawled quickly to the platform, and with silent
feet ran lightly in the wake of the guard. The man was beside the
pile of wood with which he kept up the fire and was bending over to
gather up an armful when Nu overtook him. With the speed and
directness of a killing lion Nu leaped full upon his quarry's back.
Both hands sought the man's throat to shut off his cries for help,
and the teeth of the attacker buried themselves in the muscles
behind the collar bone that he might not easily be shaken from his
advantageous hold.</p>

<p>The sentry, taken entirely by surprise by this attack from the
rear, struggled to turn upon his foe. He tore at the fingers at his
throat that he might release them for the little instant that would
be sufficient for him to call for help; but the vise-like grip
would not loosen. Then the victim groped with his right hand for
his knife. Nu had been expecting this, and waiting for it.
Instantly his own right hand released its grip upon the other's
throat, and lightning-like followed the dagger hand in quest of the
coveted blade, so that Nu's fingers closed about those of the
sentry the instant that the latter gripped the handle of the
knife.</p>

<p>Now the blade flew from its sheath drawn by the power of two
hands, and then commenced a test of strength that was to decide the
outcome of the battle. The Lake Dweller sought to drive the knife
backward into the body of the man upon his back. Nu sought to force
the knife hand upward and outward. The blade was turned backward.
Nu did not attempt to alter this&mdash;it was as he would have it.
Slowly his mighty muscles prevailed over those of his antagonist,
and still his left hand choked off the other's voice. Upward,
slowly but surely, Nu carried the knife hand of his foe. Now it is
breast high, now to the other's shoulder, and all the time the
hairy giant is attempting to drive it back into the body of the
cave man.</p>

<p>At the instant that it rose level with the sentry's shoulder Nu
pushed the hand gradually toward the left until the blade hovered
directly over the heart of its owner. And then, quite suddenly, Nu
reversed the direction of his exertions, and like lightning the
blade, driven by the combined strength of both men, and guided by
Nu, plunged into the heart of the Lake Dweller.</p>

<p>Silently the man crumpled beneath the weight upon him. There was
a final struggle, and then he lay still. Nu did not wait longer
than to transfer all the coveted weapons from the corpse of his
antagonist to his own body, and then, silent and swift as a wraith,
he vanished into the darkness toward the forest and the heights
above the lake.</p>

<p>Gron, alone in the cave, sat buried in thought. Sometimes she
was goaded to despair by recollections of her lost babe, and again
she rose to heights of righteous anger at thoughts of the brutality
and injustice of Tur. Her fingers twitched to be at the brute's
throat. She compared him time and time again with Nu, and at each
comparison she realized more and more fully the intensity of her
new found passion for the stranger. She loved this alien warrior
with a fierceness that almost hurt. She relived again and again the
countless little episodes in which he had shown her a kindness and
consideration to which she was not accustomed. Among her own people
these things would have seemed a sign of weakness upon the part of
a man, but Gron knew that no taint of weakness lay behind that
noble exterior.</p>

<p>For long into the night she sat straining her eyes and ears
through the darkness for the first intimation of his return. At
last, when he had not come, she commenced to feel apprehension. He
had gone out unarmed through the savage land to wrest weapons from
the enemy. Already he might be dead, yet Gron could not believe
that aught could overcome that mighty physique.</p>

<p>Toward morning she became hopeless, and crawling within the cave
curled up upon the grasses that Nu had gathered for her, and slept.
It was several hours after dawn when she was awakened by a sound
from without&mdash;it was the scraping of a spear butt against the
rocky face of the cliff, as it trailed along in the wake of a
climbing man.</p>

<p>As Gron saw who it was that came she gave a little cry of joy,
braving the dangers of the perilous declivity to meet him. Nu
looked up with a smile, exhibiting his captured weapons as he came.
He noted the changed expression upon the woman's face&mdash;a smile
of welcome that rendered her countenance quite radiant. He had
never before taken the time to appraise Gron's personal appearance,
and now it was with a sense of surprise that was almost a shock
that he realized that the woman was both young and good-looking.
But this surprise was as nothing by comparison with that which
followed, for no sooner had Gron reached him than she threw both
arms about his neck, and before he realized her intent had dragged
his lips to hers.</p>

<p>Nu disengaged himself with a laugh. He did not love
Gron&mdash;his heart was wholly Nat-ul's, and his whole mind now
was occupied with plans for returning to his own country where he
might continue his search for her who was to have been his mate.
Still laughing, and with an arm about Gron to support her up the
steep cliff, he turned his steps toward the cave.</p>

<p>"I have brought a little food," he said, "and after I have slept
we will return to the sea. On the way I can hunt, for now I have
weapons, but in the meantime I must sleep, for I am exhausted.
While I sleep you must watch."</p>

<p>But once within the cave Gron, carried away by her new found
love, renewed her protestations of affection; but even with her
arms about him Nu saw only the lovely vision of another
face&mdash;his Nat-ul. Where was she?</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">When Nat-ul and Nu, the chief, discovered that the
son of Nu no longer was bound to the flame-girt stake in the
village of the Boat Builders they turned toward one another in
questioning surprise. The man examined the stake more closely.</p>

<p>"It is not burned," he said, "so, therefore, Nu could not have
been burned. And here," he pointed at the ground about the stake,
"look, here are the cords that bound him."</p>

<p>He picked one of them up, examining it.</p>

<p>"They have been cut! Some one came before us and liberated Nu,
the son of Nu."</p>

<p>"Who could it have been, and whither have they gone?" questioned
Nat-ul.</p>

<p>Nu shook his head. "I do not know, and now I may not stop to
learn, for my warriors are pursuing the strangers and I must be
with them," and Nu, the chief, leaped across the dying fires after
the yelling spearmen who chased the enemy toward the sea.</p>

<p>But Nat-ul was determined to let nothing stay her search for Nu,
the son of Nu. Scarcely had the young man's father left her than
she turned back toward the shelters. First she would search the
village, and if she did not find him there she would go out into
the jungle and along the beach&mdash;he could not be far. As Nat-ul
searched the shelters of the Boat Builders, a figure hid beneath a
pile of aurochs skins in one of them, stirred, uncovered an ear,
and listened. The sounds of conflict had retreated, the village
seemed deserted. An arm threw aside the coverings and a man sprang
quickly to his feet. It was Tur. Hard pressed by the savage
spearmen of the caves and surrounded, the man had crawled within a
hut and hidden himself beneath the skins.</p>

<p>Now he thought he saw a chance to escape while the enemy were
pursuing his people. He approached the entrance to the shelter and
peered out. Quickly he drew back&mdash;he had seen a figure
emerging from the next hut. It was a woman, and she was coming
toward the shelter in which he had concealed himself. The light of
the beast-fires played upon her. Tur drew in his breath in pleased
surprise&mdash;it was the woman he had once captured and who had
escaped him.</p>

<p>Nat-ul advanced rapidly to the shelter. She thought them all
deserted. As she entered this one she saw the figure of a man dimly
visible in the darkness of the interior. She thought it one of the
warriors of her own tribe, looting. Oftentimes they could not wait
for the total destruction of an enemy before searching greedily for
booty.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" she asked, and then, not waiting for an answer:
"I am searching for Nu, the son of Nu."</p>

<p>Tur saw his opportunity and was quick to grasp it.</p>

<p>"I know where he is," he said. "I am one of Scarb's people, but
I will lead you to Nu, the son of Nu, if you will promise that you
will protect me from your warriors when we return. My people have
fled, and I may never hope to reach them again unless you promise
to aid me."</p>

<p>Nat-ul thought this a natural and fair proposition, and was
quick to accept it.</p>

<p>"Then come," cried Tur. "There is no time to be lost. The man is
hidden in a cove south of here along the shore. He is fast bound
and so was left without a guard. If we hurry we may reach him
before my people regain him. If we can elude your warriors and the
delay that would follow their discovery of me we may yet be in
time."</p>

<p>Tur hurried from the shelter followed by Nat-ul. The man was
careful to keep his face averted from the girl while they traversed
the area lit by the camp and beast-fires, so he forged ahead
trusting to her desire to find her man to urge her after him. Nor
did he over-estimate the girl's anxiety to find Nu, the son of Nu.
Nat-ul followed swiftly upon Tur's heels through the deserted
village and across the beach from whence the sounds of conflict
rose beside the sea.</p>

<p>Tur kept to the north of the fighters, going to a spot upon the
beach where he had left his own boat. He found the craft without
difficulty, pushed it into the water, lifted Nat-ul into it, and
shoved it through the surf. To Tur the work required but a
moment&mdash;he was as much at home in the boiling surf as upon dry
land.</p>

<p>Seated in the stern with Nat-ul facing him in the bow he forced
the dug-out beyond the grip of the rollers. Nat-ul took up a second
paddle that lay at her feet, plying it awkwardly perhaps, but not
without good effect. She could scarce wait until the boat reached
the cove, and every effort of her own added so much to the speed of
the craft.</p>

<p>Tur kept the boat's head toward the open sea. It was his purpose
to turn toward the south after they were well out, and, moving
slowly during the night, await the breaking dawn to disclose the
whereabouts of his fellows. That they, too, would paddle slowly
southward he was sure.</p>

<p>Presently he caught sight of the outline of a boat just ahead.
Probably beyond that were others. He had been fortunate to stumble
upon the last boat-load of his fleeing tribe. He did not hail them
for two reasons. One was that he did not wish the girl to know that
he was not bearing her south toward the cove&mdash;the imaginary
location of her man; and the other was due to the danger of
attracting the attention of the enemy who might have captured some
of the boats and be carrying the pursuit out upon the sea.</p>

<p>Presently a third possibility kept him quiet&mdash;the boat
ahead might contain warriors of the enemy searching for fugitives.
Tur did not know that the tribe of Nu was entirely unfamiliar with
navigation&mdash;that never before had they dreamed of such a thing
as a boat.</p>

<p>So Tur followed the boat ahead in silence straight out to sea.
To Nat-ul it seemed that the cove must be a long distance away. In
the darkness she did not perceive that they were traveling directly
away from shore. After a long time she heard the pounding of surf
to the left of the boat. She was startled and confused. Traveling
south, as she supposed they had been doing, the surf should have
been off the right side of the boat.</p>

<p>"Where are we?" she asked. "There is land upon the left, whereas
it should be upon the right."</p>

<p>Tur laughed.</p>

<p>"We must be lost," he said; but Nat-ul knew now that she had
been deceived. At the same instant there came over her a sudden
sense of familiarity in the voice of her companion. Where had she
heard it before? She strove to pierce the darkness that shrouded
the features of the man at the opposite end of the boat.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" she asked. "Where are you taking me?"</p>

<p>"You will soon be with your man," replied Tur, but there was an
ill-concealed note of gloating that did not escape Nat-ul.</p>

<p>The girl now remained silent. She no longer paddled, but sat
listening to the booming of the surf which she realized that they
were approaching. What shore was it? Her mind was working rapidly.
She was accustomed to depending largely on a well-developed
instinct for locality and direction upon land, and while it did not
aid her much upon the water it at least preserved her from the
hopeless bewilderment that besets the average modern when once he
loses his bearings, preventing any semblance of rational thought in
the establishment of his whereabouts. Nat-ul knew that they had not
turned toward the north once after they had left the shore, and so
she knew that the mainland could not be upon their left. Therefore
the surf upon that hand must be breaking upon the shore of one of
the islands that she only too well knew lay off the mainland. Which
of the islands they were approaching she could not guess, but any
one of them was sufficiently horrible in her estimation.</p>

<p>Nat-ul planned quickly against the emergency which confronted
her. She knew, or thought, that the man had brought her here where
she would be utterly helpless in his power. Her people could not
follow them. There would be none to succor or avenge.</p>

<p>Tur was wielding his paddle rapidly and vigorously now. He shot
the boat just ahead of an enormous roller that presently caught and
lifted it upon its crest carrying it swiftly up the beach. As the
keel touched the sand Tur leaped out and dragged the craft as far
up as he could while the wave receded to the ocean.</p>

<p>Nat-ul stepped out upon the beach. In her hand she still held
the paddle. Tur came toward her. He was quite close, so close that
even in the darkness of the night she saw his features, and
recognized them. He reached toward her arm to seize her.</p>

<p>"Come," he said. "Come to your mate."</p>

<p>Like a flash the crude, heavy paddle flew back over Nat-ul's
shoulder, cleaving the air downward toward the man's head. Tur,
realizing his danger, leaped back, but the point of the blade
struck his forehead a glancing blow. The man reeled drunkenly for a
second, stumbled forward and fell full upon his face on the wet
sand. The instant that the blade touched her tormentor Nat-ul
dropped the paddle, dodged past the man, and scurried like a
frightened deer toward the black shadows of the jungle above the
beach.</p>

<p>The next great roller washed in across the prostrate form of
Tur. It rolled him over, and as it raced back toward the sea it
dragged him with it; but the water revived him, and he came
coughing and struggling to his hands and knees, clinging
desperately to life until the waters receded, leaving him in
momentary safety. Slowly he staggered to his feet and made his way
up the beach beyond the reach of the greedy seas.</p>

<p>His head hurt him terribly. Blood trickled down his cheek and
clotted upon his hairy breast. And he was mad with rage and the
lust for vengeance. Could he have laid his hands upon Nat-ul then
she would have died beneath his choking fingers. But he did not lay
hands upon her, for Nat-ul was already safely ensconced in a tree
just within the shadows of the jungle. Until daylight she was as
safe there from Tur as though a thousand miles separated them. A
half-hour later Nu and Gron, a mile further inland, were clambering
into another tree. Ah, if Nat-ul could but have known it, what
doubt, despair and suffering she might have been spared.</p>

<p>Tur ran down the beach in the direction in which he thought that
he heard the sound of the fleeing Nat-ul. Yes, there she was! Tur
redoubled his speed. His quarry was just beneath a tree at the edge
of the jungle. The man leaped forward with an exclamation of savage
satisfaction&mdash;that died upon his lips, frozen by the horrid
roar of a lion. Tur turned and fled. The thing he had thought was
Nat-ul proved to be a huge cave lion standing over the corpse of
its kill. Fortunate for Tur was it that the beast already had its
supper before it. It did not pursue the frightened man, and so Tur
reached the safety of a nearby tree, where he crouched, shaking and
trembling, throughout the balance of the night. Tur was a boat
builder and a fisherman&mdash;he was not of the stock of Nu and
Nat-ul&mdash;the hunters of savage beasts, the precursors of
warrior nations yet unborn.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chb13" id="chb13">XIII. &mdash; NAT-UL IS
HEART-BROKEN</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">It was late in the morning when Nat-ul awoke. She
peered through the foliage in every direction but could see no sign
of Tur. Cautiously she descended to the ground. Upon the beach, not
far separated, she saw two boats. To whom could the other belong?
Naturally, to some of the Boat Builders. Then there were other
enemies upon the island beside Tur. She looked up and down the
beach. There was no sign of man or beast. If she could but reach
the boats she could push them both through the surf, and, someway,
dragging one, paddle the other away from the island. This would
leave no means of pursuit to her enemies. That she could reach the
mainland she had not the slightest doubt, so self-reliant had
heredity and environment made her.</p>

<p>Again she glanced up and down the beach. Then she raced swiftly
toward the nearest boat. She tugged and pushed upon the heavy
thing, until at last, after what seemed to her anxious mind many
minutes she felt it slipping loose from its moorings of sand.
Slowly, inch by inch, she was forcing it toward the point where the
rollers would at last reach and float it. She had almost gained
success with this first boat when something impelled her to glance
up. Instantly her dream of escape faded, for from up the beach she
saw Tur running swiftly toward her. Even could she have managed to
launch this one boat and enter it, Tur easily could overtake her in
the other. The water was his element&mdash;hers was the land, the
caves and the jungles.</p>

<p>Abandoning her efforts with the boat she turned and fled back
toward the jungle. A couple of hundred yards behind her raced Tur,
but the girl knew that once she reached the tangled vegetation of
the forest it would take a better man than Tur to catch her.
Straight into the mazes of the wood she plunged, sometimes keeping
to the ground and again running through the lower branches of the
trees.</p>

<p>All day she fled scarce halting for food or drink, for several
times from the elevation of the foothills and the mountains that
she traversed after leaving the jungle she saw the man sticking to
her trail. It was dark when she came at last to a precipitous gulf,
dropping how far she could not guess. Below and as far as her eyes
could reach all was impenetrable darkness. About her, beasts
wandered restlessly in search of prey. She caught their scent and
heard their dismal moaning, or the thunder of their titanic
roaring.</p>

<p>That the cliff upon the verge of which she had halted just in
time to avert a plunge into its unknown depths was a high one she
was sure from the volume of night noises that came up to her from
below, mellowed by distance. What should she do? The summit of the
escarpment was nude of trees insofar as she could judge in the
darkness, at least she had not recently passed through any sort of
forest.</p>

<p>To sleep in the open would be dangerous in the extreme, probably
fatal. To risk the descent of an unknown precipice at night might
prove equally as calamitous. Nat-ul crouched upon the brink of the
abyss at a loss as to her future steps. She was alone, a woman,
practically unarmed, in a strange and savage land. Hope that she
might ever return to her own people seemed futile. How, indeed,
could she accomplish it, followed by enemies and surrounded by
unknown dangers.</p>

<p>She was very hungry and thirsty and sleepy. She would have given
almost her last chance for succor to have lain down and slept. She
would risk it. Drawing her shaggy robe about her, Nat-ul stretched
herself upon the hard earth at the top of the precipice. She closed
her eyes, and sleep would have instantly claimed her had not a
stealthy noise not a dozen yards behind her caused her to come to
startled wakefulness. Something was creeping upon her&mdash;death,
in some form, she was positive. Even now she heard the heavy
breathing of a large animal, and although the wind was blowing
between them she caught the pungent odor of a great cat.</p>

<p>There was but a single alternative to remaining and surrendering
herself to the claws and fangs of the carnivore, nor did Nat-ul
hesitate in accepting it. With the speed of a swift she lowered
herself over the edge of the cliff, her feet dangling in space.
Rapidly, and yet without panic, she groped with her feet for a hold
upon the rocky surface below her.</p>

<p>There seemed nothing, not the slightest protuberance that would
give her a chance to lower herself from the clutches of the beast
that she knew must be sneaking cautiously toward her from above. A
sudden chill of horror swept over her as she felt hot breath and
the drip of saliva upon her hands where they clung to the edge of
the cliff above.</p>

<p>A low growl came from above. Evidently the beast was puzzled by
the strange position of its quarry, but in another moment it would
seize her wrists or, reaching down, bury its talons in her head or
back. And just then her fingers slipped from their hold and Nat-ul
dropped into the darkness.</p>

<p>That she fell but a couple of feet did not detract an iota from
the fright she endured in the instant that her handhold gave way,
but the relief of feeling a narrow ledge beneath her feet quickly
overcame her terror. That the beast might follow her she had little
fear. There might be a ledge running down to this point, and then
again there might not. All she could do was stay where she was and
hope for the best, and so she settled herself as securely as she
might to await what the immediate future might hold for her. She
heard the beast growling angrily as it paced along the brow of the
cliff above her, now stopping occasionally to lower its nose over
the edge and sniff at her, and again reaching down a mighty paw
whose great talons clawed desperately to seize her, sweeping but a
few inches above her head.</p>

<p>For an hour or more this lasted until the hungry cat, baffled
and disgruntled, wandered away into the jungle in search of other
prey, voicing his anger as he went in deep-throated roars.</p>

<p>Nat-ul felt along the ledge to right and left with her fingers.
The surface of the rock was weather-worn but not polished as would
have been true were the ledge the accustomed pathway of padded
feet. The girl felt a sense of relief in this discovery&mdash;at
least she was not upon the well-beaten trail leading to the lair of
some wild beast, or connecting the cliff top with the valley
below.</p>

<p>Slowly and cautiously she wormed her way along the ledge,
searching for a wider and more comfortable projection, but the
ledge only narrowed as she proceeded. Having ventured thus far the
girl decided to prosecute her search until she discovered a spot
where she might sleep in comparative safety and comfort. As no such
place seemed to exist at the level at which she was, she determined
to descend a way. She lowered her feet over the ledge, groping with
her sandaled toes along the rough surface below her. Finally she
found a safe projection to which she descended. For half an hour
Nat-ul searched through the pitch black night upon the steep cliff
face until accident led her groping feet to the mouth of a
cave&mdash;a darker blot upon the darkness of the cliff. For a
moment she listened attentively at the somber opening. No sound of
breathing within came to her keen ears. Satisfied that the cave was
untenanted Nat-ul crawled boldly in and lay down to
sleep&mdash;exhausted by her long day of flight.</p>

<p>A scraping sound upon the cliff face awakened Nat-ul. She raised
herself upon an elbow and listened attentively. What was it that
could make that particular noise? It did not require but an instant
for her to recognize it&mdash;a sound familiar since infancy to the
cliff dweller. It was the trailing of the butt of a spear as it
dangled from its rawhide thong down the back of a climbing warrior.
Now it scraped along a comparatively smooth surface, now it bumped
and pounded over a series of projections. What new menace did it
spell?</p>

<p>Nat-ul crawled cautiously to the opening of the cave. Here she
could obtain a view of the cliff to the right, but the climber she
could not see&mdash;he was below the projecting ledge that ran
before the threshold of her cavern. As she looked Nat-ul was
startled to see a woman emerge from a cave a trifle above her and
fifty feet, perhaps, to her right. The watcher drew back, lest she
be discovered. She heard the stranger's cry of delight as she
sighted the climber below. She saw her clamber down to meet the
newcomer. She saw the man an instant later as he clambered to the
level of her ledge. Her heart gave a throb of happiness&mdash;her
lips formed a beloved name, but her happiness was short-lived, the
name died ere ever it was uttered. The man was Nu, the son of Nu,
and the woman who met him threw her arms about his neck and covered
his lips with kisses. It was Gron. Nat-ul recognized her now. Then
she shrank back from the sight, covering her eyes with her hands,
while hot tears trickled between her slim, brown fingers. She did
not see Nu's easy and indifferent laugh as he slipped Gron's arms
from about his neck. Fate was unkind, hiding this and unsealing
Nat-ul's eyes again only in time to show the distracted girl a
momentary glance of her lover disappearing into Gron's cave with an
arm about the woman's waist.</p>

<p>Nat-ul sprang to her feet. Tears of rage, jealousy and
mortification blinded her eyes. She seized the knife that lay in
her girdle. Murder flamed hot in her wild, young heart as she
stepped boldly out upon the ledge. She took a few hurried steps in
the direction of the cave which held Nu and Gron. To the very
threshold she went, and then, of a sudden, she paused. Some new
emotion seized her. A flood of hot tears welled once more to her
eyes&mdash;tears of anguish and hurt love this time.</p>

<p>She tried to force herself within the cave, but pride held her
back. Then sorrowfully she turned away and descended the cliff
face. As she went her speed increased until by the time she reached
the level before the forest she was flying like a deer from the
scene of her greatest sorrow. On through the woods she ran,
heedless of every menace that might lurk within its wild shadows.
Beyond the wood she came upon a little plain that seemed to end at
the edge of a declivity some distance ahead of her. Beyond, in the
far distance she could see the tops of mountains rising through a
mist that floated over an intervening valley.</p>

<p>She would keep on. She cared not what lay ahead, only that at
each step she was putting a greater distance between herself and
the faithless Nu, the hateful Gron. That was all that
counted&mdash;to get away where none might ever find her&mdash;to
court death&mdash;to welcome the end that one need never seek for
long in that savage, primeval world.</p>

<p>She had crossed half the clearing, perhaps, when the head of a
bull aurochs appeared topping the crest of the gulf ahead. The
brute paused to look at the woman. He lowered his head and
bellowed. Directly behind him appeared another and another.
Ordinarily the aurochs was a harmless beast, fighting only when
forced to it in self-defense; but an occasional bull there was that
developed bellicose tendencies that made discretion upon the side
of an unarmed human the better part of valor. Nat-ul paused,
measuring the distance between herself and the bull and herself and
the nearest tree.</p>

<p>While Nat-ul, torn by anguish, fled the cliff that sheltered Nu,
the man, within the cave with Gron, again disengaged the fingers of
the woman from about his neck.</p>

<p>"Cease thy love-making, Gron," he said. "There may be no love
between us. In the tribe of Nu, my father, a man takes but one
mate. I would take Nat-ul, the daughter of Tha. You are already
mated to Tur. You have told me this, and I have seen his child
suckling your breast. I love only Nat-ul&mdash;you should love only
Tur."</p>

<p>The woman interrupted him with an angry stamp of her sandaled
foot.</p>

<p>"I hate him," she cried. "I hate him. I love only Nu, the son of
Nu."</p>

<p>The man shook his head, and when he spoke it was still in a
kindly voice, for he felt only sorrow for the unhappy woman.</p>

<p>"It is useless, Gron," he said, "for us to speak further upon
this matter. Together we must remain until we have come back to our
own countries. But there must be no love, nor more words of love
between us. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>The woman looked at him for a moment. What the emotion that
stirred her heart her face did not betray. It might have been the
anger of a woman scorned, or the sorrow of a breaking heart. She
took a step toward him, paused, and then throwing her arms before
her face, turned and sank to the floor of the cave, sobbing.</p>

<p>Nu turned away and stepped out upon the ledge before the cave.
His quick eyes scanned the panorama spread out before him in a
single glance. They stopped instantly upon a tiny figure showing
across the forest in the little plain that ran to the edge of the
plateau before it dove into the valley beside the inland sea. It
was the figure of a woman. She was running swiftly toward the
declivity. Nu puckered his brows. There was something familiar
about the graceful swing of the tiny figure, the twinkling of the
little feet as they raced across the grassy plain. Who could it be?
What member of his tribe could have come to this distant island? It
was but an accidental similarity, of course; but yet how wildly his
heart beat at the sight of that distant figure! Could it be? By any
remote possibility could Nat-ul have reached this strange
country?</p>

<p>Coming over the edge of the plateau from the valley beyond, Nu
saw the leaders of a herd of aurochs. Behind these must be the
herders. Will the girl be able to escape them? Ah, she has seen the
beasts&mdash;she has stopped and is looking about for a tree, Nu
reasoned, for women are ofttimes afraid of these shaggy bulls. He
remembered, with pride, that his Nat-ul feared little or nothing
upon the face of the earth. She was cautious, of course, else she
would not have survived a fortnight. Feared nothing! Nu smiled.
There were two things that filled Nat-ul with terror&mdash;mice and
earthquakes.</p>

<p>Now Nu sees the first of the herders upon the flanks of the
herd. They are hurrying forward, spears ready, to ascertain what it
is that has brought the leaders to a halt&mdash;what is causing the
old king-bull to bellow and paw the earth. Will the girl see them?
Can she escape them? They see her now, and at the same instant it
is evident that she sees them. Is she of their people? If so, she
will hasten toward them. No! She has turned and is running swiftly
back toward the forest. The herders spring into swift pursuit. Nu
trembled in excitement. If he only knew. If he only knew!</p>

<p>At his shoulder stood Gron. He had not been aware of her
presence. The woman's eyes strained across the distance to the
little figure racing over the clearing toward the forest. Her hands
were tightly clenched against her breast. She too, had been struck
with the same fear that haunted Nu. Perhaps she had received the
idea telepathically from the man.</p>

<p>The watchers saw the herders overtake the fugitive, seize her
and drag her back toward the edge of the plateau. The herd was
turned back and a moment later all disappeared over the brink. Nu
wavered in indecision. He knew that the captive could not be
Nat-ul, and yet something urged him on to her succor. They were
taking her back to the Lake Dwellings! Should he follow? It would
be foolish&mdash;and yet suppose that it should be Nat-ul. Without
a backward glance the man started down the cliff-face. The woman
behind him, reading his intention plainly, took a step after him,
her arms outstretched toward him.</p>

<p>"Nu!" she cried. Her voice was low and pleading. The man did not
turn. He had no ears, no thoughts beyond the fear and hope that
followed the lithe figure of the captive girl into the hidden
valley toward the distant lake.</p>

<p>Gron threw out her arms toward him in a gesture of supplication.
For a moment she stood thus, motionless. Nu continued his descent
of the cliff. He reached the bottom and started off at a rapid trot
toward the forest. Gron clapped her open palm across her eyes, and,
turning, staggered back to the ledge before the cave, where, with a
stifled moan she sank to her knees and slipped prone upon the
narrow platform.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chb14" id="chb14">XIV. &mdash; "I HAVE COME TO SAVE
YOU"</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Nu reached the edge of the plateau in time to see
the herders and their captive arrive at the dwellings on the lake.
He saw the crowds of excited natives that ran out to meet them. He
saw the captive pulled and hauled hither and thither. The herders
pointed often toward the plateau behind them. It was evident that
Nu's assault upon the sentry of the previous night taken with the
capture of this stranger and the appearance of Nu and Gron upon the
cliff the day before had filled the villagers with fear of an
invasion from the south. This only could account for the early
return of the herders with their aurochs.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of what cover the descent to the valley
afforded and the bushes and trees that dotted the valley itself, Nu
crept cautiously onward toward the lake. He was determined to
discover the identity of the prisoner, though even yet he could not
believe that she was Nat-ul. A mile from the shore he was compelled
to hide until dark, for there was less shelter thereafter and, too,
there were many of the natives moving to and fro, having their
herds browsing in the bottom lands close to their dwellings.</p>

<p>When it was sufficiently dark Nu crept closer. Again he hid in
the reeds, but this time much closer to one of the causeways. He
wished that he knew in precisely which of the dwellings the captive
was confined. He knew that it would be madness to attempt to search
the entire village, and yet he saw no other way.</p>

<p>At last the villagers had retired, with the exception of the
sentries that guarded the narrow bridges connecting the dwellings
with the shore. Nu crept silently beneath the nearest causeway.
Wading through the shallow water he made his way to a point beyond
the sentinel's post. Then he crossed beneath the dwelling until he
had come to the opposite side. Here the water was almost to his
neck. He climbed slowly up one of the piles. Stopping often to
listen, he came at last to a height which enabled him to grasp the
edge of the flooring above with the fingers of one hand. Then he
drew himself up until his eyes topped the platform. Utter silence
reigned about him&mdash;utter silence and complete darkness. He
raised himself, grasping the railing, until one knee rested upon
the flooring, then he drew himself up, threw a leg over the railing
and was crouching close in the shadows against the wall.</p>

<p>Here he listened intently for several minutes. From within came
the sound of the heavy breathing of many sleepers. Above his head
was an opening&mdash;a window. Nu raised himself until he could
peer within. All was darkness. He sniffed in the vain hope of
detecting the familiar scent of Nat-ul, but if she were there all
sign of her must have been submerged in the sweaty exhalations from
the close packed men, women and children and the strong stench of
the ill-cured aurochs hides upon which they slept.</p>

<p>There was but one way to assure himself definitely&mdash;he must
enter the dwelling. With the stealth of a cat he crawled through
the small aperture. The floor was almost covered with sleepers.
Among them, and over them Nu picked his careful way. He bent low
toward each one using his sensitive nostrils in the blind search
where his eyes were of no avail. He had crossed the room and
assured himself that Nat-ul was not there when a man appeared in
the doorway. It was the sentry. Nu flattened himself against the
wall not two yards from the door. What had called the fellow
within? Had he been alarmed by the movement within the hut? Nu
waited with ready knife. The man stepped just within the
doorway.</p>

<p>"Throk!" he called. One of the sleepers stirred and sat up.</p>

<p>"Huh?" grunted he.</p>

<p>"Come and watch&mdash;it is your turn," replied the sentry.</p>

<p>"Ugh," replied the sleepy one, and the sentry turned and left
the hut.</p>

<p>Nu could hear him who had been called Throk rising and
collecting his weapons, donning his sandals, straightening and
tightening his loin cloth. He was making ready for his turn at
sentry duty. As he listened a bold scheme flashed into Nu's mind.
He grasped his knife more tightly, and of a sudden stepped boldly
across the room toward Throk.</p>

<p>"Sh!" he whispered. "I will stand watch in your place tonight,
Throk."</p>

<p>"Huh?" questioned the sleepy man.</p>

<p>"I will stand watch for you," repeated Nu "I would meet&mdash;"
and he mumbled a name that might have been anything, "she said that
she would come to me tonight during the second watch."</p>

<p>Nu could hear the man chuckle.</p>

<p>"Give me your robe," said Nu, "that all may think that it is
you," and he reached his hand for the horn crowned aurochs
skin.</p>

<p>Throk passed it over, only too glad to drop back again into the
slumber that his fellow had disturbed. Nu drew the bull's head over
his own, the muzzle projecting like a visor, and the whole sitting
low upon his head threw his features into shadow. Nu stepped out
upon the platform. The other sentry was standing impatiently
waiting his coming, at sight of him the fellow turned and walked
toward one of the dwellings that stretched further into the lake.
There were seven in all that were joined to the shore by this
single causeway&mdash;Nu had entered the one nearest the land.</p>

<p>In which was the prisoner, and was she even in any of this
particular collection of dwellings? It was equally possible that
she might be in one of the others of which Nu had counted not less
than ten stretching along the shore of the lake for at least a mile
or more. But he was sure that they had first brought her to one of
the dwellings of this unit&mdash;he had seen them cross the
causeway with her. Whether they had removed her to some other
village later, he could not know. If there was only some way to
learn definitely. He thought of the accommodating and sleepy
Throk&mdash;would he dare venture another assault upon the
junk-head's credulity. Nu shrugged. The chances were more than even
that he would not find the girl before dawn without help and that,
whether he did or not, he never would escape from the village with
his life. What was life anyway, but a series of chances, great and
small. He had taken chances before&mdash;well, he would take this
one.</p>

<p>He reentered the dwelling and walked noisily to Throk's side.
Stooping he shook the man by the shoulder. Throk opened his
eyes.</p>

<p>"In which place is the prisoner?" asked Nu. He had come near to
saying cave, but he had heard Gron speak of the hide and thatch
things which protected them from the rains by another name than
cave, and so he was bright enough to guess that he might betray
himself if he used the word here. For the most part his language
and the language of the Lake Dwellers was identical, and so he used
a word which meant, roughly, in exactly what spot was the captive
secured.</p>

<p>"In the last one, of course," grumbled the sleepy Throk.</p>

<p>Nu did not dare question him further. The last one might mean
the last of this unit of dwellings or it might mean that she was in
the last village, and Nu did not know which the last village might
be, whether north or south of the village where he was. Already he
could feel the eyes of the man searching through the darkness
toward him. Nu rose and turned toward the doorway. Had the fellow's
suspicions been aroused&mdash;had Nu gone too far?</p>

<p>Throk sat upright upon his hides watching the retreating
figure&mdash;in his dense mind questions were revolving. Who was
this man? Of course he must know him, but somehow he could not
place his voice. Why had he asked where the captive was imprisoned?
Everyone in all the villages knew that well enough. Throk became
uneasy. He did not like the looks of things. He started to rise.
Ugh! how sleepy he was. What was the use, anyway? It was all right,
of course. He lay back again upon his aurochs skins.</p>

<p>Outside Nu walked to the shore and replenished the beast-fire.
Then he turned back up the causeway. Quickly he continued along the
platforms past the several dwellings until he had come to the last
of the seven. At the doorway he paused and listened, at the same
time sniffing quietly. A sudden tremor ran through his giant frame;
his heart, throbbing wildly, leaped to his throat&mdash;Nat-ul was
within!</p>

<p>He crossed the threshold&mdash;the building was a small one. No
other scent of human being had mingled with that of Nat-ul. She
must be alone. Nu groped through the darkness, feeling with his
hands in the air before him and his sandaled feet upon the floor.
His delicate nostrils guided him too, and at last he came upon her,
lying tightly bound to an upright at the far end of the room.</p>

<p>He bent low over her. She was asleep. He laid a hand upon her
shoulder and as he felt her stir he placed his other palm across
her lips and bending his mouth close to her ear whispered that she
must make no outcry.</p>

<p>Nat-ul opened her eyes and stirred.</p>

<p>"S-sh," cautioned Nu. "It is I, Nu, the son of Nu." He removed
his hand from her lips and raised her to a sitting posture,
kneeling at her side. He put his arms about her, a word of
endearment on his lips; but she pushed him away.</p>

<p>"What do you here?" she asked, coldly.</p>

<p>Nu was stunned with the surprise of it.</p>

<p>"I have come to save you," he whispered; "to take you back to
the cliffs beside the Restless Sea, where our people dwell."</p>

<p>"Go away!" replied Nat-ul. "Go back to your woman."</p>

<p>"Nat-ul!" exclaimed Nu. "What has happened? What has changed
you? Has the sickness come upon you, because of what you have
endured&mdash;the sickness that changes the mind of its victim into
the mind of one of the ape-folk? There is no woman for Nu but
Nat-ul, the daughter of Tha."</p>

<p>"There is the stranger woman, Gron," cried Nat-ul, bitterly. "I
saw her in your arms&mdash;I saw your lips meet, and then I ran
away. Go back to her. I wish to die."</p>

<p>Nu sought her hand, holding it tight.</p>

<p>"You saw what you saw, Nat-ul," he said; "but you did not hear
when I told Gron that I loved only you. You did not see me
disengage her arms. Then I saw you far away, and the herders come
and take you, and I did not even cast another look upon the
stranger woman; but hurried after your captors, hiding close by
until darkness came. That I am here, Nat-ul, should prove my love,
if ever you could have doubted it. Oh, Nat-ul, Nat-ul, how could
you doubt the love of Nu!"</p>

<p>The girl read as much in his manner as his words that he spoke
the truth, and even had he lied she would surely have believed him,
so great was her wish to hear the very words he spoke. She dropped
her cheek to his hand with a little sigh of relief and happiness,
and then he took her in his arms. But only a moment could they
spare to sentiment&mdash;stern necessity called upon them for
action, immediate and swift. How urgent was the call Nu would have
guessed could he have looked into the hut where Throk lay upon his
aurochs skins, wide-eyed.</p>

<p>The man's muddy brain revolved many times the details of the
coming of the fellow who had just asked the whereabouts of the
prisoner. It was all quite strange, and the more that Throk thought
upon it the more fully awake he became and the better able to
realize that there had been something altogether too unusual and
mysterious in the odd request and actions of the stranger.</p>

<p>Throk sat up. He had suddenly realized what would befall him
should anything happen to the community because of his neglect of
duty&mdash;the primitive communal laws were harsh, the results of
their infringement, sudden and relentless. He jumped to his feet,
all excitement now. Not waiting to find a skin to throw over his
shoulders, he grasped his weapons and ran out upon the platform. A
quick glance revealed the fact that no sentry was in sight where a
sentry should have been. He recalled the stranger's query about the
location of the captive, and turned his face in the direction of
the further dwellings.</p>

<p>Running swiftly and silently he hastened toward the hut in which
Nat-ul had been confined, and so it was that as Nu emerged he found
a naked warrior almost upon him. At sight of Nu and the girl behind
him Throk raised his voice in a loud cry of alarm. His spear hand
flew back, but back, too, flew the spear hand of Nu, the son of Nu.
Two weapons flew simultaneously, and at the same instant Nat-ul, Nu
and Throk dropped to the planking to avoid the missiles. Both
whizzed harmlessly above them, and then the two warriors rushed
upon one another with upraised axes.</p>

<p>From every doorway men were pouring in response to Throk's cry.
Nu could not wait to close with his antagonist. He must risk the
loss of the encounter and his ax as well in one swift move. Behind
his shoulder his ax hand paused for an instant, then shot forward
and released the heavy weapon. With the force of a cannon ball the
crude stone implement flew through the air, striking Throk full in
the face, crushing his countenance to a mangled blur of bloody
flesh.</p>

<p>As the Lake Dweller stumbled forward dead, Nu grasped Nat-ul's
hand and dragged her around the corner of the dwelling out of sight
of the advancing warriors who were dashing toward them with savage
shouts and menacing weapons. At the rail of the platform Nu seized
Nat-ul and lifted her over, dropping her into the water beneath as
he vaulted over at her side.</p>

<p>A few strong strokes carried them well under the village, and as
they forged toward the shore they could hear the searchers running
hither and thither above them. The whole community was awake by
now, and the din was deafening. As the two crawled from the water
to the shore they were instantly discovered by those nearest them,
and at once the causeway rattled and groaned beneath the feet of a
hundred warriors that sped along it to intercept the flight of the
fugitives. Ahead of them were the dangers of the primeval night;
behind them were no less grave dangers at the hands of their savage
foes. Unarmed, but for a knife, it was futile to stand and fight.
The only hope lay in flight and the chance that they might reach
the forest and a sheltering tree before either the human beasts
behind them or the beasts of prey before had seized them.</p>

<p>Both Nu and Nat-ul were fleet of foot. Beside them, the Lake
Dwellers were sluggards, and consequently five minutes put them far
ahead of their pursuers, who, seeing the futility of further
pursuit and the danger of being led too far from their dwellings
and possibly into a strong camp of enemies, abandoned the chase and
returned to the lake.</p>

<p>Fortune favored Nu and Nat-ul, as it is ever credited with
favoring the brave. They reached the forest at the edge of the
plateau without encountering any of the more formidable carnivora.
Here they found sanctuary in a tree where they remained until dawn.
Then they resumed their way toward the cliffs which they must scale
to reach the sea. The matter of Gron had been settled between
them&mdash;they would offer to take her with them back to their own
people where she might live in safety so long as she chose.</p>

<p>It was daylight when Nu and Nat-ul reached the base of the
cliffs. Gron was not in sight. At the summit of the cliff, however,
two crafty eyes looked from behind a grassy screen upon them. The
watcher saw the man and the maid, and recognized them both. They
were ascending&mdash;he would wait a bit.</p>

<p>Nu and Nat-ul climbed easily upward. When they had gained about
half the distance toward the summit the man, shunning further
concealment, started downward to meet them. His awkwardness started
a loose stone and appraised them of his presence. Nu looked up, as
did Nat-ul.</p>

<p>"Tur!" exclaimed the latter.</p>

<p>"Tur," echoed Nu, and redoubled his efforts to ascend.</p>

<p>"You are unarmed," cautioned Nat-ul, "and he is above. The
advantage is all his."</p>

<p>But the cave man was hot to lay hands upon this fellow who had
brought upon Nat-ul all the hardships she had suffered. He loosed
his knife and carried it between his teeth, ready for instant use.
Like a cat he scrambled up the steep ascent. Directly at his heels
came his sweet and savage Nat-ul. Between her strong, white teeth
was her own knife. Tur was in for a warm reception. He had reached
a ledge now just below a cave mouth. Lying loosely upon the
cliff-side, scarcely balanced there, was a huge rock, a ton or two
of potential destruction. Tur espied it. Just below it, directly in
its path, climbed Nu and Nat-ul. Tur grasped in an instant the
possibilities that lay in the mighty weight of that huge boulder.
He leaped behind it, and bracing his feet against it and his back
against the cliff, pushed. The boulder leaned and rocked. Nu,
realizing the danger, looked to right and left for an avenue of
escape, but chance had played well into the hands of the enemy.
Just at this point there was no foothold other than directly where
they stood. They redoubled their efforts to reach the man before he
could dislodge the boulder.</p>

<p>Tur redoubled his efforts to start it spinning down upon them.
He changed his position, placing his shoulder against the rock and
one hand and foot against the cliff. Thus he pushed frantically.
The hideous menace to those below it swayed and rocked. Another
moment and it would topple downward.</p>

<p>Presently from the cave behind Tur a woman emerged, awakened by
the noises from without. It was Gron. She took in the whole scene
in a single glance. She saw Nu and with him Nat-ul. The man she
loved with the woman who stood between them, who must always stand
between them, for she realized that Nu would never love her,
whether Nat-ul were alive or dead.</p>

<p>She smiled as she saw success about to crown the efforts of Tur.
In another instant the man who scorned her love and the woman she
hated with all the power of her savage jealousy would be hurled,
crushed and mangled, to the bottom of the cliff.</p>

<p>Tur! She watched her mate with suddenly narrowing eyes. Tur! He
struck her! He repudiated her! A flush of shame scorched her cheek.
Tur! Her mate. The father of her child!</p>

<p>The rock toppled. Nu and Nat-ul from below were clambering
upward. The man had seen Gron, but he had read her emotions
clearly. No use to call upon her for help. Out of the past the old
love for her true mate had sprung to claim her. She would cleave to
Tur in the moment of his victory, hoping thus to win him back. Nor
was Nu insensible to the power of hatred which he might have
engendered in the woman's breast by repulsing her demonstrations of
love.</p>

<p>Another push like the last and the boulder would lunge down upon
them. Gron stood with her hands clutching her naked breasts, the
nails buried in the soft flesh until blood trickled down the bronze
skin. The father of her child. Her child! The pitiful thing that
she deserted within the shelter by the beach! Her baby&mdash;her
dead baby! Dead because of Tur and his cruelty toward her.</p>

<p>Tur braced himself for the final push. A smile curled his lip.
His back was toward Gron&mdash;otherwise he would not have smiled.
Even Nu did not smile at the thing he saw above him&mdash;the face
of a woman made hideous by hate and blood-lust. With bared knife
Gron leaped toward Tur. The upraised knife buried itself in his
back and chest. With a scream he turned toward the avenger. As his
eyes rested upon the face of the mother of his child, he shrieked
aloud, and with the shriek still upon his lips he sank to the
ledge, dead.</p>

<p>Then Gron turned to face the two who were rapidly ascending
toward her. Words of thanks were already upon Nu's lips; but Gron
stood silent, ready to meet them&mdash;with bared knife. What would
she do? Nu and Nat-ul wondered, but there was no retreat and only a
knife-armed woman barred their way to liberty and home.</p>

<p>Nu was almost level with her. Gron raised her knife above her
head. Nu sprang upward to strike the weapon to one side before it
was buried in his breast; but Gron was too quick for him. The blade
fell, but not upon Nu. Deep into her own broken heart Gron plunged
the sharp point, and at the same instant she leaped far beyond Nu
and Nat-ul to crash, mangled and broken at the foot of the lofty
cliff.</p>

<p>Death, sudden and horrible, was no stranger to these primeval
lovers. They saw that Gron was dead, and Tur, likewise. Nu
appropriated the latter's weapons, and side by side the two set out
to find the beach. They found it with only such delays and dangers
as were daily incidents in their savage lives. They found the boat,
too, and reached the mainland and, later, the cliffs and their
tribe, in safety. Here they found a wild welcome awaiting them, for
both had been given up as dead.</p>

<p>That night they walked hand in hand beneath the great equatorial
moon, beside the Restless Sea.</p>

<p>"Soon," said Nu, "Nat-ul shall become the mate of Nu, the son of
Nu. Nu, my father, hath said it, and so, too, has spoken Tha, the
father of Nat-ul. At the birth of the next moon we are to
mate."</p>

<p>Nat-ul nestled closer to him.</p>

<p>"My Nu is a great warrior," she said, "and a great hunter, but
he has not brought back the head of Oo, the killer of men and of
mammoths, that he promised to lay before the cave of Tha, my
father."</p>

<p>"Nu sets out at the breaking of the next light to hunt Oo," he
answered quietly, "nor will he return to claim his mate until he
has taken the head of the killer of men and mammoths."</p>

<p>Nat-ul laughed up into Nu's face.</p>

<p>"Nat-ul but joked," she said. "My man has proved himself greater
than a hunter of Oo. I do not want the great toothed head, Nu. I
only want you. You must not go forth to hunt the beast&mdash;it is
enough that you could slay him were he to attack us, and none there
is who dares say it be beyond you."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless I hunt Oo on the morrow," insisted Nu. "I have
never forgotten my promise."</p>

<p>Nat-ul tried to dissuade him, but he was obdurate, and the next
morning Nu, the son of Nu, set forth from the cliffs beside the
Restless Sea to hunt the lair of Oo.</p>

<p>All day Nat-ul sat waiting his return though she knew that it
might be days before he came back, or that he might not come at
all. Grave premonitions of impending danger haunted her. She
wandered in and out of her cave, looking for the thousandth time
along the way that Nu might come.</p>

<p>Suddenly a rumbling rose from far inland. The earth shook and
trembled. Nat-ul, wide-eyed with terror, saw her people fleeing
upward toward their caves. The heavens became overcast; the loud
rumbling rose to a hideous and deafening roar. The violence of the
earth's motion increased until the very cliffs in which the people
hid rocked and shook like a leaf before a hurricane.</p>

<p>Nat-ul ran to the innermost recess of her father's cave. There
she huddled upon the floor burying her face in a pile of bear and
lion skins. About her clustered other members of her father's
family&mdash;all were terror-stricken.</p>

<p>It was five minutes before the end came. It came in one awful
hideous convulsion that lifted the mighty cliff a hundred feet
aloft, cracking and shattering it to fragments as its face toppled
forward into the forest at its foot. Then there was
silence&mdash;silence awful and ominous. For five minutes the quiet
of death reigned upon the face of the earth, until presently from
far out at sea came a rushing, swirling sound&mdash;a sound that
only a few wild beasts were left to hear&mdash;and the ocean,
mountain high, rushed in upon what had been the village of Nu, the
chief.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chb15" id="chb15">XV. &mdash; WHAT THE CAVE
REVEALED</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">When Victoria Custer opened her eyes the first
face that she saw was that of her brother, Barney, bent above her.
She looked at him in puzzled bewilderment for a moment. Presently
she reached her hands toward him.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" she asked. "What has happened?"</p>

<p>"You're all right, Vic," replied the young man. "You're safe and
sound in Lord Greystoke's bungalow."</p>

<p>For another moment the girl knit her brows in perplexity.</p>

<p>"But the earthquake," she asked, "wasn't there an
earthquake?"</p>

<p>"A little one, Vic, but it didn't amount to anything&mdash;there
wasn't any damage done."</p>

<p>"How long have I been-er-this way?" she continued.</p>

<p>"You swooned about three minutes ago," replied her brother. "I
just put you down here and sent Esmeralda for some brandy when you
opened your eyes."</p>

<p>"Three minutes," murmured the girl&mdash;"three minutes!"</p>

<p>That night after the others had retired Barney Custer sat beside
his sister's bed, and long into the early morning she told him in
simple words and without sign of hysteria the story that I have
told here, of Nat-ul and Nu, the son of Nu.</p>

<p>"I think," she said, when she had finished the strange tale,
"that I shall be happier for this vision, or whatever one may call
it. I have met my dream man and lived again the life that he and I
lived countless ages ago. Even if he comes to me in my dreams again
it will not disturb me. I am glad that it was but a dream, and that
Mr. Curtiss was not killed by Terkoz, and that all those other
terrible things were not real."</p>

<p>"Now," said Barney, with a smile, "you may be able to listen to
what Curtiss has been trying to tell you." It was a half
question.</p>

<p>Victoria Custer shook her head.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I could never love him now. I cannot tell you
why, but it may be that what I have lived through in those three
minutes revealed more than the dim and distant past. Terkoz has
never liked him, you know."</p>

<p>Barney did not pursue the subject. He kissed the girl good night
and as the east commenced to lighten to the coming dawn he sought
his own room and a few hours' sleep.</p>

<p>The next day it was decided that Victoria and Barney should
start for the coast as soon as porters could be procured, which
would require but a few days at the most. Lieutenant Butzow,
Curtiss and I decided to accompany them.</p>

<p>It was the last day of their stay at the Greystoke ranch. The
others were hunting. Barney and Victoria had remained to put the
finishing touches upon their packing, but that was done now and the
girl begged for a last ride over the broad, game-dotted valley of
Waziri.</p>

<p>Before they had covered a mile Barney saw that his sister had
some particular objective in mind, for she rode straight as an
arrow and rapidly, with scarce a word, straight south toward the
foot of the rugged mountains that bound the Waziri's country upon
that side&mdash;in the very direction that she had previously
shunned. After a couple of hours of stiff riding they came to the
foot of the lofty cliff that had formerly so filled Victoria with
terror and misgivings.</p>

<p>"What's the idea, Vic," asked the man, "I thought you were
through with all this."</p>

<p>"I am, Barney," she replied, "or will be after today, but I just
couldn't go away without satisfying my curiosity. I want to know
that there is no cave here in which a man might be buried."</p>

<p>She dismounted and started to climb the rugged escarpment.
Barney was amazed at the agility and strength of the slender girl.
It kept him puffing to remain near her in her rapid ascent.</p>

<p>At last she stopped suddenly upon a narrow ledge. When Barney
reached her side he saw that she was very white, and he paled
himself when he saw what her eyes rested upon. The earthquake had
dislodged a great boulder that for ages evidently had formed a part
of the face of the cliff. Now it had tilted outward a half-dozen
feet, revealing behind it the mouth of a gloomy cavern.</p>

<p>Barney took Victoria's hand. It was very cold and trembled a
little.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, "this has gone far enough, Vic. You'll be sick
again if you keep it up. Come back to the horses&mdash;we've seen
all we want to see."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Not until I have searched that cave," she said, almost
defiantly, and Barney knew that she would have her way.</p>

<p>Together they entered the forbidding grotto, Barney in advance,
striking matches with one hand while he clung to his cocked rifle
with the other; but there was nothing there that longer had the
power to injure.</p>

<p>In a far corner the feeble rays of the match lighted something
that brought Barney to a sudden halt. He tried to turn the girl
back as though there was nothing more to be seen, but she had seen
too and pressed forward. She made her brother light another match,
and there before them lay the crumbling skeleton of a large man. By
its side rested a broken, stone-tipped spear, and there was a stone
knife and a stone ax as well.</p>

<p>"Look!" whispered the girl, pointing to something that lay just
beyond the skeleton.</p>

<p>Barney raised the match he held until its feeble flame carried
to that other object&mdash;the grinning skull of a great cat, its
upper jaw armed with two mighty, eighteen-inch, curved fangs.</p>

<p>"Oo, the killer of men and of mammoths," whispered Victoria
Custer, in an awed voice, "and Nu, the son of Nu, who killed him
for his Nat-ul&mdash;for me!"</p>
