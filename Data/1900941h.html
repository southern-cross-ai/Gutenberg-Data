<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER ONE</h2>

<p class="first">THE conversation, judging by what he heard of it
as he sauntered up to the east lounge, did not threaten any great
demands on his brains.</p>

<p>"All I know is that cricket's jolly good for the liver," Arthur
Bond was saying earnestly.</p>

<p>"It is really," echoed Cockburn.</p>

<p>"Isn't it!" agreed Rose absent-mindedly, as, with an apology,
she cut open a letter that had just come for her.</p>

<p>"And it doesn't have to be first-rate cricket, either," Bond
ruminated. He was a pretty boy, with a girlish face that amused his
friends, and misled his acquaintances.</p>

<p>"Not a bit," chimed in Cockburn, the elder of the friends by ten
years. The Honourable John Cockburn could not by any stretch of
affection be called handsome, but he had a pleasant, freckled face,
lit by a pair of eyes which were very steady and observant, though
their colour might be indeterminate.</p>

<p>Sibella gave her throaty laugh.</p>

<p>"Hush&mdash;h! If you say such brilliant things, Mr. Thornton'll
crib them for his book."</p>

<p>"I wasn't saying anything brilliant," protested Bond
ingenuously. Then, after he had shaken hands with Thornton, he
turned to their host.</p>

<p>"I really ought to've phoned you before blowing in like this,
but the Chief was so sure the professor would still be
here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My brother-in-law's a will of the wisp. Quite a respectable
variety, of course, but as uncertain."</p>

<p>"He's dancing around Genoa just now," Sibella announced idly,
"to keep to your simile, dad."</p>

<p>"Milan, my dear, Milan!" corrected her father shortly.</p>

<p>"In this note father speaks of having been in Genoa." Rose
replaced a half-sheet in a long envelope, drew out a sealed
enclosure, glanced at the address, doubled it up in her little
handbag, and turned again to the table.</p>

<p>Cockburn thought that the colonel looked vexed. An old scar on
his forehead blazed a bar of crimson. A sign of anger. Yet he could
hardly be annoyed with the girls for knowing where the professor
was. But already the colonel had puzzled him on the courts.
Generally a fine player&mdash;to-day! Cockburn eyed him as he cut a
cigar unevenly, and decided that something was up. It was not
Colonel Scarlett's habit to chip a Corona like that. Nor to hold it
so tightly that it leaked. Nor to smoke it at a pace which would
turn it into an overheated cabbage stalk.</p>

<p>"Of course you'll stay the night," Rose said hospitably. She was
pouring out tea. "Oh, I insist." Professor Charteris had one wing
of Stillwater House, and Rose had a free hand in it. The two young
men, however, glanced at the colonel. His eyes were on his
cigar.</p>

<p>"Sorry," Cockburn said at once, "next time we'll be
delighted."</p>

<p>"Well, you must stay for dinner," she insisted, "and for bridge
afterwards."</p>

<p>They thought they might venture thus far, uncle or no uncle.</p>

<p>Again the bar of red showed in the colonel's face. He, who was
supposed to be one of the most hospitable of men! He said with
seeming, heartiness, however, "Your bridge'll be a perfect godsend.
I never can understand how a clever chap like Thornton can call a
hand as he does. He'd go three no-trumps on one guarded knave."</p>

<p>"Not I!" Thornton protested "I don't say what I might not do,
if, like most people, I weren't restrained by the fear of what
comes after. You, Colonel, are the 'what comes after' at
cards."</p>

<p>"Do you think fear is a deterrent?" di Monti asked suddenly.</p>

<p>Thornton maintained that in many cases it was the only one.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps with you here in England. With us in
Italy&mdash;no! If a man wants to commit a crime, does he care that
he endangers his own life? Not a bit. What he wants is revenge.
Revenge!" The word rang out. "And he takes it!"</p>

<p>"With our poachers it's only fear of us J.P.'s that keeps them
under." The colonel spoke as though trying to turn a distasteful
subject.</p>

<p>"Especially as in their case there's no difficulty about the
disposal of the&mdash;what shall we call it&mdash;body or booty?"
Thornton put in idly. The colonel got up suddenly.</p>

<p>"Mind if I open the window a little?" he asked, and stepped on
through it, stepped so hastily that Rose looked after him
wonderingly.</p>

<p>Thornton found no chance of speaking to di Monti till tea was
over. He solved the problem by drawing a chair up close to the gate
that opened into the drive. Presently the purr of a large car
caught his ear. It was the count driving away in his Alfa Romeo. He
was due at a meeting of the London Facista.</p>

<p>Thornton stepped out down the drive and opened the gates. Mrs.
Bennet could be heard in the lodge trying to hand out impartial,
but hasty, justice to a couple of squabbling children.</p>

<p>Di Monti got out for a light, and they stood discussing the
car's points. Then the conversation drifted around to the
professor.</p>

<p>"His departure so unexpected is annoying," di Monti said
crossly; "it delays the announcement of my engagement to Miss
Charteris."</p>

<p>"My most hearty congratulations. Has it got so far as that?"</p>

<p>Di Monti stared at him. "Well, I suppose!"</p>

<p>"I'd no idea. With us, girls have so much freedom nowadays,"
Thornton replied easily.</p>

<p>"It is not a question of freedom," the Italian said haughtily,
and Thornton thought how cold his eyes were, in spite of the
slumbering fires deep within them. "It is merely a question of
announcing the engagement."</p>

<p>"Always supposing the young lady doesn't change her mind
meanwhile." Thornton spoke casually. "Such things do happen."</p>

<p>Di Monti made no reply. Thornton glanced at him, and then
glanced again. He made no mistake. He was looking into the face of
what could be a most dangerous man.</p>

<p>"Such a thing does not happen to a di Monti." Cangrande spoke
slowly, very slowly. "I possibly do not understand your meaning
aright."</p>

<p>"I have none, beyond a general one that it's so easy for
foreigners to think an English girl means more than she does. Or
shall we say that her words and actions mean less than he might
think. I have seen some awkward incidents."</p>

<p>"And you will certainly see one more, if&mdash;but I must not
detain you. The evening is too fine to waste in generalities which
do not apply to what we are discussing."</p>

<p>Di Monti had his voice under control, but the car leapt at his
touch, and Mrs. Bennet, who had come out to do her duties, ever
after maintained that the Italian had deliberately tried to murder
her.</p>

<p>Thornton took up his book again, feeling that he had done all he
could to prepare the man for the blow which was to come. He began
to understand a little of Rose's feeling. She, and
possibly&mdash;yes, quite possibly&mdash;her father, might be in
for a very unpleasant time. However, Rose could be trusted to
choose the easiest going.</p>

<p>He sauntered down to the hard courts later.</p>

<p>"I did my best with your kinsman," he said half ruefully,
sitting down beside Rose.</p>

<p>"Don't call him, that!" she begged with some warmth. "He's no
kin of mine! Of Sib.'s, yes. She's quite Italian, but I'm not."</p>

<p>"No, you're Greek. You're Circe's daughter." He shook his head
at her.</p>

<p>"How old would that make me?" She looked at him under the long
lashes, straight and golden, which framed her eyes like the rays of
a star. "Do you think two thousand years would be about right?"</p>

<p>"The professor's lovely daughter carries off the prize," he
announced with a bow. She laughed with him, then her face
clouded.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, Cangrande won't turn into anything so
simple&mdash;and so useful&mdash;as a mere pig. And he's sure to
think that father&mdash;or some one else&mdash;" With a little nip
of her perfect mouth that made her look years older, Rose turned
away in answer to a call.</p>

<p>Wilkins, the chauffeur, was surprised that Miss Scarlett decided
to drive herself, in her own little two-seater, to the concert. As
a rule, she was nervous of night driving. If Mrs. Lane wondered at
the car, and the whim, she made no comment.</p>

<p>When they were nearly into Medchester, Sibella turned to
her.</p>

<p>"You asked me to put you down at Jephsons' for some book or
other, didn't you? Do you mind if I don't wait for you? It's only a
step from there to the town hall, and I've a visit to pay before
the concert. I may be a bit late. If so, I shan't trouble to join
you in front, but I'll find a seat farther back. We can meet in the
lobby afterwards, if not before."</p>

<p>Sibella stopped the car. Mrs. Lane, got out and shut the door.
She went on into the shop, looking as though the arrangement suited
her too excellently. Sibella waited a moment, then turned the car,
and pressed the accelerator. Like a bird she darted away through
the evening light. The concert was from nine to eleven o'clock. It
was over when Mrs. Lane, waiting in the little portico, saw Sibella
again. She was coming out with an elder woman, who was laughing at
something that the girl was saying.</p>

<p>"Wasn't it splendid?" Sibella turned away to Mrs. Lane. "But I
thought they took that Third Movement much too fast. It's a mistake
to try and copy Kussevitsky's tempo."</p>

<p>They were out on the steps now. Their car was parked to one
side. As they walked to it, a lad ran up.</p>

<p>"Miss Scarlett! Miss Scarlett!"</p>

<p>Sibella turned.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's our newspaper boy. Well, Tommy?"</p>

<p>"Your handkerchief, miss. You dropped it just now when you ran
into the hall." He held out a wisp of lawn.</p>

<p>"Thank you. But hardly just now,'" Sibella said in a laughing
aside to her companion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lane gave her one of her thoughtful, considering looks.</p>

<p>It almost seemed to her that the girl was rouged. And that her
eyes shone like fire-flies in the dark of the night, but again she
made no comment.</p>

<p>Bond looked up from his cards to say heartily, "This is better
than a stuffy concert hall, what?"</p>

<p>He, Cockburn, and Colonel Scarlett were playing bridge with
Thornton in the latter's cottage.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came an interruption. Cockburn, who was dummy,
and like every other dummy, took a turn through the gardens while
the hand was being played, stuck his head hurriedly through one of
the long, open windows.</p>

<p>"I say! I heard a rifle shot over in the lane. Come on, you
fellows! Let's see what's wrong."</p>

<p>The interruption was most welcome to Thornton, who had allowed
himself to be goaded into calling four hearts, and had been left to
rustle for them with the help of a Yarborough. He happened to
glance at the colonel as he jumped up. So did Cockburn. Both men
saw a look of fear leap into Scarlett's eyes, and saw him crush it
down as he might have a dangerous spark as he, too, made for the
door.</p>

<p>"Where did it come from?" asked Bond, hard on his friend's
heels.</p>

<p>"Somewhere over the other side of the orchard. I&mdash;"
Cockburn fell sprawling into a flower bed&mdash;"shouldn't wonder
if it's a row between some poachers and a keeper."</p>

<p>As he picked himself up, he turned towards the colonel, whose
feelings about poachers were well known.</p>

<p>"Or Mrs. Viney's pug burst at last," Bond called back, as the
colonel made no reply. "She lives across there."</p>

<p>They found the lane deserted, but Cockburn insisted on searching
every foot of road and hedge, till they worked around to the main
gates of Stillwater again.</p>

<p>"There's nothing to catch here except a wetting. A downpour is
coming." The colonel seemed to have suddenly regained his good
humour.</p>

<p>In the face of such matter-of-factness the excitement simmered
down, and after a few more unanswered shouts, and the first heavy
drops of rain, some one suggested a rush to the garage close by,
and a general clean-up.</p>

<p>Wilkins was out, but the pump, a towel, and a little petrol
repaired all damages, and chaffing the cause of the disturbance,
the men returned to finish the rubber, which lasted so late that
Thornton insisted on putting "Bond and Co." up for the night, since
the colonel still had no suggestions to make.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER TWO</h2>

<p class="first">THE day after the concert was one of those
wonderful spring mornings, when even the dullest man feels his
kinship with the fields, and the birds, and the play of shine and
shadow.</p>

<p>Across the grass of Medchester Common, which stretched in a
sheet of clearest green, for its leopard skin of daisy and
buttercup was still to come, ran Bond, with Cockburn several yards
behind him. Both men were in running kit. Once, the man in the rear
stopped, and called out something. But as he regularly recorded
some injury every hundred yards or so, which necessitated a halt,
Bond only laughed and ran on.</p>

<p>This time, however, an exclamation followed which made Bond
wheel. The other was staring with bulging eyes and dropped jaw into
a sand-pit just off the path. The look on his face made his friend
come sprinting back.</p>

<p>"What's wrong? What's up?"</p>

<p>Cockburn only pointed, and Bond, following the direction of his
hand, felt his own muscles slacken.</p>

<p>"Good God!" he breathed. Then, with a "Here! There must be a way
down!" he ran around the pit, and together they slithered to the
bottom, where lay the body of Rose Charteris.</p>

<p>She was quite dead. Her face, serene and beautiful, upturned to
the periwinkle deeps above her. And compared with the utter
stillness of it, the sky seemed a turmoil, the clouds a fighting
army.</p>

<p>It was unmarred by any injury, but it lay appallingly far over
one shoulder. Only a broken neck could take that position.</p>

<p>Cockburn picked up one little clenched hand. His reverent manner
told again what both men knew.</p>

<p>"She's quite dead."</p>

<p>Bond touched it too. It was as stiff as a piece of ivory.</p>

<p>"I'll fetch a doctor." He bounded off as though time still had a
meaning for that which lay behind him.</p>

<p>Cockburn took up the watch beside the shell of Rose. The sound
of steps walking slowly along the road reached him. He clambered
out of the pit and saw Thornton coming around a bend.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood seemed to keep exemplary hours. As a rule,
"Bond and Co." had their morning dips and runs to themselves.</p>

<p>"What's the time?" Cockburn called. Then coming nearer as
Thornton replied, "Six," he went on, "Miss Charteris has fallen
down the sand-pit here. She's quite dead. Bond and I've just come
upon her. Frightful to see her lying there."</p>

<p>"Dead! Miss Charteris dead!"</p>

<p>Glancing at him, Cockburn noticed how gray his face had
grown.</p>

<p>Bond came running back.</p>

<p>"Medico's coming along at once."</p>

<p>A raucous horn sounded, and a two-seater stopped beside a clump
of trees some yards from the path. "Morning everybody! Surely
there's some mistake. Miss Charteris&mdash;" The doctor had looked
into the pit. He left his sentence unfinished. Turning, he replaced
his little black bag with a shake of his head, and made his way
down.</p>

<p>"Shocking thing to've happened." He got up from beside the dead
girl "She's been dead for hours. It's criminal to leave places like
this unfenced. Well, I suppose we shall get our railings&mdash;now!
She must have stepped off the path right over the edge. I'd better
be getting along to Stillwater House to break the news.
Poor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Morning, gentlemen!" said a brisk voice, with a hint of
breathlessness in it. The Medchester superintendent of police was
not as young as he had been. "I met a young gentleman down the
road&mdash;oh, there you are, sir!" This to Bond. "Ay, that's our
Miss Charteris right enough. Not much chance of mistaking her for
any one else." His eye took in professionally but sympathetically
the still young figure and the oddly bent head "What a terrible
thing to've happened. No need to ask if she's dead."</p>

<p>"Neck's broken. She must have gone too near the edge and fallen
over."</p>

<p>"When do you think it happened, sir?"</p>

<p>But the doctor was too young a man to set an hour by the
old-fashioned clock of <i>rigor mortis</i>, or temperature. He
shook his head.</p>

<p>"Some hours ago evidently. Apparently on an early sketching
expedition She's got her little outfit with her." He picked up the
japanned box as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Has she now?" The superintendent looked more shocked than ever.
"Ah, here's Briggs. Blest if he hasn't brought the broken
stretcher. I'd best go back with him."</p>

<p>"We'll leave you to come on with the body, superintendent. But
how about my car? She only holds two."</p>

<p>"Bond and Co." at once offered to wait for the stretcher.</p>

<p>"Then shall I give you a lift, Mr. Thornton? This has been a
great shock even to me, and a doctor's used to death."</p>

<p>Thornton thanked him, and after arranging with the two friends
to breakfast at Red Gates, got in.</p>

<p>"Sad case!" The doctor, a fair, chubby young man, started the
engine at last. "Going to be married to that Italian staying down
at the Medchester Arms, I understand. Though I seem to remember
something about her having been as good as engaged to Bellairs, the
artist, and that it was only the count's huge fortune that tipped
the scale. But if one believed all one hears!"</p>

<p>Thornton gave his usual, non-committal nod.</p>

<p>"Her father's against the marriage with the count. Quite right,
too," the doctor went on. "Very clever man, Professor Charteris. He
was talking to me about a synthetic-emerald company which he's
going to start, on the links the other day. I mean, he was talking
on the links, not going to start making 'em there." The doctor
checked his laugh. "This will be a terrible blow to him. And to the
ladies up at Stillwater. At least&mdash;I dunno. She and Miss
Sibella weren't supposed to get on over well together lately. But
you know how wide of the mark idle chatter of that kind often is. I
really hope for once, though, that there may be something in it.
It'll break this blow, a bit."</p>

<p>"I had no idea there had been any ill-feeling between the two
girls," Thornton murmured truthfully. He felt like a man, rather
proud of his sight, who tries on a stranger's eyeglasses, and finds
his field of vision trebled.</p>

<p>"Of course, I don't know anything about it&mdash;I never pay
attention to gossip, but they're said to've been at daggers drawn
for some time past. Some say over the legacy, and some over the way
Miss Charteris turned down young Bellairs before it was known how
his mother was going to leave her money&mdash;after she married
again, you know. I think it was over the legacy myself. Well, Miss
Scarlett'll have it all now. She little thought it would come to
her so quickly. But of course, if what people hint is true, and
it's to do with the count! Both the girls had that hot Italian
blood in them, you know. Old blood. Too old. Give me a nice English
girl or woman&mdash;like Mrs. Lane, now. There's a woman for you!
Nerves of steel."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" Thornton said politely, looking bored.</p>

<p>"Lots more in her than you'd think. Wonderfully taking young
woman, too. I had to set a sprained wrist for her once. The rumour
runs that she only has to lift her little finger to be Mrs.
Scarlett the second, for all she's young enough to be the colonel's
daughter. But I make a point of never listening to
tittle-tattle."</p>

<p>"Oh?"</p>

<p>"Can't as a medical man, you know. Quite impossible."</p>

<p>There followed a little break in the impossible.</p>

<p>"Do you know when the professor's coming back?" Thornton thought
that amid such a flood of information that item might well be
washed up.</p>

<p>"I? Not the faintest notion! How should I have? But there's an
idea about that he's off for Verona to see if a law-suit can't be
avoided by a friendly settlement out of court. If you ask me, I
should say that he's much more likely to see if the engagement, or
whatever it is, can't be stopped. As for expecting any family,
however rich, to hand over land, that's always rather a pill, isn't
it? And so's my breaking the news here."</p>

<p>The doctor's car clanked noisily up the drive. Thornton saw one
of the curtains on an upper floor twitched a little to one side.
Nothing was visible of the face looking out except a pair of eyes.
They were so nearly level with the window ledge that their owner
must be stooping or kneeling. The strange thing was the expression
in them.</p>

<p>Thornton called his companion's attention to something on the
other side of the gardens, as they stopped with a grinding clash
that would have disturbed the driver of a donkey-engine, but which
left the doctor unruffled.</p>

<p>He himself walked on past the house. He took quite a turn in the
grounds, before returning to his cottage. Mrs. Bennet, she of last
night's narrow escape, was setting the breakfast table. One glance
at her and he saw that she knew of the accident.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, the poor young lady's just arrived! The poor young
thing! To think that I warned her only last week about that path.
'Miss Rose,' I said, 'don't you believe Miss Sibella that it's so
much shorter, or, if it is, it's dangerouser.' But there!"</p>

<p>A light knock interrupted her. It was "Bond and Co.," and a very
quiet breakfast followed. Mrs. Bennet's cooking conduced to silent
meals, but it was not the reason this time. When the three men had
lit their pipes, they strolled out into the garden. Another silence
fell. Each seemed deep in thoughts that he was in no hurry to
share. As usual, it was Bond who took the lead.</p>

<p>"You know, I'm not quite easy in my mind," he said at last in a
low tone, "not at all easy! No, I'm dashed if I am!"</p>

<p>"Easy about what?" Thornton asked after a pause</p>

<p>Bond jerked his head towards the house. "Frightful end to come
to a lovely girl like that, and Heaven knows I don't want to make
bad worse. Yet&mdash;well, I'm not easy in my mind. There was
something about the way she lay in that sand-pit. I can't put a
name to it, but there was. Look here, I'm going to have another
inspection of that place, and round about. Care to come, either of
you?"</p>

<p>Thornton nodded. It was a favourite way with him of carrying on
a conversation. Cockburn had already turned.</p>

<p>They started to walk back by the footpath. Suddenly Cockburn
stopped.</p>

<p>"By Jove! I believe those are her very footprints before
us!"</p>

<p>All three saw the marks of a small shoe with a low heel, just
such a shoe as Rose wore, in fact, clearly marked in the damp
earth. Walking carefully on the grass, they traced them until they
stopped at the spot where the sand-pit ran in close to the
path.</p>

<p>"Then here's where we ought to examine a bit more closely."
Bond's voice was very low.</p>

<p>All around them the common stretched. Close beside them on the
right lay the sand-pit. Some distance to the left a copse straggled
untidily. Just the usual brambles, spindly aspens, and twisted
nondescripts On one of the branches a willow warbler was pouring
out a little song, as perfect and as finished as his own
green-and-white feathered coat. A cuckoo called from far
away&mdash;melancholy, mysterious. Such sounds might have been the
last that Rose Charteris's ears had ever heard.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bond pounced on something lying just beneath the
singer. Something that glittered like a drop of belated dew. It was
an amethyst bead of a beautiful full purple. Cockburn picked up a
second. As he turned his find over on his palm it left a red
stain.</p>

<p>A little thing, this bead, he thought, to possibly hang a
man.</p>

<p>"Blood," Bond nodded to himself. "Yes&mdash;well, I felt sure
that something was wrong. And here again on this little clover
patch, here's blood again."</p>

<p>No one spoke for a tense second, then he went on.</p>

<p>"I don't think we ought to track up the place any more, or paw
things over. I think we ought to go at once to the police."</p>

<p>"Surely to Colonel Scarlett first, and let him call in the
police," Thornton objected.</p>

<p>"Every moment's of value," Bond pointed out briefly. "I don't
think this is a time to stay for mere politeness."</p>

<p>"It's a question of common decency," Thornton spoke with warmth.
"We ought to go to him first, and tell him about the beads. Not
spring the police on him before the stretcher carrying his niece
has more than reached the house."</p>

<p>Cockburn looked as though there were something to be said for
this point of view. But Bond thrust out that slight, rather
retreating jaw of his.</p>

<p>"Sorry, I don't see it that way. We might waste half the morning
in talk. Look here, the superintendent seems a decent chap; let's
lay the affair before him, and he can see to it that no one's
feelings are unnecessarily shocked. Or why not you go back to
Stillwater, and let the colonel know, while Co. and I go on to the
police station?"</p>

<p>Thornton did not seem to care for this suggestion.</p>

<p>"No. I'll go on with you, since you insist on doing it this
way."</p>

<p>The three walked to the nearby police station. And, a moment
later, to the accompaniment of whiffs of kippers, the police
officer they had met at the sand pit hurried into the room. He was
a stout, florid man, who owed his position to the pluck with which
he had stopped three bank robbers after they had killed the
manager.</p>

<p>Now he himself was due to retire very shortly. He had done very
well. He was an honest, fair-minded, kindly man. Popular, in spite
of his strictness, even with the tramps that passed that way.</p>

<p>He listened attentively to what his three visitors had to say,
looking, thoughtfully at the two beads and the tuft of clover laid
in front of him. Then he turned to the telephone and rang up the
doctor. There followed a quick interchange of questions and
answers. Then the receiver was laid down, and Superintendent Harris
turned with a smile.</p>

<p>"You heard, gentlemen? Doctor's perfectly satisfied that death
was due to a fall from the path above into that sand-pit. I must
say I share that opinion. Very likely the beads broke as she was
walking along. She may have stopped to knot the string together in
that copse. As for the blood, just the remains of a bunny-and-stoat
tragedy, I fancy, such as you can find a-plenty among the lanes.
Were the beads valuable?"</p>

<p>All three looked to Thornton.</p>

<p>"Not compared with the crown jewels, but the amethysts were of a
rare colour. And the pendant, besides being an unusually fine piece
of Persian lapis lazuli, well veined with gold and silver, had
belonged to Cosimo de Medici. That, of course, might enormously
increase its value to a collector."</p>

<p>"I see"&mdash;the superintendent, at any rate, tried
to&mdash;"but it's not like&mdash;say, a fine diamond brooch, I
mean the whole lot?"</p>

<p>Thornton agreed that that was so.</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen," Superintendent Harris said after another
pause, "I really don't see any need to distress the family. Though
I'm sure I'm much obliged to you for coming to me so promptly." And
he bowed them out.</p>

<p>Each of the three was very distrait as they parted at the garage
of Stillwater House, where "Bond and Co." got out their car. As for
Thornton, he went on up the drive and rang the bell.</p>

<p>It was Paul, the general man-servant, who opened the door. Paul
was a gentle, garrulous soul. He looked very subdued and
mournful.</p>

<p>"Come in, Mr. Thornton, sir. I see you've heard the news. Oh,
sir, what a tragedy. What a blow for the family, and especially for
the professor, he being away on his holiday so to speak." Paul shut
the door as though it were a coffin lid. "The colonel's not in,
sir. He's just gone up to town with Mrs. Lane to see about getting
into touch with the poor gentleman I'm sure I don't realise our
loss yet, sir. None of us do. But having been born on the
estate"&mdash;Paul always referred to Stillwater's few acres as
though it were Balmoral&mdash;"finds it doubly hard."</p>

<p>He could not say when the colonel would be back, nor where he
could be reached, and Thornton was let out again with the same
solemnity. He walked slowly to his cottage, looking like a man
weighing something very important, and by no means certain on which
side the scales will ultimately dip. Yet evidently extremely
unwilling to do&mdash;whatever he thought of doing&mdash;until he
had reasoned out where the most weight should ultimately lie.</p>

<p>Finally he picked up a telephone book and hunted up a number. It
was the number of New Scotland Yard. He asked for Detective Chief
Inspector Carman. Now, as it happened, that police officer was out
on a case. But scribbling a note for him in his room was a tall man
in worn tweeds, with a spare, athletic figure, and a certain look
of quiet competency on his sunburnt, good-looking face. A very
resolute face it was, only saved from being a hard face by the
kindly, wide-apart, well-opened, gray eyes. It was he who took down
the receiver.</p>

<p>"Detective Chief-Inspector Carman? I'm afraid he's out. Friend
of his, may I ask? Oh, just read of him in the morning paper; I
see."</p>

<p>"Hullo, Pointer!" a brisk voice hailed him from another room, "I
thought your leave wasn't up till day after tomorrow!"</p>

<p>"Busman's holiday. I had to come up for a visit to the dentist."
The man at the telephone turned to the tube again.</p>

<p>"Are you there? Can I give Chief-Inspector Carman a message? I
can't say... he may he out all day... it's Detective
Chief-Inspector Pointer speaking."</p>

<p>There was a pause at the other end, then he heard Thornton say
very slowly:</p>

<p>"A young lady has been found dead. I was one of those who found
her. The doctor says it's an accident; the superintendent at the
police station says the same; but&mdash;" Here followed an account
of the beads and the tuft of grass. Then he continued, "And since
thinking it over, I have an impression that there may be something
wrong, and that's not a pleasant impression to have in such a
case."</p>

<p>"Certainly not. Who is speaking? The name will be quite
confidential. Thornton? Mr. Thornton of the 'Athenaum' and the
'Saville'? Quite so. And the young lady? I see. Well..." There
followed a pause. "Of course, as you're no doubt aware, sir, New
Scotland Yard can't take a hand in any investigation unless asked
by the chief constable of the county. But there are ways, of
course..." Followed another pause. "Are you there, sir? I'll tell
you what I'll do. Have you a car? Good! Drive it yourself?
Excellent! If you'll meet me half-an-hour from now, that's
nine-thirty exactly, at&mdash;" Pointer had opened an ordnance map
of Hertfordshire. He indicated a spot very close to Stillwater
House. "I'll come down myself unofficially. I'm on leave and, of
course, where I choose to spend it is my own affair. You write, I
believe, Sir?"</p>

<p>The clubs mentioned made this a likely shot. Thornton said that
he did, on Eastern art chiefly.</p>

<p>"Just so. Illustrated? Good. Then I'll come down as a
draughtsman sent by your publishers to take your instructions about
some new plates in your coming work."</p>

<p>"A most unlikely story to any one who knows publishers,"
objected Thornton, "but the point is to get the case cleared up.
The girl's father is abroad. Her uncle's un-get-at-able in town.
And one always understands that to be early on the spot is half the
battle for an investigator."</p>

<p>Pointer agreed heartily and hung up the receiver. He proceeded
to have a car sent around. He was very particular about its
appearance. Just as particular as he was about his own, though
Thornton did not suspect the care in either case when a battered,
dirty, noisy little two-seater coughed its way around the bend at
the hour set by his Scotland Yard ally. Its looks certainly suited
the man who lumbered out into the road. A big depressed-looking
figure, round-shouldered and shabbily dressed, with spectacles on
his drooping, slightly-reddened nose.</p>

<p>"Mr. Thornton?" His voice suggested ill-health "I'm Brown, the
man you were talking to on the 'phone just now." He coughed
wheezily. "From the printers', sir. May I get in?"</p>

<p>"Tumble in," said Thornton, and Brown obeyed him literally,
giving him a meek glance as he did so. The detective officer saw a
man of about thirty-six, medium-build, dark, good looking but for
an air of weariness, spiritual rather than physical. Life bored Mr.
Thornton, and life is apt to resent that attitude. He had a
satirical smile, and a veiled, non-committal eye.</p>

<p>"Keep the car away from the hedges, please," suggested the man
beside him, undercover of a none too clean handkerchief, "and as
you take me to the lane behind your cottage perhaps you would give
me an idea of how the rooms lie in Stillwater House, especially
Miss Charteris's room."</p>

<p>Thornton did so.</p>

<p>"One thing more," his companion continued, "when we get there,
will you kindly make your way to outside her room and wait there on
guard till I come out. If any one passes her door, just strike a
match. I see you smoke. If they make as though to enter, strike a
second. When I'm done with the room, I shall join you at the place
where you stop your car. Of course, should I be noticed in the
house, I should be simply sent by the undertakers."</p>

<p>Once arrived at Red Gates, the man slipped out and disappeared
up a side path as though he knew the grounds by heart.</p>

<p>Thornton met no one as he climbed the broad staircase in the dim
light of drawn blinds, and sat down on the landing: He heard no
sound from within the room where they had carried Rose.</p>

<p>Yet the man from Scotland Yard was inside it. He was just
lifting the sheet which lay over the dead girl. Her head had been
straightened on the pillow, and her wrists loosely crossed,
otherwise she lay very much as she had been found.</p>

<p>Pointer parted the beautiful hair gently. The cut on top was not
deep. From his bag he took a tiny phial. Fastened to the inside of
its screw top was a wire with a pad of sterilised wool at the end.
He carefully swabbed the cut, going only a little way along it, so
as to leave a possible trail for others. He looked, at the swab
closely.</p>

<p>It showed what seemed like earth, and a few tiny specks of what
his magnifying glass told him were bits of flower-pot ware, or
possibly red tiling. He re-screwed the phial, labelled it, and
dropped it into his bag. Then he rapidly examined the girl's face
and dress The shoes detained him some minutes The soles at the
heels showed traces of having walked in damp, sandy earth Some
country lane, he guessed The bows had both been tied very
carelessly, and both very much off to one side The same side. He
took a small dot of the mud from one heel and labelled its
envelope. Then he cut two patterns of the soles out of paper, and
put them away in his pocket. There was a small bruise on one arm.
It told nothing as to its origin, except that he did not think that
it had been caused by any encircling pressure such as a grip Under
both her hands, which had opened since she had been laid on the
bed, for <i>rigor mortis</i> was passing off, he found some
withered twigs, and what looked like tea leaves, so shrivelled were
they by the icy touch of death.</p>

<p>Out of the bag came an outfit that formed a small microscope
when put together. The leaves showed now as crushed withered flower
petals, almost like tiny white roses. Pointer was a Bideford man.
He knew his plants and trees. This was from a sloe tree. This was
blackthorn. He examined the dead girl's hands carefully with one of
the glasses that he detached. They were lightly scratched on
outside and inside, but they showed no trace of sand. Neither did
the nails.</p>

<p>On one sleeve was a tiny smear of green paint, very faint. He
knew that the dead girl had had her painting box with her, but it
held water-colours. This felt like oil paint of some kind. A few
drops of turpentine from his bag settled it. It was oil paint. He
turned the still figure gently over.</p>

<p>Across the back of her frock, a few inches above her waist, ran
a broad tear. It looked at a glance, remembering where she had been
found, as though the frock had caught, on an overhanging bough or
pointed stone. But the glass showed that two threads of the
knitting had been cut, quite definitely cut with scissors. Nor was
the remainder of the dress pulled in any way, as it would have been
had she hung from some projecting catch. He decided that a strip as
long as his span, and as broad as his hand, had been taken from the
back, and the silk 'teased' to look as though torn.</p>

<p>He turned to the things which had been found with her. They were
lying on the table. There was the tin box with a sketch of some
ruins in the lid. Pointer felt the picture. It was dry. So were the
brushes. So were the little china pans of paint. They had not been
dampened for a week past, he felt sure. Next he picked up her hat
of silver gray felt, soft as a kid glove. At the mere feel of it he
gave an inward jump. It was quite dry. All the rest of Rose, even
to the hair which had clung in cold tendrils around his fingers,
was wringing wet. As he examined the hat his features stiffened.
The inside was badly stained with blood from the cut, but the
outside was unmarked in any way. There was no trace of blow or
fall. The hat had been put on after the injury was inflicted. Must
have been. After all her clothes were soaked through. After she was
dead, or unconscious, in other words.</p>

<p>The case had some unusual features already. It was speedily to
acquire more. Pointer, in his guise of Brown, slipped out of the
room, locking the door again on the outside as he had found it.
Without a glance at the waiting Thornton, he drifted down some back
stairs.</p>

<p>Thornton went out to his car. A minute later Brown joined
him.</p>

<p>"Sand-pit. As near as possible without our being seen,
please."</p>

<p>Then, when they were well under way, he asked whether Miss
Charteris had been wearing a hat when her body was found.</p>

<p>"Yes. A gray felt. The doctor took it off to see the extent of
the head injury. He brought it home with him in the car along with
her painting outfit."</p>

<p>Close to the pit, Brown stumbled out again, and Thornton waited.
Disguise there might be, but he felt certain that many halts, and
much missing of the path, would mark the progress of this hound of
the law.</p>

<p>The man from Scotland Yard walked back a little way along the
short-cut, examining the shoe-prints carefully. Then he clambered
down into the pit. There was no water there. Then he scrutinised
the nearby copse. He saw no blackthorn tree amongst them As for the
pit, neither in it, not at its edge, was there green of any kind
but grass. He returned to the car.</p>

<p>"Well," Thornton asked tensely, "have I got you down here on a
wild-goose chase?"</p>

<p>The voice that answered him was the one that up till now he had
only heard over the telephone. A quiet voice, but resonant, and
full of character.</p>

<p>"I think not, sir."</p>

<p>Thornton was surprised at the change in the eyes looking into
his. The make-up was still there. The reddened lids, the watery
effect, but there was in them now the look of the captain on the
bridge taking over command when dirty weather is expected.</p>

<p>And Thornton's face, too, though he was unaware of the fact, had
altered. There was a hint of pallor in it of stress around the
mobile mouth that was carefully noted. It was not more than might
have been expected under the circumstances, but it was not
less.</p>

<p>"I suppose you couldn't tell me if you have found anything that
looks like foul play?" Thornton's eyes were more veiled than usual
as he put the question.</p>

<p>Apparently the man beside him could not.</p>

<p>"What <i>did</i> kill her?" Thornton asked after a futile
wait.</p>

<p>"A fall."</p>

<p>"You think she was flung into that sand pit, then?"</p>

<p>"Well, she was found there, wasn't she?" Thornton thought that
it would be hard to imagine a more inane reply.</p>

<p>"Now, sir, I shall walk back along this short cut," Brown went
on in a whisper. "May I ask you a few more questions at your
cottage presently?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. I am quite at your service. Of course you must let
me put you up."</p>

<p>Brown thanked him, and then shambled slowly back beside the
marks of Rose's shoes. His eyes were now on them, now searching the
trees in sight. Here and there he saw patches of snowy blackthorn,
but the trees were never where they could have played a part in the
mysterious death that he was studying. Yet Rose Charteris's hands
had grasped their leaves as she fell. Fell whence? Fell where?</p>

<p>Back at Stillwater he turned into the grounds and walked slowly
through them. He came to a halt not far from Thornton's cottage,
facing the lake that gave the house its name, and which now marked
one boundary of Colonel Scarlett's grounds. An Italian summer house
stood at one end, so surrounded by evergreens that it was hidden
alike from house and cottages. Its two stories ended in a
waist-high railing which marked out half the flat roof into a
square, with high corner posts crowned with flowers. The railing
was green. So was an outside stair that ran from the ground to the
little Lookout, as Pointer learnt later that the roof was
called.</p>

<p>Around the summer house ran a row of flower-pots set on a broad
band of red tiles. There were four doors, each marked by a tree. On
the side farthest from the house lay a pile of cut boughs beside
one of these little sentinels.</p>

<p>The tree, a blackthorn, had been lopped back almost to a
pole.</p>

<p>Pointer hurriedly lifted the snowy branches one by one. Those
underneath had been badly broken, as though by some heavy object
falling through them. He ran up the outside stairs. The railing was
being repainted, and repainted green. The same coloured green as
the faint smear that he had just seen on Rose Charteris's sleeve.
It was still tacky. On one side, the side above the cut boughs,
were three dull smudges. A broad smudge the length of his span, and
two smaller ones, well to one side. All three showed a sort of
turning movement.</p>

<p>He looked very closely at them. The two smaller ones he took to
be hand grips, though they showed no definite fingerprints. The
turning movements of whoever had gripped the rail to look down on
the flagging below had been too strong for that.</p>

<p>All three marks had been made before last night's rain, and
judging by their looks at about the same time. The balustrade was
still bordered with a fringe of tiny drops.</p>

<p>The broad one corresponded in length and height from the flat
roof top, with the missing strip on the back of the dead girl's
frock. The balustrade was not a broad one, but Pointer thought that
the greater width of the cut-out oblong had been caused by a rotary
movement on the paint.</p>

<p>That would mean that she had been flung over backwards. And
those hand-grips&mdash;they might well be those of the murderer
peering down at the lifeless body of his victim. They were not made
by Rose, and he thought not made by any woman, Rose had
exceptionally slender hands.</p>

<p>He knew now where Rose Charteris had met her death. He believed
that he was standing on the very spot.</p>

<p>The line of clues had been so straight that he hoped for a
short, clear case which would be over in a couple of days. It had
begun like that, but a few minutes later he saw that it was not
going on like that. Not at all. Pointer always considered the Rose
Charteris murder as puzzling a problem as any that he had ever
tackled.</p>

<p>He made his way through a gate close by to the short cut again,
and traced those shoe-prints, that corresponded exactly to the two
outlines which he had in his pocket, back to the sand-pit.</p>

<p>The marks were deep and clear. They must have been made when the
sandy path before him was soft and yielding, but not sloppy after
the rain. Their edges were far too sharp and definite for them to
have been washed by such a flood as that of last night.</p>

<p>But Rose Charteris's dress, her hair, her shoes&mdash;but not
her hat&mdash;were wringing wet. There was no water in the
sand-pit; its sides had been too deep to let the very slanting
downpour strike in hard. Nor would any pool there have explained
the fact that though her clothes and hair were soaked through on
top, they were merely damp beneath her. No. Rose must have lain out
in that hard rain from start to finish. Lain in all likelihood
where she struck the flagging. That meant that these shoe-prints
were made some hours after Rose herself had taken her last
steps.</p>

<p>Pointer remembered the hasty bows on the shoes. Both tied to the
same side. The rain, as he had ascertained from the meteorological
expert at the Yard, had come down in this part of England at
half-past ten, almost to the second, and lasted just twenty
minutes.</p>

<p>That being so, he decided that the prints before him had been
made somewhere around one o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>He took some casts with stearine powder and some careful
photographs with his tiny camera, that photographed vertically
downwards.</p>

<p>The steps were those of a woman light in weight walking slowly,
and balancing herself very strangely. At one moment her weight was
on her right foot. At the next it would be on her left. Sometimes a
step backwards had been taken, sometimes the forward step checked
halfway. She was a young woman with a springy gait. He judged,
though, that the shoes were too big for her. Now Rose had small
feet for her height, so whoever had taken her place would be
shorter than she, or much smaller-boned, slighter built. But the
gait! The strange, halting, pressing gait! Lurching at times... the
word was the key he needed. On the instant he guessed the reason,
for this was no drunken woman's purposeless perambulation. The
woman who wore the shoes of the dead girl was not carrying a load,
but she was steadying one.</p>

<p>Pointer studied the ground like a bushman. He found a mark such
as he was looking for, first on one side of the path, and
then&mdash;in one other place&mdash;on the other side. Such a mark
as a hard-tyred bicycle would make But it did not cross the path He
made quite sure of that He deduced something like two hard-tyred
bicycles with a space between. Possibly a plank had been lashed to
them, the body of the dead girl placed on this, and wheeled to the
pit.</p>

<p>But this did not explain the fact that though some of the prints
showed the woman as steadying she was never pushing a weight. She
was keeping something true, but she was not using force. Evidently
some one else had done the pushing or drawing, her task merely
being to see that no wheel ran on the sandy path where Rose
Charteris's were to be the only marks left behind. All other
footprints had come much later, when the path was far dryer, or
else had been pounded flat by the rain previously.</p>

<p>Under the trees in the copse, Pointer read some more of the
cryptogram which every crime leaves behind it.</p>

<p>He saw now that it was not two bicycles lashed together which
had been used, but a sort of trolley mounted on two hard-tyred
wheels about three feet apart. He had never seen such a carrier,
but, like some savant, reconstructing a prehistoric monster from a
jaw-bone and an inch of fossil spine, he could by now have drawn it
to scale.</p>

<p>Under the trees he found prints of Rose Charteris's shoes, of a
man's boots, and of a woman's high heels, all in inextricable
confusion, but the marks of Rose were nowhere on top.</p>

<p>Here, then, he thought, the woman had changed into her own
footwear.</p>

<p>He did not think that the body of the dead girl had been flung
into the pit. It might in that case have shown cuts which a doctor
would know had been made after death. The Scotland Yard officer
examined the pit minutely. There were no marks detectable as those
of the sinister couple who had walked from one of the farther gates
of Stillwater House to the pit last night with a corpse between
them. He decided that Bond, Cockburn, and Thornton, the doctor, and
the men with the stretcher had obliterated them. There was only one
easy way down, to the bottom.</p>

<p>Pointer walked rapidly to the police station, but Superintendent
Harris was up in town, the chief constable was down with influenza,
and Briggs, the constable in charge, looked to Pointer a better
judge of beer than crime.</p>

<p>He returned to Red Gates, where he found Thornton doing a good
five miles an hour in front of his fireplace.</p>

<p>"I want to ask you a question or two about the doctor who was
fetched when Miss Charteris was found dead. Is he the sensible,
family doctor type?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"More of the leaky-sieve type, though doubtless the soul of good
nature. Why?" Thornton wheeled sharply about.</p>

<p>"I'm thinking about that death certificate that he's going to
fill out. You see, it's not so easy opening people's eyes when
you're not supposed to exist&mdash;officially. You don't happen to
know at what hospital he studied? Though we can easily find that
out."</p>

<p>"My dear Mr. Brown, I've met the man at least three times! I
doubt very much if there's one fact of his past, or present life
therefore with which I'm not on nodding terms. Give me a moment for
reflection, and I can doubtless supply you with the name of the
patent food on which he was reared. As for your question&mdash;he's
a St. Thomas's man."</p>

<p>Pointer laughed outright. He had the laugh of a boy.</p>

<p>"Good. Yes, I think I can work that." But what it was that he
proposed to manipulate he did not say. He turned away, but Thornton
stopped him.</p>

<p>"A moment. Of course it's natural that I should be interested in
this case." He paused, as though really waiting for an answer.</p>

<p>"Quite so, sir."</p>

<p>"Do you think it's going to be a simple affair, or
a&mdash;well&mdash;complicated case?"</p>

<p>Pointer looked at him with an apparently absent-minded eye.</p>

<p>"Simple cases," he said thoughtfully, '"there aren't
many&mdash;presuppose a simple life, simple surroundings, simple
conditions. Say it's murder. Well, life nowadays is often so
complicated that when you take it&mdash;obviously, you take
something exceedingly complex. At least, that's been my
experience."</p>

<p>There followed a long pause.</p>

<p>"Then you think&mdash;here&mdash;that will prove to be the case?
I mean, you think that it's murder, and that there's more than one
person implicated, and so on?" Thornton spoke without turning
round.</p>

<p>"It's hard to say," Pointer answered. And so exceedingly
difficult did he appear to find it that he was evidently
disinclined to attempt the feat as he slouched off to the
summerhouse again.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER THREE</h2>

<p class="first">POINTER found the summer house still quite
deserted when he returned to it to continue his investigations.</p>

<p>Around where the boughs lay heaped, the flags looked darker than
on the other side of the house. Examining them, he saw that this
was due to the red tint of the mortar in this one place.</p>

<p>He pried a bit loose. From a phial he dropped a little ammonia
on to it. The colour did not change. It was blood, and fresh blood.
But such a rain as that of last night would have lashed the
bloodmarks off wood, let alone cement. So these, too, must have
been made after that short, fierce storm. Yet the tiles here were
as clean as elsewhere. There was but one explanation. The tiles had
been wiped, but in the deeper cracks of the mortar the blood had
remained.</p>

<p>He pushed open an arched, ornamental door that had no lock.
Behind it he found a mass of broken geraniums and pots.</p>

<p>The damage was recent, not more than twenty-four hours old.</p>

<p>All around the house, except on the side that interested him,
the side below the smudged balustrade, were similar pots set close
in against the walls and outlining the paths to the four doors.</p>

<p>Behind another door Pointer found a bag labelled Fertiliser, and
some gardener's tools. Out of an iron stove in the middle he fished
a piece of sacking that had been used as a floor-cloth. It was
smeared with blood, and spots of what he first took to be earth,
but which he found differed from the earth around. Then he guessed
it, rightly, to be fertiliser spilled in the afternoon by the
gardeners, a little of which had got blown against the house in
between the pots, and so escaped the downpour.</p>

<p>Pointer stared at the sacking. It was soaked with blood. But
whose blood?</p>

<p>Not Rose Charteris's. There was far too much here for that.
Besides, this had taken place after the rain. Nothing is more
misleading as to the amount of damage done than bloodstains. But
even so, this must have been a formidable affair.</p>

<p>Besides the sacking, he found a mass of what might be the
remains of six or seven more flower pots, but so ground to powder
were they, so trampled the plants, that it was impossible to count
them. They told one thing plainly. The paving outside had been
washed. Not so these broken remnants. They were soaked with blood,
trampled into it.</p>

<p>He cut away a corner of the sacking and dropped it into an
indiarubber envelope. He added to his bag a couple of lengths of
cord, very stout, and of a kind new to him in colour and
texture.</p>

<p>He heard steps on the gravel path. He had replaced everything as
he went along, and now lit his pipe and waited.</p>

<p>It was Bennet, the under-gardener, and a boy wheeling a barrow.
They began to collect the branches.</p>

<p>"You prune so late?" Brown pointed to the almost stripped
thorn.</p>

<p>"The master he thinks the trees at the doors want thinning. Done
it before we got to work this morning." Bennet gave a wrathful
sniff.</p>

<p>"Must have lost his head over that terrible accident," Brown
mused aloud. "I'm staying with Mr. Thornton at his cottage.
Colour-printing is my trade. His niece's death must have upset the
old gentleman."</p>

<p>"It couldn't upset him beforehand," retorted the gardener. "Not
beforehand! And I must say he made thorough job of it all right.
Killed the old tree, that's what he's done. Murdered it! And then
fell off the ladder on top of them pelargoniums. Collected them in
a lump just on purpose, he says, so as not to damage 'em. And then
went down bang on top of the lot. Nose bled; too, he says. I don't
wonder. Next time he'll leave it to those as understands the job,
let's hope."</p>

<p>"Fond of gardening, is he?" Brown struck in wheezily "That's
like me. I like to do a bit that way myself."</p>

<p>"Fond? Not beyond seeing as there isn't a stray leaf, and that
the flowers come up to time. They mustn't be late for parade, or he
wants to know the reason why." Bennet began to help the boy to pick
up the broken pots inside. "Just look at 'em." The gardener was
almost in tears. "I think he's going dotty, lately, that's my
opinion. I wouldn't stay on, not if he asked me."</p>

<p>"Leaving, eh? The colonel hard to please?"</p>

<p>Bennet straightened himself with some difficulty.</p>

<p>"I was fourth gardener at Welbeck," he said with dignity, "and I
take it there's nothing in my work I aren't up to. No, he gave me
notice out of temper. Pure bad temper."</p>

<p>"Because some of the flowers didn't come up to time?" Brown
asked, with the tactlessness of the dull.</p>

<p>Bennet's eyes snapped.</p>

<p>"I've told you once already that I know my job, thank you. The
colonel gave me notice because he lost a telegram, or a letter. He
called it first one, then the other. Couldn't find it, and said it
must have blown out of the window. I'm not a betting man. I'm not
interested in tips. He would have it that I'd picked it up. I was
marking out some plots in front of his study. Later on, next day it
was, the thing turned up. Daresay he still was able to put his bit
on. Anyway he was ashamed of himself. I will do him that justice.
He apologised quite handsome. But I'm leaving at the end of the
month. He's getting too peppery lately. There's no pleasing him.
He'll order a thing one day and change it the next. Look at this
place. Yet just before he drove off he says that he wants nothing
more done here till further orders. Told me not to cart away the
broken pots. But I knows him and his little ways by now. This time
to-morrow he'll be raving because the rubbish has been left
here."</p>

<p>"Mr. Thornton'll miss your good lady. When do you leave?"</p>

<p>"Four weeks from this last Wednesday. I don't say that
if&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bennet was interrupted. He was wanted down on the grass courts
immediately. The colonel had left an order that they were to be
prepared for returfing, and it was a case of all hands on deck.</p>

<p>"There!" Bennet handed Brown back his tobacco pouch. "Thank 'ee.
Those courts was new sown last week. Mr. Cutbush won't stand much
more of this. <i>He'll</i> be leaving next."</p>

<p>Bennet hurried away.</p>

<p>Pointer mounted a short flight of stairs inside the house to the
landing where two doors opened, one on either side. He found both
to be prettily furnished bedrooms, and guessed them to be used at
times as an overflow from Stillwater House.</p>

<p>The left room he only glanced at. The right room detained him
longer. Some one had lain on the bed last night. There were the
marks of dusty boots on the flowered coverlid, and still an impress
in the crumpled pillows. He was a tall man and very light, Pointer
decided. His walking had been done before the rain. "Before the
rain" had come to mean to him by now "before the murder of Rose
Charteris."</p>

<p>One of the lace blinds that covered half the window was on the
floor. He found that it was liable to come off at a touch. The
window looked out over that side of the tiled surround where Rose
must have fallen. On testing it, the pear-shaped window latch gave
a nearly perfect print of a thumb and first finger. A long, slender
finger which had never been calloused by toil.</p>

<p>It was not Mr. Thornton's first finger and thumb. Pointer had
prints of those already from the back of a prepared notebook that
he had handed his host to hold for a second. He examined the ground
around the summer house while apparently looking for a dropped
pencil. He found no marks, except once that same hard-tyred wheel
mark which he had seen before on the short cut.</p>

<p>He thought of Mr. Thornton's cottage, which lay quite close.</p>

<p>Opening the gate into the lane beside it, he looked around him.
From that gate to where the lane turned into the high road to
London, Pointer saw the marks where a light little car had run up
and down many times about three this morning, judging by the depth
of the half-dried earth. He decided that this case was going to be
a shining example of how favoured detectives are in the British
Isles in the matter of damp. Seldom indeed is the ground not able,
and willing, to date some event for the investigator. He often
maintained that the work of his confrres in really good climates
must be much more arduous.</p>

<p>The little car had apparently been used as a shuttle. Four times
it had run out to the main road and back to the gates close beside
Mr. Thornton's cottage. It had been going light and had been driven
very slowly. One might have thought that someone was waiting? But
why not wait patiently? Why patrol that one little part of the
lane, now as close as possible to the Stillwater hedges, now as
close as possible to the other side?</p>

<p>Pointer, deep in thought, entered the grounds again, and decided
to have a look at the two garages.</p>

<p>The colonel's chauffeur was busy at work, but Brown asked for a
little petrol to take a stain out of his coat. He used his eyes
while he sponged. Then he went on to Red Gates. Thornton's
two-seater was out, but a big Bently saloon was there. Pointer lit
one of the lamps, as well as the electric light, and began his
examination.</p>

<p>The car had been lately and hastily cleaned. It certainly had
been out very recently, and as certainly after, not in, or before,
last night's storm. The wheel-discs still held marks of wet
splashings, but the mud was of a fairly thick consistency. The door
handles and steering wheel yielded no finger prints.</p>

<p>The criss-cross markings of the clutch showed sand, and a few
particles of what, fished out with a pin on to white paper, showed
under his magnifying glass as crushed flower-pot dust.</p>

<p>Caught in the clutch was a wisp of thin, black silk material.
Pointer laid that away in an envelope. So a woman had driven the
car!</p>

<p>The inside of the saloon had been swept out, also very hastily.
He found more sand, and more flower-pot crumbs in the corners under
the seats. There, too, far back, he found a pencil, not much used,
with a protective metal tip. It was a French make.</p>

<p>He found the oddest thing last of all.</p>

<p>Two marks like little horse shoes, side by side, showed on the
gray cloth upholstery. One pair at the top of the window, but a
little to one side. One pair was overhead.</p>

<p>Pointer studied them They were reddish brown in colour. He
decided that they had been made by a pair of men's boot heels. The
stains showed under his magnifying glass to be of the same horrible
blood and fertilise mixture which he had found on the sacking, and
which he believed he had found on the swab taken from the cut on
Rose's head.</p>

<p>The two marks were close together each time, all but touching.
That told its own tale. The man's feet had been bound&mdash;lashed
together. His hands must also have been tied, or those convulsive
efforts to free himself, to kick open a window, or the carriage
top, of which the marks told, would have been accompanied by some
torn cushions. But their very cording was intact. Down by the door
he found a few bloodstains, very small, but still damp. Judging by
the height of the heel marks, a man of about the same size as the
man who had lain on that bed in the summer house had been carried
in this car last night.</p>

<p>Pointer felt his pulses quicken. His intelligence rose to meet
the puzzle like a good horse at a stiff fence. But for the moment
he reined it back. He thought of that to-and-fro driving of the
little car in the lane outside. Suppose that a large car, such a
car as this, had passed out first along the lane, and then suppose
that the little car, such a car as he had seen in the Colonel's
garage a few, minutes ago, and of which he had the particulars in
his notebook&mdash;suppose this little car had taken up the work of
destroying the marks made by the large car in the soft earth?</p>

<p>Yes. Pointer decided to suppose just that.</p>

<p>When Thornton drove back to Red Gates, he found that obvious
failure in life, his colour-printer, waiting on his doorstep with a
wilting bunch of primroses in his hand.</p>

<p>Pointer followed him into the cottage, and at the suggestion in
the other's rheumy eyes, Thornton closed the window.</p>

<p>"Now, sir, there are many things I haven't had time to ask you
yet. How did Miss Charteris come to be living with her uncle?"</p>

<p>Thornton explained that the colonel being poor, and the
professor wealthy, the latter had taken over a wing of his
brother-in-law's house, and helped materially with the expenses.
That had been going on for some years now, and seemed to work
excellently. He himself was a friend of the professor's, and had
taken Red Gates because of that.</p>

<p>Pointer went back to yesterday, the last day of Rose's short
life, and had Thornton run the events over to him as far as he knew
them. The evening's alarm interested the detective-officer
especially.</p>

<p>"Then, as I understand it, sir, all you four gentlemen were
playing cards from nine to close on twelve?" Thornton nodded.</p>

<p>"Whist or bridge, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Mahjong parts of the time, and bridge the rest of the
evening."</p>

<p>"Could you give me an idea of how long the mahjong lasted. You
see, I like to get even the smallest details clear in my mind,
especially as far as time goes, then, when new facts come in, I can
place them where they belong."'</p>

<p>Again Thornton nodded.</p>

<p>"Mahjong was over by a little before ten. It struck the hour as
we got out the cards."</p>

<p>"And there were absolutely no other visitors except one lady at
Stillwater House yesterday?"</p>

<p>"I don't see how there could have been, unless they were fasting
experts. I saw nobody at meal times.</p>

<p>"Has this Lady Maxwell been down here before?"</p>

<p>"To Stillwater House? Not as long as I've been here; that's
nearly six months now."</p>

<p>"Do you know her at all?"</p>

<p>Thornton gave his rather sardonic smile.</p>

<p>"Oh lor', yes! She's a widow of some worthy baronet or other.
Quite well known. Absolutely no good an object of suspicion, I
should say, Chief Inspector."</p>

<p>Pointer looked hard at his boot-tips.</p>

<p>"Brown, if you please, sir. Even when the house is empty as now.
I suppose you haven't noticed any change at Stillwater House
lately&mdash;no one has seemed to act in any way differently from
usual? Colonel Scarlett, for instance, to take him first?"</p>

<p>Thornton looked uneasy. He adjusted his glasses</p>

<p>"It's rather an unpleasant feeling, being asked anything so
important as that I mean, a mistaken impression on my part might
lead to such unforeseen consequences&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not so bad as that," Pointer comforted him with some inward
amusement. He never took any one's evidence quite so seriously as
they did themselves. But that was a secret between himself and his
Maker.</p>

<p>"And it's a most unpleasant thing to do. Report on a man who's a
friend, in a way, and my host&mdash;in a way."</p>

<p>"There's only one thing to be done in an affair of this kind,"
Pointer said in his pleasant voice, "and that is to sink personal
feelings altogether. Just act as a sort of gramophone disc. Just
record the impressions made on you. In every walk in life one has
to put one loyalty against another, hasn't one? Loyalty to justice
seems to me to be high enough to serve, even at the cost of a great
deal of discomfort."</p>

<p>"Then I should say that Colonel Scarlett has seemed to have
something on his mind for about a month or more back&mdash;at
least, that's my impression. The day before yesterday, Wednesday,
he certainly got a letter that disturbed him greatly, though he
tried not to show it."</p>

<p>"Exactly what happened?"</p>

<p>Again Thornton hesitated.</p>

<p>"You never know what trifle may not help," Pointer prompted,
"and very often it throws a light on some other person or event,
far away from the thing you're talking about."</p>

<p>"I suppose that's so. Well, a letter was brought in while we
were in the lounge, just before lunch. The colonel gave a start as
soon as he saw the envelope, went to the window, and tore it open.
When he turned around again, he looked very odd. As a man might
look who had learnt suddenly that something on which he confidently
counted had gone all wrong."</p>

<p>"Did he speak about the letter at all?"</p>

<p>"Not when I was present. He excused himself, and didn't see him
again till Thursday at lunch."</p>

<p>"He wasn't back to dinner, then? Were you alone with him in the
lounge when the letter was brought him?"</p>

<p>Thornton said that he had been.</p>

<p>"He's a racing man, I believe. Heavy backer?"</p>

<p>"I believe so, but as I never backed a horse in my life he
doesn't discuss those interests with me."</p>

<p>"Was it dark down here last Wednesday at noon? mean, was the
lounge so gloomy that the colonel couldn't have read his letter
where he sat?"</p>

<p>"It was a particularly bright day."</p>

<p>"Did you happen to notice the letter at all, or it's
envelope?"</p>

<p>Thornton had not. It was only the results that had struck
him.</p>

<p>"Now about Mr. Bond and Mr. Cockburn, they're friends of the
colonel, I believe?"</p>

<p>Thornton nodded.</p>

<p>"Yet you put them up?"</p>

<p>"I was very much surprised. And so were they," he added with a
faint smile. "As a rule, Stillwater House is a sort of hotel."</p>

<p>"Possibly this change in the colonel you noticed may have meant
rather a pinch&mdash;money-pinch?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't have thought," Thornton balanced a Persian tile on
his finger, "I shouldn't have thought that Bond and Co. could have
made much of a hole in his finances in one breakfast. An apple and
a biscuit is their usual way of beginning the day, I believe.
Always training for something or other."</p>

<p>"And the colonel on Thursday evening, did he seem like a man who
had another engagement still ahead of him? Was it he who suggested
stopping the cards?"</p>

<p>"No. I'm afraid my yawns did that."</p>

<p>"Do you think that shot in the lane surprised the colonel?"
Pointer asked suddenly, and Thornton felt more respect for him.
Possibly the man was not quite such a fool as he looked in his
rigout. Possibly.</p>

<p>"I think it did," Thornton said, "but I had an idea&mdash;just a
fancy&mdash;that he connected it with something in some way. I
mean&mdash;it's hard to explain&mdash;I think it suggested
something more to him than to the rest of us."</p>

<p>Pointer absorbed that for some seconds.</p>

<p>"I asked you just now about the other visitors at the house. But
perhaps the colonel might arrange to put up some acquaintance in
Medchester, or in one of his cottages? Say it was a business
matter?"</p>

<p>Thornton nodded carelessly.</p>

<p>"Doubtless."</p>

<p>"How about that house by the lake? Some one came out of it just
now."</p>

<p>"The Lookout, as it's called? As far as I know, it's empty. It's
generally only used when Stillwater's full."</p>

<p>"Yet the colonel didn't suggest it for Mr. Cockburn or Mr.
Bond," mused Pointer. "It's a trivial point doubtless. Is he on
good terms with them both?"</p>

<p>"He doesn't know them well enough not to be." Thornton's smile
was faintly ironical. "They're the merest club acquaintances of
his. They came down to see the professor."</p>

<p>But Pointer was only using the two known guests as a
stalking-horse for the unknown man. Unless Mr. Thornton was a good
actor, he knew nothing of that visitor. But Mr. Thornton had been
quite a star in the O.U.D.S fairly recently.</p>

<p>"You realise, of course, how important it is to make sure that
no unchecked-off visitor, or stranger, was near Stillwater last
night or early this morning?" Point explained.</p>

<p>Thornton's legs were crossed. The swinging foot gave a sharp
jerk. He uncrossed them.</p>

<p>"Quite so," he said evenly. "I quite realise that."</p>

<p>"Now the ladies, were they on good terms with Miss Charteris,
would you say?"</p>

<p>"Excellent." The reassuring word seemed to come out from force
of habit. "I mean, as far as I know," Thornton ended lamely.</p>

<p>"Just so. What dresses were they wearing yesterday at
dinner?"</p>

<p>"Surely you don't suspect any of them of being concerned in this
ghastly affair?" Thornton asked, with one of his quickly-veiled
glances.</p>

<p>Pointer did not reply.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Lane was all in pearl gray, as usual, a sort of misty,
lacey frock. Lady Maxwell wore a navy dress. Miss Charteris was in
peach colour, with silver bits on it here and there. Rather a
gorgeous affair. Miss Scarlett was in something dark, brown or
black, I forget which."</p>

<p>Pointer next asked whether Thornton could give him Lady
Maxwell's home address. She had left Stillwater the first thing in
the morning, so he had learnt from his couple of minutes' gossip
with Wilkins the chauffeur.</p>

<p>Thornton told him that she practically lived at Batt's Hotel in
London, and Pointer, thanking him, slouched off.</p>

<p>Once more he searched the lane, but he found nothing that could
explain the shot heard last night. He had no time, however, to
waste in hunting for what possibly did not concern the case at all,
when the things that did concern it were so numerous and so
baffling.</p>

<p>His first aim was, if possible, to stop valuable records from
being lost. Nothing had been burnt in the iron stove of the summer
house. Stillwater House had central heating, and gas stoves. Yet
Pointer felt sure that the body of Rose Charteris must have been
covered when it was trundled along in the dark. She was a tall
girl. He looked to find something of about six feet in length A
blanket, or a curtain possibly. Then, too, whoever had wiped those
flags, might well have left some marks on their clothes. He had
looked over the empty bedrooms of the lady housekeeper and the
master of Stillwater. He had found nothing suspicious in either.
Mrs. Lane's gray lace frock was immaculate. He decided to try once
more, and see whether Sibella were still in her bedroom.</p>

<p>As he passed up a back stair leading from the library he heard
some one moving about in Rose's sitting-room. Cautiously,
noiselessly, he set the door ajar.</p>

<p>It moved without a sound of latch or hinges, as he had already
noted.</p>

<p>Pacing up and down was a girl with straight black hair drawn
smoothly back from a pale, narrow face. He guessed her rightly to
be Sibella Scarlett. Finally with a little resolute squaring of her
shoulders, she walked towards the door that led into Rose's
bedroom.</p>

<p>That bedroom, where, in the darkness, a girl's body lay waiting
to be consigned to deeper darkness yet&mdash;never to see the light
again. Had the living cousin part or knowledge of the dead cousin's
fate? Was it through any act of hers that&mdash;terrible
thought&mdash;the flowers heaped around the bed were fading merely
because of what lay in their midst, were withered by one touch of
that skin, so cold, so white, still so fair?</p>

<p>Sibella walked decisively enough towards the door, after that
curious little shake of herself, but with her fingers on the knob
she stopped abruptly. Had Pointer been a believer in apparitions,
he would have thought that she stopped by something which she could
see only too well invisible though it might be to him. For a second
she struggled hard to throw off whatever banned her. She did not
succeed. Turning, she almost ran to an arm chair and sank into it.
She was out of Pointer's range of vision but after a few minutes he
saw her again. Walking with a lagging step, a picture of something
more than grief or depression, with compressed lips she passed on
out and down the main stairs.</p>

<p>A minute later and Pointer came up from the staircase where he
had retired and glanced over her bedroom. A black evening frock
hung in her wardrobe. He ran it through his fingers. It was
unstained. Then he bent over her shoes. From the buckle of a pair
of black satin slippers he shook out quite a teaspoonful of soft
garden mould. Dry mould. Not the dark fertiliser of the summer
house. This was plain earth, but of a light kind. There were no
stains on the soles and no particles of sand. He replaced them, and
drove in his battered car to Medchester station, where, as he
expected, he found the most deserted telephone booth in the town.
Over the wire he explained himself to Paul, and said that he had
had an accident with a tablecloth of Mr. Thornton's. What was the
name of the cleaners employed by Stillwater House? Paul gave him an
address in the High Street. Pointer telephoned there at once. No.
No parcel had been left from Stillwater this morning.</p>

<p>Next he got the number of New Scotland Yard, and was soon
speaking to Detective-Inspector Watts. He directed that officer, in
code, to have a look at any evening frocks of a Lady Maxwell, who
was staying presumably at Batt's Hotel. He was particularly to
notice a navy dress. Should any of them not be in perfect
condition, Watts was to bring the garment in question down himself
on a motor bicycle.</p>

<p>Pointer gave him the number of Red Gates, and went there to
await the report.</p>

<p>He hunted up Thornton again on his return, and found that gifted
author drawing Persian scrolls and leaves on his blotter, a pile of
untouched paper beside him.</p>

<p>This time it was Medchester's evening entertainment that seemed
to interest the detective.</p>

<p>So Miss Scarlett had driven Mrs. Lane off to the concert in the
little two-seater that really belonged to Miss Charteris, but which
either of the girls, or, at a pinch, Mrs. Lane, used.</p>

<p>"They can all drive, then?"</p>

<p>"Most women can nowadays," Thornton said easily.</p>

<p>"Yes, but how?" Pointer replied. "I don't suppose the colonel
ever lets them take out that big car of his?"</p>

<p>There was no reply.</p>

<p>Pointer drifted out of the room again. He felt that Thornton was
not a man in front of whom to drop a card and expect him to be
unaware of its suit.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the telephone bell rang. Mr. Brown was wanted
by a friend. The friend went on to say that he had found one of the
books rather dog-eared, and was bringing it down for him to look
at. He might, or might not, want it.</p>

<p>Pointer rang off and made his way to the handsome old inn in
Medchester Main Street. Smoking in front of the entrance, he was
hailed by a motor cyclist, who waved a kit-bag at him and followed
his slow steps up to a bedroom that Brown had just engaged.</p>

<p>There Watts spread out a dark blue silk dress with velvet
embossed flowers in high relief. It was one of those modern affairs
that can be drawn through a napkin ring and looked rather as though
some one had tried that experiment on it quite recently.</p>

<p>"Hotel sneak-thieves must get their living easy," Watts said,
standing back. "Lady Maxwell was out, so was her maid. I found this
in a package done up as though for the cleaners. I put something
else in instead. What do you think of it, sir?"</p>

<p>Pointer was running the soft material through his fingers. He
could find no stains, but he felt several stiff places. Turning up
the electric light, they showed as purple splotches.</p>

<p>He dropped a little guaiacum solution, and then a few drops of
peroxide on one place. Up rose at once a bead of a beautiful bright
blue.</p>

<p>"The stiff places are blood right enough." Watts folded up the
dress again.</p>

<p>"Humph!" Pointer said, and decided to keep the frock for the
moment.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when he drove up to a house in
Bayswater, where he shared rooms with a bookbinder friend. O'Connor
was his one real confidant, for the Irishman had done some
first-class work as a secret service agent during the war, and
Pointer could rely on his discretion. Just now he wanted to rely on
more than that.</p>

<p>O'Connor had a collection of pencils and inks unrivalled even by
Scotland Yard. The pencil that Pointer had found in Thornton's car
puzzled him. It made only a thick, oily smear when tried on paper,
yet it had evidently been used about one-third down.</p>

<p>O'Connor tried it on his thumb.</p>

<p>"It marks all right like that," Pointer said, "but it's a kind
I've never met before."</p>

<p>"I have." O'Connor went to a Wellington cabinet. He turned the
Chubb lock, and after a minute laid before his friend another
pencil.</p>

<p>"Try that, and see if it isn't the same kind."</p>

<p>It behaved in exactly the same way. The name, <i>Cos</i>
tallied.</p>

<p>"What sort of thing is it?" Pointer asked curiously.</p>

<p>"Writes on skin. French surgeons use them a good deal, I
believe, to explain to their students just what they're going to do
before they cut up a patient. I had a case during the war of a boy
with a message written or his back with one of these. That's how I
recognised it. And what's the meaning of your blowing in with this
implement when you're on your leave?"</p>

<p>"If you care to come down with me in my car to a town called
Medchester, I'll spin you a yarn. It's a hop, skip and jump affair,
or I would wait and have supper here. Just let me send off some
telephone messages first."</p>

<p>O'Connor doubled his long legs in beside his friend and Pointer
drove off for the Barnet road.</p>

<p>He gave the other a brief summary of the facts as they sped
along. When he got to the marks on the green balustrade of the
summer house, O'Connor struck. "You think she was killed there?
Flung off the top of that lookout?"</p>

<p>Pointer nodded "I do."</p>

<p>"Was she as lovely as the papers make out?" the Irish man asked
irrelevantly.</p>

<p>Pointer slowed up for a second and handed him a photograph that
he had annexed. O'Connor stared at it.</p>

<p>There is something infinitely touching in beauty, in spite of
all that saw or tale may say of its deceitful quality, the heart
knows better. Knows the contrary.</p>

<p>Knows that here before it is Truth, is Abiding Reality. Is a
message faint and dim, which the soul has managed to get through to
mind, or body, or character&mdash;rarely to all three&mdash;and of
which we see but the blurred record.</p>

<p>O'Connor handed back the portrait without a comment. He looked
moved.</p>

<p>"Glad it's you! You'll get him yet, or her! But what beats me is
why was the body moved? Sure it was a perfectly good accident. She
just overbalanced herself. I call it a capital murder. Why botch it
by taking her off to the sand-pit? It looks inexplicable, it does
that&mdash;so far as you've told me the story."</p>

<p>"And so far as I know the story. I found the carrier later on
which she was moved. It's practically a shed door mounted on a pair
of old-fashioned bicycle wheels. A man pushed it, a woman walked
behind, steadying it."</p>

<p>"A woman! It must be a woman in a million to stand in with such
a crime! And where's the motive?" demanded O'Connor, as though
Pointer had it in his pocket. "Jealousy, of course," he assured
himself, "though it's a bit carefully worked out for that. Yet that
might depend on the man&mdash;" His voice faded off into
thought.</p>

<p>"Now, Jim," Pointer said briskly, "that's the end of the links
that fit together, even though poorly. Here comes a jumble of odd
bits. And odd, they are!"</p>

<p>He told of the blood in between the wiped tiles of the broken
flower-pots.</p>

<p>"A fearful struggle must have taken place on that same side of
the summer house last night. But what sort of a struggle? The
plants aren't trodden into the earth, except a few found stuffed
into the stove. The rest were broken off horizontally. A lasso?
It's a fantastic thought, but so's the nature of the damage done.
You'd expect a powerful snake to leave traces like that, supposing
some one had tried to capture it."</p>

<p>O'Connor sat rigid.</p>

<p>"Another tragedy, or attempted tragedy?" he asked finally.</p>

<p>Pointer pursed his lips.</p>

<p>"You think it was the murderer and the girl herself?" O'Connor
asked under his breath. "Sure that would be a terrible thought! A
lovely young thing like that, struggling for her life within a
stone's throw of home, and help and then losing it."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it happened that way." Pointer looked far ahead
of him. "Apart from anything else, I can't think her face would
look as peaceful as it does, if death hadn't been instantaneous.
The doctors will tell us that at the inquest for certain, of
course, but I think she was looking up at the sky when the end
came. I'm sure I hope so. For bear in mind that the girl hasn't a
scratch on face or hands, except such as would be made by the
branches of a tree on one wrist, nor her frock a crumple bar that
cut-out place. But none the less, the fact remains that an awful
tussle of some sort went on close to where she fell."</p>

<p>"Could the struggle have come first, and she got away, rushed up
those outside stairs you spoke of, got to the top, and then been
flung over by whoever was after her?" O'Connor was intensely
interested.</p>

<p>"Then why didn't she cry out?" Pointer asked. "If it was some
one else, why didn't they shout for help? The damage looks as
though done by men. Footprints, as we mean the word, there are
none, but still... Now, as I see it, this is a sort of side-show,
for it took place after the murder, but it evidently occupies some
vital place in the mystery, or why is nothing known about the man
or his fate. To my mind, he is in all probability connected with a
letter that the colonel received at lunch on Wednesday, and thought
afterwards had blown out of his study window, and been picked up by
the under-gardener. Thornton spoke of the colonel's marked
discomposure when he read it. Suppose that letter, which so upset
him, was to say that some one, some enemy likely, was coming on to
see him. Perhaps it was a friend's warning. No post gets in at that
time. I take it it was sent by hand, though I haven't been able to
find out yet. Perhaps it was written by the man himself. At any
rate, let's say that Scarlett expects him some evening soon, which
is why he makes no move to put up any visitors, and, as I've learnt
from Maud, Miss Charteris's maid, was exceedingly annoyed that Lady
Maxwell was asked down by his niece for over the week-end. I think
he expected some one. And those marks on the flagging rather
suggest that he made his arrangements accordingly."</p>

<p>"Big man, I suppose, the colonel?" O'Connor asked.</p>

<p>"Fair. Bit overweighted, but quite powerful in an emergency. Now
as to the unknown himself, the murderer or another victim, I can't
see yet which he stands for. He lies down on the bed. Apparently
till a certain time, or till a signal is given."</p>

<p>"Ah ha! That shot!" breathed O'Connor.</p>

<p>"Seems so. Still, that lying down is odd. As far as time goes,
he could have been the murderer all right. But in that case&mdash;"
Pointer gave a short impatient movement to his head, like a horse
tossing his bit.</p>

<p>"The bits of cord you found pointed to binding," O'Connor said
thoughtfully, "probably to gagging also. Was the man gagged
immediately he stepped out of the summer house, was he bound,
nearly got free from his bonds and fought on a losing battle,
unable to call for help?"</p>

<p>"I doubt if any gagged man could have put up such fight.
Besides, if he could have struggled like that, he could have
loosened the gag. And then, what about the lateral break of so many
of the plants. You asked why the girl was moved." Pointer drove on
in silence for minute. "Well, there's only one easy guess, so
doubtless it's the wrong one. But one might think that the murderer
was seen by the man in the summer house. Knew that he had been
seen. Moved the body of that poor child to the sandpit just in
case&mdash;and carried off the man."</p>

<p>"How?" asked O'Connor.</p>

<p>"He was driven off in Thornton's large car."</p>

<p>"By Thornton?"</p>

<p>"Ah, if I knew that! But I don't, yet. All I know so far is that
the man was taken away in that car of his bound, and presumably
gagged."</p>

<p>"And how does the pencil come in?"</p>

<p>Pointer told him where he had found it. "I think it dropped from
some medical man's pocket as he stooped to lift out the man, on his
arrival."</p>

<p>"That's why you set your myrmidons on to investigating last
night's arrivals at all the hospitals and nursing homes of London
before we left?"</p>

<p>Pointer nodded.</p>

<p>"Why not try mortuaries?" O'Connor asked.</p>

<p>Pointer only shook his head.</p>

<p>"Unless he were already dead," mused the Irishman, "that cord
looks as though the man was not to be killed outright. Why? Pity?
Hardly. Something which he knew, and was to be made to tell?"</p>

<p>"Ah," Pointer nodded, "now you're making for the same place as I
am. Something, possibly, for which he's to be nursed back to life
in secret. And that's as far as I've got yet. And here's as far as
you get, Jim. An up-train's due in ten minutes. So long." And
Pointer unceremoniously dropped his friend, at Medchester railway
station.</p>

<p>It was midnight when he slipped out of Red Gates and up to the
big house again. He expected to find work enough there to last him
till morning.</p>

<p>At first sight it would seem likely that Rose Charteris's murder
was some act of mad jealousy. But the reason might be much more
obscure. The motive might not have spent itself with her violent
death. On the contrary, it might still be existing, still
operating.</p>

<p>He set to work on Colonel Scarlett's study. He had looked
through Rose's papers earlier in the day. They had given, him no
clue to her death. But they had brought out one strange fact. There
was not, one scrap of her father's writing among them. Pointer
found the same odd circumstance duplicated here. Yet Professor
Charteris had been gone from the place some ten days now. From a
<i>Sphere</i>, however, lying on an under-shelf of a wicket table
in the hall, he shook out a registered envelope addressed to Miss
Charteris in the same intricate hand which had marked some of the
professor's books in the library with his name and comments.</p>

<p>The envelope, a long linen one, bore an Italian stamp, and the
postmark Bolzano, Italy. The date was that of last Monday. On the
back, in accordance with foreign regulations for registration, was
the name of the sender A. Charteris, Hotel Laurin, Bolzano, Alto
Adige. It had been sealed with red wax, and was empty, save for
some dots, which proved to be black sealing-wax under his
glass.</p>

<p>Apparently that envelope was the only communication from the
professor that Stillwater contained.</p>

<p>That meant something.</p>

<p>Pointer was about to return to the study when he hear a slight
clink on the gravel outside.</p>

<p>Some one was trying the windows. Now Pointer had left one ajar
in case of need. He slipped behind a leather draught-curtain and
watched.</p>

<p>Cautiously the window was opened, and a slim figure entered.
Another followed.</p>

<p>"What do we do first?" whispered a voice nervously.</p>

<p>"Stub our toes," came in an aggrieved snap. "Flash the torch,
Co., for a minute."</p>

<p>"Seems all right," the holder of the torch said again "I'll
venture to turn on the light."</p>

<p>Pointer saw the first man move to the mantel-piece. "There's
none here now," he said in a disappointed voice.</p>

<p>"Let me look, Bond." The other strode across. "There may be some
in a drawer, but I'll reconnoitre before we start a hunt."</p>

<p>And Cockburn, with an acumen which Pointer grudged him, very
sensibly decided to begin his investigations with the thick curtain
on its leather rings.</p>

<p>Pointer immediately stepped out, an antiquated Colt in his
wobbly hand.</p>

<p>"Not another step, either of you! I'm a peaceable man, I am, but
not another step, if you please!"</p>

<p>Pointer's accents were those of a nervous man screwing himself
up by sheer resolution.</p>

<p>"What in the name of&mdash;here! Dash it all! Leave that bell
alone, whoever you are!" Bond called in a ringing whisper.</p>

<p>"I'm a peaceable man," quavered the voice, "but I intend to do
my duty. Now, not a move from either of you, or I'll fire all six
balls off at once."</p>

<p>"Good God!" Bond gave a half-amused, half angry snort, "are you
the village constable making a night of it?"</p>

<p>"Never you mind who I am! I'm a respectable man, as I can
prove."</p>

<p>A second time a reddened finger made for the bell, push, and
just missed it.</p>

<p>"Take your hand away from that dashed bell!" Bond fairly hissed.
"Look here! We're friends of the people in this house, but who are
you?"</p>

<p>"I'm doing a bit of work for Mr. Thornton of Red Gates cottage,"
Brown jerked his head towards the library behind him, "but what I
want to know, is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look here, Bond. Let's walk across to Thornton's cottage. If he
vouches for us, will that content you?" Cockburn turned towards the
blinking figure facing him. That worthy evidently considered the
proposition from every point of view.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sure I don't want to overstep my place. Seeing you
two come in like that... but, of course, if Mr. Thornton O.K.'s you
I've nothing more to say. But take hands, please, and walk straight
in front of me. I'm a peaceable man, I am, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up!" Bond's patience snapped. "And for Heaven's sake
don't let off those six bullets the first time you trip."</p>

<p>At Red Gates Mr. Brown made them precede him to the back of the
house, where a light shone reflected on the hedge of holly. Mr.
Thornton sat at his writing-table, but he seemed to be paying more
attention to Scotch whisky than Persian art, for the moment.</p>

<p>"Look here, Thornton," Bond called in softly through the open
window, "do you mind asking your blood-thirsty friend behind us not
to shoot us at sight, as he's inclined to?"</p>

<p>"Just assure him that we're not professional burglars, there's a
good chap," Cockburn added.</p>

<p>Thornton set his tumbler down hastily.</p>

<p>"Why, it's Mr. Bond and Mr. Cockburn, Chief Inspector. These
gentlemen are from the Foreign Office they&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Chief Inspector? Where?" Bond turned swiftly and gazed past the
awkward figure with the pistol in his hand. Seeing nothing, he
stared hard at his captor.</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;oh, good egg!"</p>

<p>"C.I.D.!" came from Cockburn in tones of rapture.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord, that's torn it!" Thornton smote his breast as
Pointer, gazing at him more in sorrow than in anger closed the
window, and drew down the blinds.</p>

<p>"I apologise for the slip in forty different positions, but the
surprise&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Amateurs will be amateurs, sir." Pointer dropped lightly into a
chair. "But I must request that it be forgotten at once by
everybody concerned."</p>

<p>"Then we were right! And she <i>was</i> murdered!" Cockburn came
back to the meaning of the dingy man's presence in front of them.
"I caught sight of her first, you know," he explained to Pointer.
"I can't, seem to get the memory of it out of my mind." His voice
was husky.</p>

<p>Pointer immediately asked for an account of the findings of the
body and of last night's alarm. He asked a few fresh questions, and
sat listening intently.</p>

<p>"And you chose the colonel's study to-night, just why?" he asked
finally.</p>

<p>Cockburn took out an envelope, and from it two bloodied bits of
cord. Evidently some of the same cord Pointer had found in the
stove of the summer house.</p>

<p>"After the superintendent turned us down, we had one more go, at
the place by the sand-pit," Bond cut in, "before we went back to
town. And we came on these under the copse. Now, my father makes
ropes. That cord is Indian. I happened to comment on the same stuff
lying on the colonel's study mantelpiece yesterday. He said that it
had come around a consignment of Bengal chutney. So when we found
it near that sand-pit, and stained like that," he paused and looked
up at the ceiling, "well, we thought it was well to come on down
and have a look for the rest of it. The chief constable is a friend
of ours. Besides, we couldn't get away all yesterday, so we decided
not to lose another moment and come at night.</p>

<p>"But Scarlett gave the cord on his mantelpiece to di Monti,"
Thornton put in.</p>

<p>"Ah!" Cockburn sat up like a terrier that hears a rustle.</p>

<p>"Didn't you see him? The count wanted something to tie up the
tennis net at the inn. Said he must remember to get some string.
The colonel handed him a coil from the end of his mantelpiece, and
di Monti drove away with it in his car."</p>

<p>Bond flushed to the roots of his curly hair.</p>

<p>"And to think that I broke into the colonel's&mdash;oh, Lord!"
He buried his face in a whisky and soda.</p>

<p>"Di Monti! That's what we came to see about. I mean," Cockburn
turned a very, grave face to Pointer, "I mean that our breaking
into Stillwater House had nothing to do with any one there. Of
course, we know <i>they're</i> all right. But this Italian&mdash;I
never saw a crueller face. More pitiless. More hopeless to appeal
to. If Miss Charteris had angered him in any way&mdash;God help
her!"</p>

<p>Bond murmured his agreement. Thornton stared at the fire.</p>

<p>"What do you say, Mr. Thornton? You're the man on the spot. Do
you feel certain that the inmates of Stillwater House are beyond
suspicion? All of them?" Pointer asked in Brown's husky voice. He
had not dropped one of the latter's characteristics throughout the
interview.</p>

<p>Thornton shot him one of his unreadable glances as shook his
head vaguely.</p>

<p>"What was it that made <i>you</i> go over the top?" Bond asked
Thornton curiously. He could not imagine Thornton sufficiently
stirred to take the initiative in anything.</p>

<p>"Oh, just a vague feeling that I wanted a competent judgment on
the whole matter. To settle doubts once and for all. Mr. Brown here
is very kindly spending the last days of his leave with me."</p>

<p>"Well, I wish to Heaven that we could be of some use," Cockburn
said regretfully. "Isn't there anything we can do, Chief
Inspector?"</p>

<p>"Anything?" echoed Cockburn.</p>

<p>Pointer thought a moment. Any light thrown on Rose Charteris's
circle was all to the good. But friends of that same circle?
Thornton, for one, an actual member of it? And young men who
climbed into library windows?</p>

<p>"Are you staying for the rest of the night?" he asked.</p>

<p>Cockburn spoke of the Medchester Arms, but Thornton put his
second spare room and a Chesterfield at the disposal of the two.
His shed only held his own cars, but, as before, they could run
their Buick into the colonel's garage.</p>

<p>"Is your garage always locked, sir?" Brown asked Thornton. "I
left a notebook in your car when I came, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>Thornton ran his fingers into his pocket, but his expression
betrayed his amusement at Scotland Yard's brilliance.</p>

<p>"Here's the key. Yes, I always keep it locked. Wilkins has a
duplicate, if you should leave anything else behind you, and I'm
out."</p>

<p>"But what about us?" queried the two friends. "If we can be of
any use, we'll do anything."</p>

<p>Brown blinked at them.</p>

<p>"Then suppose, when the postman calls to-morrow at Stillwater
House, one or other of you could be on hand and get hold of any
letters that come for the colonel. I want them steamed open, the
contents copied, and the letters carefully closed to show no signs
of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look here, Chief Inspector, what do you take us for?" Bond
broke in stiffly.</p>

<p>"Sweeps?" suggested Cockburn hotly.</p>

<p>"No. Amateur detectives," Pointer said innocently. The two men
laughed ruefully.</p>

<p>"I see your point. Considering the prod it's just given us, I
may well. So we can't be of any help? Rank outsiders, eh?" Bond was
a trifle piqued.</p>

<p>"If you'll come out with me in the morning, and show me where
that shot seemed to come from, I should be very grateful," and
Pointer arranged for a meeting at eight.</p>

<p>"And now I think I'll get a wink of sleep." He left the three
together.</p>

<p>"I hope he's up to the work," Bond said gloomily. "Of course one
has to discount the make-up and those frightful clothes, but even
so, I'm not impressed with the quality of his brains."</p>

<p>"You don't need brains at the Yard," Cockburn complained. "Their
place seems to be generally supplied by something called
'information to hand'. With that&mdash;whatever it is&mdash;you may
do quite well. Without it, you're lost."</p>

<p>And the meeting broke up with a vote of lack of confidence in
the man who was apparently looking for the wink of sleep of which
he had spoken, among the colonel's chutney cases.</p>

<p>There were two of them below stairs. Neither was corded now.</p>

<p>Next morning Pointer found the three men from the cottage very
punctual.</p>

<p>"I was walking somewhere about here," Cockburn waved a hand
towards a clump of trees. "The shot came from directly in front of
me. But I'm afraid that I can't be more exact as to where I stood
at the moment."</p>

<p>"I picked up a matchbox yesterday morning a little to the left
of us." Pointer pulled one out of his pocket "Is it by any chance
yours? That might settle the place where you were standing when you
used it."</p>

<p>It was Cockburn's. He pocketed the little silver slab with
thanks. "I dropped it when the shot startled me. So it came from
over there." He pointed ahead of him. It was where, much farther
off, lay the sand-pit.</p>

<p>Now Thornton had indicated another direction in the account that
he had given Pointer. He waved his hand towards it energetically.
"Surely you said from over here!"</p>

<p>"And I thought you said this way." Bond took a turn at flapping
his arms around The three looked for all the world like signallers
at a first practice.</p>

<p>Pointer was used to this sort of thing from amateurs. Bond
finally came over to Cockburn's unchanging certainty as to whence
the sound had reached him the night before. Thornton, however, was,
or appeared to be, unconvinced. But as he had been so certain in
talking to the Chief Inspector, he could not be expected to change
now, if only to save his face.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER FOUR</h2>

<p class="first">A FEW minutes later that same morning, Mr.
Gilchrist, the Coroner for West Hertford, and incidentally the
Stillwater family solicitor, rang up Colonel Scarlett. He explained
that a letter had come for him from Doctor Metcalfe last night, but
that he had not noticed it till now. In it he learnt, to his own
boundless surprise, that the doctor refused to issue a certificate
of Miss Charteris's death without a post-mortem, which painful
preliminary would take place this morning, Saturday, before the
inquest.</p>

<p>Colonel Scarlett turned away from the instrument with a gray
line around his mouth. He was already pale enough under his tan. He
stood for a moment in deep thought. Then he walked into the
breakfast room, where Paul hastened to bring him the morning
papers.</p>

<p>"Look here, Paul&mdash;" The colonel paused. "Shut the door.
There's an infernal draught this morning. I want to speak to you.
It seems the doctor isn't satisfied about the cause of Miss Rose's
death. God only knows what he means by that. Now the inquest may
spread into other fields, and I do not want the professor's private
affairs needlessly broadcasted. You know how he would dislike
that."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. He would indeed."</p>

<p>"In his own way the professor is one of the cleverest of men,
but not in all ways. Dear me, no! Not in all ways. He particularly
desired that no word should get about of his having to go to Genoa.
I'll tell you why. Frankness is always best. My brother-in-law is
on the eve of concluding some very important and very delicate
negotiations there. One breath about them, and they are off. I may
mention that I, too, am financially interested in the matter, and
have a very personal concern in silence on the point. Now the
professor has unfortunately mentioned Genoa in a letter of his. The
point is, I do not want that town referred to at the inquest, or at
all. You understand? Italy, of course. He's in Italy. But not
Genoa. I know he would very much resent this. You understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I quite understand. Italy if need be, but Genoa not
in any case," Paul summed up. The colonel drew a deep breath as he
made for the library. Now for Sibella.</p>

<p>He had not seen his daughter this morning, or at all since the
dreadful news of yesterday. He sent up word that he would like to
speak to her downstairs.</p>

<p>He stared at her when she entered the room, and Sibella stared
back at him.</p>

<p>Each face showed marks that had not been there before. Each eyed
the other distrustfully.</p>

<p>"Things have taken a very unpleasant turn," the colonel spoke
without looking at his daughter, "very unpleasant. There's to be an
autopsy."</p>

<p>She stared at him without comprehending.</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;on Rose?"</p>

<p>"For God's sake, don't act the idiot!" snapped her parent. "On
who else, pray?"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;-" she passed her tongue over her lips,
"that means&mdash;?"</p>

<p>It was his turn to stare at her.</p>

<p>"It means that they want to know how she died. You know what an
autopsy is. They want to know what killed her."</p>

<p>Sibella sat speechless. She would have given a close observer
the impression of buckling on some armour.</p>

<p>"I see," she said finally. "I wish you would tell me what you
have heard about it."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything more than I have told you." The colonel
gave her the message that had reached him over the telephone. "But
the point is this, Sibella. Your uncle is in Italy; that's nothing
to do with Rose's terrible accident, but all sorts of questions may
be asked. The point is, I don't want Genoa mentioned."</p>

<p>"Genoa?"</p>

<p>Colonel Scarlett came close up to her.</p>

<p>"Understand me, Sibella," he said fiercely, almost in her ear,
"not a word about that town. Not a word! Italy, yes, and any place
you like, but not Genoa!"</p>

<p>"How can&mdash;"</p>

<p>Something in her father's face stopped her. He looked
ghastly..</p>

<p>"I shan't mention it, dad," she said gently, looking very
steadily at him in her turn. She left him with that to his own
thoughts, and his thoughts, after rather a dark-seeming interlude,
led him upstairs to Rose's sitting-room, and to Rose's desk, which
he went through quickly, but carefully.</p>

<p>He did not stay to read the letters, which, however, he took out
one by one and looked at. He was apparently searching for something
that he would recognise at a glance. He stood for a second looking
around him after he had closed the desk, but, unlike Sibella, very
unlike Sibella, his face wore an expression of satisfaction, of so
far, so good, before he turned and walked slowly down and out into
the grounds.</p>

<p>Medchester is not likely to forget the inquest on Rose Charteris
in a hurry. The proceedings opened quietly, with no hint of the
thrills to come.</p>

<p>Thornton, very much on the alert, with the face of one who has
not slept well, watched with considerable interest the man who sat
beside the local police superintendent. Mr. Brown had told him that
this would be Chief Inspector Pointer. The Scotland Yard man's look
of energy and poise impressed the critic. Thornton decided that to
start him would be one thing, to stop him quite another.</p>

<p>The first of the surprises came when Rose's maid deposed that
she had only that morning noticed that her young mistress was
wearing another dress under the knitted silk frock. What had been
taken for a loose lining was the peach-coloured evening dress that
she had worn on Thursday night for dinner. A few amethyst beads had
tumbled out as she shook the dress to rights. The frock was very
thin, low-necked, and sleeveless, and could easily pass for a
petticoat slip. But the shoes were the kind that Miss Charteris
always wore with the knitted dress, of stout gray buckskin with low
heels. Her stockings, too, were of a gray ribbed silk that only
suited the outer frock.</p>

<p>The maid did not know when her young mistress had left the
house, but she had last seen her about ten on Thursday night. Miss
Rose had then been dressed as she was when found. She had not been
wearing her beads. Miss Rose had been examining some letters in her
writing-desk.</p>

<p>"Examining? What do you mean by that?" asked the coroner.</p>

<p>"She had her writing-desk open, sir, and was turning them over
and over, as though there were one there she couldn't find. I heard
her murmur, 'Where can I have put it? What can I have done with
it?' But I don't think she rightly knew what she was doing at the
moment."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Miss Rose looked that anxious and upset, sir. She wasn't really
looking at the papers at all. I've never seen her like that
before."</p>

<p>"Like what?" asked the coroner impatiently.</p>

<p>"Like she was then," replied the witness helpfully. "She looked
to me, Miss Rose did, as though she had had a warning." The maid
dropped her voice.</p>

<p>"A warning?" snapped the coroner. "A warning of what?"</p>

<p>"Of her coming death," breathed the woman. "Oh, she looked
beautiful, sir. I've never seen even her such a pitcher. But when I
asked her if there was anything more as I could do, she stared at
me as though she didn't understand, and said she wished she were
dead."</p>

<p>"Eh? You asked Miss Charteris if you could do anything more for
her, and she replied&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"Just what I said, sir. She said to me, she said, 'I wish I were
dead!'"</p>

<p>The legal mind gave it up.</p>

<p>"And you?"</p>

<p>"I said to her, 'Whatever is the matter, miss?' And she said to
me, impatient, 'Oh, nothing&mdash;just everything!' And then I said
to her, I said, 'Has anything gone wrong, miss?' And she looked at
me, as she sometimes would, half-laughing, with her head thrown
back, and a little to one side&mdash;oh, she looked a lovely
pitcher!&mdash;'Everything, Maud, and nothing! What's the time?' I
told her, 'Just gone ten,' and she says to me, 'Ten already!' Then
she gave me a look as though she wanted to be alone, so I said
good-night to her, and closed the door. And I never saw her alive
again." The woman wiped the tears away.</p>

<p>"Now, going back to that phrase of Miss Charteris's about
wishing that she were dead. Did she say it lightly, petulantly? You
understand what I mean? Or did she say it as though she were in
some great trouble?"</p>

<p>The maid hesitated. "Sort of impatient. Sort of frightened, too,
though."</p>

<p>And the coroner could not shake her conviction that it had been
fear which she had felt, or divined, in her young mistress, any
more than he could her certainty that Rose had not been wearing her
string of amethysts when she last saw her.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilchrist shot his lips out and pulled the papers towards
him again. He glanced at Colonel Scarlett, who sat listening
avidly, the air of composure gone with which he had entered the
room.</p>

<p>"Well, well! Just the young lady's way of talking, I take
it."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir! Miss Rose had had a warning. She had been
frightened, underneath all her way of carrying it off. She had been
frightened!"</p>

<p>Sensation.</p>

<p>"Now to pass on to other things&mdash;had the bed been slept in
when you went into the room next morning?"</p>

<p>The question caused a stir, but the answer was explicit. It
had.</p>

<p>Sibella and Mrs. Lane were next called. Sibella first. Their
evidence was practically identical.</p>

<p>Sibella had not seen Rose after dinner. Rose was frequently out
in the evenings, with friends, or in town at play, or concert, or
meeting. As to her strange words to her maid, Sibella professed to
have no key, except that apparently some little trifle had gone
amiss. There was nothing really worrying her cousin. On the
contrary. Rose seemed to her particularly happy and contented that
last day, Thursday. Just for a second her eye met Thornton's. Just
for a second they fell. As to any letter for which the maid thought
that her cousin might have been looking last night, Sibella could
not hazard a guess. Rose had a great many letters. She generally
tore them up at once, unless they were business matters. She had
her own friends, as well as her father's friends, many of whom were
quite apart from the Scarlett circle. She could not explain how
Rose came to be wearing Thursday's evening frock on Friday's early
morning sketching expedition, even though it was under an outdoor
dress.</p>

<p>Count di Monti was next called. Those present who expected an
outbreak of Italian passion were disappointed. The Count looked as
impassive as a meditating Bonze.</p>

<p>"You were, I think, engaged to Miss Charteris?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It was to be announced on the return of her father."</p>

<p>"I may take it that there was no, eh, hitch&mdash;of any
kind?"</p>

<p>A rustle ran through the hall.</p>

<p>"In our engagement? Oh, none whatever."</p>

<p>As to when he had last seen Rose, di Monti replied that he had
said good-bye to her at Stillwater about six. He had an important
engagement in town that evening, or he would have stayed and gone
on with her to a concert which was being given in Medchester. She
had said that as he was not going, she did not care to go
either.</p>

<p>There was a movement of sympathy at this announcement. But di
Monti's arrogant gaze roamed the hall without softening. If it
lingered for a second on one face, only a very keen observer
noticed it. If Sibella felt it on her, she gave no sign.</p>

<p>"Can you suggest any meaning, any point to those words Miss Rose
used to her maid last Thursday, night?"</p>

<p>Di Monti could not. But he had often heard Rose use just such
expressions many times before, about the merest trifles.</p>

<p>As to the beads which Rose had been wearing, or was supposed to
have been wearing when she met with her death, di Monti absolutely
scouted the idea that they could have tempted any tramp to murder
her for their sake.</p>

<p>He seemed, indeed, so anxious to minimise their value that
Pointer looked at him curiously. Even to the pendant, he refused to
allow any interest, intrinsic or sentimental, to be attached,
though he acknowledged that it was a present to her from his
father.</p>

<p>Then came the great sensation.</p>

<p>Doctor Metcalfe was called. He was very honest. He said at once
that he had been mistaken in his first impression as to the cause
of Miss Charteris's death. He had assumed, too quickly, as he now
knew, that that cause was a fall into the sand-pit on to some
stones. Fortunately another medical man from his aid hospital who
had chanced to drop in for a casual chat had heard of the death,
and had been struck by one or two of the details.</p>

<p>A swab taken by them both from the cut in the head showed earth,
but no sand. The superficial sand first noted was only on the
surface of the hair.</p>

<p>It was for this reason that he had withheld the death
certificate, and had decided that it was his painful duty to hold
an autopsy, which had taken place that morning.</p>

<p>He passed around a swab to the coroner which had been taken from
the cut.</p>

<p>A low murmur of amazement swept through the hall. Pointer's eyes
were on the little knot of faces seated almost in front of him.
Colonel Scarlett was staring at the doctor with a look which even
the Scotland Yard expert could not decipher. He showed no emotion,
yet there was a something about his mouth that spoke of tension,
great but controlled. Mrs. Lane might have been an ivory statue, as
she leant far back in her chair. Sibella's eyes shone like green
lamps. She looked, not at the doctor, but just once at di Monti,
and then resolutely down at her clasped hands Pointer could almost
feel the effort she was making to keep them fastened there&mdash;in
safety.</p>

<p>The doctor realised the sensation which he had created "I deeply
regret to make such a statement. Had I been able to reach you, sir,
yesterday, on the 'phone, or Colonel Scarlett as the nearest
relative, I would have let you know."</p>

<p>Superintendent Harris, very red in the face, hastily scribbled a
line and passed it to the coroner.</p>

<p>"The police would be obliged if you would adjourn the
inquest."</p>

<p>The coroner nodded. But he found that to stem the doctor just
then would have meant carrying him bodily out of the building. He
submitted, he insisted on submitting that Miss Charteris had been
killed by a single blow from such a weapon as, for instance, a
sharp-edged cudgel. There had been no struggle. Death had been
instantaneous. There was a tear in the back of her dress where it
must have caught on a branch as she fell among the trees in the
copse. The force of the blow had broken her neck. Then her body had
been thrown into the sandpit close at hand.</p>

<p>On this second examination, made in company with his learned
colleague, he had found, lying beside the body on the bed at
Stillwater House, some twigs and leaves from her relaxed fingers.
These, too, he passed to the coroner, who was sitting without a
jury.</p>

<p>The presence of these leaves proved, the doctor pointed out,
that it was in the copse that the actual murder had taken place,
for in the pit there were no trees or shrubs. And there was one
thing more which the doctor could not be prevented from saying, and
that was, that he was by no means sure of the time of her death. It
was possible, or rather probable, that it had taken place earlier
by far than he had at first assumed. Certain indications, indeed
suggested considerably before, rather than after, midnight.</p>

<p>But this was going too far, and the coroner adjourned the
inquest in the middle of the doctor's next sentence. Doctor
Metcalfe's "learned colleague" tapped Pointer on the shoulder after
the inquest.</p>

<p>"My car's outside," he said in a low tone; "come along."</p>

<p>Pointer came along. The doctor whizzed into a quiet street.</p>

<p>"Did it go to your liking?" he asked gleefully.</p>

<p>Pointer gave him a reproachful look.</p>

<p>"Letting all the cats out of the bag at one bound," he
complained. "I can still hear them yodelling."</p>

<p>"That was Doctor Metcalfe's doing. Look here,
Pointer"&mdash;Doctor Scott was one of the divisional surgeons of
New Scotland Yard&mdash;"I deserve a treat for hopping down here
like a bird when you whistled for me yesterday. What's the real
story. What do you see behind all this, eh?"</p>

<p>"I see a case that you and I know to be none too uncommon,"
Pointer replied, looking at his boot tips. "I see a case that
may&mdash;likely as not&mdash;end in a 'No thoroughfare.' Where the
Yard is sure of their man, but can't get evidence enough to send
him&mdash;or her&mdash;for trial. You know how often that happens,
and the public begin heaving rotten eggs. But you can't manufacture
evidence&mdash;at least, the Yard doesn't, and you can't invent a
motive&mdash;again, we don't in the force. And yet, if one has to
sail out into the unknown&mdash;unguessed&mdash;" He was talking to
himself.</p>

<p>"Even so, you'll make port with a fine cargo," the doctor said
confidently. "But I see that you don't intend to spill any
beforehand. You asked me to drop you at the police station. Here we
are. So long, till the next time you want me to swindle a brother
medico into thinking me a Doctor Thorndyke!"</p>

<p>Pointer was shown into Superintendent Harris's room. The two
were old friends. Pointer had served under him when he was first
sent to London as a young police man.</p>

<p>"So there's murder to pay!" Harris said very soberly. "Thank
God, you're here, Alf! Makes it seem like old times, my lad. Though
I ought to call you 'sir,' of course!"</p>

<p>"You try it, if you think it safe!" Pointer said fiercely. For a
second Harris gave his genial laugh, then his face clouded
swiftly.</p>

<p>"Murder! Terrible word to use about our Miss Charteris. The
town's been proud of her. Proud of having a great London beauty
living here, and proud of her father, the professor, too. Murder!"
He shook his grizzled head, and crossing to a cupboard, took out
couple of glasses, a siphon, and a bottle. "Say when!"</p>

<p>Pointer said it before the cork was drawn.</p>

<p>"I don't mind telling you," Harris went on, "that when I got my
breath after the doctor's evidence, and knew you were there on hand
in case the Yard was asked to take over, I said to myself, 'Saved!'
Yes, that's what I said. The flesh may be willing, but the spirit's
a bit weak&mdash;like this in the bottle."</p>

<p>Pointer looked uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"You're pulling my leg, Harris!"</p>

<p>"Fact, Alf," the superintendent said solemnly. "I got along
quite nicely with a tramp now and then, an gippies, and drunks of a
Saturday night. And once we had a missing gal, but this isn't that
sort of, thing. This'd be my ruin. I'm due to retire in a month,
and I want to go out at peace with my neighbours as far as may be.
I'd do my duty, of course, but it's making a hash of that same duty
I can't stand, and turning my old friend upside down, only to find
that the criminal was perhaps miles away all the time. Why, Alf,
that cottage the Wife and I are moving into belongs to Colonel
Scarlett. And then this here foreign nobleman&mdash;no, no! We'll
finish this, and another like it, or at least I will, and then
we'll up and along to the chief. He's down with the flu, but I
slipped out and telephoned him the news during that surprise
inquest. He'd be having a heart to heart talk with the Yard at this
moment, and sending you S.O.S.'s by the hatful if you weren't here.
I call it sheer Providence."</p>

<p>So Major Vaughan seemed to think, and Pointer and the
superintendent were making their way out to the former's car, after
a pleasant interview with the sick man, when Colonel Scarlett
almost bumped into them on the top step. Superintendent Harris
introduced Pointer.</p>

<p>"So New Scotland Yard's taking over. I'm thankful to know the
case will be in such thorough hands. Though I fancy there's nothing
very deep about the terrible affair. Those beads and a passing
tramp, I think. Some garnet on the pendant and the snap looked just
like uncut rubies to any eye but an expert's, and the setting,
though silver might have been taken for platinum. However, you'll
find out all about that. I only came to hear how my old friend the
chief constable is getting on. I suppose you'd want to ask us all
some questions up at my house, Chief Inspector? I'll telephone them
to have the library ready for you, and I'll be there myself in a
few minutes."</p>

<p>He passed into the house, and the two men drove off.</p>

<p>"What's the colonel's reputation hereabouts?" Pointer asked,
after a short silence. Harris eyed him askance.</p>

<p>"Not going to start in by having trouble, with my future
landlord, are you?" he asked in half real, half assume
trepidation.</p>

<p>"He's not an easy man to read," Pointer said slowly. "We gave
him a nasty jolt just now. He's anything but thankful that the
Yard's taking a hand. I wonder why not?"</p>

<p>"He's plenty of friends," Harris ruminated. "The Scarletts have
lived at Stillwater since they dispossessed the abbot up at the
ruins, and took the monastery land. He's none so well off. Had to
leave the Tenth Hussars because he found it too expensive. Some say
he's a bit grasping. I think myself, that rent for the cottage's a
bit steep, but take him all in all, he's very popular. Betting man.
Good eye for a horse, and yet never lands a winner. Odd, ain't
it!"</p>

<p>Pointer digested this, then he said briskly, "By the way, I'm in
possession of a set of casts of Miss Rose shoe-prints on that short
cut, and a drawing of them to scale. I'll leave them here, at the
police station. If you'll take them on as your own, it'll save
bother." He began to unpack his bag in the inner room.</p>

<p>Superintendent Harris eyed the casts ruminatingly.</p>

<p>"Found on the doorstep? Or blew in by chance through an open
window?"</p>

<p>Pointer told him of Thornton's message, and his arrival, as
Brown. Harris was amused.</p>

<p>"And the chief telling you kind as father who everybody was.
You're deep, Alf! But this sets Mr. Thornton, at least, in a good
light, doesn't it?" Harris had a most undetective-like eagerness to
see his neighbours in a good, or at least a satisfactory light.</p>

<p>"Humph, seems so. But possibly he was rushed by those friends of
his, 'Bond and Co.,' as he calls them."</p>

<p>"Ah, there's that, of course They did rather take the lead. And
what's that other parcel you're getting out for me?"</p>

<p>"This is Lady Maxwell's evening dress that she wore on Thursday
at dinner at Stillwater House."</p>

<p>"Anything wrong with it? It looks all right to me."</p>

<p>Pointer gave a demonstration by artificial light.</p>

<p>Harris drew a deep breath as the splotches showed. "Isn't this
pretty conclusive?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know yet," Pointer said frankly, "and the rest of what
I don't know about this affair I'll tell you and Inspector Rodman
this evening. It'd take too long now. This Lady Maxwell is being
watched, of course. But I want to speak to the inspector a moment.
Ah, here he is."</p>

<p>Pointer had liked the keen, smart look of that police officer at
the inquest He gave him his instructions in a few sentences. The
frock was to be returned to its owner, and at the same time as much
information as possible was to be obtained.</p>

<p>Pointer and Harris drove off separately.</p>

<p>Pointer did not hope for much from the questions at Stillwater
House. That part of the work seemed to him what asking a patient to
put out his tongue was to the old-fashioned doctor, something
expected on both sides; a sort of preliminary canter. Not by
sitting asking questions would the real bones of Rose Charteris's
murder be laid bare, of that he felt quite sure. Yet a few useful
items might be collected. He left that part, for the moment, to
Superintendent Harris, for he had to go to town to see the head of
Scotland Yard, and be formally invested with the case. But first he
stopped at Mr. Gilchrist's and had a short interview with him. Then
after an equally brief interview with the assistant commissioner of
New Scotland Yard, he made for 17 Upper Brook Street, Professor
Charteris's town address, outside of which Watts was already
waiting.</p>

<p>They came, as two solicitor's clerks, armed with letter from
Gilchrist to take away some papers of the professor's which were
wanted for the adjourned inquest.</p>

<p>The manservant showed them up to the first floor and opened a
door.</p>

<p>The detectives examined the professor's three room with care.
Pointer came to rest before a semicircle of tobacco-shreds behind a
tobacco jar.</p>

<p>"That wasn't done by filling a pipe. Looks as if some one had
stirred that Shiraz like a Christmas pudding within the last
twenty-four hours. For they're fresh." He passed on. "Letter-book
of the Professor's missing unless his secretary took it with
her."</p>

<p>Pointer turned to the book-shelves and pointed.</p>

<p>"Five books upside down in one batch." Watts stepped over to
them. "Been lifted out in lots apparently."</p>

<p>Pointer clapped the boards together of a couple taken out at
random. They seemed to be unusually dust free. Much more so than
the furniture, or the carpet, would have suggested. He rang the
bell.</p>

<p>"Look here. Has the professor's secretary been in these rooms
lately? A book is missing that we were sent to fetch."</p>

<p>The man shook his head.</p>

<p>"She left before the professor. Some ten days ago, that
was."</p>

<p>"But some one was in here lately. Yesterday or the day
before?"</p>

<p>The man raised a mildly surprised eyebrow.</p>

<p>"Sharp that! You're right A young person did come to do some
repairing on one of the professor's rugs They're his own, and quite
valuable, I understand."</p>

<p>"Who sent her?"</p>

<p>"She came from Liberty's, I think she said. Anyway she brought
me a visiting card of the professor's, with instructions to let her
mend the carpet in front of the sitting-room hearth, which I did. I
didn't stay in the room, of course, but I was in the hall when she
went out. She had nothing in her hand but the little sewing-bag she
brought."</p>

<p>"What was she like?"</p>

<p>"Seemed the usual sort of sewing woman to me. Middle-aged, stout
party. Not the kind to notice much. Dark-skinned, very."</p>

<p>"And the hour? Mr. Gilchrist'll want to know all about
this."</p>

<p>"She came shortly after eight. Most unusual time, but being a
foreigner&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And she left&mdash;about when?"</p>

<p>"Close on nine. I was just carrying in breakfast to a very
punctual gentleman."</p>

<p>"Got the card she brought?"</p>

<p>The man said that she had kept that.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll have another look. It doesn't sound as though she
could have taken anything," Pointer finally. He looked at Watts as
the door closed. "That settles the tobacco, I fancy."</p>

<p>"Was the point of any importance, sir?" Watts asked.</p>

<p>"I think so. That spilt tobacco looks as though the woman had
been hunting for something which she thought might have been
deliberately hidden in these rooms. Not merely for something which
might have been in professor's possession. And now let's go through
correspondence. I want, first of all, anything that will have
arrived within the last few weeks that looks important or
interesting. Next, I want anything that may give a clue to his
whereabouts. Italy is a bit large, and a post-mark isn't much to go
by."</p>

<p>They found nothing definite. Pointer made up a packet of
"possibly wanteds," and dropping Watts at the Yard, returned to
Medchester.</p>

<p>He drove back deep in thought. He had already a very fair idea
of how and when the murder was committed. He had something more
than a suspicion as to one man in Rose's circle. But the
accomplices? For there seemed to be accomplices. This search of the
professor's rooms had taken place at an hour when the man to whom
Pointer thought that the clues led most directly was not in town.
It might, of course, be unconnected with it. Professor Charteris's
correspondence had shown world-wide interests. He believed himself
to be in possession of at least one fortune-making discovery.</p>

<p>Pointer slowed down a while as he reflected.</p>

<p>If the motive behind the murder of the beautiful young creature,
whom he had seen, lying ready to have the coffin lid closed, was
connected with jealousy or with money, then the investigations
would easily enough be able to prove as much, and would be able to
prove nothing else. Where motives were concerned, Pointer always
left the obvious on one side at first. You did not have to be
afraid that motives would bolt for some earth before it could be
stopped. And if the motive were not obvious in this case, to fit
the man whom Pointer believed guilty, it would be a difficult one
to find.</p>

<p>Pointer thought of that room that he had just left. Supposing
the search there, and the murder at Stillwater to be connected,
what was the object that had been hunted for in the Professor's
rooms? It was something that could be hidden in a book as well as
in a jar. A piece of paper probably. Possibly a letter. But why
should it have been thought to be hidden?</p>

<p>Those words which Rose had been murmuring as she turned over her
letters last night, were they connected with this hunt? "Where can
I have put it? What have I done with it?"</p>

<p>The daughter killed. The father's rooms searched as soon as
possible after it.</p>

<p>Pointer had noticed the Airedale kept at the house in town. A
night attack of the position would have had to reckon with him. And
he looked a ready reckoner.</p>

<p>None of Professor Charteris's letters were to be found in Rose's
rooms or in Colonel Scarlett's study. Had they been taken? Stolen?
And their loss not yet noticed? Did some one think that among them
might be found what was sought for?</p>

<p>If that hunt of the Professor's rooms were not chance timed, it
suggested urgency. That suggested&mdash;</p>

<p>Pointer thought of the empty, long, envelope which had found
beneath the tea-table that had been in use yesterday. It came from
her father. "Brown" had had a chat with the postman. It was the
last letter that Rose had received from the Professor. Father and
daughter seemed linked by this search in town.</p>

<p>When Pointer arrived at Stillwater House he found the police
inquiries in full swing. Superintendent Harris had finished with
the servants, and the colonel, and was just about to ask Mrs. Lane
to come to the library.</p>

<p>Harris had learnt no new facts, but he told Pointer that the
colonel took full responsibility for Mrs. Lane. He had assured
Harris that he had had a personal recommendation of the very
highest with her, from the lady whom she had been a companion for
some years, as well as a life-long friend. The lady was the late
Mrs. Seymour, widow of a former Bishop of Zanzibar.</p>

<p>Pointer had watched both Mrs. Lane and Sibella Scarlett very
closely at the inquest. One of them must have played a part in the
strange drama of Thursday night. One, or both. He had been struck
by the fact that each told a story so like the other's. That the
younger, like the elder woman, had taken up an attitude of absolute
stillness and taciturnity, volunteering nothing, and striding all
answers to the barely essential; that the elder woman, like the
younger, would not dot an <i>i</i> or cross a <i>t</i> until she
had made quite sure to what words they belong. Yet the two were
essentially different characters. One would have expected them to
react differently.</p>

<p>Pointer pigeon-holed both under the heading, "Capable of
Anything." But the "Anything" of Mrs. Lane would he thought, only
be what she herself had decided on, after careful weighing of all
the consequences. Once she had made up her mind, he would expect
her to go on unflinchingly to the end. A dangerous type, in
connection with a crime.</p>

<p>Sibella's "Anything" would be of a different calibre.</p>

<p>Literally anything to which she was moved. Anything to which her
strange personality might incline. If Mrs. Lane could be dangerous
because of her energy, coolness, and courage, Sibella might be
still more so by virtue of her incalculability, and the smouldering
fires which he felt sure were deep within her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lane looked very composed as she sat facing him. She
answered all questions with more readiness than she had shown at
the inquest. But Pointer purposely kept to the same round.</p>

<p>Rose had not lingered after the dinner, which, on account of the
concert, had been at half-past seven. Mrs. Lane had not seen her
since she passed the drawing-room and declined coffee.</p>

<p>As to where she had spent the evening, the lady suggested that
doubtless Rose had spent it in her own room, as she often did. The
maid had seen her in the gray frock, Pointer threw in lightly. Upon
which Mrs. Lane suggested that Rose might have changed for an
evening stroll in the grounds or down to the village.</p>

<p>Sibella was next asked to come into the big, comfortable room.
She had nothing fresh to add apparently, to what she had said at
the inquest.</p>

<p>Pointer asked her finally whether Rose Charteris had heard from
her father lately.</p>

<p>Sibella said that her cousin had received a registered letter
from him, from Italy, only on Thursday. It had come while they were
at the tea-table.</p>

<p>Could she describe it at all?</p>

<p>Long and narrow. Red sealing-wax. Inside was a note for Rose,
and another enclosed letter.</p>

<p>Could she say what became of it?</p>

<p>Rose read the note, put it back in its envelope, an laid it on
top of some weeklies under the tea-table.</p>

<p>And the enclosure. Could she describe that?</p>

<p>It was another longish envelope, sealed with black sealing wax,
and with a name written on it. This Rose doubled in half, and
stuffed into the silver chain bag on her lap. Sibella thought that
both the writing and the name on this enclosed letter were those of
Professor Charteris himself, though she could not be sure.</p>

<p>She went on to explain that while away on his travel her uncle
would occasionally send any very private note or memoranda back to
himself in sealed, addressed envelopes. He generally enclosed these
to his secretary in town, but sometimes to Rose at Stillwater. As a
rule the accompanying note would merely ask that the envelop be
laid in a certain drawer in his desk, at either place where they
would accumulate till his return. But some times later directions
would request that the enclosure be sent on to some given
address.</p>

<p>Rose was very careful of her father's correspondence. If neither
the enclosed letter, nor the note to herself had been seen since
her death, she had probably destroyed the one&mdash;Rose rarely
kept letters&mdash;and had dealt with the enclosure as suggested.
Sibella described the first as being a half sheet of white paper
with some hotel heading a the top.</p>

<p>Pointer had gone piece by piece on Friday morning through the
paper baskets and dust bins of Stillwater House, on the plea of
having torn up some valuable instructions. He had the envelope, but
he had found no trace of any such letter to Rose, any more than of
its enclosure. He thought that Sibella, however, was absolutely
frank about the whole occurrence, whereas Mrs. Lane, when recalled
and questioned, though she confirmed the other's account, showed a
meticulous care to answer only what she was asked that suggested
caution.</p>

<p>Paul, too, had very much the same to say. But the colonel
professed absolute ignorance of the whole matter.</p>

<p>Sibella had hardly left the three police officials when di Monti
was announced.</p>

<p>Superintendent Harris glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>"He's to the minute. He tapped me on the shoulder coming out of
the courthouse, and asked for a word. So I gave him an appointment
for here and now."</p>

<p>Di Monti looked very striking as he strode into the English room
with its soft colouring, and stood in its cool spring light, he, a
creature of a fiercer sun and of far darker shadows.</p>

<p>His hair, with the waved, floating top locks of a Fascist shone
like black satin, springing up from his rather sloping forehead in
an impetuous push. His eyes, with the heavy lids, clear-cut like
those of a Holbein drawing, were as impenetrably black as ever. Of
that shade that never, lightens, never changes The harsh lips were
a trifle tense, the heavy jaw well to the fore. He carried himself,
as always, with a steel-spring erectness. When he sat, he sat as
though on wires.</p>

<p>"<i>Complementi, Signori!</i> I have come to speak to you about
something which, unimportant before, is now of great importance. I
think the maid was right. I know she was. I feel sure my engaged
had something on her mind, especially the day before yesterday. Her
last day." He closed on a tone of deep sorrow.</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir!" Pointer was all attention. So were the
others.</p>

<p>"She asked me if it were not possible for me to be with her on
that evening. That last evening! I asked her if it was to go to the
concert with her. She made me an odd reply. She said&mdash;the
words are, as nearly as I can remember them, but the meaning is
absolutely accurate&mdash;No. There is another place I am going to
to-night where I should have liked you to be with me.' I took it
lightly, 'A dance, eh?' She was fond of dancing, so am I. But she
only said, 'As you are not coming it does not matter where it is.'
I thought she was&mdash;piqued&mdash;I think you say&mdash;and I
talked of something else. But now I see there was another
explanation." He bit his lip and sighed "I tried to get her to say
more, but my intended&mdash;" Di Monti, as always, had been talking
with his hands as much as with his tongue. They now finished the
sentence for him with a gesture that said, "You know how hard it
was to make Rose speak when she did not want to." And they said it
quite easily.</p>

<p>"Who do you think she was afraid of?"</p>

<p>"I have no faintest idea."</p>

<p>"There was some talk," Pointer went on, "you must excuse me if I
pain you, there was some talk of a previous admirer&mdash;of a Mr.
Bellairs."</p>

<p>Di Monti shrugged his shoulders. "I cannot say what I do not
know. But the maid was right. I am sure that Miss Charteris was
going to some definite place, possibly to meet some definite
person, of whom she was in fear." He seemed unable to add more.</p>

<p>When he was gone, Pointer went up with Harris to Rose's studio,
an empty room above her bedroom.</p>

<p>"Wonder where her sketches are? According to all the evidence,
she was often out with her painting outfit. I want to see the
result of so much industry. It looks as though that one drawing we
have at the station is the only thing there is to show for the many
sunset hours that Miss Charteris was supposed to've been working on
the ruins. Ah, here's a sketch book! But only portraits. This one
of the count is distinctly good, eh?"</p>

<p>Pointer was turning over the leaves as he spoke. "Suppose we
take it with us and have a look at the ruins. I went yesterday as
Brown, and learnt that Miss Charteris was often there mornings and
evenings, including late on Thursday. At least, so a shepherd said.
Know anything of the old fellow?"</p>

<p>"He's worked for Farmer Mason for forty years. Excellent
character."</p>

<p>The scene by the abbey ruins that closed one end of the common
was charming. Over the bright green turf gray and white sheep moved
slowly along, browsing as they came. Above them, as though the
earth were but changed reflection from on high, gray and white
cloud swept steadily onward over another bright field, but deep
blue this time, and vast and airy.</p>

<p>The shepherd, brown and wizened as a prune, touched his hat to
Harris and looked keenly, at Pointer.</p>

<p>The superintendent opened briskly.</p>

<p>"Heard of the inquest?"</p>

<p>"Ay, master, I heard there wur to be one."</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure that you saw Miss Charteris Thursday
evening, here?"</p>

<p>"I be. About an hour after sundown. Coming after nine, it
wur."</p>

<p>"What was she doing?"</p>

<p>"Walking about. Taking notes of the moon on stones, like."</p>

<p>"You know that it's now thought that she was murdered?" Pointer
spoke for the first time. As he had guessed, the man had not yet
heard the real news of the day.</p>

<p>"Murdered! That young lamb! Missie murdered. Master,
you"&mdash;his voice shook&mdash;"you fair 'maze me."</p>

<p>"The police are going to know about everyone who had any
connection with the young lady. What about yourself? You've been a
bit free with your money lately, I hear. Bought some fruit trees
for your cottage, treated friends at the inn, and so on."</p>

<p>Pointer had made good use of yesterday afternoon. The shepherd
looked at him with his clear old eyes. "Police yourself, master?
High up on the roll-call likely?"</p>

<p>He nodded as Harris mentioned Pointer's rank. Then his mind went
off to the more important facts.</p>

<p>"Murdered!" he repeated to himself. "Missie! Ay, now I wonder,"
he stood marking circles on the grass with his stick, "I do
that!"</p>

<p>There was a little pause.</p>

<p>"I spoke naught but the truth when I said missie wur here night
afore last, Thursday night. She wur here ten and she wur here afore
that, but not so often as I may have led people to think, and never
of a mornin'. She told me that she didn't care for drawing herself,
but that her father he wur main set on it. So she slips me a
shilling, or a crown even, now and again, to say to any askers that
she come night a'ter night, and mornin' a'ter mornin'."</p>

<p>"How long would she stay?" Harris asked</p>

<p>"Long enough to hand me a bit of baccy or a summat, not
longer."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"She'd go on by the short cut as she came by, on into the
town."</p>

<p>"You never saw her go back this way?"</p>

<p>The shepherd shook his head. "Never. But come dark I fastens the
sheep up in their hurdles, leaves Bob in charge, and I goes down
for a bite and a sup before coming back for the night and all
around ten."</p>

<p>"And how often was she out here?"</p>

<p>"She started coming a fortnight ago last Tuesday, and she comed
twice that week, once the week after, and ivery even this last week
from Monday to Thursday."</p>

<p>No questioning could shake him as to his certainty on these
numbers.</p>

<p>"And you never saw anybody with her?"</p>

<p>"Never. But night afore last&mdash;Thursday&mdash;a gentleman
come up after she wore gone by, and glances this way and that,
looking for some un like, but he says naught."</p>

<p>"Did he go on, too, by the short cut into Medchester?"</p>

<p>"He come from theer, and went on towards Green Tree Farm."</p>

<p>That was also the direction of Stillwater House</p>

<p>Pointer produced the sketch book taken from Rose's studio.</p>

<p>"Is there any face among these drawings that reminds you of that
gentleman?"</p>

<p>The shepherd turned over the pages with a chuckle, Though he
shook his head at the trees.</p>

<p>"The branches of a noak, wi' the trunk of a birch! Eh, but she
wore in a hurry, wore missie. You can't do naught wi' trees in a
hurry. Longer than men they live, and they don't understand it.
Time means naught to them. They don't understand&mdash;" He
stopped. "Here he be." He laid a wrinkled finger on di Monti's
portrait. "At least, if this baint he, 'tis none of t' others."
This wind-up was feeble, but the old man would not commit himself
more definitely.</p>

<p>"I think it's he, master, but I seed un but the once. It
mightn't be he at all."</p>

<p>"You may have a chance to see the man himself before long. How
did he strike you? You've a good eye for a man, I dare say."</p>

<p>Pointer offered the other some tobacco. The shepherd filled his
clay pipe thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Carried his head like a bellwether, he did. Set his feet down
wi' a 'I lead you'm follow' sound to un. Ay," the old shepherd said
from a cloud of smoke and reverie, "he wore a finely clad
gentleman, to be sure, but he had a look to his face that night
that made me think horns, and hoofs, and a tail, would a been his
proper wear. Ay, master, it wore a look to chill you worse nor a
Jannivary norther. And hearing what you've told me on today&mdash;"
He broke off, and smoked another interval of thought away. "He wor
the only man Bob was ever afeared on."</p>

<p>"Bob?"</p>

<p>"My mate. My dog. Bob he barked and growled when the gentleman
come striding in among the sheep, for it wore latish, but he turns
and says summat to Bob in his foreign tongue that fair humbled
him."</p>

<p>"Foreign tongue, you say. Was he a foreigner, then?"</p>

<p>The shepherd ran a slow, bright eye over his questioners.</p>

<p>"Masing how the pollus has to learn from others," I mused.</p>

<p>Pointer and Harris laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, was he?"</p>

<p>"Ay, misters. The build on un would a told that. Ye don't get
bones, slender and strong, like that wi' us. Nor an eye cut that
shape. 'Tis the eye's cut that tells foreign blood in man or
sheep."</p>

<p>"What country did he belong to, do you think?"</p>

<p>"Frenchy, I shouldn't wonder, though more like Eye-talian."</p>

<p>"He didn't speak to you?"</p>

<p>"No, though he wore half-minded to do it. Ay, and more than
speak to one. He gives me a look from those black eyes of his as
though he would 'a liked to've flayed the skin off me bones to make
me tell him summat I wanted to know. But he thought better o't. He
can bide his time, can that young gentleman, and 'tis more than
thick fleece would be necessary to keep him from getting his teeth
into ye, if he wore so minded."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

<p class="first">POINTER left Harris talking to the shepherd and
walked on. The first house he came to was set back behind some
cedars, but it had two gates opening on to the common, and would
have been in full view of the ruins were it not for a deep bend in
the road and some tall trees. An obliging postman had told him
already that it was Mr. Bellairs's studio.</p>

<p>He swung the gate open and looked around him. There was no one
about. The windows, of the bungalow-like building were all
shuttered. Close to the front steps was a patch of grease and oil.
A car must have stood there a couple of days ago. The path was too
narrow for its wheels to mark the gravel; The knocker next
interested the caller. Some one had nearly wrenched it off. And
long ago. Pointer opened the door with one of his own keys.</p>

<p>The studio itself was a black and white and gold affair,
superbly lit from behind a gilt cornice.</p>

<p>In front of one of the four fireplaces a black rug made an
oasis, on which gilt Bergre chairs with thick black satin cushions
stood around a gilt table.</p>

<p>Pointer walked the black and white marble squares of floor
carefully, looking them over inch by inch.</p>

<p>He heard steps outside. Superintendent Harris had followed him,
and was breathless with shocked amazement at this infringement of a
fellow-Briton's castle.</p>

<p>"I'm glad the inspector isn't with us. You big-wigs of the Yard
are the limit!" He looked fearfully about him. "Not a search
warrant between the pair of us!"</p>

<p>Pointer swept a flake of black sealing-wax on to a sheet of
paper and examined it. It matched the other dots that he had found
in Rose's chain bag and in the empty registered envelope beneath
the tea-table.</p>

<p>Then he began examining the built-in cupboards. In one was a
black and gold Spanish tray set with gleaming amber glass. There
were peaches, and strawberries, and a few macaroons. A small
decanter with some Chteau Yquem, a beautiful crystal jug,
evidently intended for water, and a couple of glasses, finished the
preparations.</p>

<p>"I don't call that much of a spread," Harris said "Not for a
young lady, I don't. Just a bite for himself, I fancy. Nothing's
been eaten, I see."</p>

<p>Pointer thought that the tray showed a very good knowledge of
Rose Charteris's tastes. She never touched wine, she never ate
cake, and the fruit was perfect. But he continued his search
without speaking.</p>

<p>"Looking for anything in particular?"'Harris asked.</p>

<p>"Miss Charteris's portrait."</p>

<p>"Eh?" Harris almost dropped the tray.</p>

<p>"Well, a studio suggests a painting. So does an R.A.," Pointer
went on casually. "Suppose she was here to have her portrait
painted, that might explain that pretty, frock under the knitted
dress, and yet the fact that she didn't bother about shoes and
stockings to match. It's the only explanation that I can see. I
rather expect to find the picture damaged," he went on, half to
himself.</p>

<p>It certainly was. Some one had hacked at it till it hung from
the stretcher in ribbons, and then stuffed the whole behind a black
velvet screen.</p>

<p>Rose's face in particular had been cut and cut again. There was
something cruel about the way that the damage been done. It
suggested a ferocious pleasure. But nothing could undo the fact
that it was a three-quarter size painting of Miss Charteris.</p>

<p>In her pale peach silk frock with a knot of pink and the
camellias on one shoulder tied with silver, and another gleam of
silver at one hip, she sat in a gilt arm-chair, her white shoulders
coming up like a tea rose from gold shadows around her. One hand
toyed with a line of deep purple amethysts that ran around her neck
on to her knee. The men gazed long at it. Bellairs caught something
of a Rose whom even the superintendent had never seen. The young
face was turned up, a wistful, eager, inquiring gaze, and the
effect, considering the darkness even then about to close around
that head, was tragic.</p>

<p>Harris's eyes were dim as he moved away.</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem possible," Pointer said at length, "that the
man who painted this had anything to do with the murder of the girl
there on that canvas. No, it doesn't seem possible."</p>

<p>"Mr. Bellairs gave my boy Arty French lessons, and helped him to
get his first place in town." The superintendent spoke as though
that clinched the certainty of the young man's innocence.</p>

<p>"My boy Arty" lay with many another father's only son in one of
those corners of France that are for ever England, but to the
superintendent he still lived on.</p>

<p>"As for the picture, painted by Bellairs right enough, but
signed by&mdash;" Pointer began wrapping the torn picture in
paper.</p>

<p>"Signed?" asked the literal Harris.</p>

<p>"Someone learns of these meetings," Pointer went on, "and gets
them to open that front door at last. Then the canvas is chopped
up. Now I wonder who would be likely to do all that?" He looked at
Harris with a smile.</p>

<p>"Sort of thing one might expect of the count." Harris began to
think that he, too, might have distinguished himself in the
detective line.</p>

<p>Pointer was off again, continuing his search of the room. He
stopped before one of the windows by the side door. The pulley
arrangement was out of order. Some one had not waited to find out
which acorn, the black or the gold, would open the heavy velvet
curtains, but had jerked them apart, and the cords almost off the
eyelets. He looked at the sill and then at the other window-sills.
Only one showed those newly-made scratchings.</p>

<p>Stooping, he picked up an amethyst bead, and an opened link of
silver chain. He examined the catch of the casement window.</p>

<p>"Looks as if she caught her chain of beads on that as she jumped
out of the window&mdash;probably at the time that the Count was
performing his fantasia on the front door. I wonder how she made
her way home?" Pointer mused.</p>

<p>"I particularly questioned Maud about Miss Rose's shoes when she
saw her at ten, as you told me," Harris put in. "She says they were
quite clean."</p>

<p>"That means some one must have taken her home in a car. There
were no taxis going begging Thursday night in Medchester, because
of the concert. And, by the way, Harris, I wish you'd ask about,
and find out, who really saw Miss Scarlett or Mrs. Lane there, and
whether at the beginning, middle, or end of the entertainment. Try
Doctor Metcalfe."</p>

<p>Harris's eyes bulged his question.</p>

<p>"Oh, just as a matter of routine. Just to check off all
statements."</p>

<p>Harris made a note of it.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be Miss Scarlett, in any case, who drove her cousin
home," he assured the other. "She never drives at night. Too timid.
Mrs. Lane now, she likes a bit of a risk all right."</p>

<p>Pointer thought of the garden mould on Sibella's shoe-buckles.
But he went on with his work, testing each piece of furniture by
laying hold of the back, and shaking it vigorously. When he did
this to the table, a leg promptly parted company.</p>

<p>Harris, with a householder's feeling for another's property,
would have stooped with an exclamation, but Pointer grasped his
arm.</p>

<p>"Hold hard a minute. Your finger-prints aren't wanted, old
chap!" Pointer lifted the leg as though it were a blazing faggot,
and looked carefully at the break. It had been wrenched off the
table, and very recently. He tested it for finger-prints and smiled
a little as he looked at them.</p>

<p>"By the look of it, some one swung this around his head like a
club. Now let's see." He opened his notebook. "They're Count di
Monti's," he said after using a magnifying glass for some very
careful minutes.</p>

<p>"When did you get his?"</p>

<p>"This afternoon he took a glass of soda water. Remember? I took
care of that glass afterwards. So now we stand like this. We think
Miss Charteris was here because of her frocks, the portrait, the
fruit tray, and the marks on the window. We know di Monti was here,
and in a fury because of these prints. The other finger-prints
sprinkled all about so freely will doubtless turn out to be those
of Bellairs himself. And now I'm done here."</p>

<p>At Medchester police station they found that Inspector Rodman
had carried out Pointer's instructions very successfully.</p>

<p>Lady Maxwell had been informed that a navy evening frock of hers
had been found among some stolen property which the police had just
recovered.</p>

<p>The lady was both surprised and impressed by the speed with
which it had been traced to her. Rodman had merely told her that
"the force has its own ways, madam," with some inward amusement as
to exactly what those ways had been.</p>

<p>He wanted to know whether it had been as crumpled as now when
last seen.</p>

<p>Lady Maxwell thought that it had been shamefully treated by the
thieves. The maid thought that the ill-treatment had taken place at
Stillwater House. Between the two, of them, Rodman, listening
avidly, and putting a few questions now and then, had managed to
get a clear account.</p>

<p>The frock was quite new. Lady Maxwell had worn it for the first
time at dinner at Stillwater House on Thursday and torn it. As the
frock had cost some thousands of francs, simple though it looked,
she had gladly accepted Mrs. Lane's offer to send it for her next
morning to a woman in Medchester who did beautiful "invisible
mending."</p>

<p>After dinner, when she went to her rooms, her maid had folded it
up and laid it on the hall table for Mrs. Lane to see to in the
morning. And when the terrible accident to Miss Charteris decided
her mistress to hurry away, the maid found it still on the table,
but tightly rolled up in paper, and very crushed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lane, had come up herself a little later, and offered to
still have it mended in Medchester. She had pressed Lady Maxwell to
accept her offer, but that lady finally decided to take it to town
with her.</p>

<p>Its loss from the hotel had been discovered at once, but it was
believed that by some oversight it must have been taken to the
cleaners.</p>

<p>Rodman's explanation, such as it was, evidently cut short a very
promising triangular duel between mistress, and maid, and
cleaner.</p>

<p>"So we now know that the frock might have been slipped on by any
of the women in Stillwater House that night," Rodman muttered.</p>

<p>Pointer nodded. "Just so."</p>

<p>He proceeded to give the two police-officers a straight,
condensed account of what he had found yesterday morning at the
summer house down by the lake.</p>

<p>Harris said afterwards that if he hadn't had the presence of
mind to catch hold of his jaw it would have fallen off
altogether.</p>

<p>Even Rodman gaped.</p>

<p>"So those beads that were found by the sand-pit must have
tumbled out of Miss Charteris's frock when they lifted her body off
the truck."</p>

<p>Barns remembered the two brought him.</p>

<p>"Now," Pointer finished, "we want to find out three things of
almost equal importance.</p>

<p>"First, who was the man of the summer house. He was not of what
I call the Stillwater circle. That is, he wasn't the colonel, nor
Mr. Thornton, nor Mr. Bellairs nor Count di Monti, nor Mr. Bond,
nor Mr. Cockburn, nor any of the menservants. I've seen all their
fingerprints by now."</p>

<p>He went on to speak of the probable connection between the
stranger and the letter received by the colonel on Wednesday
noon.</p>

<p>"It was delivered by the chauffeur of a Sir Henry Carew.</p>

<p>"Who's he?"</p>

<p>"Neighbour of the colonel's. Late of the same regiment. Tons of
money."</p>

<p>"Married?" asked Pointer.</p>

<p>"Grandfather," Harris said triumphantly, in a tone that nipped
any romantic suppositions in the bud.</p>

<p>"Any sons?"</p>

<p>"One. Fell at Givenchy."</p>

<p>"Then very probably he sent the colonel a warning."</p>

<p>"Ah, he would do that!" Harris quite approved of this idea.</p>

<p>"According to Paul, the colonel dined with him on Wednesday in
town, and spent the evening with him, getting back about half-past
twelve."</p>

<p>"They're often together," Harris threw in "Sir Henry, for one
thing, owns a horse at this moment that the colonel's going to back
for all he's worth, I hear. I'm rather inclined myself
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pointer brought the talk back to the matter in hand, and ran
over the possible suppositions about the unknown man who had lain
on the bed of the summer house, very much as he had done to
O'Connor, but in a tabulated, abbreviated form.</p>

<p>"That's the first point. The second we want to find out is, who
was the man who pushed the carrier to the sand-pit. Thirdly, we
want to trace out the woman who walked beside the man. She probably
wore the stained blue dress. So much for the main facts. As to the
motive for the murder&mdash;there's the idea of jealousy. We have
two men and two women belonging to Miss Charteris's own circle that
might have something to say to that. Bellairs and the count, Mrs.
Lane and Miss Scarlett.</p>

<p>"The count, you remember, said that not only had he a perfect
alibi for all Thursday evening and night from eight on, but that he
was going to bring down two friends, a Prince Cornaro and a Mr. del
Greco, a relation of the Italian Ambassador, to confirm it. We know
there was a meeting at which he spoke at eleven, but if he was late
he could have reached it after Miss Charteris was killed. However,
if his alibi's as good as he says, he's out of
it&mdash;seemingly.</p>

<p>"As for Mr. Bellairs, of course, in the ordinary way, we should
ask for an explanation at once about that studio of his. But he's
staying at Windsor Castle until Tuesday, painting a portrait of the
Queen for the coming World's Conference of Women. But now, suppose
the motive isn't jealousy, or anything in that line. Suppose Miss
Rose's death was to some one's advantage&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, but it wasn't!" put in Harris almost gleefully. "Not
advantage enough to the Stillwater lot. Miss Sibella gets that
Italian legacy, if it's ever paid, and that's all the profit there
is. Her money don't come to the colonel till after her father's
death. I've been talking to Mr. Gilchrist."</p>

<p>"I suppose the count's too wealthy to feel the pinch of letting
the property go?" Inspector Rodman puzzled aloud, "but, of course,
now there's only one girl to marry."</p>

<p>Harris turned on him quizzically.</p>

<p>"Look here, he's an Italian, not a Mormon."</p>

<p>"What I mean, sir, is this. That Italian property went to Miss
Charteris, and, after her death, to Miss Scarlett, and then back to
the di Monti. Now Miss Charteris's gone, if the count marries Miss
Scarlett, it takes it back into the family at once, as it
were?"</p>

<p>"I thought it went to Miss Scarlett permanent to will away,"
Harris said after a pause. "Let's look at the papers. I laid a note
of her money affairs in with 'em."</p>

<p>He opened the safe and took out a parcel, untied it, and then
started.</p>

<p>"Why, they're gone! These newspapers have been put in
instead."</p>

<p>"When were they out of your keeping?" Pointer asked equably.</p>

<p>"The chief asked to see them, so I sent Briggs up there,
yesterday about seven. The major sent them back again about nine.
Mr. Thornton returned them. He'd been dining there."</p>

<p>"Who else was at Major Vaughan's at dinner, do you know?"</p>

<p>"Only the colonel, Briggs said."</p>

<p>"You may be sure that any one even remotely connected with the
case would look in in the course of the evening," Pointer said a
little grimly.</p>

<p>"I know the count did for a fact. But, Alf, the major wouldn't
show these papers to outsiders&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But he might leave them in some downstairs room, tied up,
labelled, and ready to be sent back."</p>

<p>Rodman nodded. He thought that the chief constable might very
easily have done that.</p>

<p>"But," Harris tried to keep his head above water, "they were
only letters, except that note I shoved in, only Miss Rose's
letters&mdash;".</p>

<p>"Just so," Pointer said briskly. "Letters. Possibly some one
thought that that missing enclosure the professor sent his
daughter, and which no one seems able to trace, might be there
too."</p>

<p>"You thought that flake of sealing-wax on the table at the
studio meant it had been there. Perhaps she had handed it over to
some one, Mr. Bellairs, say."</p>

<p>"Possibly. I've written to him to ask for a full account of how
he spent Thursday night, from eight onwards. But that flake was on
a little table by the door, you know, not on the central table. It
looks to me more as though the black-sealed envelope had been
merely laid down on the small table to be out of the way."</p>

<p>"Pity one can't just ask the professor what the letter, and
second, inside envelope, is all about," Harris said.</p>

<p>"The colonel is inserting an advertisement in all the Italian,
French, and Balkan newspapers addressed to his brother-in-law, and
asking him to return immediately. That ought to reach him soon,
wherever he is." And with that, Pointer left his two helpers and
began to look through the reports that had been sent down by a
motor cyclist from Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>He learnt that no hospital had taken in any case on Thursday
night that could possibly be connected with the man he wanted.
Private nursing-homes were being investigated, but they would take
time, as all inquiries were to be so carefully made. A list was
furnished the Chief Inspector of all the doctors and surgeons who
attended the French hospital in Soho. One of these, Pointer noted,
had a nursing-home in a smart part of the West end. He was Sir
Martin Martineau. In accordance with his instructions, very special
inquiries had been made there, but they had led to nothing.</p>

<p>Pointer filed the notes and went out for a stroll. The stroll
took him to Doctor Metcalfe's. But that young man's flood of gossip
had nothing in it which threw any new light on the facts of the
case, and Pointer decided finally that perhaps sleep was not a mere
luxury, even in the beginning of a case, and, following Harris's
example, was soon himself tucked up in a room of the
superintendent's. For Brown had taken his departure from Red Gates
before the inquest.</p>

<p>Next morning he was early up at Stillwater House for a chat with
Paul, who liked him.</p>

<p>"Nothing has been changed, I suppose?" Pointer asked, following
him into the deserted dining-room.</p>

<p>"No, sir. Funeral's at three," Paul said sadly. "Hasn't been a
funeral of anybody under sixty from this house since I've been in
service here. And me having been born on the estate can be relied
on for facts. And to think of its being our Miss Rose now. It still
don't seem real sometimes."</p>

<p>"Ladies going?" asked Pointer.</p>

<p>Paul said they were.</p>

<p>"With whom is Mrs. Lane driving?" Pointer asked again.</p>

<p>"With Miss Sibella. At least&mdash;well&mdash;that had been so
arranged, but they've had a little&mdash;ahem, ladies will be
ladies," Paul finished obscurely.</p>

<p>"Trouble, eh?" Pointer offered him a cigar. "Mrs. Lane looks to
me as if she had a bit of a temper."</p>

<p>Paul eyed him in mild amazement.</p>

<p>"Then I should try glasses, sir," he said finally. "Mrs. Lane's
as gentle a creature as ever stepped. Now, Miss Sibella&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What was the trouble between the ladies about?"</p>

<p>"I don't rightly know myself. It took place at dinner last
night. The colonel started talking about the concert. You would not
be aware of that, sir, but there was a concert in Medchester on the
Thursday night, the last night our Miss Rose was alive."</p>

<p>"Was there indeed?" came from Pointer.</p>

<p>"They were all joining in friendly like, when all at once you
could hear sort of daggers in the ladies' voices. Don't ask me what
it was about. Talking of the concert, they were, as I said. Mrs.
Lane only said that she thought she had heard more of the music
than Miss Sibella, or something like that, when our young lady gets
up, and says she isn't accustomed to have her word doubted, 'not
even by Mrs. Seymour's late companion,' she says, with a nasty
little laugh, and I could hardly get to the door in time, before
she sailed through."</p>

<p>"Humph, and then?"</p>

<p>"The colonel, he looked&mdash;well, you know how a man feels
when the women about him get to nagging each other&mdash;he looked
just like that. And after a minute he said, 'I'm afraid poor
Sibella's nerves are upset by this terrible affair.' Mrs. Lane she
sits there, trying to keep the tears back, I thought, till she
suddenly jumps up, and says low, but boiling over as it were, 'And
so are mine!' And with that she leaves the colonel, too. The
colonel he says, 'Good God! It's past bearing!' And then he went to
his study."</p>

<p>Pointer filled in the gaps as he walked away. So Mrs. Lane and
Sibella were not on the best of terms.</p>

<p>As he passed Red Gates he heard voices in the little arbour.
Pushing open the gate, he caught sight of Thornton talking to
Cockburn, who had come with Bond for the funeral.</p>

<p>"Look here! Should one, or should one not, tell all that one
suspects in a case of this kind, as well as all that one knows?
Terrible to bring suspicion on the wrong person." Cockburn's voice
was hesitating.</p>

<p>"Worse to let the right person escape!" came from Bond, in the
balcony above them.</p>

<p>"I like to be sure I'm right before I go ahead," murmured
Cockburn doubtfully.</p>

<p>"And I like to be sure I'm wrong, before I stop," Bond retorted
firmly.</p>

<p>"I think," Thornton's voice came thoughtfully, "I think I should
feel it my duty to tell everything, even though it incriminated my
nearest and dearest."</p>

<p>Pointer sincerely trusted that Mr. Thornton was speaking the
truth. But he did not feel sure.</p>

<p>"You would, eh?" Cockburn seemed to have some difficulty in
accepting the ruling.</p>

<p>"You're a thorough chap, Thornton. That's what I like about
you," Bond said approvingly. But Cockburn seemed wrestling with
doubts.</p>

<p>"That's easily said," he muttered around his pipe stem, "but
take a man, an innocent man, as innocent as you, or I, of Miss
Charteris's murder, and let him do something suspicious. I don't
quite see&mdash;" His voice fell off.</p>

<p>Thornton repeated firmly that he would tell everything, and let
the man clear himself.</p>

<p>"Excellently put, sir." Pointer stepped out into the tiny
pergola. Thornton seemed to realise, that his emphasis-might have
given away the topic, so he said lightly:</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm only quoting from a friend's play I'm reading."</p>

<p>"That's what the hero says, I suppose," Cockburn grumbled.</p>

<p>"Or perhaps what the villain says to throw others off the
track," Pointer suggested suavely, looking at Thornton. Had he, or
had he not, lent that car of his last Thursday night?</p>

<p>"Suppose it's just an onlooker's speech. Just a puzzled
onlooker's," Thornton parried.</p>

<p>"Puzzled because what he knows won't square with what he hears?"
Pointer asked.</p>

<p>The eyes of the two men met and locked.</p>

<p>"Look here, Co., we're in the way." Bond jumped up.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think that I'm going to be arrested yet." Thornton
gave his sardonic smile. "Have a chair and a cigar, Chief
Inspector?"</p>

<p>Pointer took the first, and produced his briar. "You were
saying, Mr. Cockburn&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, just fancies&mdash;generalities," Cockburn spoke a little
shyly. "It's about last Thursday. I felt something was in the air
down here at Stillwater, and I've just been wondering whether it
could have anything to do with a story, I heard last night. There's
a girl I know in town, who knows Bellairs jolly well. She thinks he
means to marry, her. Perhaps he does."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he doesn't," Bond put in sceptically.</p>

<p>"She says, this girl I'm speaking of, that Bellairs saw quite a
good deal of Miss Charteris lately. She's convinced that he was
down here at his studio last Thursday night, though she has no
proof. Of course, this may only be her jealous imaginings, but on
Thursday, I thought&mdash;" Cockburn broke off vaguely.</p>

<p>"You thought?" Pointer prompted, after a little wait.</p>

<p>"Well, supposing, the colonel and di Monti had got wind of the
same story? Di Monti played a single with Miss Charteris after tea,
and I never saw such serves, nor such returns&mdash;to a girl. By
Jove, he as good as tried to bang her with the ball more than
once."</p>

<p>"Oh, come now!" Bond gave a laugh of sheer incredulity.</p>

<p>"Fact! Miss Scarlett, who was looking on, too, made some comment
about his playing so hard, and he got himself in hand a bit after
that. But the man was in a murderous temper. Absolutely murderous.
And," Cockburn went on doggedly, "you, too, noticed the look on the
colonel's face when we heard that shot on Thursday?"</p>

<p>He had turned again to Thornton, who nodded shortly "Well, there
isn't any one who carries a revolver around here but the count. A
Facistt is always armed, he told us once. I'm convinced that the
colonel half-feared the truth then. And what about those
blood-stained bits of cord we tried to match in the colonel's study
when you caught us, Chief Inspector? It was the cord that the
colonel had given di Monti, though we didn't know that then."</p>

<p>The four men sat awhile in silence.</p>

<p>"Is di Monti being watched?" Bond asked suddenly.</p>

<p>"My dear Bond, we're all being watched!" Thornton snapped out in
a tone which suddenly charged the atmosphere with menace. Murder
had been done. The murderer was still at large. Something grim and
horrible showed its vague outline. The monstrous deed seemed to
loom nearer.</p>

<p>Pointer shook his head.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to bring you all down to humdrum earth, but don't
think you have any idea how expensive the watching of three people
would be. I'm afraid that only the possible criminal gets as far as
that."</p>

<p>"Supposing there isn't a criminal?" Thornton said abruptly, and
as always with him, Pointer had the impression that his speech had
been looked over, inspected, before he allowed it out. "Suppose
there has been no crime?" He was watching the chief inspector as he
spoke.</p>

<p>"Suppose what, instead, then?" Pointer asked curiously.</p>

<p>"I hardly know&mdash;an accident, for instance, and some attempt
to cover it up?"</p>

<p>Pointer had asked himself that question very seriously at first,
but he had thought even then that the efforts to cover up all
traces of the death having taken place at the summer house were too
intense. Those steps along that short-cut, behind the dead girl's
body, straightening her bier, while wearing her shoes! Would any
woman do such a thing unless the need were of the most extreme
urgency? Apart from everything else, he thought not. If either of
the women were Mrs. Lane, or Sibella Scarlett, he was sure not.
That it was one of them, the disarrangement of Rose Charteris's bed
seemed to prove conclusively. Only these two, barring the servants,
would have easy access to Rose's room, would think of the sketching
box.</p>

<p>"That's an interesting theory," he said. "Could you enlarge on
it at all, sir?"</p>

<p>No. Thornton said that he had no data, but that all along he had
had a feeling that some most unfortunate combination of
circumstances had made Miss Charteris's death look as though a
crime had been committed, when possibly it was only a blunder.</p>

<p>"Bond and Co." seemed to find much food for thought in the novel
theory. Pointer went off, saying that he must think it over.
Perhaps Mr. Thornton would think it over, too, and let him know if
anything bearing out his idea occurred to him.</p>

<p>He himself took up an inconspicuous position near Stillwater's
front door. Lady Maxwell was the first to arrive for the funeral.
She was shown into the drawing-room, and Pointer decided that the
Virginia creeper beside it needed more attention than it had had
from him. He was busy examining the trellis when Sibella entered
the room. For a while the talk was a very one-sided affair. Pointer
got the impression that Sibella did not like her visitor any too
well. Or else she was so wrapped in her own dark thoughts that it
was only with difficulty that she could rouse herself to take any
interest in what the other was saying. One such momentary flicker
came when the name of a Miss Winter was mentioned.</p>

<p>"Miss Winter?" Sibella said, as though miles away. "Oh, yes, of
course, Mrs. Seymour's cousin."</p>

<p>"Yes, the head mistress of Biswell. She and Mr. Seymour
practically lived together. She's abroad, unfortunately, just now.
But I wired her at once, as soon as I saw the statement in the
papers, and she wired back that she had never heard the name of
Lane, and that her cousin never had a companion."</p>

<p>"Surely we don't need to discuss this now? There might be a
truce to-day? All such things seem so petty." Sibella spoke very
low.</p>

<p>"But in view of Rose's having been murdered, Sib, darling, every
moment may be of value. The woman may try to run away. You don't
know who she is. Your father is such a good sort that he would
never suspect anything wrong. Rose never liked her."</p>

<p>"I know, but&mdash;" Sibella seemed to have no strength to waste
in argument. "Oh, well, let us get it over it then. What is it you
want to do?"</p>

<p>"I don't want anything," Lady Maxwell spoke with some acerbity,
"but I think the police should be told at once that the reference
is false&mdash;" The door into the hall was standing open. The
colonel appeared with telegram in his hand.</p>

<p>"Bellairs says he can't&mdash;" He stopped at sight of the woman
talking to his daughter. He tried to back noiselessly away, but
Lady Maxwell called him. Apparently the colonel did not hear her,
for the door of the study shut very swiftly, but not before the
watcher outside saw the look of alarm that was on it. The visitor,
with a murmured word of apology or explanation, rose and went after
him.</p>

<p>Sibella paid no heed. She sat with her forehead leaning on her
hand, her eyes closed.</p>

<p>A minute later and Mrs. Lane came in. She was very pale, with
purple shadows around her eyes. Coming across to the girl, she put
her arm around the slender shoulders.</p>

<p>"Sibella, my dear, I thought you would be here alone. I want to
say&mdash;" Her, voice was very gentle, but Sibella jumped to her
feet, her long, black gloves falling to the floor.</p>

<p>"Oh! They're bringing her&mdash;IT&mdash;down the stairs! Talk
to me! Talk to me! For God's sake don't let me hear the sound of
those heavy steps! Don't!"</p>

<p>She grasped Mrs. Lane's arm, trembling violently. Mrs. Lane,
too, looked as though she were all but fainting. Pointer thought
that only a very unusual will kept her upright on her feet. Her
face was green white. Her breath came in little gasps. In silence
the two women inside the room, and Pointer outside, heard the heavy
tramp and scuffle as the top of the stairs were turned.</p>

<p>Sibella fell back into her chair.</p>

<p>"Rose! Rose, who always ran down them!" She was almost writhing
as she put her fingers into her ears. Mrs. Lane hid her face in her
hands.</p>

<p>There came a sudden, loud peremptory knock at the door.</p>

<p>It was the coffin, one corner of which struck it in turning.</p>

<p>Sibella's head and shoulders plunged forward. She was in a dead
faint, and Mrs. Lane looked as though one straw more would break
her.</p>

<p>Lady Maxwell returned. There were tears in her eyes. She had met
the men at their task. The lady-housekeeper waited till she bent
over Sibella. Then she felt for the door-knob as though unable to
see it.</p>

<p>Di Monti almost collided with her as he stepped in hastily. He
was obviously, giving the undertaker's men more room. The strange
thing was that he stepped in with a look of fierce satisfaction on
his face. It vanished as he helped Lady Maxwell lay the girl on the
sofa.</p>

<p>"All the better if she doesn't hear them carry the coffin out of
doors. Though it's really quite absurd. Giving way like this. It
isn't as if they had been fond of each other. But Sib always was
one to let her feelings run off With her. Now she's coming to."
Lady Maxwell spoke as one who had scant sympathy with weakness.</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, Lady Maxwell," di Monti said in his most
formal manner, "I happen to know that Miss Rose was very fond of
Miss Sibella indeed. These last days especially."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't overdo it, if I were you," was the lady's caustic
and rather surprising reply.</p>

<p>Di Monti looked as though he had been struck. His eyes flashed,
his face crimsoned. His upstanding top-locks quivered. But he only
bowed, and at that moment Pointer had to move away from the window,
for Paul was looking for him.</p>

<p>Pointer's mind as he drove in the funeral cortge was with the
two women whom he had watched in such a convulsion of feeling.</p>

<p>Each felt herself guilty. Was it only in some measure, or in
full measure? A good deal would depend on temperament. But even
allowing for the most highly strung nerves&mdash;and both Sibella
and Mrs. Lane possessed that doubtful blessing, there was more here
than they would explain. Some knowledge, some fact, some deed, lay
behind such emotion. Of that Pointer was sure.</p>

<p>The afternoon of Rose Charteris's funeral was a marvel of song
and bloom and scent. It was the May of the poets, of bud-swollen
branches and filmy green leaves. The pink of the crab apple trees
around the old churchyard showed up in spaced beauty against the
wild cherries. The blackthorns reached their snowy arms, beginning
to look a little ragged, from out the beautiful young green of
their cousins, the hawthorns, whose blossoms were only a promise, a
closely-kept secret, as yet.</p>

<p>The pale-green bud clusters of the hollies were just tinging
into white, but a cloud of their blue butterflies&mdash;symbol and
warning&mdash;swept past the mourners' faces like a delicate smoke
wreath, on the first flight of their lives. A thrush sang a
wonderful song as they lowered the body of Rose into the earth to
which it was to return.</p>

<p>The service affected the men officially engaged in the hunt very
keenly. There was not one who did not swear to himself a
vow&mdash;by that bole in the ground, by that oblong box&mdash;to
do his utmost to see that the murderer paid.</p>

<p>After Colonel Scarlett had dropped the first earth on to the
coffin, di Monti stepped forward. From his handful came a rattle
that made the clergyman peer over his prayer-book. Some stones must
have got picked up as well. Di Monti did not seem to have heard
them, as, with bent head, he stood beside Scarlett, a picture of
mourning.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER SIX</h2>

<p class="first">POINTER had a short talk with Lady Maxwell after
the funeral, but he learnt nothing fresh. She repeated her doubts
about Mrs. Lane, and the fact that the colonel, when she had felt
it her painful duty to speak to him on the point just now, had said
that his lady housekeeper was too efficient to lose, and that if
there were any mistake, it was his. He must have confused two Mrs.
Seymours.</p>

<p>The object of the lady's suspicions was sitting very quietly in
the arm-chair into which she had sunk on her return from
church.</p>

<p>After a long time spent in thought, she walked down-stairs and
into the study. The colonel, too, was sitting staring into
space.</p>

<p>On seeing her he rose abruptly, and with a look of caution went
to the door and shut it again to make sure that it was caught.</p>

<p>"Does she suspect anything? Lady Maxwell, I mean?" he whispered
"Paul's downstairs. Those damned police are off the premises for
once. Does she know anything?" he repeated irritably.</p>

<p>"Nothing, I think, except that I was never a companion to a
Bishop's widow."</p>

<p>For a second Scarlett stared at her, as though she had spoken in
some foreign tongue.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he said at last, "you mean your reference? Well, I had, to
say something when the police sprang the question on me. But was
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>She interrupted him. "I think it would be as well if I were to
go to town. I don't see else&mdash;there's danger," she said in a
low voice.</p>

<p>"Danger of having communications cut off," he finished. "I was
just thinking the same when you came in. Have you thought of where
to go?"</p>

<p>"You have a furnished house at Victoria standing empty till
June. I'll go there as a sort of caretaker." She raised her hand.
"Don't let's talk any more about it to-day. I feel as though," she
was at the door before he had guessed her intention, "I want to be
alone, for a while."</p>

<p>She was gone. The colonel mixed himself a stiff drink.</p>

<p>Pointer found Cockburn's car waiting for him at the police
station. It had been waiting some time.</p>

<p>"Bond had to get back to town. He went by train, but I wanted to
see you about something. You know that shot I heard, or thought I
heard, last Thursday night?" Cockburn began briskly.</p>

<p>Pointer nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, Count di Monti's tyre burst coming back from the funeral.
I heard the sound again at that moment. It wasn't a shot after all,
but one of his tyres I heard go <i>phut</i>. They're a patent,
reinforced, balloon type, of a very curious make."</p>

<p>"You're quite sure of this?"</p>

<p>"I'm prepared to swear to it. Such a sound might travel far on a
quiet evening just before a storm. Anyway, that's the noise we
heard and mistook for a shot." Cockburn's voice was quite
definite.</p>

<p>Pointer turned over his latest addition to the puzzle for a
minute.</p>

<p>"You see," he explained&mdash;Cockburn was talking to him in his
own sitting-room, "the trouble is that Count di Monti has a very
good alibi for the hours from eight on Thursday till Friday
morning. Prince Cornaro and a Signor del Greco are prepared to
swear that he was in their company from dinner till the meeting of
Italian Fascisti, which took place at eleven, and afterwards till
ten the next morning, or a little after. They're both very definite
and very positive. The head waiter at Frasati's bears out the
dinner hour as eight. The count most certainly spoke at the
meeting. For the rest of the time we have to rely on the honour of
the two gentlemen."</p>

<p>Cockburn nodded in his turn. He was listening very seriously. "I
quite understand all that. But can't the alibi be tested?"</p>

<p>"I don't mind saying that it's so good it's suspicious."</p>

<p>"That's what I think. Now, Mr. Thornton, it seems, knows a
Cavaliere Rossi, the London correspondent, for the best Italian
papers. An anti-Fascist. He might be able to tell us something
about di Monti and Thursday night."</p>

<p>Pointer heartily commended this idea.</p>

<p>Armed with a letter, and preceded by a telephone message from
Thornton to the Cavaliere, Cockburn sped up to the Italian's
club.</p>

<p>Rossi turned out to be a tall, good-looking young man with a
merry, dark eye. He burnt Thornton's little note in the wood
fire.</p>

<p>"Have a cocktail of my family Vermouth while we talk. This
corner is absolutely safe from eavesdroppers and, what is more
difficult to secure in England, and much more important, from
draughts. Now, what do you want me to tell you about di Monti?"</p>

<p>"Oh, all sorts of things. First of all, what is his position
here?"</p>

<p>"Slippery. If the Ambassador likes, he can disown him. If he
likes, he can throw his mantle over him, and then you won't be able
to touch him."</p>

<p>"I can hardly imagine a war over that chap! But which way would
his Excellency's preferences run?" Rossi bent forward in mock
intensity.</p>

<p>"It depends on how much there is to throw his cloak over. A
little heap of political trouble or a great mound of it. It would
stretch in the one case, but not in the other. At least, that is
how things seem to stand. Di Monti is on a mission, straight from
our 'Musoon.' Sent to organise the Italian Fascisti in London. The
anti-Communists, that is&mdash;."</p>

<p>Cockburn glanced meditatively at his glass.</p>

<p>"The <i>pro-'Italia uber alles'</i>, eh?" he asked quietly.
Rossi shrugged his shoulders, with a laugh at the mixture of
tongues.</p>

<p>"Perhaps! After all, every country sings that song. 'Britannia
Rules the Waves' sounds so very like it to some ears, my friend.
But to continue&mdash;the mission is a sort of test. Cangrande did
splendidly with d'Annunzio's <i>Arditi</i> in Fiume."</p>

<p>Cockburn made a face.</p>

<p>"That is as may be, but he did well. Then came that Corfu
incident. He was partly responsible for the way that was carried
out. So he got into semi-disgrace. Now, as it happens, the dream of
his life has always been our colonies. Tripoli, and then this
Oltrajuba. He wants to be sent out with a free hand to organise the
latter. He may get it&mdash;if there is no trouble, no hint of
disgrace. But he will not get it if he is mixed up publicly in this
story. And it is being decided in the Inner Council at Rome even
now."</p>

<p>"Tell me, Cavaliere, do you think the man capable of
murder?"</p>

<p>"Are we not all capable of murder? I am."</p>

<p>"No," Cockburn said with conviction. "That is one of our catch
phrases, that 'Every man is capable of murder.' In reality, few
people are. And here it's a question of a young and frightfully,
lovely girl. Not one man in a million would have been willing to
harm her."</p>

<p>"I know. I've seen her more than once. Madonna, she was
beautiful!"</p>

<p>"Do you think the Count capable of murdering her?" persisted
Cockburn.</p>

<p>Rossi looked uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"Jealousy is a fearful poison," he confessed.. "I think we of
the south feel it more than you can. With us it is something that
can change us altogether until it is past. How can I say he would
not fall, where so many men have fallen?"</p>

<p>"Look here, did you see him yourself at the meeting on
Thursday?"</p>

<p>"I did. He took the chair from eleven till twelve."</p>

<p>"Well, then, was he late?" Cockburn felt sure that all was not
as it should be with that alibi. He was convinced that di Monti was
in the events of Thursday night for something.</p>

<p>"Not to speak of. Perhaps half an hour, more or less. You know
with us Italians&mdash;" The hands finished the sentence,
gracefully.</p>

<p>"Did he seem as usual at the meeting?" Cockburn probed. He had
discussed with Pointer the best questions to ask.</p>

<p>Rossi thought a while, running his slender hands through his
hair.</p>

<p>"In no way&mdash;no. He is never a magnetic speaker, but he is
reliable and very much in earnest. Last Thursday I thought he
seemed rather duller than usual."</p>

<p>"Duller!" Cockburn had not expected this.</p>

<p>"Well, then, put it that his thoughts were somewhere else. He
had a colour in his face, and a red light in his eyes that I had
never seen in him before."</p>

<p>Cockburn sipped his Vermouth.</p>

<p>"You don't like di Monti?" he asked.</p>

<p>Rossi shook his head.</p>

<p>"I don't. But I've told you only the truth, none the less," he
added with a slight smile.</p>

<p>"May I ask you why you don't like him?"</p>

<p>Rossi shrugged.</p>

<p>"Why don't I like him? There is something&mdash;what shall I
say&mdash;sinister?&mdash;in the man that repels me. Then, too, his
name has been mixed up at home with some very savage punitive
expeditions, and you know what that means, when the
Fascisti&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rossi checked himself here.</p>

<p>"I've told you all I know of the man," he finished.</p>

<p>"Thanks ever. I wish some of your facts had been more
discreditable," Cockburn said in a low voice, and Rossi chuckled.
"Now, a last favour. Just let me have the address of the friend who
took di Monti to his rooms, will you? The name was del Greco."</p>

<p>Rossi was able to give it him, and Cockburn put in an hour's
work learning, by a few, very shrewdly-placed questions, from a
couple of maids in the flat below, that the rooms upstairs had been
empty till after midnight on Thursday.</p>

<p>He felt quite pleased with himself as he walked away, though
Pointer could have told him that servants' testimony against a man
of di Monti's position was not a sure move.</p>

<p>Pointer meanwhile was up in town, too. He had decided to pay the
count's rooms in the Albany a visit himself. Watts had gone over
them in vain, but the Chief Inspector thought that he might find
some neglected trifle.</p>

<p>The rooms showed more books than Pointer had expected. Besides
the inevitable bust of Dante, the Italian tri-colour, and a
well-thumbed Carducci, there were books on agriculture, grammars of
Tuareg and Arabic dialects, pamphlets on army training, and a host
of similar works The only letters were business letters, except a
few from his own family in Italy.</p>

<p>At the back of the boot-cupboard he unearthed a little posy of
flowers. Some one had set the boots down on the top of the delicate
blossoms. Pointer picked them up with a dim sense of cruelty. The
touch told him that they were artificial, but they were beautifully
copied from nature. A little bunch of pink and white camellias tied
with silver ribbon&mdash;the shoulder-knot that Rose had been
wearing in Bellairs's portrait of her. They had been flung with
such force to the back of the cupboard that their stems were
doubled up. The petals were worse yet. It looked to him, it
certainly looked to him, as though a boot-heel had crunched on
them. Accident or intention?</p>

<p>Pointer thought a trifle grimly of the patent anguish with which
Count di Monti had spoken only yesterday, before himself and the
two police-officers, of his dead fiance's feeling of fear.</p>

<p>He closed the door and descended the stairs. He was due at the
commissioner's shortly. At the entrance di Monti passed him. The
Italian stopped at sight of the detective-officer, and a cold smile
flickered across his face. A smile with no suggestion of mirth in
it.</p>

<p>"A visit to me?"</p>

<p>"Another time will do as well. I am due now at New Scotland
Yard," Pointer replied civilly.</p>

<p>Di Monti stood for a second looking at the other without
speaking, and Pointer suddenly smelt danger, and very close beside
him.</p>

<p>It was a mad idea that he could be attacked in broad daylight,
but he knew it to be a fact. He turned away with a nod, and walked
slowly on out of the door past the big gray car. The driver, di
Monti's man, watched him sleepily.</p>

<p>Pointer, thought that he, too, resembled a beast of prey with
forest laws and forest passions. He drove on to the Yard with a
feeling that things were about to take some definite turn. That
smile of di Monti's, like a snake it had crossed that hard face, it
meant something. He felt certain that the count had taken some
decision at that moment. What one?</p>

<p>Back at the police station, he learnt that neither Harris nor
Rodman had been able to find any one who had seen either Mrs. Lane
or Miss Scarlett at the beginning of the concert last Thursday,
though at the very end Sibella had slipped in, and Mrs. Lane had
taken her seat about the middle of the entertainment.</p>

<p>"Just so." Pointer handed Harris back the report to file away.
"They were off on two different missions. Now, Miss Sibella's
evening shoes were pretty well covered with garden mould when I saw
them on Friday. I think we may take it that she was the one who
helped Miss Rose home from the studio in that little two-seater
both use."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder," Harris said with alacrity. "Shows that she
realised how nasty the count might be, for, as I say, she bars
night driving."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder," Pointer quoted with a smile "And now,
here's the latest find."</p>

<p>He laid a sheet of notepaper in front of the superintendent.
Harris picked it up.</p>

<p>"Never saw such a fist in all my life! Whose is it?"</p>

<p>"The Professor's. It's the letter that Miss Charteris got on
Thursday, the one that accompanied the enclosed black-sealed
envelope. It's in Italian. Here's what he says."</p>

<p>He laid down another slip. Harris read in English:</p>

<p><i>"B0LZANO HOTEL LAURIN</i>
</p>

<p><i>"My DEAR DAUGHTER, I am sending you an enclosure with this,
addressed to myself, which please keep by you pending future
directions. I may want it destroyed. I may not. The weather here is
very cold. I wish I had taken your advice and brought my warmer
underwear. As you thought, it was quite chilly at Genoa.</i>
</p>

<p><i>"Your affectionate father,</i>
</p>

<p><i>"HENRY CHARTERIS."</i>
</p>

<p>"Bit of a sell, eh?" said the disappointed Harris. "And why
Italian? His writing would have been enough of a safeguard, I
should have thought."</p>

<p>The date was the Monday before Rose was murdered</p>

<p>"Lady Maxwell told me that the professor often talked and wrote
both to his daughter and to his niece in Italian so as to keep it
up. I found this letter tucked between the pages of a new Italian
dictionary in Mrs. Lane's bedroom."</p>

<p>"Hidden?"</p>

<p>"Or laid away in safe keeping. There's nothing much in the
letter itself, except that it seems to point to the importance of
the accompanying enclosure, which was, as we were told, addressed
to the professor himself. The odd thing is, why was this half-sheet
taken? Why did Mrs. Lane buy that Italian dictionary late on
Thursday at Jephson's in the High Road? Why was she, or they, so
anxious to learn what was in the letter? And Genoa," Pointer paused
a moment to fill his pipe, "Genoa! That's not the way the colonel
told us three separate times that the professor was going into
Italy. If you look at your report, you'll see he says that his
brother-in-law was going through Italy by way of
Modena-Turin-Milan-Venice. His very insistence struck me as odd.
Now, here the professor refers to having been in Genoa, and that
not as though it had been an afterthought."</p>

<p>Pointer stared at the note a little longer.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't be surprised if Mrs. Lane came so late to the
concert because she was in some quiet nook, railway station or bun
shop, translating this. It would take her some time The professor's
handwriting ought to be forbidden by law. I thought the letter was
in cuneiform at first."</p>

<p>"Instead of being in Medchester. I see." Harris nodded solemnly.
"Of course, Mrs. Lane's a newcomer down here." His tone indicated
resignation to any blows from that quarter. "You think she's in it,
then?"</p>

<p>"'It' was always the case to all the men engaged on 'It.'"</p>

<p>"'Fraid so. I think she's the woman who walked in Miss
Charteris's shoes on that path to the sand-pit late that same
night." Pointer spoke very gravely. "She has a short-stepping gait.
Not like Miss Scarlett's stride. And her weight and size of foot
would fit the marks."</p>

<p>"Lady Maxwell wears sixes or sevens," Harris said ungallantly.
"I measured her footsteps."</p>

<p>The door opened, and Rodman saluted.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Lane's just left for town, sir. The servants say that she
told them that the colonel had asked her to look after a furnished
house of his some time ago, and that she only waited till the
funeral was over before taking up her new duties. Miss Scarlett's
going shortly, to stay with Lady Carew at their Devon place. The
colonel's remaining on."</p>

<p>Rodman went back to his observation post at Stillwater
House.</p>

<p>"With Lady Carew! There you are Alf!" Harris said triumphantly.
"You wondered, why Sir Henry wasn't at the funeral. I told you he'd
gone to Sledmere. The colonel himself dropped that to me. Now you
see that there's no ill-feeling."</p>

<p>"Sir Henry left on Friday afternoon very suddenly for Yorkshire
after having backed out nearly a week before at the last moment,"
Pointer observed.</p>

<p>"Well, what, of it?"</p>

<p>Pointer eyed Harris's indignant face with a twinkle.</p>

<p>"Search me! as the Americans say, and if at the same time you
could find the answer to why Sir Henry Carew does not seem to've
been notified of Miss Charteris's death, I should be obliged."</p>

<p>"How do you make that out&mdash;about his not having been
told?"</p>

<p>"I can't be sure, but I came across a list of names to which
notices were to be sent that had been given Mrs. Lane. It was a
long one. His wasn't on it. One of my men is in the Army and Navy
Club, where the two generally hang out, and he says that, according
to one of the waiters, Carew learnt it by chance late in the
afternoon from a mutual acquaintance. The waiter says Sir Henry had
a cab called within the hour and just caught his train."</p>

<p>Pointer glanced at the last note on Harris's pad of the
afternoon. Mr. Cockburn had telephoned the result of his efforts to
crack the count's alibi. The Chief Inspector looked pleased.</p>

<p>"Good! We'll get him to find out more about the count for
us."</p>

<p>Next morning, the morning after the funeral, Pointer received a
very austere reply from Mr. Bellairs at Windsor Castle.</p>

<p>The artist stated that he was at a loss to understand the
communication which he had just received. He had been indisposed on
Thursday evening, and had kept to his rooms, even cancelling a
dance engagement. He had not been in Medchester for some time, a
fortnight or more, he thought.</p>

<p>Pointer raised a reflective eyebrow, and filed the letter. Then
he went to Stillwater House to take a few soundings.</p>

<p>In the lounge sat Sibella, a note open on her knee. Pointer put
on a pair of very special glasses. Their action was that of
short-range field-glasses. Stepping noiselessly nearer, he read
over her shoulder, in di Monti's sharp, black
characters:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Egregia Signorina</i>."</p>

<p>The letter was in Italian. Translated it ran:</p>

<p><i>"I shall be on the grass tennis-courts at twelve to-day.
Would you be so kind as to meet me there?</i>
</p>

<p><i>"With the most perfect esteem and the most exquisite
respect.</i>
</p>

<p><i>"CANGRANDE GIULIO di MONTI."</i>
</p>

<p>Sibella shivered, as though chilly.</p>

<p>Pointer would have liked to witness the interview, but he was
due in town to give some evidence in an International forgery case
which was being tried.</p>

<p>Harris telephoned him an account of the meeting during the lunch
interval, and Pointer decided from its brevity that it had been
used to settle the time of another appointment. Harris had not been
able to hear anything. But he said that only the briefest of
sentences on the count's part, and even less on Miss Scarlett's
side, had passed.</p>

<p>Pointer was detained. The Bank of England was involved, and he
saw that he must confide to Harris and Rodman the watching of
events, and trust for the best.</p>

<p>Sibella kept to her rooms all the afternoon. Her father was up
in town for the night, closely watched.</p>

<p>One of Pointer's best men from New Scotland Yard was shadowing
the count. Rodman, who was proving himself quite good, was ready to
take up the chase if Sibella stirred. Her car, Rose's car it had
been, was left turned in the garage. The inspector had noted the
full tank.</p>

<p>At eight a door creaked. Down the stairs stole Sibella, wrapped
in a motoring cloak, with a dark veil wound closely around cap and
face, leaving only a mica slit for her eyes. She looked like a
rather bulky mummy, but the mummy could see all right, for she made
her way swiftly into the grounds.</p>

<p>At the first sound of her, Rodman was out of the lounge where he
and Harris had installed themselves behind a couple of easy-chairs.
When she reached the garage he was through the front gates, bending
over his bicycle.</p>

<p>Hanging on behind, the inspector was driven by Sibella into town
and up to a well-known Italian restaurant near Victoria
station.</p>

<p>Here she slowed up preparatory to stopping. He fell behind, and
getting off, stood with his back to her, talking to a match
seller.</p>

<p>"The count's been in here half an hour, sir," the plain clothes
man reported, "wrapped up like a conspirator. I think he feels a
draught, if you ask me. He's engaged a couple of private rooms.
Dinner for one was ready when he came. It's just been cleared away.
Coffee for two's been upstairs three minutes. Luigi tells me
there's an Aberdeen terrier of the proprietor's on guard outside
the door who growls at every foot-fall."</p>

<p>"Did the Chief Inspector give you any further instructions?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. To follow the count afterwards. If he goes back to
his flat I'm off for home, too. There's another chap watching his
rooms all night."</p>

<p>"Good. I'll follow the lady."</p>

<p>It was not a long wait, an hour at most, before the two
reappeared in the door. Rodman watched the Alfa Romeo glide away
into the darkness. Then he attached himself again to the back of
Sibella's car, and was driven home to Stillwater once more.</p>

<p>Close to the main gate he dropped behind. After some minutes he
slipped through, stacked his bicycle behind a potting shed, and
crept into the house.</p>

<p>Behind his arm-chair sat Harris.</p>

<p>"Gone up yet, sir?" whispered Rodman.</p>

<p>"Hasn't come in yet."</p>

<p>They waited a little longer. Then Rodman rose. "I'm going to the
garage to see if anything's up."</p>

<p>Sibella's cubicle was empty. The inspector dared not switch on
the light. She might be waiting outside on the drive. He crept
forward foot by foot along its winding curves, the awful truth
rising higher with every step.</p>

<p>Sibella had gone.</p>

<p>She must have nosed the car down the drive, lights out, and
passed on into the road again through one of the two other
gates.</p>

<p>He went indoors and asked Harris in a whisper to come out.</p>

<p>"Did you follow her all right?" asked the superintendent.</p>

<p>"All wrong!" groaned Rodman, and he told of his failure.</p>

<p>"Too bad," sympathised the kindly Harris. "Would have happened
to any one. But not to Alf," he said privately. "Alf never gets
left. Never did. Wherever do you think she's gone to?" he asked
aloud.</p>

<p>Rodman wisely refused to start a list of the towns and villages
of England.</p>

<p>"Well, when you feel like tackling an early worm, come around to
my house. I'm off for bed, as there seems nothing doing here that
one man can't handle."</p>

<p>And Rodman certainly did not, and could not, consider himself
overworked for the remainder of the night.</p>

<p>It was nearly six in the morning when, like music to the tired
ears of the detective, came the sound of the little two-seater
again. The front gates opened once more. This time Sibella left her
car in the garage, and walked rapidly towards the house. By the
light of early day, Rodman had traced the marks of last night quite
easily. They ran as he had expected.</p>

<p>At the police station he found the Chief Inspector in possession
of the news. Pointer greeted him with at least outward calmness,
though he looked very thoughtful. Poor Rodman could hardly swallow
a morsel of food.</p>

<p>Half-way through the meal Briggs's voice sounded outside, all
eagerness.</p>

<p>"The report's come in from the man who's watching the count's
rooms, sir. This <i>is</i> a rum go, and no mistake!"</p>

<p>Pointer lingered to finish his cup of tea. It must serve him at
a pinch instead of a night's sleep. Harris shook his head as he led
the way into the station.</p>

<p>"A little more of what the chief calls '<i>tenew</i>' wouldn't
harm you, Briggs. You might be an old maid receiving her first
proposal. Why, you're all of a twitter. Now let's learn the
damage."</p>

<p>Harris took the receiver, and listened with a slowly opening
mouth.</p>

<p>"You don't&mdash;not Miss&mdash;not&mdash;well, I'm blowed!" And
the upholder of <i>tenew</i> dropped into a chair, then looked at
Rodman.</p>

<p>"Some one's drunk. Either you, or me, or that chap who's just
reported. Didn't you follow Miss Scarlett all the way back from the
restaurant here?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, the Yard 'tec says she left Count di Monti's rooms at
exactly ten minutes past five this morning."</p>

<p>Pointer, who had come into the room, stared at Harris as though
the truth lay graven on the superintendent's very spine, and
stretched for the receiver. Then he dropped his hand.</p>

<p>"I'll go myself. But what's the good? There's no need to
hurry&mdash;now!"</p>

<p>"You talking English?" Harris asked curiously.</p>

<p>"I'll translate." Pointer spoke rather dryly. "Inspector Rodman
followed, not Miss Scarlett, but II Primo Capitano del Fascio
Arditi, Conte Cangrande Giulio di Monti commanding the 41st Legion
of the II. Cohort, from the restaurant to Stillwater last
night.</p>

<p>"You said you noticed how much better she was driving, as though
she had a weight off her mind," He turned to the breathless Rodman.
"The two changed rigs in restaurant, and what with those cloaks,
her veiling, his goggles, besides some sort of a lift inside her
shoes, they fooled you, Rodman. But that's what happened. Doubtless
they chose that restaurant because it's one of the few where cars
can be parked practically at the door. She went to his rooms and
stayed there till he should be safely aboard a ship, friend's yacht
probably. He bought a duplicate outfit of the clothes she was
wearing, and left it at his flat for her, as well as a woman's
rigout for himself, which latter he sends in a box to the
restaurant. She rests in peace and quiet in his rooms, and changes
again. At the hour agreed on, five, she comes down to Stillwater by
taxi. He leaves her two-seater at some place not far off, when he's
picked up by a friend's motor. There you have their little plan.
Simple, eh?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad it ain't what I first thought!" Briggs said
simply.</p>

<p>"So 'm I!" said Harris. "Though helping a murderer, to escape!
In love with him. Must be! If so, this version sounds the sort of
thing Miss Sib might do. She's all the 'go' of the Scarletts in
her. But to connive at an escape!" Harris ruminated on. "She has
gone and got herself into a nice fix! She can't have thought him
guilty, that's sure!"</p>

<p>"On the contrary," Pointer almost laughed, "on the contrary! It
shows that di Monti told her that he murdered Miss Charteris. Or
Miss Scarlett would never have done what she did. If, by some
mischance, say a fire, she had been found in his rooms! She
wouldn't have run that risk unless she thought beyond a chance of a
mistake both that he was guilty, and that he was in a very tight
place. I rather felt that he was putting his back against the wall
when I met him on the stairs of his rooms. Now what could
have&mdash;I won't say frightened him, di Monti isn't a
frightenable, man&mdash;but shown him that if he wanted to get away
he must do so at once?"</p>

<p>And as though it were a play at a theatre, and those words his
cue, a constable entered the room and supplied the answer.</p>

<p>He held out a pear-shaped, dark blue stone that glittered and
sparkled as though rolled in gold dust. At the smaller end was a
wreath of silver leaves with clusters of grapes in amethysts and
garnets. A grape tendril served as a loop, and cut into the other
end were three gold bails and the initials C.M. It was the Medici
pendant.</p>

<p>"Where in the world did you get this from?" Superintendent
Harris got out his notebook.</p>

<p>"From Fiery Jim, sir."</p>

<p>"Temper?" asked Pointer.</p>

<p>"Neither. He's a good sort, is poor Jim, but he can't resist a
fire. Born that way. Chronic. He'd set fire to himself if there
were no other way of turning out the fire brigade, and they don't
like it. Neither do the farmers."</p>

<p>"Naturally?"</p>

<p>"Very naturally. So we see to it that he stays in workhouses
when he's not in prison. Never for anything but incendiarism, I
assure you. He's quite a favourite, when he's safe. There's no vice
in Fiery Jim."</p>

<p>"And how does he explain this find?"</p>

<p>"The shepherd put me on to him, sir. He'd noticed' him playing
with it. At first the old chap took it for granted it was a piece
of glass, but when he looked closer he recognised it by the
description, and brought Jim here."</p>

<p>"Have him in."</p>

<p>Fiery Jim was not good at consecutive narrative. But the
superintendent was capital on this, his own ground, and unwound him
as I neatly as a silk spinner would a cocoon, firmly but gently
drawing from him what he wanted.</p>

<p>Jim's many half-tales, woven together, made this:</p>

<p>Last Thursday night he was walking along the short cut on an
errand from the Master of Medchester workhouse with a boy as
guardian, when they saw a tall, dark, well-dressed man come
striding out from the copse. This was just as the church clock
struck ten, for it was to count the strokes that the two had
stopped and turned. Jim saw that the man was a stranger, and asked
for a match. The stranger didn't understand. Jim held out his hand,
repeating his request. The man seemed to mistake him for a beggar.
He snarled out something about an echo, and flung a stone at him.
Jim's black eye was an "exhibit" to this part of the story. The
stranger tore on, and Jim groped for the stone, to carry it and his
tale to the Master. But he liked the way it flashed, and sparkled,
and kept it as a plaything, taking it out every now and then, and
watching it. Fiery Jim had no idea of values.</p>

<p>Harris sent him in to have "something from Mrs. Harris," after
he had made quite sure that Jim could not identify the man.</p>

<p>"We don't need identification beyond what he heard," Pointer
said at once "The echo that Jim heard spoken about was, of course,
the Italian for here!'&mdash;Ecco! This only bears out what we know
already, but it does explain as well why the count decided to leave
so hurriedly."</p>

<p>"Once he knew or heard that that pendant was found he was up a
tree!" Superintendent Harris agreed, locking the stone carefully
away in the safe. "The chief told me that on Saturday the count had
spoken of a large reward he wanted to offer for this stone, and
then on Monday morning he had dropped in to say that on the whole
he thought he would postpone the offer till he heard from his
father."</p>

<p>"Just so," Pointer stared at his boot tips. "His flinging that
stone at Jim here is all of a piece with his slashing Miss
Charteris's portrait, with his dropping a pebble or two on her
coffin, with his trampling on the flowers that she had worn in the
studio, and which came off as she scrambled out of the window, I
suppose, or which she took off when she flung her knitted frock on
over the other. Yes, the count both wanted, and feared, to get that
stone back. If he could lay his hands on it again without any risk
of it leaking out how and when he had flung it away, he wanted it
back in safe keeping. But as soon as he remembered that the man at
whom he had dashed it in his mad fury at ten on Thursday night
might bring it to the police instead of to him, he decided to let
sleeping dogs lie. So that was why he insisted at the inquest and
afterwards on the fact that it was of no value whatever. Not of
much value, perhaps, but of considerable danger&mdash;to him!"</p>

<p>"I see it all now." Harris spoke as though the sight were rather
pleasant, compared with some mental visions which had been
vouchsafed him lately.</p>

<p>A telephone inquiry confirmed Pointer. Di Monti's rooms were
empty. Master and man had gone, and had their luggage, conveyed
piecemeal to cleaners and bootmakers by the astute valet to be
re-assembled elsewhere, and packed in new valises.</p>

<p>Pointer had hardly rung off when his telephone tinkled
again.</p>

<p>"Chief Inspector Pointer wanted. Mr. Gilchrist speaking."</p>

<p>Speaking, apparently, from the context both as coroner and as
the Charteris's family solicitor.</p>

<p>"I acted on your suggestion, and managed to reach Miss Jones,
the professor's secretary, who was on a walking tour in Devon. She
went up to his club last night and fetched his correspondence. The
hall porter knows her, and that she is empowered by the professor
himself to take charge of any letters in an emergency."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Pointer, for there is no place in the world more
inviolable than the letter-rack of a club, and within the august
portals of the Athenum, Scotland Yard's highest were lower than the
youngest buttons.</p>

<p>"If you care to step in this morning about eleven," Mr.
Gilchrist went on "she'll be here with the letters and you can have
a look at them."</p>

<p>Pointer was prompt to the minute. He found Miss. Jones to be an
intelligent, middle-aged woman, evidently devoted to her employer
and his interests.</p>

<p>"Here is a letter which the professor has sent, addressed to
himself and sealed, in another covering-envelope, also so
addressed." Gilchrist handed it over to be looked at.</p>

<p>"He often sends me private papers in that way," Miss. Jones
explained, as had Sibella before. "I put them in his desk, just as
they are, till his return."</p>

<p>Pointer saw a long envelope, looking much the worse for wear,
having evidently been folded across the middle, sealed with black
wax, and addressed to Professor H. Charteris.</p>

<p>"Where's the envelope it came in?" he asked.</p>

<p>Miss Jones fished it out of the waste-paper basket.</p>

<p>It was addressed to the professor at his club, and had been sent
from Milan on the Friday that Rose had been found murdered.</p>

<p>The handwriting on the outer envelope was not Professor
Charteris's, but Miss Jones explained that his eyesight being weak
when he had mislaid his glasses, which occurred every five minutes,
he would commission the nearest-at-hand waiter, or hall-porter, to
address an envelope for him.</p>

<p>"You have not heard from him otherwise in any way?"</p>

<p>She had not. Like the solicitor, she was not in the least
anxious on account of the silence, though the latter was beginning
to think it time that Charteris should come across the daily
advertisement asking him to wire or write, if he could not come to
England.</p>

<p>"I should like to examine this a little more closely." Pointer
still held the long envelope with the black seals. "I should like
to photograph it at my rooms."</p>

<p>"Short of opening it, you're welcome to do whatever you think
fit," Gilchrist said heartily. "The rest are a couple of circulars
of no importance."</p>

<p>Pointer, in his own rooms at the police station, tried the
little fragments of black sealing-wax that he had found in the
professor's envelope that he had fished out of Rose's chain bag and
taken from the table in the studio. He found that they were not too
numerous to have dropped off the seals if the letter had been
carried about for some hours.</p>

<p>He believed, from the envelope's frayed look, that this was the
same letter that had been posted to England once before, reaching
Rose on Thursday at tea-time, and which had not been seen since her
death. There was still a faint fragrance lingering about the flap
that matched the perfume in her bag. The description tallied
absolutely. He looked up the trains in Bradshaw. It was now
Saturday.</p>

<p>Suppose some one left London by the boat train either Thursday
night or even Friday morning and his Paris-Milan express was on
time, then he would have an hour in Milan station in which to post
the letter back again in the returning Milan-Paris express.</p>

<p>That looked as though some one had taken the letter by mistake,
or accident, and posted it from Italy in order to make it seem as
though the professor were sending it. In that case, it must be some
one who knew that the professor had sent it, to his daughter in the
first place, but that she was now dead.</p>

<p>Suppose that he, Pointer, were right, and that Rose had taken it
with her in her little bag to the studio, had noticed it when
there, and, taking it out, had laid it on the table by the door, in
a place where she thought that she could not overlook it on
leaving, had forgotten it in her hurried dash when she heard the
furious Italian at the front door. Suppose that di Monti, finding
Rose gone, had swooped on the proof of her presence in the room.
Pointer imagined that he might intend to keep it to confront her
with. But after her murder the letter would be very incriminating
evidence. Yet, however violent, di Monti was a gentleman. He might
kill, but Pointer could not see him tampering with
correspondence.</p>

<p>Pointer imagined him giving the letter to a friend. In all
likelihood to a brother of the Prince Cornaro who had confirmed the
count's alibi. For Scotland Yard knew that young Prince Amadeo
Cornaro had left early on Friday morning for Italy. Certainly the
envelope must have been returned by some one who knew of the
professor's little way of sending securely fastened letters back to
himself.</p>

<p>Pointer photographed the envelope. There were no signs of its
having been tampered with in any way Or rather, to his microscopic
scrutiny, it showed many little proofs that it had not been
opened.</p>

<p>With a thin, warm knife he sliced off the seals, and then
steamed open the envelope. Inside was a single sheet of paper,
headed, in the professor's writing, "Memo on Refractions." Below
came couple of lines of figures and equations.</p>

<p>Pointer photographed the paper and fastened the envelope up
again exactly as it had been. When the wax was cold he returned it
to Gilchrist, who put it with the professor's private papers.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER SEVEN</h2>

<p class="first">DRIVING to New Scotland Yard at once, Pointer
learnt that the memo was of no value, though it was connected, as
he had surmised, with the manufacture of emeralds.</p>

<p>This was a blow. He had expected something from those
algebraical formulae. What, he himself hardly knew. But something
big.</p>

<p>He dropped in at his Bayswater rooms and found O'Connor waiting
for him with lunch. Over the cheese, and a pile of the curly toast
beloved of the Chief Inspector, thin, and brown, and crisp, as
birch leaves in a frost, he told his friend of the latest
developments.</p>

<p>"So the letter isn't the clue after all!"</p>

<p>"Why not? I seem to've been misled as to its contents. Suppose
some one else was mistaken, too? Suppose I wasn't the only one who
hoped for something different from what was there? A hunt after
letters, or papers, runs through this case. There was the search
among the professor's rooms shortly after his daughter was found
dead. Then there's the theft of Miss Charteris's own letters from
the chief constable's house."</p>

<p>"And there's the Odyssey of this enclosed letter itself. The one
just sent back from Milan. Though, faith, it doesn't look the sort
of thing to interest the count," mused O'Connor. "But it might some
of the others. How about getting him back again, by the way?"</p>

<p>"It'll only be a matter of days before the Yard learns of his
whereabouts, unless he intends to go permanently into hiding."</p>

<p>"But when you've got him," O'Connor went on, "you've still to
find the motive for all the rest of that Thursday night show. The
moving of the body, and what happened on those flags. D'ye think
the colonel could help you to a short cut?"</p>

<p>"I told the superintendent that Scarlett's a difficult man to
read, and so he is. At first he acted as though a weight were
lifting off him. Yet every hour that passes without disclosing the
criminal in a case of this kind usually gets on people's nerves.
And now lately, he's just opposite. He looks to me like a man
ridden by some ever-growing fear. He's all on the <i>qui vive</i>
every time any one approaches him suddenly."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he's afraid for himself, or his daughter?"</p>

<p>"Neither. He never carries even a stout stick. There isn't a
fire-arm handy in the house. He takes no precautions. But he does
take two Italian papers since about a week ago. About the time of
the murder."</p>

<p>"I wonder if he's in this," O'Connor speculated, "with di Monti
and that Mrs. Lane. Of course, we know di Monti struck the blow,
but who else was there?"</p>

<p>"The funny thing is," Pointer reached up for a Chinese
ball-puzzle on the mantelpiece above him, "that I've a perfectly
unsound idea, which I wouldn't mention to any one but you,
connecting Mrs. Lane with&mdash;not di Monti nor the
colonel&mdash;but with Thornton."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"Difficult to explain. He's never natural when her name comes
up. Either too indifferent, or changes the subject, or
something&mdash;I can't put a name to it. But I've had from the
first a very strong feeling that she moves him, touches him in some
quite peculiar way."</p>

<p>"In love with her?"</p>

<p>"Why not be so openly? All our accounts show that he rarely
talked much to her, nor she to him. Yet he kept his eyes on Mrs.
Lane, and on Mrs. Lane alone, at the inquest, once the doctor began
to stir things up. As she went out she looked at him. Odd look. One
I haven't a label for."</p>

<p>"You'd expect that she and di Monti would be standing in
together&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then that won't be what we'll find," Pointer said dryly.</p>

<p>"And how's the pencil getting along?" asked the Irishman.</p>

<p>"It's feeling a bit lonely, but still hopeful. So far, it's only
led us into <i>cul-de-sacs</i>, but as it's my best find, I mustn't
decry it."</p>

<p>There was a long silence while the two old friends smoked
on.</p>

<p>"Could that formula be more valuable than you think?" O'Connor
asked at length.</p>

<p>"Our expert is quite certain. It's not possible for him to be
mistaken."</p>

<p>"True. One never did hear of a policeman making a mistake,"
O'Connor murmured pensively.</p>

<p>"But unless the owner of the pencil turns up, I'm running over
to Italy the day after to-morrow to see if I can't find
Charteris."</p>

<p>"You are, eh?" O'Connor eyed him gravely, speculatively.</p>

<p>"And," Pointer returned his look, "I feel, like you, by no means
certain that I shall find him."</p>

<p>"Looks that way to me. If his daughter was killed for anything
to do with a letter which he might have written or sent. And what's
the artist doing all this time?"</p>

<p>"Bellairs? He comes back from Windsor Castle tonight But I'm
going to leave him alone for the moment He's watched, of course,
but I'm trying to unwind the affair from the other end."</p>

<p>"And the chief constable down there. How's he getting along?"
O'Connor liked to keep count of all the cast.</p>

<p>Pointer laughed. "I may be doing a most zealous officer a bitter
injustice. But I suspect him of being exceedingly glad that he's
out of it all. The colonel and his friends are all friends of Major
Vaughan's, too. We'll see a marked improvement when this case is
settled one way or another, I fancy. And it's going to take some
stiff routine work before it's settled. It's the most extraordinary
affair for one reason. You'd expect a gang of apaches to hang
together, whatever the crimes, but the Stillwater crowd are all
well-to-do, well-behaved, wellborn. They're not like a tenement
house of starving east-enders."</p>

<p>"Me noble father having been Court Chamberlain, and talking as I
am to the belted son of a duke," O'Connor murmured lackadaisically,
"it's natural we should look on tenement-house dwellers with proper
scorn."</p>

<p>Pointer grunted. "You know what I mean," he said impertinently.
"Of all that Stillwater circle, there's not one, not one, mind you,
of whom I can say with absolute certainty, 'Whoever's in it, it
isn't he!'"</p>

<p>"Him!" retorted O'Connor, "don't be a prig, Alf. You wouldn't
say 'It isn't he under any circumstances,' and you know it."</p>

<p>"It isn't he," Pointer repeated unmoved. Not to him had the
English grammar come unprized, as a birthright. Son of a
coast-guard, it was with many an hour's work that he had bought
freedom in it, and he valued that ease accordingly.</p>

<p>"And yet all of them should be above suspicion by their
positions, you'd think. But they're all in it, in the most baffling
way. There's the colonel&mdash;apart from everything else, why did
he cut down that blackthorn tree before any one was up on Friday
morning? But his record is quite all right. Late of the 10th
Hussars. No shady relations. Only son's a Commissioner in Uganda.
The last <i>Tanganyka Times</i> is full of some exploration of his
around in the interior. Then there's Mr. Thornton&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He called you down, didn't he? Ungrateful bobby!"</p>

<p>"I allow him due credit, for, without his having done that, the
threads of this case would have been impossible to pick
up&mdash;from this end. There're always two ways of reaching any
goal. But he's an odd fish. He's not straight with me. His hand,
mind you, was practically forced by two young men from the Foreign
Office."</p>

<p>"But who is he?"</p>

<p>"Took high honours at New College. Member of the bar. Councillor
to various embassies abroad for some years. Travelled a bit in
Persia. Knows everybody, and yet hasn't an intimate friend, unless
it be Professor Charteris.</p>

<p>"Then take Mr. Cockburn and Mr. Bond. We know all about them,
too. Blameless pasts, promising futures. Yet I found them breaking
into the colonel's study on Friday evening."</p>

<p>"In order to help the case forward," put in O'Connor.</p>

<p>"So they say! Then the women. Mrs. Lane's, of course, the dark
horse of the outfit, so far. There's only one thing I can prove for
certain against her, whatever we may think, and that is that it was
from her silk cloak that the piece is missing which I found in the
clutch of Thornton's car. As she wore the same cloak driving in to
town on Friday, and made no complaint about it, and told the maid
that she had just stepped on it while getting out, I take it that
she tore it herself. Then there's Lady Maxwell. It's her frock
that's bloodstained, and the colonel backs off at sight of her.
Then Miss Scarlett&mdash;she's too much shaken by her cousin's
death. She looks like a ghost."</p>

<p>"You're hard to satisfy, Alf."</p>

<p>"I try to be."</p>

<p>"But who, in God's name, would shield the murderer of that
lovely girl?" O'Connor asked. "You'd have thought the count would
have had short shrift from every one down there. Do you think it's
two sets of crimes? Jealousy that struck the blow, and then some
other interest altogether? Something to do with the enclosed letter
that moved the corpse and searched the bag?"</p>

<p>"I'd rather not say what I think just yet, but the professor has
some very important affairs bubbling along, apart from the
emeralds."</p>

<p>There was a short silence, then O'Connor paused in his work.</p>

<p>"That man you're trying to get hold of seems to be an extra down
there? I mean, the man of the summer house. I suppose he couldn't
be the professor returned unexpectedly? Perhaps saw his daughter
murdered, and went for the murderer?" O'Connor asked,
half-sceptical of his own fancy.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Pointer replied seriously, "but I do know that
neither the professor nor any one else even remotely connected with
what I call the Stillwater circle was the man inside the summer
house bedroom. I've examined all their finger-prints most
carefully."</p>

<p>Back at the police station Inspector Rodman met Pointer with a
face officially wooden, but with a very human satisfaction
betraying itself in his voice.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Lane's lost, too, sir. The detective from the Yard has
just 'phoned to you to report as much."</p>

<p>"She went into one of those all-over-the-place shops, and they
haven't seen her since," moaned Harris. "Lost in London!"</p>

<p>Pointer gave him a fleeting smile.</p>

<p>"Sounds like the title of a film, and you might be the bereaved
parent. She's not out of reach. On the whole, its possibly as well.
We were getting a bit stale. Now she thinks she's safe, and she may
send some message that will let us get hold of things more
important still. And who are these in bright array?"</p>

<p>It was Cockburn and Bond, driving up post haste. They had just
learnt of the count's disappearance from his rooms in town, and
were down to find out if there was still nothing that they could
do.</p>

<p>Harris, according to the immemorial rule of the Force, assured
them that all had gone according to plan. The two young men looked
as unbelieving as though they were hearing that time-honoured
phrase in a battle report.</p>

<p>"I'd got quite a step along," Cockburn put in disconsolately, "I
mean finding out that his alibi was rocky. Not bad that for an
amateur, was it?" He looked at Pointer for approval, and he got it
very heartily. Cockburn had done quite well in finding out the
shakiness of the much-vaunted alibi.</p>

<p>"The count isn't out of reach," Pointer assured the two friends.
"Safely isolated is the way to look at it. But if either of you
could find out anything about the plans of the Inner Fascist
Council in Rome concerning meetings, places, and so on, we might be
able to guess where next to locate him. I don't deny that in
matters of this kind, the Foreign Office naturally has a great pull
over the Secret Service."</p>

<p>They drove off quite full of how the news might possibly be
obtained through a certain agent which the F. O. employed in the
heart of Roman aristocracy, which is tantamount to saying in the
heart of Fascist circles. That done, Pointer turned his attention
to the two microphone-dictaphones which Rodman and one of Scotland
Yard's flying squad brought in daily. Stillwater House telephone
and the telephone of the Army and Navy Club, the only one which the
colonel now used, were both connected with these useful
inventions.</p>

<p>For at the club, one of the waiters, after a talk with Detective
Inspector Watts of Scotland Yard, had decided that he was feeling
run down, and that a week's breathing of the pure ozone of
Brighton's picture-palaces would just suit his budding
complaint.</p>

<p>So Watts, who, it seemed, was his brother, took his place, and
was proving a most efficient locum tenens from every point of
view.</p>

<p>All messages received by either house were repeated into the
attentive ear of the Chief Inspector twice daily.</p>

<p>Suddenly Pointer gave an inward start. He was busy with the club
records.</p>

<p>"Sir Henry Carew, please," asked a woman's voice, the voice of
Mrs. Lane. "Will you ask him to come to the telephone for a
minute?"</p>

<p>There was a pause. Then the voice came again.</p>

<p>"Sir Henry Carew? Good-morning, Sir Henry. You know who's
speaking, don't you? Will you tell our friend that M. M. is quite
satisfied. He thinks the horse is getting on excellently. Yes,
that's all. Good-bye."</p>

<p>The remainder of the messages were of no importance.</p>

<p>"M. M.!" Pointer arranged with Harris and Rodman to "carry on,"
and sped up to his friend the divisional surgeon.</p>

<p>"Look here, Scott, I want you to get me into Sir Martin
Martineau's home. You told me he was chiefly for head-trouble or
accidents. Channel islander, I think you said. I've a splitting
headache. Had it for days. My eyes pain me every time I turn them.
When I suddenly stop walking, I see strange flashes&mdash;"</p>

<p>Doctor Scott hummed a tune with heartless accuracy as he walked
over to his shelves. He pulled out a book.</p>

<p>"If I had this beggar examined by some of your unholy arts at
the Yard, I should find your finger-prints on it, Pointer. You were
left here for just ten minutes while I wrote out that girl's
prescription, and you haven't wasted one of them."</p>

<p>"My name's Brown," Pointer went on, "and I had a motor smash a
few days ago. It's since then my head hurts me so."</p>

<p>Pointer slumped back in his chair, and gave a groan. Scott
turned around with a startled exclamation. "Where in the world did
you pick that up? That groan, I mean?"</p>

<p>Pointer looked at him with a twinkle.</p>

<p>"I studied that for a matter of days and nights when I was in
charge of a very prominent Greek gentleman who feared
assassination. We had a stormy sea all the way from Portsmouth to
the Pireus, and he spent every hour of it groaning. I stored them
up for future need. I used to practise with him, up and down, to
make sure the timbre was right. He thought the sea affected me too.
But you've only heard the Channel one; you wait till I let off my
Cape Matapan heartbreaker. He's a peach!"</p>

<p>"How long do you expect to be in that home before they turn you
out as an impostor?"</p>

<p>"How can I be an impostor when I pay my way? I may be a
neurasthenic, but only poor chaps are impostors."</p>

<p>"Well, how long do you expect to stay?"</p>

<p>"One night will do."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, in that case&mdash;as a matter of fact, Sir
Martin's away in Scotland, I saw in the papers, so now's your
chance."</p>

<p>"I suppose he won't operate on me in my sleep?" Pointer was just
a trifle in earnest. He had no love for surgeons.</p>

<p>"My dear chap, you won't get within a dozen rooms of his knife.
They'll X-ray you first, find nothing the matter, and tell you so
at once."</p>

<p>"Good. 'Phone up for me and ask for their best room. I'll take a
taxi after a little preparation. May I use your bedroom?"</p>

<p>Pointer dressed himself in purple and fine linen, and packed an
expensively-fitted bag with clothes to match. A skilful sprinkling
of bleached hairs was all that he dared try, but that, and his
drooping, quivering lids, and tremulous, saggy mouth, and slouching
attitude made a marvellous difference.</p>

<p>"I hope I shall live to get there, doctor," he mumbled as Scott
hailed a taxi and Pointer hobbled down the steps, "I hope so
indeed!" And he gave a moan that made the driver's spine,
crawl.</p>

<p>As for Doctor Scott, to the man's indignation, he merely, shut
the door and said callously, "Oh, you'll be all right, if you pull
yourself together and make an effort, Mr. Brown." He gave a signal
and off Pointer started.</p>

<p>The doctor's telephone message had made the entering of the
handsome old Georgian house quite easy. A sympathetic matron
superintended his entry on the arm of a solicitous house-porter.
His room was ready for him. In about an hour he would be X-rayed,
and then the trouble would be easily found. Sir Martin would be
back tomorrow afternoon, and possibly by the next day all would be
right. Thus the matron, and Pointer nodded wearily as he sat in the
lift huddled together. When it stopped, he gave one of his groans,
Bay of Biscay this time, and had the satisfaction of seeing the
matron nearly trip over the sill. Without a word, she had him
helped to his room, and tiptoed out, saying that she would send
Nurse Mason to him at once.</p>

<p>Pointer's eyes, deep hidden under his nearly closed lids,
studied the young woman attentively. He did not often make a
mistake, if the person left a clear impression on him, and Miss
Mason left a very distinct one. He judged her to be both
exceedingly honest, and exceedingly loyal. Most estimable
qualities, as he was the first to admit, but not at all what he was
in search of to-night. A few hours later Pointer was shown into the
X-ray room by an orderly, and took an instant liking to his foxy
face with the avaricious mouth.</p>

<p>"Come to my room the last thing to-night," Pointer muttered, and
the man bowed with a knowing and obsequious smile, "Very good,
sir."</p>

<p>Something in a glass for the patient, and something in his
pocket for himself, was the usual outcome of this often heard
remark. Once they were "cases" the thing was too risky, of course,
but beforehand&mdash;why not let them have a cocktail?</p>

<p>So at eleven o'clock that night in slipped Mr. Keane. He saw in
the light of the reading lamp a bulky something in bed, and closed
the door with a gentle cough.</p>

<p>"I'm come, sir."</p>

<p>He turned with a gasp. The door was locked behind him, and
Pointer faced him with a very masterful look.</p>

<p>"It's all right; don't be alarmed, man! I'm a private detective.
I want some information on behalf of a wealthy, client who's
prepared to pay for it."</p>

<p>"Well, this is a movie!" The man grinned. "To think those moans
of yours were fakes! They'd make the fortune of a street beggar,
wouldn't they! Nearly froze my blood, they did, and I've heard some
in my time. But what's all this about?"</p>

<p>"It's about a man who was brought in here late last, Thursday
night, May 1st, with some cuts on him." Pointer took out his
notebook and also a five-pound note. "Know anything about such a
man?"</p>

<p>"Is that a book-mark?" asked Keane, looking at it.</p>

<p>"It's a prize for a bright boy," Pointer assured him "Did any
man come here that night?"</p>

<p>"I know that a chap came, but that's all that I do know."</p>

<p>"Can you get me a glimpse of him?"</p>

<p>"Nothing doing," the man said glumly. "Had your groans for
nothing. No one is allowed near that room but her High Mightiness
the Matron and her equally Grand Highness Nurse Mason. He's had an
operation, by Sir Martin on Saturday, and seems to be doing well as
Mr. Carlyle, that's the house doctor and assistant surgeon, only
visits him night and morning. That enough for a fiver?"</p>

<p>Pointer shook his head and returned the note to his
letter-case.</p>

<p>"Might run to ten shillings," he said musingly.</p>

<p>"And how do I know who you are? Looks a fishy job to me, if ever
I saw one."</p>

<p>"I'm Merton, of Merton and Mertons, private detectives. There's
my card; you can 'phone to my office and ask about me."</p>

<p>The head of the firm in question was an ex-inspector of the
Yard, and Pointer had made his arrangements. Keane looked at the
ten-shilling note.</p>

<p>"Hand it over then."</p>

<p>Pointer cocked his head on one side.</p>

<p>"Takes a bit of earning, does a ten-shilling note these hard
times, my man. I might raise it to a pound if I could see into the
room for a second."</p>

<p>"You might!" ironically repeated the other, "and what price my
place? Nothing doing!"</p>

<p>"I might double that again if I could go over the clothes the
young man wore when he came. I suppose he is a young man?"</p>

<p>The ten shillings changed hands.</p>

<p>"Can't say. How's that for honesty? I never saw him. The matron
and Mr. Carlyle were waiting for the car, and got him on to the
stretcher themselves. His mother helped them."</p>

<p>"Was that usual? The house-surgeon and the matron being on the
lookout like that?"</p>

<p>"Not unusual, perhaps. But they've never made such a fuss before
about not letting any one into the room afterwards. I happened to
open the door by mistake, and that Mason snapped my nose off."</p>

<p>"Severe case, eh?"</p>

<p>"Not since the operation. There's been no call for ice bags, let
alone the oxygen pump. But that stretcher was a sight! He must have
all but cut an artery."</p>

<p>Then Keane went off for the clothes.</p>

<p>"Nothing doing," he said on his return "Blest if they haven't
gone. To the cleaners and laundry, says the tag hanging in their
place. But his shoes have gone, too! And a travelling rug, that I
know came with him, isn't there. Fine and stained it was, too."</p>

<p>Pointer got the name of the laundry and cleaners generally
patronised by the institution.</p>

<p>"When was the operation?"</p>

<p>"Tuesday morning."</p>

<p>The date was the first Tuesday after Rose's death. "Sister in
charge of the theatre approachable?"</p>

<p>"I don't think!" Keane made a grimace which it took handsomer
features than his to carry off successfully.</p>

<p>"Now, the man's mother, can you describe her?"</p>

<p>"Tall and slender. Veiled like one of those Eastern Harems."</p>

<p>"Came in a car?" Pointer asked</p>

<p>"She did. What's more, she drove it in. I was a bit late coming
in, and I happened to slip in behind it."</p>

<p>"But if she was closely veiled, how did she drive?"</p>

<p>"Well, that's funny, now you speak of it, but I happened to be
going out of the gate when she drove off&mdash;to post a letter,
you know&mdash;I again happened to see her meet a big stout man
around the first corner. She got out and stood talking for a minute
Then he put his arms round her and kissed her, and after that he
climbed into the driving seat and they drove off."</p>

<p>"Kissed her?" Something in his tone made Keane glance at him out
of the corners of his eyes.</p>

<p>"You seem struck all of a heap. He kissed her as though he meant
it, too. None of your hit or miss pecks."</p>

<p>"I thought you said she was veiled so tightly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, what of it? He kissed one cheek, veil and all, and looked
as though he would have been quite pleased to kiss the other, but
she stepped on into the car."</p>

<p>"Did she seem to mind being kissed? Move away, I mean, or
that?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit. She sort of half-leant her head on his shoulder,
like as though she were dead tired, you know, before she bucked up
and got into the car."</p>

<p>Pointer spread his photographs on the table.</p>

<p>"Can you recognise him?"</p>

<p>"That's him." The man picked up one of Colonel Scarlett. "That's
him, right enough."</p>

<p>"Could you swear to him?"</p>

<p>"Till all's blue."</p>

<p>"Good. Now I want something with the patient's finger-prints on
it. A tumbler, how would that do? Could you manage to get me the
one he uses?"</p>

<p>Keane shook his head.</p>

<p>"No more than you could sneak the King's sceptre. He's guarded
night and day."</p>

<p>"Guarded?"</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think? Of course, Sir Martin is always
careful, but over this case! I tell you that chap hasn't been left
alone for a half-second. He's of tremendous importance to
somebody."</p>

<p>Pointer thought a moment</p>

<p>"What is Sir Martin's general fee for head operations?"</p>

<p>"Plain sailing ones, fifty pounds; dicky ones, a hundred. Not
going to be done for the fun of the thing, are you?"</p>

<p>Pointer was thinking of a cheque to "Self" that the colonel had
drawn on Friday as soon as the banks were open. It had been for two
hundred pounds, and he had asked for it all in Bradburys.</p>

<p>Pointer dismissed the orderly and walked the floor, knee-deep in
the detached facts of the case. They still refused to shape into
that neat circle which alone means the true theory of a crime. Yet
they were so numerous that he felt sure that the essential ones
were here to hand, buried though they might be beneath accidentals.
They could not all be tangents by rights.</p>

<p>As he picked them up one by one, and examined and tested each
afresh, he found that there was one fact told him, and accepted by
him, which, if broken, would let all the rest link in one behind
the other.</p>

<p>Next morning he was as keen to be off as any belated burglar.
The house-surgeon explained that there could be nothing organic the
matter. Pointer refused the proffered arrangement with a home for
nerve cases, and shambled into a taxi again, but this time with
Keane's address safely in his letter-case.</p>

<p>Back at Doctor Scott's, Pointer changed, and, well content,
drove down to Medchester.</p>

<p>At Red Gates he found Mr. Thornton, looking very weary of his
work, and of his cottage, and of his life in general, walking up
and down his balcony, an unlit pipe between his teeth.</p>

<p>Pointer thought of his own words about Colonel Scarlett's face
after reading the letter brought him at lunch on the day before
Rose was killed.</p>

<p>Thornton had said that his host had looked like a man who had
learnt that something on which he confidently counted had gone all
wrong. That description fitted Thornton's own face and manner
exactly, as he stopped and nodded to the detective-officer.</p>

<p>"To-morrow morning at eleven, sir, would you kindly manage to
make time to come to my rooms at New Scotland Yard? I want to get
the people chiefly associated with Stillwater House assembled in a
sort of meeting."</p>

<p>"Royal command? Or are startling developments expected?"
Thornton asked caustically.</p>

<p>"At eleven, then, sir." Pointer spoke as though the other had
accepted with alacrity. "Unfortunately, I can't get the women's
finger-prints. Mrs. Lane's, for instance. I suppose, by the way,"
Pointer threw in, "that you never met her before she went to
Stillwater House?"</p>

<p>"Never!" Thornton said the word before the other had finished
his question. Yet Pointer knew from a short note that Watts had
found among the colonel's papers at his club that Mrs. Lane had met
Thornton before. It was a vague letter as far as dates or facts
were concerned, but that was clear enough in it.</p>

<p>Next morning saw Colonel Scarlett, Thornton, Bellairs, Bond, and
Cockburn all wedged into the inner of Pointer's three official
rooms, which was all but filled by a large table.</p>

<p>Bellairs was a small, handsome man, with a face that Pointer
would not have cared to trust.</p>

<p>"Close fit," Bond commented, insinuating himself lithely into
the back row.</p>

<p>"By jove, it's a breakfast party." Cockburn bent over the centre
of the table, where empty soup plates were ranged in a square.
"Place-cards and all."</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen," Pointer explained, "we have discovered in the
sand-pit close to where Miss Charteris's body was found, the marks
of a man's doubled-up fists. Such a mark as he might make if he
tried to raise himself up on them&mdash;this sort of way." Pointer
clenched his hands, and, leaning heavily on the table before him,
raised himself out of the chair. As he had made the marks himself
in the sand that morning, he knew what he wanted. "All rings must
be taken off, because there is a curious mark on one&mdash;the back
of the fingers in our cast where it joins the hand. As there's no
room on the table, and there's mercury in the mixture, I think the
rings had better go on that shelf behind there."</p>

<p>Watts was not a well-trained waiter, and there was some little
confusion and clatter before each man had two soup plates with a
thick white mixture set before him, which he had thrust his fist
vigorously. Then a basin of water, soap, and piles of towels were
brought in, and after a wash, rings were resumed, chairs pushed
away, and the meeting was over.</p>

<p>"Are we innocent or guilty?" asked Thornton, getting up.</p>

<p>"Can't tell yet for certain, sir, but I don't see any signs of
that little mark I spoke of in any of the plates." Pointer
inspected them.</p>

<p>"D'ye mean to say you've got a list of suspects, and once you've
scratched us off, you bag the remainder?" asked Bond curiously.</p>

<p>Pointer only made some non-committal answer.</p>

<p>"What about the count?" asked Bellairs.</p>

<p>"I expect to get his impressions myself in Italy," Pointer
explained. "I hope to have an interview with him as soon as may
be."</p>

<p>He looked at "Bond and Co.," who had forwarded him a most useful
cipher cable.</p>

<p>Next morning the Chief Inspector was on his way to Paris and
Genoa. Full instructions had been left with the superintendent and
Rodman for every eventuality, but Pointer expected nothing
startling or showy&mdash;until his return.</p>

<p>Genoa shows only its ugly back to the station, and keeps its
beautiful face for the sea, its age-old friend. Pointer wasted no
time in looking about him. He made his way to an Italian hotel in
the heart of the climbing town. After a wash and brush up, he went
at once to the <i>Sotutto</i>.</p>

<p>There are many inquiry agencies in Italy, many of them reputable
concerns. At the head of all for efficiency and reliability stands
the one he had chosen.</p>

<p>Pointer's investigations were backward-reaching. He laid a
portrait of Professor Charteris, and one of di Monti, and the
portraits of all the people concerned in, the Stillwater case, as
far as he knew them, before the manager, a pleasant, clever-faced
Genoese.</p>

<p>"This," Pointer pencilled a mark on the back of the professor's
picture, "is the man I chiefly want to learn about. Then I want to
know if this man&mdash;di Monti&mdash;or any of the other men have
been seen in your town. I am prepared to pay handsomely for the
information. I should think the inquiry might start about three
weeks to a fortnight ago. But that is only guesswork."</p>

<p>The manager made his notes.</p>

<p>"How long can you give us?"</p>

<p>"I need the information as soon as possible. This is a big case.
Put extra men on the job. I want to be away to-night if
possible."</p>

<p>It was possible. It is amazing what discreet track is kept on
all foreigners in Italy.</p>

<p>When he called again in answer to a telephone message, he learnt
this:</p>

<p>Professor Charteris had come to the Hotel Miramare on a Friday,
just a week before Rose was found murdered, in company with a very
tall, dark, listless-looking man, whom the hall-porter had never
seen before, or since. He would judge him to be about thirty. They
had breakfasted together in the professor's private sitting-room,
and a good deal of low-voiced conversation had gone on between
them. Coming down together afterwards, the lift had stuck fast
owing to a short circuit, and they had been delayed between floors
for nearly a quarter of an hour. The lift boy had had another
passenger beside the professor and the professor's companion. That
was a visitor, who, like Charteris, was well known to the hotel. He
had greeted the professor as an old friend, and the professor,
after a pause, as the lift absolutely refused to budge, had
hurriedly, and almost under his breath, introduced his companion as
Mr. Sayce.</p>

<p>He had added that "Mr. Sayce is interested in my scheme for
emeralds, so kindly forget that you've seen either of us here. Some
very delicate negotiations are going on."</p>

<p>The lift-boy had particularly remembered the little scene,
partly, because he thought that the three men were the last types
which he would have connected with business or trade of any sort,
and being an American, he had an eye for that well-known species of
his fellow man, and partly because of the feeling that neither the
professor nor, least of all, the man called Sayce were at all keen
on meeting the man who had spoken to Charteris. When the latter got
into the lift at the floor below the professor's, the young man had
turned his back on him, until the delay had forced the three into a
sort of temporary intimacy. When deposited at last on the ground
floor, the younger man had had a cab called, and had driven off
alone to the station. He had no luggage with him.</p>

<p>"The man who spoke to Professor Charteris in the lift, you have
his name?"</p>

<p>The detective had, and his home address. He was a Professor
Witherspoon, a Cambridge light, and was staying at the Villa Sole,
Obermais, Meranoo.</p>

<p>Pointer put in some hours of strenuous work, at Genoa, tracing,
tracking, comparing. Then he got the hall-porter to put him through
to Professor Witherspoon.</p>

<p>He heard a thin, cheerful, kindly voice.</p>

<p>"Professor Witherspoon speaking. Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Sayce. You met me in the stuck lift of the Miramare a fortnight
ago. I don't know if you remember&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perfectly. Is the Professor with you?"</p>

<p>"No, it's about him I'm 'phoning. Have you heard from him since
he left here, the day after we met? I've returned for an
appointment, and can't learn where he is."</p>

<p>"How trying. He spoke of Verona, didn't he?"</p>

<p>"He did. But he hadn't turned up to fetch, or send for his
<i>fermo posta</i> letters there. You haven't happened to hear of,
or from him, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He telephoned me the next Monday from Bolzano, the branch
station for Meranoo, you know, that he might just possibly drop in
for a chat on Wednesday afternoon. He thought of walking over by
way of the Mendel Pass. But he didn't come. He was very vague about
the trip. Making it dependent on the weather, and how fit he might
be feeling."</p>

<p>"Monday, April twenty-eighth?"</p>

<p>"That was the date."</p>

<p>"You haven't heard from him since?"</p>

<p>"Not a word. The weather's been very cold, even here. But wasn't
he going to stay with an Italian family? I seem to remember an old
Veronese name."</p>

<p>"Di Monti? I might try there. You can't suggest any other likely
spot for a cast? The matter's most urgent, or I wouldn't have rung
you up."</p>

<p>"I'm only sorry not to be of any help. No. I don't remember
hearing our friend mention any other place. We chiefly talked of
the wonderful Buru Bhudor finds, you may remember. But I think even
the indefatigable Charteris would hardly have gone there."</p>

<p>Pointer had no idea where or what the "wonderful finds" might
be.</p>

<p>"You could hardly call them in Italy, could you?" he fished
cautiously.</p>

<p>"Hardly," came the smiling reply, "no, hardly."</p>

<p>Pointer dared probe no further, and the whereabouts of the
afore-mentioned ruins remained for months a mystery to him.</p>

<p>The next move, then, was clearly Verona. Verona&mdash;the mere
name was poetry&mdash;was Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Incidentally it was also the home of the di Monti. Which was
more like duty.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER EIGHT</h2>

<p class="first">AT Verona, that swarming little ant-heap, Pointer
was wakened by the hotel porter early next morning.</p>

<p>A message had come from Count di Monti, to whom Pointer had
telegraphed on leaving Genoa. The count, the head of the family,
was not at his palazzo in the town, but out at Castello Grigio,
near Rovereto.</p>

<p>Would the signore take the trouble to go on to the latter
station, by train? It was on the direct line over the Brenner Pass
into Austria, and but an hour and a half further up. The count much
regretted that he was not in Verona, but he would send his car to
meet the ten o'clock morning train on the chance.</p>

<p>Pointer told the man to say that he would come on as suggested.
Then he himself telephoned to the Palazzo di Monti. The major-domo
replied that the count was away at Verona at his Rovereto property,
Castello Grigio.</p>

<p>At the station before Rovereto a young man in a chauffeur's
livery looked into Pointer's compartment. Was the signore going to
the Castello Grigio? Pointer said that he was. The chauffeur smiled
and touched his cap. He had been sent by the count to execute a
commission for him in a neighbouring village, and was to have the
honour of driving the gentleman to the Castello. Saluting, he
closed the door, and waited outside in the corridor till they
reached Rovereto, lying like a handful of dice rolled, on to a
green cloth, where he piloted Pointer through the turnstile to a
fine Lancia car outside.</p>

<p>It was a pretty country, and soon a turn took them into a
charming valley. The Castello Grigio was about an hour from
Rovereto by car, Pointer had been told at the Verona hotel. At the
end of that time they drew up at a huge pile. Pointer doubted
whether it would be "passed" as fit for a human habitation by any
council in England, but some of the grim windows, set in walls
fourteen feet thick, had lace curtains to them.</p>

<p>The portico, which looked as though intended for a "Big Bertha"
emplacement, was gay with geraniums, among which an awning umbrella
gave a note of homeliness.</p>

<p>These things Pointer noticed, as also the fact that the man
himself opened the door, and with a "<i>Di qua, signore, la
prego</i>," ushered him into a large, airy room.</p>

<p>One side was taken up by lace-curtained windows. Three large
windows. So the curtains&mdash;they were new ones he saw
now&mdash;were only in this one room. Humph. But Pointer was
handicapped by not knowing Italian family-customs. All this might
be customary. And again, it might not.</p>

<p>The man returned.</p>

<p>"The Signor Conti offers a thousand excuses, but he will be here
in a very few minutes. He hopes the signore will take lunch with
him." The man had the manners of a well-trained servant. Pointer
looked about him.</p>

<p>The room was very sparsely furnished. But the things were
beautiful. A scratch on the arm of his chair caught his eye. It was
very recent, and showed rough handling. The carpet, too, was large
for the room, and lay a little up on the walls. Pointer turned a
corner back. The floor beneath had not been swept for generations,
judging by the depth of the dust; but then, again, that might be
usual in Italian country houses, where there was no mistress.</p>

<p>The door opened. Cangrande di Monti stepped in. He held up his
hand with a charming smile.</p>

<p>"A truce until after lunch, my dear Chief Inspector. When you
have had a talk with my father I shall be quite at your
disposition. I think you will feel differently about me before long
than you do now. A moment!"</p>

<p>He helped the man carry in a long narrow table of the kind
familiar in old paintings. A beautiful lace runner lay on its
polished top. It was set with old silver, and crystal thin as
bubbles.</p>

<p>"Sorry to crowd you&mdash;<i>permesso</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pointer stepped back hastily as the table was borne towards him
He stepped back into a yawning hole, and fell with a crash that
knocked the wind out of him.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear!" On the second di Monti's mocking face grinned down
at him some twelve feet away.</p>

<p>"You've not hurt yourself, I hope?" An automatic glittered in
his hand "Please don't move while Giuseppe searches you."</p>

<p>After the grating of bolts, a door in the little cellar opened.
Pointer lay quite still. Giuseppe found his revolver, and then
looked up.</p>

<p>"That is all. He has no knife but this penknife."</p>

<p>"Take it, too. Leave his cigars. Search him carefully for
another weapon." When the cellar door was bolted again, di Monti
went on, "You thought yourself, doubtless, very clever, Mr. Spy,
when you followed me here. When you telephoned about my father last
night, I told Bonvecchio what to say, and Giuseppe and I made ready
for you. A little quick the work, perhaps, but it sufficed. We even
set out some flower pots. Giuseppe did most of the cutting of that
hole in the carpet. He does so dislike the police. A trait I
understand. And now for a companion. I should be sorry if you were
to get bored in the long, very long, hours ahead of you. Fetch the
gaoler!" Di Monti turned to the man who had rejoined him. The
servant was away for some minutes, during which his master
apparently walked about the room, humming softly to himself.</p>

<p>"I thought that you might inquire if my father were really at
the Castello Grigio. He is, but, you see, this does not happen to
be that castello. Ah, here is the companion I promised you."</p>

<p>Pointer heard the clink-clank of a chain, and then there looked
down at him a wolfish dog, with bristling hair and bared teeth.</p>

<p>"If you say one word, I shall drop him down there and set him on
you." Di Monti looked as though he were half-minded to do it
anyway. "A Maremma sheep dog has never a sweet disposition, and
this one is peculiarly unamiable. He was to be shot. But when a
little bird told me that you were coming after me, I saved him
up&mdash;for you. He is not only large, but so agile! And now I
must take my leave. I regret that this being, as I said, not
Castello Grigio, but the Castello Vecchio, an out-of-the-way ruin,
it will be a bit lonely, and also a bit hungry &mdash;but there is
always Carlo."</p>

<p>A more ferocious expression than that on di Monti's face Pointer
had never seen, unless it were the dog's.</p>

<p>"You are wondering how long I intend to keep you locked up
here?" di Monti went on tauntingly. "Pray nod, if I am right."</p>

<p>Pointer did not oblige him, but di Monti thrust out his jowl and
answered his own remark.</p>

<p>"It entirely depends on how long you&mdash;last. This is an
interesting castle. You came to explore it, you fell into one of
those old chambers, the one that held the lady I talked of at
Stillwater House not so long ago. But I forget, that was before you
came on the scene. When Giuseppe comes, in a month or so, he will
at once notify the carabinieri Take up the carpet carefully,
Giuseppe, I will help you carry it up to the attic again Say '<i>a
riverderla</i>' to the signore, though I am afraid," di Monti
turned his savage face to Pointer with a horrid smile, "I am afraid
you will not see him, when next he has the felicity to see you, or
what Carlo leaves of you."</p>

<p>Pointer heard the two men struggle with the carpet, then the
door of the upper room closed. After some time the great outer
entrance clanged shut, and the car hummed away down the grass-grown
drive.</p>

<p>Pointer looked at the door of his cellar. It was very old, but
stout enough to last out his time if he had no weapons but his
hands. Leisurely he extracted his cigar case. A thick, podgy case,
looking none too well made. He touched a spot with his thumb, and
lifted out a shallow tray which held the unusually flat cigars he
apparently favoured. Inside was a flat glass bottle, a file not
much longer than a nail-file, but of the stoutest steel, a skeleton
key, and a few other interesting and equally useful oddments.
Similar articles were in his left sole, but the cigar-case was
simpler. The top of his umbrella or stick held other emergency
aids. The very cholera belt he wore was a roll of silk rope in a
neat holder. His waistcoat buttons were not what they seemed.
Pointer was always prepared. He had to be.</p>

<p>One of the cigars held a neat little saw, another a gimlet,
still another was a handle. He made a hole in the door and pulled
back the bolt with a steep loop made for the purpose. Then he began
on the upper fastening. There were four in all, and had been oiled
to permit of his own imprisonment. It was a tedious but very simple
matter to free himself and step on out into the garden. Luckily the
dog had been thoughtfully fastened into the room overhead, for he
had taken a violent dislike to the Chief Inspector at first sight.
Pointer climbed the handsome wrought-iron gates with a feeling that
it was almost unsportsmanlike to escape so easily from what had
cost so much thought and trouble to get him into.</p>

<p>Following the direction of the road which most of the
horse-shoes faced, he soon came to a hamlet of sorts. Here he got a
mount to carry him on. A little later he found a larger town with a
garage, and after that all was simplicity itself.</p>

<p>In quite a comfortable car he drove back to Verona, where Bond
and Cockburn's private information had told him that a large
Fascist meeting was to be held this week. The streets were even
more crowded than yesterday, and everywhere were little squads of
the Camicie Nere, the Blackshirts, their top-locks crested like so
many dark-feathered cockatoos.</p>

<p>The Italian soldier walks his newly-acquired, or "redeemed,"
land as simply as Tommy Atkins, and with as little swagger. But the
Fascisti are out to make an impression. They were in cheerful mood,
calling across to each other little staccato cries of their own. A
crowd of Fascist boy-scouts clattered along, the spindly little
boys of Italy, but eager as so many terriers. Flags were floating
from the houses, the gay green, white and red flashing open and
shut as the wind tossed them. Even the old Arena looked alive
to-day.</p>

<p>Pointer stopped at a wandering ice-cream vender. "What is
up?"</p>

<p>The man laughed. "The Fash' are giving a dinner tonight to the
leader of the new Majubaland exploration party. The name has just
been published."</p>

<p>He held out a newspaper. A "soot and whitewash" travesty of
Cangrande di Monti stared truculently out from the front page of
the <i>Liberta</i>.</p>

<p>Pointer bought the paper, and stopped in a caf to look at it.
He laughed as he skimmed through the article below the portrait,
for of all the noble natures which Italy has yet produced, di Monti
seemed to be the very flower. The dinner in honour of this paragon
was to take place at eight, in the old Palazzo del Consiglio, the
Fascist headquarters. It was not far off five now.</p>

<p>Reading on Pointer saw that Cangrande's name as leader of the
expedition had only been telegraphed from Rome at two-thirty.</p>

<p>No wonder that di Monti had been in a hurry at the Castello. One
word from the Scotland Yard man, and his dream might have been
dispelled for ever.</p>

<p>Pointer decided to see him at once.</p>

<p>The number of flags outside the beautiful old Consiglio Palazzo
made him step in and inquire.</p>

<p>"Yes," some one in a black shirt assured him with pride, "Count
Cangrande's here, holding a special meeting at the Veronese
Fascisti. No one could intrude."</p>

<p>"It is no intrusion. I am from London. Come over expressly in
connection with the recent stay of Count Cangrande there."</p>

<p>"Oh, in that case&mdash;" and bowing like a half-shut
clasp-knife the man motioned him towards an attendant.</p>

<p>"His illustrious name?" asked the servant, hand on latch.</p>

<p>"I will announce myself," Pointer said loftily, and opened a
door farther down.</p>

<p>The large room into which he stepped was crowded. He had come in
just behind a long table, covered with a flag, at which sat three
officers. Cangrande was the one on the right.</p>

<p>Pointer had not seen him in uniform before. His high black
boots, his soft gray-green breeches and coat, Sam Browne belt,
black shirt, showing its line at neck and wrists, and, when he
turned a double row of ribbons on his breast, on one of which
glittered three hard-won tiny silver stars, and the high black cap
of the Fascisti, a cross between a Cossack and a Belgian cap was
not becoming in itself, but its note of sombre harshness suited di
Monti.</p>

<p>No one noticed the entry of the only figure not wearing at least
a black stock, for the Fascist cry of <i>Eia-eia-Alala</i> was
thundering up, each man rising and swinging out his right hand and
arm in the greeting of the Roman Legions. Then the song of the
Unknown Soldier, <i>la Canzone del Mute Ignoto</i>, rolled through
the room, and Pointer looked about him. Every face was alight. Some
were marked by little else but egotism, ruthlessness, or
intolerance. But taken as a whole, a finer looking lot of young men
he had never seen, nor was likely to see. They were not here to
serve self-interest. In this world where money rules, they bent the
knee to something higher. It was as though there swept through that
crowded room a spirit from the realm of idealism and passionate
selflessness. Pointer could almost hear the beating of its wings.
He saw again the Thousand Heroes of Garibaldi rallying to the call.
For Pointer knew the Italy of immediately after the Great War. The
Chief Inspector had spoken with those who had seen men flung
shrieking into their own blast furnaces at Turin amid Communist
cheers. He had been present in Bologna when a partially disabled
officer had had his uniform cut off him with knives that streaked
the rags with his blood.</p>

<p>One of the men beside di Monti stepped forward.</p>

<p>In this meeting which was Italian, and not party&mdash;according
to him&mdash;he said that he wished to mention some of the war
services of the man to whom was to be entrusted the important
charge of governing the newly-acquired <i>Oltrajuba</i>.</p>

<p>He ran over di Monti's war record. It was a fine one.</p>

<p>Twice after Caporetto the count had collected a mere handful of
wounded men, and, calling over his shoulder the historic cry of the
Great Liberator, "Here, Italians, we die!" had made a desperate
stand against incredible odds at some bend in the road, some slope
of the track, some point, whose selection was as much a credit to
his brains as to his pluck.</p>

<p>Di Monti listened with eyes on his hands, which were clasped
lightly on the hilt of his sword. About his mouth was a suggestion
of reverie. Once only he looked up. Across to a little hunchback
standing in the back row line of starred ribbons across his narrow
chest, neatly in a waiter's black. The man caught the glance. Up
and out shot a toil-worn hand in a salute at once friend and proud.
A comrade saluting a comrade.</p>

<p>Di Monti's harsh mouth softened for a second. Straight back to
crippled back he and this man had stood, never expecting to see
more of life than clubbed rifle butts whirling in the air, and
stabbing bayonets and Monti's own flashing, dripping, broken
sword.</p>

<p>Suddenly di Monti turned and caught sight of Pointer. The
Italian was singing, and he finished the line without a tremor of
his strident voice.</p>

<p>Then he stepped back.</p>

<p>"A word with you in private," Pointer said quickly.</p>

<p>"Impossible."</p>

<p>"Then in public."</p>

<p>"Impossible. If it comes to words&mdash;one from me and you
would be torn to pieces."</p>

<p>"Costly pieces, Count di Monti," Pointer said coldly. "I think
the price would ruin your party." Pointer jaw was well to the fore.
Di Monti stared at him and he stared back. The chairman turned
questioningly.</p>

<p>"This gentleman brings me a message of congratulation from
London, and some very urgent news," di Monti explained to him. "May
I be excused a moment?"</p>

<p>They slipped out of a side door. Some one filled in the gap with
a speech, some one else started <i>La Giovanezza</i>, the song of
youth, the song of the Fascisti, and then more speeches.</p>

<p>Finally di Monti came in again. He was very pale. As for
Pointer, he walked away from the hotel deep in thought. Di Monti
had sworn solemnly to him that he was innocent of the murder of
Rose Charteris, that he was caught in a web of circumstantial
evidence possibly, but that he was not guilty. His desperate attack
on Pointer's life made the assertion ring false, but the count
maintained that that had been simply a way of gaining time until
his own election should be ratified. He did not stoop to try to
pass it off as less than it was&mdash;an attempted brutal murder,
but he insisted that he had had an anonymous letter from England,
warning him that Pointer was going to have him detained at once,
pending an extradition order, which Scotland Yard had already
applied for. Pointer had stood awhile, looking at his
boot-tips.</p>

<p>"If I go straight to your <i>Duce</i> with the account of what
happened to me this morning, where will you be?"</p>

<p>Di Monti was very pale. He said nothing.</p>

<p>"If you will give me your word of honour&mdash;I will trust
it&mdash;to come to England any time within the next ten days, I
shall be silent on that point. If you do not give me your word, I
go to Signor Mussolini at once, and you will be arrested at once,"
Pointer went on.</p>

<p>Flight again for di Monti was out of the question. He would not
try to escape from his own country, his new position. Both men knew
as much.</p>

<p>"You mean that I am to come to England to be arrested for the
murder of Miss Charteris?" di Monti asked slowly.</p>

<p>"That's as may be. Even so, you would have a chance of proving
your innocence, a chance of an acquittal. You will have none if I
go to your chief with the story of what has just happened to me at
the Castello. I have witnesses who helped me to get out."</p>

<p>"I might have known that you wouldn't come alone!" di Monti said
bitterly. He walked up and down the room for some minutes. "I must
agree. I give you my word of honour as an officer and a gentleman
to come if you summon me within ten days."</p>

<p>"Not necessarily to be arrested." Pointer did not want a
suicide; and di Monti was capable of anything. "Possibly merely to
help the case."</p>

<p>Di Monti gave him a long look, and uncovered his teeth in an
incredulous smile, then, with a curt nod, he returned to the
council room, and Pointer walked on downstairs.</p>

<p>He dismissed the young Italian from his mind for the time being.
Pointer wanted to find the professor. Rose's father might hold the
key to the whole involved series of events which had taken place
that Thursday night at Stillwater. Di Monti said that he had not
been near his family. As he was quite willing for Pointer to check
that statement by a talk with his father, the Chief Inspector
accepted his word.</p>

<p>That registered letter that Rose had received had been sent from
Bolzano. To Bolzano, Pointer was therefore bound.</p>

<p>He telephoned to the old count. A telephone message obtained a
hearing often when a caller was kept waiting. He spoke of himself
over the wire as Gilchrist, Professor Charteris's family solicitor.
Had the professor made any arrangement to stay with Count di Monti?
A feeble voice told him that the professor had. He was to have come
to Verona to the Palazzo di Monti on May first, and spend the
week-end there. But he had telephoned from Genoa earlier, asking
whether his visit could be put forward a week, as otherwise he must
give it up. It had not been possible for the count to do this, much
as he regretted the fact. There the matter had rested. The voice of
the old man showed that he thought himself somewhat summarily
treated, for he had had no word from his once-invited guest of
explanation or apology.</p>

<p>Pointer caught the night train up to Bolzano. He had much to
think about as the train wound up beside the Adige.</p>

<p>The next morning he woke to true Bolzano weather, though the
year was unusually cold. May, as a rule, is hot in this wonderful
little spot of Europe where north and south meet, where the grape
ripens under the pine trees, where the same valley can show glacier
and coral formations. Pointer liked Bolzano. Though he thought its
old name of Bozen suited it better. There is something angular and
wooden about the Tirol word that goes with the gables, and turrets,
and arched passages of the busy town, where the swifts swoop like
hounds on the scent down the main streets, dodging under the elbows
of passers-by, and chasing each other like children at tag through
the arcades.</p>

<p>The professor stopped at the Hotel Laurin.</p>

<p>Pointer knew by inquiries made already from England that he had
arrived on the Sunday before Rose's death, alone, and had left,
alone, the next day. His only luggage had been a suit-case, which
he had sent to the station early on Monday morning, saying that it
was to be forwarded to Meranoo.</p>

<p>Pointer found that it had been duly forwarded and fetched from
the latter station. Either the professor, or some one else, had
handed in the <i>scontrino</i> and been given the bag. But who had
produced that voucher?</p>

<p>Pointer's first walk was to the Bolzano post-office, where he
verified the registered letter sent off on the Monday before Rose's
death, some twelve days ago now.</p>

<p>He was shown the duplicate slip, which stated:</p>

<p><i>Assegno L.</i>&mdash;Charteris. Hotel Laurin.</p>

<p><i>Destnario</i>&mdash;Charteris. Medchester.</p>

<p>The hour, Pointer learnt, must have been before noon, as at that
time the clerks had been changed, and the one in whose writing the
slip was made out had gone off duty for the day.</p>

<p>At the hotel he learnt that the professor had shown no
preference either for people or for solitude. Some of his meals he
had taken in the dining room, some in his own bedroom. Apparently
he had acted like any ordinary traveller.</p>

<p>Pointer began to be more certain than ever that the murderer had
made a mistake, that he had expected that registered letter's
enclosure to contain&mdash;what?</p>

<p>What was it, what could it have been, that might have been
enclosed instead of that memo, that might have been wanted by some
one who thought that some important piece of news might have been
sent to the daughter by the father, news so important that at all
costs to the receiver, at all risks to the criminal, it must be
prevented from being passed on?</p>

<p>Where was the professor? What had happened to him between
Bolzano and his promised visit to Meranoo?</p>

<p>A railway line runs between the two towns, but Charteris had
expressly spoken of walking over the Mendel. Where could his walk
have led him that no word of his only child's murder seemed to be
able to reach him? The Mendel Pass is not out of the world. It is a
favourite summer resort, with most up-to-date hotels, where every
well-known English newspaper would be taken.</p>

<p>Pointer went for a walk along the old dyke, planted with trees
and shrubs, broad as the king's highway, that keeps the river in
bounds.</p>

<p>He loved nature as only the man can who spends his life in
towns. And that walk is unique. With the chanting Talfer rushing
past, clear as crystal, with vineyards stretching on either hand,
with feudal castles and gleaming farmhouses, and tiny white
churches like, candles dotted here and there, on the slopes of the
green hills of Tirol that rise on every side, while far away, as
though looked at through gauze, towers the great Rosengarten range,
set like a throne of the high gods against the sky.</p>

<p>Just now it was still hung with veils of white over its own
changing purple and grays. At sunset it might show itself for a
brief moment of incredible beauty, a garden of red roses blowing,
tossing, blooming, only changed by the spell of King Laurin to
stone, as runs the Ladine legend.</p>

<p>Pointer stood drawing in deep breaths of the dry, pure air,
hanging fresh pictures in the gallery for which he cared most, his
memory gallery.</p>

<p>An impression of being stared at made him turn. A little man had
come up behind him, and was standing examining him attentively,
from his English hat to his English boots. Pointer had an odd
feeling as he looked back at him. The man was unlike any other whom
the Chief Inspector had ever seen, and Pointer felt that the
difference was racial, not individual. He had never met a specimen
of the primitive man before who still exists here and there in
Europe, and he was surprised at strong sensation, half repulsion,
half interest, which he felt.</p>

<p>The man was about five feet in height, very sturdily built, and
conveying a sense of&mdash;not bad proportions but different
proportions to what we call the normal. He was thickset, with next
to no neck, and with odd, haunch-like hips. On his
well-shaped&mdash;but still differently-shaped head, the hair grew
straight, and coarse, and thick, like cocoanut fibre mat, to below
the line of his low collar. He was clean-shaven, with a fawn-like
face, and small eyes, brown and soft, and shifting quickly. On
meeting Pointer's stare, he turned and walked away.</p>

<p>A gardener was sweeping the walk.</p>

<p>"Do you know who that little man is?"</p>

<p>"That's Ladiner Toni. A guide from the <i>Paesi Ladini</i>."</p>

<p>"A good guide?"</p>

<p>"Very good. But now, of course, with the snow so late, there's
little climbing to be done. He's been in Bozen a lot lately, but as
a rule, other springs, one never saw him."</p>

<p>Sauntering down in the town proper, Pointer again noticed the
little man, and also that he was deliberately following him.</p>

<p>The Englishman stopped in at one of the multitudinous wine rooms
that are growing less of a curse to the drink-loving inhabitants
under Fascist government. As he drank his glass of rough Tirol
wine, a face peered around at him for a second, eyed him wistfully,
and melted away. The eyes seemed to want to ask a question, and yet
not dare.</p>

<p>The waitress knew him at once on Pointer's speaking to her.</p>

<p>"As a rule, he's up and away in his mountains. They're wild
birds, the Ladini. But lately, two or three tourists have told me
that he followed them about. I'm afraid poor Toni has found the
year a bad one."</p>

<p>"Can you send for him? I should like to speak to him."</p>

<p>But Toni had melted away.</p>

<p>Back at the hotel Pointer could not learn whether Charteris had
engaged any guide in the town or not. Bozen is a walking, not a
mountaineering centre. He got the address of Ladiner Toni and his
character from the Carabinieri. He lived in Saint Christina, a tiny
village in the Val Gardena.</p>

<p>The detective officer took the motor diligence to its mouth, and
set out for Toni's house. His father had been the schoolmaster. The
driver knew Toni well. He, too, agreed that he had changed of late.
He was in and out of Bolzano all day long, hanging around the
station, or the post-office chiefly, though he would as like as not
spend hours on the promenades or in the big square. He seemed to be
always on the lookout for some one, the driver thought. Perhaps
some one who had not paid him up.</p>

<p>Pointer was in the little village before he knew it, so dark
were the tiny wooden houses that they melted into the earth around
them. That of the teacher's widow was like a toy gingerbread
cottage.</p>

<p>An old woman, sitting by her spinning-wheel, looked up. She,
too, was short and squat, but her brown eyes were very bright.</p>

<p>"Come in. You are looking for my son?" She spoke Italian or
German with equal effort. "He will be in soon."</p>

<p>Pointer took a stool and watched her, nimble brown fingers.</p>

<p>"You want a guide, perhaps, <i>Signo</i>?"</p>

<p>All through their talk of the weather she eyed him closely.</p>

<p>The door, opened, and the little man entered. At sight of him,
Pointer knew that he had not had his tramp for nothing. A curious
pallor came into the man's swart face. His eyes flickered backwards
and forwards from Pointer to his mother.</p>

<p>"This gentleman wants to see you, Toni."</p>

<p>"Well?" he asked in German, in a throaty, husky voice. "I hear
you're a good guide among the Dolomites, and I want one."</p>

<p>"There's no climbing when the snows are melting." A watchful,
suspicious intentness was in the little man's face. He was
breathing rapidly. The wheel had stopped, and the old woman, too,
was staring at their guest.</p>

<p>"I want you to show me some of the valleys around here. The
carabinieri said you were trustworthy, and that what you don't know
of the Dolomites towards Cadore isn't worth knowing. I will leave
the pay to you, but I want a Ladiner."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I want to hear your legends as we walk."</p>

<p>The wheel turned again. A sudden flurry of spring snow was flung
against the window. Pointer had first heard of the Ladine folk lore
from the driver that morning. He had spoken of Toni's mother as a
repository of those legends, beautiful and haunting.</p>

<p>"Toni, put on more wood, and I will tell you how the snow first
came to us mortals."</p>

<p>It was like rolling back the world to King Alfred's days,
Pointer thought, as the old woman span and told him wild poetry of
moon princesses and gnomes and trolls.</p>

<p>He looked at Toni, who was carving a pipe, and thought of
gnomes. But the man's face was honest. He was a good guide, the
Carabinieri had said. Pointer would not admit that his work made
him need it more than other men, but for a fortnight of every year
the Chief Inspector went to Switzerland, and spent his days high
up, climbing among ice and the snows that never melt.</p>

<p>Living in a white world, and yet a world all colour, sea-green
crevices, sky-blue hollows, long, lilac shadows, and at dawn and
sunset every tint of the rainbow to walk on. To be a good guide
was, in his eyes, the highest rating that a man could have.</p>

<p>To refill his pipe, Pointer had to hunt for his tobacco pouch.
He laid some of the contents of his pockets on the table as he did
so. Prominent among them, face up, was the photograph of Professor
Charteris.</p>

<p>There was a hissing intake of breath from Toni. The wheel
stopped its purr. In the little mirror in the palm of his hand
Pointer saw the woman's face. She was staring at her son in piteous
uncertainty. Pointer glanced casually at Toni, who lifted a pair of
frightened, irresolute eyes. The Englishman continued to speak of
the storm as he replaced the objects.</p>

<p>"Can you put me up overnight? I only need an armchair."</p>

<p>He preferred it to any bed the house could have given him,
though Toni offered his own pallet.</p>

<p>Pointer settled himself for the night after a supper which made
him turn pale for days to think on. He was well wrapped up, and
with his legs on a second chair, did very well. Late in the night
he heard some one come down the ladder and tiptoe into the room. It
could only be Toni, for his mother was next door. From beneath his
lashes, Pointer saw him in the moonlight creeping forward, his face
distorted with timidity and anxiety. There was nothing in his
hands. Pointer guessed what he was after. With the sigh of a
sleeping man, he turned in his chair, so that his coat fell
open&mdash;the photograph pocket in sight.</p>

<p>Toni crept closer. Tiny fingers, which again gave Pointer an odd
thrill of physical repulsion which his mind did not share, touched
him The photo was pulled out with a difficulty that to the
detective was a certificate of the little fellow's previous
honesty. Then Toni tiptoed to his mother's room. The door creaked
slowly open and then shut. Followed a long whispered dialogue,
during which Pointer took a nap. Ladine was not one of his
accomplishments.</p>

<p>Back crept Toni. Half-way back went the photograph, then Pointer
awoke and caught his wrist.</p>

<p>"A thief!"</p>

<p>"Oh, God!" Toni cried in fright. The door opened. His mother
stood on the threshold holding a lamp high above her head with
trembling hands. In the heavy folds of her nightdress and cap tied
under her chin, she looked like a little white statue of fear.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" Pointer asked as sternly as possible, for
he felt as though he were terrifying two children, "I shall have to
hand you over to the Carabinieri."</p>

<p>"I will explain." The mother came quite close. "No, Toni, let
your mother explain. Only the truth is ever right. We must take the
consequences. My son was having another look at a photograph you
laid on the table this evening. It is of a relative? A friend?"</p>

<p>"One does not carry the pictures of strangers about with one.
What do you know of the man?"</p>

<p>Again that agonised look exchanged between mother and son.</p>

<p>"Let go of my Toni, who did no harm except to listen to his
mother's foolish, oh, foolish words! Now, we will all sit down, and
I will tell you the dreadful truth."</p>

<p>"Mother, you will catch cold. Let me wrap a blanket around you."
Toni rolled her up like a mummy, with only the wise little face
showing.</p>

<p>"That man in the photograph came here just two weeks ago. On a
Monday. The snows were hard and firm on the mountains then, and he
had been here before. He had climbed with Toni the two last years
in succession for a couple of days. Well, he came here in the
afternoon, walking as you did from where the diligence put him
down. He intended to stop the night and set off at four next
morning, for the <i>Val de la Saljeres</i>, as we call it. A place
which we here of <i>Dla-ite</i> avoid. The stones of an old
watercourse are there. We Ladines know the truth of it, but you of
the other people tell a different tale. This man&mdash;a sort of
school-master like my blessed Antoni, he said he was&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused inquiringly. Pointer nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, he wished to go there, and then go on later over to
Meranoo by the Mendel. My son was willing. He liked the man. You
did like him, didn't you, Toni?" She quavered, tears in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"I did. He understood. He never laughed at the things we
know."</p>

<p>"They set off in the morning about four, he and Toni, and by
nine they should have been up in the Saijeres valley. But before
twelve my Toni came running back. Happy Heaven! How he was
running!" She undid a hand to wipe her eyes, but the tears were
coming too fast now for her to speak. Toni patted the roll about
where her shoulder would be.</p>

<p>"Tell no more, mother. I will show him everything to-morrow. I
cannot explain in words as you can, but I will show him
everything."</p>

<p>"Everything?" Again the two pairs of eyes clung</p>

<p>Toni swallowed and nodded. He was trembling violently. Pointer,
with his purely physical dislike of him, thought again that it was
not as a man trembles, but as an animal shivers.</p>

<p>"You will be ready in the morning at four? It will be wet, but
the Val Saijeres lies low. It is only an uphill walk." Toni spoke
quite resolutely.</p>

<p>"Good. I'll be ready. Now suppose we make your mother some tea
or coffee."</p>

<p>But Toni poured into a saucepan some rough red wine mixed with
water, dropped in a tablespoon of the black-brown honey of Tirol
and some cloves, and stirred it all with a stick of cinnamon to a
foamy froth This he poured into three cups. Pointer had tasted
worse.</p>

<p>The old woman put her cup down with a shaking hand.</p>

<p>"It is a beautiful house, this of my husband's, but here in the
valley there is only money. Happiness lies up on the hills." She
left them.</p>

<p>Toni got up. "No, I will not speak now," he mumbled. "I am not
good at talk like mother, but I will show you."</p>

<p>Pointer felt sure that he would be as good as his word, and fell
into a sound sleep.</p>

<p>The old lady was astir with them next morning, heating up some
of the buckwheat dumplings of their supper, and wrapping a couple
in cabbage leaves for them to carry.</p>

<p>Toni took up his ice-axe with a strange look at its pointed tip.
Then they set off by the swing of his lantern's light, and plodded
on and up into a wild and stony region. True Dolomits were these,
<i>Lis Montes Palyes</i>, Toni called them, and pallid and gray
they were. Between this savage world the Saljeres Valley wound up,
and up, with a prehistoric aqueduct at its upper end.</p>

<p>About eight, Toni, who had plodded along dumbly, stopped.</p>

<p>"We came here just like now, that man and I. Here he stopped to
light his pipe, and said he would rest. I, too, sat down. On this
rock here. My ice-axe I laid here. As I sat I heard a sound some
way off. But this valley has so many invisible people living in it
that I paid no heed. The mountain spirits do not harm me or any one
in my charge. From this place a shorter way runs to the place he
wanted to see, but we have had a very hard and late winter, and I
was not sure whether the snow would not be too deep for him. He was
not a young man. I asked him if I could climb up to that ridge
there and look. If the path was open, we should be at the end of
the gorge in a few minutes, but it would take me some twenty
minutes to reach the rock. He said he wanted a rest, as his
breathing showed. So I left my ice-axe where I had laid it beside
him, and climbed that ridge you see to a little platform beyond,
which you can't see. The track was deep in snow, as I thought. I
was looking at it when suddenly I was told that something was wrong
with the man. I ran back and I found him"&mdash;Toni began to
tremble, that animal shuddering that seemed to crinkle his very
skin&mdash;"I found him&mdash;around this bend. Here, on this new
place. He must have moved into the sun when I had gone. But I found
him&mdash;dead. Lying back with his head this way, and my ice-axe
here beside him. Its point was red, and his head was red. There was
a deep hole in it on top. He was quite dead. Some one had killed
him with my ice-axe while I was away, and some one had robbed him
of everything in his pockets, even to his handkerchief. I looked
because I did not know his name. He had come two years, but there
was no need of names. I rushed up that ridge there to see, but I
saw nothing I shouted, but though a man over there heard me, he was
a Croderes, and they never come. I was frightened&mdash;my man, my
axe, and everything stolen from him&mdash;I lifted him into a cave
I know of close to here. You see that stone?"</p>

<p>Pointer nodded with tense jaw.</p>

<p>"It rolls away. Behind it is a cave, dry and ice-cold. Ice-water
washes around it. I put him in there, and ran home and told mother.
She was as frightened as I, and it takes a lot to frighten
mother"&mdash;Pointer thought of the little white-faced wisp, and
smiled to himself&mdash;"and we decided to leave him there and say
nothing. He is there now, and that is why I waited every day in
Bolzano. I knew that some one would come looking for him. This is
the rock."</p>

<p>Pointer helped him to get the stone away. It could be levered
with the ice-axe quite easily. He stooped and entered an icy-cold
hole in the rock, where, on the dry tufa, lay the body of an
elderly man, frozen stiff. Pointer recognised it by the many
portraits he had seen as Professor Charteris. As Ladine Toni had
said, the pockets were empty. The head wound must have been made by
some such instrument as the axe's point. The Chief Inspector
crawled out again. Toni watched him like a half-timid,
half-trusting animal.</p>

<p>"No one saw this affair, I suppose? No one knows of it but your
mother and you?"</p>

<p>"A Croders lives up there," Toni pointed. "He is a
chamois-hunter. He might have seen something, but it would take a
lot of money to find out."</p>

<p>"Why so? Surely he would speak if appealed to."</p>

<p>Toni shook his head helplessly.</p>

<p>"You mean he was there when this man was killed?" Pointer asked
again.</p>

<p>Toni nodded several times.</p>

<p>"I saw him on his ledge when I looked for the short cut."</p>

<p>"Why won't he tell what he saw, supposing he saw the murder?"
persisted the detective officer.</p>

<p>Toni looked haggard.</p>

<p>"I and my mother have plenty to live on with our big garden, but
money&mdash;money enough for a Croders&mdash;" Again he shook his
head feebly.</p>

<p>"Can we get up to the hut of this Cro&mdash;" Pointer let the
word fade away in the approved fashion of a stranger speaking an
uncertain tongue.</p>

<p>Toni nodded after looking at the soles of Pointer's boots. They
were well nailed.</p>

<p>"What am I to do about&mdash;<i>him</i>?"</p>

<p>Pointer did not commit himself. "What is a Crodere?" he asked
instead.</p>

<p>Toni gave his little helpless wriggle.</p>

<p>"It is just a name we use. Some people say they belong to us,
Ladines. There are not many left. They only live among the rocks,
chiefly, towards Cadore."</p>

<p>"And are they so fond of money?"</p>

<p>"They are Croders."</p>

<p>"So I gathered. But <i>why</i> do they love money so?"</p>

<p>Toni looked at him in silence, but after awhile he began to talk
as they climbed the fairly easy goat path. Pointer pieced together
from his disjointed confidences' the account of a race of mountain
miners and hunters, who looked like ordinary men and women, and
lived like them, but who were really stone men. They could feel
nothing, neither love nor hate, anger nor joy, pain nor
pleasure.</p>

<p>They are always even-tempered, he went on, and never harm any
one on purpose, but a Croders would see a child roasted alive if
it happened to fall into the fire, though by merely putting out his
hand he could save it. They have no hearts, no feelings, but they
have clever brains, and they love money, though it can do nothing
for them. A Croders can feel neither heat nor cold.</p>

<p>Pointer again felt as though he were in a world unknown. Piffle,
of course, but such strange, eerie piffle.</p>

<p>Suddenly Toni stopped. A moment more and they stood on a wide,
smooth stone, evidently the entrance to a cave. A man stood inside
watching them. He was about Toni's height, but broader, with longer
arms. His hair was as thick, but curly. His eyes, however, were
different&mdash;of a curious ice-blue, the eyes of a Siamese cat.
Otherwise there was nothing odd about his tanned face. He looked
rather stupid, but quite good-natured&mdash;when his eyes were
downcast.</p>

<p>"The gentleman wants to talk to you, Seppi."</p>

<p>"I am inquiring about a friend of mine. He was up here in the
mountains a fortnight ago yesterday. Do you happen to remember an
accident of any kind on that day?"</p>

<p>The man looked at him placidly, turned, and went back into his
cave as though to fetch something.</p>

<p>"He won't come out again, not unless the sun shines," Toni
muttered.</p>

<p>"Is it permitted to enter?" Pointer asked in Italian.</p>

<p>"<i>Prego, prego</i>!" The man acquiesced civilly, going on with
his work of clipping the ears of some chamois masks which he was
mounting. The only chairs were boulders. A little fire flickered on
a huge rock that served the man as table. A pot of glue stood in
the centre; shears and taxidermist's knives lay on a slab beside
it.</p>

<p>"I will pay well for reliable information."</p>

<p>"What will you pay?" Seppi's voice was husky and very even.</p>

<p>Pointer laid ten two-lire pieces in front of him, and kept his
hand on them. Ice-blue eyes met gray eyes for a second.</p>

<p>"What age was your friend? What did he wear?"</p>

<p>Pointer told him.</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw him."</p>

<p>The man went on with his humming,</p>

<p><i>"Ste Ii a vardar,<br>
El Latemar."</i>
</p>

<p>Pointer pushed across two of the coins.</p>

<p>"He was sitting on a rock in the valley," the rock man said
briskly.</p>

<p>"Did you see anything else?" Another coin was shoved across, and
so it went on, Pointer feeding the man as though he were some sort
of talking automaton.</p>

<p>"I saw Toni go up to a ledge to see how the short cut was. I saw
him shade his eyes and peer at it. I saw the old man in the valley
move around a corner on to a rock in the sun. I saw another man
come along the valley, pick up the ice-axe, and come crouching half
around the corner. I saw Toni dislodge a stone. At its rattle the
second man slipped back again around the bend. I saw that he meant
to kill the old man." Seppi spoke as unconcernedly as though he had
been describing army manoeuvres.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you shout?"</p>

<p>"And scare away the chamois? I was glad to see that the man
intended to use an ice-axe and not a gun. He came on a second time
with the axe up, and crashed it down into the head of the old man
sitting with his back to him. The man fell off the boulder."</p>

<p>"Could you see what Toni was doing?"</p>

<p>"He had just reached the flat rock which would show him the
short cut."</p>

<p>"Couldn't he see the murder?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. There is that crag between. See for yourself.
The man raised the axe again, but evidently the other man was dead.
I saw him examine him with care, or rob him. I couldn't see clearly
which it was. Then he jumped up and ran behind the corner again,
and on out of sight around that bend you see from here. I saw him
no more."</p>

<p>"Could you describe him?"</p>

<p>The description was hopeless. Middle size, middle dark, rather
young, full beard, soft hat, oldish cape over his coat. It would
have fitted three-quarters of the men who had passed that way.</p>

<p>Pointer arranged with the man to pay him the amount of a day's
chamois hunting should he need him to report the murder to the
Carabinieri. The man agreed, asked for something on account, and,
as he stretched out his hand, passed it accidentally through the
flame. He held it there for a second, till Toni's exclamation made
him look at it. With perfect unconcern he picked off the black
flesh, and shoved the hand into his pocket.</p>

<p>"I must tie it up. It is a nuisance that I was not looking."</p>

<p>"Does it hurt?" Pointer asked, watching him closely. The man
laughed shortly.</p>

<p>"Nothing can hurt me. That's the danger. You can lose an arm
without noticing what's wrong, if you don't look out."</p>

<p>As he walked back to the cottage with Toni, Pointer was still
not sure if that apparently painless burn had been acting, or the
result of self-suggestion, or some sort of Yoga.</p>

<p>"Do nothing till you hear from me again," he told Toni.</p>

<p>"I want time to think things over. I may have to speak to the
Carabinieri about the matter, but I shall be able so to put it that
you are seen to be innocent, I think. Will you leave it to me?"</p>

<p>Toni shivered.</p>

<p>"The carabinieri&mdash;they are so quick! Always in such a hurry
to act!"</p>

<p>"I think I shall be able to make their <i>maresciallo</i>
understand, and it is the only way. The only way, Toni, believe
me."</p>

<p>For Pointer there never was but one way&mdash;the way of the
law.</p>

<p>Toni licked his dry lips.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you think so?"</p>

<p>"Courage!" Pointer laid a kindly hand on his shoulder. "You have
a good reputation. You are a good guide, and a good guide is not a
man to lightly suspect of murder. Then there is your cold-blooded
friend up there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But he saw no more than I knew. I told you the man was killed
by a blow from my ice-axe."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER NINE</h2>

<p class="first">POINTER had plenty to think about as he took the
motor coach back to Bolzano that afternoon. So the professor was
dead. He had half-feared as much these many days past, Charteris
had sent off that letter to his daughter on the Monday, and had
been killed the next day, while she was murdered the Thursday
following, the day of its arrival in England. The Professor had not
been attacked in the train before he got out at Bolzano, though the
first-class coaches are usually quite empty so early in the year.
It would have been an easy matter to knock him on the head and
fling him out, en route. Much less troublesome and dangerous than
to track him to that lonely valley.</p>

<p>Pointer believed that the guide's life had only been saved by
his having gone on to that upper point. For the murderer came
doubtless prepared with a revolver or gun to account for both, if
need be.</p>

<p>Why was the professor's life suddenly in danger, when it seemed
to have been safe up till then? Rose's murder, Pointer felt sure,
was connected with the letter she had received. Could he link up
her father's death with it? Not unless&mdash;unless something had
happened in Bolzano which he might have been supposed to describe,
or send on to her. They had pillaged his body. Were they looking
for something which they expected he would have on him, and which,
not finding, they assumed had been sent in the letter that he had
registered to his daughter in England the day before? They must
have found the receipt for the letter in his note-case.</p>

<p>In all likelihood, a message must have been sent to England, a
telegram probably, telling her murderer to be on the lookout.</p>

<p>But what could have happened in the quaint little town to cause
such a scheme to be necessary. Money? Inheritance? Something
momentous it must have been.</p>

<p>Pointer did not doubt Toni's honesty. "Yes," he murmured to
himself, "it looks as though something very important had happened
that Monday in Bolzano before twelve, before the professor sent
that registered letter, and took the <i>postauto</i> on to the
Grdner Tal."</p>

<p>Pointer made his way to the Sotto Prefectura, and roamed its
passages, and blundered in and out of its rooms, with as little
attention paid him as though he had been a blue-bottle. At last, by
mere luck, he found an elderly, pleasant-faced Italian, who looked
up, and to his oft-repeated, "<i>Il Sotto-Prefetto</i>?" replied,
"I myself. To what do I owe the honour?"</p>

<p>Pointer laid his credentials down on the table and explained
them. The Italian looked them over very carefully, then rose and
bowed, glanced at the collar lying beside him, evidently decided
that decorations need not be worn, and bowed again as he sat
down.</p>

<p>"I am over here to try to trace a much respected compatriot, a
Professor Charteris, who we know passed through this part of the
world a fortnight ago. I found his murdered body to-day."</p>

<p>The sub-prefect, who had been listening as one listens to
foreigners, intent on letting no strangely pronounced word slip
past him unrecognised, his hands pressed back to back between his
knees, relaxed, to throw them out in horror.</p>

<p>"Murdered?"</p>

<p>"Murdered. Now the guide who led me to the body as soon as he
heard the description of the man, was Ladiner Toni."</p>

<p>He told Toni's story very carefully, and the corroboration of
the chamois hunter.</p>

<p>"They are children," the sotto-prefetto said, shaking his head,
"but it has an ugly sound."</p>

<p>"It has, signore, but there is a private matter behind all this.
His daughter was murdered on Thursday in England. He on the Tuesday
morning, here in Tirol."</p>

<p>"Alto Adige," corrected the Italian official immediately.</p>

<p>"That was why Scotland Yard decided to hunt out the
father&mdash;as a matter of routine," continued Pointer. Whenever
he insisted on doing something in his own way, he referred to it as
the Yard's doing, and himself, by inference, as the straw blown
hither or thither by a higher power.</p>

<p>"Private affair? A vendetta?"</p>

<p>"We don't know. It's a very mysterious story altogether. But it
would suit us to keep the fact that he has been murdered quiet for
a while yet. If you could seal up that rock and leave him
there&mdash;and let the matter rest awhile? It has nothing to do
with Toni, that I'll stake my position on. There's an inheritance
mixed up in the affair, and that may be at the bottom of the two
murders. This part of the world is famous for its absence of
crime&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Smugglers thick as flies on honey," murmured the
sotto-prefetto, but he was pleased at the tribute.</p>

<p>"I was speaking of serious crimes, and it is only fair that the
good name of Tir&mdash;the Alto Adige, should not be tarnished
because of a crime undoubtedly unconnected with it. Connected quite
certainly with the other affair. Now, could I see the charge-sheet
for Monday morning?"</p>

<p>The papers were laid before him. Pointer learnt that on that
Monday had taken place:</p>

<p>(1) A bicyclist fined for riding on a footpath.</p>

<p>(2) A pane of glass broken.</p>

<p>(3) A street accident.</p>

<p>It was not a hopeful-sounding list for two murders.</p>

<p>The broken pane of glass was in a cake shop. The criminals, two
little boys. Remained the street accident.</p>

<p>A wealthy Bulgarian gentleman, a rose-grower of Kazanlik, had
been run over by a runaway cart-horse. He had died at the hospital,
or just before. His papers were all in order, and his body had been
at once claimed and taken on home by his friends.</p>

<p>Pointer rose. This was his last hope. That gone, there remained
only some chance meeting, some stray letter.</p>

<p>The Bulgarian had been taken to Bolzano's one hospital. Thither
Pointer went and made further inquiries about this Mr. Drinoff.</p>

<p>The sister in charge, a quaint, tubby little person, in her ugly
habit, looked up the records for him. They were very ordinary. The
gentleman was dead when he got there, so he had been sent at once
to the mortuary chapel. Some of his friends had arrived a little,
later and claimed him, and after that&mdash;she did not know exact
particulars. They had taken him back to Bulgaria eventually. If
Pointer wanted dates, she could only refer him to Doctor Sanftl. He
would know. He had hoped to save him at first, for the man was
barely dead. What hour was this? just before dinner, about eleven,
or possibly half-past. The sister's dinner was at twelve, and she
had had a very sketchy one in consequence.</p>

<p>Had a friend come with him?</p>

<p>Not a friend, a kindly passer-by had come in. Another Bulgarian
who spoke German very well.</p>

<p>"Was he by any chance tall, thin, and elderly?"</p>

<p>"<i>Eben</i>! Tall, thin, and elderly. Some sort of a professor,
judging by his scholarly face."</p>

<p>She was quite sure he could not be English?</p>

<p>Put point-blank to her like that, the sister could only say that
she had taken it for granted, being a foreigner, that he was also a
Bulgarian, but she had no real grounds for that belief. Doctor
Sanftl would know. Doctor Sanftl had talked to the gentleman a good
deal.</p>

<p>Could Pointer see the doctor?</p>

<p>He was no longer at the hospital. He had left only a week ago
and was now at the Mariahilf hospital in Innsbruck, but the
gentleman could write.</p>

<p>He could, and he could also travel, and that by the next train,
Pointer thought.</p>

<p>Doctor Sanftl had liked him immensely, that elderly foreigner,
and had asked him to come again in the afternoon, he had something
he wanted to show him, but the gentleman had to go on&mdash;some
excursion he wanted to make, some ruins he wanted to see, if she
remembered aright.</p>

<p>Pointer took the next train up the wild Brenner Pass and on to
Innsbrck. Next morning he drove out to the hospital standing
outside the town, all dreary and dirty in its summer gray.</p>

<p>"A friend of Professor Charteris, of the professor with the
interesting views on chemical affinities? <i>Gruss Gott</i>!" The
doctor shook hands warmly.</p>

<p>What could he do for the professor's friend? "Nothing, judging
by your looks," he added, "though you've been worrying over
something lately."</p>

<p>Pointer, who took all his cases very hard, was surprised at the
big stout man's acumen.</p>

<p>Yes, he had been worrying&mdash;about the professor.</p>

<p>They had had no news of him since he had arrived in Bolzano. Was
the doctor sure that the dead Bulgarian had been a stranger to the
professor?</p>

<p>The doctor was quite sure.</p>

<p>"Where are my notes of the case&mdash;ah, I remember, they're at
Bolzano."</p>

<p>"The sister said not."</p>

<p>"Which sister? Bright eyes, nose rather beaky?" Pointer-could
not cope with this description in a foreign tongue, but he
described her laboriously.</p>

<p>"<i>Freilich! Freilich</i>! That's the one. Well, she ought to
know. Wonderfully accurate woman." The doctor thought hard, his
hands deep in his long white overall. "I know! Of course! As the
man was dead, my notes on his injuries were never asked for. I
stuck them into my laboratory locker, and there they are still. I
forgot to clear that out when I came on here." He suddenly flushed.
"<i>Alle welt noch 'mal</i>! I do believe the man's letter-case is
there, too. Oh, no money! But a couple of Bulgarian letters. I
asked your friend to go over them for me in the afternoon, as he
knew Bulgarian, but, as a matter of fact, we didn't need them. The
man's passport and papers were at his hotel and all in perfect
order.</p>

<p>"The professor could not come that afternoon, but he promised to
look at them next morning. He was going out to the Grdner Tal. But
he, too, forgot! Sister Fini did remind me of that locker, but I
was in a bit of a rush at the last. I've the key still here." He
dived into a pocket like a kit-bag. "No, not here. Here," he pulled
open the table drawer, "here it is. I must send it back, and get
them to send on the letter-case to its owner."</p>

<p>Pointer said that he was on his way back at once, and would hand
the key over.</p>

<p>"<i>Famos</i>! That saves me a letter. Care to look over the
wards?"</p>

<p>Pointer declined that treat, and caught the train. Sister Fini
sniffed as she took the key.</p>

<p>"Just like him! He's a very clever doctor, but forgetful! I
remember his putting down some one's name twice for the same
operation. Here is the locker. The letter-case is your friend's,
you say. If he left it behind him, and spoke of coming back in the
afternoon, it would be just like Doctor Sanftl to drop it into his
cupboard and never think of it again. It's not one he often goes
to." She opened the locker. Pointer picked up at once a letter-case
folded in three. Inside were a couple of business-looking letters.
Otherwise it seemed empty. The letters had pictures and doubtless
the name of some Bulgarian firm on both envelope and sheet. Sister
Fini was pouncing on other treasure trove.</p>

<p>"My scissors! I knew he had them! I knew it! I only hope there
was nothing of that poor dead gentleman's that got tossed in here,
too." She peered around anxiously. "His friends were so sure that
something had been lost or overlooked. We really had quite a scene
with them. Doctor Sanftl isn't one to listen to that sort of
suggestion calmly." She was peering into the cupboard. "No, there's
nothing else except the doctor's own papers. They looked over the
room upstairs&mdash;the room into which the body was taken, so I
think we may be sure that nothing was left. They actually thought
their friend might have been robbed while in the hospital! I told
them that he had not been alone for a moment. First your friend,
then the doctor, and then the orderlies who carried him off."</p>

<p>"They asked for my friend's name and address, didn't they?"
Pointer spoke as though the doctor might have told him as much.</p>

<p>"Yes, they were so sorry to think that they had actually passed
him by on the steps. They were hurrying in, thinking of the
terrible accident, and your friend was reading some directions the
doctor had written down for him about the new hours when the
autocar leaves for the Grdner Tal. They would so have liked to
thank him for his kindness. Well, I'm relieved that all is all
right now." She beamed cheerily, and showed Pointer out.</p>

<p>The Scotland Yard man speculated on how much time would elapse
before she would have spread the news of his friend's pocket-book.
If he had been able to bribe an orderly in London, so could others
here.</p>

<p>Sister Josephine had a carrying voice. And the pocketbook might
be the key, might be the reason, the long-sought motive, behind
this puzzling case.</p>

<p>Pointer leant back against his locked door at the hotel, and
took out the letters, which were in Cyrillic characters. Feeling
carefully, he found an inner, secret pocket, over whose mouth a
band for stamps slipped. Inside this was a very thin sheet of paper
covered with what looked like a poem in faint, fine writing. It,
too, was in Russian characters.</p>

<p>Pointer's eyes glowed. The paper was the kind used for secret
messages in all countries. Very fine and very tough, capable at
need of being tied to a pigeon's wing or folded into a cigarette.
If he was right, he had the treasure in his steady hands&mdash;the
cause of two murders.</p>

<p>He returned it to its inner place, for, being in Russian
characters, he dared not copy it, and the ink was too faint and
blue for it to photograph well. At Scotland Yard are good
interpreters. He must get this home to them at once.</p>

<p>The registered post was too uncertain; flying machines might
arouse attention. He decided to carry it home by rail and boat,
home to the best brains in England to decipher, and then, and then
only, he would know the motive behind the double crime.</p>

<p>He would have liked to divine it before he learnt it. Vaguely
something of the truth was filtering in even now, but he must wait.
How long would he be allowed to keep his find? As long, he thought,
as some one at the hospital would take to telephone, or he had
misjudged the whole affair.</p>

<p>He turned, and walked slowly up and down in the Piazza Walther,
pretending an interest in the minstrel's statue.</p>

<p>Supposing, he thought, that what was wanted was merely to put
out of the way, to kill the owner, or supposed owner of that paper,
he would not have a chance of reaching England alive. Not one. But,
as he saw it, it was the paper, not his death in itself or by
itself, which they wanted.</p>

<p>His death might be decreed, if he had read it, like the
professor's death, like Rose Charteris's death, but the possession
of the paper in each case had been and would be the primary
objective.</p>

<p>Here lay his one chance of reaching home. For the murderer was
obviously not working alone. Another hand had killed the father
from that which had murdered the daughter. A third person might be
put on duty in his case.</p>

<p>Pointer went to the post-office and wired to O'Connor.</p>
<br>

<p class="telegram">IF WANTING A CHANGE, JOIN ME IN BOLZANO. BRING
TOZER.</p>
<br>

<p>Tozer was O'Connor's name for his automatic. Pointer turned away
feeling that he had taken out a very good insurance for the
paper.</p>

<p>His room at the Laurin was between two others. He took another
for his friend, and into that upper room he himself slipped late
that evening, after arranging a bolster shape in his bed. Even so,
he spent the night with his doors and windows securely wedged. Nor
did he go downstairs until the house was well astir. Then he
glanced into his own room. The threads of finest spider-silk that
lie had stretched across door and windows were broken. The dummy
was not as he had left it. The clothes on the chair were not
precisely as he had laid them. So the hunt was up! His blood ran
swifter for the thought. There is something in the human being that
enjoys a chase, even in the form of the quarry.</p>

<p>Pointer loafed the morning in front of the caf until his answer
came, "O'Connor and I arriving Friday one thirty.&mdash;Tozer."</p>

<p>So by noon to-morrow he would have his friend and the paper its
second guardian. O'Connor must have done some rapid packing. Until
his arrival, Pointer decided to take an open-air cure. Bolzano was
a dream of blue skies, with the beautiful, ever-changing green of
the hills around it. Plum purple, the great ridge of the Mendel
range, a snowy veil still hung over the Rosengarten, all around was
the broad valley of the Isarco, the river that the Talfer joins
under one of the bridges. All the way to Merano stretched a sea of
fruit trees coming into blossom. The little town was gay as the
South and busy as the North. Pointer could have stayed on gladly
for the mere beauty of it. He took his lunch, not in the hotel, but
in the little garden park, off rolls and cold meat that he himself
purchased in the shops. The afternoon was spent outdoors in the one
smart caf of the place, and was followed by dinner on similar
lines to the lunch. He used neither bedroom that night, but
arranged for a very late bath, and made himself comfortable in the
tub with a pillow and a feather duvet smuggled from his room. The
bathroom looked out on to the same side as his own room. There were
two men who spent the late evening hours watching the hotel from a
house opposite. About midnight he saw some sort of a sign pass, by
means of a white handkerchief, to others watching in the hotel
itself, doubtless in his own room. Pointer would have liked nothing
better than to step in suddenly, but at present he was not Pointer,
but the warden of a thing at once a possible treasure and an
expected revelation, and the rope which was to hang a murderer. The
bathroom handle moved very softly. Besides being locked, there was
a wedge under it, and Pointer only prodded the duvet into a more
comfortable mattress as he listened intently. The bathroom had had
a bell, but it was out of order, so the boots had told him.</p>

<p>Pointer had made it worth the night-porter's while to mend it.
He had tried it just before "taking his tub," and had explained to
the man, a conscientious but dull-witted Tiroler, that, being a
poor sleeper, he had found that nothing helped him so much on a
sleepless night as a cold dip. On a bad night he would sometimes
have two, or three dips. By all the signs, this was going to be a
bad night. So if he, Andreas, heard him, he was not to be
surprised.</p>

<p>"But how about a cup of coffee?" suggested the man after
"studying" things over for several minutes like a true Bozener, "I
keep some standing hot all night."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Pointer. "A cup of coffee and a bath together would
be splendid. If I ring from the bathroom, just set the cup down
outside."</p>

<p>Andreas said he would, and departed.</p>

<p>Pointer thought this an excellent time for that cup as he
listened to the faint stirs and breathings outside. If only
Andreas's step were not first cousin to a carpet-beater's thud! But
at night Andreas evidently put on list shoes, for there was a
sudden exclamation and a scurry from the quiet over-timers outside
the door, and a scandalised "<i>Nanu</i>!" from Andreas. A tray was
put hastily down, and Pointer opened the door. His bedroom was
close by. He dropped pillow and "divvy" into it, and stepped back
to examine the bathroom door. Like all the rooms in the hotel, it
had the dangerous Continental double door, one a foot or two within
the other, so that a thief need only open and close the outer door
to be in a small lobby, where he can work unnoticed.</p>

<p>Pointer flashed his torch over the hinges. One was already
half-eaten through with acid. He waited for Andreas.</p>

<p>"What was wrong?" Pointer asked. "Bring the coffee to my
room."</p>

<p>Andreas shook his head with a tolerant grin.</p>

<p>"A bit fuddled. Gentlemen will have their joke. Two friends of
yours intended to help you with your dip. They couldn't find the
handle, however, and must have been trying to unbolt the hinges
when I arrived."</p>

<p>Pointer laughed and offered him a cigar.</p>

<p>"Which of the lot was that?"</p>

<p>"I don't know their names. It's the two Fascisti who have
numbers seventeen and eighteen."</p>

<p>"Fascisti?"</p>

<p>"Well, they looked it."</p>

<p>"Get me their names from the book, will you."</p>

<p>Andreas brought him back a <i>chit</i>, on which he had
scrawled, "Signor Gregorio Massa and Signor Antonio Massa."</p>

<p>"As I thought!" Pointer beamed. "Just the fellows, to try on a
joke like that. Are they in their rooms now?"</p>

<p>The night-porter thought that they were. He had only caught
sight of the door being closed. A final tip changed hands, and
Pointer was alone.</p>

<p>After a little interval he crept out and along the passage to
the numbers given. He heard two men's voices in seventeen. Not very
pleased voices either. One was very low, but every now and then one
would be raised hysterically, to be instantly quieted by a sharp
low word from his companion. Pointer caught one such higher pitched
word. It was a name. After it came a sudden pause, a pause of
consternation. Pointer could almost visualise a hand clapped over a
garrulous mouth. He was no longer near the door when it was
noiselessly opened, but was well away on the upper landing. Lying
down at full length, he saw a tall figure, its loose top-locks
falling around it like a feather duster, search the lower corridor
from end to end, noiseless in its movements as a horse-fly. Then it
disappeared, and the door was shut without a sound.</p>

<p>Pointer felt like a dog hot on a scent and suddenly pulled up.
One word he had heard, one name. Well he knew now, and he realised
his danger.</p>

<p>Friday morning was spent like its predecessor, except for a
telegram to di Monti appointing next Tuesday afternoon without fail
for a meeting in New Scotland Yard and by noon Pointer was shaking
hands with the tall lean figure of O'Connor on the Bozen
platform.</p>

<p>"So our long-planned walking tour is coming of last?"</p>

<p>"It is," Pointer agreed "We begin it by taking train for Verona
in an hour. Where's your bag; this man can carry it too."</p>

<p>Pointer had come accompanied by one of the town
luggage-carriers, so as not to chance being alone on platform or in
waiting-room So far, there had been no need of this precaution, but
he had not cared to omit it.</p>

<p>"My bag? Tozer wouldn't let me wait to pack. And how's
yourself?"</p>

<p>Pointer breathed in his ear.</p>

<p>"I've a pocket-book strapped to me, with a paper inside, which
we must get home to the Yard. It'll clear the air."</p>

<p>"You're right, she's an uncommonly pretty girl," O'Connor agreed
aloud, as lighting a cigarette and whirling on one heel to throw
away the match, all in one swift motion, he almost burnt the tie of
a man behind. The man, a typical Fascist by his hair and
tightly-buttoned black shirt and thick, cudgel-like stick which he
carried, hurried on.</p>

<p>Pointer, opened and shut his eyes as though saying, "Even
so!"</p>

<p>"Brother Massa," he murmured. "He's off for the ticket office.
Now, you get some food inside yourself, while I take our seats in
the carriage that's put on here."</p>

<p>"Can you manage your luggage alone?" O'Connor asked
cautiously.</p>

<p>"Can do," Pointer reassured him. O'Connor stepped into the
buffet.</p>

<p>The usual change had come over the platform. A moment ago all
was bustle; now it was almost deserted. Pointer had told his man
what seats he wanted. The porter stepped in with the suitcase. In
swinging it up, it caught in the curtain and almost overpowered
him, for it was very heavy. Pointer made no move to assist. He
stood well out on the platform.</p>

<p>Suddenly something knocked his feet from under him. A bag
carried by another traveller had skidded from some three yards
away. The man rushed up with apologies, in his hand the
rubber-covered club of the Fascisti, the Italian sandbag. Pointer
dodged the club and shot out his right with all the strength of his
back behind it. The man who had had the accident with the bag
sagged inertly forward. Pointer was on his feet now, and directing
a kick at the shins of the porter, who had leapt out of the
compartment. Pointer was not sure whether he were in the affair or
not, but he could not afford to take a chance. The way the man
acted cleared up his doubts. Instead of a volley of abuse, and
calls to his mates, he picked up his <i>Facchino</i> cap and dived
under the coach, just as an official from another platform hurried
up.</p>

<p>"<i>Ola! Cosa </i>?"</p>

<p>"Apparently this man has had a fit," Pointer answered in his
careful Italian. "His bag slipped from his hand and knocked me
down, too."</p>

<p>The man bent over the silent figure. He saw the black neck
scarf, the hair, the rubber club.</p>

<p>"Take the man to the ambulance-room. Tell the <i>Commandante</i>
about him. As for you, sir, you will be detained till he is able to
tell us what happened."</p>

<p>"Can I telephone to your Sotto-prefetto?" asked Pointer.</p>

<p>A couple of Carabinieri who had strolled up said something to
the station official. They evidently knew all about Pointer, for
the Italian saluted at once.</p>

<p>"My excuses. I could not know. Nowadays one has to be careful,
and he looked as though he had had a hard blow, on the point of the
chin, too."</p>

<p>"Indeed! I took it for granted it was a fit."</p>

<p>"A very sensible view to take," the Italian said, with a rather
dry smile as he passed on.</p>

<p>At Verona the two friends caught the Milan-Paris express, and
settled themselves for the night in an empty first. They decided
not to risk a sleeping car. Pointer was to stay awake the first
part of the night, the Irishman relieving him after a rest.</p>

<p>Pointer was on the alert. He felt sure that further attempts
would be made. He slipped back the two catches of the door opposite
the corridor and wedged it with a cake of soap so that it looked
shut, but would open at a touch.</p>

<p>"Just in case we need to slip out of the back-door in a hurry,"
he explained.</p>

<p>O'Connor nodded, and turned over, closing his eyes. The door of
the corridor opened not long afterwards.</p>

<p>"<i>Favorisca, i biglietti!</i>" intoned a voice in the
ticket-collector's usual sing-song. As usual, too, the man was
accompanied by a second, who closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>Now Pointer had noticed a man stroll twice past the compartment
at Verona. He had a bright brass eyelet shining from his black
boot. When the man in the long coat and braided cap of the
conductor slid open the door, Pointer's eye was upon a similar
brass eyelet in his right boot. He roused O'Connor with the danger
signal of "Wake up, Tozer!" But a mistake either way would be
awkward. With his left hand he slipped the tickets along the seat,
the next second he caught the sham ticket-collector's wrist in a
vice that sent the knife to the floor. Then they grappled. The man
was a big, sinewy chap, strong as a conger eel and almost as
difficult to hold. O'Connor was dealing with his companion, but he,
too, was having his work cut out. Though the Englishmen did not
know it, they were struggling with a couple of the most dreaded of
the Naples <i>Maffei</i>, killers by trade, with lists of victims
as long as their own arms. They fought like savages. Pointer's
allotment always trying with his thumbs for the other's eyes, his
teeth snapping at his throat. If Pointer and O'Connor were both
well up in jiu-jitsu, these men had similar tricks handed down from
the Moors of Sicily, and used by Neapolitan criminals for
centuries. But there was one thing that the Englishman knew, and
their assailants did not, and that was about the door. With a
wrench, Pointer managed to slew his man around, and fling him
against it. The Italian went hurtling out. O'Connor's man struggled
desperately, but they heaved him after his friend. Then Pointer
pulled the chain. He did not want the two men to possibly crawl
away to safety.</p>

<p>The express did not stop, but the guard, the ticket
collector&mdash;the real one&mdash;and the soldier who generally
accompanies Italian expresses, rushed up to the corridor door.</p>

<p>"Two men came in just now, one wearing a ticket collector's cap
and coat," Pointer explained "They attacked my friend and me. In
our struggle the door catches must have given way. The door flew
open, and the man fell on the line. I pulled the signal at
once."</p>

<p>"The catches are in perfect order," the conductor said trying
them, "and very stiff. One goes up, the other down. If the door
opened, it was opened. And how could two men fall out? The affair
will be inquired into thoroughly. And how about thy cap and coat?"
The guard turned to the ticket collector.</p>

<p>That official's story was that taking them off to enjoy his
supper more at his ease, he had hung them on a nail outside the
compartment. He had just discovered their absence when the alarm
signal was pulled.</p>

<p>Pointer felt sure that he could have got him twisted up in his
own statements in no time, had his Italian been as his English.
What he felt sure had happened was a bribe, unless the man belonged
to the same organisation. The soldier was left to guard the
compartment, bayonet fixed, "in case of any more accidents," as the
conductor said grimly. Pointer resolutely refused to show his
papers, and he and O'Connor were marched off at once on arrival at
Milan to the chief of the station police's room.</p>

<p>When the short stop of the express was nearly over, two figures
dressed in Pointer and O'Connor's travelling coats and caps got
into their compartment, but as the train started they strolled down
to the end and dropped off with the ease of railwaymen. Pointer had
decided to wait over a train. Being a night express, their absence
might not be noticed, for the officials on the train were
instructed to keep their compartment locked, and the blinds drawn
after the two temporary substitutes had left. As for Pointer and
his friend, they spent the night in the apologetic station-master's
office, which he put at their disposal, together with his dog Wolf.
When they unobtrusively slipped into the buffet early next morning
for a cup of coffee, and some of Milan's famous <i>panetone</i>,
they were told of an accident which had happened to last night's
express. It was a singular accident, too. Just after the frontier
tunnel was left behind, the express ran past a goods' train between
two Swiss stations. A slight shock was felt, and the whole side of
a first-class coach was ripped open, as though by something
suddenly protruded from the goods' train. Only one coach was
damaged. It was the one in which the two Englishmen had been
sitting. All the occupants in it were severely injured, one man
being killed. The express was delayed at the next station, where
the injured were attended to by some doctors who happened to be
waiting at the station for another train.</p>

<p>"'Happened to be waiting,' is good," was Pointer's only comment
to his friend, when they took their seats next morning in an empty
carriage. They were joined by other travelers who now got in, now
got out, till they were left at Lausanne with a quiet, ill-looking
young man, and a doctor, his anxious, attentive companion. They
were French, and judging by his talk, the younger man was a
consumptive back from a "cure" in the mountains which had not
cured. He fell into an uneasy slumber after the train started on
again, tossing and turning. Pointer and O'Connor occupied the two
middle seats. The least comfortable, but the safest. Should the
window seats be taken, they had arranged to stand in the
corridor.</p>

<p>During the war, O'Connor had come across an eye-signal language
hailing from America. He and Pointer had practised it, and changed
it, till they were masters of its capabilities. It was
undetectable.</p>

<p>Pointer occasionally glanced up from the paper which he was
reading, generally looking out of the window, but sometimes at
O'Connor, and sometimes at his fellow-travellers. O'Connor was
equally at his ease. But they were talking hard, and this is what
they were saying to each other:</p>

<p><i>Pointer</i>: "The right hand of the young man beside me seems
to get more and more out of sight. Watch it."</p>

<p><i>O'Connor</i>: "I am. His companion's feet beside me look a
bit braced. How about it?"</p>

<p><i>Pointer</i>: "When you see that right arm move forward again,
give a sniff and duck. You're right. His companion next you is
getting ready for a jump. I'll tackle his feet if he does."</p>

<p><i>O'Connor</i>: "And I'll see to&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pointer and he ducked simultaneously. A shot rang out. The young
man with a wild white face was shouting, "<i>Tirez! Tirez donc!
Passeront pas! Passeront pas</i>!"</p>

<p>The shot would have gone through Pointer's head from ear to ear
had that essential part of his body been where it was expected to
be, instead of down near his boots.</p>

<p>It was charming to see how Pointer and O'Connor worked together.
Never getting in each other's way, however cramped the space. Like
the swing of a couple of navvies' hammers, what Thornton insisted
on in life and in art, rhythm and harmony were never lost sight of.
First, Pointer pulled the feet from under the pale young man.
O'Connor did the same with the young man's companion. Pointer laid
his kicking and screaming captive on top of O'Connor's, where they
started pummelling each other. O'Connor sat on their chests,
Pointer on their feet, while the occupants of the other
compartments flocked to the door and tried to pull it open.</p>

<p>"Third party locked it when he stood with his back to us just
now. Look out for him," Pointer warned.</p>

<p>But it was the genuine conductor who unlocked it with loud
requests to know the meaning of this.</p>

<p>"<i>Passeront pas! Passeront pas</i>!" shrieked the young man,
trying to get his revolver.</p>

<p>"Without doubt wounded in the war, and not recovered even yet!"
murmured sympathetic voices in the corridor.</p>

<p>"Possibly," Pointer said, getting up, "but he swore in another
tongue altogether when his friend kicked him in the eye just
now."</p>

<p>"Here, don't claw down me socks like that," O'Connor protested
indignantly; "where's your manners." He gave the young man a tap as
he only sat the harder.</p>

<p>"Why this treatment?" shrieked the man used as a mattress by all
the three. "I am this gentleman's medical attendant. I cannot
understand&mdash;I demand explanations, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Reparations," added O'Connor under his breath. Three railway
officials freed the under-dog. Pointer spoke to him
reproachfully.</p>

<p>"But, monsieur, your patient would have shot you! My friend and
I saved your life. In the mle it was a little difficult, I own,
to distinguish friend from foe."</p>

<p>The younger man was led away. The elder, literally foaming at
the mouth, was helped to his feet.</p>

<p>Pointer and O'Connor strolled into another compartment, and
roared with delight as they reconstructed the scene.</p>

<p>When the time came for lunch, they had only two Englishwomen
with them, of the usual badly-dressed, over-smiling, over-toothed
kind that seems to live exclusively abroad.</p>

<p>"First service!" bawled the dining-car attendant. "First
service!"</p>

<p>"Are you going?" asked one of the ladies of the other.</p>

<p>"I think not, dear; I've something here with me." She patted a
little wicker case, and after the other had passed out, spread a
napkin and took out some rolls and a thermos flask.</p>

<p>Pointer and O'Connor were smoking in the corridor.</p>

<p>The lady inside leant out and asked if one of them would be so
kind as to close the window for her, she found it too hard to lift.
It was a very stiff window. O'Connor entered to help her, while
Pointer stood looking on, not suspicious, but watchful. The woman
bent forward again and said something to the Scotland Yard man,
picking up her thermos flask and a little glass as she did so.</p>

<p>He did not catch what she said, and leant down. As he bent, her
fingers tightened around the flask which was in the hand nearest
him. He had already noticed that she held it under the bottom. Her
forearm muscles stiffened, too. Pointer's one hand held the strap
of the door, his other jogged her elbow, the elbow nearest him.
Jogged it accurately. Not so hard as to deluge her with the
contents, but sufficient to let him have an idea of what the
thermos held. A straw-coloured liquid spurted up, a couple of drops
touching her cheek. She shrieked, and rising, would have flung the
contents wildly at him. A sharp tap from O'Connor lamed her arm,
and the bottle fell on the floor, the liquid running over her very
stout boots. A little must have penetrated the eyelet holes, for
she screamed horribly as she tried to tear off boots and
stockings.</p>

<p>Once more their compartment became the scene of the day. People
crowded into the corridor. The guard again appeared at the double,
together with the ticket collector, and demanded to know what was
wrong now.</p>

<p>The woman in the compartment had her feet bare by now, swinging
them to and fro over the liquid which was smoking where it bit its
way into the floor. She was moaning like some tortured animal as
she dabbed frantically at her feet and cheek, all three of which
were enormously swollen, and pitted with horrible-looking,
white-lipped holes.</p>

<p>O'Connor stood by the window and Pointer held the door. She had
twice tried to claw her way out.</p>

<p>Now he had been especially recommended in his true character to
the Frenchmen by the guards of the Swiss stretch, who had received
their instructions from the Milan railway officials. They knew that
he was carrying important papers. There was no difficulty,
therefore, as far as they were concerned. The woman was carried
into some remote, inaccessible part of the tram, medical aid was
fetched, and order once more reigned. It was given out that she had
cut herself in some way with her thermos flask lining, and that her
screams were not to be taken too seriously. The other woman would
have been arrested had they been able to find her, but she was
apparently not on the train.</p>

<p>"Changed into a young man, who would have posed as a doctor in
all likelihood, and kindly done his very best for me, and for you,
too. There was plenty for both of us in that flask. Then she'd have
turned into a dear old lady, and been helped off by the guard
himself," was Pointer's forecast of what might have been had things
gone according to plan.</p>

<p>A tanned, pleasant-looking, gray-haired Englishman standing
before his compartment a little farther down eyed them with a
humorous half-smile.</p>

<p>"You seem to make a most efficient storm-centre, you two," he
said; sauntering up to them. "I was in the train to Milan
yesterday."</p>

<p>"It appears that I have an unfortunate likeness to some one who
seems to be rather unpopular." Pointer spoke with heat, in the tone
of an outraged Briton who is already composing his letter to the
Press. "Member of some secret society which he's betrayed, so I'm
told."</p>

<p>He declined the offer of a cigar, and lit his pipe. O'Connor did
the same. Pointer had noticed the man, a typical army officer of
the old school, travelling over the Brenner yesterday with a
gunnery instructor known to him by sight, from Chatham.</p>

<p>"I suggest that you take refuge in my compartment till we get to
Paris, if you want seats. I spend most of my time in the corridor."
The man cleared off some of his belongings hospitably.</p>

<p>Pointer and O'Connor spent some pleasant hours chatting with
him. He was on his way home from India, and had some inside
information of the real currents under the surface out there.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER TEN</h2>

<p class="first">AT Paris, Pointer and O'Connor were met by the
former's brother, Cook's chief interpreter in the French capital.
He had a group of Cook's men, who ringed the Scotland Yard officer
and his companion around as he carried them off to an inner room at
the station.</p>

<p>Here Pointer received a long cable that seemed to interest him
vastly from the Yard. It wound up by stating that Mr. Thornton had
gone to Paris, and was being looked after by the French police.
Otherwise the "case" had marked time since the departure of its
leader.</p>

<p>From the French police, he learnt that Thornton was still at his
hotel, and had been spending blameless days in old curiosity shops
and unimpeachable nights tucked up in his bed.</p>

<p>Pointer thought a moment. He considered that the time had come
to have a look at Thornton's cards. The trouble was, that gentleman
had such an aversion to laying down his hand. Pointer determined to
call it without more ado. A telephone message to the hotel told him
that Thornton was still up, and in the hotel lounge. Pointer
entered it a few minutes later and shook hands. O'Connor, with his
friends, all of them seemingly strangers to the man who had just
preceded them, seated themselves some distance off. Pointer had
hardly begun an, it is to be feared, inaccurate account of his
wanderings when a page-boy brought him a telegram. Crushing the
envelope carelessly into his pocket, Pointer read the message in a
low voice, after a careful glance around to show that they were
alone.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Lane confessed. Harris."</p>

<p>Thornton turned a dull lead colour.</p>

<p>"Feeling ill, sir?" asked, the Chief Inspector.</p>

<p>"This&mdash;this message&mdash;" Thornton's voice started across
lips none too firm. They stiffened as it went on. "How&mdash;I
thought Mrs. Lane&mdash;what does it mean?" Thornton stared at the
cablegram&mdash;which Pointer and his brother had just concocted at
the railway station&mdash;as though far away, in some unpleasant,
uncertain place.</p>

<p>"It doesn't say, I see," Pointer mused aloud, "that she's
confessed to the actual murder."</p>

<p>Thornton spun around on him with something like snarl. One would
not have believed him capable of such a sound.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Lane&mdash;my wife&mdash;what the devil do you mean?" He
looked white-hot now.</p>

<p>Pointer sat down again</p>

<p>"I see. Mrs. Lane is really Mrs. Thornton. Humph! Divorced, I
presume?"</p>

<p>Thornton looked as though he would like to strike the bland face
before him. He clenched his fist.</p>

<p>"Come, come, sir." Pointer changed to a pleasanter tone. "This
won't help her, and she's in a tight spot, you know. But between us
we ought to be able to get her out. Look here, why not explain the
whole affair?"</p>

<p>Pointer spoke as though that bright idea had just occurred to
him.</p>

<p>"Your marriage, for instance."</p>

<p>"There's nothing to explain about that," Thornton spoke wearily.
"Only too usual a story, I'm afraid. An unhappy marriage&mdash;a
parting&mdash;and a chance meeting again when she took the place of
Colonel Scarlett's lady housekeeper. In justice to myself, I
thought she was amply provided for. Her father settled a large sum
on her when she married, and he died soon after, presumably a
wealthy man. It was Russia's debt-repudiation that made all the
difference, it seems. I never dreamt of that."</p>

<p>"Chance meeting?" Pointer repeated questioningly. "No, it wasn't
that, Mr. Thornton. Not on her part. She knew you were at Red
Gates. She came down because she knew that."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Just that, sir. I've seen&mdash;to be frank, we hold a letter
of hers to the colonel. In it she refers to you, and says that
she'll gladly come, provided that he will keep his promise, and
never let you know that she knew beforehand that you were living at
Red Gates."</p>

<p>Thornton got up, and walked quickly to a window. He stood with
his back to the room.</p>

<p>"How can I get her out of what I've got her into?" he asked,
without turning round.</p>

<p>"You got her into?"</p>

<p>"I put the matter in the hands of Scotland Yard, didn't I? I
knew that she was shielding some one. I know it now. She'd shield a
mad dog if it ran to her. But if so, that blow that killed Rose
Charteris was struck by some terrible accident, or in some
mistake&mdash;I can't explain it, but Beatrice, I mean my wife,
would never shield a guilty person. There never was a woman with a
clearer, cooler judgment, and a greater sense of right. To think
that she ever had a part or knowledge&mdash;the mere suggestion is
monstrous."</p>

<p>Pointer could have smiled. Beatrice Thornton had been shielding
some one.</p>

<p>Thornton still looked out of the darkened window, and Pointer
thought he heard a whispered "Beatrice" before the newly-revealed
husband turned.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you can help her better than I can. I only seem to've
drawn her deeper into things. You see, I thought that if she found
herself in a tight place, she would perforce turn to me. I was at
hand. She must have known that I&mdash;that&mdash;" He faced the
window again, his face working. "I was a fool once. I was a poor
ambitious chap once. And I won't say that her fortune counted for
nothing with me, as it should have done." Thornton fought against
the flood of emotion within him, but it had got past the gates, and
rushed him with it "After she left me&mdash;there was no divorce.
Neither of us are the kind to give the other reasons of that sort
for parting I&mdash;well, I learnt as many another fool has that I
cared a great deal more than I thought I did, or rather than she
thought I did. I came into some money, took to art collecting, to
divert my mind. But to go back to that awful Friday morning. You're
the last man to believe in spiritualism, I suppose, Chief
Inspector?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't be the first," Pointer agreed whimsically.</p>

<p>"Then you do believe in&mdash;in that sort of thing?"</p>

<p>"I think there's a deal more to us than our bodies, than what we
can feel and touch. I'm a religious man, sir. But why the
question?"</p>

<p>"Because as I sat by Rose Charteris's body in that sand-pit
early on Friday morning, I had the most extraordinary sense of
urgency, of being spurred on to take some decision quickly. I felt
as though it were a call for help from the girl whose body lay
beside me, and for immediate help. When Bond and Co. were so keen
on the police taking up the matter, the feeling had passed. I could
almost think it had passed from me into them. I
thought&mdash;better, not. I thought&mdash;" He paused again.</p>

<p>"I wonder what you did think?" Pointer still spoke
pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Then, as now, I never doubted&mdash;my wife. Naturally! I knew,
knew that she had no hand in any crime, except to help&mdash;the
victim. I thought if I could talk things over with her
first&mdash;but walking away from the police-station I got that
message of haste again. And this time it conquered. It quite
obsessed me. I felt as though Rose herself were begging me to lose
no time. I can't put the sensation into words, any more than one
could light or dark." There was a long pause.</p>

<p>"And did you lend Mrs. Lane your car, or did she get it out
herself?"</p>

<p>Thornton drew in his breath sharply.</p>

<p>"You're right. Frankness is the only thing now, I see. I lent
her the car. She woke me up about one on Thursday night or rather
Friday morning, tapping on my bedroom window. It opens on to my
balcony, too, you know. She asked me to let her have my big car at
once. She asked me&mdash;" He hesitated in deep distress.</p>

<p>"Yes? We know the facts about the car," Pointer said very
gently.</p>

<p>"To let her have it for a couple of hours, and to lend it
without asking her any questions about it. I came down and got it
out. She wouldn't let me drive it even into the lane for her, and
she begged me&mdash;there were tears in her eyes, and she looked,
good God!" Thornton seemed to fall into a brooding pity, "she
begged me never to refer to the matter again. I promised. I got the
car out and left her, and it. She even made me promise that I
wouldn't watch which way the car went."</p>

<p>There followed a long silence.</p>

<p>"That's all," Thornton said under his breath. "I only hope I've
done right in speaking of it."</p>

<p>"You've done no harm, sir, because we knew it more or less
already. And that's really all, sir?"</p>

<p>"All. My word on that. And now you see the mingled feelings that
made me ask you to look into the case. There was the sensation of
being impelled to it by Miss Rose herself. There was the presence
of Bond and Co. They never let things drop. And there was&mdash;it
sounds caddish, but there was also the hope that by crowding my
wife into a corner, she might turn to me&mdash;in her fright."</p>

<p>"She didn't get frightened, more's the pity," Pointer said
rather sourly. "It would have shortened things a lot if she had.
You recognised her, I suppose, when she looked out at Miss
Scarlett's room, when you and Doctor Metcalfe drove up on Friday
morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"She went in to speak to Miss Scarlett. She had lent her some
toothache medicine and wanted it back. As Miss Scarlett was asleep,
she was going out again, when she heard the car. That, at least, is
what she told Maud, and I think it is the truth."</p>

<p>"But why&mdash;what&mdash;" In Thornton's voice was an anguish
that had been racking his heart for many days now.</p>

<p>Pointer did not reply to it.</p>

<p>"What was Mrs. Thornton's maiden name, by the way?"</p>

<p>"Lane. She was the daughter of our minister to the Netherlands.
We were married at the Hague by the Embassy Chaplain in&mdash;" He
gave the date.</p>

<p>There was another pause, then Thornton said shyly, "That letter
you found? You really mean that. Be&mdash;Mrs. Thornton&mdash;knew
that I was at Red Gates?"</p>

<p>Pointer nodded. "That's why she took the place. It's the first
time in my life that I ever betrayed to one man what I had found in
the course of my investigations in another man's private papers.
It's not a breach of discipline I shall care to remember. But for
this once&mdash;well, in this case, I've done it." He finished with
a smile, then his face grew grave again.</p>

<p>"What dress was Mrs. Lane, to call her by the name I've known
her under for so long, what dress was she wearing?" Pointer next
asked.</p>

<p>"I seem to remember something very dark. Blue or black."</p>

<p>"And what took you out so early that Friday morning?"</p>

<p>Thornton hesitated again. He took out his cigarette and looked
at it, as though not quite certain what it was that he had been
smoking. Finally he looked at the detective-officer almost as Toni
had done, in mingled appeal and trouble.</p>

<p>"If you could have seen her face! She was all in."</p>

<p>He bit his own lip. "And besides, Bond and Co. had gone out, I
knew. As I couldn't get asleep, I decided to take a walk."</p>

<p>"But where has she gone? The colonel, he tells me not to worry,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll meet her again very shortly. We have her address. She
was a bit indiscreet over the telephone, and we traced her to some
old friends. And now, patience a little longer, sir."</p>

<p>Pointer got up.</p>

<p>"I want you to be at my rooms at New Scotland Yard the day after
to-morrow, that will be Tuesday, at three, without fail. Something
went wrong with those casts last time. The mixture wasn't right,
and we must take them all over again. But I shan't have to trouble
you a third time." Pointer was quite sure about that last.</p>

<p>Thornton nodded. He seemed in some strangely happy mood. Pointer
felt that a shock awaited him, when, on landing in Dover next day,
he would be met by a telegram from the man to whom he was now
talking, telling him that a mistake had been made, and that the
"confession" was one of the many spurious ones that dot all murder
cases. But Pointer&mdash;to atone&mdash;had ended with "Mrs.
Lane's" present address.</p>

<p>Thornton duly departed for England by the 8.25 next day, and
Pointer followed by the ten train.</p>

<p>He and O'Connor had an uneventful trip in the packed boat-train.
They stood with a couple of "Tom's friends" on either side of them
in the corridor.</p>

<p>At Calais they were escorted by them on to the boat, and only
left when the gangway threatened to be hoisted.</p>

<p>Pointer and O'Connor were hailed by a cheery voice. They had
caught sight of their acquaintance of the previous day, on the
boat-train, but the three had mutually contented themselves with
nods.</p>

<p>General Thompson, as he gave his name, dragged his chair up
alongside theirs. They sat idly chatting together when he commented
on the crowd at a particular part of the ship.</p>

<p>"They're for their passport cards," O'Connor explained.</p>

<p>The general heard for the first time that it was still necessary
to get a ticket showing the passport to be in order. He groaned,
and with a faint "damn" at useless red tape, he left his kitbag to
keep his chair, and joined the queue on the lower deck. O'Connor
strolled that way, too, after a glance at Pointer.</p>

<p>Left by himself, the Chief Inspector eyed the bag. He mopped his
forehead, and as though in answer to a signal, as indeed it was, a
tall man stood beside him. It was the ship's detective.</p>

<p>"Just glance at that bag, but go carefully," Pointer said.</p>

<p>The man went below, and reappeared almost at once.</p>

<p>"Can you show me the man who placed it there, sir? It's not an
ordinary bag. I don't know whether it's O.K. or not. We'll let him
open it."</p>

<p>"A friend of mine is keeping with him&mdash;just in case. Did
you hear anything tick? I thought I did. May, of course, be an
alarm clock."</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector pointed out O'Connor and the owner of the
bag among the thinning crowd.</p>

<p>The ship's detective touched the latter on the arm.</p>

<p>"Sorry to trouble you, sir, but there's been a thief on board.
We've caught him red-handed. That gentleman here," he indicated
Pointer, "says one of the bags is one which you left on your seat.
Will you kindly identify it when you've done here?"</p>

<p>"I strolled off," Pointer explained, "and found your bag gone
when I got back. Luckily, some one saw the man making off with
it."</p>

<p>"It was trying to pinch a bride's Paris bonnet really did for
him," said the detective, with a laugh. "He might have got away
with it but for that."</p>

<p>The man beside O'Connor gave a cheery ha, ha! and turned away to
see about his passport.</p>

<p>"That's my bag, all right," he said, as he saw a battered
kit-bag, with a newer one beside it, standing on a table in a sort
of private cabin. "My initials on it. R.M.T. Here's my
passport."</p>

<p>As the passport showed him to be Major-General Thompson, C.B.,
the purser handed it back with a bow, and a cold look at the
detective. "That's all right, sir," he began.</p>

<p>"If you'll just unlock it as a matter of formality," the
detective suggested, "in case of other claimants&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Certainly." General Thompson pulled out his keys, ran them
through his fingers, and then shook his head.</p>

<p>"Where's that key gone to? Why, of course!" He stopped jingling
them. "I left it tied to the handle, because of the Customs, you
know. The chap who stole it must have bagged it."</p>

<p>"No keys whatever on him, sir," said the detective.</p>

<p>"Then he lost it, or dropped it overboard."</p>

<p>"Ah, he might have done that," the man agreed.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what; I've got another key at home. I'll leave
the bag with you, and send the key down. I'm in no hurry for it,
provided I get it eventually." The general turned to go.</p>

<p>There was a pulse beating in the temple of his bronzed face. As
soon as the door had closed behind him, the detective beckoned to
another in an inner room, and working like madmen, they locked a
life-buoy on to the bag, fastened both to a chain, and flung the
whole very lightly far out of the special port-hole into the sea,
keeping it away from the side of the boat with a long flexible
steel rod which opened out swiftly.</p>

<p>"Mine-sweepers' gear," the detective said with a grin. "Now
we'll see. I thought the general was a bit on hot plates as the
talk went on."</p>

<p>Five minutes passed, ten were nearly over, when there was a very
pretty little fountain to be seen at sea which greatly delighted
those on deck, who decided it must have been a couple of porpoises
off their usual beat. Those in the cabin hauled in the chain, and
found a few bits of life-buoy and leather hanging to the
padlock.</p>

<p>"Very neat. Meant just for you and me," said O'Connor. "Just
enough to help hitch our combined wagons to the stars, without
damaging the boat. And where's the proud inventor?"</p>

<p>"He was shown into another cabin when he walked out of this, and
by now he'll be safely secured."</p>

<p>But he was more. He was dead, with a tiny bottle clenched in one
hand. They never knew his real name.</p>

<p>"Good," said the two friends, "then we can go on deck again,"
and they thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful approach to England. They
waited till the crowd was almost off the boat. Then they shook
hands with three men, one of whom was Pointer's chief, and with
whom they travelled up in a special guarded car.</p>

<p>Safely in his own rooms at the Yard, Pointer handed over a
pocket book sewn into oiled silk, and went off for a wash and brush
up, feeling like a boy home from school, now that his part in
safeguarding that paper was done. The paper which he believed to
have cost the life of Professor Charteris, of his daughter, and of
the man with the bag, as well as severe bodily injuries, so he
trusted, to the two men with whom O'Connor and he had struggled in
the compartment before they could get them out on to the line.</p>

<p>The "poem" on the thin paper was re-written within the hour by
the Home Office expert. It explained the care taken to regain it.
It was a paper that shook the world when it was broadcasted later.
But the cipher would have been insoluble without the code-word. The
Home Office had that code-word. It had cost a British life for
every letter in it.</p>

<p>It was decided that news should be circulated at once through
discreetly indiscreet channels that the Yard was in possession of a
couple of Bulgarian letters and a poem which they believed
contained secret intelligence bearing on Red activities in that
country, but which they were unable to solve. Copies would be sent
post-haste to a few thoroughly untrustworthy Russian interpreters
marked on the books as in the Bolsheviks' pay. They would be asked
to help. A reward would be offered.</p>

<p>It was about half-past two on the next day, Tuesday, when a
constable opened Pointer's door at the Yard. "A lady to see you by
appointment, sir."</p>

<p>"Show the lady in. And bring in the gentleman who's been waiting
in Watts' room at the same time."</p>

<p>Sibella entered with a sort of rush. She looked shocking. So
ill, so worn, so white. Pointer thought of some plant whose roots
are perishing. It seemed to him as though all the healthy,
multifold ties between a woman and the world around her had been
cut through in this case, and that Sibella was dying by inches of
some fungus, some mildew, of the spirit.</p>

<p>With all her impetuous entrance, she sank wearily into a chair.
But her eyes stared at him almost as her father's might have
done.</p>

<p>"You telephoned me that there were important developments."</p>

<p>"They're coming. But first I want you to answer a few questions,
and to hear some facts. Ah, here's Count di Monti."</p>

<p>Sibella sprang up with a gasp. Di Monti, too, looked unprepared
for the meeting.</p>

<p>"Please sit down, both of you," the Chief Inspector went on, "it
may take some time, this preliminary clearing of the ground. Miss
Scarlett, first of all, the information you gave Count di Monti
about the meetings in the studio had nothing whatever to do with
your cousin's death."</p>

<p>"Oh!" It was a cry of mingled anguish and relief, of horror and
joy. "Oh, is that true?" Her eyes went from him to the count, and
back again.</p>

<p>"If you were told to the contrary," Pointer went on very
sternly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I never told you that was the reason. I don't know the reason.
How can I? I had nothing to do with that death." Di Monti's voice
was hard and strident as he interrupted.</p>

<p>Sibella turned on him. She evidently dared not trust herself to
speak. She only looked.</p>

<p>"If this man told you anything else, Miss Scarlett," Pointer
went on, "it was because it suited his purpose that you should
think that you, too, in a sense, were a contributory
cause&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In a sense!" Sibella covered her face. "Oh, it's not possible!
Not possible! No one would make their worst enemy suffer what I've
suffered since Rose's death. I've been down, down, down," she broke
off, shuddering. "I thought that I had killed her in everything but
actually striking the blow. That my hand had directed his&mdash;I
mean&mdash;" she stopped herself. "Since they brought her body home
I've thought that it was my doing."</p>

<p>She was shuddering from head to foot.</p>

<p>"I want to know the whole story, Miss Scarlett. As for the
count&mdash;well, that will come later."</p>

<p>He looked hard at di Monti, and the count's jaws tightened.</p>

<p>"This man has no authority to ask you a single question,
Sibella." The Italian strode over to her and caught her hand in
his. "If I made you suffer, I had to."</p>

<p>"Why?" Her eyes fastened themselves with an incredulous stare on
him, as though she saw a stranger before her. "Why did you have to
make me suffer? And so terribly? Why you&mdash;me?"</p>

<p>She did not give him time to answer. And he looked as though he
would have needed time.</p>

<p>"What made you torture me? Torture me, soul and body?
I&mdash;oh&mdash;" She flung away, as though it were a tarantula,
the hand he laid on hers. "You played me! You used me as a pawn!
You thought that I might speak, might betray you, if my tongue were
not tied. It nearly worked the other way. I all but went to the
police instead of helping you to escape. All but!" She turned to
Pointer with a gesture that would have been the pride of a film
actress.</p>

<p>"Ask whatever you want to know. I shall tell you the truth."</p>

<p>"<i>Anima mia</i>!" In a stride the Italian had her in his arms.
He might as well have held a statue.</p>

<p>"I had to tell you that lie," di Monti went on, "all our future
hung on my not being arrested just then, as this buffoon would have
done. I knew when they got hold of the pendant which I had picked
up in the studio, what was coming. My faithful Arrigo saw a
policeman talking to the man to whom I had flung it, flung it as I
would a clot of mud. It meant no more to me. The pendant worn by
that&mdash;" he used an ugly Italian term, "I never wanted to soil
my fingers with again. Don't you see, darling, that all hung on my
getting away? I would never have stooped to act the mourner at her
funeral but for that necessity. I&mdash;and mourn&mdash;for
<i>her</i>! I knew you would not help me as you did unless you
thought my life was in danger, and I must have your
help&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I quite see the reason," Sibella said, in a hard, dry
voice.</p>

<p>"An arrest just then, or the talk of it, would have spelled
ruin. But now," he let her go as she stood unresponsive, no whit
softened, "but now I can snap my fingers at the policeman here," he
turned and did so, with a crack like a whip, "the post is
definitely given, passed by our Inner Council."</p>

<p>"But you told me that you had killed Rose," Sibella repeated in
a voice colourless as her face, heavy as her weary lids, lifeless
as her dull black hair. "You said that you had struck harder than
you meant in your anger. And so, I thought, had I! Oh, so you let
me thinks had I!"</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't strike her, nor kill her. The man here has just
told you I didn't. He said truly enough, that the studio meetings
had nothing to do with the murder. That means I didn't kill her,
eh? My only reason for killing her would have been because of them.
<i>Cristo</i>! She deserved to die, but I did not do justice on
her," di Monti snarled.</p>

<p>"Justice! You to talk of justice, Giulio! What justice have I
had from you? When you told me that you had killed Rose, you killed
something in me, too. I'm not the woman to love a murderer, but at
least I could dream of what might have been if I hadn't sent you
there. You've taken even my dream from me now!"</p>

<p>Sibella finished in a sort of forlorn whisper. Di Monti made a
gesture towards her, but Pointer cut in, "And why did you tell the
police that Miss Charteris was afraid of some one or some thing?"
Pointer's voice was very cold and official. "She was. But of you.
You knew that her fears pointed to you, and you alone. Besides, it
does not necessarily follow that there was no other reason for
putting her out of the way than anger or jealousy." He turned to
Sibella, "Would you mind," he said gently, "telling me exactly what
happened that Thursday night?"</p>

<p>"Sibella!" the Italian began, but Pointer, who was watching him
closely, stepped between him and the girl.</p>

<p>"Don't forget that you're in Scotland Yard. Unless you want
handcuffs on, you'll stand back, Count di Monti."</p>

<p>The Italian looked murderous. Just for a second he hesitated.
Then, with a shrug of his shoulders, he sat down in the chair at
which the Chief Inspector was pointing, and crossing his legs, lit
a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Rose really was in love with Mr. Bellairs," Sibella began,
speaking as though she were glad to. "My father thought that he and
I would have suited each other better. There had been some boy and
girl affair between us, but that was all over long ago. After Count
di Monti came to England, Rose hesitated between the two. Finally
she decided to accept the count, but she wrote to Mr. Bellairs
still. And lately they met in his studio."</p>

<p>"Where he was painting her portrait?" asked Pointer.</p>

<p>"Yes I&mdash;I thought the whole position not fair&mdash;to any
of us. So I told Count di Monti on Thursday just before lunch what
was going on. Then I grew wretched. I realised, when I saw his
rage, what a fearful thing I had done. What an awful thing! And
though I knew that neither of them loved the other, I was afraid of
trouble. I knew that the count would never forgive her having
played with him&mdash;he prefers to do the playing!" She shot a
glance at the young man which was very reminiscent of her Italian
grandmother. "I didn't go to the concert in Medchester Thursday
evening. I drove on to Harry Bellairs' studio, getting there just
as my cousin scrambled out of the studio window. She heard the
count. At the front door. We drove home. Later, when I missed her
from her room, I thought that she must have gone back for some
reason. Next morning, when I heard that she was dead&mdash;oh, how
could you have let me suffer what I have!" she burst out again,
turning her burning eyes on di Monti.</p>

<p>"What time was it when you went to your cousin's room?" Pointer
asked.</p>

<p>"When I dropped her at home it was about ten o'clock. That must
have been when the maid spoke to her. I drove back to Medchester,
but I didn't go to the concert till practically the end. I needed
the fresh air to calm me down. When Mrs. Lane and I got back it was
a little past eleven."</p>

<p>"And you picked up that registered letter she had left behind
her&mdash;forgotten&mdash;to confront her with the proof that she
had been in the studio?" Pointer asked the Italian.</p>

<p>Count di Monti nodded curtly. "That and the pendant, as I said
in Verona." He turned to Sibella. "I would have told you the
truth&mdash;-" he began, but she stopped him with a hand raised as
though to ward off something distasteful, and finished his sentence
in her own way.</p>

<p>"Had you not wanted to make use of me, of my remorse, Of my
agony of mind! By a trick, you got my help, got away, and would
have gone to Jubaland without a word to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Altro! Tutt'altro</i>!" His face flamed. "Never! For a
while&mdash;yes. I had to let you bear your burden, but you knew
that whatever had happened to her she had richly deserved. She had
played with me!" He trembled visibly with fury at the thought
still. "But even if you mourned her, I would have made it all up to
you. All, and much, much more! I would have taken you&mdash;away
from all suffering&mdash;into a world all light, all gold, all
fire."</p>

<p>He repeated the sentence in his own beautiful tongue, "<i>Un
mundo di luce, d'oro, e di fuoco</i>." His voice made each word
shine and glow. He knelt before her and raised the hem of her black
lace frock to his lips. He kissed it passionately. She neither
swayed towards him nor away from him. Her eyes rested broodingly on
that proud, bent head. On her face was a gentle, and yet a very
remote look. It was as though she were hearing again a strain of
music which held memories of poignant joy and love in every note,
but the joy was a departed one, and the love was dead.</p>

<p>With a sigh she seemed to return to the present, and now there
was no softness about her. He rose on the instant, feeling the
change, rebuffed by it before she spoke. But he was a good fighter.
He did not give up.</p>

<p>"Do not draw away from me! Listen to your heart. Your heart that
does love me, say what you will. Let it plead for me. Love can
forgive everything but lack of love."</p>

<p>"It does not love you," Sibella said with convincing finality.
"I did love you, yes, but that was not why I helped you to escape
when I thought you had killed Rose. And you know that."</p>

<p>She took a step towards him at last, but it was as an
accuser.</p>

<p>"You knew that the only thing that would make me help you, was
the belief that it was I&mdash;I who was guilty of throwing fuel on
that jealousy of yours, that mad jealousy that burned without any
love back of it only pride!"</p>

<p>Pointer looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," he said, and the two started as though they had
been talking on the top of Mount Everest, and had no idea that
another human being could be within a mile of them, "but I must ask
you to leave us now, Miss Scarlett. I wanted you to know the facts
of the case&mdash;well, to know them&mdash;some of them." He
pressed a bell. A constable announced that a taxi was waiting for
the lady.</p>

<p>Sibella hesitated. She did not hold out her hand to the Chief
Inspector. Suddenly she realised what all this meant, what that
hand might be&mdash;in all likelihood was&mdash;about to do. It
came home to her that possibly it was the last time that she, or
any one else, would see Count di Monti a free man. He knew it. His
cigarette end fell, bitten through, to the carpet. He had risen
when she rose; and they looked at each other. Again their world
dropped away from them. He made a gesture, but Sibella stopped
him.</p>

<p>"I said good-bye to you, Giulio, when we parted before," she
spoke in a low broken voice, "there is no one I love left for me to
say it to now." Turning her head away with something like a
shudder, she passed swiftly from the room.</p>

<p>Di Monti was pale enough now. Tears stood in those fierce, cold
eyes. Eyes that looked as though they might have been handed down
from some Etruscan tyrant of old. He blinked them away,
straightened his straight back still more, smoothed a non-existent
belt, and faced Pointer.</p>

<p>"<i>Ebbene</i>?" he snapped, "but if it was that whelp Bellairs
who betrayed that I was at his studio"&mdash;he thrust his jaw
forward&mdash;"I told him that I would kill him if he dared speak
of my having been there, when heard that she had been found
dead&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pointer did not trouble to answer him.</p>

<p>"This way, if you please. There are still a few proofs to be
accumulated before the whole story is cleared up."</p>

<p>"And the handcuffs clicked on?" Di Monti threw back his head.
"Hardly on my wrists, my good man."</p>

<p>"The end is very close at hand, Count di Monti," Pointer
repeated quietly.</p>

<p>The Italian's face stiffened, as though he tightened all his
muscles, but without a word he stalked through the double door into
Pointer's second room, which again was almost filled by a big table
with chairs set close around it.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER ELEVEN</h2>

<p class="first">POINTER followed hard on di Monti's heels.
Everybody summoned was present.</p>

<p>The Italian, after a derisive glance at Bellairs, who stared
back at him like an angry cat, sat down at the place where his name
lay.</p>

<p>Thornton alone seemed to have drunk from some fountain of youth
since the previous meeting, though he shot a reproachful glance at
the Chief Inspector.</p>

<p>As for Bond and Cockburn, they watched the proceedings with rapt
attention again.</p>

<p>The colonel, looking ten years older, sat a little to one side,
almost by himself. It was to him that Pointer first spoke.</p>

<p>"While the inspector is getting the mixture just right, I should
like a word with you, sir. Kindly step this way." Pointer's tone
was very frigid. Superintendent Harris and Inspector Rodman stared
inscrutably at the inkstand before them. There had been something
very official in Pointer's manner.</p>

<p>"By jove!" Bond muttered under his breath.</p>

<p>"Just so!" Cockburn replied. Di Monti bit his lip. Bellairs
started to speak, then checked himself. Thornton took off his
glasses and rubbed his eyes. Pointer led his captive&mdash;for
Scarlett was practically that&mdash;into the farthest room.</p>

<p>"Now, sir, we may not know yet who killed Miss Rose, but we do
know who did not. Among those who did <i>not</i> kill her, is your
son, the commissioner. Mr. Reginald Scarlett had no more to do with
his cousin's death than I."</p>

<p>Colonel Scarlett went red, then white, then a blotched red
again. His features twitched.</p>

<p>"I suggest a whisky and soda," Pointer continued cheerily,
placing them before the colonel, "while you're helping yourself,
sir, I'll get to business. First of all, I'll tell you what we
know, and then I'll ask a little further information. If I'm wrong
on any point, please correct me as we go along."</p>

<p>The colonel sat silent, breathing fast.</p>

<p>"Your son, the Commissioner of Uganda, had a motor accident
nearly three months ago now. That accident, coming on top of a bad
head wound got in the war, brought on epileptic seizures. The
Government, anxious to keep him if possible, sent him home secretly
on sick leave, while he was given out as exploring around
Tanganyika. I may say, that false report threw us off the track
completely for a while. It was thought safer to leave you out of
it, so Professor Charteris went to meet your son at Marseilles,
putting his journey forward a couple of weeks. He travelled on with
him to Genoa, where the commissioner was to undergo a sun cure at a
helium establishment outside the town. He went there under his
middle name of Sayce, and once, when an introduction was absolutely
necessary, the professor introduced him by that name. The
commissioner found that the sun cure, at Hotel Quisisana made him
worse. He left suddenly on the Tuesday of the week in which his
cousin was found dead. The doctors at Quisisana wired to a friend
of yours in town, Sir Henry Carew, who was evidently in your
confidence."</p>

<p>"All but at the end," the colonel said huskily.</p>

<p>"Sir Henry got the cable Wednesday, and sent the message down to
you in a letter by his car. The Genoese doctors cabled&mdash;we had
a copy, which is now destroyed&mdash;that they feared lest the
young man who had left them before his cure had hardly begun,
should develop homicidal tendencies."</p>

<p>The colonel nodded. He could not trust himself to speak of that
awful cable even yet.</p>

<p>"He had told me that he didn't write to you. I talked with him
yesterday in the nursing home, which he leaves to-morrow, as fit as
ever. He says he felt too miserable to write to any one. I take it
that you, here at home, were on the alert?"</p>

<p>"We took turns, Carew and I, watching for him at night. That was
how I could play bridge on Thursday. Sir Henry was patrolling all
the roads around Stillwater House till midnight. Then I took over.
On the Wednesday we had reversed the hours."</p>

<p>"Yes, I thought that was about it." Pointer nodded to himself.
"The commissioner got out at Barnet station on Thursday about ten;
he was not recognised or noticed, and walked to Stillwater, hoping
that the exercise would do him good. He must have got in
unnoticed."</p>

<p>The colonel nodded. "If my son came across by Green Tree Farm,
he would have been able to slip in through the orchard."</p>

<p>"He made for the summer house," Pointer went on, "and lay down
in one of the bedrooms there, after finding that you were not in
your study. There he fell asleep. What sound it was that woke him,
he says he doesn't know, but it brought him up all standing, with a
feeling that there was something wrong. And something wrong there
was! It must have been his cousin's body that he heard striking the
flags below his window."</p>

<p>The colonel drew in his breath with a hiss.</p>

<p>"He heard no cry," Pointer went on quickly, for the other was
labouring under an almost intolerable strain, "but only the sound
of steps running down from the top of the look-out."</p>

<p>"Thank God!" murmured the soldier, covering his face with his
hands for a moment. "But then&mdash;however, that's for later. He
heard no cry, you say? Thank God for that, too!"</p>

<p>"It was an instantaneous death, if ever there was one," Pointer
assured him. "Your son opened his window, but the sky was overcast.
He saw something rush past, below, bent double like a wild animal.
And a wild, savage animal it was, true enough. He would have gone
out to investigate, but just then came the sound of all your
voices, as you went out after that shot."</p>

<p>"And I still don't understand that shot!" burst out
Scarlett.</p>

<p>"Patience just a bit longer, sir. Being so ill, and weary after
his walk, the commissioner lay down and fell asleep again at once.
When he awoke the second time, it was half-past twelve. He
remembered the steps running down the outside stairs, and the
sudden rush past below. Curiosity, mingled with an odd sense of
unease, he says, made him go out on to the flags. He stumbled
headlong over Miss Charteris's body lying in a little pool of blood
from the wound in her head where it had struck the edge of a
flower-pot. That frightful shock brought on an attack. I confess
when I think of some of the fancies those broken flower-pots gave
rise to in my mind&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pointer shook his head. Then he went on, "You found him,
colonel? How?"</p>

<p>"I heard him. Heard the noise he made. Don't ask me to describe
the scene. I rushed into the dining-room for brandy. I wasn't sure
that nothing could be done for Rose. That'll tell you how rattled I
was! Mrs. Lane was awake and downstairs. She came to see if she
could help. God bless that woman. I can't begin to tell what she
was to me that night. It wasn't only what she did, but how she did
it. She tried to bring Rose round, but by that time I had got my
second wind. I knew a broken neck for what it was. Not only was
Rose dead, but she had been dead a couple of hours or so when I
found her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What time?"</p>

<p>"Midnight almost exactly. I lifted Reggie into the summer house.
He was unconscious, but I tied him up, in case he should come
around before I had settled what to do."</p>

<p>"What did you tie him with?"</p>

<p>Scarlett had to think a moment.</p>

<p>"I went to my study for some rope I had there, but I had given
it to the count. I had more of the same kind downstairs,
however."</p>

<p>"Around some cases of Indian chutney?"</p>

<p>Scarlett nodded. He looked surprised.</p>

<p>"Then we put my poor niece's hat that we got from her bedroom on
her head, as though she had been out, and added her sketching box.
I cut away a strip of green paint on the back of her dress, and
teased the place to make it look as though torn. Then," he gnawed
his moustache for a moment, "then we rolled the poor girl up in my
travelling rug, tied it top and bottom with the rest of the cord,
lifted it on to a sort of carrier that happened to be standing on
the flags, and Mrs. Lane put on Rose's shoes and walked down to the
sand-pit behind me. Anything was better than having what we thought
the truth suspected. Anything!"</p>

<p>"What dress did Mrs. Lane wear?"</p>

<p>"She had on a light dressing-gown when I saw her first. She
changed it for something dark lying on the hall table&mdash;I don't
know what, nor whose. She thought the stains wouldn't show on it.
By the way,<i>I</i> wheeled Rose to the sand-pit. <i>I</i>
suggested the place. Mrs. Lane did nothing but carry out my
suggestions. Nothing whatever, Chief Inspector."</p>

<p>"Why did she take that fearful risk? I can see why you, sir,
thinking your son had killed his cousin in a seizure, took it, but
Mrs. Lane?"</p>

<p>The colonel did not reply for a moment. "Is this
confidential?"</p>

<p>"About Mrs. Lane? Absolutely!"</p>

<p>"It will surprise you to learn that Mrs. Lane is really Mrs.
Thornton. Her father was an old Eton chum of mine. She left
Thornton for some woman's whim of his having married her for her
money. I came on her later as a half-starved waitress in a
bun-shop. Mrs. Lane is a proud woman. Thornton had been poor in
those days and she rich. Now the position was reversed, she would
have starved, or gone out altogether, rather than turn to him. But
when I offered her the post of my lady-housekeeper she took it. I
hoped it might bring them together again. For a time I thought it
was no good, but I heard to-day from him that they're off for a
year's cruise together next week. Mrs. Lane, to call her by her
name in my house, has that rarest gift on earth&mdash;a grateful
heart. She felt that she owed me something for giving her a post
where she could keep in touch with her husband, and try to get him
back. Not that I ever saw her try."</p>

<p>"I know," broke in Pointer, with his eye on the clock behind the
other, "I thought that gratitude must be the key. Well, sir, you
lifted the body on to the truck, and wheeled it to the sand-pit.
Mrs. Lane walking behind, and helping to steer. You backed it under
the trees of the copse, and carried the body down by the back
shelving way, and left it in the pit?"</p>

<p>The colonel breathed hard</p>

<p>"God forgive me, yes. Horrible! But it seemed necessary. Mrs.
Lane knelt and said a prayer before we left. Then we walked back by
the main road. I wheeled the carrier to close behind the garage.
Mrs. Lane crumpled up Rose's bed. Then we took my son, and the rug
we had used for Rose, away in Thornton's big car, which Mrs. Lane
got him to lend her without asking the reason. My own was too
difficult to get out, with Wilkins sleeping overhead, and too
noisy. Mrs. Lane blurred over the tracks we made in the lane in a
little two-seater afterwards. We drove to a Doctor Bodley, who had
suggested the Genoa sun cure and knew the whole story. He rang up
Sir Martin Martineau's home, and arranged matters so that nothing
should leak out. My boy's whole future was at stake. At least, we
thought nothing had leaked out, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It didn't <i>leak</i> out! We only learnt what we know as the
result of quite a bit of&mdash;eh&mdash;routine work," Pointer
assured him.</p>

<p>"He had an operation," the colonel continued. "The surgeons
found a splinter of steel from that old shell wound pressing on the
brain. The motor accident had only aggravated it. He's as right as
rain now, with no more chance of any trouble of that kind. But you
know all this. You know the whole story. According to you, I shan't
have to break his heart by telling him that he&mdash;" suddenly
Colonel Scarlett's eyes fairly seemed to turn to glass. "There's no
mistake?" he asked in a croaking, harsh voice. "There isn't a catch
somewhere? You <i>know</i> Reggie is innocent?"</p>

<p>Pointer nodded. "I do, sir."</p>

<p>The colonel relaxed again. He sank back into his chair and drew
a couple if deep breaths. That had been an awful moment just now,
when he had wondered if this were a police trap.</p>

<p>"But who was the murderer? Who was it? Of course I know it was
no tramp&mdash;but, for God's sake, who did it? Not&mdash;not the
count?"</p>

<p>Pointer did not reply.</p>

<p>"And afterwards, sir?"</p>

<p>"We got back before any one was up, and spent the time making
sure, as we thought, that no traces had been left. As early as I
dared, I cut down the branches of the tree below the outlook where
my poor niece had gone crashing through. They were badly broken. I
gave out that I had had an accident with the ladder, but that no
one was to do anything to the place until further orders."</p>

<p>There was a short silence.</p>

<p>"The difficulty will be," Pointer said slowly, and studying his
boot-tips as though they might have a word to say on the subject,
too, "the difficulty will be, how to keep all this part of it out
of the trial. I don't mind telling you that the criminal is going
to be arrested shortly. But about this moving of the body from the
summer house&mdash;the chief commissioner thinks with me that we
had better deny all knowledge of that. It's up to the murderer to
prove who did shift the dead girl. It won't alter the verdict one
way or another. I think I can go bail, that, without the help of
Scotland Yard, no one will be able to get at the truth. So silence
on your part, sir, is the best thing."</p>

<p>The colonel agreed forcefully.</p>

<p>"And now, sir, I'm sorry to tell you that Professor Charteris
has met with an accident while in the Dolomites. The exact
explanation comes into my fuller report, but I think you should
know at once that you brother-in-law is dead."</p>

<p>The colonel was deeply shocked. He had had a hard time lately,
and he was very fond of the professor.</p>

<p>"Climbing accident, I suppose," he muttered after some minutes,
"and there, too&mdash;when he didn't turn up. I wondered if my poor
son&mdash;that cable of the Genoese doctors terrified me, Pointer,
as I've never been terrified before. You do hear of such things
when it's a question of homicidal mania. That was why I had some
Italian papers sent to me&mdash;to learn if&mdash;if&mdash;he
stopped&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You took the letter of the professor's to his daughter that
accompanied the enclosure, didn't you, sir?" Pointer prompted
again.</p>

<p>"Yes. It was in Italian. I was nervy that nothing should leak
out about Genoa. The professor has&mdash;had&mdash;the kindest
heart in the world, but he was a dreadful chap to let things slip
out. And Rose had a way of leaving her letters around. The word
Genoa hit me in the eye. And I took it till I could have some one
skim through it, and tell me if it were safe. I meant to get Sir
Henry to just run it through for me, but he wasn't in. Then Mrs.
Lane suggested that she could do it. She bought a dictionary in
Medchester and worked it out on Thursday night in a restaurant near
by. She only slipped into the concert hall at the very end. Of
course, we intended to return the letter to my niece at once that
was why the hurry&mdash;if there was nothing about my son in it.
But next morning&mdash;I'm afraid I don't know what's become of
that letter. Mrs. Lane doesn't remember what she did with it
either&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And Miss Charteris's papers&mdash;you didn't take them, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"Take them? Surely the police took them. I went through them
first, I confess, to see if any of my son's letters were there. He
was a bit in love with my niece. That's why I pressed for the di
Monti engagement before Reggie should come home on sick leave,
before matters got so bad with his head that he had to go to that
'cure'. I didn't want a marriage between them. Cousins. Apart
from&mdash;well, many things. I knew Bellairs wasn't a marrying
man. But one thing did strike me, Pointer. There wasn't a line of
her father's among her papers. I had put all his letters to me in
my safe in the city when I went up to town that Friday, just in
case of any reference to my son, but what became of his to her. I
can't imagine."</p>

<p>Pointer could. He knew. He rose to his feet now.</p>

<p>"And Lady Maxwell? Why did you act the day of the funeral as
though you&mdash;well&mdash;were disturbed by her presence?"</p>

<p>Colonel Scarlett flushed.</p>

<p>"Between ourselves, if a woman could marry a man against his
will, I should be a re-married man. See?"</p>

<p>Pointer saw.</p>

<p>"Also I wasn't sure that she had heard or seen nothing that
Thursday night."</p>

<p>"And Miss Scarlett, does she know?"</p>

<p>"Trust a mere girl with facts that could ruin her brother's
whole future? My dear fellow, Sibella couldn't keep a secret to
save her life! My only terror was lest she should guess, or had
guessed, something of the truth. I was afraid she had. I suppose I
can't ask how in the world you found it all out?"</p>

<p>"Just routine work, sir. I went wildly astray about those broken
flower pots at first. You would have done much better to've
confided in us from the start, though I will acknowledge that in
this case the position was difficult for you."</p>

<p>"Difficult? It was damnable. But I still don't see how you got
on to my son's presence in Europe, when the Nairobi papers reported
his progress week by week around Mombassa."</p>

<p>"It was something I heard in town, after I got on the track of a
man having been taken to the nursing home."</p>

<p>And the colonel never knew that it was the kiss that he had
given Mrs. Lane which had first opened Pointer's eyes to the true,
the only possible explanation.</p>

<p>A man does not kiss a woman with whom he is not in love, and
Pointer was certain that there neither was, nor ever had been, any
love between the colonel and his lady-housekeeper, because a man
whom one, or both, has badly injured is safely in a nursing home.
Gratitude alone, he thought, could explain that little scene. A
sudden burst of gratitude for loyal help. Scarlett had no male
relatives but his son. Granted it could be that son, which it
apparently could not be, then all became coherent. The operation
suggested brain trouble. That suggested some epileptic-like
seizure, which explained the singular way the plants were broken,
the lashing of arms and legs on the stone flags. Pointer attacked
the apparent proof of the commissioner's presence in Uganda. Found
he could pierce it, and had the facts worried out for him while he
was in Italy. He had read the report in Paris. Now the last lap was
in sight Pointer's heart beat quicker as he entered the middle
room. The business of taking the imprints of each man's fists was
done exactly as on the first day, except that there was no accident
this time. The typewriters of the constables in the outer room
drowned all possibility of talking, until Pointer sent out word,
asking them to defer, their activities until later in the day. The
two commissioners came in as they were finishing.</p>

<p>"They look excellently taken. How soon can you pour in the
plaster?" the Assistant Commissioner asked. "This ought to help
forward the case."</p>

<p>"It will settle it, sir," Pointer said quietly.</p>

<p>The Chief Commissioner affected surprise. As for the men, who
were just preparing to leave, they started as though each had been
shot.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Pointer repeated, "this will end the case."</p>

<p>"Suppose you tell us just how we stand at present," suggested
the Commissioner. "Let's all sit down again and hear it."</p>

<p>Every one sat.</p>

<p>Watts, too, took a seat, after putting the plates on one side.
He chose a chair in the centre of the doorway, and quietly locked
the door. He had a civilian assistant this time, who bore the not
uncommon name of O'Connor.</p>

<p>"The details'll come out later, sir," Pointer began, "but as we
are at present, this is how the case runs. Miss Charteris had an
engagement that Thursday evening with Mr. Bellairs in his studio.
He was painting her portrait. Count di Monti had learnt of her
visits, and arrived on the scene. Miss Charteris had been fetched
by a friend, but the count and Mr. Bellairs quarrelled over
her."</p>

<p>Both men looked as though they would like to break in, but
Pointer's impassive, eye held them, while he passed on.</p>

<p>"The count, as an additional proof of her presence, took away a
letter that Miss Charteris had left behind her by accident. It was
the enclosure that her father had sent her in her letter of the
afternoon. When Count di Monti learnt of the 'accident', as it was
called, to her, he at once handed this letter to a friend's brother
who was starting that same Friday morning for Italy. It was posted
back from Milan to the professor's club. Miss Charteris missed it
at once when she returned to her room, and went to the top of the
summer house to speak to you about it, Mr. Bellairs. She had asked
you to meet her there as soon as you could come. Evidently ten was
the hour one or other of you set. I take it she had asked you to
let her know how things had gone between you and Count di Monti.
She was sure you would quarrel. You decided not to go."</p>

<p>A chuckle came from di Monti.</p>

<p>"I decided for him."</p>

<p>"Had you gone," Pointer still spoke to the artist, "you might
have postponed, but you would not have changed the end. The
murderer caught sight of her standing alone under the light of the
electric lantern up above. He thought that she was there to hand on
the enclosure. He switched off the light, ran up the stairs,
possibly made some comment about the lamp being out of order, and
then as she leant back, perhaps to look at it, an arm was thrust
under her knees, and she was flung full force backwards on to the
flags below, breaking her neck as she struck them, and cutting her
head on a flower pot."</p>

<p>There was one collective gasp from the room.</p>

<p>"As far as we know, she didn't even cry out. Had she done so,
and had it been heard, he would have been the first to shout for
help, we may be sure, and rush down to see if anything could be
done for her. But he would have taken her silver chain bag just the
same. Either from the top, where she had dropped it, or from beside
her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The bag?" Scarlett said in a dazed voice</p>

<p>"The bag which had held the enclosed letter. Miss Charteris was
murdered for the sake of something which, her father was believed,
quite erroneously, to have sent her. And now I am sorry to say I
have to tell you about another death. Professor Charteris was
murdered, too. He was killed in Northern Italy, for the same reason
that cost his daughter her life By sheer accident he was present
when a so-called Bulgarian traveller was killed. But the man was
not a Bulgarian. He was Neumann, the great secret leader of the
Soviet spy system. On him was a paper in cipher giving the names of
all the chief Bolshevik agents in Europe. As a matter of fact, the
professor never saw that paper, or knew of its existence. But the
men with Neumann knew that he had helped their friend into the
hospital, saw him reading a similar slip of paper on the hospital
steps, followed him, and killed him in a lonely valley, where they
could rifle his pockets. In his letter-case they found the receipt
for a registered letter sent off immediately after his visit to the
hospital."</p>

<p>So still was the room that the ticking of the watch which each
man wore could be heard.</p>

<p>"But to go back to Miss Charteris's murderer. He had received
news that a paper had been sent her which must at all costs be
intercepted, and at once. If she had read it, she, too, was to be
killed. The professor, being one of the finest cipher readers in
the world, might very likely have written her the real names which
were hidden in that apparent Russian poem. I think the murderer
asked her about that letter before he flung her over. Miss
Charteris, very much upset by the evening's events, as we know from
her maid, forgot, I think, that she had taken it out, and spoke of
it as still there. In any case, he jumped to the conclusion that it
was there, and that she had read it. Now, he has the bag, the girl
is dead, but he has no letter. He feels sure, however, from what
she had said, that nothing had been done with it. It will be in her
room, and he must get it later. He notices, for the first time,
that when he stooped far over the rail to watch her fall, he
smeared green paint on the inside of each hand. Not enough to show
when close, perhaps, but enough to have some very awkward questions
asked, should her body be discovered at once, as it may be. When we
saw the smudges left by the two hand-grips on that painted rail,"
Pointer identified himself with Harris and Rodman by a glance, "we
realised that the murderer must have had some way of getting the
marks off. Water wouldn't touch them, nor would mere wiping do. He
could neither take the time to thoroughly clean his hands then, nor
chance its not being noticed. He had to return immediately and go
on with the game, or risk comment. Yes," in answer to the distended
eyes fixed on him, "the murder was committed by 'dummy' in the few
minutes during which a hand was being played at bridge that
Thursday evening. That was why that shot was trumped up, and a
false alarm given&mdash;"</p>

<p>And then the Assistant Commissioner jumped. He stumbled over
some one's legs, the table was between him and his object, but he
grappled fiercely for a second. But with a laugh which was like a
neigh, Cockburn got the hand with the ring he wore to his mouth,
and bit off the small black pearl. It cracked like a glass phial
between his teeth.</p>

<p>"Too late, Pelham, and there's no power on earth can stop or
alter the stuff I've taken. Surely you never thought you could hang
me!"</p>

<p>The Assistant Commissioner took it hard. His face worked
silently. As for Pointer, he had sprung to his feet, too, with
Harris and Rodman. The Chief Inspector rapped out an oath as the
apparent pearl crunched, and that was something no one there had
ever heard him do before. Now he sat down with the bitter look of a
man who sees the best part of what he has worked for torn from
him.</p>

<p>He made a visible effort to be calm, however, and turned to
Cockburn.</p>

<p>"I must caution you that anything&mdash;"</p>

<p>Cockburn rocked in ghastly merriment. "My good fellow, you don't
understand. What do you suppose I had in this little pearl of mine?
This mourning ring I've taken to wearing lately? Something for a
headache? In an hour from now, to the minute, I shall fall asleep,
and nothing you can do or try to do, will prevent me from drifting
painlessly into oblivion. That being so, I'm quite ready to oblige
with any information&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I caution you that it may be used against you."</p>

<p>"You do, oh most excellent policeman!" mocked Cockburn.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bond came to life. With a slack jaw and a whitening
face he had been staring as if numbed by what had happened.</p>

<p>"Those Polish papers," he suddenly turned on the man beside him,
"I ought to've guessed when I caught you with them! Give me his
keys somebody; I wouldn't touch him with a barge-pole, and his
confederates may have them already in their hands."</p>

<p>Snatching the keys from Watts, Bond fairly raced from the room.
Watts relocked the door behind him.</p>

<p>"Dear me," Cockburn yawned, "Bond always is impetuous. And now,
Pointer, would you like me to help you out? I'm afraid the
cipher&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was read at the Yard an hour after I got it safely home. But
we knew it was you very early in the case. Who but you raised that
cry of a rifle shot and spoke of poachers. Then changed it to a
revolver shot when Miss Charteris's death was no longer looked on
as an accideneny. Then once more, to twist the case still again to
serve ends, as you thought, you changed it to the sound of burst
tyre from Count di Monti's car. That sally-out all together gave
you the chance you needed that night. This chance of cleaning your
hands with petrol at the garage after rubbing them well into the
earth, and on all the grass of the hedge banks. Even if a smear
remained, it would be set down to the hunt in the dark. The leaves
in Miss Charteris's hand showed that she was killed before it came
on to rain. That fitted the time all right when you were in the
garden. You egged Mr. Bond on to break into Stillwater House with
you on the plea of looking for more of that cord which you had seen
given to the count. What you wanted were Professor Charteris's
letters. All of them. You had let yourself into Miss Rose's empty
rooms that same Thursday night after you murdered her, and taken
all the papers you could find which were in the Professor's
writing. But the paper you thought he had sent her, the enclosure
you had seen pulled out at the tea table, wasn't among them. So you
had that tool of the Bolsheviks, Rebecca Apfelbaum, hunt for it in
the Professor's rooms next morning on the chance that Miss
Charteris had run up to town with it on Thursday evening after
dinner. You got all her papers next evening, to make trebly sure,
when you stepped in for a chat with the chief constable after
dinner&mdash;to ask how he was getting on."</p>

<p>Cockburn turned on him. "So you set me on to ferreting out about
di Monti's alibi being rotten, while you knew the truth all the
time? I wish I'd guessed that&mdash;then." There was a sudden glint
in the shallow, shifting colour of Cockburn's eyes like a mad
dog's.</p>

<p>"It kept you from suspecting that we did know the truth,"
Pointer answered coldly.</p>

<p>"I spoofed you that night at Stillwater, anyway," Cockburn
jeered, "whatever you may have found out later."</p>

<p>"Not a bit. I should have suspected you by that alone, if I
hadn't done so already, from what Mr. Thornton told me of the alarm
that no one else heard. Within an hour I had that little oil can of
yours from the tools in your car. It held just the same oil as that
with which Miss Charteris's door had been treated. Some Russian
blend, I suppose. Anyway, we can't match it in England. Your
bedroom door at Red Gates and her doors alone show it. A bad break
that. You meant to kill her in her room that night&mdash;strangle
her, I think&mdash;if no earlier chance came.</p>

<p>"And as for that matchbox, which would let you seem to prove
where you hadn't been standing, when you strolled around the
grounds as dummy&mdash;you dropped that Friday morning while
walking about after breakfast with Mr. Thornton and Mr. Bond. It
fell bottom side up. I found it quite dry, though the pattern on it
would have held the slightest drop of rain. It was obviously
dropped after that downpour, and when you knew about the sandpit.
By bad luck, too, it had fallen on a starling's tracks made that
morning earlier when he had been hunting for breakfast. Oh, we've
been watching you for some time, but it was the lack of motive that
we wanted to get hold of, and any possible accomplices. You had
none. And as to the motive&mdash;that was supplied by finding your
name on the cipher list as the British agent for distribution of
Bolshevik funds. We've been hunting that agent for years. There's
nothing this man can tell us, sir."</p>

<p>Pointer turned to the Assistant Commissioner. Cockburn broke in
sharply.</p>

<p>"Not so fast, please. How am I supposed to have moved the body
of Miss Charteris from the summer house? Forgive my curiosity, but
as I shall not be able to learn the truth of that interesting, and
I confess baffling, fact at the trial&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pointer looked bored.</p>

<p>"You had your arrangements made, I take it."</p>

<p>"I?" Cockburn stiffened. "I've just told you that knew nothing
about it, and would like to hear the explanation. It was the
count's doing, I'll swear, though why&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's not the question," Pointer went on carelessly. "It's the
motive for the crime that concerns us, not why she was moved when
dead."</p>

<p>He turned again to the Commissioner for a moment, then back
again to Cockburn.</p>

<p>"As I say, sir, we have the motive now. It was just sheer greed.
Wanting more money. The love of secret power. Mr. Bond was getting
into your debt. In time you intended to wring a very full payment
out of him. I think he may be thankful indeed we caught you before
that. As to your hostility to Count di Monti&mdash;that, course, is
due to the count's anti-Communist activities. You sent him,
however, a warning letter that I was coming to Italy to arrest him,
in the hope that something would happen to me. You thought it might
be as well to choke off the C.I.D. for a time."</p>

<p>"I was right. You have blundered on the truth," Cockburn said
arrogantly. His gentle, pleasant mask was off now. It could no
longer serve him.</p>

<p>"The only blunder in this story was the needless, useless murder
down at Stillwater. I hope you realise that truth now. Had Miss
Charteris not been killed, that letter-case with the incriminating
letter in it would have been sent back to Sofia by the doctor, or
the sister-in-charge, unread, unguessed at even."</p>

<p>"Miss Charteris misled me by her manner when I spoke to her in
the summer house," Cockburn said sombrely. "She misled me
completely, or this blunder, as you call it, would never have
happened. I certainly have cause to regret it. But she spoke so
wildly. I do not consider myself dull-witted, but I had to decide
quickly for the best. I made sure she had received the de-coded
list and had read it. So unfortunately&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pointer nodded to Harris, who clicked on the handcuffs with a
quite unprofessional gleam of pleasure in his eyes. Cockburn glared
around the room.</p>

<p>"So you won't spare me this last indignity? You want me to die
in your beastly irons? But I've tricked you. In an hour I'm away
from all this."</p>

<p>Harris propelled him, none too gently, to the door. They heard
Cockburn's snarled injunction to him to keep his hands off a
gentleman as it closed.</p>

<p>Di Monti was the first to throw off the spell, and rose to his
feet.</p>

<p>"Do I understand that the game that has been played with me is
now over?" he asked very politely. His voice was ice over a
volcano.</p>

<p>"This wasn't some idea of getting even with you, Count di Monti.
It was vitally necessary that Mr. Cockburn shouldn't suspect we
suspected him. At the F.O. he could have laid his hands on any
passport he liked. He was shadowed closely from the first by
Inspector Watts, and relays of men from private investigation
bureaus. And what about attempted murder?" Pointer spoke
temperately but with inward warmth. "Think yourself lucky to have
got off with no worse than a warning."</p>

<p>"Lucky!" Di Monti tossed him the word back contemptuously.
"Lucky! In death, as in life, she brought me bad luck."</p>

<p>"You deserve a stiff term of imprisonment, Count di Monti,"
Pointer began tying up some papers before him "but though I'm a
policeman, and say it, I think every man's punishment lies waiting
for him, whether he get it by law or not."</p>

<p>It was almost as though Pointer could read the near future,
could see a blazing plane crash, could watch the charred body of
the airman lifted out on to hot Tunisian sand, and know it for what
it was&mdash;di Monti's.</p>

<p>Without another glance at the room, the Italian stalked out.
O'Connor closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>The Assistant Commissioner had paid no heed to the little
scene.</p>

<p>"Yes, Cockburn's tricked us," he muttered in anguish after the
others, still silent under the spell of what they had heard, had
gone.</p>

<p>"He's done us, right enough, at the end. He'll die a nice, quiet
death before the hour's over. Why the devil didn't you keep your
feet under you, Pointer? It's not like you, of all men!"</p>

<p>"It's not as bad as you think, sir," Pointer interrupted
tranquilly. "We noticed that Mr. Cockburn began wearing a ring just
after Miss Charteris's death, so naturally, as a matter of routine,
we had it examined that first time the casts of the hands were
taken."</p>

<p>He did not explain that that was the sole reason for that
performance. Even superiors need not know everything until the last
day.</p>

<p>"The room was so tight, that the rings were put on that ledge
behind there. A sliding panel had been cut in the back, and to-day,
while the typewriters in the outer room clicked like hall-stones on
a tin roof, the pearl that we had made was substituted for the
other. Mr. Cockburn swallowed a small black ball of properly
prepared flavoured soap enclosed in glass. When he discovers the
truth, I shouldn't wonder if there was quite a storm scene."</p>

<p>And there was.</p>
