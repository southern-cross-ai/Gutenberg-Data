  <h2><a id="chap1"
     name="chap1">CHAPTER 1</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was characteristic of the two that when the uproar broke
  out Vance Cornish raised his eyes, but went on lighting his pipe. Then his
  sister Elizabeth ran to the window with a swish of skirts around her long
  legs. After the first shot there was a lull. The little cattle town was as
  peaceful as ever with its storm-shaken houses staggering away down the
  street.</p>

  <p>A boy was stirring up the dust of the street, enjoying its heat with his
  bare toes, and the same old man was bunched in his chair in front of the
  store. During the two days Elizabeth had been in town on her cattle-buying
  trip, she had never see him alter his position. But she was accustomed to the
  West, and this advent of sleep in the town did not satisfy her. A drowsy
  town, like a drowsy-looking cow-puncher, might be capable of unexpected
  things.</p>

  <p>"Vance," she said, "there's trouble starting."</p>

  <p>"Somebody shooting at a target," he answered.</p>

  <p>As if to mock him, he had no sooner spoken than a dozen voices yelled down
  the street in a wailing chorus cut short by the rapid chattering of
  revolvers. Vance ran to the window. Just below the hotel the street made an
  elbow-turn for no particular reason except that the original cattle-trail had
  made exactly the same turn before Garrison City was built. Toward the corner
  ran the hubbub at the pace of a running horse. Shouts, shrill, trailing
  curses, and the muffled beat of hoofs in the dust. A rider plunged into view
  now, his horse leaning far in to take the sharp angle, and the dust skidding
  out and away from his sliding hoofs. The rider gave easily and gracefully to
  the wrench of his mount.</p>

  <p>And he seemed to have a perfect trust in his horse, for he rode with the
  reins hanging over the horns of his saddle. His hands were occupied by a pair
  of revolvers, and he was turned in the saddle.</p>

  <p>The head of the pursuing crowd lurched around the elbow-turn; fire spat
  twice from the mouth of each gun. Two men dropped, one rolling over and over
  in the dust, and the other sitting down and clasping his leg in a ludicrous
  fashion. But the crowd was checked and fell back.</p>

  <p>By this time the racing horse of the fugitive had carried him close to the
  hotel, and now he faced the front, a handsome fellow with long black hair
  blowing about his face. He wore a black silk shirt which accentuated the
  pallor of his face and the flaring crimson of his bandanna. And he laughed
  joyously, and the watchers from the hotel window heard him call: "Go it,
  Mary. Feed 'em dust, girl!"</p>

  <p>The pursuers had apparently realized that it was useless to chase. Another
  gust of revolver shots barked from the turning of the street, and among them
  a different and more sinister sound like the striking of two great hammers
  face on face, so that there was a cold ring of metal after the explosion
  &mdash;at least one man had brought a rifle to bear. Now, as the wild rider
  darted past the hotel, his hat was jerked from his head by an invisible hand.
  He whirled again in the saddle and his guns raised. As he turned, Elizabeth
  Cornish saw something glint across the street. It was the gleam of light on
  the barrel of a rifle that was thrust out through the window of the
  store.</p>

  <p>That long line of light wobbled, steadied, and fire jetted from the mouth
  of the gun. The black-haired rider spilled sidewise out of the saddle; his
  feet came clear of the stirrups, and his right leg caught on the cantle. He
  was flung rolling in the dust, his arms flying weirdly. The rifle disappeared
  from the window and a boy's set face looked out. But before the limp body of
  the fugitive had stopped rolling, Elizabeth Cornish dropped into a chair,
  sick of face. Her brother turned his back on the mob that closed over the
  dead man and looked at Elizabeth in alarm.</p>

  <p>It was not the first time he had seen the result of a gunplay, and for
  that matter it was not the first time for Elizabeth. Her emotion upset him
  more than the roar of a hundred guns. He managed to bring her a glass of
  water, but she brushed it away so that half of the contents spilled on the
  red carpet of the room.</p>

  <p>"He isn't dead, Vance. He isn't dead!" she kept saying.</p>

  <p>"Dead before he left the saddle," replied Vance, with his usual calm. "And
  if the bullet hadn't finished him, the fall would have broken his neck.
  But&mdash;what in the world! Did you know the fellow?"</p>

  <p>He blinked at her, his amazement growing. The capable hands of Elizabeth
  were pressed to her breast, and out of the thirty-five years of spinsterhood
  which had starved her face he became aware of eyes young and dark, and full
  of spirit; by no means the keen, quiet eyes of Elizabeth Cornish.</p>

  <p>"Do something," she cried. "Go down, and&mdash;if they've murdered him
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>He literally fled from the room.</p>

  <p>All the time she was seeing nothing, but she would never forget what she
  had seen, no matter how long she lived. Subconsciously she was fighting to
  keep the street voices out of her mind. They were saying things she did not
  wish to hear, things she would not hear. Finally, she recovered enough to
  stand up and shut the window. That brought her a terrible temptation to look
  down into the mass of men in the street&mdash;and women, too!</p>

  <p>But she resisted and looked up. The forms of the street remained obscurely
  in the bottom of her vision, and made her think of something she had seen in
  the woods&mdash;a colony of ants around a dead beetle. Presently the door
  opened and Vance came back. He still seemed very worried, but she forced
  herself to smile at him, and at once his concern disappeared; it was plain
  that he had been troubled about her and not in the slightest by the fate of
  the strange rider. She kept on smiling, but for the first time in her life
  she really looked at Vance without sisterly prejudice in his favor. She saw a
  good- natured face, handsome, with the cheeks growing a bit blocky, though
  Vance was only twenty-five. He had a glorious forehead and fine eyes, but one
  would never look twice at Vance in a crowd. She knew suddenly that her
  brother was simply a well-mannered mediocrity.</p>

  <p>"Thank the Lord you're yourself again, Elizabeth," her brother said first
  of all. "I thought for a moment&mdash;I don't know what!"</p>

  <p>"Just the shock, Vance," she said. Ordinarily she was well-nigh brutally
  frank. Now she found it easy to lie and keep on smiling. "It was such a
  horrible thing to see!"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so. Caught you off balance. But I never knew you to lose your
  grip so easily. Well, do you know what you've seen?"</p>

  <p>"He's dead, then?"</p>

  <p>He locked sharply at her. It seemed to him that a tremor of unevenness had
  come into her voice.</p>

  <p>"Oh, dead as a doornail, Elizabeth. Very neat shot. Youngster that dropped
  him; boy named Joe Minter. Six thousand dollars for Joe. Nice little nest egg
  to build a fortune on, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Six thousand dollars! What do you mean, Vance?"</p>

  <p>"The price on the head of Jack Hollis. That was Hollis, sis. The
  celebrated Black Jack."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;this is only a boy, Vance. He couldn't have been more than
  twenty-five years old."</p>

  <p>"That's all."</p>

  <p>"But I've heard of him for ten years, very nearly. And always as a man-
  killer. It can't be Black Jack."</p>

  <p>"I said the same thing, but it's Black Jack, well enough. He started out
  when he was sixteen, they say, and he's been raising the devil ever since.
  You should have seen them pick him up&mdash;as if he were asleep, and not
  dead. What a body! Lithe as a panther. No larger than I am, but they say he
  was a giant with his hands."</p>

  <p>He was lighting his cigarette as he said this, and consequently he did not
  see her eyes close tightly. A moment later she was able to make her
  expression as calm as ever.</p>

  <p>"Came into town to see his baby," went on Vance through the smoke. "Little
  year-old beggar!"</p>

  <p>"Think of the mother," murmured Elizabeth Cornish. "I want to do something
  for her."</p>

  <p>"You can't," replied her brother, with unnecessary brutality. "Because
  she's dead. A little after the youngster was born. I believe Black Jack broke
  her heart, and a very pleasant sort of girl she was, they tell me."</p>

  <p>"What will become of the baby?"</p>

  <p>"It will live and grow up," he said carelessly. "They always do, somehow.
  Make another like his father, I suppose. A few years of fame in the mountain
  saloons, and then a knife in the back."</p>

  <p>The meager body of Elizabeth stiffened. She was finding it less easy to
  maintain her nonchalant smile.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Why? Blood will out, like murder, sis."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! All a matter of environment."</p>

  <p>"Have you ever read the story of the Jukes family?"</p>

  <p>"An accident. Take a son out of the best family in the world and raise him
  like a thief&mdash;he'll be a thief. And the thief's son can be raised to an
  honest manhood. I know it!"</p>

  <p>She was seeing Black Jack, as he had raced down the street with the black
  hair blowing about his face. Of such stuff, she felt, the knights of another
  age had been made. Vance was raising a forefinger in an authoritative way he
  had.</p>

  <p>"My dear, before that baby is twenty-five&mdash;that was his father's
  age&mdash;he'll have shot a man. Bet you on it!"</p>

  <p>"I'll take your bet!"</p>

  <p>The retort came with such a ring of her voice that he was startled. Before
  he could recover, she went on: "Go out and get that baby for me, Vance. I
  want it."</p>

  <p>He tossed his cigarette out of the window.</p>

  <p>"Don't drop into one of your headstrong moods, sis. This is nonsense."</p>

  <p>"That's why I want to do it. I'm tired of playing the man. I've had enough
  to fill my mind. I want something to fill my arms and my heart."</p>

  <p>She drew up her hands with a peculiar gesture toward her shallow, barren
  bosom, and then her brother found himself silenced. At the same time he was a
  little irritated, for there was an imputation in her speech that she had been
  carrying the burden which his own shoulders should have supported. Which was
  so true that he could not answer, and therefore he cast about for some way of
  stinging her.</p>

  <p>"I thought you were going to escape the sentimental period, Elizabeth. But
  sooner or later I suppose a woman has to pass through it."</p>

  <p>A spot of color came in her sallow cheek.</p>

  <p>"That's sufficiently disagreeable, Vance."</p>

  <p>A sense of his cowardice made him rise to conceal his confusion.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to take you at your word, sis. I'm going out to get that baby.
  I suppose it can be bought&mdash;like a calf!"</p>

  <p>He went deliberately to the door and laid his hand on the knob. He had a
  rather vicious pleasure in calling her bluff, but to his amazement she did
  not call him back. He opened the door slowly. Still she did not speak. He
  slammed it behind him and stepped into the hall.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap2"
     name="chap2">CHAPTER 2</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Twenty-four years made the face of Vance Cornish a little
  better-fed, a little more blocky of cheek, but he remained astonishingly
  young. At forty-nine the lumpish promise of his youth was quite gone. He was
  in a trim and solid middle age. His hair was thinned above the forehead, but
  it gave him more dignity. On the whole, he left an impression of a man who
  has done things and who will do more before he is through.</p>

  <p>He shifted his feet from the top of the porch railing and shrugged himself
  deeper into his chair. It was marvelous how comfortable Vance could make
  himself. He had one great power&mdash;the ability to sit still through any
  given interval. Now he let his eye drift quietly over the Cornish ranch. It
  lay entirely within one grasp of the vision, spilling across the valley from
  Sleep Mountain, on the lower bosom of which the house stood, to Mount
  Discovery on the north. Not that the glance of Vance Cornish lurched across
  this bold distance. His gaze wandered as slowly as a bee buzzes across a
  clover field, not knowing on which blossom to settle.</p>

  <p>Below him, generously looped, Bear Creek tumbled out of the southeast, and
  roved between noble borders of silver spruce into the shadows of the Blue
  Mountains of the north, half a dozen miles across and ten long of grazing and
  farm land, rich, loamy bottom land scattered with aspens.</p>

  <p>Beyond, covering the gentle roll of the foothills, was grazing land.
  Scattering lodgepole pine began in the hills, and thickened into dense
  yellow- green thickets on the upper mountain slopes. And so north and north
  the eye of Vance Cornish wandered and climbed until it rested on the bald
  summit of Mount Discovery. It had its name out of its character, standing
  boldly to the south out of the jumble of the Blue Mountains.</p>

  <p>It was a solid unit, this Cornish ranch, fenced away with mountains,
  watered by a river, pleasantly forested, and obviously predestined for the
  ownership of one man. Vance Cornish, on the porch of the house, felt like an
  enthroned king overlooking his dominions. As a matter of fact, his holdings
  were hardly more than nominal.</p>

  <p>In the beginning his father had left the ranch equally to Vance and
  Elizabeth, thickly plastered with debts. The son would have sold the place
  for what they could clear. He went East to hunt for education and pleasure;
  his sister remained and fought the great battle by herself. She consecrated
  herself to the work, which implied that the work was sacred. And to her,
  indeed, it was.</p>

  <p>She was twenty-two and her brother twelve when their father died. Had she
  been a tithe younger and her brother a mature man, it would have been
  different. As it was, she felt herself placed in a maternal position with
  Vance. She sent him away to school, rolled up her sleeves and started to
  order chaos. In place of husband, children&mdash;love and the fruits of love
  &mdash;she accepted the ranch. The dam between the rapids and the waterfall
  was the child of her brain; the plowed fields of the central part of the
  valley were her reward.</p>

  <p>In ten years of constant struggle she cleared away the debts. And then,
  since Vance gave her nothing but bills to pay, she began to buy out his
  interest. He chose to learn his business lessons on Wall Street. Elizabeth
  paid the bills, but she checked the sums against his interest in the ranch.
  And so it went on. Vance would come out to the ranch at intervals and show a
  brief, feverish interest, plan a new set of irrigation canals, or a sawmill,
  or a better road out over the Blue Mountains. But he dropped such work
  half-done and went away.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth said nothing. She kept on paying his bills, and she kept on
  cutting down his interest in the old Cornish ranch, until at the present time
  he had only a finger-tip hold. Root and branch, the valley and all that was
  in it belonged to Elizabeth Cornish. She was proud of her possession, though
  she seldom talked of her pride. Nevertheless, Vance knew, and smiled. It was
  amusing, because, after all, what she had done, and all her work, would
  revert to him at her death. Until that time, why should he care in whose name
  the ranch remained so long as his bills were paid? He had not worked, but in
  recompense he had remained young. Elizabeth had labored all her youth away.
  At forty-nine he was ready to begin the most important part of his career. At
  sixty his sister was a withered old ghost of a woman.</p>

  <p>He fell into a pleasant reverie. When Elizabeth died, he would set in some
  tennis courts beside the house, buy some blooded horses, cut the road wide
  and deep to let the world come up Bear Creek Valley, and retire to the life
  of a country gentleman.</p>

  <p>His sister's voice cut into his musing. She had two tones. One might be
  called her social register. It was smooth, gentle&mdash;the low-pitched and
  controlled voice of a gentlewoman. The other voice was hard and sharp. It
  could drive hard and cold across a desk, and bring businessmen to an
  understanding that here was a mind, not a woman.</p>

  <p>At present she used her latter tone. Vance Cornish came into a shivering
  consciousness that she was sitting beside him. He turned his head slowly. It
  was always a shock to come out of one of his pleasant dreams and see that
  worn, hollow-eyed, impatient face.</p>

  <p>"Are you forty-nine, Vance?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not fifty, at least," he countered.</p>

  <p>She remained imperturbable, looking him over. He had come to notice that
  in the past half-dozen years his best smiles often failed to mellow her
  expression. He felt that something disagreeable was coming.</p>

  <p>"Why did Cornwall run away this morning? I hoped to take him on a
  trip."</p>

  <p>"He had business to do."</p>

  <p>His diversion had been a distinct failure, and had been turned against
  him. For she went on: "Which leads to what I have to say. You're going back
  to New York in a few days, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"No, my dear. I haven't been across the water for two years."</p>

  <p>"Paris?"</p>

  <p>"Brussels. A little less grace; a little more spirit."</p>

  <p>"Which means money."</p>

  <p>"A few thousand only. I'll be back by fall."</p>

  <p>"Do you know that you'll have to mortgage your future for that money,
  Vance?"</p>

  <p>He blinked at her, but maintained his smile under fire courageously.</p>

  <p>"Come, come! Things are booming. You told me yesterday what you'd clean up
  on the last bunch of Herefords."</p>

  <p>When she folded her hands, she was most dangerous, he knew. And now the
  bony fingers linked and she shrugged the shawl more closely around her
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"We're partners, aren't we?" smiled Vance.</p>

  <p>"Partners, yes. You have one share and I have a thousand. But&mdash;you
  don't want to sell out your final claim, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>His smile froze. "Eh?"</p>

  <p>"If you want to get those few thousands, Vance, you have nothing to put up
  for them except your last shreds of property. That's why I say you'll have to
  mortgage your future for money from now on."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;how does it all come about?"</p>

  <p>"I've warned you. I've been warning you for twenty-five years, Vance."</p>

  <p>Once again he attempted to turn her. He always had the impression that if
  he became serious, deadly serious for ten consecutive minutes with his
  sister, he would be ruined. He kept on with his semi-jovial tone.</p>

  <p>"There are two arts, Elizabeth. One is making money and the other is
  spending it. You've mastered one and I've mastered the other. Which balances
  things, don't you think?"</p>

  <p>She did not melt; he waved down to the farm land.</p>

  <p>"Watch that wave of wind, Elizabeth."</p>

  <p>A gust struck the scattering of aspens, and turned up the silver of the
  dark green leaves. The breeze rolled across the trees in a long, rippling
  flash of light. But Elizabeth did not look down. Her glance was fixed on the
  changeless snow of Mount Discovery's summit.</p>

  <p>"As long as you have something to spend, spending is a very important art,
  Vance. But when the purse is empty, it's a bit useless, it seems to me."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, I'll have to mortgage my future. As a matter of fact, I
  suppose I could borrow what I want on my prospects."</p>

  <p>A veritable Indian yell, instantly taken up and prolonged by a chorus of
  similar shouts, cut off the last of his words. Round the corner of the house
  shot a blood-bay stallion, red as the red of iron under the blacksmith's
  hammer, with a long, black tail snapping and flaunting behind him, his ears
  flattened, his beautiful vicious head outstretched in an effort to tug the
  reins out of the hands of the rider. Failing in that effort, he leaped into
  the air like a steeplechaser and pitched down upon stiffened forelegs.</p>

  <p>The shock rippled through the body of the rider and came to his head with
  a snap that jerked his chin down against his breast. The stallion rocked back
  on his hind legs, whirled, and then flung himself deliberately on his back. A
  sufficiently cunning maneuver&mdash;first stunning the enemy with a blow and
  then crushing him before his senses returned. But he landed on nothing save
  hard gravel. The rider had whipped out of the saddle and stood poised, strong
  as the trunk of a silver spruce.</p>

  <p>The fighting horse, a little shaken by the impact of his fall,
  nevertheless whirled with catlike agility to his feet&mdash;a beautiful thing
  to watch. As he brought his forequarters off the earth, he lunged at the
  rider with open mouth. A sidestep that would have done credit to a pugilist
  sent the youngster swerving past that danger. He leaped to the saddle at the
  same time that the blood-bay came to his four feet.</p>

  <p>The chorus in full cry was around the horse, four or five excited cow-
  punchers waving their sombreros and yelling for horse or rider, according to
  the gallantry of the fight.</p>

  <p>The bay was in the air more than he was on the ground, eleven or twelve
  hundred pounds of might, writhing, snapping, bolting, halting, sunfishing
  with devilish cunning, dropping out of the air on one stiff foreleg with an
  accompanying sway to one side that gave the rider the effect of a cudgel blow
  at the back of the head and then a whip-snap to part the vertebrae. Whirling
  on his hind legs, and again flinging himself desperately on the ground, only
  to fail, come to his feet with the clinging burden once more maddeningly in
  place, and go again through a maze of fence-rowing and sun-fishing until
  suddenly he straightened out and bolted down the slope like a runaway
  locomotive on a downgrade. A terrifying spectacle, but the rider sat erect,
  with one arm raised high above his head in triumph, and his yell trailing off
  behind him. From a running gait the stallion fell into a smooth pace&mdash;a
  true wild pacer, his hoofs beating the ground with the force and speed of
  pistons and hurling himself forward with incredible strides. Horse and rider
  lurched out of sight among the silver spruce.</p>

  <p>"By the Lord, wonderful!" cried Vance Cornish.</p>

  <p>He heard a stifled cry beside him, a cry of infinite pain.</p>

  <p>"Is&mdash;is it over?"</p>

  <p>And there sat Elizabeth the Indomitable with her face buried in her hands
  like a girl of sixteen!</p>

  <p>"Of course it's over," said Vance, wondering profoundly.</p>

  <p>She seemed to dread to look up. "And&mdash;Terence?"</p>

  <p>"He's all right. Ever hear of a horse that could get that young wildcat
  out of the saddle? He clings as if he had claws. But&mdash;where did he get
  that red devil?"</p>

  <p>"Terence ran him down&mdash;in the mountains&mdash;somewhere," she
  answered, speaking as one who had only half heard the question. "Two months
  of constant trailing to do it, I think. But oh, you're right! The horse is a
  devil! And sometimes I think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She stopped, shuddering. Vance had returned to the ranch only the day
  before after a long absence. More and more, after he had been away, he found
  it difficult to get in touch with things on the ranch. Once he had been a
  necessary part of the inner life. Now he was on the outside. Terence and
  Elizabeth were a perfectly completed circle in themselves.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap3"
     name="chap3">CHAPTER 3</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"If Terry worries you like this," suggested her brother
  kindly, "why don't you forbid these pranks?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him as if in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Forbid Terry?" she echoed, and then smiled. Decidedly this was her first
  tone, a soft tone that came from deep in her throat. Instinctively Vance
  contrasted it with the way she had spoken to him. But it was always this way
  when Terry was mentioned. For the first time he saw it clearly. It was
  amazing how blind he had been. "Forbid Terence? Vance, that devil of a horse
  is part of his life. He was on a hunting trip when he saw Le
  Sangre&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, did they call the horse that?"</p>

  <p>"A French-Canadian was the first to discover him, and he gave the name.
  And he's the color of blood, really. Well, Terence saw Le Sangre on a hilltop
  against the sky. And he literally went mad. Actually, he struck out on foot
  with his rifle and lived in the country and never stopped walking until he
  wore down Le Sangre somehow and brought him back hobbled&mdash;just skin and
  bones, and Terence not much more. Now Le Sangre is himself again, and he and
  Terence have a fight&mdash;like that&mdash;every day. I dream about it; the
  most horrible nightmares!"</p>

  <p>"And you don't stop it?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Vance, how little you know Terence! You couldn't tear that horse
  out of his life without breaking his heart. I <i>know</i>"!</p>

  <p>"So you suffer, day by day?"</p>

  <p>"I've done very little else all my life," said Elizabeth gravely. "And
  I've learned to bear pain."</p>

  <p>He swallowed. Also, he was beginning to grow irritated. He had never
  before had a talk with Elizabeth that contained so many reefs that threatened
  shipwreck. He returned to the gist of their conversation rather too
  bluntly.</p>

  <p>"But to continue, Elizabeth, any banker would lend me money on my
  prospects."</p>

  <p>"You mean the property which will come to you when I die?"</p>

  <p>He used all his power, but he could not meet her glance. "You know that's
  a nasty way to put it, Elizabeth."</p>

  <p>"Dear Vance," she sighed, "a great many people say that I'm a hard woman.
  I suppose I am. And I like to look facts squarely in the face. Your prospects
  begin with my death, of course."</p>

  <p>He had no answer, but bit his lip nervously and wished the ordeal would
  come to an end.</p>

  <p>"Vance," she went on, "I'm glad to have this talk with you. It's something
  you have to know. Of course I'll see that during my life or my death you'll
  be provided for. But as for your main prospects, do you know where they
  are?"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>She was needlessly brutal about it, but as she had told him, her education
  had been one of pain.</p>

  <p>"Your prospects are down there by the river on the back of Le Sangre."</p>

  <p>Vance Cornish gasped.</p>

  <p>"I'll show you what I mean, Vance. Come along."</p>

  <p>The moment she rose, some of her age fell from her. Her carriage was
  erect. Her step was still full of spring and decision, as she led the way
  into the house. It was a big, solid, two-story building which the mightiest
  wind could not shake. Henry Cornish had merely founded the house, just as he
  had founded the ranch; the main portion of the work had been done by his
  daughter. And as they passed through, her stern old eye rested peacefully on
  the deep, shadowy vistas, and her foot fell with just pride on the splendid
  rising sweep of the staircase. They passed into the roomy vault of the upper
  hall and went down to the end. She took out a big key from her pocket and
  fitted it into the lock; then Vance dropped his hand on her arm. His voice
  lowered.</p>

  <p>"You've made a mistake, Elizabeth. This is Father's room."</p>

  <p>Ever since his death it had been kept unchanged, and practically unentered
  save for an occasional rare day of work to keep it in order. Now she nodded
  and resolutely turned the key and swung the door open. Vance went in with an
  exclamation of wonder. It was quite changed from the solemn old room and the
  brown, varnished woodwork which he remembered. Cream-tinted paint now made
  the walls cool and fresh. The solemn engravings no longer hung above the
  bookcases. And the bookcases themselves had been replaced with built-in
  shelves pleasantly filled with rich bindings, black and red and deep
  yellow-browns. A tall cabinet stood open at one side filled with rifles and
  shotguns of every description, and another cabinet was loaded with fishing
  apparatus. The stiff- backed chairs had given place to comfortable monsters
  of easy lines. Vance Cornish, as one in a dream, peered here and there.</p>

  <p>"God bless us!" he kept repeating. "God bless us! But where's there a
  trace of Father?"</p>

  <p>"I left it out," said Elizabeth huskily, "because this room is meant for
  &mdash;but let's go back. Do you remember that day twenty-four years ago when
  we took Jack Hollis's baby?"</p>

  <p>"When <i>you</i> took it," he corrected. "I disclaim all share in the
  idea."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," she answered proudly. "At any rate, I took the boy and called
  him Terence Colby."</p>

  <p>"Why that name," muttered Vance, "I never could understand."</p>

  <p>"Haven't I told you? No, and I hardly know whether to trust even you with
  the secret, Vance. But you remember we argued about it, and you said that
  blood would out; that the boy would turn out wrong; that before he was
  twenty-five he would have shot a man?"</p>

  <p>"I believe the talk ran like that."</p>

  <p>"Well, Vance, I started out with a theory; but the moment I had that baby
  in my arms, it became a matter of theory, plus, and chiefly plus. I kept
  remembering what you had said, and I was afraid. That was why I worked up the
  Colby idea."</p>

  <p>"That's easy to see."</p>

  <p>"It wasn't so easy to do. But I heard of the last of an old Virginia
  family who had died of consumption in Arizona. I traced his family. He was
  the last of it. Then it was easy to arrange a little story: Terence Colby had
  married a girl in Arizona, died shortly after; the girl died also, and I took
  the baby. Nobody can disprove what I say. There's not a living soul who knows
  that Terence is the son of Jack Hollis&mdash;except you and me."</p>

  <p>"How about the woman I got the baby from?"</p>

  <p>"I bought her silence until fifteen years ago. Then she died, and now
  Terry is convinced that he is the last representative of the Colby
  family."</p>

  <p>She laughed with excitement and beckoned him out of the room and into
  another&mdash;Terry's room, farther down the hall. She pointed to a large
  photograph of a solemn-faced man on the wall. "You see that?"</p>

  <p>"Who is it?"</p>

  <p>"I got it when I took Terry to Virginia last winter&mdash;to see the old
  family estate and go over the ground of the historic Colbys."</p>

  <p>She laughed again happily.</p>

  <p>"Terry was wild with enthusiasm. He read everything he could lay his hands
  on about the Colbys. Discovered the year they landed in Virginia; how they
  fought in the Revolution; how they fought and died in the Civil War. Oh, he
  knows every landmark in the history of 'his' family. Of course, I encouraged
  him."</p>

  <p>"I know," chuckled Vance. "Whenever he gets in a pinch, I've heard you
  say: 'Terry, what should a Colby do?'"</p>

  <p>"And," cut in Elizabeth, "you must admit that it has worked. There isn't a
  prouder, gentler, cleaner-minded boy in the world than Terry. Not blood. It's
  the blood of Jack Hollis. But it's what he thinks himself to be that counts.
  And now, Vance, admit that your theory is exploded."</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Terry will do well enough. But wait till the pinch comes. You don't know
  how he'll turn out when the rub comes. <i>Then</i> blood will tell!"</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders angrily.</p>

  <p>"You're simply being perverse now, Vance. At any rate, that picture is one
  of Terry's old 'ancestors,' Colonel Vincent Colby, of prewar days. Terry has
  discovered family resemblances, of course&mdash;same black hair, same black
  eyes, and a great many other things."</p>

  <p>"But suppose he should ever learn the truth?" murmured Vance.</p>

  <p>She caught her breath.</p>

  <p>"That would be ruinous, of course. But he'll never learn. Only you and I
  know."</p>

  <p>"A very hard blow, eh," said Vance, "if he were robbed of the Colby
  illusion and had Black Jack put in its place as a cold fact? But of course
  we'll never tell him."</p>

  <p>Her color was never high. Now it became gray. Only her eyes remained
  burning, vivid, young, blazing out through the mask of age.</p>

  <p>"Remember you said his blood would tell before he was twenty-five; that
  the blood of Black Jack would come to the surface; that he would have shot a
  man?"</p>

  <p>"Still harping on that, Elizabeth? What if he does?"</p>

  <p>"I'd disown him, throw him out penniless on the world, never see him
  again."</p>

  <p>"You're a Spartan," said her brother in awe, as he looked on that thin,
  stern face. "Terry is your theory. If he disappoints you, he'll be simply a
  theory gone wrong. You'll cut him out of your life as if he were an algebraic
  equation and never think of him again."</p>

  <p>"But he's not going wrong, Vance. Because, in ten days, he'll be twenty-
  five! And that's what all these changes mean. The moment it grows dark on the
  night of his twenty-fifth birthday, I'm going to take him into my father's
  room and turn it over to him."</p>

  <p>He had listened to her patiently, a little wearied by her unusual flow of
  words. Now he came out of his apathy with a jerk. He laid his hand on
  Elizabeth's shoulder and turned her so that the light shone full in her face.
  Then he studied her.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by that, Elizabeth?"</p>

  <p>"Vance," she said steadily, but with a touch of pity in her voice, "I have
  waited for a score of years, hoping that you'd settle down and try to do a
  man's work either here or somewhere else. You haven't done it. Yesterday Mr.
  Cornwall came here to draw up my will. By that will I leave you an annuity,
  Vance, that will take care of you in comfort; but I leave everything else to
  Terry Colby. That's why I've changed the room. The moment it grows dark ten
  days from today, I'm going to take Terry by the hand and lead him into the
  room and into the position of my father!"</p>

  <p>The mask of youth which was Vance Cornish crumbled and fell away. A new
  man looked down at her. The firm flesh of his face became loose. His whole
  body was flabby. She had the feeling that if she pushed against his chest
  with the weight of her arm, he would topple to the floor. That weakness
  gradually passed. A peculiar strength of purpose grew in its place.</p>

  <p>"Of course, this is a very shrewd game, Elizabeth. You want to wake me up.
  You're using the spur to make me work. I don't blame you for using the bluff,
  even if it's a rather cruel one. But, of course, it's impossible for you to
  be serious in what you say."</p>

  <p>"Why impossible, Vance?"</p>

  <p>"Because you know that I'm the last male representative of our family.
  Because you know my father would turn in his grave if he knew that an
  interloper, a foundling, the child of a murderer, a vagabond, had been made
  the heir to his estate. But you aren't serious, Elizabeth; I understand."</p>

  <p>He swallowed his pride, for panic grew in him in proportion to the length
  of time she maintained her silence.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, I don't blame you for giving me a scare, my dear
  sister. I have been a shameless loafer. I'm going to reform and lift the
  burden of business off your shoulders&mdash;let you rest the remainder of
  your life."</p>

  <p>It was the worst thing he could have said. He realized it the moment he
  had spoken. This forced, cowardly surrender was worse than brazen defiance,
  and he saw her lip curl. An idler is apt to be like a sullen child, except
  that in a grown man the child's sulky spite becomes a dark malice,
  all-embracing. For the very reason that Vance knew he was receiving what he
  deserved, and that this was the just reward for his thriftless years of
  idleness, he began to hate Elizabeth with a cold, quiet hatred. There is
  something stimulating about any great passion. Now Vance felt his nerves
  soothed and calmed. His self- possession returned with a rush. He was
  suddenly able to smile into her face.</p>

  <p>"After all," he said, "you're absolutely right. I've been a failure,
  Elizabeth&mdash;a rank, disheartening failure. You'd be foolish to trust the
  result of your life labors in my hands&mdash;entirely foolish. I admit that
  it's a shrewd blow to see the estate go to&mdash;Terry."</p>

  <p>He found it oddly difficult to name the boy.</p>

  <p>"But why not? Why not Terry? He's a clean youngster, and he may turn out
  very well&mdash;in spite of his blood. I hope so. The Lord knows you've given
  him every chance and the best start in the world. I wish him luck!"</p>

  <p>He reached out his hand, and her bloodless fingers closed strongly over
  it.</p>

  <p>"There's the old Vance talking," she said warmly, a mist across her eyes.
  "I almost thought that part of you had died."</p>

  <p>He writhed inwardly. "By Jove, Elizabeth, think of that boy, coming out of
  nothing, everything poured into his hands&mdash;and now within ten days of
  his goal! Rather exciting, isn't it? Suppose he should stumble at the very
  threshold of his success? Eh?"</p>

  <p>He pressed the point with singular insistence.</p>

  <p>"Doesn't it make your heart beat, Elizabeth, when you think that he might
  fall&mdash;that he might do what I prophesied so long ago&mdash;shoot a man
  before he's twenty-five?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged the supposition calmly away.</p>

  <p>"My faith in him is based as strongly as the rocks, Vance. But if he fell,
  after the schooling I've given him, I'd throw him out of my life&mdash;
  forever."</p>

  <p>He paused a moment, studying her face with a peculiar eagerness. Then he
  shrugged in turn. "Tush! Of course, that's impossible. Let's go down."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap4"
     name="chap4">CHAPTER 4</a></h2>

  <p class="first">When they reached the front porch, they saw Terence Colby
  coming up the terrace from the river road on Le Sangre. And a changed horse
  he was. One ear was forward as if he did not know what lay in store for him,
  but would try to be on the alert. One ear flagged warily back. He went
  slowly, lifting his feet with the care of a very weary horse. Yet, when the
  wind fluttered a gust of whirling leaves beside him, he leaped aside and
  stood with high head, staring, transformed in the instant into a creature of
  fire and wire-strung nerves. The rider gave to the side-spring with supple
  grace and then sent the stallion on up the hill.</p>

  <p>Joyous triumph was in the face of Terry. His black hair was blowing about
  his forehead, for his hat was pushed back after the manner of one who has
  done a hard day's work and is ready to rest. He came close to the veranda,
  and Le Sangre lifted his fine head and stared fearlessly, curiously, with a
  sort of contemptuous pride, at Elizabeth and Vance.</p>

  <p>"The killer is no longer a killer," laughed Terry. "Look him over, Uncle
  Vance. A beauty, eh?"</p>

  <p>Elizabeth said nothing at all. But she rocked herself back and forth a
  trifle in her chair as she nodded. She glanced over the terrace, hoping that
  others might be there to see the triumph of her boy. Then she looked back at
  Terence. But Vance was regarding the horse.</p>

  <p>"He might have a bit more in the legs, Terry."</p>

  <p>"Not much more. A leggy horse can't stand mountain work&mdash;or any other
  work, for that matter, except a ride in the park."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you're right. He's a picture horse, Terry. And a devilish eye,
  but I see that you've beaten him."</p>

  <p>"Beaten him?" He shook his head. "We reached a gentleman's agreement. As
  long as I wear spurs, he'll fight me till he gets his teeth in me or splashes
  my skull to bits with his heels. Otherwise he'll keep on fighting till he
  drops. But as soon as I take off the spurs and stop tormenting him, he'll do
  what I like. No whips or spurs for Le Sangre. Eh, boy?"</p>

  <p>He held out the spurs so that the sun flashed on them. The horse stiffened
  with a shudder, and that forward look of a horse about to bolt came in his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"No, no!" cried Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>But Terry laughed and dropped the spurs back in his pocket.</p>

  <p>The stallion moved off, and Terry waved to them. Just as he turned, the
  mind of Vance Cornish raced back to another picture&mdash;a man with long
  black hair blowing about his face and a gun in either hand, sweeping through
  a dusty street with shots barking behind him. It came suddenly as a
  revelation, and left him downheaded with the thought.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Vance?" asked his sister, reaching out to touch his arm.</p>

  <p>"Nothing." Then he added abruptly: "I'm going for a jaunt for a few days,
  Elizabeth."</p>

  <p>She grew gloomy.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to insist on taking it to heart this way?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all. I'm going to be back here in ten days and drink Terry's long
  life and happiness across the birthday dinner table."</p>

  <p>He marvelled at the ease with which he could make himself smile in her
  face.</p>

  <p>"You noticed that&mdash;his gentleman's agreement with Le Sangre? I've
  made him detest fighting with the idea that only brute beasts fight&mdash;men
  argue and agree."</p>

  <p>"I've noticed that he never has trouble with the cow-punchers."</p>

  <p>"They've seen him box," chuckled Elizabeth. "Besides, Terry isn't the sort
  that troublemakers like to pick on. He has an ugly look when he's angry."</p>

  <p>"H'm," murmured Vance. "I've noticed that. But as long as he keeps to his
  fists, he'll do no harm. But what is the reason for surrounding him with
  guns, Elizabeth?"</p>

  <p>"A very good reason. He loves them, you know. Anything from a shotgun to a
  derringer is a source of joy to Terence. And not a day goes by that he
  doesn't handle them."</p>

  <p>"Certainly the effect of blood, eh?" suggested Vance.</p>

  <p>She glanced sharply at him.</p>

  <p>"You're determined to be disagreeable today, Vance. As a matter of fact,
  I've convinced him that for the very reason he is so accurate with a gun he
  must never enter a gun fight. The advantage would be too much on his side
  against any ordinary man. That appeals to Terry's sense of fair play. No,
  he's absolutely safe, no matter how you look at it."</p>

  <p>"No doubt."</p>

  <p>He looked away from her and over the valley. The day had worn into the
  late afternoon. Bear Creek ran dull and dark in the shadow, and Mount
  Discovery was robed in blue to the very edge of its shining crown of snow. In
  this dimmer, richer light the Cornish ranch had never seemed so desirable to
  Vance. It was not a ranch; it was a little kingdom. And Vance was the
  dispossessed heir.</p>

  <p>He knew that he was being watched, however, and all that evening he was at
  his best. At the dinner table he guided the talk so that Terence Colby was
  the lion of the conversation. Afterward, when he was packing his things in
  his room for his journey of the next day, he was careful to sing at the top
  of his voice. He reaped a reward for this cautious acting, for the next
  morning, when he climbed into the buckboard that was to take him down the
  Blue Mountain road and over to the railroad, his sister came down the steps
  and stood beside the wagon.</p>

  <p>"You <i>will</i> come back for the birthday party, Vance?" she
  pleaded.</p>

  <p>"You want me to?"</p>

  <p>"You were with me when I got Terry. In fact, you got him for me. And I
  want you to be here when he steps into his own."</p>

  <p>In this he found enough to keep him thoughtful all the way to the railroad
  while the buckskins grunted up the grade and then spun away down the long
  slope beyond. It was one of those little ironies of fate that he should have
  picked up the very man who was to disinherit him some twenty-four years
  later.</p>

  <p>He carried no grudge against Elizabeth, but he certainly retained no
  tenderness. Hereafter he would act his part as well as he could to extract
  the last possible penny out of her. And in the meantime he must concentrate
  on tripping up Terence Colby, alias Hollis.</p>

  <p>Vance saw nothing particularly vicious in this. He had been idle so long
  that he rejoiced in a work which was within his mental range. It included
  scheming, working always behind the scenes, pulling strings to make others
  jump. And if he could trip Terry and actually make him shoot a man on or
  before that birthday, he had no doubt that his sister would actually throw
  the boy out of her house and out of her life. A woman who could give
  twenty-four years to a theory would be capable of grim things when the theory
  went wrong.</p>

  <p>It was early evening when he climbed off the train at Garrison City. He
  had not visited the place since that cattle-buying trip of twenty-four years
  ago that brought the son of Black Jack into the affairs of the Cornish
  family. Garrison City had become a city. There were two solid blocks of brick
  buildings next to the station, a network of paved streets, and no less than
  three hotels. It was so new to the eye and so obviously full of the "booster"
  spirit that he was appalled at the idea of prying through this modern shell
  and getting back to the heart and the memory of the old days of the town.</p>

  <p>At the restaurant he forced himself upon a grave-looking gentleman across
  the table. He found that the solemn-faced man was a travelling drummer. The
  venerable loafer in front of the blacksmith's shop was feeble-minded, and
  merely gaped at the name of Black Jack. The proprietor of the hotel shook his
  head with positive antagonism.</p>

  <p>"Of course, Garrison City has its past," he admitted, "but we are living
  it down, and have succeeded pretty well. I think I've heard of a ruffian of
  the last generation named Jack Hollis; but I don't know anything, and I don't
  care to know anything, about him. But if you're interested in Garrison City,
  I'd like to show you a little plot of ground in a place that is going to be
  the center of the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Vance Cornish made his mind a blank, let the smooth current of words slip
  off his memory as from an oiled surface, and gave up Garrison City as a
  hopeless job. Nevertheless, it was the hotel proprietor who dropped a
  valuable hint.</p>

  <p>"If you're interested in the early legends, why don't you go to the State
  Capitol? They have every magazine and every book that so much as mentions any
  place in the state." So Vance Cornish went to the capitol and entered the
  library. It was a sweaty task and a most discouraging one. The name "Black
  Jack" revealed nothing; and the name of Hollis was an equal blank, so far as
  the indices were concerned. He was preserved in legend only, and Vance
  Cornish could make no vital use of legend. He wanted something in cold
  print.</p>

  <p>So he began an exhaustive search. He went through volume after volume, but
  though he came upon mention of Black Jack, he never reached the account of an
  eyewitness of any of those stirring holdups or train robberies.</p>

  <p>And then he began on the old files of magazines. And still nothing. He was
  about to give up with four days of patient labor wasted when he struck gold
  in the desert&mdash;the very mine of information which he wanted.</p>

  <p>"How I Painted Black Jack," by Lawrence Montgomery.</p>

  <p>There was the photograph of the painter, to begin with&mdash;a man who had
  discovered the beauty of the deserts of the Southwest. But there was more
  &mdash;much more. It told how, in his wandering across the desert, he had
  hunted for something more than raw-colored sands and purple mesas blooming in
  the distance.</p>

  <p>He had searched for a human being to fit into the picture and give the
  softening touch of life. But he never found the face for which he had been
  looking. And then luck came and tapped him on the shoulder. A lone rider came
  out of the dusk and the desert and loomed beside his campfire. The moment the
  firelight flushed on the face of the man, he knew this was the face for which
  he had been searching. He told how they fried bacon and ate it together; he
  told of the soft voice and the winning smile of the rider; he told of his
  eyes, unspeakably soft and unspeakably bold, and the agile, nervous hands,
  forever shifting and moving in the firelight.</p>

  <p>The next morning he had asked his visitor to sit for a picture, and his
  request had been granted. All day he labored at the canvas, and by night the
  work was far enough along for him to dismiss his visitor. So the stranger
  asked for a small brush with black paint on it, and in the corner of the
  canvas drew in the words "Yours, Black Jack." Then he rode into the
  night.</p>

  <p>Black Jack! Lawrence Montgomery had made up his pack and struck straight
  back for the nearest town. There he asked for tidings of a certain Black
  Jack, and there he got what he wanted in heaps. Everyone knew Black
  Jack&mdash;too well! There followed a brief summary of the history of the
  desperado and his countless crimes, unspeakable tales of cunning and courage
  and merciless vengeance taken.</p>

  <p>Vance Cornish turned the last page of the article, and there was the
  reproduction of the painting. He held his breath when he saw it. The outlaw
  sat on his horse with his head raised and turned, and it was the very replica
  of Terence Colby as the boy had waved to them from the back of Le Sangre.
  More than a family, sketchy resemblance&mdash;far more.</p>

  <p>There was the same large, dark eye; the same smile, half proud and half
  joyous; the same imperious lift of the head; the same bold carving of the
  features. There were differences, to be sure. The nose of Black Jack had been
  more cruelly arched, for instance, and his cheekbones were higher and more
  pronounced. But in spite of the dissimilarities the resemblance was more than
  striking. It might have stood for an actual portrait of Terence Colby
  masquerading in long hair.</p>

  <p>When the full meaning of this photograph had sunk into his mind, Vance
  Cornish closed his eyes. "Eureka!" he whispered to himself.</p>

  <p>There was something more to be done. But it was very simple. It merely
  consisted in covertly cutting out the pages of the article in question. Then,
  carefully, for fear of loss, he jotted down the name and date of the
  magazine, folded his stolen pages, and fitted them snugly into his breast
  pocket. That night he ate his first hearty dinner in four days.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap5"
     name="chap5">CHAPTER 5</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Vance's work was not by any means accomplished. Rather, it
  might be said that he was in the position of a man with a dangerous charge
  for a gun and no weapon to shoot it. He started out to find the gun.</p>

  <p>In fact, he already had it in mind. Twenty-four hours later he was in
  Craterville. Five days out of the ten before the twenty-fifth birthday of
  Terence had elapsed, and Vance was still far from his goal, but he felt that
  the lion's share of the work had been accomplished.</p>

  <p>Craterville was a day's ride across the mountains from the Cornish ranch,
  and it was the county seat. It was one of those towns which spring into
  existence for no reason that can be discovered, and cling to life generations
  after they should have died. But Craterville held one thing of which Vance
  Cornish was in great need, and that was Sheriff Joe Minter, familiarly called
  Uncle Joe. His reason for wanting the sheriff was perfectly simple. Uncle Joe
  Minter was the man who killed Black Jack Hollis.</p>

  <p>He had been a boy of eighteen then, shooting with a rifle across a window
  sill. That shot had formed his life. He was now forty-two and he had spent
  the interval as the professional enemy of criminals in the mountains. For the
  glory which came from the killing of Black Jack had been sweet to the
  youthful palate of Minter, and he had cultivated his taste. He became the
  most dreaded manhunter in those districts where manhunting was most common.
  He had been sheriff at Craterville for a dozen years now, and still his
  supremacy was not even questioned.</p>

  <p>Vance Cornish was lucky to find the sheriff in town presiding at the head
  of the long table of the hotel at dinner. He was a man of great dignity. He
  wore his stiff black hair, still untarnished by gray, very long, brushing it
  with difficulty to keep it behind his ears. This mass of black hair framed a
  long, stern face, the angles of which had been made by years. But there was
  no sign of weakness. He had grown dry, not flabby. His mouth was a thin,
  straight line, and his fighting chin jutted out in profile.</p>

  <p>He rose from his place to greet Vance Cornish. Indeed, the sheriff acted
  the part of master of ceremonies at the hotel, having a sort of silent
  understanding with the widow who owned the place. It was said that the
  sheriff would marry the woman sooner or later, he so loved to talk at her
  table. His talk doubled her business. Her table afforded him an audience; so
  they needed one another.</p>

  <p>"You don't remember me," said Vance.</p>

  <p>"I got a tolerable poor memory for faces," admitted the sheriff.</p>

  <p>"I'm Cornish, of the Cornish ranch."</p>

  <p>The sheriff was duly impressed. The Cornish ranch was a show place. He
  arranged a chair for Vance at his right, and presently the talk rose above
  the murmur to which it had been depressed by the arrival of this important
  stranger. The increasing noise made a background. It left Vance alone with
  the sheriff.</p>

  <p>"And how do you find your work, sheriff?" asked Vance; for he knew that
  Uncle Joe Minter's great weakness was his love of talk. Everyone in the
  mountains knew it, for that matter.</p>

  <p>"Dull," complained Minter. "Men ain't what they used to be, or else the
  law is a heap stronger."</p>

  <p>"The men who enforce the law are," said Vance.</p>

  <p>The sheriff absorbed this patent compliment with the blank eye of
  satisfaction and rubbed his chin.</p>

  <p>"But they's been some talk of rustling, pretty recent. I'm waiting for it
  to grow and get ripe. Then I'll bust it."</p>

  <p>He made an eloquent gesture which Vance followed. He was distinctly
  pleased with the sheriff. For Minter was wonderfully preserved. His face
  seemed five years younger than his age. His body seemed even
  younger&mdash;round, smooth, powerful muscles padding his shoulders and
  stirring down the length of his big arms. And his hands had that peculiar
  light restlessness of touch which Vance remembered to have seen&mdash;in the
  hands of Terence Colby, alias Hollis!</p>

  <p>"And how's things up your way?" continued the sheriff.</p>

  <p>"Booming. By the way, how long is it since you've seen the ranch?"</p>

  <p>"Never been there. Bear Creek Valley has always been a quiet place since
  the Cornishes moved in; and they ain't been any call for a gent in my line of
  business up that way."</p>

  <p>He grinned with satisfaction, and Vance nodded.</p>

  <p>"If times are dull, why not drop over? We're having a celebration there in
  five days. Come and look us over."</p>

  <p>"Maybe I might, and maybe I mightn't," said the sheriff. "All
  depends."</p>

  <p>"And bring some friends with you," insisted Vance.</p>

  <p>Then he wisely let the subject drop and went on to a detailed description
  of the game in the hills around the ranch. That, he knew, would bring the
  sheriff if anything would. But he mentioned the invitation no more. There
  were particular reasons why he must not press it on the sheriff any more than
  on others in Craterville.</p>

  <p>The next morning, before traintime, Vance went to the post office and left
  the article on Black Jack addressed to Terence Colby at the Cornish ranch.
  The addressing was done on a typewriter, which completely removed any means
  of identifying the sender. Vance played with Providence in only one way. He
  was so eager to strike his blow at the last possible moment that he asked the
  postmaster to hold the letter for three days, which would land it at the
  ranch on the morning of the birthday. Then he went to the train.</p>

  <p>His self-respect was increasing by leaps and bounds. The game was still
  not won, but, starting with absolutely nothing, in six days he had planted a
  charge which might send Elizabeth's twenty-four years of labor up in
  smoke.</p>

  <p>He got off the train at Preston, the station nearest the ranch, and took a
  hired team up the road along Bear Creek Gorge. They debouched out of the Blue
  Mountains into the valley of the ranch in the early evening, and Vance found
  himself looking with new eyes on the little kingdom. He felt the happiness,
  indeed, of one who has lost a great prize and then put himself in a fair way
  of winning it back.</p>

  <p>They dipped into the valley road. Over the tops of the big silver spruces
  he traced the outline of Sleep Mountain against the southern sky. Who but
  Vance, or the dwellers in the valley, would be able to duly appreciate such
  beauty? If there were any wrong in what he had done, this thought consoled
  him: the ends justified the means.</p>

  <p>Now, as they drew closer, through the branches he made out glimpses of the
  dim, white front of the big house on the hill. That big, cool house with the
  kingdom spilled out at its feet, the farming lands, the pastures of the
  hills, and the rich forest of the upper mountains. Certainty came to Vance
  Cornish. He wanted the ranch so profoundly that the thought of losing it
  became impossible.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap6"
     name="chap6">CHAPTER 6</a></h2>

  <p class="first">But while he had been working at a distance, things had been
  going on apace at the ranch, a progress which had now gathered such impetus
  that he found himself incapable of checking it. The blow fell immediately
  after dinner that same evening. Terence excused himself early to retire to
  the mysteries of a new pump-gun. Elizabeth and Vance took their coffee into
  the library.</p>

  <p>The night had turned cool, with a sharp wind driving the chill through
  every crack; so a few sticks were sending their flames crumbling against the
  big back log. The lamp glowing in the corner was the only other light, and
  when they drew their chairs close to the hearth, great tongues of shadows
  leaped and fell on the wall behind them. Vance looked at his sister with
  concern. There was a certain complacency about her this evening that told him
  in advance that she had formed a new plan with which she was well pleased.
  And he had come to dread her plans.</p>

  <p>She always filled him with awe&mdash;and never more so than tonight, with
  her thin, homely face illuminated irregularly and by flashes. He kept
  watching her from the side, with glances.</p>

  <p>"I think I know why you've gone away for these few days," she said.</p>

  <p>"To get used to the new idea," he admitted with such frankness that she
  turned to him with unusual sympathy. "It was rather a shock at first."</p>

  <p>"I know it was. And I wasn't diplomatic. There's too much man in me,
  Vance. Altogether too much, while you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She closed her lips suddenly. But he knew perfectly the unspoken words.
  She was about to suggest that there was too little man in him. He dropped his
  chin in his hand, partly for comfort and partly to veil the sneer. If she
  could have followed what he had done in the past six days!</p>

  <p>"And you are used to the new idea?"</p>

  <p>"You see that I'm back before the time was up and ahead of my promise," he
  said.</p>

  <p>She nodded. "Which paves the way for another new idea of mine."</p>

  <p>He felt that a blow was coming and nerved himself against the shock of it.
  But the preparation was merely like tensing one's muscles against a fall.
  When the shock came, it stunned him.</p>

  <p>"Vance, I've decided to adopt Terence!"</p>

  <p>His fingertips sank into his cheek, bruising the flesh. What would become
  of his six days of work? What would become of his cunning and his
  forethought? All destroyed at a blow. For if she adopted the boy, the very
  law would keep her from denying him afterward. For a moment it seemed to him
  that some devil must have forewarned her of his plans.</p>

  <p>"You don't approve?" she said at last, anxiously.</p>

  <p>He threw himself back in the chair and laughed. All his despair went into
  that hollow, ringing sound.</p>

  <p>"Approve? It's a queer question to ask me. But let it go. I know I
  couldn't change you."</p>

  <p>"I know that you have a right to advise," she said gently. "You are my
  father's son and you have a right to advise on the placing of his name."</p>

  <p>He had to keep fighting against surging desires to throw his rage in her
  face. But he mastered himself, except for a tremor of his voice.</p>

  <p>"When are you going to do it?"</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow."</p>

  <p>"Elizabeth, why not wait until after the birthday ceremony?"</p>

  <p>"Because I've been haunted by peculiar fears, since our last talk, that
  something might happen before that time. I've actually lain awake at night
  and thought about it! And I want to forestall all chances. I want to rivet
  him to me!"</p>

  <p>He could see by her eagerness that her mind had been irrevocably made up,
  and that nothing could change her. She wanted agreement, not advice. And with
  consummate bitterness of soul he submitted to his fate.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you're right. Call him down now and I'll be present when you
  ask him to join the circle&mdash;the family circle of the Cornishes, you
  know."</p>

  <p>He could not school all the bitterness out of his voice, but she seemed
  too glad of his bare acquiescence to object to such trifles. She sent Wu Chi
  to call Terence down to them. He had apparently been in his shirt sleeves
  working at the gun. He came with his hands still faintly glistening from
  their hasty washing, and with the coat which he had just bundled into still
  rather bunched around his big shoulders. He came and stood against the
  massive, rough-finished stones of the fireplace looking down at Elizabeth.
  There had always been a sort of silent understanding between him and Vance.
  They never exchanged more words and looks than were absolutely necessary.
  Vance realized it more than ever as he looked up to the tall athletic figure.
  And he realized also that since he had last looked closely at Terence the
  latter had slipped out of boyhood and into manhood. There was that
  indescribable something about the set of the chin and the straight-looking
  eyes that spelled the difference.</p>

  <p>"Terence," she said, "for twenty-four years you have been my boy."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Aunt Elizabeth."</p>

  <p>He acknowledged the gravity of this opening statement by straightening a
  little, his hand falling away from the stone against which he had been
  leaning. But Vance looked more closely at his sister. He could see the gleam
  of worship in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"And now I want you to be something more. I want you to be my boy in the
  eyes of the law, so that when anything happens to me, your place won't be
  threatened."</p>

  <p>He was straighter than ever.</p>

  <p>"I want to adopt you, Terence!"</p>

  <p>Somehow, in those few moments they had been gradually building to a
  climax. It was prodigiously heightened now by the silence of the boy. The
  throat of Vance tightened with excitement.</p>

  <p>"I will be your mother, in the eyes of the law," she was explaining
  gently, as though it were a mystery which Terry could not understand. "And
  Vance, here, will be your uncle. You understand, my dear?"</p>

  <p>What a world of brooding tenderness went into her voice! Vance wondered at
  it. But he wondered more at the stiff-standing form of Terence, and his
  silence; until he saw the tender smile vanish from the face of Elizabeth and
  alarm come into it. All at once Terence had dropped to one knee before her
  and taken her hands. And now it was he who was talking slowly, gently.</p>

  <p>"All my life you've given me things, Aunt Elizabeth. You've given me
  everything. Home, happiness, love&mdash;everything that could be given. So
  much that you could never be repaid, and all I can do is to love you, you
  see, and honor you as if you were my mother, in fact. But there's just one
  thing that can't be given. And that's a name!"</p>

  <p>He paused. Elizabeth was listening with a stricken face, and the heart of
  Vance thundered with his excitement. Vaguely he felt that there was something
  fine and clean and honorable in the heart of this youth which was being laid
  bare; but about that he cared very little. He was getting at facts and
  emotions which were valuable to him in the terms of dollars and cents.</p>

  <p>"It makes me choke up," said Terence, "to have you offer me this great
  thing. It's a fine name, Cornish. But you know that I can't do it. It would
  be cowardly&mdash;a sort of rotten treason for me to change. It would be
  wrong. I know it would be wrong. I'm a Colby, Aunt Elizabeth. Every time that
  name is spoken, I feel it tingling down to my fingertips. I want to stand
  straighter, live cleaner. When I looked at the old Colby place in Virginia
  last year, it brought the tears to my eyes. I felt as if I were a product of
  that soil. Every fine thing that has ever been done by a Colby is a strength
  to me. I've studied them. And every now and then when I come to some brave
  thing they've done, I wonder if I could do it. And then I say to myself that
  I <i>must</i> be able to do just such things or else be a shame to my
  blood.</p>

  <p>"Change my name? Why, I've gone all my life thanking God that I come of a
  race of gentlemen, clean-handed, and praying God to make me worthy of it.
  That name is like a whip over me. It drives me on and makes me want to do
  some fine big thing one of these days. Think of it! I'm the last of a race.
  I'm the end of it. The last of the Colbys! Why, when you think of it, you see
  how I can't possibly change, don't you? If I lost that, I'd lose the best
  half of myself and my self-respect! You understand, don't you? Not that I
  slight the name of Cornish for an instant. But even if names can be changed,
  blood can't be changed!"</p>

  <p>She turned her head. She met the gleaming eyes of Vance, and then let her
  glance probe the fire and shadow of the hearth.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, my dear," she said faintly. "Stand up."</p>

  <p>"I've hurt you," he said contritely, leaning over her. "I feel&mdash; like
  a dog. Have I hurt you?"</p>

  <p>"Not the least in the world. I only offered it for your happiness, Terry.
  And if you don't need it, there's no more to be said!"</p>

  <p>He bent and kissed her forehead.</p>

  <p>The moment he had disappeared through the tall doorway, Vance, past
  control, exploded.</p>

  <p>"Of all the damnable exhibitions of pride in a young upstart, this
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hush, hush!" said Elizabeth faintly. "It's the finest thing I've ever
  heard Terry say. But it frightens me, Vance. It frightens me to know that
  I've formed the character and the pride and the self-respect of that boy
  on&mdash; a lie! Pray God that he never learns the truth!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap7"
     name="chap7">CHAPTER 7</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There were not many guests. Elizabeth had chosen them
  carefully from families which had known her father, Henry Cornish, when, in
  his reckless, adventurous way, he had been laying the basis of the Cornish
  fortune in the Rockies. Indeed, she was a little angry when she heard of the
  indiscriminate way in which Vance had scattered the invitations, particularly
  in Craterville.</p>

  <p>But, as he said, he had acted so as to show her that he had entered fully
  into the spirit of the thing, and that his heart was in the right place as
  far as this birthday party was concerned, and she could not do otherwise than
  accept his explanation.</p>

  <p>Some of the bidden guests, however, came from a great distance, and as a
  matter of course a few of them arrived the day before the celebration and
  filled the quiet rooms of the old house with noise. Elizabeth accepted them
  with resignation, and even pleasure, because they all had pleasant things to
  say about her father and good wishes to express for the destined heir,
  Terence Colby. It was carefully explained that this selection of an heir had
  been made by both Elizabeth and Vance, which removed all cause for remark.
  Vance himself regarded the guests with distinct amusement. But Terence was
  disgusted.</p>

  <p>"What these true Westerners need," he said to Elizabeth later in the day,
  "is a touch of blood. No feeling of family or the dignity of family
  precedents out here."</p>

  <p>It touched her shrewdly. More than once she had felt that Terry was on the
  verge of becoming a complacent prig. So she countered with a sharp
  thrust.</p>

  <p>"You have to remember that you're a Westerner born and bred, my dear. A
  very Westerner yourself!"</p>

  <p>"Birth is an accident&mdash;birthplaces, I mean," smiled Terence. "It's
  the blood that tells."</p>

  <p>"Terry, you're a snob!" exclaimed Aunt Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>"I hope not," he answered. "But look yonder, now!"</p>

  <p>Old George Armstrong's daughter, Nelly, had gone up a tree like a squirrel
  and was laughing down through the branches at a raw-boned cousin on the
  ground beneath her.</p>

  <p>"And what of it?" said Elizabeth. "That girl is pretty enough to please
  any man; and she's the type that makes a wife."</p>

  <p>Terry rubbed his chin with his knuckles thoughtfully. It was the one
  family habit that he had contracted from Vance, much to the irritation of the
  latter.</p>

  <p>"After all," said Terry, with complacency, "what are good looks with bad
  grammar?"</p>

  <p>Elizabeth snorted literally and most unfemininely.</p>

  <p>"Terence," she said, lessoning him with her bony, long forefinger, "you're
  just young enough to be wise about women. When you're a little older, you'll
  get sense. If you want white hands and good grammar, how do you expect to
  find a wife in the mountains?"</p>

  <p>Terry answered with unshaken, lordly calm. "I haven't thought about the
  details. They don't matter. But a man must have standards of criticism."</p>

  <p>"Standards your foot!" cried Aunt Elizabeth. "You insufferable young prig.
  That very girl laughing down through the branches&mdash;I'll wager she could
  set your head spinning in ten seconds if she thought it worth her while to
  try."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," smiled Terence. "In the meantime she has freckles and a
  vocabulary without growing pains."</p>

  <p>"All men are fools," declared Aunt Elizabeth; "but boys are idiots, bless
  'em! Terence, before you grow up you'll have sore toes from stumbling, take
  my word for it! Do you know what a wise man would do?"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Go out and start a terrific flirtation with Nelly."</p>

  <p>"For the sake of experience?" sighed Terence.</p>

  <p>"Good heavens!" groaned Aunt Elizabeth. "Terry, you're impossible! Where
  are you going now?"</p>

  <p>"Out to see El Sangre."</p>

  <p>He went whistling out of the door, and she followed him with confused
  feelings of anger, pride, joy, and fear. She went to a side window and saw
  him go fearlessly into the corral where the man-destroying El Sangre was
  kept. And the big stallion, red fire in the sunshine, went straight to him
  and nosed at a hip pocket. They had already struck up a perfect
  understanding. Deeply she wondered at it.</p>

  <p>She had never loved the mountains and their people and their ways. It had
  been a battle to fight. She had fought the battle, won, and gained a hollow
  victory. And watching Terry caress the great, beautiful horse, she knew
  vaguely that his heart, at least, was in tune with the wilderness.</p>

  <p>"I wish to heaven, Terry," she murmured, "that you could find a master as
  El Sangre has done. You need teaching."</p>

  <p>When she turned from the window, she found Vance watching her. He had a
  habit of obscurely melting into a background and looking out at her
  unexpectedly. All at once she knew that he had been there listening during
  all of her talk with Terence. Not that the talk had been of a peculiarly
  private nature, but it angered her. There was just a semblance of
  eavesdropping about the presence of Vance. For she knew that Terence
  unbosomed himself to her as he would do in the hearing of no other human
  being. However, she mastered her anger and smiled at her brother. He had
  taken all these recent changes which were so much to his disadvantage with a
  good spirit that astonished and touched her.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what I'm going to give Terry for his birthday?" he said,
  sauntering toward her.</p>

  <p>"Well?" A mention of Terence and his welfare always disarmed her
  completely. She opened her eyes and her heart and smiled at her brother.</p>

  <p>"There's no set of Scott in the house. I'm going to give Terry one."</p>

  <p>"Do you think he'll ever read the novels? I never could. That antiquated
  style, Vance, keeps me at arm's length."</p>

  <p>"A stiff style because he wrote so rapidly. But there's the greatest body
  and bone of character. Except for his heroes. Terry reminds me of them, in a
  way. No thought, not very much feeling, but a great capacity for physical
  action."</p>

  <p>"I think you'd like to be Terry's adviser," she said.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't aspire to the job," yawned Vance, "unless I could ride well
  and shoot well. If a man can't do that, he ceases to be a man in Terry's
  eyes. And if a woman can't talk pure English, she isn't a woman."</p>

  <p>"That's because he's young," said Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>"It's because he's a prig," sneered Vance. He had been drawn farther into
  the conversation than he planned; now he retreated carefully. "But another
  year or so may help him."</p>

  <p>He retreated before she could answer, but he left her thoughtful, as he
  hoped to do. He had a standing theory that the only way to make a woman
  meditate is to keep her from talking. And he wanted very much to make
  Elizabeth meditate the evil in the son of Black Jack. Otherwise all his plans
  might be useless and his seeds of destruction fall on barren soil. He was
  intensely afraid of that, anyway. His hope was to draw the boy and the
  sheriff together on the birthday and guide the two explosives until they met
  on the subject of the death of Black Jack. Either Terry would kill the
  sheriff, or the sheriff would kill Terry. Vance hoped for the latter, but
  rather expected the former to be the outcome, and if it were, he was inclined
  to think that Elizabeth would sooner or later make excuses for Terry and take
  him back into the fold of her affections. Accordingly, his work was, in the
  few days that intervened, to plant all the seeds of suspicion that he could.
  Then, when the denouement came, those seeds might blossom overnight into
  poison flowers.</p>

  <p>In the late afternoon he took up his position in an easy chair on the big
  veranda. The mail was delivered, as a rule, just before dusk, one of the cow-
  punchers riding down for it. Grave fears about the loss of that all-important
  missive to Terry haunted him, for the postmaster was a doddering old fellow
  who was quite apt to forget his head. Consequently he was vastly relieved
  when the mail arrived and Elizabeth brought the familiar big envelope out to
  him, with its typewritten address.</p>

  <p>"Looks like a business letter, doesn't it?" she asked Vance.</p>

  <p>"More or less," said Vance, covering a yawn of excitement.</p>

  <p>"But how on earth could any business&mdash;it's postmarked from
  Craterville."</p>

  <p>"Somebody may have heard about his prospects; they're starting early to
  separate him from his money."</p>

  <p>"Vance, how much talking did you do in Craterville?"</p>

  <p>It was hard to meet her keen old eyes.</p>

  <p>"Too much, I'm afraid," he said frankly. "You see, I've felt rather touchy
  about the thing. I want people to know that you and I have agreed on making
  Terry the heir to the ranch. I don't want anyone to suspect that we differed.
  I suppose I talked too much about the birthday plans."</p>

  <p>She sighed with vexation and weighed the letter in her hand.</p>

  <p>"I've half a mind to open it."</p>

  <p>His heartbeat fluttered and paused.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead," he urged, with well-assured carelessness.</p>

  <p>She shook down the contents of the envelope preparatory to opening it.</p>

  <p>"It's nothing but printed stuff, Vance. I can see that, through the
  envelope."</p>

  <p>"But wait a minute, Elizabeth. It might anger Terry to have even his
  business mail opened. He's touchy, you know."</p>

  <p>She hesitated, then shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you're right. Let it go." She laughed at her own concern over
  the matter. "Do you know, Vance, that sometimes I feel as if the whole world
  were conspiring to get a hand on Terry?"</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap8"
     name="chap8">CHAPTER 8</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Terry did not come down for dinner. It was more or less of a
  calamity, for the board was quite full of early guests for the next day's
  festivities. Aunt Elizabeth shifted the burden of the entertainment onto the
  capable shoulders of Vance, who could please these Westerners when he chose.
  Tonight he decidedly chose. Elizabeth had never see him in such high spirits.
  He could flirt good-humoredly and openly across the table at Nelly, or else
  turn and draw an anecdote from Nelly's father. He kept the reins in his hands
  and drove the talk along so smoothly that Elizabeth could sit in gloomy
  silence, unnoticed, at the farther end of the table. Her mind was up yonder
  in the room of Terry.</p>

  <p>Something had happened, and it had come through that long business
  envelope with the typewritten address that seemed so harmless. One reading of
  the contents had brought Terry out of his chair with an exclamation. Then,
  without explanation of any sort, he had gone to his room and stayed there.
  She would have followed to find out what was the matter, but the requirements
  of dinner and her guests kept her downstairs.</p>

  <p>Immediately after dinner Vance, at a signal from her, dexterously herded
  everyone into the living room and distributed them in comfort around the big
  fireplace; Elizabeth Cornish bolted straight for the room of Terence. She
  knocked and tried the door. To her astonishment, the knob turned, but the
  door did not open. She heard the click and felt the jar of the bolt. Terry
  had locked his door!</p>

  <p>A little thing to make her heart fall, one would say, but little things
  about Terry were great things to Elizabeth. In twenty-four years he had never
  locked his door. What could it mean?</p>

  <p>It was a moment before she could call, and she waited breathlessly. She
  was reassured by a quiet voice that answered her: "Just a moment. I'll
  open."</p>

  <p>The tone was so matter-of-fact that her heart, with one leap, came back to
  normal and tears of relief misted her eyes for an instant. Perhaps he was up
  here working out a surprise for the next day&mdash;he was full of tricks and
  surprises. That was unquestionably it. And he took so long in coming to the
  door because he was hiding the thing he had been working on. As for food, Wu
  Chi was his slave and would have smuggled a tray up to him. Presently the
  lock turned and the door opened.</p>

  <p>She could not see his face distinctly at first, the light was so strong
  behind him. Besides, she was more occupied in looking for the tray of food
  which would assure her that Terry was not suffering from some mental crisis
  that had made him forget even dinner. She found the tray, sure enough, but
  the food had not been touched.</p>

  <p>She turned on him with a new rush of alarm. And all her fears were
  realized. Terry had been fighting a hard battle and he was still fighting.
  About his eyes there was the look, half-dull and half-hard, that comes in the
  eyes of young people unused to pain. A worried, tense, hungry face. He took
  her arm and led her to the table. On it lay an article clipped out of a
  magazine. She looked down at it with unseeing eyes. The sheets were already
  much crumpled. Terry turned them to a full-page picture, and Elizabeth found
  herself looking down into the face of Black Jack, proud, handsome,
  defiant.</p>

  <p>Had Vance been there, he might have recognized her actions. As she had
  done one day twenty-four years ago, now she turned and dropped heavily into a
  chair, her bony hands pressed to her shallow bosom. A moment later she was on
  her feet again, ready to fight, ready to tell a thousand lies. But it was too
  late. The revelation had been complete and she could tell by his face that
  Terence knew everything.</p>

  <p>"Terry," she said faintly, "what on earth have you to do with that
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Listen, Aunt Elizabeth," he said, "you aren't going to fib about it, are
  you?"</p>

  <p>"What in the world are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>"Why were you so shocked?"</p>

  <p>She knew it was a futile battle. He was prying at her inner mind with
  short questions and a hard, dry voice.</p>

  <p>"It was the face of that terrible man. I saw him once before, you know. On
  the day&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"On the day he was murdered!"</p>

  <p>That word told her everything. "Murdered!" It lighted all the mental
  processes through which he had been going. Who in all the reaches of the
  mountain desert had ever before dreamed of terming the killing of the
  notorious Black Jack a "murder"?</p>

  <p>"What are you saying, Terence? That fellow&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hush! Look at us!"</p>

  <p>He picked up the photograph and stood back so that the light fell sharply
  on his face and on the photograph which he held beside his head. He caught up
  a sombrero and jammed it jauntily on his head. He tilted his face high, with
  resolute chin. And all at once there were two Black Jacks, not one. He
  evidently saw all the admission that he cared for in her face. He took off
  the hat with a dragging motion and replaced the photograph on the table.</p>

  <p>"I tried it in the mirror," he said quietly. "I wasn't quite sure until I
  tried it in the mirror. Then I knew, of course."</p>

  <p>She felt him slipping out of her life.</p>

  <p>"What shall I say to you, Terence?"</p>

  <p>"Is that my real name?"</p>

  <p>She winced. "Yes. Your real name."</p>

  <p>"Good. Do you remember our talk of today?"</p>

  <p>"What talk?"</p>

  <p>He drew his breath with something of a groan.</p>

  <p>"I said that what these people lacked was the influence of family&mdash;
  of old blood!"</p>

  <p>He made himself smile at her, and Elizabeth trembled. "If I could explain
  &mdash;" she began.</p>

  <p>"Ah, what is there to explain, Aunt Elizabeth? Except that you have been a
  thousand times kinder to me than I dreamed before. Why, I&mdash;I actually
  thought that you were rather honored by having a Colby under your roof. I
  really felt that I was bestowing something of a favor on you!"</p>

  <p>"Terry, sit down!"</p>

  <p>He sank into a chair slowly. And she sat on the arm of it with her
  mournful eyes on his face.</p>

  <p>"Whatever your name may be, that doesn't change the man who wears the
  name."</p>

  <p>He laughed softly. "And you've been teaching me steadily for twenty-four
  years that blood will tell? You can't change like this. Oh, I understand it
  perfectly. You determined to make me over. You determined to destroy my
  heritage and put the name of the fine old Colbys in its place. It was a brave
  thing to try, and all these years how you must have waited, and waited to see
  how I would turn out, dreading every day some outbreak of the bad blood! Ah,
  you have a nerve of steel, Aunt Elizabeth! How have you endured the
  suspense?"</p>

  <p>She felt that he was mocking her subtly under this flow of compliment. But
  it was the bitterness of pain, not of reproach, she knew.</p>

  <p>She said: "Why didn't you let me come up with you? Why didn't you send for
  me?"</p>

  <p>"I've been busy doing a thing that no one could help me with. I've been
  burning my dreams." He pointed to a smoldering heap of ashes on the
  hearth.</p>

  <p>"Terry!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, all the Colby pictures that I've been collecting for the past
  fifteen years. I burned 'em. They don't mean anything to anyone else, and
  certainly they have ceased to mean anything to me. But when I came to Anthony
  Colby&mdash;the eighteen-twelve man, you know, the one who has always been my
  hero&mdash;it went pretty hard. I felt as if&mdash;I were burning my own
  personality. As a matter of fact, in the last couple of hours I've been born
  over again."</p>

  <p>Terry paused. "And births are painful, Aunt Elizabeth!"</p>

  <p>At that she cried out and caught his hand. "Terry dear! Terry dear! You
  break my heart!"</p>

  <p>"I don't mean to. You mustn't think that I'm pitying myself. But I want to
  know the real name of my father. He must have had some name other than Black
  Jack. What was it?"</p>

  <p>"Are you going to gather his memory to your heart, Terry?"</p>

  <p>"I am going to find something about him that I can be proud of. Blood will
  tell. I know that I'm not all bad, and there must have been good in Black
  Jack. I want to know all about him. I want to know about&mdash;his
  crimes."</p>

  <p>He labored through a fierce moment of silent struggle while her heart went
  helplessly out to him.</p>

  <p>"Because&mdash;I had a hand in every one of those crimes! Everything that
  he did is something that I might have done under the same temptation."</p>

  <p>"But you're not all your father's son. You had a mother. A dear, sweet-
  faced girl&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't!" whispered Terry. "I suppose he broke&mdash;her heart?"</p>

  <p>"She was a very delicate girl," she said after a moment.</p>

  <p>"And now my father's name, please?"</p>

  <p>"Not that just now. Give me until tomorrow night, Terry. Will you do that?
  Will you wait till tomorrow night, Terry? I'm going to have a long talk with
  you then, about many things. And I want you to keep this in mind always. No
  matter how long you live, the influence of the Colbys will never go out of
  your life. And neither will my influence, I hope. If there is anything good
  in me, it has gone into you. I have seen to that. Terry, you are not your
  father's son alone. All these other things have entered into your make-up.
  They're just as much a part of you as his blood."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes," said Terry. "But blood will tell!"</p>

  <p>It was a mournful echo of a thing she had told him a thousand times.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap9"
     name="chap9">CHAPTER 9</a></h2>

  <p class="first">She went straight down to the big living room and drew Vance
  away, mindless of her guests. He came humming until he was past the door and
  in the shadowy hall. Then he touched her arm, suddenly grown serious.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong, Elizabeth?"</p>

  <p>Her voice was low, vibrating with fierceness. And Vance blessed the
  dimness of the hall, for he could feel the blood recede from his face and the
  sweat stand on his forehead.</p>

  <p>"Vance, if you've done what I think you've done, you're lower than a
  snake, and more poisonous and more treacherous. And I'll cut you out of my
  heart and my life. You know what I mean?"</p>

  <p>It was really the first important crisis that he had ever faced. And now
  his heart grew small, cold. He knew, miserably, his own cowardice. And like
  all cowards, he fell back on bold lying to carry him through. It was a
  triumph that he could make his voice steady&mdash;more than steady. He could
  even throw the right shade of disgust into it.</p>

  <p>"Is this another one of your tantrums, Elizabeth? By heavens, I'm growing
  tired of 'em. You continually throw in my face that you hold the strings of
  the purse. Well, tie them up as far as I'm concerned. I won't whine. I'd
  rather have that happen than be tyrannized over any longer."</p>

  <p>She was much shaken. And there was a sting in this reproach that carried
  home to her; there was just a sufficient edge of truth to wound her. Had
  there been much light, she could have read his face; the dimness of the hall
  was saving Vance, and he knew it.</p>

  <p>"God knows I'd like to believe that you haven't had anything to do with
  it. But you and I are the only two people in the world who know the secret of
  it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He pretended to guess. "It's something about Terence? Something about his
  father?"</p>

  <p>Again she was disarmed. If he were guilty, it was strange that he should
  approach the subject so openly. And she began to doubt.</p>

  <p>"Vance, he knows everything! Everything except the real name of Black
  Jack!"</p>

  <p>"Good heavens!"</p>

  <p>She strained her eyes through the shadows to make out his real expression;
  but there seemed to be a real horror in his restrained whisper.</p>

  <p>"It isn't possible, Elizabeth!"</p>

  <p>"It came in that letter. That letter I wanted to open, and which you
  persuaded me not to!" She mustered all her damning facts one after another.
  "And it was postmarked from Craterville. Vance, you have been in Craterville
  lately!"</p>

  <p>He seemed to consider.</p>

  <p>"Could I have told anyone? Could I, possibly? No, Elizabeth, I'll give you
  my word of honor that I've never spoken a syllable about that subject to
  anyone!"</p>

  <p>"Ah, but what have you written?"</p>

  <p>"I've never put pen to paper. But&mdash;how did it happen?"</p>

  <p>He had control of himself now. His voice was steadier. He could feel her
  recede from her aggressiveness.</p>

  <p>"It was dated after you left Craterville, of course. And&mdash;I can't
  stand imagining that you could be so low. Only, who else would have a
  motive?"</p>

  <p>"But how was it done?"</p>

  <p>"They sent him an article about his father and a picture of Black Jack
  that happens to look as much like Terry as two peas."</p>

  <p>"Then I have it! If the picture looks like Terry, someone took it for
  granted that he'd be interested in the similarity. That's why it was sent.
  Unless they told him that he was really Black Jack's son. Did the person who
  sent the letter do that?"</p>

  <p>"There was no letter. Only a magazine clipping and the photograph of the
  painting."</p>

  <p>They were both silent. Plainly she had dismissed all idea of her brother's
  guilt.</p>

  <p>"But what are we going to do, Elizabeth? And how has he taken it?"</p>

  <p>"Like poison, Vance. He&mdash;he burned all the Colby pictures. Oh, Vance,
  twenty-four years of work are thrown away!"</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! This will all straighten out. I'm glad he's found out. Sooner
  or later he was pretty sure to. Such things will come to light."</p>

  <p>"Vance, you'll help me? You'll forgive me for accusing you, and you'll
  help me to keep Terry in hand for the next few days? You see, he declared
  that he will not be ashamed of his father."</p>

  <p>"You can't blame him for that."</p>

  <p>"God knows I blame no one but myself."</p>

  <p>"I'll help you with every ounce of strength in my mind and body, my
  dear."</p>

  <p>She pressed his hand in silence.</p>

  <p>"I'm going up to talk with him now," he said. "I'm going to do what I can
  with him. You go in and talk. And don't let them see that anything is
  wrong."</p>

  <p>The door had not been locked again. He entered at the call of Terry and
  found him leaning over the hearth stirring up the pile of charred paper to
  make it burn more freely. A shadow crossed the face of Terry as he saw his
  visitor, but he banished it at once and rose to greet him. In his heart Vance
  was a little moved. He went straight to the younger man and took his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Elizabeth has told me," he said gently, and he looked with a moist eye
  into the face of the man who, if his plans worked out, would be either
  murderer or murdered before the close of the next day. "I am very sorry,
  Terence."</p>

  <p>"I thought you came to congratulate me," said Terry, withdrawing his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Congratulate you?" echoed Vance, with unaffected astonishment.</p>

  <p>"For having learned the truth," said Terry. "Also, for having a father who
  was a strong man."</p>

  <p>Vance could not resist the opening.</p>

  <p>"In a way, I suppose he was," he said dryly. "And if you look at it in
  that way, I do congratulate you, Terence!"</p>

  <p>"You've always hated me, Uncle Vance," Terry declared. "I've known it all
  these years. And I'll do without your congratulations."</p>

  <p>"You're wrong, Terry," said Vance. He kept his voice mild. "You're very
  wrong. But I'm old enough not to take offense at what a young spitfire
  says."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you are," retorted Terry, in a tone which implied that he
  himself would never reach that age.</p>

  <p>"And when a few years run by," went on Vance, "you'll change your
  viewpoint. In the meantime, my boy, let me give you this warning. No matter
  what you think about me, it is Elizabeth who counts."</p>

  <p>"Thanks. You need have no fear about my attitude to Aunt Elizabeth. You
  ought to know that I love her, and respect her."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. But you're headstrong, Terry. Very headstrong. And so is
  Elizabeth. Take your own case. She took you into the family for the sake of a
  theory. Did you know that?"</p>

  <p>The boy stiffened. "A theory?"</p>

  <p>"Quite so. She wished to prove that blood, after all, was more talk than a
  vital influence. So she took you in and gave you an imaginary line of
  ancestors with which you were entirely contented. But, after all, it has been
  twenty-four years of theory rather than twenty-four years of Terry. You
  understand?"</p>

  <p>"It's a rather nasty thing to hear," said Terence huskily. "Perhaps you're
  right. I don't know. Perhaps you're right."</p>

  <p>"And if her theory is proved wrong&mdash;look out, Terry! She'll throw you
  out of her life without a second thought."</p>

  <p>"Is that a threat?"</p>

  <p>"My dear boy, not by any means. You think I have hated you? Not at all. I
  have simply been indifferent. Now that you are in more or less trouble, you
  see that I come to you. And hereafter if there should be a crisis, you will
  see who is your true friend. Now, good night!"</p>

  <p>He had saved his most gracious speech until the very end, and after it he
  retired at once to leave Terence with the pleasant memory in his mind. For he
  had in his mind the idea of a perfect crime for which he would not be
  punished. He would turn Terry into a corpse or a killer, and in either case
  the youngster would never dream who had dealt the blow.</p>

  <p>No wonder, then, as he went downstairs, that he stepped onto the veranda
  for a few moments. The moon was just up beyond Mount Discovery; the valley
  unfolded like a dream. Never had the estate seemed so charming to Vance
  Cornish, for he felt that his hand was closing slowly around his
  inheritance.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap10"
     name="chap10">CHAPTER 10</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The sleep of the night seemed to blot out the excitement of
  the preceding evening. A bright sun, a cool stir of air, brought in the next
  morning, and certainly calamity had never seemed farther from the Cornish
  ranch than it did on this day. All through the morning people kept arriving
  in ones and twos. Every buckboard on the place was commissioned to haul the
  guests around the smooth roads and show them the estate; and those who
  preferred were furnished with saddle horses from the stable to keep their own
  mounts fresh for their return trip. Vance took charge of the wagon parties;
  Terence himself guided the horsemen, and he rode El Sangre, a flashing streak
  of blood red.</p>

  <p>The exercise brought the color to his face; the wind raised his spirits;
  and when the gathering at the house to wait for the big dinner began, he was
  as gay as any.</p>

  <p>"That's the way with young people," Elizabeth confided to her brother.
  "Trouble slips off their minds."</p>

  <p>And then the second blow fell, the blow on which Vance had counted for his
  great results. No less a person than Sheriff Joe Minter galloped up and threw
  his reins before the veranda. He approached Elizabeth with a high flourish of
  his hat and a profound bow, for Uncle Joe Minter affected the mannered
  courtesy of the "Southern" school. Vance had them in profile from the side,
  and his nervous glance flickered from one to the other. The sheriff was
  plainly pleased with what he had seen on his way up Bear Creek. He was also
  happy to be present at so large a gathering. But to Elizabeth his coming was
  like a death. Her brother could tell the difference between her forced
  cordiality and the real thing. She had his horse put up; presented him to the
  few people whom he had not met, and then left him posing for the crowd of
  admirers. Life to the sheriff was truly a stage. Then Elizabeth went to
  Vance.</p>

  <p>"You saw?" she gasped.</p>

  <p>"Sheriff Minter? What of it? Rather nervy of the old ass to come up here
  for the party; he hardly knows us."</p>

  <p>"No, no! Not that! But don't you remember? Don't you remember what Joe
  Minter did?"</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" gasped Vance, apparently just recalling. "He killed Black
  Jack! And what will Terry do when he finds out?"</p>

  <p>She grew still whiter, hearing him name her own fear.</p>

  <p>"They mustn't meet," she said desperately. "Vance, if you're half a man
  you'll find some way of getting that pompous, windy idiot off the place."</p>

  <p>"My dear! Do you want me to invite him to leave?"</p>

  <p>"Something&mdash;I don't care what!"</p>

  <p>"Neither do I. But I can't insult the fool. That type resents an insult
  with gunplay. We must simply keep them apart. Keep the sheriff from
  talking."</p>

  <p>"Keep rain from falling!" groaned Elizabeth. "Vance, if you won't do
  anything, I'll go and tell the sheriff that he must leave!"</p>

  <p>"You don't mean it!"</p>

  <p>"Do you think that I'm going to risk a murder?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose you're right," nodded Vance, changing his tactics with
  Machiavellian smoothness. "If Terry saw the man who killed his father, all
  his twenty-four years of training would go up in smoke and the blood of his
  father would talk in him. There'd be a shooting!"</p>

  <p>She caught a hand to her throat. "I'm not so sure of that, Vance. I think
  he would come through this acid test. But I don't want to take chances."</p>

  <p>"I don't blame you, Elizabeth," said her brother heartily. "Neither would
  I. But if the sheriff stays here, I feel that I'm going to win the bet that I
  made twenty-four years ago. You remember? That Terry would shoot a man before
  he was twenty-five?"</p>

  <p>"Have I ever forgotten?" she said huskily. "Have I ever let it go out of
  my mind? But it isn't the danger of Terry shooting. It's the danger of Terry
  being shot. If he should reach for a gun against the sheriff&mdash;that
  professional mankiller&mdash;Vance, something has to be done!"</p>

  <p>"Right," he nodded. "I wouldn't trust Terry in the face of such a
  temptation to violence. Not for a moment!"</p>

  <p>The natural stubbornness on which he had counted hardened in her face.</p>

  <p>"I don't know."</p>

  <p>"It would be an acid test, Elizabeth. But perhaps now is the time. You've
  spent twenty-four years training him. If he isn't what he ought to be now, he
  never will be, no doubt."</p>

  <p>"It may be that you're right," she said gloomily. "Twenty-four years! Yes,
  and I've filled about half of my time with Terry and his training. Vance, you
  are right. If he has the elements of a mankiller in him after what I've done
  for him, then he's a hopeless case. The sheriff shall stay! The sheriff shall
  stay!"</p>

  <p>She kept repeating it, as though the repetition of the phrase might bring
  her courage. And then she went back among her guests.</p>

  <p>As for Vance, he remained skillfully in the background that day. It was
  peculiarly vital, this day of all days, that he should not be much in
  evidence. No one must see in him a controlling influence.</p>

  <p>In the meantime he watched his sister with a growing admiration and with a
  growing concern. Instantly she had a problem on her hands. For the moment
  Terence heard that the great sheriff himself had joined the party, he was
  filled with happiness. Vance watched them meet with a heart swelling with
  happiness and surety of success. Straight through a group came Terry, weaving
  his way eagerly, and went up to the sheriff. Vance saw Elizabeth attempt to
  detain him, attempt to send him on an errand. But he waved her suggestion
  away for a moment and made for the sheriff. Elizabeth, seeing that the
  meeting could not be avoided, at least determined to be present at it. She
  came up with Terence and presented him.</p>

  <p>"Sheriff Minter, this is Terence Colby."</p>

  <p>"I've heard of you, Colby," said the sheriff kindly. And he waited for a
  response with the gleaming eye of a vain man. There was not long to wait.</p>

  <p>"You've really heard of me?" said Terry, immensely pleased. "By the Lord,
  I've heard of you, sheriff! But, of course, everybody has."</p>

  <p>"I dunno, son," said the sheriff benevolently. "But I been drifting around
  a tolerable long time, I guess."</p>

  <p>"Why," said Terry, with a sort of outburst, "I've simply eaten up
  everything I could gather. I've even read about you in magazines!"</p>

  <p>"Well, now you don't say," protested the sheriff. "In magazines?"</p>

  <p>And his eye quested through the group, hoping for other listeners who
  might learn how broadly the fame of their sheriff was spread.</p>

  <p>"That Canning fellow who travelled out West and ran into you and was along
  while you were hunting down the Garrison boys. I read his article."</p>

  <p>The sheriff scratched his chin. "I disremember him. Canning? Canning? Come
  to think of it, I do remember him. Kind of a small man with washed-out eyes.
  Always with a notebook on his knee. I got sick of answering all that gent's
  questions, I recollect. Yep, he was along when I took the Garrison boys, but
  that little party didn't amount to much."</p>

  <p>"He thought it did," said Terry fervently. "Said it was the bravest,
  coolest-headed, cunningest piece of work he'd ever seen done. Perhaps you'll
  tell me some of the other things&mdash;the things you count big?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I ain't done nothing much, come to think of it. All pretty simple,
  they looked to me, when I was doing them. Besides, I ain't much of a hand at
  talk!"</p>

  <p>"Ah," said Terry, "you'd talk well enough to suit me, sheriff!"</p>

  <p>The sheriff had found a listener after his own heart.</p>

  <p>"There ain't nothing but a campfire that gives a good light to see a story
  by&mdash;the kind of stories I got to tell," he declared. "Some of these days
  I'll take you along with me on a trail, son, if you'd like&mdash; and most
  like I'll talk your arm off at night beside the fire. Like to come?"</p>

  <p>"Like to?" cried Terry. "I'd be the happiest man in the mountains!"</p>

  <p>"Would you, now? Well, Colby, you and me might hit it off pretty well.
  I've heard tell you ain't half bad with a rifle and pretty slick with a
  revolver, too."</p>

  <p>"I practice hard," said Terry frankly. "I love guns."</p>

  <p>"Good things to love, and good things to hate, too," philosophized the
  sheriff. "But all right in their own place, which ain't none too big, these
  days. The old times is gone when a man went out into the world with a hoss
  under him, and a pair of Colts strapped to his waist, and made his own way.
  Them days is gone, and our younger boys is going to pot!"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," admitted Terry.</p>

  <p>"But you got a spark in you, son. Well, one of these days we'll get
  together. And I hear tell you got El Sangre?"</p>

  <p>"I was lucky," said Terry.</p>

  <p>"That's a sizable piece of work, Colby. I've seen twenty that run El
  Sangre, and never even got close enough to eat his dust. Nacheral pacer,
  right enough. I've seen him kite across country like a train! And his mane
  and tail blowing like smoke!"</p>

  <p>"I got him with patience. That was all."</p>

  <p>"S'pose we take a look at him?"</p>

  <p>"By all means. Just come along with me."</p>

  <p>Elizabeth struck in.</p>

  <p>"Just a moment, Terence. There's Mr. Gainor, and he's been asking to see
  you. You can take the sheriff out to see El Sangre later. Besides, half a
  dozen people want to talk to the sheriff, and you mustn't monopolize him.
  Miss Wickson begged me to get her a chance to talk to you&mdash;the real
  Sheriff Minter. Do you mind?"</p>

  <p>"Pshaw," said the sheriff. "I ain't no kind of a hand at talking to the
  womenfolk. Where is she?"</p>

  <p>"Down yonder, sheriff. Shall we go?"</p>

  <p>"The old lady with the cane?"</p>

  <p>"No, the girl with the bright hair."</p>

  <p>"Doggone me," muttered the sheriff. "Well, let's saunter down that
  way."</p>

  <p>He waved to Terence, who, casting a black glance in the direction of Mr.
  Gainor, went off to execute Elizabeth's errand. Plainly Elizabeth had won the
  first engagement, but Vance was still confident. The dinner table would tell
  the tale.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap11"
     name="chap11">CHAPTER 11</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Elizabeth left the ordering of the guests at the table to
  Vance, and she consulted him about it as they went into the dining room. It
  was a long, low- ceilinged room, with more windows than wall space. It opened
  onto a small porch, and below the porch was the garden which had been the
  pride of Henry Cornish. Beside the tall glass doors which led out onto the
  porch she reviewed the seating plans of Vance. "You at this end and I at the
  other," he said. "I've put the sheriff beside you, and right across from the
  sheriff is Nelly. She ought to keep him busy. The old idiot has a weakness
  for pretty girls, and the younger the better, it seems. Next to the sheriff
  is Mr. Gainor. He's a political power, and what time the sheriff doesn't
  spend on you and on Nelly he certainly will give to Gainor. The arrangement
  of the rest doesn't matter. I simply worked to get the sheriff well-pocketed
  and keep him under your eye."</p>

  <p>"But why not under yours, Vance? You're a thousand times more diplomatic
  than I am."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't take the responsibility, for, after all, this may turn out to
  be a rather solemn occasion, Elizabeth."</p>

  <p>"You don't think so, Vance?"</p>

  <p>"I pray not."</p>

  <p>"And where have you put Terence?"</p>

  <p>"Next to Nelly, at your left."</p>

  <p>"Good heavens, Vance, that's almost directly opposite the sheriff. You'll
  have them practically facing each other."</p>

  <p>It was the main thing he was striving to attain. He placated her
  carefully.</p>

  <p>"I had to. There's a danger. But the advantage is huge. You'll be there
  between them, you might say. You can keep the table talk in hand at that end.
  Flash me a signal if you're in trouble, and I'll fire a question down the
  table at the sheriff or Terry, and get their attention. In the meantime you
  can draw Terry into talk with you if he begins to ask the sheriff what you
  consider leading questions. In that way, you'll keep the talk a thousand
  leagues away from the death of Black Jack."</p>

  <p>He gained his point without much more trouble. Half an hour later the
  table was surrounded by the guests. It was a table of baronial proportions,
  but twenty couples occupied every inch of the space easily. Vance found
  himself a greater distance than he could have wished from the scene of
  danger, and of electrical contact.</p>

  <p>At least four zones of cross-fire talk intervened, and the talk at the
  farther end of the table was completely lost to him, except when some new and
  amazing dish, a triumph of Wu Chi's fabrication, was brought on, and an
  appreciative wave of silence attended it.</p>

  <p>Or again, the mighty voice of the sheriff was heard to bellow forth in
  laughter of heroic proportions.</p>

  <p>Aside from that, there was no information he could gather except by his
  eyes. And chiefly, the face of Elizabeth. He knew her like a book in which he
  had often read. Twice he read the danger signals. When the great roast was
  being removed, he saw her eyes widen and her lips contract a trifle, and he
  knew that someone had come very close to the danger line indeed. Again when
  dessert was coming in bright shoals on the trays of the Chinese servants, the
  glance of his sister fixed on him down the length of the table with a grim
  appeal. He made a gesture of helplessness. Between them four distinct groups
  into which the table talk had divided were now going at full blast. He could
  hardly have made himself heard at the other end of the table without
  shouting.</p>

  <p>Yet that crisis also passed away. Elizabeth was working hard, but as the
  meal progressed toward a close, he began to worry. It had seemed impossible
  that the sheriff could actually sit this length of time in such an assemblage
  without launching into the stories for which he was famous. Above all, he
  would be sure to tell how he had started on his career as a manhunter by
  relating how he slew Black Jack.</p>

  <p>Once the appalling thought came to Vance that the story must have been
  told during one of those moments when his sister had shown alarm. The crisis
  might be over, and Terry had indeed showed a restraint which was a credit to
  Elizabeth's training. But by the hunted look in her eyes, he knew that the
  climax had not yet been reached, and that she was continually fighting it
  away.</p>

  <p>He writhed with impatience. If he had not been a fool, he would have taken
  that place himself, and then he could have seen to it that the sheriff, with
  dexterous guiding, should approach the fatal story. As it was, how could he
  tell that Elizabeth might not undo all his plans and cleverly keep the
  sheriff away from his favorite topic for an untold length of time? But as he
  told his sister, he wished to place all the seeming responsibility on her own
  shoulders. Perhaps he had played too safe.</p>

  <p>The first ray of hope came to him as coffee was brought in. The prodigious
  eating of the cattlemen and miners at the table had brought them to a stupor.
  They no longer talked, but puffed with unfamiliar awkwardness at the fine
  Havanas which Vance had provided. Even the women talked less, having worn off
  the edge of the novelty of actually dining at the table of Elizabeth Cornish.
  And since the hostess was occupied solely with the little group nearest her,
  and there was no guiding mind to pick up the threads of talk in each group
  and maintain it, this duty fell more and more into the hands of Vance. He
  took up his task with pleasure.</p>

  <p>Farther and farther down the table extended the sphere of his mild
  influence. He asked Mr. Wainwright to tell the story of how he treed the bear
  so that the tenderfoot author could come and shoot it. Mr. Wainwright
  responded with gusto. The story was a success. He varied it by requesting
  young Dobel to describe the snowslide which had wiped out the Vorheimer shack
  the winter before.</p>

  <p>Young Dobel did well enough to make the men grunt at the end, and he
  brought several little squeals of horror from the ladies.</p>

  <p>All of this was for a purpose. Vance was setting the precedent, and they
  were becoming used to hearing stories. At the end of each tale the silence of
  expectation was longer and wider. Finally, it reached the other end of the
  table, and suddenly the sheriff discovered that tales were going the rounds,
  and that he had not yet been heard. He rolled his eye with an inward look,
  and Vance knew that he was searching for some smooth means of introducing one
  of his yarns.</p>

  <p>Victory!</p>

  <p>But here Elizabeth cut trenchantly into the heart of the conversation. She
  had seen and understood. She shot home half a dozen questions with the
  accuracy of a marksman, and beat up a drumfire of responses from the ladies
  which, for a time, rattled up and down the length of the table. The sheriff
  was biting his mustache thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>It was only a momentary check, however. Just at the point where Vance
  began to despair of ever effecting his goal, the silence began again as lady
  after lady ran out of material for the nonce. And as the silence spread, the
  sheriff was visibly gathering steam.</p>

  <p>Again Elizabeth cut in. But this time there was only a sporadic chattering
  in response. Coffee was steaming before them, Wu Chi's powerful, thick,
  aromatic coffee, which only he knew how to make. They were in a mood, now, to
  hear stories, that tableful of people. An expected ally came to the aid of
  Vance. It was Terence, who had been eating his heart out during the silly
  table talk of the past few minutes. Now he seized upon the first clear
  opening.</p>

  <p>"Sheriff Minter, I've heard a lot about the time you ran down Johnny
  Garden. But I've never had the straight of it. Won't you tell us how it
  happened?"</p>

  <p>"Oh," protested the sheriff, "it don't amount to much."</p>

  <p>Elizabeth cast one frantic glance at her brother, and strove to edge into
  the interval of silence with a question directed at Mr. Gainor. But he
  shelved that question; the whole table was obviously waiting for the great
  man to speak. A dozen appeals for the yarn poured in.</p>

  <p>"Well," said the sheriff, "if you folks are plumb set on it, I'll tell you
  just how it come about."</p>

  <p>There followed a long story of how Johnny Garden had announced that he
  would ride down and shoot up the sheriff's own town, and then get away on the
  sheriff's own horse&mdash;and how he did it. And how the sheriff was laughed
  at heartily by the townsfolk, and how the whole mountain district joined in
  the laughter. And how he started out single-handed in the middle of winter to
  run down Johnny Garden, and struck through the mountains, was caught above
  the timberline in a terrific blizzard, kept on in peril of his life until he
  barely managed to reach the timber again on the other side of the ridge. How
  he descended upon the hiding-place of Johnny Garden, found Johnny gone, but
  his companions there, and made a bargain with them to let them go if they
  would consent to stand by and offer no resistance when he fought with Johnny
  on the latter's return. How they were as good as their word and how, when
  Johnny returned, they stood aside and let Johnny and the sheriff fight it
  out. How the sheriff beat Johnny to the draw, but was wounded in the left arm
  while Johnny fired a second shot as he lay dying on the floor of the lean-to.
  How the sheriff's wound was dressed by the companions of the dead Johnny, and
  how he was safely dismissed with honor, as between brave men, and how
  afterwards he hunted those same men down one by one.</p>

  <p>It was quite a long story, but the audience followed it with a breathless
  interest.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," concluded the sheriff, as the applause of murmurs fell off.
  "And from yarns like that one you wouldn't never figure it that I was the son
  of a minister brung up plumb peaceful. Now, would you?"</p>

  <p>And again, to the intense joy of Vance, it was Terry who brought the
  subject back, and this time the subject of all subjects which Elizabeth
  dreaded, and which Vance longed for.</p>

  <p>"Tell us how you came to branch out, Sheriff Minter?"</p>

  <p>"It was this way," began the sheriff, while Elizabeth cast at Vance a
  glance of frantic and weary appeal, to which he responded with a gesture
  which indicated that the cause was lost.</p>

  <p>"I was brung up mighty proper. I had a most amazing lot of prayers at the
  tip of my tongue when I wasn't no more'n knee-high to a grasshopper. But when
  a man has got a fire in him, they ain't no use trying to smother it. You
  either got to put water on it or else let it burn itself out.</p>

  <p>"My old man didn't see it that way. When I got to cutting up he'd try to
  smother it, and stop me by saying: 'Don't!' Which don't accomplish nothing
  with young gents that got any spirit. Not a damn thing&mdash;asking your
  pardon, ladies! Well, sirs, he kept me in harness, you might say, and pulling
  dead straight down the road and working hard and faithful. But all the time
  I'd been saving up steam, and swelling and swelling and getting pretty near
  ready to bust.</p>

  <p>"Well, sirs, pretty soon&mdash;we was living in Garrison City them days,
  when Garrison wasn't near the town that it is now&mdash;along comes word that
  Jack Hollis is around. A lot of you younger folks ain't never heard nothing
  about him. But in his day Jack Hollis was as bad as they was made. They was
  nothing that Jack wouldn't turn to real handy, from shootin' up a town to
  sticking up a train or a stage. And he done it all just about as well. He was
  one of them universal experts. He could blow a safe as neat as you'd ask. And
  if it come to a gun fight, he was greased lightning with a flying start. That
  was Jack Hollis."</p>

  <p>The sheriff paused to draw breath.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said Elizabeth Cornish, white about the lips, "we had better go
  into the living room to hear the rest of the sheriff's story?"</p>

  <p>It was not a very skillful diversion, but Elizabeth had reached the point
  of utter desperation. And on the way into the living room unquestionably she
  would be able to divert Terry to something else. Vance held his breath.</p>

  <p>And it was Terry who signed his own doom.</p>

  <p>"We're very comfortable here, Aunt Elizabeth. Let's not go in till the
  sheriff has finished his story."</p>

  <p>The sheriff rewarded him with a flash of gratitude, and Vance settled back
  in his chair. The end could not, now, be far away.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap12"
     name="chap12">CHAPTER 12</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"I was saying," proceeded the sheriff, "that they scared
  their babies in these here parts with the name of Jack Hollis. Which they
  sure done. Well, sir, he was bad."</p>

  <p>"Not all bad, surely," put in Vance. "I've heard a good many stories about
  the generosity of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was anxious to put in the name of Black Jack, since the sheriff was
  sticking so close to "Jack Hollis," which was a name that Terry had not yet
  heard for his dead father. But before he could get out the name, the sheriff,
  angry at the interruption, resumed the smooth current of his tale with a side
  flash at Vance.</p>

  <p>"Not all bad, you say? Generous? Sure he was generous. Them that live
  outside the law has got to be generous to keep a gang around 'em. Not that
  Hollis ever played with a gang much, but he had hangers-on all over the
  mountains and gents that he had done good turns for and hadn't gone off and
  talked about it. But that was just common sense. He knew he'd need friends
  that he could trust if he ever got in trouble. If he was wounded, they had to
  be someplace where he could rest up. Ain't that so? Well, sir, that's what
  the goodness of Jack Hollis amounted to. No, sir, he was bad. Plumb bad and
  all bad!</p>

  <p>"But he had them qualities that a young gent with an imagination is apt to
  cotton to. He was free with his money. He dressed like a dandy. He'd gamble
  with hundreds, and then give back half of his winnings if he'd broke the gent
  that run the bank. Them was the sort of things that Jack Hollis would do. And
  I had my head full of him. Well, about the time that he come to the
  neighborhood, I sneaked out of the house one night and went off to a dance
  with a girl that I was sweet on. And when I come back, I found Dad waiting up
  for me ready to skin me alive. He tried to give me a clubbing. I kicked the
  stick out of his hands and swore that I'd leave and never come back. Which I
  never done, living up to my word proper.</p>

  <p>"But when I found myself outside in the night, I says to myself: 'Where
  shall I go now?'</p>

  <p>"And then, being sort of sick at the world, and hating Dad particular, I
  decided to go out and join Jack Hollis. I was going to go bad. Mostly to cut
  up Dad, I reckon, and not because I wanted to particular.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't hard to find Jack Hollis. Not for a kid my age that was sure
  not to be no officer of the law. Besides, they didn't go out single and hunt
  for Hollis. They went in gangs of a half a dozen at a time, or more if they
  could get 'em. And even then they mostly got cleaned up when they cornered
  Hollis. Yes, sir, he made life sad for the sheriffs in them parts that he
  favored most.</p>

  <p>"I found Jack toasting bacon over a fire. He had two gents with him, and
  they brung me in, finding me sneaking around like a fool kid instead of
  walking right into camp. Jack sized me up a minute. He was a fine-looking
  boy, was Hollis. He gimme a look out of them fine black eyes of his which I
  won't never forget. Aye, a handsome scoundrel, that Hollis!"</p>

  <p>Elizabeth Cornish sank back in her chair and covered her eyes with her
  hands for a moment. To the others it seemed that she was merely rubbing weary
  eyes. But her brother knew perfectly that she was near to fainting.</p>

  <p>He looked at Terry and saw that the boy was following the tale with
  sparkling eyes.</p>

  <p>"I like what you say about this Hollis, sheriff," he ventured softly.</p>

  <p>"Do you? Well, so did I like what I seen of him that night, for all I knew
  that he was a no-good, man-killing, heartless sort. I told him right off that
  I wanted to join him. I even up and give him an exhibition of shooting.</p>

  <p>"What do you think he says to me? 'You go home to your ma, young man!'</p>

  <p>"That's what he said.</p>

  <p>"'I ain't a baby,' says I to Jack Hollis. 'I'm a grown man. I'm ready to
  fight your way.'</p>

  <p>"'Any fool can fight,' says Jack Hollis. 'But a gent with any sense don't
  have to fight. You can lay to that, son!'</p>

  <p>"'Don't call me son,' says I. 'I'm older than you was when you started
  out.'</p>

  <p>"I'd had my heart busted before I started,' says Jack Hollis to me. 'Are
  you as old as that, son? You go back home and don't bother me no more. I'll
  come back in five years and see if you're still in the same mind!'</p>

  <p>"And that was what I seen of Jack Hollis.</p>

  <p>"I went back into town&mdash;Garrison City. I slept over the stables the
  rest of that night. The next day I loafed around town not hardly noways
  knowing what I was going to do.</p>

  <p>"Then I was loafing around with my rifle, like I was going out on a
  hunting trip that afternoon. And pretty soon I heard a lot of noise coming
  down the street, guns and what not. I look out the window and there comes
  Jack Hollis, hellbent! Jack Hollis! And then it pops into my head that they
  was a big price, for them days, on Jack's head. I picked up my gun and eased
  it over the sill of the window and got a good bead.</p>

  <p>"Jack turned in his saddle&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There was a faint groan from Elizabeth Cornish. All eyes focused on her in
  amazement. She mustered a smile. The story went on.</p>

  <p>"When Jack turned to blaze away at them that was piling out around the
  corner of the street, I let the gun go, and I drilled him clean. Great
  sensation, gents, to have a life under your trigger. Just beckon one mite of
  an inch and a life goes scooting up to heaven or down to hell. I never got
  over seeing Hollis spill sidewise out of that saddle. There he was a minute
  before better'n any five men when it come to fighting. And now he wasn't
  nothing but a lot of trouble to bury. Just so many pounds of flesh. You see?
  Well, sir, the price on Black Jack set me up in life and gimme my start.
  After that I sort of specialized in manhunting, and I've kept on ever
  since."</p>

  <p>Terry leaned across the table, his left arm outstretched to call the
  sheriff's attention.</p>

  <p>"I didn't catch that last name, sheriff," he said.</p>

  <p>The talk was already beginning to bubble up at the end of the sheriff's
  tale. But there was something in the tone of the boy that cut through the
  talk to its root. People were suddenly looking at him out of eyes which were
  very wide indeed. And it was not hard to find a reason. His handsome face was
  colorless, like a carving from the stone, and under his knitted brows his
  black eyes were ominous in the shadow. The sheriff frankly gaped at him. It
  was another man who sat across the table in the chair where the ingenuous
  youth had been a moment before.</p>

  <p>"What name? Jack Hollis?"</p>

  <p>"I think the name you used was Black Jack, sheriff?"</p>

  <p>"Black Jack? Sure. That was the other name for Jack Hollis. He was mostly
  called Black Jack for short, but that was chiefly among his partners. Outside
  he was called Jack Hollis, which was his real name."</p>

  <p>Terence rose from his chair, more colorless than ever, the knuckles of one
  hand resting upon the table. He seemed very tall, years older, grim.</p>

  <p>"Terry!" called Elizabeth Cornish softly.</p>

  <p>It was like speaking to a stone.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," said Terry, though his eyes never left the face of the
  sheriff, and it was obvious that he was making his speech to one pair of ears
  alone. "I have been living among you under the name of Colby&mdash;Terence
  Colby. It seems an appropriate moment to say that this is not my name. After
  what the sheriff has just told you it may be of interest to know that my real
  name is Hollis. Terence Hollis is my name and my father was Jack Hollis,
  commonly known as Black Jack, it seems from the story of the sheriff. I also
  wish to say that I am announcing my parentage not because I wish to apologize
  for it&mdash;in spite of the rather remarkable narrative of the sheriff
  &mdash;but because I am proud of it."</p>

  <p>He lifted his head while he spoke. And his eye went boldly, calmly down
  the table.</p>

  <p>"This could not have been expected before, because none of you knew my
  father's name. I confess that I did not know it myself until a very short
  time ago. Otherwise I should not have listened to the sheriff's story until
  the end. Hereafter, however, when any of you are tempted to talk about Black
  or Jack Hollis, remember that his son is alive&mdash;and in good health!"</p>

  <p>He hung in his place for an instant as though he were ready to hear a
  reply. But the table was stunned. Then Terry turned on his heel and left the
  room.</p>

  <p>It was the signal for a general upstarting from the table, a pushing back
  of chairs, a gathering around Elizabeth Cornish. She was as white as Terry
  had been while he talked. But there was a gathering excitement in her eye,
  and happiness. The sheriff was full of apologies. He would rather have had
  his tongue torn out by the roots than to have offended her or the young man
  with his story.</p>

  <p>She waved the sheriff's apology aside. It was unfortunate, but it could
  not have been helped. They all realized that. She guided her guests into the
  living room, and on the way she managed to drift close to her brother.</p>

  <p>Her eyes were on fire with her triumph.</p>

  <p>"You heard, Vance? You saw what he did?"</p>

  <p>There was a haunted look about the face of Vance, who had seen his high-
  built schemes topple about his head.</p>

  <p>"He did even better than I expected, Elizabeth. Thank heaven for it!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap13"
     name="chap13">CHAPTER 13</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Terence Hollis had gone out of the room and up the stairs
  like a man stunned or walking in his sleep. Not until he stepped into the
  familiar room did the blood begin to return to his face, and with the warmth
  there was a growing sensation of uneasiness.</p>

  <p>Something was wrong. Something had to be righted. Gradually his mind
  cleared. The thing that was wrong was that the man who had killed his father
  was now under the same roof with him, had shaken his hand, had sat in bland
  complacency and looked in his face and told of the butchery.</p>

  <p>Butchery it was, according to Terry's standards. For the sake of the price
  on the head of the outlaw, young Minter had shoved his rifle across a window
  sill, taken his aim, and with no risk to himself had shot down the wild
  rider. His heart stood up in his throat with revulsion at the thought of it.
  Murder, horrible, and cold-blooded, the more horrible because it was
  legal.</p>

  <p>Something had to be done. What was it?</p>

  <p>And when he turned, what he saw was the gun cabinet with a shimmer of
  light on the barrels. Then he knew. He selected his favorite Colt and drew it
  out. It was loaded, and the action in perfect condition. Many and many an
  hour he had practiced and blazed away hundreds of rounds of ammunition with
  it. It responded to his touch like a muscular part of his own body.</p>

  <p>He shoved it under his coat, and walking down the stairs again the chill
  of the steel worked through to his flesh. He went back to the kitchen and
  called out Wu Chi. The latter came shuffling in his slippers, nodding,
  grinning in anticipation of compliments.</p>

  <p>"Wu," came the short demand, "can you keep your mouth shut and do what
  you're told to do?"</p>

  <p>"Wu try," said the Chinaman, grave as a yellow image instantly.</p>

  <p>"Then go to the living room and tell Mr. Gainor and Sheriff Minter that
  Mr. Harkness is waiting for them outside and wishes to see them on business
  of the most urgent nature. It will only be the matter of a moment. Now go.
  Gainor and the sheriff. Don't forget."</p>

  <p>He received a scared glance, and then went out onto the veranda and sat
  down to wait.</p>

  <p>That was the right way, he felt. His father would have called the sheriff
  to the door, in a similar situation, and after one brief challenge they would
  have gone for their guns. But there was another way, and that was the way of
  the Colbys. Their way was right. They lived like gentlemen, and, above all,
  they fought always like gentlemen.</p>

  <p>Presently the screen door opened, squeaked twice, and then closed with a
  hum of the screen as it slammed. Steps approached him. He got up from the
  chair and faced them, Gainor and the sheriff. The sheriff had instinctively
  put on his hat, like a man who does not understand the open air with an
  uncovered head. But Gainor was uncovered, and his white hair glimmered.</p>

  <p>He was a tall, courtly old fellow. His ceremonious address had won him
  much political influence. Men said that Gainor was courteous to a dog, not
  because he respected the dog, but because he wanted to practice for a man. He
  had always the correct rejoinder, always did the right thing. He had a thin,
  stern face and a hawk nose that gave him a cast of ferocity in certain
  aspects.</p>

  <p>It was to him that Terry addressed himself.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Gainor," he said, "I'm sorry to have sent in a false message. But my
  business is very urgent, and I have a very particular reason for not wishing
  to have it known that I have called you out."</p>

  <p>The moment he rose out of the chair and faced them, Gainor had stopped
  short. He was quite capable of fast thinking, and now his glance flickered
  from Terry to the sheriff and back again. It was plain that he had shrewd
  suspicions as to the purpose behind that call. The sheriff was merely
  confused. He flushed as much as his tanned-leather skin permitted. As for
  Terry, the moment his glance fell on the sheriff he felt his muscles jump
  into hard ridges, and an almost uncontrollable desire to go at the throat of
  the other seized him. He quelled that desire and fought it back with a chill
  of fear.</p>

  <p>"My father's blood working out!" he thought to himself.</p>

  <p>And he fastened his attention on Mr. Gainor and tried to shut the picture
  of the sheriff out of his brain. But the desire to leap at the tall man was
  as consuming as the passion for water in the desert. And with a shudder of
  horror he found himself without a moral scruple. Just behind the thin
  partition of his will power there was a raging fury to get at Joe Minter. He
  wanted to kill. He wanted to snuff that life out as the life of Black Jack
  Hollis had been snuffed.</p>

  <p>He excluded the sheriff deliberately from his attention and turned fully
  upon Gainor.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Gainor, will you be kind enough to go over to that grove of spruce
  where the three of us can talk without any danger of interruption?"</p>

  <p>Of course, that speech revealed everything. Gainor stiffened a little and
  the tuft of beard which ran down to a point on his chin quivered and jutted
  out. The sheriff seemed to feel nothing more than a mild surprise and
  curiosity. And the three went silently, side by side, under the spruce. They
  were glorious trees, strong of trunk and nobly proportioned. Their tops were
  silver-bright in the sunshine. Through the lower branches the light was
  filtered through layer after layer of shadow, until on the ground there were
  only a few patches of light here and there, and these were no brighter than
  silver moonshine, and seemed to be without heat. Indeed, in the mild shadow
  among the trees lay the chill of the mountain air which seems to lurk in
  covert places waiting for the night.</p>

  <p>It might have been this chill that made Terry button his coat closer about
  him and tremble a little as he entered the shadow. The great trunks shut out
  the world in a scattered wall. There was a narrow opening here among the
  trees at the very center. The three were in a sort of gorge of which the
  solemn spruce trees furnished the sides, the cold blue of the mountain skies
  was just above the lofty tree-tips, and the wind kept the pure fragrance of
  the evergreens stirring about them. The odor is the soul of the mountains. A
  great surety had come to Terry that this was the last place he would ever see
  on earth. He was about to die, and he was glad, in a dim sort of way, that he
  should die in a place so beautiful. He looked at the sheriff, who stood calm
  but puzzled, and at Gainor, who was very grave, indeed, and returned his look
  with one of infinite pity, as though he knew and understood and acquiesced,
  but was deeply grieved that it must be so.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," said Terry, making his voice light and cheerful as he felt
  that the voice of a Colby should be at such a time, being about to die, "I
  suppose you understand why I have asked you to come here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," nodded Gainor.</p>

  <p>"But I'm damned if I do," said the sheriff frankly.</p>

  <p>Terry looked upon him coldly. He felt that he had not the slightest chance
  of killing this professional manslayer, but at least he would do his
  best&mdash;for the sake of Black Jack's memory. But to think that his life
  &mdash;his mind&mdash;his soul&mdash;all that was dear to him and all that he
  was dear to, should ever lie at the command of the trigger of this hard,
  crafty, vain, and unimportant fellow! He writhed at the thought. It made him
  stand stiffer. His chin went up. He grew literally taller before their eyes,
  and such a look came on his face that the sheriff instinctively fell back a
  pace.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Gainor," said Terry, as though his contempt for the sheriff was too
  great to permit his speaking directly to Minter, "will you explain to the
  sheriff that my determination to have satisfaction does not come from the
  fact that he killed my father, but because of the manner of the killing? To
  the sheriff it seems justifiable. To me it seems a murder. Having that
  thought, there is only one thing to do. One of us must not leave this place!"
  Gainor bowed, but the sheriff gaped.</p>

  <p>"By the eternal!" he scoffed. "This sounds like one of them duels of the
  old days. This was the way they used to talk!"</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," said Gainor, raising his long-fingered hand, "it is my solemn
  duty to admonish you to make up your differences amicably."</p>

  <p>"Whatever that means," sneered the sheriff. "But tell this young fool
  that's trying to act like he couldn't see me or hear me&mdash;tell him that I
  don't carry no grudge ag'in' him, that I'm sorry he's Black Jack's son, but
  that it's something he can live down, maybe. And I'll go so far as to say I'm
  sorry that I done all that talking right to his face. But farther than that I
  won't go. And if all this is leading up to a gunplay, by God, gents, the
  minute a gun comes into my hand I shoot to kill, mark you that, and don't you
  never forget it!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Gainor had remained with his hand raised during this outbreak. Now he
  turned to Terry.</p>

  <p>"You have heard?" he said. "I think the sheriff is going quite a way
  toward you, Mr. Colby."</p>

  <p>"Hollis!" gasped Terry. "Hollis is the name, sir!"</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," said Gainor. "Mr. Hollis it is! Gentlemen, I assure
  you that I feel for you both. It seems, however, to be one of those
  unfortunate affairs when the mind must stop its debate and physical action
  must take up its proper place. I lament the necessity, but I admit it, even
  though the law does not admit it. But there are unwritten laws, sirs,
  unwritten laws which I for one consider among the holies of holies."</p>

  <p>Palpably the old man was enjoying every minute of his own talk. It was not
  his first affair of this nature. He came out of an early and more courtly
  generation where men drank together in the evening by firelight and carved
  one another in the morning with glimmering bowie knives.</p>

  <p>"You are both," he protested, "dear to me. I esteem you both as men and as
  good citizens. And I have done my best to open the way for peaceful
  negotiations toward an understanding. It seems that I have failed. Very well,
  sirs. Then it must be battle. You are both armed? With revolvers?"</p>

  <p>"Nacher'ly," said the sheriff, and spat accurately at a blaze on the tree
  trunk beside him. He had grown very quiet.</p>

  <p>"I am armed," said Terry calmly, "with a revolver."</p>

  <p>"Very good."</p>

  <p>The hand of Gainor glided into his bosom and came forth bearing a white
  handkerchief. His right hand slid into his coat and came forth
  likewise&mdash; bearing a long revolver.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," he said, "the first man to disobey my directions I shall
  shoot down unquestioningly, like a dog. I give you my solemn word for
  it!"</p>

  <p>And his eye informed them that he would enjoy the job.</p>

  <p>He continued smoothly: "This contest shall accord with the only terms by
  which a duel with guns can be properly fought. You will stand back to back
  with your guns not displayed, but in your clothes. At my word you will start
  walking in the opposite directions until my command 'Turn!' and at this
  command you will wheel, draw your guns, and fire until one man falls&mdash;or
  both!"</p>

  <p>He sent his revolver through a peculiar, twirling motion and shook back
  his long white hair.</p>

  <p>"Ready, gentlemen, and God defend the right!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap14"
     name="chap14">CHAPTER 14</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The talk was fitful in the living room. Elizabeth Cornish
  did her best to revive the happiness of her guests, but she herself was a
  prey to the same subdued excitement which showed in the faces of the others.
  A restraint had been taken away by the disappearance of both the storm
  centers of the dinner &mdash;the sheriff and Terry. Therefore it was possible
  to talk freely. And people talked. But not loudly. They were prone to gather
  in little familiar groups and discuss in a whisper how Terry had risen and
  spoken before them. Now and then someone, for the sake of politeness, strove
  to open a general theme of conversation, but it died away like a ripple on a
  placid pond.</p>

  <p>"But what I can't understand," said Elizabeth to Vance when she was able
  to maneuver him to her side later on, "is why they seem to expect something
  more."</p>

  <p>Vance was very grave and looked tired. The realization that all his
  cunning, all his work, had been for nothing, tormented him. He had set his
  trap and baited it, and it had worked perfectly&mdash;save that the teeth of
  the trap had closed over thin air. At the denouement of the sheriff's story
  there should have been the barking of two guns and a film of gunpowder smoke
  should have gone tangling to the ceiling. Instead there had been the formal
  little speech from Terry&mdash;and then quiet. Yet he had to mask and control
  his bitterness; he had to watch his tongue in talking with his sister.</p>

  <p>"You see," he said quietly, "they don't understand. They can't see how
  fine Terry is in having made no attempt to avenge the death of his father. I
  suppose a few of them think he's a coward. I even heard a little talk to that
  effect!"</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" cried Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>She had not thought of this phase of the matter. All at once she hated the
  sheriff.</p>

  <p>"It really is possible," said Vance. "You see, it's known that Terry never
  fights if he can avoid it. There never has been any real reason for fighting
  until today. But you know how gossip will put the most unrelated facts
  together, and make a complete story in some way."</p>

  <p>"I wish the sheriff were dead!" moaned Elizabeth. "Oh, Vance, if you only
  hadn't gone near Craterville! If you only hadn't distributed those wholesale
  invitations!"</p>

  <p>It was almost too much for Vance&mdash;to be reproached after so much of
  the triumph was on her side&mdash;such a complete victory that she herself
  would never dream of the peril she and Terry had escaped. But he had to
  control his irritation. In fact, he saw his whole life ahead of him carefully
  schooled and controlled. He no longer had anything to sell. Elizabeth had
  made a mock of him and shown him that he was hollow, that he was living on
  her charity. He must all the days that she remained alive keep flattering
  her, trying to find a way to make himself a necessity to her. And after her
  death there would be a still harder task. Terry, who disliked him pointedly,
  would then be the master, and he would face the bitter necessity of cajoling
  the youngster whom he detested. A fine life, truly! An almost noble anguish
  of the spirit came upon Vance. He was urged to the very brink of the
  determination to thrust out into the world and make his own living. But he
  recoiled from that horrible idea in time.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "that was the worst step I ever took. But I was trying to
  be wholehearted in the Western way, my dear, and show that I had entered into
  the spirit of things."</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact," sighed Elizabeth, "you nearly ruined Terry's life
  &mdash;and mine!"</p>

  <p>"Very near," said the penitent Vance. "But then&mdash;you see how well it
  has turned out? Terry has taken the acid test, and now you can trust him
  under any&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The words were literally blown off ragged at his lips. Two revolver shots
  exploded at them. No one gun could have fired them. And there was a terrible
  significance in the angry speed with which one had followed the other,
  blending, so that the echo from the lofty side of Sleep Mountain was but a
  single booming sound. In that clear air it was impossible to tell the
  direction of the noise.</p>

  <p>Everyone in the room seemed to listen stupidly for a repetition of the
  noises. But there was no repetition.</p>

  <p>"Vance," whispered Elizabeth in such a tone that the coward dared not look
  into her face. "It's happened!"</p>

  <p>"What?" He knew, but he wanted the joy of hearing it from her own
  lips.</p>

  <p>"It has happened," she whispered in the same ghostly voice. "But which
  one?"</p>

  <p>That was it. Who had fallen&mdash;Terry, or the sheriff? A long, heavy
  step crossed the little porch. Either man might walk like that.</p>

  <p>The door was flung open. Terence Hollis stood before them.</p>

  <p>"I think that I've killed the sheriff," he said simply. "I'm going up to
  my room to put some things together; and I'll go into town with any man who
  wishes to arrest me. Decide that between yourselves."</p>

  <p>With that he turned and walked away with a step as deliberately unhurried
  as his approach had been. The manner of the boy was more terrible than the
  thing he had done. Twice he had shocked them on the same afternoon. And they
  were just beginning to realize that the shell of boyhood was being ripped
  away from Terence Colby. Terry Hollis, son of Black Jack, was being revealed
  to them.</p>

  <p>The men received the news with utter bewilderment. The sheriff was as
  formidable in the opinion of the mountains as some Achilles. It was
  incredible that he should have fallen. And naturally a stern murmur rose:
  "Foul play!"</p>

  <p>Since the first vigilante days there has been no sound in all the West so
  dreaded as that deep-throated murmur of angry, honest men. That murmur from
  half a dozen law-abiding citizens will put the fear of death in the hearts of
  a hundred outlaws. The rumble grew, spread: "Foul play." And they began to
  look to one another, these men of action.</p>

  <p>Only Elizabeth was silent. She rose to her feet, as tall as her brother,
  without an emotion on her face. And her brother would never forget her.</p>

  <p>"It seems that you've won, Vance. It seems that blood will out, after all.
  The time is not quite up&mdash;and you win the bet!"</p>

  <p>Vance shook his head as though in protest and struck his hand across his
  face. He dared not let her see the joy that contorted his features. Triumph
  here on the very verge of defeat! It misted his eyes. Joy gave wings to his
  thoughts. He was the master of the valley.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;you'll think before you do anything, Elizabeth?"</p>

  <p>"I've done my thinking already&mdash;twenty-four years of it. I'm going to
  do what I promised I'd do."</p>

  <p>"And that?"</p>

  <p>"You'll see and hear in time. What's yonder?"</p>

  <p>The men were rising, one after another, and bunching together. Before
  Vance could answer, there was a confusion in the hall, running feet here and
  there. They heard the hard, shrill voice of Wu Chi chattering directions and
  the guttural murmurs of his fellow servants as they answered. Someone ran out
  into the hall and came back to the huddling, stirring crowd in the living
  room.</p>

  <p>"He's not dead&mdash;but close to it. Maybe die any minute&mdash; maybe
  live through it!"</p>

  <p>That was the report.</p>

  <p>"We'll get young Hollis and hold him to see how the sheriff comes
  out."</p>

  <p>"Aye, we'll get him!"</p>

  <p>All at once they boiled into action and the little crowd of men thrust for
  the big doors that led into the hall. They cast the doors back and came
  directly upon the tall, white-headed figure of Gainor.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap15"
     name="chap15">CHAPTER 15</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Gainor's dignity split the force of their rush. They
  recoiled as water strikes on a rock and divides into two meager swirls. And
  when one or two went past him on either side, he recalled them.</p>

  <p>"Boys, there seems to be a little game on hand. What is it?"</p>

  <p>Something repelling, coldly inquiring in his attitude and in his voice.
  They would have gone on if they could, but they could not. He held them with
  a force of knowledge of things that they did not know. They were remembering
  that this man had gone out with the sheriff to meet, apparently, his death.
  And yet Gainor, a well-tried friend of the sheriff, seemed unexcited. They
  had to answer his question, and how could they lie when he saw them rushing
  through a door with revolvers coming to brown, skillful hands? It was someone
  from the rear who made the confession.</p>

  <p>"We're going to get young Black Jack!"</p>

  <p>That was it. The speech came out like the crack of a gun, clearing the
  atmosphere. It told every man exactly what was in his own mind, felt but not
  confessed. They had no grudge against Terry, really. But they were determined
  to hang the son of Black Jack. Had it been a lesser deed, they might have let
  him go. But his victim was too distinguished in their society. He had struck
  down Joe Minter; the ghost of the great Black Jack himself seemed to have
  stalked out among them.</p>

  <p>"You're going to get young Terry Hollis?" interpreted Gainor, and his
  voice rose and rang over them. Those who had slipped past him on either side
  came back and faced him. In the distance Elizabeth had not stirred. Vance
  kept watching her face. It was cold as ice, unreadable. He could not believe
  that she was allowing this lynching party to organize under her own
  roof&mdash;a lynching party aimed at Terence. It began to grow in him that he
  had gained a greater victory than he imagined.</p>

  <p>"If you aim at Terry," went on Gainor, his voice even louder, "you'll have
  to aim at me, too. There's going to be no lynching bee, my friends!"</p>

  <p>The women had crowded back in the room. They made a little bank of stir
  and murmur around Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," said Gainor, shaking his white hair back again in his
  imposing way, "there has been no murder. The sheriff is not going to die.
  There has been a disagreement between two men of honor. The sheriff is now
  badly wounded. I think that is all. Does anybody want to ask questions about
  what has happened?"</p>

  <p>There was a bustle in the group of men. They were putting away the
  weapons, not quite sure what they could do next.</p>

  <p>"I am going to tell you exactly what has happened," said Gainor. "You
  heard the unfortunate things that passed at the table today. What the sheriff
  said was not said as an insult; but under the circumstances it became
  necessary for Terence Hollis to resent what he had heard. As a man of honor
  he could not do otherwise. You all agree with me in that?"</p>

  <p>They grunted a grudging assent. There were ways and ways of looking at
  such things. The way of Gainor was a generation old. But there was something
  so imposing about the old fellow, something which breathed the very spirit of
  honor and fair play, that they could not argue the point.</p>

  <p>"Accordingly Mr. Hollis sent for the sheriff. Not to bring him outdoors
  and shoot him down in a sudden gunplay, nor to take advantage of him through
  a surprise&mdash;as a good many men would have been tempted to do, my
  friends, for the sheriff has a wide reputation as a handler of guns of all
  sorts. No, sir, he sent for me also, and he told us frankly that the bad
  blood between him and the sheriff must be spent. You understand? By the Lord,
  my friends, I admired the fine spirit of the lad. He expected to be shot
  rather than to drop the sheriff. I could tell that by his expression. But his
  eye did not falter. It carried me back to the old days&mdash;to old days,
  sirs!"</p>

  <p>There was not a murmur in the entire room. The eye of Elizabeth Cornish
  was fire. Whether with anger or pride, Vance could not tell. But he began to
  worry.</p>

  <p>"We went over to the group of silver spruce near the house. I gave them
  the directions. They came and stood together, back to back, with their
  revolvers not drawn. They began to walk away in opposite directions at my
  command.</p>

  <p>"When I called 'Turn,' they wheeled. My gun was ready to shoot down the
  first man guilty of foul play&mdash;but there was no attempt to turn too
  soon, before the signal. They whirled, snatching out their guns&mdash;and the
  revolver of the sheriff hung in his clothes!"</p>

  <p>A groan from the little crowd.</p>

  <p>"Although, upon my word," said Gainor, "I do not think that the sheriff
  could have possibly brought out his gun as swiftly as Terence Hollis did. His
  whirl was like the spin of a top, or the snap of a whiplash, and as he
  snapped about, the revolver was in his hand, not raised to draw a bead, but
  at his hip. The sheriff set his teeth&mdash;but Terry did not fire!"</p>

  <p>A bewildered murmur from the crowd.</p>

  <p>"No, my friends," cried Gainor, his voice quivering, "he did not fire. He
  dropped the muzzle of his gun&mdash;and waited. By heaven, my heart went out
  to him. It was magnificent."</p>

  <p>The thin, strong hand of Elizabeth closed on the arm of Vance. "That was a
  Colby who did that!" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"The sheriff gritted his teeth," went on Gainor, "and tore out his gun.
  All this pause had been such a space as is needed for an eyelash to flicker
  twice. Out shot the sheriff's Colt. And then, and not until then, did the
  muzzle of Terry's revolver jerk up. Even after that delay he beat the sheriff
  to the trigger. The two shots came almost together, but the sheriff was
  already falling when he pulled his trigger, and his aim was wild.</p>

  <p>"He dropped on one side, the revolver flying out of his hand. I started
  forward, and then I stopped. By heaven, the sheriff had stretched out his arm
  and picked up his gun again. He was not through fighting.</p>

  <p>"A bulldog spirit, you say? Yes! And what could I do? It was the sheriff's
  right to keep on fighting as long as he wished. And it was the right of
  Terence to shoot the man full of holes the minute his hand touched the
  revolver again.</p>

  <p>"I could only stand still. I saw the sheriff raise his revolver. It was an
  effort of agony. But he was still trying to kill. And I nerved myself and
  waited for the explosion of the gun of Terence. I say I nerved myself for
  that shock, but the gun did not explode. I looked at him in wonder. My
  friends, he was putting up his gun and quietly looking the sheriff in the
  eye!</p>

  <p>"At that I shouted to him, I don't know what. I shouted to the sheriff not
  to fire. Too late. The muzzle of the gun was already tilting up, the barrel
  was straightening. And then the gun fell from Minter's hand and he dropped on
  his side. His strength had failed him at the last moment.</p>

  <p>"But I say, sirs, that what Terence Hollis did was the finest thing I have
  ever seen in my life, and I have seen fine things done by gentlemen before.
  There may be unpleasant associations with the name of Terry's father. I, for
  one, shall never carry over those associations to the son. Never! He has my
  hand, my respect, my esteem in every detail. He is a gentleman, my friends!
  There is nothing for us to do. If the sheriff is unfortunate and the wound
  should prove fatal, Terence will give himself up to the law. If he lives, he
  will be the first to tell you to keep your hands off the boy!"</p>

  <p>He ended in a little silence. But there was no appreciative burst of
  applause from those who heard him. The fine courage of Terence was, to them,
  merely the iron nerve of the man-killer, the keen eye and the judicious mind
  which knew that the sheriff would collapse before he fired his second shot.
  And his courtesy before the first shot was simply the surety of the man who
  knew that no matter what advantage he gave to his enemy, his own speed of
  hand would more than make up for it.</p>

  <p>Gainor, reading their minds, paid no more heed to them. He went straight
  across the room and took the hand of Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>"Dear Miss Cornish," he said so that all could hear, "I congratulate you
  for the man you have given us in Terence Hollis."</p>

  <p>Vance, watching, saw the tears of pleasure brighten the eyes of his
  sister.</p>

  <p>"You are very kind," she said. "But now I must see Sheriff Minter and be
  sure that everything is done for him."</p>

  <p>It seemed that the party took this as a signal for dismissal. As she went
  across the room, there were a dozen hasty adieus, and soon the guests were
  streaming towards the doors.</p>

  <p>Vance and Elizabeth and Gainor went to the sheriff. He had been installed
  in a guest room. His eyes were closed, his arms outstretched. A thick,
  telltale bandage was wrapped about his breast. And Wu Chi, skillful in such
  matters from a long experience, was sliding about the room in his whispering
  slippers. The sheriff did not open his eyes when Elizabeth tried his pulse.
  It was faint, but steady.</p>

  <p>He had been shot through the body and the lungs grazed, for as he breathed
  there was a faint bubble of blood that grew and swelled and burst on his lips
  at every breath. But he lived, and he would live unless there were an
  unnecessary change for the worse. They went softly out of the room again.
  Elizabeth was grave. Mr. Gainor took her hand.</p>

  <p>"I think I know what people are saying now, and what they will say
  hereafter. If Terry's father were any other than Hollis, this affair would
  soon he forgotten, except as a credit to him. But even as it is, he will live
  this matter down. I want to tell you again, Miss Cornish, that you have
  reason to be proud of him. He is the sort of man I should be proud to have in
  my own family. Madam, good-by. And if there is anything in which I can be of
  service to you or to Terence, call on me at any time and to any extent."</p>

  <p>And he went down the hall with a little swagger. Mr. Gainor felt that he
  had risen admirably to a great situation. As a matter of fact, he had.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth turned to Vance.</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd find Terence," she said, "and tell him that I'm waiting for
  him in the library."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap16"
     name="chap16">CHAPTER 16</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Vance went gloomily to the room of Terry and called him out.
  The boy was pale, but perfectly calm, and he looked older, much older.</p>

  <p>"There was a great deal of talk," said Vance&mdash;he must make doubly
  sure of Terence now. "And they even started a little lynching party. But we
  stopped all that. Gainor made a very nice little speech about you. And now
  Elizabeth is waiting for you in the library."</p>

  <p>Terry bit his lip.</p>

  <p>"And she?" he asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing to worry about," Vance assured him.</p>

  <p>"She'll probably read you a curtain lecture. But at heart she's proud of
  you because of the way Gainor talked. You can't do anything wrong in my
  sister's eyes."</p>

  <p>Terry breathed a great sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"But I'm not ashamed of what I've done. I'm really not, Uncle Vance. I'm
  afraid that I'd do it over again, under the same circumstances."</p>

  <p>"Of course you would. Of course you would, my boy. But you don't have to
  blurt that out to Elizabeth, do you? Let her think it was the overwhelming
  passion of the moment; something like that. A woman likes to be appealed to,
  not defied. Particularly Elizabeth. Take my advice. She'll open her arms to
  you after she's been stern as the devil for a moment."</p>

  <p>The boy caught his hand and wrung it.</p>

  <p>"By the Lord, Uncle Vance," he said, "I certainly appreciate this!"</p>

  <p>"Tush, Terry, tush!" said Vance. "You'll find that I'm with you and behind
  you in more ways than you'd ever guess."</p>

  <p>He received a grateful glance as they went down the broad stairs together.
  At the door to the library Vance turned away, but Elizabeth called to him and
  asked him in. He entered behind Terence Hollis, and found Elizabeth sitting
  in her father's big chair under the window, looking extremely fragile and
  very erect and proud. Across her lap was a legal-looking document.</p>

  <p>Vance knew instantly that it was the will she had made up in favor of
  Terence. He had been preparing himself for the worst, but at this his heart
  sank. He lowered himself into a chair. Terence had gone straight to
  Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>"I know I've done a thing that will cut you deeply, Aunt Elizabeth," he
  said. "I'm not going to ask you to see any justice on my side. I only want to
  ask you to forgive me, because&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Elizabeth was staring straight at and through her protege.</p>

  <p>"Are you done, Terence?"</p>

  <p>This time Vance was shocked into wide-eyed attention. The voice of
  Elizabeth was hard as iron. It brought a corresponding stiffening of
  Terence.</p>

  <p>"I'm done," he said, with a certain ring to his voice that Vance was glad
  to hear.</p>

  <p>It brought a flush into the pale cheeks of Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>"It is easy to see that you're proud of what you have done, Terence."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he answered with sudden defiance, "I am proud. It's the best thing
  I've ever done. I regret only one part of it."</p>

  <p>"And that?"</p>

  <p>"That my bullet didn't kill him!"</p>

  <p>Elizabeth looked down and tapped the folded paper against her fingertips.
  Whether it was mere thoughtfulness or a desire to veil a profound emotion
  from Terence, her brother could not tell. But he knew that something of
  importance was in the air. He scented it as clearly as the smoke of a forest
  fire.</p>

  <p>"I thought," she said in her new and icy manner, "that that would be your
  one regret."</p>

  <p>She looked suddenly up at Terence.</p>

  <p>"Twenty-four years," she said, "have passed since I took you into my life.
  At that time I was told that I was doing a rash thing, a dangerous thing
  &mdash;that before your twenty-fifth birthday the bad blood would out; that
  you would, in short, have shot a man. And the prophecy has come true. By an
  irony of chance it has happened on the very last day. And by another irony
  you picked your victim from among the guests under my roof!"</p>

  <p>"Victim?" cried Terry hoarsely. "Victim, Aunt Elizabeth?"</p>

  <p>"If you please," she said quietly, "not that name again, Terence. I wish
  you to know exactly what I have done. Up to this time I have given you a
  place in my affections. I have tried to the best of my skill to bring you up
  with a fitting education. I have given you what little wisdom and advice I
  have to give. Today I had determined to do much more. I had a will made
  out&mdash; this is it in my hands&mdash;and by the terms of this will I made
  you my heir &mdash;the heir to the complete Cornish estate aside from a
  comfortable annuity to Vance."</p>

  <p>She looked him in the eye, ripped the will from end to end, and tossed the
  fragments into the fire. There was a sharp cry from Vance, who sprang to his
  feet. It was the thrill of an unexpected triumph, but his sister took it for
  protest.</p>

  <p>"Vance, I haven't used you well, but from now on I'm going to change. As
  for you, Terence, I don't want you near me any longer than may be necessary.
  Understand that I expect to provide for you. I haven't raised you merely to
  cast you down suddenly. I'm going to establish you in business, see that you
  are comfortable, supply you with an income that's respectable, and then let
  you drift where you will.</p>

  <p>"My own mind is made up about your end before you take a step across the
  threshold of my house. But I'm still going to give you every chance. I don't
  want to throw you out suddenly, however. Take your time. Make up your mind
  what you want to do and where you are going. Take all the time you wish for
  such a conclusion. It's important, and it needs time for such a decision.
  When that decision is made, go your way. I never wish to hear from you again.
  I want no letters, and I shall certainly refuse to see you."</p>

  <p>Every word she spoke seemed to be a heavier blow than the last, and
  Terence bowed under the accumulated weight. Vance could see the boy struggle,
  waver between fierce pride and desperate humiliation and sorrow. To Vance it
  was clear that the stiff pride of Elizabeth as she sat in the chair was a
  brittle strength, and one vital appeal would break her to tears. But the boy
  did not see. Presently he straightened, bowed to her in the best Colby
  fashion, and turned on his heel. He went out of the room and left Vance and
  his sister facing one another, but not meeting each other's glances.</p>

  <p>"Elizabeth," he said at last, faintly&mdash;he dared not persuade too much
  lest she take him at his word. "Elizabeth, you don't mean it. It was
  twenty-four years ago that you passed your word to do this if things turned
  out as they have. Forget your promise. My dear, you're still wrapped up in
  Terry, no matter what you have said. Let me go and call him back. Why should
  you torture yourself for the sake of your pride?"</p>

  <p>He even rose, not too swiftly, and still with his eyes upon her. When she
  lifted her hand, he willingly sank back into his chair.</p>

  <p>"You're a very kind soul, Vance. I never knew it before. I'm appreciating
  it now almost too late. But what I have done shall stand!"</p>

  <p>"But, my dear, the pain&mdash;is it worth&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It means that my life is a wreck and a ruin, Vance. But I'll stand by
  what I've done. I won't give way to the extent of a single scruple."</p>

  <p>And the long, bitter silence which was to last so many days at the Cornish
  ranch began. And still they did not look into one another's eyes. As for
  Vance, he did not wish to. He was seeing a bright future. Not long to wait;
  after this blow she would go swiftly to her grave.</p>

  <p>He had barely reached that conclusion when the door opened again. Terry
  stood before them in the old, loose, disreputable clothes of a cow-puncher.
  The big sombrero swung in his hand. The heavy Colt dragged down in its
  holster over his right hip. His tanned face was drawn and stern.</p>

  <p>"I won't keep you more than a moment," he said. "I'm leaving. And I'm
  leaving with nothing of yours. I've already taken too much. If I live to be a
  hundred, I'll never forgive myself for taking your charity these twenty-four
  years. For what you've spent maybe I can pay you back one of these days, in
  money. But for all the time and&mdash;patience&mdash;you've spent on me I can
  never repay you. I know that. At least, here's where I stop piling up a debt.
  These clothes and this gun come out of the money I made punching cows last
  year. Outside I've got El Sangre saddled with a saddle I bought out of the
  same money. They're my start in life, the clothes I've got on and the gun and
  the horse and the saddle. So I'm starting clean&mdash;Miss Cornish!"</p>

  <p>Vance saw his sister wince under that name from the lips of Terry. But she
  did not speak.</p>

  <p>"There'll be no return," said Terence sadly. "My trail is an out trail.
  Good-by again." And so he was gone.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap17"
     name="chap17">CHAPTER 17</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Down the Bear Creek road Terence Hollis rode as he had never
  ridden before. To be sure, it was not the first time that El Sangre had
  stretched to the full his mighty strength, but on those other occasions he
  had fought the burst of speed, straining back in groaning stirrup leathers,
  with his full weight wresting at the bit. Now he let the rein play to such a
  point that he was barely keeping the power of the stallion in touch. He
  lightened his weight as only a fine horseman can do, shifting a few vital
  inches forward, and with the burden falling more over his withers, El Sangre
  fled like a racer down the valley. Not that he was fully extended. His head
  was not stretched out as a cow- pony's head is stretched when he runs; he
  held it rather high, as though he carried in his big heart a reserve strength
  ready to be called on for any emergency. For all that, it was running such as
  Terry had never known.</p>

  <p>The wind became a blast, jerking the brim of his sombrero up and whistling
  in his hair. He was letting the shame, the grief, the thousand regrets of
  that parting with Aunt Elizabeth be blown out of his soul. His mind was a
  whirl; the thoughts became blurs. As a matter of fact, Terry was being
  reborn.</p>

  <p>He had lived a life perfectly sheltered. The care of Elizabeth Cornish had
  surrounded him as the Blue Mountains and Sleep Mountain surrounded Bear
  Valley and fenced off the full power of the storm winds. The reality of life
  had never reached him. Now, all in a day, the burden was placed on his back,
  and he felt the spur driven home to the quick. No wonder that he winced, that
  his heart contracted.</p>

  <p>But now that he was awakening, everything was new. Uncle Vance, whom he
  had always secretly despised, now seemed a fine character, gentle, cultured,
  thoughtful of others. Aunt Elizabeth Cornish he had accepted as a sort of
  natural fact, as though there were a blood tie between them. Now he was
  suddenly aware of twenty-four years of patient love. The sorrow of it, that
  only the loss of that love should have brought him realization of it. Vague
  thoughts and aspirations formed in his mind. He yearned toward some large and
  heroic deed which should re-establish himself in her respect. He wished to
  find her in need, in great trouble, free her from some crushing burden with
  one perilous effort, lay his homage at her feet.</p>

  <p>All of which meant that Terry Hollis was a boy&mdash;a bewildered,
  heart-stricken boy. Not that he would have undone what he had done. It seemed
  to him inevitable that he should resent the story of the sheriff and shoot
  him down or be shot down himself. All that he regretted was that he had
  remained mute before Aunt Elizabeth, unable to explain to her a thing which
  he felt so keenly. And for the first time he realized the flinty basis of her
  nature. The same thing that enabled her to give half a lifetime to the
  cherishing of a theory, also enabled her to cast all the result of that labor
  out of her life. It stung him again to the quick every time he thought of it.
  There was something wrong. He felt that a hundred hands of affection gave him
  hold on her. And yet all those grips were brushed away.</p>

  <p>The torment was setting him on fire. And the fire was burning away the
  smug complacency which had come to him during his long life in the
  valley.</p>

  <p>When El Sangre pulled out of his racing gallop and struck out up a slope
  at his natural gait, the ground-devouring pace, Terry Hollis was panting and
  twisting in the saddle as though the labor of the gallop had been his. They
  climbed and climbed, and still his mind was involved in a haze of thought. It
  cleared when he found that there were no longer high mountains before him. He
  drew El Sangre to a halt with a word. The great stallion turned his head as
  he paused and looked back to his master with a confiding eye as though
  waiting willingly for directions. And all at once the heart of Terence went
  out to the blood-bay as it had never gone before to any creature, dumb or
  human. For El Sangre had known such pain as he himself was learning at this
  moment. El Sangre was giving him true trust, true love, and asking him for no
  return.</p>

  <p>The stallion, following his own will, had branched off from the Bear Creek
  trail and climbed through the lower range of the Blue Peaks. They were
  standing now on a mountain-top. The red of the sunset filled the west and
  brought the sky close to them with the lower drifts of stained clouds.
  Eastward the winding length of Bear Creek was turning pink and purple. The
  Cornish ranch had never seemed so beautiful to Terry as it was at this
  moment. It was a kingdom, and he was leaving, the disinherited heir.</p>

  <p>He turned west to the blare of the sunset. Blue Mountains tumbled away in
  lessening ranges&mdash;beyond was Craterville, and he must go there today.
  That was the world to him just then. And something new passed through Terry.
  The world was below him; it lay at his feet with its hopes and its battles.
  And he was strong for the test. He had been living in a dream. Now he would
  live in fact. And it was glorious to live!</p>

  <p>And when his arms fell, his right hand lodged instinctively on the butt of
  his revolver. It was a prophetic gesture, but there, again, was something
  that Terry Hollis did not understand.</p>

  <p>He called to El Sangre softly. The stallion responded with the faintest of
  whinnies to the vibrant power in the voice of the master; and at that smooth,
  effortless pace, he glided down the hillside, weaving dexterously among the
  jagged outcroppings of rock. A period had been placed after Terry's old life.
  And this was how he rode into the new.</p>

  <p>The long and ever-changing mountain twilight began as he wound through the
  lower ranges. And when the full dark came, he broke from the last sweep of
  foothills and El Sangre roused to a gallop over the level toward
  Craterville.</p>

  <p>He had been in the town before, of course. But he felt this evening that
  he had really never seen it before. On other days what existed outside of
  Bear Valley did not very much matter. That was the hub around which the rest
  of the world revolved, so far as Terry was concerned. It was very different
  now. Craterville, in fact, was a huddle of broken-down houses among a great
  scattering of boulders with the big mountains plunging up on every side to
  the dull blue of the night sky.</p>

  <p>But Craterville was also something more. It was a place where several
  hundred human beings lived, any one of whom might be the decisive influence
  in the life of Terry. Young men and old men were in that town, cunning and
  strength; old crones and lovely girls were there. Whom would he meet? What
  should he see? A sudden kindness toward others poured through Terry Hollis.
  After all, every man might be a treasure to him. A queer choking came in his
  throat when he thought of all that he had missed by his contemptuous
  aloofness.</p>

  <p>One thing gave him check. This was primarily the sheriff's town, and by
  this time they knew all about the shooting. But what of that? He had fought
  fairly, almost too fairly.</p>

  <p>He passed the first shapeless shack. The hoofs of El Sangre bit into the
  dust, choking and red in daylight, and acrid of scent by the night. All was
  very quiet except for a stir of voices in the distance here and there, always
  kept hushed as though the speaker felt and acknowledged the influence of the
  profound night in the mountains. Someone came down the street carrying a
  lantern. It turned his steps into vast spokes of shadows that rushed back and
  forth across the houses with the swing of the light. The lantern light
  gleamed on the stained flank of El Sangre.</p>

  <p>"Halloo, Jake, that you?"</p>

  <p>The man with the lantern raised it, but its light merely served to blind
  him. Terry passed on without a word and heard the other mutter behind him:
  "Some damn stranger!"</p>

  <p>Perhaps strangers were not welcome in Craterville. At least, it seemed so
  when he reached the hotel after putting up his horse in the shed behind the
  old building. Half a dozen dark forms sat on the veranda talking in the
  subdued voices which he had noted before. Terry stepped through the lighted
  doorway. There was no one inside.</p>

  <p>"Want something?" called a voice from the porch. The widow Rickson came in
  to him.</p>

  <p>"A room, please," said Terry.</p>

  <p>But she was gaping at him. "You! Terence&mdash;Hollis!"</p>

  <p>A thousand things seemed to be in that last word, which she brought out
  with a shrill ring of her voice. Terry noted that the talking on the porch
  was cut off as though a hand had been clapped over the mouth of every
  man.</p>

  <p>He recalled that the widow had been long a friend of the sheriff and he
  was suddenly embarrassed.</p>

  <p>"If you have a spare room, Mrs. Rickson. Otherwise, I'll find&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Her manner had changed. It became as strangely ingratiating as it had been
  horrified, suspicious, before.</p>

  <p>"Sure I got a room. Best in the house, if you want it. And&mdash;you'll be
  hungry, Mr.&mdash;Hollis?"</p>

  <p>He wondered why she insisted so savagely on that newfound name? He
  admitted that he was very hungry from his ride, and she led him back to the
  kitchen and gave him cold ham and coffee and vast slices of bread and
  butter.</p>

  <p>She did not talk much while he ate, and he noted that she asked no
  questions. Afterwards she led him through the silence of the place up to the
  second story and gave him a room at the corner of the building. He thanked
  her. She paused at the door with her hand on the knob, and her eyes fixed him
  through and through with a glittering, hostile stare. A wisp of gray hair had
  fallen across her cheek, and there it was plastered to the skin with sweat,
  for the evening was, warm.</p>

  <p>"No trouble," she muttered at length. "None at all. Make yourself to home,
  Mr.&mdash;Hollis!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap18"
     name="chap18">CHAPTER 18</a></h2>

  <p class="first">When the door closed on her, Terry remained standing in the
  middle of the room watching the flame in the oil lamp she had lighted flare
  and rise at the corner, and then steady down to an even line of yellow; but
  he was not seeing it; he was listening to that peculiar silence in the house.
  It seemed to have spread over the entire village, and he heard no more of
  those casual noises which he had noticed on his coming.</p>

  <p>He went to the window and raised it to let whatever wind was abroad enter
  the musty warmth of the room. He raised the sash with stealthy caution,
  wondering at his own stealthiness. And he was oddly glad when the window rose
  without a squeak. He leaned out and looked up and down the street. It was
  unchanged. Across the way a door flung open, a child darted out with shrill
  laughter and dodged about the corner of the house, escaping after some
  mischief.</p>

  <p>After that the silence again, except that before long a murmur began on
  the veranda beneath him where the half-dozen obscure figures had been sitting
  when he entered. Why should they be mumbling to themselves? He thought he
  could distinguish the voice of the widow Rickson among the rest, but he
  shrugged that idle thought away and turned back into his room. He sat down on
  the side of the bed and pulled off his boots, but the minute they were off he
  was ill at ease. There was something oppressive about the atmosphere of this
  rickety old hotel. What sort of a world was this he had entered, with its
  whispers, its cold glances?</p>

  <p>He cast himself back on his bed, determined to be at ease. Nevertheless,
  his heart kept bumping absurdly. Now, Terry began to grow angry. With the
  feeling that there was danger in the air of Craterville&mdash;for him&mdash;
  there came a nervous setting of the muscles, a desire to close on someone and
  throttle the secret of this hostility. At this point he heard a light tapping
  at the door. Terry sat bolt upright on the bed.</p>

  <p>There are all kinds of taps. There are bold, heavy blows on the door that
  mean danger without; there are careless, conversational rappings; but this
  was a furtive tap, repeated after a pause as though it contained a code
  message.</p>

  <p>First there was a leap of fear&mdash;then cold quiet of the nerves. He was
  surprised at himself. He found himself stepping into whatever adventure lay
  toward him with the lifting of the spirits. It was a stimulus.</p>

  <p>He called cheerfully: "Come in!"</p>

  <p>And the moment he had spoken he was off the bed, noiselessly, and half the
  width of the room away. It had come to him as he spoke that it might be well
  to shift from the point from which his voice had been heard.</p>

  <p>The door opened swiftly&mdash;so swiftly was it opened and closed that it
  made a faint whisper in the air, oddly like a sigh. And there was no click of
  the lock either in the opening or the closing. Which meant an incalculably
  swift and dexterous manipulation with the fingers. Terry found himself facing
  a short-throated man with heavy shoulders; he wore a shapeless black hat
  bunched on his head as though the whole hand had grasped the crown and shoved
  the hat into place. It sat awkwardly to one side. And the hat typified the
  whole man. There was a sort of shifty readiness about him. His eyes flashed
  in the lamplight as they glanced at the bed, and then flicked back toward
  Terry. And a smile began somewhere in his face and instantly went out. It was
  plain that he had understood the maneuver.</p>

  <p>He continued to survey Terry insolently for a moment without announcing
  himself. Then he stated: "You're him, all right!"</p>

  <p>"Am I?" said Terry, regarding this unusual visitor with increasing
  suspicion. "But I'm afraid you have me at a disadvantage."</p>

  <p>The big-shouldered man raised a stubby hand. He had an air of one who
  deprecates, and at the same time lets another into a secret. He moved across
  the room with short steps that made no sound, and gave him a peculiar
  appearance of drifting rather than walking. He picked up a chair and placed
  it down on the rug beside the bed and seated himself in it.</p>

  <p>Aside from the words he had spoken, since he entered the room he had made
  no more noise than a phantom.</p>

  <p>"You're him, all right," he repeated, balancing back in the chair. But he
  gathered his toes under him, so that he remained continually poised in spite
  of the seeming awkwardness of his position.</p>

  <p>"Who am I?" asked Terry.</p>

  <p>"Why, Black Jack's kid. It's printed in big type all over you."</p>

  <p>His keen eyes continued to bore at Terry as though he were striving to
  read features beneath a mask. Terry could see his visitor's face more clearly
  now. It was square, with a powerfully muscled jaw and features that had a
  battered look. Suddenly he teetered forward in his chair and dropped his
  elbows aggressively on his knees.</p>

  <p>"D'you know what they're talking about downstairs?"</p>

  <p>"Haven't the slightest idea."</p>

  <p>"You ain't! The old lady is trying to fix up a bad time for you."</p>

  <p>"She's raising a crowd?"</p>

  <p>"Doing her best. I dunno what it'll come to. The boys are stirring a
  little. But I think it'll be all words and no action. Four-flushers, most of
  'em. Besides, they say you bumped old Minter for a goal; and they don't like
  the idea of messing up with you. They'll just talk. If they try anything
  besides their talk&mdash;well, you and me can fix 'em!"</p>

  <p>Terry slipped into the only other chair which the room provided, but he
  slid far down in it, so that his holster was free and the gun butt
  conveniently under his hand.</p>

  <p>"You seem a charitable sort," he said. "Why do you throw in with me?"</p>

  <p>"And you don't know who I am?" said the other.</p>

  <p>He chuckled noiselessly, his mouth stretching to remarkable
  proportions.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," said Terry.</p>

  <p>"Why, kid, I'm Denver. I'm your old man's pal, Denver! I'm him that done
  the Silver Junction job with old Black Jack, and a lot more jobs, when you
  come to that!"</p>

  <p>He laughed again. "They were getting sort of warm for me out in the big
  noise. So I grabbed me a side-door Pullman and took a trip out to the old
  beat. And think of bumping into Black Jack's boy right off the bat!"</p>

  <p>He became more sober. "Say, kid, ain't you got a glad hand for me? Ain't
  you ever heard Black Jack talk?"</p>

  <p>"He died," said Terry soberly, "before I was a year old."</p>

  <p>"The hell!" murmured the other. "The hell! Poor kid. That was a rotten
  lay, all right. If I'd known about that, I'd of&mdash;but I didn't. Well, let
  it go. Here we are together. And you're the sort of a sidekick I need. Black
  Jack, we're going to trim this town to a fare-thee-well!"</p>

  <p>"My name is Hollis," said Terry. "Terence Hollis."</p>

  <p>"Terence hell," snorted the other. "You're Black Jack's kid, ain't you?
  And ain't his moniker good enough for you to work under? Why, kid, that's a
  trademark most of us would give ten thousand cash for!"</p>

  <p>He broke off and regarded Terry with a growing satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"You're his kid, all right. This is just the way Black Jack would of sat
  &mdash;cool as ice&mdash;with a gang under him talking about stretching his
  neck. And now, bo, hark to me sing! I got the job fixed and&mdash;But wait a
  minute. What you been doing all these years? Black Jack was known when he was
  your age!"</p>

  <p>With a peculiar thrill of awe and of aversion Terry watched the face of
  the man who had known his father so well. He tried to make himself believe
  that twenty-four years ago Denver might have been quite another type of man.
  But it was impossible to re-create that face other than as a bulldog in the
  human flesh. The craft and the courage of a fighter were written large in
  those features.</p>

  <p>"I've been leading&mdash;a quiet life," he said gently.</p>

  <p>The other grinned. "Sure&mdash;quiet," he chuckled. "And then you wake up
  and bust Minter for your first crack. You began late, son, but you may go
  far. Pretty tricky with the gat, eh?"</p>

  <p>He nodded in anticipatory admiration.</p>

  <p>"Old Minter had a name. Ain't I had my run-in with him? He was smooth with
  a cannon. And fast as a snake's tongue. But they say you beat him fair and
  square. Well, well, I call that a snappy start in the world!"</p>

  <p>Terry was silent, but his companion refused to be chilled.</p>

  <p>"That's Black Jack over again," he said. "No wind about what he'd done. No
  jabber about what he was going to do. But when you wanted something done, go
  to Black Jack. Bam! There it was done clean for you and no talk afterward.
  Oh, he was a bird, was your old man. And you take after him, right
  enough!"</p>

  <p>A voice rose in Terry. He wanted to argue. He wanted to explain. It was
  not that he felt any consuming shame because he was the son of Black Jack
  Hollis. But there was a sort of foster parenthood to which he owed a clean-
  minded allegiance&mdash;the fiction of the Colby blood. He had worshipped
  that thought for twenty years. He could not discard it in an instant.</p>

  <p>Denver was breezing on in his quick, husky voice, so carefully toned that
  it barely served to reach Terry.</p>

  <p>"I been waiting for a pal like you, kid. And here's where we hit it off.
  You don't know much about the game, I guess? Neither did Black Jack. As a
  peterman he was a loud ha-ha; as a damper-getter he was just an amateur; as a
  heel or a houseman, well, them things were just outside him. When it come to
  the gorilla stuff, he was there a million, though. And when there was a call
  for fast, quick, soft work, Black Jack was the man. Kid, I can see that
  you're cut right on his pattern. And here's where you come in with me. Right
  off the bat there's going to be velvet. Later on I'll educate you. In three
  months you'll be worth your salt. Are you on?"</p>

  <p>He hardly waited for Terry to reply. He rambled on.</p>

  <p>"I got a plant that can't fail to blossom into the long green, kid. The
  store safe. You know what's in it? I'll tell you. Ten thousand cold. Ten
  thousand bucks, boy. Well, well, and how did it get there? Because a lot of
  the boobs around here have put their spare cash in the safe for
  safekeeping!"</p>

  <p>He tilted his chin and indulged in another of his yawning, silent bursts
  of laughter.</p>

  <p>"And you never seen a peter like it. Tin, kid, tin. I could turn it inside
  out with a can opener. But I ain't long on a kit just now. I'm on the hog for
  fair, as a matter of fact. Well, I don't need a kit. I got some sawdust and I
  can make the soup as pretty as you ever seen. We'll blow the safe, kid, and
  then we'll float. Are you on?"</p>

  <p>He paused, grinning with expectation, his face gradually becoming blank as
  he saw no response in Terry.</p>

  <p>"As nearly as I can make out&mdash;because most of the slang is new to
  me," said Terry, "you want to dynamite the store safe and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who said sawdust? Soup, kid, soup! I want to blow the door off the peter,
  not the roof off the house. Say, who d'you think I am, a boob?"</p>

  <p>"I understand, then. Nitroglycerin? Denver, I'm not with you. It's mighty
  good of you to ask me to join in&mdash;but that isn't my line of work."</p>

  <p>The yegg raised an expostulatory hand, but Terry went on: "I'm going to
  keep straight, Denver."</p>

  <p>It seemed as though this simple tiding took the breath from Denver.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he nodded at length. "You playing up a new line. No strong-arm stuff
  except when you got to use it. Going to try scratching, kid? Is that it, or
  some other kind of slick stuff?"</p>

  <p>"I mean what I say, Denver. I'm going straight."</p>

  <p>The yegg shook his head, bewildered. "Say," he burst out suddenly, "ain't
  you Black Jack's kid?"</p>

  <p>"I'm his son," said Terry.</p>

  <p>"All right. You'll come to it. It's in the blood, Black Jack. You can't
  get away from it."</p>

  <p>Terry tugged his shirt open at the throat; he was stifling. "Perhaps," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"It's the easy way," went on Denver. "Well, maybe you ain't ripe yet, but
  when you are, tip me off. Gimme a ring and I'll be with you."</p>

  <p>"One more thing. You're broke, Denver. And I suppose you need what's in
  that safe. But if you take it, the widow will be ruined. She runs the hotel
  and the store, too, you know."</p>

  <p>"Why, you poor boob," groaned Denver, "don't you know she's the old dame
  that's trying to get you mobbed?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so. But she was pretty fond of the sheriff, you know. I don't
  blame her for carrying a grudge. Now, about the money, Denver; I happen to
  have a little with me. Take what you want."</p>

  <p>Denver took the proffered money without a word, counted it with a deftly
  stabbing forefinger, and shoved the wad into his hip pocket.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said, "this'll sort of sweeten the pot. You don't need
  it?"</p>

  <p>"I'll get along without it. And you won't break the safe?"</p>

  <p>"Hell!" grunted Denver. "Does it hang on that?"</p>

  <p>Terry leaned forward in his chair.</p>

  <p>"Denver, don't break that safe!"</p>

  <p>"You kind of say that as if you was boss, maybe," sneered Denver.</p>

  <p>"I am," said Terry, "as far as this goes."</p>

  <p>"How'll you stop me, kid? Sit up all night and nurse the safe?"</p>

  <p>"No. But I'll follow you, Denver. And I'll get you. You understand? I'll
  stay on your trail till I have you."</p>

  <p>Again there was a long moment of silence, then, "Black Jack!" muttered
  Denver. "You're like his ghost! I think you'd get me, right enough! Well,
  I'll call it off. This fifty will help me along a ways."</p>

  <p>At the door he whirled sharply on Terence Hollis. "How much have you got
  left?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Enough," said Terry.</p>

  <p>"Then lemme have another fifty, will you?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry. I can't quite manage it."</p>

  <p>"Make it twenty-five, then."</p>

  <p>"Can't do that either, Denver. I'm very sorry."</p>

  <p>"Hell, man! Are you a short sport? I got a long jump before me. Ain't you
  got any credit around this town?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;not very much, I'm afraid."</p>

  <p>"You're kidding me," scowled Denver. "That wasn't Black Jack's way. From
  his shoes to his skin everything he had belonged to his partners. His
  ghost'll haunt you if you're turning me down, kid. Why, ain't you the heir of
  a rich rancher over the hills? Ain't that what I been told?"</p>

  <p>"I was," said Terry, "until today."</p>

  <p>"Ah! You got turned out for beaning Minter?"</p>

  <p>Terry remained silent.</p>

  <p>"Without a cent?"</p>

  <p>Suddenly the pudgy arm of Denver shot out and his finger pointed into
  Terry's face.</p>

  <p>"You damn fool! This fifty is the last cent you got in the world!"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," said Terry calmly.</p>

  <p>"You lie!" Denver struck his knuckles across his forehead. "And I was
  going to trim you. Black Jack, I didn't know you was as white as this. Fifty?
  Pal, take it back!"</p>

  <p>He forced the money into Terry's pocket.</p>

  <p>"And take some more. Here; lemme stake you. I been pulling a sob story,
  but I'm in the clover, Black Jack. Gimme your last cent, will you? Kid,
  here's a hundred, two hundred&mdash;say what you want."</p>

  <p>"Not a cent&mdash;nothing," said Terry, but he was deeply moved.</p>

  <p>Denver thoughtfully restored the money to his wallet.</p>

  <p>"You're white," he said gently. "And you're straight as they come. Keep it
  up if you can. I know damned well that you can't. I've seen 'em try before.
  But they always slip. Keep it up, Black Jack, but if you ever change your
  mind, lemme know. I'll be handy. Here's luck!"</p>

  <p>And he was gone as he had entered, with a whish of the swiftly moved door
  in the air, and no click of the lock.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap19"
     name="chap19">CHAPTER 19</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The door had hardly closed on him when Terence wanted to run
  after him and call him back. There was a thrill still running in his blood
  since the time the yegg had leaned so close and said: "That wasn't Black
  Jack's way!"</p>

  <p>He wanted to know more about Black Jack, and he wanted to hear the story
  from the lips of this man. A strange warmth had come over him. It had seemed
  for a moment that there was a third impalpable presence in the room&mdash;his
  father listening. And the thrill of it remained, a ghostly and yet a real
  thing.</p>

  <p>But he checked his impulse. Let Denver go, and the thought of his father
  with him. For the influence of Black Jack, he felt, was quicksand pulling him
  down. The very fact that he was his father's son had made him shoot down one
  man. Again the shadow of Black Jack had fallen across his path today and
  tempted him to crime. How real the temptation had been, Terry did not know
  until he was alone. Half of ten thousand dollars would support him for many a
  month. One thing was certain. He must let his father remain simply a
  name.</p>

  <p>Going to the window in his stocking feet, he listened again. There were
  more voices murmuring on the veranda of the hotel now, but within a few
  moments forms began to drift away down the street, and finally there was
  silence. Evidently the widow had not secured backing as strong as she could
  have desired. And Terry went to bed and to sleep.</p>

  <p>He wakened with the first touch of dawn along the wall beside his bed and
  tumbled out to dress. It was early, even for a mountain town. The rattling at
  the kitchen stove commenced while he was on the way downstairs. And he had to
  waste time with a visit to El Sangre in the stable before his breakfast was
  ready.</p>

  <p>Craterville was in the hollow behind him when the sun rose, and El Sangre
  was taking up the miles with the tireless rhythm of his pace. He had intended
  searching for work of some sort near Craterville, but now he realized that it
  could not be. He must go farther. He must go where his name was not
  known.</p>

  <p>For two days he held on through the broken country, climbing more than he
  dropped. Twice he came above the ragged timber line, with its wind-shaped
  army of stunted trees, and over the tiny flowers of the summit lands. At the
  end of the second day he came out on the edge of a precipitous descent to a
  prosperous grazing country below. There would be his goal.</p>

  <p>A big mountain sheep rounded a corner with a little flock behind him.
  Terry dropped the leader with a snapshot and watched the flock scamper down
  what was almost the sheer face of a cliff&mdash;a beautiful bit of
  acrobatics. They found foothold on ridges a couple of inches deep, hardly
  visible to the eye from above. Plunging down a straight drop without a sign
  of a ledge for fifty feet below them, they broke the force of the fall and
  slowed themselves constantly by striking their hoofs from side to side
  against the face of the cliff. And so they landed, with bunched feet, on the
  first broad terrace below and again bounced over the ledge and so out of
  sight.</p>

  <p>He dined on wild mutton that evening. In the morning he hunted along the
  edge of the cliffs until he came to a difficult route down to the valley. An
  ordinary horse would never have made it, but El Sangre was in his glory. If
  he had not the agility of the mountain sheep, he was well-nigh as
  level-headed in the face of tremendous heights. He knew how to pitch ten feet
  down to a terrace and strike on his bunched hoofs so that the force of the
  fall would not break his legs or unseat his rider. Again he understood how to
  drive in the toes of his hoofs and go up safely through loose gravel where
  most horses, even mustangs, would have skidded to the bottom of the slope.
  And he was wise in trails. Twice he rejected the courses which Terry picked,
  and the rider very wisely let him have his way. The result was that they took
  a more winding, but a far safer course, and arrived before midmorning in the
  bottomlands.</p>

  <p>The first ranch house he applied to accepted him. And there he took up his
  work.</p>

  <p>It was the ordinary outfit&mdash;the sun-and wind-racked shack for a
  house, the stumbling outlying barns and sheds, and the maze of corral fences.
  They asked Terry no questions, accepted his first name without an addition,
  and let him go his way.</p>

  <p>He was happy enough. He had not the leisure for thought or for remembering
  better times. If he had leisure here and there, he used it industriously in
  teaching El Sangre the "cow" business. The stallion learned swiftly. He began
  to take a joy in sitting down on a rope.</p>

  <p>At the end of a week Terry won a bet when a team of draught horses hitched
  onto his line could not pull El Sangre over his mark, and broke the rope
  instead. There was much work, too, in teaching him to turn in the cow-pony
  fashion, dropping his head almost to the ground and bunching his feet
  altogether. For nothing of its size that lives is so deft in dodging as the
  cow- pony. That part of El Sangre's education was not completed, however, for
  only the actual work of a round-up could give him the faultless surety of a
  good cow- pony. And, indeed, the ranchman declared him useless for real
  roundup work.</p>

  <p>"A no-good, high-headed fool," he termed El Sangre, having sprained his
  bank account with an attempt to buy the stallion from Terry the day
  before.</p>

  <p>At the end of a fortnight the first stranger passed, and ill-luck made it
  a man from Craterville. He knew Terry at a glance, and the next morning the
  rancher called Terry aside.</p>

  <p>The work of that season, he declared, was going to be lighter than he had
  expected. Much as he regretted it, he would have to let his new hand go.
  Terry taxed him at once to get at the truth.</p>

  <p>"You've found out my name. That's why you're turning me off. Is that the
  straight of it?"</p>

  <p>The sudden pallor of the other was a confession.</p>

  <p>"What's names to me?" he declared. "Nothing, partner. I take a man the way
  I find him. And I've found you all right. The reason I got to let you go is
  what I said."</p>

  <p>But Terry grinned mirthlessly.</p>

  <p>"You know I'm the son of Black Jack Hollis," he insisted. "You think that
  if you keep me you'll wake up some morning to find your son's throat cut and
  your cattle gone. Am I right?"</p>

  <p>"Listen to me," the rancher said uncertainly. "I know how you feel about
  losing a job so suddenly when you figured it for a whole season. Suppose I
  give you a whole month's pay and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Damn your money!" said Terry savagely. "I don't deny that Black Jack was
  my father. I'm proud of it. But listen to me, my friend. I'm living straight.
  I'm working hard. I don't object to losing this job. It's the attitude behind
  it that I object to. You'll not only send me away, but you'll spread the news
  around&mdash;Black Jack's son is here! Am I a plague because of that
  name?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Hollis," insisted the rancher in a trembling voice, "I don't mean to
  get you all excited. Far as your name goes, I'll keep your secret. I give you
  my word on it. Trust me, I'll do what's right by you."</p>

  <p>He was in a panic. His glance wavered from Terry's eyes to the revolver at
  his side.</p>

  <p>"Do you think so?" said Terry. "Here's one thing that you may not have
  thought of. If you and the rest like you refuse to give me honest work,
  there's only one thing left for me&mdash;and that's dishonest work. You turn
  me off because I'm the son of Black Jack; and that's the very thing that will
  make me the son of Black Jack in more than name. Did you ever stop to realize
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Hollis," quavered the rancher, "I guess you're right. If you want to
  stay on here, stay and welcome, I'm sure."</p>

  <p>And his eye hunted for help past the shoulder of Terry and toward the
  shed, where his eldest son was whistling. Terry turned away in mute disgust.
  By the time he came out of the bunkhouse with his blanket roll, there was
  neither father nor son in sight. The door of the shack was closed, and
  through the window he caught a glimpse of a rifle. Ten minutes later El
  Sangre was stepping away across the range at a pace that no mount in the
  cattle country could follow for ten miles.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap20"
     name="chap20">CHAPTER 20</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There was an astonishing deal of life in the town, however.
  A large company had reopened some old diggings across the range to the north
  of Calkins, and some small fragments of business drifted the way of the
  little cattle town. Terry found a long line of a dozen horses waiting to be
  shod before the blacksmith shop. One great wagon was lumbering out at the
  farther end of the street, with the shrill yells of the teamster calling back
  as he picked up his horses one by one with his voice. Another freight-wagon
  stood at one side, blocking half the street. And a stir of busy life was
  everywhere in the town. The hotel and store combined was flooded with sound,
  and the gambling hall across the street was alive even at midday.</p>

  <p>It was noon, and Terry found that the dining room was packed to the last
  chair. The sweating waiter improvised a table for him in the corner of the
  hall and kept him waiting twenty minutes before he was served with ham and
  eggs. He had barely worked his fork into the ham when a familiar voice hailed
  him.</p>

  <p>"Got room for another at that table?"</p>

  <p>He looked up into the grinning face of Denver. For some reason it was a
  shock to Terry. Of course, the second meeting was entirely coincidental, but
  a still small voice kept whispering to him that there was fate in it. He was
  so surprised that he could only nod. Denver at once appropriated a chair and
  seated himself in his usual noiseless way.</p>

  <p>When he rearranged the silver which the waiter placed before him, there
  was not the faintest click of the metal. And Terry noted, too, a certain nice
  justness in every one of Denver's motions. He was never fiddling about with
  his hands; when they stirred, it was to do something, and when the thing was
  done, the hands became motionless again.</p>

  <p>His eyes did not rove; they remained fixed for appreciable periods
  wherever they fell, as though Denver were finding something worth remembering
  in the wall, or in a spot on the table. When his glance touched on a face, it
  hung there in the same manner. After a moment one would forget all the rest
  of his face, brutal, muscular, shapeless, and see only the keen eyes.</p>

  <p>Terry found it difficult to face the man. There was need to be excited
  about something, to talk with passion, in order to hold one's own in the
  presence of Denver, even when the chunky man was silent. He was not silent
  now; he seemed in a highly cheerful, amiable mood.</p>

  <p>"Here's luck," he said. "I didn't know this God-forsaken country could
  raise as much luck as this!"</p>

  <p>"Luck?" echoed Terry.</p>

  <p>"Why not? D'you think I been trailing you?"</p>

  <p>He chuckled in his noiseless way. It gave Terry a feeling of expectation.
  He kept waiting for the sound to come into that laughter, but it never did.
  Suddenly he was frank, because it seemed utterly futile to attempt to mask
  one's real thoughts from this fellow.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he said, "that it would surprise me if you <i>had</i> been
  tailing me. I imagine you're apt to do queer things, Denver."</p>

  <p>Denver hissed, very softly and with such a cutting whistle to his breath
  that Terry's lips remained open over his last word.</p>

  <p>"Forget that name!" Denver said in a half-articulate tone of voice.</p>

  <p>He froze in his place, staring straight before him; but Terry gathered an
  impression of the most intense watchfulness&mdash;as though, while he stared
  straight before him, he had sent other and mysterious senses exploring for
  him. He seemed suddenly satisfied that all was well, and as he relaxed, Terry
  became aware of a faint gleam of perspiration on the brow of his
  companion.</p>

  <p>"Why the devil did you tell me the name if you didn't want me to use it?"
  he asked.</p>

  <p>"I thought you'd have some savvy; I thought you'd have some of your dad's
  horse sense," said Denver.</p>

  <p>"No offense," answered Terry, with the utmost good nature.</p>

  <p>"Call me Shorty if you want," said Denver. In the meantime he was
  regarding Terry more and more closely.</p>

  <p>"Your old man would of made a fight out of it if I'd said as much to him
  as I've done to you," he remarked at length.</p>

  <p>"Really?" murmured Terry.</p>

  <p>And the portrait of his father swept back on him&mdash;the lean,
  imperious, handsome face, the boldness of the eyes. Surely a man all fire and
  powder, ready to explode. He probed his own nature. He had never been
  particularly quick of temper&mdash;until lately. But he began to wonder if
  his equable disposition might not rise from the fact that his life in Bear
  Valley had been so sheltered. He had been crossed rarely. In the outer world
  it was different. That very morning he had been tempted wickedly to take the
  tall rancher by the throat and grind his face into the sand.</p>

  <p>"But maybe you're different," went on Denver. "Your old man used to flare
  up and be over it in a minute. Maybe you remember things and pack a grudge
  with you."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said Terry, grown strangely meek. "I hardly know."</p>

  <p>Indeed, he thought, how little he really knew of himself. Suddenly he
  said: "So you simply happened over this way, Shorty?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. Why not? I got a right to trail around where I want. Besides, what
  would there be in it for me&mdash;following you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Terry gravely. "But I expect to find out sooner or
  later. What else are you up to over here?"</p>

  <p>"I have a little job in mind at the mine," said Denver. "Something that
  may give the sheriff a bit of trouble." He grinned.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it a little&mdash;unprofessional," said Terry dryly, "for you to
  tell me these things?"</p>

  <p>"Sure it is, bo&mdash;sure it is! Worst in the world. But I can always
  tell a gent that can keep his mouth shut. By the way, how many jobs you been
  fired from already?"</p>

  <p>Terry started. "How do you know that?"</p>

  <p>"I just guess at things."</p>

  <p>"I started working for an infernal idiot," sighed Terry. "When he learned
  my name, he seemed to be afraid I'd start shooting up his place one of these
  days."</p>

  <p>"Well, he was a wise gent. You ain't cut out for working, son. Not a bit.
  It'd be a shame to let you go to waste simply raising calluses on your
  hands."</p>

  <p>"You talk well," sighed Terry, "but you can't convince me."</p>

  <p>"Convince you? Hell, I ain't trying to convince your father's son. You're
  like Black Jack. You got to find out yourself. We was with a Mick, once. Red-
  headed devil, he was. I says to Black Jack: 'Don't crack no jokes about the
  Irish around this guy!'</p>

  <p>"'Why not?' says your dad.</p>

  <p>"'Because there'd be an explosion,' says I.</p>

  <p>"'H'm,' says Black Jack, and lifts his eyebrows in a way he had of
  doing.</p>

  <p>"And the first thing he does is to try a joke on the Irish right in front
  of the Mick. Well, there was an explosion, well enough."</p>

  <p>"What happened?" asked Terry, carried away with curiosity.</p>

  <p>"What generally happened, kid, when somebody acted up in front of your
  dad?" From the air he secured an imaginary morsel between stubby thumb and
  forefinger and then blew the imaginary particle into empty space.</p>

  <p>"He killed him?" asked Terry hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"No," said Denver, "he didn't do that. He just broke his heart for him.
  Kicked the gat out of the hand of the poor stiff and wrestled with him. Black
  Jack was a wildcat when it come to fighting with his hands. When he got
  through with the Irishman, there wasn't a sound place on the fool. Black Jack
  climbed back on his horse and threw the gun back at the guy on the ground and
  rode off. Next we heard, the guy was working for a Chinaman that run a
  restaurant. Black Jack had taken all the fight out of him."</p>

  <p>That scene out of the past drifted vividly back before Terry's eyes. He
  saw the sneer on the lips of Black Jack; saw the Irishman go for his gun; saw
  the clash, with his father leaping in with tigerish speed; felt the shock of
  the two strong bodies, and saw the other turn to pulp under the grip of Black
  Jack.</p>

  <p>By the time he had finished visualizing the scene, his jaw was set hard.
  It had been easy, very easy, to throw himself into the fierceness of his dead
  father's mood. During this moment of brooding he had been looking down, and
  he did not notice the glance of Denver fasten upon him with an almost
  hypnotic fervor, as though he were striving to reach to the very soul of the
  younger man and read what was written there. When Terry looked up, the face
  of his companion was as calm as ever.</p>

  <p>"And you're like the old boy," declared Denver. "You got to find out for
  yourself. It'll be that way with this work idea of yours. You've lost one
  job. You'll lose the next one. But&mdash;I ain't advising you no more!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap21"
     name="chap21">CHAPTER 21</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Terry left the hotel more gloomy than he had been even when
  he departed from the ranch that morning. The certainty of Denver that he
  would find it impossible to stay by his program of honest work had made a
  strong impression upon his imaginative mind, as though the little safecracker
  really had the power to look into the future and into the minds of men. Where
  he should look for work next, he had no idea. And he balanced between a
  desire to stay near the town and work out his destiny there, or else drift
  far away. Distance, however, seemed to have no barrier against rumor. After
  two days of hard riding, he had placed a broad gap between himself and the
  Cornish ranch, yet in a short time rumor had overtaken him, casually,
  inevitably, and the force of his name was strong enough to take away his
  job.</p>

  <p>Standing in the middle of the street he looked darkly over the squat roofs
  of the town to the ragged mountains that marched away against the horizon
  &mdash;a bleak outlook. Which way should he ride?</p>

  <p>A loud outburst of curses roared behind him, a whip snapped above him, he
  stepped aside and barely from under the feet of the leaders as a long team
  wound by with the freight wagon creaking and swaying and rumbling behind it.
  The driver leaned from his seat in passing and volleyed a few crackling
  remarks in the very ear of Terry. It was strange that he did not resent it.
  Ordinarily he would have wanted to, climb onto that seat and roll the driver
  down in the dust, but today he lacked ambition. Pain numbed him, a peculiar
  mental pain. And, with the world free before him to roam in, he felt
  imprisoned.</p>

  <p>He turned. Someone was laughing at him from the veranda of the hotel and
  pointing him out to another, who laughed raucously in turn. Terry knew what
  was in their minds. A man who allowed himself to be cursed by a passing
  teamster was not worthy of the gun strapped at his thigh. He watched their
  faces as through a cloud, turned again, saw the door of the gambling hall
  open to allow someone to come out, and was invited by the cool, dim interior.
  He crossed the street and passed through the door.</p>

  <p>He was glad, instantly. Inside there was a blanket of silence; beyond the
  window the sun was a white rain of heat, blinding and appalling. But inside
  his shoes took hold on a floor moist from a recent scrubbing and soft with
  the wear of rough boots; and all was dim, quiet, hushed.</p>

  <p>There was not a great deal of business in the place, naturally, at this
  hour of the day. And the room seemed so large, the tables were so numerous,
  that Terry wondered how so small a town could support it. Then he remembered
  the mine and everything was explained. People who dug gold like dirt spent it
  in the same spirit. Half a dozen men were here and there, playing in what
  seemed a listless manner, save when you looked close.</p>

  <p>Terry slumped into a big chair in the darkest corner and relaxed until the
  coolness had worked through his skin and into his blood. Presently he looked
  about him to find something to do, and his eye dropped naturally on the first
  thing that made a noise&mdash;roulette. For a moment he watched the spinning
  disk. The man behind the table on his high stool was whirling the thing for
  his own amusement, it seemed. Terry walked over and looked on.</p>

  <p>He hardly knew the game. But he was fascinated by the motions of the ball;
  one was never able to tell where it would stop, on one of the thirty-six
  numbers, on the red or on the black, on the odd or the even. He visualized a
  frantic, silent crowd around the wheel listening to the click of the
  ball.</p>

  <p>And now he noted that the wheel had stopped the last four times on the
  odd. He jerked a five-dollar gold piece out of his pocket and placed it on
  the even. The wheel spun, clicked to a stop, and the rake of the croupier
  slicked his five dollars away across the smooth-worn top of the table.</p>

  <p>How very simple! But certainly the wheel must stop on the even this time,
  having struck the odd five times in a row. He placed ten dollars on the
  even.</p>

  <p>He did not feel that it was gambling. He had never gambled in his life,
  for Elizabeth Cornish had raised him to look on gambling not as a sin, but as
  a crowning folly. However, this was surely not gambling. There was no
  temptation. Not a word had been spoken to him since he entered the place.
  There was no excitement, no music, none of the drink and song of which he had
  heard so much in robbing men of their cooler senses. It was only his little
  system that tempted him on.</p>

  <p>He did not know that all gambling really begins with the creation of a
  system that will beat the game. And when a man follows a system, he is
  started on the most cold-blooded gambling in the world.</p>

  <p>Again the disk stopped, and the ball clicked softly and the ten dollars
  slid away behind the rake of the man on the stool. This would never do!
  Fifteen dollars gone out of a total capital of fifty! He doubled with some
  trepidation again. Thirty dollars wagered. The wheel spun&mdash;the money
  disappeared under the rake.</p>

  <p>Terry felt like setting his teeth. Instead, he smiled. He drew out his
  last five dollars and wagered it with a coldness that seemed to make sure of
  loss, on a single number. The wheel spun, clicked; he did not even watch, and
  was turning away when a sound of a little musical shower of gold attracted
  him. Gold was being piled before him. Five times thirty-six made one hundred
  and eighty dollars he had won! He came back to the table, scooped up his
  winnings carelessly and bent a kinder eye upon the wheel. He felt that there
  was a sort of friendly entente between them.</p>

  <p>It was time to go now, however. He sauntered to the door with a guilty
  chill in the small of his back, half expecting reproaches to be shouted after
  him for leaving the game when he was so far ahead of it. But apparently the
  machine which won without remorse lost without complaint.</p>

  <p>At the door he made half a pace into the white heat of the sunlight. Then
  he paused, a cool edging of shadow falling across one shoulder while the heat
  burned through the shirt of the other. Why go on?</p>

  <p>Across the street the man on the veranda of the hotel began laughing again
  and pointing him out. Terry himself looked the fellow over in an odd fashion,
  not with anger or with irritation, but with a sort of cold calculation. The
  fellow was trim enough in the legs. But his shoulders were fat from lack of
  work, and the bulge of flesh around the armpits would probably make him slow
  in drawing a gun.</p>

  <p>He shrugged his own lithe shoulders in contempt and turned. The man on the
  stool behind the roulette wheel was yawning until his jaw muscles stood out
  in hard, pointed ridges, and his cheeks fell in ridiculously. Terry went
  back. He was not eager to win; but the gleam of colors on the wheel
  fascinated him. He placed five dollars, saw the wheel win, took in his
  winnings without emotion.</p>

  <p>While he scooped the two coins up, he did not see the croupier turn his
  head and shoot a single glance to a fat, squat man in the corner of the room,
  a glance to which the fat man responded with the slightest of nods and
  smiles. He was the owner. And he was not particularly happy at the thought of
  some hundred and fifty dollars being taken out of his treasury by some chance
  stranger.</p>

  <p>Terry did not see the glance, and before long he was incapable of seeing
  anything saving the flash of the disk, the blur of the alternate colors as
  they spun together. He paid no heed to the path of the sunlight as it
  stretched along the floor under the window and told of a westering sun. The
  first Terry knew of it he was standing in a warm pool of gold, but he gave
  the sun at his feet no more than a casual glance. It was metallic gold that
  he was fascinated by and the whims and fancies of that singular wheel. Twice
  that afternoon his fortune had mounted above three thousand
  dollars&mdash;once it mounted to an even six thousand. He had stopped to
  count his winnings at this point, and on the verge of leaving decided to make
  it an even ten thousand before he went away. And five minutes later he was
  gambling with five hundred in his wallet.</p>

  <p>When the sunlight grew yellow, other men began to enter the room. Terry
  was still at his post. He did not see them. There was no human face in the
  world for him except the colorless face of the croupier, and the long, pale
  eyelashes that lifted now and then over greenish-orange eyes. And Terry did
  not heed when he was shouldered by the growing crowd around the wheel.</p>

  <p>He only knew that other bets were being placed and that it was a nuisance,
  for the croupier took much longer in paying debts and collecting winnings, so
  that the wheel spun less often.</p>

  <p>Meantime he was by no means unnoticed. A little whisper had gone the
  rounds that a real plunger was in town. And when men came into the hall,
  their attention was directed automatically by the turn of other eyes toward
  six feet of muscular manhood, heavy-shouldered and erect, with a flare of a
  red silk bandanna around his throat and a heavy sombrero worn tilted a little
  to one side and back on his head.</p>

  <p>"He's playing a system," said someone. "Been standing there all afternoon
  and making poor Pedro&mdash;the thief!&mdash;sweat and shake in his
  boots."</p>

  <p>In fact, the owner of the place had lost his complacence and his smile
  together. He approached near to the wheel and watched its spin with a face
  turned sallow and flat of cheek from anxiety. For with the setting of the sun
  it seemed that luck flooded upon Terry Hollis. He began to bet in chunks of
  five hundred, alternating between the red and the odd, and winning with
  startling regularity. His winnings were now shoved into an awkward canvas
  bag. Twenty thousand dollars! That had grown from the fifty.</p>

  <p>No wonder the crowd had two looks for Terry. His face had lost its color
  and grown marvellously expressionless.</p>

  <p>"The real gambler's look," they said.</p>

  <p>His mouth was pinched at the corners, and otherwise his expression never
  varied.</p>

  <p>Once he turned. A broad-faced man, laughing and obviously too self-
  contented to see what he was doing, trod heavily on the toes of Terry,
  stepping past the latter to get his winnings. He was caught by the shoulder
  and whirled around. The crowd saw the tall man draw his right foot back,
  balance, lift a trifle on his toes, and then a balled fist shot up, caught
  the broad-faced man under the chin and dumped him in a crumpled heap half a
  dozen feet away. They picked him up and took him away, a stunned wreck. Terry
  had turned back to his game, and in ten seconds had forgotten what he had
  done.</p>

  <p>But the crowd remembered, and particularly he who had twice laughed at
  Terry from the veranda of the hotel.</p>

  <p>The heap in the canvas sack diminished, shrank&mdash;he dumped the
  remainder of the contents into his pocket. He had been betting in solid lumps
  of a thousand for the past twenty minutes, and the crowd watched in
  amazement. This was drunken gambling, but the fellow was obviously sober.
  Then a hand touched the shoulder of Terry.</p>

  <p>"Just a minute, partner."</p>

  <p>He looked into the face of a big man, as tall as he and far heavier of
  build: a magnificent big head, heavily marked features, a short-cropped black
  beard that gave him dignity. A middle-aged man, about forty-five, and still
  in the prime of life.</p>

  <p>"Lemme pass a few words with you."</p>

  <p>Terry drew back to the side.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap22"
     name="chap22">CHAPTER 22</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"My Name's Pollard," said the older man. "Joe Pollard."</p>

  <p>"Glad to know you, sir. My name&mdash;is Terry." The other admitted this
  reticence with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"I got a name around here for keeping my mouth shut and not butting in on
  another gent's game. But I always noticed that when a gent is in a losing
  run, half the time he don't know it. Maybe that might be the way with you. I
  been watching and seen your winnings shrink considerable lately."</p>

  <p>Terry weighed his money. "Yes, it's shrunk a good deal."</p>

  <p>"Stand out of the game till later on. Come over and have a bite to eat
  with me."</p>

  <p>He went willingly, suddenly aware of a raging appetite and a dinner long
  postponed. The man of the black beard was extremely friendly.</p>

  <p>"One of the prettiest runs I ever see, that one you made," he confided
  when they were at the table in the hotel. "You got a system, I figure."</p>

  <p>"A new one," said Terry. "I've never played before."</p>

  <p>The other blinked.</p>

  <p>"Beginner's luck, I suppose," said Terry frankly. "I started with fifty,
  and now I suppose I have about eight hundred."</p>

  <p>"Not bad, not bad," said the other. "Too bad you didn't stop half an hour
  before. Just passing through these parts?"</p>

  <p>"I'm looking for a job," said Terry. "Can you tell me where to start
  hunting? Cows are my game."</p>

  <p>The other paused a moment and surveyed his companion. There seemed just a
  shade of doubt in his eyes. They were remarkably large and yellowish gray,
  those eyes of Joe Pollard, and now and again when he grew thoughtful they
  became like clouded agate. They had that color now as he gazed at Terry.
  Eventually his glance cleared.</p>

  <p>"I got a little work of my own," he declared. "My range is all clogged up
  with varmints. Any hand with a gun and traps?"</p>

  <p>"Pretty fair hand," said Terry modestly.</p>

  <p>And he was employed on the spot.</p>

  <p>He felt one reassuring thing about his employer&mdash;that no echo out of
  his past or the past of his father would make the man discharge him. Indeed,
  taking him all in all, there was under the kindliness of Joe Pollard an
  indescribable basic firmness. His eyes, for example, in their habit of
  looking straight at one, reminded him of the eyes of Denver. His voice was
  steady and deep and mellow, and one felt that it might be expanded to an
  enormous volume. Such a man would not fly off into snap judgments and become
  alarmed because an employee had a past or a strange name.</p>

  <p>They paid a short visit to the gambling hall after dinner, and then got
  their horses. Pollard was struck dumb with admiration at the sight of the
  blood- bay.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you been up the Bear Creek way?" he asked Terry.</p>

  <p>And when the latter admitted that he knew something of the Blue Mountain
  country, the rancher exclaimed: "By the Lord, partner, I'd say that hoss is a
  ringer for El Sangre."</p>

  <p>"Pretty close to a ringer," said Terry. "This is El Sangre himself."</p>

  <p>They were jogging out of town. The rancher turned in the saddle and
  crossed his companion with one of his searching glances, but returned no
  reply. Presently, however, he sent his own capable Steeldust into a sharp
  gallop; El Sangre roused to a flowing pace and held the other even without
  the slightest difficulty. At this Pollard drew rein with an exclamation.</p>

  <p>"El Sangre as sure as I live!" he declared. "Ain't nothing else in these
  parts that calls itself a hoss and slides over the ground the way El Sangre
  does. Partner, what sort of a price would you set on El Sangre, maybe?"</p>

  <p>"His weight in gold," said Terry.</p>

  <p>The rancher cursed softly, without seeming altogether pleased. And
  thereafter during the ride his glance continually drifted toward the
  brilliant bay&mdash;brilliant even in the pallor of the clear mountain
  starlight.</p>

  <p>He explained this by saying after a time: "I been my whole life in these
  parts without running across a hoss that could pack me the way a man ought to
  be packed on a hoss. I weigh two hundred and thirty, son, and it busts the
  back of a horse in the mountains. Now, you ain't a flyweight yourself, and El
  Sangre takes you along like you was a feather."</p>

  <p>Steeldust was already grunting at every sharp rise, and El Sangre had not
  even broken out in perspiration.</p>

  <p>A mile or so out of the town they left the road and struck onto a mere
  semblance of a trail, broad enough, but practically as rough as nature chose
  to make it. This wound at sharp and ever-changing angles into the hills, and
  presently they were pressing through a dense growth of lodgepole pine.</p>

  <p>It seemed strange to Terry that a prosperous rancher with an outfit of any
  size should have a road no more beaten than this one leading to his place.
  But he was thinking too busily of other things to pay much heed to such
  surmises and small events. He was brooding over the events of the afternoon.
  If his exploits in the gaming hall should ever come to the ear of Aunt
  Elizabeth, he was certain enough that he would be finally damned in her
  judgment. Too often he had heard her express an opinion of those who lived by
  "chance and their wits," as she phrased it. And the thought of it irked
  him.</p>

  <p>He roused himself out of his musing. They had come out from the trees and
  were in sight of a solidly built house on the hill. There was one thing which
  struck his mind at once. No attempt had been made to find level for the
  foundation. The log structure had been built apparently at random on the
  slope. It conformed, at vast waste of labor, to the angle of the base and the
  irregularities of the soil. This, perhaps, made it seem smaller than it was.
  They caught the scent of wood smoke, and then saw a pale drift of the smoke
  itself.</p>

  <p>A flurry of music escaped by the opening of a door and was shut out by the
  closing of it. It was a moment before Terry, startled, had analyzed the
  sound. Unquestionably it was a piano. But how in the world, and why in the
  world, had it been carted to the top of this mountain?</p>

  <p>He glanced at his companion with a new respect and almost with a
  suspicion.</p>

  <p>"Up to some damn doings again," growled the big man. "Never got no peace
  nor quiet up my way."</p>

  <p>Another surprise was presently in store for Terry. Behind the house, which
  grew in proportions as they came closer, they reached a horse shed, and when
  they dismounted, a servant came out for the horses. Outside of the Cornish
  ranch he did not know of many who afforded such luxuries.</p>

  <p>However, El Sangre could not be handled by another, and Terry put up his
  horse and found the rancher waiting for him when he came out. Inside the shed
  he had found ample bins of barley and oats and good grain hay. And in the
  stalls his practiced eye scanned the forms of a round dozen fine horses with
  points of blood and bone that startled him.</p>

  <p>Coming to the open again, he probed the darkness as well as he could to
  gain some idea of the ranch which furnished and supported all these evidences
  of prosperity. But so far as he could make out, there was only a jumble of
  ragged hilltops behind the house, and before it the slope fell away steeply
  to the valley far below. He had not realized before that they had climbed so
  high or so far.</p>

  <p>Joe Pollard was humming. Terry joined him on the way to the house with a
  deepened sense of awe; he was even beginning to feel that there was a touch
  or two of mystery in the make-up of the man.</p>

  <p>Proof of the solidity with which the log house was built was furnished at
  once. Coming to the house, there was only a murmur of voices and of music.
  The moment they opened the door, a roar of singing voices and a jangle of
  piano music rushed into their ears.</p>

  <p>Terry found himself in a very long room with a big table in the center and
  a piano at the farther end. The ceiling sloped down from the right to the
  left. At the left it descended toward the doors of the kitchen and
  storerooms; at the right it rose to the height of two full stories. One of
  these was occupied by a series of heavy posts on which hung saddles and
  bridles and riding equipment of all kinds, and the posts supported a balcony
  onto which opened several doors&mdash;of sleeping rooms, no doubt. As for the
  wall behind the posts, it, too, was pierced with several openings, but Terry
  could not guess at the contents of the rooms. But he was amazed by the size
  of the structure as it was revealed to him from within. The main room was
  like some baronial hall of the old days of war and plunder. A role, indeed,
  into which it was not difficult to fit the burly Pollard and the dignity of
  his beard.</p>

  <p>Four men were around the piano, and a girl sat at the keys, splashing out
  syncopated music while the men roared the chorus of the song. But at the
  sound of the closing of the door all five turned toward the newcomers, the
  girl looking over her shoulder and keeping the soft burden of the song still
  running.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap23"
     name="chap23">CHAPTER 23</a></h2>

  <p class="first">So turned, Terry could not see her clearly. He caught a
  glimmer of red bronze hair, dark in shadow and brilliant in high lights, and
  a sheen of greenish eyes. Otherwise, he only noted the casual manner in which
  she acknowledged the introduction, unsmiling, indifferent, as Pollard said:
  "Here's my daughter Kate. This is Terry&mdash;a new hand."</p>

  <p>It seemed to Terry that as he said this the rancher made a gesture as of
  warning, though this, no doubt, could be attributed to his wish to silently
  explain away the idiosyncrasy of Terry in using his first name only. He was
  presented in turn to the four men, and thought them the oddest collection he
  had ever laid eyes on.</p>

  <p>Slim Dugan was tall, but not so tall as he looked, owing to his very small
  head and narrow shoulders. His hair was straw color, excessively silky, and
  thin as the hair of a year-old child. There were other points of interest in
  Slim Dugan; his feet, for instance, were small as the feet of a girl,
  accentuated by the long, narrow riding boots, and his hands seemed to be
  pulled out to a great and unnecessary length. They made up for it by their
  narrowness.</p>

  <p>His exact opposite was Marty Cardiff, chunky, fat, it seemed, until one
  noted the roll and bulge of the muscles at the shoulders. His head was
  settled into his fat shoulders somewhat in the manner of Denver's, Terry
  thought.</p>

  <p>Oregon Charlie looked the part of an Indian, with his broad nose and high
  cheekbones, flat face, slanted dark eyes; but his skin was a dead and
  peculiar white. He was a down-headed man, and one could rarely imagine him
  opening his lips to speak; he merely grunted as he shook hands with the
  stranger.</p>

  <p>To finish the picture, there was a man as huge as Joe Pollard himself, and
  as powerful, to judge by appearances. His face was burned to a jovial red;
  his hair was red also, and there was red hair on the backs of his freckled
  hands.</p>

  <p>All these men met Terry with cordial nods, but there was a carelessness
  about their demeanor which seemed strange to Terry. In his experience, the
  men of the mountains were a timid or a blustering lot before newcomers,
  uneasy, and anxious to establish their place. But these men acted as if
  meeting unknown men were a part of their common, daily experience. They were
  as much at their ease as social lions.</p>

  <p>Pollard was explaining the presence of Terry.</p>

  <p>"He's come up to clean out the varmints," he said to the others. "They
  been getting pretty thick on the range, you know."</p>

  <p>"You came in just wrong," complained Kate, while the men turned four pairs
  of grave eyes upon Terry and seemed to be judging him. "I got Oregon singing
  at last, and he was doing fine. Got a real voice, Charlie has. Regular
  branded baritone, I'll tell a man."</p>

  <p>"Strike up agin for us, Charlie," said Pollard good-naturedly. "You don't
  never make much more noise'n a grizzly."</p>

  <p>But Charlie looked down at his hands and a faint spot of red appeared in
  his cheek. Obviously he was much embarrassed. And when he looked up, it was
  to fix a glance of cold suspicion upon Terry, as though warning him not to
  take this talk of social acquirements as an index to his real character.</p>

  <p>"Get us some coffee, Kate," said Pollard. "Turned off cold coming up the
  hill."</p>

  <p>She did not rise. She had turned around to her music again, and now she
  acknowledged the order by lifting her head and sending a shrill whistle
  through the room. Her father started violently.</p>

  <p>"Damn it, Kate, don't do that!"</p>

  <p>"The only thing that'll bring Johnny on the run," she responded
  carelessly.</p>

  <p>And, indeed, the door on the left of the room flew open a moment later,
  and a wide-eyed Chinaman appeared with a long pigtail jerking about his head
  as he halted and looked about in alarm.</p>

  <p>"Coffee for the boss and the new hand," said Kate, without turning her
  head, as soon as she heard the door open. "Pronto, Johnny."</p>

  <p>Johnny snarled an indistinct something and withdrew muttering.</p>

  <p>"You'll have Johnny quitting the job," complained Pollard, frowning. "You
  can't scare the poor devil out of his skin like that every time you want
  coffee. Besides, why didn't you get up and get it for us yourself?"</p>

  <p>Still she did not turn; but, covering a yawn, replied: "Rather sit here
  and play."</p>

  <p>Her father swelled a moment in rage, but he subsided again without audible
  protest. Only he sent a scowl at Terry as though daring him to take notice of
  this insolence. As for the other men, they had scattered to various parts of
  the room and remained there, idly, while the boss and the new hand drank the
  scalding coffee of Johnny. All this time Pollard remained deep in thought.
  His meditations exploded as he banged the empty cup back on the table.</p>

  <p>"Kate, this stuff has got to stop. Understand?"</p>

  <p>The soft jingling of the piano continued without pause.</p>

  <p>"Stop that damned noise!"</p>

  <p>The music paused. Terry felt the long striking muscles leap into hard
  ridges along his arms, but glancing at the other four, he found that they
  were taking the violence of Pollard quite as a matter of course. One was
  whittling, another rolled a cigarette, and all of them, if they took any
  visible notice of the argument, did so with the calmest of side glances.</p>

  <p>"Turn around!" roared Pollard.</p>

  <p>His daughter turned slowly and faced him. Not white-faced with fear, but
  to the unutterable astonishment of Terry she was quietly looking her father
  up and down. Pollard sprang to his feet and struck the table so that it
  quivered through all its massive length.</p>

  <p>"Are you trying to shame me before a stranger?" thundered the big man. "Is
  that the scene?"</p>

  <p>She flicked Terry Hollis with a glance. "I think he'll understand and make
  allowances."</p>

  <p>It brought the heavy fist smashing on the table again. And an ugly feeling
  rose in Hollis that the big fellow might put hands on his daughter.</p>

  <p>"And what d'you mean by that? What in hell d'you mean by that?"</p>

  <p>In place of wincing, she in turn came to her feet gracefully. There had
  been such an easy dignity about her sitting at the piano that she had seemed
  tall to Terry. Now that she stood up, he was surprised to see that she was
  not a shade more than average height, beautifully and strongly made.</p>

  <p>"You've gone about far enough with your little joke," said the girl, and
  her voice was low, but with an edge of vibrancy that went through Hollis.
  "And you're going to stop&mdash;pronto!"</p>

  <p>There was a flash of teeth as she spoke, and a quiver through her body.
  Terry had never seen such passion, such unreasoning, wild passion, as that
  which had leaped on the girl. Though her face was not contorted, danger spoke
  from every line of it. He made himself tense, prepared for a similar outbreak
  from the father, but the latter relaxed as suddenly as his daughter had
  become furious.</p>

  <p>"There you go," he complained, with a sort of heavy whine. "Always flying
  off the handle. Always turning into a wildcat when I try to reason with
  you!"</p>

  <p>"Reason!" cried the girl. "Reason!"</p>

  <p>Joe Pollard grew downcast under her scorn. And Terry, sensing that the
  crisis of the argument had passed, watched the other four men in the room.
  They had not paid the slightest attention to the debate during its later
  phases. And two of them&mdash;Slim and huge Phil Marvin&mdash;had begun to
  roll dice on a folded blanket, the little ivories winking in the light
  rapidly until they came to a rest at the farther end of the cloth. Possibly
  this family strife was a common thing in the Pollard household. At any rate,
  the father now passed off from accusation to abrupt apology. "You always get
  me riled at the end of the day, Kate. Damn it! Can't you never bear with a
  gent?"</p>

  <p>The tigerish alertness passed from Kate Pollard. She was filled all at
  once with a winning gentleness and, crossing to her father, took his heavy
  hands in hers.</p>

  <p>"I reckon I'm a bad one," she accused herself. "I try to get over
  tantrums&mdash;but&mdash;I can't help it! Something&mdash;just sort of grabs
  me by the throat when I get mad. I&mdash;I see red."</p>

  <p>"Hush up, honey," said the big man tenderly, and he ran his thick fingers
  over her hair. "You ain't so bad. And all that's bad in you comes out of me.
  You forget and I'll forget."</p>

  <p>He waved across the table.</p>

  <p>"Terry'll be thinking we're a bunch of wild Indians the way we been
  actin'."</p>

  <p>"Oh!"</p>

  <p>Plainly she was recalled to the presence of the stranger for the first
  time in many minutes and, dropping her chin in her hand, she studied the new
  arrival.</p>

  <p>He found it difficult to meet her glance. The Lord had endowed Terry
  Hollis with a remarkable share of good looks, and it was not the first time
  that he had been investigated by the eyes of a woman. But in all his life he
  had never been subjected to an examination as minute, as insolently frank as
  this one. He felt himself taken part and parcel, examined in detail as to
  forehead, chin, and eyes and heft of shoulders, and then weighed altogether.
  In self-defense he looked boldly back at her, making himself examine her in
  equal detail. Seeing her so close, he was aware of a marvellously delicate
  olive- tanned skin with delightful tints of rose just beneath the surface. He
  found himself saying inwardly: "It's easy to look at her. It's very easy. By
  the Lord, she's beautiful!"</p>

  <p>As for the girl, it seemed that she was not quite sure in her judgment.
  For now she turned to her father with a faint frown of wonder. And again it
  seemed to Terry that Joe Pollard made an imperceptible sign, such as he had
  made to the four men when he introduced Terry.</p>

  <p>But now he broke into breezy talk.</p>

  <p>"Met Terry down in Pedro's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The girl seemed to have dismissed Terry from her mind already, for she
  broke in: "Crooked game he's running, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"I thought so till today. Then I seen Terry, here, trim Pedro for a flat
  twenty thousand!"</p>

  <p>"Oh," nodded the girl. Again her gaze reverted leisurely to the stranger
  and with a not unflattering interest.</p>

  <p>"And then I seen him lose most of it back again. Roulette."</p>

  <p>She nodded, keeping her eyes on Terry, and the boy found himself desiring
  mightily to discover just what was going on behind the changing green of her
  eyes. He was shocked when he discovered. It came like the break of high dawn
  in the mountains of the Big Bend. Suddenly she had smiled openly, frankly.
  "Hard luck, partner!"</p>

  <p>A little shivering sense of pleasure ran through him. He knew that he had
  been admitted by her&mdash;accepted.</p>

  <p>Her father had thrown up his head.</p>

  <p>"Someone come in the back way. Oregon, go find out!"</p>

  <p>Dark-eyed Oregon Charlie slipped up and through the door. Everyone in the
  room waited, a little tense, with lifted heads. Slim was studying the last
  throw that Phil Marvin had made. Terry could not but wonder what significance
  that "back way" had. Presently Oregon reappeared.</p>

  <p>"Pete's come."</p>

  <p>"The hell!"</p>

  <p>"Went upstairs."</p>

  <p>"Wants to be alone," interrupted the girl. "He'll come down and talk when
  he feels like it. That's Pete's way."</p>

  <p>"Watching us, maybe," growled Joe Pollard, with a shade of uneasiness
  still. "Damned funny gent, Pete is. Watches a man like a cat; watches a
  gopher hole all day, maybe. And maybe the gent he watches is a friend he's
  known for ten years. Well&mdash;let Pete go. They ain't no explaining
  him."</p>

  <p>Through the last part of his talk, and through the heaviness of his voice,
  cut another tone, lighter, sharper, venomous: "Phil, you gummed them dice
  that last time!"</p>

  <p>Joe Pollard froze in place; the eyes of the girl widened. Terry, looking
  across the room, saw Phil Marvin scoop up the dice and start to his feet.</p>

  <p>"You lie, Slim!"</p>

  <p>Instinctively Terry slipped his hand onto his gun. It was what Phil Marvin
  had done, as a matter of fact. He stood swelling and glowering, staring down
  at Slim Dugan. Slim had not risen. His thin, lithe body was coiled, and he
  reminded Terry in ugly fashion of a snake ready to strike. His hand was not
  near his gun. It was the calm courage and self-confidence of a man who is
  sure of himself and of his enemy. Terry had heard of it before, but never
  seen it. As for Phil, it was plain that he was ill at ease in spite of his
  bulk and the advantage of his position. He was ready to fight. But he was not
  at all pleased with the prospect.</p>

  <p>Terry again glanced at the witnesses. Every one of them was alert, but
  there was none of that fear which comes in the faces of ordinary men when
  strife between men is at hand. And suddenly Terry knew that every one of the
  five men in the room was an old familiar of danger, every one of them a past
  master of gun fighting!</p>

  <h2><a id="chap24"
     name="chap24">CHAPTER 24</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The uneasy wait continued for a moment or more. The whisper
  of Joe Pollard to his daughter barely reached the ear of Terry.</p>

  <p>"Cut in between 'em, girl. You can handle 'em. I can't!"</p>

  <p>She responded instantly, before Terry recovered from his shock of
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"Slim, keep away from your gun!"</p>

  <p>She spoke as she whirled from her chair to her feet. It was strange to see
  her direct all her attention to Slim, when Phil Marvin seemed the one about
  to draw.</p>

  <p>"I ain't even nearin' my gun," asserted Slim truthfully. "It's Phil that's
  got a strangle hold on his."</p>

  <p>"You're waiting for him to draw," said the girl calmly enough. "I know
  you, Slim. Phil, don't be a fool. Drop your hand away from that gat!"</p>

  <p>He hesitated; she stepped directly between him and his enemy of the moment
  and jerked the gun from its holster. Then she faced Slim. Obviously Phil was
  not displeased to have the matter taken out of his hands; obviously Slim was
  not so pleased. He looked coldly up to the girl.</p>

  <p>"This is between him and me," he protested. "I don't need none of your
  help, Kate."</p>

  <p>"Don't you? You're going to get it, though. Gimme that gun, Slim
  Dugan!"</p>

  <p>"I want a square deal," he complained. "I figure Phil has been crooking
  the dice on me."</p>

  <p>"Bah! Besides, I'll give you a square deal."</p>

  <p>She held out her hand for the weapon.</p>

  <p>"Got any doubts about me being square, Slim?"</p>

  <p>"Kate, leave this to me!"</p>

  <p>"Why, Slim, I wouldn't let you run loose now for a million. You got that
  ugly look in your eyes. I know you, partner!"</p>

  <p>And to the unutterable astonishment of Terry, the man pulled his gun from
  its holster and passed it up to her, his eyes fighting hers, his hand moving
  slowly. She stepped back, weighing the heavy weapons in her hands. Then she
  faced Phil Marvin with glittering eyes.</p>

  <p>"It ain't the first time you been accused of queer stunts with the dice.
  What's the straight of it, Phil? Been doing anything to these dice?"</p>

  <p>"Me? Sure I ain't!"</p>

  <p>Her glance lingered on him the least part of a second.</p>

  <p>"H'm!" said the girl. "Maybe not."</p>

  <p>Slim was on his feet, eager. "Take a look at 'em, Kate. Take a look at
  them dice!"</p>

  <p>She held them up to the light&mdash;then dropped them into a pocket of her
  skirt. "I'll look at 'em in the morning, Slim."</p>

  <p>"The stuff'll be dry by that time!"</p>

  <p>"Dry or not, that's what I'm going to do. I won't trust lamplight."</p>

  <p>Slim turned on his heel and flung himself sulkily down on the blanket,
  fighting her with sullen eyes. She turned on Phil.</p>

  <p>"How much d'you win?"</p>

  <p>"Nothin'. Just a couple of hundred."</p>

  <p>"Just a couple of hundred! You call that nothing?"</p>

  <p>Phil grunted. The other men leaned forward in their interest to watch the
  progress of the trial, all saving Joe Pollard, who sat with his elbows braced
  in sprawling fashion on the table, at ease, his eyes twinkling contentedly at
  the girl. Why she refused to examine the dice at once was plain to Terry. If
  they proved to have been gummed, it would mean a gun fight with the men at a
  battling temperature. In the morning when they had cooled down, it might be a
  different matter. Terry watched her in wonder. His idea of an efficient woman
  was based on Aunt Elizabeth, cold of eye and brain, practical in methods on
  the ranch, keen with figures. The efficiency of this slip of a girl was a
  different matter, a thing of passion, of quick insight, of lightning guesses.
  He could see the play of eager emotion in her face as she studied Phil
  Marvin. And how could she do justice? Terry was baffled.</p>

  <p>"How long you two been playing?" "About twenty minutes."</p>

  <p>"Not more'n five!" cut in Slim hotly.</p>

  <p>"Shut up, Slim!" she commanded. "I'm running this here game; Phil, how
  many straight passes did you make?"</p>

  <p>"Me? Oh, I dunno. Maybe&mdash;five."</p>

  <p>"Five straight passes!" said the girl. "Five straight passes!"</p>

  <p>"You heard me say it," growled big Phil Marvin.</p>

  <p>All at once she laughed.</p>

  <p>"Phil, give that two hundred back to Slim!"</p>

  <p>It came like a bolt from the blue, this decision. Marvin hesitated, shook
  his head.</p>

  <p>"Damned if I do. I don't back down. I won it square!"</p>

  <p>"Listen to me," said the girl. Instead of threatening, as Terry expected,
  she had suddenly become conciliatory. She stepped close to him and dropped a
  slim hand on his burly shoulder. "Ain't Slim a pal of yours? You and him,
  ain't you stuck together through thick and thin? He thinks you didn't win
  that coin square. Is Slim's friendship worth two hundred to you, or ain't it?
  Besides, you ain't lying down to nobody. Why, you big squarehead, Phil, don't
  we all know that you'd fight a bull with your bare hands? Who'd call you
  yaller? We'd simply say you was square, Phil, and you know it."</p>

  <p>There was a pause. Phil was biting his lip, scowling at Slim. Slim was
  sneering in return. It seemed that she had failed. Even if she forced Phil to
  return the money, he and Slim would hate each other as long as they lived.
  And Terry gained a keen impression that if the hatred continued, one of them
  would die very soon indeed. Her solution of the problem was a strange one.
  She faced them both.</p>

  <p>"You two big sulky babies!" she exclaimed. "Slim, what did Phil do for you
  down in Tecomo? Phil, did Slim stand by you last April&mdash;you know the
  time? Why, boys, you're just being plain foolish. Get up, both of you, and
  take a walk outside where you'll get cooled down."</p>

  <p>Slim rose. He and Phil walked slowly toward the door, at a little distance
  from each other, one eyeing the other shrewdly. At the door they hesitated.
  Finally, Phil lurched forward and went out first. Slim glided after.</p>

  <p>"By heaven!" groaned Pollard as the door closed. "There goes two good men!
  Kate, what put this last fool idea into your head?"</p>

  <p>She did not answer for a moment, but dropped into a chair as though
  suddenly exhausted.</p>

  <p>"It'll work out," she said at length. "You wait for it!"</p>

  <p>"Well," grumbled her father, "the mischief is working. Run along to bed,
  will you?"</p>

  <p>She rose, wearily, and started across the room. But she turned before she
  passed out of their sight and leaned against one of the pillars.</p>

  <p>"Dad, why you so anxious to get me out of the way?"</p>

  <p>"What d'you mean by that? I got no reason. Run along and don't bother
  me!"</p>

  <p>He turned his shoulder on her. As for the girl, she remained a moment,
  looking thoughtfully at the broad back of Pollard. Then her glance shifted
  and dwelt a moment on Terry&mdash;with pity, he wondered?</p>

  <p>"Good night, boys!"</p>

  <p>When the door closed on her, Joe Pollard turned his attention more fully
  on his new employee, and when Terry suggested that it was time for him to
  turn in, his suggestion was hospitably put to one side. Pollard began talking
  genially of the mountains, of the "varmints" he expected Terry to clean out,
  and while he talked, he took out a broad silver dollar and began flicking it
  in the air and catching it in the calloused palm of his hand.</p>

  <p>"Call it," he interrupted himself to say to Terry.</p>

  <p>"Heads," said Terry carelessly.</p>

  <p>The coin spun up, flickered at the height of its rise, and rang loudly on
  the table.</p>

  <p>"You win," said Pollard. "Well, you're a lucky gent, Terry, but I'll go
  you ten you can't call it again."</p>

  <p>But again Terry called heads, and again the coin chimed, steadied, and
  showed the Grecian goddess. The rancher doubled his bet. He lost, doubled,
  lost again, doubled again, lost. A pile of money had appeared by magic before
  Terry.</p>

  <p>"I came to work for money," laughed Terry, "not <i>take</i> it away."</p>

  <p>"I always lose at this game," sighed Joe Pollard.</p>

  <p>The door opened, and Phil Marvin and Slim Dugan came back, talking and
  laughing together.</p>

  <p>"What d'you know about that?" Pollard exclaimed softly. "She guessed
  right. She always does! Oughta be a man, with a brain like she's got. Here we
  are again!"</p>

  <p>He spun the coin; it winked, fell, a streak of light, and again Terry had
  won. He began to grow excited. On the next throw he lost. A moment later his
  little pile of winnings had disappeared. And now he had forgotten the face of
  Joe Pollard, forgotten the room, forgotten everything except the thick thumb
  that snapped the coin into the air. The cold, quiet passion of the gambler
  grew in him. He was losing steadily. Out of his wallet came in a steady
  stream the last of his winnings at Pedro's. And still he played. Suddenly the
  wallet squeezed flat between his fingers.</p>

  <p>"Pollard," he said regretfully, "I'm broke."</p>

  <p>The other waved away the idea.</p>

  <p>"Break up a fine game like this because you're broke?" The cloudy agate
  eyes dwelt kindly on the face of Terry, and mysteriously as well. "That ain't
  nothing. Nothing between friends. You don't know the style of a man I am,
  Terry. Your word is as good as your money with me!"</p>

  <p>"I've no security&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't talk security. Think I'm a moneylender? This is a game. Come
  on!"</p>

  <p>Five minutes later Terry was three hundred behind. A mysterious providence
  seemed to send all the luck the way of the heavy, tanned thumb of
  Pollard.</p>

  <p>"That's my limit," he announced abruptly, rising.</p>

  <p>"No, no!" Pollard spread out his big hand on the table. "You got the red
  hoss, son. You can bet to a thousand. He's worth that&mdash;to me!"</p>

  <p>"I won't bet a cent on him," said Terry firmly.</p>

  <p>"Every damn cent I've won from you ag'in' the hoss, son. That's a lot of
  cash if you win. If you lose, you're just out that much hossflesh, and I'll
  give you a good enough cayuse to take El Sangre's place."</p>

  <p>"A dozen wouldn't take his place," insisted Terry.</p>

  <p>"That so?"</p>

  <p>Pollard leaned back in his chair and put a hand behind his neck to support
  his head. It seemed to Terry that the big man made some odd motion with his
  hidden fingers. At any rate, the four men who lounged on the farther side of
  the room now rose and slowly drifted in different directions. Oregon Charlie
  wandered toward the door. Slim sauntered to the window behind the piano and
  stood idly looking out into the night. Phil Marvin began to examine a saddle
  hanging from a peg on one of the posts, and finally, chunky Marty Cardiff
  strolled to the kitchen door and appeared to study the hinges.</p>

  <p>All these things were done casually, but Terry, his attention finally off
  the game, caught a meaning in them. Every exit was blocked for him. He was
  trapped at the will of Joe Pollard!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap25"
     name="chap25">CHAPTER 25</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Looking back, he could understand everything easily. The
  horse was the main objective of Pollard. He had won the money so as to tempt
  Terry to gamble with the value of the blood-bay. But by fair means or foul he
  intended to have El Sangre. And now, the moment his men were in place, a
  change came over Pollard. He straightened in the chair. A slight outthrust of
  his lower jaw made his face strangely brutal, conscienceless. And his cloudy
  agate eyes were unreadable.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Terry," he argued calmly, but Terry could see that the voice
  was raised so that it would undubitably reach the ears of the farthest of the
  four men. "I don't mind letting a gambling debt ride when a gent ain't got
  anything more to put up for covering his money. But when a gent has got more,
  I figure he'd ought to cover with it."</p>

  <p>Unreasoning anger swelled in the throat of Terry Hollis; the same blind
  passion which had surged in him before he started up at the Cornish table and
  revealed himself to the sheriff. And the similarity was what sobered him. It
  was the hunger to battle, to kill. And it seemed to him that Black Jack had
  stepped out of the old picture and now stood behind him, tempting him to
  strike.</p>

  <p>Another covert signal from Pollard. Every one of the four turned toward
  him. The chances of Terry were diminished, nine out of ten, for each of those
  four, he shrewdly guessed, was a practiced gunman. Cold reason came to
  Terry's assistance.</p>

  <p>"I told you when I was broke," he said gently. "I told you that I was
  through. You told me to go on."</p>

  <p>"I figured you was kidding me," said Pollard harshly. "I knew you still
  had El Sangre back. Son, I'm a kind sort of a man, I am. I got a name for
  it."</p>

  <p>In spite of himself a faint and cruel smile flickered at the corners of
  his mouth as he spoke. He became grave again.</p>

  <p>"But they's some things I can't stand. They's some things that I hate
  worse'n I hate poison. I won't say what one of 'em is. I leave it to you. And
  I ask you to keep in the game. A thousand bucks ag'in' a boss. Ain't that
  more'n fair?"</p>

  <p>He no longer took pains to disguise his voice. It was hard and heavy and
  rang into the ear of Terry. And the latter, feeling that his hour had come,
  looked deliberately around the room and took note of every guarded exit, the
  four men now openly on watch for any action on his part. Pollard himself sat
  erect, on the edge of his chair, and his right hand had disappeared beneath
  the table.</p>

  <p>"Suppose I throw the coin this time?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>"By God!" thundered Pollard, springing to his feet and throwing off the
  mask completely. "You damned skunk, are you accusin' me of crooking the throw
  of the coin?"</p>

  <p>Terry waited for the least moment&mdash;waited in a dull wonder to find
  himself unafraid. But there was no fear in him. There was only a cold,
  methodical calculation of chances. He told himself, deliberately, that no
  matter how fast Pollard might be, he would prove the faster. He would kill
  Pollard. And he would undoubtedly kill one of the others. And they, beyond a
  shadow of a doubt, would kill him. He saw all this as in a picture.</p>

  <p>"Pollard," he said, more gently than before, "you'll have to eat that
  talk!"</p>

  <p>A flash of bewilderment crossed the face of Pollard&mdash;then rage
  &mdash;then that slight contraction of the features which in some men
  precedes a violent effort.</p>

  <p>But the effort did not come. While Terry literally wavered on tiptoe, his
  nerves straining for the pull of his gun and the leap to one side as he sent
  his bullet home, a deep, unmusical voice cut in on them:</p>

  <p>"Just hold yourself up a minute, will you, Joe?"</p>

  <p>Terry looked up. On the balcony in front of the sleeping rooms of the
  second story, his legs spread apart, his hands shoved deep into his trouser
  pockets, his shapeless black hat crushed on the back of his head, and a broad
  smile on his ugly face, stood his nemesis&mdash;Denver the yegg!</p>

  <p>Pollard sprang back from the table and spoke with his face still turned to
  Terry.</p>

  <p>"Pete!" he called. "Come in!"</p>

  <p>But Denver, alias Shorty, alias Pete, merely laughed.</p>

  <p>"Come in nothing, you fool! Joe, you're about half a second from hell, and
  so's a couple more of you. D'you know who the kid is? Eh? I'll tell you,
  boys. It's the kid that dropped old Minter. It's the kid that beat foxy Joe
  Minter to the draw. It's young Hollis. Why, you damned blind men, look at his
  face! It's the son of Black Jack. It's Black Jack himself come back to
  us!"</p>

  <p>Joe Pollard had let his hand fall away from his gun. He gaped at Terry as
  though he were seeing a ghost. He came a long pace nearer and let his arms
  fall on the table, where they supported his weight.</p>

  <p>"Black Jack," he kept whispering. "Black Jack! God above, are you Black
  Jack's son?"</p>

  <p>And the bewildered Terry answered:</p>

  <p>"I'm his son. Whatever you think, and be damned to you all! I'm his son
  and I'm proud of it. Now get your gun!"</p>

  <p>But Joe Pollard became a great catapult that shot across the table and
  landed beside Terry. Two vast hands swallowed the hands of the younger man
  and crushed them to numbness.</p>

  <p>"Proud of it? God a'mighty, boy, why wouldn't you be? Black Jack's son!
  Pete, thank God you come in time!"</p>

  <p>"In time to save your head for you, Joe."</p>

  <p>"I believe it," said the big man humbly. "I b'lieve he would of cleaned up
  on me. Maybe on all of us. Black Jack would of come close to doing it. But
  you come in time, Pete. And I'll never forget it."</p>

  <p>While he spoke, he was still wringing the hands of Terry. Now he dragged
  the stunned Terry around the table and forced him down in his own huge,
  padded armchair, his sign of power. But it was only to drag him up from the
  chair again.</p>

  <p>"Lemme look at you! Black Jack's boy! As like Black Jack as ever I seen,
  too. But a shade taller. Eh, Pete? A shade taller. And a shade heavier in the
  shoulders. But you got the look. I might of knowed you by the look in your
  eyes. Hey, Slim, damn your good-for-nothing hide, drag Johnny here pronto by
  the back of the neck!"</p>

  <p>Johnny, the Chinaman, appeared, blinking at the lights. Joe Pollard
  clapped him on the shoulder with staggering force.</p>

  <p>"Johnny, you see!" a broad gesture to Terry. "Old friend. Just find out.
  Velly old friend. Like pretty much a whole damned lot. Get down in the
  cellar, you yaller old sinner, and get out the oldest bourbon I got there.
  You savvy? Pretty damned pronto&mdash;hurry up&mdash;quick&mdash;old keg. Git
  out!"</p>

  <p>Johnny was literally hurled out of the room toward the kitchen, trailing a
  crackle of strange-sounding but unmistakable profanity behind him. And Joe
  Pollard, perching his bulk on the edge of the table, introduced Terry to the
  boys again, for Oregon had come back with word that Kate would be out
  soon.</p>

  <p>"Here's Denver Pete. You know him already, and he's worth his weight in
  any man's company. Here's Slim Dugan, that could scent a big coin shipment a
  thousand miles away. Phil Marvin ain't any slouch at stalling a gent with a
  fat wallet and leading him up to be plucked. Marty Cardiff ain't half so tame
  as he looks, and he's the best trailer that ever squinted at a buzzard in the
  sky; he knows this whole country like a book. And Oregon Charlie is the best
  all-around man you ever seen, from railroads to stages. And me&mdash;I'm sort
  of a handyman. Well, Black Jack, your old man himself never got a finer crew
  together than this, eh?"</p>

  <p>Denver Pete had waited until his big friend finished. Then he remarked
  quietly: "All very pretty, partner, but Terry figures he walks the straight
  and narrow path. Savvy?"</p>

  <p>"Just a kid's fool hunch!" snorted Joe Pollard. "Didn't your dad show me
  the ropes? Wasn't it him that taught me all I ever knew? Sure it was, and I'm
  going to do the same for you, Terry. Damn my eyes if I ain't! And here I been
  sitting, trimming you! Son, take back the coin. I was sure playing a cheap
  game &mdash;and I apologize, man to man."</p>

  <p>But Terry shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You won it," he said quietly. "And you'll keep it."</p>

  <p>"Won nothing. I can call every coin I throw. I was stealing, not gambling.
  I was gold-digging! Take back the stuff!"</p>

  <p>"If I was fool enough to lose it that way, it'll stay lost," answered
  Terry.</p>

  <p>"But I won't keep it, son."</p>

  <p>"Then give it away. But not to me."</p>

  <p>"Black Jack&mdash;" began Pollard.</p>

  <p>But he received a signal from Denver Pete and abruptly changed the
  subject.</p>

  <p>"Let it go, then. They's plenty of loose coin rolling about this day. If
  you got a thin purse today, I'll make it fat for you in a week. But think of
  me stumbling on to you!"</p>

  <p>It was the first time that Terry had a fair opportunity to speak, and he
  made the best of it.</p>

  <p>"It's very pleasant to meet you&mdash;on this basis," he said. "But as for
  taking up&mdash;er&mdash;road life&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The lifted hand of Joe Pollard made it impossible for him to complete his
  sentence.</p>

  <p>"I know. You got scruples, son. Sure you got 'em. I used to have 'em, too,
  till your old man got 'em out of my head."</p>

  <p>Terry winced. But Joe Pollard rambled on, ignorant that he had struck a
  blow in the dark: "When I met up with the original Black Jack, I was slavin'
  my life away with a pick trying to turn ordinary quartz into pay dirt. Making
  a fool of myself, that's what I was doing. Along comes Black Jack. He needed
  a man. He picks me up and takes me along with him. I tried to talk Bible
  talk. He showed me where I was a fool.</p>

  <p>"'All you got to do,' he says to me, 'is to make sure that you ain't
  stealing from an honest man. And they's about one gent in three with money
  that's come by it honest, in this part of the world. The rest is just plain
  thieves, but they been clever enough to cover it up. Pick on that crew,
  Pollard, and squeeze 'em till they run money into your hand. I'll show you
  how to do it!'</p>

  <p>"Well, it come pretty hard to me at first. I didn't see how it was done.
  But he showed me. He'd send a scout around to a mining camp. If they was a
  crooked wheel in the gambling house that was making a lot of coin, Black Jack
  would slide in some night, stick up the works, and clean out with the loot.
  If they was some dirty dog that had jumped a claim and was making a pile of
  coin out of it, Black Jack would drop out of the sky onto him and take the
  gold."</p>

  <p>Terry listened, fascinated. He was having the workings of his father's
  mind re-created for him and spread plainly before his eyes. And there was a
  certain terror and also a certain attractiveness about what he
  discovered.</p>

  <p>"It sounds, maybe, like an easy thing to do, to just stick on the trail of
  them that you know are worse crooks than you. But it ain't. I've tried it.
  I've seen Black Jack pass up ten thousand like it was nothing, because the
  gent that had it come by it honest. But I can't do it, speaking in general.
  But I'll tell you more about the old man."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Terry, "but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And when you're with us&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You see," said Terry firmly, "I plan to do the work you asked me to do
  &mdash;kill what you wanted killed on the range. And when I've worked off the
  money I owe you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Before he could complete his sentence, a door opened on the far side of
  the room, and Kate Pollard entered again. She had risen from her bed in some
  haste to answer the summons of her father. Her bright hair poured across her
  shoulders, a heavy, greenish-blue dressing gown was drawn about her and held
  close with one hand at her breast. She came slowly toward them. And she
  seemed to Terry to have changed. There was less of the masculine about her
  than there had been earlier in the evening. Her walk was slow, her eyes were
  wide as though she had no idea what might await her, and the light glinted
  white on the untanned portion of her throat, and on her arm where the loose
  sleeve of the dressing gown fell back from it.</p>

  <p>"Kate," said her father, "I had to get you up to tell you the big news
  &mdash;biggest news you ever heard of! Girl, who've I always told you was the
  greatest gent that ever come into my life?"</p>

  <p>"Jack Hollis&mdash;Black Jack," she said, without hesitation. "According
  to <i>your</i> way of thinking, Dad!"</p>

  <p>Plainly her own conclusions might be very different.</p>

  <p>"According to anybody's way of thinking, as long as they was thinking
  right. And d'you know who we've got here with us now? Could you guess it in a
  thousand years? Why, the kid that come tonight. Black Jack as sure as if he
  was a picture out of a book, and me a blind fool that didn't know him. Kate,
  here's the second Black Jack. Terry Hollis. Give him your hand agin and say
  you're glad to have him for his dad's sake and for his own! Kate, he's done a
  man's job already. It's him that dropped old foxy Minter!"</p>

  <p>The last of these words faded out of the hearing of Terry. He felt the
  lowered eyes of the girl rise and fall gravely on his face, and her glance
  rested there a long moment with a new and solemn questioning. Then her hand
  went slowly out to him, a cold hand that barely touched his with its
  fingertips and then dropped away.</p>

  <p>But what Terry felt was that it was the same glance she had turned to him
  when she stood leaning against the post earlier that evening. There was a
  pity in it, and a sort of despair which he could not understand.</p>

  <p>And without saying a word she turned her back on them and went out of the
  room as slowly as she had come into it.</p>

  <p class="first">"It don't mean nothing," Pollard hastened to assure Terry.
  "It don't mean a thing in the world except that she's a fool girl. The
  queerest, orneriest, kindest, strangest, wildest thing in the shape of calico
  that ever come into these parts since her mother died before her. But the
  more you see of her, the more you'll value her. She can ride like a
  man&mdash;no wear out to her &mdash;and she's got the courage of a man.
  Besides which she can sling a gun like it would do your heart good to see
  her! Don't take nothing she does to heart. She don't mean no harm. But she
  sure does tangle up a gent's ideas. Here I been living with her nigh onto
  twenty years and I don't savvy her none yet. Eh, boys?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not offended in the least," said Terry quietly.</p>

  <p>And he was not, but he was more interested than he had ever been before by
  man, woman, or child. And for the past few seconds his mind had been
  following her through the door behind which she had disappeared.</p>

  <p>"And if I were to see more of her, no doubt&mdash;" He broke off with:
  "But I'm not apt to see much more of any of you, Mr. Pollard. If I can't stay
  here and work off that three-hundred-dollar debt&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Work, hell! No son of Black Jack Hollis can work for me. But he can live
  with me as a partner, son, and he can have everything I got, half and half,
  and the bigger half to him if he asks for it. That's straight!"</p>

  <p>Terry raised a protesting hand. Yet he was touched&mdash;intimately
  touched. He had tried hard to fit in his place among the honest people of the
  mountains by hard and patient work. They would have none of him. His own kind
  turned him out. And among these men&mdash;men who had no law, as he had every
  reason to believe&mdash;he was instantly taken in and made one of them.</p>

  <p>"But no more talk tonight," said Pollard. "I can see you're played out.
  I'll show you the room."</p>

  <p>He caught a lantern from the wall as he spoke and began to lead the way up
  the stairs to the balcony. He pointed out the advantages of the house as he
  spoke.</p>

  <p>"Not half bad&mdash;this house, eh?" he said proudly. "And who d'you think
  planned it? Your old man, kid. It was Black Jack Hollis himself that done it!
  He was took off sudden before he'd had a chance to work it out and build it.
  But I used his ideas in this the same's I've done in other things. His idea
  was a house like a ship.</p>

  <p>"They build a ship in compartments, eh? Ship hits a rock, water comes in.
  But it only fills one compartment, and the old ship still floats. Same with
  this house. You seen them walls. And the walls on the outside ain't the only
  thing. Every partition is the same thing, pretty near; and a gent could stand
  behind these doors safe as if he was a mile away from a gun. Why? Because
  they's a nice little lining of the best steel you ever seen in the middle of
  'em.</p>

  <p>"Cost a lot. Sure. But look at us now. Suppose a posse was to rush the
  house. They bust into the kitchen side. Where are they? Just the same as if
  they hadn't got in at all. I bolt the doors from the inside of the big room,
  and they're shut out agin. Or suppose they take the big room? Then a couple
  of us slide out on this balcony and spray 'em with lead. This house ain't
  going to be took till the last room is filled full of the sheriff's men!"</p>

  <p>He paused on the balcony and looked proudly over the big, baronial room
  below them. It seemed huger than ever from this viewpoint, and the men below
  them were dwarfed. The light of the lanterns did not extend all the way
  across it, but fell in pools here and there, gleaming faintly on the men
  below.</p>

  <p>"But doesn't it make people suspicious to have a fort like this built on
  the hill?" asked Terry.</p>

  <p>"Of course. If they knew. But they don't know, son, and they ain't going
  to find out the lining of this house till they try it out with lead."</p>

  <p>He brought Terry into one of the bedrooms and lighted a lamp. As the flare
  steadied in the big circular oil burner and the light spread, Terry made out
  a surprisingly comfortable apartment. There was not a bunk, but a civilized
  bed, beside which was a huge, tawny mountain-lion skin softening the floor.
  The window was curtained in some pleasant blue stuff, and there were a few
  spots of color on the wall&mdash;only calendars, some of them, but helping to
  give a livable impression for the place.</p>

  <p>"Kate's work," grinned Pollard proudly. "She's been fixing these rooms up
  all out of her own head. Never got no ideas out of me. Anything you might
  lack, son?"</p>

  <p>Terry told him he would be very comfortable, and the big man wrung his
  hand again as he bade him good night.</p>

  <p>"The best work that Denver ever done was bringing you to me," he declared.
  "Which you'll find it out before I'm through. I'm going to give you a home!"
  And he strode away before Terry could answer.</p>

  <p>The rather rare consciousness of having done a good deed swelled in the
  heart of Joe Pollard on his way down from the balcony. When he reached the
  floor below, he found that the four men had gone to bed and left Denver
  alone, drawn back from the light into a shadowy corner, where he was flanked
  by the gleam of a bottle of whisky on the one side and a shimmering glass on
  the other. Although Pollard was the nominal leader, he was in secret awe of
  the yegg. For Denver was an "in-and-outer." Sometimes he joined them in the
  West; sometimes he "worked" an Eastern territory. He came and went as he
  pleased, and was more or less a law to himself. Moreover, he had certain
  qualities of silence and brooding that usually disturbed the leader. They
  troubled him now as he approached the squat, shapeless figure in the corner
  chair.</p>

  <p>"What you think of him?" said Denver.</p>

  <p>"A good kid and a clean-cut kid," decided Joe Pollard judicially. "Maybe
  he ain't another Black Jack, but he's tolerable cool for a youngster. Stood
  up and looked me in the eye like a man when I had him cornered a while back.
  Good thing for him you come out when you did!"</p>

  <p>"A good thing for you, Joe," replied Denver Pete. "He'd of turned you into
  fertilizer, bo!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe; maybe not. Maybe they's some things I could teach him about gun-
  slinging, Pete."</p>

  <p>"Maybe; maybe not," parodied Denver. "You've learned a good deal about
  guns, Joe&mdash;quite a bit. But there's some things about gun fighting that
  nobody can learn. It's got to be born into 'em. Remember how Black Jack used
  to slide out his gat?"</p>

  <p>"Yep. There was a man!"</p>

  <p>"And Minter, too. There's a born gunman."</p>

  <p>"Sure. We all know Uncle Joe&mdash;damn his soul!"</p>

  <p>"But the kid beat Uncle Joe fair and square from an even break&mdash; and
  beat him bad. Made his draw, held it so's Joe could partway catch up with
  him, and then drilled him clean!"</p>

  <p>Pollard scratched his chin.</p>

  <p>"I'd believe that if I seen it," he declared.</p>

  <p>"Pal, it wasn't Terry that done the talking; it was Gainor. He's seen a
  good deal of gunplay, and said that Terry's was the coolest he ever
  watched."</p>

  <p>"All right for that part of it," said Joe Pollard. "Suppose he's fast
  &mdash;but can I use him? I like him well enough; I'll give him a good deal;
  but is he going to mean charity all the time he hangs out with me?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe; maybe not," chuckled Denver again. "Use him the way he can be
  used, and he'll be the best bargain you ever turned. Black Jack started you
  in business; Black Jack the Second will make you rich if you handle him right
  &mdash;and ruin you if you make a slip."</p>

  <p>"How come? He talks this 'honesty' talk pretty strong."</p>

  <p>"Gimme a chance to talk," said Denver contemptuously. "Takes a gent that's
  used to reading the secrets of a safe to read the secrets of a gent's head.
  And I've read the secret of young Black Jack Hollis. He's a pile of dry
  powder, Joe. Throw in the spark and he'll explode so damned loud they'll hear
  him go off all over the country."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"First, you got to keep him here."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>Joe Pollard sat back with the air of one who will be convinced through no
  mental effort of his own. But Denver was equal to the demand.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to show you. He thinks he owes you three hundred."</p>

  <p>"That's foolish. I cheated the kid out of it. I'll give it back to him and
  all the rest I won."</p>

  <p>Denver paused and studied the other as one amazed by such stupidity.</p>

  <p>"Pal, did you ever try, in the old days, to <i>give</i> anything to the
  old Black Jack?"</p>

  <p>"H'm. Well, he sure hated charity. But this ain't charity."</p>

  <p>"It ain't in your eyes. It is in Terry's. If you insist, he'll get sore.
  No, Joe. Let him think he owes you that money. Let him start in working it
  off for you&mdash;honest work. You ain't got any ranch work. Well, set him to
  cutting down trees, or anything. That'll help to hold him. If he makes some
  gambling play&mdash;and he's got the born gambler in him&mdash;you got one
  last thing that'll be apt to keep him here."</p>

  <p>"What's that?"</p>

  <p>"Kate."</p>

  <p>Pollard stirred in his chair.</p>

  <p>"How d'you mean that?" he asked gruffly.</p>

  <p>"I mean what I said," retorted Denver. "I watched young Black Jack looking
  at her. He had his heart in his eyes, the kid did. He likes her, in spite of
  the frosty mitt she handed him. Oh, he's falling for her, pal&mdash; and
  he'll keep on falling. Just slip the word to Kate to kid him along. Will you?
  And after we got him glued to the place here, we'll figure out the way to
  turn Terry into a copy of his dad. We'll figure out how to shoot the spark
  into the powder, and then stand clear for the explosion."</p>

  <p>Denver came silently and swiftly out of the chair, his pudgy hand spread
  on the table and his eyes gleaming close to the face of Pollard.</p>

  <p>"Joe," he said softly, "if that kid goes wrong, he'll be as much as his
  father ever was&mdash;and maybe more. He'll rake in the money like it was
  dirt. How do I know? Because I've talked to him. I've watched him and trailed
  him. He's trying hard to go straight. He's failed twice; the third time he'll
  bust and throw in with us. And if he does, he'll clean up the coin&mdash;and
  we'll get our share. Why ain't you made more money yourself, Joe? You got as
  many men as Black Jack ever had. It's because you ain't got the fire in you.
  Neither have I. We're nothing but tools ready for another man to use the way
  Black Jack used us. Nurse this kid along a little while, and he'll show us
  how to pry open the places where the real coin is cached away. And he'll lead
  us in and out with no danger to us and all the real risk on his own head.
  That's his way&mdash;that was his dad's way before him."</p>

  <p>Pollard nodded slowly. "Maybe you're right."</p>

  <p>"I know I am. He's a gold mine, this kid is. But we got to buy him with
  something more than gold. And I know what that something is. I'm going to
  show him that the good, lawabiding citizens have made up their minds that
  he's no good; that they're all ag'in' him; and when he finds that out, he'll
  go wild. They ain't no doubt of it. He'll show his teeth! And when he shows
  his teeth, he'll taste blood&mdash;they ain't no doubt of it."</p>

  <p>"Going to make him&mdash;kill?" asked Pollard very softly.</p>

  <p>"Why not? He'll do it sooner or later anyway. It's in his blood."</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is."</p>

  <p>"I got an idea. There's a young gent in town named Larrimer, ain't
  there?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. A rough kid, too. It was him that killed Kennedy last spring."</p>

  <p>"And he's proud of his reputation?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. He'd go a hundred miles to have a fight with a gent with a good
  name for gunplay."</p>

  <p>"Then hark to me sing, Joe! Send Terry into town to get something for you.
  I'll drop in ahead of him and find Larrimer, and tell Larrimer that Black
  Jack's son is around&mdash;the man that dropped Sheriff Minter. Then I'll
  bring 'em together and give 'em a running start."</p>

  <p>"And risk Terry getting his head blown off?"</p>

  <p>"If he can't beat Larrimer, he's no use to us; if he kills Larrimer, it's
  good riddance. The kid is going to get bumped off sometime, anyway. He's bad
  &mdash;all the way through."</p>

  <p>Pollard looked with a sort of wonder on his companion.</p>

  <p>"You're a nice, kind sort of a gent, ain't you, Denver?"</p>

  <p>"I'm a moneymaker," asserted Denver coldly. "And, just now, Terry Hollis
  is my gold mine. Watch me work him!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap27"
     name="chap27">CHAPTER 27</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was some time before Terry could sleep, though it was now
  very late. When he put out the light and slipped into the bed, the darkness
  brought a bright flood of memories of the day before him. It seemed to him
  that half a lifetime had been crowded into the brief hours since he was fired
  on the ranch that morning. Behind everything stirred the ugly face of Denver
  as a sort of controlling nemesis. It seemed to him that the chunky little man
  had been pulling the wires all the time while he, Terry Hollis, danced in
  response. Not a flattering thought.</p>

  <p>Nervously, Terry got out of bed and went to the window. The night was
  cool, but crisp rather than chilling. His eye went over the velvet blackness
  of the mountain slope above him to the ragged line of the crest&mdash;then a
  dizzy plunge to the brightness of the stars beyond. The very sense of
  distance was soothing; it washed the gloom and the troubles away from him. He
  breathed deep of the fragrance of the pines and then went back to his
  bed.</p>

  <p>He had hardly taken his place in it when the sleep began to well up over
  his brain&mdash;waves of shadows running out of corners of his mind. And then
  suddenly he was wide awake, alert.</p>

  <p>Someone had opened the door. There had been no sound; merely a change in
  the air currents of the room, but there was also the sense of another
  presence so clearly that Terry almost imagined he could hear the
  breathing.</p>

  <p>He was beginning to shrug the thought away and smile at his own
  nervousness, when he heard that unmistakable sound of a foot pressing the
  floor. And then he remembered that he had left his gun belt far from the bed.
  In a burning moment that lesson was printed in his mind, and would never be
  forgotten. Slowly as possible and without sound, he drew up his feet little
  by little, spread his arms gently on either side of him, and made himself
  tense for the effort. Whoever it was that entered, they might be taken by
  surprise. He dared not lift his head to look; and he was on the verge of
  leaping up and at the approaching noise, when a whisper came to him softly:
  "Black Jack!"</p>

  <p>The soft voice, the name itself, thrilled him. He sat erect in the bed and
  made out, dimly, the form of Kate Pollard in the blackness. She would have
  been quite invisible, save that the square of the window was almost exactly
  behind her. He made out the faint whiteness of the hand which held her
  dressing robe at the breast.</p>

  <p>She did not start back, though she showed that she was startled by the
  suddenness of his movement by growing the faintest shade taller and lifting
  her head a little. Terry watched her, bewildered.</p>

  <p>"I been waiting to see you," said Kate. "I want to&mdash;I mean&mdash;
  to&mdash;talk to you."</p>

  <p>He could think of nothing except to blurt with sublime stupidity: "It's
  good of you. Won't you sit down?"</p>

  <p>The girl brought him to his senses with a sharp "Easy! Don't talk out. Do
  you know what'd happen if Dad found me here?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;" began Terry.</p>

  <p>But she helped him smoothly to the logical conclusion. "He'd blow your
  head off, Black Jack; and he'd do it&mdash;pronto. If you are going to talk,
  talk soft&mdash;like me."</p>

  <p>She sat down on the side of the bed so gently that there was no creaking.
  They peered at each other through the darkness for a time.</p>

  <p>She was not whispering, but her voice was pitched almost as low, and he
  wondered at the variety of expression she was able to pack in the small range
  of that murmur. "I suppose I'm a fool for coming. But I was born to love
  chances. Born for it!" She lifted her head and laughed.</p>

  <p>It amazed Terry to hear the shaken flow of her breath and catch the
  glinting outline of her face. He found himself leaning forward a little; and
  he began to wish for a light, though perhaps it was an unconscious wish.</p>

  <p>"First," she said, "what d'you know about Dad&mdash;and Denver Pete?"</p>

  <p>"Practically nothing."</p>

  <p>She was silent for a moment, and he saw her hand go up and prop her chin
  while she considered what she could say next.</p>

  <p>"They's so much to tell," she confessed, "that I can't put it short. I'll
  tell you this much, Black Jack&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That isn't my name, if you please."</p>

  <p>"It'll be your name if you stay around these parts with Dad very long,"
  she replied, with an odd emphasis. "But where you been raised, Terry? And
  what you been doing with yourself?"</p>

  <p>He felt that this giving of the first name was a tribute, in some subtle
  manner. It enabled him, for instance, to call her Kate, and he decided with a
  thrill that he would do so at the first opportunity. He reverted to her
  question.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," he admitted gloomily, "that I've been raised to do pretty
  much as I please&mdash;and the money I've spent has been given to me."</p>

  <p>The girl shook her head with conviction.</p>

  <p>"It ain't possible," she declared.</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"No son of Black Jack would live off somebody's charity."</p>

  <p>He felt the blood tingle in his cheeks, and a real anger against her rose.
  Yet he found himself explaining humbly.</p>

  <p>"You see, I was taken when I wasn't old enough to decide for myself. I was
  only a baby. And I was raised to depend upon Elizabeth Cornish. I&mdash;I
  didn't even know the name of my father until a few days ago."</p>

  <p>The girl gasped. "You didn't know your father&mdash;not your own father?"
  She laughed again scornfully. "Terry, I ain't green enough to believe
  that!"</p>

  <p>He fell into a dignified silence, and presently the girl leaned closer, as
  though she were peering to make out his face. Indeed, it was now possible to
  dimly make out objects in the room. The window was filled with an increasing
  brightness, and presently a shaft of pale light began to slide across the
  floor, little by little. The moon had pushed up above the crest of the
  mountain.</p>

  <p>"Did that make you mad?" queried the girl. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"You seemed to doubt what I said," he remarked stiffly.</p>

  <p>"Why not? You ain't under oath, or anything, are you?"</p>

  <p>Then she laughed again. "You're a queer one all the way through. This
  Elizabeth Cornish&mdash;got anything to do with the Cornish ranch?"</p>

  <p>"I presume she owns it, very largely."</p>

  <p>The girl nodded. "You talk like a book. You must of studied a terrible
  pile."</p>

  <p>"Not so much, really."</p>

  <p>"H'm," said the girl, and seemed to reserve judgment.</p>

  <p>Then she asked with a return of her former sharpness: "How come you
  gambled today at Pedro's?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. It seemed the thing to do&mdash;to kill time, you
  know."</p>

  <p>"Kill time! At Pedro's? Well&mdash;you <i>are</i> green, Terry!"</p>

  <p>"I suppose I am, Kate."</p>

  <p>He made a little pause before her name, and when he spoke it, in spite of
  himself, his voice changed, became softer. The girl straightened somewhat,
  and the light was now increased to such a point that he could make out that
  she was frowning at him through the dimness.</p>

  <p>"First, you been adopted, then you been raised on a great big place with
  everything you want, mostly, and now you're out&mdash;playing at Pedro's. How
  come, Terry?"</p>

  <p>"I was sent away," said Terry faintly, as all the pain of that farewell
  came flooding back over him.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"I shot a man."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Kate. "You shot a man?" It seemed to silence her. "Why,
  Terry?"</p>

  <p>"He had killed my father," he explained, more softly than ever.</p>

  <p>"I know. It was Minter. And they turned you out for that?"</p>

  <p>There was a trembling intake of her breath. He could catch the sparkle of
  her eyes, and knew that she had flown into one of her sudden, fiery passions.
  And it warmed his heart to hear her.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to know what kind of people they are, anyway! I'd like to meet
  up with that Elizabeth Cornish, the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She's the finest woman that ever breathed," said Terry simply.</p>

  <p>"You say that," she pondered slowly, "after she sent you away?"</p>

  <p>"She did only what she thought was right. She's a little hard, but very
  just, Kate."</p>

  <p>She was shaking her head; the hair had become a dull and wonderful gold in
  the faint moonshine.</p>

  <p>"I dunno what kind of a man you are, Terry. I didn't ever know a man could
  stick by&mdash;folks&mdash;after they'd been hurt by 'em. I couldn't do it. I
  ain't got much Bible stuff in me, Terry. Why, when somebody does me a wrong,
  I hate 'em&mdash;I hate 'em! And I never forgive 'em till I get back at 'em."
  She sighed. "But you're different, I guess. I begin to figure that you're
  pretty white, Terry Hollis."</p>

  <p>There was something so direct about her talk that he could not answer. It
  seemed to him that there was in her a cross between a boy and a man&mdash;the
  simplicity of a child and the straightforward strength of a grown man, and
  all this tempered and made strangely delightful by her own unique
  personality.</p>

  <p>"But I guessed it the first time I looked at you," she was murmuring. "I
  guessed that you was different from the rest."</p>

  <p>She had her elbow on her knee now, and, with her chin cupped in the
  graceful hand, she leaned toward him and studied him.</p>

  <p>"When they're clean-cut on the outside, they're spoiled on the inside.
  They're crooks, hard ones, out for themselves, never giving a rap about the
  next gent in line. But mostly they ain't even clean on the outside, and you
  can see what they are the first time you look at 'em.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I've liked some of the boys now and then; but I had to make myself
  like 'em. But you're different. I seen that when you started talking. You
  didn't sulk; and you didn't look proud like you wanted to show us what you
  could do; and you didn't boast none. I kept wondering at you while I was at
  the piano. And&mdash;you made an awful hit with me, Terry."</p>

  <p>Again he was too staggered to reply. And before he could gather his wits,
  the girl went on:</p>

  <p>"Now, is there any real reason why you shouldn't get out of here tomorrow
  morning?"</p>

  <p>It was a blow of quite another sort.</p>

  <p>"But why should I go?"</p>

  <p>She grew very solemn, with a trace of sadness in her voice.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you why, Terry. Because if you stay around here too long,
  they'll make you what you don't want to be&mdash;another Black Jack. Don't
  you see that that's why they like you? Because you're his son, and because
  they want you to be another like him. Not that I have anything against him. I
  guess he was a fine fellow in his way." She paused and stared directly at him
  in a way he found hard to bear. "He must of been! But that isn't the sort of
  a man you want to make out of yourself. I know. You're trying to go straight.
  Well, Terry, nobody that ever stepped could stay straight long when they had
  around 'em Denver Pete and&mdash;my father." She said the last with a sob of
  grief. He tried to protest, but she waved him away.</p>

  <p>"I know. And it's true. He'd do anything for me, except change himself.
  Believe me, Terry, you got to get out of here&mdash;pronto. Is they anything
  to hold you here?"</p>

  <p>"A great deal. Three hundred dollars I owe your father."</p>

  <p>She considered him again with that mute shake of the head. Then: "Do you
  mean it? I see you do. I don't suppose it does any good for me to tell you
  that he cheated you out of that money?"</p>

  <p>"If I was fool enough to lose it that way, I won't take it back."</p>

  <p>"I knew that, too&mdash;I guessed it. Oh, Terry, I know a pile more about
  the inside of your head than you'd ever guess! Well, I knew that&mdash; and I
  come with the money so's you can pay back Dad in the morning. Here it is
  &mdash;and they's just a mite more to help you on your way."</p>

  <p>She laid the little handful of gold on the table beside the bed and
  rose.</p>

  <p>"Don't go," said Terry, when he could speak. "Don't go, Kate! I'm not that
  low. I can't take your money!"</p>

  <p>She stood by the bed and stamped lightly. "Are you going to be a fool
  about this, too?"</p>

  <p>"Your father offered to give me back all the money I'd won. I can't do it,
  Kate."</p>

  <p>He could see her grow angry, beautifully angry.</p>

  <p>"Is they no difference between Kate Pollard and Joe Pollard?"</p>

  <p>Something leaped into his throat. He wanted to tell her in a thousand ways
  just how vast that difference was.</p>

  <p>"Man, you'd make a saint swear, and I ain't a saint by some miles. You
  take that money and pay Dad, and get on your way. This ain't no place for
  you, Terry Hollis."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>She broke in: "Don't say it. You'll have me mad in a minute. Don't say
  it."</p>

  <p>"I have to. I can't take money from you."</p>

  <p>"Then take a loan."</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Ain't I good enough to even loan you money?" she cried fiercely.</p>

  <p>The shaft of moonlight had poured past her feet; she stood in a pool of
  it.</p>

  <p>"Good enough?" said Terry. "Good enough?" Something that had been
  accumulating in him now swelled to bursting, flooded from his heart to his
  throat. He hardly knew his own voice, it was so transformed with sudden
  emotion.</p>

  <p>"There's more good in you than in any man or woman I've ever known."</p>

  <p>"Terry, are you trying to make me feel foolish?"</p>

  <p>"I mean it&mdash;and it's true. You're kinder, more gentle&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Gentle? Me? Oh, Terry!"</p>

  <p>But she sat down on the bed, and she listened to him with her face raised,
  as though music were falling on her, a thing barely heard at a perilous
  distance.</p>

  <p>"They've told you other things, but they don't know. I know, Kate. The
  moment I saw you I knew, and it stopped my heart for a beat&mdash;the knowing
  of it. That you're beautiful&mdash;and true as steel; that you're worthy of
  honor&mdash;and that I honor you with all my heart. That I love your
  kindness, your frankness, your beautiful willingness to help people, Kate.
  I've lived with a woman who taught me what was true. You've taught me what's
  glorious and worth living for. Do you understand, Kate?"</p>

  <p>And no answer; but a change in her face that stopped him.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't of come," she whispered at length, "and I&mdash;I shouldn't
  have let you&mdash;talk the way you've done. But, oh, Terry&mdash; when you
  come to forget what you've said&mdash;don't forget it all the way &mdash;keep
  some of the things&mdash;tucked away in you&mdash;somewhere &mdash;"</p>

  <p>She rose from the bed and slipped across the white brilliance of the shaft
  of moonlight. It made a red-gold fire of her hair. Then she flickered into
  the shadow. Then she was swallowed by the darkness.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap28"
     name="chap28">CHAPTER 28</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There was no Kate at breakfast the next morning. She had
  left the house at dawn with her horse.</p>

  <p>"May be night before she comes back," said her father. "No telling how far
  she'll go. May be tomorrow before she shows up."</p>

  <p>It made Terry thoughtful for reasons which he himself did not understand.
  He had a peculiar desire to climb into the saddle on El Sangre and trail her
  across the hills. But he was very quickly brought to the reality that if he
  chose to make himself a laboring man and work out the three hundred dollars
  he would not take back from Joe Pollard, the big man was now disposed to make
  him live up to his word.</p>

  <p>He was sent out with an ax and ordered to attack a stout grove of the
  pines for firewood. But he quickly resigned himself to the work. Whatever
  gloom he felt disappeared with the first stroke that sunk the edge deep into
  the soft wood. The next stroke broke out a great chip, and a resinous, fresh
  smell came up to him.</p>

  <p>He made quick work of the first tree, working the morning chill out of his
  body, and as he warmed to his labor, the long muscles of arms and shoulders
  limbering, the blows fell in a shower. The sturdy pines fell one by one, and
  he stripped them of branches with long, sweeping blows of the ax, shearing
  off several at a stroke. He was not an expert axman, but he knew enough about
  that cunning craft to make his blows tell, and a continual desire to sing
  welled up in him.</p>

  <p>Once, to breathe after the heavy labor, he stepped to the edge of the
  little grove. The sun was sparkling in the tops of the trees; the valley
  dropped far away below him. He felt as one who stands on the top of the
  world. There was flash and gleam of red; there stood El Sangre in the corral
  below him; the stallion raised his head and whinnied in reply to the master's
  whistle.</p>

  <p>A great, sweet peace dropped on the heart of Terry Hollis. Now he felt he
  was at home. He went back to his work.</p>

  <p>But in the midmorning Joe Pollard came to him and grunted at the swath
  Terry had driven into the heart of the lodgepole pines.</p>

  <p>"I wanted junk for the fire," he protested; "not enough to build a house.
  But I got a little errand for you in town, Terry. You can give El Sangre a
  stretching down the road?"</p>

  <p>"Of course."</p>

  <p>It gave Terry a little prickling feeling of resentment to be ordered
  about. But he swallowed the resentment. After all, this was labor of his own
  choosing, though he could not but wonder a little, because Joe Pollard no
  longer pressed him to take back the money he had lost. And he reverted to the
  talk of Kate the night before. That three hundred dollars was now an anchor
  holding him to the service of her father. And he remembered, with a touch of
  dismay, that it might take a year of ordinary wages to save three hundred
  dollars. Or more than a year.</p>

  <p>It was impossible to be downhearted long, however. The morning was as
  fresh as a rose, and the four men came out of the house with Pollard to see
  El Sangre dancing under the saddle. Terry received the commission for a box
  of shotgun cartridges and the money to pay for them.</p>

  <p>"And the change," said Pollard liberally, "don't worry me none. Step
  around and make yourself to home in town. About coming back&mdash;well, when
  I send a man into town, I figure on him making a day of it. S'long,
  Terry!"</p>

  <p>"Hey," called Slim, "is El Sangre gun-shy?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so."</p>

  <p>The stallion quivered with eagerness to be off.</p>

  <p>"Here's to try him."</p>

  <p>The gun flashed into Slim's hand and boomed. El Sangre bolted straight
  into the air and landed on legs of jack-rabbit qualities that flung him
  sidewise. The hand and voice of Terry quieted him, while the others stood
  around grinning with delight at the fun and at the beautiful
  horsemanship.</p>

  <p>"But what'll he do if you pull a gun yourself?" asked Joe Pollard, showing
  a sudden concern.</p>

  <p>"He'll stand for it&mdash;long enough," said Terry. "Try him!"</p>

  <p>There was a devil in Slim that morning. He snatched up a shining bit of
  quartz and hurled it&mdash;straight at El Sangre! There was no warning
  &mdash;just a jerk of the arm and the stone came flashing.</p>

  <p>"Try your gun&mdash;on that!"</p>

  <p>The words were torn off short. The heavy gun had twitched into the hand of
  Terry, exploded, and the gleaming quartz puffed into a shower of bright
  particles that danced toward the earth. El Sangre flew into a paroxysm of
  educated bucking of the most advanced school. The steady voice of Terry
  Hollis brought him at last to a quivering stop. The rider was stiff in the
  saddle, his mouth a white, straight line.</p>

  <p>He shoved his revolver deliberately back into the holster.</p>

  <p>The four men had drawn together, still muttering with wonder. Luck may
  have had something to do with the success of that snapshot, but it was such a
  feat of marksmanship as would be remembered and talked about.</p>

  <p>"Dugan!" said Terry huskily.</p>

  <p>Slim lunged forward, but he was ill at ease.</p>

  <p>"Well, kid?"</p>

  <p>"It seemed to me," said Terry, "that you threw that stone at El Sangre. I
  hope I'm wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe," growled Slim. He flashed a glance at his companions, not at all
  eager to push this quarrel forward to a conclusion in spite of his known
  prowess. He had been a little irritated by the adulation which had been shown
  to the son of Black Jack the night before. He was still more irritated by the
  display of fine riding. For horsemanship and clever gunplay were the two main
  feathers in the cap of Slim Dugan. He had thrown the stone simply to test the
  qualities of this new member of the gang; the snapshot had stunned him. So he
  glanced at his companions. If they smiled, it meant that they took the matter
  lightly. But they were not smiling; they met his glance with expressions of
  uniform gravity. To torment a nervous horse is something which does not fit
  with the ways of the men of the mountain desert, even at their roughest.
  Besides, there was an edgy irritability about Slim Dugan which had more than
  once won him black looks. They wanted to see him tested now by a foeman who
  seemed worthy of his mettle. And Slim saw that common desire in his
  flickering side glance. He turned a cold eye on Terry.</p>

  <p>"Maybe," he repeated. "But maybe I meant to see what you could do with a
  gun."</p>

  <p>"I thought so," said Terry through his teeth. "Steady, boy!"</p>

  <p>El Sangre became a rock for firmness. There was not a quiver in one of his
  long, racing muscles. It was a fine tribute to the power of the rider.</p>

  <p>"I thought you might be trying out my gun," repeated Terry. "Are you
  entirely satisfied?"</p>

  <p>He leaned a little in the saddle. Slim moistened his lips. It was a hard
  question to answer. The man in the saddle had become a quivering bundle of
  nerves; Slim could see the twitching of the lips, and he knew what it meant.
  Instinctively he fingered one of the broad bright buttons of his shirt. A man
  who could hit a glittering thrown stone would undoubtedly be able to hit that
  stationary button. The thought had elements in it that were decidedly
  unpleasant. But he had gone too far. He dared not recede now if he wished to
  hold up his head again among his fellows&mdash;and fear of death had never
  yet controlled the actions of Slim Dugan.</p>

  <p>"I dunno," he remarked carelessly. "I'm a sort of curious gent. It takes
  more than one lucky shot to make me see the light."</p>

  <p>The lips of Terry worked a moment. The companions of Slim Dugan scattered
  of one accord to either side. There was no doubting the gravity of the crisis
  which had so suddenly sprung up. As for Joe Pollard, he stood in the doorway
  in the direct line projected from Terry to Slim and beyond. There was very
  little sentiment in the body of Joe Pollard. Slim had always been a
  disturbing factor in the gang. Why not? He bit his lips thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Dugan," said Terry at length, "curiosity is a very fine quality, and I
  admire a man who has it. Greatly. Now, you may notice that my gun is in the
  holster again. Suppose you try me again and see how fast I can get it out of
  the leather&mdash;and hit a target."</p>

  <p>The challenge was entirely direct. There was a perceptible tightening in
  the muscles of the men. They were nerving themselves to hear the crack of a
  gun at any instant. Slim Dugan, gathering his nerve power, fenced for a
  moment more of time. His narrowing eyes were centering on one spot on Terry's
  body&mdash; the spot at which he would attempt to drive his bullet, and he
  chose the pocket of Terry's shirt. It steadied him, gave him his old
  self-confidence to have found that target. His hand and his brain grew
  steady, and the thrill of the fighter's love of battle entered him.</p>

  <p>"What sort of a target d'you want?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I'm not particular," said Hollis. "Anything will do for me&mdash;even a
  button!"</p>

  <p>It jarred home to Slim&mdash;the very thought he had had a moment before.
  He felt his certainty waver, slip from him. Then the voice of Pollard boomed
  out at them:</p>

  <p>"Keep them guns in their houses! You hear me talk? The first man that
  makes a move I'm going to drill! Slim, get back into the house. Terry, you
  damn meateater, git on down that hill!"</p>

  <p>Terry did not move, but Slim Dugan stirred uneasily, turned, and said:
  "It's up to you, chief. But I'll see this through sooner or later!"</p>

  <p>And not until then did Terry turn his horse and go down the hill without a
  backward look.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap29"
     name="chap29">CHAPTER 29</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There had been a profound reason behind the sudden turning
  of Terry Hollis's horse and his riding down the hill. For as he sat the
  saddle, quivering, he felt rising in him an all-controlling impulse that was
  new to him, a fierce and sudden passion.</p>

  <p>It was joyous, free, terrible in its force&mdash;that wish to slay. The
  emotion had grown, held back by the very force of a mental thread of reason,
  until, at the very moment when the thread was about to fray and snap, and he
  would be flung into sudden action, the booming voice of Joe Pollard had
  cleared his mind as an acid clears a cloudy precipitate. He saw himself for
  the first time in several moments, and what he saw made him shudder.</p>

  <p>And still in fear of himself he swung El Sangre and put him down the slope
  recklessly. Never in his life had he ridden as he rode in those first five
  minutes down the pitch of the hill. He gave El Sangre his head to pick his
  own way, and he confined his efforts to urging the great stallion along. The
  blood-bay went like the wind, passing up-jutting boulders with a swish of
  gravel knocked from his plunging hoofs against the rock.</p>

  <p>Even in Terry's passion of self-dread he dimly appreciated the prowess of
  the horse, and when they shot onto the level going of the valley road, he
  called El Sangre out of the mad gallop and back to the natural pace, a gait
  as swinging and smooth as running water&mdash;yet still the road poured
  beneath them at the speed of an ordinary gallop. It was music to Terry
  Hollis, that matchless gait. He leaned and murmured to the pricking ears with
  that soft, gentle voice which horses love. The glorious head of El Sangre
  went up a little, his tail flaunted somewhat more proudly; from the quiver of
  his nostrils to the ringing beat of his black hoofs he bespoke his confidence
  that he bore the king of men on his back.</p>

  <p>And the pride of the great horse brought back some of Terry's own waning
  self-confidence. His father had been up in him as he faced Slim Dugan, he
  knew. Once more he had escaped from the commission of a crime. But for how
  long would he succeed in dodging that imp of the perverse which haunted
  him?</p>

  <p>It was like the temptation of a drug&mdash;to strike just once, and
  thereafter to be raised above himself, take to himself the power of evil
  which is greater than the power of good. The blow he struck at the sheriff
  had merely served to launch him on his way. To strike down was not now what
  he wanted, but to kill! To feel that once he had accomplished the destiny of
  some strong man, to turn a creature of mind and soul, ambition and hope, at a
  single stroke into so many pounds of flesh, useless, done for. What could be
  more glorious? What could be more terrible? And the desire to strike, as he
  had looked into the sneering face of Slim Dugan, had been almost
  overmastering.</p>

  <p>Sooner or later he would strike that blow. Sooner or later he would commit
  the great and controlling crime. And the rest of his life would be a
  continual evasion of the law.</p>

  <p>If they would only take him into their midst, the good and the law-
  abiding men of the mountains! If they would only accept him by word or deed
  and give him a chance to prove that he was honest! Even then the battle would
  be hard, against temptation; but they were too smugly sure that his downfall
  was certain. Twice they had rejected him without cause. How long would it be
  before they actually raised their hands against him? How long would it be
  before they violently put him in the class of his father?</p>

  <p>Grinding his teeth, he swore that if that time ever came when they took
  his destiny into their own hands, he would make it a day to be marked in red
  all through the mountains!</p>

  <p>The cool, fresh wind against his face blew the sullen anger away. And when
  he came close to the town, he was his old self.</p>

  <p>A man on a tall gray, with the legs of speed and plenty of girth at the
  cinches, where girth means lung power, twisted out of a side trail and swung
  past El Sangre at a fast gallop. The blood-bay snorted and came hard against
  the bit in a desire to follow. On the range, when he led his wild band, no
  horse had ever passed El Sangre and hardly the voice of the master could keep
  him back now. Terry loosed him. He did not break into a gallop, but fled down
  the road like an arrow, and the gray came back to him slowly and surely until
  the rider twisted around and swore in surprise.</p>

  <p>He touched his mount with the spurs; there was a fresh start from the
  gray, a lunge that kicked a little spurt of dust into the nostrils of El
  Sangre. He snorted it out. Terry released his head completely, and now, as
  though in scorn refusing to break into his sweeping gallop, El Sangre flung
  himself ahead to the full of his natural pace.</p>

  <p>And the gray came back steadily. The town was shoving up at them at the
  end of the road more and more clearly. The rider of the gray began to curse.
  He was leaning forward, jockeying his horse, but still El Sangre hurled
  himself forward powerfully, smoothly. They passed the first shanty on the
  outskirts of the town with the red head of the stallion at the hip of the
  other. Before they straightened into the main street, El Sangre had shoved
  his nose past the outstretched head of the gray. Then the other rider jerked
  back on his reins with a resounding oath. Terry imitated; one call to El
  Sangre brought him back to a gentle amble.</p>

  <p>"Going to sell this damned skate," declared the stranger, a lean-faced man
  of middle age with big, patient, kindly eyes. "If he can't make another hoss
  break out of a pace, he ain't worth keeping! But I'll tell a man that you got
  quite a hoss there, partner!"</p>

  <p>"Not bad," admitted Terry modestly. "And the gray has pretty good points,
  it seems to me."</p>

  <p>They drew the horses back to a walk.</p>

  <p>"Ought to have. Been breeding for him fifteen years&mdash;and here I get
  him beat by a hoss that don't break out of a pace."</p>

  <p>He swore again, but less violently and with less disappointment. He was
  beginning to run his eyes appreciatively over the superb lines of El Sangre.
  There were horses and horses, and he began to see that this was one in a
  thousand&mdash;or more.</p>

  <p>"What's the strain in that stallion?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Mustang," answered Terry.</p>

  <p>"Mustang? Man, man, he's close to sixteen hands!"</p>

  <p>"Nearer fifteen three. Yes, he stands pretty high. Might call him a freak
  mustang, I guess. He reverts to the old source stock."</p>

  <p>"I've heard something about that," nodded the other. "Once in a generation
  they say a mustang turns up somewhere on the range that breeds back to the
  old Arab. And that red hoss is sure one of 'em."</p>

  <p>They dismounted at the hotel, the common hitching rack for the town, and
  the elder man held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"I'm Jack Baldwin."</p>

  <p>"Terry'll do for me, Mr. Baldwin. Glad to know you."</p>

  <p>Baldwin considered his companion with a slight narrowing of the eyes.
  Distinctly this "Terry" was not the type to be wandering about the country
  known by his first name alone. There were reasons and reasons why men chose
  to conceal their family names in the mountains, however, and not all of them
  were bad. He decided to reserve judgment. Particularly since he noted a touch
  of similarity between the high head and the glorious lines of El Sangre and
  the young pride and strength of Terry himself. There was something
  reassuringly clean and frank about both horse and rider, and it pleased
  Baldwin.</p>

  <p>They made their purchases together in the store.</p>

  <p>"Where might you be working?" asked Baldwin.</p>

  <p>"For Joe Pollard."</p>

  <p>"Him?" There was a lifting of the eyebrows of Jack Baldwin. "What
  line?"</p>

  <p>"Cutting wood, just now."</p>

  <p>Baldwin shook his head.</p>

  <p>"How Pollard uses so much help is more'n I can see. He's got a range back
  of the hills, I know, and some cattle on it; but he's sure a waster of good
  labor. Take me, now. I need a hand right bad to help me with the cows."</p>

  <p>"I'm more or less under contract with Pollard," said Terry. He added: "You
  talk as if Pollard might be a queer sort."</p>

  <p>Baldwin seemed to be disarmed by this frankness.</p>

  <p>"Ain't you noticed anything queer up there? No? Well, maybe Pollard is all
  right. He's sort of a newcomer around here. That big house of his ain't
  more'n four or five years old. But most usually a man buys land and cattle
  around here before he builds him a big house. Well&mdash;Pollard is an open-
  handed cuss, I'll say that for him, and maybe they ain't anything in the talk
  that goes around."</p>

  <p>What that talk was Terry attempted to discover, but he could not. Jack
  Baldwin was a cautious gossip.</p>

  <p>Since they had finished buying, the storekeeper perched on the edge of his
  selling counter and began to pass the time of the day. It began with the
  usual preliminaries, invariable in the mountains.</p>

  <p>"What's the news out your way?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing much to talk about. How's things with you and your family?"</p>

  <p>"Fair to middlin' and better. Patty had the croup and we sat up two nights
  firing up the croup kettle. Now he's better, but he still coughs terrible
  bad."</p>

  <p>And so on until all family affairs had been exhausted. This is a
  formality. One must not rush to the heart of his news or he will mortally
  offend the sensitive Westerner.</p>

  <p>This is the approved method. The storekeeper exemplified it, and having
  talked about nothing for ten minutes, quietly remarked that young Larrimer
  was out hunting a scalp, had been drinking most of the morning, and was now
  about the town boasting of what he intended to do.</p>

  <p>"And what's more, he's apt to do it."</p>

  <p>"Larrimer is a no-good young skunk," said Baldwin, with deliberate heat.
  "It's sure a crime when a boy that ain't got enough brains to fill a peanut
  shell can run over men just because he's spent his life learning how to
  handle firearms. He'll meet up with his finish one of these days."</p>

  <p>"Maybe he will, maybe he won't," said the storekeeper, and spat with
  precision and remarkable power through the window beside him. "That's what
  they been saying for the last two years. Dawson come right down here to get
  him; but it was Dawson that was got. And Kennedy was called a good man with a
  gun &mdash;but Larrimer beat him to the draw and filled him plumb full of
  lead."</p>

  <p>"I know," growled Baldwin. "Kept on shooting after Kennedy was down and
  had the gun shot out of his hand and was helpless. And yet they call that
  self- defense."</p>

  <p>"We can't afford to be too particular about shootings," said the
  storekeeper. "Speaking personal, I figure that a shooting now and then lets
  the blood of the youngsters and gives 'em a new start. Kind of like to see
  it."</p>

  <p>"But who's Larrimer after now?"</p>

  <p>"A wild-goose chase, most likely. He says he's heard that the son of old
  Black Jack is around these parts, and that he's going to bury the outlaw's
  son after he's salted him away with lead."</p>

  <p>"Black Jack's son! Is he around town?"</p>

  <p>The tone sent a chill through Terry; it contained a breathless horror from
  which there was no appeal. In the eye of Jack Baldwin, fair-minded man though
  he was, Black Jack's son was judged and condemned as worthless before his
  case had been heard.</p>

  <p>"I dunno," said the storekeeper; "but if Larrimer put one of Black Jack's
  breed under the ground, I'd call him some use to the town."</p>

  <p>Jack Baldwin was agreeing fervently when the storekeeper made a violent
  signal.</p>

  <p>"There's Larrimer now, and he looks all fired up."</p>

  <p>Terry turned and saw a tall fellow standing in the doorway. He had been
  prepared for a youth; he saw before him a hardened man of thirty and more,
  gaunt-faced, bristling with the rough beard of some five or six days' growth,
  a thin, cruel, hawklike face.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap30"
     name="chap30">CHAPTER 30</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A moment later, from the side door which led from the store
  into the main body of the hotel, stepped the chunky form of Denver Pete,
  quick and light of foot as ever. He went straight to the counter and asked
  for matches, and as the storekeeper, still keeping half an eye upon the
  formidable figure of Larrimer, turned for the matches, Denver spoke softly
  from the side of his mouth to Terry &mdash;only in the lockstep line of the
  prison do they learn to talk in this manner&mdash;gauging the carrying power
  of the whisper with nice accuracy.</p>

  <p>"That bird's after you. Crazy with booze in the head, but steady in the
  hand. One of two things. Clear out right now, or else say the word and I'll
  stay and help you get rid of him."</p>

  <p>For the first time in his life fear swept over Terry&mdash;fear of himself
  compared with which the qualm he had felt after turning from Slim Dugan that
  morning had been nothing. For the second time in one day he was being
  tempted, and the certainty came to him that he would kill Larrimer. And what
  made that certainty more sure was the appearance of his nemesis, Denver Pete,
  in this crisis. As though, with sure scent for evil, Denver had come to be
  present and watch the launching of Terry into a career of crime. But it was
  not the public that Terry feared. It was himself. His moral determination was
  a dam which blocked fierce currents in him that were struggling to get free.
  And a bullet fired at Larrimer would be the thing that burst the dam and let
  the flood waters of self-will free. Thereafter what stood in his path would
  be crushed and swept aside.</p>

  <p>He said to Denver: "This is my affair, not yours. Stand away, Denver. And
  pray for me."</p>

  <p>A strange request. It shattered even the indomitable self-control of
  Denver and left him gaping.</p>

  <p>Larrimer, having completed his survey of the dim interior of the store,
  stalked down upon them. He saw Terry for the first time, paused, and his
  bloodshot little eyes ran up and down the body of the stranger. He turned to
  the storekeeper, but still half of his attention was fixed upon Terry.</p>

  <p>"Bill," he said, "you seen anything of a spavined, long-horned, no-good
  skunk named Hollis around town today?"</p>

  <p>And Terry could see him wait, quivering, half in hopes that the stranger
  would show some anger at this denunciation.</p>

  <p>"Ain't seen nobody by that name," said Bill mildly. "Maybe you're chasing
  a wild goose? Who told you they was a gent named Hollis around?"</p>

  <p>"Black Jack's son," insisted Larrimer. "Wild-goose chase, hell! I was told
  he was around by a gent named&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"These ain't the kind of matches I want!" cried Denver Pete, with a
  strangely loud-voiced wrath. "I don't want painted wood. How can a gent
  whittle one of these damned matches down to toothpick size? Gimme plain wood,
  will you?"</p>

  <p>The storekeeper, wondering, made the exchange. Drunken Larrimer had roved
  on, forgetful of his unfinished sentence. For the very purpose of keeping
  that sentence unfinished, Denver Pete remained on the scene, edging toward
  the outskirts. Now was to come, in a single moment, both the temptation and
  the test of Terry Hollis, and well Denver knew that if Larrimer fell with a
  bullet in his body there would be an end of Terry Hollis in the world and the
  birth of a new soul&mdash;the true son of Black Jack!</p>

  <p>"It's him that plugged Sheriff Minter," went on Larrimer. "I hear tell as
  how he got the sheriff from behind and plugged him. This town ain't a place
  for a man-killing houn' dog like young Black Jack, and I'm here to let him
  know it!"</p>

  <p>The torrent of abuse died out in a crackle of curses. Terry Hollis stood
  as one stunned. Yet his hand stayed free of his gun.</p>

  <p>"Suppose we go on to the hotel and eat?" he asked Jack Baldwin softly. "No
  use staying and letting that fellow deafen us with his oaths, is there?"</p>

  <p>"Better than a circus," declared Baldwin. "Wouldn't miss it. Since old man
  Harkness died, I ain't heard cussing to match up with Larrimer's. Didn't know
  that he had that much brains."</p>

  <p>It seemed that the fates were surely against Terry this day. Yet still he
  determined to dodge the issue. He started toward the door, taking care not to
  walk hastily enough to draw suspicion on him because of his withdrawal, but
  to the heated brain of Larrimer all things were suspicious. His long arm
  darted out as Terry passed him; he jerked the smaller man violently back.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute. I don't know you, kid. Maybe you got the information I
  want?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid not."</p>

  <p>Terry blinked. It seemed to him that if he looked again at that vicious,
  contracted face, his gun would slip into his hand of its own volition.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"A stranger in these parts," said Terry slowly, and he looked down at the
  floor.</p>

  <p>He heard a murmur from the men at the other end of the room. He knew that
  small, buzzing sound. They were wondering at the calmness with which he "took
  water."</p>

  <p>"So's Hollis a stranger in these parts," said Larrimer, facing his victim
  more fully. "What I want to know is about the gent that owns the red hoss in
  front of the store. Ever hear of him?"</p>

  <p>Terry was silent. By a vast effort he was able to shake his head. It was
  hard, bitterly hard, but every good influence that had ever come into his
  life now stood beside him and fought with and for him&mdash;Elizabeth
  Cornish, the long and fictitious line of his Colby ancestors, Kate Pollard
  with her clear- seeing eyes. He saw her last of all. When the men were
  scorning him for the way he had avoided this battle, she, at least, would
  understand, and her understanding would be a mercy.</p>

  <p>"Hollis is somewhere around," declared Larrimer, drawing back and biting
  his lip. "I know it, damn well. His hoss is standing out yonder. I know
  what'll fetch him. I'll shoot that hoss of his, and that'll bring
  him&mdash;if young Black Jack is half the man they say he is! I ain't out to
  shoot cowards&mdash; I want men!"</p>

  <p>He strode to the door.</p>

  <p>"Don't do it!" shouted Bill, the storekeeper.</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" snapped Baldwin. "I know something. Shut up!"</p>

  <p>That fierce, low voice reached the ear of Terry, and he understood that it
  meant Baldwin had judged him as the whole world judged him. After all, what
  difference did it make whether he killed or not? He was already damned as a
  slayer of men by the name of his father before him.</p>

  <p>Larrimer had turned with a roar.</p>

  <p>"What d'you mean by stopping me, Bill? What in hell d'you mean by it?"</p>

  <p>With the brightness of the door behind him, his bearded face was
  wolfish.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," quavered Bill, this torrent of danger pouring about him.
  "Except&mdash;that it ain't very popular around here&mdash;shooting hosses,
  Larrimer."</p>

  <p>"Damn you and your ideas," said Larrimer. "I'm going to go my own way. I
  know what's best."</p>

  <p>He reached the door, his hand went back to the butt of his revolver.</p>

  <p>And then it snapped in Terry, that last restraint which had been at the
  breaking-point all this time. He felt a warmth run through him&mdash;the
  warmth of strength and the cold of a mysterious and evil happiness.</p>

  <p>"Wait, Larrimer!"</p>

  <p>The big man whirled as though he had heard a gun; there was a ring in the
  voice of Terry like the ring down the barrel of a shotgun after it has been
  cocked.</p>

  <p>"You agin?" barked Larrimer.</p>

  <p>"Me again. Larrimer, don't shoot the horse."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"For the sake of your soul, my friend."</p>

  <p>"Boys, ain't this funny? This gent is a sky-pilot, maybe?" He made a long
  stride back.</p>

  <p>"Stop where you are!" cried Terry.</p>

  <p>He stood like a soldier with his heels together, straight, trembling. And
  Larrimer stopped as though a blow had checked him.</p>

  <p>"I may be your sky-pilot, Larrimer. But listen to sense. Do you really
  mean you'd shoot that red horse in front of the hotel?"</p>

  <p>"Ain't you heard me say it?"</p>

  <p>"Then the Lord pity you, Larrimer!"</p>

  <p>Ordinarily Larrimer's gun would have been out long before, but the change
  from this man's humility of the moment before, his almost cringing meekness,
  to his present defiance was so startling that Larrimer was momentarily at
  sea.</p>

  <p>"Damn my eyes," he remarked furiously, "this is funny, this is. Are you
  preaching at me, kid? What d'you mean by that? Eh?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you why. Face me squarely, will you? Your head up, and your
  hands ready."</p>

  <p>In spite of his rage and wonder, Larrimer instinctively obeyed, for the
  words came snapping out like military commands.</p>

  <p>"Now I'll tell you. You manhunting cur, I'm going to send you to hell with
  your sins on your head. I'm going to kill you, Larrimer!"</p>

  <p>It was so unexpected, so totally startling, that Larrimer blinked, raised
  his head, and laughed.</p>

  <p>But the son of Black Jack tore away all thought of laughter.</p>

  <p>"Larrimer, I'm Terry Hollis. Get your gun!"</p>

  <p>The wide mouth of Larrimer writhed silently from mirth to astonishment,
  and then sinister rage. And though he was in the shadow against the door,
  Terry saw the slow gleam in the face of the tall man&mdash;then his hand
  whipped for the gun. It came cleanly out. There was no flap to his holster,
  and the sight had been filed away to give more oiled and perfect freedom to
  the draw. Years of patient practice had taught his muscles to reflex in this
  one motion with a speed that baffled the eye. Fast as light that draw seemed
  to those who watched, and the draw of Terry Hollis appeared to hang in
  midair. His hand wavered, then clutched suddenly, and they saw a flash of
  metal, not the actual motion of drawing the gun. Just that gleam of the
  barrel at his hip, hardly clear of the holster, and then in the dimness of
  the big room a spurt of flame and the boom of the gun.</p>

  <p>There was a clangor of metal at the farthest end of the room. Larrimer's
  gun had rattled on the boards, unfired. He tossed up his great gaunt arms as
  though he were appealing for help, leaped into the air, and fell heavily,
  with a force that vibrated the floor where Terry stood.</p>

  <p>There was one heartbeat of silence.</p>

  <p>Then Terry shoved the gun slowly back into his holster and walked to the
  body of Larrimer.</p>

  <p>To these things Bill, the storekeeper, and Jack Baldwin, the rancher,
  afterward swore. That young Black Jack leaned a little over the corpse and
  then straightened and touched the fallen hand with the toe of his boot. Then
  he turned upon them a perfectly calm, unemotional look.</p>

  <p>"I seem to have been elected to do the scavenger work in this town," he
  said. "But I'm going to leave it to you gentlemen to take the carrion away.
  Shorty, I'm going back to the house. Are you ready to ride that way?"</p>

  <p>When they went to the body of Larrimer afterward, they found a neat,
  circular splotch of purple exactly placed between the eyes.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap31"
     name="chap31">CHAPTER 31</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The first thing the people in Pollard's big house knew of
  the return of the two was a voice singing faintly and far off in the
  stable&mdash;they could hear it because the door to the big living room was
  opened. And Kate Pollard, who had been sitting idly at the piano, stood up
  suddenly and looked around her. It did not interrupt the crap game of the
  four at one side of the room, where they kneeled in a close circle. But it
  brought big Pollard himself to the door in time to meet Denver Pete as the
  latter hurried in.</p>

  <p>When Denver was excited he talked very nearly as softly as he walked. And
  his voice tonight was like a contented humming.</p>

  <p>"It worked," was all he said aside to Pollard as he came through the door.
  They exchanged silent grips of the hands. Then Kate drew down on them; as if
  a mysterious; signal had been passed to them by the subdued entrance of
  Denver, the four rose at the side of the room.</p>

  <p>It was Pollard who forced him to talk.</p>

  <p>"What happened?"</p>

  <p>"A pretty little party," said Denver. His purring voice was so soft that
  to hear him the others instantly drew close. Kate Pollard stood suddenly
  before him.</p>

  <p>"Terry Hollis has done something," she said. "Denver, what has he
  done?"</p>

  <p>"Him? Nothing much. To put it in his own words, he's just played scavenger
  for the town&mdash;and he's done it in a way they won't be forgetting for a
  good long day.</p>

  <p>"Denver!"</p>

  <p>"Well? No need of acting up, Kate."</p>

  <p>"Who was it?"</p>

  <p>"Ever meet young Larrimer?"</p>

  <p>She shuddered. "Yes. A&mdash;beast of a man."</p>

  <p>"Sure. Worse'n a beast, maybe. Well, he's carrion now, to use Terry's
  words again."</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute," cut in big blond Phil Marvin. Don't spoil the story for
  Terry. But did he really do for Larrimer? Larrimer was a neat one with a gun
  &mdash;no good otherwise."</p>

  <p>"Did he do for Larrimer?" echoed Denver in his purring voice. "Oh, man,
  man! Did he do for Larrimer? And I ain't spoiling his story. He won't talk
  about it. Wouldn't open his face about it all the way home. A pretty neat
  play, boys. Larrimer was looking for a rep, and he wanted to make it on Black
  Jack's son. Came tearing in.</p>

  <p>"At first Terry tried to sidestep him. Made me weak inside for a minute
  because I thought he was going to take water. Then he got riled a bit and
  then &mdash;whang! It was all over. Not a body shot. No, boys, nothing clumsy
  and amateurish like that, because a man may live to empty his gun at you
  after he's been shot through the body. This young Hollis, pals, just ups and
  drills Larrimer clean between the eyes. If you'd measured it off with a
  ruler, you couldn't have hit exact center any better'n he done. Then he walks
  up and stirs Larrimer with his toe to make sure he was dead. Cool as
  hell."</p>

  <p>"You lie!" cried the girl suddenly.</p>

  <p>They whirled at her, and found her standing and flaming at them.</p>

  <p>"You hear me say it, Kate," said Denver, losing a little of his calm.</p>

  <p>"He wasn't as cool as that&mdash;after killing a man. He wasn't."</p>

  <p>"All right, honey. Don't you hear him singing out there in the stable?
  Does that sound as if he was cut up much?"</p>

  <p>"Then you've made him a murderer&mdash;you, Denver, and you, Dad. Oh, if
  they's a hell, you're going to travel there for this! Both of you!"</p>

  <p>"As if we had anything to do with it!" exclaimed Denver innocently.
  "Besides, it wasn't murder. It was plain self-defense. Nothing but that.
  Three witnesses to swear to it. But, my, my&mdash;you should hear that town
  rave. They thought nobody could beat Larrimer."</p>

  <p>The girl slipped back into her chair again and sat with her chin in her
  hand, brooding. It was all impossible&mdash;it could not be. Yet there was
  Denver telling his story, and far away the clear baritone of Terry Hollis
  singing as he cared for El Sangre.</p>

  <p>She waited to make sure, waited to see his face and hear him speak close
  at hand. Presently the singing rang out more clearly. He had stepped out of
  the barn.</p>

  <p class="poem">Oh, I am a friar of orders gray,<br>
  Through hill and valley I take my way.<br>
  My long bead roll I merrily chant;<br>
  Wherever I wander no money I want!</p>

  <p>And as the last word rang through the room, Terry Hollis stood in the
  doorway, with his saddle and bridle hanging over one strong arm and his gun
  and gun belt in the other hand. And his voice came cheerily to them in
  greeting. It was impossible&mdash;more impossible than ever.</p>

  <p>He crossed the room, hung up his saddle, and found her sitting near. What
  should he say? How would his color change? In what way could he face her with
  that stain in his soul?</p>

  <p>And this was what Terry said to her: "I'm going to teach El Sangre to let
  you ride him, Kate. By the Lord, I wish you'd been with us going down the
  hill this morning!"</p>

  <p>No shame, no downward head, no remorse. And he was subtly and strangely
  changed. She could not put the difference into words. But his eye seemed
  larger and brighter&mdash;it was no longer possible for her to look deeply
  into it, as she had done so easily the night before. And there were other
  differences.</p>

  <p>He held his head in a more lordly fashion. About every movement there was
  a singular ease and precision. He walked with a lighter step and with a
  catlike softness almost as odd as that of Denver. His step had been light
  before, but it was not like this. But through him and about him there was an
  air of uneasy, alert happiness&mdash;as of one who steals a few perfect
  moments, knowing that they will not be many. A great pity welled in her, and
  a great anger. It was the anger which showed.</p>

  <p>"Terry Hollis, what have you done? You're lookin' me in the eye, but you
  ought to be hangin' your head. You've done murder! Murder! Murder!"</p>

  <p>She let the three words ring through the room like three blows, cutting
  the talk to silence. And all save Terry seemed moved.</p>

  <p>He was laughing down at her&mdash;actually laughing, and there was no
  doubt as to the sincerity of that mirth. His presence drew her and repelled
  her; she became afraid for the first time in her life.</p>

  <p>"A little formality with a gun," he said calmly. "A dog got in my way,
  Kate&mdash;a mad dog. I shot the beast to keep it from doing harm."</p>

  <p>"Ah, Terry, I know everything. I've heard Denver tell it. I know it was a
  man, Terry."</p>

  <p>He insisted carelessly. "By the Lord, Kate, only a dog&mdash;and a mad dog
  at that. Perhaps there was the body of a man, but there was the soul of a dog
  inside the skin. Tut! it isn't worth talking about."</p>

  <p>She drew away from him. "Terry, God pity you. I pity you," she went on
  hurriedly and faintly. "But you ain't the same any more, Terry. I&mdash;I'm
  almost afraid of you!"</p>

  <p>He tried laughingly to stop her, and in a sudden burst of hysterical
  terror she fled from him. Out of the corner of her eye she saw him come after
  her, light as a shadow. And the shadow leaped between her and the door; the
  force of her rush drove her into his arms.</p>

  <p>In the distance she could hear the others laughing&mdash;they understood
  such a game as this, and enjoyed it with all their hearts. Ah, the fools!</p>

  <p>He held her lightly, his fingertips under her elbows. For all the delicacy
  of that touch, she knew that if she attempted to flee, the grip would be
  iron. He would hold her where she was until he was through talking to
  her.</p>

  <p>"Don't you see what I've done?" he was saying rapidly. "You wanted to
  drive me out last night. You said I didn't fit&mdash;that I didn't belong up
  here. Well, Kate, I started out today to make myself fit to belong to this
  company of fine fellows."</p>

  <p>He laughed a little; if it were not real mirth, at least there was a
  fierce quality of joy in his voice.</p>

  <p>"You see, I decided that if I went away I'd be lonely. Particularly, I'd
  be lonely as the devil, Kate, for you!"</p>

  <p>"You've murdered to make yourself one&mdash;of us?"</p>

  <p>"Tush, Kate. You exaggerate entirely. Do you know what I've really done?
  Why, I've wakened; I've come to my senses. After all, there was no other
  place for me to go. I tried the world of good, ordinary working people. I
  asked them to let me come in and prove my right to be one of them. They
  discharged me when I worked honestly on the range. They sent their
  professional gunmen and bullies after me. And then&mdash;I reached the limit
  of my endurance, Kate, and I struck back. And the mockery of it all is
  this&mdash;that though they have struck me repeatedly and I have endured it,
  I&mdash;having struck back a single time&mdash;am barred from among them
  forever. Let it be so!"</p>

  <p>"Hush, Terry. I&mdash;I'm going to think of ways!"</p>

  <p>"You couldn't. Last night&mdash;yes. Today I'm a man&mdash;and I'm free.
  And freedom is the sweetest thing in the world. There's no place else for me
  to go. This is my world. You're my queen. I've won my spurs; I'll use them in
  your service, Kate."</p>

  <p>"Stop, Terry!"</p>

  <p>"By the Lord, I will, though! I'm happy&mdash;don't you see? And I'm going
  to be happier. I'm going to work my way along until I can tell you
  &mdash;that I love you, Kate&mdash;that you're the daintiest body of fire and
  beauty and temper and gentleness and wisdom and fun that was ever crowned
  with the name of a woman. And&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But under the rapid fire of his words there was a touch of hardness
  &mdash;mockery, perhaps. She drew back, and he stepped instantly aside. She
  went by him through the door with bowed head. And Terry, closing it after
  her, heard the first sob.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap32"
     name="chap32">CHAPTER 32</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was as if a gate which had hitherto been closed against
  him in the Pollard house were now opened. They no longer held back from
  Terry, but admitted him freely to their counsels. But the first person to
  whom he spoke was Slim Dugan. There was a certain nervousness about Slim this
  evening, and a certain shame. For he felt that in the morning, to an extent,
  he had backed down from the quarrel with young Black Jack. The killing of
  Larrimer now made that reticence of the morning even more pointed than it had
  been before. With all these things taken into consideration, Slim Dugan was
  in the mood to fight and die; for he felt that his honor was concerned. A
  single slighting remark to Terry, a single sneering side glance, would have
  been a signal for gunplay. And everyone knew it.</p>

  <p>The moment there was silence the son of Black Jack went straight to Slim
  Dugan.</p>

  <p>"Slim," he said, just loud enough for everyone to hear, "a fellow isn't
  himself before noon. I've been thinking over that little trouble we had this
  morning, and I've made up my mind that if there were any fault it was mine
  for taking a joke too seriously. At any rate, if it's agreeable to you, Slim,
  I'd like to shake hands and call everything square. But if there's going to
  be any ill will, let's have it out right now."</p>

  <p>Slim Dugan wrung the hand of Terry without hesitation.</p>

  <p>"If you put it that way," he said cordially, "I don't mind saying that I
  was damned wrong to heave that stone at the hoss. And I apologize,
  Terry."</p>

  <p>And so everything was forgotten. Indeed, where there had been enmity
  before, there was now friendship. And there was a breath of relief drawn by
  every member of the gang. The peacemaking tendency of Hollis had more effect
  on the others than a dozen killings. They already granted that he was
  formidable. They now saw that he was highly desirable also.</p>

  <p>Dinner that night was a friendly affair, except that Kate stayed in her
  room with a headache. Johnny the Chinaman smuggled a tray to her. Oregon
  Charlie went to the heart of matters with one of his rare speeches:</p>

  <p>"You hear me talk, Hollis. She's mad because you've stepped off. She'll
  get over it all right."</p>

  <p>Oregon Charlie had a right to talk. It was an open secret that he had
  loved Kate faithfully ever since he joined the gang. But apparently Terry
  Hollis cared little about the moods of the girl. He was the center of
  festivities that evening until an interruption from the outside formed a
  diversion. It came in the form of a hard rider; the mutter of his hoofs swept
  to the door, and Phil Marvin, having examined the stranger from the shuttered
  loophole beside the entrance, opened the door to him at once.</p>

  <p>"It's Sandy," he fired over his shoulder in explanation.</p>

  <p>A weary-looking fellow came into the room, swinging his hat to knock the
  dust off it, and loosening the bandanna at his throat. The drooping, pale
  mustache explained his name. Two words were spoken, and no more.</p>

  <p>"News?" said Pollard.</p>

  <p>"News," grunted Sandy, and took a place at the table.</p>

  <p>Terry had noted before that there were always one or two extra places
  laid; he had always liked the suggestion of hospitality, but he was rather in
  doubt about this guest. He ate with marvellous expedition, keeping his lean
  face close to the table and bolting his food like a hungry dog. Presently he
  drained his coffee cup, arranged his mustache with painful care, and seemed
  prepared to talk.</p>

  <p>"First thing," he said now&mdash;and utter silence spread around the table
  as he began to talk&mdash;"first thing is that McGuire is coming. I seen him
  on the trail, cut to the left and took the short way. He ought to be loping
  in almost any minute."</p>

  <p>Terry saw the others looking straight at Pollard; the leader was
  thoughtful for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Is he coming with a gang, Sandy?"</p>

  <p>"Nope&mdash;alone."</p>

  <p>"He was always a nervy cuss. Someday&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He left the sentence unfinished. Denver had risen noiselessly.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to beat it for my bunk," he announced. "Let me know when the
  sheriff is gone."</p>

  <p>"Sit where you are, Denver. McGuire ain't going to lay hands on you."</p>

  <p>"Sure he ain't," agreed Denver. "But I ain't partial to having guys lay
  eyes on me, neither. Some of you can go out and beat up trouble. I like to
  stay put."</p>

  <p>And he glided out of the room with no more noise than a sliding shadow. He
  had hardly disappeared when a heavy hand beat at the door.</p>

  <p>"That's McGuire," announced Pollard. "Let him in, Phil." So saying, he
  twitched his gun out of the holster, spun the cylinder, and dropped it
  back.</p>

  <p>"Don't try nothing till you see me put my hand into my beard, boys. He
  don't mean much so long as he's come alone."</p>

  <p>Marvin drew back the door. Terry saw a man with shoulders of martial
  squareness enter. And there was a touch of the military in his brisk step and
  the curt nod he sent at Marvin as he passed the latter. He had not taken off
  his sombrero. It cast a heavy shadow across the upper part of his worn, sad
  face.</p>

  <p>"Evening, sheriff," came from Pollard, and a muttered chorus from the
  others repeated the greeting. The sheriff cast his glance over them like a
  schoolteacher about to deliver a lecture.</p>

  <p>"Evening, boys."</p>

  <p>"Sit down, McGuire."</p>

  <p>"I'm only staying a minute. I'll talk standing." It was a declaration of
  war.</p>

  <p>"I guess this is the first time I been up here, Pollard?"</p>

  <p>"The very first, sheriff."</p>

  <p>"Well, if I been kind of neglectful, it ain't that I'm not interested in
  you-all a heap!"</p>

  <p>He brought it out with a faint smile; there was no response to that
  mirth.</p>

  <p>"Matter of fact, I been keeping my eye on you fellows right along. Now, I
  ain't up here to do no accusing. I'm up here to talk to you man to man.
  They's been a good many queer things happen. None of 'em in my county, mind
  you, or I might have done some talking to you before now. But they's been a
  lot of queer things happen right around in the mountains; and some of 'em has
  traced back kind of close to Joe Pollard's house as a starting point. I ain't
  going to go any further. If I'm wrong, they ain't any harm done; if I'm
  right, you know what I mean. But I tell you this, boys&mdash;we're a
  long-sufferin' lot around these parts, but they's some things that we don't
  stand for, and one of 'em that riles us particular much is when a gent that
  lays out to be a regular hardworking rancher&mdash;even if he ain't got much
  of a ranch to talk about and work about&mdash;takes mankillers under their
  wings. It ain't regular, and it ain't popular around these parts. I guess you
  know what I mean."</p>

  <p>Terry expected Pollard to jump to his feet. But there was no such
  response. The other men stared down at the table, their lips working. Pollard
  alone met the eye of the sheriff.</p>

  <p>The sheriff changed the direction of his glance. Instantly, it fell on
  Terry and stayed there.</p>

  <p>"You're the man I mean; you're Terry Hollis, Black Jack's son?"</p>

  <p>Terry imitated the others and did not reply.</p>

  <p>"Oh, they ain't any use beating about the bush. You got Black Jack's blood
  in you. That's plain. I remember your old man well enough."</p>

  <p>Terry rose slowly from his chair.</p>

  <p>"I think I'm not disputing that, sheriff. As a matter of fact, I'm very
  proud of my father."</p>

  <p>"I think you are," said the sheriff gravely. "I think you are&mdash;
  damned proud of him. So proud you might even figure on imitating what he done
  in the old days."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said Terry. The imp of the perverse was up in him now, urging
  him on.</p>

  <p>"Step soft, sheriff," cried Pollard suddenly, as though he sensed a crisis
  of which the others were unaware. "Terry, keep hold on yourself!"</p>

  <p>The sheriff waved the cautionary advice away.</p>

  <p>"My nerves are tolerable good, Pollard," he said coldly. "The kid ain't
  scaring me none. And now hark to me, Black Jack. You've got away with two
  gents already&mdash;two that's known, I mean. Minter was one and Larrimer was
  two. Both times it was a square break. But I know your kind like a book.
  You're going to step over the line pretty damn pronto, and when you do, I'm
  going to get you, friend, as sure as the sky is blue! You ain't going to do
  what your dad done before you. I'll tell you why. In the old days the law was
  a joke. But it's tolerable strong now. You hear me talk&mdash;get out of
  these here parts and stay out. We don't want none of your kind."</p>

  <p>There was a flinching of the men about the table. They had seen the
  tigerish suddenness with which Terry's temper could flare&mdash;they had
  received an object lesson that morning. But to their amazement he remained
  perfectly cool under fire. He sauntered a little closer to the sheriff.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you, McGuire," he said gently. "Your great mistake is in
  talking too much. You've had a good deal of success, my friend. So much that
  your head is turned. You're quite confident that no one will invade your
  special territory; and you keep your sympathy for neighboring counties. You
  pity the sheriffs around you. Now listen to me. You've branded me as a
  criminal in advance. And I'm not going to disappoint you. I'm going to try to
  live up to your high hopes. And what I do will be done right in your county,
  my friend. I'm going to make the sheriffs pity <i>you</i>, McGuire. I'm going
  to make your life a small bit of hell. I'm going to keep you busy. And
  now&mdash;get out! And before you judge the next man that crosses your path,
  wait for the advice of twelve good men and true. You need advice, McGuire.
  You need it to beat hell! Start on your way!"</p>

  <p>His calmness was shaken a little toward the end of this speech and his
  voice, at the close, rang sharply at McGuire. The latter considered him from
  beneath frowning brows for a moment and then, without another word, without a
  glance to the others and a syllable of adieu, turned and walked slowly,
  thoughtfully, out of the room. Terry walked back to his place. As he sat
  down, he noticed that every eye was upon him, worried.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry that I've had to do so much talking," he said. "And I
  particularly apologize to you, Pollard. But I'm tired of being hounded. As a
  matter of fact, I'm now going to try to play the part of the hound myself.
  Action, boys; action is what we must have, and action right in this county
  under the nose of the complacent McGuire!"</p>

  <h2><a id="chap33"
     name="chap33">CHAPTER 33</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There was no exuberant joy to meet this suggestion. McGuire
  had, as a matter of fact, made his territory practically crime-proof for so
  long that men had lost interest in planning adventures within the sphere of
  his authority. It seemed to the four men of Pollard's gang a peculiar folly
  to cast a challenge in the teeth of the formidable sheriff himself. Even
  Pollard was shaken and looked to Denver. But that worthy, who had returned
  from the door where he was stationed during the presence of the sheriff,
  remained in his place smiling down at his hands. He, for one, seemed oddly
  pleased.</p>

  <p>In the meantime Sandy was setting forth his second and particularly
  interesting news item.</p>

  <p>"You-all know Lewison?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The sour old grouch," affirmed Phil Marvin. "Sure, we know him."</p>

  <p>"I know him, too," said Sandy. "I worked for the tenderfoot that he
  skinned out of the ranch. And then I worked for Lewison. If they's anything
  good about Lewison, you'd need a spyglass to find it, and then it wouldn't be
  fit to see. His wife couldn't live with him; he drove his son off and turned
  him into a drunk; and he's lived his life for his coin."</p>

  <p>"Which he ain't got much to show for it," remarked Marvin. "He lives like
  a starved dog."</p>

  <p>"And that's just why he's got the coin," said Sandy. "He lives on what
  would make a dog sick and his whole life he's been saving every cent he's
  made. He gives his wife one dress every three years till she died. That's how
  tight he is. But he's sure got the money. Told everybody his kid run off with
  all his savings. That's a lie. His kid didn't have the guts or the sense to
  steal even what was coming to him for the work he done for the old miser.
  Matter of fact, he's got enough coin saved&mdash;all gold&mdash;to break the
  back of a mule. That's a fact! Never did no investing, but turned everything
  he made into gold and put it away."</p>

  <p>"How do you know?" This from Denver.</p>

  <p>"How does a buzzard smell a dead cow?" said Sandy inelegantly. "I ain't
  going to tell you how I smell out the facts about money. Wouldn't be any use
  to you if you knew the trick. The facts is these: he sold his ranch. You know
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Sure, we know that."</p>

  <p>"And you know he wouldn't take nothing but gold coin paid down at the
  house?"</p>

  <p>"That so?"</p>

  <p>"It sure is! Now the point's this. He had all his gold in his own private
  safe at home."</p>

  <p>Denver groaned.</p>

  <p>"I know, Denver," nodded Sandy. "Easy pickings for you; but I didn't find
  all this out till the other day. Never even knew he had a safe in his house.
  Not till he has 'em bring out a truck from town and he ships the safe and
  everything in it to the bank. You see, he sold out his own place and he's
  going to another that he bought down the river. Well, boys, here's the dodge.
  That safe of his is in the bank tonight, guarded by old Lewison himself and
  two gunmen he's hired for the job. Tomorrow he starts out down the river with
  the safe on a big wagon, and he'll have half a dozen guards along with him.
  Boys, they's going to be forty thousand dollars in that safe! And the minute
  she gets out of the county&mdash;because old McGuire will guard it to the
  boundary line&mdash;we can lay back in the hills and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You done enough planning, Sandy," broke in Joe Pollard. "You've smelled
  out the loot. Leave it to us to get it. Did you say forty thousand?"</p>

  <p>And on every face around the table Terry saw the same hunger and the same
  yellow glint of the eyes. It would be a big haul, one of the biggest, if not
  the very biggest, Pollard had ever attempted.</p>

  <p>Of the talk that followed, Terry heard little, because he was paying scant
  attention. He saw Joe Pollard lie back in his chair with squinted eyes and
  run over a swift description of the country through which the trail of the
  money would lead. The leader knew every inch of the mountains, it seemed. His
  memory was better than a map; in it was jotted down every fallen log, every
  boulder, it seemed. And when his mind was fixed on the best spot for the
  holdup, he sketched his plan briefly.</p>

  <p>To this man and to that, parts were assigned in brief. There would be more
  to say in the morning about the details. And every man offered suggestions.
  On only one point were they agreed. This was a sum of money for which they
  could well afford to spill blood. For such a prize as this they could well
  risk making the countryside so hot for themselves that they would have to
  leave Pollard's house and establish headquarters elsewhere. Two shares to
  Pollard and one to each of his men, including Sandy, would make the total
  loot some four thousand dollars and more per man. And in the event that
  someone fell in the attempt, which was more than probable, the share for the
  rest would be raised to ten thousand for Pollard and five thousand for each
  of the rest. Terry saw cold glances pass the rounds, and more than one dwelt
  upon him. He was the last to join; if there were to be a death in this
  affair, he would be the least missed of all.</p>

  <p>A sharp order from Pollard terminated the conference and sent his men to
  bed, with Pollard setting the example. But Terry lingered behind and called
  back Denver.</p>

  <p>"There is one point," he said when they were alone, "that it seems to me
  the chief has overlooked."</p>

  <p>"Talk up, kid," grinned Denver Pete. "I seen you was thinking. It sure
  does me good to hear you talk. What's on your mind? Where was Joe wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Not wrong, perhaps. But he overlooked this fact: tonight the safe is
  guarded by three men only; tomorrow it will be guarded by six."</p>

  <p>Denver stared, and then blinked.</p>

  <p>"You mean, try the safe right in town, inside the old bank? Son, you don't
  know the gents in this town. They sleep with a gat under every head and ears
  that hear a pin drop in the next room&mdash;right while they're snoring. They
  dream about fighting and they wake up ready to shoot."</p>

  <p>Terry smiled at this outburst.</p>

  <p>"How long has it been since there was a raid on McGuire's town?"</p>

  <p>"Dunno. Don't remember anybody being that foolish"</p>

  <p>"Then it's been so long that it'll give us a chance. It's been so long
  that the three men on guard tonight will be half asleep."</p>

  <p>"I dunno but you're right. Why didn't you speak up in company? I'll call
  the chief and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait," said Terry, laying a hand on the round, hard-muscled shoulder of
  the yegg. "I had a purpose in waiting. Seven men are too many to take into a
  town."</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>"Two men might surprise three. But seven men are more apt to be
  surprised."</p>

  <p>"Two ag'in' three ain't such bad odds, pal. But&mdash;the first gun that
  pops, we'll have the whole town on our backs."</p>

  <p>"Then we'll have to do it without shooting. You understand, Denver?"</p>

  <p>Denver scratched his head. Plainly he was uneasy; plainly, also, he was
  more and more fascinated by the idea.</p>

  <p>"You and me to turn the trick alone?" he whispered out of the side of his
  mouth in a peculiar, confidentially guilty way that was his when he was
  excited. "Kid, I begin to hear the old Black Jack talk in you! I begin to
  hear him talk! I knew it would come!"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap34"
     name="chap34">CHAPTER 34</a></h2>

  <p class="first">An hour's ride brought them to the environs of the little
  town. But it was already nearly the middle of night and the village was
  black; whatever life waked at that hour had been drawn into the vortex of
  Pedro's. And Pedro's was a place of silence. Terry and Denver skirted down
  the back of the town and saw the broad windows of Pedro's, against which
  passed a moving silhouette now and again, but never a voice floated out to
  them.</p>

  <p>Otherwise the town was dead. They rode until they were at the other
  extremity of the main street. Here, according to Denver, was the bank which
  had never in its entire history been the scene of an attempted raid. They
  threw the reins of their horses after drawing almost perilously close.</p>

  <p>"Because if we get what we want," said Terry, "it will be too heavy to
  carry far."</p>

  <p>And Denver agreed, though they had come so close that from the back of the
  bank it must have been possible to make out the outlines of the horses. The
  bank itself was a broad, dumpy building with adobe walls, whose corners had
  been washed and rounded by time to shapelessness. The walls angled in as they
  rose; the roof was flat. As for the position, it could not have been worse. A
  dwelling abutted on either side of the bank. The second stories of those
  dwellings commanded the roof of the bank; and the front and back porches
  commanded the front and back entrances of the building.</p>

  <p>The moment they had dismounted, Terry and Denver stood a while motionless.
  There was no doubt, even before they approached nearer, about the activity
  and watchfulness of the guards who took care of the new deposit in the bank.
  Across the back wall of the building drifted a shadowy outline&mdash;a guard
  marching steadily back and forth and keeping sentry watch.</p>

  <p>"A stiff job, son," muttered Denver. "I told you these birds wouldn't
  sleep with more'n one eye; and they's a few that's got 'em both open."</p>

  <p>But there was no wavering in Terry. The black stillness of the night; the
  soundless, slowly moving figure across the wall of the building; the hush,
  the stars, and the sense of something to be done stimulated him, filled him
  with a giddy happiness such as he had never known before. Crime? It was no
  crime to Terry Hollis, but a great and delightful game.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he regretted the very presence of Denver Pete. He wanted to be
  alone with this adventure, match his cunning and his strength against whoever
  guarded the money of old Lewison, the miser.</p>

  <p>"Stay here," he whispered in the ear of Denver. "Keep quiet. I'm going to
  slip over there and see what's what. Be patient. It may take a long
  time."</p>

  <p>Denver nodded.</p>

  <p>"Better let me come along. In case&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Your job is opening that safe; my job is to get you to it in safety and
  get you away again with the stuff." Denver shrugged his shoulders. It was
  much in the method of famous old Black Jack himself. There were so many
  features of similarity between the methods of the boy and his father that it
  seemed to Denver that the ghost of the former man had stepped into the body
  of his son.</p>

  <p>In the meantime Terry faded into the dark. His plan of approach was
  perfectly simple. The house to the right of the bank was painted blue.
  Against that dark background no figure stood out clearly. Instead of creeping
  close to the ground to get past the guard at the rear of the building, he
  chose his time when the watcher had turned from the nearest end of his beat
  and was walking in the opposite direction. The moment that happened, Terry
  strode forward as lightly and rapidly as possible.</p>

  <p>Luckily the ground was quite firm. It had once been planted with grass,
  and though the grass had died, its roots remained densely enough to form a
  firm matting, and there was no telltale crunching of the sand underfoot. Even
  so, some slight sound made the guard pause abruptly in the middle of his walk
  and whirl toward Terry. Instead of attempting to hide by dropping down to the
  ground, it came to Terry that the least motion in the dark would serve to
  make him visible. He simply halted at the same moment that the guard halted
  and trusted to the dark background of the house which was now beside him to
  make him invisible. Apparently he was justified. After a moment the guard
  turned and resumed his pacing, and Terry slipped on into the narrow walk
  between the bank and the adjoining house on the right.</p>

  <p>He had hoped for a side window. There was no sign of one. Nothing but the
  sheer, sloping adobe wall, probably of great thickness, and burned to the
  density of soft stone. So he came to the front of the building, and so doing,
  almost ran into a second guard, who paced down the front of the bank just as
  the first kept watch over the rear entrance. Terry flattened himself against
  the side wall and held his breath. But the guard had seen nothing and,
  turning again at the end of his beat, went back in the opposite direction, a
  tall, gaunt man&mdash;so much Terry could make out even in the dark, and his
  heel fell with the heaviness of age. Perhaps this was Lewison himself.</p>

  <p>The moment he was turned, Terry peered around the corner at the front of
  the building. There were two windows, one close to his corner and one on the
  farther side of the door. Both were lighted, but the farther one so dimly
  that it was apparent the light came from one source, and that source directly
  behind the window nearest Terry. He ventured one long, stealthy pace, and
  peered into the window.</p>

  <p>As he had suspected, the interior of the bank was one large room. Half of
  it was fenced off with steel bars that terminated in spikes at the top as
  though, ludicrously, they were meant to keep one from climbing over. Behind
  this steel fencing were the safes of the bank. Outside the fence at a table,
  with a lamp between them, two men were playing cards. And the lamplight
  glinted on the rusty old safe which stood a little at one side.</p>

  <p>Certainly old Lewison was guarding his money well. The hopes of Terry
  disappeared, and as Lewison was now approaching the far end of his beat,
  Terry glided back into the walk between the buildings and crouched there. He
  needed time and thought sadly.</p>

  <p>As far as he could make out, the only two approaches to the bank, front
  and rear, were thoroughly guarded. Not only that, but once inside the bank,
  one would encounter the main obstacle, which consisted of two heavily armed
  men sitting in readiness at the table. If there were any solution to the
  problem, it must be found in another examination of the room.</p>

  <p>Again the tall old man reached the end of his beat nearest Terry, turned
  with military precision and went back. Terry slipped out and was instantly at
  the window again. All was as before. One of the guards had laid down his
  cards to light a cigarette, and dense clouds of smoke floated above his head.
  That partial obscurity annoyed Terry. It seemed as if the luck were playing
  directly against him. However, the smoke began to clear rapidly. When it had
  mounted almost beyond the strongest inner circle of the lantern light, it
  rose with a sudden impetus, as though drawn up by an electric fan. Terry
  wondered at it, and squinted toward the ceiling, but the ceiling was lost in
  shadow.</p>

  <p>He returned to his harborage between the two buildings for a fresh session
  of thought. And then his idea came to him. Only one thing could have sucked
  that straight upward so rapidly, and that was either a fan&mdash;which was
  ridiculous&mdash;or else a draught of air passing through an opening in the
  ceiling.</p>

  <p>Unquestionably that was the case. Two windows, small as they were, would
  never serve adequately to ventilate the big single room of the bank. No doubt
  there was a skylight in the roof of the building and another aperture in the
  floor of the loft.</p>

  <p>At least that was the supposition upon which he must act, or else not act
  at all. He went back as he had come, passed the rear guard easily, and found
  Denver unmoved beside the heads Of the horses.</p>

  <p>"Denver," he said, "we've got to get to the roof of that bank, and the
  only way we can reach it is through the skylight."</p>

  <p>"Skylight?" echoed Denver. "Didn't know there was one." "There has to be,"
  said Terry, with surety. "Can you force a door in one of those houses so we
  can get to the second story of one of 'em and drop to the roof?"</p>

  <p>"Force nothing," whispered Denver. "They don't know what locks on doors
  mean around here."</p>

  <p>And he was right.</p>

  <p>They circled in a broad detour and slipped onto the back porch of the blue
  house; the guard at the rear of the bank was whistling softly as he
  walked.</p>

  <p>"Instead of watchdogs they keep doors with rusty hinges," said Denver as
  he turned the knob, and the door gave an inch inward. "And I dunno which is
  worst. But watch this, bo!"</p>

  <p>And he began to push the door slowly inward. There was never a slackening
  or an increase in the speed with which his hand travelled. It took him a full
  five minutes to open the door a foot and a half. They slipped inside, but
  Denver called Terry back as the latter began to feel his way across the
  kitchen.</p>

  <p>"Wait till I close this door."</p>

  <p>"But why?" whispered Terry.</p>

  <p>"Might make a draught&mdash;might wake up one of these birds. And there
  you are. That's the one rule of politeness for a burglar, Terry. Close the
  doors after you!"</p>

  <p>And the door was closed with fully as much caution and slowness as had
  been used when it was opened. Then Denver took the lead again. He went across
  the kitchen as though he could see in the dark, and then among the tangle of
  chairs in the dining room beyond. Terry followed in his wake, taking care to
  step, as nearly as possible, in the same places. But for all that, Denver
  continually turned in an agony of anger and whispered curses at the noisy
  clumsiness of his companion&mdash;yet to Terry it seemed as though both of
  them were not making a sound.</p>

  <p>The stairs to the second story presented a difficult climb. Denver showed
  him how to walk close to the wall, for there the weight of their bodies would
  act with less leverage on the boards and there would be far less chance of
  causing squeaks. Even then the ascent was not noiseless. The dry air had
  warped the timber sadly, and there was a continual procession of murmurs
  underfoot as they stole to the top of the stairs.</p>

  <p>To Terry, his senses growing superhumanly acute as they entered more and
  more into the heart of their danger, it seemed that those whispers of the
  stairs might serve to waken a hundred men out of sound sleep; in reality they
  were barely audible.</p>

  <p>In the hall a fresh danger met them. A lamp hung from the ceiling, the
  flame turned down for the night. And by that uneasy light Terry made out the
  face of Denver, white, strained, eager, and the little bright eyes forever
  glinting back and forth. He passed a side mirror and his own face was dimly
  visible. It brought him erect with a squeak of the flooring that made Denver
  whirl and shake his fist.</p>

  <p>For what Terry had seen was the same expression that had been on the face
  of his companion&mdash;the same animal alertness, the same hungry eagerness.
  But the fierce gesture of Denver brought him back to the work at hand.</p>

  <p>There were three rooms on the side of the hall nearest the bank. And every
  door was closed. Denver tried the nearest door first, and the opening was
  done with the same caution and slowness which had marked the opening of the
  back door of the house. He did not even put his head through the opening, but
  presently the door was closed and Denver returned.</p>

  <p>"Two," he whispered.</p>

  <p>He could only have told by hearing the sounds of two breathing; Terry
  wondered quietly. The man seemed possessed of abnormal senses. It was strange
  to see that bulky, burly, awkward body become now a sensitive organism,
  possessed of a dangerous grace in the darkness.</p>

  <p>The second door was opened in the same manner. Then the third, and in the
  midst of the last operation a man coughed. Instinctively Terry reached for
  the handle of his gun, but Denver went on gradually closing the door as if
  nothing had happened. He came back to Terry.</p>

  <p>"Every room got sleepers in it," he said. "And the middle room has got a
  man who's awake. We'll have to beat it."</p>

  <p>"We'll stay where we are," said Terry calmly, "for thirty minutes&mdash;
  by guess. That'll give him time to go asleep. Then we'll go through one of
  those rooms and drop to the roof of the bank."</p>

  <p>The yegg cursed softly. "Are you trying to hang me?" he gasped.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," said Terry. "It's easier to wait that way."</p>

  <p>And they sat cross-legged on the floor of the hall. Once the springs of a
  bed creaked as someone turned in it heavily. Once there was a voice&mdash;one
  of the sleepers must have spoken without waking. Those two noises, and no
  more, and yet they remained for what seemed two hours to Terry, but what he
  knew could not be more than twenty minutes.</p>

  <p>"Now," he said to Denver, "we start."</p>

  <p>"Through one of them rooms and out the windows&mdash;without waking
  anybody up?"</p>

  <p>"You can do it. And I'll do it because I have to. Go on."</p>

  <p>He heard the teeth of Denver grit, as though the yegg were being driven on
  into this madcap venture merely by a pride which would not allow him to show
  less courage&mdash;even rash courage&mdash;than his companion.</p>

  <p>The door opened&mdash;Denver went inside and was soaked up&mdash;a shadow
  among shadows. Terry followed and stepped instantly into the presence of the
  sleeper. He could tell it plainly. There was no sound of breathing, though no
  doubt that was plain to the keen ear of Denver&mdash;but it was something
  more than sound or sight. It was like feeling a soul&mdash;that impalpable
  presence in the night. A ghostly and a thrilling thing to Terry Hollis.</p>

  <p>Now, against the window on the farther side of the room, he made out the
  dim outline of Denver's chunky shoulders and shapeless hat. Luckily the
  window was open to its full height. Presently Terry stood beside Denver and
  they looked down. The roof of the bank was only some four feet below them,
  but it was also a full three feet in distance from the side of the house.
  Terry motioned the yegg back and began to slip through the window. It was a
  long and painful process, for at any moment a button might catch or his gun
  scrape &mdash;and the least whisper would ruin everything. At length, he hung
  from his arms at full length. Glancing down, he faintly saw Lewison turn at
  the end of his beat. Why did not the fool look up?</p>

  <p>With that thought he drew up his feet, secured a firm purchase against the
  side of the house, raised himself by the ledge, and then flung himself out
  into the air with the united effort of arms and legs.</p>

  <p>He let himself go loose and relaxed in the air, shot down, and felt the
  roof take his weight lightly, landing on his toes. He had not only made the
  leap, but he had landed a full foot and a half in from the edge of the
  roof.</p>

  <p>Compared with the darkness of the interior of the house, everything on the
  outside was remarkably light now. He could see Denver at the window shaking
  his head. Then the professional slipped over the sill with practiced ease,
  dangled at arm's length, and flung himself out with a quick thrust of his
  feet against the wall.</p>

  <p>The result was that while his feet were flung away far enough and to
  spare, the body of Denver inclined forward. He seemed bound to strike the
  roof with his feet and then drop head first into the alley below. Terry set
  his teeth with a groan, but as he did so, Denver whirled in the air like a
  cat. His body straightened, his feet barely secured a toehold on the edge of
  the roof. The strong arm of Terry jerked him in to safety.</p>

  <p>For a moment they stood close together, Denver panting.</p>

  <p>He was saying over and over again: "Never again. I ain't any acrobat,
  Black Jack!"</p>

  <p>That name came easily on his lips now.</p>

  <p>Once on the roof it was simple enough to find what they wanted. There was
  a broad skylight of dark green glass propped up a foot or more above the
  level of the rest of the flat roof. Beside it Terry dropped upon his knees
  and pushed his head under the glass. All below was pitchy-black, but he
  distinctly caught the odor of Durham tobacco smoke.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap35"
     name="chap35">CHAPTER 35</a></h2>

  <p class="first">That scent of smoke was a clear proof that there was an open
  way through the loft to the room of the bank below them. But would the
  opening be large enough to admit the body of a man? Only exploring could show
  that. He sat back on the roof and put on the mask with which the
  all-thoughtful Denver had provided him. A door banged somewhere far down the
  street, loudly. Someone might be making a hurried and disgusted exit from
  Pedro's. He looked quietly around him. After his immersion in the thick
  darkness of the house, the outer night seemed clear and the stars burned low
  through the thin mountain air. Denver's face was black under the shadow of
  his hat.</p>

  <p>"How are you, kid&mdash;shaky?" he whispered.</p>

  <p>Shaky? It surprised Terry to feel that he had forgotten about fear. He had
  been wrapped in a happiness keener than anything he had known before. Yet the
  scheme was far from accomplished. The real danger was barely beginning.
  Listening keenly, he could hear the sand crunch underfoot of the watcher who
  paced in front of the building; one of the cardplayers laughed from the room
  below&mdash;a faint, distant sound.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry about me," he told Denver, and, securing a strong fingerhold
  on the edge of the ledge, he dropped his full length into the darkness under
  the skylight.</p>

  <p>His tiptoes grazed the floor beneath, and letting his fingers slide off
  their purchase, he lowered himself with painful care so that his heels might
  not jar on the flooring. Then he held his breath&mdash;but there was no
  creaking of the loft floor.</p>

  <p>That made the adventure more possible. An ill-laid floor would have set up
  a ruinous screeching as he moved, however carefully, across it. Now he
  whispered up to Denver. The latter instantly slid down and Terry caught the
  solid bulk of the man under the armpits and lowered him carefully.</p>

  <p>"A rotten rathole," snarled Denver to his companion in that inimitable,
  guarded whisper. "How we ever coming back this way&mdash;in a hurry?"</p>

  <p>It thrilled Terry to hear that appeal&mdash;an indirect surrendering of
  the leadership to him. Again he led the way, stealing toward a ghost of light
  that issued upward from the center of the floor. Presently he could look down
  through it.</p>

  <p>It was an ample square, a full three feet across. Below, and a little more
  than a pace to the side, was the table of the cardplayers. As nearly as he
  could measure, through the misleading wisps and drifts of cigarette smoke,
  the distance to the floor was not more than ten feet&mdash;an easy drop for a
  man hanging by his fingers.</p>

  <p>Denver came to his side, silent as a snake.</p>

  <p>"Listen," whispered Terry, cupping a hand around his lips and leaning
  close to the ear of Denver so that the least thread of sound would be
  sufficient. "I'm going to cover those two from this place. When I have them
  covered, you slip through the opening and drop to the floor. Don't stand
  still, but softfoot it over to the wall. Then cover them with your gun while
  I come down. The idea is this. Outside that window there's a second guard
  walking up and down. He can look through and see the table where they're
  playing, but he can't see the safe against the wall. As long as he sees those
  two sitting there playing their cards, he'll be sure that everything is all
  right. Well, Denver, he's going to keep on seeing them sitting at their
  game&mdash;but in the meantime you're going to make your preparations for
  blowing the safe. Can you do it? Is your nerve up to it?"</p>

  <p>Even the indomitable Denver paused before answering. The chances of
  success in this novel game were about one in ten. Only shame to be outbraved
  by his younger companion and pupil made him nod and mutter his assent.</p>

  <p>That mutter, strangely, was loud enough to reach to the room below. Terry
  saw one of the men look up sharply, and at the same moment he pulled his gun
  and shoved it far enough through the gap for the light to catch on its
  barrel.</p>

  <p>"Sit tight!" he ordered them in a cutting whisper. "Not a move, my
  friends!"</p>

  <p>There was a convulsive movement toward a gun on the part of the first man,
  but the gesture was frozen midway; the second man looked up, gaping,
  ludicrous in astonishment. But Terry was in no mood to see the
  ridiculous.</p>

  <p>"Look down again!" he ordered brusquely. "Keep on with that game. And the
  moment one of you goes for a gun&mdash;the minute one of you makes a sign or
  a sound to reach the man in front of the house, I drill you both. Is that
  clear?"</p>

  <p>The neck of the man who was nearest to him swelled as though he were
  lifting a great weight with his head; no doubt he was battling with shrewd
  temptations to spring to one side and drive a bullet at the robbers above
  him. But prudence conquered. He began to deal, laying out the cards with
  mechanical, stiff motions.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Terry to Denver.</p>

  <p>Denver was through the opening in a flash and dropped to the floor below
  with a thud. Then he leaped away toward the wall out of sight of Terry.
  Suddenly a loud, nasal voice spoke through one of the front windows:</p>

  <p>"What was that, boys?"</p>

  <p>Terry caught his breath. He dared not whisper advice to those men at the
  table for fear his voice might carry to the guard who was apparently leaning
  at the window outside. But the dealer jerked his head for an instant toward
  the direction in which Denver had disappeared. Evidently the yegg was
  silently communicating imperious instructions, for presently the dealer said,
  in a voice natural enough: "Nothing happened, Lewison. I just moved my chair;
  that was all, I figure."</p>

  <p>"I dunno," growled Lewison. "I been waiting for something to happen for so
  long that I begin to hear things and suspect things where they ain't nothing
  at all."</p>

  <p>And, still mumbling, his voice passed away.</p>

  <p>Terry followed Denver's example, dropping through the opening; but, more
  cautious, he relaxed his leg muscles, so that he landed in a bunched heap,
  without sound, and instantly joined Denver on the farther side of the room.
  Lewison's gaunt outline swept past the window at the same moment.</p>

  <p>He found that he had estimated viewpoints accurately enough. From only the
  right-hand window could Lewison see into the interior of the room and make
  out his two guards at the table. And it was only by actually leaning through
  the window that he would be able to see the safe beside which Terry and
  Denver stood.</p>

  <p>"Start!" said Terry, and Denver deftly laid out a little kit and two small
  packages. With incredible speed he began to make his molding of soft soap
  around the crack of the safe door. Terry turned his back on his companion and
  gave his undivided attention to the two at the table.</p>

  <p>Their faces were odd studies in suppressed shame and rage. The muscles
  were taut; their hands shook with the cards.</p>

  <p>"You seem kind of glum, boys!" broke in the voice of Lewison at the
  window.</p>

  <p>Terry flattened himself against the wall and jerked up his gun&mdash;a
  warning flash which seemed to be reflected by the glint in the eyes of the
  red- headed man facing him. The latter turned slowly to the window.</p>

  <p>"Oh, we're all right," he drawled. "Kind of getting wearying, this
  watch."</p>

  <p>"Mind you," crackled the uncertain voice of Lewison, "five dollars if you
  keep on the job till morning. No, six dollars, boys!"</p>

  <p>He brought out the last words in the ringing voice of one making a
  generous sacrifice, and Terry smiled behind his mask. Lewison passed on
  again. Forcing all his nerve power into the faculty of listening, Terry could
  tell by the crunching of the sand how the owner of the safe went far from the
  window and turned again toward it.</p>

  <p>"Start talking," he commanded softly of the men at the table.</p>

  <p>"About what?" answered the red-haired man through his teeth. "About what,
  damn you!"</p>

  <p>"Tell a joke," ordered Terry.</p>

  <p>The other scowled down at his hand of cards&mdash;and then obeyed.</p>

  <p>"Ever hear about how Rooney&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The voice was hard at the beginning; then, in spite of the levelled gun
  which covered him, the red-haired man became absorbed in the interest of the
  tale. He began to labor to win a smile from his companion. That would be
  something worthwhile&mdash;something to tell about afterward; how he made Pat
  laugh while a pair of bandits stood in a corner with guns on them!</p>

  <p>In his heart Terry admired that red-haired man's nerve. The next time
  Lewison passed the window, he darted out and swiftly went the rounds of the
  table, relieving each man of his weapon. He returned to his place. Pat had
  broken into hearty laughter.</p>

  <p>"That's it!" cried Lewison, passing the window again. "Laughin' keeps a
  gent awake. That's the stuff, Red!" A time of silence came, with only the
  faint noises of Denver at his rapid work.</p>

  <p>"Suppose they was to rush the bank, even?" said Lewison on his next trip
  past the window.</p>

  <p>"Who's they?" asked Red, and looked steadily into the mouth of Terry's
  gun.</p>

  <p>"Why, them that wants my money. Money that I slaved and worked for all my
  life! Oh, I know they's a lot of crooked thieves that would like to lay hands
  on it. But I'm going to fool 'em, Red. Never lost a cent of money in all my
  born days, and I ain't going to form the habit this late in life. I got too
  much to live for!"</p>

  <p>And he went on his way muttering.</p>

  <p>"Ready!" said Denver.</p>

  <p>"Red," whispered Terry, "how's the money put into the safe?"</p>

  <p>The big, red-haired fellow fought him silently with his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I dunno!"</p>

  <p>"Red," said Terry swiftly, "you and your friend are a dead weight on us
  just now. And there's one quick, convenient way of getting rid of you. Talk
  out, my friend. Tell us how that money is stowed."</p>

  <p>Red flushed, the veins in the center of his forehead swelling under a rush
  of blood to the head. He was silent.</p>

  <p>It was Pat who weakened, shuddering.</p>

  <p>"Stowed in canvas sacks, boys. And some paper money."</p>

  <p>The news of the greenbacks was welcome, for a large sum of gold would be
  an elephant's burden to them in their flight.</p>

  <p>"Wait," Terry directed Denver. The latter kneeled by his fuse until
  Lewison passed far down the end of his beat. Terry stepped to the door and
  dropped the bolt.</p>

  <p>"Now!" he commanded.</p>

  <p>He had planned his work carefully. The loose strips of cords which Denver
  had put into his pocket&mdash;"nothing so handy as strong twine," he had said
  &mdash;were already drawn out. And the minute he had given the signal, he
  sprang for the men at the table, backed them into a corner, and tied their
  hands behind their backs.</p>

  <p>The fuse was sputtering.</p>

  <p>"Put out the light!" whispered Denver. It was done&mdash;a leap and a puff
  of breath, and then Terry had joined the huddled group of men at the farther
  end of the room.</p>

  <p>"Hey!" called Lewison. "What's happened to the light? What the hell
  &mdash;"</p>

  <p>His voice boomed out loudly at them as he thrust his head through the
  window into the darkness. He caught sight of the red, flickering end of the
  fuse.</p>

  <p>His voice, grown shrill and sharp, was chopped off by the explosion. It
  was a noise such as Terry had never heard before&mdash;like a tremendously
  condensed and powerful puff of wind. There was not a sharp jar, but he felt
  an invisible pressure against his body, taking his breath. The sound of the
  explosion was dull, muffled, thick. The door of the safe crushed into the
  flooring.</p>

  <p>Terry had nerved himself for two points of attack&mdash;Lewison from the
  front of the building, and the guard at the rear. But Lewison did not yell
  for help. He had been dangerously close to the explosion and the shock to his
  nerves, perhaps some dislodged missile, had flung him senseless on the sand
  outside the bank.</p>

  <p>But from the rear of the building came a dull shout; then the door beside
  which Terry stood was dragged open&mdash;he struck with all his weight,
  driving his fist fairly into the face of the man, and feeling the knuckles
  cut through flesh and lodge against the cheekbone. The guard went down in the
  middle of a cry and did not stir. Terry leaned to shake his arm&mdash;the man
  was thoroughly stunned. He paused only to scoop up the fallen revolver which
  the fellow had been carrying, and fling it into the night. Then he turned
  back into the dark bank, with Red and Pat cursing in frightened unison as
  they cowered against the wall behind him.</p>

  <p>The air was thick with an ill-smelling smoke, like that of a partially
  snuffed candle. Then he saw a circle of light spring out from the electric
  lantern of Denver and fall on the partially wrecked safe. And it glinted on
  yellow. One of the sacks had been slit and the contents were running out onto
  the floor like golden water.</p>

  <p>Over it stooped the shadow of Denver, and Terry was instantly beside him.
  They were limp little sacks, marvellously ponderous, and the chill of the
  metal struck through the canvas to the hand. The searchlight flickered here
  and there &mdash;it found the little drawer which was wrenched open and
  Denver's stubby hand came out, choked with greenbacks.</p>

  <p>"Now away!" snarled Denver. And his voice shook and quaked; it reminded
  Terry of the whine of a dog half-starved and come upon meat&mdash;a savage,
  subdued sound.</p>

  <p>There was another sound from the street where old Lewison was coming to
  his senses&mdash;a gasping, sound, and then a choked cry: "Help!"</p>

  <p>His senses and his voice seemed to return to him with a rush. His shriek
  split through the darkness of the room like a ray of light probing to find
  the guilty: "Thieves! Help!"</p>

  <p>The yell gave strength to Terry. He caught some of the burden that was
  staggering Denver into his own arms and floundered through the rear door into
  the blessed openness of the night. His left arm carried the crushing burden
  of the canvas sacks&mdash;in his right hand was the gun&mdash;but no form
  showed behind him.</p>

  <p>But there were voices beginning. The yells of Lewison had struck out
  echoes up and down the street. Terry could hear shouts begin inside houses in
  answer, and bark out with sudden clearness as a door or a window was
  opened.</p>

  <p>They reached the horses, dumped the precious burdens into the saddlebags,
  and mounted.</p>

  <p>"Which way?" gasped Denver.</p>

  <p>A light flickered in the bank; half a dozen men spilled out of the back
  door, cursing and shouting.</p>

  <p>"Walk your horse," said Terry. "Walk it&mdash;you fool!"</p>

  <p>Denver had let his horse break into a trot. He drew it back to a walk at
  this hushed command.</p>

  <p>"They won't see us unless we start at a hard gallop," continued Terry.
  "They won't watch for slowly moving objects now. Besides, it'll be ten
  minutes before the sheriff has a posse organized. And that's the only thing
  we have to fear."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap36"
     name="chap36">CHAPTER 36</a></h2>

  <p class="first">They drifted past the town, quickening to a soft trot after
  a moment, and then to a faster trot&mdash;El Sangre was gliding along at a
  steady pace.</p>

  <p>"Not back to the house!" said Denver with an oath, when they straightened
  back to the house of Pollard. "That's the first place McGuire will look,
  after what you said to him the other night."</p>

  <p>"That's where I want him to look," answered Terry, "and that's where he'll
  find me. Pollard will hide the coin and we'll get one of the boys to take our
  sweaty horses over the hills. We can tell McGuire that the two horses have
  been put out to pasture, if he asks. But he mustn't find hot horses in the
  stable. Certainly McGuire will strike for the house. But what will he
  find?"</p>

  <p>He laughed joyously.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the voice of Denver cut in softly, insinuatingly.</p>

  <p>"You dope it that he'll cut for the house of Pollard? So do I. Now, kid,
  why not go another direction&mdash;and keep on going? What right have Pollard
  and the others to cut in on this coin? You and me, kid, can&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't hear you, Denver," interrupted Terry. "I don't hear you. We
  wouldn't have known where to find the stuff if it hadn't been for Pollard's
  friend Sandy. They get their share&mdash;but you can have my part, Denver.
  I'm not doing this for money; it's only an object lesson to that fat-headed
  sheriff. I'd pay twice this price for the sake of the little talk I'm going
  to have with him later on tonight."</p>

  <p>"All right&mdash;Black Jack," muttered Denver. For it seemed to him that
  the voice of the lost leader had spoken. "Play the fool, then, kid. But
  &mdash;let's feed these skates the spur! The town's boiling!"</p>

  <p>Indeed, there was a dull roar behind them.</p>

  <p>"No danger," chuckled Terry. "McGuire knows perfectly well that I've done
  this. And because he knows that, and he knows that I know it, he'll strike in
  the opposite direction to Pollard's house. He'll never dream that I would go
  right back to Pollard and sit down under the famous nose of McGuire!"</p>

  <p>The dawn was brightening over the mountains above them, and the skyline
  was ragged with forest. A free country for free men&mdash;like the old Black
  Jack and the new. A short life, perhaps, but a full one.</p>

  <p>The coming of the day showed Denver's face weary and drawn. Those moments
  in the bank, surrounded by danger, had been nerve-racking even to his
  experience. But to him it was a business, and to Terry it was a game. He felt
  a qualm of pity for Lewison&mdash;but, after all, the man was a wolf,
  selfish, accumulating money to no purpose, useless to the world. He shrugged
  the thought of Lewison away.</p>

  <p>It was close to sunrise when they reached the house, and having put up the
  horses, staggered in and called to Johnny to bring them coffee; he was
  already rattling at the kitchen stove. Then, with a shout, they brought
  Pollard himself stumbling down from the balcony rubbing the sleep out of his
  eyes. They threw the money down before him.</p>

  <p>He was stupefied, and then his big lion's voice went booming with the call
  for his men. Terry did not wait; he stretched himself with a great yawn and
  made for his bed, and passed Phil Marvin and the others hurrying downstairs
  to answer the summons. Kate Pollard came also. She paused as he went by her
  and he saw her eyes go down to his dusty boots, with the leather polished
  where the stirrup had chafed, then flashed back to his face.</p>

  <p>"You, Terry!" she whispered.</p>

  <p>But he went by her with a wave of the hand.</p>

  <p>The girl went on down to the big room. They were gathered already, a
  bright-eyed, hungry-faced crew of men. Gold was piled across the table in
  front of them. Slim Dugan had been ordered to go to the highest window of the
  house and keep watch for the coming of the expected posse. In the meantime
  the others counted the money, ranging it in bright little stacks; and Denver
  told the tale.</p>

  <p>He took a little more credit to himself than was his due. But it was his
  part to pay a tribute to Terry. For was it not he who had brought the son of
  Black Jack among them?</p>

  <p>"And of all the close squeezes I ever been in," concluded Denver, "that
  was the closest. And of all the nervy, cold-eyed guys I ever see, Black
  Jack's kid takes the cake. Never a quiver all the time. And when he
  whispered, them two guys at the table jumped. He meant business, and they
  knew it."</p>

  <p>The girl listened. Her eye alone was not upon the money, but fixed far
  off, at thin distance.</p>

  <p>"Thirty-five thousand gold," announced Pollard, with a break of excitement
  in his voice, "and seventeen thousand three hundred and eighty-two in paper.
  Boys, the richest haul we ever made! And the coolest deal all the way
  through. Which I say, Denver and Terry&mdash;Terry particular&mdash;gets
  extra shares for what they done!"</p>

  <p>And there was a chorus of hearty approval. The voice of Denver cut it
  short.</p>

  <p>"Terry don't want none. No, boys, knock me dead if he does. Can you beat
  it? 'I did it to keep my word,' he says, 'with the sheriff. You can have my
  share, Denver.'</p>

  <p>"And he sticks on it. It's a game with him, boys. He plays at it like a
  big kid!"</p>

  <p>In the hush of astonishment, the eyes of Kate misted. Something in that
  last speech had stung her cruelly. Something had to be done, and quickly, to
  save young Terry Hollis. But what power could influence him?</p>

  <p>It was that thought which brought her to the hope for a solution. A very
  vague and faraway hope to which she clung and which unravelled slowly in her
  imagination. Before she left the kitchen, her plan was made, and immediately
  after breakfast, she went to her room and dressed for a long journey.</p>

  <p>"I'm going over the hills to visit the Stockton girls," she told her
  father. "Be gone a few days."</p>

  <p>His mind was too filled with hope for the future to understand her. He
  nodded idly, and she was gone.</p>

  <p>She roped the toughest mustang of her "string" in the corral, and ten
  minutes later she was jogging down the trail. Halfway down a confused group
  of riders&mdash;some dozen in all&mdash;swarmed up out of the lower trail.
  Sheriff McGuire rode out on a sweating horse that told of fierce and long
  riding and stopped her.</p>

  <p>His salutation was brief; he plunged into the heart of his questions. Had
  she noticed anything unusual this morning? Which of the men had been absent
  from the house last night? Particularly, who went out with Black Jack's
  kid?</p>

  <p>"Nobody left the house," she said steadily. "Not a soul."</p>

  <p>And she kept a blank eye on the sheriff while he bit his lip and studied
  her.</p>

  <p>"Kate," he said at length, "I don't blame you for not talking. I don't
  suppose I would in your place. But your dad has about reached the end of the
  rope with us. If you got any influence, try to change him, because if he
  don't do it by his own will, he's going to be changed by force!"</p>

  <p>And he rode on up the trail, followed by the silent string of riders on
  their grunting, tired horses. She gave them only a careless glance. Joe
  Pollard had baffled officers of the law before, and he would do it again.
  That was not her great concern on this day.</p>

  <p>Down the trail she sent her mustang again, and broke him out into a stiff
  gallop on the level ground below. She headed straight through the town, and
  found a large group collected in and around the bank building. They turned
  and looked after her, but no one spoke a greeting. Plainly the sheriff's
  suspicions were shared by others.</p>

  <p>She shook that shadow out of her head and devoted her entire attention to
  the trail which roughened and grew narrow on the other side of the town. Far
  away across the mountains lay her goal&mdash;the Cornish ranch.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap37"
     name="chap37">CHAPTER 37</a></h2>

  <p class="first">When she first glimpsed Bear Valley from the summits of the
  Blue Mountains, it seemed to her a small paradise. And as she rode lower and
  lower among the hills, the impression gathered strength. So she came out onto
  the road and trotted her cow-pony slowly under the beautiful branches of the
  silver spruce, and saw the bright tree shadows reflected in Bear Creek.
  Surely here was a place of infinite quiet, made for happiness. A peculiar
  ache and sense of emptiness entered her heart, and the ghost of Terry Hollis
  galloped soundlessly beside her on flaming El Sangre through the shadow. It
  seemed to her that she could understand him more easily. His had been a
  sheltered and pleasant life here, half dreamy; and when he wakened into a
  world of stern reality and stern men, he was still playing at a game like a
  boy&mdash;as Denver Pete had said.</p>

  <p>She came out into view of the house. And again she paused. It was like a
  palace to Kate, that great white facade and the Doric columns of the veranda.
  She had always thought that the house of her father was a big and stable
  house; compared with this, it was a shack, a lean-to, a veritable hovel. And
  the confidence which had been hers during the hard ride of two days across
  the mountains grew weaker. How could she talk to the woman who owned such an
  establishment as this? How could she even gain access to her?</p>

  <p>On a broad, level terrace below the house men were busy with plows and
  scrapers smoothing the ground; she circled around them, and brought her horse
  to a stop before the veranda. Two men sat on it, one white-haired,
  hawk-faced, spreading a broad blueprint before the other; and this man was
  middle-aged, with a sleek, young face. A very good-looking fellow, she
  thought.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you-all could tell me," said Kate Pollard, lounging in the saddle,
  "where I'll find the lady that owns this here place?"</p>

  <p>It seemed to her that the sleek-faced man flushed a little.</p>

  <p>"If you wish to talk to the owner," he said crisply, and barely touching
  his hat to her, "I'll do your business. What is it? Cattle lost over the Blue
  Mountains again? No strays have come down into the valley."</p>

  <p>"I'm not here about cattle," she answered curtly enough. "I'm here about a
  man."</p>

  <p>"H'm," said the other. "A man?" His attention quickened. "What man?"</p>

  <p>"Terry Hollis."</p>

  <p>She could see him start. She could also see that he endeavored to conceal
  it. And she did not know whether she liked or disliked that quick start and
  flush. There was something either of guilt or of surprise remarkably strong
  in it. He rose from his chair, leaving the blueprint fluttering in the hands
  of his companion alone.</p>

  <p>"I am Vance Cornish," he told her. She could feel his eyes prying at her
  as though he were trying to get at her more accurately. "What's Hollis been
  up to now?"</p>

  <p>He turned and explained carelessly to his companion: "That's the young
  scapegrace I told you about, Waters. Been raising Cain again, I suppose." He
  faced the girl again.</p>

  <p>"A good deal of it," she answered. "Yes, he's been making quite a bit of
  trouble."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry for that, really," said Vance. "But we are not responsible for
  him."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you ain't," said Kate Pollard slowly. "But I'd like to talk to
  the lady of the house."</p>

  <p>"Very sorry," and again he looked in his sharp way&mdash;like a fox, she
  thought&mdash;and then glanced away as though there were no interest in her
  or her topic. "Very sorry, but my sister is in&mdash;er&mdash; critically
  declining health. I'm afraid she cannot see you."</p>

  <p>This repulse made Kate thoughtful. She was not used to such bluff talk
  from men, however smooth or rough the exterior might be. And under the quiet
  of Vance she sensed an opposition like a stone wall.</p>

  <p>"I guess you ain't a friend of Terry's?"</p>

  <p>"I'd hardly like to put it strongly one way or the other. I know the boy,
  if that's what you mean."</p>

  <p>"It ain't." She considered him again. And again she was secretly pleased
  to see him stir under the cool probe of her eyes. "How long did you live with
  Terry?"</p>

  <p>"He was with us twenty-four years." He turned and explained casually to
  Waters. "He was taken in as a foundling, you know. Quite against my advice.
  And then, at the end of the twenty-four years, the bad blood of his father
  came out, and he showed himself in his true colors. Fearful waste of time to
  us all &mdash;of course, we had to turn him out."</p>

  <p>"Of course," nodded Waters sympathetically, and he looked wistfully down
  at his blueprint.</p>

  <p>"Twenty-four years you lived with Terry," said the girl softly, "and you
  don't like him, I see."</p>

  <p>Instantly and forever he was damned in her eyes. Anyone who could live
  twenty-four years with Terry Hollis and not discover his fineness was beneath
  contempt.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you," she said. "I've <i>got</i> to see Miss Elizabeth
  Cornish."</p>

  <p>"H'm!" said Vance. "I'm afraid not. But&mdash;just what have you to tell
  her?"</p>

  <p>The girl smiled.</p>

  <p>"If I could tell you that, I wouldn't have to see her."</p>

  <p>He rubbed his chin with his knuckles, staring at the floor of the veranda,
  and now and then raising quick glances at her. Plainly he was suspicious.
  Plainly, also, he was tempted in some manner.</p>

  <p>"Something he's done, eh? Some yarn about Terry?"</p>

  <p>It was quite plain that this man actually wanted her to have something
  unpleasant to say about Terry. Instantly she suited herself to his mood; for
  he was the door through which she must pass to see Elizabeth Cornish.</p>

  <p>"Bad?" she said, hardening her expression as much as possible. "Well, bad
  enough. A killing to begin with."</p>

  <p>There was a gleam in his eyes&mdash;a gleam of positive joy, she was sure,
  though he banished it at once and shook his head in deprecation.</p>

  <p>"Well, well! As bad as that? I suppose you may see my sister. For a
  moment. Just a moment. She is not well. I wish I could understand your
  purpose!"</p>

  <p>The last was more to himself than to her. But she was already off her
  horse. The man with the blueprint glared at her, and she passed across the
  veranda and into the house, where Vance showed her up the big stairs. At the
  door of his sister's room he paused again and scrutinized.</p>

  <p>"A killing&mdash;by Jove!" he murmured to himself, and then knocked.</p>

  <p>A dull voice called from within, and he opened. Kate found herself in a
  big, solemn room, in one corner of which sat an old woman wrapped to the chin
  in a shawl. The face was thin and bleak, and the eyes that looked at Kate
  were dull.</p>

  <p>"This girl&mdash;" said Vance. "By Jove, I haven't asked your name, I'm
  afraid."</p>

  <p>"Kate Pollard."</p>

  <p>"Miss Pollard has some news of Terry. I thought it might&mdash;interest
  you, Elizabeth."</p>

  <p>Kate saw the brief struggle on the face of the old woman. When it passed,
  her eyes were as dull as ever, but her voice had become husky.</p>

  <p>"I'm surprised, Vance. I thought you understood&mdash;his name is not to
  be spoken, if you please."</p>

  <p>"Of course not. Yet I thought&mdash;never mind. If you'll step downstairs
  with me, Miss Pollard, and tell me what&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not a step," answered the girl firmly, and she had not moved her eyes
  from the face of the elder woman. "Not a step with you. What I have to say
  has got to be told to someone who loves Terry Hollis. I've found that
  someone. I stick here till I've done talking."</p>

  <p>Vance Cornish gasped. But Elizabeth opened her eyes, and they brightened
  &mdash;but coldly, it seemed to Kate.</p>

  <p>"I think I understand," said Elizabeth Cornish gravely. "He has entangled
  the interest of this poor girl&mdash;and sent her to plead for him. Is that
  so? If it's money he wants, let her have what she asks for, Vance. But I
  can't talk to her of the boy."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Vance, without enthusiasm. He stepped before her. "Will
  you step this way, Miss Pollard?"</p>

  <p>"Not a step," she repeated, and deliberately sat down in a chair. "You'd
  better leave," she told Vance.</p>

  <p>He considered her in open anger. "If you've come to make a scene, I'll
  have to let you know that on account of my sister I cannot endure it. Really
  &mdash;" "I'm going to stay here," she echoed, "until I've done talking. I've
  found the right person. I know that. Tell you what I want? Why, you hate
  Terry Hollis!"</p>

  <p>"Hate&mdash;him?" murmured Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" cried Vance.</p>

  <p>"Look at his face, Miss Cornish," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"Vance, by everything that's sacred, your eyes were positively shrinking.
  Do you hate&mdash;him?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Elizabeth, if this unknown&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You'd better leave," interrupted the girl. "Miss Cornish is going to hear
  me talk."</p>

  <p>Before he could answer, his sister said calmly: "I think I shall, Vance. I
  begin to be intrigued."</p>

  <p>"In the first place," he blurted angrily, "it's something you shouldn't
  hear&mdash;some talk about a murder&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Elizabeth sank back in her chair and closed her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Ah, coward!" cried Kate Pollard, now on her feet.</p>

  <p>"Vance, will you leave me for a moment?"</p>

  <p>For a moment he was white with malice, staring at the girl, then suddenly
  submitting to the inevitable, turned on his heel and left the room.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Elizabeth, sitting erect again, "what is it? Why do you insist
  on talking to me of&mdash;him? And&mdash;what has he done?"</p>

  <p>In spite of her calm, a quiver of emotion was behind the last words, and
  nothing of it escaped Kate Pollard.</p>

  <p>"I knew," she said gently, "that <i>two</i> people couldn't live with
  Terry for twenty-four years and both hate him, as your brother does. I can
  tell you very quickly why I'm here, Miss Cornish."</p>

  <p>"But first&mdash;what has he done?"</p>

  <p>Kate hesitated. Under the iron self-control of the older woman she saw the
  hungry heart, and it stirred her. Yet she was by no means sure of a triumph.
  She recognized the most formidable of all foes&mdash;pride. After all, she
  wanted to humble that pride. She felt that all the danger in which Terry
  Hollis now stood, both moral and physical, was indirectly the result of this
  woman's attitude. And she struck her, deliberately cruelly.</p>

  <p>"He's taken up with a gang of hard ones, Miss Cornish. That's one
  thing."</p>

  <p>The face of Elizabeth was like stone.</p>

  <p>"Professional&mdash;thieves, robbers!"</p>

  <p>And still Elizabeth refused to wince. She forced a cold, polite smile of
  attention.</p>

  <p>"He went into a town and killed the best fighter they had."</p>

  <p>And even this blow did not tell.</p>

  <p>"And then he defied the sheriff, went back to the town, and broke into a
  bank and stole fifty thousand dollars."</p>

  <p>The smile wavered and went out, but still the dull eyes of Elizabeth were
  steady enough. Though perhaps that dullness was from pain. And Kate, waiting
  eagerly, was chagrined to see that she had not broken through to any softness
  of emotion. One sign of grief and trembling was all she wanted before she
  made her appeal; but there was no weakness in Elizabeth Cornish, it
  seemed.</p>

  <p>"You see I am listening," she said gravely and almost gently. "Although I
  am really not well. And I hardly see the point of this long recital of
  crimes. It was because I foresaw what he would become that I sent him
  away."</p>

  <p>"Miss Cornish, why'd you take him in in the first place?"</p>

  <p>"It's a long story," said Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>"I'm a pretty good listener," said Kate.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth Cornish looked away, as though she hesitated to touch on the
  subject, or as though it were too unimportant to be referred to at
  length.</p>

  <p>"In brief, I saw from a hotel window Black Jack, his father, shot down in
  the street; heard about the infant son he left, and adopted the child&mdash;
  on a bet with my brother. To see if blood would tell or if I could make him a
  fine man."</p>

  <p>She paused.</p>

  <p>"My brother won the bet!"</p>

  <p>And her smile was a wonderful thing, so perfectly did it mask her
  pain.</p>

  <p>"And, of course, I sent Terry away. I have forgotten him, really. Just a
  bad experiment."</p>

  <p>Kate Pollard flushed.</p>

  <p>"You'll never forget him," she said firmly. "You think of him every
  day!"</p>

  <p>The elder woman started and looked sharply at her visitor. Then she
  dismissed the idea with a shrug.</p>

  <p>"That's absurd. Why should I think of him?"</p>

  <p>There is a spirit of prophecy in most women, old or young; and especially
  they have a way of looking through the flesh of their kind and seeing the
  heart. Kate Pollard came a little closer to her hostess.</p>

  <p>"You saw Black Jack die in the street," she queried, "fighting for his
  life?"</p>

  <p>Elizabeth dreamed into the vague distance.</p>

  <p>"Riding down the street with his hair blowing&mdash;long black hair, you
  know," she reminisced. "And holding the crowd back as one would hold back a
  crowd of curs. Then&mdash;he was shot from the side by a man in concealment.
  That was how he fell!"</p>

  <p>"I knew," murmured the girl, nodding. "Miss Cornish, I know now why you
  took in Terry."</p>

  <p>"Ah?"</p>

  <p>"Not because of a bet&mdash;but because you&mdash;you loved Black Jack
  Hollis!"</p>

  <p>It brought an indrawn gasp from Elizabeth. Rather of horror than surprise.
  But the girl went on steadily:</p>

  <p>"I know. You saw him with his hair blowing, fighting his way&mdash;he rode
  into your heart. I know, I tell you! Maybe you've never guessed it all these
  years. But has a single day gone when you haven't thought of the
  picture?"</p>

  <p>The scornful, indignant denial died on the lips of Elizabeth Cornish. She
  stared at Kate as though she were seeing a ghost.</p>

  <p>"Not one day!" cried Kate. "And so you took in Terry, and you raised him
  and loved him&mdash;not for a bet, but because he was Black Jack's son!"</p>

  <p>Elizabeth Cornish had grown paler than before. "I mustn't listen to such
  talk," she said.</p>

  <p>"Ah," cried the girl, "don't you see that I have a right to talk? Because
  I love him also, and I know that you love him, too."</p>

  <p>Elizabeth Cornish came to her feet, and there was a faint flush in her
  cheeks.</p>

  <p>"You love Terry? Ah, I see. And he has sent you!"</p>

  <p>"He'd die sooner than send me to you."</p>

  <p>"And yet&mdash;you came?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you see?" pleaded Kate. "He's in a corner. He's about to go
  &mdash;bad!"</p>

  <p>"Miss Pollard, how do you know these things?"</p>

  <p>"Because I'm the daughter of the leader of the gang!"</p>

  <p>She said it without shame, proudly.</p>

  <p>"I've tried to keep him from the life he intends leading," said Kate. "I
  can't turn him. He laughs at me. I'm nothing to him, you see? And he loves
  the new life. He loves the freedom. Besides, he thinks that there's no hope.
  That he has to be what his father was before him. Do you know why he thinks
  that? Because you turned him out. You thought he would turn bad. And he
  respects you. He still turns to you. Ah, if you could hear him speak of you!
  He loves you still!"</p>

  <p>Elizabeth Cornish dropped back into her chair, grown suddenly weak, and
  Kate fell on her knees beside her.</p>

  <p>"Don't you see," she said softly, "that no strength can turn Terry back
  now? He's done nothing wrong. He shot down the man who killed his father. He
  has killed another man who was a professional bully and mankiller. And he's
  broken into a bank and taken money from a man who deserved to lose it&mdash;a
  wolf of a man everybody hates. He's done nothing really wrong yet, but he
  will before long. Just because he's stronger than other men. And he doesn't
  know his strength. And he's fine, Miss Cornish. Isn't he always gentle
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hush!" said Elizabeth Cornish.</p>

  <p>"He's just a boy; you can't bend him with strength, but you can win him
  with love."</p>

  <p>"What," gasped Elizabeth, "do you want me to do?"</p>

  <p>"Bring him back. Bring him back, Miss Cornish!"</p>

  <p>Elizabeth Cornish was trembling.</p>

  <p>"But I&mdash;if you can't influence him, how can I? You with your
  beautiful&mdash;you are very beautiful, dear child. Ah, very lovely!"</p>

  <p>She barely touched the bright hair.</p>

  <p>"He doesn't even think of me," said the girl sadly. "But I have no shame.
  I have let you know everything. It isn't for me. It's for Terry, Miss
  Cornish. And you'll come? You'll come as quickly as you can? You'll come to
  my father's house? You'll ask Terry to come back? One word will do it! And
  I'll hurry back and&mdash;keep him there till you come. God give me strength!
  I'll keep him till you come!"</p>

  <p>Outside the door, his ear pressed to the crack, Vance Cornish did not wait
  to hear more. He knew the answer of Elizabeth before she spoke. And all his
  high-built schemes he saw topple about his ears. Grief had been breaking the
  heart of his sister, he knew. Grief had been bringing her close to the grave.
  With Terry back, she would regain ten years of life. With Terry back, the old
  life would begin again.</p>

  <p>He straightened and staggered down the stairs like a drunken man, clinging
  to the banister. It was an old-faced man who came out onto the veranda, where
  Waters was chewing his cigar angrily. At sight of his host he started up. He
  was a keen man, was Waters. He could sense money a thousand miles away. And
  it was this buzzard keenness which had brought him to the Cornish ranch and
  made him Vance's right-hand man. There was much money to be spent; Waters
  would direct and plan the spending, and his commission would not be
  small.</p>

  <p>In the face of Vance he saw his own doom.</p>

  <p>"Waters," said Vance Cornish, "everything is going up in smoke. That
  damned girl&mdash;Waters, we're ruined."</p>

  <p>"Tush!" said Waters, smiling, though he had grown gray. "No one girl can
  ruin two middle-aged men with our senses developed. Sit down, man, and we'll
  figure a way out of this."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap38"
     name="chap38">CHAPTER 38</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The fine gray head, the hawklike, aristocratic face, and the
  superior manner of Waters procured him admission to many places where the
  ordinary man was barred. It secured him admission on this day to the office
  of Sheriff McGuire, though McGuire had refused to see his best friends.</p>

  <p>A proof of the perturbed state of his mind was that he accepted the
  proffered fresh cigar of Waters without comment or thanks. His mental
  troubles made him crisp to the point of rudeness.</p>

  <p>"I'm a tolerable busy man, Mr.&mdash;Waters, I think they said your name
  was. Tell me what you want, and make it short, if you don't mind."</p>

  <p>"Not a bit, sir. I rarely waste many words. But I think on this occasion
  we have a subject in common that will interest you."</p>

  <p>Waters had come on what he felt was more or less of a wild-goose chase.
  The great object was to keep young Hollis from coming in contact with
  Elizabeth Cornish again. One such interview, as Vance Cornish had assured
  him, would restore the boy to the ranch, make him the heir to the estate, and
  turn Vance and his high ambitions out of doors. Also, the high commission of
  Mr. Waters would cease. With no plan in mind, he had rushed to the point of
  contact, and hoped to find some scheme after he arrived there. As for Vance,
  the latter would promise money; otherwise he was a shaken wreck of a man and
  of no use. But with money, Mr. Waters felt that he had the key to this world
  and he was not without hope.</p>

  <p>Three hours in the hotel of the town gave him many clues. Three hours of
  casual gossip on the veranda of the same hotel had placed him in possession
  of about every fact, true or presumably true, that could be learned, and with
  the knowledge a plan sprang into his fertile brain. The worn, worried face of
  the sheriff had been like water on a dry field; he felt that the seed of his
  plan would immediately spring up and bear fruit.</p>

  <p>"And that thing we got in common?" said the sheriff tersely.</p>

  <p>"It's this&mdash;young Terry Hollis."</p>

  <p>He let that shot go home without a follow-up and was pleased to see the
  sheriff's forehead wrinkle with pain.</p>

  <p>"He's like a ghost hauntin' me," declared McGuire, with an attempted laugh
  that failed flatly. "Every time I turn around, somebody throws this Hollis in
  my face. What is it now?"</p>

  <p>"Do you mind if I run over the situation briefly, as I understand it?"</p>

  <p>"Fire away!"</p>

  <p>The sheriff settled back; he had forgotten his rush of business.</p>

  <p>"As I understand it, you, Mr. McGuire, have the reputation of keeping your
  county clean of crime and scenes of violence."</p>

  <p>"Huh!" grunted the sheriff.</p>

  <p>"Everyone says," went on Waters, "that no one except a man named Minter
  has done such work in meeting the criminal element on their own ground. You
  have kept your county peaceful. I believe that is true?"</p>

  <p>"Huh," repeated McGuire. "Kind of soft-soapy, but it ain't all wrong. They
  ain't been much doing in these parts since I started to clean things up."</p>

  <p>"Until recently," suggested Waters.</p>

  <p>The face of the sheriff darkened. "Well?" he asked aggressively.</p>

  <p>"And then two crimes in a row. First, a gun brawl in broad daylight
  &mdash;young Hollis shot a fellow named&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Larrimer," snapped the sheriff viciously. "It was a square fight.
  Larrimer forced the scrap."</p>

  <p>"I suppose so. Nevertheless, it was a gunfight. And next, two men raid the
  bank in the middle of your town, and in spite of you and of special guards,
  blow the door off a safe and gut the safe of its contents. Am I right?"</p>

  <p>The sheriff merely scowled.</p>

  <p>"It ain't clear to me yet," he declared, "how you and me get together on
  any topic we got in common. Looks sort of like we was just hearing one old
  yarn over and over agin."</p>

  <p>"My dear sir," smiled Waters, "you have not allowed me to come to the crux
  of my story. Which is: that you and I have one great object in common
  &mdash;to dispose of this Terry Hollis, for I take it for granted that if you
  were to get rid of him the people who criticize now would do nothing but
  cheer you. Am I right?"</p>

  <p>"If I could get him," sighed the sheriff. "Mr. Waters, gimme time and I'll
  get him, right enough. But the trouble with the gents around these parts is
  that they been spoiled. I cleaned up all the bad ones so damn quick that they
  think I can do the same with every crook that comes along. But this Hollis is
  a slick one, I tell you. He covers his tracks. Laughs in my face, and admits
  what he done, when he talks to me, like he done the other day. But as far as
  evidence goes, I ain't got anything on him&mdash;yet. But I'll get it!"</p>

  <p>"And in the meantime," said Waters brutally, "they say that you're getting
  old."</p>

  <p>The sheriff became a brilliant purple.</p>

  <p>"Do they say that?" he muttered. "That's gratitude for you, Mr. Waters!
  After what I've done for 'em&mdash;they say I'm getting old just because I
  can't get anything on this slippery kid right off!"</p>

  <p>He changed from purple to gray. To fail now and lose his position meant a
  ruined life. And Waters knew what was in his mind.</p>

  <p>"But if you got Terry Hollis, they'd be stronger behind you than
  ever."</p>

  <p>"Ah, wouldn't they, though? Tell me what a great gent I was quick as a
  flash."</p>

  <p>He sneered at the thought of public opinion.</p>

  <p>"And you see," said Waters, "where I come in is that I have a plan for
  getting this Hollis you desire so much."</p>

  <p>"You do?" He rose and grasped the arm of Waters. "You do?"</p>

  <p>Waters nodded.</p>

  <p>"It's this way. I understand that he killed Larrimer, and Larrimer's older
  brother is the one who is rousing public opinion against you. Am I
  right?"</p>

  <p>"The dog! Yes, you're right."</p>

  <p>"Then get Larrimer to send Terry Hollis an invitation to come down into
  town and meet him face to face in a gun fight. I understand this Hollis is a
  daredevil sort and wouldn't refuse an invitation of that nature. He'd have to
  respond or else lose his growing reputation as a maneater."</p>

  <p>"Maneater? Why, Bud Larrimer wouldn't be more'n a mouthful for him. Sure
  he'd come to town. And he'd clean up quick. But Larrimer ain't fool enough to
  send such an invite."</p>

  <p>"You don't understand me," persisted Waters patiently. "What I mean is
  this. Larrimer sends the challenge, if you wish to call it that. He takes up
  a certain position. Say in a public place. You and your men, if you wish, are
  posted nearby, but out of view when young Hollis comes. When Terry Hollis
  arrives, the moment he touches a gun butt, you fill him full of lead and
  accuse him of using unfair play against Larrimer. Any excuse will do. The
  public want an end of young Hollis. They won't be particular with their
  questions."</p>

  <p>He found it difficult to meet the narrowed eyes of the sheriff.</p>

  <p>"What you want me to do," said the sheriff, with slow effort, "is to set a
  trap, get Hollis into it, and then&mdash;murder him?"</p>

  <p>"A brutal way of putting it, my dear fellow."</p>

  <p>"A true way," said the sheriff.</p>

  <p>But he was thinking, and Waters waited.</p>

  <p>When he spoke, his voice was soft enough to blend with the sheriff's
  thoughts without actually interrupting them.</p>

  <p>"You're not a youngster any more, sheriff, and if you lose out here, your
  reputation is gone for good. You'll not have the time to rebuild it. Here is
  a chance for you not only to stop the evil rumors, but to fortify your past
  record with a new bit of work that will make people talk of you. They don't
  really care how you do it. They won't split hairs about method. They want
  Hollis put out of the way. I say, cache yourself away. Let Hollis come to
  meet Larrimer in a private room. You can arrange it with Larrimer yourself
  later on. You shoot from concealment the moment Hollis shows his face. It can
  be said that Larrimer did the shooting, and beat Hollis to the draw. The
  glory of it will bribe Larrimer."</p>

  <p>The sheriff shook his head. Waters leaned forward.</p>

  <p>"My friend," he said. "I represent in this matter a wealthy man to whom
  the removal of Terry Hollis will be worth money. Five thousand dollars cash,
  sheriff!"</p>

  <p>The sheriff moistened his lips and his eyes grew wild. He had lived long
  and worked hard and saved little. Yet he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Ten thousand dollars," whispered Waters. "Cash!"</p>

  <p>The sheriff groaned, rose, paced the room, and then slumped into a
  chair.</p>

  <p>"Tell Bud Larrimer I want to see him," he said. The following letter,
  which was received at the house of Joe Pollard, was indeed a gem of
  English:</p>

  <p class="letter">"Mr. Terry Black Jack:<br>
  <br>
  "Sir, I got this to say. Since you done my brother dirt I bin looking for a
  chans to get even and I ain't seen any chanses coming my way so Ime going to
  make one which I mean that Ile be waiting for you in town today and if you
  don't come Ile let the boys know that you aint only an ornery mean skunk but
  your a yaller hearted dog also which I beg to remain<br>
  <br>
  "Yours very truly,<br>
  <br>
  "Bud Larrimer."</p>

  <p>Terry Hollis read the letter and tossed it with laughter to Phil Marvin,
  who sat cross-legged on the floor mending a saddle, and Phil and the rest of
  the boys shook their heads over it.</p>

  <p>"What I can't make out," said Joe Pollard, voicing the sentiments of the
  rest, "is how Bud Larrimer, that's as slow as a plow horse with a gun, could
  ever find the guts to challenge Terry Hollis to a fair fight."</p>

  <p>Kate Pollard rose anxiously with a suggestion. Today or tomorrow at the
  latest she expected the arrival of Elizabeth Cornish, and so far it had been
  easy to keep Terry at the house. The gang was gorged with the loot of the
  Lewison robbery, and Terry's appetite for excitement had been cloyed by that
  event also. This strange challenge from the older Larrimer was the fly in the
  ointment.</p>

  <p>"It ain't hard to tell why he sent that challenge," she declared. "He has
  some sneaking plan up his sleeve, Dad. You know Bud Larrimer. He hasn't the
  nerve to fight a boy. How'll he ever manage to stand up to Terry unless he's
  got hidden backing?"</p>

  <p>She herself did not know how accurately she was hitting off the situation;
  but she was drawing it as black as possible to hold Terry from accepting the
  challenge. It was her father who doubted her suggestion.</p>

  <p>"It sounds queer," he said, "but the gents of these parts don't make no
  ambushes while McGuire is around. He's a clean shooter, is McGuire, and he
  don't stand for no shady work with guns."</p>

  <p>Again Kate went to the attack.</p>

  <p>"But the sheriff would do anything to get Terry. You know that. And maybe
  he isn't so particular about how it's done. Dad, don't you let Terry make a
  step toward town! I <i>know</i> something would happen! And even if they
  didn't ambush him, he would be outlawed even if he won the fight. No matter
  how fair he may fight, they won't stand for two killings in so short a time.
  You know that, Dad. They'd have a mob out here to lynch him!"</p>

  <p>"You're right, Kate," nodded her father. "Terry, you better stay put."</p>

  <p>But Terry Hollis had risen and stretched himself to the full length of his
  height, and extended his long arms sleepily. Every muscle played smoothly up
  his arms and along his shoulders. He was fit for action from the top of his
  head to the soles of his feet.</p>

  <p>"Partners," he announced gently, "no matter what Bud Larrimer has on his
  mind, I've got to go in and meet him. Maybe I can convince him without gun
  talk. I hope so. But it will have to be on the terms he wants. I'll saddle up
  and lope into town."</p>

  <p>He started for the door. The other members of the Pollard gang looked at
  one another and shrugged their shoulders. Plainly the whole affair was a bad
  mess. If Terry shot Larrimer, he would certainly be followed by a lynching
  mob, because no self-respecting Western town could allow two members of its
  community to be dropped in quick succession by one man of an otherwise
  questionable past. No matter how fair the gunplay, just as Kate had said, the
  mob would rise. But on the other hand, how could Terry refuse to respond to
  such an invitation without compromising his reputation as a man without
  fear?</p>

  <p>There was nothing to do but fight.</p>

  <p>But Kate ran to her father. "Dad," she cried, "you got to stop him!"</p>

  <p>He looked into her drawn face in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Look here, honey," he advised rather sternly. "Man-talk is man-talk, and
  man-ways are man-ways, and a girl like you can't understand. You keep out of
  this mess. It's bad enough without having your hand added."</p>

  <p>She saw there was nothing to be gained in this direction. She turned to
  the rest of the men; they watched her with blank faces. Not a man there but
  would have done much for the sake of a single smile. But how could they
  help?</p>

  <p>Desperately she ran to the door, jerked it open, and followed Terry to the
  stable. He had swung the saddle from its peg and slipped it over the back of
  El Sangre, and the great stallion turned to watch this perennially
  interesting operation.</p>

  <p>"Terry," she said, "I want ten words with you."</p>

  <p>"I know what you want to say," he answered gently. "You want to make me
  stay away from town today. To tell you the truth, Kate, I hate to go in. I
  hate it like the devil. But what can I do? I have no grudge against Larrimer.
  But if he wants to talk about his brother's death, why&mdash;good Lord, Kate,
  I have to go in and listen, don't I? I can't dodge that responsibility!"</p>

  <p>"It's a trick, Terry. I swear it's a trick. I can feel it!" She dropped
  her hand nervously on the heavy revolver which she wore strapped at her hip,
  and fingered the gold chasing. Without her gun, ever since early girlhood,
  she had felt that her toilet was not complete.</p>

  <p>"It may be," he nodded thoughtfully. "And I appreciate the advice, Kate
  &mdash;but what would you have me do?"</p>

  <p>"Terry," she said eagerly, "you know what this means. You've killed once.
  If you go into town today, it means either that you kill or get killed. And
  one thing is about as bad as the other."</p>

  <p>Again he nodded. She was surprised that he would admit so much, but there
  were parts of his nature which, plainly, she had not yet reached to.</p>

  <p>"What difference does it make, Kate?" His voice fell into a profound
  gloom. "What difference? I can't change myself. I'm what I am. It's in the
  blood. I was born to this. I can't help it. I know that I'll lose in the end.
  But while I live I'll be happy. A little while!"</p>

  <p>She choked. But the sight of his drawing the cinches, the imminence of his
  departure, cleared her mind again.</p>

  <p>"Give me two minutes," she begged.</p>

  <p>"Not one," he answered. "Kate, you only make us both unhappy. Do you
  suppose I wouldn't change if I could?"</p>

  <p>He came to her and took her hands.</p>

  <p>"Honey, there are a thousand things I'd like to say to you, but being what
  I am, I have no right to say them to you&mdash;never, or to any other woman!
  I'm born to be what I am. I tell you, Kate, the woman who raised me, who was
  a mother to me, saw what I was going to be&mdash;and turned me out like a
  dog! And I don't blame her. She was right!"</p>

  <p>She grasped at the straw of hope.</p>

  <p>"Terry, that woman has changed her mind. You hear? She's lived heartbroken
  since she turned you out. And now she's coming for you to&mdash; to beg you
  to come back to her! Terry, that's how much she's given up hope in you!"</p>

  <p>But he drew back, his face growing dark.</p>

  <p>"You've been to see her, Kate? That's where you went when you were away
  those four days?"</p>

  <p>She dared not answer. He was trembling with hurt pride and rage.</p>

  <p>"You went to her&mdash;she thought I sent you&mdash;that I've grown
  ashamed of my own father, and that I want to beg her to take me back? Is that
  what she thinks?"</p>

  <p>He struck his hand across his forehead and groaned.</p>

  <p>"God! I'd rather die than have her think it for a minute. Kate, how could
  you do it? I'd have trusted you always to do the right thing and the proud
  thing&mdash;and here you've shamed me!"</p>

  <p>He turned to the horse, and El Sangre stepped out of the stall and into a
  shaft of sunlight that burned on him like blood-red fire. And beside him
  young Terry Hollis, straight as a pine, and as strong&mdash;a glorious
  figure. It broke her heart to see him, knowing what was coming.</p>

  <p>"Terry, if you ride down yonder, you're going to a dog's death! I swear
  you are, Terry!"</p>

  <p>She stretched out her arms to him; but he turned to her with his hand on
  the pommel, and his face was like iron.</p>

  <p>"I've made my choice. Will you stand aside, Kate?"</p>

  <p>"You're set on going? Nothing will change you? But I tell you, I'm going
  to change you! I'm only a girl. And I can't stop you with a girl's weapons.
  I'll do it with a man's. Terry, take the saddle off that horse! And promise
  me you'll stay here till Elizabeth Cornish comes!"</p>

  <p>"Elizabeth Cornish?" He laughed bitterly. "When she conies, I'll be a
  hundred miles away, and bound farther off. That's final."</p>

  <p>"You're wrong," she cried hysterically. "You're going to stay here. You
  may throw away your share in yourself. But I have a share that I won't throw
  away. Terry, for the last time!"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>She caught her breath with a sob. Someone was coming from the outside. She
  heard her father's deep-throated laughter. Whatever was done, she must do it
  quickly. And he must be stopped!</p>

  <p>The hand on the gun butt jerked up&mdash;the long gun flashed in her
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Kate!" cried Terry. "Good God, are you mad?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she sobbed. "Mad! Will you stay?"</p>

  <p>"What infernal nonsense&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The gun boomed hollowly in the narrow passage between mow and wall. El
  Sangre reared, a red flash in the sunlight, and landed far away in the
  shadow, trembling. But Terry Hollis had spun halfway around, swung by the
  heavy, tearing impact of the big slug, and then sank to the floor, where he
  sat clasping his torn thigh with both hands, his shoulder and head sagging
  against the wall.</p>

  <p>Joe Pollard, rushing in with an outcry, found the gun lying sparkling in
  the sunshine, and his daughter, hysterical and weeping, holding the wounded
  man in her arms.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;in the name of&mdash;" he roared.</p>

  <p>"Accident, Joe," gasped Terry. "Fooling with Kate's gun and trying a spin
  with it. It went off&mdash;drilled me clean through the leg!"</p>

  <p>That night, very late, in Joe Pollard's house, Terry Hollis lay on the bed
  with a dim light reaching to him from the hooded lamp in the corner of the
  room. His arms were stretched out on each side and one hand held that of
  Kate, warm, soft, young, clasping his fingers feverishly and happily. And on
  the other side was the firm, cool pressure of the hand of Aunt Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>His mind was in a haze. Vaguely he perceived the gleam of tears on the
  face of Elizabeth. And he had heard her say: "All the time I didn't know,
  Terry. I thought I was ashamed of the blood in you. But this girl opened my
  eyes. She told me the truth. The reason I took you in was because I loved
  that wild, fierce, gentle, terrible father of yours. If you have done a
  little of what he did, what does it matter? Nothing to me! Oh, Terry, nothing
  in the world to me! Except that Kate brought me to my senses in
  time&mdash;bless her &mdash;and now I have you back, dear boy!"</p>

  <p>He remembered smiling faintly and happily at that. And he said before he
  slept: "It's a bit queer, isn't it, even two wise women can't show a man that
  he's a fool? It takes a bullet to turn the trick!"</p>

  <p>But when he went to sleep, his head turned a little from Elizabeth toward
  Kate.</p>

  <p>And the women raised their heads and looked at one another with filmy
  eyes. They both understood what that feeble gesture meant. It told much of
  the fine heart of Elizabeth&mdash;that she was able to smile at the girl and
  forgive her for having stolen again what she had restored.</p>

  <p>It was the break-up of the Pollard gang, the sudden disaffection of their
  newest and most brilliant member. Joe himself was financed by Elizabeth
  Cornish and opened a small string of small-town hotels.</p>

  <p>"Which is just another angle of the road business," he often said, "except
  that the law works with you and not agin you."</p>

  <p>But he never quite recovered from the restoration of the Lewison money on
  which Elizabeth and Terry both insisted. Neither did Denver Pete. He left
  them in disgust and was never heard of again in those parts. And he always
  thereafter referred to Terry as "a promising kid gone to waste."</p>
