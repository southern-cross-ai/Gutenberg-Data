  <h2><a name="story1"
     id="story1"></a>I. &mdash; A PRINCESS OF KENT</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Harper's Magazine</i>, April 1908</h3>

  <p class="first">CEDRIC the churl looked up from the basket he was weaving of
  osier bands and listened.</p>

  <p>The thick woods of Kent lay to right and left of him; a path wound through
  the clustering trees, and, as it dipped to the distance, there was a flash of
  vivid blue sea.</p>

  <p>The autumn foliage, faded to hues of gold and brown, rustled in a bright
  sunshine; dead leaves strewed the ground, but grass of a clear green grew in
  patches beneath the trees.</p>

  <p>In this little clearing in the forest stood a wattled hut. The thin smoke
  curled slowly from it in delicate spirals against the cloudless sky; at the
  doorway stood a yellow-haired child, clasping a rough red pitcher to the
  bosom of her striped frock.</p>

  <p>Cedric, seated on a log, listened.</p>

  <p>The sharp notes of birds broke on the stillness and the soft sound of
  coming horses.</p>

  <p>The little girl came lazily across the grass, the sun dazzled in her
  brilliant hair and on her bare brown arms; she sang to herself happily.</p>

  <p>Through the trees, riding swiftly from the sea, came a party of horsemen;
  they rode in single file by reason of the narrowness of the path, and trotted
  so, one at a time, into the clearing, where each halted, waiting for the
  next.</p>

  <p>Cedric moved the completed osier baskets behind the log, so that they were
  secure from thievery or accident, and stared leisurely at the strangers.
  There came forty or more of them, and a few serving men.</p>

  <p>As they gathered there, a confused group, gazing to right and left, the
  blue eyes of the Saxon were stolidly observing them.</p>

  <p>He saw men handsomely dressed in travelling mantles lined with fox and
  beaver, their horses laden with packages and fair painted coffers; the
  servants had bundles at their backs. Dark men they were, with high, sharp
  features, unarmed, distinctly not warriors; they conversed together in a soft
  strange tongue, leaning from their saddles towards each other with wondering
  anxious faces. Two kept themselves apart: one, a haughty, handsome man of an
  imperious presence, who held his purple mantle carelessly at the breast with
  a white ringed hand, and stared round him with bright black eyes; the other,
  different in dress and bearing from the rest, a man clothed in armor linked
  with gold.</p>

  <p>The Saxon child crept up to her father's side, eying the strangers, and
  one of them, turning, looked at the man and the hut beyond.</p>

  <p>He wheeled his horse round and spoke in Saxon, a little halting.</p>

  <p>"This is the kingdom of Kent?" he asked. "Surely it is so?"</p>

  <p>Cedric nodded.</p>

  <p>The other travellers turned to listen, and the two apart watched
  composedly.</p>

  <p>"Listen," said the first speaker. "We are invited of the King&mdash;your
  King; we are from across the sea, certainly. I am Frankish. I come because my
  language is the language of this country. These," he glanced round at his
  companions, "are from Rome, verily. Where is your King?"</p>

  <p>"Canterbury," answered Cedric. "And who be ye?"</p>

  <p>The stranger indicated the man in the purple mantle.</p>

  <p>"He, the prior Augustine, hath been sent by the Pope to convert this land
  of Britain faithfully," he said. "We are his humble company. We bring
  knowledge of the true God, verily."</p>

  <p>Cedric gazed at Augustine.</p>

  <p>"Is it the God," he said, "whom the Queen hath a chapel in honor of? A
  place, lordings, with fair colored windows."</p>

  <p>"Verily the Queen Bertha of Kent hath such a chapel, and a holy man who
  daily holdeth service; truly, through this righteous woman's workings upon
  her husband, hath he written to Rome for servants of God to come and preach
  the true faith in the land."</p>

  <p>"It is a goodly chapel," the churl replied. "And many repair there in
  wonder. It holdeth a picture of a fair-faced man, and a cloth worked in silk
  and the hair of the Queen."</p>

  <p>The stranger, smiling, answered:</p>

  <p>"Many more wonders than that will we bring ye, for our God healeth the
  sick, yea, and raiseth the dead."</p>

  <p>Then another interrupted, saying:</p>

  <p>"Wherefore hath not the King sent to welcome us? Last night we landed,
  and, behold! there were none&mdash;neither folk nor lodging. Verily, we have
  slept beneath the trees. This morning one came saying, 'Here are horses and
  food,' and with that departed hastily."</p>

  <p>Cedric shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I know naught. The King is at Canterbury."</p>

  <p>They looked at one another; "The road is strange to us, certainly."</p>

  <p>"But ye cannot mistake it," said Cedric. "Riding through the wood ye come
  upon an open road. Follow it; it shall bring ye to Canterbury."</p>

  <p>The priests set their horses in motion. There was great jingling of bits
  and harness, and the sun made a gallant show of the furred and embroidered
  garments.</p>

  <p>Cedric picked up the unfinished basket. The child, idly holding her
  pitcher, stood by his side, with fearless blue eyes considering the
  strangers.</p>

  <p>"Beware of the wood," said Cedric, "if ye bring new gods."</p>

  <p>A priest with his fingers in the reins turned and asked sharply,
  "Wherefore?"</p>

  <p>"It belongeth," said the churl, putting back his yellow hair, "to the old
  gods, and they are jealous."</p>

  <p>He fixed the osier bands between his knees and began skilfully plaiting
  them.</p>

  <p>"Mostly," he continued, "it belongeth to Freda&mdash;she hath a well
  there."</p>

  <p>"She is a false god," returned the priest; "an idol&mdash;an image, such
  as we have come to destroy utterly."</p>

  <p>"She is the wife of Thor," said Cedric, "and she sits in the wood yonder
  by the well."</p>

  <p>"Truly that is a lie," said the priest, calmly. "And unholy men have
  deceived thee. She is not there&mdash;certainly ye may search and never find
  her."</p>

  <p>On the ending of his words rose a burst of laughter, so clear and sudden
  that they started in their saddles.</p>

  <p>It came from the child.</p>

  <p>"I have seen her," she said.</p>

  <p>They stared at her.</p>

  <p>"I have seen Freda sitting by her well," she went on.</p>

  <p>"Child," said the Frankish bishop, "ye spoke of what cannot be. Lies have
  deluded ye."</p>

  <p>But the girl shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I have spoken with her," she persisted. "She cometh from the well."</p>

  <p>The priest's dark face grew stern.</p>

  <p>"Here is deceit and a device of the devil," he said, apart. "Child, ye saw
  nothing."</p>

  <p>She laughed again. "I will tell ye the manner of her. She is a goodly
  goddess, small, with white feet. She sits in the well&mdash;something she
  sings, and leaneth sideways to gaze into the water."</p>

  <p>The priest frowned.</p>

  <p>"They even wallow in their error! When the King is converted, Kent will be
  also converted, and ye will see the folly, child, of falsehoods, verily."</p>

  <p>But she only smiled and turned away with her pitcher. There was a pause.
  Augustine gazed after her; then he spoke to the Frank, and his voice was
  cold.</p>

  <p>"What doth the pagan say?" he asked. "I must learn the Saxon,
  certainly!"</p>

  <p>"She speaketh of her false gods," was the answer. "Lo! they are deep in
  error."</p>

  <p>The priests rode on in stately fashion across the clearing. Cedric paused
  from his osier plaiting to watch them go, but the child, holding her pitcher
  in the tinkling stream, sang unconcernedly of Freda as the clear water
  bubbled into the lip.</p>

  <p>Two abreast now, for the path was wider, the priests proceeded through the
  forest. The ground was soft with acorns and beech mast, and the trailing
  brambles glowed orange and scarlet with berries; a multitude of birds sang
  continually, and the sky was a marvellous blue.</p>

  <p>The only one of the company who was no monk, the knight Valerian of
  Ravenna, began to sing for joy of the weather and the fresh wind blowing
  lightly on his face. For here were no slumbrous airs nor swooning sunshine,
  as he had known in Italy, but a clear brightness and an exalting freshness.
  It had rained lately, and the autumn perfume of damp earth and leaves was in
  his nostrils. Now and then the startled deer fled at their approach, slipping
  like red shadows through the yellow bracken; rabbits fled across their path,
  and pheasants with splendid plumage.</p>

  <p>The knight Valerian, brother of Augustine the prior, began singing the
  louder:</p><br>

  <p class="poem">"What hope have I of gaining heaven,<br>
  Myrra&mdash;when the virtues are few,<br>
  Myrra&mdash;when the sins are seven,<br>
  "And the sweetest sin is you&mdash;is you!</p>

  <p class="poem">"Surely I have no need of heaven<br>
  (Sins that are seven),<br>
  When the sun shines gold through the shade of the vine,<br>
  And thou art mine&mdash;and thou art mine!"</p><br>

  <p>At that, Augustine checked him; for how, said he, "shall he that is
  profane convert the pagan?"</p>

  <p>But Valerian laughed as if the pagan were no great matter, and held up his
  hand with its green ring, and watched the light slip in and out of the
  jewel.</p>

  <p>"It is a smiling land," he said. "Right glad am I, I came, certainly."</p>

  <p>"Surely it shall shine more," said Augustine, from his purple hood, "when
  it is under the power of Rome."</p>

  <p>Valerian plucked a spray of ash berries as he passed the bending tree.</p>

  <p>"Yet the old gods keep it gay, verily," he smiled; and in his pleasant
  voice the song rose again:</p><br>

  <p class="poem">"What hope have I of a saintly crown,<br>
  When the world is so sweet,<br>
  And two hands draw me down,<br>
  Two lips to meet&mdash;to meet!</p>

  <p class="poem">"Surely I have no need of heaven<br>
  (Sins that are seven),<br>
  When the grass is green and daisy pied,<br>
  And the shadows hide&mdash;the shadows hide!"</p><br>

  <p>Then he fell to silence and thinking of the child's talk of Freda (for he
  knew the Frankish tongue).</p>

  <p>Valerian the knight was good to look upon; he had a face such as the old
  Romans gave their gods, smooth and very proud; his hair curled a little under
  his helmet, and was, like his eyes, dark as the horse he rode.</p>

  <p>Augustine the prior was very like unto him, save for the pallor of his
  face and his monk's dress; yet in pride and splendor he was his equal, for he
  took his mission in no humility, but imperially.</p>

  <p>Both shone in embroidery, square cut colored stones, and the rich, dark
  hues of Byzantium. From Valerian's shoulders hung a silken cloak of red hue,
  and round his full, bare throat was a golden chain.</p>

  <p>The greenwood spread and broadened about them; it seemed that the fair
  loneliness increased as they advanced.</p>

  <p>The train of monks and serving men rode in silence; Valerian fixed the ash
  berries between his horse's ears.</p>

  <p>"The King," said Augustine, haughtily, "should have sent, certainly, even
  to meet us graciously."</p>

  <p>"As I do think," replied Valerian, "he doth wish it to seem thou hast come
  of thine own will. Maybe he feareth the old gods, verily."</p>

  <p>Augustine's dark eyes surveyed him sideways.</p>

  <p>"Something art thou of a pagan, Valerian."</p>

  <p>The knight laughed.</p>

  <p>"Lo! this wood is beautiful, certainly," he said. "The little maid spoke
  of the gods dwelling here&mdash;lo! I look for them fearfully."</p>

  <p>The sun was creeping towards the horizon; here under the trees the great
  shadows lay, and the blue of the sky was burning pale and cold.</p><br>

  <p class="poem">"Surely I have no need of heaven<br>
  (Sins that are seven),<br>
  For the calm of the dawn is over the sea,<br>
  And the touch of thy hand is all to me."</p><br>

  <p>They had reached the bottom of a little slope, up which the path wound, to
  divide at the top into a fork.</p>

  <p>It was thickly grown with ash and beech trees that cast a gloomy shade,
  and in the midst of them was a well green with moss and fern.</p>

  <p>The cavalcade paused, uncertain which path to take.</p>

  <p>"Freda's well," said the Frankish bishop. "Surely we will dedicate it to
  some holy saint."</p>

  <p>The well was circular; fern and grass that the dripping water had kept
  fresh grew around it; behind, through the silvery trunks of the beeches,
  glowed the rose hues of a cloudless sunset.</p>

  <p>Valerian took off his helmet, hanging it to his saddle bow; and the breeze
  that blew from the west lifted the heavy hair from his forehead.</p>

  <p>Slowly they rode up the slope with a jingle of bells and a glimmer of
  brilliant color darkly visible.</p>

  <p>Valerian, a little ahead, suddenly stopped, a noble figure all the dark
  horse against the smooth beech trunks.</p>

  <p>He said nothing, but gazed in front of him, leaning forward a little, his
  throat and face in profile above the rich armor.</p>

  <p>The monks paused too.</p>

  <p>Something was moving in the deep shadows of the well.</p>

  <p>The hanging ferns and grasses were stirred and rustled; a white arm,
  dripping crystal drops, held back the wet green, and a woman appeared among
  the fern.</p>

  <p>They saw her but dimly, for the rosy light of the sunset did not touch the
  deep beech shadows. She stood a second, utterly still, with that outflung arm
  holding back the ferns. There was naught on her slender body save a yellow
  shift; nothing to hide her but the shadow and the drooping bracken.</p>

  <p>"Freda!" said Valerian. "Freda!"</p>

  <p>At the sound of his voice she looked towards him, and drew away.</p>

  <p>A little shudder ran through the monks. The figure made no attempt to move
  or speak; pale as ivory she gleamed in the dusk.</p>

  <p>Only Augustine rode calmly to his brother's side.</p>

  <p>"Speak to the woman," he commanded. "Rid her begone, certainly, and put no
  tricks upon us."</p>

  <p>"It is the goddess, verily," answered Valerian, breathlessly. "Lo, she
  moves!"</p>

  <p>"Certainly a false goddess," frowned Augustine. He raised his clear
  voice:</p>

  <p>"Witch, devil, begone in the name of the Holy Virgin!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke he raised the cross he wore.</p>

  <p>She took no heed: only she made a shivering motion, and pulled the boughs
  about her.</p>

  <p>"She understandeth not not Latin," said Augustine, and he called to the
  Frank, who rode up swiftly.</p>

  <p>"Fiend or woman," said he in Saxon, "profane not the ground where holy men
  must tread. Delusion of the devil, begone!"</p>

  <p>She gave a moaning little cry, and smote her hands upon her bosom.</p>

  <p>"Thor! Thor!" she cried, and ran swiftly from the shadow.</p>

  <p>For a second the rosy glow shone on white limbs and yellow hair, then she
  was gone into the thick darknesses of the trees.</p>

  <p>Augustine's lip curled.</p>

  <p>"So the false gods go, surely;" he said. "Let us press onwards to
  Canterbury hastily."</p>

  <p>But as the company was proceeding down the wider path, Valerian spake.</p>

  <p>"I will come presently. Lo! have I not come to convert! Certainly I will
  covert the pagan goddess."</p>

  <p>A little he laughed.</p>

  <p>"Pleased she me mightily."</p>

  <p>"Therefore," said Augustine, sternly, "thou wilt follow her in mere
  profanity?"</p>

  <p>"Therefore will I follow her to bring her to the true faith, certainly,"
  Valerian answered. "Or if she be a fiend, bring I her to Canterbury on my
  saddle," and he turned and made his way warily into the thicknesses of the
  trees.</p>

  <p>The stout yellow bracken caught his horse's hoofs and stayed his progress;
  the path he followed narrowed and twisted; in his ears were the sound of
  whispering leaves innumerable and the echo of his brother's angry voice.</p>

  <p>"Now, by St. Honor," he said, "back will not I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, the wood fell away before him to right and left, as if the
  trees made a sudden passage, and he found himself at the top of a hill ending
  so suddenly it seemed the edge of the world that touched the western
  sky&mdash;the burning, blushing sky, fading stains of gold and red, like
  molten jewels, spilt blood and wine that shone before him.</p>

  <p>Straight up against this stood the woman, on the very summit and edge of
  the hill, with the dipping valley at her feet.</p>

  <p>The yellow shift, blowing, showed her bare feet; across her throat waved
  little strands of yellow hair; she looked towards the sunset as if she
  prayed.</p>

  <p>"Freda!" said Valerian, gently.</p>

  <p>She turned, saw man and horse dark against the wood, and fled through the
  forest.</p>

  <p>Horse and man plunged heavily after her, but ways were open to her that
  were closed to them; she sprang with great lightness through the bushes, and
  Valerian, with the boughs in his face and catching at his sleeves, lost sight
  of her.</p>

  <p>He laughed, and, reining his horse, turned the way he had come through the
  wood.</p><br>

  <p class="poem">"What need have I of heaven<br>
  (Sins that are seven),<br>
  When the sun shines gold through the leaves of the vine,<br>
  and thou art mine&mdash;and thou art mine!"</p><br>

  <p>The dew was falling; he felt it on his face as he looked up at the first
  stars glittering through the leaves; it was neither day nor night, but a
  marvellous time of twilight. Idly he rode on, his reins falling slack, and in
  his brain memories of the day slipped together: the line of white above the
  blue sea that was the shore of Kent, the ride through those first woods, so
  different from his woods at Ravenna, the little hut in the clearing, with the
  smoke arising in the still way of autumn, the man with the beautiful osier
  baskets behind the fallen log, and the child with her red pitcher clasped to
  her breast.</p>

  <p>He found himself by the well again, and rode round it slowly, picturing
  the white arm that he had seen divide the fern.</p>

  <p>His horse stumbled over something; a heap on the ground. As he leant from
  the saddle he saw embroideries gleam duskily.</p>

  <p>Swiftly he dismounted; a woman's clothes lay at his feet&mdash;a rich
  robe, a red mantle, and leather sandals among the fallen beechnuts.</p>

  <p>Freda's garb! He lifted them from the dead leaves and put them over his
  saddle. They were heavy with gold fringes and beads; he handled them
  curiously; then knotted the reins to a beech bough, and waited for her to
  come for her garments. The moon rose, turning the grayness into silver.
  Valerian seated himself by the edge of the well, crushing the soft damp
  ferns; he trailed his hand in the water; it was cold as snowflakes. Holding
  on to the rim, he gazed down into the blackness of the well depths, forming
  visions of a woman rising, floating upwards, with the water weeds on her
  breast, till she touched the surface, and the water broke in ripples from her
  face as she emerged, holding up dripping arms, glittering in the light of the
  rising moon.</p>

  <p>A light sound behind him made him look up sharply from the well.</p>

  <p>She was close to him, standing by the beech tree; she shivered
  cruelly.</p>

  <p>For a moment they gazed at each other; then she held out her hands.</p>

  <p>"Give me my garments," she said, mournfully. "Am cold."</p>

  <p>He made no answer; the moonlight striking through the trees showed his
  Byzantine beauty and cast his shadow dark behind him.</p>

  <p>The woman came a little nearer.</p>

  <p>"Am afraid," she said. "Give me my garments."</p>

  <p>She shuddered under the thin linen of her shift, and looked around timidly
  for her attire.</p>

  <p>"Thou art human, certainly," answered Valerian, marking her shivering.</p>

  <p>"St. Honor! but I thought ye one of the gods of Britain, verily. Lo! I am
  a Christian knight, and bear unto pagans a dislike, mightily."</p>

  <p>"Am cold," she repeated; she came still closer. "Art terrible to look
  upon." Curiosity came into her voice. "Hast a sword and great
  weapons&mdash;art Thor or a daemon?"</p>

  <p>She lifted her long yellow hair from her eyes to gaze at him; the
  moonlight lay over her as she bent closer.</p>

  <p>Valerian made the sign of the cross over his glittering breastplate.</p>

  <p>"I loathe thy false gods bitterly&mdash;there is but one Lord, and Him
  serve I faithfully."</p>

  <p>Blue eyes gazed into black eyes across the moonlight and the shadows of
  the fern; hers were troubled. She put out her hand and touched his where it
  lay on his breast.</p>

  <p>"Am cold&mdash;cold," she said, sadly. "Feel my fingers."</p>

  <p>Valerian frowned.</p>

  <p>"Thou art a witch," he said, "and thy power lieth in thy garments
  certainly. Lo! I come to do war on such as thee&mdash;even I."</p>

  <p>"Am no witch." She drew back against the beech trunk. "Art cruel." She
  eyed him in a troubled manner as he leant forward with a clink of armor from
  his seat on the well.</p>

  <p>"I will convert thee, hastily,"&mdash;he laughed a little. "Thou shalt
  become Christian presently, Listen unto me."</p>

  <p>"Am no witch," she repeated.</p>

  <p>"Yet a follower of false gods," said Valerian.</p>

  <p>"My gods are true," she answered. "Give me my garments."</p>

  <p>"But ye shall hear me, verily."</p>

  <p>She drew herself up, and her hands clenched.</p>

  <p>"Greatly I hate ye," she said through her teeth.</p>

  <p>"What is thy name?" asked Valerian.</p>

  <p>She stood rigid, erect, staring down at her bare feet on their carpet of
  dead leaves.</p>

  <p>"Nay, tell me; we will give thee another. Augustine shall baptize thee
  holily."</p>

  <p>Her hands went up to her face; she fell to crying softly; she slipped down
  on to the beech mast in a curled up position of distress.</p>

  <p>"Am cold," she murmured, through faint little sobs. "Am weary&mdash;am
  hurt&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She glanced piteously at her foot.</p>

  <p>"Am afraid of the wolves."</p>

  <p>She turned her face against the beech trunk and wept unrestrainedly in a
  quiet manner.</p>

  <p>Valerian rose and brought her garments from his saddle to lay them beside
  her.</p>

  <p>"Thy garb," he said.</p>

  <p>She glanced round timidly; then, seeing her dress beside her, smiled.</p>

  <p>He stood looking at her as she arrayed herself in silence with a shudder
  of content. When she had clasped her hood under her chin and put on her
  mantle there was little of her to be seen for the heavy loose draperies that
  fell around her.</p>

  <p>Gravely he picked up her sandals and offered them.</p>

  <p>She looked at her foot.</p>

  <p>"Am hurt," she said. She seated herself on one of the spreading beech
  roots, and showed him that her foot was cut across the instep.</p>

  <p>"It paineth me," she complained, and the tears welled into her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Ye are a coward," smiled Valerian.</p>

  <p>She fell anew to sobbing, with a piteous look at the injured foot.</p>

  <p>"I will tie it up for ye, certainly," said Valerian. "Yet I do not think
  it hurteth mightily." He turned back his velvet sleeve and tore off a strip
  of the linen underneath; she followed this with a curiosity that stifled her
  sobs. By this the moon had risen high, and the well was distinct in silver
  light. Valerian dipped his bandage in the beautiful water and brought it to
  her.</p>

  <p>She watched with interest and satisfaction while he bound the wound up,
  kneeling before her.</p>

  <p>When he had finished he delicately laced the embroidered sandals over her
  slender feet.</p>

  <p>She said nothing till he rose and turned away; then she cried out:</p>

  <p>"Am afraid of the wolves&mdash;ah! am <i>bitterly</i> afraid."</p>

  <p>He looked back at her. She smiled. "Wilt stay?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Valerian reseated himself by the edge of the well.</p>

  <p>"Ye are a coward, certainly," he said. "Yet had I no thought of going. Did
  I not leave the others to find ye, that I might convert ye, even I?"</p>

  <p>She frowned at that; great self-confldence had come with the wearing of
  the mantle and gown.</p>

  <p>"Didst follow me?" she said. "Wherefore?"</p>

  <p>He fingered the long fern fronds beside him. "To find if ye were fiend
  truthfully. To bring ye with me to Canterbury; and because ye are fair,
  mightily."</p>

  <p>She drew herself together in her heavy draperies.</p>

  <p>"Shalt not take me to Canterbury," she said, wildly. "Wilt not
  come&mdash;hate thy God&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He gazed at her in terror and anger, and his brows lifted with wonder.</p>

  <p>"Who art thou?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Hate thee," she answered, vehemently.</p>

  <p>He rose.</p>

  <p>"Thou art fierce, certainly," he said, "and I must even leave thy soul to
  damnation and thy body to the wolves."</p>

  <p>At that and the sight of him untying the reins from the beech boughs her
  courage fell; she wavered between terror and anger; then:</p>

  <p>"Am <i>bitterly</i> afraid of wolves," she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Will ye come with me to Canterbury?" he asked.</p>

  <p>For answer she beckoned him to her side, and when he came heavily over the
  dead leaves, she caught his hand between hers, and gazed up at him with
  frightened eyes.</p>

  <p>"Am Osberga of Kent," she said in a hurried whisper. "Am the King's
  daughter. Lo! he will be Christian; he sent over the sea for Christian
  priests, but I&mdash;I love the old gods&mdash;they are very gracious to
  me&mdash;will be true to them&mdash;so am fled here&mdash;will to my mother's
  sister in Mercia."</p>

  <p>Panting, she ceased, and her little hands clasped in an eager manner over
  his.</p>

  <p>A flush crept into Valerian's smooth face.</p>

  <p>"I am of the Christians," he said. "Thou shalt return to the King."</p>

  <p>"No! no!" she implored. "Would go to Mercia."</p>

  <p>The moonshine was over her very wonderfully. It caused her bare throat to
  gleam like ivory. Valerian, the Byzantine knight, laughed, and drew her to
  the well, and made her sit beside him there, with the waving shadows of the
  ferns over her dress.</p>

  <p>She came without resistance, gazing at him the while with wide blue
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"The old gods are dead," he said, holding her slackly by the arm. "The
  saints rule in heaven now. Listen. I come from Ravenna, which is a Christian
  town. Canterbury will be a Christian town."</p>

  <p>"Therefore have I left it," interrupted Osberga of Kent.</p>

  <p>"Ye shall not avoid the true faith; Britain will be a Christian land."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Thor will prevent it."</p>

  <p>"Have I not said the old gods are dead, certainly!"</p>

  <p>She smiled scornfully.</p>

  <p>"No," she said. "They neither die nor sleep. The Queen hath a chapel to
  thy God, and she hath won the King to listen, and the old gods will be
  wrathful&mdash;and I go to Mercia."</p>

  <p>Leaning forward, he still held her arm and looked down into her upturned
  face.</p>

  <p>"Go ye to Mercia alone?"</p>

  <p>Osberga of Kent shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Ethelfrid, who is King of Mercia, is coming for me; last year he came to
  Kent&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Valerian interrupted her, frowning.</p>

  <p>"This King is late," he said.</p>

  <p>"Have lost my way," she said, mournfully. "Shouldst be waiting by the
  river. Lo! he will be there, and I cannot discover the way."</p>

  <p>At the thought of it she began weeping softly again.</p>

  <p>Valerian frowned more, and gazed at the tracery of the fern fronds in the
  moonlight.</p>

  <p>"'Tis best, verily," he said, "that ye should not meet this pagan."</p>

  <p>"Is brave," she whispered through her sobs. "Is a great man&mdash;is King
  of Mercia. I sent to him to take me away when the new God came; lo! he sent a
  churl back, and said on this day he would wait by the river." Her sobs
  ceased; she looked at Valerian in an anxious manner. "Think ye they will come
  after me before I find the river?"</p>

  <p>He answered gravely:</p>

  <p>"I think that I should take ye back presently. This man is a pagan,
  certainly."</p>

  <p>"Will not take me," she frowned. "Hate Canterbury. Often do I come here to
  bathe in Freda's well&mdash;(it maketh ye fair)&mdash;often do I come here as
  the sun sets to be rid of Canterbury. Will not go back."</p>

  <p>"I might make ye," said Valerian, quietly.</p>

  <p>She looked at him. There was a breathless pause; then he spoke again.</p>

  <p>"I might put ye on my saddle and take ye back to Canterbury with me. To
  save your soul, certainly."</p>

  <p>Osberga put her hand over her heart.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;am afraid," she said, piteously. "Am afraid&mdash;and Ethelfrid
  is not here. If ye choose to take me&mdash;" She stopped, gazing with
  frightened eyes.</p>

  <p>Valerian sprang up impetuously, and his face was flushed.</p>

  <p>"St. Honor, no!" he said in an unsteady voice. "Ye shall keep tryst
  faithfully&mdash;ye shall go with the pagan King. Wherefore should I stop ye?
  To each man his gods."</p>

  <p>And he laughed to think what Augustine the prior would have said.</p>

  <p>Osberga of Kent gave a little panting breath of relief. "Will stay till
  the morning?" she asked. "Cannot find the river in the dark&mdash;maybe
  Ethelfrid will come for me."</p>

  <p>He turned, and seated himself slowly in his old place, his mantle all
  about him on the mossgrown earth, the moonshine on his dark Roman face. He
  looked at her curiously, and his fingers played with the gold chain that hung
  on his breast.</p>

  <p>She smiled sweetly on him.</p>

  <p>"Art kind," she said. "Ethelfrid will thank thee."</p>

  <p>"Need I no pagan's gratitude, certainly," he answered.</p>

  <p>There was silence as they sat opposite each other with the trees and the
  silence about them; then Osberga spoke, yawning.</p>

  <p>"Am sleepy," she said. "Am tired."</p>

  <p>Her blue eyes were half shut; her head drooped.</p>

  <p>"Ye can sleep fearlessly," he answered. "By St. Honor, I will not leave
  ye!"</p>

  <p>She gave a sleepy smile.</p>

  <p>"The earth is hard," she murmured. She shifted her position on the well
  edge and gazed into the black water. "It looks fearful, yet it is not deep.
  When I stand in it, it cometh only to my neck; yet I would not fall in."</p>

  <p>Her voice fell in a tired fashion, her head drooped.</p>

  <p>"Am <i>very</i> sleepy," she announced.</p>

  <p>Moved by a sudden impulse when he saw her weary, drooping, and desolate
  against the cold earth and dripping ferns, stirred by tenderness and he knew
  not what feeling of pity, Valerian leant forward and held out his arms.</p>

  <p>She looked at him sleepily from the shadow of her hood; he touched her and
  drew her very gently towards him.</p>

  <p>To his wonder and extraordinary pleasure she came willingly, and lay with
  a sigh of content on the folds of the soft mantle that fell over his
  armor.</p>

  <p>Her eyes closed, and her breathing became faintly regular. Warm and
  flushed and soft she lay, curled in her heavy draperies in the curve of his
  arm, with her head against his breast. Her yellow hair fell from her hood
  over his knee; she was sleeping very peacefully.</p>

  <p>Valerian put his mantle round his shoulders and held her loosely up to
  him.</p>

  <p>Now and then in her sleep she gave a little sound of ease and content, and
  her face was like a child's; in her lap her fingers lay curled slackly and
  rosy; under the rich dress her bosom rose and fell steadily.</p>

  <p>Valerian, holding her in his arms, gazed out over her drooping head at the
  moonlit forest, and thought of his saints at Ravenna and the pagan King
  waiting at the river.</p>

  <p>So still they were that a little troop of deer passing out of the beeches
  came fearlessly to his very feet, and sniffed his shining greaves and her
  trailing gown before they passed on lightly into the forest.</p>

  <p>Valerian's thoughts flew wide, circled the world and the world's goods,
  judged and appraised the worth of things, and came back to the wonder of the
  moonlit forest and the sleeping woman in his arms.</p>

  <p>Slowly, wonderfully, the moon died and the day rustled through the trees.
  Light that was very pale and luminous slipped through the beech trunks; the
  birds commenced singing in a clear manner. Osberga of Kent stirred and
  sighed; he drew her closer to his heart, praying she might not wake yet, for
  surely it was sweet to enfold her helpless sleep. Her head had fallen back on
  his shoulder; as the day dawned he saw her face more clearly, her parted
  lips, her golden brows, the yellow hair falling apart over her white
  forehead.</p>

  <p>His horse made an impatient movement, shaking his trappings, and there was
  a sudden sound of branches broken and thrust aside.</p>

  <p>Valerian looked up calmly.</p>

  <p>A horseman crashed down the bracken and drew up a few paces from the
  well.</p>

  <p>The pale dawn showed him a mighty man. He was helmeted, and carried his
  shield on his arm; both his mantle and his horse were ivory white, and even
  in that dimness his hair shone golden.</p>

  <p>In utter silence he gazed at the two beside the well.</p>

  <p>"Thou art Ethelfrid of Mercia, certainly," said Valerian.</p>

  <p>The horseman started to hear his tongue and name from the lips of this
  splendid stranger.</p>

  <p>"Am Bretwalda of Mercia," he answered. "Am Ethelfrid." He touched his
  horse, and came slowly closer; his eyes flashed fiercely, in a wonderful
  rage: he pointed to the woman in the Roman's arms.</p>

  <p>"Osberga of Kent?" he asked, and his bare arm shook, showing the silver
  snake that bound it glimmering unsteadily.</p>

  <p>"Truly," said Valerian, "Osberga of Kent. I am Valerian of Ravenna, and a
  Christian knight."</p>

  <p>The Bretwalda of Mercia put his hand to his sword.</p>

  <p>"Wherefore sleepeth she in thine arms?" he asked, grimly.</p>

  <p>Valerian smiled.</p>

  <p>"Truly she was weary with seeking for thee; honors she me greatly. Lo! she
  sleeps as a child, peacefully." Gently he disengaged his arm from about her,
  and she fell slackly against him, drooping into the folds of his mantle.</p>

  <p>The Bretwalda said naught, but, erect on his huge horse, gazed at them
  with burning blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"I have guarded her faithfully," said Valerian, "and kept her for ye, when
  I might have carried her to Canterbury&mdash;to the Christians. St. Honor
  pardon me&mdash;but to each his gods."</p>

  <p>He laughed softly, looking down upon her, and the sun, brightening, smote
  his gorgeous armor into points of light.</p>

  <p>"Art a strange man," said Ethelfrid. "Hast a kingly look." He leant from
  the saddle, and stared into Valerian's face. "She trusted ye?"</p>

  <p>The "Roman smiled proudly.</p>

  <p>"Ye see, Ethelfrid of Mercia."</p>

  <p>The Bretwalda glanced at the sleeping woman.</p>

  <p>She stirred, and flung her hand out among the ferns.</p>

  <p>"Osberga!" cried Ethelfrid.</p>

  <p>She sat up, flushed, suddenly awake, and held out her arms.</p>

  <p>"Ethelfrid!"</p>

  <p>With the golden glow of the dawn over her, she rose and laughed.</p>

  <p>The magnificent Bretwalda wheeled his horse round so that he was alongside
  her.</p>

  <p>"Osberga," he said, "get up before thy father's people come."</p>

  <p>Valerian rose, standing beside the edge of the well.</p>

  <p>"Shall I not lift her up?" he smiled. "Have I not kept her for thee?"</p>

  <p>Lightly he raised her and put her into Ethelfrid's arms; so was she swung
  on to the white horse.</p>

  <p>"Hast been good to me," said Osberga, clinging to the ivory mantle. "Is
  Christian lording, yet took me not back to the new God."</p>

  <p>The Bretwalda's blue eyes looked steadily, curiously, at the stranger, and
  Valerian's glance was calm to meet his scrutiny.</p>

  <p>"Tied up my foot," said Osberga. "Was gentle to me."</p>

  <p>Still the two men gazed at each other. No word of thanks said Ethelfrid;
  but suddenly he turned the woman round and held her away from him.</p>

  <p>"Kiss her," he said.</p>

  <p>Valerian, standing beside the well, was not on a level with her face and
  hanging hair; smiling, she put back her hood, leaning down; the dawn was
  flaming through the trees and glittering in the water of the well.</p>

  <p>Valerian of Ravenna, suddenly pale, kissed her coldly on the brow.</p>

  <p>The Bretwalda caught her proudly up to him, lifted his glittering shield
  in salute, and was gone at a gallop down the forest glade.</p>

  <p>Valerian watched the white horse flash between the tree trunks, then
  mounted his own steed and turned its head toward Canterbury.</p>

  <p>Cloudless and beautiful the morning was about him, yet he felt his arms
  empty and his spirit weary. He noticed coldly the wonders of the forest, the
  begony with its flaming berries, the last dandelions and daisies, the amber
  hues of the oak, the scarlet of the beech; then he looked curiously at his
  torn sleeves. A robin sang loudly; then presently a merle. Valerian of
  Ravenna rode steadily with his helmet clanking at his saddle, and he smiled
  to himself, playing with the chain at his breast.</p>

  <p>Thus to Canterbury, in the glory of the fair morning.</p><br>

  <p class="poem">"What hope have I of heaven,<br>

     id="story2"></a>II. &mdash; THE APPLE OF VENUS</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Harper's Magazine</i>, February 1909</h3>

  <h3>THE APPLE</h3>

  <p class="first">THE long alley of chestnut trees leading to the château was
  barred with light and shade; the great green leaves were all atremble in the
  warm air, and in the thick grass the daisies lay wide open to the sun.</p>

  <p>The clock of the distant village struck four as Mademoiselle Sophie came
  slowly on between the sun-flecked trunks, holding up her pink skirt from her
  reluctant feet. She was frowning, and her full red lips pouted a little in a
  manner not unbecoming to her sleepy beauty; her long brown eyes, her thick
  rich auburn hair, her clear skin, flushed from the sun, were noticeable
  points in a sumptuous appearance. She gave the impression of something
  golden, soft, and sullen as she came across the bright silent park land.</p>

  <p>Her dress was of something that shimmered in pink silks; where the tight
  bodice was cut away over her white bosom she had pinned a peony of flaring
  scarlet; her hands were locked behind her, and now and then she tossed her
  head impatiently as the ends of her shining curls were blown in her face.</p>

  <p>Walking so, slowly, she came to the confines of the park; here an old and
  sunken wall of brick divided it from open meadow-land that dipped slowly to
  the hollow where the village lay. The sun glittered on the distant vane on
  the church spire and shone golden in broad fields of grain and rich orchards.
  Sophie, with no regard to this slumbrous prospect before her, climbed the low
  wall and descended the slope of grass beyond.</p>

  <p>At the bottom of this slope a little wood was to be entered by a path
  crossed by a wooden stile; leaning against this stile a man in faded
  vermilion velvet stood in a very intent attitude, absolutely motionless, his
  head turned from Sophie's advance. She, as soon as she saw him, slackened her
  pace, and paused altogether at length to gaze at him in a slow,
  half-resentful manner.</p>

  <p>The flaming foliage of the bramble and the soft green leaves of the hazel
  trees overhanging the stile cast waving shadows over him, but the sun falling
  through the shifting branches dazzled in his rare bright brown hair.</p>

  <p>Sophie carne forward with a sudden movement, the tall meadowsweet dragging
  at the hem of her gown, and the man at the stile turned and raised a
  clear-cut English face, half pleasantly scornful and wholly alluring.</p>

  <p>"You have frightened them away," he smiled, and he indicated two pheasants
  that flashed into the undergrowth at her approach.</p>

  <p>Sophie frowned, disdaining a reply.</p>

  <p>"You are always late," he said, easily.</p>

  <p>She came up to the post of the stile and rested her round white arms on
  it.</p>

  <p>"Do you think I have nothing else to do but keep time to the minute with
  you?" she asked. "Do you imagine my thoughts are so full of you, Paulyn?" And
  as she spoke she knew that it had taken a fierce effort of her will to delay
  her coming, and that, so much had she wished to be soon, she had dragged out
  the weary time, and with difficulty, that she might be late.</p>

  <p>Paulyn, Lord Frere, answered with a deepening of his smile.</p>

  <p>"I, you see, have nothing better to do," he said, "and so I am here to
  time&mdash;always."</p>

  <p>The reply, given lightly, as a compliment, stung her; she did not care
  that he should avow so carelessly his liking for her company.</p>

  <p>"I wonder why I come at all?" she said, heavily.</p>

  <p>He moved from the stile, and leaning against the tree trunk, looked at her
  curiously. His clothes, though they had been splendid once, were much worn
  and faded, the tinsel braid on his coat was tarnished, and the cravat knotted
  round his throat of fine but torn lace; he looked what he was&mdash;an
  adventurer of birth and parts, with attraction of daredevilry, youth, and
  breed to weigh against his obvious poverty.</p>

  <p>"You know why you come, Sophie," he answered her. "The old house is
  dull."</p>

  <p>Her anger rose at his unconcerned pleasantness; she pulled at the velvet
  leaves of the hazel and tore them mercilessly in her strong white
  fingers.</p>

  <p>"Not so dull," she said, with a flashing look under her heavy brows, "as
  you, perchance, may think. Another of your cold nation has come to
  Luneville."</p>

  <p>"My cold nation!" he laughed. "Now what made you say that?"</p>

  <p>She ignored the question.</p>

  <p>"Sir Gilbert Fraser is my father's guest," she continued. "He is a fine
  gentleman."</p>

  <p>"Fifty," said Lord Frere, "and old for that. I know him."</p>

  <p>Sophie tossed her head.</p>

  <p>"Not so old, m'sieu," she answered; "there are some would say wealth were
  better than youth&mdash;since it can be shared&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lord Frere smiled.</p>

  <p>"You would remind me, my dear, that it is owing to the difference between
  poverty and wealth that he is honored at the château&mdash;while your
  acquaintance with me is clandestine, and your father would not receive a
  ruined prodigal. Still"&mdash;he lifted slowly his gray eyes&mdash;"you leave
  the château for the hedge-row, do you not?"</p>

  <p>She scattered the torn fragments of hazel leaf to the wind.</p>

  <p>"What do you know of Sir Gilbert?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He laughed, as if amused at the seriousness of her question.</p>

  <p>"I knew him in England, my dear,&mdash;he is a worthy gentleman. He would
  make you a good husband."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Sophie. "Though he is fifty, and old for that?"</p>

  <p>Lord Frere suddenly sighed.</p>

  <p>"Ah, my dear, he is rich, as you have said, and you are not fitted for a
  poor man's wife&mdash;as I have recognized."</p>

  <p>Sophie moved a little farther away among the sun-flecked foliage.</p>

  <p>"I do not understand you," she said, while in her heart she understood
  only too well&mdash;he did not care as she cared; bitterly she wondered if
  men ever did care as women did. She pulled at a fading leaf beside her. "It
  is autumn," she said, with a faint laugh. "Summer is over, and you must ride
  away!"</p>

  <p>"It has been a pleasant season," said Lord Frere, softly. "You have been
  very gracious to a vagabond."</p>

  <p>The yellow leaf fluttered from her fingers.</p>

  <p>"You are going?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I think that you are tired of me," he said. "Yes, Sophie&mdash;as you
  have said, the summer is over." He came up to the stile and rested against
  it. Words choked in her throat; her hands lay over the peony at her
  breast.</p>

  <p>"If I had been rich, now," sighed Lord Frere, "it had been different."</p>

  <p>She was standing half with her back to him, and he could not see the slow
  color mount into her face, nor how the peony rose and fell over her
  heart.</p>

  <p>"Well?" she said, unsteadily, without looking at him. "How different,
  m'sieu?"</p>

  <p>He lifted his eyebrows and glanced away from her down the cool green glade
  of the little wood; an expression of rather whimsical melancholy rested on
  his handsome face; he broke off one of the tall late buttercups growing by
  the post and twisted it in his fingers.</p>

  <p>"Ah, different!" he said, absently.</p>

  <p>A hot sideway glance of hers discovered his indifferent bearing. Was he a
  coward, or did he not understand?&mdash;Was it possible he did not
  understand? She sought desperately for words which should enlighten him, but
  the precious minutes flew past and she was silent.</p>

  <p>A bird whirred out of the covert near, and Lord Frere's sleepy gray eyes
  were following it as it flitted down the woodland sun-flecked path. Sophie
  spoke&mdash;not as she wished to speak, still with some attempt to get within
  his guard.</p>

  <p>"You are a spendthrift at heart," she said. "And what do you care for
  money? If one offered you a fortune to-morrow, you would hardly lift your
  hand to take it."</p>

  <p>"You read me well," he said, never looking round at her; "over-well,
  perhaps. This friend of yours, Sir Gilbert Fraser, offered me a fortune
  yesteryear that I refused."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she cried, and the blood rushed into her face.</p>

  <p>"He collects curiosities, does he not?" Lord Frere glanced at her over his
  shoulder. "I had something left from the ruin of my fortunes that he wished
  to buy."</p>

  <p>"And you would not sell it?"</p>

  <p>"Not for anything he or any man could offer&mdash;for some foolish reason
  I value it greatly."</p>

  <p>Sophie felt a giddiness in her head. So he did not value what a fortune
  could have bought&mdash;would buy now&mdash;her family's toleration&mdash;the
  position of her equal.</p>

  <p>"So," she said, in a voice as quiet as she could make it, "you have it
  still&mdash;this thing!"</p>

  <p>Lord Frere twirled the buttercup between his white teeth.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I have it." He put his hand into his vest pocket. "With me now
  and always."</p>

  <p>She answered; her eyes sparkled brilliantly.</p>

  <p>"You are mad to carry it there&mdash;worth a fortune! You will be robbed
  or murdered for your folly!"</p>

  <p>"Why, I can protect it," he said, easily, as he held out a little carved
  wood case on the palm of his fine hand.</p>

  <p>She would not touch it: her rival, the thing he "valued greatly"&mdash;she
  drew back with instinctive hatred of what the little box contained. He gave
  her a quick, sharp glance, then unfastened the case.</p>

  <p>It contained an apple of pure gold, perfectly modelled, with two curling
  jade leaves set against the stalk. Lord Frere took it out and touched a
  little spring; the apple flew open in four quarters against the leaves, and
  disclosed a diamond as large as a lady's nail and beautifully cut.</p>

  <p>"An ancestress of mine," said Lord Frere, "was judged the most beautiful
  woman in England, and her husband had this made for her&mdash;she wore it, I
  think, at her girdle. It was a pretty conceit."</p>

  <p>"What is it to you?" asked Sophie, under her breath, "Would not the money
  buy what you would value more than this toy?"</p>

  <p>He answered:</p>

  <p>"I know of nothing,"&mdash;and it seemed to her as if he had struck her
  insolently in the face.</p>

  <p>She could not trust herself to speak, while he, all unconscious, showed
  her how the four quarters were carved inside with the likenesses of the four
  most beautiful women the world has known&mdash;Helen of Troy, Cleopatra,
  Queen Guinevere, and Lucretia Borgia.</p>

  <p>"And she had red-gold hair&mdash;as you have," he said, pointing to this
  last.</p>

  <p>The remark came to her with the shock of revelation.</p>

  <p>"Do you think of me&mdash;of women&mdash;as&mdash;well, like that?" she
  asked, in a curious, breathless way. "As&mdash;such colored hair&mdash;such a
  shaped face&mdash;hands so made&mdash;" She half held out her own, then
  laughed. "<i>Mon Dieu</i>&mdash;you do not understand!"</p>

  <p>"Why, no," he answered; his clear gray eyes were on her questioningly.</p>

  <p>"It is not worth while," she flashed. "And now I think&mdash;it is
  over-late&mdash;I must return."</p>

  <p>She came up to the stile and leaned a little towards him; the sunlight
  shimmered on her satin bodice and showed most wonderfully the glittering
  threads of her hair.</p>

  <p>"It shall not come again," she said.</p>

  <p>Lord Frere closed the golden apple and returned it to his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Why?" he asked. "You are tired of your amusement?"</p>

  <p>Through the perfect golden green silence following on his speech, the
  church in the village below them struck, and the clear echo of the little
  bell seemed to hover a long while in the sweet air; Sophie moved with slow
  fingers a lock of hair back from her face.</p>

  <p>"Keep your toy well, my lord," she smiled.</p>

  <p>"You think I am a fool to keep it," he answered her. "Well, I shall never
  part with it&mdash;unless&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She took him up quickly.</p>

  <p>"Unless?"</p>

  <p>"God wot, I might come to starve!" he laughed.</p>

  <p>She drew away from the stile.</p>

  <p>"Then you can sell that jewel to Sir Gilbert," she said, and her eyes
  narrowed. "Now&mdash;good-by, Paulyn."</p>

  <p>She held out her hand.</p>

  <p>"You mean it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She answered quietly:</p>

  <p>"We go to Paris in two days&mdash;and you," she smiled slowly&mdash;"you
  will be tired of our quiet village."</p>

  <p>"Is this the end of our wayside acquaintance?" he laughed. "And you take
  leave of me&mdash;like this!"</p>

  <p>"I will come again to-morrow," said Sophie. "To say good-by,
  Paulyn,&mdash;but now they are expecting me at the château."</p>

  <p>Their hands met and clasped lightly above the heads of the tall buttercups
  and parsley flowers; then she gathered up her dress and turned away.</p>

  <p>"Until to-morrow," said Lord Frere, and smiled at her carelessly.</p>

  <p>She gave one glance at the slim figure in the faded scarlet and passed on
  her way. Her face was curiously pale and hardened; she walked very slowly and
  steadily towards the château, and paused now and then to shake the fragments
  of leaves and grass off the edge of her long gown.</p>

  <p>On entering the great house she went straight to the library, where she
  found her father's guest over his books.</p>

  <p>He looked up as her gracious youth came into the room, and the warm color
  of her opulent beauty was jewel-like against the sombre background. Sir
  Gilbert rose from his place.</p>

  <p>Without a word Sophie passed him, took the peony from her breast and set
  it in the dragon-painted vase on the mantel-shelf; then she turned.</p>

  <p>"It is yes, after all, Sir Gilbert," she said, quietly. "I will be your
  wife."</p><br>

  <h3>VENUS</h3>

  <p class="first">THE ruddy, steady glow of a fire that had burned to a great
  golden heart shone on the blue and purple of a Japanese vase that stood on a
  slim table by Sir Gilbert's chair and gave a slight color to his worn,
  bloodless face. By the tall window stood his wife, gazing out on Soho Square,
  growing dim in the waning English afternoon.</p>

  <p>Sir Gilbert looked thoughtfully at her beautiful figure and the fine line
  of her bare throat and averted face.</p>

  <p>"Will you come here, Sophie?" he said at last.</p>

  <p>She turned at once and moved across the room in her usual slow manner; as
  she came into the glow of the fire the bright green of her gown, the
  carnation of her face, the glitter of her hair, and the white jewels at her
  throat showed as notable things.</p>

  <p>"You wanted me?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Sir Gilbert rose and unlocked the glass front of a black lacquer cabinet
  that stood against the wall; while, with slow, careful movements, he sought
  for something in its dark recesses, she watched him without interest.</p>

  <p>After a while he found what he looked for and held it out to her.</p>

  <p>"I wish you to wear this to-night," he said.</p>

  <p>It was a little box that lay on his hand; she knew it and what it
  contained.</p>

  <p>"What whim is this?" she asked, quietly.</p>

  <p>"No whim at all." He unlocked the box and took out a gold apple with jade
  leaves. "You remember that I bought this two years ago, when you were in
  France?"</p>

  <p>"I remember," said Sophie. She picked up a drawn-silk hand-screen and held
  it up before her face.</p>

  <p>Sir Gilbert laughed dryly.</p>

  <p>"The man who sold it to me came today to buy it back."</p>

  <p>"Ah?" The rose-silk screen fluttered a little in her hand.</p>

  <p>"He is coming to-night to dine with us," continued her husband. "I think
  he will amuse you."</p>

  <p>"Amuse me?" The hand-screen was quite still now.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;he is interesting." Sir Gilbert was fixing the apple to a long,
  fine gold chain. "He was most stormy when I refused to sell this to him, but
  we parted good friends. He is Earl of Clare now, through a distant cousin's
  death, and, for the time at least, a swinging fortune. A scoundrel, of
  course."</p>

  <p>"Why do you have him here?" asked Sophie. "Do you think scoundrels amuse
  me?"</p>

  <p>"He is charming, too&mdash;I can read him very easily; he has set his
  heart on this." He touched the apple lightly. "He intends by any means to get
  it. I dare say"&mdash;again he laughed dryly&mdash;"he has thieved in his
  time."</p>

  <p>His wife laid down the screen; for all the glow of the firelight, she was,
  had her husband eyes to notice, curiously pale for her.</p>

  <p>"So you want me to wear it?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Hidden in your dress." He handed it to her.</p>

  <p>She put the chain round her white neck and slipped the apple into the
  bosom of her gown.</p>

  <p>"So?" she said, rather faintly; she felt a cold touch against her heart,
  and for a moment it was as if he had passed her again, after all these
  years.</p>

  <p>"So." Sir Gilbert nodded, well pleased. "I shall puzzle him as to where I
  keep it, shall I not?"</p>

  <p>"He is coming to discover that?" asked Sophie.</p>

  <p>"I think so&mdash;ostensibly, of course, to see my collection: it will be
  a duel of wits."</p>

  <p>She moved back into the warm shadows of the room.</p>

  <p>"Why should he value it so highly?" she questioned; then suddenly, "You
  make him out a common thief, and yet let him come here!"</p>

  <p>"He is amusing," repeated Sir Gilbert, "an attractive vagabond."</p>

  <p>Sophie laughed, quite unreasonably scornful, it seemed to her husband.</p>

  <p>"You have said you found it dull," he remarked.</p>

  <p>Her fingers curled round the fine chain that held the apple.</p>

  <p>"You offer a strange diversion."</p>

  <p>Sir Gilbert answered sharply:</p>

  <p>"Say I please myself, then, madam. I like the fellow."</p>

  <p>She came to the fire and seated herself in one of the deep leathern
  chairs.</p>

  <p>"It is no matter, either way&mdash;to me."</p>

  <p>In this attitude, that was neither attention nor indifference, but like
  lifeless movement, sitting forward, motionless, with her head half turned to
  the door, and the firelight ruddy on her averted cheek, she sat long after
  her husband had left the room, and though the wood on the hearth was sinking
  into ashes she did not notice it.</p>

  <p>She heard a carriage drive up without, and never moved; she heard
  footsteps on the stairs, and never moved.</p>

  <p>Then, when the door opened, she rose suddenly, and her hands closing on
  the hand-screen, snapped the fragile stick. It was the servant with the
  candles.</p>

  <p>With an impulse of daring and defiance she took the one set on the table
  near the Japanese vase and placed it on the mantel-shelf, so that the light
  fell on her face, and when he entered with Sir Gilbert she was standing so
  with her head erect. In the seconds that her husband used in introducing them
  her eyes flashed courageously over him.</p>

  <p>Five years ago!</p>

  <p>She had imagined many things; she had not been prepared for this: he was
  ostentatiously splendid, magnificently dressed, and the richness of his
  appointments suited his reckless face; he was as attractive now, standing
  within her door in his perfumed velvets, as her straying thoughts during
  these years had ever pictured him in his faded scarlet coat.</p>

  <p>He accepted her presence, her position, with the calm she knew he would
  show; in the instant that she dared look into his dangerous eyes he showed
  her that their last meeting was as vivid in his mind as in hers. But had Sir
  Gilbert been as keen on the track of their secret as he was unconscious of
  it, he could have guessed nothing from the Earl's demeanor.</p>

  <p>He said very little to Sophie;·while her husband displayed the treasures
  with which the room was filled he leaned against the table, facing the fire,
  and his attention was all for the connoisseur and his collection.</p>

  <p>Sophie pushed the candle away from her now and sat back in her chair
  watching. She saw her husband moving to and fro among his cabinets; the table
  laden with gold and silver ware that glittered in the candelight: ancient
  chasubles with rough-set gems, carved ivory coffers, and strange-shaped
  ornaments of rock crystal; and it was all but a dim background to the figure
  of the Earl.</p>

  <p>He was in black and white velvet, with a great knot of pink ribbons on his
  shoulder; his profile was towards her, and she noticed a hunch of violets
  fastened in his Bruges-lace cravat. He talked and laughed with Sir Gilbert;
  he was entertaining, charming, flattering; he used that subtlest of incense,
  envy, and Sophie observed that despite his cool summing up, her husband was
  fascinated and enthralled.</p>

  <p>She had lived very quietly since her marriage; how quietly she had not
  realized till now. As she sat in the shadow looking at the Earl she was aware
  that her life had stopped with his passing out of it, and that the long even
  years with Sir Gilbert had been filled with merely mechanical actions and
  aimless thoughts; now, like a tide dammed and suddenly set free, her blood
  flowed passionately. She knew that her husband was old and dull, that her
  days had been as dust; she knew what she had missed, and she looked with
  narrowed brown eyes at the careless figure of the man who had cheated her of
  it.</p>

  <p>His brilliant presence had altered the sombre house as it had altered the
  quiet woods round her home; she could see Sir Gilbert was under the spell of
  the graces being so freely used for his captivation, although he had named
  the Earl&mdash;scoundrel.</p>

  <p>Sophie put her fingers to the fine chain crossing her bosom: it was
  curious to remember the day when they had stood either side of the stile with
  tall buttercups between and the jewel now hidden over her heart had flashed
  in his open hand.</p>

  <p>He never mentioned the apple; if he was observant of every detail that
  might discover to him its hiding-place, he gave no sign of it; careless and
  gay, absolutely at his ease, he appeared to have no motive beyond the
  moment.</p>

  <p>At dinner, Sophie, seated between him and her husband, was so near him
  that their sleeves brushed when they moved; still, he spoke very little to
  her, and looked at her hardly at all. As she listened to his interested
  converse with Sir Gilbert she wondered if she had read aright that first
  glance of his&mdash;if, after all, he had not completely forgotten! It was
  likely enough: what had not these five years, so uneventful to her, been to
  him?</p>

  <p>She colored hotly to think of it. Sir Gilbert remarked on her silence; he
  was secretly a little piqued that his beautiful wife had made so little
  impression on the Earl, though the latter's willing attention to his learned
  talk on his precious collection might be some recompense.</p>

  <p>To Sophie the evening was intolerable; her blood stirred with a strange,
  unnameable excitement. When they returned to the upstairs room, where Sir
  Gilbert's curios still glittered on the table, she escaped to the balcony and
  stood silent there, looking over the dark square and the winking lights of
  the town.</p>

  <p>She could hear the voices of the two, so different in quality, modulated
  to the same tone; looking round sharply once, she saw her husband bending
  over one of his cabinets, and the Earl seated by the fire in the chair she
  had just left. She could only see his back; his attitude was that of some one
  writing,&mdash;the next instant he had risen, turned, and was coming towards
  her.</p>

  <p>"You have dropped your fan, my lady."</p>

  <p>He stood in the shadow of the window; the light from within caught his
  white sleeve as he held out her painted fan.</p>

  <p>She had left it, purposely, on the chair; without a demur, however, she
  took it, and the Earl, bowing, returned to Sir Gilbert, who was opening upon
  the gilt settee a portfolio.</p>

  <p>Sophie stood perfectly still, gazing with unseeing eyes across the
  darkness. He had written something on her fan. She felt as though some one
  gripped her heart and held it so that she could not breathe. So&mdash;he was
  playing with her husband! What did he want with her&mdash;what did he dare to
  want with her?</p>

  <p>She moved so that some of the light fell over her, and unfurled her fan;
  yellow butterflies were painted on it, and they seemed to dance before her
  eyes like live things; then she read, in clear pencilling's beneath them, his
  message:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"Venus wears the apple to-night&mdash;both are mine by
  right&mdash;I have been without both too long. I have so much to ask, to
  answer. After I leave tonight I shall return to your garden and wait for you.
  <span class="smcap">Paulyn</span>."</p><br>

  <p>Sophie closed her fan slowly; her desire was to laugh madly; this was
  characteristic of him: when he could have had her for the asking,&mdash;yes,
  it was the naked truth, for the asking,&mdash;he rode away, and now she was
  another man's wife, he would risk a great deal to whistle her back. She was
  to steal his jewel for him, and he put this on her fan!&mdash;his old
  recklessness&mdash;his old insolence.</p>

  <p>Hardly a glance did she give him when he took his leave, but an hour later
  she was waiting at the end of the dark garden, with a cloak over her bright
  dress.</p>

  <p>The moon was out, and the stars, but their fire was quenched behind a soft
  veil of mist; the whole sky was dull and gray. The garden was not finely kept
  nor filled with blooms, but by the plane trees and the old stone seat at the
  wall grew a quantity of half-wild wallflowers, and their perfume was sweet
  and strong.</p>

  <p>Sophie sat on the stone seat and twisted a spray in her fingers; the
  garden here was lit, in a gloomy flickering fashion, by the swinging
  street-lamp on the house opposite the wall.</p>

  <p>The miserable thin moon cleared the dark chimney-tops and swam into the
  pallid sky with a trail of wet vapor after her. Sophie heard the steps of a
  passerby echoing down the empty streets; the wallflowers fell from her hands
  on to the lap of her silk dress.</p>

  <p>As the footsteps died away, another, bolder and firmer, sounded, coming
  nearer, and she could hear him singing, in a soft, reckless voice.</p>

  <p>She rose and waited.</p>

  <p>He knocked on the little wooden door in the garden wall.</p>

  <p>"He is very sure I am here," she thought, and opened the door quietly.</p>

  <p>He entered with a wholly delightful, half-hushed laugh; he wore a dark
  velvet riding-mantle, and swung his hat in his hand.</p>

  <p>Sophie closed the door and went back to the seat; he followed her,
  eagerness on his lips.</p>

  <p>"Now&mdash;forget five years&mdash;my dear!" He took her passive hand and
  held it warmly. "First, why did you never come the last time&mdash;as as you
  promised?"</p>

  <p>"You speak of too long ago," she answered,&mdash;" yet&mdash;you are much
  the same."</p>

  <p>"To you always."</p>

  <p>"I did not mean that." She had withdrawn her hand from his and closed it
  over the sprig of flowers in her lap. "I mean that you were reckless and
  careless in the way you behaved to-night&mdash;and&mdash;very certain."</p>

  <p>He laughed in his old assured manner.</p>

  <p>"Of what?" He had seated himself at the end of the seat and was leaning
  towards her; she could half see his face in the shadow of his dark hair.
  "Sophie&mdash;are you not glad that I have come?"</p>

  <p>"Do you think that I have been waiting for you all these years?" she
  answered; her blood was running quick at the manner in which he took it for
  granted that she should come at his first bidding, the manner in which he
  accepted, without either surprise or thanks, her compliance with his
  monstrous request, but there was little to be told from her quiet voice,
  little to be seen from her shrouded figure.</p>

  <p>"Sophie," said the Earl, leaning closer, "I have often wondered why you
  never came to say farewell as you promised me. Sometimes I thought that I
  knew&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She laid the wallflower to her lips.</p>

  <p>"Why will you talk of five years ago? What have you come to say to me
  now?"</p>

  <p>"I think that you know."</p>

  <p>She could hear his quick breathing. Surely he was a little moved.</p>

  <p>"Listen to me, Lord Clare. You went out of my life utterly. I only heard
  of you once&mdash;when my husband told me he had bought this toy from you."
  She touched her bosom and saw his eyes flash. "I never thought to see you
  again until to-night&mdash;now, what can you imagine are my feelings towards
  you&mdash;now, what do you mean to say?"</p>

  <p>Her hand rested on her knee; he laid his very gently over it.</p>

  <p>"You care something or you had never remembered you ever cared more; you
  cared something or you had not come tonight. You belong, Sophie, to me, and I
  am here to claim you."</p>

  <p>Her fingers trembled under his.</p>

  <p>"Me&mdash;or your jewel?"</p>

  <p>"Both&mdash;mine, both! The dotard sought to outwit me; he thought I
  should not guess where he had concealed the jewel; he thought that it would
  be impossible for me to steal it from such a hiding-place."</p>

  <p>She stopped him swiftly,</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;he thought so."</p>

  <p>The Earl laughed at the recollection of the successful part he had played
  that evening.</p>

  <p>"You have graced this dusty dwelling long enough, my dear."</p>

  <p>Sophie rose suddenly; the perfume of the wallflowers was strong as wine to
  make her senses&mdash;reel.</p>

  <p>"You woo me late," she said, thickly.</p>

  <p>"Before, I was a poor man." His voice came through the cross-shadows; she
  could see the dark outline of his figure against the flickering lamplight
  cast across the wall; she put out her hand and touched the smooth bark of the
  plane tree.</p>

  <p>"Why did you sell&mdash;this?" Again she touched her bosom.</p>

  <p>She felt he reined in eagerness as he answered.</p>

  <p>"I was starving."</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;what could not go for love went for bread!" She laughed. "And
  now&mdash;you have come to ask me to steal it for you, have you not&mdash;to
  give it to you?"</p>

  <p>"No." He rose from his seat. "I want you, yourself&mdash;Venus as well as
  the apple, my dear."</p>

  <p>She was breathing painfully.</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;you would suggest I go with you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;you think I will?"</p>

  <p>"By God! I think so."</p>

  <p>Her fingers had closed over the chain across her bosom; she saw how he
  watched this.</p>

  <p>"What else am I to steal from Sir Gilbert for you?" she asked; she moved
  away from him, but he leaned forward and caught at her glittering dress where
  the cloak fell aside.</p>

  <p>"Are we to palter here until the old man sees us? Sophie, I am tired of
  England. Come with me back to France."</p>

  <p>She was drawn against the wall now, crushed in among the wallflowers.</p>

  <p>"Hush! they will hear us in the street! Stand away from me, my lord. You
  do not understand&mdash;nothing could make you understand!"</p>

  <p>At the tone in her voice he instinctively stepped back, and she moved past
  him, with the dull light flickering on her figure.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that there is nothing I value more than your late-flung
  favor!" she said, quietly. "If I were a free woman I would not trust myself
  to such as you&mdash;no! Stand away from me!" She flung out her hand and
  struck him lightly on the breast. "Once I amused you&mdash;to me it was
  something more; for five years you were silent; now&mdash;things are
  different; I came here to-night to tell you so." Her voice came in pants.
  "You think me a dull fool,"&mdash;she pulled at the chain round her neck.
  "Once I might&mdash;have followed you&mdash;anywhere; now&mdash;good
  night&mdash;oh, I can say it easily&mdash;farewell!"</p>

  <p>"Sophie!"</p>

  <p>He seized her hands, but she dragged them away.</p>

  <p>"Here is what you came for&mdash;this that have round my neck."</p>

  <p>She tossed the chain at his feet. He sprang after her, but she ran down
  the dark length of the garden rapidly, and he heard her close and bolt the
  window.</p>

  <p>At that Lord Clare went back to the plane and the wallflowers. At his feet
  the chain glittered in a tiny heap. What he had come
  for&mdash;yes&mdash;perhaps.</p>

  <p>Yet Sophie&mdash;so suddenly unattainable&mdash;was provokingly alluring,
  unfathomable, and surprising. He gathered the jewel into his pocket without
  looking at it and stepped into the street. His swift vanity was
  reassured.</p>

  <p>"After all, the jade cares," he thought, "or why did she give me
  this?"</p>

  <p>He smiled, and leaning against the street post, leisurely drew it from his
  pocket. Sir Gilbert's jewel was a good guarantee of Sir Gilbert's wife.</p>

  <p>The yellow lamplight and the cloudy radiance of the moon shone on the
  chain as he ran it over his fingers, looking for the familiar glitter of the
  golden apple:</p>

  <p>But in place of it hung a little gilded skull.</p>

  <p>Lord Clare felt the blood run to his heart with a hateful sense of
  shock.</p>

  <p>"By gad! <i>does</i> the jade care!" he said. Then he laughed curiously
  and, with her mocking gift hanging over his fingers, looked up at her dark
  house.</p>

  <p>"And do I care to have missed the apple&mdash;or to have
  missed&mdash;Venus?"</p>

  <h2><a name="story3"
     id="story3"></a>III. &mdash; DORINDA DARES</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Harper's Magazine</i>, July 1909</h3>

  <p class="first">THE black marble clock pointed slender gold hands at a
  quarter to one, gave an expectant whir, paused the fraction of a second, then
  struck delicate chimes that echoed pleasantly in the large quiet room.</p>

  <p>Beyond the tall windows, where the dark silk curtains hung carelessly,
  half looped back, the silent night showed; the chamber was handsome, sombre,
  and lit only by branched candlesticks placed either side the mantel-shelf;
  these were reflected in a stately and ghostly fashion in the large mirror,
  wreathed with dull gold, that rose behind them to the ceiling, which was by
  Thornhill, indistinguishable now for the shadows. The walls were of crimson
  and gilt-stamped leather, hung here and there with gloomy portraits; the
  furniture splendid and heavy. A steady fire burned on the hearth and
  flickered in the polished front of a Chinese cabinet, which was in use as a
  desk and scattered with papers. A gentleman sat before it with a pen in his
  hand, But he was not writing. Reflectively he bit the end of the quill and
  gazed down at the floor beside him. He wore a light-colored travelling-coat,
  and on the corner of the chair hung his hat. Presently he rose and, still
  with the pen in his hand, crossed to the fireplace. He looked at himself in
  the mirror&mdash;not, it seemed, with any intent; absently merely.</p>

  <p>The door was opened; he turned expectantly, with the air of one weary of
  waiting. It was his servant who entered.</p>

  <p>"A lady is below who wishes to see your lordship."</p>

  <p>The gentleman frowned in a puzzled manner. "A lady&mdash;any one you
  know?"</p>

  <p>"I have never seen her before, my lord!"</p>

  <p>He considered a moment. "And no sign of Peter&mdash;no message?"</p>

  <p>"None, sir."</p>

  <p>"He is plaguy slow. She, this lady, does she come from him?"</p>

  <p>"I do not think so, my lord."</p>

  <p>My lord glanced at the clock and smiled a little. "One of the Jack's
  spies, perhaps&mdash;it's inconvenient and&mdash;late. Tell her she had
  better reconsider her request, Saunders."</p>

  <p>"I tried to get her to go before I troubled your lordship," answered the
  servant, "but she was so earnest, I did not know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You knew," the gentleman interrupted, "that I was not expecting her. I
  should not be here if Peter hadn't been so tardy, and in that case you would
  have had to get rid of her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She is so persistent, my lord..."</p>

  <p>His master took a pipe from the mantel-shelf and knocked out the
  ashes.</p>

  <p>"Saunders, you flatter me&mdash;is she pretty and young?"</p>

  <p>"Both, my lord, and well dressed&mdash;she came in her own coach, which
  waits for her at the gate."</p>

  <p>My lord smiled again and raised his fair eyebrows. "Does she know what
  time it is?"</p>

  <p>"I told her."</p>

  <p>"And she...?"</p>

  <p>"She said she must see you, my lord, if it was one in the morning or
  four."</p>

  <p>His lordship gave a sideway look at himself in the mirror.</p>

  <p>"Bring her up, Saunders."</p>

  <p>The servant was leaving.</p>

  <p>"And, hark ye, if any message comes, bring it me; and if Peter arrives,
  keep 'em quiet until I ring the bell."</p>

  <p>He had lit his pipe now and was smoking; he stood leaning carelessly
  against the mantelpiece, with his back half turned to the door; the mellow
  light of candles and fire showed his handsome, cynical face, and gleamed in
  the rolled curls of his singularly smooth, fine, light-brown hair; where his
  roquelaure fell apart the white satin of a ball dress showed, and a sapphire
  sparkled in the long lace at his throat.</p>

  <p>He heard some one enter, and slowly turned. The door closed, and a lady
  advanced into the room. She was masked. My lord, with an elbow resting by the
  marble clock and his pipe in his mouth, did not move.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Incognita," he said, and stared at her.</p>

  <p>She paused by the Chinese cabinet; as she did not answer, he spoke
  again.</p>

  <p>"You unmasked to the servant, madam&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She interrupted, with a clearer voice and a firmer accent than he had
  expected. "Because I thought his report on my features might help to obtain
  an audience of you, sir."</p>

  <p>"Well," he smiled, insolently, "let us see if he spoke the
  truth&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Instantly she took off the mask and came a little nearer.</p>

  <p>She was tall and fair&mdash;very fair; her eyes were light gray, shaded
  darkly; her mouth very sweet; she wore a bronze-colored dress and a
  light-green silk mantle; she looked at him steadily and fearlessly.</p>

  <p>"In the name of God!" he cried, suddenly, after gazing at her a space,
  "what brought you here?"</p>

  <p>There was no answer to that, nor any change in her judicial gaze. He laid
  down his pipe and offered her, with an almost imperceptible alteration of
  manner, a chair. She swept into a high-backed Spanish seat with a graceful
  outspreading of silks.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Lord Bolingbroke," she said, gravely.</p>

  <p>He slightly, very slightly, flushed. "Am I to guess, madam, your name and
  business?"</p>

  <p>"I am," she answered, "coming to that."</p>

  <p>She sat lightly and proudly, her mask in her right hand, her head high,
  the long curls of her powdered hair trembling on her bosom. She continued to
  look intently at my lord, as if this scrutiny had been the object of her
  coming.</p>

  <p>The marble clock struck one. He commented on it. "The hour is unusual,
  madam."</p>

  <p>"The matter on which I come is unusual, sir."</p>

  <p>He smiled. "It appears to be to excite my curiosity."</p>

  <p>"It is more serious, my lord, than that."</p>

  <p>"I do not know your name, Incognita," he reminded her.</p>

  <p>Her eyes were defiant. "It would not enlighten you, Lord Bolingbroke."</p>

  <p>Her pretty foot, showing beneath her dress, impatiently tapped the carpet.
  He observed it admiringly, and let her see he did, at which the glittering
  shoe disappeared. He laughed, but she colored and held her head still
  higher.</p>

  <p>"There is no mystery about me, my lord; I am Dorinda Desborough, sister to
  Captain Charles Desborough who died at Malplaquet, and daughter of Major
  Desborough, now in Ireland."</p>

  <p>She said this as if she claimed kinship with princes, and her eyes
  sparkled gloriously.</p>

  <p>"A Hanoverian," remarked Lord Bolingbroke, lightly; "then you have not
  come here for a political reason?"</p>

  <p>"A matter of politics," answered Miss Desborough, "could have waited until
  the morning."</p>

  <p>"This is an affair of greater importance, then&mdash;" his continued smile
  was scarcely this side of insolence. "Now I can think of nothing of more
  consequence than politics, Miss Desborough, unless it be love."</p>

  <p>"But I know of many things," she replied, gravely, "and what I come about
  does not touch love."</p>

  <p>He stirred the logs with the toe of his riding-boot, and looked at her the
  while.</p>

  <p>"Why, I hardly flattered myself, madam; in truth, I did not"&mdash;he
  thrust his hands into his pockets and laughed&mdash;"and you must give me
  credit for that, considering the circumstances; it proves, Miss Desborough,
  that I am not very vain."</p>

  <p>She answered, pale and cold: "Every word you say, Lord Bolingbroke, proves
  you to be what I have always known you were; but I have not come here
  to&mdash;to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She faltered, and he smilingly finished the sentence.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;to discuss my morals? Well, I believe they were ruled out of
  polite conversation, as known at the boarding-schools, some time ago." His
  blue eyes were mocking. "It would be interesting to know what you have heard
  of me."</p>

  <p>Her fingers closed tightly over the mask. "I must get to what I came to
  say," she said, hurriedly.</p>

  <p>"Faith, 'tis no occasion for haste," he assured her. "I, at least, am
  enjoying myself&mdash;green becomes you vastly, Miss Desborough."</p>

  <p>His bold yet careless glance revealed an admiration he did not consider it
  worth while to conceal; her bosom heaved.</p>

  <p>"I heard one thing about Lord Bolingbroke," she said, "that now I see is
  false; it was said his fine manners were as certain as&mdash;as some other
  qualities of his."</p>

  <p>He seemed amused. "The present occasion is hardly one for
  ceremony"&mdash;he looked at her under his full lids&mdash;"do you think
  so?"</p>

  <p>"I am not asking for ceremony, but respect," answered Miss Desborough. "I
  wish you would mend the tone in which you speak to me, my lord; it is not
  very creditable."</p>

  <p>Lord Bolingbroke did not alter his smiling stare. "I am not very famous
  for creditable things, madam."</p>

  <p>The color came into her face; she moved her hand as if she swept his
  remark aside. "You were at the Queensbury ball to-night," she said.</p>

  <p>"So much I can admit, seeing all London knows it," smiled my lord.</p>

  <p>"I, also, was there."</p>

  <p>"No need to inform me," he lied, courteously. "I, of course, observed
  you."</p>

  <p>"I think," she said, "you did not, for I was watching you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are vastly complimentary, Miss Desborough."</p>

  <p>"I wanted," she continued, "to speak to you; but"&mdash;she averted her
  eyes angrily and put her hand to her heart; her charming profile against the
  background of shadows was admired by my lord&mdash;"I may tell you at once,
  sir, that I am Miss Kitty Kynaston's cousin."</p>

  <p>Nothing in his easy demeanor betrayed whether the name meant anything to
  him or no. "A young lady I am acquainted with," he said. "She, also, was at
  the Queensbury ball&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Miss Desborough faced him again. "Where is she now?"</p>

  <p>Lord Bolingbroke eyed her steadily.</p>

  <p>"I wonder?" he said, with a slight drawl.</p>

  <p>"You know!" His accuser panted a little.</p>

  <p>He raised his eyebrows. "I know?" he answered. "Well, I suppose the ball
  is over now and she has gone home to Westminster; she is in her room; perhaps
  she is looking at her glove and thinking of its fellow; perhaps she is taking
  off her shoes and stockings&mdash;think of sweet Kitty taking off her shoes
  and stockings!"</p>

  <p>Miss Desborough rose. "Sir," she said, "Miss Kynaston is in this
  house."</p>

  <p>Lord Bolingbroke moved from the hearth. "You flatter me," he answered,
  looking at her intently, "for, I think, the second time."</p>

  <p>"She is here," repeated the lady, "and I have come to take her back."</p>

  <p>"That is the reason for your coming?"</p>

  <p>"That is my reason; Miss Kynaston must return home&mdash;before anyone has
  missed her." As she spoke she crushed her velvet mask together in her hands
  and drew herself to her full straining height.</p>

  <p>"Again I say," smiled the Viscount, "that you flatter me in supposing Miss
  Kynaston is here...I wonder what makes you imagine she might be?" he added,
  carelessly.</p>

  <p>"I do not imagine, my lord, I know; my cousin is somewhere in this
  house."</p>

  <p>He returned to the hearth and rested his elbow on the mantelpiece. "Only
  one lady honors my mansion to-night, madam&mdash;yourself."</p>

  <p>She moved a step farther into the shadows of the room. "That I do not
  believe."</p>

  <p>The candle-light, full on his alluring face, showed the lazy smile that
  touched his lips. "I give you my word, Miss Desborough."</p>

  <p>Her gray eyes flashed mightily. "The word of Harry St. John, sir, is not a
  thing to be trusted."</p>

  <p>Again my lord slightly, very slightly, flushed. "You allow me no virtues,
  madam."</p>

  <p>She trembled, with anger perhaps.</p>

  <p>"Your lordship allows yourself none." She moved toward him again. "Look at
  me, sir, and dare tell me there is any reason why I should take your
  word&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He laughed. "You seem bent on insulting me, Miss Desborough."</p>

  <p>"I knew," she answered, "that you would lie to me; I was not so foolish as
  to think you would tell me the truth."</p>

  <p>The satin glittered under the roquelaure as he lifted his shoulders. "The
  truth, after all, is a tiresome thing."</p>

  <p>"Your lordship has often found it so."</p>

  <p>He changed from his careless position and faced her. "On my honor, Mis
  Kynaston is not here." Their eyes met steadily.</p>

  <p>"Your honor is as little to me as your word, sir. I came, not to hear your
  protestations, but to take away my cousin Kitty."</p>

  <p>His mouth hardened. "Your cousin Kitty"&mdash;he almost imperceptibly
  imitated her inflection of the words&mdash;"would be grateful to you for your
  care, but I cannot think she would wish to have her name used like this."</p>

  <p>"Her name!" cried Miss Desborough. "Her name! It is you to talk of her
  name, when, unless she comes home tonight, she will not have a shred of
  reputation left nor be able to hold up her head again! I am here to save her
  name."</p>

  <p>"I repeat, she is not here."</p>

  <p>"And I repeat, sir, that I know she is."</p>

  <p>"Prove it," said Lord Bolingbroke.</p>

  <p>She colored at his tone, but her eyes were dauntless. "You have been
  paying court to Kitty since the winter."</p>

  <p>"Her mother," he said, with the shadow of a sneer, "had no objection to my
  visits."</p>

  <p>Miss Desborough blazed with disdain. "Aunt Kynaston met you at the Dean's
  house, and you called on her because of Kitty. We are not people in your set,
  and you had no reason to pursue the acquaintance, except Kitty."</p>

  <p>"A pretty reason, though."</p>

  <p>"She has no father or brothers, and Mrs. Kynaston is not very
  worldly&mdash;which made it unfair on my cousin."</p>

  <p>"And pleasant," he smiled, "for me."</p>

  <p>"Kitty, too, is sometimes foolish," continued Miss Desborough, "and so she
  let you write her notes, and answered them secretly. She told me of this a
  few days ago when I came to stay with them&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And you scolded her&mdash;poor Kitty!"</p>

  <p>Miss Desborough held on to the back of the chair. "Do not imagine I am
  telling you Kitty is fond of you. Would it be likely"&mdash;her voice was
  scornful&mdash;"with so many younger men adoring her? But she was flattered
  because you are Lord Bolingbroke."</p>

  <p>He looked at her sharply, and laughed. "Do the ladies already consider me
  old?"</p>

  <p>"Kitty is only twenty, my lord. I suppose you do not seem very young to
  her. Captain Eric Bellamy is twenty-three; she must, I suppose, make
  comparisons. They are very fond of each other, really, and she is not to
  spoil it by her folly. I, sir, have resolved on that."</p>

  <p>Lord Bolingbroke, thirty-five, and the most popular man in London, hardly
  knew what to make of this clear verdict&mdash;old!&mdash;even to twenty; he
  had never considered that. "Under these circumstances," he said, "it seems
  you should have sought out the favored gallant, Miss Desborough; it is
  strange to seek your cousin in the house of a gentleman you say she is so
  indifferent to."</p>

  <p>Miss Desborough flashed over him quite wonderfully brilliant eyes. "I
  admit," she conceded, "that you are her Majesty's Minister, and that you have
  a&mdash;reputation; also that Kitty is silly and has just quarrelled with
  Captain Bellamy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"About me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"About you, Lord Bolingbroke. Captain Bellamy did not care for her to
  attend the Queensbury ball because you procured the invitation, and as he
  became imperious, she, of course, got vastly angered. He demanded of her that
  she should never see you again."</p>

  <p>"What did he say?" queried my lord, lazily.</p>

  <p>"He said," flashed Miss Desborough; then she checked herself. "You are a
  powerful man, sir; it is not fair to Captain Bellamy to repeat what he
  said."</p>

  <p>"You leave me," said the Viscount, "to infer&mdash;Well, madam, is that
  the sole proof you have that I ran away with Miss Kynaston?"</p>

  <p>She sank again into the chair. "Indeed no. I saw this morning something
  was wrong with Kitty&mdash;then Aunt Kynaston could not come to the ball with
  us, being sick, and we went under the protection of a lady who did not look
  after Kitty&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lord Bolingbroke seemed considerably amused. "You condemn me on very
  oblique evidence."</p>

  <p>She clenched her hands in her lap; impatience flushed her cheek. "I mark
  Kitty; I see her agitated&mdash;she loses her glove (I think you have it); in
  the middle of the ball she disappears; I search for her; I find our friend,
  who says Kitty has taken leave of her with a tedious headache and gone home
  in the chariot with a maid; I find our chariot still at the door; I drive
  home desperately; Aunt Kynaston is in bed, Kitty not there; I pretend to the
  servant I am going to join her at supper at Queensbury house and have but
  returned to see if my aunt is well; then I mount the chariot again and come
  here&mdash;this is my evidence, my lord. What do you say to it?"</p>

  <p>She paused, breathless and accusing; her cloak had slipped back and showed
  crushed lace and faded violets on her bosom; Lord Bolingbroke had seldom been
  gazed at by such fearless eyes.</p>

  <p>"This," he answered, "that you had better have sent Captain Bellamy on
  such an errand."</p>

  <p>"You think it strange of me to have come?"</p>

  <p>"It puts us both," he smiled, "into an awkward position."</p>

  <p>She did not lower her eyes. "Captain Bellamy would not understand," she
  said; "there was no one but myself could come, because no one but myself must
  know Kitty was here to-night."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said Lord Bolingbroke&mdash;again he lightly imitated her
  slight accent&mdash;"I do not seem very young to you; you must, I suppose,
  make comparisons, and you felt tolerably safe in visiting such an ancient
  beau as myself."</p>

  <p>"I was not thinking of you at all," she answered, hastily&mdash;"only of
  Kitty...As to myself," she smiled, "I come of a different world from my
  cousin; my father and all my friends would understand why I came here. You,
  my lord, flung boarding-school miss at me; I was never that. I had been a
  man, I should have become a soldier. I have journeyed all over Europe and
  never been afraid of anything except a coward, and I did not think your
  lordship that...Now I have told you everything, give Kitty back to me!" She
  rose. "Please, Lord Bolingbroke&mdash;I have been here long enough."</p>

  <p>He looked at her calmly. "Miss Kynaston is not here."</p>

  <p>She surveyed him keenly. The effect of the soft light, the satin, and
  powder was to make him look less than his years; though had she seen him in
  broad daylight she would probably have set him down as older than he was; his
  extreme good looks were but an aggravation of his insolence.</p>

  <p>"You lie!" she said, hotly. "I know it..."</p>

  <p>"But you cannot prove it," mocked Lord Bolingbroke.</p>

  <p>She considered; he was prepared for her ringing for the servants and
  demanding to be shown over the house, but she did not move from where she
  stood.</p>

  <p>"Kitty must be here; she left the ball before I did, and I have been home
  since. Lord Bolingbroke, if we are not back by three our absence will be
  marked."</p>

  <p>"Then you had better leave, madam."</p>

  <p>"Not without Kitty."</p>

  <p>"Since I play chorus&mdash;again, she is not here."</p>

  <p>"Why," demanded Miss Desborough, "does your lordship wear riding-boots and
  a roquelaure?"</p>

  <p>He bowed to her. "Because before I was diverted by your charming company I
  had intended leaving for my place in Kent to-night."</p>

  <p>"And not alone..."</p>

  <p>"With my servants&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"With Kitty."</p>

  <p>He laughed. "I am not so far honored."</p>

  <p>She moved a quick step, the mellow candle-light full on her fairness; she
  put her hand to her brow in a bewildered way, and the green silk cloak
  slipped from her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You have resolved to be cruel, my lord," she said, faintly; then she
  dropped her hand. "I vow I feel quite faint."</p>

  <p>Lord Bolingbroke was picking up her cloak; he paused with it in his hand,
  interested by the sudden change in her manner. "The avenging angel is
  discovered to be human," he said&mdash;"or does Nemesis suffer from the
  vapors?"</p>

  <p>She turned to face him. "My salts are in the pocket of the mantle. Will
  you put it round me, my lord?"</p>

  <p>The Viscount smiled. As he came up to her she seemed to droop; then, as
  his eyes were very intent on her face, she snatched something from the pocket
  of his white coat and sprang to the other end of the room.</p>

  <p>"Kitty's glove!" she cried, with no sign of faintness now, but a face set
  and dauntless.</p>

  <p>"Damnation!" said Lord Bolingbroke, and flushed beneath his powder.</p>

  <p>"You should, my lord," flashed Miss Desborough, "have put it farther in
  your pocket; I observed it as you moved." She unrolled the long mauve silk
  glove and discovered a crumpled piece of paper.</p>

  <p>"That letter, madam," remarked my lord, "is mine."</p>

  <p>She read it aloud: "'Yes&mdash;I will meet your man at twelve o'clock in
  the shrubbery&mdash;it is best we be not missed together, as you say, but do
  not be long after me, Harry, or I shall faint in the coach. With haste, with
  fears, with love, Your distracted Kitty.'"</p>

  <p>My lord shrugged his shoulders. "I think you take a liberty, Miss
  Desborough."</p>

  <p>She tore the note into a hundred pieces. "What now for the word of Harry
  St. John?" she cried, triumphant.</p>

  <p>"You cannot think less of it than you did, madam," he answered, his eyes
  rather dark and a color in his face; "and what of the obvious inclination of
  Miss Kynaston!"</p>

  <p>He flung her cloak over the chair and clasped his hands behind him, a
  trick of his on the rare occasions when he was nonplussed or roused.</p>

  <p>"What of the mouse in the trap!" she retorted, scornful. "I think he had
  some inclination for the bait that got him there."</p>

  <p>"Maybe, madam, also, I think it was not easy to get him out." He glanced
  at the clock, that was on the verge of striking the half-hour. "May I remind
  you that your coachman will wonder at your absence?"</p>

  <p>"He?" she laughed. "He was a soldier; he knows why I am here, and will not
  wonder; I do not fear that my father's men will ever fail me&mdash;but
  Kitty..."</p>

  <p>He interrupted her. "You dare a great deal, Miss Desborough; perhaps a
  little too much. I think you interfere unwarrantably in your cousin's
  affairs; believe me, she will hardly thank you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not now, perhaps, but afterward&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We, Miss Desborough, are dealing with the present...afterward you and
  your fire-eating relations may take their revenge on me."</p>

  <p>"What is the use of revenge?" she answered; "I am thinking of Kitty."</p>

  <p>"So am I," said Lord Bolingbroke.</p>

  <p>"She is in this house, and I will not leave it until I find her."</p>

  <p>"You Irish!" laughed my lord. "Would you like to call the servants up and
  question them, bring in the watch and search the house?"</p>

  <p>Her fair countenance was contemptuous. "She is going back with
  me&mdash;quietly."</p>

  <p>"Madam, believe me, if Miss Kynaston was in the room now she would refuse
  to accompany you."</p>

  <p>"Ah, you think she dotes on you!" cried Miss Desborough.</p>

  <p>"I think," he answered, "that you contradict yourself&mdash;you vow the
  lady is here, on the point of eloping with me, and you deny that she holds me
  in the least regard."</p>

  <p>"I never denied that she was foolish as&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"&mdash;as I am wicked?" he finished.</p>

  <p>"That was not what I intended to say, my lord."</p>

  <p>He looked at her with a smiling curiosity. "Indeed, I have marked your
  strange absence of reproaches. I cannot accuse you of railing, Miss
  Desborough."</p>

  <p>"One does not reproach an enemy," she said, and she also smiled. "One
  defeats him&mdash;if one can."</p>

  <p>"The reservation shows some wit, madam. Does it not also show that you
  have faint hopes of victory?"</p>

  <p>Her hand stole over the violets on her breast. "Lord Bolingbroke," she
  said, and the gravity, almost tenderness, of eyes and voice swept away his
  careless mockery as a thing of no meaning, "you will give me a
  chance&mdash;as if it was another man. At heart I am a gentleman; treat me as
  one to-night." She came a step nearer to him. "It is not worth while, Lord
  Bolingbroke, it is nothing to you&mdash;a great deal to Kitty, to her mother,
  to Captain Bellamy...to me. I have said once I know you are not a
  coward&mdash;it is only a coward who is too proud to say 'I lose!'"</p>

  <p>He gazed at her very earnestly. "I like you, Miss Desborough," he
  answered. "I think you are the first lady I have complimented with that
  expression. I like you well enough to wish you had not come here
  to-night."</p>

  <p>The fire was falling into ashes; the marble clock struck a quarter to
  two.</p>

  <p>"But you must see," continued my lord, "that if Miss Kynaston, or any
  lady, threw herself on my protection, she, Miss Kynaston or any lady, would
  have a claim on me I could not&mdash;forgive me&mdash;ignore."</p>

  <p>He was smiling gravely with his lips and brilliantly with his eyes; he
  touched the smouldering embers with his foot and sparks flew up.</p>

  <p>"In brief," said Miss Desborough, "you do not choose that a woman should
  cause you in any way to alter your designs? Well"&mdash;her breath came
  heavily&mdash;"you have the advantage, my lord; it is your house, filled with
  your creatures&mdash;you could lock me up here and ride off with Kitty under
  my eyes; but you won't do that, my lord!"</p>

  <p>"Why not, Miss Desborough?"</p>

  <p>She gave a little panting laugh. "I saw you once in Dublin when you were
  Mr. St. John, and everyone was giving you the most grievous
  character&mdash;but I. One man like that is worth ten clods like Harley, I
  said, and&mdash;and if he is but half as fine a gentleman as he
  looks&mdash;'tis enough."</p>

  <p>"You dare more than you have yet done," said my lord. "In saying that you
  make me vain, and a vain man is not to be trusted&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not vain, sir," she flashed, "but proud&mdash;sure there isn't a man in
  England has more to be proud of than you!"</p>

  <p>"Now I perceive you try to flatter me," he smiled.</p>

  <p>Miss Desborough moved farther away. "I have always admired you, my
  lord..."</p>

  <p>"Ah," said he, quickly, "Dorinda dares&mdash;to tell me that!"</p>

  <p>She courtesied. "Dorinda dares&mdash;to your face, my lord."</p>

  <p>Lord Bolingbroke laughed. "Then I might dare&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What?" challenged Miss Desborough</p>

  <p>"Perhaps&mdash;to kiss Dorinda," he said, not insolently, but with a gay
  gallantry evoked by her spirit.</p>

  <p>She flushed and sparkled an answer.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'll kiss you gladly, Lord Bolingbroke, if you'll give me Kitty."</p>

  <p>"You must not tempt me&mdash;if Miss Kynaston chooses..."</p>

  <p>"Ah," she cried, "if Kitty chooses! Bring her in, my lord, and let her
  choose!"</p>

  <p>There was a second's pause before he answered: "That way you lose."</p>

  <p>"No," she said. "I shall win&mdash;and if I do not, if Kitty of her own
  free will does not come home&mdash;well, I'll let her go with you, my lord,
  with never a protest. Do you take the challenge?"</p>

  <p>They looked at each other intently.</p>

  <p>"By gad!" replied my lord, "I do. And if she elects to go home, I'll give
  you the despised word of Harry St. John that I'll never molest her again, nor
  shall tonight's adventure ever be breathed&mdash;my people can be
  discreet."</p>

  <p>"And this time I'll take your word!" cried she. "And if I lose&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you lose," said my lord, coming nearer, "you'll give me the kiss I did
  not take."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes!" she answered, elated.</p>

  <p>Lord Bolingbroke rang the bell.</p>

  <p>"One thing," said Miss Desborough. "I may say what I like to
  her&mdash;without interruption?"</p>

  <p>He turned to face her again. "What you like, madam"&mdash;his eyes danced
  amusement&mdash;"pictures of weeping mother, distracted lover, entreaties;
  but"&mdash;he glanced at the timepiece&mdash;"I can give you no more than ten
  minutes by the clock&mdash;still that, without interruption."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Miss Desborough, "ten minutes' passionate pleading
  against the splendid smile of Harry St. John!"</p>

  <p>My lord flushed despite himself; the servant entered. "There is a lady
  below&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir; she arrived some time ago."</p>

  <p>"Ask Miss Kynaston to come up here."</p>

  <p>Miss Desborough, erect and twisting her handkerchief into knots, stepped
  back toward the Chinese desk, where the thick shadows almost concealed her.
  My lord, intolerantly handsome, stood by the chimney-piece with the
  candle-light glimmering in his brilliant hair.</p>

  <p>The door opened violently, and Kitty Kynaston, all lace, white satin, and
  brown curls, rushed into the sombre room.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Harry!" she cried, almost before she had crossed the threshold, "I
  thought should die. The wheel came off the coach, and I had to come in a
  hackney, and so was late, and then you keep me waiting until I am in
  <i>hysterics</i>!"</p>

  <p>She sank into the chair that had served her cousin; her lovely face was
  near as pale as the pearls round her throat. As she gathered fresh breath, my
  lord, never moving, spoke: "You are disputed, my dear; this lady desires you
  to return home with her."</p>

  <p>Miss Desborough came a little out of the shadows.</p>

  <p>Miss Kynaston shrieked. "Dorinda!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Miss Desborough&mdash;"I, Kitty...and now we had better go
  home."</p>

  <p>Miss Kynaston sprang to her feet, her face sudden scarlet. "I am never
  going home again; you have no right to interfere, Dorinda&mdash;"</p>

  <p>My lord glanced at Miss Desborough and very slightly smiled.</p>

  <p>"The right of your friend, Kitty," she said, quietly.</p>

  <p>Miss Kynaston shook with agitation. "Harry! my lord!&mdash;what does this
  mean? What is Dorinda doing here?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, can't you see?" cried that lady, ignoring my lord's delicate triumph.
  "Well, my dear, I did not think you were quite so foolish."</p>

  <p>"This is intolerable," said Kitty; her eyes blazed with excitement, her
  cheeks burned with shame. "My lord," she added, hysterically, "please take me
  away."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," answered Lord Bolingbroke, "that you must listen to her for
  ten minutes." Again he smiled at Miss Desborough.</p>

  <p>"You have no right, Dorinda," cried Miss Kynaston, frantically. "I will
  not endure this&mdash;espionage."</p>

  <p>"I never spied on you, Kitty."</p>

  <p>"Then how could you know!"</p>

  <p>"My lord&mdash;Harry told me."</p>

  <p>The veins showed on Miss Kynaston's soft throat and forehead. "Told you!"
  she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Miss Desborough stepped nearer to her. "Will you come home, Kitty?" she
  asked, earnestly.</p>

  <p>Miss Kynaston stamped her foot. "No&mdash;I will not."</p>

  <p>Both ladies seemed careless of my lord's presence and absorbed in each
  other, Kitty Kynaston tempestuous, fierce, and overwrought; Miss Desborough
  pale and controlled.</p>

  <p>"You won't come home, Kitty?"</p>

  <p>"Not if you was to go on your knees, Dorinda. I know my own affairs. I'll
  not endure this meddling," was the passionate answer.</p>

  <p>"I don't think of going on my knees, my dear," said Miss Desborough,
  quietly. "This isn't at all an heroical affair...Of course, if I had thought
  you were going to behave so foolishly, I should have told you
  before&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Told me?"</p>

  <p>"That Harry..."</p>

  <p>"Harry!" shrieked Miss Kynaston.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my dear, Harry to me before ever you had seen him...this isn't the
  time for delicacy&mdash;and you must know the truth."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand!" flashed Kitty.</p>

  <p>"Oh, la!" cried Miss Desborough, "I did not think you could be so
  simple&mdash;didn't anyone advise you Lord Bolingbroke was a great admirer of
  mine?"</p>

  <p>"Of yours!"</p>

  <p>"We met in Dublin&mdash;he sent me three notes a day, and I returned them
  all," said Miss Desborough. "Those you received addressed to 'Chloe' were
  written for me, but you seemed so pleased with them I hadn't the heart to
  tell you."</p>

  <p>"Dorinda!" gasped Miss Kynaston, "how dare you!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Dorinda dares"&mdash;she gave a second's glance at the
  Viscount&mdash;"and surely you didn't think you were the first? Oh, you are
  very young...why, six months ago my lord was importuning me to run away with
  him; his admiration was quite the talk of Dublin."</p>

  <p>"Harry!" cried Miss Kynaston, "tell me this isn't the truth!"</p>

  <p>"My lord," said Miss Desborough, "ten minutes!"</p>

  <p>He made a little movement, took his handkerchief out and pressed it to his
  lips, but did not speak.</p>

  <p>"Of course it's the truth, Kitty. Why ever should I tell you a lie? How
  otherwise should I know you would be here to-night if my lord hadn't told me
  how you had lost your head?"</p>

  <p>"Lost my head!" quivered Kitty.</p>

  <p>"I always assured him you were merely playing; he vowed you were quite in
  love with him," answered Miss Desborough, "and so he suggested an elopement
  to you&mdash;well, just to see...I was very much to blame, but&mdash;I never
  thought you would go&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stop!" cried Miss Kynaston, desperately.</p>

  <p>Her cousin continued, piteously. "After you had left the ball, my lord
  came and&mdash;gave me this"&mdash;she held up the long silk glove&mdash;"to
  show he had won...then I was frightened."</p>

  <p>Miss Kynaston stared at the glove. "Oh!" she said.</p>

  <p>"Are you convinced?" asked Miss Desborough.</p>

  <p>Kitty Kynaston turned distractedly to my lord. "Why don't you
  speak&mdash;why don't you speak, sir? I shall think it true!"</p>

  <p>He looked at the clock; it wanted three minutes of the ten during which he
  had promised not to contradict Miss Desborough. "You must believe her if you
  will, madam," he answered.</p>

  <p>"You must disbelieve if you can!" Miss Desborough snatched something from
  her bosom and held it out on the palm of her hand before the maddened eyes of
  Kitty: a miniature of my lord with "To the fairest Chloe" inscribed on the
  rim.</p>

  <p>"He gave me this in Dublin," cried Miss Desborough. "It is just like
  yours, is it not? He must have them by the dozen! Oh, believe me, he cares
  for me as much as he does for you, and for any other woman as well as either
  of us!"</p>

  <p>The Viscount stepped forward. "By gad! madam&mdash;" he began, but her
  brilliant eyes held him silent.</p>

  <p>Miss Kynaston stared at the miniature a second, then whirled into speech.
  "I have been treated most vilely! I hate you both! How dared you, sir! How
  dared you! Oh, I wish I was dead!"</p>

  <p>He made an impulsive movement toward her.</p>

  <p>"Coward! Traitor!" Her lovely face was transformed with passion. "And you,
  miss, a deceitful hussy&mdash;" she burst into tears. "I never really liked
  either of you&mdash;Oh! Oh! I am ashamed I&mdash;ever&mdash;looked at you,
  sir. It was always against my own judgment&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She crushed her handkerchief into her eyes. "I'm going home."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Miss Desborough, rather faintly, "we will both go home."</p>

  <p>But Miss Kynaston, darting her a fierce look of weeping indignation, sped
  past and dashed out of the room, letting the door bang behind her.</p>

  <p>Her cousin caught hold of the chair back. "Nine minutes, my lord," she
  cried, gasping a little, "and wilful Kitty saved!"</p>

  <p>"By Heaven!" said Lord Bolingbroke, "the ingenuity of that move, madam,
  deserved success&mdash;you are a splendid diplomat."</p>

  <p>"I am a woman, understanding a woman," she answered, moving in an
  exhausted fashion toward the door. "Now I must go and make it right with
  Kitty."</p>

  <p>My lord came after her. "I kept my promise," he said, "did I not? Faith, I
  let myself be damned without a word of protest."</p>

  <p>Miss Desborough smiled. "I have to thank you for that. You must forgive
  me, my lord," she blushed, "in the&mdash;matter of&mdash;Dublin."</p>

  <p>"It would have been the truth had I been fortunate enough to meet you
  there."</p>

  <p>She caught hold of the door-handle and did not look at him. "Kitty is in
  hysterics in the hall; I must get her home&mdash;you have promised silence.
  Well, at last, good night, my lord..."</p>

  <p>"One word, one moment." He was ardently masterful. "How did you obtain the
  picture?"</p>

  <p>It was still in her hand; she held it out to him. "I found it on Kitty's
  table when I looked in her room. I suppose she had forgotten it in her
  agitation. Take it back, sir."</p>

  <p>He hesitated, but her raised eyes were very steady. "Please take it, Lord
  Bolingbroke."</p>

  <p>He took, instead, her hand. "Dorinda," he said&mdash;"Dorinda dares not
  keep it?"</p>

  <p>She snatched away her hand, and the miniature fell on the floor between
  them. "Dorinda dares her own heart to-night," she cried, wildly, "and has
  dared it far enough! Good night, my lord!"</p>

  <p>She opened the door and escaped. He heard her silks on the stairs, and her
  quick sobbing breaths as she struggled to compose herself.</p>

  <p>After a while he closed the door and went to the window. By the aid of the
  lamp at his gates he saw two ladies mount a chariot, one sobbing on the
  shoulder of the other.</p>

  <p>The marble clock struck a quarter past two. Lord Bolingbroke set his
  teeth, and in his heart cursed a certain lean and shrewish lady who was his
  Viscountess.</p>

  <h2><a name="story4"
     id="story4"></a>IV. &mdash; AN INITIAL LETTER</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Harper's Magazine</i>, April 1910</h3>

  <p class="first">MASTER HUMPHREY looked out of his window at Chepeside.</p>

  <p>In the garden opposite was a hawthorn in full flower, and beside it a lime
  tree, almost bare of leaves as yet, but full of wood-doves.</p>

  <p>It was very warm, and Master Humphrey had the window wide open; the pale,
  still sun circled the chamber, gilded the dark smooth walls, the long chest
  that stood in a corner, carved with a procession of revellers, the table at
  which Master Humphrey sat, and the parchments that covered it with heavy
  leaves that fluttered a little in the spring breeze.</p>

  <p>Close to his idle right hand that held a reed pen was a box of ebony and
  silver, and over it trailed a cluster of very frail roses, white stained with
  pink.</p>

  <p>Master Humphrey sighed, then yawned and gazed out of the window at the
  Chepe, the may, and the blue above the gabled houses.</p>

  <p>His room was on the ground floor, and his window low, so that when he
  rested his elbow on the sill and leaned out he was almost in the street.</p>

  <p>He was not a young man, nor in appearance gay, being pale and slight, and
  soberly dressed in olive green, but he looked at the hawthorn and sighed like
  a love-sick youth.</p>

  <p>A clerk in a red hood went down the street; Master Humphrey followed the
  spot of color with idle eyes almost to the city gates, then set himself to
  writing again.</p>

  <p>A great French book in a cover of leather touched with gold stood at his
  elbow: he was translating from it a celebrated romance.</p>

  <p>Flaggingly the reed pen went up and down the vellum.</p><br>

  <p class="poem">"Into ye halle sche came<br>
  Knelt before lorde and dame<br>
  Saying In Gode hys name<br>
  Ich grete ye alle.</p>

  <p class="poem">"And King Artour<br>
  Who is of greet valour,<br>
  Of Knyghtes ye flour,<br>
  On hym Ich calle,</p>

  <p class="poem">"Set ye swerdes a flame,<br>
  Ich telle a heavv shame<br>
  Justyce be dulle and lame<br>
  If ye delaye.</p>

  <p class="poem">"In a darke tour<br>
  Loathly a villian dour<br>
  Holdes in thys hour<br>
  A hygh borne may."</p><br>

  <p>Master Humphrey yawned again and dropped the pen.</p>

  <p>With an air of reflection he took up a sheet of vellum on which was drawn
  in red paint a large and flourishing capital letter P, finely shaped, but
  bare, hollow, and unadorned.</p>

  <p>Master Humphrey looked at it ruefully, shook his head, set it down, and
  presently fell asleep, leaning sideways in his chair.</p>

  <p>As the bells of the convent of St. Austin were ringing, a young squire
  came singing down the street.</p>

  <p>He was tall and slender; his hair was a soft brown, his lips red, his eyes
  very brightly gray; he wore a clear-green doublet, one red hose and one
  white, a hood of blue satin, and a cloak of cramoisy. One hand he held on his
  hip, where a little dagger hung; he walked daintily, careful of his pointed
  shoes, and his manner was most joyous.</p><br>

  <p class="poem">"God Himself was born in Maytime Phillipa!<br>
  Philomel at night, the bounting in the day time Phillipa!<br>
  The throstle in the even and my heart at the dawn<br>
  Bless the merrie month when God Himself was born!"</p><br>

  <p>At Master Humphrey's open window he stayed his steps and his singing and
  looked into the mellow little chamber.</p>

  <p>Seeing the writer was asleep, he smiled and climbed the sill gracefully to
  peep at the writing on the parchment.</p>

  <p>He read over the lines with a smiling disdain, then mischievously took up
  the pen and added:</p><br>

  <p class="poem">"Ich am tyred of Hercules and Lysander,<br>
  Of Peryceles and Alysander<br>
  Of Perceforert and ye Salymander<br>
  Of Artour and hys courte.</p>

  <p class="poem">"If sich a tale ye must rite<br>
  Of dragon, dame and heavy fighte,<br>
  Preymak oure labour lighte<br>
  And thys tale shorte."</p><br>

  <p>Master Humphrey woke up with the scratching of the pen, and the young
  squire burst out laughing.</p>

  <p>"Master Jeffray!"</p>

  <p>"I have been finishing thy accomplished 'rime couée' for thee," said the
  youth, demurely. "See how very smooth it goes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Master Humphrey looked.</p>

  <p>"Now thou hast spoiled a page of parchment for me&mdash;how must I rub to
  get that fair again?"</p>

  <p>"Leave it," smiled the squire; "it is as good as thine&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But not so pertinent to the tale."</p>

  <p>"A silly tale!" cried the other, joyously. "Art thou not tired of such
  silly tales?"</p>

  <p>"I earn good money with them," returned Master Humphrey.</p>

  <p>"Why, so thou dost, and a pleasant way, too. I would like to write tales
  well enough"&mdash;he waved a fair hand&mdash;"but differently. Come out into
  the fields; thou art so bemused with chant royal, couplet, 'rime couée,' thou
  canst not see there is a better poem than ever thou stained vellum with in
  that fresh hawthorn facing thee."</p>

  <p>The older man smiled indulgently.</p>

  <p>"Peace, for God His sake; you are young and vain."</p>

  <p>The squire caught up the ebony box and tried to see his own fair face in
  the polished silver fittings.</p>

  <p>"Attend to me, Jeffray." Master Humphrey held up the unfinished capital.
  "See, I have to complete this&mdash;it was sent me from Burgundy."</p>

  <p>"Burgundy!" sighed the young man. "I have been there&mdash;Oh, Venus!"</p>

  <p>"Listen to me&mdash;one of the Duke's men did it and died; now, as it was
  a good skin, they have sent it to me, to write a poem and even decorate it.
  You have sometimes a wit&mdash;tell me what P stands for?"</p>

  <p>Master Jeffray shook back his curls. "By Gesu and Ovid&mdash;say
  Phillipa!"</p>

  <p>The other frowned.</p>

  <p>"It is not a love poem&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"By charity! I do not know the word." Then he sprang over the sill into
  the street again and laughed over his shoulder. "I think it means
  'Pleasure'&mdash;that is what the poor wight would have
  written&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="poem">"Pleasure is a goddess<br>
  Well beloved by me<br>
  With bliss she comes and honeysuckle<br>
  To bind me to her knee!"</p><br>

  <p>Singing as he had come, he went down the street toward the gates.</p>

  <p>Master Humphrey mixed his saucer of colors and began to paint in, standing
  by the stem of the letter, a youth in green and white and red, with a chaplet
  of daisies round his soft locks.</p>

  <p>While he was still bending over this a lady came past with two pages and a
  serving-man. She wore an amber-colored gown, a long silver veil, and a 'cote
  hardie' of purple trimmed with ermine; she also stopped at the window and
  turned her face, like a breathing blossom, toward Master Humphrey.</p>

  <p>"Hast thou any fresh romances since I came back from Burgundy?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"This one, Mistress Phillipa, that a certain squire of his Grace has
  passed but now on his way to the fields."</p>

  <p>"By charity!" her red mouth was scornful. "I go not there to meet
  him&mdash;nor any other, but to pull flowers for my lady Blanche, certes, but
  I have walked from the Savoy."</p>

  <p>Master Humphrey held up the letter he worked on.</p>

  <p>"Master Jeffray says it means 'pleasure'&mdash;so I paint him standing
  there."</p>

  <p>Her glass-gray eyes became suddenly wet, like pale irises in the rain.</p>

  <p>"He thinketh of nought but pleasure," she said, petulantly.</p>

  <p>"Nay&mdash;first he said&mdash;Phillipa!"</p>

  <p>"A silly jest by the rood," she declared, and pulled at the yellow curl on
  her breast.</p>

  <p>"You play with him too long," admonished Master Humphrey. "Before ye both
  went to Burgundy with the Duke it was the same tale."</p>

  <p>"Thou art too ready with thy romances&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yet he loveth thee, Mistress Phillipa."</p>

  <p>"Maybe," she spoke indifferently, "he is no more to me than
  this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She shook a crimson butterfly off her veil.</p>

  <p>"Yet you break your heart for him," smiled Master Humphrey.</p>

  <p>She leaned in through the window.</p>

  <p>"Listen to me; I give you another meaning for your letter:</p><br>

  <p class="poem">"Pride holds Love in armes two<br>
  Giveth a hundred pains and mo<br>
  Poor Love he cannot move nor go<br>
  Pride is very strong, I tell you so&mdash;"</p><br>

  <p>"Shall I paint thee here also?" asked Master Humphrey.</p>

  <p>"Why," she said, "I mind not if in a <i>picture</i> I stand by Master
  Jeffray Chaucer."</p>

  <p>She waved her hand and went on, followed by the bright liveries of
  Lancaster.</p>

  <p>Master Humphrey smiled and drew in a figure of a lady with yellow hair the
  other side of the stem of the letter P.</p>

  <p>Several people&mdash;priests, nuns, clerks, monks, and soldiers&mdash;went
  past the window, and presently came another lady who was of a very
  breath-taking beauty.</p>

  <p>Master Humphrey, seeing her, bowed from the window; she was on foot and
  had three damsels with her.</p>

  <p>"Mistress Sywnford," said the painter, "Your sister has just passed
  here."</p>

  <p>She paused.</p>

  <p>"Ay, the whole world goes to the field to-day. Was Master Jeffray Chaucer
  with her?"</p>

  <p>"Nay; he went first,"</p>

  <p>"She is out of humor with him, for yesterday he fell a-brawling and beat
  the watch."</p>

  <p>"But being my lord's squire he escaped?"</p>

  <p>"Oh ay," she said, heavily.</p>

  <p>Master Humphrey looked at her curiously; she was of a golden-red
  loveliness, with brown eyes and drooping mouth; he had never seen her look
  anything but serenely or stormily sad. Her gown was pale blue, worked with
  little wreaths and roses of gold and silver; round her hair was a twist of
  velvet flowers, purple and white; over them a veil of fine tissue.</p>

  <p>"My lord's grace is in the fields?" asked Master Humphrey.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, and looked away down the Chepe.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly she was scornful.</p>

  <p>"By faith, thou art very peaceful here!"</p>

  <p>"Ay," he answered. "I paint an initial letter."</p>

  <p>He showed it to her; already it glittered with wet colors.</p>

  <p>"Pride and pleasure," he nodded his head. "Can you think of another
  meaning, Mistress Sywnford?"</p>

  <p>"Passion and pain," she answered, instantly.</p>

  <p>At this her three damsels, who were clad severally in russet, tawny, and
  and murry, smiled at one another behind her back.</p>

  <p>"Make a rhyme on that," said the painter.</p>

  <p>"I am no trouvère."</p>

  <p>"Shall I try?" He laid down his brush and folded his arms on the
  parchments.</p><br>

  <p class="poem">"Passion and pain be hard to fight<br>
  Good lack!<br>
  My beauty gives me no delight<br>
  Good lack!<br>
  Nor pomp of ribible and clokardè<br>
  Of low dowcemere and bombardè<br>
  Good lack!&mdash;"</p><br>

  <p>"Ah!" interrupted Katherine Sywnford. "You mean to rhyme on misplaced
  love&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She frowned dangerously.</p>

  <p>"Something about a king's son," answered Master Humphrey, "who had a dark
  face would have been in that song."</p>

  <p>"By charity!" she cried; then she sighed. "A king's son!"</p>

  <p>"The Duke's Grace of Lancaster is a son of kings."</p>

  <p>"Why do you speak of him?"</p>

  <p>"Because he is the most perfect knight I ever knew, and I have made him
  the hero of many a tale."</p>

  <p>She laughed uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Johan of Ghent is much praised and much admired. Give you good day.
  Master Humphrey."</p>

  <p>Slowly and with her head held a little droopingly she passed on, and her
  damsels fingered their hoods and smiled at one another under quiet lids.</p>

  <p>Master Humphrey painted in the loop of the P a lady sitting bowed, with
  braided hair and embroidered robe, and behind her a background of dark blue
  sprinkled with stars.</p>

  <p>And while he was finishing this a company came back through the Chepe
  toward the Savoy.</p>

  <p>First on a white horse with scarlet trappings rode Johan of Ghent and
  Lancaster, and the common people stopped under the eaves and in the gutter to
  watch him pass.</p>

  <p>He wore a furred robe of gold-colored silk, a deep rose coif over his dark
  hair, and gloves sparkling with jewels on the back.</p>

  <p>Beside him was the Duchess Blanche, delicate with gold locks glimmering in
  a net; riding a white palfrey.</p>

  <p>They talked together very lovingly.</p>

  <p>After came knights and squires, pages and serving-men, among them Sir Otto
  Sywnford whittling a rose stick.</p>

  <p>Then Katherine and Phillipa walking slowly, the elder with her eyes on her
  mistress showing pale and lovely through the press, and her sister with a
  half-smile for Jeffray Chaucer's joyous glance as he looked over his shoulder
  at her petulant beauty.</p>

  <p>Most of his company carried flowers that they had picked without the
  ramparts&mdash;narcissi, daffodils, cowslips, hawthorn, wild roses,
  eglantine, and the marguerite.</p>

  <p>Master Humphrey looked at Johan of Ghent.</p>

  <p>"Power would be the meaning ye would set to this," he said to himself, and
  his thoughts shook into rhyme as he watched the procession pass.</p><br>

  <p class="poem">"Power of life and death I hold,<br>
  Of love too, I wis, and such fair things<br>
  Well may I be proud and bold<br>
  Favourite of God and heir of Kings.<br>
  Beauty and strength adorn me like fine gold,<br>
  And while the sword on my bright greaves rings<br>
  I do not think I ever can grow old.<br>
  Oh Gesu and Phoebus, these English Springs<br>
  When the sun 'gins to shine across the wold!"</p><br>

  <p>And so they passed. And it fell very still, for it was midday.</p>

  <p>The painter looked at his unfinished letter.</p>

  <p>"My own meaning now," he said.</p>

  <p>He drew a splendid knight riding away across the page with a pennon in his
  hand, and then above the letter over all an angel hooded and meek.</p>

  <p>With that finished, he wrote with his reed pen dipped in brown:</p><br>

  <p class="poem">"Peace comes to alle, after alle,<br>
  Longe toyle, short stryfe or strong sea.<br>
  Peace to them that ryse and them that falle,<br>
  Either in joye or miserie.<br>
  Peace at laste, beyonde ye kindly starres<br>
  Where Gode He smyles and waytes,<br>
  Looking on alle oure revelryes and warres<br>
  Short joys, sade loves and weary hates,<br>
  Peace for alle; after most stormy daye<br>
  Cometh Peace which lasteth for alwaye."</p>

  <h2><a name="story5"
     id="story5"></a>V. &mdash; HOLY MR. HERBERT</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Harper's Magazine</i>, May 1910</h3>

  <p class="first">A GENTLEMAN was seated on a mile-stone that marked four
  miles to Bemerton, in the county of Wiltshire; it was midday in the month of
  June; warm, fair, and cloudy; the gentleman had an inkhorn by his side, and
  was employed in busily writing on some loose sheets of paper that he held on
  his knee.</p>

  <p>A little grove of young beech trees cast a rippling shade across the
  smooth white road; a hedge of hawthorn stuck with great clusters of blossoms
  shut off the meadow-land, where flocks of silent sheep grazed; about the
  mile-stone and edging the road grew sparrow-grass, dock leaves, large and
  torn, the parsley flowers with their feathery green and swollen striped buds,
  wild thyme, close and dark in the tufted grass, buttercups smooth and
  glistening, sun-reddened daisies, and ragged-robins, fragile and wild.</p>

  <p>A continuous veil of soft white cloud moved slowly across the sky,
  allowing a tempered sun to shine gently over the fields; and it was so quiet
  that the sound of the gentleman's quill moving over the paper was heard
  distinctly by a person who, all unknown to him, seated beside the gate that
  led into the meadow behind him, was watching him very closely.</p>

  <p>This person was a lady of comely appearance habited in a dark-gray
  travelling dress.</p>

  <p>She had a little riding-switch in her hands, and held it across her knees
  with an air of resolution, and her hood was thrown back on her shoulders,
  showing red ribbons in her brown hair.</p>

  <p>After she was tired of bending frowning eyes on the unconscious gentleman
  on the mile-stone, she took to glancing up and down the road, uttering little
  sighs of impatience, as if in hope the busy writer might look up.</p>

  <p>But he was too absorbed to hear her. The faint shadows waved to and fro on
  the road, the sheep moved slowly about in the soft grass, the wild flowers
  glowed and sparkled in the hedges, the hawthorn shone amid its sharp leaves
  and thorns; still the gentleman wrote, and the lady sat a few yards away from
  him on the low gate-post, sighing, frowning, and twisting her whip in her
  gloved fingers.</p>

  <p>Then, coming evidently to some resolution, she left her post and advanced
  along the hedge.</p>

  <p>Still he seemed utterly unaware of her presence; she stopped within a yard
  of the mile-stone.</p>

  <p>"Sir," she' said, "wilt thou be so courteous as to give me a sheet of
  paper, and to lend me for a moment thy pen?"</p>

  <p>He looked up, glanced at her with a pair of sweet gray eyes, and smiled in
  an abstracted manner; he was attired in quiet black, and long fair curls hung
  on to his clerical collar of fair lawn.</p>

  <p>"Surely, mistress," he answered, courteously; he handed her a sheet of
  paper, drawn from those on his knee, and fell to writing again.</p>

  <p>She looked at him with an amused frown on her brows.</p>

  <p>"Sir, if thou deniest me the quill, the paper is of no service."</p>

  <p>He looked at her blankly, then tugged himself away from his dreams and
  blushed.</p>

  <p>"I crave thy indulgence, mistress," he said. "When I am full of thoughts I
  am not mindful." He gave her the pen.</p>

  <p>"Nay," she answered, taking it, "I have watched thee for a full half-hour
  and hardly hast thou moved."</p>

  <p>"Watched me?" he glanced about him, bewildered; it began to occur to him
  that it was a strange thing a lady should interrupt his work in this manner.
  Now that he had resigned his pen, he had wits and leisure to observe her; she
  was young and pleasant, well dressed; he knew her for a gentlewoman, and
  marvelled that she should be alone.</p>

  <p>She took the sheet of paper to a beech tree that had encroached beyond the
  hedge, and, leaning across the flowers, began to write, setting the sheet
  against the stem. Standing so, with the parsley blossoms against her gray
  dress and the sunshine glimmering through the transparent beech leaves on to
  her glossy hair, with her brows gathered in a frown with the joint labor of
  writing and holding the paper steady, she made a pretty image of grace and
  softness.</p>

  <p>The gentleman's curiosity was aroused.</p>

  <p>"Hold it not unmannerly, mistress," he said, "if I shall question thee as
  to the reason of thy unprotected condition on a roadway where, albeit as
  tranquil as any in the King's dominions, Violence oft stalks abroad, to the
  menace of the weak."</p>

  <p>The lady looked at him over her shoulder and colored.</p>

  <p>"I know it fits not well with safety, sir, for a female to expose her
  person, unattended, seeing there are robbers and such horrid creatures that
  do prowl about, as I have oft heard travellers relate, but untoward
  circumstances have brought me to this pass. I pray that thou thinkest no less
  of me for that."</p>

  <p>She had now finished writing, and, taking a pin from her dress, fixed the
  paper to the tree.</p>

  <p>"I was seated by yonder gate when thou first camest hither&mdash;surely
  thou hadst not seen me had I not spoken, so deep wast thou in thy meditation.
  There is thy pen."</p>

  <p>He had risen and come toward her, holding the fluttering sheets.</p>

  <p>"Is it permitted me to read what thou hast written?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I write not secrets on the barks of trees," she answered. "It is there
  for any man to peruse."</p>

  <p>She stood holding out the pen to him; he took it, and she watched him
  while he read her paper. It ran thus&mdash;in a large, unpractised
  hand:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">" <span class="smcap">Dere Tom</span>,&mdash;It is a Sade
  Thinge Men are soe fulle of Evile and a Pitie, I see Thou hast deserted me
  Leeving me to Alle the Perils on the King his rode soe I am Gone and doe not
  meen to see your Face againe tho' once I thought it bewtiful. If Thou
  Returnst Thou wilt No why I am Gone Tom. If Not Thou dost not care so in Each
  case Fare thee well, tho' Wicked. <span class="smcap">Nancy</span>.</p>

  <p class="letter">I Add that I am also Hungrie."</p><br>

  <p>"I do not write clerkly penmanship," she said. "And it may be some words
  are ill spelt, but it is clear and stinging, is it not, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I am pitiful for Tom," answered the gentleman. "This offence must be
  great."</p>

  <p>"It is," she returned, shortly.</p>

  <p>"And the last portion of this message or letter," continued the
  gentleman"&mdash;forgive me&mdash;it is hardly logical this that thou hast
  written&mdash;'in each case, farewell.' Now if he sees not the paper he
  obtains not the farewell&mdash;so it is not in each case or either case, but
  in one&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tom is no scholar," she answered, gravely. "And what irks thee he will
  notice not."</p>

  <p>He was not satisfied. "If he returneth, he hath not forsaken thee?"</p>

  <p>"Nay," she admitted.</p>

  <p>"Then if he returneth he needeth not the message, and if he cometh not it
  is useless, since he will not see it."</p>

  <p>The lady bit her lip and reflected.</p>

  <p>"He is not coming back," she said at length. "But if he did I should
  desire him to know I knew he would not. So I will leave the paper."</p>

  <p>The gentleman was silenced.</p>

  <p>"How far is it to the nearest village?" she asked, playing with a spray of
  hawthorn.</p>

  <p>"At four miles lieth Bemerton," he pointed to the mile-stone. "Of which
  parish I am the unworthy minister, Mr. Herbert."</p>

  <p>"I thank thee. I am Mistress Anne Rolleston. I would the village was
  something nearer, as I am passing hungry, but even as it is I must proceed
  there, waiting no more for Tom."</p>

  <p>"This is a strange matter," said Mr. Herbert. "Truly if thou wouldst tell
  me a little more I might aid thee."</p>

  <p>"Sir," she answered, "it is a woful series of misadventures&mdash;all due
  to the ill temper of Tom. Tom is of a pragmatical, tiresome humor&mdash;of
  a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In brief&mdash;ye have quarrelled," smiled Mr. Herbert.</p>

  <p>"This morning," she said, gravely, "I was married to Tom by uncle's
  chaplain, and we ran away, meaning to depart from this spot. But the chaplain
  through fear betrayed us, I conjecture, for my uncle and my cousin Humphrey
  came after us with pistols, my uncle always desiring me to marry my cousin
  Humphrey, and I caring nothing for it. We distanced them, which Tom said was
  a miracle, as his horse had a double burden, and I misliked that and told him
  it was of his own choosing that I rode behind him, and he replied that a wife
  should not have sharp answers ready&mdash;which was an ill thing in him,
  seeing we have been but a few hours wed. On saying this to Tom he said that
  it was no matter of time but one of principle, and I could not forbear
  rejoining that my cousin Humphrey had never spoken to me like
  that&mdash;being always more gentle in his manner to me than Tom.</p>

  <p>"Near this the horse fell lame and Tom was furious, and I chid him for it,
  for if a man cannot keep his temper on his wedding-day&mdash;when shall he?
  He said I loved to chafe him, and that we must turn off our course, else we
  should be overtaken by uncle and Cousin Humphrey, so we went across some
  fields and came upon another road, which was mighty lonely. Tom led the horse
  and I walked behind. And then were we set upon by ugly villains who had guns;
  they took the horse and my box of jewels and Tom's watch and shoe-buckles and
  brooch and left us desolate. Upon which I wept and told Tom Humphrey would
  have done better in the like case, and he said if he had made resistance he
  had been killed, and perhaps I had been glad, and this was what came to a man
  for taking a wife, he had done better to have remained single, as his friends
  had advised him, and such like unmannerly talk. Then we came on to this road,
  and Tom said we must walk to Bemerton, and I said I would not, being tired,
  and so we disagreed. He said he would not leave me, I said he was no
  protection, whereon he told me I was a silly woman, and he wished that he had
  left me in my uncle's house. I said I wished so indeed, and asked him could
  he not find me a horse? He replied he would go a little way down the road to
  see if he might observe a house. Whereat he went, and that must be two hours
  or so past, and I will wait no longer."</p>

  <p>Mistress Rolleston finished her tale with an indignant glance from brown
  eyes sparkling with moisture at the paper pinned to the beech tree.</p>

  <p>"Some mischance hath befallen Tom," said Mr. Herbert. "I cannot believe he
  would forsake thee in this barbarous manner."</p>

  <p>She seemed to be under no apprehensian as to Tom's safety.</p>

  <p>"Thieves will not molest a man already robbed," she said, scornfully; she
  drew out her handkerchief from her sleeve and dashed away the tears gathered
  in her eyes. "And Tom had his wits and his two hands&mdash;Nay, he hath gone
  of a design and left me forlorn."</p>

  <p>"But, mistress," protested Mr. Herbert, "a man may not so desert his
  wife&mdash;knowst thou where he had intention of taking thee?"</p>

  <p>"To his house, Rolleston Court. It is, he told me, many miles from here,
  nor do I desire to go there&mdash;nay, nor will I."</p>

  <p>"Then thou wilt return to thy uncle, mistress?" questioned Mr.
  Herbert.</p>

  <p>Mistress Rolleston evaded that.</p>

  <p>"Sir, I am hungry and chafed with waiting; I will go on to Bemerton, where
  some will have pity on my plight."</p>

  <p>"Assuredly I will accompany thee," said Mr. Herbert, in his courtier-like
  yet sweetly simple manner. "It is not meet for thee to go alone."</p>

  <p>"Sir," she answered, gratefully, "I cannot be so far beholden to
  thee&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mr. Herbert waved his delicate hand.</p>

  <p>"Bemerton Rectory will be honored&mdash;and thou shalt not call it
  hospitality, since it is my bare duty as God His minister."</p>

  <p>He picked up his hat and his inkhorn and rolled together the papers.</p>

  <p>"Thou writest a book?" she asked, striving to put by her own
  heaviness.</p>

  <p>A look of soft shy pleasure came into Mr. Herbert's face.</p>

  <p>"It is, Mistress Rolleston, a book of some poor prose
  meditations&mdash;entitled <i>The Priest to the Temple</i>."</p>

  <p>"Thou art a learned gentleman," answered she, "and a kind one, and I am
  sorely troubled that I have interrupted thee with my trivial and worldly
  distresses."</p>

  <p>He reassured her that his work, such as it was, suffered not at all from
  being broken off abruptly, and they turned their faces toward Bemerton.</p>

  <p>Perceiving that the lady labored under some gloom caused by her forsaken
  plight, and that her thoughts were turning upon Tom, Mr. Herbert, to distract
  her, began to discourse pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"Hath not nature fairly enamelled these fields and meadows?" he said. "It
  seemeth to me that the month of June hath in it something of an unearthly
  beauty, as if God His mercy did disclose unto us a little of the delights of
  Paradise. Truly, a space of green, set with tall and excellent flowers, a
  fresh hedge beyond grown with tender white blossoms, a group of slender trees
  with leaves uplifted to the pearly heavens, hath in it as much of the divine
  as is vouchsafed to us."</p>

  <p>"It is very sweet," she answered.</p>

  <p>"Thou hast a neighborhood full of delights here, Mr. Herbert."</p>

  <p>"In my most ungrateful moments I could desire no more than the blessings
  God hath sent me," said Mr. Herbert, his eyes shining. "But this scene,
  enchanting as it is, lacketh yet one thing&mdash;the Sabbath bells&mdash;that
  do come so sweetly across the fields; on a fair Sunday morning it breaketh
  the heart with beauty to hear them."</p>

  <p>"Ah me!" sighed the lady, "I would Tom had been a godly man."</p>

  <p>They reached a point where the road divided into two; the sign-post marked
  one way to Bemerton, that which led straight ahead.</p>

  <p>Close to the sign-post was a whitewashed inn.</p>

  <p>"Here we may get food," said Mr. Herbert.</p>

  <p>"Tom had not far to go," remarked the lady, and her lips quivered.</p>

  <p>As they approached the inn they saw a bay horse with a white forefoot
  standing by the mounting-block.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" cried Mistress Anne Rolleston; she stopped. "I beseech you, sir,
  that we do not enter the inn&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Methought," answered Mr. Herbert, "thou wert over-hungry to walk to
  Bemerton."</p>

  <p>"I am hungry no longer," she said, hastily, "For that is Cousin Humphrey
  his horse."</p>

  <p>"Then, mistress," exclaimed Mr. Herbert, "I will call him out&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nay," she returned, something pale and shaking. "He would be enraged with
  me and carry me back to uncle&mdash;and since I am Tom his wife&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We must discover Tom," said Mr. Herbert.</p>

  <p>She made no reply to that.</p>

  <p>"Do not pass the inn, lest he be looking from the window," she entreated,
  "but let us take this road."</p>

  <p>"Which leads not to the village," smiled Mr. Herbert. "But since I have a
  friendship for Tom we will follow it for a little and then traverse the
  fields to Bemerton."</p>

  <p>Her deep brown eyes flashed gratitude.</p>

  <p>"Dear sir, thou art very good to me."</p>

  <p>They turned down the other road and walked rapidly away from the inn.</p>

  <p>"It must be Cousin Humphrey came this way," said Mr. Herbert, "otherwise
  had he passed us."</p>

  <p>"And where is Tom?" she cried. "What if he met with Humphrey?" Then, after
  considering a space, "I am sorry," said she, "that I did leave that message
  on the tree, for if Cousin Humphrey should see it he will know that I have
  quarrelled with Tom, which is not to my liking."</p>

  <p>"Thou saidst&mdash;'twas for all men to read."</p>

  <p>"All&mdash;save Humphrey and uncle."</p>

  <p>The road was narrow and high banked with wild-sloe hedges; blue asters and
  yellow daisies edged their path. Mr. Herbert carried his hat in his hand as
  if in reverence of the beautiful day, and tenderly clasped his papers to his
  bosom; Anne Rolleston thought of Tom and fingered her hood and her kirtle and
  looked about her uneasily, as if she feared to see him lying dead or disabled
  under every tree they passed..</p>

  <p>But she carried it with a high head, for&mdash;ah ah!&mdash;it was
  disgraceful of him. Not half a mile along the road&mdash;merely round the
  bend&mdash;there was this inn; minutes should have seen his return, and if
  the place proved not a posting-house, why&mdash;then he could have come back
  to take her there; oh, Tom, I fear thou art without excuse.</p>

  <p>They turned through a gate and walked across the fields.</p>

  <p>"This way," said Mr. Herbert. "It is many miles to Bemerton, but I know a
  cottage where they will be pleased to let thee rest."</p>

  <p>"Oh, sir," replied Mistress Rolleston, "how I am beholden to thy goodness,
  yet, withal, must admit, though ashamed, that my heart is something heavy
  because of Tom."</p>

  <p>"Be not downcast," replied Mr. Herbert, sweetly. "Assuredly we shall find
  thy Tom&mdash;there is some explanation for his absence, difficult now to
  guess at, but ample, in truth, and easy to believe."</p>

  <p>Mistress Anne kept her glance on the grass at her feet.</p>

  <p>"Sir," she said, falteringly, "a while ago I spoke overconfidently also, I
  fear&mdash;I was enraged&mdash;but thou dost not think&mdash;that
  is&mdash;harm is not likely to have come to him?"</p>

  <p>"To mine own knowledge the country is open as God His hand," replied Mr.
  Herbert. "Never have I seen aught but pleasant and innocent sights, and
  though I would love not to think of a damsel wandering in any place alone,
  still I would never fret for a gentleman his safety."</p>

  <p>The field they traversed sloped to an orchard enclosed by a low wooden
  fence; Mr. Herbert opened the wicket and they entered.</p>

  <p>All hues of pink and cream and white, the clusters of blossoms lay lightly
  on the gnarled old trees; green and gray mosses, dull-red lichens, clung to
  their twisted branches, and here and there the flowers had drifted on to the
  tall grass and lay fluttering there amid the sorrel and daisies.</p>

  <p>"Summer snow," said Mr. Herbert. "It is wondrous sweet."</p>

  <p>In places the trees were so low they had to stoop in passing under them,
  and once Mistress Anne's hood was caught back by an errant bough and the
  white petals shaken on to her brown curls and red ribbons.</p>

  <p>When they had passed through the orchard they came to another gate,
  admitting them to a garden filled with currant and gooseberry bushes, the
  young fresh leaves of which were smelling fragrantly.</p>

  <p>Mistress Anne gathered up her skirts because of the thorns and looked at
  the gabled house adjoining the garden.</p>

  <p>They went round to the front, where the sun lay strongly over a bed of
  pinks, a border of stocks and sweet-williams; over the white-beamed face of
  the house climbed a sweetbrier; a thrush in a basket cage hung against the
  wall, and a smooth-haired dog slept on the warm cobbled path.</p>

  <p>"This is a tranquil place," sighed Mistress Anne.</p>

  <p>A woman in a blue gown came to the open door and curtsied low at the sight
  of Mr. Herbert.</p>

  <p>"Mistress Powell," he said, "there hath been an accident on the highroad,
  and this lady is too weary to walk to Bemerton, therefore I dared assure her
  she would be welcome here for what time it would take me to return to
  Bemerton and fetch a horse."</p>

  <p>Mistress Powell, overwhelmed with pleasure, welcomed them into the
  house.</p>

  <p>"And my Jack will run into Bemerton for your honor."</p>

  <p>"Nay," answered Mr. Herbert. "This lady will stay at the Rectory, and I
  will acquaint Mistress Herbert of her coming."</p>

  <p>Mistress Anne sank down on the settle inside the door of the great shady
  kitchen, for she was truly weary.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Herbert," said she, "I put thee to great trouble."</p>

  <p>"Nay," he replied. "'Tis I who will ask a favor of thee&mdash;that is,
  that thou shouldest take these papers into thy keeping until my return."</p>

  <p>She flushed with pleasure and put her hand out for the roll.</p>

  <p>Mr. Herbert lingered over it.</p>

  <p>"They are safer with thee," he smiled. "If I, being careless when alone,
  dropped any of these vagrant sheets, it would be some anguish to repair the
  loss."</p>

  <p>With that and many comforting words and assurances of his swift return the
  gentleman left the cottage.</p>

  <p>Mistress Anne clasped his papers tightly and watched him across the
  fields, his fair hair spread over his gleaming white collar, his slender
  black figure casting a shadow behind it; Mistress Powell, with a tall girl to
  help her and two curious children clustering about her skirts, brought
  refreshment to the guest, and she was not slow to take it; Tom, she
  reflected, must be hungry by now, and at the thought of him she had much ado
  to prevent the tears from splashing into a cup of milk or flavoring the cake
  she ate.</p>

  <p>When she had finished she was prettily grateful; they hastened to place a
  chair for her in the door, and she sat there in the sun, with the fat thrush
  and the silly dog for company.</p>

  <p>While she mused about Tom and his great wickedness, the roll of Mr.
  Herbert's writings fell from her knee, and, being carelessly tied, the string
  ('twas a ribbon from Mr. Herbert's wristband) came undone and the sheets were
  scattered at her feet.</p>

  <p>She picked them up hastily and respectfully and began putting them neatly
  together according to their numbering.</p>

  <p>There were eight pages&mdash;all freshly written upon in a close hand.</p>

  <p>She counted them&mdash;one, two, three, four, five, six&mdash;nine,
  ten&mdash;</p>

  <p>She caught her breath-two sheets were gone. She looked about the garden.
  But no; had she not instantly picked up the leaves as they came untied?</p>

  <p>Again she counted them. Alas, there was no mistake; two sheets of Mr.
  Herbert's book were lost.</p>

  <p>Dismay and self-reproach made her heart beat thickly; she had disturbed
  him, distracted him; through her his book, the result of his holy meditation
  and labor, would be spoiled.</p>

  <p>She could not bear to picture his face when he discovered his
  misfortune&mdash;had he not said "it would be anguish to repair the
  loss?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Tom!" she cried to herself, "thou art the cause of all this!"</p>

  <p>But there was a remedy; somewhere along the road were those two straying
  sheets, the chances great that nobody would yet have passed along that lonely
  way, discovering them. It was not so very far to the mile-stone where she had
  first met Mr. Herbert; could she but run back there and secure them before he
  returned, she would repair the mischief that she had unconsciously
  caused.</p>

  <p>She did not like to go along the road alone; she was sorely tired, and she
  had a dread of Cousin Humphrey lurking near&mdash;but these objections were
  not to be set against the joy of recovering the precious sheets.</p>

  <p>Rising, she softly called to her one of the children watching her from the
  kitchen.</p>

  <p>"Dear chuck," she said, "if I am not back before Mr. Herbert his return,
  tell him I am gone to walk in the orchard and will soon be back&mdash;the
  same to thy mother."</p>

  <p>She tied up carefully the remaining papers and put them in the pocket
  hanging at her side, then started off swiftly through the currant bushes,
  looking about her as she went.</p>

  <p>Quite distinctly could she remember the way they had come, and reckoning
  the distance in her mind, was sure that she could secure the precious
  writings and be back with them before Mr. Herbert returned from Bemerton.</p>

  <p>If she could not find them&mdash;that tragedy loomed as large in her mind
  as the desertion of Tom, "for surely," she said to herself, "it would be a
  woful thing if Mr. Herbert his book was spoiled through a silly woman."</p>

  <p>Under the orchard boughs she looked in vain; across the meadows her eyes
  were busy from right to left for a hopeful glimmer of white or aught that
  might prove to be the missing sheets.</p>

  <p>When she reached the road she had found nothing, and was besides a little
  breathless with anxiety and quick walking.</p>

  <p>The sun was now at its fiercest, and the clouds had rolled off the sky,
  leaving the landscape golden. Mistress Anne set her lips at the sight of the
  long, lonely, white, hot road, closed the gate with an air of resolution, and
  hurried in the direction of the inn.</p>

  <p>Her eager brown eyes scanned every bed of celandines, every clump of white
  clover, every waving tuft of speedwell she passed, and when she had almost
  reached the end of the road&mdash;when the white inn began to stare at her
  through the trees&mdash;her heart sank dolefully.</p>

  <p>Fears of Cousin Humphrey assailed her; she began to slacken her pace; it
  was hot and dusty, she felt miserably alone, and the prospect of the empty
  road with no hint of what she sought was mighty merciless.</p>

  <p>Still she pursued her way, though flaggingly, and presently had reached
  the inn and turned on to the highroad.</p>

  <p>The ominous nag with the white forefoot was no longer there; that was some
  poor comfort&mdash;but, alas! it seemed as if she would not find the missing
  sheets!</p>

  <p>Had she overlooked them on the way?&mdash;how was it possible they could
  have gone&mdash;who, on that lonely road, should, in the short space of half
  an hour or so, have found and carried away two small portions of paper lying
  by the roadside? It was mystifying and miserable.</p>

  <p>If she might find only <i>one</i>&mdash;her feverish thoughts told her
  that <i>two</i> must spoil the work of the gentle writer who had befriended
  her...She reached the mile-stone...nothing!</p>

  <p>There was her own message, dangling from the beech trunk&mdash;there was
  the mile-stone, marked with ink&mdash;nothing else!</p>

  <p>She sank down on the soft wild flowers and gentle grass, all dismayed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>Tom</i>," she said, and, "Sweet Tom, where art thou?" then she
  began to cry for desolation, and, "Cruel Tom!" said she.</p>

  <p>Her hands went up to her face and she sobbed, not loudly, in a piteous,
  stifled manner.</p>

  <p>She must go back to Mr. Herbert&mdash;she must face him with the tale of
  the missing pages.</p>

  <p>A live terror mingled suddenly with these miseries, caused by the click,
  click of a horse coming slowly along the road.</p>

  <p>Perhaps this was Humphrey&mdash;perhaps it was some passing traveller who
  had found the precious leaves; perhaps it was some brigand or robber.</p>

  <p>This last surmise proved the strongest; Mistress Anne sprang up and
  withdrew into the foliage beneath the beech, tears still in her eyes and her
  heart thumping thickly.</p>

  <p>She saw the horseman come into sight; a bay horse with a white forefoot,
  but the rider was not Humphrey.</p>

  <p>"Hullo&mdash;<i>Nan</i>!" said he.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Tom!" she cried, coming round the tree, then she choked.</p>

  <p>He walked the horse up to her and dismounted; his pleasant face was red
  and he had no hat.</p>

  <p>"Nan, where hast thou been?" he asked her. "Sweet Nan, art thou still
  angered?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed," said she, joyfully, "I was not <i>angry</i>, Tom&mdash;but thou,
  thou art a little&mdash;late."</p>

  <p>"Late!" answered he; and he smiled, for no reason, it seemed, but the
  pleasure of looking at her face. "Late!" he repeated. "When I have had thy
  cousin Humphrey to settle with&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That is Cousin Humphrey his horse," cried she&mdash;"and, oh,
  Tom!"&mdash;this in a breathless addition&mdash;"hast thou killed him!"</p>

  <p>"Nay," said he, in a shy manner. "But first tell me where thou wert."</p>

  <p>She told him her adventures in a breath.</p>

  <p>"I waited here till I was tired, Tom, then I went with a
  clergyman&mdash;Mr. Herbert&mdash;on the road to Bemerton."</p>

  <p>"Ay," answered Tom, "that is holy Mr. Herbert that was at the
  court&mdash;but what of the man from the inn? Listen, Nan; when I got thither
  I ran into <i>Humphrey</i>, and we talked, and I asked after thy uncle. He is
  five miles back, said Humphrey, being too stout for riding&mdash;I am the
  only one. I said, 'I am Anne her husband.' 'Very well,' said he, heroical, 'I
  will make Anne a widow.' Seeing he was resolved to fight, I called a man and
  bid him go up the road and stand by you. With that we went into the garden,
  and we said, let us fight only till the first blood is drawn, because we once
  were <i>friends</i>. So we did, but I hurt Humphrey his side so that he was
  near to death. And methought thou wast safe away from the bloodshed, so rode
  into Bemerton on Humphrey his horse, where there is a doctor, to save
  Humphrey his life, and when I returned asked about the lady. 'I found no
  lady,' said this silly man, and I was like to be maddened, and with that
  galloped up here and saw naught&mdash;then I went the other way and all the
  while called on thee&mdash;and but now came back here again to look once
  more. And that is the story, <i>Nan</i>."</p>

  <p>He paused, panting and flushed after the longest speech he had ever made
  in his life, and a little surprised at himself for having made it.</p>

  <p>Mistress Anne pulled her message off the tree and squeezed it up in her
  hand.</p>

  <p>"What is that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Tom," said she, "thou art very nice."</p>

  <p>He colored and played with the saddle fringe of Humphrey's bay; she came
  to where lie stood and slid her hand into his.</p>

  <p>"Art sweet-tempered, too," she smiled.</p>

  <p>"Am a brute," said Tom, looking at the dusty toes of his boots, "to have
  vexed thee, Nan."</p>

  <p>"Nay-<i>I</i> was peevish with the early rising&mdash;and, oh, Tom!" she
  pulled the papers out of her pocket, "there are Mr. Herbert his papers, and
  two are lost!"</p>

  <p>"Thou camest to search for them?" asked Torn; "then I am glad they were
  <i>lost</i>."</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>Tom!</i>" she cried, thrusting them into his big hand. "It is a
  book and marred by two sheets&mdash;being gone&mdash;and through me was this
  misfortune."</p>

  <p>Tom puckered his brows and strove to look learned.</p>

  <p>"We must find them, dear heart," he said.</p>

  <p>They spread out the curling sheets on the saddle and Tom's great fingers
  smoothed them out.</p>

  <p>"One, two, three, four, five, six," said she counting;
  "then&mdash;see&mdash;nine, ten&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Tom frowned and twisted up his face; he seemed to be reading the close
  writing; Mistress Anne waited in awe.</p>

  <p>"See," said he, triumphantly&mdash;"the words read straight from six to
  nine&mdash;and so on&mdash;'tis Mr. Herbert hath numbered them wrong, and no
  sheets are missing, Nan."</p>

  <p>Her delight and admiration were boundless.</p>

  <p>"Thou art a scholar and wit," she cried.</p>

  <p>Then she looked away and they both were silent.</p>

  <p>"Wilt thou ride pillion now?" asked Tom at last, shyly, "as far as
  Bemerton, Nan?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>Tom!</i>" she said.</p>

     id="story6"></a>VI. &mdash; THE FEUD</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Harper's Magazine</i>, July 1910</h3>

  <p class="first">THE prisoner looked up as they crossed the threshold of the
  castle; looked up and around him with an air of curiosity and personal
  interest.</p>

  <p>When my lord's secretary came to the little party in the great hall, he
  was still gazing, in that keen, absorbed manner, at the dark walls that shut
  him in; for the rest, he stood very quietly surrounded by his four
  captors.</p>

  <p>"What is this?" asked the secretary. He was a young man and seemed
  depressed; to wear notably that manner of gloom which was the result of
  living in the huge and lonely castle.</p>

  <p>One of the men with the prisoner was from London, in the Government
  employ, half spy, half constable; he took the leadership naturally.</p>

  <p>"We found this man breaking into the castle grounds," he said. "He showed
  fight, could give no account of himself; the Duke had best see him."</p>

  <p>The secretary's eyes ran over the prisoner.</p>

  <p>"Is it worth while?" he asked, indifferently.</p>

  <p>The man from London was nettled.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said. "What am I down here for? The follow was making for the
  coast&mdash;for all we can swear a Papist with a French sloop hanging round
  the horizon&mdash;and after the plots&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah, plots!" interrupted the secretary. "We hear of nothing but plots
  now."</p>

  <p>"And with good reason. There are more Papists abroad than have been
  discovered vet."</p>

  <p>The secretary was still indifferent.</p>

  <p>"Need you have troubled my lord?"</p>

  <p>"I think, sir, there is no other magistrate near by..."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;" said the secretary, and he lifted his shoulders; the men
  about the prisoner knew what lay behind his manner; my lord was a Papist and
  more than suspected of complicity in these same plots; it was a rumor not
  breathed openly, but universally believed, that he was an exile from London
  and Court favor on account of discovery of his treason, and that, did not the
  King owe him more money than could ever be repaid, he had shared the end of
  my lord Stafford. This was no matter of theirs now, anxious as they were to
  please their masters the mob with fresh victims; two of them were soldiers
  from my lord Feversham's regiment, quartered near to have an eye on the
  dangerous; the fourth a nondescript ally of the man from London.</p>

  <p>"Take the fellow to town," said the secretary, eying them.</p>

  <p>"We want my lord's authority for that&mdash;he was captured in the castle
  grounds."</p>

  <p>The secretary turned on his heel.</p>

  <p>"This way," he said, and mounted the wide, ill-lit stone stairs.</p>

  <p>The castle had been built in the time of the Norman kings, and was little
  altered from those days, save in the dreariness that had descended on it
  since the loss of its ancient glory; it lacked the men-at-arms, the squires,
  the pages, the jesters, the guests coming and going, who had once made its
  vastness cheerful.</p>

  <p>It seemed now a dead and hollow shell, though every stone was intact, and
  this part at least furnished with a show of great wealth.</p>

  <p>The secretary, the little group of men behind him, stopped on a wide
  landing hung with tapestry.</p>

  <p>It was as yet only twilight, but two huge iron arms, painted and gilt,
  projecting from the wall, gripped in their fists thick tapers that had been
  lit some time, for they bent either side the fingers that held them, and the
  wax dripped over the gilt and scarlet.</p>

  <p>Between them was a lofty door; the secretary entered and the others
  followed; the prisoner still looked about him with an air of eager
  observation.</p>

  <p>The room had been rebuilt of late years; the walls were lined with
  panelling, the ceiling painted; the chimney-piece was handsomely carved, and
  in the stained-glass window that burned azure in the dusk were the arms of my
  lord's family quartering fifteen heiresses.</p>

  <p>The candles were yet unlit, but a steady fire burned upon the hearth. The
  secretary lit a lamp that hung by silver chains from the ceiling, and left by
  an inner door.</p>

  <p>The prisoner stood a little apart from his guards, and as the lamp flame
  leaped up, disclosing the room, his eyes went at once to the mantelpiece,
  where a portrait of my lord's father was set in the dark wood between two
  figures of Strength and Charity, that stood in niches under a Grecian
  canopy.</p>

  <p>The painting was dark and stiff, yet powerful in a certain carriage of the
  head, a locked look about the mouth, as of one who could speak and would not,
  and a bold, stern expression in the dark eyes.</p>

  <p>Below the portrait, cut deep in the wood, was the family motto, "Strength
  and Charity," on a scroll with the arms beneath.</p>

  <p>In the centre of the room, under the lamp was a table set with gold
  writing materials, several books, and a milk-hued alabaster bust of a
  warrior; on the floor was a Persian carpet, and, on a rich bench against the
  wall, a suit of damascened armor, and a crimson cloak.</p>

  <p>The prisoner's quick, attentive glance did not miss one of these details;
  he appeared more interested in his surroundings than his situation.</p>

  <p>The others stood at attention, whispering among themselves; the prisoner's
  arms were tied behind him, and they had taken his weapons away, nor did he
  show the least sign of the desperate fierceness he had displayed before they
  were able to capture him in the castle grounds.</p>

  <p>Not five minutes after the secretary had left, the inner door opened
  again, and my lord entered the room.</p>

  <p>He held a bunch of violets in his hand and came straight to the table.</p>

  <p>The prisoner looked at him with no change in his demeanor; the others
  uncovered.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to trouble your Grace," began the man from London.</p>

  <p>"I am not infrequently disturbed in this manner," returned the Duke. "We.
  do not lack for plots." He laid his violets on the table and seated
  himself.</p>

  <p>He was not above eighteen or twenty, of the middle height and slender,
  delicate, of a compelling gravity in his bearing and expression, yet of a
  courteous sweetness in his manner; with all, he had a half-sad air of long
  self-containment at variance with his extreme youth.</p>

  <p>His face showed no likeness to the dark portrait over the mantelpiece; it
  was pale, still rounded with the curves of childhood; the features
  aristocratic, sensitive, and regular.</p>

  <p>His eyes were gray, soft, and beautiful, well set under level brows; thick
  curls of dusky brown hair fell on to his shoulders, framing and accentuating
  his pallor. He was very finely dressed in ash-colored satin, with a gold
  ribbon in his cravat, and silver threads in his waistcoat; his whole
  personality was remarkable for an air of proud austerity and serene
  dignity.</p>

  <p>His glance rested without curiosity on the prisoner.</p>

  <p>"The government is overzealous in these parts," he said, with the candor
  of one who disdains to be politic. "I think it becomes tyrannical."</p>

  <p>The man from London had his answer ready.</p>

  <p>"Your Grace knows the ferment the kingdom is in since the plot was
  discovered."</p>

  <p>My lord seemed to know and despise the plot for a mere political engine;
  it was not difficult for a man of sense to see more of Lord Shaftesbury than
  the Crown in this sensational discovery that was shaking the kingdom; he
  looked away from the captors and addressed the prisoner.</p>

  <p>"Sir." he said, courteously, "have you any reason to adduce for being in
  my grounds to-night?"</p>

  <p>The prisoner drew a quick breath and shook himself.</p>

  <p>"I am a stranger," he said, in a low voice. "I did not know I was
  forbidden."</p>

  <p>"That is but reasonable," answered the Duke. "And I, sir, should be
  pleased enough to set you on your way, yet to satisfy these gentlemen, you
  must first answer another question&mdash;for what reason were you in this
  lonely part of the country&mdash;and so late?"</p>

  <p>The prisoner looked at the floor.</p>

  <p>"I was staying in the village," he began.</p>

  <p>The man from London interrupted.</p>

  <p>"My lord, it is a lie; I have had the village under observation; two hours
  ago this fellow rode up to the inn, left his horse, and made straight for the
  sea. Yesterday I had news of a foreign vessel lurking along the coast, and
  'tis as plain as can be that this fellow was to meet her to-night&mdash;he
  was late and so broke through your lordship's grounds as a short
  way&mdash;when we, who had followed, stopped him; he made a fierce
  resistance, and whatever he may have composed since, he could then give no
  account of himself."</p>

  <p>The Duke did not appear much impressed.</p>

  <p>"What have you to say?" he asked the prisoner.</p>

  <p>"I was on my own business. I refuse to disclose it;" he gave the man from
  London an ugly look. "Everything is not involved in your damned Popish
  plot."</p>

  <p>"You can say no more?" questioned my lord, looking at him.</p>

  <p>"I will not."</p>

  <p>"Your Grace hears!" cried the man from London.</p>

  <p>"I hear no treason, Sir," said the young Duke, coldly, "nor do I see any
  reason to connect this man with plots&mdash;false informers are common, and I
  would not on slight grounds send a man to London under suspicion now."</p>

  <p>He picked up the violets and laid them down again.</p>

  <p>"Set the man at liberty," he said.</p>

  <p>"Your Grace is too careless." The man from London stepped to the table.
  "We found this on the prisoner; two pistols, and this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He placed a red leather case with silver clasps among the quills and
  papers.</p>

  <p>The prisoner made an impetuous movement, quickly checked.</p>

  <p>"Aha!" said the man from London, triumphantly.</p>

  <p>"What is here?" asked the Duke, with dislike of his task.</p>

  <p>He opened the red case; it contained a packet of letters tied round and
  round with yellow silk and scaled in two places with a wax of a curious green
  color, and one loose paper, also sealed; there was a writing in cipher across
  one corner.</p>

  <p>"If your Grace will open them..."</p>

  <p>"I can see no occasion to open these papers, sir. I think you encroach
  upon your duty."</p>

  <p>The young spoke with disdain and weight; he leaned back in his chair and
  looked at the prisoner.</p>

  <p>"Will you give me your word, sir, these papers contain nothing
  treasonable?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"They treat of private matters, my lord," was the low answer.</p>

  <p>"Your Grace sees he is evasive," put in the Government man.</p>

  <p>The Duke slightly frowned; he again addressed the prisoner.</p>

  <p>"You make it difficult for me&mdash;I have no wish to send you to
  London&mdash;a little frankness, sir, would best serve my wishes and
  yours."</p>

  <p>The prisoner moved his head and moistened his lips; his manner showed
  controlled resentment and sullenness.</p>

  <p>"If your Grace," he said, in a labored fashion, "will release me&mdash;I
  assure you, I swear, I am innocent of all plots..."</p>

  <p>He paused; my lord, with the violets to his lips, was watching him.</p>

  <p>"I am in a situation which is difficult to explain&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Again he came to a stop.</p>

  <p>"What are these papers?" asked my lord, lowering his gray eyes to
  them.</p>

  <p>"Your Grace, private matters."</p>

  <p>"What is your name?"</p>

  <p>"One of no importance." This with some fierceness.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, you must answer me, if I am not to give credence to your
  guilt."</p>

  <p>The man from London interrupted.</p>

  <p>"There is no need for anything further, my lord; send the man to
  London."</p>

  <p>A slight flush overspread my lord's fair face.</p>

  <p>"For Francis Dangerfield to swear his life away?" he said. "I will have
  more proof than this first."</p>

  <p>He picked up the loose letter.</p>

  <p>"By your leave, sir, I must open this, since you will not be more free
  with me."</p>

  <p>The prisoner came swiftly forward and stood at the table.</p>

  <p>"Will your Grace," he said earnestly, "send these men from the room
  first?"</p>

  <p>My lord paused and looked up.</p>

  <p>"Why?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The prisoner, who had been hitherto in the shadow, stood now directly
  under the light of the silver lamp.</p>

  <p>He was a man of no more than forty, but his eyes and mouth were deeply
  lined, and there was no look of youth on his cynical face; he was powerfully
  made, not tall, but erect, and dressed in velvet&mdash;the garb of a
  gentleman. Gazing steadily at the Duke, he repeated his request.</p>

  <p>"I entreat your lordship not to open that letter until we are alone and,
  by everything that can have any weight with you, to send these men away."</p>

  <p>There was so much of force, desperate, sincere appeal, intense feeling in
  his speech that the youth to whom it was addressed stared at him with some
  wonder.</p>

  <p>The tired brown eyes and the clear gray eyes held each other a moment's
  space.</p>

  <p>Then my lord spoke.</p>

  <p>"Very well...Why not!"</p>

  <p>The man from London had a hundred reasons; but the young Duke's calm
  authority overruled him; he and his followers went sullenly from the room to
  wait on the head of the great stairs.</p>

  <p>With their going was silence; only the distant, vague beat of the sea, and
  the complaint of a rising wind striking the windows, broke the stillness.</p>

  <p>My lord still held the letter.</p>

  <p>"If you will tell me no more, I must read this," he said.</p>

  <p>"I told you that it was a private matter, but you will not take my word,"
  returned the prisoner, fiercely.</p>

  <p>Now he was alone with his judge, his demeanor had changed; his manner was
  impatient, almost insolent.</p>

  <p>My lord, who from not considering him at all had been drawn to some
  interest, regarded him with inscrutable, wide eyes, and broke the seal of the
  letter.</p>

  <p>The prisoner interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Will you untie my hands?" he asked. His face had a curious dead pallor,
  his mouth strained.</p>

  <p>My lord gave a half-glance at the pistols lying where the man from London
  had left them among the papers.</p>

  <p>"The ropes cut my wrists," said the prisoner, hoarsely.</p>

  <p>The Duke moved the pistols to beside his own seat, then rose and untied,
  with some difficulty, the skilful knots.</p>

  <p>He returned to his chair in silence, and the prisoner crossed to the fire
  and with a little shudder held his hands out to the glow.</p>

  <p>My lord opened the letter, glanced down it carelessly, then more
  attentively, turned it over to see the last lines, then raised his eyes
  swiftly to the other man, who was watching him with an expression of
  hatred.</p>

  <p>"Well, my lord, read it," he said.</p>

  <p>Without an answer the Duke turned again to the letter.</p>

  <p>It bore neither name of place, nor date, nor any term of address, but
  commenced at once in a firm handwriting with these words:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"I have been more successful than I dared to hope.</p>

  <p class="letter">"The Plot, as you will have heard, is shaking the country,
  Shaftesbury is the most forceful man in England, and no Papist is safe. There
  is no need for me to name the lords who have lately suffered.</p>

  <p class="letter">"As for our private affairs, you must know that I have
  managed them very well; with the aid of public feeling (and every one now
  thinks a Papist the devil himself) and my own talent for counterfeit
  handwriting I have involved my old enemies beyond redemption. You remember
  our oaths?...not to spare.</p>

  <p class="letter">"The little Duke is ruined for his father's sake and for my
  father's memory; he dare not show himself at Court nor near London, but hides
  in one of his great mansions&mdash;perhaps the castle I shall have to pass
  to-night.</p>

  <p class="letter">"The King owes him much, but I will spring a mine under him
  no royal hand shall save him from; I look to see his head fall as fell the
  heads of Montrose and Derby, so I have put him in the inner plot to kill the
  King.</p>

  <p class="letter">"You say you still walk with God in the old faith and that
  it comforts you in your exile, and ask me of myself.</p>

  <p class="letter">"I am not what my father was; how could I be? I know not
  what I believe, I have seen many strange things since I was a godly man; it
  is pleasant at least to be avenged.</p>

  <p class="letter">"You will say I am careless and that this should be in
  cipher, but I will deliver it to Campion myself.</p>

  <p class="letter">"The country is riddled with spies, but our rendezvous is
  so lonely I fear not to be discovered. I am supposed in London, where I gave
  evidence last week.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Continue with your share of the business; send me what
  news you can; 'The Woolpack' is safe enough and not suspected of anything
  more serious than owling.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Your last letters from Lord S&mdash;&mdash; to the Spanish
  were useful; a cry of foreign invasion always works.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Be careful and be hopeful. I look to see you in London
  yet."</p><br>

  <p>The letter ended as abruptly as it had begun; my lord laid it down, and
  looked round at the prisoner.</p>

  <p>"You wrote this?"</p>

  <p>The man turned with his back to the fire.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"To whom is it written?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I tell you?"</p>

  <p>"I think I can guess&mdash;an exile in Holland, probably a regicide."</p>

  <p>"Yes, a regicide."</p>

  <p>The young Duke moved slowly in his chair so that he faced the
  prisoner.</p>

  <p>"And you are one of the authors of this infamous plot: an Oates, a
  Dangerfield, a Bedloe&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Listen to me&mdash;my name is Martin Bampfield."</p>

  <p>The Duke, pale, cold, gazed at him with unmoved eyes.</p>

  <p>"That name is nothing to me."</p>

  <p>"It is the name of one who hates you and all your house."</p>

  <p>"I have never heard it before."</p>

  <p>"I think you have, my lord."</p>

  <p>The prisoner's eyes were hard and narrowed; the red light of the fire
  flushed his swarthy face as he half swung round with a heavy gesture of his
  hand to his heart.</p>

  <p>"I do not know you," came my lord's grave young voice, "but it seems you
  are the man who has slandered me to the King and to the country."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I&mdash;yours is a great name, sir; not so great I could not
  drag it down&mdash;but this is your turn&mdash;these papers clear you and
  damn me."</p>

  <p>"Why did you do it?" asked the Duke. "What was I to you?"</p>

  <p>Martin Bampfield cast his eyes slowly round the wide chamber.</p>

  <p>"My father died in this room," he said.</p>

  <p>The Duke's beautiful mouth tightened.</p>

  <p>"My father was shot by your father in this room&mdash;that man I write to
  was there, and he described it to me often&mdash;to the figures here of
  Strength and Charity." He smiled sarcastically.</p>

  <p>"Your father was a rebel?" asked the Duke, very coldly.</p>

  <p>"My father was a patriot," said Martin Bampfield. "He was shot here, in
  this room."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"He was caught in the castle, he and this other man, and they were brought
  here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Spies," said my lord, shortly.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;and your father ordered them to be hanged as Cromwell's men; but,
  all unarmed as they were, they showed such fight that one escaped...and your
  father shot the other himself as he ran to the door."</p>

  <p>"Well?" said the Duke, haughtily.</p>

  <p>"Docs your lordship remember it now? It was before you were born, but I
  think some one told you the story of John Bampfield, preacher."</p>

  <p>"I have heard of the end of John Bampfield, spy," answered the Duke. "But
  I have not given it much thought."</p>

  <p>The other moved a step from the hearth.</p>

  <p>"Would you have done as your father did?"</p>

  <p>My lord slightly lifted his fair, level brows.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I thought so&mdash;I meant to bring you to the block&mdash;"</p>

  <p>My lord folded up the letter.</p>

  <p>"You are a false informer, a defamer of innocence, a man without honor or
  conscience&mdash;what can I do with such as you?"</p>

  <p>"It is very easy," said Martin Bampfield. "You hold your vindication and
  my ruin in your hand."</p>

  <p>"My lord rested his elbow on the table and took his chin in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Why did you wish those men sent from the room?"</p>

  <p>"Because I desired to settle this affair with you alone."</p>

  <p>The Duke did not alter his easy position; the austere calm of his
  youthfulness was in no way troubled; his eyes, wide and clear, held the other
  in a searching, steady look.</p>

  <p>"You speak as if there were a feud between us," he said.</p>

  <p>The prisoner came a step nearer the table.</p>

  <p>"There has been a feud between our families&mdash;always; you have not
  heard of it, belike, but we always hated each other, and in the Civil War it
  culminated...in this room. We are different in everything, in rank, in creed,
  in fortune...I am not what my father was, but what the times have made
  me&mdash;though at heart a republican always and vowed to vengeance on
  Papists, such as you. Listen to me&mdash;under the Lord Cromwell I was a
  great man, and your father was an exile in Flanders&mdash;then the slothful
  King came back for the curse of England, and your house rose again&mdash;the
  Earl became the Duke...died in court favor...and I&mdash;I changed with
  fortune. And so, forgotten, I worked against you and your proud name...the
  plot..."</p>

  <p>"Stop!" the Duke interrupted, imperiously. "This plot is a
  fabrication&mdash;you are telling me that?"</p>

  <p>Martin Bampfield smiled.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I tell you what you know&mdash;that the lies that exiled you
  here were of my making&mdash;as for the rest&mdash;I betray nothing."</p>

  <p>The Duke never moved.</p>

  <p>"You and your kind have sent innocent men to the block," he said.</p>

  <p>"There, God help me, would I have sent you, and never repented it."</p>

  <p>In the pause that followed was the insistent and mournful sound of the
  sea, the hurrying passage of the wind past the mullions, and the strong
  ripple of the flames on the hearth.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Martin Bampfield, "why do you not call those men in and say
  'Here is no Papist intriguing with France, but one of the coiners of the
  Plot&mdash;a Cromwellian, a republican&mdash;take him to London&mdash;to
  Tyburn.'"</p>

  <p>The Duke picked up the bunch of drooping violets and held them against his
  lips.</p>

  <p>"You have done me a great wrong," he said, coldly. "Perhaps the greatest
  wrong in any man's power to do another...you have disgraced me, covered my
  name with shame, broken my career at the beginning...it is strange you should
  have fallen into my power."</p>

  <p>Martin Bampfield moved back toward the fire.</p>

  <p>"Fortune lies with you again," he said, fiercely. "Make an end of
  it..."</p>

  <p>"I never harmed you," replied my lord. "I scarcely knew your name."</p>

  <p>The prisoner made an impatient gesture.</p>

  <p>"I am glad I did what I did&mdash;" he swung round abruptly. "I tell you,
  could I get my hand on one of those pistols I would burn that letter and
  shoot you, and lie, and lie, until your name was never cleared."</p>

  <p>My lord raised his head from his hand.</p>

  <p>"This hate is a strange thing&mdash;I think I hate you, Mr. Bampfield...a
  feud, difference of code, of King, of God&mdash;you are indeed hateful to
  me."</p>

  <p>He made a half-shuddering movement with his fair right hand.</p>

  <p>"What need for so many words!" demanded the prisoner, sullenly. "Send me
  to my death from the spot where my father was slain. Well, I may have
  stumbled from the altars where he worshipped. I shall find them again in the
  end, and I thank God, my lord, that I met you and told you what I had
  done."</p>

  <p>The Duke slightly frowned.</p>

  <p>"Why, this is very paltry&mdash;and yet, I think you are sincere, which is
  a marvellous thing...Our gods are indeed different, Mr. Bampfield."</p>

  <p>He still held the violets, and now laid them down beside the pistols at
  his elbow.</p>

  <p>"What are these?" He took up the other papers that were bound together
  with the long yellow silk strands.</p>

  <p>"Will not your Grace open them?" sneered the other. "You have the pistols
  and a bell at your elbow&mdash;if we were equally matched, they would be in
  the fire first."</p>

  <p>My lord looked at him keenly, and broke the silk.</p>

  <p>Various letters and papers fell out on to the table.</p>

  <p>At the sight of them the prisoner made a step forward.</p>

  <p>The Duke's delicate hand closed over one of the pistols.</p>

  <p>"As you remind me, I am armed," he said, while a faint flush overspread
  his features. "Keep your distance, sir."</p>

  <p>Martin Bampfield smiled bitterly.</p>

  <p>My lord looked at the documents; they were of varying degrees of
  importance; keys to cipher, accounts of meetings, lists of names, letters
  from Flanders, addresses of secret printing-presses, copies of
  prayers&mdash;much to incriminate the obscure, perhaps harmless
  plotter&mdash;nothing to clear the innocent accused.</p>

  <p>The young Duke looked up from his scrutiny,</p>

  <p>"You know better than most, Mr. Bampfield, that, in the state of ferment
  you have roused the country into, in the heat and confusion now existing,
  there is little judgment exercised, little mercy shown. The Popish bugbear is
  nearly dead&mdash;a reaction would claim much blood&mdash;do I make myself
  plain?</p>

  <p>"These papers of yours would set the mob on the Dissenters as it has been
  set on the Papists&mdash;there are a great many names here, Mr.
  Bampfield&mdash;" he looked in a straight, commanding way at the prisoner,
  who returned an insolent glance.</p>

  <p>"I and those others are in your power&mdash;need you enlarge on the theme?
  Call in those men&mdash;you have no cause to be tender with them nor to love
  me."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Bampfield&mdash;" my lord was gathering the papers together; he
  looked up abruptly. "Did you not desire those men from the room&mdash;did you
  request me to loosen your hands with no idea of these pistols?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe," smiled Martin Bampfield.</p>

  <p>My lord's eves were disdainful and mournful: his delicate and child-like
  face expressed a half-grieving judgment.</p>

  <p>"Have I clearly understood?" he said. "You, from hatred of my name, my
  creed, my class, my person, have forged the lies that make me a traitor and
  an assassin&mdash;you would have brought me to a dishonorable death&mdash;you
  avow this?"</p>

  <p>"I do avow it." answered Martin Bampfield. "Your father shot mine, and I
  would have caused your death very gladly."</p>

  <p>The Duke glanced at the alabaster bust; he had brought it from Italy; it
  represented St. George; serene, brave, youthful&mdash;the Church militant. My
  lord's name was George.</p>

  <p>"A Dutch vessel is waiting for your letter near the coast?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"For how long?"</p>

  <p>"Till daybreak."</p>

  <p>"Awaits a signal from you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;you need not ask me what it is."</p>

  <p>"I have no occasion to know," replied my lord. "That vessel will take no
  letter, Mr. Bampfield&mdash;it had better take a passenger."</p>

  <p>Through his speech was the steady sound of wind and sea, the fainter
  whisper of the fire as it burned to a clear red heart of liquid flame.</p>

  <p>The prisoner turned about; his nostrils were distended, he roughly bit his
  lower lip.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>My lord looked not at all at the man whom he addressed, but at the bust
  and the bunch of violets.</p>

  <p>"There are more ways than one from this castle&mdash;you had better leave
  before the Government men return."</p>

  <p>Again Martin Bampfield asked quickly:</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>The Duke rose, and lifted his eyes, still not to the prisoner, but to the
  portrait above the chimneypiece, between the figures of Strength and
  Charity.</p>

  <p>"You will be safe in Holland&mdash;more I cannot do for you. If you show
  yourself in London again&mdash;do not fear but I shall know of it&mdash;if
  you again defame the innocent, I shall speak."</p>

  <p>"Oh," said Martin Bampfield, half under his breath. "You mean that I am a
  free man?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And that I may go unmolested to the coast?"</p>

  <p>"Go and join the regicides in Flanders, the Calvinists at the
  Stadtholder's court, Mr. Bampfield. I think there is no longer a place for
  you in England."</p>

  <p>The prisoner came fiercely up to the table.</p>

  <p>"Why are you doing this?"</p>

  <p>"My reasons are not for your comprehension, sir&mdash;I would advise you
  to leave&mdash;at once."</p>

  <p>He pointed to the inner door by which he had himself entered.</p>

  <p>"In a few seconds you can be out of the castle&mdash;in a few moments by
  the sea."</p>

  <p>"Martin Bampfield drew himself up and half laughed.</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;are you a fool&mdash;is this a thank-offering for your
  vindication?"</p>

  <p>He pointed to the open letter lying before my lord.</p>

  <p>"Or are you hoping I shall refuse to go? But I never claimed to be a
  knight errant. I leave, and with no gratitude, my lord."</p>

  <p>With an uneasy, lowering defiance he swung toward the inner door.</p>

  <p>"One moment," said the Duke. Instantly, suspiciously, the other turned to
  face him.</p>

  <p>My lord, standing full in the gentle light of the silver lamp, looked very
  young, very slight, though he held himself with a grave loftiness.</p>

  <p>"Well!" demanded Martin Bampfield, savagely.</p>

  <p>"There are your properties," with a little sweep of his hand he indicated
  the table before him. "Take them."</p>

  <p>Martin Bampfield stared.</p>

  <p>"The papers?"</p>

  <p>"Your papers&mdash;yes."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;" he stammered, paused.</p>

  <p>"You will take them, Mr. Bampfield; they are of no use to me."</p>

  <p>Slowly the older man neared the table.</p>

  <p>"What game are you playing?" he asked, wiping his lips.</p>

  <p>"Ah," said my lord, a little wearily. "I pray you&mdash;haste."</p>

  <p>Martin Bampfield took up the packet.</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;you will be generous&mdash;but the letter?"</p>

  <p>"It is yours," said my lord, never moving from his erect position.</p>

  <p>"You know what it means to you?"</p>

  <p>The Duke smiled.</p>

  <p>"It means to me, sir, nothing&mdash;seen at Whitehall, it might mean
  something to you."</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I advise you to destroy it, Mr. Bampfield."</p>

  <p>For a moment they gazed at each other, then Martin Bampfield picked up the
  letter.</p>

  <p>"You think I will show it myself." He gave an unsteady, forced laugh.</p>

  <p>"I know you will not."</p>

  <p>"Well, you are right&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He crossed rapidly to the fireplace. "You will not snare me with your fine
  chivalry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>With his eyes watchfully on the Duke he east the letter on to the
  flames.</p>

  <p>The youth made no movement, and did not change his faint smile; Martin
  Bampfield stared at him, baffled.</p>

  <p>As the letter twisted into a blackened curl, he approached the table
  again.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand..." he began, thickly.</p>

  <p>"There is no need," answered my lord. "These also are yours." He pointed
  to the pistols lying before him.</p>

  <p>"The pistols?"</p>

  <p>"Your pistols, yes."</p>

  <p>Martin Bampfield hesitated.</p>

  <p>"You want..." he broke off. He bit his lip. "You mean me to take
  them?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I have no need of them."</p>

  <p>"You know...I would have killed you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I know."</p>

  <p>"Why are you giving me these pistols?"</p>

  <p>My lord's smile deepened.</p>

  <p>"Different breed, different creeds, Mr. Bampfield, as you said
  yourself."</p>

  <p>Martin Bampfield took up the weapons; my lord moved round the table and
  touched the silver bell behind St. George; then he lifted his eyes and looked
  at the other.</p>

  <p>There was just the table between them; Martin Bampfield slipped one pistol
  into his belt; he held the other and fingered the trigger: his mouth was
  working nervously and his heavy brows were drawn into a frown.</p>

  <p>The Duke moved from the table and went to the fireplace. He stood so, with
  his back to the room, holding out his hands to the clear glow of the
  fire.</p>

  <p>The little bracket-clock with the swinging weights struck the half-hour;
  the wind had abated and only called softly at the latticed panes.</p>

  <p>"Curse you," said Martin Bampfield, below his breath; he flung the pistol
  on the table.</p>

  <p>My lord looked round.</p>

  <p>The inner door opened to admit the secretary; his master gave him a little
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Marston, you will take this man to the coast, the quickest way that
  may be, and there leave him&mdash;I think, Mr. Bampfield, that will be
  convenient for you."</p>

  <p>The prisoner made no answer.</p>

  <p>"You will be secret," said my lord, "and as quick as may be. I shall miss
  your company&mdash;go armed&mdash;good-night, Mr. Bampfield."</p>

  <p>The secretary bowed. Martin Bampfield looked over his shoulder at my lord,
  clutched at the breast of his coat, frowned, and bit his lip.</p>

  <p>Something lingered on his tongue, curses or thanks; but the secretary
  touched him on the arm and the moment passed. With an awkward, sullen step
  and no backward glance he followed the young man from the room.</p>

  <p>As the door closed after them, my lord stepped up to it and slipped the
  finely wrought iron bolt.</p>

  <p>He stood for a moment looking over his shoulder with an absorbed
  expression in his eyes; then he crossed to the other door and opened it on
  the men waiting without.</p>

  <p>"Sirs." he said, courteously, "will you enter?"</p>

  <p>They came into the warm, pleasant glow of the fire and lamplight; seeing
  the prisoner was not there, the man from London gave a quick exclamation.</p>

  <p>"Sir," the Duke addressed him, "I have administered justice to that man in
  mine own fashion&mdash;he will not trouble England, nor need you think
  further of him."</p>

  <p>"He is gone?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Your Grace hath let him go?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"He was a plotter?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And those papers, my lord?"</p>

  <p>"Were of no consequence, sir."</p>

  <p>The man from London could not disguise his anger.</p>

  <p>"Before God, your Grace took something on yourself."</p>

  <p>My lord looked at him gravely.</p>

  <p>"So do you, sir, to speak to me in that manner."</p>

  <p>"It was my duty, my lord, to take that fellow to London."</p>

  <p>"You are absolved from it, sir."</p>

  <p>"You know what color this will have put upon it, my lord?"</p>

  <p>"I can imagine," said his Grace.</p>

  <p>"It will be believed that this man knew too much of your
  lordship&mdash;that those papers contained matter you were glad to hush up,
  and that you were glad to buy the silence of an accomplice&mdash;"</p>

  <p>My lord flushed as he answered:</p>

  <p>"In this district I am the law, sir. What is thought at Whitehall does not
  touch us now&mdash;I have no explanation to give save that the man was my
  enemy."</p>

  <p>"Your enemy?"</p>

  <p>"Sirs&mdash;I would he left to my own leisure."</p>

  <p>The man from London turned to the door; the other three were staring at
  the Duke.</p>

  <p>"Very well, my lord, very well," he said, angrily, "but this tale will
  brand you as a Papist plotter, You may believe me."</p>

  <p>He bowed to the slim youth by the table, who returned it with a grave
  inclination of his head, and with an air of anger left the chamber, his
  followers behind him.</p>

  <p>My lord, when the echo of their clumsy footsteps had died away, unbolted
  the inner door. Then he went to the window and lifted the dark curtain from
  the lattice.</p>

  <p>The new moon was riding through heavy clouds, casting black shadows over
  cliff, field, and tree, showing now and then the distant sparkle of the
  sea.</p>

  <p>My lord unlocked the casement, and opened it to the lonely night.</p>

  <p>The earth lay mysterious and rich beneath the white spaces of the
  tumultuous sky; it was cold, with fitful gusts of wind.</p>

  <p>My lord stood there, resting his head against the mullions, one hand to
  his breast, and smiling out upon the moon-scattered darkness until the quiet
  young secretary returned.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Mr. Marston&mdash;that is accomplished?"</p>

  <p>"The fellow left me, sir, and soon after I saw a boat put off from under
  the cliff," said the secretary. "He was an ungrateful churl. He sent this
  message to your Grace&mdash;" Mr. Marston hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Well?" My lord closed the window.</p>

  <p>"'Tell the Duke,' he said, 'that because he is a fool, the feud is not
  ended.'"</p>

  <p>The Duke was silent; the secretary looked at him with an intense
  curiosity.</p>

  <p>"My lord," he asked, abruptly, "this will go against you in
  London&mdash;why did you do it?"</p>

  <p>My lord drew a passionate breath. "Because I hated him," he said, quietly.
  "Even as my father must have hated his...in this room...I hate him. That is
  the reason, Mr. Marston."</p>

  <h2><a name="story7"
     id="story7"></a>VII. &mdash; THE INTRUDER</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Harper's Magazine</i>, February 1913</h3>

  <p class="first">AS she stood on the threshold of the home that was his and
  would soon (so soon!) be hers, her heart was filled with a noble
  happiness.</p>

  <p>She paused, with a delicate hesitation, delaying a moment of yet deeper
  joy that she might dwell on it with a longer delight, beside the ancient
  cypress that hugely overshadowed the long terrace, and looked at the
  beautiful outlines of Fordyce Hall. Turrets and gables, the work of different
  builders in different ages, showed dark and clear against an autumn sky of
  golden gray, and beyond the house miles of hushed wood and parkland swept to
  the misty horizon.</p>

  <p>Below the terrace where Ann Vereker stood, the gardens dipped in old and
  perfect arrangement of walk and fountain, rosary and quidnunc, arbor and
  bowling-green, The bright, large flowers of the late year glowed against the
  worn stone and the rich lawns; there was nothing to disturb the ordered
  loveliness that had been so wisely planned and so long-enduring. "And in this
  place I shall be his wife," thought Ann.</p>

  <p>She looked at him as he paused a few paces away from her; he stood in the
  shadow of the cypress, and was gazing past the gardens to the fair, open
  prospect beyond. She had never seen him in these surroundings before; always
  their background had been a town&mdash;London, Bath, the Wells, a fashionable
  world, gaiety, a crowd&mdash;the proper natural setting for those born to
  aristocratic ease. A country life was not the mode, and it had not seemed
  strange to Ann that Sir Richard made no suggestion of showing her his home
  until their betrothal was nearly at an end.</p>

  <p>Yet she had always longed for this moment, always wished to see him in the
  place where he belonged, where he was master&mdash;the place where he was
  born, and his fathers born before him back to the time of the first Norman
  king.</p>

  <p>It was more beautiful than she had expected, he was more completely one
  with this setting than she had pictured. Suddenly all the time they had spent
  together in London seemed wasted; she thought coldly of the town mansion that
  was being refurnished.</p>

  <p>"We will live here," she decided.</p>

  <p>She looked at the open door through which she had not yet passed, and then
  again at him.</p>

  <p>"Dick," she said, and her voice was low, "how long is it since you were
  here?"</p>

  <p>"Three years," he answered, quietly.</p>

  <p>"Why did you never bring me before?" asked Ann.</p>

  <p>He looked at her and seemed to brace himself.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my dear," he said&mdash;"my dear!" He raised his hand and let it fall
  as if dismissing a subject impossible of expression.</p>

  <p>She noticed then that he was unusually grave&mdash;she remembered that he
  had been grave ever since they had left her brother in the coach in obedience
  to her wish to see the place alone with him, and they entered the grounds
  together.</p>

  <p>"Did you think I would not care?" she asked. It occurred to her that
  perhaps he thought her frivolous&mdash;that perhaps he had not read her
  intense desire to take her position and future responsibilities seriously.
  Her sensitive, mobile face flushed; she leaned her slender figure against the
  warm, hard stone of the terrace and fixed her eyes on the house; she trembled
  with the desire to convey to him what she felt for this house of his and all
  the tradition it stood for. His race had bred fine, useful men and women; she
  wanted to tell him that she would be worthy of them.</p>

  <p>But he was so silent that her delicate desires were abashed. "Shall we go
  into the house?" she said.</p>

  <p>"Ah yes," he answered. "I hope, Ann, that you will like it," he added; and
  she smiled, for it seemed to her that his tone was a very formal one to be
  used between such complete friends and lovers as they were; but it did not
  displease her; she liked the surprises his moods afforded, she was even glad
  of his present gravity; she felt reserved herself in her own deep
  happiness.</p>

  <p>They walked along the terrace to the side door that stood open; the
  sunlight had parted the gray veil of clouds and lay lightly over the steps as
  Ann Vereker ascended them and entered Fordyce Hall.</p>

  <p>In accordance with her wish there were no servants to welcome them. "Let
  me be quite alone with you for the first time," she had said, and he had
  acceded to her whim without comment.</p>

  <p>She had always been exquisite in her observation and keen in her
  perceptions, and since she had met Richard Fordyce she had known the great
  sharpening of the senses a strong passion brings; colors, sounds, light, and
  perfume were now to her so many ecstasies, almost unbearable in their
  poignancy. And all that he now revealed to her&mdash;the fine corridors, the
  great dining-room, the ball-room, the old carving, the old painted ceilings,
  the old tapestries, the old furniture&mdash;gave her a pleasure that deepened
  to pain.</p>

  <p>In the deep oriel window his quarterings showed, and the bearings of the
  various heiresses who had at one time or another graced the name of Fordyce.
  In the dining-room hung the portraits of his ancestors, men and women who
  seemed strangely remote and aloof, and who yet shared his dear traits in
  their dark, masterful features. An atmosphere of loneliness and desertion
  hung heavy in these rooms, but that did not sadden Ann; she felt the place
  was stately with memories&mdash;chambers where so many had lived and died
  must convey this air of regret. She hushed her footsteps and her voice, and
  thought that this house peopled with shadows of past achievements would make
  a worthy background for a warm and living love.</p>

  <p>They had not gone above the ground floor when he led her to the great hall
  and state entrance, and, opening the portals that were stiff on their hinges,
  showed her the famous view across the woodland and river, that embraced three
  counties.</p>

  <p>She stood, with the soft airs blowing her nut-brown curls beneath the wide
  brim of her Leghorn hat, and gazed on the entrancing prospect. Directly
  before her, half concealed by a little belt of elm trees, was a squat Norman
  church.</p>

  <p>"Your church?" she questioned.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Sir Richard, "but it is the only church for the village,
  too&mdash;they come here on Sunday, but they marry and bury at Earl's
  Stanton, ten miles away."</p>

  <p>She touched his arm half timidly; he did not look at her, and a faint
  sensation of coldness on his part tinged her happiness with apprehension.</p>

  <p>"May I see the church now?" she asked, on a sudden impulse.</p>

  <p>"Whatever you wish, Ann," he answered.</p>

  <p>They crossed the open lawn and the broad drive and entered a green gate in
  a red wall which admitted them, not, as she expected, into the churchyard,
  but into a fruit garden that sloped down the side of a little hill.</p>

  <p>The fully ripe peaches and apricots hung amid the curling leaves on the
  sunburnt walls, and some had escaped the nets that held them and lay on the
  freshly turned earth, and clusters of St. Michael's daisies and sunflowers
  grew amid the plum and pear trees. Sir Richard crossed the end of the garden
  and opened another door in the farther wall; as he held it aside for Ann, she
  stepped past him and found herself among the graves.</p>

  <p>A few yew-trees rose in still darkness from the even grass that was
  scattered with the scarlet berries that fell from the somber boughs.</p>

  <p>The flat, discolored grave-stones were mostly in shade, but over those
  upright against the wall the misty sunshine fell in a dreamy radiance; above
  the wall the fruit-trees showed, and Ann noticed how the fruit had fallen and
  lay among the graves.</p>

  <p>An old man was trimming the grass; at sight of Sir Richard he took off his
  hat and stood respectfully at attention. Ann smiled at him; this place was
  sacred but not sad to her; she wondered why Sir Richard had arranged their
  marriage for a London church&mdash;she would like to have been married here
  where some day she would be buried&mdash;a Fordyce among her kin.</p>

  <p>They entered the church; it was small, old, sunken, and dedicated to a
  forgotten saint&mdash;Vedust. The painted glass in the windows was ancient
  and beautiful, the worn rood-screen had guarded the altar for two hundred
  years; there were some beautiful brasses in the chancel, and in the Lady
  Chapel a tomb in fair painted marble.</p>

  <p>One name was repeated on brasses and marble, the name of Fordyce; as Ann
  Vereker stood in a reverent attitude behind the altar she saw this word again
  and again on tomb and tablet with varying inscriptions and titles of
  honor.</p>

  <p>Among the newer mural tablets which showed white among the time-stained
  stones were those of his father, his mother, his sister. And, newest of all,
  one that made Ann catch her breath with a sense of shock.</p>

  <p>It was the small square of alabaster dedicated to the memory of his first
  wife. His first wife. Ann read the inscription:</p><br>

  <p class="smcap"
     style="text-align:center">Sacred to the Memory of Margaret,<br>
  Daughter of John Basinghall of Salop<br>
  and Wife of Richard Fordyce,<br>
  Baronet of Fordyce, Hampshire,<br>
  who died May 1725, aet. 23.</p><br>

  <p>Nothing else; no word of love or regret. Ann was glad that there was no
  parade of mock sentiment; she had been little in his life, Ann was
  convinced&mdash;he never spoke of her, and Ann had tried to forget her
  existence, had succeeded indeed in closing her mind to all thoughts of
  her&mdash;what was she but an incident to be forgotten&mdash;the wife of two
  years who had died without children. Yet standing here in the somber silence,
  Ann found herself forced to consider this woman. Somewhere near she was
  actually lying in her coffin. "Perhaps," thought Ann, "I am standing over her
  now."</p>

  <p>She turned to Sir Richard; his face was inscrutable, his figure dark in
  the shadows. "Were you&mdash;" she broke off, unable to form the words: she
  had wanted to ask him if he had been married in this church.</p>

  <p>It was suddenly horrible that he had ever been married before.</p>

  <p>She glanced at their pew, and saw that to sit there would be to sit in
  full view of this white tablet&mdash;"Sacred to the Memory of Margaret...Wife
  of Richard Fordyce&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How close the air is!" she said. "Shall we not go?"</p>

  <p>He moved away in silence, and they came together out of the hushed church
  into the hushed graveyard. The sun had withdrawn behind the increasing gray
  vapors and would be seen no more that day; the elms that half concealed the
  house were shaking in a little breeze, and the yellow leaves were drifting
  steadily down. The place <i>was</i> sad&mdash;sad with an atmosphere her
  happiness could not defy; the air had become chill, and she shivered in her
  silk coat.</p>

  <p>In the distance the old man was cleaning the moss from a headstone. It
  occurred to Ann that he had seen (many times!) this Margaret; she wished to
  stop and question him, for a great curiosity now pressed her about the woman
  whose existence she had hitherto been content to ignore&mdash;had this dead
  wife of his been dark or fair, sad or gay, beautiful or lovable?</p>

  <p>She had heard nothing of her, she was sure that she had been an
  insignificant personality, but she wanted to ask the old gardener and be
  certain.</p>

  <p>"How silent you are, Ann!" said Sir Richard.</p>

  <p>She looked up at him with a little start. "So are you," she smiled.</p>

  <p>"The day is overcast," he answered, "and a gloomy one in which to overlook
  an empty house."</p>

  <p>"But I will see the rest," she interrupted&mdash;"an empty house! Your
  home, Dick, and mine to be."</p>

  <p>"You like the place?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She wanted to say so much and words were so inadequate&mdash;she wished he
  would look at her. "I love every stone," she said, passionately.</p>

  <p>"We shall not be here much," replied Sir Richard, opening the gate.</p>

  <p>"Why not?&mdash;the place lacks a master."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it is old&mdash;and dreary&mdash;and in need of repair&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That can be altered," she smiled; in her heart she was wondering if he
  had trodden these churchyard grasses, or crossed the end of this fruit
  garden, since his first wife had died.</p>

  <p>She was sure he had not; no, nor entered the house. Were old memories
  holding him silent?&mdash;the thought tortured her; yet she tried to reason
  it away and to dispel this shadowy menace of Margaret Fordyce. She had always
  known that he had been married, and always been able to ignore it; in no way
  had it come between them. Why should it now?</p>

  <p>Yet the old perfect happiness did not return even when they had entered
  the house again together; the solemn atmosphere of the ancient church seemed
  to lurk in the quiet rooms; she could not people them with the sweet visions
  of her own future and his&mdash;it was the past that seemed to fill them, and
  when she mounted the wide, dark stairs she pictured Margaret Fordyce going up
  them in her bridal dress and being carried down them in her coffin.</p>

  <p>He took her to the armory, and she stood pale and thoughtful among the
  beautiful weapons with which the walls were lined; he showed her his father's
  sword, his own favorite weapon, and a light French rapier water-waved in
  gold.</p>

  <p>"Do you fence?" he asked, as he hung the rapier back next another of the
  same weight and length.</p>

  <p>"No," said Ann. He made no comment, but she knew now that his first wife
  had fenced with him&mdash;with those two rapiers, in this very room.</p>

  <p>They went into the picture-gallery, and she was blind to the beauty of
  painting and carving, for her eyes were straining, half guiltily, half
  fearfully, for a portrait of Margaret Fordyce.</p>

  <p>He showed her one after another of his ancestors, explaining their lives
  and actions, and when he came to the great picture of his father on
  horseback, with the taking of Namur in the distance, her heart was beating
  fast and her eyes searching furtively for a woman's face. But Margaret
  Fordyce was not there; yet Ann detected a bare space next to the likeness of
  Sir Richard's sister&mdash;as if, she thought, a painting had been hung there
  and removed.</p>

  <p>It seemed that it would have only been natural for her to ask for his
  first wife, but she could not, though she was aware that her remarks were
  vague and forced; he, too, seemed absorbed in some inner thought, and did not
  notice her distraction.</p>

  <p>As they came out from the picture-gallery on to the great stairs again she
  was struck anew by the chill and ominous atmosphere of the house. She
  regretted now her desire to have the house empty on her first visit; some
  servant or kinsman would have been a relief, some one who could have spoken
  casually and naturally of Margaret Fordyce.</p>

  <p>He showed her the paintings on the stairway, and they mounted higher into
  a region of silence and shadows. The windows were shuttered, the blinds
  drawn, and the furniture in linen covers.</p>

  <p>Without waiting for Sir Richard, Ann hurried through the first suite of
  rooms: she was looking still for some sign of Margaret, some portrait. These
  were&mdash;had been&mdash;a woman's rooms. Would she have to live in
  them?&mdash;to use this furniture, to gaze at herself in these mirrors?</p>

  <p>At the end of the suite was a locked door; she tried the handle with a
  sudden desperation, as if she expected to find the solution of some
  mystery.</p>

  <p>Sir Richard was quickly beside her. "There is nothing of interest there,"
  he said, quietly.</p>

  <p>She turned, and they looked at each other for the first time since they
  had entered the house together.</p>

  <p>"Why may I not go in?" asked Ann.</p>

  <p>"I did not forbid you," he said. He was pale but smiling; the expression
  of his face was so different from any that she had ever seen there before
  that he seemed to her for the moment a stranger.</p>

  <p>"I want to go in," she said, trying to smile too, but with a bitter
  sensation that everything was becoming ghastly and unnatural; she endeavored
  to struggle against this; she had been perfectly happy a few moments
  ago&mdash;and nothing had happened, she told herself; <i>nothing had
  happened</i>.</p>

  <p>"May I not see this room?" she asked, not knowing what impulse goaded her
  to insist.</p>

  <p>Without answering, he took a key from the pocket of his brocade waistcoat.
  He carried the key with him, then&mdash;perhaps all the while, ever since she
  had known him, he had had this key to the past next his heart.</p>

  <p>In silence he unlocked the door and in silence she entered. The chamber
  was small, the air close and oppressive; the first glance showed Ann that it
  was a lady's apartment, and that it had been locked away hastily, with every
  article untouched as the former occupant had left it. Beyond was another
  room, the door of which was half open; Ann could see a bed, with curtains of
  fine needlework, and a mirror covered with a white cloth.</p>

  <p>Dust was over everything; Ann could hardly fetch her breath; she unlatched
  one of the shutters, and the sad autumn light revealed the ruin wrought by
  time and neglect. Cobwebs clung round the windows, the gilt chairs were
  tarnished, dust lay gray and heavy in the folds of the curtains. On a side
  table was a bunch of flowers&mdash;changed to a little powder among the wired
  and faded ribbons of the bouquet; near it was a box of gloves half opened,
  the string and wrappings thrown carelessly down, the yellow, shriveled gloves
  unworn.</p>

  <p>In one corner of the room stood a harpsichord, open and covered with
  sheets of music, some of which had fallen to the floor. Beside this, standing
  against the wall, was a large picture in a dark frame, concealed by a red
  cloak flung over it.</p>

  <p>Ann was drawn by this picture to a forgetfulness of everything else, even
  to a forgetfulness of Sir Richard, who stood motionless on the threshold. She
  crossed the floor, and the boards creaked beneath her feet, a startled mouse
  sprang across her path and disappeared into the dark bedroom.</p>

  <p>She stooped and lifted the red cloak. A woman's face looked at her from
  the glowing canvas.</p>

  <p>A beautiful face, alive, alert, fair, and proud, with a peculiar
  triumphant smile on the lips. She was painted against a dark curtain and a
  glimpse of summer trees; her unpowdered hair was bound with a purple ribbon,
  and her brocaded dress was cut low over her jeweled bosom. The painting was
  stiff and precise, but marvelously lifelike and glowing in color.</p>

  <p>In the left-hand corner was written in white letters, "Margaret Fordyce,
  May, 1725"-the year, the month she died.</p>

  <p>Ann stepped back from the painting; her heart was beating thickly and the
  world was rapidly changing about her; she put out her hand and touched by
  chance the keyboard of the harpsichord, that gave forth a dismal and jangled
  sound that she echoed with a low and horrified cry. Sir Richard stepped into
  the room.</p>

  <p>"After three years," he said, looking round&mdash;"after three
  years&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What has happened?" murmured Ann. "What has happened?" She leaned weakly
  against the corner of the harpsichord and gazed still at that third presence
  in the room&mdash;the portrait of Margaret Fordyce.</p>

  <p>"Why did you not tell me?" she asked, faintly. He made no defense.</p>

  <p>"We are quite strangers," continued Ann.</p>

  <p>He turned his eyes on her, but still did not speak.</p>

  <p>"How did she die?" asked Ann.</p>

  <p>"She was flung from her horse...on her birthday&mdash;she was wearing that
  cloak."</p>

  <p>"Why did you not tell me?" repeated Ann Vereker.</p>

  <p>"I thought&mdash;I hoped&mdash;" he broke off.</p>

  <p>"You loved her," said Ann.</p>

  <p>He stumbled to the bouquet and fingered the ruins of the roses.</p>

  <p>"This is as she left it," said Ann. "You shut it away as she left
  it&mdash;but she is still here. In this room. In this house. In the church.
  How she must laugh at me!"</p>

  <p>He stared at her.</p>

  <p>"She called you. You could not help coming here&mdash;even though it meant
  bringing me. I was to help you forget."</p>

  <p>The triumphant face on the canvas seemed to deepen its disdainful
  smile.</p>

  <p>"You will never forget," continued Ann. "You love her."</p>

  <p>"She is dead," said Sir Richard, and he braced his shoulders with the
  action of a man who endeavors to shake off the oppression of a hideous dream.
  "Dead. Dead."</p>

  <p>"She is here," repeated Ann.</p>

  <p>Sir Richard turned his eyes fearfully, hungrily to the portrait. "Oh,
  God!" he said, sharply.</p>

  <p>"This is tragedy," thought Ann. She seemed dull in a dull world; she
  looked across the harpsichord and noticed that the rain was falling aslant
  the dry leaves on the withered trees outside. When last the sun shone she had
  been supremely happy. What had happened?</p>

  <p>Nothing...save that she had seen the portrait of Margaret Fordyce.</p>

  <p>She had loved him so sincerely, and he had used this love of hers as an
  opiate&mdash;and now the other woman triumphed.</p>

  <p>"Dick," she said, in a hopeless voice, "I am going."</p>

  <p>He did not answer; the painted figure seemed to step from the frame and
  dominate both of them. Before her beauty, her assurance, Ann felt
  insignificant, a creature who did not matter.</p>

  <p>Sir Richard picked up one of the faded white gloves and sank onto the
  tarnished chair; he looked at the portrait, and Ann knew that the last three
  years had rolled away for him. He belonged to the other woman.</p>

  <p>Ann Vereker, the intruder, left him with his wife and went away
  forever.</p>
