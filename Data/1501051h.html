<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="caption">What is Papua?&mdash;The tropical
martyr&mdash;How not to see Queensland&mdash;Bêche-de-mer&mdash;The
inevitable "B.P."&mdash;The history of Papua&mdash;Port
Moresby.</p>

<p>LIKE everybody else, I thought New Guinea belonged to England;
that it was a most ungetatable place; that it was inhabited almost
solely by the fiercest cannibals in the world; that it was so
unhealthy as to be called the "White Man's Grave," and that there
was nothing worth having there except Birds of Paradise.</p>

<p>Even after spending some months in the New Hebrides, which are
not many hundred miles removed from the great island continent of
Papua, I did not know much more about New Guinea than I had known
in my schoolroom days at home. The countries of the Pacific world
are separated from each other with a completeness undreamed of in
Europe. The New Hebrides know nothing of New Guinea. The Fijis are
ignorant of the New Hebrides. The great central groups&mdash;Cook
Islands, Tonga, Samoa&mdash;tell fairy tales of Fiji, and believe
the Solomons to be something like the end of the world. If you want
to get from one to the other, there is only one way as a
rule&mdash;take ship (when you can get it) to Sydney, or possibly
to Auckland and thence to Sydney, a little round of a couple of
thousand miles or so&mdash;then, from Sydney, take ship again (if
there is one to be had) for the group you wish to visit. It is
quite possible you may have to travel four or five thousand miles,
and spend two or three months in traversing a distance that is only
eight or nine hundred as the crow flies. That is the joke of
Pacific travel. It is well for you if you can see the humour of
it.</p>

<p>Of course, I had heard tales of New Guinea in the "Islands."
There was a trader in Niué&mdash;may he see this, and be
ashamed!&mdash;who recounted to me some of his amazing experiences
up the Fly River. "I was purser of a passenger steamer on the
river," he said, "and I assure you it was really painful to see
some of the passengers we took up. There's gold in the Fly, you
know&mdash;it's found sticking among the roots of the mangroves, in
those deadly river swamps&mdash;and prospecting parties go out to
get it. We used to find the remnants of them later on, yellow-faced
skeletons staggering out of the swamps and waving a quinine bottle
full of gold dust at us, to get a passage anywhere away from the
place. We took up one party of fourteen, and afterwards brought
back three&mdash;all that were left."</p>

<p>A striking anecdote, well told...Four years later, when I had
been up some of the great New Guinea rivers, had seen a good deal
of the country, and realised in what stage of civilisation it
stood, the tale appeared more striking yet. If there are passenger
steamers running on the Fly in twenty years' time from now, the
Government will consider itself fortunate. If there is ever any
gold found on the river, it will consider itself more fortunate
still. And if the gold so far departs from all known geological and
metallurgical laws as to be found conveniently sticking in the
roots of the trees that stand in deep water and are daily washed by
strong tides, the whole country will no doubt make pilgrimages to
the shrines of the Blessed D'Albertis and Saint William Macgregor
to offer up thanks for a special miracle.</p>

<p>What really drew my attention to New Guinea as a place where
people did go and did live was (paradoxically enough) a
death&mdash;the suicide in 1904. of the Chief Judicial Officer, who
was temporarily in charge of the country. The tale of that wretched
and unnecessary disaster will be told in another place. Its effect
upon the country at large (strange to say) was not exactly
disastrous. All over the world flashed the startling news that the
"Governor of British New Guinea" had committed suicide&mdash;had
shot himself dead in front of Government House, at the foot of the
flagstaff that carried his country's flag. Such a sensational
incident was bound to attract attention to the colony, and it did.
To the ordinary citizen it did not cast any discredit on
Papua&mdash;people committed suicide everywhere&mdash;for various
reasons; but it made him wonder where and what British New Guinea
was, and occasionally induced him to look it up in a library. The
seed thus sown bore fruit later on in assisting settlement.</p>

<p>Like the other ignorant persons, I went to a library and began
to read up New Guinea. I found out some astonishing things. First
of all, England did not own the country. Holland had a liberal half
of it, and Germany a quarter. Our share looked very small till one
began to compare it scale for scale with European countries, and it
then appeared, amazingly enough, to be twice as big as England.</p>

<p>The scenery was said to be very fine, and the bird and insect
life wonderful. For the rest, the books told of cannibals and
crocodiles, fevers and snakes and swamps, unexplored rivers,
unknown mountains. It sounded interesting, but calculated to give
the unescorted woman wanderer food for rather serious thought.</p>

<p>Still&mdash;how can one put it without offending a number of
excellent writers and worthy travellers&mdash;still, I was
conscious of a doubt somewhere, like the lady in <i>Hard Times</i>
who could not exactly say she had a pain, but thought there was a
pain somewhere in the room. I did not think the writers lied. But I
had been to various queer places on the surface of earth and sea,
and never found them just what they were represented to be. It was
clear that New Guinea could not be worse than it was made out. It
was equally plain, therefore, that it might be better.</p>

<p>Not until November, 1907, did I get a chance of finding out for
myself. At that time, other engagements being cleared away, and
much talk about British New Guinea being in the air, after its
recent transfer to Australian government under the title of "The
Territory of Papua," I somehow found myself saying good-bye to
friends who evidently regarded the occasion as the next thing to a
funeral on board an A.U.S.N. steamer at an obscure Sydney
wharf&mdash;luggage labelled "Port Moresby."</p>

<p>And thereafter came ten days of pure happiness.</p>

<p>The routes to New Guinea are not nearly so long or so out of the
way as one supposes, looking at the isolated position of the
country. After you end your luxurious P. and O. voyage of five
weeks from Marseilles, you may be in Port Moresby in ten days if
you go through with the mails, taking train part of the way. If you
go by A.U.S.N. and Burns Philp boat, you will be there in a
fortnight, travelling along the coast of Queensland. If you take
the Burns Philp through steamer by the Solomon Islands, you will be
three weeks on the road. Each route, in its way, is fascinatingly
interesting, but perhaps the best for the absolute "new chum" is
the Queensland coast way, as it allows the seven times wonderful
land of Papua to produce its full impression, undimmed by the
strange sights and experiences met with travelling through the
Solomons.</p>

<p>The cut of a sleeve or a skirt, the fastening of a tie, changes
not more surely with the years than does the cut of a prevailing
emotion. In Goldsmith's day the traveller was of necessity more or
less an exile. He might&mdash;no doubt he frequently
did&mdash;enjoy himself extremely, and much prefer foreign
countries to his native land. But it was not the fashion to speak
or to feel after such a cosmopolitan style, and the
eighteenth-century wanderer was inexorably constrained to sing his
wanderings in a minor key.</p>

<p>His grandson, in the early days of railways, was content to
regard the continent of Europe as an entirely delightful
playground. Tropical climates, however, were his especial terror.
African explorers who suffered unheard-of things from sunstroke and
wild beasts&mdash;Indian officials who became "nabobs" and acquired
diseased livers, both in accordance with some mysterious law of
nature&mdash;represented to him the only connection with the torrid
zones that was known or possible. Nobody went to the lands of
monsoons and man-eaters for pleasure, and only the most amazing
discoveries or the biggest possible fortunes could compensate
anyone for the hardships that must of necessity be faced.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that this idea dies hard, and though
moribund, is not yet ready for its coffin. People in general will
allow that there is pleasure in seeing the wonderful East and the
amazing South&mdash;that one may indeed live near the Line for a
few years, if compelled to do so&mdash;but the convention of
hardship and horror still lingers. There is something dreadful
about the tropics. The heat is a ceaseless torture. The wild beasts
and reptiles arc a constant danger. The natives are always ready to
murder you. The gorgeous scenery may be all very well, much as a
painted belle in a ballroom is good to look at; but one would give
a thousand miles of the one, or the other's whole battery of
charms, for a simple green English lane with a primrose in it, or a
smile from an innocent country lass...</p>

<p>Which is all very pretty, and calculated to draw approving
murmurs from the gallery. But it does not happen to be true. A good
many men, if put on oath, would be obliged to acknowledge that they
find the society of the finished belle more amusing than the
bread-and-milk conversation of the provincial young woman. A good
many people who keep putting off the purchase of that saloon
single, outside, amidships ticket that will open the gate of the
country lane and silence the whisper of the starlight-silvered
palms for ever, would have to tell you, were they sworn to truth,
that the tropic world is almost wickedly fascinating, and that they
fear they will feel a little out of place&mdash;just at first, of
course&mdash;when they go home to stay...But then what becomes of
the heroism, the wonder, the distinction, of living in the lands
that to "most people" are only a geographical expression for
something perilous and unpleasant?</p>

<p>No, it is time that somebody really told the truth about these
wicked tropics; that the augurs who have resided in Calcutta or
Colombo, Townsville, Cooktown, or Fiji, Buenos Ayres, Barbados, or
Singapore, should cease to wink at one another when they meet in
London drawing-rooms and hear each other relating frightful tales
of suffering and deprivation...Here, on the big comfortable
Australian steamer, with warmer and warmer breezes blowing in upon
the dainty sea-blue curtains and cushions and cool white enamelled
panelling, every day&mdash;with a keener, more crystalline sun
dancing each morning on the waveless sea that lies inside the Great
Barrier Reef&mdash;with clean white clothes coming out all over the
ship, and passengers' mattresses mysteriously appearing like
night-blooming flowers upon the promenade decks when the moon gets
up&mdash;with a sense of lazy ease and hurry-no-man's cattle
drifting down on each of us like a blessing sent by Marconigraph
from the gods of Cancer and Capricorn&mdash;here, going north and
north and north along immense Australia, to the countries of the
crocodile and the palm once more, the passengers look like nothing
in the world less than martyrs.</p>

<p>One must confess that it is more or less the fashion to complain
of one's lot, even among these contented-looking beings. It seems
that there is a famine of theatres, music-halls, and races in the
hot countries; that you have to do your shopping by steamer, and
only get your newspapers at intervals. You see too much of the same
small set of people. There is not enough of variety in the food.
The mosquitoes are troublesome...It is exactly the same tone of
complaint, somewhat varied in the arrangement of the notes, that
one has heard in London, in America, in every corner of the earth
where necessity compels men to earn their bread under conditions
short of Paradise...One seems to remember, too, that the catering
and the amusements did not satisfy, even in the original
garden.</p>

<p>All the same, the passengers are quite evidently "going back to
Dixie," and not sorry to go.</p>

<p>The way to see Queensland&mdash;if you are not going to see
it&mdash;is to travel up the coast on an A.U.S.N. boat, bound for
Papua. No qualms of conscience as to mines unvisited, rising
pastoral districts unseen, brand-new town-halls unadmired, beset
the steamer traveller who has no intention of doing Australia's
second largest and most interesting State otherwise than by lazily
looking on as he is carried past. Like Harold Skimpole, who could
lie on the rug before a good fire, imaginatively travelling up an
African river, and "seeing the wonderful forms of the foliage just
as clearly as if he were really there," we lie in our deck chairs
day after day, absorbing iced drinks and novels, imagining the
mines and the herds of cattle, and looking up now and then to note
a new stretch of exquisite heliotrope-coloured hills, rising away
in the distance behind a coast of creamy gold, or to see a fresh
archipelago of little bright green islets rising out of a sea that
is rich blue without the reef, warm aquamarine within. And still
the endless coast goes on. And still, day by day, we come to baking
little towns with verandahed tin-roofed stores and houses, and
great hotels that are evidently the resort of thousands of square
miles of townless country. And we stop to take up cargo or
passengers, to bring all the latest news and mails, and to give the
people a change (strange reversal of the eager rush for news and
diversion from ship to shore, in the busy ports of the Old World!
). And each of the towns is <i>the</i> rising town of Queensland,
though all look like one another.</p>

<p>But at Rockhampton, if my memory does not lie (perhaps it
does&mdash;I was not seeing Queensland), the first of the palms is
met with, a mere handful of dusty and unhappy feather-brooms:
still, a landmark of importance. And at Cairns you get out and go
to the hotel for a night, and do not go to see the Barron Falls,
and feel all the pleasure of one who boldly and shamelessly sins,
without the guilt. But you walk about the town, and think that
there is nothing in it so interesting as the stuffed blue-helmeted
cassowary in a back-street shop-window...Somehow, until now, you
had not realised that there were actual cassowaries anywhere except
upon the plains of Timbuctoo; it is astonishing to know that in
Papua, where you are going, there are plenty of them, and to see
for yourself that they look quite tall enough to eat any member of
the L.M.S. or the Methodist Mission who might happen to incur their
displeasure&mdash;not forgetting the "hymn-book too."</p>

<p>Bêche-de-mer cutters and schooners abound on the Great Barrier
Reef, and we see them almost every day. The bêche-de-mer has long
been known as a dainty to the Chinese, than whom there are no finer
cooks in the world, but it is only of late years that Europeans are
beginning to realise they have missed something in dismissing this
hideous sea slug as uneatable. Once taste bêche-de-mer soup in a
Queensland hotel or private house where they know how to make it,
and you will never say thank-you for turtle again.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of bêche-de-mer, varying in size, in
colour, and in value. About thirty pounds a ton (dried) is the
price of the worst grades. The better grades sometimes rise as high
as two hundred. The process of collecting is simplicity itself. The
slugs live in the shallow water of the coral reefs, and are picked
up by the native employees of the boat-owners without any trouble
of hunting or catching. They are boiled, cleaned, smoked for
twenty-four hours, and then sold to the large exporting dealers at
so much per ton. On the enormous stretches of the great Barrier
Reef the supply is practically limitless, and a good deal of money
is made by lucky traders. I heard a talc at Cairns of two Sydney
clerks who got tired of their work, and being smart boatmen, as
nearly all Sydney young men are, ran a cheap cutter that they had
bought right up the Australian coast to the reef. A few black
"boys" were engaged at a trifling wage, a curing hut put up on an
uninhabited island, and in a few months the two enterprising
tape-measurers had made several hundred pounds...Does not the heart
of the English clerk wax faint with envy for the opportunities of
his Australian brother? If any couple of Mr. Peter Robinson's young
men could only go away and make a little fortune in the summer
holidays, catching and drying bloaters off the Yarmouth coast, how
many young men learned in "the" ribbons, and tactful with "the"
haberdashery, would Mr. Peter Robinson have? Just as many as Mr.
Farmer or Mr. Hordern of Sydney, no doubt. He that will to Cupar,
maun to Cupar: the man who was cut out by nature for a manly life
will find it, if it lies in Yarmouth or Yucatan, while the man whom
an all-wise Providence has intended for the safe and the gentle
life, will not stray beyond the limits of his fourpenny tram for
all the songs of all the sirens in the seven seas of the world.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>We came into Cooktown, which is very far away indeed, and a long
distance past the railway world, in ten days after leaving Sydney.
I have not forgotten to tell about Brisbane, which I saw and loved,
and went back to by and by, but have deliberately left it out,
because it is dangerous to begin talking seriously about anything
in Queensland if one does not want to be led into writing a book
about it. Queensland is so&mdash;I said I would not&mdash;but it
really is most&mdash;well, go and see something of it for yourself;
even if you can only visit Brisbane, which in itself is...Please
change the subject.</p>

<p>We came into Cooktown, as I said, and disembarked, for the
coastal steamer goes no further, and one must here take one of the
boats of the wild and wicked Burns Philp Line to make one's way on
to Papua. I do not mean to cast any aspersions upon the spotless
reputation of this excellent, pawky, pious Scotch-Australian
shipping firm, nor upon the behaviour of anyone who lives upon, or
travels by, its ancient but hardy vessels. One instinctively calls
them wild and wicked, however, as one used to call the plains of
Western America wild and woolly, because of the prevailing
character of the surroundings of the line. B.P.'s boats go nowhere
that is settled, nowhere that is civilised, nowhere devoid of the
local colour furnished by the gentle cannibal (he really is
gentle), and the modest head-hunter, and the coy crocodile. Their
captains and officers have one and all lived lives of adventure
that would make the most lurid of blue-and-yellow twopenny
dreadfuls on a cheap tobacconist's counter read like a kindergarten
baby prize. Because of this, they are very quiet and rather blasé
people as a rule, not intensely interested in anything, and usually
ambitious of growing beans for Sydney market gardens, or living in
a bungalow up the Hawkesbury River, and taking in boarders
when&mdash;or if&mdash;they get old.</p>

<p>The firm are keen traders, and the ships generally go out of
port staggering with cargo. It is all prosaic enough to "B.P.'s"
own people no doubt, but travellers from far countries cannot help
having an idea that there is something quite romantic in making
your money out of pearl-shell and pearls and sandalwood and cedar,
even out of bêche-de-mer and cocoanuts&mdash;not to mention
ivory-nuts, tortoise-shell, dried fungus, and half a score other
odd products about which most people know nothing. There is always
vivid local colour on a "B.P." boat, quite apart from the
extraordinary places into which she is sure to take you. She will
have native boats' crews&mdash;half-tamed savages who dress in a
rag and a dozen necklaces, and do war-dances on the afterdeck in
the moonlight; there will be yam and turtle and other strange foods
among the dishes at the ordinary saloon meals; you are almost sure
to have an explorer among the passengers and a gold prospector or
two, and a queer, dead-silent or devastatingly talkative trader
from the back of nowhere, who has been half-eaten by sharks,
crocodiles, or natives at least a dozen times, and who has been so
long restricted to the three classes of society above mentioned,
that he has almost lost taste for any other. And as you near the
New Guinea coast...</p>

<p>But how careless to have left out Cooktown! Where Captain Cook
once made a call, eventually to be commemorated by a statue that
got as far as the pedestal many years ago, and seems likely to stop
there&mdash;where there is a large street, and two rows of shops,
and several hotels that introduce you to the unpleasing Australian
custom of penning guests in scores of iron tanks or cubicles, all
under one hot iron roof&mdash;where the mango trees grow in a
splendid double avenue all down the street as big as English
beeches, and hang out tantalising green ovoid fruits that will be
ripe in just a few days&mdash;after we have sailed; where you can
go driving in the dust, and see many low mountains covered with
grey-green eucalyptus, and many immense anthills, fifteen feet high
and more, just like the pictures in the geography books...Well, one
cannot go back, and it is two days since we left Cooktown now, and
we must all get up early to-morrow morning, for at daylight we
shall be in sight of New Guinea.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The "new chums" are very busy absorbing information, this last
evening, and, like most travellers, they know a good deal more of
local history by this time than the residents of the place. We have
been looking things up on the A.U.S.N. steamer, more or less, but
the extraordinary prevalence of the alligator story along the whole
Queensland coast leaves little room for general reading or
conversation. As every traveller knows, the shark story dominates
most tropic liners; the alligator story is certainly a welcome
change, but neither the one nor the other satisfies the hunger we
feel for minute information about the country we are going to
see.</p>

<p>As the <i>Makambo</i> ploughs along to-night over a calm, dark,
hot sea, with thunder somewhere very near us, and phosphorescent
gleams twinkling about the bows, one of the voyagers, at all
events, seated in a quiet corner of the deck, is thinking seriously
enough about this strange island-continent lying unseen upon our
beam, and wondering how it is that in these days of universal
exploration, when the secrets of South America are almost all told,
and even Central Africa and Central Asia have little more to give,
New Guinea should still flaunt defiance in the face of all
research. There have been numberless exploring parties, but not one
has done all that it set out to do, though each has added a little
to our knowledge of the interior. Not a single one of the great
rivers has been traced to its source. Most of the high mountains
have not been ascended. No one knows what lies in the great blank
spaces of the Western Division of Papua. In fact, the greater part
of the country is a riddle still unread...Why?</p>

<p>I leave the reason to disclose itself later on, and return to
the information that I have been collecting out of various books
owned by passengers and officials.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust01" id="illust01"></a><img src=

</p>

<p>New Guinea, these tell me, was discovered in 1511 by Antonio de
Abrea. The great archipelagoes of islands lying to the south and
east were not discovered until the end of the eighteenth century,
by D'Entrecasteaux and other French navigators. It is amazing, but
true, that the whole eastern end of the country remained unmapped
and unknown, no one being able to say where the great "tail" of New
Guinea came to an end until so late as 1873, when a British
man-of-war charted it out.</p>

<p>England, in the person of her more enlightened statesmen and
commanders, made no less than three attempts to secure a footing in
New Guinea. In 1793 the whole country was annexed by officers of
the East India Company, and an island in Geelvink Bay was used as a
residence for British troops. The Government of the day, however,
refused to ratify this wise and far-seeing act. In 1873 Captain
Moresby annexed some of the islands at the eastern end of the
country. This too was disapproved, although by now the Dutch had
been in possession of the whole western half of the country for
generations. In 1883 a still more determined attempt to benefit the
home country against its will was made by the late Sir Thomas
M'Ilwraith, Premier of Queensland. This able statesman, alarmed by
the rumour of German annexation, and rightly fearing to see a
foreign Power established in a country not a hundred miles from the
Australian coast, annexed the eastern half of the country, and
asked in terms of the greatest urgency for a ratification of his
action from the Home Government.</p>

<p>It was refused. Lord Derby, at that time Premier, was opposed to
the idea of colonial expansion, and considered the Queensland
Minister's fears of German aggression to be unfounded. He did not
hesitate to say so in a biting phrase that must have come back to
his memory a year later, when Germany actually did take possession
of a good half of the open territory and of the better part of the
Solomon Islands. On this the British Government so far relented as
to allow the "protection" of the remaining portion if the
Australian Government would guarantee £15,000 a year towards
expenses. Under this arrangement the country remained a dead weight
upon the hands of all concerned for four years, after which it was
annexed to the British Crown, and for seventeen years simply went
to sleep. It is a little hurtful to one's national pride, but must
in justice be admitted, that British administration of the country
was not a success, and that the Australian Government, short as its
time has been, has, on the contrary, been conspicuously
successful.</p>

<p>Concerning various administrators who held the reins of British
New Guinea between 1884 and 1906, it can only be said that one and
all systematically, determinedly, and successfully resisted all
attempts towards opening up and developing the country. I do not
say this as a stranger to Papua&mdash;the truth had not even dawned
on me that night when I sat on deck and conned over the few
geographical facts that I had been able to gather. I say it after a
residence of a year and a half in the country, after meeting almost
every white person in it, seeing every division, and travelling
into every part attainable without an exploring
expedition&mdash;after seeing and talking to the men who know the
history of Papua, here and in Australia, and after reading for my
own information a mass of papers, reports, and general literature
dating back nearly thirty years.</p>

<p>This, then, is, or was, the reason of New Guinea's apparent
uselessness and inaccessibility. Difficult though the country is to
the traveller&mdash;seriously as development has been handicapped
by hostile natives, local fevers, want of proper roads&mdash;not
one, or not all, of these dead-weights has pressed down the balance
half so far as the real clog and hindrance&mdash;the fact that
Papua's rulers wished to keep the place shut up.</p>

<p>There are two sides to every question. Some of those who held
the destiny of the country in their hands were moved in their
exclusive policy by an honourable wish to secure the welfare of the
native. It really seemed to them that this could best be done by
keeping out the white man, except in so far as he was represented
by missionaries. They feared that planters, miners, traders, would
corrupt the simple Papuan, and that a rapid influx of white
population would deprive the native of his lands and condemn him to
slavery.</p>

<p>A frivolous little volume of Barry Pain's, published some year
ago, contained a sentence that deserved wider quotation than it has
received&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bear with me, dearest, for being no more than I am. Many people
are no more than they are, and one has to put up with it."</p>

<p>One must bear with even a well-meaning Colonial Administrator
for being no more than he is. It was not the fault of these
gentlemen&mdash;some of them honest and worthy men&mdash;that they
were no more than they were&mdash;that they thought a valuable
colony could and should be kept in the pocket of anyone; that they
were so tender of the man-eaters' morals as to desire to keep them
eternally unspotted from the contact of vile coffee planters; that,
travelling through the known parts of the country, and even
discovering many new districts, month by month, they should walk
through the land with their eyes shut and not see millions upon
millions of acres of splendid country lying waste and unclaimed;
and that the possibility of guarding the natives from enslavement
by means of laws never seems to have occurred to these curiously
short-sighted law-givers.</p>

<p>It was not their fault, perhaps. Still, seeing what Australian
methods and government have done for the country in less than four
years after we had successfully spoiled it for over twenty, one
cannot help regretting that British rule enjoyed quite so long a
run.</p>

<p>But, as the early Victorian novelist used to say, after
designedly giving away the chief interest of his plot, "I am
anticipating," and must return to the <i>Makambo.</i></p>

<p>It was a disappointment on rising at a comparatively early hour
next morning to find the great peaks of the Owen Stanley Range
invisible. An endless pale blue coast, thin and unsubstantial in
the heat, lay stretched out along our port beam. There were hills
behind it, but a thick mantle of cloud covered them all. We could
only imagine the splendid cone of Mount Yule, rising ten thousand
feet straight into heaven, the gradual slopes and scarps of Mount
Victoria's majestic thirteen thousand feet, the astonishing humps
and domes of the smaller seven or eight thousand feet mountains
nearer the coast. Here and there, as the steamer plodded steadily
along the great equatorial island, one would catch just a glimpse
of a whitey-blue summit, very far away and amazingly high up, or
see the rise of some long range of foothills leading away and
away...whither?</p>

<p>The nameless charm of Papua&mdash;the fascination which many
have felt but none can express&mdash;first lays its compelling hand
upon the traveller when he looks at such scenes as these, and knows
for a certainty that his eyes are resting upon hills unprofaned by
the white man's foot&mdash;upon lands where "no one has been;" upon
rivers, known and navigated indeed in the lower reaches, but rising
from mystery, and taking their growth in the unseen. The plantation
country, with its busy hordes of labourers, its comfortable
managers' bungalows, its loads of coffee and fibre and copra coming
down to meet the steamers, takes on actual romance viewed against
this background of the ever-fascinating unknown. Scarce a dainty
arm-chaired verandah but looks out upon mountain ranges that shut
in unvisited mystery; scarce a trader or miner but goes every now
and then, in the course of his ordinary work, to the verge of the
"Never Never," and sometimes even beyond; hardly a creek supplying
water to the horses and baths to the plantation house which does
not carry in its heart secret on secret of the strange places
whence it has come. Much exploration has been done of late, bit by
bit, after a quiet, unadvertised fashion, by the Government
officials of the outermost districts, by miners and prospectors,
and by a few of the missionaries of the Sacred Heart, who have the
true pioneering spirit. But so much remains quite unknown, that one
may safely prophesy it will be very many years yet before Papua
loses the greatest of its charms&mdash;mystery.</p>

<p>The continent, or island, of New Guinea is nearly 1500 miles
long, its greatest width being 430 miles. Its entire area is
estimated at 235,000 square miles. In spite of the huge piece
claimed by the Dutch and the goodly section belonging to Germany,
England has no reason to complain of her share, since it amounts to
90,540 square miles, nearly 88,000 of which are on the mainland,
the rest being made up of islands. The British-owned section is in
many ways superior to German New Guinea. It is long and
narrow&mdash;800 miles from east to west, and from 200 to So in
width, its coastline being proportionately very great&mdash;3664
miles.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust02" id="illust02"></a><img src=
"1501051h-images/TNNG-02.jpg" alt="Cattle Raised in Papua" title=
"Cattle Raised in Papua">
</p>

<p>It is easy to understand, from a glance at the map, that Papua
must be much more readily accessible, and less troublesome and
expensive to open up, than either of the foreign-owned sections.
This impression is carried out by the actual facts. Both Dutch and
German New Guinea are less known, less developed, less effectively
controlled than Papua. Our share is, indeed, more valuable in many
ways. To mention one or two only&mdash;the mineral resources of the
country are richer, the pearl fisheries are more valuable, and the
great extent of seaboard offers perfect facilities for cultivating
the cocoanut, which, in the form of "copra" or dried kernel, is one
of the most important products of Australasia.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that the name&mdash;the new name&mdash;of
the English-owned section is a little confusing. In our childish
days we were taught to think of the largest island of the world as
"Papua, or New Guinea." It is indeed marked as such on most maps.
But when the part known as British New Guinea was taken over by the
Commonwealth Government in 1906 it became necessary to find a new
name, and the country was rechristened "The Territory of
Papua"&mdash;much as though a foreign Power were to take possession
of Ulster or Connaught and insist on calling it "Ireland." The
result, of course, has been confusion outside of Australia. Few
people at home know that "British New Guinea" no longer exists, and
the term "Papua" means, to the English reader, either the whole
country or (if it is qualified by the addition of "New Guinea")
some small obscure portion of which no one has ever heard. It
certainly does not mean the "British New Guinea" of which he has
probably heard something from time to time.</p>

<p>This trouble will no doubt set itself right in a few years.
There is at least one strong argument for the name adopted. If
"Australian New Guinea "&mdash;an easy and obvious title&mdash;had
been chosen, the colony would still have continued to suffer, as it
has done in times past, for the sins of the Guinea Coast of Africa.
There can be no doubt in the mind of anyone who has visited New
Guinea that some such misalliance of name has always haunted the
ideas of the general public, and given the island continent of the
south an ill reputation that it never honestly deserved. New Guinea
is not a health resort for invalids&mdash;no tropical colony
is&mdash;but it never was "the White Man's Grave," or the "Land of
the Lost," or any other of the unpleasant things it has been
miscalled. Perhaps, at the price of even a good deal of
inconvenience and confusion, the Commonwealth Government did well
to cast overboard every relic of the bad old days, and make an
entirely fresh beginning.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>We round a green headland&mdash;we pass through the jaws of an
encircling coral reef&mdash;and the <i>Makambo</i> is at anchor in
Port Moresby Bay. This is the capital that lies before us. There
are only two towns in Papua; you here behold the chief.</p>

<p>Well...it is not a collection of log huts or bark "humpys," but
there is no mistaking the pioneering stage, and Port Moresby has
clearly not emerged from it yet. The curious, peaky, pale green and
deep blue hills that surround the town in a phantasmagorical array,
quite unlike any hills as one has known them in other countries,
are bare of all houses save three or four Government offices and
bungalows and the residence of the London Missionary Society. There
are no roads to be seen (in reality there is one, and several
foot-tracks, but they are hidden behind the hills). The town
itself, clambering up and down one or two of the lesser hills, does
not own more than a score or two of houses, most of them Government
offices. All the buildings are of wood or iron, painted white, all
the roofs of grey iron. The houses are surrounded with deep
verandahs and perched on piles eight or nine feet high, so that
they look like huge many-legged beetles out for a walk. This is not
because the ground is marshy in the town, but because white ants,
snakes, iguanas, and other local fauna are rather too fond of
making their homes with the residents in wet weather if not
discouraged in this manner. A new building is being put up on a
square of cleared ground; the carpenters have got as far as the
laying of the piles, and the bare earth is dotted at regular
intervals with some dozens of black wooden posts capped with
shining zinc...It is extraordinarily like a pincushion seen through
a magnifying glass.</p>

<p>There are no paved or macadamised streets in the town. Grass
alone covers the space between the houses&mdash;grass and bare red
earth. There are three long wooden piers, but the steamer
discharges passengers and cargoes from boats. We land on the
central pier, and, walking up the sharp slope into the town, are
assailed by a rich odour that somehow, in the midst of all the heat
and glare, seems to recall the scented, shaded coolness of
drawing-rooms far removed across the seas of the world and the seas
of Time...Sandalwood, as I live! and there it is, piled up by the
side of the track in a heap that looks like somebody's winter
firing. Rough logs, big straggling roots, knotty branches&mdash;all
as sweet as only sandalwood is sweet&mdash;the very dust and
splinters might perfume a lady's wardrobe. We steal a little piece
or two, and pocket it to make a pleasant smoke against mosquitoes
later on. And now comes the question of finding
quarters&mdash;often something of a difficulty. More fortunate than
most, I was invited to stay with friends, and was thus enabled to
see the wonders of Papua under the pleasantest circumstances.</p>

<p>How is Papua governed, and what changes have been made in its
administrative system since the Commonwealth took over the
country?</p>

<p>In past times British New Guinea was classified as a Crown
Colony, the government being carried on by an Administrator, with
the help of a small Legislative Council. The correspondence of the
Administrator with the Secretary of State had to go by a somewhat
roundabout route, first through the Governor of Queensland, and
then on to England.</p>

<p>Five resident magistrates, each in charge of one of the five
divisions of the country, assisted in keeping order. Sir William
Macgregor, during his Administratorship, instituted a useful system
of Armed Native Constabulary, of whom, in the Crown Colony days,
there were about a hundred and fifty. The native village constables
also date from this period.</p>

<p>At the present time Papua is ruled by a Lieutenant-Governor
appointed by the Commonwealth Government. He is assisted by an
Executive Council of four official members, and a Legislative
Council of four official and three non-official. The title of
"Administrator" has been preserved, with a change of meaning. It is
now borne by the Government officer next in rank to the
Lieutenant-Governor. This official is supposed to take charge of
the colony in the absence or illness of the Lieutenant-Governor,
and in case of the death of a Governor he would hold the position
until a new appointment could be made. The arrangement is in the
nature of an insurance, providing against the possibility of the
country being left at any time without a responsible head. This, in
a new and uncivilised colony like Papua, far removed from post or
telegraph, is very necessary; but the somewhat sinister suggestion
which it conveys as to the perils of Papuan existence is a little
out of date, the health conditions of the country having so greatly
improved of recent years.</p>

<p>There are now eight divisions in the colony administered by
eight resident magistrates, with the help of eleven assistant
resident magistrates and four patrol officers.</p>

<p>The Customs, Post Office, Lands, Mining, and Agricultural
Departments have their quota of officials&mdash;a small
one&mdash;in Port Moresby and Samarai. The colony, on the whole, is
run at very small expense, and has a considerable balance of
revenue over expenditure. Correspondence now goes direct to the
Commonwealth Government offices in Melbourne. Appointments of
officials are recommended by the Commonwealth, and made, if
approved, by the Lieutenant-Governor.</p>

<p>There has been only one Australian Lieutenant-Governor so
far&mdash;the present occupier of the position, His Excellency
Judge Murray (John Hubert Plunket Murray). The officials next in
rank, the Hon. Miles Staniforth Smith, Director of Agriculture, and
the Hon. A. M. Campbell, Government Secretary, are respectively
Australian and Scottish. The lesser officials belong to various
countries, but are all of English-speaking nationality, with a
preponderance of Australian.</p>

<p>The present Lieutenant-Governor has held the post since April,
1907, when he was appointed temporarily to the charge of the
country&mdash;the appointment being made permanent in November,
1908.</p>

<p>His Excellency John Hubert Plunket Murray, and late Colonel of
the New South Wales Irish Rifles, is a son of the late Sir Terence
Aubrey Murray, at one time President of the Legislative Council of
New South Wales. He was educated at Oxford and on the Continent,
and has had a notable career at the New South Wales Bar. He is
Chief Judicial Officer for Papua, as well as Lieutenant-Governor.
During the late Boer war he served with distinction in the New
South Wales Mounted Infantry, and was honoured by the British
Government with the rank of Major. Papua is a country that at times
makes demands on the military capacity of its rulers, and the
Lieutenant-Governor's experience of war has no doubt assisted
largely in keeping peace among the tribes&mdash;a paradox with
which no student of history will find fault.</p>

<p>The history of Papua, up to the last two years, is a tale of
disaster and unsuccess. During 1907-8, and still more during the
present year, a notable change has been taking place. Some such
development had been prophesied and hoped for by a few far-seeing
ones; but time seemed to bring it no nearer, and in the stormy
years of 1904-6 the colony seemed to be steadily losing ground. It
is scarcely possible to give any account of Papuan history, however
brief, without referring to the incidents of this unhappy period,
although little, naturally, can be said about occurrences with
which living and well-known people have been intimately
concerned.</p>

<p>Early in 1903 the country came temporarily under the care of
Judge Robinson, Chief Justice of Papua, a member of a well-known
Queensland family. Judge Robinson was a man still in the thirties,
of a sensitive, humane, and conscientious character&mdash;too
sensitive and high strung, it may be, for the very difficult and
trying task that had devolved upon him. Among other matters that
weighed much upon his mind, after he had become responsible for the
peace of the country, was the bad effect that, among the western
tribes, had followed the murder of the missionaries Chalmers and
Tompkins&mdash;an outrage that made a deep impression upon the
whole religious world. The murder had taken place in 1901, and a
year later the natives who had committed the crime&mdash;Goari-Bari
islanders&mdash;still kept possession of the victims' skeletons,
holding them as trophies of war, and defying the whites to regain
possession of them. Nor had the actual murderers ever been caught,
though punishment of a general nature had been inflicted on their
villages.</p>

<p>Judge Robinson decided, therefore, to pay a visit to Goari-Bari,
and see whether it might not be possible to bring away the murdered
missionaries' remains. He went in the Government steam yacht
<i>Merrie England,</i> and took a number of armed native
constabulary with him. The natives of Goari-Bari, being assured
that the mission was peaceful, came on board from their canoes, a
flotilla of which had surrounded the ship on her arrival. Among the
visitors to the ship one of the native constables declared that he
saw the actual murderers of Chalmers and Tompkins. Judge Robinson
ordered the arrest of the men. Their capture was the signal for a
general attack by the natives in the canoes, who began firing
arrows into the ship. One man aimed an arrow at the Acting-Governor
himself, and would probably have shot him had not a constable put a
bullet through the archer before the arrow could fly. At this the
fight became general. It seems clear that the armed police and the
white men shot a number of the natives who were firing at the ship,
but how many, and under what circumstances, was never exactly or
satisfactorily explained. The natives were soon beaten off and
retired to their village, while the <i>Merrie England</i> steamed
away.</p>

<p>The wildest reports of what had happened at Goari-Bari soon
became current throughout the Territory, and some of them spread
southward. The Commonwealth Government ordered an inquiry into the
whole matter. There is no reason to believe that Judge Robinson
would have suffered by this, but he himself, isolated from his
friends, involved in a mesh of local quarrels, and feeling the
whole trouble with extreme acuteness, could not take a reasonable
view of the situation. He did not await the result of the inquiry,
but was found one morning lying at the foot of the flagstaff in
front of Government House, with a half-loaded revolver in his hand,
shot through the head.</p>

<p>The violent feelings caused by Judge Robinson's death did not
tend to smooth down local differences, which were already active
enough. After the Acting-Governor's suicide the colony broke up
into a series of mutually hostile and mutually distrustful
factions.</p>

<p>A new Governor was appointed, but during his rule things went
from bad to worse, and the official life of the country became a
blaze of continual quarrels. The Commonwealth of Australia sent a
special Commission up to Papua to inquire into the trouble of the
colony, and for some months the members of the Commission were very
fully occupied travelling from place to place and taking the
evidence of officials, planters, traders, anyone who had any-.
thing to say about the matters under discussion.</p>

<p>The Governor went home to England on leave, and did not return
when his time was up. Meanwhile, the Chief Justice of the colony,
His Honour Judge Murray, was appointed Acting-Administrator, and
afterwards confirmed in his appointment as Lieutenant-Governor.</p>

<p>Papua, under the rule of an Australian-born Governor, appointed
by the Commonwealth Administration, now began to advance in a way
little calculated to flatter the pride of the nation that had
industriously made nothing of the country for nearly a quarter of a
century. Between 1907 and 1909 it changed from a useless tract of
savage country, where the natives were more than half out of hand,
the whites almost at war, land scarcely obtainable, property
insecure, to a habitable, peaceful, and flourishing colony. The
change has been so rapid that hardly anyone outside of Australia
even knows that it has taken place, and the British public,
assuredly, does not yet realise that Papua of to-day is by no
manner of means British New Guinea of yesterday, either in name or
in nature.</p>

<p>Figures may (proverbially) be made to prove anything. But there
cannot be much doubt as to what the following extract from the
records of the Government proves:&mdash;</p>

<p>Total land purchased and leased in the Territory of Papua, from
the annexation in 1884 up to 1906...28,999 acres.</p>

<p>Total up to March, 1909...319,853 acres.</p>

<p>So ends the tale of the bad old days in Papua. We return gladly
to the happier present.</p>

<p>IT is impossible to take Papua seriously at first, nor indeed is
it necessary. You cannot understand the country if you set about
the task after too grave a fashion. You must remember, above all
things, that when the steamer slips away round Paga Hill, she snaps
the last link connecting you with things commonplace, accustomed,
even probable. You are left in the Land of the Impossible, where
the thing which is not happens every day, and, in the truest sense
of the phrase, nothing arrives save the unexpected.</p>

<p>A walk through the native village which lies a couple of miles
beyond the township is the recognised way of opening one's
acquaintance with Papua. More or less under white influence for
thirty years, in constant association with the white community for
at least fifteen, the village (one would naturally expect) should
be by this time civilised out of all interest. It is not, however.
Apparently the people of the harbour and the bay swallowed all the
civilisation they could digest a good many years ago, and there
stopped. They know the value of money to a certain extent, though
most of them prefer tobacco to coin in small amounts, and do not
seem to be able to understand that coppers, if collected, are worth
the same as silver. They have a liking for shirts, singlets,
dresses, cotton kilts, but only wear them for ostentation, and as a
piece of show-off when going into the town. Otherwise they prefer
to go clad in a waist-cloth or a grass kilt, according to sex. They
know a good deal of pigeon-English, work for hire as servants,
labourers, store assistants, go to church or school off and on, and
are on the best and most friendly terms with the white population.
Yet they believe heartily in magic and sorcery, and in many
instances practise it; their marriage customs are still those of
the primitive savage, and all the hard work both in village and
field is done by the women.</p>

<p>So it is, therefore, that the twin villages of Hanuabada and
Elavara have lost nothing in their interest for the casual white
visitor, although the antiquarian might find much to regret, and
something to rejoice over, in the decay of native customs good and
bad.</p>

<p>These sea villages of Papua are very numerous, and when one has
visited many the sense of wonder is apt to wear off, though the
sense of pleasure in their artistic beauty remains as an abiding
delight. Still, the first view is one that is long remembered. The
strange brown houses, with their high-pitched gables and deep
verandahs, set up on a forest of sea-worn piles, the rough sketch
of a ladder in front of each, fit indeed for the light movements of
bare feet and slight naked bodies, but a very trap of destruction
for booted climbers&mdash;the jolly-looking crowd of mop-headed men
and women loafing on the platforms, almost naked, save for the
swaying ballet-skirts of the girls and the masses of beads worn by
men and women alike&mdash;the cool lapping of the water right
underneath the houses, and the green gleam that flickers through
the half-transparent floors, when we climb inside to look
round&mdash;all have a quaint exotic charm of their own, and an
absolute fitness with their surroundings, sure to mark the memory
deeply. The "street" of Hanuabada is of white sand and gravel
shaded by tall old palms that lean downward to the sea after the
graceful fashion of their race, and make matchless pencillings of
woven leaves and waving plumes across the pathways, when the sun is
shining low among the black stilts of the houses, and the girls are
going down to the spring with their round brown water-pots poised
in the crook of their round brown arms, to get water for the
evening meal.</p>

<p>It is a merry-looking village, this of Hanuabada. There are
about two thousand people in it, and the number of small fat naked
children climbing perilously up and down the ladders, or splashing
under the houses, seems to suggest that there is no diminution of
numbers to be feared in this branch, at least, of the "disappearing
brown races." These Papuans are of Motuan and Koitapuan race, a
handsome and amiable type. They were never great fighters, and they
deny having been cannibals at any time. Like all the other
inhabitants of sea-built villages, they adopted that form of
building to protect themselves as far as possible against the
attacks of the fiercer mountain tribes, who, until the coming of
the white people, used to make constant raids upon the coast
dwellers. The people of these villages originally lived a little
way from the coast, and supported themselves by hunting and
gardening. It is scarcely credible, yet true, that after a century
or two of life literally in the sea, they have not yet "adapted
themselves to their environment" so far as to make themselves into
decent fishermen. Although the bay is swarming with excellent fish,
and the canoes go out now and then in a perfunctory way, very
little fish finds its way under the brown thatch roofs unless a
crowd of Hula people, from a district some fifty miles down the
coast, happens to be making a visit. Then plenty is to be had, for
the Hula tribe belong to the sea from time immemorial, and they
know how to feed themselves in the way most natural to
sea-dwellers. What they do not know is how to make clay pots such
as Hanuabada manufactures, and they are pleased to go home laden
with these objects of use and beauty, in return for the fish that
they have supplied.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust04" id="illust04"></a><img src=
"1501051h-images/TNNG-04.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=
"Illustration">
</p>

<p>The Hanuabada native, indeed, is a born trader. His women cannot
make the grass "ramies" or skirts in which they love to array
themselves, piling on one over the other until an effect resembling
a crinoline is attained. Kabadi, a district some forty miles away,
makes these, and trades them to the Motuan and Koitapuan
belles&mdash;always for pots. The sago that they love might be
grown in any swampy ground near the village, but they do not grow
it, preferring to send out a sort of Argosy every October, when the
north-west trades are near setting in, to the western district,
returning months later without the immense cargoes of pots that
weighed down their "lakatois," and bringing with them many tons of
Gulf sago which they have bought with their crockery-ware. They
also work occasionally in the town, and spend the money, in
European fashion, on various luxuries that appeal to
them&mdash;scent, print "ramies," mosquito nets, blankets, beads,
barley-sugar and bull's-eyes, tobacco, knives, tools. They are a
cheerful and pleasant people, ready to fraternise with the whites,
and very ready to take advantage of any
over-indulgence&mdash;fairly industrious, rather clever, and not
distinguished by over-nice ideas on the subject of morality.</p>

<p>This afternoon, as we tramp through the village in a heat that
seems to slap one's face and crisp the very hair upon one's head
(nevertheless, no one minds it, since it is the custom of the
whites to defy and despise the heat in this equatorial land), most
of the men are away, for the wallaby-hunting season is on, and the
grass on the hills about the bay is being burned to drive out the
game, so that it can be hunted down with dogs and speared. There
are plenty of women, however&mdash;old women, black, with wrinkled
hippopotamus-like skins and bald-shaven heads, sitting at the
eternal toil of the pots, shaping the clay with fingers and stick,
and burning it in the fire; young married women coming home from
the manioc and banana gardens, laden with nets full of roots and
fruit; unmarried girls, gay with bead necklaces and many-coloured
ramies, their huge woolly heads bright with cocoanut and sandalwood
oil, their tattooed faces and breasts further adorned with stripes
of black soot and washing-blue, swaggering about in front of the
houses with an eye on possible beaux. All these look at us without
interest&mdash;they are quite tired of white visitors and their
eternal cameras, and only want us to throw them a stick or two of
tobacco and go. One elderly man, however, trots after us
persistently, and begs us to come in and see his house. He makes a
living showing it to people from the steamers, and is not minded to
let a patron escape.</p>

<p>So we climb up the rickety ladder and enter the dim, cool brown
room opening from the verandah. There is another room beyond that,
and yet another beyond that again&mdash;each running further and
further out over the cool green water that we can see sparkling
between the rough split logs of the floor. The doorways furnish the
only light, but no other is needed, when you do not read or write,
and do all your net-making and other fine work, such as tattooing,
carving out combs and shell ornaments, etc., on the verandah
outside. The roof is of brown thatch, the floor and walls exhibit
the native idea of a plank&mdash;a slice cut from the outside of a
tree and left in its primitive semicircular shape. There is no
furniture, save for a stray box or so of the camphor-wood variety,
fitted with a lock that rings when the key is put in. I recognise
this box as a very old friend, having found it in every prosperous
native house that I have visited in the whole Pacific, from Tahiti
eastwards. It seems to be the one link connecting all the brown
races of the Southern Seas. Why Melanesian, Micronesian,
Polynesian, and Papuan alike should be consumed by the same desire
for yellow camphorwood boxes with locks that ring, is one of those
matters that one prefers to leave to professed
ethnologists&mdash;confident in the belief that they do not know
any more about it than oneself, and are therefore sure to pronounce
the problem unscientific, and let it alone.</p>

<p>There are a few mats in a corner&mdash;rudely plaited, and
little or not at all ornamented. The Papuan is not much of a
mat-maker, skilful as he is in work demanding much higher ability.
There is a selection of the locally made fire-clay pots for cooking
and storing water. The girls' spare ramies are piled in a heap on
the floor; the men's hunting spears, made of hard wood like ebony,
and all in one piece, are stacked together underneath an
odd-looking object that hangs on the wall&mdash;something like the
beginning of a piece of basketwork, or the frame of a rude shield.
This, we hear, is a snare for wild pigs. When the hunter has
brought a wild boar to bay and the brute is about to charge, he
holds the snare at arm's length to one side, and the animal attacks
it furiously, plunging its head right into the middle, where there
is an opening that seems to invite the action. Once in he cannot
pull his head out again, and is so confused and crippled by the
snare that the hunter can spear him with little danger...One would
like to know how many sportsmen there are at home who would stand
still to the charge of a furious tusked boar, with nothing but a
wooden spear and a wicker snare to protect them?</p>

<p>The Impossibilities of Papua once more loom large in the path.
These peaceable and timid Motuans are not all peaceable and timid,
that is quite evident...When we are told about another of their
diversions&mdash;going into a marshy lagoon haunted by crocodiles,
to drag the monsters out by the tail on to dry land, and slaughter
them&mdash;we realise that these people are not so easy to
understand as they appear at first sight. The cap is added to the
climax by somebody who asks if all the houses in the village have
hurricane lanterns, like the one we are visiting. No, the owner
says, they cannot all afford them, and that is a pity, for nothing
keeps off the spirits on the road to Port Moresby so effectively as
a good hurricane lamp bought from the stores. All the men in the
village, of course, are afraid to be out in the dark, but sometimes
they cannot avoid it, and then "he plenty fright that man!"</p>

<p>To Elavara we proceed over a bridge several hundred feet long
built right out in the water. It is quite a nice and safe bridge,
according to native ideas, but a positive nightmare to ours, being
made after the inevitable Papuan fashion, of small fragile sticks
supported on high posts, without anything in the shape of a
guard-rail. If you are barefoot, practically naked, smallish, and
light, nothing could be more convenient; you trip over the sticks
with the gait of a bird in a tree, and should one or two break, you
merely stammer in your walk, so to speak, and catch up on the next.
But the cumbrously clad and shod European is at a disadvantage, and
very thankful to get safely over to the other side.</p>

<p>Elavara is more of a fortress than Hanuabada. It is built in the
open sea and partly on the verge of a small solitary island, the
bridge being the only connection with the mainland. The original
reason for existence has passed away, in the case of these towns,
and no new ones are being built in any known part of the Territory.
But the natives still keep to the old ones, and repair them as they
fall to pieces&mdash;partly from habit, no doubt, and partly
because of the coolness that is only to be found in the sea-built
villages.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust05" id="illust05"></a><img src=
"1501051h-images/TNNG-05.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=
"Illustration">
</p>

<p>We of the superior races are very fond of laughing at native
conservatism, but there are glass panes in our own houses for all
that. Why is it that in such a hot climate it has never occurred to
any of the people who have built, and are building, houses in Port
Moresby that a European house can be set out on piles in the sea
just as well as a native one, and that this style would certainly
be more healthy than the present plan, not to speak of the
difference in temperature? Mosquitoes would be less troublesome in
such houses than they are in the midst of the grass and trees, the
full benefit of every breeze would be enjoyed, and instead of
heated earth under the house, collecting rubbish and retaining all
the warmth of the day, there would be the clean, fresh, cool water
of the sea, ebbing and flowing with the tide. Nor would any risk
from storms lessen the pleasure of such a dwelling, Port Moresby
harbour being so safe and so sheltered that no wind could make the
least difference to the people of the sea-houses.</p>

<p>Europeans are not much more easily moved out of their customary
way than Papuans, however, and the hot little box of corrugated
iron, set on a baking plain, still continues to be the ideal of the
Port Moresby builder.</p>

<p>So much as we have seen to-day, every passing tourist on the
steamer sees, every traveller who comes to the Unknown Land makes
the first chapter of his book. From a literary point of view, the
native villages about Port Moresby are almost as much used up as
Mount Vesuvius or the Palaces of Versailles.</p>

<p>Yet they are significant to one who is interested in the future
of Papua. They are among the straws that show what way the winds
are blowing. The adaptability of the Papuan, the conservatism that
underlies his adaptability, giving it something to stand upon, and
preserving him from the fate of the fluid-minded Eastern Pacific
races&mdash;the trading instinct that he undoubtedly possesses, his
submission to authority, coupled with an unacknowledged reserve
that allows him to retain individuality and self-respect&mdash;all
these, and more, are suggested to any considering mind by the
native life of Hanuabada and Elavara. Such are the straws. Whither
does the wind of progress seem to be sweeping them? Towards a
completer civilisation, there can be no doubt&mdash;but not towards
that well-intentioned philanthropic system of nation-making that
has somehow contrived, with the best intentions, to make a gigantic
shambles of the Pacific island world. The Papuan is not going to
die out. He is a native of a different kidney to the soft Tahitian,
the gentle, generous Samoan, the easily-moulded, pleasure-loving
Hawaiian. The missionaries find him almost an impossible job, the
traders need all their wits to make a living out of him. What time
will make of him we can only guess, but judging from the past
(short though that has been) we may fairly conclude that he will
never become what the moribund races of the island world hastened
to make themselves from the first&mdash;the white man's "sedulous
ape."</p>

<p>Certain facts about Papua have been so often mentioned in works
of travel much more serious in intention than the present, that
they may almost be "taken as read" at this time of day. Everyone
who has ever opened a book about New Guinea knows that it is a
country of innumerable tribes, often unlike in physical type, and,
generally speaking, different languages. This is interesting to the
student of philology or ethnology, but only strikes the average
wanderer as a decided nuisance, when the difficulty of getting
interpreters for out-of-the-way districts first comes home to him.
It is a constant trouble to the Government, and the
stumbling-blocks it throws in the way of the courts of law are
almost incredible. Quite incredible, unless one has actually seen
the process, are the means adopted to clear the path of justice;
nevertheless, I cannot refrain from relating a sample or two.</p>

<p>The Resident Magistrate of an out-of-the-way division hears a
rumour, filtered down through half a dozen native tribes, that some
member of a tribe that no one has ever seen, living in a district
totally unknown, has killed and eaten his wife. Moreover, he hears
that this man is a murderer of notoriety, and a terror to the
country in which he lives. The R.M., who is probably an Australian
of five or six and twenty, boasting just so much military training
as home life on a cattle station and a few months in Port Moresby
Government offices can give him, "sees his duty, a dead sure thing,
and goes for it there and then." It is, to arrest that
murderer.</p>

<p>He calls out a dozen of his native constabulary, loads them with
provisions and a little "trade" (tobacco, beads, knives), packs his
marching kit in a small oilskin sack, and sets forth. In a couple
of days he strikes unknown country and incomprehensible tongues.
Perhaps one of his police can act as interpreter&mdash;he himself
does not know more than a couple of languages, and neither of them
is any use here; but his dozen constabulary among them may muster
fifteen or sixteen different tongues, and they try them all...A
hit! the natives speak the language that Corporal Boromai used to
know as a child, or something very like it. All is well for a day
or so; provisions are bought at the village; the R.M. takes
industrious notes of the country he is passing through, and the
little party slides, and scrapes, and scrambles, and smashes on its
slow way up and down the interminable mountains and through the
dense dark jungles in the direction given them by the villagers.
The next tribe they meet runs away with howls of terror and is seen
no more. The next is never even seen, leaving only a handful of
empty houses as a sign of its existence. After this the party keep
a sharp look-out, and succeed in forcibly capturing a small boy,
who nearly dies with terror of the unknown white demon who has
seized him. They take the boy back to the nearest village that
speaks a language spoken by one of the men, and find that the said
village can't speak the language of the boy, but they think there
is a place not very far off where there are people who speak a
language that the boy might conceivably know...The village is
found, but it does not speak any language known to the boy, and it
adds the gratuitous information that the boy is a devil, and that
only devils live in the mountains beyond that district, whose
language no decent person would think of knowing.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust06" id="illust06"></a><img src=
"1501051h-images/TNNG-06.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=
"Illustration">
</p>

<p>By this time the provisions are out, one of the police has got a
spear wound in his foot (acquired from a "cache" of spear-heads
concealed in a forest track with the view of discouraging callers),
and the R.M. is down with fever. He tells the boys to put him in
his hammock and take him home; he'll attend to that matter of the
murder later on.</p>

<p>Back at the station they are greeted with delight and envy by
the police who have been left behind, and who spent the whole night
of their departure crying bitterly because they were not taken too.
The boy, who is as wild as a captured bird, refuses obstinately to
eat. He is quite certain that the white devil wants to fatten him
for his table, and he does not wish to make a dainty dish for his
conqueror. The white devil does his best to win the little wild
creature's confidence, and aided by the friendly black faces about
him succeeds in doing so. The child consents to eat, accepts the
wonderful presents that are made him, and becomes quite at home. In
a few weeks he has picked up enough pigeon-English to interpret
roughly with his tribe, and then the expedition starts
again&mdash;always after that murderer. The left-behind police cry
themselves nearly sick this time, for they see that the Taubada
(chief) is taking plenty of cartridges, and they expect there will
be what they live in hope of and are constantly denied&mdash;a real
row.</p>

<p>The same tramp, the same villages, once more the unknown
district and the flying people, and, it may be, a stray arrow or
spear flung from behind a tree as they pass. Now they reach the
point attained before, and here comes in the use of the boy. The
child is dressed up in gay cottons, hung with beads, and given a
knife or two. He is then sent off alone into the bush, and the
expedition sits down to wait. They may wait an hour, they may wait
a couple of days. The boy is finding his people, and telling them
that the white devils called Government are not bad
devils&mdash;that they have treated him splendidly and given him
marvellous presents, and that they want to be friends with the
tribe...It ends in the shy birds of the forest coming to hand,
timidly, but with growing confidence. They are given presents, and
told, through the boy, that the R.M. wants guides and interpreters
to go on into the country of the murderer. Both guides and
interpreters are forthcoming. From village to village, from
hill-range to hill-range, through swamp and river and unbroken
forest, the expedition takes its way, and, after adventures enough
to fill a book, finds and surrounds the delinquent's refuge. There
may be a fight before he is taken&mdash;the white lad and his dozen
natives may have to beat off a couple of hundred Papuans armed with
bows, clubs, and spears, or they may have to besiege and take a
whole large town, with nothing but their pluck and their rifles to
see them through. These things have been done over and over again
in Papua without attracting special notice&mdash;it is merely the
magistrate's duty. In any case, the murderer is secured,
handcuffed, and taken away amidst yells of distress from his tribe,
and the first part of the play ends.</p>

<p>There may be a second when it is discovered that the murderer
speaks a language which nobody at all understands&mdash;not the
police, or the villagers on the way to the coast, or the captured
boy or his tribe. If an interpreter cannot be found, what is to be
done? The man must, for the good of the country, be punished. There
is no reasonable doubt that he is the murderer; and he is quite
prepared for any treatment that may be meted out to him, including
eating.</p>

<p>Some colonies would hang him forthwith. That is not the system
of Papua, however. The native must have justice, even if justice
has to be compounded of unusual and inconvenient elements,
including geographical and philological research; travel
complicated by the attentions of alligators, snakes, and swamp
leeches, and patient investigation into a tangle of sorcery and
pig-stealing (two items almost always present in a Papuan murder
case). An interpreter is procured by the same lengthy process that
resulted in bringing in the murderer, and at the last he is brought
to trial. He will not be hanged unless he has killed a white man (a
rare offence), or unless his crime has been one of an aggravated
kind. Common sorts of murder among the natives are punished by
imprisonment only. In any case, he is heard in his own defence, and
knows what is being done and why. And the interests of justice and
of comparative philology have been attained.</p>

<p>That is what the curse of Babel means in Papua.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Some days after my arrival in Port Moresby there was a native
dance in the village, and I went down with a party of friends to
see it. It took place at night, lit up by the moon and a number of
cocoanut torches, which latter were carried by the dancers. There
was no danger of setting anyone's clothes on fire, because no one
wore any, except the small contingent of girls, who were more like
penwipers than human beings with the number of grass skirts they
had put on. It was a display of male rather than female agility and
grace, the women taking no part except a little shuffling up and
down.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust07" id="illust07"></a><img src=
"1501051h-images/TNNG-07.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=
"Illustration">
</p>

<p>The spirit of Papua was there that night&mdash;the intangible,
indescribable "spirit of place" that gives to travel three-fourths
of its charm. It had haunted me all day long, in the monstrous
shapes of the dark contorted hills through which I had been riding
in the afternoon&mdash;in the huge antennae of the "lakatoi" canoes
that swept across the bay like flights of demon moths, through a
sunset of volcano-red; in the thrumming, booming note of the native
drums, beating like a restless heart all the evening in the village
below&mdash;in the extraordinary hues of phosphoric blue that lit
the uppermost reaches of the sky when the dark was near at hand (a
colour I saw many a time in Papuan sunset skies, but never
elsewhere). Papuan, and nothing else, was the spirit of the dance.
The grace of the island measures was not there, nor the art of
European dancing; there were hardly any "steps," merely a general
capering, which now and then concentrated itself into a slow
advancing shuffle, made with swaying bodies and sleepy eyes. But
the intoxicating throb of the drums carried by the dancers, the
loud, brassy, booming song which they sang hour after hour, the
ceaseless rippling and flickering of plumes and coloured leaves and
grasses fastened on the heads and limbs of the naked brown bodies,
the nodding and stamping and prancing, the savage measure of the
dance&mdash;two-four, with a strong accent on the second
beat&mdash;were fascinating enough to keep us watching there on the
bare stretch of open ground above the village, in the glare of the
torches and the smell of smoke and sandalwood and cocoanut oil, for
more than an hour. After which&mdash;as a native dance may go on
for a day and night, once started&mdash;we gave up and went home.
As we left, a new series of leaps and bounds began in a squadron of
dancers led by a wild naked figure with a woolly head of tremendous
size, and a coiffure composed of six paradise plumes, two sets of
parrot wings, and a halo of miscellaneous feathers.</p>

<p>"Who is that man-cater?" demanded a visitor, looking back at the
pantomime demon leader with astonishment and a little awe.</p>

<p>"Garia!" called one of the whites.</p>

<p>The demon stopped his capers instantly, and came out of the
dance, painted, perspiring, panting. He brought his right hand up
to the salute, and stood at attention.</p>

<p>"You wanting the boat to-night, sir?" he inquired with
deference. "I left my watch in my house, did not know the time. I
go fetch the crew?"</p>

<p>It was Garia, the coxswain of the Governor's boat's crew, whom
we had seen in the afternoon uniformed, grave, and responsible,
handing the white visitors in and out of the boat with the air of a
man-of-war officer.</p>

<p>"No, you're not wanted to-night," he was told. "We only wish you
to show the ladies those feathers of yours, and your drum. Where
did you get it?"</p>

<p>"I made him myself, when I was quite little boy," answered the
coxswain, handing over the drum&mdash;an hour-glass-shaped
instrument of dark wood, hollowed out and carved, and covered at
the top with iguana skin, which is thin, semi-translucent, and
rather like parchment.</p>

<p>The drum was admired and returned, and the party once more
prepared to start.</p>

<p>"You want anything else, sir?" asked the coxswain.</p>

<p>"No, you can go."</p>

<p>With a long howl like a wild beast he leaped back into the dance
and into savagery again at once, shaking and beating his drum,
flinging his nodding plumes in the air, and showing his
betel-stained teeth in a grin of fierce delight, as the capering
squadron closed round him and drew him into the whirl once
more.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Enough of the Port Moresby native. He is interesting in his own
way, but one tires of him soon. The truth is that, in spite of his
superficial quickness, he has less intellect and less character
than many other of the Papuan races. And of the country about Port
Moresby one soon sees enough. It is beautiful as to
colouring&mdash;here, as everywhere throughout the Territory, sea,
sky, and earth are painted with a palette of gems and
fire&mdash;but the soil is barren, and there are no plantations.
Now, it is the new plantation life that is the real attraction in
Papua of today; and to see that we must go up into the
mountains.</p>

<p>Anyone who has ever read geography for pleasure or of necessity
must have noticed the peculiar deadness of facts as
embedded&mdash;interred one might rather say&mdash;in geographical
works. Nothing seems surprising; little is even interesting..."This
neighbourhood exhibits much volcanic activity at times, resulting
in serious destruction of property."&mdash;"Metalliferous tracts of
value abound."&mdash;"The river here precipitates itself into the
valley of the..., down a perpendicular descent of several hundred
feet."...Burning mountains that overflow vineyards and
villages&mdash;gold-mines where one makes a fortune in a
day&mdash;huge waterfalls dropping in smoke and spume down half a
mountain side&mdash;these things may be objects of interest outside
the covers of an educational work, but inside one merely yawns over
them. So, in reading about Papua, one sees without emotion the
statement that the main range of the country ascends rapidly from
the coast, and reaches a height of thirteen thousand feet. It does
not seem a thing to laugh or weep over, anyhow.</p>

<p>Yet here, as always, "things seen are mightier than things
heard." That thirteen-thousand-foot range becomes a matter of
extreme personal interest when once one has realised what it means.
When one has ridden twenty miles from scorching Port Moresby up to
the little bungalow at Warirata, nearly three thousand feet higher,
and felt the cold of nights that demand warm rugs on the bed, and
mornings when one must wear a serge coat till
breakfast-time&mdash;when one listens to the complaints of the
native mail-carriers coming down from the Kokoda track twenty miles
further back, of the bitter chill and frost at the
eight-thousand-foot gap&mdash;when one looks out on the long rises
of Mount Victoria, lifting pale violet curve after pale violet
curve up to the dim faint blues of a far-off summit near as high as
the Jungfrau, and sees climate after climate&mdash;torrid, tropic,
temperate, cold, from Calcutta to Shetland&mdash;spread out before
one's very eyes&mdash;then one realises that the bald geographical
fact one noted with so little emotion is really "something to make
a song about," after all.</p>

<p>Where else, in all the British colonies, is there a country that
offers almost every variety of temperature within a space of some
fifty or sixty miles? We have been accustomed to speak and think of
New Guinea as a place where the climate is terrible and the heat
exhausting, deadly, inescapable. The description is scarcely
correct from any point of view&mdash;Papua is not so hot as either
India or Ceylon, and certainly not less healthy on the
whole&mdash;and it is most incorrect when one pauses to remember
that a great part of the country is colder than England. True, that
part is inaccessible at present. But it will not always remain so.
India had not always her cool hill stations, reached by
marvellously graded roads, for the refreshment of tired officials
and their families. The Cordilleras of South America must have been
impassable, except to the Indians, for many a long year. And in
Papua the distances to the hill country are in reality so small
that, once the difficulties of the ground are overcome, the cool
climates will be accessible to everyone without trouble or
expense.</p>

<p>Back from the future to the present we come with a run, for it
is seven o'clock in the morning, and three saddle-horses are
standing in the shade outside the house, with three pack-horses and
several "boys" visible further away. We are off into the Astrolabe
Range, three of us, to have a look round and a good time; and it is
not the day after to-morrow, but to-day, and there are no real
roads, no bridges, no carriages, no hotels on the
way&mdash;nothing, in fact, but ourselves and our horses to get us
through.</p>

<p>We are bound for the Sogeri country, some thirty-six miles away,
and we intend to make a three days' journey of it, so as to add on
some small detours and see everything thoroughly.</p>

<p>The day is hot already, and promises to be appallingly so later
on, but nobody troubles about that. It does one's heart good to see
the sensible, plucky way in which the resident of Papua accepts
every disadvantage of the country, climatic and other, and in so
doing takes the edge off most of them. In any other country only
nine degrees south of the equator it would be thought a hazardous
proceeding for a couple of ladies and their escort to start out on
a twelve miles' ride in the middle of the day over an unsheltered
road in the worst of the hot season. But the white settlers of
Papua simply laugh in the face of the weather at all times, nor do
they appear to suffer on that account. No one in this country
arises at dawn to take an early cup of tea and a ride in the
morning twilight, preparatory to a day spent mostly behind close
blinds; no one fills up the hot hours with a siesta and creeps
cautiously out at sundown. On the contrary, everyone is busy all
day long at ordinary employments, indoor and out; meals are held at
English hours; houses are not built with any special provision for
heat, and nobody thinks of abandoning a day's ride or walk because
the thermometer happens to be standing at ninety in the shade. In
justice to Papua, it must be added that ninety is a figure not
often reached.</p>

<p>We travel, in this country, as people travelled all the world
over before roads and railways were made&mdash;as they travelled in
England during the Middle Ages. Ride when you can, and walk when
you must, is the rule. There is always, however, a bridle-track to
a plantation, and the arrival of guests is heralded by the jangling
of pack-horse bells from afar. As we were bound for plantation
country, we had the luxury of horses&mdash;how much a luxury it is,
experiences in uncleaned districts painfully impressed upon me
later on.</p>

<p>Does the English reader know what a "swag" is? It is not a
collection of burglariously acquired silver in a Gladstone bag, as
popular literature might lead one to suppose. In Papua, a swag is a
sack of painted sail-canvas, fitted with slings at the back and
fastened by draw-strings of strong cord. It is the traveller's one
indispensable possession, and takes the place of all the
complicated apparatus of trunks, portmanteaux, dressing-cases, and
hat-boxes, which he is obliged to leave behind in port. What you
cannot put into a swag, or into two or three swags, you cannot have
up country, for cabin-trunks and dress-baskets are not convenient
to sling on the backs of horses or native carriers. There is a
certain amount of art in packing for one of these journeys. Into
one swag go your blankets (you may think you cannot want them, but
you will), your mosquito net, your woollen suit or dress for wet
evenings in high altitudes. Into another go your clothes, rolled
into many tight little bundles. Another is filled with tins of
meat, parcels of biscuit, and rice, tea, sugar, and tinned milk.
These are all fastened on the pack-horses, two swags apiece, and a
couple of billy-cans are added&mdash;no one can possibly travel
without a billy-can in any part of Australasia. If the English
reader wants to know what a billy-can is, I can assure him that
there is nothing mysterious about it. It is simply a plain tin can
with a lid, such as is used in England for carrying milk. Simple
though it is, the British traveller will bring derision upon
himself if he does not know one when he sees it, and especially if
he makes any mistakes about its inseparable companion, the
pannikin. Let him not suppose rashly, as I did, that a pannikin is
a small frying-pan; and let him carefully refrain, when he does
find out what it is, from calling it a mug, lest the epithet should
be insultingly transferred to himself.</p>

<p>Strictly by the way&mdash;Micawber was right for once, when he
fitted out his young family for their Australian travels by tying
tin drinking-vessels round their waists. It is the correct practice
to ride thus ornamented in Papua. A sheath-knife is also
invaluable&mdash;not for any purpose of self-defence, but for a
score of miscellaneous jobs, such as tin-opening, cutting bread,
lifting a hot billy-can off the fire, splitting nuts, peeling
fruit, etc. etc. etc. Thus accoutred, with a wide cowboy hat of
thick felt, nailed boots, putties, and a short skirt, the
equestrienne of Papua is suitably outfitted, though she would
certainly not pass muster in Rotten Row.</p>

<p>The first few miles of the ride were easy, if rather warm. The
road was an actual carriage road, and made our bush equipments look
rather silly, though there was no one to see except a native or
two, plodding along under loads of manioc or banana. Open grassy
plains, sprinkled with the pale grey-green of the eucalyptus tree,
surrounded us for miles, with a few low hills in the distance. This
went on until we reached an ascent, turned a corner, and faced a
sudden down-slope, when the splendour of the hill-country suddenly
broke upon us.</p>

<p>I am afraid it was not the beauty of the scene&mdash;though that
was marvellous&mdash;that chiefly impressed me as I reined up on
the top of the slope, above a sea of weltering peaks and ridges and
clambering crests, all veiled and softened in velvety green forest.
I only said to myself, in a kind of stony despair, "Good heavens,
have I got to get through <i>that?</i>" and wondered how, short of
an aeroplane, it was to be done.</p>

<p>Another sentence out of the geographies came back and hit me in
the face&mdash;"The vegetation of New Guinea is notably
luxuriant."</p>

<p>Luxuriant? Well, if luxuriance means an inundation of dense,
tall, dark forest, knitted inextricably together with creepers,
canes, and lianas, overflowing every level, filling every valley,
rushing up every mountain and down it again, submerging the whole
land under a flood of triumphant and impenetrable greenery fifty to
a hundred feet deep&mdash;then the "vegetation" of Papua fairly
deserves the title. I could not see the smallest scratch of a track
up to the verge of the horizon, except the road on which we were
travelling, and it obviously came to an end before long. How travel
was to be managed through such a country taxed one's imagination to
guess. I knew, however, that the problem would be sure to work
itself out somehow or other, and abandoned it for the present.</p>

<p>And here I will add&mdash;what did not come to my knowledge
until some time later&mdash;that this luxuriance of growth
advertises the value of the land to the experienced eye. I can
imagine the dismay with which it must strike the settler from home
countries, who has taken up land from a map in Port Moresby, and
views for the first time the impenetrable tangle of primaeval
forest under which his estate lies concealed. But the knowing hand
looks at the unbroken masses of velvety green with satisfaction.
Land that can raise that can raise anything; and every week will
see a bigger handful of clearing plucked out of the smooth surface
of tree tops.</p>

<p>People accustomed to the leisurely forestry of Europe have no
idea how little "clearing" means to an Australian or New Zealander.
It takes a month to cut down a small copse in England, with a dozen
labourers hacking patiently away at tree after tree, digging out
stumps, cutting off branches, tidying things up as they go...In
Papua, an Australian "cocky" (as the outback farmer who shoots
cockatoos for the pot is rudely called) would set to work with
fifty native "boys" at seven shillings a month, and have twenty
acres open to sun and wind in the same time. No landscape gardening
there&mdash;the big trees are hacked down and left where they fall
until it is convenient to set fire to them; the stumps and roots
rot away in a little time, and add value to the soil. It seems
untidy and desolate and ugly; but the stretch of hare brown earth
littered with splintering logs and black stumps is beauty itself to
the planter's eye, and in a very few months, when the coffee, or
the rubber, or the cocoanut palms begin to spring up, it will be as
picturesque as any English park.</p>

<p>The richness of soil that I have mentioned is one of the many
wonders that are commonplace, even matter of course, to the dweller
in the tropics, yet not in any degree realised or understood by
Europeans. The rainfall in Papua is enormous, amounting to as much
as r So inches per year in some places. The heat is great at times,
and the constant decay of vegetation in the warmth and damp makes
the whole country one vast forcing-bed. In other words, the
conditions that we produce with care and expense under five or six
feet of glass, are the natural conditions of the continent of New
Guinea.</p>

<p>The plants that grow in such a soil are valuable in proportion.
Where the products of poorer lands bring their fives and tens of
pounds per ton, those of the tropics bring twenties, fifties, and
hundreds. Rubber is worth over five hundred pounds a ton. Hemp
fibres are worth thirty or more. Coffee brings sixty upwards. There
is a gold mine in the earth of these rich countries, and the
planter is the prospector and miner.</p>

<p>I had known this in a vague and general way, but the sight of
the tropic forest was the first thing that really brought it home
to me. And I wondered, as we turned our horses down the slope and
got on our way again, how it was that the millions at home knew so
little, and cared so much less, about these golden lands lying
unawaked and untouched, like the Sleeping Beauty of the fairy tale,
in the far-away corners of England's wonderful empire.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>That night we all slept in jail.</p>

<p>We had not committed any crimes&mdash;any that were found out,
at all events. Our stay in prison was not, therefore, enforced. We
only put up at the jail because there was nowhere else to sleep,
unless we had camped on the track. The hostelry in question lay at
the end of our first day's ride (only eleven miles), on the banks
of the Laloki River, and in the midst of country nearly all
uncleared. Some acres of land lying about the jail had been cleared
for vegetable gardens and for a Government nursery; there was a
native overseer in charge of the place, and a few Papuan prisoners
wandering in a lost sort of manner about the track and the banana
fields when we arrived. I imagine they were looking for us; we had
wasted time on the way, and it was dark when we arrived.</p>

<p>The jail buildings, three or four in number, irresistibly
suggested fowl-farming on a large scale, or summer-houses of an
eccentric kind, or large clothes-baskets left out and forgotten by
a party of giant washerwomen. What they did not suggest was
restraint or imprisonment of any sort. And, indeed, I found out
later that there is not a jail in Papua out of which any prisoner
could not break with a little determination and a one-bladed
pocketknife.</p>

<p>The prisoners, cheerful-looking brown men in broad-arrowed
tunics, live and sleep in these peculiar bird-cage houses, and
spend their days doing a little gardening, planting, and clearing.
They were delighted to see us, and most eager to do anything they
could for our assistance. The head jailer, a woolly-haired native
who spoke a good deal of English, received us with the air of a
host doing the honours of his mansion, and all the jolly brown
prisoners, that day and the next, were so amiable and so kind,
chasing fowls for our dinner, picking fruit, catching our horses,
that we really felt they regarded us as their personal guests.
Which no doubt they did.</p>

<p>"What are these people imprisoned for?" I asked, with some
perplexity. I am sure they could not be criminals in the ordinary
sense of the word.</p>

<p>Well, they were not. Most of them had murdered somebody, and
concealed the crime by eating the victim; hardly a commonplace
peccadillo. A great many were sorcerers, sorcery being an offence
fully recognised by the Government and classed as criminal, for
excellent reasons. Some of them were in prison for libel, or
"spreading false reports," which would seem to point to rapid
development of the Papuan mind along the lines already laid down by
the Caucasian. The presence of a single forger&mdash;so far unique
in Papuan criminal history&mdash;marked the high-water level
reached in the struggle of the black man's mind after the white.
This New Guinea Jim the Penman had been sent with signed orders to
fetch goods from a store many times. One day it occurred to him
(since he could write) to pencil his master's name on a piece of
paper and get various desirable things for himself. The plan was
good so far as it went, but the brilliant mind that had thought out
for itself this new way of circumventing the universal curse of
labour stopped short at the idea of concealment. Consequently
arrest, trial, and a term in the Laloki bird-cage.</p>

<p>Nothing is singular in Papua, simply because everything is. It
would have been singular in any other country for two white women
and one white man to go peaceably to sleep in a couple of
wooden-barred cages, eleven miles from anywhere, in the midst of
some dozens of savage murderers confined only by wickerwork walls,
without any apprehension as to unpleasant results. It was not
singular here, because we all knew quite well that the prisoners
had no intention in the world of giving anybody any trouble. They
had certainly killed and eaten a wife or so, or an inconvenient
aunt or grandfather, for good reasons of their own. The white
rulers, for reasons of <i>their</i> own, had chosen to object, and
the gentleman who had smashed in the head of another gentleman
fully understood that he had to pay for it, and that if he
expressed his feelings after that fashion again he might even be
hanged. He did not bear malice; like the man in Kipling's poem, he
only said to himself that he had "taken his fun where he found it,
and now he must pay for his fun"&mdash;it was quite simple. As to
annoying this extremely interesting and exciting party of visitors
who had come to enlighten the dullnesses of his gardening, why, he
would have given them anything he had, even to the half of his
supper!</p>

<p>My first night in jail (the phrase somehow reminded me of the
title of a tract) proved peaceful enough, in spite of the loud
whirring and rattling of the swarms of crickets in the trees and
the croaking of giant regiments of frogs in the river. My cell was
part of the head jailer's house. It was built of slabs or slips of
wood which were very far from meeting; the floor was of the same
material, and allowed one to look right through down to the ground
several feet below and see the rats and fowls running about
underneath. The furniture consisted of a single sloping shelf. My
hammock and net were slung from the supporting posts of the roof,
isolating me from the possible attentions of centipedes and
scorpions in a way that added a good deal to my peace of mind. As
for snakes and giant lizards, there were plenty of them in the bush
close at hand, and plenty of alligators in the river not twenty
yards away, but I had learned by this time that they were not to be
feared, being quite as much afraid of the traveller as the
traveller could be of them.</p>

<p>We spent the whole of the next day in the neighbourhood of the
jail, as no one was pressed for time, and I wanted to see the
Government nursery, one of several organised by the Director of
Agriculture, the Hon. Miles Staniforth Smith.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust09" id="illust09"></a><img src=
"1501051h-images/TNNG-09.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=
"Illustration">
</p>

<p>It was about half an hour's walk from the jail grounds. The way
led first of all through the garden, where yams, manioc, and other
vegetables are raised for the prisoners' food. A garden in Papua,
it must be explained, never means an ornamental flower-ground; it
is always a strictly practical place, devoted to small useful
crops. There were a few acres of bananas here spreading out their
great green flags and enormous crimson flowers above the steep bank
of the sliding, muddy river. We stopped in the shade long enough to
take a good look at the Laloki, a bigger river than any in England,
though it is only one of the minor streams of Papua. Alligators
abound in its yellow depths, and a native who swims the stream does
so at the risk of his life.</p>

<p>Nevertheless a number of them did swim the Laloki in flood, and
at a very dangerous point, not long ago. The Governor of the
country was making a tour of inspection, and wanted to get to the
other side of the river. No boat or canoe was available, and His
Excellency expressed his intention of swimming. The small official
staff of course accompanied their chief, as they accompany him into
a hostile cannibal village or a swamp full of snakes, leeches, and
scrub ticks, or any other warm corner where Governmental duty may
demand their presence. The natives, seeing that the white men
intended to take the risk, plunged in to the number of a dozen or
two along with them, simply to make the swim a little less
dangerous by force of numbers. All got across without accident.</p>

<p>One wonders at times how the gilded and ribboned A.D.C.'s and
secretaries of the Government Houses in older colonies would enjoy
the amazing duties that fall to the share of their confrères in
Papua!</p>

<p>Beyond the jail gardens, beyond the banana groves on the river
bank, past the clearings in the forest where enormous trunks of
valuable timber lay wasting and rotting on the ground, by a cool
pathway through the bush and along a rough fence, we came upon the
Government nursery.</p>

<p>Judging by the title, it ought to have been something like a
botanical garden at home, with tidy gravelled walks and beds full
of labelled specimens, and big official buildings, and a neat house
for a curator. It <i>was</i> a newly-cleared space of ground
without any walks at all, with a number of beds, a few
brushwood-roofed sheds for young plants, and a native hut for the
man in charge. There are no "frills" of any kind about Papuan
administration.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the rough place, with three more like itself in
different parts of the Territory, has proved itself useful and
practical. It is from these nurseries that the planters get their
seeds and cuttings&mdash;their cocoanuts of good kinds for setting
out, their rubber seeds or stumps, their coffee plants, their hemp
slips, and almost anything they may want to experiment with in the
way of spices, drugs, etc. They can also get instructions that will
enable them to start their plantations in the best way&mdash;how to
line and trench and plant out, how to make nurseries, how to weed
and prune&mdash;in general, how to make their estates pay. The old
idea that a man must have served an apprenticeship of years before
attempting to grow tropical products on his own account has quite
died out in these new go-ahead colonies. There is no
jealously-guarded mystery about the raising of coffee, hemp,
rubber, or any other paying plant. If a man knows something from
past experience, all the better. If not, however, he can see all
the standard books on his subject in Port Moresby, can get his
plants in the country, and learn enough theoretically to keep him
from wasting his money. This is what more than one really
successful planter has already done. I am compelled to add,
however, that the successful planter rather often ranges himself on
the side of those who declare that "a man must have practical
experience," once his own experience is gained, and is very ready
to laugh at the presumption of the "new chum" who wants to defy
tradition by going into the water before he knows how to swim.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="caption">Along the Laloki&mdash;Wonderful Rona&mdash;The
country of copper&mdash;A roadside camp&mdash;A plantation
bungalow&mdash;Where are the English?&mdash;The humours of
manslaughter&mdash;Up-and-down country&mdash;The daily
lucky-bag&mdash;"Heaven sends walnuts..."&mdash;Unknown fauna of
New Guinea&mdash;On the long trail again.</p>

<p>NEXT morning our cavalcade set off again&mdash;three riders, six
horses, and several "boys" afoot. Several agreeably-mannered
assassins saw us to the beginning of the track, and begged us, so
far as we could gather, to come back again soon.</p>

<p>There was a "good road" all the way, it appeared, in spite of
the unbroken look of the country. You cannot always see your road
about the Astrolabe until you reach it&mdash;and not invariably
then, truth compels me to add. You may, if you are not a good
"bushman," mistake the highway for a pig-track, or a casual
landslip, or the bed of a dried-up stream; or you may, on the other
hand, mistake any one of these for the road. The moral is, that you
must have a guide. It is not a good thing to get hopelessly off the
track anywhere in New Guinea. One is not likely to die of thirst;
but hunger, in these unpeopled solitudes, would rapidly put an end
to any white man who strayed away from his party and did not
succeed in finding it again. True, there is game, but explorers
know the danger of relying entirely on what one may shoot in a
country so encumbered by mountain and forest that rapid progress is
impossible. Often enough, riding along the narrow ribbon of forest
track, I have looked at the huge, silent, scarce penetrable dells
and billows of woodland beside me, much as a passenger on a steamer
may look at the unfathomable sea below the rail. So safe upon this
tiny space of plank, or clearing&mdash;so close to death, one step
outside!...The intense silence of the Papuan forests, the immovable
star of light standing fixed on each glossy leaf in the depths of
the ocean of green, while high above, the lofty crests may be
struggling furiously with a south-east gale, and breaking up the
sunrays into scintillating fire, seems to add to the almost
personal fear excited by these great solitudes. The spirit of the
wilderness is there, and none of the little shelters erected by Old
World peoples for their shivering souls to creep into, in the
presence of the unknown, can serve our turn. Pan, the god of river
reed-beds and sunny thickets, through which a soft-skinned nymph
might flit like a butterfly&mdash;Baldur, stately and gentle spirit
of murmuring pine-woods, and green mountain slopes where
sweet-breathing cattle wander&mdash;all the quaint and graceful and
poetic figures of northern and southern mythology alike&mdash;do
not their very apparitions tremble, and reproach us with gentle
frightened eyes, when we set them down in fancy in these primaeval
wildernesses?...Nature in the Old World has been for so many
hundred and thousand years just "the old nurse" of her children,
that it is terrifying to meet her face to face in the lands where
she turns a hard unseeing countenance upon us, and crushes
us&mdash;not for sport, simply not knowing of our
existence&mdash;with one least finger-tip of the giant hand we have
unwittingly brushed against. Yet our revenge is waiting, for in the
generations that are to come we shall seize and crush her and tame
her to our will, as throughout the centuries long since forgotten
she was tamed in the countries that we have made our own.</p>

<p>Not to-day, but to-morrow, our way lies through these great
forests. To-day we are riding merrily and easily enough upon a
mighty highway full three feet wide in places, leading up the
course of the Laloki River, along the side of a valley that is
certainly one of the most beautiful valleys in the world, but that,
not possessing a hotel with a brass band and a motorcar service,
nor being advertised in tourist timetables, is only thought to be
rather pretty by the few settlers who occasionally pass that
way.</p>

<p>The Laloki gorge is here at least a thousand feet in sheer
depth, and looks a good deal more. Closed in by magnificent
ramparts and castellations of basalt, with here and there an
unconsidered forest or two dropping down its sides like a green
kerchief forgotten by some giant queen, with tall tree-ferns
spreading spider-webs of emerald lace into the blue sky, and
cockatoos soaring like flights of white butterflies against the
thunder-purple ranges in the far distance&mdash;with the great
river itself singing away far below, like a silver thread wound by
unseen hands from the giant spindle of the great white
waterfall&mdash;it is indeed a spot worth much travel and many
pains to see.</p>

<p>Immense black masses of stone, looking like sponges steeped in
ink, lie scattered all over the valley. These are indications of
the mineral wealth of the Astrolabe country; to the trained eye
they spell "COPPER" in large capitals. There are several paying
claims rather lower down, and a company has lately undertaken the
further exploitation of the district. Papua is as full of valuable
minerals as a pudding of plums; unfortunately, they take a good
deal of finding, and a good deal of getting at when found. But they
pay well for discovery when the prospector has money enough to fit
out a small expedition, and stay away in comfort some months if
necessary. It is the small miner, with his dish and pannikin and
swag for all wealth, who conies to grief in Papua, thinking,
misguidedly, that the methods which answer in Australia will answer
in Australia's neighbouring colony. They will not, and do not, but
they have filled many a roughly dug grave on the Mamba and Gira
rivers and in the steaming Woodlark Islands, and they have
succeeded in giving this unlucky dog of a Papua a bad name that it
never fairly deserved, in consequence.</p>

<p>We have to get off and tramp for a mile or two at the steepest
part of the track. In this country you do not exactly ride when you
go out riding&mdash;you take a walk accompanied by your horse, and
get a lift every now and then. We have had several long lifts
today, and do not at all grudge the walk up the big hill,
especially as we follow the custom of the country in taking hold of
our horses' flowing tails and letting them drag us behind. This
rests the horse and rests the rider at the same time&mdash;a matter
of some importance on roads that are for the most part quite steep
enough to sit down upon with support for the feet and something to
lean against at almost any part of the journey.</p>

<p>At the top of the hill comes our reward&mdash;we are in sight of
Rona Falls.</p>

<p>We have heard them booming in the distance for a mile or more,
and here they are below us&mdash;at least half a mile away, and not
to be reached save by a climb that nobody ever has time to take at
this stage of a long day's journey&mdash;but grand beyond
description.</p>

<p>Has anyone ever made a satisfactory pen-picture of a great
waterfall? To say that Rona Falls is about three hundred feet in
sheer height&mdash;considerably higher than Niagara, though wanting
in the immense breadth of that famous cataract&mdash;that it drops
down into a deep black gorge, and makes a lake clear as grey agate
at the foot of the fall&mdash;that there are flights of white
cockatoos on the heights, and great dim mountains in the
distance&mdash;this is to say as much as a page of word-painting
could say, which is nothing at all...One is, perhaps, not sorry. To
keep Rona Falls to oneself, as the lover of an unknown mountain
maid may keep his pleasant secret hidden in his heart, is well
worth while, after all.</p>

<p>That night we came to the camping ground fairly satiated with
beauties of scenery. I know that towards sunset we passed through
wonderful peaks and passes, and in view of exquisite river country,
but I looked at it as stolidly as my own horse, being quite
incapable of appreciating any longer. Most travellers, one fancies,
must have noticed this dulling of the mind that takes place towards
the end of a day of special beauty, though few are egotistic enough
to mention it. If anyone had pointed out to me a replica of the
Great Pyramid of Cheops, or one of the fire-fountains of Hawaii,
springing up a hundred yards from the track, I should only have
resented the interruption at that hour of the day. What really
interested all of us was&mdash;should we get to the camp before
dark, and especially, how we should get across the river?</p>

<p>There is nothing more charming and poetical&mdash;in a picture
gallery or a poem&mdash;than a ford. At home, where bridges follow
roads as naturally as feet follow legs, the ford is merely a
picturesque spot where the little girl in a sunbonnet drives the
cattle across of an evening, or where the fisherman from the great
house on the hill wades in long boots and fly-trimmed hat, casting
a line across the oily shallows. In "the new and naked lands" it is
something very different&mdash;something that makes or spoils the
comfort of an entire journey, that holds the fortunes of a great
district in its capricious hand, that may measure out death or
life, even, as the rains in the hills and the rising of the flood
may decree.</p>

<p>It had been raining a good deal that day, and we had all got wet
through a good many times, though no one thought a trifle like that
worth mentioning. More, it had been raining up in the mountains for
several days, and there was no knowing what the Laloki might be
doing, up here above the falls. And the light was failing as a lamp
fails when the oil runs out. And the track was so slippery with
clay and water that our horses could only crawl. It did not seem
certain that we should get across.</p>

<p>But in the livid green gloom that follows a wet sunset among the
hills, we did strike the slope leading to the river, and in another
minute all our horses were sliding and slithering horribly, right
down to the ford. It looked very high, and the stream gushed up to
the girths at once, so that we had to put our feet on our saddles
and cling on as we might. The force of the river was tremendous,
and the beasts staggered under it so that they could scarce make
way. In places it was so deep that the saddles were wet, and there
was a very nasty little fall close to our crossing place; but the
light held good till we were across; and nobody fell down...It was
a relief to be out of the river and scrambling up the darkening
slope on the other side, for lives have been lost on the Laloki
ford before now; and besides, it is not easy to keep the unbidden
thought of crocodiles out of one's head, when traversing a New
Guinea river. Waterfalls do not stop the crocodile in its up-stream
migrations; it simply gets out and travels overland when a fall is
reached; and so it comes about that the rivers of the Astrolabe
range are not by any means free from these troublesome brutes, in
spite of their height above the sea.</p>

</p>

<p>The camp, when we reached it&mdash;quite in the dark
now&mdash;looked almost homelike, so glad was the wet and tired and
hungry party to sec its night quarters. There was not much to see,
however. The "rest-house" consisted of a thatch roof supported on
four tree trunks, with a sort of rough divan made of split branches
running along one side of the space below. Walls there were none. A
good fire was blazing under the roof on the bare ground, and a
Papuan native with a very large head was tending a big billycan out
of which issued tempting smells.</p>

<p>There was a small surveyor's tent near which served as
dressing-room to the ladies, and when we had extracted dry clothes
from our "swags," and changed, we came out on to the high, dark,
windy plateau, where the night breeze was crying among the
eucalyptus trees, and the ripple of the Laloki rose up from far
below. The Papuan boy had taken off the billy-can now, and produced
another from a second fire; and we all sat down on the fowl-perch
divan to enjoy milkless tea and curried tin as one only enjoys food
eaten "on the road."</p>

<p>Rolled in our blankets, for the night was quite cold, Mrs.
&mdash;&mdash; and I slept on the fowl-perch (it really did not
look like anything else) to the music of clanking horse-bells. You
tie a large iron bell round your horse's neck when you camp, so
that you may know where he is, and you link his forefeet together
with leathern handcuffs called hobbles so that he cannot wander
very far away. He revenges himself as a rule by walking round and
round your uneasy couch all night long, shaking his head violently.
Towards dawn you get up, and saying things to yourself which you
hope no one overhears, you unstrap the bell, and slap the harmless
creature's face as hard as you can. He sidles away, and you go back
to sleep...And in the morning the boys take an hour to find the
beast in the valley where it has betaken itself. It did not care to
stay about the camp, once you took off that bell.</p>

<p>We were in the coffee country now, nearly two thousand feet
above sea-level. The climate was notably changed. There was still
plenty of heat in the middle of the day, but it was not oppressive,
and the mornings and evenings were crystalline and cool. Fever, I
was not surprised to hear, does not exist in the Astrolabe range
(unless in the case of people who have brought it up with them from
the lowlands), and white people enjoy excellent health.</p>

<p>"What about the natives?" I asked. It had puzzled me a good
deal, during the past day or two, to note that the country was
apparently desolate of all native life. We had not passed a single
house or village, nor had we seen a solitary Papuan on the track,
except a few carriers.</p>

<p>There were villages&mdash;a good many of them&mdash;on the road
we had traversed, I was told. The country was peaceful now, but in
the times when the natives were ceaselessly raiding and killing one
another, it was necessary to build the villages where they could
not easily be found or surprised.</p>

<p>So, if you went off the track and climbed about among the
apparently inaccessible peaks of the high ranges, you would find
village after village, some quite near to the road, others far
away, but all cleverly concealed from sight in the dense
vegetation. Many of them were built on the sides of precipices in
such a way that the inhabitants could only gain access to them by
climbing up long ladders. Others, again, were set on the top of
sharp peaks. There were even some of the celebrated tea houses not
many miles away, but it was not likely that we should have time to
visit them. Anyhow, it was a fact that the natives of that part of
the country were not easily visited. No, they were not hostile;
they simply kept to their old ways, and did not trouble about the
whites. And in any case their numbers were small. Most of the land
about the Astrolabe was vacant; that was one of the reasons for its
becoming a centre of settlement. The Government in Papua did not
allow settlers to have any land that was or might be useful to the
native tribes. Fortunately, there was plenty for all&mdash;millions
of acres in the Territory that nobody needed; and there was plenty
even up here, where the whites had been nibbling about for twenty
years.</p>

<p>I was soon to see for myself. The third day's ride&mdash;a short
and easy one&mdash;led us through tracts of dense dark forest and
over many little ranges unseen in the surrounding "bush," but felt
as we scrambled slowly up and down to our destination for the
present&mdash;a plantation in the very heart of the Astrolabe
mountains, some seven-and-thirty miles from Port Moresby.</p>

<p>It is easy to do the journey in two days, and some of the
residents can do it in one. We had come slowly, as my companion was
not able for trying rides; but we had certainly not lost by the
delay, since there had been all the more time to enjoy the wonders
of the scenery.</p>

<p>Anything more beautiful than the little mountain house to which
we came in the declining sun of the late afternoon was surely never
seen out of a fairy tale. It stood tiptoe on the very peak of a
sharp little hill, with a clump of giant bamboos, like huge green
ostrich plumes a hundred feet high, serving as background to its
quaint prettiness of architecture. It was a mere three-roomed,
one-storeyed bungalow, almost all deep verandah and overhanging
eaves, with a flight of rustic steps leading up to its little brown
door, and a high, deep, palm-thatch roof set low down on its walls
of woven bamboo, like a shady hat pulled over a planter's
sun-browned face. It looked absolutely harmonious, and as much a
part of the place as a bird's nest built in a tree.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust11" id="illust11"></a><img src=
"1501051h-images/TNNG-11.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=
"Illustration">
</p>

<p>William Morris would have liked that little bungalow, for it
unconsciously illustrated many of his ideas; perhaps yet more those
of Ruskin. It was nothing whatever but a small cheap house, put
together out of native materials because planking and iron were
dear and difficult to carry; but it had somehow managed to capture
just that perfect simplicity and inevitable beauty after which our
own "rustic" and "artistic" styles too often toil in vain. The deep
vault of the roof, the immense eaves, the warm brown tones of
thatch and wall, the steps and verandah rails made out of saplings
roughly barked, the windows&mdash;shutters of bamboo panelling that
swung outward on a hinge and fastened with a bar&mdash;all were
perfectly fitted to their end and perfectly satisfying to the eye.
And the view!</p>

<p>When one had climbed slowly up the steep corkscrewed path that
led to the bungalow&mdash;passing between borders of pineapples in
full bearing, and close by a trailing mass of granadilla vine heavy
with varnished fruit&mdash;one stood upon a very small space of
artificially levelled ground, just large enough to support the
house. In front and at each side the red earth fell suddenly away,
so that the tops of the young rubber trees shook their fimbriated
leaves almost under the verandah, and the coffee shrubs made a
quaint pattern of foreshortened foliage right down to the river
below. When one stood upon the steps, the scarlet and pink foliaged
crotons seemed to stretch their leaves right across a small, bright
miniature painting of stream and coffee plantation and green grass
and brown-roofed machine houses, into the high blue sky above the
belt of uncleared trees. It was as if the house had been built upon
a watchtower.</p>

<p>The plantation was a mere handful of some sixty acres snatched
out of the heart of the bush. It lay at the bottom of a cup-shaped
hollow, surrounded on all sides but one by perpendicular walls of
grass and trees. On that one side the river had made an opening,
and through the rent in the dark green tapestry of forest one saw
the far-away blue hills...</p>

<p>All through the Astrolabe mountains one comes every now and
then, unexpectedly, upon these lovely glimpses of sapphire and
hyacinth-coloured ranges, framed in rugged gaps of dark-green
forest...Pages of unwritten poetry every one, full of fantastic
dreams and butterfly fancies that only break in the
capturing...</p>

<p>But in actual travel, one does not often make the proper
reflections at the proper moment&mdash;indeed, it may be taken as a
rule that one makes the wrong and un-proper reflections, at any
time when fine feelings might seem to be called for. I certainly
did not begin poetising about distant views of the Astrolabe on the
moment of our arrival at the coffee plantation. That came days
later. At the moment, I was too hungry to think seriously of
anything except food, though only a Burns Philp pack-mule could
have been totally insensible to the beauty of the place.</p>

<p>We gave the horses to the boys and went into the house. Most of
its furniture was a makeshift, concocted out of local materials,
but there was not a bit of it that you could not have put into an
"interior," and delighted in if you were a great painter. There
were no pictures on the wall, but you could always have
one&mdash;much better than anything Corot or Turner could have done
for you&mdash;by simply swinging wide one of the oblong
bamboo-plait shutters and instantly painting on the wall a
matchless landscape study, four feet by three. The door generally
framed in a larger and more brilliant piece of "genre," composed of
several rose and madder-red croton shrubs, and one or two of bright
daffodil colour, with a butterfly as big as a swallow, and most
brilliantly blue, hovering in the sun above the leaves. The back
door opened upon a picture after the Japanese style&mdash;a
gigantic arcade of feathery bamboos fluttering with the pretty
black and white wings of small birds that came after the drying
coffee. And after dark, that you might not miss the beauties of the
day, fireflies came and made illuminations of ghost-like green all
along the edges of the overhanging thatch, where glass-like drops
of the sunset shower hung still and clear, sending out crystal rays
in the faint light of the lamps inside the house. And all day and
all night the little cool river down below kept on singing.</p>

<p>If luxury is wanting in the life of a Papuan planter beauty
never need run short. There is scarcely a plantation in the
Territory that is not picturesque by nature, and none that cannot
be made so. The more favoured beauty spots&mdash;and of these there
are many&mdash;need little to turn them into very Paradises of
loveliness. Brilliant shrubs and trees take root and grow for the
asking; flowers are neglected for the most part, but would grow,
practically without attention, if once sown. The numbers of rivers
and streams that cut through the mountain ranges and the natural
lie of the ground, always more or less sloping, suggest fountains,
ponds, terraces almost of themselves. There is not one of the
economic products of Papua that is not beautiful in itself.
Moreover, nothing could be more stately than the avenues of
splendid palms that make up a copra plantation. Coffee might well
be grown anywhere as an ornamental shrub of the highest beauty,
apart from its value. Sisal-hemp is to all appearance the same as
the ornamental aloe that is grown in pots all over the Continent.
Rubber is an extremely handsome tree at any stage of growth. I know
well there are many who will laugh at the very idea of considering
appearances where a plantation is concerned; but if a man can
combine the pleasures (which are undoubtedly great) of ornamental
gardening and park-making, with the profit of copra, or coffee, or
rubber trading, it is surely so much to the good for him.</p>

<p>For many weeks after that visit to the Astrolabe, when wandering
about the Territory seeing district after district emerge from
savagery to civilisation and beauty, the vision of certain houses
in England and Ireland used to haunt me with a sense of painfully
wasted forces. The pioneering and reclaiming instinct is so strong
in the whole British race that it finds an outlet in many strange
ways when denied its natural career. I have known well-to-do
families in the country who did their own building, gardening,
baking, soap-making, out of sheer pleasure in handling elemental
things; some who regarded the clearing of a bit of copse, or the
altering of the course of some small stream, or the planting of a
thousand young trees, as a tit-bit much too dainty to be left to
the hands of labourers, and who would ask instead a few favoured
friends to come and enjoy the task in their company. I have seen
men of high education and refinement absorbed in the poor and
unprofitable haying of their own grounds to such an extent that
they could scarcely be got into the house for a meal, and counting
every hundredweight of crop with far more interest than they ever
showed in the harvesting of dividends, patients, or clients.
And&mdash;(<i>pace</i> Emil Reich and his school)&mdash;I have
known hundreds of country ladies who loved the handicrafts of the
house and garden to the full as much as their grandmothers did, and
sadly missed the many absorbing little household tasks that recent
civilisation had placed out of their reach. And I longed to see a
few hundred such people settled in this half-tamed land, to use
their northern energies and their snow-fed strength, and their
dormant powers of organisation, contrivance, adaptation, in the
service of the new young country.</p>

<p>After all, why not? What are the sons of these families doing?
Entering overcrowded professions that will provide bread and butter
for middle age at the price of all their youth, and some thousands
of pounds to boot&mdash;going out to colonies where a living must
be wrenched from bitter soils buried half the year in
snow&mdash;spending their lives in airless offices, with a
fortnight's shooting in the autumn, and a stray week-end on the
golf-links, for all their share of the great out-of-door world that
calls to every Englishman so insistently and often, perforce, so
vainly. It is true that in colonial life, as elsewhere, you cannot
have your cake and eat it. You cannot enjoy the pleasure of
breaking in a new country and the pleasures of all the newest plays
and latest exhibitions at the same time. You cannot shut the door
on that tiresome and costly jade, Society, and yet have her at hand
to amuse an occasional dull moment. It is exciting and pleasant to
follow the hounds and carry a gun across the stubble, and it is
also exciting and pleasant to hunt crocodiles on your plantation
river and make trophies of teeth and jaws, or to go after wild boar
in the hills; but the man who has the one must not look back and
hanker after the other. Still, all in all, the right kind of man
finds the colonial life the more satisfying and profitable of the
two. As for the wrong kind of man, he, like the poor, is always
with us, but, unlike the poor, he is not with us (individually) for
long. You can waste your capital and go to the dogs in Papua just
as completely and as quickly as in London, if you are the kind to
do it.</p>

<p>It may as well be said here as anywhere else that, once for all,
Papua is no country for the man who cannot raise at least a couple
of thousand to start on; no country for the old, the delicate, the
idle, the fine gentleman or fine lady. For the well-bred man who
because of his breeding will turn a hand to anything, and because
of his racial pride will never say die, for the man with youth and
strength and common sense, and the woman who will "do without" and
see him through&mdash;Papua is the country.</p>

<p>Lands are given for nothing (actually, for ten years, and at a
trifling rental for long leases). Seeds and plants are given at
cost price, instruction and advice free. Speculators in land are
kept out, and suitable settlers encouraged in every way. Settlers
without money are not wanted, not asked for, not welcomed&mdash;in
fine, are requested to go elsewhere; but settlers with anything
from two to five thousand may be promised (with ordinary industry
and luck) a fortune in a very few years' time.</p>

<p>To return to the coffee plantation and our visit, Mrs. C. and
myself unpacked our swags and settled down for a week or two; our
escort and the horses went back to port; and we were left, two
solitary women in the Astrolabe mountains, among a heathen and
uncivilised population, with only a couple of white men, some miles
off, in the whole surrounding district. We were on the verge of the
unknown country, as one is in most inland districts of Papua. The
natives in the hills at the back of the plantation had, in some
cases, never seen a white man, and very few of them had ever seen a
white woman, as witness the many personally conducted touring
parties that came down to stare shyly at us during the course of
the next few days. We had only a native girl and man to look after
us, and we were living in a house that was a mere shelter from heat
and rain, as easily broken into as a basket.</p>

<p>Yet we were perfectly safe&mdash;much more than we should have
been under similar conditions in the suburbs of any great city. The
truth is that the Papuan native in these days scarcely ever attacks
white men, and certainly never does so in the plantation districts.
They do not mean him harm, he knows; they have not taken away his
land; they employ him at times on the plantation, and pay him and
feed him well for his work; they give him tobacco for his fruit and
vegetables when he wants to trade&mdash;why should he destroy the
goose that lays these golden eggs? It is true that he keeps up his
old habits of murder and man-eating on the sly, but he gracefully
conceals these little failings from the whites as far as possible,
fearing, like Martin Chuzzlewit's American Colonel, "to awaken
their prejudice."</p>

<p>It is perfectly true that the country about us and at the back
was fairly reeking with murder at the time; and it is also true
that the murders were so inexpressibly humorous that no one could
have heard of them without laughing&mdash;which sounds heartless,
but is nevertheless a fact.</p>

<p>Example: A and B, two fine young men from a mountain village,
were walking along the banks of the Laloki, when they came upon a
third, a man who was rather ill, and asked their help to get across
the river. They did not feel inclined to give it, because the
invalid would probably have bothered them all the rest of the way
to their destination. But they did not feel inclined to leave him
planted there either. So one of them put his head under water and
the other held his legs till he was drowned. After which they
continued the walk.</p>

<p>Example 2: C, D, E, and F were out for a happy day in the
country. They came upon two men by themselves. C, D, E, and F
murdered them and went on their way. When asked in court afterwards
why they committed such a deed, they explained that "the two men
looked so very cold and hungry!"</p>

<p>Example 3: A young man killed his father. No cause apparent. The
strong arm of the British Government took hold of him, and he was
asked if he could "assign any reason for the rash act" before the
passing of sentence. The native interpreter of the High Court
replied, after putting the question to the prisoner (who did not
seem to feel his position at all acutely): "He says, Sir, that the
old man was not much good to anybody."</p>

<p>In all these cases the murderers were imprisoned for several
years.</p>

<p>If we had met any of the culprits (as no doubt we did meet and
converse with others, undiscovered) we should have found them
pleasant, well-mannered men, ready to trade for a bit of tobacco or
act as guide to a village with the utmost amiability. Truly,
Gilbert's enterprising burglar, who was so pleasant and sociable
when not engaged actively in his profession, would have felt at
home in Papua.</p>

<p>It must be understood, therefore, that I have no moving tales of
personal peril to relate, in spite of the fact that we two women
were left alone, among a population largely consisting of
murderers, in the interior of savage New Guinea. We passed the
fortnight of our stay very pleasantly and quietly. There was not so
much opportunity for out-of-door excursions as one could have
wished, since we were in the heart of the rainy season, and, in the
mountains, that means at least half the day in the house. The
mornings were exquisitely fine as a rule, displaying the perilous
beauty of light and colour that, in every climate, inevitably
suggests something too good to last. About noon the sky would cloud
over, and punctually at one or thereabouts the mist-wreaths would
begin their witches' dance against the dark green rampart of forest
over against the house. In another quarter of an hour it would be
raining as if the Rona waterfall had been lifted into the sky above
the valley and then let go. The red earth would run rivers, the
young rubber trees would bend and droop beneath the deluge, the
deep thatched eaves of the house would send down a continuous
waterfall. If you looked closely at the leaves near the verandah,
you would see under many a one some prudent butterfly clinging
upside down, its great green or blue or golden wings clapped close
together, so as to get the full benefit of the shelter. Most of the
birds retired into the close-set labyrinth of the bamboo trunks,
there to preen and chatter like a company of schoolgirls all the
afternoon. The wonderful blue landscape framed in by the gap in the
valley put on a veil of grey mist and disappeared. As for
ourselves, I am constrained to admit that we generally lay down for
a siesta, covered up with a warm cloak (what a delight it was to
need it!) until it was time for afternoon coffee.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust12" id="illust12"></a><img src=

</p>

<p>And what coffee it was! I had heard down in Port Moresby that
the quality of the berries on the Astrolabe range was exceptionally
good. This, however, had impressed me not at all, because I had
learned by experience in many countries that every plantation in
the world surpasses every other of the same kind in the quality of
its products. But when Mrs. C. and I tasted the Astrolabe
coffee...</p>

<p>Well, we knew no moderation after that. There was only a
fortnight to enjoy in full something that we should never get
again, and we lost no time. The cook-boy's life was made a
weariness to him by reason of the number of times he was called on
to roast and shell handfuls of beans from the verandah, and the
open fire in the little cookhouse outside was never without a tall
tin pot "drawing" within reach of the warmth. It was certainly the
very best coffee that I had ever tasted; one could fancy it served
by the dark-eyed houris to the faithful in a Mussulman's dream of
Paradise. I was not surprised to hear that the guests at the
Christmas house-parties sometimes held on that plantation suffer so
much from want of sleep that they have all been found at once
wandering helplessly among the coffee bushes at two o'clock in the
morning, unable to rest! Fine though it may be in flavour, this
coffee is much stronger than a novice would suppose, and ten or
twelve cups in a day is enough to upset the nerves of the
strongest.</p>

<p>The reader who knows all about coffee will pardon a little
digression here for the sake of his less favoured brethren.</p>

<p>Coffee is a rather small bush, not more than three or four feet
high when well tended. It has dark varnished leaves very like those
of the laurestinus. It flowers, in Papua, three or four times a
year, for only a day or two at a time, the flowers being small,
white, and exquisitely scented. Later, the branches are covered
with small scarlet berries much like a cherry. The stone of the
berry is the coffee "bean." Picking lasts as a rule from January to
March, successive crops following each other closely on the trees.
Each plantation has its pulping-house, where the berries are
separated from the "beans" by a simple machine which can be worked
by a couple of men. This machine, in medium sizes, costs only about
thirty pounds. The berries are poured into a hopper, through which,
driven by a stream of water, they pass into a compartment which is
partly blocked by a metal disc. This disc is covered with sharp
projections, against which the berries arc crushed as the handle of
the machine is turned. The "bean" is thus pressed out of its
succulent envelope, and separated into two lobes, covered with a
gluey saccharine matter in which they are allowed to lie until a
slight fermentation takes place, when they are washed in several
waters and dried in large trays. The "parchment" or inner skin of
the bean is not removed but allowed to remain; usually, the buyer
of the coffee has it taken off by machinery of a more complicated
and expensive kind than the pulping-machine.</p>

<p>As regards the prices obtainable, the coffee industry is
severely handicapped by the Australian duty of threepence a pound
(which will probably be removed before long), but even under these
circumstances it has been made to pay. There is not a coffee
plantation in Papua at the present date run on economical and
businesslike lines. Nearly all the work is left to natives, who
know only so much as a Papuan overseer, himself ignorant and
careless, can teach them. Carriage, owing to the lack of roads, is
very costly. And yet the plantations somehow or other pay for their
keep. The moral is obvious.</p>

<p>A small plantation of fifty acres or so should cost about £200
to clear and plant, and, if carefully looked after, should be run
for about £350 to £450 a year, including £200 salary for a manager.
Coffee, in the Astrolabe country, bears in two years, so the
planter has not long to wait for his returns. About 5 to 7 cwt. an
acre may be safely reckoned on, and this sells, in Port Moresby,
for £60 a ton, or if graded by a machine that costs the planter
about £100 to buy and set up, £90 a ton.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the growing and preparing of the coffee that
any sensible man cannot manage for himself, with the aid of a few
of the best and most recent handbooks. The native labour is not
equal to that of Ceylon or Malaysia, being less intelligent and
more expensive. It suffices for the purpose, however, and one must
always remember that neither in Ceylon nor Malaysia can the planter
obtain valuable estates for nothing.</p>

<p>The rains, even in the rainy season, generally clear off about
sunset. Waked up by the afternoon coffee, we were usually ready to
enjoy that wonderful display when it came, and six to half-past
found us on the verandah looking out over the valley.</p>

<p>In Port Moresby the sunsets had been a marvellous riot of
flaming jewel-like colours, shot through by a certain peculiar and
very lovely blue that I never noticed in the sunsets of any other
land. Up here in this green cup of the hills they were quite
different, but equally wonderful in their way. When the sun had
sunk in an angry welter of red and copper, just before the dusk
carne on, the whole valley would fill up with a tide of translucent
green as if the sea had suddenly submerged us under a thousand feet
of clear salt water. This extraordinary afterglow lasted about a
quarter of an hour, and then darkened down into night. With the
first rising of the green tide burst forth in an unanimous chorus
the evening cry of the crickets, like thousands of little whistles
all sounding together, or like the escape-valves of a myriad of toy
steam-engines&mdash;so loud that it was necessary to raise one's
voice in speaking while the chorus lasted. It was of short
duration. When the light went out the crickets ceased, and the
frogs, who had been croaking and crying like strange birds from the
river below all the time of the sunset, crept into their marshes
and were silent. Outside the stage, I never imagined anything so
completely Wagnerian in my life. Light, sound,
<i>mise-en-scène,</i> were all the spirit of the Nibelungen Ring.
And if the wild dance of the mist-maidens across the dark
hill-sides early in the afternoons was not a Valkyrie-Ride, or the
very next thing to it, then no natural phenomenon ever suggested an
idea to a poet since time and poets began.</p>

<p>One cannot recommend the Astrolabe country as a suitable
residence for the aged or the infirm. It is almost entirely made up
of hills. When you leave the bungalow door you plunge down a
descent as steep as a waterfall or crawl up a height like a sharply
sloped roof, reversing the process when you return. This is
supposed to be very good for the coffee. It is also good for the
planters' muscles, without doubt. One begins, after a little of
this sort of exercise, to understand why the native of the high
mountain ranges is said to be unable to walk when he comes down to
the flat for the first time. It is a fact that the mountain tribes
do seem to suffer a little when travelling on the flat, until they
get accustomed to it, and that they step "high and disposedly,"
like Queen Elizabeth when she danced, until they learn to alter
their mode of walking.</p>

<p>The weather was so wet in the afternoons, and all the tracks
were in such a state of bog, that we could not go about the country
as much as we wished, and had to amuse ourselves watching the small
operations of the plantation. The coffee of the last two pickings
was being seasoned and dried in the sun. This needed constant
watchfulness on the part of the native workers, to seize and carry
under the house all the huge trays with which the backyard was
spread as soon as the sky became overcast, and to carry them out
again as soon as a gleam of sun appeared. Weeding was always going
on among the trees, and at the picking season there was no doubt a
good deal of stir, if one had been there to see. But, on the whole,
the work of the place went forward so quietly that one scarce
noticed it at all.</p>

<p>One of the chief events of the day was to see what our nearest
neighbour's shooting-boy would bring in. His employer kindly shared
the game with us, as there was generally more than he needed, and
we had no means of obtaining fresh meat for ourselves. When the big
Papuan appeared below the verandah, shaking the rain out of his
huge mop of hair like a water-dog, and dripping little rivers from
every curve and corner of his naked brown body, it was as good as a
dip into a lucky-bag to see him open his netted string sack and
spill out its contents. Pea-green parrots with yellow
wings&mdash;parrots blue and grey and crimson&mdash;parrots almost
all white; pigeons with iridescent breasts&mdash;great hornbills as
large as a turkey, with incredible bills that looked like masks put
on for fun; Gaura pigeons (a true pigeon as big as a goose, with
clusters of beautiful grey aigrettes on its head), a plump young
wallaby, a hind-quarter of wild pig; some indescribable bird that
we had never heard of and could not identify&mdash;for what we
knew, it might be a new species&mdash;but we ate it all the same;
these were some of the things that used to appear on the verandah
towards the sunset hour. I would have given a good deal for the
company of that omniscient character who always makes one of a
shipwrecked party in a book of adventure, and who can tell the
sailors where to look for edible nuts and roots, and what fruits
are poisonous, and the Latin name, personal habits, and domestic
history of every bird, beast, and reptile that the exceedingly
miscellaneous desert island contains. He might have saved us more
than once, if all the truth were known, from the hideous disgrace
of making a dinner off some bird that a hundred scientific swords
would have leaped from their scabbards to defend had the orgy taken
place within hail of civilisation.</p>

<p>Within the last few months the beautiful Gaura pigeon, all the
birds of paradise, and one or two other species, have been placed
under legal protection. At the time of my visit this was not the
case, and we might have plumed ourselves from head to foot with
bird of paradise tails had we wanted. It was only a little while
since a nest of these beautiful creatures had been found in the
midst of the bamboo clump at the back of the house, and the bush
all round seemed to be full of the "Raggiana"&mdash;the commonest
kind&mdash;although I only once saw a bird. Their cry was
unmistakable, a harsh and rather ugly call that one was sure to
hear two or three times a day. I was always on the look out for
them, like everyone who goes to New Guinea, and always being
disappointed. The comet-like flash of a long orange tail across the
track, one day when I was riding through the hills, was all I
actually saw of these famous birds. I do not fancy the fault was
mine, as almost every traveller has the same tale to tell, unless
his journeying has been undertaken with the object of collecting
birds. In that case a camp is made in the best-known haunts and the
whole day given up to searching and snaring. Even so, the hunters
may be days without catching a glimpse of anything remarkable.</p>

<p>It was tantalising to know that Raggianas, Gaura pigeons, the
beautiful black-velvet rifle-bird, possibly a "magnificent" or two,
with their incredibly long tail feathers, and other rare and lovely
species, were close beside us in the bush all day, and yet never to
see one. The extraordinary bird noises that sounded night and day
out of the forest were, however, some consolation. Birds in New
Guinea laugh, chatter, curse, ring bells, saw wood, make all kinds
of noises except one&mdash;singing. The butcher bird has a pretty
note in the early mornings, not unlike the English blackbird, and
there is a small black and white creature closely resembling a
Willie Wagtail, that chirps very sweetly. But for the most part the
birds devote their energies to the most amazing clowneries. The
leather-neck&mdash;an ugly dark-coloured creature, not at all
shy&mdash;scolds and carps in companies high up in the trees,
exactly like a party of quarrelsome old washerwomen. The bell-bird
sounds a clear tinktink from the unseen depths of the bush, so like
the bell of a pack-horse that it is often hard to distinguish the
two. There is a pheasant that makes a noise exactly imitating the
glug-glug of water being poured out of a narrow-necked bottle, even
to the sudden rush at the end. Another chops wood all night long,
like a goblin forester. Another cracks a loud cart-whip
continually. Yet another saws and planes industriously in an unseen
recess of the liana-tangled trees. The cockatoos scream in a note
that is the very acme of shrewish indignation when the tread of a
horse or the pad of a human foot sounds in the solitary gorges that
they love to keep to themselves. The crows laugh hideously; the
parrots chuckle and squeal; the bird of paradise&mdash;I am sorry
to have to say it, but it is true&mdash;simply squawks. One hears
little of all this chorus while on the road, but at night or in the
early morning, if one is camped near the bush, the noises are
strange enough to send a "new chum" almost out of his mind.</p>

<p>Many of the most beautiful birds are only to be met with above a
certain height. The blue bird of paradise is not found below the
five-thousand-foot point, and the "magnificent" also prefers the
higher ranges. Now that protective legislation has been introduced
there is no danger of these wonderful and beautiful birds becoming
extinct; but before the laws that forbid the exportation of birds
were passed, so many thousands were sent away each year that there
was every reason to fear rapid extermination.</p>

<p>In German and Dutch New Guinea birds of paradise are not
protected, and the supply is still kept up to the European markets
from these sources. It is probable that along the boundaries
between the three countries there will be a good deal of migration
later on when the birds have been hunted up to the dividing line,
and that Papua will eventually become a refuge for the whole tribe
of birds of paradise.</p>

<p>I might write a good deal about these birds&mdash;about their
exquisite plumage, the dancing-grounds which they clear for
themselves beneath the high trees so that they can display their
beauty and grace before each other in wonderful evolutions of
stepping and springing; the many different varieties that are found
in various places; but that I feel myself restrained by the
drawback of utter ignorance. I have read a good deal about birds of
paradise, as anyone in England may. I wanted to see them, but I did
not succeed in doing so except in the instance mentioned above. Not
one in ten if the white inhabitants of Papua ever does sec a bird
of paradise alive, and not one in a hundred out of the thousand or
so of whites has been fortunate enough to see the dancing-grounds.
How many Englishmen have seen a reed-warbler at home? How many
could produce a kingfisher at short notice for the pleasure of a
curious guest?</p>

<p>With some diffidence&mdash;since it is disturbing to find
oneself in opposition to writers of standing and celebrity&mdash;I
would here offer the opinion that books of travel are all the
better, though possibly the narrower, when the writer confines
himself to his own personal knowledge and experience as far as
possible. It is easy enough and showy enough to make a handsome
volume out of one's own experiences padded out with the doings and
sayings of as many others as possible; to add flounces of borrowed
history, geography, ethnology, and philology on to the meagre robe
of the traveller's personal observations and thoughts&mdash;in
fine, to make a "work" out of a mere book by processes familiar to
every reader and reviewer. The result, however, is in most cases
the destruction of any little independent value that the book may
possess. If one is not qualified for the task of unravelling the
complications of Papuan race and language, for trained observation
of scientific or zoologic phenomena, for the collecting of
folk-lore and noting of native customs, one may regret the
deficiency, and may even, in the midst of such a wonderful field as
Papua, deplore the unfortunate tendency of Providence to "send
walnuts to those who have no teeth," but it is best not to try and
remedy the evil. Every traveller has his own point of view: let him
use it for what it is worth. There are quite as many readers
desirous of knowing how white people live in New Guinea, how one
gets about the country, what adventures one meets with, what money
can be made in Australia's new colony, as there are readers who
wish to be enlightened on the question of how the original
inhabitants got there or what form of stone celt has been longest
in use. For the former alone I write. Not everybody can get to New
Guinea, and the number of travellers who really see something of
the country is still so small that each should offer what he can to
the sum of general knowledge, poor though the offering may be.</p>

<p>There are always collectors in Papua&mdash;Baron Rothschild's
employés, men sent out by the governing bodies of scientific
institutions, private workers. The country is famous among
entomologists for the number of new species of insects that it
produces, and bird-collectors rarely go away without something
hitherto unknown to add to the science of ornithology. It costs a
good many hundred pounds to fit out even the smallest of these
expeditions, and the larger ones run into thousands. They can
hardly "pay" from the commercial point of view, even though the
value of the new finds is very large. No doubt they arc not
expected to do so. It is the planter, the prospector, the leisurely
traveller, who could make money out of Papua's rarities, animal and
vegetable, if he only had knowledge enough to turn to account all
that he sees. He never has the knowledge, however; like myself, he
passes the pale wreaths of orchids in the forests and wonders if
the bloom is a well-known species worth a shilling, or something
new worth its weight in diamonds, and can't guess, and leaves it
there. Or he catches a brilliant butterfly in the net the
plantation hands use for crayfish-hunting in the river, admires it,
sees that it has a body as big as his own finger, which will have
to be stuffed if he wants to preserve the creature, and lets it go.
A week after he meets a Rothschild collector, who shows him a big
green butterfly with a fat body, and says casually that it is a new
kind and worth fifty pounds. He recognises the insect, and spends
the next week looking out for another&mdash;that fifty pounds would
buy him two more horses&mdash;but it never comes back again. Or he
meets a bird-hunting party coming down from the high ranges and
sees them rejoice immoderately over a couple of small finches and a
minute lory among the big brilliant birds of their catch. These
small specimens are absolutely new, they say, and heaven only knows
what the men of science will not say they prove or
disprove&mdash;in any case, there will be a dozen purchasers ready
to weigh those tiny bodies against ten-pound notes by and by...The
planter, who perhaps has begun his place on a too limited capital,
and is sadly cramped in consequence, wonders what the clouds of
birds that come picking among his coffee or hemp for insects may be
worth, if a man could only tell which were the specimens that
science had caught and branded, and which, in the language of the
cattle-station, were still "clean-skins." There might be the worth
of a shed full of new machinery in the carcase of any one of those
screaming little nuisances...</p>

<p>A good book or two on orchids, on butterflies, on tropic birds,
with plates, would he a valuable investment for many a plantation,
apart altogether from the interest that it would lend to the
surroundings of the planter's life.</p>

<p>What with butterfly chasing, short but dirty rambles, swimming
in a river guaranteed to be free from crocodiles, but certainly
infested with leeches reading, loafing, and watching the work of
the plantation, a week or more passed quickly. On an evening that
was rather less wet than usual we heard the distant jangle of
pack-horse bells, and knew that our escort had returned. Next
morning we made a start for Warirata, some seventeen miles away,
where we were to spend the night.</p>

<p>A thousand feet we mounted during the day, the air growing
cooler and brighter mile by mile, the wonderful great gorges and
valleys spreading out ever wider and wider below the narrow ridges
on which we climbed along. The clouds gathered under us in rolling
seas, though we were less than three thousand feet up; they rose
and drifted and danced, long and ghost-like, upon the dark sappy
green of the opposite hills, and at last they wrapped us altogether
round, and burst upon us in cataracts of heavy mountain rain. Up
something that might have been a road, and might have been a river,
but was an unsatisfactory sample of either&mdash;because you
couldn't swim in it, nor could you walk along it
comfortably&mdash;we led our sliding horses, and slid and slipped
ourselves, until in the dark we came upon the lights of the little
plantation house at Warirata, and knew we were going to be clean
and dry and fed again before very long.</p>

<p>If one wants to travel in New Guinea one must not mind getting
dirty, both frequently and excessively. We did not mind, nor did
our hosts, the plantation manager and his wife, object to the
incursion of three exceedingly wet and miry creatures into their
sitting-room. Nobody does mind "clean dirt" in the Territory; you
are sure to want hanging out over a line whenever you come in after
a ride or a walk. Our swags, great sacks of painted canvas, were
taken off' the pack-horses; we retired and tidied up; and then came
supper. One never knows how welcome supper can be until one has
climbed a mountain to get it and been wet through in the
process.</p>

<p>The little estate of Warirata was, like the last we had visited,
planted with coffee. Like almost every plantation in New Guinea, it
was insufficiently financed, and I fear me it did not bring in much
profit to anyone. If it did not bring profit, however, it certainly
brought pleasure to very many, for of all the beautiful places to
be found in the Astrolabe range there is not one that comes up to
Warirata for sheer loveliness.</p>

<p>The house itself was scarcely beautiful, being of the popular
tin-roofed colonial type, with walls of some sort of composition
that resembled very thick paper. It was the surroundings that gave
the estate its real attraction, and brought party after party of
visitors up from Port Moresby to see it, in spite of the twenty
miles of bad road that lay between. From the front of the verandah
we could see the whole magnificent thirteen thousand feet of Mount
Victoria scaling up into heaven, range after range, step after
step, in a colossal flight of skyward-sweeping stairs. It looked as
if one could get to the top in a couple of days, or three at most,
taking things easy and camping at night. As a matter of fact, the
great mountain was so far away and approached by so many dividing
foot-hills that three weeks would have been good time. Mount
Victoria has been ascended more than once, and is fairly well
known. Practically all climates, from torrid to frigid, are found
upon its slopes. It is below the perpetual snow line, but snow
falls occasionally upon the upper peaks, and the smaller streams
are constantly coated with ice.</p>

<p>The whole peak is not visible during the day, as a rule. Like
most New Guinea peaks, Mount Victoria is veiled in mist during the
greater part of the forenoon and afternoon. Only in the early
morning is the whole mountain to be seen. It is well worth getting
up for.</p>

<p>A couple of hundred yards away, on the other side of the house,
there was yet another wonderful prospect. One followed the crest of
the hill to its very edge, and there, where the mountain range
broke off into a sharp descent of a thousand feet or more, with
another eighteen hundred sloping away below, one could see across
twenty miles of country, spread out small and fine like a map, with
silver threads of rivers winding across it, and distant forests
close set as fur upon the limbs of the giant hills. Beyond this
wide extent of flat, the sea seemed to rise up high in the air,
delicate and blue and finely wrinkled, set with one or two large
pale islands, and edged by a waving coastline that trended
gradually away to the south-eastward. Port Moresby lay hidden
behind a hill, but the road leading to it was plainly visible for
the greater part of the way.</p>

<p>The air on this high plateau was quite cold in the morning and
at night, warm during the day, but not oppressively hot. As it was
then the middle of the hot and rainy season, the difference between
Warirata and Port Moresby was all the more noticeable. We had left
decidedly oppressive weather&mdash;hot nights without a breath of
air, still steamy days&mdash;in the plains below. Less than three
thousand feet had made all this difference, and we were within a
day's ride of the port.</p>

<p>At the time of my visit it was supposed that Warirata would
eventually be used as a Government Sanatorium, but a rival site was
fixed upon not long after on the summit of Hombron Bluff, a
mountain rather nearer to Port Moresby. By the time these lines are
in print it is probable that the Hombron Bluff station will be
completed, and that any resident of Port Moresby will be able to
enjoy a Saturday to Monday in the cool mountain climate after an
easy half-day's journey.</p>

<p>There was a price to pay for that beautiful view, and we found
it out when we started off down the Port Moresby track. As a
general rule beautiful views do have to be paid for, but one always
forgets that part of it when admiring the picture. Still, even if
we had remembered, we should have said it was worth while.</p>

<p>Everywhere in Papua one is confronted with the tantalising
certainty that the absolutely unknown lies close to one's track. Up
here in Warirata, which has been a favourite resort with Port
Moresby people for more than twenty years, the unexplored lands lie
under one's very eye. This tall, blue mountain seemingly less than
a day's march away, has never been ascended. That whole extent of
wave-tossed green, like a stormy sea turned to hill and forest, is
the beginning of a great stretch unknown as yet to the white man.
There, in that mere patch of bush, lying some miles below, one of
the smartest bushmen in Papua was lost with his carriers for days,
and had to make a rush back for the coast, depending solely on the
guns for food. Go a couple of days' travel in almost any direction
you may mention and you strike into country where no one has ever
been. It is fascinating, and maddening, too. Why cannot one take a
rifle and a couple of carriers and a few days' food and plunge down
at once into the mysterious untrodden districts that look so near?
Why does not someone go?</p>

<p>Well, after even a few days' travel on the well-known tracks one
has a glimmering of the barriers that block up unknown ways. The
inland districts are simply a series of precipitous ridges, or
rather wedges, that succeed one another without a yard of flat
ground. Mountain tribesmen brought down to the coast often find
themselves unable to walk with comfort for weeks, as they have
never set foot on any level ground. This sort of surface makes
progress inconceivably slow, and, further, the jungle off the
tracks is so dense that all the way must be hacked out with axes
and tomahawks. Generally no food can be obtained save what is
carried by the men. If the carriers desert, as they often do, the
explorer is left to play skipping-rope with the scythe of Death,
and get back to the world of white men again in time if he can.</p>

<p>Stanley's journey to Central Africa was a mere picnic-party
compared with the lot of the New Guinea explorer. There have been a
good many such from time to time. More Governments than one have
spent money on the country. Private capitalists of a scientific
turn have sent armed and provisioned columns into the mysterious
island-continent, and still you cannot sail an hour along the coast
or travel a day into the interior without coming in sight of
untouched lands. Papua keeps her secrets well.</p>

<p>For all that, there is, and has been for many years, a very
large extent of safe, known, and accessible country available for
settlement. In a country twice as large as England there is room
for a good deal of unexplored land, and its existence does not
trouble the settler, who knows all about his own little estate, and
has no need to occupy himself with what may lie beyond.</p>

<p>We started for port early in the morning. About seven o'clock a
disciple of G. P. R. James "might have observed three travellers on
horseback making their way down the narrow and winding track that
leads from the wild and romantic regions of the Astrolabe range to
the little town of Port Moresby." He might also have observed that
the travellers were only moderately clean in appearance, and that
they further defied the dramatic unities of the situation by
hanging their steeds over with pannikins, billys, baskets, bundles,
lanterns, and even bottles. One fears that they would have made but
a poor impression at the inevitable inn of early Victorian romance.
However, we were so far behind the early Victoria here&mdash;being,
in point of fact, somewhere in the Middle Ages&mdash;that there was
not such a thing as a roadside inn to be anticipated in the length
and breadth of the Territory.</p>

<p>Inside of half an hour the procession had (as is usual in the
mountains) resolved itself into its primary constituents, and three
human beings were sliding and scrambling after three horses down a
scratch in the mountain-side that might have been taken for a drain
or an earthquake crack or a giant flight of stairs in exceedingly
bad repair&mdash;for anything you like, in fact, except what it
was&mdash;a track. The hopping and slipping and climbing and
crashing through long grass and bushes, and going up nasty rises
that all too visibly dropped down again within the next two hundred
yards, went on for over an hour, and then, just as we were
preparing to mount and reap the reward of our hard work in an easy
canter along the level, came an urgent messenger from a copper
mine, far above our heads, begging us to come up and stay for
lunch...</p>

<p>One almost wanted wings to get to the top of the pyramidical
hill on which was perched the miners' camp. But once up, there was
a brilliant view of the Laloki Valley, and a fresh, cool wind
blowing through the little bird-cage hut, and plenty of tea. So we
stopped, as invited, and I had my first view of a miners' camp.</p>

<p>I do not know just what I had expected&mdash;something like Bret
Harte's early Californian stories possibly, or else something that
recalled the exciting tales told of Australian mining fields in the
early days of a rush. Whatever I expected, however, it was not what
I saw. Papua always presents one with the unexpected. I had before
this been almost painfully impressed with the rigid respectability
of Port Moresby, as compared with the lawless lotus lands of the
true South Seas, but it had not prepared me for the miners' camp of
the Astrolabe ranges in the latter end of 1907.</p>

<p>There were at that time only three claims in this particular
valley&mdash;all copper, and all, it is said, exceptionally rich.
That which I saw belonged to a couple of young retired Government
officials, both gentlemen, and excellently educated and mannered,
in spite of their rough miner dress. Their hut was only a hut, but
it was clean and tidy. Their "boy" served lunch much as it is
served in Sydney, and we all talked "Shakespeare and the musical
glasses," afterwards looking down over the lonely Laloki Valley to
where the unknown countries and the undiscovered mineral riches lie
waiting for the pioneer....Next to the safety of Papua, its
respectability is certainly the dominant feature.</p>

<p>I shall have more to say about these mines later on.</p>

<p>At the time of my visit there was little to see, and we were in
a hurry to get on our road again. Some months later a considerable
development of the Astrolabe field took place, and the mines are
now in a fair way to prove themselves a paying property.</p>

<p>After that one headlong descent, the rest of the twenty miles
was easy going. The last seven were along a real carriage road,
which so excited the horses that they promptly bolted, and the last
of the way home resolved itself into a series of races, not a
little astonishing when one considered how much our steeds had
done. But the New Guinea horse, like many other things in this
astonishing country, is a good deal better than he looks.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="caption">The simple savage and his simple life&mdash;Off
to the Purari River&mdash;A day aground&mdash;Western war
canoes&mdash;The town of the
devil-temples&mdash;"Pig!"&mdash;Plantation recruiting&mdash;The
secret of the Rabi&mdash;Into the innermost chamber&mdash;What is
it?&mdash;Lost in the delta&mdash;The praying of the
Mantis&mdash;The light that failed&mdash;Iai, the place to spend a
happy day&mdash;"Thalatta!"</p>

<p>HAVING seen something of plantation life (I was to see much more
afterwards), the labour question naturally became interesting to
me. A good deal depends upon names and terms in the matter of
"interest." The "problem of the labour supply of Papua" sounds like
something extremely dry; but it is likely to awake an interest
little short of passionate in the breast of anyone who really
understands the conditions of Papuan life. For it is certain that
the whole future of the colony turns on the question of whether the
native supply of workers is sufficient to keep the plantations,
present and future, in going order, or whether it is not.</p>

<p>The native population of the colony is large&mdash;about
three-quarters of a million by the latest estimates. In some
districts the natives have made a habit of engaging themselves for
plantation or carrying work, and a supply is always to be depended
on. In other parts of the country&mdash;especially those not fully
opened up&mdash;the idea of working for wages has never entered the
native's mind; he knows nothing of the white man or his ways, and
does not even understand the nature of money. Other districts still
are in a stage of transition. Now and then a shipload of young men
goes away to the plantations, returning in a year or in three years
to their village life&mdash;possibly to stay at home for good,
possibly to go back to work after a year or so. On the whole, the
supply of workers keeps up satisfactorily, and I have never seen a
plantation that was short of labour, although I have heard a good
many melancholy prophecies as to what may happen in the future.</p>

<p>It is hard, in these primitive places of the earth, to believe
that the admirers of the gentle savage in his natural state, the
passionate advocates of the "simple life" for black and white
alike, whom one meets so constantly at home, can be genuine in
their belated Rousseauism of idea&mdash;can really think that it is
a wrong against the savage to take him out of his natural state and
introduce him to new wants and new aspirations. The truth is that
these city-bred sentimentalists, who are so ready to discourse upon
the natural man and his virtues, do not know what they are talking
about. They are like the much-quoted German philosopher who first
evolved the idea of a camel out of his inner consciousness of what
a camel ought to be, and then lectured upon the natural history of
camels in general. The natural man, to take the definition that
seems generally accepted by the sentimental-crank school, is
stronger and healthier than his civilised brother. He is full of a
simple generosity and a supernatural innocence. He has no work to
do, and is the better for it. The generous earth provides him with
food unasked. He understands "herbs and simples," and possesses
medical secrets unknown to the College of Physicians. He loves
fresh air and pure water, and feeds by preference on fruits and the
inevitable herbs, with which all primitive virtue is inextricably
bound up in the mind of the simple-lifer. (One would like to ask
the simple-lifer for his definition of herbs; I have never yet met
with one who could go beyond the bunches of dried flavourings that
may be seen hung to the ceiling of cottage kitchens.) He has keener
sight and hearing than any civilised person. He will give you
everything he has and want nothing in return. He spends his time in
innocent sports with his pleasing wife and charming children, and
is in every way a worthier person than yourself&mdash;"instead of
which" you go about trying to make him drink gin and use fountain
pens...</p>

<p>Alas for the coldness of the cold truth concerning the natural
man!</p>

<p>There never was in any country or state of society known to
history such a savage as that pictured by the simple-lifer. A few
uncivilised races&mdash;very few&mdash;have a finer physique than
the ordinary white man; the Zulu or the Samoan, for example. No
savage race in the mass is equal to the white race in pluck and
endurance. No single savage but can be matched and surpassed by
some white in any feat of strength or agility he may perform. As
for the sentimental side, most savages require a full return,
direct or indirect, for anything they give, and all will take
everything they can get. It is a mistake to suppose that any
uncivilised man has no work to do&mdash;the mere defence of his
village in a savage state entails heavy labour in the building of
war canoes, making of stockades, manufacturing all sorts of
weapons. Game, moreover, must be hunted and houses built and kept
in repair. The generous earth does not grow his food for nothing.
Yams, taro, manioc, and other nourishing roots require more
cultivation than potatoes or cabbages. Of really wild fruit there
is little in any country; and cultivated fruits require care. His
knowledge of herbs passes over nineteen-twentieths of the useful
plants of his country, and only includes the remaining fraction
because some of them are good to eat or to paint your face with,
and others to poison your enemy. His medicine is sorcery pure and
simple. He shuts out every breath of air from his hut if he can
manage to do so, and washes only when he is caught out in the rain.
He eats roots out of his garden when he cannot get meat, and meat
when he cannot get superfluous aunt or undesirable neighbour. He
sees and hears things in the bush which a new chum misses, but his
eyes and ears, tried by medical tests, are no better than those of
the white man. His life is a tissue of murder, fraud, and
oppression, and his pleasing wife (one of a large number, regular
and irregular) never enjoys a moment's pleasure, amusement, or
peace during the whole of her miserable life if he can help it. As
for the "health of the primitive savage," it is at best not much to
boast of. Primitive man grows up at fourteen, is middle-aged at
twenty-eight, and usually dies before fifty. He takes everything
that is going in the way of disease, and takes it very badly. In
spite of the fact that he lives without clothes, he is liable to
bad colds. He suffers from some skin disease, usually repulsive, in
three or four cases out of ten; he gets tumours and cancers, and
dies of them, just as if he were a City grocer, and he can even
show you some very pretty cases of hypochondria and hysteria if you
like to look for them.</p>

<p>Such is primitive man, in almost all uncivilised countries. Such
he is in Papua; and it is from this simplicity of existence that
the plantation owner lures him away, to corrupt him with the
complexities of civilisation, give him good wages and regular
meals, provide him with a blanket and mosquito-net for the night,
and a calico loin-cloth for the day, teach him to wash himself and
keep his hands off other people's goods, and give him the habit of
regular and steady work.</p>

<p>If the planter is not a missionary, and one of the best kind,
then the name of missionary has no meaning. As a matter of sober
fact, he does a good deal more reclaiming and improving than all
the missions put together. In so doing he has benefited himself as
well as the native. So has the missionary. But he gets all the
credit, and the planter gets none.</p>

<p>If this is a digression, it is a necessary one. There are very
many good people, at home and in Australia, who are quite certain
that the native is wronged by those who wish to develop his mind
and change his ways of living. I hope, by showing the real facts of
the case, gathered on the spot, to convince them of their
mistake.</p>

<p>Returning to the question of the supply of labour, there were,
and still are, different opinions on that point. I heard every
variety while in Port Moresby. Some laughed at the idea of any
possible shortage. Others were convinced that most of the
plantations would be "held up" for want of boys in less than a
year. Others did not know. Others again were sure that they, or
their special friends, would never want, because they had the
invaluable knack of "getting on with natives" (a gift that I have
noticed is claimed by most white men in tropical colonies, and
equally denied by most to others); while they were certain A. and
B. and C. would never be able to keep their places going, because
no boy who knew them would stay with them.</p>

<p>When in doubt about any matter of fact it is an excellent rule
to go and see for yourself. The classical example of Mr. Micawber,
who wanted to embark in the Medway coal trade, and therefore made
it a point to go and sec the Medway, offered an excellent example.
I heard that the small steamer <i>Kia Ora</i> had been chartered by
the Government to go up the Purari River and visit some of the
little-known delta villages. The Purari delta is expected by all
who know the country to be one of the most important, if not the
most important, sources of supply in the future. It therefore
became my clear duty to "go and see the Medway"&mdash;so I
went.</p>

<p>The visit of the <i>Kia Ora</i> was certainly a happy chance.
The Government steam-yacht <i>Merrie England</i> is too deep of
draught to go up the rivers, and, in consequence, Government visits
to the Purari had been few. On this occasion His Excellency the
Lieutenant-Governor was anxious to visit as much as possible of the
delta, and so the small steamer, which only drew about seven feet,
and was not more than eighty tons register, was to take the place
of the official yacht. I was fortunate enough to be invited to join
the Government party, and accepted very readily, as the west is
still largely unbroken and little explored, and not at all the sort
of place where an ordinary traveller could go about unescorted.</p>

<p>We travelled from Port Moresby in the <i>Merrie England,</i> and
transferred to the <i>Kia Ora</i> off the mouth of the Purari. The
distance was not so small as it looked, and it took two days'
steaming to bring us into the gulf and up to the mouth of the
river.</p>

<p>The Purari was only discovered in 1879. Before that date, so
little was known of Western Papua that it seems to have been
possible to overlook a river as big as the Mississippi, and not
even suspect it was somewhere in the neighbourhood. At the present
date (June, 1909), the river still remains in great part unknown.
Messrs. Mackay and Little, in the end of 1908, ascended it over one
hundred miles further than Sir William McGregor had done in 1893,
reaching a point where it divided into two main streams, about two
hundred and seventy miles from the mouth. The river evidently
extends for a great distance further back, but at the spot where
the explorers halted it runs through a high, narrow, rocky gorge,
and becomes impassable on account of the rapids thus created.</p>

<p>At the time of our visit, early in 1908, only one hundred and
forty miles of the river were known, and the delta was practically
not known at all. Two Government visits have since been paid to it,
adding on each occasion something to the still very imperfect
knowledge of the delta. It is about five hundred square miles in
extent; the number of waterways can only be guessed at, and the
population is very much a matter of guesswork also, as no one knows
how many towns may lie concealed in the inner mazes of the great
labyrinth of rivers.</p>

<p>The trip began unluckily. Steam launches had been up the river,
but no one had ever tried to take a seventy-ton steamer in, and no
one, in consequence, knew whether the <i>Kia Ora</i> could get over
the bar or not. We reached the river mouth when the tide was nearly
low, and boldly made the attempt. It failed.</p>

<p>The steamer, though drawing less than nine feet of water, stuck
fast, and it became evident that we had at least got to spend the
day where we were.</p>

<p>There is not perhaps in the whole world a more melancholy and
depressing piece of scenery than the mouth of the Purari River on a
dull, sunless, glaring day in the hot season. For miles and miles
about the low dark green line of coast the sea is insipidly fresh
and hideously yellow, with the tremendous outpour of river water.
Steamers can fill their boilers with the water to a depth of
several feet below the surface, and if no other drink were
available, the Purari water, as it overlies the surface of the sea
a mile or two out, would probably support human life. It is thick
to look at; there is no transparency in the livid flood, and every
ray of light is cast back into the sky as from a brazen mirror. The
resulting glare is something indescribable. Hats, awnings,
umbrellas, are of no use at all, for one lies between two surfaces,
each almost as light as the other. One cannot take refuge in the
cabins; they are appallingly hot. The thermometer in the
wheelhouse, which is comparatively a cool place, stands at
something over a hundred. The shore is far away, and there is no
coolness or shade in its low, dark-coloured flats. From the unseen
river mouth huge dusky trunks and branches of trees come sweeping
past the ship on their way out to sea, and, simultaneously,
terrific shocks pass through her small steel hull and shake the
simmering brains of her luckless passengers to jelly.</p>

<p>"How those logs are knocking her about," says one wretched
creature, lifting a languid head from a lounge that seems to float
between two furnaces, but that is, at least, a degree cooler than
the cabins. Everyone is more or less seasick with the hideous
rolling and kicking of the helpless ship, so there is an
appreciable pause before another unhappy being answers&mdash;</p>

<p>"That isn't the trees&mdash;it's the <i>Kia Ora</i> banging on
the bottom!"</p>

<p>So it is, and so she does for all the rest of that endless
morning. If a tree or two does strike her, no one could tell, until
the rising tide begins to lift her from the bottom, and the hanging
and pitching ceased. In another hour or two we float off again, and
now we are fairly started up the Purari, for here lies the opening
of the river&mdash;one of the openings, that is&mdash;and the banks
are beginning to narrow in at last.</p>

<p>In the life of the traveller&mdash;perhaps one of the happiest
lives that Providence grants to man or woman&mdash;there are
moments of pure delight that stand out through all the years, as
mountain islands stand out from shining tropic seas. The first
sight of a foreign town&mdash;the first day on a great ocean
liner&mdash;the first morning in the tropics&mdash;can the gipsy
whom the Red Gods call, and have called through life, ever forget
the rare fragrance of those perfect moments? The Red Gods are hard
masters. They ask much, if they give much, and when they offer the
"kingdoms of the earth, and the glory of them," they demand the
full price asked of old worship, unmingled and complete. Nor life,
nor death, nor love itself can stand before the power of the Red
Gods of wandering when they call. Let a thousand and ten thousand
gipsy hearts, scattered over "all the seas of all the world," make
answer.</p>

<p>Yet they pay their wages. It is worth having lived to see some
things that most men die without seeing. And a great tropic river
is not among the least of these.</p>

<p>It is hard to say why the Purari, as one enters the lower
reaches of the main channel, to forge slowly upwards against the
tearing current, through a fever-smitten solitude, that is deathly
in more senses than one, should be such a wonderful sight. An
immense tea-coloured flood, fully half a mile wide, dotted with
downward-skimming logs, on which the tall white cranes perch
fearlessly&mdash;shut in by low swampy banks, closely set with
dense jungly growth, bordered by stretch after stretch, acre after
acre of the melancholy, drooping, lovely nipa palm, which stands
with its root in the water and the mud, lifting a splendid crown of
tall green plumes to the heavy heat-brooding sky&mdash;this is what
one sees&mdash;no more. If there are strange birds in the untrodden
miles of swamp land, they are shy of our little steamer and its
beating screw, and do not leave their safe retreats. If there are
alligators&mdash;indeed, we know there are thousands&mdash;in the
depths of that opaque, swift flood, that keeps its secrets so
well&mdash;they never lift a snout or a paw as we pass by. Only the
cockatoos, screaming as nothing but a cockatoo can scream, rise
from the palms near the bank and rush far away inland, yelling
wrath and indignation unspeakable.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, the inner&mdash;rather than the outer
eye&mdash;that sees the wonder of the place. These great rivers of
the burning tropic world have a personality of their own&mdash;a
personality that is strong, malign, treacherous; a force arrayed
against the traveller, challenging him to pit his strength and his
cunning against theirs, with death, in a hundred ugly forms, as the
penalty of loss. More, there is, in some fashion hard to explain,
but easy to feel, something of the spirit of every great river in
every other. It is not only the Purari, second largest of the many
huge unexplored rivers on the strange island-continent, that we are
going up. It is the Congo, the mighty Amazon, the guarded, remote
White Nile&mdash;all the long, mysterious rivers that in every age
of the world have called to the spirit of adventure and the love of
things unknown, lying deep in the heart of man. The name and the
place may be different, but the soul is the same.</p>

<p>The afternoon wore on, and we slipped steadily up the river
against the strong current, forced to keep in the middle by the
smallness of our knowledge as to its depth. The great yellow flood
was over half a mile wide, in places fully ten miles inland. Here
and there tall melancholy pandanus trees stood black and weird
against the livid sky, and at rare intervals a few cocoanut palms
lifted their plumy heads eighty feet above the water.</p>

<p>"Shows we're getting near a village," commented our captain.
"There are never any cocoanuts, unless where the people have
planted them."</p>

<p>The words were scarcely out of his mouth when a loud yell tore
the murky air, and round a bend of the river rushed three large
canoes, each containing about twenty men, paddling at a rate of
speed that was simply amazing. The men wore no clothes, but their
taste in ornament was certainly striking. Every one of them had a
magnificent feather headdress, worn like a halo, and made of
paradise-bird tails, cassowary feathers, parrot feathers&mdash;all
vividly coloured by nature in scarlet, pink, blue, green, orange,
and snowy white. Necklaces of dogs' teeth adorned most of these
warriors, and armlets of white shell, bands of scarlet leaves and
green or white grasses, strings and strips of many-coloured bark,
added to the general effect of full dress. The natural expression
of these river gentry was wild and fierce enough, but they had
further emphasised it, to the best of their ability, by painting
nose, forehead, and cheeks in crimson stripes, and sticking a sort
of white pencil or shell, with pointed ends, through the septum of
the nose, so that the ornament projected on each side, and gave the
wearer a singular resemblance to a tusked wild boar.</p>

<p>There were some spears in the boats; there may have been arrows
also, but no firearms, which, happily for the white resident, the
Papuan does not possess.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust14" id="illust14"></a><img src=
"1501051h-images/TNNG-14.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=

</p>

<p>Both then, and afterwards, I was much struck with the speed and
skill of the Purari River paddlers. Their canoes are simply a large
hollowed log, without any supporting outrigger, and a white man
cannot keep his balance in one for a second, so insecure is its
hold on the water. The natives, however, paddle them, standing up
in the canoe, at a rate that would leave many a racing outrigger
far behind. Their time is magnificent, and the sweep of the
paddles, plunging in and out, and making the water fairly boil
along the sides of the long light log, is a thing to remember for
the rest of one's life.</p>

<p>The men in the canoes&mdash;sixty or thereabouts&mdash;greeted
our appearance with yells of the wildest excitement, and at once
began paddling their hardest to overtake the steamer&mdash;which,
working against the fierce current right in the middle of the
stream, they did in a few minutes. No steamer had ever been up here
before, and very few boats; the men hardly knew what our arrival
might portend, and certainly did not understand the significance of
the Union Jack flying at our masthead, to indicate His Excellency's
presence on board. However, it was clear that they had no fears,
for they did their best to catch up the ship, and having succeeded
in doing so, took a tow with the utmost enjoyment. Thus we went on
our way, accompanied by the yelling crowd of painted cannibals,
into Maipua, the first of the villages we meant to visit.</p>

<p>Even in Papua, the country of impossibilities, the sight of
Maipua comes with a shock of amazement. The huge rabis&mdash;or
men's living-houses and devil-temples in one, that stand out in
inescapable prominence along both sides of the stream, perplex the
mind with a mist of nightmare bewilderment. It is a curiously
disturbing thing to come upon something so unlike every other
object of its kind, that your mind has no simile to offer, no past
experience upon which the new sensation may stand. The largest rabi
in Maipua is fully ninety feet in height and four hundred in
length. Its shape cannot be described otherwise than by suggesting
that the idea may originally have come from the form of an
alligator lying full length and open jawed on the bank. The gable
end, facing the river, runs up into an immense horn or point, the
sides being rounded off in a sweep that shows considerable
architectural skill. A small door gives access to the interior. In
front of every rabi there is the usual Papuan verandah, built high
up on posts, to protect the inhabitants of the house from wandering
alligators.</p>

<p>Smaller houses, all built in the same style, stood along the
bank, each house perched high on piles out of the swampy mud. The
Maipuan lives in mud almost as much as an alligator, but he does
not care to sleep in it. Logs of wood lie about the swampiest
places, where the youth of the community might be in danger of
disappearing altogether, and the innumerable small creeks and
inlets that seam the villages through and through have generally a
crossway log, a moored canoe, or even a light, neat, well-made
bridge to convey the native from one side to the other. As every
Papuan of the coast districts can swim like a shark, the precaution
is a significant one. Indeed, although we did not chance to see
any, there is no doubt that these swampy places swarm with
alligators. The piles of alligator skulls kept as trophies in the
rabis would prove this if nothing else did.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it is evident, natives do brave the dangers of the
river so far as to swim down it with the current, taking their
chance of an encounter with the great grey monsters that lurk
hidden in the slime. A Papuan did this some months before the time
of our visit. He belonged to a tribe living some distance away, and
when the people of Maipua saw his black, frizzy head making its way
down the river they went out in their canoes to see who it might
he. Finding he was a stranger, they picked him out of the river,
and promptly ate him to teach him not to come trespassing in their
waters.</p>

<p>A stroke of bad luck had knocked me over with temporary
sickness, and I was not able to go ashore with the rest of the
small party when we anchored in Maipua and the captain proceeded
forth to do his recruiting. Lying on a lounge on deck, not a little
feverish and with the mind in the tense, overstrung state that a
high temperature brings, I watched the strange sights about me and
wondered whether it could possibly be real. The sky was still a
sulky purple grey, the river gleamed like tarnished brass against a
lowering sunset, the gigantic rabis stood up black and threatening.
The party from the steamer could be seen ashore standing on the
verandah of one of the houses and holding negotiations that seemed
likely to last a long time with a group of feathered and painted
Maipuans. In the stillness of the almost deserted ship one could
hear from far away the deep, resounding boom of a native
chant&mdash;a chant with something distinctly warlike in its tone:
no cheerful song about the river or the fishing or the gardens,
such as natives used to while away their idle hours all over the
Pacific lands, but a loud, long yell, broken at regular intervals,
coming nearer and nearer to the ship, and sounding stranger and
fiercer as it approached. At last it came under the bows, and with
it passed by a sight worth going many hundred miles to see.</p>

<p>Two great canoes had been lashed together and connected by a
platform of canes and small timber. They were decorated with a
perfect forest of fresh green palm leaves and other foliage, so
that the whole structure looked like a floating garden drifting
down the stream. On the canoes stood a score or two of natives,
gorgeously painted and feathered, but otherwise absolutely unclad.
Their feather headdresses quivered against the gloomy sky; their
fierce dark faces, streaked with scarlet and tusked with the
nose-shell, looked half beast-like, half devil-like as they
chanted, open-mouthed and swaying, their loud, monotonous song. In
the centre of the platform lay a trophy of some kind, so much
decorated with leaves and grasses that it was impossible to say
what it might be. I heard later that it was a newly-slaughtered
pig, and saw no reason to doubt the fact; but it was clear, all the
same, that pig was not invariably the centre of the ceremony.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust15" id="illust15"></a><img src=
"1501051h-images/TNNG-15.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=
"Illustration">
</p>

<p>In fact, I looked at the raft with peculiar interest, since it
seemed very probable indeed, from the elaboration of the whole
affair and the warlike demeanour of the men, that I was witnessing
a cannibal ceremony minus the corpse. Natives have a way of
substituting pig for man, much as an economical housewife would
substitute margarine for butter on occasions when the superior
article would prove too expensive. It certainly would have proved
very expensive for the Maipuans in this instance, and they
doubtless knew the fact.</p>

<p>The people on the occasion of this visit were sullen and not
inclined to be civil. Maipua, being low down in the delta, had been
seen by a few white men, traders, and recruiters, but it was not
very well disposed towards them. White visitors interfere with the
simple sports of a native village (such as tying up a captured
enemy over a fire and roasting him alive) and get in the way of
tribal warfare; and Maipua at this time was scarcely awake to the
fact that the white man possessed many things it was extremely
desirable to have. The people were not actively rude, but they
followed our party about in silence, watching them closely with
sullen stares, and kept the women out of sight&mdash;always a sign
of hostility.</p>

<p>The captain of the steamer nevertheless was bent on recruiting
some of the unmarried men for the eastern plantations, and laboured
to that end with the utmost industry. He used to go into one of the
large houses inhabited by young men and sit down for a smoke. By
and by, through his interpreter, he would ask one of the men if he
had any tobacco. The man would acknowledge rather shamefacedly that
he was out of that essential. "Poor fellow!" the captain would say,
"I'll give you some," and hand him over a few sticks. Then he
remarked casually that the boys who worked on the plantations had
an allowance of so many sticks a week. By and by he began again.
"Got a tomahawk?" No, the man explained, there were only half a
dozen in the town, and they were very valuable things indeed; he
did not hope to possess one. "Got a calico?" (waist-cloth). No, the
man hadn't that; he had only a garment of bark. By this time he was
beginning to feel very low in his mind; but the relentless captain
went on. "Got fish-hook?" No, the man did not own such a treasure,
invaluable though it was to a river native. Then would come the
crucial question, "Got a wife?" The Maipuan would nearly shed tears
at this. How could a man without so much as a scrap of calico of
his own afford to buy a wife?</p>

<p>"I tell you what," the captain would say, struck by a new and
brilliant idea, "you come away with me and go to work for a year on
the white men's plantations. You plant cocoanut, you cut down tree,
all the same as you do here. You get plenty-plenty tucker, meat all
the days, biscuit, rice, tea, plenty tobacco. By and by you go back
Maipua, you take calico, fish-hooks, tomahawks, beads, knives; you
big man; you buy wife."</p>

<p>Money was not mentioned, as the Maipuan scarcely understands the
value of coin, and prefers to think in concrete terms. The prospect
proved attractive to a good many, and there was some animated
talking among the young men. "How many moons till we get the
goods?" was the next question. The captain had conic prepared with
a knotted string, which he produced. It had twelve knots, and each,
he explained, represented a moon.</p>

<p>The matter stayed there till the next day, as we meant to stop
overnight. Till morning we lay in mid-stream, separated by only a
narrow channel of water from two thousand covetous and bloodthirsty
savages, who valued the trade goods stored in our hold much as the
crew of one of Drake's caravels would have valued the contents of a
Spanish treasure ship on its way home from Eldorado&mdash;and who
certainly would not have had the slightest scruple in spearing and
eating every one of our little party of ten or eleven whites if
they had only known that we were practically unarmed, and that the
mysterious smoke-breathing monster which had brought us to their
town was no more to be feared than a whaleboat. But they did not
know; therein lay our safety.</p>

<p>Next morning the captain went ashore again with the rest of the
whites. I was obliged to stay on board, being still on the
sick-list. Lying on my lounge on deck, the ship very still, with
only one or two of the crew left in charge, I took a photograph or
two, and watched the canoes passing timorously up and down beside
the steamer. They were not angels, these Purari folk, and they did
not look angelic. None too lovely to begin with; by the time they
had painted and feathered themselves, thrust the hideous white tusk
through their noses, and filled their mouths with chewed betel-nut,
that looked exactly like blood, staining lips and teeth a hideous
crimson, they were as devilish-looking a set of gentry as you might
find in a year's wanderings.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust16" id="illust16"></a><img src=
"1501051h-images/TNNG-16.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=
"Illustration">
</p>

<p>The captain came on board later in the day with a score or two
of Maipuans, half-scared, half-excited, but quite determined to go
with the white men and earn the goods that were to make them so
important in their village. Not one of these untamed savages but
would have to be "signed on" by a magistrate, according to the laws
of the country, before he could be set to work. It sounded a little
absurd, but all the regulations of the Native Labour Ordinance have
been framed with the view of preventing injustice between employer
and employé, and they are all based upon good reasons. The
plantation hand in Papua knows before he signs his agreement just
what he is doing, how long his engagement is to last (it cannot in
any case be more than three years), what wages he is to get, and
how and when he will reach his home again. The employer is obliged
to feed him on a liberal scale, give him blanket, mosquito net,
tinware for his food, and a proper house to sleep in. No employer
or overseer is allowed to strike a boy in punishment of any neglect
of duty&mdash;nor on any other occasion, unless in self-defence.
Punishment on a plantation means deprivation of some luxury, a
little extra work, or (if the labourer leaves before the end of his
engagement) a compulsory visit to a magistrate, who will look into
the matter, and if he is satisfied that there has been no just
cause of complaint on the boy's part, will sentence him to a short
term of imprisonment in jail.</p>

<p>Wages are usually ten shillings a month, and are paid at the end
of the engagement. They must be handed to the labourer in the
presence of a magistrate, and a minor official has to satisfy the
magistrate and himself that the local store does not cheat the boy
of any value for his money. In the Government offices are to be
found huge piles of papers dealing with the purchases made by
hundreds of boys at a time when being paid off. So many fish-hooks,
so many strings of beads, so many tomahawks and knives, so many
yards of calico, etc. etc.&mdash;even, in some cases, so many bars
of soap! The Papuan is usually much impressed with the wonderful
powers of soap when he sees it for the first time, and is quite
anxious to introduce it to the ignorant people who have remained at
home in the village.</p>

<p>At the end of his engagement the employer has to return every
man to his own home, even if it is four or five hundred miles away.
This is undertaken at so much per head by the recruiting schooners,
and is not a serious expense. If by any chance the native should
have died during his engagement, the employer is obliged by law to
send the amount of his wages, in cash or goods, to the man's
relations in his native village.</p>

<p>A man who has once been on the plantations generally goes back
again, sooner or later. He may be glad to see his own people for a
while, and to sink down into the ways of savagery for a certain
time. But the leaven of civilisation works. He has learned to want
many things that he cannot have in his own cannibal village; he has
acquired a taste for good and regular food and undisturbed
sleep&mdash;two blessings that are not to be found in native
villages&mdash;and he grows impatient with the tiresome stone axes
and adzes, the tedious fish-spearing, the bamboo knives that will
only make one cut before they have to be re-edged. After handling
European tools for a year or more it is disconcerting to be dropped
back into the Stone Age. And when you are accustomed to all the
glories of red calico tunics, leather belts, and shirts to wear
when the sea-breeze blows wet and chilly, it is hard to go back to
scraps of bark and tufts of leaves. The goods brought from the
plantation are shared out all over the district, and do not last
long. The labourer finds himself much where he was before
long&mdash;only discontented, which he never used to be...By and by
the recruiter comes along again, and the first boy he gets is the
very one who was so glad to get home a few months ago.</p>

<p>One might reasonably ask, Is there no risk to the planter in
filling up his plantation with ferocious man-eaters miles and days
away from the nearest white settlement?...I have said before that
Papua is the country of the Impossible. This is another of its
impossibilities. It is perfectly safe, as all experience proves.
The Papuan cannibal, taken away from his own village, set to work
in a district of which he knows nothing, among men who are largely
strangers to him, seems to change his nature altogether for the
time being. There are occasional fights among the plantation hands
themselves, but nothing serious as a rule. Attacks on the white
masters are practically unknown. It is hard to say why this is the
case, while in the neighbouring Solomon Islands and in the New
Hebrides the planter often runs serious risk from his men, but the
fact is one that cannot be denied. Something is probably due to the
excellent treatment of the labourer which the law enforces in the
one case and merely assumes in the other, but this hardly accounts
in full for the extraordinary fact that one white man can live
alone among five hundred natives, mostly cannibal, order them
about, keep them hard at work, let them see that he is in
possession of countless stores of the very treasures for which they
are painfully labouring, and yet remain perfectly safe in their
midst. The prestige of the Government and the fear of its
displeasure are both alike strong in Papua, but that again is
scarcely enough to account for the astonishing tameness of the
man-eater away from his home. He is not tame in his home, and not
friendly to the white either; until within the last two years it
was almost impossible for any white man to venture into the western
river districts except at the imminent risk of his life; and yet,
at that very time, men who came from the hostile country made
excellent workers. One must be content to "give it up," as one
gives up many problems in this country of living riddles.</p>

<p>The men we took on board at Maipua and later amounted to over a
hundred. The little ship was packed to overflowing with them. They
might have risen any night and massacred the whole of the whites
and looted the ship, but they did not, and we knew that they would
not. I do not know why we knew. They might conceivably have
attacked us on shore, when we should have been still more at their
mercy&mdash;again, I do not know why. The amount of ignorance that
I accumulated on that journey through the delta would fill three
volumes, and I never ran out of it all the time I remained in the
country afterwards.</p>

</p>

<p>Next day we got away from Maipua. I had not seen anything on
shore, not even the interior of one of the great rabis, but another
visit, paid a year later, made up for the deprivation. On this
occasion I went ashore with the Government party, who had come up
from the <i>Merrie England</i> in a steam-launch, and saw the
principal rabis. The change that had taken place during the course
of the year was very notable. Instead of sulking sullenly apart and
watching us with suspicion, the Maipuans rushed to meet the launch,
helped us by the muddy river bank, seized any parcels we were
carrying, insisted on relieving us of their weight, and shook hands
with us by the score. When I broke through a rickety bridge and got
covered with mud half a dozen man-eaters "ran to help me when I
fell," pulled me out on to the dry land (what there was of it) and
painstakingly cleaned my skirt with grass and water. The village
was really transformed. Though still uncivilised in other ways, we
heard that they had definitely given up cannibalism, and that they
were rapidly learning the use of white men's tools. They made no
objection to letting anyone enter the rabis, and, as I was most
anxious to see one, I followed with the Government party along the
river bank to the platform of one of the largest.</p>

<p>Walking about in a Purari delta village is not an easy
performance. The whole town is built in the mud&mdash;black, thick,
ill-smelling slime, half land and half water, cut up by numberless
canals and streams of all sizes. The houses, made of bark and
sticks, are set upon high piles, and connected with each other by
fallen logs laid across the worst of the quagmires, and by a
nightmare kind of bridge constructed of fragile sticks, which are
placed in careless handfuls upon tall, trembling supports eight or
nine feet high. These structures have no handrail or guard of any
kind, and if you fall off one when nobody is about you may very
well be suffocated in the slime below. It is said&mdash;with how
much truth I cannot tell&mdash;that many of the natives of the
Purari delta can support themselves safely in this slime by a kind
of half-swimming, half-paddling motion, and can even get about in
it, like mud-turtles. We did not see anyone performing the feat;
but no doubt the native prefers a bridge when it is to be had.</p>

<p>The outside platform of the rabi was very wide and very rickety
indeed, and you could plainly see the black, deep mud below through
the gaps between the twigs. Our booted and heavily-moving party
(all white people seem to move heavily and slowly compared to the
light-footed, naked natives) came very near breaking through once
or twice, but we got safely to the entrance of the rabi and
entered, one at least of the party full of excitement and
anticipation.</p>

<p>Very little indeed has been known about these rabis in the past,
and even on the occasion of our second visit we were sure that not
twenty white men had seen before us what we were seeing that day.
No white woman had ever been inside the rabis, but there seemed to
be no objection to my entering.</p>

<p>Coming out of the dull glare and heat outside, the dark coolness
of the rabi made one draw a breath of relief. There is no heat in
Papua like the black heat of the delta country&mdash;glaring yet
gloomy sky; inky mud, warm as a witch's cauldron; palms and lianas
bright with an unwholesomely vivid green, void of
refreshment&mdash;it seems as if there were not a single spot upon
which the eye could rest without strain. Under the huge arching
roof of the rabi, however, there was a pleasant dark-brown light,
and something like a breath of wind seemed to filter through the
long arcade in front of us as we stood in the outermost division
looking at the strange treasure of the Maipuans.</p>

<p>The photograph which I was fortunate enough to obtain on this
occasion will give some idea of the extraordinary appearance of the
building. It was partitioned off into four separate sanctuaries,
the three first being divided from each other by rows of wooden
pillars. The outermost was the largest and highest; as the building
went back it became narrower and lower, and each division lessened
accordingly.</p>

<p>The first contained alligator skulls set in neat rows on the
ground; pigs' jaws hung in strings down the pillars; wooden shields
carved into representations of nightmare faces&mdash;faces
crab-like, pig-like, devilish, bogy, goblin, comic, or fierce. The
gargoyles of Notre Dame would seem banal compared with the
imagination of the Purari artist. I never saw anything like it,
except in some of Aubrey Beardsley's drawings. Indeed, an artist of
the decadent type would find himself thoroughly in sympathy with
the Purari country in general. It is very much like the sort of
thing an unusually morbid impressionist painter would create after
a course of reading selected from Poe, De Quincey, and the once
notorious <i>Yellow Book.</i></p>

<p>Besides the shields there were a few spears&mdash;wood, with
long barbed points&mdash;and a number of belts made of bark; also
some plaited baskets, evidently the property of the men who were
lounging about on the floor of the first division. We knew that
strings of human skulls generally decorated the posts of the rabi,
as they had been seen on the occasion of the former visit; but the
Maipuans had evidently removed them when they heard the
steam-launch coming, out of a well-bred reluctance to shock our
feelings. Between the two visits there had been a punitive
expedition into the delta to warn another tribe against chasing
white men and threatening to eat them, and the manners of the
various towns had undergone a wonderful improvement since then,
although no one had been killed in punishment for the outrage. The
Maipuan people, at all events, fully recognised the power of the
Government, and were almost effusively anxious to curry favour with
its representatives.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust18" id="illust18"></a><img src=
"1501051h-images/TNNG-18.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=

</p>

<p>The second division of the rabi contained much the same things
as the first, and so did the third, but in each division the
treasures were larger and better selected&mdash;the alligator
skulls bigger, the pig jaws more numerous, the shields and weapons
handsomer. The fourth division we could not see into, as it was
shut off by long drooping curtains of fine fibre; but we approached
it with extreme interest and curiosity. The whole rabi seemed
designed with a view of gradually leading up to and enhancing
something...what?</p>

<p>We dived through the curtains, and saw.</p>

<p>We were standing in a little innermost room at the very end of
the immense length and height of the rabi. Here the roof sloped
down low, and the sun came in through the slats of the branchwork
at the back. We could see the contents of the room quite clearly,
and they were...</p>

<p>Four dragons!</p>

<p>Yes, it was certainly worth the elaborate preparation that led
up to the surprise. Whatever one might guess as to the contents of
that inner shrine&mdash;that Unholy of Unholies&mdash;one was not
likely to have guessed dragons. And yet there they were, as large
as life, and quite as unnatural as anything ever seen in the
pictures of a tale-book about goblins and genii. They had a certain
resemblance to alligators, a slight suggestion of shark; but
dragons they were in all essentials. They were made of plaited
wickerwork, and seemed about nine feet long. They had tapering
tails and small sprawling feet. They had large red eyes, made of
the rind of some fruit, and immense gaping mouths which could
easily have engulfed a man. All in all, they were bogies of a very
high class, and evidently held in awe as such, for only one man
entered into the inner shrine with the whites to look upon them,
and he had apparently an official connection of some kind with the
mysteries of the rabi.</p>

<p>It is extremely difficult to get at the meaning or use of these
images, as the natives are very shy of talking about them, and take
refuge in obvious lies if too closely questioned. This much is
known, that they are in use as oracles, being consulted before the
natives go out to hunt. The Governor questioned our guide through
an interpreter, and was told that the Ukiaravi tribe had consulted
their images before going out to chase the white man some months
before, and that the images told them they would have bad luck, but
they had gone all the same. They themselves had always consulted
these figures before going out to hunt wild pig, in order to know
what success they would have. Of course they never hunted anything
but pig; it was only the bad people of Ukiaravi who hunted men
(self-righteously).</p>

<p>How did the images answer?</p>

<p>By tilting on their feet&mdash;so many raps for yes, so many for
no, the guide informed us.</p>

<p>(Spirit-rapping of the good old pattern among the Purari
cannibals!&mdash;<i>si je m'y attendais!</i>)</p>

<p>He told us further that when the men came home from hunting with
a load of pig they brought out the images on the platform in front
of the rabi and offered the pig to them. That
"excellent-substitute-for-the-real-article" idea occurred to me
again. The Purari mind is transparent enough at some times, though
at others dense and dark as the mud of the swamps that breed
it.</p>

<p>We had heard dim rumours of other uses for the
images&mdash;ceremonies in which a man, hidden inside the wicker
body, feigned to devour the victim of a cannibal feast, stabbing
him as he was put into the mouth of the figure. But questions about
cannibal ceremonies may as well be left unasked, for it is
impossible to get replies. All cannibals are shy and secretive
about their anthropophagic practices, and take refuge from inquiry
in blank innocence or the inevitable pig. The figures were
evidently designed to hold a man, but when or for what purpose we
could only guess.</p>

<p>A good deal impressed, we left the inner chamber and began the
long walk back up the rabi to the platform. The floor was made of
split palm sheaths, or something similar, and was very elastic, and
not at all secure. The walls, however, were well built of small
parallel branches and split logs, and the roof was sloped and
narrowed with notable skill. Altogether the rabi was fully as
remarkable inside as out, and that was saying much.</p>

<p>The life of a Purari village centres round the rabi, which seems
to be used partly as a club, partly as a devil-temple. The
unmarried men all sleep in it, and spend much of their time in it.
All the men of the town join in the ceremonies that take place
there from time to time, but what these are no white man knows. Few
whites have visited the district, and none have had an opportunity
of unravelling the secrets of the rabi. The natives guard its
privacy most jealously; Maipua is the only town where strangers
have been willingly admitted into the interior of the building and
shown the images, and even in Maipua the ceremonial side of the
temples is kept rigidly secret. In Ukiaravi a rabi was destroyed by
the Government to punish the natives for attempting an attack upon
two harmless white traders, and the images were confiscated. I was
therefore able to secure a photograph of two of these figures,
taken at Port Moresby. They are quite unique as curios, since no
other specimens have ever been obtained, and none could he obtained
unless under similar circumstances. No village would sell its
images for any money that could be offered.</p>

<p>In other parts of the Gulf of Papua there are buildings somewhat
resembling these rabis, though less remarkable. The Resident
Magistrates say that the rabi, in the coast towns, is really a sort
of savage university, where the boys of the tribe are brought up,
taught the use of weapons, and initiated into the ceremonies of the
tribe by the old men. They spend several years undergoing this
educational course. A man who has not undergone the rabi training
is held of small account by his fellows and finds difficulty in
getting a wife. It is a curious point that children of illegitimate
parentage are not admitted.</p>

<p>In all probability the Purari River rabi has much in common with
these. The fiercer nature of the people, however, no doubt
introduces more of the murderous and man-eating clement into the
ceremonies of the rabi than obtains along the open and better known
districts of the coast.</p>

<p>We steamed away from Maipua on the occasion of our first visit
with a large number of untamed savages, and made our way to
Kairu&mdash;or tried to.</p>

<p>But in the Purari delta man proposes and the river channels do
the disposing. Nobody really knows this marvellous tangle of great
rivers, narrow deep channels, broad shallow creeks, sago swamps,
and mangrove and nipa country, half land, half water. The chart is
a mockery when you really want to find your way about. It is the
most amazing piece of geography in the world. Your steamer butts
her way solidly up against the current of a river the size of the
Mississippi for half a dozen miles, takes a crosscut down a creek
at right angles to her former course, and plunges out into another
river about the size of the Upper Nile this time, running parallel
to the last, and not a hundred yards from it. This is not the
direction for our villages, however, so we take another crosscut
and strike yet another great river nearly a quarter of a mile wide
and four or five fathoms deep. It branches off by and by into two
large rivers, each big and deep enough to make the fortune of an
Australian State. We choose a branch at random and proceed along it
for the greater part of the day, the Papuan leadsman throwing the
lead constantly as we go and calling out the depth, which is rather
too variable to be safe. What a river! An unknown and unnamed
branch of the great Purari, but yet a mighty flood, bearing along
huge logs like straws, taking our 80-ton steamer in perfect safety,
and showing here and there a depth of as much as seven fathoms. A
wonderful but a melancholy place; a land where no man lives, where
it seems that no man has come since the beginning of the world.
Thirty, forty, fifty miles we must have gone, and nothing stirs on
those green burning banks but the stalking crane, no sound but the
harsh cry of the cockatoo breaks the deathly stillness of the
dense, swamp-nourished bush. All the criminals of all the world
might hide here and never fear discovery&mdash;an invading army
might lose or conceal itself and never have its presence so much as
suspected. Yet if the place is desolate, it is not barren. The
endless groves of nipa palm bear eatable if not attractive fruits,
and the sago palm lines the banks with veritable forests, each
trunk a storehouse of food for a family during almost a year. Even
the great population of the delta&mdash;a population which has
never been more than guessed at because of the careful concealment
of most village sites&mdash;cannot use one tithe of the supply of
this most valuable food. No one who has seen the river
people&mdash;stout, muscular, well nourished, and fed from babyhood
almost entirely on the starchy food washed from the inner pith of
the sago palm&mdash;can doubt its value as a food.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust19" id="illust19"></a><img src=
"1501051h-images/TNNG-19.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=
"Illustration">
</p>

<p>Why has no attempt been made to use these forests of sago
commercially? Difficulty of transport is the chief reason. They are
"a long way from anywhere," and white men could not live in the
deadly swamps where the tree most flourishes. A good deal might be
done by cutting along the outer edge of the bank, but, with so many
other industries waiting to be exploited, the turn of the sago palm
is not likely to come for a long day yet. Sago, prepared and
cleaned, can be bought in large rolls in many parts of Papua at
about a halfpenny a pound. It is not at all like the sago of the
shops, either in appearance or flavour, being dark reddish-brown in
colour and of a glutinous, jelly-like substance. Its nourishing
qualities, however, for the old, the sick, and children are
unrivalled.</p>

<p>We found Kairu, I do not know how, and I am sure the captain did
not know how himself. It was certainly worth finding. Though not so
imposing as Maipua, it was far prettier. The houses of Kairu are
built more in the water than in the mud, and overhang the deep
green river in quite a Venetian manner. There were many little side
canals running in and out among the houses, with wickerwork
verandahs looking down upon them and trails of leafy liana netted
across their cool arcades. There were bridges, too, of a better
pattern than the Maipuan type, crossing these narrow
rivers&mdash;in fact, the whole town (a large one, with a
population running into thousands) may fairly be described as the
Venice of the Purari.</p>

<p>It gave one's mind the disconcerting kind of jolt with which one
becomes so familiar in Papua to observe in the middle of this
poetic prettiness of architecture a solemn row of cannibals sitting
on the front verandah of every large house. They were very much
painted and feathered and very little dressed; they were as
immovable as stone, and apparently took no interest at all in the
unheard-of phenomenon of a steamer. We judged them to be sentries
of some kind&mdash;not an unnecessary precaution in this part of
Papua.</p>

<p>Here we got twenty or thirty men, and some bundles of sago, and
in the afternoon proceeded twenty parasangs&mdash;(I beg the
reader's pardon)&mdash;we left Kairu and went a few miles down the
nearest river, and then got lost again, trying up wrong creeks and
rivers that led to nothing. The current in the narrower rivers was
very strong, and in consequence every half-hour or so brought a
warning cry from the helmsman, "Look out!" clearing everybody
immediately off the deck and into the nearest shelter, while the
ship plunged her violent way into the bank, carrying off branches
of trees wholesale and strewing the deck with fragments. After she
had been backed off the passengers would come out again and begin
hunting about for insects, which always came on board in thousands
on these occasions. Ants of every kind were passed over as
uninteresting (would that they had consented to pass us over in
like fashion!); grasshoppers were common; but now and then
something really odd rewarded our search. A praying mantis was one
of the most amusing. It was a brown stick-like creature some three
inches long, with four ordinary legs and two long serrated
forelegs. Every now and then it raised itself upright in a kneeling
posture and held up its forelegs devotionally before its face. This
pious action was always followed by shrieks of laughter from the
travellers. Its head, perched on a long slender neck, was usually
drooped on one side in a manner suggesting extreme weariness of the
world in general, and of its present company in particular. At
times, however, especially when deluded into climbing an endless
ladder of someone's fingers, presented one after the other, it
wakened up to wrath and squared at the offender fiercely,
challenging him to come on. If the challenge passed unnoticed, it
made a fierce leap at his face, and then, without having inflicted
any damage except a severe blow upon itself, it would drop back
into its languid attitude of prayer and seem once more to forget
the world. As a matter of fact, this attitude of prayer is its way
of catching smaller insects, which mistake the immobile creature
for a piece of stick and fly heedlessly against its outstretched
arms.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust20" id="illust20"></a><img src=

</p>

<p>Another insect of a very strange appearance came aboard in
dozens and scores during this part of the journey. Most of us had
an idea that it was new to science (Papua is full of discoveries
for the entomologist, as we all knew), but no one could say for
certain. It was a sort of rough sketch of an insect, from a quarter
to half an inch long, looking like a pinch of pale green cotton
wool oddly fitted out with two black eyes and six legs. It had no
wings, but stalked or skipped according to its mood. On its back
was surely the oddest appendage ever seen on an insect&mdash;a
bird-like tail, fan-shaped and set straight up in the air. The tail
was apparently made of another pinch of cotton-wool, white this
time, and rather carelessly stuck into place. It looked exceedingly
like a minute green peacock with a white tail (four of its legs
being inconspicuous), and the conceit of its aspect and demeanour
as it strutted along the backs of the seats was something
incredible. No one in Port Moresby, we afterwards found, had ever
seen or heard of the curious little beast. We were sorry not to
bring any away, but at the time no good method of killing or
preserving them seemed to suggest itself to anyone.</p>

<p>That night we went aground again, rather seriously, and remained
fast for some hours. We were running in the dusk across a huge dim
lagoon that shone under the fading sky like a shield of tarnished
silver when the disaster occurred, and the banks were too far away
to give us any assistance in getting off. For the time being we
accepted things as they were, remembered that the delta was all
tidal, and trusted to the flood to get us away. Meanwhile we left
the deck, which was veiled with drifting rain, and went down to
dinner.</p>

<p>Later on, the rain having slackened a little, we were all
sitting on lounges with our feet tucked up, talking about murders
and crocodiles, as one does in New Guinea, when somebody remarked
that we were in a very lonely spot. It was a place perfectly
unknown to white men, and it looked as if not even a native had
been there since the creation of the world. There was not a stir on
the whole dim face of the great lagoon, not so much as a fish
leaping under the moonlight; no sound but the pattering of the
desultory rain on the deck. It felt unpleasantly as if the Day of
Judgment had somehow come and gone in the world outside without our
knowledge, leaving us the last of men in a doomed and depopulated
world.</p>

<p>Then, while we were talking and the steward was going round with
the coffee, somebody exclaimed "Look!"</p>

<p>We looked. On the other side of the lagoon, not more than a
furlong or so away, an immense fiery transparency eighty or a
hundred feet high reared itself into the dark, where a moment
before had been nothing but gloom. It was shaped like a pointed
arch, but the lower part was hidden by thick bush, and we could not
see exactly where it rose.</p>

<p>"A rabi, and a big one," said the captain. "There must be a town
quite close."</p>

<p>Not a sound came from the direction of the great temple. The
light burned steadily, dim and red, as though filtered through some
semi-transparent screen. A huge veil of mats as big as the mainsail
of a tea-clipper is sometimes placed over the front of a rabi to
conceal all sight of the ceremonies within from passing eyes. We
guessed that the strange appearance before us was caused in some
such manner. What devilry might be doing behind the screen only
Satan himself could tell, and none of us wished to speculate about
it.</p>

<p>The vision faded as quickly as it had arisen. In an instant, as
we watched it, the light went out and the glowing arch vanished as
though it had never been.</p>

<p>For all that, it did not leave the <i>Kia Ora</i> as it found
her. We were no longer in a primaeval solitude; on the contrary, we
had some thousands of near neighbours about whom no one knew
anything at all, except that they were savages of a pretty bad
kind. Further, we were stuck fast, and could not get away for many
hours. Also, we had no arms to speak of. In addition, we were
loaded with covetable goods. And there was no particular reason to
think that our score or two of recruits would take our side in case
of trouble.</p>

<p>It sounds like an "adventure," but it did not feel like one.
According to all the canons of literature, we should have been
fortifying the ship against attack, posting sentries in the
crow's-nest, looking up our one rifle and two pistols, and
preparing, if necessary, to sell our lives and our beads and
tomahawks as dearly as possible. As a matter of fact, we were
complaining about the quality of the coffee, and wondering if the
rain was going to stop. No one troubled particularly about the rabi
and its inhabitants. Of course, we might have been attacked, but we
did not think it likely, and one cannot afford to trouble about
improbabilities in a place so entirely incalculable as Papua.</p>

<p>Next morning we got away with the sunrise, and proceeded to lose
ourselves as complexly and completely as ever a ship and ship's
company were lost. We steamed for hours and miles and scores of
miles up creeks that led finally to nowhere and had to be backed
out of. We went up big rivers that were not on the map, and
careered along deep waterways where dry land was distinctly
charted. We went round and round and in and out, all the time
seeing not a sign of life or even a cultivated tree. We sat down on
shoals and got warped off with infinite difficulty; we smashed into
the banks with the force of the current at the corners times
without number, and carried away large sections of the surrounding
forest. At last it became perfectly evident that the steamer was
"bushed" (Anglicc, lost in the bush). This was the unexpected
again. In Australia you do not get bushed with a steamer, nor do
you go across country in one; but anything may happen in Papua.</p>

<p>The <i>Kin Ora,</i> under these trying circumstances, behaved as
other things do that have lost their way. She sat down half on,
half off a convenient shoal, and bellowed loudly with her siren. It
had no result whatever. She then got off the bank, pulled herself
together, and made a last effort to strike, at least, the path by
which she had come. In this she was not successful, but she found
something&mdash;the Pacific Ocean&mdash;and immediately trumpeted
her discovery like a pleased elephant. It was now clear that, if we
did not exactly know where we were, we knew where we were not.</p>

<p>A forlorn hope in a boat was then sent out, duly provisioned and
watered, and after the lapse of half a day returned with the
cheering report that the coast mission station lay only a few
points away on the port bow, and had furnished a pilot. With the
guide (a native who knew something, not much&mdash;no one knows
much about the delta) we started back for the river-maze again to
look for another village, and succeeded in finding one&mdash;we
were not at all particular by this time as to what we found or
where we found it. Its name, we learned, was Iai. The people were
an ugly-looking lot, and seemed terrified of the steamer at first,
trembling and crying out when she let off her whistle. By and by,
seeing our people come ashore, they gained confidence, and, keeping
tight hold of their bows and arrows, came in a perfect flotilla of
canoes round the ship, staring, muttering, spitting gory betel-nut,
and all the time keeping an eye on the captain, who was busy
recruiting ashore, followed by about half the men of the village.
The women did not hide themselves, but none of them ventured near
the ship; they kept away by themselves, and did not even stop their
monotonous sago-beating work to look at us. Very few white people
had ever been seen in Iai, but you cannot be curious if you are
miserable, and no one who looked at the degraded, brutalised,
smileless faces of these poor women could have doubted the fact
that they were utterly wretched. They were a shade lower than
anything we had yet seen in the delta or elsewhere. They had not
even the grass petticoats worn in other districts; save for a small
strip of bark, they were naked. Some of them wore the white tusk
thrust through the nose, which we had noticed in the men of the
river tribes, but not in the women. It looked, if possible, even
more repulsive on a woman's face than a man's.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust21" id="illust21"></a><img src=
"1501051h-images/TNNG-21.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=
"Illustration">
</p>

<p>The sago-beating in which they were employed takes up most of a
woman's time in the delta country. The men fell and bring in the
palms, and there their task stops. With crude stone adzes the women
hollow out the trunk, loosening the pith, and collecting it in the
hollow of the gutted tree. They then pour water into the trunk and
wash out the starchy matter of which the pith is full, letting the
latter fall on the ground. The starch or sago is dried in the sun
and tied up in bundles, which are neatly packed in leaves. The work
is slow and tedious. On the recent Mackay exploring expedition the
carriers made sago for the food of the party, and it was found that
they could not make more than two days' supply in a whole day's
work. In all probability the Purari woman does not get through so
much.</p>

<p>At Iai, rather to our astonishment, there was quite a
<i>furore</i> to engage, and we went away with the <i>Kia Ora's</i>
accommodation pretty severely taxed&mdash;"the connection of which
with the plot" did not appear until some days later, when we heard
that the Iai warriors had been in mischief and were very anxious
indeed to get out of the way of possible vengeance. If anyone ever
deserved retribution, they did. They had asked eleven of the people
from a neighbouring village to come over and spend a happy day with
them. The people (who certainly ought to have known their
neighbours a little better) accepted the invitation. They put on
their dogs'-teeth necklaces and their parrot-feather haloes,
painted their faces in fresh black and red, and arrived in canoes,
prepared to have a good time. There was a good time; but, as things
turned out, only the Iaians had it. They also had the
visitors&mdash;boiled, with sticks of sago.</p>

<p>A return call was confidently expected before long from the
survivors, and the Iaians, innocent and guilty alike, were very
anxious to he "not at home." For this reason a score or two of the
party-givers came away with us, hoping, no doubt, that any local
prejudice would have time to subside before they came back from the
plantations. The actual murderers did not enlist. They were
captured by the police some time afterwards.</p>

<p>FROM Iai we made our way out into the open sea without any
further disasters, and took our way Port Moresby-wards with our
cargo of plantation hands. All of them on arrival were taken up to
the magistrate, who satisfied himself that they understood what
thcy were going to do and how much they were going to get. If any
one of them at this stage of the proceedings had changed his mind
about going on with the affair, the recruiter would have been
obliged to take him back to his home at the earliest opportunity,
and meantime provide him with food and lodging. None of them did
change their minds, however, and in the course of a few hours the
whole hundred had affixed their marks to the contract which the
recruiting agent had already signed. It was discovered about this
time that there were several men more than could be accounted
for&mdash;in fact, that we had actually been carrying stowaways!
The extra hands were as anxious as the others to sign on, and went
away quite pleased with themselves.</p>

<p>Well, I had "seen the Medway," and that was more than any one of
the planters who anticipated shortage of labour had done. What
conclusions were suggested?</p>

<p>This only&mdash;that the alarm was the purest of myth. Since
that visit a year and a half has passed, and the plantations that
were to have been long ago "held up" for want of boys are still
working full pressure. The great unknown and uncivilised West has
enough men to supply the plantations ten times over for many years
to come. I do not wonder that those who have never seen the dense
population of the rivers should imagine judging by the more thinly
peopled districts of the East&mdash;that the supply might have a
limit. But no one who has seen the West, and been actual witness of
the readiness which the natives display to enlist, can think that
there are not "hands" in plenty for all Papua.</p>

<p>The eastern districts supply very good men, better in some ways
than the "Kiwai," as the western people are called. They are less
quarrelsome among themselves, and seem to learn the plantation work
quicker. The intellect of the western, however, appears to be
capable of a higher development in exceptional cases. I have seen a
coffee plantation left under the sole charge of a "Kiwai" overseer,
who attended to the weeding, picking, pulping, and drying of the
coffee without any regular help, though the owner used to make a
visit to the place once in a few weeks. On another plantation not
far from this, the native labourers under charge of a Kiwai got in
the whole crop of coffee without any direction during the absence
of the owner, who had always seen to it himself before.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust22" id="illust22"></a><img src=

</p>

<p>It would be a great deal too much to say that the Papuan is as
satisfactory, or as cheap, as the Cingalese or Chinese worker; but
his wages (ten shillings a month) are not high, and he serves his
turn well on the whole. The importation of foreign labour is
forbidden by the laws of the Papuan Government, so, for good or
ill, he must be made the best of.</p>

<p>On one of the plantations a new system is at present being tried
with very good results. It has been recognised for some time that
there are drawbacks to the custom of taking away a large number of
the young men from a village, sometimes for years together. Some of
the women are left without their husbands, and quarrels and murders
often occur in consequence; others remain unmarried, and the
population does not increase as it should. The workers themselves
often grow discontented at the absence of their women, and do not
sign on for a second term, though well enough contented with the
work and pay. To remedy this one planter is putting up married
quarters for his men, and enabling them to bring their wives with
them free of expense. Ground for yam and manioc growing is given
them, and rations provided free for the wife while the first crop
of native food is being raised. Each couple is given a neat little
separate house, built by the carpenter of the plantation. The wife
is not asked to work unless she chooses, but if she cares to take a
hand with light weeding, mat and basket making, gathering crops, or
other temporary labour, she is paid by the piece, and so are the
children if any of them are old enough to help. It is hoped that in
this way permanent villages of skilled workers will be gathered
about the plantations and the expense and trouble of recruiting
much lessened. On the plantation referred to the manager has
actually taken the step of presenting the boys with sufficient
"trade" to buy a wife, provided they bring their wives with them to
stay out their engagement. The offer has created unprecedented
excitement, and the consequent demand for wives has almost caused a
rise in the market. This is easily understood when one considers
that a good many of the "boys" recruit almost solely with the
object of accumulating wealth enough to purchase a wife at the end
of their term of labour.</p>

<p>I wanted to see this plantation, so I took advantage of an
opportunity that presented itself later on, and left the <i>Merrie
England</i> one morning very early in a whaleboat towed by a
launch. It is rather inconveniently situated, being twelve miles up
a river, but nevertheless the country immediately round seems to be
popular, as seven other plantations are to be found in the same
district.</p>

<p>Through water-forests of nipa palm, under towering mangrove
trees a hundred feet high, the ugly, useful little steam-launch
panted her way mile after mile. Sometimes we crossed great shallow
lagoons where a good look out for sand-banks had to be kept;
sometimes we glided along through dense overarching shade in a
stream deep enough to float an ocean liner. There were no banks to
this river; the trees sprang straight up out of the stream after
the strange fashion of New Guinea, and one could see the sparkle of
dark stagnant water far in among the depths of the surrounding
forest. It seemed as if there had been a huge inundation, burying
all the land, and only allowing the trees to emerge. Very still
indeed was the whole weird tangle of forest and river through which
we threaded our way&mdash;these rivers are always still as sleep,
running as they do sheltered and hidden at the bottom of their
great canons of mangrove, where not a breath of wind can stir the
palms and the trailing, suffocating liana creepers. There was only
one obvious thing to do&mdash;go to sleep until the plantation was
reached; so I did.</p>

<p>Three hours later we got to the landing-stage, a rough, strong
platform of logs, with a "corduroy road," also of logs, leading up
from it towards the plantation manager's hut. The place is
interesting in this land of brand-new plantations, being the only
one where rubber is being tried on a fairly large scale. Eight
thousand acres have been taken up. At the time of my visit six
hundred were cleared and planted with Para rubber. It looked rather
a desolate scene, as the whole six hundred acres was in one large
bare block, covered with a raffle of decaying branches and black
half-burned trunks of trees, among which the slender young saplings
of rubber were scarcely noticeable. Another year or two would sec a
beautiful park of many shady avenues take the place of this
wilderness, but only the eye of faith could see anything attractive
about the plantation as it looked early in 1909.</p>

<p>One of the assistant managers, in the absence of the head, took
our little party round and explained with enthusiasm all that had
been done. It was evident that he loved every straggling
rubber-stump and each feathery little seedling like his own child.
The "nursery" almost moved him to tears; and in truth it was a
pretty sight, with the hundreds of bright green seedlings clustered
together in beds and the taller plants set neatly in hedges beneath
the shelter of the surrounding forest. A good many of the saplings
had attained the height of fourteen feet in fourteen months from
the sowing of the seed. The soil of this district is like most
Papuan soils, rich enough to act as a natural forcing-house on
anything that is planted in it. Rubber is a very greedy tree, and
cannot be grown without plenty of rain, plenty of sun, plenty of
the richest constituents in the soil&mdash;in fact, unless "done
well" in every way, it will not do you well. If you can satisfy its
demands, however, it will make you wealthy in a very few years.
Here are some of the figures put briefly.</p>

<p>A hundred acres of rubber costs about a thousand pounds to clear
and plant, including every possible expense, and leaving a margin
of a hundred pounds or more for contingencies. The weeding and
upkeep of the plantation for six years, until the trees are ready
to tap, will cost another fifteen hundred, if the owner manages
himself. If he employs a manager, he will have to pay him about
three hundred a year, which adds eighteen hundred more. Assuming
that the owner does his own managing (always the best plan if
possible), the plantation will have cost him about two thousand
five hundred pounds by the time it begins to pay back. He will also
have had to keep himself; but if he lives on his plantation the
expense of this is small.</p>

<p>In the sixth year the trees, at a low estimate, should give a
pound of rubber each. At five shillings a pound, eighty-six trees
being planted to the acre, this is equal to £2150&mdash;very nearly
the whole of the expenditure already. In the next year the yield
should be doubled, and later on it will, under ordinary conditions,
rise as high as eight pounds a tree&mdash;possibly much more. An
income of seventeen thousand a year, from an original expenditure
of not much over two, should be good enough to please the most
exacting.</p>

<p>Will the present price of rubber keep up? There is every reason
to suppose that it will, as the demand constantly increases. But
even if it falls considerably, there will still be a large profit.
It has been calculated that when, or if; rubber is procurable at
three shillings a pound, it will pay street paving contractors to
make very extensive use of it. In that case the demand for paving
work will be enormous. Anything over a shilling a pound is profit
to the grower.</p>

<p>There is another word to be said about the matter. All these
calculations are based on what has been done by rubber planters in
Ceylon, the Malay States, and other well-known colonies, as it is
not yet six years since the first of the rubber trees (those in the
Astrolabe plantations) were set out. But there is good reason to
suppose that Papua may do better. It is the natural home of the
rubber tree. For a good many years, off and on, a certain amount of
rubber from the wild trees of the country <i>(Ficus rigo)</i> has
been irregularly sent to the home and colonial markets, and has
always fetched high prices. Now the <i>Haevia Braziliensis,</i> or
Para rubber, which is of late being planted, is much superior to
the <i>Ficus rigo,</i> which in this country seems to equal the
Para in others. The inference is that the Para will do better in
Papua than it has done anywhere else.</p>

<p>So far as experience goes, it carries out this supposition. The
manager of the plantation I visited had come to Papua from Ceylon,
one of the chief rubber-growing countries of the world. He was of
opinion that his plantation looked better and promised better than
anything he had ever had under his hands before. The rapid growth
of the young rubber was phenomenal, and it did not seem to be
suffering in any way from its quick development. It must be
remembered in this connection that all the Asiatic countries have
been inhabited for centuries by civilised, industrious peoples, who
have fully understood the value of the soil and taken all they
could get out of it. Papua, on the contrary, has been in the hands
of absolute savages of the lowest kind. They know nothing of
agriculture, except so far as concerns the raising of a minimum of
easy crops of vegetables and fruit, and the ground that has already
been used for this sort of farming bears about as much relation to
the virgin soils as a biscuit might to a large dining-room table.
Further, the soil of Papua is very probably richer in itself than
that of any other British colony, owing to the local conditions of
constant heat, large rainfall maintained by very high mountains,
dense vegetation, and numberless rivers.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust23" id="illust23"></a><img src=
"1501051h-images/TNNG-23.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=

</p>

<p>It is indeed a land of rivers. On the plantation I was visiting
there are so many rivers, large and small, that they are simply
known by numbers&mdash;"Creek" number one, number two, and so on.
Water carriage is easy everywhere in the low country; even the
plantations that are many miles inland can always have a river to
act as beast of burden. In the mountains you must use mules, which
are costly, but then the mountain climate is perfect, and that of
the low country is not, though by no means so bad as it has been
represented. Each district has its own advantages and its own
drawbacks.</p>

<p>On these lowland plantations life is much the same as in the
mountains, with this difference, that communication with Moresby or
Samarai is quick and easy, being carried on by the plantation
launch or cutter. Food is largely supplied by the shooting boys,
who spend their time tramping the bush with a shot-gun and an
allowance of cartridges, stalking wild pig, wallaby, pigeon, duck,
and miscellaneous birds. Most kinds of English
vegetables&mdash;lettuce, cabbage, carrots, radishes,
etc.&mdash;can be grown on the plantation with little trouble.
There are many tropical vegetables which are very good of their
kind, such as yams, sweet potatoes, pumpkins, chokos, aubergines,
manioc, and which help to make a variety. Bananas and plantains,
which are a variety of cooking banana, will in any case be grown
for the labour. Cocoanuts are most useful in the tropical cuisine,
and can be obtained elsewhere. Fish are to be caught in most of the
rivers. Fruit can be grown in any quantity&mdash;pineapples do
rather too well, having a tendency to "take charge" of the place if
not restrained: pawpaws (a kind of tree-melon) spring up like
weeds, and granadilla, which is certainly the queen fruit of the
tropics, as well as passion-fruit, not much its inferior, can be
trained over trellis work near the house to add to the beauty of
the surroundings with their lovely flowers and leaves. Oranges,
lemons, and limes grow wild in many places, and can be quickly
raised where they do not. On the whole, the planter lives well in a
simple way, and his food costs him as nearly as possible
nothing.</p>

<p>Houses are generally built of native materials out of the bush
at first, as a wood and iron bungalow costs several hundred pounds,
and the other, if built by plantation labour, need not cost more
than fifty. These houses of thatch, bark, and split branches are
quite comfortable and weatherproof and very picturesque. They
harbour insects, however, rather more than is convenient and need a
good many small repairs; for which reason the prosperous planter
generally orders himself a bungalow of wood and corrugated iron
from Sydney when he feels that he can afford luxuries, and settles
down in a house with glass windows (which are never closed), an
iron roof, a boarded verandah, and (if he has a wife) a
drawing-room full of cane and bentwood furniture, framed
photographs, and mats. The sitting-room is quite certain to be
decorated with native clubs and arrows arranged in trophies on the
walls, stone axe-heads, alligator jaws, swordfish swords, huge
clam-shells, pearl-shell necklaces, head-dresses of coloured
feathers, and other Papuan curios. There will be saddles and
bridles on the back verandah, and samples of hemp or rubber or
coffee&mdash;<i>un peu partout.</i> There will be half a dozen
home-made canvas stretchers and some mosquito nets and blankets
stowed away somewhere for the accommodation of any unexpected
guests who may happen to sail or ride in and demand a lodging.
Nothing more is necessary; a Papuan planter house can put up an
extra dozen without feeling it at any time. Most people sleep in
the open air by preference, and the verandah of even the smallest
house can easily be made into a comfortable dormitory for as many
as you may please.</p>

</p>

<p>At the present time the tendency of settlers is to take up land
in a district where they are sure of a few neighbours, such as
Galley Reach, which has eight plantations, large and small, or
Sogeri, in the Astrolabe, which has three. This is very natural,
but restricts the planter a good deal in his choice. Some of the
very best districts in Papua have not yet been so much as inquired
after. It would be a great advantage to the colony and to settlers
themselves if they could come in parties and take up a good extent
of country among five or six friends. This would avoid the complete
isolation which new-corners naturally dread, and at the same time
would open up excellent country which is at present being
neglected.</p>

<p>It will scarcely be believed, but is nevertheless true, that
land of the best quality, lying close beside the towns, still
remains to be taken up. While staying at Samarai I spent a day
walking in the bush to gather some personal impression of what yet
remained in the way of "plums" for the enterprising selector. The
tale of that day is worth telling in a chapter about
plantations.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust25" id="illust25"></a><img src=
"1501051h-images/TNNG-25.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=
"Illustration">
</p>

<p>I had been staying on Samarai for some weeks, but was busy with
other work, and had (like most people) taken it for granted that at
the present stage of the country's development all the good land
lying close up to the largest town in the Territory must
necessarily have been secured. Samarai is built on a small island
some two miles from the mainland of Papua, and is surrounded by
very beautiful scenery of hills and valleys sloping down to the
shores of the many bays and inlets that indent the coast. From the
verandah of the hotels you can almost count the trees on the
shores, and can see every little clearing and every patch planted
with native food as clearly as if you were beside them.</p>

<p>"I suppose all that is taken up long ago?" I said vaguely one
day, hanging over the verandah railing and looking out at the
splendid view across the harbour.</p>

<p>"All what?" asked the resident, who was lounging in a
hammock-chair close at hand.</p>

<p>"That land in sight of Samarai, on the mainland. I wonder why
they don't clear it."</p>

<p>"Some of it's native&mdash;not much. The rest isn't
anybody's&mdash;most of it."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing that I know of."</p>

<p>"Then why does no one apply for it?"</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"To plant&mdash;land only half an hour from the steamer
wharf!"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;to plant! Yes, somebody has taken up some, I
believe&mdash;a few acres somewhere to grow something, I forget
what."</p>

<p>"Don't you think it will be worth a good deal of money by and
by?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. It never was worth any that I remember. Soil? Oh,
yes, I suppose it's all right. But nobody wants it."</p>

<p>"Why in the name of common sense don't they?"</p>

<p>"Well, come to think of it, you can't plant for nothing, and
we're none of us millionaires here."</p>

<p>The argument seemed sound so far as it went. It appeared worth
while, all the same, to take a boat across to the other side and
see what there was to be seen. Guessing from previous experience
what that might be, I was careful to put on hobnailed boots and a
dress that had seen so much service as to be incapable of further
damage. It is not in silk attire that one must walk the bush
country of Papua.</p>

<p>The boat landed myself and a friend on a narrow strip of shore
backed up by primaeval forest country standing on its hind
legs&mdash;the usual conformation of the bush. A small red scratch
ran through it. This was called the track. I did not call it a
track: what I did call it at various times during the day that
followed I should prefer not to repeat. It was almost entirely
composed (like the diet of a fasting saint) of roots and water, and
you used your hands as much as your feet in getting along it. After
a mile or so of this rough going we came out into a clearing where
there was a little house built of native materials and a white man
moving about in the open. This was the pioneer of the
district&mdash;the only man who has made a settlement in that part
of the coast.</p>

<p>Mr. S&mdash;&mdash; greeted us very hospitably, and offered to
guide us to a hill some miles away, where we could get a good view
of the surrounding country. His own little clearing&mdash;but a
very few acres&mdash;was on a modest, not to say a minute scale,
and nothing was yet planted. Want of capital was the handicap here,
as in other cases. But Mr. S&mdash;&mdash; hopes to be able to put
in some rubber by degrees, and he is as enthusiastic about the
possibilities of the surrounding country as if he were a squatter
owning hundreds of thousands of acres.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust26" id="illust26"></a><img src=
"1501051h-images/TNNG-26.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=

</p>

<p>It is hard for people who have never been out of the civilised
countries to realise the difficulties of moving about in absolutely
untouched tropical lands. Every yard of the way must be made, and
the making is of the roughest kind. When you face the edge of a
clearing you are confronted by a wall of forest that does not
indeed look quite impenetrable, but that is nevertheless as
complete a barrier as a brick wall. It is not all composed of huge
trees&mdash;the growth is too dense for that&mdash;-but of
moderate-sized trunks and saplings for the most part, knitted and
laced together with inconspicuous little creepers, many of them
thorny, that must be cut through before you can set one foot before
the other. Fallen logs, half-fallen logs, slanting broken boughs,
holes and pits where dead roots have rotted away, still further
block your progress. A "track" in country still unsettled means
simply a part of the bush from which the worst obstacles have been
removed, more or less. The logs lying crossways at a height of four
or five feet, all filled up with rubbish, have been taken away;
those that can be scrambled or stepped over are left. Some of the
small trees have been cut down and most of the slanting branches
removed. It is now possible to proceed along a footing of roots and
slippery clay, clambering over a log now and then, and dodging
branches every few yards, walking through a stream when you come to
one and following its bed wherever the water is shallow enough,
climbing up hills that are almost perpendicular every few minutes
with caked dirt on your boots and despair in your heart as you
realise that the next hundred yards will wrest from you in one
rapid down-plunge all that you have painfully gained in the last
half-mile, and avoiding as best you may pitfalls everywhere laid
for the unwary foot by loops and snares of root-fibre. This you
will be told is a track.</p>

<p>When a district is cleared and opened out, and constant traffic
of carriers, mules, and horses begins to pass along, the miry
bottoms are filled up, the trees kept permanently cut, and log
bridges built over the gullies. I have seen astonishingly good
roads up in the mountain districts made by the workers of a
plantation on a spot where only a few months before the worst of
"tracks" used to exasperate the unfortunate traveller. The
Government spends every year a certain amount of money on roads,
but the funds available for this purpose are small, and at the
present time almost every planter has made, or is making, his own
roads. It is not a very serious matter after all when one has
already undertaken the job of clearing the forest off hundreds of
acres of land; and once made, a very little work will keep the
roads in fair order.</p>

<p>After three miles or so of track scrambling we reached a tiny
native village, standing on the top of a sharply pointed hill.
Here, Mr. S&mdash;&mdash; informed me, I could get a view of the
surrounding district and see what there was to be had.</p>

<p>The view was pretty but not enlightening: a sea of dark green
tree-tops sparkling after recent rain; heights and hollows filled
up and covered by billows of leafage; land somewhere underneath, no
doubt, but no visible sign of it. Mr. S, however, was enthusiastic
in his praise of the whole district&mdash;all close to Samarai, all
within sight of the sea if the tree-tops were not in your way, all
the richest of soil, all well watered (I could answer for that, and
so could my clothes). There was no gold thereabouts, he added
apologetically, as if he felt that it was an unpardonable omission
on the part of someone&mdash;the creeks had been prospected, and
there was not so much as a colour. But there were two or three
other things that would repay investigation. Did I see that tree
with the orange-red bark? It was the kind of bark that would make
excellent paper with a little treatment. There was a great deal of
good brick clay about the district, and he had seen plenty of
ironstone. There was forty acres of sago all in one plot not very
far away; it was good sago country. On the whole, an excellent
district, and he wondered that no one but himself had taken up
land.</p>

<p>I went back again in the afternoon, very wet and dirty, but
satisfied with the day. If I were taking up land in Papua I should
certainly select it on the coast. The coast lands are as good as
any others, and the advantage of easy access in a country of such
irregular surface is too great to be neglected.</p>

<p>But one could imagine the new settler&mdash;especially if he is
just out from home&mdash;being struck with despair as he sees his
newly acquired estate for the first time. A dark, wet, gloomy,
silent forest, impenetrable as a wall, slimy underfoot, dripping
overhead&mdash;it takes the eye of faith to see in all this promise
of future prosperity and comfort; to realise that the hideous soil
is almost pure leaf-mould, generations old and full of fatness;
that the encumbering trees are in many cases valuable timber, and
that most of the sopping, spongy wet will pass away when the land
is laid open to light and air...The pioneer earns his prosperity
dearly enough; still, here as elsewhere, all things come to him who
can afford to wait.</p>

<p>Rubber is by no means the only culture to be recommended,
although it is one about which much has been heard. Copra is
preferred by a good many, and it certainly has its advantages.
Copra is the trade term for the dried kernel of the cocoanut. The
demand for this product is steady and safe and not much subject to
market fluctuations. It is very largely used in the composition of
some of the best-known soaps in the world, and is also much in
demand for cocoa-butter, oil, oil-cake, and other manufactures.
Little or no skill is required in its preparing, since that is
simply a matter of cutting and drying the nuts. The work of
planting and weeding cocoanut palms and preparing copra is one that
the native takes to very easily, as he is already familiar with
most of it. Six years is the average time before the trees come
into bearing; they remain in bearing for something like seventy or
eighty. Half a ton of copra an acre is safe to reckon on; good
trees well looked after should produce much more when ten or
fifteen years old. The present price of copra sold in Papua is £14
a ton. It has been on the increase for years past, and there is no
reason to suppose that it will be less in future.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust27" id="illust27"></a><img src=
"1501051h-images/TNNG-27.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=
"Illustration">
</p>

<p>A plantation of a hundred acres, therefore, after six years
should begin by producing about £700 yearly, and will eventually be
worth almost double as much. Its first cost will depend very much
on the district it is in, as clearing expenses vary largely. I have
seen a fine plantation that was cleared and planted for less than
£2 an acre; but the price is generally more. Local contractors will
undertake any kind of clearing and planting for £6 an acre; and no
doubt a good profit is made out of this.</p>

<p>The truth is that it is hardly possible to give precise figures
as to expenses that will provide for all conditions. Most planters
keep accounts rather loosely, and not all are willing to tell what
their profits may be. It can be generally said about copra that it
is as safe and simple a thing as a man can undertake, and that it
is pre-eminently the culture for the settler who wishes to make a
future provision for his children. The uses of the cocoanut are so
many that there is no reasonable possibility of its being driven
out by chemical manufactures. An estate in going order will always
sell well if the owner wishes to dispose of it, and it takes less
money to keep up than almost any other kind of plantation, nor does
it go to pieces if altogether neglected for a few years.</p>

<p>The item of working expenses is another that can hardly be
figured out precisely without actual conditions as a guide. Some
planters find that £150 a year, exclusive of manager's salary, will
keep a plantation of a hundred acres going; others place the figure
a little higher; one puts it a good deal lower. There is nothing to
do during the six years of waiting but keep the place weeded; and
in some districts labour of a casual kind, quite suitable for such
work, can be had for seven shillings a month.</p>

<p>This six years' waiting is the principal trouble with the two
great cultures of Papua, rubber and copra. At first sight, sisal
hemp and other quickly paying plants seem so much more profitable
that one wonders why anyone ever undertakes the slow-growing
cocoanut or <i>Haevia Braziliensis.</i> But it must not be
forgotten that these two trees make a life provision, and something
more, for their cultivators, whereas hemp, cotton, etc., only last
a short time. If one does not care to keep on an estate
indefinitely, the copra or rubber plantation sells for a high
figure, since, once made, it is made for a generation or more, and
will go on producing money beyond the life of its makers. This is
the real value of rubber and copra.</p>

<p>The interval of waiting is of course a serious difficulty to
small capitalists. "Catch crops," however, can be made use of to
lessen the expense. There is a good market for maize in the
Territory, and two crops a year can be produced almost
anywhere&mdash;in some cases three or four. Bananas, which bear in
fifteen months, have not yet been grown commercially in Papua; but
there is no reason why they should not be cultivated in the coast
districts, as the monthly steamers can take them to the Australian
markets without transhipping. Peanuts and millet pay well in the
New Hebrides, and should do well in Papua also if tried. The number
of possible catch crops is large, but the nature of the country
would in most cases limit choice to one or two. With good
management and economy, the planter should be able to keep himself
and his plantation going by catch crops during the whole of the six
years. As regards rubber, there are several kinds of temporary
crops that actually benefit the young tree, since it demands a good
deal of shade.</p>

<p>The native rubber of Papua, <i>Ficus rigo,</i> has hardly
received the attention that it deserves. It has some disadvantages,
the chief of which is that it takes a year longer to come into
bearing than the Para, and that it does not at first produce so
much rubber, though what it does produce is quite as valuable. But
it can be grown in the "dry belt," where the climate is bright and
comparatively cool almost all the year. The country is open and
grassy, and clearing is extremely light. This dry belt, which
extends for about a hundred miles along the coast near Port
Moresby, and is only a few miles wide, is eminently suited to the
<i>Ficus rigo.</i> One planter has put in a good many acres, but as
this variety of rubber does not bear till eight years old, there
has been no opportunity of seeing what can be done with it on a
large scale. The trees on this plantation look extremely well, and
require little care. They are easier to plant and rear than the
Para rubber. In the eighth year a <i>Ficus rigo</i> gives about
half to three-quarters of a pound of rubber, and goes on increasing
in yield till it is fifteen or twenty years old, by which time a
healthy tree should be producing as much as seven or eight pounds.
The life of the tree, judging by the wild specimens, is very long,
some rubber trees of great but unknown age being quite a forest in
themselves, and covering many hundreds of feet with the spread of
their immense branches.</p>

<p>The advantages of native rubber over Para may be summed up in a
few words. It is somewhat cheaper to plant (exact figures cannot be
given, as the only native rubber that has been planted was worked
together with other products). It flourishes in a dry, bright
climate and in open country, where the Para rubber could not be
grown. It is native to the Territory, and therefore more resistant
in all probability to any form of parasite or disease than Para
would be.</p>

<p>Its disadvantages are: eight years before tapping, as against
six years, and a slightly lesser return than the Para when first
tapped.</p>

<p>I am enabled to give some pictures of the native rubber, as I
visited the plantation where it is being grown together with sisal
hemp. Several planters have taken up this last product, which seems
likely to become very popular. There is no long waiting for
returns, as the hemp bears in two and a half years, and the prices
obtained are very paying.</p>

<p>The plantation is in the "dry belt," about three miles from the
sea.</p>

<p>A beautiful little sea village is built far out in the water
near the landing-place. It belongs to the natives of the coast, and
is inhabited by several hundred people. The houses are not
connected in any way with the shore, but stand out by themselves in
the clear green water some hundreds of yards from the beach. They
are built on strong piles about ten feet high, with ladders
reaching up to the doors and verandahs hanging clear out over the
cool salt waves. We had no time to visit the village, but one could
easily imagine how fresh and pleasant the houses must be,
especially in the trying "between seasons" period, when the
trade-wind has knocked off work and the monsoon has not yet begun,
the air is dark with heat, and the mosquitoes rival the Plagues of
Egypt in virulence. The architectural skill shown in these houses
is remarkable. Although sheltered by the reef from actual storms,
they must at times experience a good deal of bad weather; yet all
the piles stood straight and firm in the water, and none of the
roofs seemed tilted. One wonders how the supports were ever driven
deep enough by a people entirely ignorant of all but the roughest
tools. One wonders also what the mortality from drowning may be
among the babies: the moated granges of Old England, which must
have been such a source of trouble to anxious mothers, were nothing
compared with the water villages of Papua.</p>

<p>Once landed, we had an exceedingly enjoyable walk up a grassy
avenue three miles long leading to the plantation. The avenue was
bordered with graceful young cocoanut palms, tall flamboyant trees
alight with geranium-coloured blooms, white-flowered acacias, kapok
or silk-cotton trees, and the beautiful frangipani, with its
dark-green, lance-shaped leaves and perfumed creamy flowers. Grassy
plains stretched away to left and right, hemmed in by distant
hills, while in front, as the long avenue unwound, the distance
began to show blue-green with the slopes and levels of the planted
hemp. It was a beautiful scene, and none the less lovely for the
fact that all this picturesqueness had cost no more than the making
of a country lane in England. In the opulent tropics, the man who
at home would have to put up with a semi-detached villa and half an
acre of clayey garden, vacant six months out of twelve, can be
master of an estate more beautiful and better laid out than a
nobleman's park.</p>

<p>We passed through the hemp plantation before reaching the
house&mdash;a pretty bungalow on the peak of a hill, reached by a
little avenue of huge hemp plants set in borders. Sisal hemp is in
appearance like the aloe that flourishes in tubs in the courtyards
of so many continental hotels. Set out in the endless rows of a
plantation, it is stiff, quaint, and picturesque, and its glaucous
blue-green colour gives a certain coolness&mdash;often illusory
enough&mdash;to the landscape.</p>

<p>The planter told me that about £1500 would clear, plant, and
keep up a plantation of 100 acres, including house, living, wages,
etc., until the plants bear; but it would be well to contemplate
something beyond this sum for the unforeseen, such as illness,
journeys, etc. The life of the hemp plant for crops is five or six
years; it is ready for cutting in the third year from planting. The
supply is kept up by occasional planting in between the first
rows.</p>

<p>Looking at the results the figures certainly seem attractive, as
over £1500 can be expected for the first year's crop, and there
will still be four or five more crops to come on, while the capital
expenditure has been but £2000. The preparing of the fibre is not a
complicated matter, and the small amount of machinery used by this
plantation was at the time of my visit being driven by a Papuan
native quite successfully.</p>

<p>It is only fair to state that in hemp as well as in rubber the
inquirer sometimes finds theory ahead of fact in Papua. No one has
yet made cent per cent on his capital out of either <i>Haevia
Braziliensis</i> or <i>Ficus rigo.</i> The figures given are based
on calculations of what small plantations worked by men of small
means have done and on the excellent appearance of the coming crops
on the larger and newer plantations. If a score or two of fortunes
had been made in the country (as they certainly will be made in the
next few years) it would be widely known and extensively "rushed,"
and anything that the present writer could tell would not have the
advantage of novelty. It is hardly necessary to say that the
wildest estimates as to possible profits on hemp, rubber,
cocoanuts, etc., are current in many parts of Papua, but the
sensible settler will take these for what they are worth. The
reality seems good enough for any reasonable person.</p>

<p>A good many small islands, mostly about the eastern end of
Papua, have been taken up from time to time by various people.
There is something perennially attractive to the Briton in the idea
of an island of his own. The longing finds its expression in
endless songs, in half the stories that delight the youth of the
country, and in the rush of purchasers that always follows the rare
advertisements of islands for sale about the English or Scottish
coasts. Settlers anxious to find an island home in the Pacific are
known to every Australasian steamship company, and some of them
find their way to Papua.</p>

<p>There is plenty of choice for the would-be island king about the
immense coasts of the Territory, but one cannot conscientiously
recommend island life in Papua for anyone but the hermit or the
crank. The coral isles of the poet's dream are indeed here, but the
South Sea atmosphere is not. The attractive, well-mannered native
of Polynesia is here replaced by the Stone Age savage, or by no one
at all, many of the islands being quite uninhabited, and a good
many of them are so far removed from the mainland as to be useless
to anyone who does not want to cut himself off from his kind for
life.</p>

<p>But of these islands I shall have more to say later on.</p>

<p>So far, the planters of Papua have confined their energies to
the production of coffee, copra, rubber, and hemp. There are many
other tropical products that would pay equally well, but all is so
new and so untried in this first colony of a colony that the
industries of the place can scarcely be said to have found their
feet.</p>

<p>Cotton has been experimentally tried and proved to be of very
fine quality. A number of spices and drugs have been grown in the
Government nurseries with good results. Few planters so much as
think of drugs or spices, but they have their good points, not
among the least of which is comparative smallness of bulk. This
saves a great deal of expense in transit, and in the case of
certain drugs even allows the grower to dispose of his produce by
parcel post.</p>

<p>In the near future there can be little doubt that sugar will
take a place superior in importance to that of rubber, copra, or
fibres.</p>

<p>Papua is pre-eminently, by nature, the sugar country of the
south. Sugar-cane grows wild all over the Territory, from sea-level
up to 6000 feet of altitude; and its quality, even in a natural
state, is so high that planters in Fiji and Queensland constantly
send to the country for cuttings. One agent lately sent out by a
well-known sugar-growing company succeeded in obtaining over 200
varieties of cane, nearly all of them new. A visitor who had been
in charge of a large Queensland plantation gave it as his opinion
that much of Papua was ahead of the famous Johnson River
sugar-growing country, and would produce record crops if planted.
In the north-eastern division there are hundreds of square miles of
open, well-watered country, fit to grow the finest cane in the
world, that have never so much as been seen by a white man, with
the exception of the Resident Magistrate, who patrols the district
at intervals of a few months. None of it is occupied or needed by
the natives, and most of it is within easy reach of the coast. This
district is sure to be among the first taken up when the sugar
industry gets a fair start.</p>

<p>Sugar, however, is one of the things that do not concern the
individual planter. It requires capital running into many thousands
to start a business of this kind, and companies are needed to
furnish the money. Nor need the canny speculator hope to "grab"
large districts in the sugar country and hold them until they
become valuable, for the land laws of Papua have been framed with
the object of nipping just such brilliant ideas as these in the
bud. Land cannot be held unless it is improved; the speculator who
tries to block large areas for his own purposes will find himself
obliged to make way for someone with less desire for the "unearned
increment" and more inclination towards hard work. Nor can anyone
take up more than a limited amount of land, 10,000 acres being the
most allowed to one person. If these regulations are at times
harassing to the company promoter, especially to the speculative
type that makes its profits at the expense of the shareholders,
they are protective to the individual worker, and it is, after all,
the man with a moderate capital and a hard-working disposition who
does the making of new countries.</p>

<p>Several companies have taken up land in Papua for rubber, copra,
and hemp-growing, and are understood to be doing very well. The
Government is not "down on" the company promoter who is prepared to
develop his holding in a reasonable time and to acquiesce in local
labour conditions and laws. New countries need the company as well
as the private individual to set the wheels going. But it is
certain that in Papua, at all events, there will be no money made
by locking up lands, whether it is an association or an individual
that attempts to do the locking.</p>

<p>This is a detail that carries small significance to an
Englishman. It carries much more to an Australian, since the
greatest social difficulty that Australia has at present to face is
this very problem of locked-up lands. Large areas of highly
productive land taken up by the early settlers were held for
generations as sheep and cattle runs or left unused, and have now
to be bought back by the Government at high prices and subdivided
among a crowd of eager settlers. This is a difficulty that only
affects some of the States, but nevertheless the inconvenience and
expense have been serious enough to make Australians shy of
incurring a repetition in the new colony where all things are
possible. The new land laws of Papua are the work of the present
Lieutenant-Governor, who belongs to New South Wales, a State that
has suffered more than others from "locking-up" troubles.</p>

<p>In a chapter devoted to the industries of Papua it would be
impossible to omit the timber trade, although nothing has been
heard of it as yet outside the colony. Indeed, one might almost say
that so far the timber trade does not exist. A good deal of land
has been taken up and some clearing done, but sawmills have not at
the time of writing been introduced (with the exception of two
small mills used by the missions), and it is scarcely possible to
make money out of Papuan timber if it cannot be cut up on the spot,
as freights arc rather high. Still, the hopes of the industry are
rose-coloured. The amount of good timber is unlimited, most of it
is very easily got at, and the sale even in Papua may be depended
on as large and constant.</p>

<p>One of the Government Forest Inspectors of Queensland was lately
sent up to Papua to report on the timbers by the Commonwealth
authorities. His account, compiled after many months of travel and
investigation, spoke in the highest terms of the value and variety
of Papuan woods. Among those specially noted were sixteen varieties
suitable for beams, girders, railway waggons, or other positions in
which a heavy strain is encountered; ten suitable for carriage
building; fifteen suitable for joinery, lining, and flooring; and
fourteen woods of great beauty, suited to furniture and cabinet
work. The cedar of the country is exceptionally well fitted for
boat-building, and one of the canoe woods, the "ilimo," found up to
five or six feet in diameter, would probably be valuable to yacht
builders, from its notable lightness and strength. The "mahia," the
"ohabu," and the "oma" are also good boat-building woods. The
"kasi-kasi," "porou," "mariau," and "togara" have the very valuable
property of being incorrodible in water and resistant to the
attacks of marine insects. They have been used for piles with much
success.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust28" id="illust28"></a><img src=
"1501051h-images/TNNG-28.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=
"Illustration">
</p>

<p>Very many of the hardwoods are reported as suitable for sleepers
and street paving blocks. There is plenty of cedar to be had; the
sandalwood is almost used up, but some still remains. Woods
resembling mahogany, rosewood, satinwood; woods that are dark red
or deep yellow in colour, full of natural oils, hard almost as
iron, and so heavy as to sink in water, fine and firm of grain as
box, light and tough as pine, are to be found among the treasures
of the forests. There are also many woods that are known to produce
dyes and gums, but it is not yet known what their commercial value
may be.</p>

<p>At the present time, anyone who likes is at liberty to cut and
carry away these valuable woods for practically nothing. The charge
made by the Government for the use of timber lands&mdash;10s. per
100 acres&mdash;is only intended to prevent anyone taking up more
land than he can make use of. There is a regulation obliging every
lessee of timber areas to put up a sawmill within a reasonable
period; but this is what the timber speculator would naturally wish
to do in his own interests.</p>

<p>It is impossible to say what any man might make out of the
almost untouched timbers of Papua, because no one has as yet made a
fair trial. But certain facts speak for themselves.</p>

<p>Australian timbers are being so rapidly worked out that material
for building is in some cases beginning to run short. It must be
remembered that wood, not brick or stone, is the chief building
material of all Australasia outside the towns, and that this
creates an enormous and constant demand. Papua&mdash;at one point
only ninety miles from the Australian continent&mdash;is in an
excellent position to satisfy this demand. At the present moment,
however, sawn timber is actually being imported into Papua from
Australia at very high prices for building purposes, because as yet
the local supply cannot be got at. Without sawmills, the immense
virgin forests arc as useless as so much grass, although they lie
right along the course of all the great rivers, in many cases so
close up that the timber-getter has nothing to do but cut his trees
and let them drop into the stream, where they will be floated to
the sea.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust29" id="illust29"></a><img src=
"1501051h-images/TNNG-29.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=
"Illustration">
</p>

<p>This curious condition of affairs&mdash;a country rich in timber
buying it at a high price from a country which is beginning to run
short&mdash;cannot in the nature of things last much longer. There
are several fortunes waiting for the people who first bring about a
change. In the present quickly developing state of the country all
the sawn timber available will be taken up by local needs for a
good while to come; but there are still greater possibilities in
the future, when the huge forests are really opened up and Papua
becomes, as it undoubtedly will, the chief source of supply, for
the paving, carpentering, and paper-making needs of the
Australasian world.</p>

<p>The gold mines of Papua have had much to do with the history of
the colony. It is an open question whether Papua owes them more of
good or of ill. On the one side, it may be said that the miners and
prospectors drew attention to the country, that they have done a
great deal of valuable exploring work, and that they provide the
greater part of the revenues. On the other must be set the count
that the enormous death-rate on the fields in the days of the early
rushes&mdash;a death-rate not by any means all due to climatic
influences&mdash;gave the country a bad name, from which it has not
even yet recovered. If Papua has been, and is, described as "The
White Man's Grave "&mdash;if insurance companies fight shy of it
and Government clerks going to take up a place in the Port Moresby
offices are seen off by weeping friends who count them as good as
dead&mdash;it is very largely due to the horrors of the early
mining days. In the eighties and nineties men died like flies in
the steaming forests of Woodlark and up the wild, inaccessible
rivers of the mainland, hunting for the gold that could not bring
them a minute's longer life once the fever fiend had laid good hold
of their enfeebled bodies.</p>

<p>Want of proper food, absence of decent lodging, neglect of
precautions against chill, against mosquitoes, against sun and
rain, had quite as much to do with the terrible mortality among the
early miners as the fevers themselves. The general public, however,
did not discriminate, and the tale of horror that came down from
the Yodda, the Mambaré, and other well-known fields were applied
equally to Port Moresby, where white people enjoy excellent health,
or to Samarai, from which fever has been completely weeded out.</p>

<p>Health on the goldfields is now quite satisfactory. Fever, it is
truc, is not unknown, but it is not of a bad type, and will
probably disappear when the food supply is improved.</p>

<p>But the effect of the early death-rate will hamper the country
for many a long day yet. The public is loth to relinquish its
horrors, and a New Guinea where sensational and startling fevers do
not carry off half the population every year seems flat and
uninteresting compared with the lurid country of the stay-at-home
imagination.</p>

<p>The mining interest is to the full as important as the planter
interest at the time of writing. Papua is a country exceedingly
rich in valuable minerals. Gold has been sought, and successfully,
for more than twenty years. Copper exists in large and paying
fields. Other minerals are known to exist, but have not been
prospected for. Coal has lately been discovered. The mining
industry, however, is severely handicapped by want of capital. All
the gold hitherto found on the mainland is alluvial; reef gold is
known to exist, but prospecting is costly work in a country of
extremely rugged conformation covered with dense forest. At all the
mining centres one hears the same story&mdash;excellent
possibilities, but not money enough to attain them. The beds of
some of the rivers are known to contain gold in large quantities,
but the strong currents and numerous rapids have prevented any
attempts at dredging, which is at best a costly process. Gold has
been taken in moderate quantities from Woodlark Island for many
years, and of late a small company has done some reef mining. There
remains a rich underlying bed, which is, however, too deep to get
at without serious expenditure, and no one seems anxious to expend.
New Guinea is too far away; it has a bad reputation; there are
plenty of established and well-paying mines in Australia. So the
capitalist says. In the meantime the gold lies there ungetable.</p>

<p>There were 162 white miners in the country during 1907-8,
employing over a thousand native labourers (in Papua the miner does
not do his own digging, but employs a number of indentured "boys").
The value of gold cleared was only about £52,000, but there is good
reason to think that at least as much again was actually obtained.
This sum was of course very irregularly distributed, some men
making a great deal, and others again very little. Mining in Papua
is rather a costly business. The best paying fields are for the
most part many days' journey into the interior, and the interior
cannot be reached without a train of carriers, an outfit of tents
and camping apparatus, and a supply of food enough for a good many
people during the march out and back. Much of the loss of life
among the old prospectors was due to the fact that they insisted on
treating New Guinea like Australia, and started out up the deadly
Mambaré River or into the Louisiade bush with scarce any outfit
beyond the traditional swag and billycan.</p>

<p>All said, however, the miners continue to make a fair living out
of their occupation, and many of them believe that it can only be a
question of time until rich discoveries are made. A gold rush to
Papua is no new thing, but the next (so the miners say) will be
better justified than those of 1889 and 1896.</p>

<p>The reports of the copper fields are, of course, "very
encouraging," after the manner of mining reports all the world
over. There is, however, solid fact at the back of the
encouragement. Not to trouble the non-mining reader with
technicalities, it may be briefly said that the copper in Papua is
of a quality that pays excellently in Australia, but that does not
pay in the country for want of smelting plant. No matter how rich
your ore may be, it is scarcely a profitable business to ship it at
high rates of freight to another country and pay someone else a
good deal to extract the metal when the whole operation could and
should be done at the mouth of the mine. By the time these lines
are in print, however, it is probable that the want will have been
remedied.</p>

<p>The copper fields are within a few miles of Port Moresby, upon
the one good road which the country boasts. Many claims have been
taken up, mostly by people who cannot afford to work them, but a
good deal more remains to be found and taken possession of in the
surrounding country. A curious and certainly an easy method of
prospecting has been employed by one or two residents of the
country. The Papuan native, like most savages, is very observant,
even of things that he does not understand. If you give him a lump
of copper ore and promise him a pound of stick tobacco for any more
that he can pick up about the hills or in the bush, he will find
copper for you, should there be any within tramping distance of
where he lives. Some of the Port Moresby natives, who have keen
trading and moneymaking instincts, have in this way learned to
prospect for themselves, and more than one native has made a good
deal out of his mining rights by selling them to white
speculators.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust30" id="illust30"></a><img src=
"1501051h-images/TNNG-30.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=
"Illustration">
</p>

<p>Take it all in all, the mineral wealth of Papua is enough to
furnish very good opportunities of moneymaking to any man with a
thousand or two to spend, but it is more immediately profitable and
safer to develop existing discoveries than to go prospecting after
new ones. This is not likely to deter the man who loves change,
chance, and adventure from going gold-hunting. The possible prizes
of the gold-hunter are great, and of adventure and discovery he
will have enough to satisfy Marco Polo himself. There is not a
miner in the country who cannot tell you of a gold-bearing district
that is still unprospected&mdash;perhaps actually unvisited, its
auriferous qualities being guessed by the appearance of the
surrounding country. The Government, which has rather more than
enough to do with its small income as things are, yet manages to
squeeze out a few hundreds occasionally for prospecting work and to
keep a reward standing of 76 woo for the discovery of a new field.
To go and hunt up possible goldfields in Papua costs anything from
upwards after landing at Port Moresby or Samarai. Experienced
prospectors, wise in everything but the art of keeping their gold
when they find it, are always ready to guide a trip of the kind.
Prospecting and exploring are inextricably mixed up in Papua; the
gold-seeker is sure to find a new tribe or two, a mountain that
nobody has seen, a branch or source of some great river&mdash;one
cannot say what the surprises of the interior may be. As a rule,
the prospector passes these things over with simple contempt. He
has no use for them&mdash;you cannot eat a mountain range if your
boys arc short of food, and rivers that deposit no gold upon their
shores are mere nuisances...When one thinks of the medals and the
fellowships and the lectures and the interviews claimed and given
by men who have followed up a new bit of an old river through a
valley that not quite everyone knows, or climbed an unknown
inferior peak of a mountain whose main crest has been worn by the
feet of travellers for generations, one wonders at the modesty of
many of these miner-explorers. Nothing stops them in the search for
gold. There is a perpendicular cliff 300 feet high, shutting in the
end of a river valley in the far interior, which is garlanded to
this day with the decaying vestiges of a ladder made of wild vines
and lawyer cane, put up by a hardy band of pioneers who wanted to
get to the end of the valley and did not see why a trifle of that
kind should prevent them. It is on record that the ladder remained
in its place for a long time, being used <i>as a road</i> by miners
travelling to and fro, and that a certain prospector, travelling
thither from easier countries, was exceedingly grieved when he saw
it, insomuch that he turned back and went home again, declaring
that a place where they called that thing "a road" was no place for
him.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>So much, then, for the money-making possibilities of Papua. If
some of my readers have found this chapter a little dry I do not
apologize to them, since it is open to every man to skip what he
does not care for. Others, I know, will have read it with interest,
for the pioneering spirit yet runs strong in the English race, and
keys to open the doors to a wider and freer life than that of our
own safe and comfortable little islands are eagerly sought by
many.</p>

<p>IN Papua, when you see two or three residents talking together,
you may safely guess that one of three subjects occupies their
attention&mdash;crocodiles, sorcery, or the <i>Merrie
England.</i></p>

<p>I do not know why one talks so much about crocodiles. The number
of white men known to have been taken by them could be counted on
the fingers of one hand. They are very seldom seen, although there
the waters of rivers and seas alike are infested with them. They do
not damage the crops, and seldom eat a labourer. Nevertheless the
interest taken by the white resident of Papua in the crocodile is
little short of passionate. In the absence of daily papers, the
latest crocodile gossip is retailed from mouth to mouth, and the
movements of any well-known specimen are canvassed like those of
British royalty. The twenty-footer that came ashore at two in the
morning under the houses of Hanuabada village, glittering with
green phosphorescence, and grabbed a native dog; the monster that
was seen tearing a dead mule to pieces in the shallow of the swamp
by the shooting butts; even the black oily streak that was seen
crossing the bay yesterday morning, are discussed with every
variety of detail. A crocodile is seen in the distance, out at sea,
swimming along with a pig in its jaws, and the whole of the capital
musters on the jetty, rifle in hand, as though the safety of their
verandahs and homes (one does not have hearths in Papua) trembled
in the balance. The crocodile is fired at a dozen times and very
much frightened, drops its well-earned dinner, and dives below.
Half a dozen amateur Tells claim the credit of the deed; the dead
and mangled pig comes ashore in the afternoon of the next day,
rather "high," and the armed native constabulary banquet upon
it...The incident provides gossip for a week.</p>

<p>If crocodiles are not the subject of conversation, the latest
cases of sorcery no doubt occupy the field. Sorcery is in the very
air of Papua. Your cook-boy will probably explain an unauthorised
absence by the excuse that the sorcerer who lives next door put a
spell on him so that he could not go out of the house. The little
brown lady in a brief frilled skirt and nothing else who does your
washing will tell you quite calmly, when you ask how she came by a
deformed shin-bone, that she met a "spilit stop long bush"
(apparition walking in the forest), whom she judged to be a
disembodied sorcerer of great power, since his mere look at her
bent her leg almost in two...and there is the leg to prove it. The
highly intelligent mission-trained youth who "does out the rooms"
in your friend's bungalow will give notice and retreat to his palm
shanty in the bush because his master showed him a conjuring trick
of the six-ina-box-for-a-shilling kind, and he is quite certain
that the Taubada (chief) was practising sorcery on him. It is not
by any means a joke, this question of sorcery. The Government
recognises it as a crime, and punishes it by a long term of
imprisonment justly, too, since the sorcerer is almost always a
murderer as well, and the practice of sorcery, with its attendant
petty tyrannies, cruelties, and extortion, does more than anything
else to keep the native in a state of savagery.</p>

<p>The Psychical Research Society would have its hands full in
Papua. Nearly all the well-known though rare phenomena which
exercise the attention of the members in England flourish in wild
luxuriance among the Papuans. Spirit-rapping, as I have already
said, is common both among the Purari tribes and elsewhere. Ghosts
are constantly seen, being variously described as men, as
indefinite "debil-debils," and as white or blue lights hovering
above the surface of the ground. The sorcerers claim power to raise
the dead, and the natives are quite convinced that they do. In
connection with this it may be interesting to give an
illustration.</p>

<p>I had been some weeks in Port Moresby, and was anxious if
possible to see something of the sorcerers' powers. Two retired
practitioners of wide reputation were induced to come up on to the
verandah of the house where I was staying and give an exhibition of
their feats, being first assured that the Government had granted
leave. They said that they would kill something and bring it to
life again&mdash;a dog or a cat, or anything I wished.</p>

<p>I suggested a lizard, knowing the cruel nature of the Papuan,
and judging that they were less likely to mis-handle an insensitive
cold-blooded reptile than a lively dog. The sorcerers&mdash;two
middle-aged men with dark sly faces&mdash;disappeared among the
cookhouse buildings at the back, and returned with a small lizard,
recently killed, and still warm. It seemed to have been put an end
to by a blow, as it was not outwardly injured. The sorcerers
squatted down on the floor with the lizard lying between them, and
began stroking it with their finger-tips, much as if they were
trying to mesmerise it. They continued doing this for some time,
muttering to themselves and breathing hard. At the end of a few
minutes they sat up and declared the charm would not work. It was
not their fault, they said&mdash;they had not done any sorcery for
a long time, and were out of training. To be sure of success they
should have trained for a week at least.</p>

<p>How did they train? I asked.</p>

<p>They practised various ceremonies, it seemed, and they ate a
great deal of wild ginger. There was nothing like ginger for giving
you magic powers.</p>

<p>The cook-boy said that this was undeniably true, for if you tied
ginger on your gun when going out to shoot wallaby or alligators,
it was much more likely to shoot straight. Also, when they wanted
to make their dogs run very fast they put ginger down the animals'
throats.</p>

<p>The connection between cause and effect here did not seem to
require magic to help it out; however, I let it pass without
comment, as I wanted to hear some more. But the cook-boy had a
roast of kangaroo to attend to, so he went away, as the amusement
of the morning seemed over.</p>

<p>The sorcerers gathered themselves up, accepted a gift of
tobacco, and went off to the village. It seemed as if the
experiment had been a complete failure, and yet&mdash;</p>

<p>And yet&mdash;I remembered that the two old villains looked
genuinely and unmistakably disappointed when the lizard did not
revive. Nothing was clearer than the fact that they thought it
would. I did not suppose that the Papuan sorcerer possessed any
power over the mysteries of life and death, still&mdash;</p>

<p>What about anaesthetics? The tale of the man who was killed and
brought to life again by the local sorcerer is one of the commonest
"yarns" of a New Guinea village. In nineteen cases out of twenty it
is probably untrue. There may be something in the twentieth, and
that something may be the use of a native anaesthetic, not known to
the people in general.</p>

<p>In any case, the incident added to the material available for
the three subjects of local conversation. And this brings me to the
third&mdash;the <i>Merrie England.</i></p>

<p>If no one is discussing alligator gossip or retailing spicy bits
of sorcery, the Government steam yacht is sure to be the subject of
conversation. The regular mail boats, which come up from Australia
at intervals of about three weeks, do not furnish much food for
talk, as everyone knows just what they are going to do. But the
<i>Merrie England</i> may go anywhere and do anything. She runs
down the coast to punish a cannibal raid in the "Wild West"; she
goes to chase a Jap schooner that has been poaching about the pearl
fisheries; she takes stores to a far-out station, or lays buoys
along a dangerous passage in the coral reef near a port, or runs
suddenly south to Thursday Island with despatches, or brings a
party of explorers to their "jumping-off place" and bids them good
luck and good-bye. She is a man-of-war, a passenger steamer, a
cargo tramp, a Court of Justice, and a Government House. Trials are
held in her saloon, meetings of the Legislative
Council&mdash;Papua's Parliament&mdash;take place there; the
Governor and his modest suite of two private secretaries, six
native boatmen, and a couple of Papuan valets spend more time on
the yacht than in the house with the Union Jack flying above,
outside Port Moresby. The <i>Merrie England</i> carries mails,
brings news, transfers officials, and incidentally gives everyone
something to talk about most of the time&mdash;an incalculable boon
in an isolated colony with mails three weeks apart.</p>

<p>She is a handsome little ship, some 190 tons register, built
originally as a sailing yacht and later converted to a steamer. She
has been twenty years at work about the Territory, but is still
going well. It was inevitable that I should make her acquaintance
sooner or later, and indeed it was not many weeks after my arrival
that I found myself in one of her pretty gilded and looking-glassed
cabins, bound on a long trip West.</p>

<p>Part of that trip has already been told. It was from the
<i>Merrie England</i> that I went up the Purari delta to study the
labour question. After our return she went on down the coast,
across the Gulf of Papua, to Daru.</p>

<p>Daru, the port of entry and seat of Government for the Western
Division, is not an interesting place in itself. At high tide it is
a jetty, a handful of mangroves, a grass street, and half a dozen
tin bungalows. At low tide (and in defiance of all the rules of
physical geography tides seem to be oftener out than in at Daru) it
is a black swamp emblazoned with crabs and weeds, the town an
indefinite addendum somewhere in the distance. I have heard Daru
called pretty, but it is a poisonous-looking prettiness at
best&mdash;flaming toadstool-coloured croton bushes in rows, grass
and bush much too green, soil too black, sun too brilliant for
anything with a hide inferior in resistant qualities to that of a
basking alligator. Daru is not healthy, and not unhealthy. There is
some malaria there, but nothing like so much as one might expect
from the surroundings. Indeed, all over the western and gulf
districts Papua gives the lie to quite a number of theories of
hygiene. Bevan, the explorer of the eighties, long ago noticed with
astonishment the excellent health and fine physique of the delta
tribes, who live literally in a sea of rotting swamp, where, by all
the laws of ordinary hygienic science, they ought merely to
die.</p>

<p>It is the surroundings of Daru that lend the little town any
interest it possesses. In the first place, it is situated on an
islet at the mouth of the Fly, and the Fly is one of the largest
and most important rivers in the world. Like every other Papuan
river, it is known only for a certain distance. In this case the
sphere of the explorer extends over Soo miles, but no one knows
where the stream rises, and the upper reaches, though navigable to
steamers of a good size, are very seldom visited.</p>

<p>There is no white settlement along the Fly. Land there is in
plenty, lying a very little way back from the river, and not
apparently used by the natives, except in certain districts, where
the great extent and regularity of the Papuans banana groves has
excited the admiration of all the travellers&mdash;they are not
many&mdash;who have visited the great river. Sugar country is found
along the Fly inferior to none in the world. There is open grass
country a few miles beyond the banks in many districts. The river
provides a matchless water-way for the conveyance of produce to
market, and the lower part of the estuary is within a day's steam
of Australia. Still, for all that no one expects to sec the Fly
country settled yet. It is too far away.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust31" id="illust31"></a><img src=

</p>

<p>There are no white people at all in the huge Western Division,
save two Government officials and half a dozen traders and
missionaries. The country has an ill reputation, scarcely correct
as regards health, but as regards the natives something truer. You
are not in the comfortable plantation country, with its mail
steamers and its known and mapped divisions, and its useful,
tractable natives, when you get into the Wild West. This is Papua
very much in the rough, as yet.</p>

<p>No one can doubt, all the same, that this mighty river will be a
highway of traffic some day. We did not visit it in the <i>Merrie
England.</i> We did not even see it, though we were lying in its
estuary a night and a day&mdash;for the estuary is over eighty
miles wide, and you are quite out of sight of the shore, anchored
in the midst of this great river mouth. But you can infer the
nearness of the Fly when you look at the yellow flood of fresh
water on which the steamer is floating, and you are not surprised
to hear, amazing though it seems, that the Fly River pours forth
every twenty-four hours into the Gulf of Papua enough water to give
every man, woman, and child in the world an allowance of sixty
gallons twice over, sixty gallons being the accepted standard in
places where water is plentiful.</p>

<p>From Daru and the West we ran over to Thursday Island&mdash;only
eighteen hours, even at the seven-knot pace of the leisurely
<i>Merrie England</i>&mdash;and found ourselves once more in
Australian territory.</p>

<p>If you wish to find Thursday Island on the map, you must follow
the huge peninsula of North Queensland with your eye right to the
end, and mark down a tiny speck lying close to the edge, among the
big islands of Torres Straits&mdash;Mulgrave, Banks, Prince of
Wales, and Horn. Thursday lies close to Prince of Wales' Island,
and is almost dwarfed out of sight by its neighbour, but it is much
the more important place, all the same. All the big islands are
almost uninhabited; little Thursday, however, has a town and a
barracks and a fort and quite a number of calling steamers. It is
the centre of the great pearling industry of North Queensland, and
keeps a good-sized fleet of pearlers constantly at work.</p>

<p>The place looked like nothing in the world so much as a small,
bright, painted view inside a glass paperweight when we came up to
it in the full morning light. The clear air cast a crystalline
sparkle over the green central hill, and the red and white town
climbing up its slopes, and the fiery blue sky and flat blue sea.
Thin black masts of sloops and schooners stood out like sharp
pen-strokes against the hill and the town in rows as thick as
rushes. The fleet was laid up in the harbour, for there was a
strike on among the lessees of the boats, and no one was going out
to dive. Li consequence we saw practically nothing of the chief
industry of Thursday Island. We could not, indeed, have come at a
worse time.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust32" id="illust32"></a><img src=
"1501051h-images/TNNG-32.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=

</p>

<p>The <i>Merrie England,</i> however, had come over on Government
business, and did not concern herself about the doings of the
fleet. While her officials were busy in the saloon with mails I
went for a walk about the town and saw what was to be seen.</p>

<p>It was a most bewildering place. If I had not known I was in
Australian territory, I should certainly have thought that the
<i>Merrie England</i> had made a mistake and landed me somewhere in
Japan. Japanese were the yellow-faced, under-sized men in
ill-fitting slop-made suits who passed up and down the pretty
boulevarded streets. Japanese were the women in kimono and obi,
with puffed and oiled black hair, who sat on the verandahs of the
rickety tin-roofed houses or walked in and out of the shops with
their quaint little slant-eyed children buying groceries and
prints. Japanese were the shops themselves, full of sandals and
crapes and silks for the most part, with a few inferior and costly
European goods thrown in, the whole presided over by a yellow
little man in an unbecoming black suit&mdash;unless by chance the
shopkeeper was a tall Chinese in a blouse, with a thin pigtail
hanging down his back. Of the celebrated courtesy and grace of
Japan the Thursday Island Jap emigrant knows nothing. He has taken
up the footpath in groups of threes and fours, and it goes hard but
he will make you turn off into the mud for him if he can. He is not
too anxious to serve you if you patronise his shop (with one
exception&mdash;a very smart and businesslike little yellow
heathen, who appears to have most of the European custom in his
hands, and deserves it), but gives you to understand as clearly as
he can that he is conferring a favour on you in accepting your
money. He is superior to the white in numbers, as there are about
two thousand Japanese and Chinese in the little Island, and only
seven hundred Europeans or Australians. The truth is&mdash;and it
is not a pleasant truth for Australia&mdash;that Thursday Island
practically belongs to Japan. The pearling trade has gradually
slipped into Japanese hands, and practically all the boats at the
time of my visit were owned directly or indirectly by Japanese. The
costliness of white labour is supposed to be the chief reason.
Whatever the cause may be, the fact is regrettable, for the pearl
and the shell of Thursday Island, even in these days of diminished
takings, are worth very many thousands a year. Twenty-three
thousand pounds is the average value of the pearls alone, and they
are much the least part of the profit, the shell&mdash;which sells
at any price you like to mention from £50 to £200 a ton&mdash;being
the chief stand-by of the trade.</p>

<p>As it was impossible to see the pearling fleet at work, I was
constrained to do the next best thing&mdash;take a trip on a sloop
owned (for once) by a white man and see how the diving was done.
Mr. and Mrs. F&mdash;&mdash;, residents of Thursday Island, very
kindly offered to take me for the trip, and further pressed upon me
the loan of a diving dress to go down and see for myself what the
bottom of the sea looked like.</p>

<p>I wanted very much to go down over the pearling grounds, but my
hosts assured me that this was impossible. They are pearling now at
Thursday Island in a very great depth of water, the shallower
places having been fished out, and even experienced divers find the
pressure of a hundred feet and more most trying. It would scarcely
be safe, I was told; and as to another diver going down to ensure
against accident, that was the very way to bring them about:
life-lines and air-tubes got tangled, the pumps were easier to
manage for one than two&mdash;in fine, I had better go down in
shallower water, and I should find it best to go by myself.</p>

<p>So it was agreed; and the little sloop was towed out a mile or
two beyond the town to a spot only a few fathoms deep, where it was
agreed that I might safely make my diving debut.</p>

<p>Now, Torres Straits, as everyone in Queensland knows, is full of
sharks, common and tiger, and also of alligators, devil-fish,
sting-ray, and various other unpleasant creatures. I could not help
thinking about them a little as we cast anchor over the selected
place and began to prepare the diving gear. It is considered rather
bad form and rather silly to make a fuss about sharks and
alligators in the countries where they abound; still, I ventured a
timid inquiry.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," I was told; "the alligators don't take
this track crossing the Straits; and as for the sharks, accidents
are very uncommon&mdash;very uncommon; besides, this is not a
likely place. If by any chance you should see a shark, don't be the
least alarmed; just pull up the cuff of your jumper a little so as
to let out a few bubbles of air, and he'll be frightened off. Don't
pull the cord till he is well away; you're all right on the bottom,
but they have been known to make a grab at a man when he was being
pulled up&mdash;as they do at a fish on your line, you
know&mdash;and bite his boots off. I don't suppose for a minute
you'll see one, however."</p>

<p>All this was so businesslike and so thoughtful, and the men were
so kindly and carefully preparing the pumps and looking to the
tubes and putting the ladder in the easiest place for me to get
over, that it was impossible to be scared, so of course I was not.
I did not feel like myself&mdash;like someone else, rather, whom I
had only recently met and did not care for&mdash;but I was not
scared. I thought a good deal about a French model dress and hat I
had been tempted into buying in Melbourne, and wished I had been
less chary of wearing it, because now...But I was not scared. I
wished I had told the captain of the <i>Merrie England</i> about
the piece I had burned out of one of his inestimable varnished
floors, and asked him not to grieve for it, or me, or
something&mdash;it seemed a little involved, but I was not
scared...I reflected...</p>

<p>"Now, if you'll come down into the cabin, I'll help you into
your dress," said my hostess cheerily. And I went, because I was
not at all frightened.</p>

<p>Mrs. F&mdash;&mdash; is a tall, powerfully-built Australian,
with muscles equal to a man's. It takes two people, as a rule, to
get another into a diving dress, but she managed to push and punch
and kick me into mine unaided&mdash;no mean feat of athletics, as
anyone who has ever seen a diver's toilet will understand.</p>

<p>First of all came a jersey and tights of white wool nearly half
an inch thick. I got into these without difficulty, as they were
large and loose, but the heat in that torrid atmosphere made me
fairly gasp. I was assured, however, that the warm clothing was
very necessary down under water if one wanted to avoid chills.</p>

<p>Then came the real difficulty. The diving suit itself&mdash;an
all-over garment, with legs, feet, and sleeves all made of stiff
thick rubber-cloth&mdash;was produced, and I was told I had to
crawl in feet foremost through the neck!</p>

<p>It was done at last, an inch at a time, with pauses for rest,
and two panting creatures climbed out on deck, one in a cool white
dress and hat, the other in a shapeless shambling sort of costume
that made her look like a toad with a tendency to apoplexy.</p>

<p>I sat down on the hatch, and two "tenders," as they were called
(men who look after the diving gear), completed my toilet. They
took a pair of rubber-cloth boots with lead soles that weighed
twenty pounds each and put them on my feet. They got a wrench,
pulled up the metal yoke of my dress tight round my neck, and
screwed me into it by means of nuts. Then they brought a mass of
copper and iron that seemed a fair load for a horse and clapped it
over my head. This was the helmet. The glasses were not yet screwed
on, so I could look out of the windows and wonder what was going to
happen next, and how I was ever going to move a limb encased in all
that panoply of metal. I felt a sympathy I had never known
before&mdash;for the knights of mediaeval days cased in unyielding
steel, for a lonely lobster prisoned in its carapace, for birds
shut up in hard, uncomfortable eggshells, for everything that was
screwed tight into something and couldn't get out. Meanwhile the
tenders went on tending. They took the big end of the wrench and
more nuts and screwed my helmet down on to the metal yoke, hauling
on their tools and pressing the nuts home as if they were never to
be loosened any more. Then they let go and told me to try and
walk.</p>

<p>I got up, feeling like a fly that had fallen into a
treacle-dish, and slowly dragged one heavy foot after another, six
steps a minute across the deck. This created much satisfaction. The
diving dress is constructed on the principle of giving you just as
much weight as you can support, and sometimes a weak diver finds it
too much and cannot move in the costume at all.</p>

<p>All the same, I had to crawl very slowly to the bulwarks, where
the industrious tenders had hung the ladder, and I was glad to hear
that the necklace of lead weights, weighing forty pounds, which I
had already been eyeing uncomfortably, was not to be put on till
the last moment.</p>

<p>My host was busy with the air-pump, looking over the length of
rubber tubing carefully, seeing that the machinery was in good
order, and assuring me&mdash;rather too emphatically, I
thought&mdash;that he meant to take charge of the pump himself and
let the tenders merely watch the line. I did not know how grateful
I ought to have been, but I learned all about that later on.
Three-fourths of the accidents that put an end to divers occur
through carelessness on the part of the man at the pump. When the
diver is below, a tender is deputed to keep the life-line and
air-tube clear and make sure that all signals are instantly seen.
It is a serious business this diving, and nobody treats it like
play.</p>

<p>The use of the line and valves was explained to me. The rope
fastened round my waist was meant to let me down and haul me up.
The smaller line, fastened to my helmet and dropping in front, was
to be kept in my hand. There were a lot of signals one could make
with it, but I had better not try to learn them, they would only
confuse me. I could recollect that a good pull on this line meant
"I want to come up"&mdash;that was all that was necessary. As for
the valve, it was turned one way to increase the air supply,
another to lessen it. Now, was I ready to get over the side?</p>

<p>I repeat that I was not afraid. Is it being afraid to wish
oneself in bed at home with the blankets pulled up over one's ears
and the door locked? Is it being afraid to call oneself a fool,
softly and silently, and say that never, never again...? Is it
being afraid if one think suddenly and strangely of dentists'
waiting-rooms and the horrible nod that beckons you forth from your
uneasy seat and the dread command to "open a little wider?"
Certainly not.</p>

<p>They lifted my feet for me and put them down singly on the
ladder. They helped me a step or two down into the water. They took
that horrible lead necklace and laid it gently, almost caressingly,
round my copper and iron neck. And then they said "Good-bye," and
put the glass window in, and screwed down the coffin&mdash;I mean
the helmet. Their faces were faint through the glass, but they
smiled and signalled (for I could hear no longer), and I knew that
they were asking "Are you ready?"</p>

<p>It is at this point that the novice usually clutches hold of the
rail and insists on being taken back. It was at this point that my
fiction broke up, and I realised that I was extremely afraid. The
sober truth, I think, is that a woman always is afraid of doing
dangerous things. Generally she lies about it, partly through
conceit, and largely because she is curious and does not mind being
horribly afraid if you will give her what she wants. But the truth
is as I have said. The cold courage of the male&mdash;the Nelson
courage that "never saw fear "&mdash;is not in any woman who ever
was born. We take our risks as the Botany Bay convict took his
walks&mdash;with a shrinking brute irrevocably chained to our side,
dragging it wherever we go.</p>

<p>The brute disliked that dive. It hated the plunge to the
bottom&mdash;scarcely thirty feet, but it might have been a
thousand&mdash;that followed when I carefully slid those gigantic
boots off the ladder. It was disgusted when I landed&mdash;as all
beginners do&mdash;on my head, and had to struggle to get right. It
told me that my hands were bare and that sharks could nip them off,
and that I had no knife as a diver should have, and that there
might be "something" in every black cavern of the dead coral over
which I found myself walking. But it got interested in the
surroundings by and by and forgot to nag.</p>

<p>After all, it was worth some trouble and discomfort to find
oneself walking on the bottom of Torres Straits, down where the
divers had been at work a year or two ago, seeing just what they
saw when they went out for their day's strange labour, all but the
pearl-shell, which had of course been taken away. The water chanced
not to be very clear, and the bottom was so weedy that one was
simply walking in a green garden of weeds half-way up to the knee.
But there was a little coral to be seen, pearly white among the
weeds (it was dead coral&mdash;a living bed is a veritable
flower-garden of vivid colours), and the light that came down from
above, dim and green and softly diffused, showed the surroundings
plainly enough.</p>

<p>It is a strange sensation this "walking alone in the depths of
the sea," and one that I think no one could describe adequately. To
get away from the laws of gravity as you have known them all your
life is in itself a somewhat disorganising experience. And the laws
of gravity do not act at the bottom of the seas as they do on land.
All that weight of lead and iron that you bore so painfully up on
deck barely suffices down here to keep you on the ground. You walk
with strange, soft, striding steps; your arms and legs obey your
will, but slowly and after consideration. Everything is
muffled&mdash;your movements, your breath, your sight, your
hearing. You do not feel awake; you are not sure that you are
alive. The pump beats in your ears like a huge pulse, but you feel
it rather than hear it. You are conscious that your nose and ears
are hurting you, and that your lungs do not feel as they ought, but
it seems somebody else's pain rather than yours. Fish swim past
you, green and grey in the green water. You realise with something
of a shock that they are not afraid of you. On the deck of the
sloop, the mere shadow of your hand would send them flying as they
glide past the ship's counter, but here in the depths of the sea
they fin their slow way up to the very windows of your helmet, and
look in at you with their cold glassy eyes, unafraid. You stretch
out a hand to grasp them, and they avoid it quietly and without
haste. You look ahead through the darkling water for the swoop and
rush and horrible scythe-shaped tail of the monster that you fear,
but there is no sign of it...Still&mdash;you have been down some
minutes now, and honour is amply satisfied. It would be very
pleasant to see the light of day again...You stoop down, slowly and
"disposedly," as one moves under water, and gather up a bit of weed
and a fragment of coral for a souvenir; and then you pull the
cord.</p>

<p>No sensation of movement follows, and for a moment your heart
stands still. Has the tender forgotten to tend after all?...But in
another second you notice that the air bubbles are rushing in a
long stream past the windows of your prison, and you realise that
you must be going although you do not feel it...The rungs of the
ladder appear, glide downwards, vanish. The light suddenly
brightens&mdash;you are up!</p>

<p>It is easy to catch the bulwark and stand on the top of the
ladder while the tender unscrews your helmet-glass. And the
sweetness of that first rush of warm tropic air breaking upon your
cold, perspiring face and going in a grateful rush right down your
swollen lungs is a thing to be thankful for evermore. The
undressing is full as trying a job as the dressing; as you were
squeezed and pounded into the costume, so you have to be dragged
and pinched out of it when the tenders have done unscrewing the
endless nuts and have taken off the leaden jewellery and removed
the mighty boots. But you are so glad to be out again and alive
again that you do not care.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>It was interesting to hear during our short stay at Thursday
Island that the shell was by no means so completely fished out as
reports of the day had declared. True, most of the good shell is
now at the bottom of those depths of two hundred feet and more into
which no diver can venture, but it is not all out of reach. Enough
shallow water shell remains to keep a good-sized fleet at work. If
we had only been there sooner or later, we could have gone out and
seen the divers working; but this pleasure was denied us.</p>

<p>Instead, one had to content oneself with the pearling gossip
that floated about every verandah universal as tobacco-smoke. Home
people are apt to think that the chief interest of a
pearling-station lies in the pearls; but this is not the case at
all. Pearls are regarded as an extra something that you cannot rely
on; you may get them, and you may not; but in any case the shell is
there, and your divers cannot steal that. Many boats are let to
Japanese, who are allowed to take all the pearls that are found and
sell the shell to the owners of the boat at £80 a ton. The price of
this commodity varies a great deal, as it is chiefly used for
articles of dress and fancy goods, which are constantly affected by
fashion. Still, the £80 leaves a large profit.</p>

<p>The pearls are mostly bought by dealers in Thursday Island.
Pearl-doctoring is thoroughly understood and constantly done by the
buyers. It is not in any way an illegitimate process, any more than
is the cutting and polishing of a gem. Pearls arc sometimes skinned
to give them a finer lustre; the irregular formation known among
jewellers as "baroque" pearl is occasionally trimmed into useful
shapes, and "blister" pearls are sometimes destroyed on the chance
of finding something better inside. Indeed, the blister pearl is
quite a fascinating form of speculation. It is generally
unattractive to look at&mdash;a flattish, irregular mass that can
only be set in some fanciful way for a cheap pendant or
brooch&mdash;and one has little compunction in sacrificing this
form of gem. But sometimes it is good-looking enough,
well-coloured, and worth a fair sum; and then the question arises,
Is it worth while to cut the pearl up or not? If the answer is in
the affirmative, the buyer carefully chisels off the outer skin,
goes a little deeper, and finds&mdash;perhaps an empty blister
worth nothing at all now, perhaps a beautiful, large, regular
pearl, loose inside or lightly attached to the walls of the
covering formation. Some of the finest pearls ever sent out of
Thursday Island have been discovered in this way. How many ladies,
one wonders, are carrying about gems worth hundreds of pounds,
unknown and unsuspected, inside the irregular shell of the cheap
"baroque" pearl that makes up their "new art" necklace pendant?</p>

<p>We had only a flying visit to Thursday Island, for there was
work for the <i>Merrie England</i> to do all along the coast, and
time was flying. The second day found the Government yacht under
steam again, gliding northward to Papua through the bright green
coral islets of Torres Straits. We were bound now for no less a
place than Goari-Bari&mdash;the scene of Chalmers' murder in 1901,
and of the much-discussed fight in the year 1904 that led to the
suicide of the Chief Justice.</p>

<p>There had been no call at Goari-Bari for two years past, and no
one knew just what frame of mind the natives might be in. Their
reputation has always been one of the worst, and they are as
treacherous as they are cruel and cowardly. The Governor expressed
his intention of making a peaceful call, but it must be allowed
that no one on the ship thought His Excellency's desire very likely
of fulfilment.</p>

<p>We steamed up to the island in the forenoon and cast anchor
about a mile from the village; nearer the <i>Merrie England's</i>
draught would not allow her to go. The famous', or infamous,
Goari-Bari lay right before us&mdash;a long, low, swampy island
near the mouth of a great river (the Aird), with a row of
ill-constructed brown huts showing prominently on the mud of the
foreshore. The sky was yellow-grey, low, and hot, the sea lumpy and
choppy; the wind blew strong, but it had no freshness in it. An
ugly day, an ugly place.</p>

<p>For an hour or two the <i>Merrie England</i> waited, and then,
greatly daring, one or two canoes stole out from the town and
paddled near us. Our interpreter called to them, assuring them of
our friendly intention and displaying calico and tobacco. But for a
considerable time the Goari-Barians hesitated, paddling up and down
excitedly in their canoes, chattering like parrots, shivering with
excitement&mdash;ready at any moment either to grasp the arrows in
the bottoms of the canoes or to turn tail and rush for shore. They
were the ugliest crowd I had yet seen in the country&mdash;naked,
save for a scrap of bark or fibre; lean and ungraceful, their heads
shaved bare to the middle, with a bunch of greasy curls hanging out
behind, their faces painted with red stripes and patches. Feathers
streamed and grass armlets fluttered about their restless persons;
they were jumpy, excitable, and (to use an Americanism) "skeery"
almost beyond belief.</p>

<p>This was my first, but not my last, visit to the Aird River
cannibals, and I had plenty of opportunity later for confirming the
first impressions made by these strange people. In Papua, more
truly than in any other country in the world, it may be said that
nothing happens save the unexpected. But the experience I had
already had of the Country of the Impossible did not prepare me for
the Aird River people. The popular and apparently the reasonable
idea of a cannibal is that he is the fiercest of human beasts,
warlike, fearless, and determined, knowing nothing of nerves,
nothing of feeling&mdash;a creature of iron...</p>

<p>Instead of which, he is the most hysterical, the most nervous,
twittery, jumpy, wire-hung creature that ever existed outside of a
ladies' boarding-school. If you hold out a finger, he starts. If
you speak suddenly, he squeaks. If you look fixedly at him for a
few seconds, he vanishes into the bush so swiftly and silently that
you are half convinced he never was there at all. It is
extraordinarily difficult to take him for what he is really worth,
and to realise that this silly, painted, prancing creature with the
hysterical giggle and the childish manner is actually a dangerous
brute at bottom, and that he would desire nothing better than to
knock you on the head and eat you&mdash;only for that Nordenfeldt
gun on the bridge and the rack of rifles in the pretty little
gilded and brocaded saloon.</p>

<p>All that day we lay at anchor and endeavoured to win the
confidence of the timid and retiring cannibal. The canoes came
thick and fast round the ship by and by, and their occupants were
delighted to receive the gifts handed down over the side&mdash;red
calico, tobacco, common knives&mdash;all inestimable treasures to a
village that knows no traffic with the white districts of Papua,
and does not possess so much as an inch of hoop-iron for making
adzes. With dusk our visitors cleared away, but at night we could
hear loud singing on shore and see the light of fires in the
village. They were evidently excited in the highest degree, and did
not know what to make of our call.</p>

<p>Next morning, while sleeping peacefully in my berth, I was
awakened by a clinking noise, and looked up to see a long, brown,
filthy arm and hand extended through the port, making a snatch at
my water-bottle. I called out angrily, and the arm vanished with
the water-bottle! Looking out through the nearer port I could see a
flotilla of canoes round my cabin, and at least half a hundred
unclean heathen hustling one another for a look in! I got up to
slam the ports and screw them, but while I was fastening one the
lean arm shot in again through the other, grabbed at the satin
curtain, and all but secured it. I think the owner did pull a brass
curtain hook off the rod before I snapped the port. It is a
consolation to know that he just missed leaving a finger-tip as
pledge.</p>

<p>Later, at breakfast, it became manifest that Goari-Bari had made
up its mind to accept our visit as harmless. I should not like to
say how many hundreds of savages were dodging each other in canoes
under the ports of the saloon fighting for places to look in. Every
porthole was a mosaic of ugly-painted faces and bobbing feathers.
One middle-aged person of a cheerful and foolish countenance, whom
we christened Willie (he learned his name almost at once, and
answered to it like a dog), made himself especially prominent, and
stared at the food with so much interest that I was moved to get up
and offer him a tablespoonful of apricot jam. He seized the spoon
promptly, and tried his best, amid shrieks of laughter from the
saloon, to pull it out of my hand. Failing in this, he scooped the
jam out, looked at it, smelt it, rubbed it into his hair, and
vanished.</p>

<p>By and by we went on deck and found the ship in possession of
the heathen, who were scampering and squeaking all over the place,
watched rather sullenly by our dozen of armed native constabulary,
who thought it a hard thing indeed that they were not allowed to
pick off even one of these outer barbarians. The white sailors kept
a good look out on the visitors, for it was clear that these latter
meant to make hay while the sun shone, and were bent on carrying
off anything that was not nailed down. They tried for the brass
stanchions of the gangway, they dragged at the canvas of the deck
chairs, they pulled the belaying pins out of the rack, and were
very loth indeed to put them back. Willie (among the foremost, as
usual) attracted my attention by the extreme dirtiness of his
person, and I brought out a tin basin of water and a piece of soap
and began giving a demonstration in the art of washing one's
hands.</p>

<p>Willie watched it rather nervously at first; it was clear that
he suspected sorcery in the mysterious proceeding. I offered him
the soap by and by, and made signs that he should rub it on his
hands. I shall always honour Willie as the bravest of cannibals.
Convinced as he evidently was that the thing was dangerous, the
spirit of scientific investigation was stronger in his breast than
mere personal fear. He washed his hands.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust33" id="illust33"></a><img src=

"Illustration">
</p>

<p>Then, like the countenance of</p>

<p class="poem">"The watcher of the skies,<br>
When some new planet swims into his ken,"</p>

<p>Willie's face expanded with the joy and awe of discovery. He
looked at the soap. He looked at his hands almost with reverence,
scarcely knowing them for his own. In an instant&mdash;nervousness
and indecision swept away like snow before the sun&mdash;he had
grabbed the basin, let it go after a brief tug-of-war, grabbed the
soap, secured that, and...</p>

<p>Where was Willie? There was a canoe, paddling madly across the
bay, faster and faster, further and further, almost out of sight.
There was a man in it. It was Willie, and he had the soap.</p>

<p>I have not the slightest doubt that the town sat up all night
after we had gone trying the new sensation with shrieks of joy. The
missionary vocation is one that has never descended upon my
unworthy person, but if I was not a missionary for that one
afternoon, and a good one too, then let me never see soap again
till I die.</p>

<p>The boats were ordered out not long after this, and we started
for the town. In the first boat went His Excellency the
Lieutenant-Governor, several armed native constabulary, and an
Australian colonel who was visiting the country. I was allowed to
accompany the party in the second boat, which consisted of two or
three more police, a couple of visiting missionaries, and an
official.</p>

<p>It was almost the first time anyone had made a peaceful visit to
the town, with the exception of the disastrous call that ended in
the death of Chalmers and Tompkins. The Goari-Barians are frankly
at war with society. The position of their town in an inner curve
of the stormy Gulf of Papua, on an island surrounded by shoals and
shallows, has always protected them from sudden attack. Ships keep
away religiously from the Gulf, which has a sinister reputation for
wrecks and strandings; and the great clumsy "lakatois" of the
Papuan native cannot approach the west at all during a good part of
the year. Of willing visitors, therefore, Goari-Bari has had
scarcely any, while of the unwilling visitors who must have been
swept up to the town now and then by the strong currents of the
Gulf, as Chalmers' luckless schooner was swept, none ever returned
to tell the tale. Bits of brass fittings from ships which we saw
while in the town suggested ugly stories that had never come to
light. Heretofore the people of this infamous little place, when
visited, had been either executioners or victims of their visitors.
The peaceful call was new.</p>

</p>

<p>Evidently they did not know what to make of it. When our party
landed on, or rather in, the black mud of the beach and walked up
among the houses, with the native police straggling about in the
rear and fervently praying for just that chance of a row that our
leader had determined to avoid, the fighting men of the town seemed
to go nearly out of their minds with excitement and indecision.
They giggled and grinned more than ever; they hovered and danced
about on tiptoe, nearly ofd the ground; they ran after us, touched
us, and withdrew as if we were red-hot. The wild nervousness of
their demeanour was very much emphasised by the style of their
dress, which consisted solely of ornaments, nearly all of a
fluttering and trembling kind&mdash;waving plumes of long grass
thrust into armlets, feathers ingeniously mounted on a stem that
quivered with every movement, sweeping tails of grasses and fibres
tied on at the back of the waist and swinging wildly as the wearer
turned about, haloes of long shaking white and yellow parrot quills
fastened round the head with tight bands. They really made one
giddy to look at; and it was better, in any case, not to look at
them too much, for (as I have said above) the Goari-Barian has an
extraordinary knack of vanishing in some incredible way under a
house or into a thicket, if you look at him fixedly, which is, at
the least, embarrassing. They carried bows and arrows and long
spears of some wood like ebony, barbed and pointed at the end. Some
of them wore close-fitting gaiters of bark cloth, extending from
the ankle to the knee and neatly fastened with rows of small white
cowry shells. They had no beads, save the native kind made from
small shells, which are common among the uncivilised tribes.
Cassowary feathers, which are like black horsehair in texture,
seemed to be favourite adornments, worn either as sweeping plumes
or as head ornaments shaped exactly like a miniature chimney-brush.
Most of the men, in addition to painting their faces and the shaven
part of their heads bright red, had circled their eyes with a large
black ring, which added considerably to the wild savagery of their
appearance. The nose-bone was not worn.</p>

<p>The big dubu or communal house was of course the first place to
visit in this odd sight-seeing tour. It stood close to the
landing-place, on a bed of black swamp alive with small crawly
crabs, and was approached by a very rough skeleton ladder some
eight or nine feet high. The place had a special interest, for it
stood on the spot occupied by the dubu in which Chalmers was
murdered by these people in 1902. The Government had the dubu
destroyed, but another was put up shortly after.</p>

<p>This was the first of the very long dubus that I had seen, and I
looked at it with interest, knowing that I was seeing something
which had never been described in print&mdash;which, indeed, was
known to but a mere handful of the white race as yet. These long
dubus are found only among the still unbroken and uncivilised
cannibal tribes, and in most of the villages that possess them an
unprotected stranger would be promptly massacred. We owed our
safety to the fact that a dozen police armed with rifles
accompanied us, and to the memory that the people still retained of
the "massacre" of 1904. They might, of course, have rushed the
party and overpowered it by superiority of numbers, there being
some hundreds of men in the town; but our leader counted on the
cowardice of the Goari-Barian&mdash;and rightly so, as events
proved.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust36" id="illust36"></a><img src=
"1501051h-images/TNNG-36.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=
"Illustration">
</p>

<p>The dubu, as paced by some of the ship's party, was just upon
600 feet long. Its height was uniform all through, and seemed about
twelve feet. Like an immense brown centipede it wound its way
backwards through the swamp, supported on innumerable feet of
upbearing piles, and covering an extent of ground that seemed
practically endless. It took us quite a long time to walk down the
dim brown tunnel of the interior, looking at everything as we
went&mdash;the walls, of close-fitted stick-work; the roof,
nipa-palm thatch; the curious little sections into which the whole
place was divided, like the pens in a cattle-show, each pen being
the abode of a more or less happy family, as proved by the domestic
goods lying about&mdash;woven baskets, clay pots, belts, pieces of
bark cloth. In the very centre of the building there was a sort of
little bay looking out over the swamp and the creek. Here certain
treasures, probably communal, were placed&mdash;two or three small
wooden images of human beings, very rudely carved (we tried to buy
them, but they seemed to be without price), several skulls, some
carved into patterns of a rather Celtic character, some fitted with
artificial snouts of bone fastened on with clay, which made them
look extremely like the heads of beasts until closely examined.</p>

<p>And here "a strange thing happened." Ever since we had landed in
the town, strange, inhuman howls and wails had been resounding from
the river that ran back from the shore. We had not paid much
attention to them, supposing them to be the excited cries of dogs.
But here, from the point of vantage furnished by the bay, we could
see a good way up the river, and it became clear that the howling
was only in part attributable to the brute creation. The women of
the town were fleeing up the river in canoes, uttering the most
dismal of wails, in which they were joined by the dogs they were
taking with them. Women, dogs, and skulls&mdash;in fact, all the
treasures of the town&mdash;formed the cargo of every canoe.</p>

<p>We called to them, and even sent an interpreter to hail them
from the bank, but they only paddled the faster, and were soon
altogether lost to view.</p>

<p>This was hardly sociable of the Goari-Barians on an alleged
friendly visit, the removal of the women being always a sign of
distrust and hostility. However, our party abandoned the point for
the moment, to return to it later, and continued the walk down the
dubu. We emerged at the farther end into sunshine that seemed
almost blinding and heat that struck upwards from the black mud of
the swamp like the blast of a furnace. A few natives were hovering
and twittering about beyond the dubu, running lightly up and down
the slimy logs that served as pathways through the mud. We gave
them some beads and some calico, both of which excited an almost
religious emotion of delight. I do not think I shall ever forget
the spectacle of a dozen sturdy cannibals sprawling on their hands
and knees in the mud and reeds, trying to pick up about an ounce of
small embroidery beads that someone had let fall into that hopeless
tangle. There is little doubt that, if they took a week to it, they
would manage to succeed.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust37" id="illust37"></a><img src=
"1501051h-images/TNNG-37.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=
"Illustration">
</p>

<p>While some of us were thus engaged, a canoe reappeared
tentatively in the far distance, hovering about the corner of the
river. Feminine curiosity, it seemed, was, after all, stronger than
fear&mdash;an incident scarcely new in the history of the world. We
seized the opportunity and, advancing to the bank, hailed the
canoe. It vanished instantly, much to everyone's
disappointment.</p>

<p>Then an inspiration seized me, and getting away from my party a
hundred yards or so, I stood up on a log, called out loudly, and
began waving some coloured ribbons. The canoes must have been
within watching distance after all, for one crept cautiously out.
Calling, signalling, and displaying the ribbons, I managed to lure
the shy game to hand, and by and by we had two or three exceedingly
ugly old women, wrinkled, baldheaded, and almost naked, standing
trembling on the bank, eyeing the ribbons with covetous gaze. We
gave the poor old souls a liberal portion of the treasure, and
started back through the dubu to rejoin His Excellency, who was
making a speech to the natives on the other side.</p>

<p>Of all the odd incidents of this odd, mad day, that which
followed was the oddest and the nastiest. We&mdash;myself, the
Government official, and a missionary&mdash;stopped for a moment
under the shade of the dubu verandah before going in; and at this
moment two or three men came out of the dubu carrying a Iump of
meat in their hands. It was ugly-looking meat,&mdash;watery, pale
lead-coloured, fat; it smelt abominably, and did not look like the
known joint of any known animal. The men held it up before us as
they passed, and one of them pulled off a morsel and thrust it
under my nose. The stench made me nearly sick. I got out of range
as quickly as possible, and took another look at the strange object
from a safer distance...Was it?...</p>

<p>With a loud, savage laugh the men leaped down from the platform
and rushed away into the bush, carrying their unsavoury morsel with
them. I had my suspicions as to what it was, and my companions were
quite certain. We had seen a bit of boiled man!</p>

<p>It was, of course, the flesh of a native victim. The people of
Goari-Bari are very determined cannibals; short of other food, they
even eat the dead, provided the corpse is fairly young and well
nourished. They are an ill-made, ugly-looking set of ruffians, and
not at all healthy-looking, which is certainly what one would
expect.</p>

<p>We found the Governor having a heart-to-heart talk with some of
the worst-looking of the crew on the other side of the dubu. He
spoke through an interpreter, and they listened with much
seriousness, having apparently laid aside their nervousness for the
moment. They were not to go on eating each other, the Governor told
them. It was disapproved by the Government; besides, they had to
consider that if they went on eating their young people, by and by
the village would die out. They were not to bury their corpses
under houses or hang them up in trees (a picturesque local custom
of which we had already had an illustration). They were,
especially, not to kill any white men, but to receive them civilly
if they came. The Government wished to be friends with them, and
would protect them from their enemies if they behaved
themselves.</p>

<p>The speech was received very gravely, and the distribution of
calico and tobacco among the chief men of the town that followed
seemed to cause much gratification. And now the proceedings were
enlivened with a touch of humour.</p>

<p>"Here is some calico for yourself," said the distributor of the
goods to an old man who appeared to be a person of some importance.
"Here is another piece for your wife. Have you more than one?"
holding a third piece in readiness.</p>

<p>"No!" cried the old man unexpectedly.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked the dispenser of favours, rather surprised at
such an admission from a chief.</p>

<p>"Because," yelled the old man, dancing with excitement and
feeling, "one is enough&mdash;quite, quite enough!"</p>

<p>There were three married men in our party. When the old chief's
remark was translated to them they all roared. The unmarried men,
on the other hand, scarcely seemed to think the joke remarkable for
wit.</p>

<p>It was now after four o'clock, and we felt ready for afternoon
tea. The native boat's crew, who were accustomed to this
picknicking business, lit a fire, got out the hamper, and in a very
short time had an impromptu table ready, covered with a damask
cloth and shining with silver and china. We sat down on logs all
round and began to enjoy our tea.</p>

<p>Words cannot depict the amazement, fear, and horror caused by
the proceeding. It was of course taken at once for sorcery, and
sorcery of the very worst kind. Astounding objects, such as no one
had ever seen, put to incomprehensible uses by these scarcely
comprehensible people&mdash;why, a man's life was not safe for a
moment in the neighbourhood of such unholy mysteries! Nearly every
soul cleared off into the bush like rabbits, leaving us in
possession of an empty town&mdash;all but.</p>

<p>There were three or four, however, who still hung about,
trembling with fear, but devoured with curiosity.</p>

<p>Watching cautiously from under the houses, they crept out by and
by and ventured close up to the tea-table, their faces a very mask
or representation of the emotion of astonishment. We offered them
biscuits and cake, but not a soul would touch anything until he had
seen the giver bite off and swallow a piece, when he usually took
the remainder and ate it eagerly, yet cautiously. Any gentleman,
they evidently thought, might be moved at any time to poison
another gentleman: it was the part of the other gentleman to see
that he did not do it.</p>

<p>By now we thought it time to go hack, so the boats were ordered,
and the visitors took their departure. Goari-Bari had, for once,
known a peaceful visit.</p>

<p>Next day the Governor went on shore, and after the exercise of a
little diplomacy succeeded in getting possession of the bones of
the murdered Chalmers and his fellow-worker Tompkins. They were
easily identified by means of certain known peculiarities. The
<i>Merrie England</i> conveyed them to the London Mission Station
at Daru, where the representative of the Mission saw to their
decent burial. And so the prestige of Goari-Bari was broken.</p>

<p>A year later the <i>Merrie England</i> made another call, when I
had again the luck to be present. We found the town much as it had
been on the occasion of the last visit&mdash;it could not be called
more friendly. Still, judging by the experience that the Government
has had with other intractable tribes, civility and trust will come
in time. On this occasion the people of Goari-Bari visited the ship
while the Government party was absent, and, in spite of the care of
the sailors, stole one or two items that betrayed a strange taste
in booty.</p>

<p>Item: His Excellency's toothbrush.</p>

<p>Item: Newspapers&mdash;all they could get.</p>

<p>Item: One pair of gloves, picked up in the water.</p>

<p>Item: One umbrella&mdash;theft vigorously attempted, but did not
quite come off.</p>

<p>This was no mere chance selection. You can buy nearly anything
in Goari-Bari for newspaper&mdash;politics indifferent&mdash;and as
for an umbrella, the Goari-Barian would sell his soul, if he knew
he had one, for even half of such a treasure. An aeroplane ascent
in the midst of a Cockney crowd never created half so much
excitement as did the unfurling of my umbrella in Goari-Bari on the
day of our second visit. The people danced and shouted with
excitement, and fought each other for a chance to touch the spring
and repeat the miracle. Had I not been very strongly escorted they
would certainly have had that umbrella; they could scarcely
restrain themselves from snatching it as it was.</p>

<p>As for the toothbrush, I do not suppose for a minute that they
meant to put it to its legitimate use, or had the slightest idea of
what that was. They probably wanted it for a "pourri-pourri," or
charm&mdash;much as one of the Western tribes wanted a shoehorn,
which they stole from a trader and hung up in their biggest temple
for the adoration of the faithful.</p>

<p>All in all, the tastes of Goari-Bari, coupled with its
exceedingly primitive state, forcibly recall the saying of the
famous philosopher who expressed his readiness to do without the
necessities of life if he might only have the superfluities!</p>

<p>It was on the occasion of our second visit to the Wild
West&mdash;in January, 1909&mdash;that we came upon something that
really was rather near being an adventure. The story is worth
telling, not for any small part that I took in it myself, but
simply as an illustration of something not known to most British
colonies&mdash;the art of making peace peacefully.</p>

<p>This great unbroken and unexplored district of the `Vest, with
its smaller neighbour the Gulf Division, is perhaps the chief of
the many sources of anxiety that render unquiet the pillow of
Papuan rulers. All in all, this part of the country is as large as
England, and nobody knows much about it. The peaceful planter of
the Central and Eastern Divisions scarcely knows that it exists,
and takes little interest in it, save in so far as it supplies him
at times with wild, savage, but very useful labour. The tourist who
comes up in the alleged cool season from Sydney or Melbourne for a
trip round the Solomon Islands and Papua in a Burns Philp steamer
never goes within a hundred miles of it&mdash;first, because
steamers do not call; secondly, because everything that sails the
seas goes in terror of the Gulf and its storms and currents and
deadly river bars; thirdly, because it is not a place for the
irresponsible tourist to "monkey with" anyhow, and he is usually
advised to keep away. The <i>Merrie England</i>&mdash;a small,
strongly built steamer made of wood, with a huge leaden keel, can
take chances with reefs and bars that other vessels dare not
encounter, and what she cannot do her steam-launch can. It is the
duty of her officials to visit the district, and they do so; it is
the duty of the Resident Magistrates to patrol, and they try, under
difficulties the like of which Stanley never even imagined; it is
not the duty of anyone else to go there, and no one else goes
except an occasional explorer.</p>

<p>The Government, therefore, is left to wrestle alone with the
tremendous task of subduing, reforming, and bringing into line as a
useful and civilised colony this immense preserve of murderous
cannibals&mdash;an unknown land protected by dangerous coasts, by
trackless marshes, by natural mazes of rivers hundreds of miles in
extent, by vast unbroken forests, and, more than all, by a
conformation of country almost inconceivably rugged and
entangled.</p>

<p>The tools with which the Government has to work are almost
laughably inadequate&mdash;two Resident Magistrates, thirty-four
armed native constables, a couple of whaleboats, and two small
ketches. The Government yacht makes not more than a couple of
visits in the year, unless any serious disturbance calls for a
special expedition.</p>

<p>One would like to see what kind of reception such a programme
would meet with if put before one of our Indian, West African, or
Burmese officials. "Utter impossibility" would be the mildest term
likely to be used in describing it. And yet the impossible thing is
being done in Papua, that land where, truly, "nothing arrives save
the unexpected." The West is being broken in slowly, carefully,
without violence, step by step, yet unmistakably. Two years ago the
tribes of the delta country and the Aird River openly defied and
even attacked white men whenever they saw them. Now, like the
sailor in the wise saw, if they have no decency they sham a little,
and, at all events, receive the ruling race with
civility&mdash;paying it the further compliment of concealing
cannibal murders and outrages as far as possible from the
prejudiced mind of the white. Goari-Bari may seem to be an
exception, but the fact that a small party of whites, with a very
small guard, now visit that notorious town in safety every year,
proves an enormous advance over the state of a very few years ago.
Further, the Western and Gulf tribes have recently begun to ask
help from the Government when oppressed and attacked by their
enemies, and one or two of them have, entirely of their own accord,
sent in tribute of fruits and sago.</p>

<p>The old-fashioned system, now done away with, was the same that
is being carried out in nearly all savage or semi-savage colonies
to-day. It is very simple. You let your dangerous savage alone till
he kills a missionary or a trader, and then you go and burn down
his village and shoot as many of him as you can catch, which is not
many as a rule. After this you return to your seat of government
and let him alone. When the process has been repeated a good many
times, you take a large armed force and march through his country
fighting as you go in the hope of teaching him a lesson that he
will not forget. He does not forget; on the contrary, he keeps a
stone up his sleeve for you, and waits years, if need be, for an
opportunity to throw it&mdash;not necessarily at you; if you are
unattainable, the newest missionary or the latest settler or trader
will do just as well. Then you go out and exterminate him some
more, and if land has been taken up in his neighbourhood you
"disperse" him (with a rifle) as often as he comes near the
settlements. By this time he is getting discouraged, and (after the
fashion of the discouraged native) he begins to die out, aided
considerably by the gin to which the traders have introduced him.
(You told them not to, but they would do it, and how were you to
catch them?...besides, it really does add on to the revenue very
conveniently, and gives you something to build your bridges
with.)...</p>

<p>The process takes anything you like from fifty to a hundred
years, but it comes to an end at last. The country is civilised.
The native is dispersed&mdash;to the Elysian fields or elsewhere
(not your fault, again; you told him to go "to hell <i>or</i> to
Connaught," and if he chose the former, are you to blame?). You
have imported nice, clean, sensible Indian and Chinese coolies to
fill his place; his hunting-grounds are covered with sugar
plantations, and his mountain fastnesses are haunts of the winter
tourist. In fine, you have civilised the country. And as for the
"native "...did we say you were his keeper? Did anyone tell the
first agent of civilisation on record&mdash;he who built the first
cities, and was the ancestor of "those that work in brass and
iron"&mdash;that he was the keeper of the inconvenient personage he
"dispersed"?...</p>

<p>That is the old way of our colonies. The new way is something so
simple, yet so astonishing, that I count myself fortunate to have
had the luck of seeing it in person. It is easy to understand an
account of a punitive expedition or a fight. It is not so easy to
see the inner meaning of a report that deals only with a peaceful
call on a hostile tribe. I am glad that I was there to see and to
realise how peace is being made in the Nest.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>It was a wet, warm, blowy morning, and the Gulf looked very
nasty indeed. The great inlet upon which the <i>Merrie England</i>
had been pitching and rolling all night was livid yellow in colour
under a sky of dirty grey. The little party of seven white people
and eleven armed native police who were going ashore had to watch
their time getting into the launch and the boat, and jump when the
pitching seas allowed. Rain beat hard in our faces as the launch
towed us at top speed to Goari-Bari, where we meant to get a guide
if possible. We were going to a town called Maiparé, some few miles
away, but no one knew exactly where it was, as it had never been
visited by whites except in 1902, after Chalmers' death, when a
general punitive expedition had landed a large body of soldiers
from Australia, accompanied by native police, and shot everyone who
appeared.</p>

<p>We did not expect a peaceful reception, and it was all the more
important, therefore, to get a guide who could act as interpreter
and call out encouraging remarks as we approached. (Of course the
village had a language of its own. You might as well be without a
detached villa in London Suburbia as without a detached language in
the back country of Papua: the absence of either would argue an
un-aristocratic familiarity with miscellaneous neighbours.)</p>

<p>They were not up when we got to Dopima Beach, below the town
commonly called Goari-Bari. It was getting on for eight o'clock,
but the morning was unpleasant and gloomy, and the simple savage
(who is always up with the golden dawn, carolling like a lark as he
seeks his breakfast of "herbs" and fruits, according to the
simple-life theorists) had not turned out yet, and did not want to.
We shouted for him till he did get up, however, and came down to
the beach, two or three of him, looking sulky and sleepy.</p>

<p>With infinite persuasions and the promise of a good steel axe
(produced) we succeeded in getting one man to go with us, after we
had calmed his naïve fear that the Big Chief wanted to keep him
altogether and his various coquetries about doing what was wanted
of him. (<i>Il faut se faire mousser,</i> he seemed to be saying to
himself in Goari-Barian.) It was well on in the morning when we got
away, still under a fall of gusty rain, and made our way through
the lumpy, pounding seas in the direction of Maiparé.</p>

<p>Our guide was quite happy for a while, and did not seen much
astonished by the mechanism of the steam-launch, although the
ingenuities of my umbrella on the day before had nearly frightened
him into a fit. Things entirely outside the grasp of the native
mind do not astound it, as a rule; it is small matters, such as
gloves, tea-kettles, eye-glasses, that strike visible amazement
into the soul of the simple cannibal. The speed of the launch
seemed to delight him, and when he was told to get up into the bows
of the boat and con us through the shoals, he obeyed with evident
pleasure.</p>

<p>But now, after an hour or two, we were getting to Maiparé. The
line of black swampy coast was closing in; thatched houses could be
seen in the distance, and small coloured specks were moving
excitedly about. Our guide began to look as if he were asking
himself the old riddle about what is better in a railway accident
than presence of mind. He made a wild, weird picture enough,
perched up against the sky-line in the bows like some demon
figure-head, his body flung forward almost beyond the limits of
statical laws, his black bark-cloth mantle flying in the wind,
every feather in his halo streaming and quivering, his fierce,
painted face strained towards the rapidly approaching shore. It was
plain to everyone in the two boats that Maiparé did not want us,
and was prepared to say "Not at home" in terms the most emphatic.
The shore was lined with fighting men, several hundred of them,
painted, feathered, and armed to the last degree. They were
uttering a most extraordinary cry, like nothing on earth but a
dog-show in torment, loud yelps being mixed with piercing howls in
a peculiarly canine way. As we came nearer they began to dance, and
it was then that I first had the pleasure of seeing what very few
people have ever looked on&mdash;a real war-dance, danced in
earnest by genuine savages.</p>

<p>If anyone wants to see an exact reproduction of the performance,
let him take a children's jumping jack and pull the strings. That
is the Aird River war-dance to a hair. Just so did the people throw
up an arm and a leg, rapidly and alternately, with a curious,
wooden, unlifelike effect, that yet managed to convey its meaning
with remarkable clearness. "Come on!" it said. "Come on, and take
what you will get!" The tall bows and the bunches of arrows, the
long thin spears shaken defiantly in the air, the fluttering
feathers and fringes of the dancing warriors, added to the general
effect, and made one at least of the party curse the luck that had
covered the sky with drifting rain-clouds and rendered the camera
useless. I had secured a snap of a Goari-Barian rudely doing a
war-dance by himself the day before; but the splendid picture of
four or five hundred men in full war-dress dancing with all their
souls was not to be mine or anyone else's.</p>

<p>The steam-launch puffed on, and we rushed nearer and nearer to
the shore. Our interpreter and guide swung wildly by a stay in the
bows, yelling himself hoarse, calling to the people to put down
their arms, assuring them no harm was meant, urging them to stop
dancing, to listen; but they took no more notice of him than if he
had been a screaming cockatoo. We were almost within bowshot now;
and some of us were beginning to wonder what was coming
next&mdash;only to wonder, however. We had seen something of the
Governmental methods before, and knew that they had a knack of
turning out right side up.</p>

<p>When close to the shore the Governor stopped the launch and
started for the shore with nine of the police and four of the white
men, leaving myself, two police, and two engineers in the
steam-launch, all very bitterly disappointed at being out of the
fun, though I was told I should be sent for as soon as possible. We
were immediately surrounded by a swarm of canoes filled with lively
gentry from the town, who hovered about us, darting to and fro, and
trying to grab everything portable that the launch contained. It
took up all our attention for a few minutes to protect the
<i>Merrie England's</i> property without creating a disturbance,
and so I missed the sight of the landing, which must have been
worth seeing. The howls of the interpreter had succeeded so far as
to induce the natives to lay down some of their weapons and to stop
dancing. On this the party landed, and the five white men and nine
police then went for a walk among the four or five hundred excited
cannibals, talking to them, looking at them, and offering them
smokes. This unprecedented conduct first puzzled, then interested,
then reassured the warriors. They could not understand very well
what these lunatics were doing, but they thought the strangers must
be in possession of some extraordinary unseen force to behave in
such a manner, and they inferred that their intentions were
nevertheless not evil. They did not abandon their arms, and they
kept up an extremely wild and excited demeanour, but they made no
attack, and when asked to bring out their women, so that the white
woman might come ashore, they actually produced two or three
wrinkled old hags and brought them down to the beach.</p>

<p>The boat was now sent for me, and brought me into the town. I
had scarcely set foot on the mud of the beach when the two old
women seized me by both hands and grasped me as if they were
drowning. They were evidently very badly frightened, and clung to
the idea of a hostage as their only safety. Surrounded by a wildly
excited crowd&mdash;the hysteria of Goari-Bari was really nothing
to the hysteria of Maiparé&mdash;they, and an old man who seemed to
be a chief, led me to the dubu of the town, and half dragged, half
pushed me up the ladder. Some of our own party followed, but the
old hags were evidently not interested in them. They towed me down
the whole length of the dubu (nearly as long as that of
Goari-Bari), still led by the old chief, and still cackling and
chuckling with joy. At the end of the building they paused, and
seemed undecided what to do. The far door led out into the depths
of unknown, slimy, swampy thickets, and I had no fancy at all to go
there, as their looks suggested they wanted nie to do. Possibly the
rest of the women were concealed somewhere in the swamp and wished
to sec me, but I thought the chance too uncertain to take, as
treachery is the very soul of the western savage. We all lingered
for a moment, apparently admiring the very unadmirable view, and
then, on the motion of the whites, started back down the endless
length of the dim, dusty, shaky brown tunnel along which we had
come.</p>

<p>The women still kept up their drowning grip, and the old man
still towed the entire outfit. When we reached the centre of the
dubu they came to a determined halt and began pulling downwards
towards the floor, motioning to myself and the two white men who
were with me that we should sit.</p>

<p>Nobody knew exactly what to do. There were a good many natives
in the dubu, and although the people were civil enough, one could
not quite forget that the preliminary to the end of Chalmers and
others had been just such an invitation to "sit down." There was
silence for a moment or two. The sun sifted in through the roof in
long thin spears, making a warp of dusty gold across the
transparent gloom. The curtains of brown combed fibre that hung
from the rafters dropped straight and still in the windless air,
like worn-out banners from some forgotten battlefield, hung in a
dark cathedral. Dusky faces and forms, scarce visible in the
shadow, and motionless save for the trembling of a grass armlet or
the flicker of a plume, waited for our reply. And the women pulled
my hands.</p>

<p>It was only a few seconds before the white men answered. We
would not stay, they said. It was getting late, and we had to
remember the fall of the tide.</p>

<p>So we went out again into the rainy sunlight of the beach, where
the mud-crabs crawled by millions in the slime, and the poisonous
green bush clustered low on the black quagmire of the land. Maiparé
was still at fever-point of excitement, running about, staring,
skipping, bolting into the bush and coming back again, and (like
Goari-Bari) instantly converting itself into a dissolving view if
you looked at any of it too closely. But it had altered its
demeanour to a certain extent. The presents given by the Government
party&mdash;wonderful red calico, beads, knives, tobacco&mdash;had
convinced it that these strange people, headed by the very tall
chief, did not intend to use the mysterious powers of offence that
they no doubt possessed. It had brought out more of its
women&mdash;young ones this time&mdash;and a few children, to share
in the good things that were going; and it was laughing
now&mdash;laughing with a wild nervous excitement, but evidently
not without some sort of pleasure. When we re-embarked, at least a
score of long light canoes pushed off from shore to accompany us as
far as possible. The men paddled with astonishing vigour, and kept
up with the launch as long as the smooth water lasted, but when we
got out into the lumpy water of the bay the cockle-shell crafts
fell behind, and the last we saw of Maiparé was a vision of wild
painted faces, with feathers streaming in the wind, and long
mantles of new scarlet calico slatting and flying like loose sails,
all falling into the rear, with shrieks and cries that needed no
interpreter to translate them into their obvious
equivalent&mdash;"Come again!"</p>

<p>One knew, without being told, that the next party of official
visitors who cane to Maiparé would find the town friendly and
well-disposed. Another step had been taken towards the pacification
of the `Vest.</p>

<p>There is not space to tell of two or three other calls that the
Government party made while I was with them in the same district;
calls that took us into villages never before seen by whites, where
sometimes nearly the whole population cleared off into the bush,
only a few brave or curious souls remaining to see what manner of
people these white conquerors might be, of whom they had heard so
much. The plucky minority were always well rewarded, for gifts of
red calico, beads, tobacco, and knives were always made, and all
these are valued in the Gulf and river country much as Russian
sable robes, diamonds, and fine solid silver tableware would be
valued in an English provincial town if suddenly distributed
broadcast by an eccentric travelling millionaire.</p>

<p>None of the odd experiences for which people spend their time
and money in travelling is more piquant than this playing of Lords
and Ladies Bountiful among untamed savages. It is as gratifying to
one's natural human vanity as the part of a great Royalty might be
to one unaccustomed to such honours. When your boots are obviously
regarded as a miracle, your hat as a piece of magic&mdash;when a
stray button from your clothes is cherished like the relic of a
saint, and the back of an old letter out of your pocket is accepted
with trembling joy&mdash;when your lordly munificence in giving
away halfpenny sticks of tobacco, and your splendid generosity in
bestowing inestimable fourpenny knives seem to drive the lucky
beneficiaries half out of their minds, it is hard not to feel that
you are great and good to a degree that even you yourself had not
previously suspected. Of course, real gratitude is an emotion not
known to these simple souls, any more than it is known, as a rule,
to your greengrocer, or your county member, or your patient, or
your client, or your tiresome greedy nephew or aunt. They (the
savages) think you silly for giving them all these treasures, but
they worship the power that has made you master of such things, and
they understand dimly, imperfectly, yet unmistakably, as men black,
brown, and white, cannibal or Christian, do understand the things
that really matter&mdash;that you mean to be their friend.</p>

<p>With this knowledge goes also the conviction&mdash;much older,
and based on manifold rumours that have drifted in from the wider
civilisation beyond&mdash;that the Government does not like
cannibalism and tribal murder, and that these pleasing diversions
are best kept away from its knowledge "lest some worse thing
happen." Later on will come the step which Maipua has taken during
the year and a half that have elapsed since I first made its
acquaintance&mdash;actually abandoning these practices, and fast
becoming the copy-book example of the river country. The cannibal
of the West is by no means deficient in brains, and when he
realises once for all that it pays to be "in" with the Government,
he becomes almost obtrusively loyal.</p>

<p>In a new village the Government always cements the allegiance of
the chiefs by a curious ceremony, which might be called the
Investiture of the Order of the Imperial Shirt. Clothes-wearing, it
may be added in parenthesis, is not encouraged among the natives,
as science has proved that it helps to produce disease, but an
exception is made in the case of chiefs with whom the ruling Powers
wish to open up friendly relations. Anything like a ceremonial
dress or uniform has an incalculable effect upon the Papuan mind.
The force of village constables that helps the Armed Native
Constabulary in keeping order would, like the constabulary, be more
comfortable, and perhaps more healthy (though no ill results have
been noted) without the serge tunics and jumpers, braided with red,
that they wear as a sign of office; but it is certain that they
would be much less happy, and that they would exact scarcely any
respect from the other natives without uniform. In the unsettled
and scarce-visited districts of the West, where a rude kind of bark
cloth is the only material available for covering, the smallest
fragment of cotton is highly valued, and the possession of a whole
shirt is enough to make a man a king among his fellows. Therefore,
at each new town, where the foot of the white man had never before
attempted to tread (we say attempted, as the treading was mostly
done on half-submerged logs with occasional disasters), the
principal old man was picked out and solemnly invested by the
Governor's Private Secretary with a shirt, a cotton tunic, and a
leather belt.</p>

<p>One and all they took the ceremony in exactly the same way. It
was possible to be excited and hilarious over a knife or a handful
of beads, but for great matters great emotions were appropriate.
They understood fully that the presentation of these royal robes
conferred a rank upon them higher than they had ever possessed, and
made them in some way allies of the mysterious power known as
"Govamena." With a dignity surprising to see in a naked heathen who
had only the moment before been prancing and skipping with
excitement, and scrambling in the mud for beads, the chief, under
operation, would stand up to be dressed, head in air, chest thrown
out, eyes half closed with pride, and utter never a word while he
was being put into the strange garments that were to change the
whole current of his life. Once shirted, tunicked, and belted, he
would march down the dubu with long slow strides, collecting and
enjoy-. ing the popular homage as he went, but never casting a
glance at the common folk who offered it. Henceforth he was
somebody, and very likely, indeed, to be on the side of the
mysterious power that had promoted him, if it happened to come down
looking for a murderer some months later, or to want men for
carriers, or to require any other little service.</p>

<p>Kaimari, a neighbour of the copy-book Maipua, has progressed so
far as to become actually embarrassing by excess of zeal. It even
sent out seven hundred warriors in war canoes to meet and join the
Government party, on one occasion in 1908, when the Government
wished to investigate an attempted attack on two venturesome white
traders, which had occurred at another delta town&mdash;Ukiaravi.
The very last thing the party desired, naturally, was an army of
bloodthirsty, howling fiends to accompany them on a mission that
was delicate and diplomatic in the extreme, but they had almost
insurmountable difficulty in inducing the loyal militia of Kaimari
to go home. Ukiaravi&mdash;a town of some thousands of people,
determinedly hostile to whites&mdash;was on that occasion taken
possession of by the usual four or five white men and handful of
police, and a number of prisoners carried away handcuffed, and in
mortal terror, to several years of jail in Port Moresby. It was
done by a determined show of force, a little quick action, and no
violence at all; the people of Ukiaravi, as the result of this
salutary action, have been sending tributary canoes of sago and
fruit, whenever they could, ever since, to express the extreme and
enthusiastic character of the loyalty they have so suddenly
acquired.</p>

<p>After I had left the West and gone back to Port Moresby in the
<i>Merrie England,</i> the Government party&mdash;His Excellency
the Lieutenant-Governor, five other white men, and eleven
police&mdash;left the yacht altogether for more than a week, going
inland in boats to districts of the Aird River country never seen
by whites, and discovering a number of new, largely populated
towns. This voyage of adventure added a good deal to the imperfect
geographical knowledge of the district, and did much to bring the
country in touch with civilised influences. No attacks were made
and no trouble met with. The peaceful display of authority thus
shown, and the knowledge that the tiny handful of whites had no
fear whatever of the hordes of murderous cannibals among whom they
were journeying, far from all possible help, no doubt laid the
foundations of a future reign of law and order among the hitherto
intractable savages.</p>

<p>This is the new way. Those who know the country are beginning to
hope that it may have a new result&mdash;the preservation of the
native races, an end hitherto not achieved in any similar
possession of Great Britain.</p>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="caption">Eastward in the <i>Merrie England</i>&mdash;The
prettiness of Samarai&mdash;"Very feverish"&mdash;Hunting the
Japs&mdash;The island world again&mdash;What they did in Milne
Bay&mdash;A day in the gold mines&mdash;The man who lost his
head&mdash;The unbelievable island&mdash;Did they eat the
Chinamen?&mdash;A two days' man-hunt&mdash;Where the money is
made.</p>

<p>IT is half-past five o'clock.</p>

<p>The stars seem to be cooling down before they go out. All night
they have danced and swayed in the space between the bulwark and
the awning, hot, yellow, and restless. They are turning pale now,
and their white faces look chill. The warm river of wind that has
been flowing steadily down from the bowsprit across my mattress
since eleven o'clock now takes on a touch of grateful coolness. The
east is growing orange&mdash;the lurid, volcanic orange of a tropic
dawn.</p>

<p>I sit up on my mattress, dressing-gown clad, and look round. On
the bridge-deck above, the sheeted dead seem to be lying in heaps,
limbs cast abroad, heads thrown back to the lightening sky. It is
only the Government officials and the ship's officers wrapped in
the quilts that they have pulled up as the chill of the dawn began,
but it certainly suggests a battlefield in the dead stillness of
this early hour while the <i>Merrie England</i> is yet asleep. She
will not long be asleep, however. It is close on deck-washing time,
so I gather up my pillows and go down reluctantly to my pretty,
roomy, dainty, but most outrageously hot and stifling cabin on the
deck below. The temperature is over 100, for the ports have to be
kept shut owing to the liveliness of the yacht out at sea; and we
are in the worst of the hot season, thrashing round the south-east
corner of New Guinea on a tour about the islands.</p>

<p>We left Samarai yesterday&mdash;the second town in Papua; the
"other" town, in fact, since there are but two. Samarai is surely
one of the very prettiest places in the whole tropic world. Its
situation is unique&mdash;a tiny island, which you can walk round
in a quarter of an hour, set in the midst of a bright blue strait
surrounded by high, steep, densely wooded hills. There are other
islands dotted about the strait, some large, some small, some near,
some far away, but all alike bright green, palmy, fringed with
snow-white coral beaches&mdash;in fact, the typical South Sea
island of a schoolboy's dream. People live on one or two&mdash;a
man and his wife, looking after their cocoanut plantation; a
solitary German, who keeps cattle and sends milk over to Samarai
every day in a boat; a Chinaman, who grows cabbages and beans to
supply the hotels. Native canoes, made out of hollowed-out logs and
gaily decorated with big white shells, ply constantly up and down
among the straits and islets. The tribes who live on the mainland
are all friendly and on good terms with the whites. Looking down
through the narrow neck of China Straits (if you ask me why "China"
I cannot tell you; no one seems to know) on a clear day, one can
see the dark blue mass of Ferguson Island, which is much bigger
than the Isle of Wight, standing up on the horizon some forty miles
away. They are naughty little people on Ferguson&mdash;ill-tempered
small cannibals who hide in mountain fastnesses and throw spears at
the Government officials when the latter go out on patrol. But they
keep to themselves, and are never seen near Samarai.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust40" id="illust40"></a><img src=
"1501051h-images/TNNG-40.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=
"Illustration">
</p>

<p>As for Samarai itself, it is a much more imposing town than the
capital. It has several large wooden hotels, three miscellaneous
stores, and a whole street of little tin-roofed offices and
bungalows. It is neat and tidy to the verge of primness&mdash;white
sanded walks, bordered by gorgeous hedges of crimson and
orange-leaved crotons; shaven green lawns; garden seats set out at
picturesque points all round the island. Roses red, white, and
yellow; scarlet and cream-coloured hibiscus, jasmine in hedges,
climbing allamanda (a flower like a large yellow gloxinia), strange
blossoms that fall like showers of tiny blood-drops through
feathery green foliage, pink begonias, and all sorts of
quaint-foliaged trees, from the huge forest king that bears
thousands of sweet nuts, and is generally half scarlet, half green
in leaf, down to the weird, stiff, witch-like pandanus with the
twisted chevaux-de-frise of saw-edged swords&mdash;all these
brighten up the parklike, dainty little place and add still further
to its cultivated look.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust41" id="illust41"></a><img src=
"1501051h-images/TNNG-41.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=

</p>

<p>There is, in truth, not much cultivation about it after
all&mdash;a few prisoners from the jail kept cleaning and weeding;
no more. In countries like Papua, nature simply leaps to meet the
gardener's hand. The mainland is just as fertile as Samarai. When
you take up land you can clear away your "bush" or forest, leaving
the ornamental trees and plants, of which there are many; pull
branches off anything that you fancy in a neighbour's place, and
stick them in anywhere you like; give one or two flowering creepers
<i>carte blanche</i> to behave as they please; bring a little white
sand from the beach or a few stones and ferns from the
river&mdash;and in a few weeks' time behold a result that would
make Kew Gardens sick with envy! Orchids you can find anywhere, and
they will grow on any tree to which you tie them. Butterflies as
big as birds and as bright as jewels, white and coloured parrots,
fireflies, many-coloured dragon-flies, will come without being
asked. Palm trees&mdash;the scaly-trunked sago palm; the stately
cocoanut, queen of the tropic world; the brilliant green "fan"
palm; the incredible betel palm, with its white trunk no larger
than your neck, and seventy or eighty feet high&mdash;you will find
established on your ground when you arrive...How much do you think
it used to cost to raise those half-dozen gloomy little palms in
the steaming hot-house at the castle? How many gardeners did that
stretch of "carpet bedding" at the deanery employ?...You are a
little trader and you do a little planting, and your boots wear out
before you can afford to increase your bill at the store by fifteen
shillings for a new pair, and you have to make your dining-room
table yourself out of old packing-cases; but nobody under ten
thousand a year could match those grounds of yours at home.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>I have wandered some way from the <i>Merrie England</i> and her
tour. Breakfast is over now; the ship has been behaving very badly,
progressing for the most part "the way the divil wint through
Athlone&mdash;in shtandin' leps," with an occasional right and left
roll that shakes the passengers exactly as a gigantic terrier might
shake a rat. In consequence people are feeling "very feverish
to-day," and appetites are uncertain...Fever in Papua covers more
sins, secrets, and weaknesses than ever did the proverbial cloak of
charity. Is there a vicious roll on the steamer, and does your face
grow green as the swinging seas? You are feverish; you must go and
lie down. Have you been dining unwisely last night, and do you find
your hand unsteady and your eyes watery and your head racked with
pain next morning? Fever&mdash;you know you've got a temperature,
and you won't have any breakfast, thanks&mdash;only
soda-water&mdash;which everyone knows is good for malarial
troubles. Has your pretty <i>fiancée</i> written up from Melbourne
to say that she is tired of waiting for you, and that Mr.
Solomon-stein's attentions (Solomonstein, Aarons, Levi, and Co. own
half of Swanston Street) have met with so much approval from her
family that&mdash;that, in fact, she returns your ring and hopes
you will find someone more worthy of you?...Fever&mdash;that is
what makes you look so dark under the eyes and so sallow about the
cheeks and keeps you awake at nights for a week or two to come...at
least, you can say it is, and you will be believed, for most people
take a little fever now and then as all in the day's work, and are
almost inclined to resent the impudence of the lucky minority who
never have any. Yes, there is something to be said for even the
malarial nuisance.</p>

<p>By and by we run under the lee of the first of the Louisiade
group, and the fever patients get better with astonishing
quickness.</p>

<p>The Government yacht does not trouble much about the Louisiades
as a rule, since the natives are fairly civilised and give no
trouble; but we are on a special mission this trip. One versatile
vessel is appearing in an entirely new character&mdash;that of a
man-of-war. We are out chasing certain Japanese luggers which have
been awaking suspicion by their movements, and if we catch them we
are going to give them "what for "&mdash;that is, we shall
confiscate them, put our chief officer on one and our boatswain on
another, and tow the prizes triumphantly into Samarai.</p>

<p>What have they been doing? Well, they have been taking Papuans,
without leave or license, off to the pearling grounds at Thursday
Island; furthermore, they have walked clean through customs and
quarantine regulations wherever they have been, and recklessly
profaned the sanctities of "pratique"&mdash;an offence that only
the ocean-going traveller can appreciate at its full value. Short
shrift they will get if we catch them, armed with the full
authority of our racks of rifles and our Nordcnfeldt gun. But shall
we catch them? A pearling lugger draws little more water than a
whale-boat; we scrape the bottom at fourteen feet. What we know
about the reefs, shoals, and "vigias" on this semi-charted coast is
no small thing&mdash;more than the "B.P.'s" know&mdash;much more
than the Admiralty surveys know&mdash;but not so much by a good way
as the wily little Jap knows. That sort of thing is his speciality.
He possesses charts of the Great Barrier Reef of Australia that
make legitimate Government surveys look foolish. He knows more than
he has any business to know about Australian harbours. He could
tell the Commonwealth much that they would like to hear about the
Northern Territory and the Gulf of Carpentaria. And if we could get
hold of all the information he possesses about the dangerous,
half-charted, all unlighted and unbeaconed coasts of Papua, a great
deal of work would be saved the Survey Department of that
colony.</p>

<p>What does he want with it? Well, you must not ask me, because
you do not really want to hear&mdash;you nice people at home. He is
your ally, and your ally can do no wrong; and the colour line is a
nothing&mdash;a chimera&mdash;"an idee in folks' heads," as the
prosaic lady of Maine defined the science of psychology. Only those
people who have really met and lived among yellow and chocolate and
red and black fellow-creatures think that colour means
anything&mdash;and somehow they are always prejudiced. In the days
when I lived among white people, and white people only, myself, I
used to think that residence in the tropics destroyed anyone's
power of unprejudiced thought on these questions of colour. Now I
am prejudiced myself; I will not talk to you at all, because I know
what you feel; but I think&mdash;yes, I think very hard and very
loud indeed!</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>We did not catch those Japs&mdash;those dear little,
intelligent, gentle, open, straightforward Japs, who had doubtless
such excellent views on art, and spoke so courteously to each other
about "honourable tea." We never even caught a glimpse of their
sails in the distance; nor did anyone else, then or later. I
inclined at the time to think that they had been met and warned by
a third lugger which had put into Samarai a few days earlier, and
had been unkindly fined dig for sending its crew ashore wooding and
watering without the formality of passing the doctor...When the
Resident Magistrate reproved the captain for this lawless deed the
captain was very innocent, very sorry, very shy. He had not
understood, that was all. He did not know ships had to have papers,
had to satisfy customs and quarantine officers; he had never heard
of pratique. Pratique?...What was that word?</p>

<p>"You say you're from Thursday Island?" queried the R.M. "How
long were you there?"</p>

<p>"Fi-ive ye-ear," drawled the gentle little captain.</p>

<p>I wish I could reproduce the snort that expressed the R.M.'s
opinion of the yellow races in general, and the captain in
particular.</p>

<p>The lugger went out, warned and fined, and the two other
luggers&mdash;the really naughty ones&mdash;vanished from Papua
almost immediately after. So we did not catch them&mdash;much to my
regret; it seemed to me that it would have been the next best thing
to living in one of Marryat's novels.</p>

<p>However, our investigations took us into several places quite
off the ordinary track. Teste Island was one of these. It is a
small bit of country, two and a half miles by a quarter of a mile,
but very pretty in the South Sea style&mdash;cloud-white coral
beach, rustling, swaying palms, green lagoon, and light, bright,
flowery soil. Coral soil does not as a rule grow heavy bush, and
these islands in consequence are full of clear sunlight and gay
colouring, with scarce a shadow where you can escape from the
midday glare.</p>

<p>The orange groves were the only shady spot on Teste Island; we
coveted the golden fruit as we stood beneath the boughs, but alas!
the Hesperidean dragon, in the person of official Methodism, barred
the way. The day was Sunday; it was wicked to pick fruit on Sunday,
more wicked to sell it&mdash;the Teste Islanders would none of
us.</p>

<p>Still, the island is interesting to spend a morning in. We
walked over the little village, and saw its quaint houses, all set
up, Papuan fashion, on long wooden legs, all with transparent
floors of split sticks, cool, heavy roofs of sago thatch, and
perpendicular ladders leading up to the doors. Inside, there were
piles of fishing-nets, beautifully spun and netted out of bush
fibres, a few baskets of native make, a number of netting needles
prettily carved, some large clay pots, and in the middle of
everything, carelessly set down inside the slightest of wooden
fences, the inevitable native fire. How it is that every village in
Papua is not burned down, wholly or partially, every day in the
year, is a problem that an insurance company's secretary might find
difficulty to solve. Fires are always kept burning in the
houses&mdash;it would be hard to say what for, in a country where
cooking is only done once a day, and the temperature is like the
stokehole of an Indian liner. These fires are set on a bed of white
ashes, which in its turn apparently lies right on the fragile stick
floor, and is surrounded with inflammable things of every
kind&mdash;leaf baskets, grass skirts, wooden sleeping pillows,
etc.&mdash;the whole being roofed over by thatch, and surrounded by
walls that are crackling with inflammable dryness. A single spark
ought to set a whole village afire, and yet, somehow, it never
does, not even when the whole population goes out fishing and
leaves all the fires untended, and all the doors open. If this is
not a miracle, one would like to know what it is. It is not so
surprising after all, however, for in this impossible country
ordinary laws of nature seem the last things that can be counted
upon to act in an ordinary way.</p>

</p>

<p>The people of Teste Island wear a good deal of clothing, in some
cases, though in others the narrow native girdle is considered
enough. The women are liberally tattooed, often with considerable
art. They were curious about our ship, and interested in the call,
but obviously not unfamiliar with the ways of white people. Indeed,
there are two white men who spend most of their time on the island,
or in its vicinity&mdash;Greeks from Southern Europe, speaking no
English except a very little of the "pigeon" variety. They trade
with the natives for copra. Greeks were among the very earliest of
visitors to the island, many years before Papuan colonisation had
begun. Perhaps one of the oddest incidents of the voyage was the
little scene that took place under the palms of the village, our
chief officer, who was half Greek by descent, conversing in fluent
phrases with the two queer white wanderers, and importing a
bewildering atmosphere of scholarship and ancient colleges and
stately resounding sentences learned in the cool leisure of the old
country, long ago, when there was time for everything, into this
remote tropic island, so far away from "anywhere." No news was
derived from this "meeting of Greeks," however. Our quarry had not
been seen; and we went back to the ship unsatisfied.</p>

<p>Next day we reached another coral island, set in another
beautiful lagoon&mdash;Nivani, about the same size as Teste Island.
It was a Government station, with a resident magistrate, until a
few years ago. But it is now deserted, and the Government buildings
and jail are falling into ruin. There are a few natives on the
island cultivating the copra, which is leased to a resident in
Sud-Est. Exquisitely pretty, like all the Louisiade group, is this
little island, lying in the midst of a brilliant green lagoon,
encircled with a snowy white beach, and decked with waving palms
and feathery casuarina, one of the loveliest of tropic trees. There
are many gay red and yellow crotons in the bush, scarlet-flowered
hibiscus, too, and white and yellow flowers of several kinds.
Pawpaw grows freely, also edible nuts. The climate appears to be
good, and free from the damp heat of the mainland. This is an
example of a good many similar islands clustering about the outer
end of New Guinea, which seem to offer possibilities to the
would-be copra planter. They are the best possible places for the
cocoanut, which loves the near neighbourhood of the sea, and many
of them are already extensively planted, naturally or artificially.
A man who wished to settle down on his own plantation might do
worse than look up the available islands about the New Guinea
coast. Health is always better on the small islands than on the
mainland, and there are pleasant places to live in, not to mention
the convenience of transport of produce, as compared with inland
districts.</p>

<p>Two more islands next day of the same kind, beautiful, peaceful,
remote, full of the sound of the sea and the low murmur of palms,
and thinly inhabited by peaceful and harmless natives. Moturina and
Pana Porn-Porn it was this time. We went ashore and made the usual
grand tour, returning to the ship with a feeling of vague
dissatisfaction at the requirements of official, literary, and
business life, that forbade us one and all to buy islands and
settle down upon them, and cease from troubling about Parliaments,
or mails, or dates, or times, or seasons, any more for ever.</p>

<p>I, who had known the true island world well and long, and seen
many who realised the curiously universal dream of taking an island
to live in, as in a kingdom of their own, saw many memories flit
across the empty sky, in the long pull back to the ship...How often
in far-away Tahiti, or Samoa, or in little-known isolated groups, I
had seen that dream realised&mdash;the trader or planter settled
down in his own little country, perhaps a few acres, perhaps many
square miles in extent, with his wife and family, and his small
following of native labour, for all society, and his cutter the
only means of communication with the outside world...Were they
happy, these new Swiss Family Robinsons, in that life that so many
envy them? Yes&mdash;and no. I have heard a Fiji planter, who had
tried the life for some years, declare that no man would keep it
up, except out of interest, after the first five seasons, and that
those who were obliged to hang on were heartily sick of it. I have
known a man and his wife, used to a complex and cultured society,
perfectly happy for more than twice five years in an island
isolated from all but the rarest calls. I have known a good many
who dropped down to the level of the surrounding
natives&mdash;usually through that curse of island life, a native
marriage&mdash;and some who kept well above it, yet became
nevertheless partially unfitted for white society. On the whole,
one is compelled to allow that the ideal life on an island of one's
own does not appear to have ideal effects when translated out of
the visionary into the concrete. It is best suited to the very old
or the very young&mdash;those who have done with life, and only
desire to rest and dream until the end, or those who are still so
rich in the unspent capital of golden years that they can afford to
throw away a few on the chance that the life may really prove to be
all that they desire.</p>

<p>We returned to Samarai after a cruise of several days,
disappointed as regarded the Japs, but well pleased with what we
had seen. I cannot say exactly what lands are to let, and what are
still free among these island groups, but it may be generally
stated that there is a good deal to be had, practically without
rent (though with conditions as to improvement), and that the land
is in most cases excellent for copra. The natives of the Louisiade
group are among the most civilised in New Guinea, and have in most
cases been Christianised (more or less) for many years.</p>

</p>

<p>The Government nursery at Mike Bay, half a day's run down the
coast, had to be visited after this. Mike Bay is a very peaceful
place in these days; you could take your aged grandaunt, or your
timid sister-in-law who has never been out of her own country, and
leave her there for six months, with a comfortable certainty of
finding her all in one piece, if somewhat bored, when you returned.
It was not always so, however. Less than twenty years ago the Mike
Bay tribes used to eat any stranger who landed there; and it took
much "faithful dealing" on the part of the Government, backed up by
the Armed Native Constabulary, to improve their company manners.
Milne Bay was one of the districts where the gentle Papuan used to
roast his game alive&mdash;pig when there was nothing better, man
when he was to be had. Roasting pigs alive is an amusement by no
means extinct in the Territory even yet. The Papuan is fully alive
to the value of self-advertisement, and by simply omitting the
preliminary knock on the head, he has it in his power to let every
native for two miles around know most unmistakably that there is
going to be roast pork for dinner at a certain village by and
by&mdash;which is naturally gratifying to the village, if not to
the pork. Roasting men after the same fashion has been so sternly
discountenanced by the Government that the practice is supposed to
be extinct; although it would be hard to say what may or may not go
on in the unexplored inner country of the main ranges.</p>

<p>To Milne Bay, some time in the early nineties, came a ship with
certain sailors, and they went ashore for wood and water. One of
them was missing on the return to the boats, and the others set out
to look for him. They did not find him, and retreated disconsolate.
On the next day they hunted again; still no trace of the missing
comrade, but the sailors&mdash;rough men though they
were&mdash;were sickened and disgusted by the awful cries of a pig
which was evidently being roasted alive in the neighbourhood. Their
numbers were small, and they thought it wiser not to incense the
natives by interference, so they went back to the ship and next day
hunted again with despairing hearts...They came upon the village of
the feast unexpectedly, but they found no remains of the pig. There
had not been any pig. There had been a man&mdash;a white
man&mdash;a man whose voice they had mistaken for the voice of a
brute&mdash;their comrade.</p>

<p>Well, Milne Bay is improved since then. We went ashore and
walked to the Government station, and I got separated from the rest
of the party as usual, looking for illusory iguanas and mythical
orchids, and found them (the party) again, as usual, without
causing anxiety or feeling it. And we spent a pleasant hour or two
there looking at things nobody understood, and came back to the
<i>Merrie England</i> quite happily and safely, nothing having been
cooked but tea, and nothing eaten but ship biscuit.</p>

<p>The Government nursery&mdash;one of four&mdash;was very like the
specimen I had already seen on the Laloki River. No "frills" of any
kind&mdash;a bungalow of native materials for the curator; a few
long sheds with brushwood roots, sheltering rows and rows of neatly
labelled plants in boxes, beds, and pots; rough walks outside,
leading to little plots of industrial plants, kept ready for sale.
A useful, cheap, sensible sort of place not meant to show to
visitors. A place where you can go and buy your rubber seeds or
stumps, your hemp plants, your cocoanuts, your coffee, cotton,
spice, or drug seeds cheap and fresh, and take them down to your
plantation in good condition.</p>

<p>"Ninety-day" maize was growing here among many other plants that
illustrated the richness of the soil. Four crops a year you can
grow of this maize in suitable districts. It would be an exacting
planter who would ask more.</p>

<p>There seems to be no good reason why the Papuan planter should
not grow the food for his own labour, and avoid the heavy expense
of purchasing imported rice. At present rice is the chief food on
all plantations; but the small experiments that have been made with
maize seem to prove that the natives would rather have it, and that
they work better on this tasty and nourishing grain than on the
ordinary rice ration. Why does no one grow it on a large scale?
Apparently because all the plantations are new, and all the
planters are in a terrible hurry, and it is easier to order a
couple of hundred mats of rice from the stores at seven shillings a
mat than to sow maize, and wait three or four months for
it...Another of the "reasons why" that explain the unprofitableness
of certain profitable and promising-looking estates.</p>

<p>Another quick-change for the <i>Merrie England</i> followed our
agricultural trip. This time we were out on salvage work. One of
the Government schooners had been wrecked on a reef at the back of
nowherein-particular, and we had to get her off, or at least to see
how it could be done.</p>

<p>It was near East Cape, not far from the D'Entrecasteaux Islands,
that the schooner had come to grief. The D'Entrecasteaux, like the
Louisiades, would be regarded as a group of considerable importance
if they were situated anywhere else than off the end of this great
island-continent. Normandy is seven or eight times as big as Malta.
Ferguson would make nearly four of the Isle of Man, and there are
others in the group by no means negligible in size. But Papua does
not trouble very much about them, nor about the Bouvonloirs, the
Lusançays, the Laughlins, and other miscellaneous groups scattered
here and there. The Trobriands and the Woodlarks, on the contrary,
are much thought of; one has pearls and the other gold, and that is
something worth talking about.</p>

<p>We started out from Samarai on a squally, windy day, and made
our way through China Straits out among the D'Entrecasteaux.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust44" id="illust44"></a><img src=

</p>

<p>Very beautiful is the scenery in this remote corner of
Papua&mdash;green, forest-clad mountains rising steeply from the
stormy edge of the sea; blue vaporous peaks, four to seven thousand
feet in height, soaring away into heaven beyond. There are many
islands, too, each exquisite enough to make the beauty of miles of
coast-line, were it set by itself. But the wind and the rain, and
the ceaseless squalls, through which the ship plunged and
squattered in her own violent way, veiled most of these beauties in
driving folds of mist. The wreck was sighted late in the
day&mdash;a decent little schooner, lying comfortably on a reef in
a sheltered bay, within a cable's length of land. We tried to tow
her off, but she sank in deep water, and her latter state seemed
worse than her first. The ship could not stay to make any more
attempts at rescue, but it was arranged that the unlucky schooner
was to be refloated&mdash;with cocoanuts!&mdash;by men sent out
from Samarai, and we went on our way again. Did anyone, outside of
Papua the Peculiar, ever hear of filling the hold of a vessel with
unhusked cocoanuts, and so floating her to the surface? Yet this
has been done before in the Possession, and seems to be one of the
recognised methods of salvage.</p>

<p>The Woodlarks were our next port of call. They are a fairly
important group, consisting of one large island, 35 miles by 7, and
several islets of small area. Gold was discovered here many years
ago; and ever since there has been a fair-sized mining population,
scraping out a living somehow or other in various parts of the big
island. The death-rate among the miners in the early days was
appalling. As was the case on the notorious Mambaré River some
years later, the prospectors of Woodlark came ill-provided with
money and stores, ignorant of medicines, reckless about chills and
fever, and they paid the penalty. The place is no sanatorium at
best; under the conditions of the early gold rush it became a
death-trap from which few escaped. Health conditions are much
improved nowadays; but Woodlark has certainly given its full
contribution to the bad name that has handicapped this unlucky dog
of a Papua for so many years.</p>

<p>Woodlark has an evil reputation as an incurably rainy place, and
it fully lived up to its bad name during the three days of our
stay. The low, dark green shores were swathed in wet mist when we
came to anchor in the bay, and squall after squall of fierce rain
swept over the ship, each promising by its very violence to bring
about a "clear up," and each hopelessly failing. We went ashore in
a steady downpour, which hid everything of the scenery save a
glimpse of a long dark creek running inland, a canyon between
veritable cliffs of gloomy forest, and stumbled upon a wet clay
track to the Customs Collector's house. Papua is a place well worth
incurring any hardship or any inconvenience to see, but there are
times&mdash;yes, there certainly are&mdash;when one asks oneself
what one is doing in a country that obliges the luckless traveller
to live the most of his time afoot on slippery tracks as steep as a
roof, in a temperature like that of a Turkish bath, with
rainstorms, mud, mosquitoes, scrub itch, and ants as an almost
invariable accompaniment of the day's march. Why, or how one finds
pleasure in starting forth every morning in clean, cool clothes,
and coming back every evening a mass of heat-sodden dirt, and only
fit to go into the bath at once&mdash;why one submits tamely to an
absence of mails, news, new clothes, fresh food, amusements,
everything that makes life pleasant to live, in other
countries&mdash;and all to see a few savage cannibals in their
native homes, to visit a few gold mines, pearl fisheries,
plantations...</p>

<p>There is no answer to questions like these&mdash;only the old
illogical reply that such things arc, because they are. It may be
that the savage ancestor calls, and must be heard. It may be that
the over-flavoured, over-complicated life of cities creates an
irresistible thirst for simpler food. At all events, countries like
Papua beckon, and catch, and hold as do no others in the
world&mdash;reason or no reason.</p>

<p>The three-mile walk to the Kulumadau fields is one of the most
beautiful pieces of scenery in Papua, even in the midst of a
downpour&mdash;but it does not look healthy. The track runs across
low, inky, gluey swamps, tangled over with poisonously rich and
heavy greenery. Huge tropical trees, with heavy leaves, tower into
the black sky, and shut off half the dim light spared by the rain.
Dead logs lie across dark stagnant pools; weird fungi like the
ghosts of pale lilies star the rotting limbs of fallen trees. There
are orchids by the thousands in these forest swamps, clinging to
the immense branches that curtain the heavy sky&mdash;many of them
rare and valuable, but all hard to distinguish from one another, in
this season when flowers are comparatively few. The track is not of
the worst; one can take an occasional look round as one walks,
whereas on most Papuan paths the scenery must go unnoted if the
traveller is to keep his feet.</p>

<p>Kulumadau is a desolate-looking spot enough. The mills are not
working to-day, and the ramshackle buildings, rough tram rails, and
raw heaps of "tailings" are depressing in aspect under the gloomy
sky, without the life of passing workmen and the throbbing of
engines to enliven the place, as no doubt they do when the mines
are "going." This field, we learn, has been twelve years open, and
the best of the gold has long since been taken out of it. It has
not been worked for some time, but the two rival companies which
owned the gold-bearing district have lately amalgamated, and the
field, which is now known as the Kulumadau and Woodlark
Proprietary, is expected to do rather better.</p>

<p>A hundred and twenty acres are owned by the company. It is not
certain that the whole of the gold-bearing reef is included in this
claim; indeed, an Australian miner of much experience lately gave
it as his opinion that the reef might run right across the island.
According to the same authority, there is sure to be more in the
uncleared timber. Prospects on Woodlark, however, either here or at
the alluvial fields, are not good enough to warrant anyone in
England leaving his own country to seek his fortune there.</p>

<p>Eighty thousand tons of tailings, the relics of earlier
workings, are lying close to the mills waiting for treatment by the
cyanide process, which is expected to produce a fair return of
gold. A good quantity of concentrates have been sent down to New
South Wales, with satisfactory results. The reef at the time of my
visit was being worked at a depth of 470 feet, and producing from
five pennyweights to an ounce per ton.</p>

<p>At Busai, several miles further inland, the workings are almost
entirely alluvial. Here again the best days are over, but there is
something still to be had. The field is rather restricted, not
covering more than about one square mile. There are less than
twenty white men on it, and most of the field is owned by three of
them. These three employ 100 of the 150 boys working on the field.
No one, it seems, can make much on Busai unless he can afford to
employ a fair number of boys, as it is only the cheap Papuan labour
that makes the field payable at all. Each boy can obtain about half
a pennyweight a day, the gold running half a grain to the dish. In
the early days a great deal of rough gold was found in the coral,
under the thin surface of soil, but this has been almost all worked
out. One man was reported to be doing well out of a claim of dyke
formation, 20 feet wide, composed of quartz, gossan, and ironstone,
and producing three to ten pennyweights per ton. This was the only
claim of its kind at Busai, the rest being all surface. No
prospecting at all had been done of late, although it was thought
very possible that more gold might remain to be discovered in the
bush.</p>

<p>The health of the goldfields is good, and fever now almost
unknown.</p>

<p>The current rate of wages for native boys is 10s. per month.
Their food&mdash;rice and tinned beef&mdash;costs 8s. There seems
to be little or no trouble with the labour, the boys being
tractable and industrious, and capable of really responsible work,
such as feeding batteries, etc. The natives are well treated, and
seem to enjoy good health.</p>

<p>All this is told me by the manager of the Kulumadau mine. I do
not understand most of it, and it does not interest me in the
least. Our Australian tourist passenger, on the contrary, drinks in
every item of information he can get, and talks and listens with
sparkling eyes. I am wet and dirty and bored; I want to yawn very
badly, and when the manager takes a lump of dirty grey slag out of
the office safe and shows it to me triumphantly, saying that that
is gold, almost pure, I feel like crying. If this is a gold mine,
give me the mouth of a Cardiff coal-shaft for real interest by
preference.</p>

<p>I do not go on to Busai, and am sorry afterwards, as one always
is sorry when one has shirked a "sight," and it is too late to
repent. I go back to the beach and take the <i>Merrie England's</i>
whaleboat up the river looking for alligators. I do not know why I
am looking for them; neither myself nor any one of the "boys" has a
gun, and the "boy" who says he comes from the parts where they
catch and drag alligators out of rivers by their tails does not
seem at all anxious to sight a wicked fishy eye or a black scaly
paw among the mangrove roots, in spite of his boasting. We glide in
whispers up and down the creeks; it is intensely still and dim and
green and deathly. The trees have long mossy beards, hanging down
straight as plumb-lines. The knitted and tangled liana ropes drop
loose above the river with never a sway or quiver. The mangroves
and palms and sword-leafed pandanus are mirrored without a flaw in
the dead, still, tea-green water. One feels as if one were living
in a stereoscopic photograph roughly coloured with a wash of green
paint. The boys and I have had enough of it before very long, and
head back for the ship again. As we cross the great open lagoon,
outside a thin black streak bars the yellow reflections of the
watery sunset half a mile away. It is an alligator, at
last&mdash;hopelessly out of reach...Just like them!</p>

<p>A few days later saw the <i>Merrie England</i> dropping anchor
off the strangest, wildest, weirdest, and most remote of the many
wonderful places that we visited during that unique
voyage&mdash;Rossel Island.</p>

<p>I find it hard to say anything about Rossel Island, because the
place is such a tissue of improbabilities and
impossibilities&mdash;such a monument of the wonderful and
bizarre&mdash;that one cannot entertain even a faint hope of having
one's tale believed down in the quiet countries where things run
along the lines of the probable and ordinary. But the attempt must
be made, for no one could visit Rossel and refrain from telling
what he had seen.</p>

<p>It is the easternmost and most isolated of the Louisiade group,
eighteen miles in length, six in breadth, and extremely precipitous
in outline. Its mountains run to nearly 4000 feet in height. Mount
Rossel, the tallest, a gloomy overhanging peak, wreathed in
mysterious veils of cloud, looms high above the dark inlet in the
southern side, where at long and irregular intervals ships come to
anchor. Round about the intensely clear, intensely green deep
waters of the bay, the lesser hills stand shouldering one another
right down to the precipice edges that overhang the sea. Dark
forest cloaks the heights; white cockatoos, small as butterflies
against the towering walls of the mountain, flit and scream through
the fiery yellow green of the sunset, that fills all the hollows of
the bay with weird goblin lights and shades as we slowly steam up
to our anchorage, and let the long chains roar home. A
wicked-looking place. A place solitary, remote, un-human beyond the
power of pen to describe&mdash;a place, in brief, that only Papua
could produce.</p>

<p>A former governor, calling at Rossel in 1891, described the
natives as "the mildest, quietest, and most inoffensive in the
Possession," and characterised the anecdote (well known to all
Papua) about the eating of 326 shipwrecked Chinamen in 1858, as
incredible. The official no doubt meant well, but his stay was
extremely short, and he had no means of finding out the real state
of affairs on the island, as there was not then, nor for long
after, any white man in the place who could give information, and
the Rossel language is known to none outside the islanders
themselves&mdash;for the best of reasons, as I shall later show. We
had the advantage of a three days' stay, occupied by a grand hunt
for five murderers (whom the Governor, Judge Murray, wished to
bring to justice) and by a good deal of general investigation. In
this last we were much helped by the information given by two
Australian traders who have lived for five years alone on
Rossel&mdash;a feat never attempted before their coming, and one
which has been near costing them their lives many times. These
young men are well educated, know something of folk-lore and
ethnology, and have taken pains to find out everything possible
about the customs of the people among whom they live&mdash;in which
they differ exceedingly from the average trader. They have done
much, in a quiet way, to make the island safer both to whites and
natives than it has ever been before (which is not saying a great
deal, however), and, in the absence of all missions, have certainly
exerted a restraining and humanising influence in a place that
wants it as badly as ever did any place on the earth.</p>

<p>For the Rossel Islanders are not by any means mild and harmless.
The mistake was a pardonable one, due no doubt to the fact that
this people seldom carries arms of any kind, while the dangerous
western tribes go armed to the teeth with spears, bow and arrows,
stone axes, or European-made tomahawks. The Rossel Islanders are
small and not formidable in appearance, though their expression is
ugly, even villainous. They carry no offensive weapons as a rule,
and they do not look as if they could harm anyone, even if they
would.</p>

<p>And yet these quiet little men are among the most expert,
practised, and determined murderers in the whole world.</p>

<p>They murder a man or woman at the death of every chief. They
used until very lately to murder one man or woman for every other
who died&mdash;in consequence of which the population of the island
is very small. They murder anyone who is unpopular, anyone who
gives information to Government authorities, anyone who breaks a
taboo. If a man steals, and they do not wish to inflict the extreme
penalty on himself, they murder the woman who cooks his food. They
have tried to murder the two traders more than once, but now,
realising that these men are the sole source of their tobacco
supply, they never threaten violence. But nevertheless murder is
one of their chief occupations.</p>

<p>How is it done? In one way only. The Rossel Islanders are the
most expert smotherers ever heard of in fact or fiction. They do
not carry weapons, because they do not want them. All they need to
do when they mark down a victim is to signal to their associates,
and in an instant seven or eight of them have crowded round the
doomed man, and in utter silence, if need be, are squeezing out his
life. One holds his mouth and nose, others seize his limbs, and
when they have got him down another kneels and jumps upon his
chest. It is over in a minute&mdash;there is little struggle, no
bloodshed, no noise, but the work is done.</p>

<p>If a Rossel Islander wants a pigeon for supper he has no need of
bow or spear. He waits till dusk, and then steals out to a tree
where a row of sleepy pigeons or parrots are dozing on a branch.
Noiselessly as a cat he climbs the tree, and far more noiselessly
than any beast seizes and smothers one bird after the other,
without even disturbing the rest, until he has as many as he wants.
He will even paddle out to a rock in mid-ocean and smother the
sea-birds roosting on it before they wake...Truly, a man of strange
accomplishments.</p>

<p>When the "mild and gentle" Rossel Islander does not wish to kill
or eat his victim at once, but merely desires to secure him, he and
his satellites bend the wretch's limbs one after another back over
a log or a large stone, breaking all his arm and leg bones, so that
he cannot escape. There is a good deal of cannibalism still in the
island, though not so much as there was four or five years ago,
when the men employed by the trader to cut copra for him used
sometimes to come to work smelling hideously of decayed human flesh
after a feast held the night before. Sinister indeed, at the death
of a chief, are the looks cast by the relatives and mourners at one
another, before the victim of the funeral feast is fixed on. No one
knows who will be sacrificed, and the savages wander about eyeing
one another suspiciously and nervously for hours. There is not one
of them who has not many a time choked the life out of warm,
palpitating flesh, and eaten of that very flesh after; but bold as
they are when handed together like wolves, they are, like wolves,
cowards alone, and afraid of the pack...By and by it is noticed
that the glances of the crowd fall oftener on a certain man or
woman than any other. The creature thus singled out sees it, and
makes frantic efforts to divert attention to someone else, well
knowing what will follow. He may succeed, or he may
not&mdash;probably not, for every man is so anxious for himself
that the first sign of general consent is hailed as a deliverance
by all but the victim. The wretched creature turns to run, and the
pack are on him in an instant. Not to catch him,
however&mdash;there would be little sport in that&mdash;but to hunt
him, and run him down by degrees. They will even give him a start,
let him away, and perhaps not attempt to catch him for a day or so,
until they are fairly ready, and then the whole tribe joins in,
each man spurred on by the deadly fear that the fickle crowd may
turn and fix on himself, and there is hunting over hill and gully,
across river and over crocodile-haunted swamp, hour after hour,
until at last the quarry is run down, and the deadly circle of the
smotherers, of which he has so often made a part, closes round
himself at last, once and for all.</p>

<p>The story of the Chinamen, according to the islanders
themselves, is not fiction, but truth. They are fond of relating it
as one of the great deeds of their ancestors, and fairly glory in
the tale. In 1858, a shipload of Chinamen was being taken down to
Australia. The vessel was wrecked upon a reef close to Rossel
Island. The officers escaped in boats, but were never afterwards
heard of. As for the Chinamen, numbering 326, the natives captured
them, and put them on a small barren island, where they had no
food, and no means of getting away. They kept their prisoners
supplied with food from the mainland, and every now and then
carried a few of them away to eat, until all but one old man had
been devoured. This last succeeded eventually in getting away, and
told something of the story, which seems to have met with general
disbelief. Truc it is, however, on the evidence of the sons of
those who did the deed.</p>

<p>Moreover, the natives of the surrounding islands say that during
the years following the shipwreck, the Rossel Islanders were fond
of bringing Chinamen about in their boats, hawking them like pigs
among the cannibals of other places, and that quite a large number
were sold in this way. Adele Island, at present uninhabited, was
the prison of the unlucky Celestials, whose fate was surely hard
enough to draw a sigh of pity even from Australians of to-day,
little cause as they have to like the race.</p>

<p>For years after this wreck&mdash;indeed, until quite recent
times&mdash;the Rossel Islanders had a large quantity of coin in
their possession, both gold and silver, which they were willing to
barter with stray traders for a stick or two of tobacco, at any
time. There is a persistent tradition that the safe of the ship,
which the islanders never succeeded in opening, is still hidden
somewhere in the bush, but no one has ever seen it.</p>

<p>The murder which the <i>Merrie England</i> had called to
investigate was not quite of the usual kind. It would be
impossible, in the present state of Rossel, to inflict punishment
on the natives for every act of violence among themselves, and, if
it were possible, it would be undesirable. But in this case a boy
had been killed for venturing to come down and inform the trader of
a double smothering up in the mountains, when a chief and his wife
were slain, on account of some local quarrel. In consequence, the
island was in a state of unrest, threatening to throw off the mild
influence of the two white men, and breathing possibilities of more
sinister things, when the big steamer that they were afraid of
should have gone.</p>

<p>Now, it is not good that a native should be killed because he
has appealed for protection and help to a white man. Moreover, a
little check to the murderous instincts of the natural Papuan is to
be commended, when possible. So the village constable (there are
two on the island, Papuans both), with a force of twenty
volunteers, set out to try and capture the offenders. The island is
a big one, a mass of steep hills, deep gullies, and dense bush. The
murderers had many friends, and the time available for capture was
very short. In spite of all these disadvantages, the natural
hunting instinct of the Rossel Islander triumphed, and in two days
the five men who were "wanted" had been brought down to the coast
under an escort by this time increased to forty. The islanders had
no scruples whatever about joining in the hunt or giving over their
countrymen to justice. Anything that involved the chasing of a man
was good enough for them. They would have liked to smother and eat
the prisoners, certainly, instead of tamely giving them up to the
Government, but there was consolation for this loss in the trade
goods given to them as payment for their two days' work. Decked out
in new red calicoes, with tobacco in their pouches, and beads round
their necks, they went their way back to the mountains, wishing, no
doubt, that a Government man-hunt might come their way every day,
yet nevertheless resolved not to take part in one as the quarry, if
they could reasonably avoid it. The murderers were ironed, and
removed to the ship, previous to trial at Samarai. They will
probably, if convicted, suffer a term of imprisonment lasting some
years, and will be employed during that time on road-making or
clearing work. Apart from the useful lesson conveyed by the loss of
liberty they will benefit considerably by the healthy life and
regular food, and will, no doubt, return to Rossel at least
partially civilised.</p>

<p>During the two days' wait the ship party amused themselves
visiting some of the bush villages, although the
weather&mdash;windy, stormy, and wet&mdash;was rather a serious
drawback. On one morning, after a long row across a wide, beautiful
bay, overhung with tall green peaks, the Governor, myself, and
three or four others, landed upon a narrow strip of beach, with a
dense, wet, tangled mass of tropical forest rising up almost out of
the water, and started for one of the Rossel villages, two or three
hundred feet above. We were only accompanied by our boat boys, but
it was not considered that we ran any danger, as this murderous
little people are not fond of open attack.</p>

<p>The pathway was, as usual, a mere streak of slippery clay
embedded in the bush, blocked everywhere by fallen logs and
crossing streams, and infested by ants. It wound upwards so sharply
as to try the wind of the party a little, at the pace set to the
native guides by the energetic Governor. On the top of the hill it
opened suddenly out into a little space covered by
houses&mdash;three or four, no more&mdash;and overlooking the sea
and the approaches on each side, after a fashion that suggested a
desire to avoid surprise visits.</p>

<p>They had certainly succeeded in avoiding ours. The village was
all but deserted. Only a couple of men who had been in contact with
white people often enough to know that no harm was probably meant
them, stood their ground, and waited to see what could be obtained
in the way of tobacco from the new-comers.</p>

<p>And here we came upon the second of the incredibilities of
Rossel. The smothering talcs had been the first. Now we were to
find&mdash;as we found elsewhere on the coasts, and as we should
have found even in the hidden villages of the almost unknown
interior&mdash;that the natives nearly all spoke English!</p>

<p>To be addressed in reasonably good English of the "pidgin"
variety, by hideous savages who made murder a profession, and had
never come into actual contact with civilisation, is an experience
perplexing enough to make the observer wonder if he is awake. Yet
that is what happens on Rossel Island. English is the "lingua
franca" of the place, filling up the gaps&mdash;and they are
many&mdash;in the hideous snapping, barking dialect that passes for
speech along the coast, and making communication possible among the
tribes of the interior, who vary so much in language that many of
them cannot understand each other. How did this come about? I
fancy, through the unsatisfactory nature of the Rossel dialects.
Any that we heard were scarcely like human speech in sound, and
were evidently very poor and restricted in expression. Noises like
sneezes, snarls, and the preliminary stages of
choking&mdash;impossible to reproduce on paper&mdash;represented
the names of villages, people, and things. Of verbs we could find
no trace, though they may exist. Most of the words are
monosyllabic, and nearly all are spoken from far back in the
throat. A good deal of information was given us by a young person
enjoying the name "Tnmagh" (pronounced in one syllable), who spoke
more English than the others. Tnmagh had been away in a recruiting
ship, and knew something of the mind of the white man. Some boys,
he told us, had learned English in the same way as himself, and
when they returned to Rossel they taught it to the rest. The Rossel
folk, who are not deficient in brains, whatever one may say as to
their morals, recognised at once that here was a means of
communicating with each other simply, easily, and clearly (for
there is no tongue in the world than can be learned so rapidly as
"pidgin English"), and acquired the new language from each other so
quickly that there is now scarce a village where you cannot find
one or two English-speaking natives.</p>

<p>Shock number three came when we began to examine the houses.
They were neat little structures enough, made of plaited palm and
thatch, set up on tall stilts after the usual Papuan fashion, to
avoid nocturnal visits from alligators, and closed from wind and
rain with palm-leaf doors. Most had a little front verandah, so
deep as to form a sort of porch. Within, nothing of interest was
found except some plaited baskets, and a number of ebony lime
sticks with carved handles, looking exactly like ornamental paper
knives. These lime sticks have flat blades, and are used for mixing
and spooning out the lime chewed with betel nut. The heads of the
sticks are generally carved into grotesque semblances of human
faces, and sometimes into rough likenesses of pigeons or parrots. A
stick or two of tobacco readily purchases any one of them.</p>

<p>But it was not the lime sticks so much as the general
surroundings of the houses that puzzled and amused. These
professional murderers, with the tongues of brutes and the morals
of sharks, are very fond of gardening, and plant pretty red,
yellow, and pink flowers about their houses with considerable
effect. They keep pet cats, which are sleek and well-fed looking.
"You ki-ki (eat) that fellow pussy?" we asked. "No! no ki-ki
pussy&mdash;he good fellow," was the astounding answer. Not content
with landscape gardening, studying foreign languages, wood carving,
and keeping pets, they display further evidences of a taste for the
"gentle life" by going constantly provided with fine toilet
sponges, which they procure themselves from the reef, carry round
their waist in bags, and use to wash their faces!</p>

<p>After this, one was prepared for anything, and it was only
mildly astonishing to stumble across a dead insect in the pathway
exactly like a black crayfish, some eight inches long, and to hear
that this gruesome creature&mdash;one of the stick insect
family&mdash;was common in the trees, and was boiled and eaten by
the natives as food. Like a crayfish, it turns red when cooked.</p>

<p>Nor were we much amazed, lower down, in a very wretched, dirty,
ill-built village on the coast, to discover a native drill, made of
stick, string, and shell, with extreme ingenuity, and capable of
boring holes in stone. The inventor&mdash;who must be a Stephenson
or an Edison among Rossel Islanders&mdash;was quite ready to accept
a stick of tobacco, value three-halfpence, for his really wonderful
achievement; but its purchaser, in a fit of generosity, insisted on
giving him six times what he asked.</p>

<p>At the foot of the hill we found another of the surprises of
Rossel&mdash;a mint, no less. This island is especially rich in the
shell from which the native money of Papua is manufactured&mdash;a
bivalve two or three inches across with a rim of rich deep red
inside the lip, and a layer of the some colour underneath the white
lining or the shell itself. Papuan money consists of certain small
button-shaped objects, bored through the middle, cut out of this
red part of the shell, and commonly worn or carried in long
strings. The natives value it more than anything else that can be
offered to them, and many of the white traders use it in preference
to European money for purchasing copra or pearlshell, or even
pearls. Each disc is worth about threepence, and a man can cut out,
shape, and finish something like a dozen in a day. The trader
resident on Rossel has instituted a mint on a small scale, where he
employs the natives making money for him, when he has no other work
for his indentured boys. It is only a shed, where the shells are
cut up, shaped, and bored, but it is certainly interesting as
another of Rossel's curiosities.</p>

<p>On board the ship in the evening someone asked the native
policeman what the numerals in Rossel dialect were. He gave them
readily enough, but hesitated at the number seven. You might not
always say that number, he explained&mdash;sometimes it brought on
thunderstorms if you did. And you must never say it at all when you
went to Adele Island to get cocoanuts or fish, because the most
frightful results would undoubtedly follow. In any case, when a
Rossel Islander went over to Adele he used a different language all
the time he was on that island.</p>

<p>Why? Were there natives on Adele who spoke differently?</p>

<p>Oh, no, it was uninhabited; but you must talk a different
language there&mdash;it was the custom.</p>

<p>This, of course, is an interesting instance of a language
surviving the people who once used it. There were no doubt formerly
natives on Adele who spoke a tongue different from those of Rossel,
and the Rossel fishing parties still keep up its use through a
blind tradition...There are traces among the islanders, too, of a
separate language used by men only, and forbidden to the women on
pain of death...Why does not some man of science come up to the
Louisiades and investigate the many mysteries of Rossel? It would
certainly be found a mine of strange and valuable ethnological
discovery.</p>

<p>I do not expect that anyone will believe me when I say that in
the neighbourhood of Rossel, and further west, both I and other
members of the party saw fish about two or three feet long, which
run along the top of the water for a considerable distance on the
tips of their tails&mdash;but it is nevertheless true. Why they do
it&mdash;unless possibly to escape from enemies down below; and
more especially how they do it&mdash;I could not undertake to say.
It is not the leap of a flying fish, for it does not clear the
water. The fish simply speeds along through the air, keeping the
flukes of its tail only under the surface. It does not appear to
turn, which the flying fish does. It is common about the
Louisiades, on shallow shores, where seaweed grows thickly just
under water. If any zoologist can explain this fish I hope he
will&mdash;obvious explanation of the profane vulgar need not be
advanced, as the <i>Merrie England</i> is a temperance ship, so far
as her passengers are concerned.</p>

<p>From Rossel we went on to Tagula, or Sud-Est, where more strange
experiences were awaiting us.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="caption">Sud-Est and its Queen&mdash;Historic jewels of

Silence&mdash;Too good to be true&mdash;The curious

Moresby.</p>

<p>AFTER leaving the incredible island of Rossel we turned back in
the direction of civilisation again, and ran to Sud-Est, another of
the Louisiades, distant a few hours' steaming. A long, dark blue
mountainous coast stretched out before us as the <i>Merrie
England</i> picked her way cautiously among the many coral reefs
surrounding the shore. Sud-Est is more than forty miles in length,
and as unlike to the gloomy, evil island of Rossel as day to night.
Grassy, rolling downs slope above the sea as one approaches; a
coral jetty runs out into the bay; there are houses and sheds on
the hill above. A cheerful, homelike place, this Sud-Est, and it is
what it appears to be.</p>

<p>The island is nominally, no doubt, owned and governed by the
Commonwealth, but morally it is the property of the Queen of
Sud-Est, and of no one else. Mrs. Mahony, the adventurous
Australian who bears this title, has been on the island, with an
occasional holiday, for twenty years. She came up from Queensland
with the first of the Papuan gold-rushes, when there was only one
other white woman&mdash;a missionary's wife&mdash;in the whole of
the Possession. She lived through the exciting and perilous days of
those early times, always respected and deferred to by the roughest
of the miners, from her innate force of character, and when the
fields of Sud-Est became almost exhausted, and the whites went
away, she still remained with her husband and children, and
administered justice and order to the natives with a strong hand.
In consequence the island presents a picture of industry, peace,
and safety that is little short of amazing, considering the fact
that it lies far out of the range of ordinary Government influence,
and has never been touched by missionary effort. The large native
population is, almost to a man, gold-mining. Where the white man
has given up, the Papuan still finds enough to make gold-washing a
profitable profession. The popular idea that the "nigger" is
necessarily a lazy creature unless forced to work by whites finds
little justification on Sud-Est. This island, indeed, furnished
some of the most instructive sidelights on Papuan character that I
met with in all my journeyings about the Possession.</p>

<p>If the Papuan has sufficient motive he will work, and not only
for short periods, but steadily and continuously for years.</p>

<p>When he makes a little money he spends it very wisely, all
things considered. Contact with white people, knowledge of the
English tongue, and of the habit of steady work, with its attendant
advantages of constant food supply and useful exercise, all tend to
make the Papuan healthy, decent, and peaceful.</p>

<p>These are the lessons of Sud-Est, where, owing to peculiar
circumstances, the effects of generations of training have been
compressed into a single quarter of a century.</p>

<p>As to proofs, they are plentiful. The natives of Sud-Est live,
and have lived since the departure of the miners, almost altogether
by gold-washing. They are industrious, and work hard. Almost every
man has his own scales, and weighs out his gold to the minuest
grain, carefully and accurately, before he takes it to the store to
purchase food or tobacco or tools. There are about a thousand
natives on the island altogether. During the days of the gold rush
there were over six hundred white miners, and Sud-Est was not by a
long way so healthy as it is to-day.</p>

<p>There is still malaria, but it is not of the worst kind, and
both whites and natives now seem to enjoy good health.</p>

<p>Crime is almost unknown on Sud-Est, though there is no settled
system of government other than a very rare visit from a
magistrate. The lives of the half-dozen white residents are as safe
as they would be in Sydney. The Sud-Est boys are in considerable
request as labourers when they can be induced to engage, and many
of them have a fair amount of property in goods and native
jewellery, such as armshells and shell money.</p>

<p>English is spoken all over Sud-Est. The early miners were
probably the first to introduce the British tongue, which was so
obviously superior to the cumbrous local language that it
immediately took root and flourished; but the most important
influence in that direction has undoubtedly been the rule of the
"Queen." Mrs. Mahony's system of teaching English to the natives
has been marked from the first by the double merits of simplicity
and effectiveness. Her store and enclosure were, and are, the
general rendezvous of all the natives, for business, shopping, or
even amusement, as when the "Queen" gives a royal feast to three or
four hundred of her subjects, simply to promote harmony and
goodwill. It is easy to understand that no Sud-Estian would like to
lose the right of entry to this enchanted ground, and therein lies
the strength of Mrs. Mahony's educational method. For whenever a
single word of Sud-Est is spoken within the limits of her
enclosure, no matter why, or by whom, the "Queen" issues forth in
all the majesty of her six feet of height, and promptly runs the
offender out. If you cannot or will not talk English inside the
royal grounds you have to hold your tongue on Sud-Est. In
consequence, the island language is rather less spoken than the
foreign tongue to-day, and the natives are practically all
bilingual.</p>

<p>There is not much loss in this, except to philologists searching
for something unique in the way of languages. The tongue of Sud-Est
is to the full as awkward, inexpressive, and inharmonious as that
of Rossel, though in a different way. Where the Rossel man speaks
in monosyllabic grunts and gasps, the Sud-Estian talks in words of
amazing length linked together by endless repetitions. The name of
a village near the coast was given to us by the English-speaking
village constable as "Vanamanamandawa." "Finger" was
"namandagugyie"; "head," "mbalunda"; and the simple sentence "give
me a lock of your hair," translated by the constable, expanded
itself into "Waw ma mwunu umbaludawuluwuluye"&mdash;the last and
most amazing word representing "hair." As a member of our party
remarked, it would save time to take it without asking.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mahony was absent at the time of our call, much to the
regret of the party; but we were hospitably entertained in her
house, and shown many local curios. Shell money is among the most
interesting of these. Mrs. Mahony is one of the largest purchasers
of the Rossel shells from which the money is made, as already
described. Native armlets also, carved out of a single large white
shell, thick and firm as a slab of marble, bring an amazing price
among the natives, and are profitable to trade in. A native will
often engage in plantation or carrier work on the mainland for two
years, in order to have the money to purchase a pair of these
ornaments, which are kept by almost all traders, though they are of
purely native manufacture. A fairly good pair will cost three or
four pounds, and the prices range upward from this comparatively
modest sum, to the twenty and thirty pounds sometimes given by a
sort of native syndicate, for a pair of really famous bracelets,
known to half the Possession, and named, as all the celebrated
shell armlets are. The love of these ornaments amounts to a passion
with the Papuan, and can be compared to nothing but the American
woman's fancy for big and historical diamonds. As our own famous
gems are named "The Koh-i-Noor," "The Sancy," "The Pitt," "The
Cullinan," so the Papuan shell armlets of unusual size and
thickness have their native names, known to everyone, and bringing
celebrity and distinction to the possessor of the jewel wherever he
goes throughout the whole extent of Papua.</p>

<p>Some of these facts were given me later on by a well-known
trader in another part of the Possession, but as Sud-Est is one of
the chief markets of native jewellery, I have mentioned them
here.</p>

<p>Misima, or St. Aignan, was the next call. We had, again, only a
few hours to run, as the islands of the Louisiade group are fairly
close together. Starting at daybreak, we found ourselves by
breakfast time anchored surprisingly close to a brilliant coral
shore, backed with stately, plumy cocoanut palms, and almost
covered with close serried rows of the most wonderful canoes that I
have yet seen, even in this country of curious boat-building. They
were fully forty feet long, and some were deep enough to conceal a
man standing upright within. Most were partly decked with platforms
of woven cane, and all were built up in several sections,
commencing with a deep keel cut out of one huge tree trunk, and
spreading out above to a considerable width. They fronted the
burning sea proudly, with their high carved prows, like the beaked
war-vessels of the ancient Norsemen; their gunwales were gay with
chains and inlayings of dazzling shells; and the paintings in red
and white and black, of crocodiles, parrots, pigs, fish, and men,
that adorned the bows and stern, and ran along the sides in bands,
were a wonder to see.</p>

<p>We tried to purchase some of the detachable ornaments, made of
carved and painted wood, that were stuck in various prominent parts
of the canoes; but their owners, a rather ugly and stupid-looking
set of natives, refused to trade in anything that we could offer.
So the party divided and went inland, some to shoot parrots and
pigeons, some (and those not among the wise ones) to follow the
Lieutenant-Governor on one of his visits of inspection and
investigation. As His Excellency usually set a pace of anything
from four and a half to five and a half miles an hour (a gait
rather trying in hot, wet jungle, and over rough hill tracks, in a
latitude only six degrees south of the line), his division was not
popular on the line of march, and often enough consisted of himself
and one agitated native servant, trotting in front, and extremely
anxious to uphold the honour of his service and his race, without
in consequence missing the track or getting badly "winded." In the
second division, as a rule, followed the rest of the <i>Merrie
England</i> party, taking life easily, and wondering audibly what
our gigantic chief was made of.</p>

<p>In this instance, two separate sections got left, lost, and
finally united. Parrot-shooting&mdash;and such parrots! green,
yellow, red, pink, blue, purple, and black, all combined on the one
bird&mdash;passed a pleasant hour or two; exploring trips up
abandoned gold workings filled in the balance of the morning. St.
Aignan, like Sud-Est, has been worked out, and only provides the
slenderest living for the seven or eight white men who still cling
to the island.</p>

<p>There were three white women not long ago, but there is only one
now. Thereupon depends a story&mdash;one of the strange, true,
unbelievable stories of Papua, which he who likes may credit.</p>

<p>A white woman lived here on Misima, far away from the remotest
echoes of civilisation, for many years, with her husband, who was
one of the early miners. He died, and she kept on his claim, though
she was now very old, and worked it herself. After some years of
this strange, lonely life, the old lady became ill, and had to go
down to Queensland to see a doctor. While there, regaining her
health, she made up her mind to endure her solitary life no longer,
but to bring back with her to Misima a companion who would share
her labours and profits, and lighten the dullness of existence on
that uttermost isle. She chose, not a second husband, not a young
woman, but another white-haired old lady of her own age, one who
had been left ill off, and feared a life of dependence. In the
quiet home lands, an old lady who has lived her life and become
conservative and stiff in mind and body looks for an almshouse or
"institution" to end her days in, if she is ill provided with means
of support, or at most seeks a position as chaperon or caretaker or
companion. They do things differently in Queensland. The ancient
dame selected by the heroine of Sud-Est answered gallantly to the
call, and the two old women actually set out for the wilds of Papua
together, travelling by steamer to Samarai, and thence, some days
in a risky little cutter, to Misima. Arrived there, they went on
working the first old woman's claim, and lived decently on what
they made, asking help from no one, self-respecting, industrious,
and independent.</p>

</p>

<p>I should have liked well to meet these two plucky old
Australians, and had been looking forward to my visit to Misima for
that reason. But it was not to be. Only a week or two before the
two good comrades had died, mostly of old age and infirmity, it was
thought, and within a few hours of each other. They rest where they
laboured, on Misima, far away in the Ultima Thule of outermost
Papua, brave women of a brave race, who owed naught to anyone, in
life or death.</p>

<p>We were bound for the Trobriands now, calling here and there on
the way. The track lay among many islands, all beautiful, and most
of them interesting. Time did not permit the yacht to stop, as a
rule, but there were strange stories to be heard about some of
these out-of-the-way little spots.</p>

<p>The Bosanquet group&mdash;a mere handful of small islets and
sand-cays&mdash;was passed one afternoon near sundown. Our captain
ran the ship close by Sim-Sim, the chief island of the group, in
order to let us have a good look at it. Sim-Sim is worth looking
at, for it has worked out for itself what is surely the most
extraordinary social system ever heard of, even in Papua the
Impossible.</p>

<p>It consists of twin islands, not more than a few acres in
extent, separated from each other by a wide strait of deep water.
In the centre of the larger island rises an extinct volcanic
crater, with great forest trees, and slopes of green grass
appearing inside the cup. This is much the prettier island of the
two; its palms are taller and thicker, its beach wider, its grassy
slopes richer than those of the sister islet, which is,
nevertheless, a picturesque place enough.</p>

<p>...Did the reader, in the days when Plancus was consul, and
summer nights were full of the scent of roses, and the rustle of
tulle and silken skirts, and the swinging
"one&mdash;two&mdash;three" of "White Heather," or
"Estudiantina"&mdash;when rustic seats in moonlit gardens beckoned
insistently, and curtained bow-windows were magnetically
attractive, and <i>the</i> place to see the race of the day somehow
always seemed to be the back of the grand stand&mdash;did he or
she, in those pleasant, miserable days, ever wish
hopelessly&mdash;as one wishes for a million of money, or for
heaven&mdash;for an island somewhere in the South Seas upon which
the heavy foot of the chaperon should never have been set, and over
whose flowery shores the baleful light of her inescapeable
spectacles never should have shone? Well, here it is, here in the
Pacific Ocean, off the coast of Papua, in the Bosanquet group, and
its name is Sim-Sim.</p>

<p>They understand the art of gathering the roses while they may in
Sim-Sine. On the pretty island the big, flowery, palmy island, with
the extinct crater-cup in its centre, lives the youth of Sim-Sim.
On the other, the decent, rather prosaic, rather inferior island,
live the old people. They are well treated, but kept in their
place, and not allowed to spoil sport. The young people do not want
them, have no use for them, and let them see it. They, the young
ones, can amuse each other; the time will come soon enough when
they will have to cross the strait and leave the volcano island,
with its green romantic dells and long white beaches, for the
middle-aged place that is not half so pretty&mdash;but in the
meantime they pluck the fruit of the flying hour, and find the
world is good.</p>

<p>The captain tells us that if you land on Sim-Sim you are
instantly surrounded by a cloud of sea-birds and cockatoos, which
light on your hands and head, scream in your face, and generally
make themselves very much at home with the visitor. These are the
island pets and watch-dogs. The natives tame them, partly for
amusement, partly to provide an incorruptible guard for the islands
at night. Cockatoos sleep with one ear and one eye open, and have
the useful habit of making night hideous with bloodcurdling yells
if strangers are heard approaching.</p>

<p>We were all sorry we could not call at Sim-Sim, but you have to
be careful about where you find yourself when dark comes down off
these half-surveyed Papuan coasts. So we kept on our way, and got
out of the tangle of reefs and islets and cays while there was
still light enough to tell a coral "horse-head" from a floating
mass of seaweed.</p>

<p>It was really the Voyage of Maeldune, or something very much
like it. "We came to the Island of Silence" next day&mdash;a
far-out bit of the Bonvouloir group, where nobody lives, or ever
has lived. There were three islands fairly near to one another,
real "desert islands," without even a name to a single one of them.
The first was a high island, standing up some hundreds of feet out
of the calm blue sea. It was sheer cliff all
round&mdash;snowy-white coral cliff, garlanded with long green
vines dropping down to the water's edge. On the top there were
trees and bushes, and a tangle of lianas and trailers of many
kinds. One might have got up, with the help of the creepers and the
projecting spurs of coral, but it would have been a risky business
at best, and all the <i>Merrie England's</i> passengers declared
(after the captain had thrown certain sailorly obstacles in the way
of a call) that they did not want to land there&mdash;which was
untrue.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust46" id="illust46"></a><img src=
"1501051h-images/TNNG-46.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=
"Illustration">
</p>

<p>The two other unnamed islands now came in sight, two vivid
bouquets of foliage set in the midst of a grass-green lagoon, and
fenced round from the blue deep sea beyond, by the ruffle of the
foamy coral-reef. Here we absolutely demanded that the <i>Merrie
England</i> should be stopped and a boat sent ashore. One of the
guests from Australia wanted a desert island, and he had fallen in
love with the Isles of Silence at first sight.</p>

<p>So we rowed through the opening in the reef, across the lagoon
(which was pale pea-green in colour, with heliotrope reflections),
over two or three many-coloured water gardens of growing coral,
with striped and painted fish darting through, and up to a beach
the colour and consistence of fine white table-salt. Here we
landed, and instantly began to overrun the place. We were
aggrieved&mdash;though I do not know why&mdash;to find one or two
ruined palm-leaf huts on the shore, and we were somewhat consoled
when somebody told us that the huts were doubtless mere shelters
for natives who might camp on the island during the long canoe
voyage from the Bonvouloirs to the Trobriands.</p>

<p>The island proved to be much bigger than it looked from the sea.
Two lots of the visitors got lost in its woods and did not
disentangle themselves for an hour or more. There were open spaces
of green grass and pink flowers shut in by tall forest trees; there
were dense dark recesses with scarce a ray of light, and swampy
ferny places where the tracks of wild pigs were plain, and
sparse-growing brakes where the sun shone through, and the white
columns of the coco-palms shot freely skyward, and the sparkle of
the cool, salt, tumbling sea flickered low among the leaves, a long
way away. There were sites that simply cried out for a house, and
creeks and coves that looked painfully empty without a boat. There
was a beach where you could take a long jump off the sand into
eight feet of liquid beryl. There was...</p>

<p>"I shall have this place," said the visitor from Australia,
determinedly. "It's got tons and tons of copra already, and I'll
plant more. I'll keep a cutter to run to Samarai in a couple of
days when I want. I'll bring my brother out, and we'll build a
house and be kings of the place. One couldn't wish it better if it
had been made to order&mdash;it's almost too good."</p>

<p>Alas, it was quite too good! for when we got back to Samarai, we
found that among the latest applications for land received by the
Government was one from a schooner captain applying for the two
little islands in the lagoon. And so the Australian's vision
faded.</p>

<p>The Trobriands lay before us after this&mdash;one big and
several little islands about a couple of hundred miles distant from
Samarai. The Trobriands are always supposed to be one of the most
interesting places in Papua; they are certainly among the most
civilised. If I did not find them as fascinating as the wild and
wicked West, that was probably because they reminded me too much of
the South Sea island life with which I was so familiar, and
therefore lacked the charm of novelty.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust47" id="illust47"></a><img src=
"1501051h-images/TNNG-47.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=
"Illustration">
</p>

<p>The people of the Trobriands are of the Polynesian type rather
than the Papuan. Their hair is less woolly than that of the
mainland tribes; they arc ruled by chiefs who exercise authority
over large districts, and they are not, and never have been,
cannibal. In Papua proper, the "chief" idea is almost non-existent,
unimportant village headmen being the nearest approach to it that
one is likely to meet. But there is a real aristocracy in the
Trobriands which counts generations of descent, and is physically
better developed than the commonalty.</p>

<p>The Trobriand native is fairly good-looking, and much given to
ornamenting himself with pearl and other shells, dog's teeth, shell
beads, and money, and chains of coloured seeds. The men are almost
altogether unclothed; the women wear the grass petticoat. Trobriand
houses are beautifully and elaborately built, set on high piles,
with ornamented roofs and gables, and they often contain curios
worth getting, for the Trobriander is something of an artist, and
carves human and animal figures in wood with considerable
skill.</p>

<p>The totem idea is strong in these islands. Each tribe has its
guardian beast, fish, or bird, which is regarded as sacred, and
never eaten by any member of the clan. Pigeons, parrots, and
fish-hawks are among the best known of the totems. One notices
paintings of birds and fish on the outside of the houses, which
have doubtless some connection with the ruling totems.</p>

<p>A long walk through Kitava, the biggest island, was practically
all I saw of this interesting group. The distance was under eleven
miles, but, with halts and delays of one kind and another, our
party took nearly all day to do it.</p>

<p>It began with a scramble up a nightmare staircase some 300 feet
high, partly natural and partly artificial, composed of the coral
foundation of the island in its rise from the sea. Walking on coral
of any kind is very like walking on a pavement of petrified Turkey
sponges, every point as hard or sharp as a steel pen. In this
instance, the difficulty was added to by the piled-up blocks of the
"staircase," which obliged one to lift one's feet waist-high at
every step, after the manner of tourists climbing the pyramids of
Cheops.</p>

<p>Arrived at the top, there were the usual sloping muddy tracks,
leading from village to village; yam gardens, immense in extent and
beautifully kept and fenced; natives here and there, not at all
scared (since white people have often visited the Trobriands), but
very eager to do a good bit of bargaining if it came to curio
buying; the quaint, elegantly built little towns; the staring,
crowding women, half-timid, half-curious; the rattle of small naked
boys, determined to follow our party from end to end of the island,
if necessary&mdash;all the familiar scenes of island life as I had
known it in the South Sea world.</p>

<p class="cp"><a name="illust48" id="illust48"></a><img src=
"1501051h-images/TNNG-48.jpg" alt="Illustration" title=
"Illustration">
</p>

<p>There were novelties, however. The fishing kites that they
eagerly offered for sale were not like anything in "<i>the</i>
islands "; nor does one, in the South Seas, see a disconsolate
parent going about with the jawbone of his deceased child hung like
a locket round his neck&mdash;a common practice in Kitava. Nor yet,
in all the South Sea world, shall you have enormous red-back
spiders, as big as small birds and as poisonous as snakes, offered
you&mdash;alive&mdash;as valuable and desirable curiosities.</p>

<p>The kites were really wonderful. They were made of dried banana
leaves stretched on twigs, and attached to neat coils of fine
native-made twine. At the other end of the twine was an object
somewhat resembling a tennis racquet, strung across with a mass of
yellow, strong, silky net, which is obtained by twirling the frame
round and round in one of the great bush-spider's webs. This frame
is left to trail loose in the water, while the kite is flown above
the sea. Small fish come after it and strike their teeth into the
web, which entangles them and holds them long enough for the
watching Trobriander to haul in his line and secure the booty
before it gets away. A long thick tassel of twisted spiders' webs
is sometimes trailed in the water instead of the frame, with the
same result.</p>

<p>There are native fruits in the Trobriands unlike those that one
sees elsewhere. One that we sampled during the day was like a very
large apple, firm and cool, with a taste suggestive of lemons and
fresh butter. Another&mdash;also somewhat like an apple&mdash;was
white-fleshed and juicy, but of a peculiar and deadly sweetness
that cloyed the palate hopelessly after a couple of mouthfuls.
Short of saccharine itself, one could scarcely find a parallel for
the amazing sweetness of this island fruit.</p>

<p>We had tea at the Resident Magistrate's bungalow, and heard his
opinion of the Trobriands and their people generally. The
population is diminishing here, though on the mainland things are
going the other way. There is much disease among the people, and
they are hard to treat. Missionary work has been carried on in the
islands for some years, and is meeting with fair success.</p>

<p>The Trobriand people, though not cannibals, are rather of a
murderous tendency among themselves, and much too fond of avenging
insults or injuries by poison. Their clever and ingenious turn of
mind finds much enjoyment in the study of dangerous plants and
their effects. From the sea also they obtain certain very dangerous
poisons. One, taken from the gall-bladder of a fish, is so deadly,
that a banana pierced with a thorn which has been dipped in the
poison will kill the man who eats it within a very few hours. They
can also poison cocoa-nuts without opening them visibly, so that
the unsuspecting enemy may drink and die...If one lived in the
Trobriand group one would certainly wish to be on good terms with
its inhabitants.</p>

<p>There was no time to see any of the pearling. The <i>Merrie
England</i> had made an extended trip, and the officials travelling
on her were anxious to get back to Port Moresby. In any case, it is
not very easy to see the pearl fishing. The three or four whites
who have each taken out a pearler's licence (£50 per annum) are
scattered here, there, and everywhere in their boats, buying pearls
from the natives; and if you ask them what they are getting or
making&mdash;why, for the most part, you <i>may</i> ask.</p>

<p>All the same, truth leaks out; and most people in the Territory
know that very good pearls go down now and then from the Trobriands
to the dealers of Thursday Island. A good many are brought in
independently by the natives, who use the pearl-oyster as food, and
are keen nowadays to appreciate the value of the little round
things that, for some odd reason, the white men want very badly,
and will buy for tins and tins of meat, and pounds and pounds of
tobacco&mdash;if you are wise, and stick out for your price.</p>

<p>Let Bond Street weep when it hears that for uncounted
generations&mdash;until a very few years ago, in fact&mdash;the
Trobriand Islander used to eat the oysters and spit out the pearls
on the ground under the house, in the rubbish-heap, anywhere. There
are certain "kitchen middens" of old standing in these islands that
must be richer in pearls than any twenty jewellers'
shops&mdash;useless pearls, alas! for the gem does not stand
ill-usage and exposure to weather and decay, especially in a hot
and rainy climate.</p>

<p>And now, with bowsprit pointed south and west again, we made
steam for the towns, and the plantations, and the waking-up,
developing, new New Guinea once more. We had done with the wilds;
the wandering voyage was over.</p>

<p>Yet it is true that the half has not been told.</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>APPENDIX</h2>

<h3>HOW TO REACH PAPUA</h3>

<p>INTENDING travellers or settlers may be glad of a little
information as to the means of reaching Papua, and the expenses of
the journey.</p>

<p>Contrary to received opinion, Papua is not very
"out-of-the-way." One can do nearly the whole distance in the best
and biggest of the "P. and O" liners, embarking at Tilbury, and
leaving the boat six weeks later in Sydney. From this point, the
regular vessels of the Australian United Steam Navigation Company,
sailing weekly, take the traveller up the Queensland coast to
Cooktown in ten days&mdash;a beautiful and interesting voyage, with
many ports of call. At Cooktown the Burns Philp steamers meet the
A.U.S.N. boat, and, crossing Torres Straits, reach Port Moresby in
two days.</p>

<p>An alternative route from Sydney is that via the Solomon
Islands, in a Burns Philp through steamer, going to Samarai and
Port Moresby without change. This takes three weeks, and allows the
traveller to see one of the most interesting and beautiful groups
of islands in the world, quite at leisure, as a number of calls are
made.</p>

<p>Occasional boats of Dutch and German lines sail to Port Moresby
or Samarai from Sydney, usually calling at Brisbane. They cannot be
counted on, however, as the service is irregular, and depends on
the amount of cargo obtainable.</p>

<p>The expenses of the journey vary, according to the line
selected. By "P. and O." it costs £41 to £82 as far as Sydney; the
ticket to Port Moresby adds on another £12.</p>

<p>Travellers who do not mind a good deal of "roughing it" and some
mixed company can get to Sydney for about £20 by the large
one-class White Star boats that sail from Southampton. Messrs. Cook
and Sons, Ludgate Circus, London, E.C., are always ready to give
information about any line.</p>

<p>The "P. and O." Steam Navigation Company, Leadenhall Street,
E.C., can furnish handbooks and literature descriptive of Papua, if
asked. The Australian Commonwealth Government Offices at Victoria
Street, Westminster, will also give pamphlets and information to
applicants.</p>

<p>Outfits for Papua should be of the simplest kind. White duck or
drill suits of "patrol" pattern, strong light khaki clothing,
flannel shirts, heavy nailed boots, woollen puttees, are the
principal requisites. Colonial felt hats are more commonly worn
than helmets, as sunstroke is very rare. Ordinary requirements for
men&mdash;such as hats, ties, shirts&mdash;can be obtained in Papua
when necessary, as there are one or two stores of a simple kind.
Camping outfits, mosquito nets, tinware, tinned foods, can also be
bought in Port Moresby and Samarai.</p>

<p>Riding gear is not of much use, as horses can only be used about
Port Moresby and the Astrolabe. A steam or oil launch is invaluable
to any traveller who can afford to bring one up from Sydney or
Brisbane. Steam is to be preferred for work up the rivers and along
the coasts, as the distances are great and currents variable, and a
launch may very easily run short of fuel&mdash;in which case the
steam launch, which can at a pinch be worked with wood, will have a
distinct advantage over the oil launch, in spite of the superior
compactness and convenience of the latter.</p>

<p>It is possible to ascend the rivers in native canoes or boats,
though progress is necessarily slow and uncertain, owing to the
great volume and strong current of the rivers.</p>

<p>The best season for visiting Papua is the time of the south-east
trades, which usually lasts from about April to October. July and
August are commonly the coolest months. During the northwest
monsoon, from November to March, the weather is hot and rainy, and
winds are irregular. An exception, however, must be made as regards
visits to the Western and Gulf divisions. These are most easily
reached in December, January, and February. At other times the
river bars arc often quite impassable, owing to the surf.</p>

<p>Exploring expeditions into the interior should by no means be
undertaken "lightly or inadvisedly." There is no country in the
world that makes a greater tax upon the pluck, determination,
strength, and organising power of explorers than Papua; nor can the
unknown interior he reached without considerable expenditure.
Hundreds are not much use when it comes to serious exploring;
unless the traveller's pocket will stand a call of at least four
figures, he had better not try to tempt the fascinating unknown. It
must also be added that exploration in Papua is surrounded by
restrictions that do not obtain in Africa. If a Papuan explorer
were to hang his men for misconduct, he would run a fair chance of
being hanged himself when he carne back. If he ill-treated,
starved, and oppressed his "boys"; if he armed one tribe against
another, and conducted private wars; if he shot natives who had not
attempted to harm him, and set on fire villages deserted by their
terrified inhabitants&mdash;as African explorers have done time and
again, not only without remorse, but actually glorying in their
deeds&mdash;he would very probably be tried and imprisoned on his
return. The name of science is respected in this far-away colony,
and explorers or prospectors are always warmly welcomed and given
every possible help; but the price of blood that has been paid for
so much of modern discovery on the African continent will never be
paid in Papua, even if the locked doors remain locked for another
half-century.</p>

<p>The possibility of exploration under humane conditions was
proved by the Mackay-Little exploring journey in 1908-9, already
referred to. During six months' journeying through unknown, hostile
country, only one carrier out of nearly eighty was lost, all the
others returning in good condition to their homes; and no natives
of the country travelled through were killed.</p>

<p>For information about Papua, whether from the settler's,
traveller's, explorer's, or investor's point of view, application
can always be made to the Government
officials&mdash;Lieutenant-Governor, Government Secretary, or
Director of Agriculture at Port Moresby.</p>

<h3>HEALTH CONDITIONS</h3>

<p>Concerning the health conditions of the country, the opinion of
Dr. R. Fleming Jones, the Government Medical Officer at Samarai,
carries special weight, as Dr. Jones, besides his residence of five
years in Papua, can claim experience and study of tropical diseases
in Cuba, the West Indies, the Southern United States, and the
Philippines.</p>

<p>"Papua is singularly free from tropical diseases, considering
its geographical position, and on the whole is certainly healthier
than India," said this authority to the writer. "There is no
cholera, no plague, and enteric is unknown. There is no yellow
fever, no Malta fever, no sleeping sickness. Malaria and occasional
outbreaks of dysentery arc really the only tropical diseases of
importance, and there is no disease which yields so readily to
proper treatment as malaria, or that can be guarded against so
successfully, if people will only take the trouble. The worst of it
is that generally they will not. Whenever I hear of a new
plantation being opened up, I confidently expect that the white
people engaged thereon will go down with fever, one after another.
They will come into Samarai sick and debilitated and complain of
the country, not of their own carelessness. The Anopheles, which is
the malaria-hearing mosquito, bites after sunset as a general rule,
and if a man intelligently uses a good net&mdash;in the absence of
a mosquito-proof room, which, however, ought to be one of the first
things provided for him&mdash;and searches this with a light before
he turns in, he will probably escape fever. The mosquito net should
always be used, even with a mosquito-proof room, as an additional
precaution.</p>

<p>"Papua has certainly suffered by confusion, in the public mind,
with the Guinea coast of Africa,&mdash;quite unjustly, as the
health conditions are infinitely better in Papua. The truth really
is that this country is as healthy as any other lying in the same
latitudes. Tropical and equatorial countries are not as healthy for
white people as temperate climates&mdash;everyone knows that; but
with the application of the most elementary rules of tropical
sanitation, with which every new-comer to a tropical country should
be familiar, there is no reason why settlers should not enjoy good
health here. With regard to the question Of stimulants, blackwater
fever is undoubtedly in many cases connected with their abuse,
though certainly not caused by drinking. The most important matter
in the prevention of blackwater fever is simply the prevention of
malaria, as it is almost always in individuals who have had
repeated attacks of malaria that blackwater occurs. I believe that
a strictly moderate use of stimulants does no harm, even good in
some cases, but moderation, in enervating climates like this, seems
to be so difficult that it is safer to counsel total
abstinence."</p>
