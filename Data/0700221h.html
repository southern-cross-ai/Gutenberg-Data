<h2>I</h2>

<p>Mary Makebelieve lived with her mother in a small room at the very
top of a big, dingy house in a Dublin back street. As long as she could
remember she had lived in that top back room. She knew every crack in
the ceiling, and they were numerous and of strange shapes. Every spot
of mildew on the ancient wall-paper was familiar. She had, indeed,
watched the growth of most from a greyish shade to a dark stain, from a
spot to a great blob, and the holes in the skirting of the walls, out
of which at night time the cockroaches came rattling, she knew also.
There was but one window in the room, and when she wished to look out
of it she had to push the window up, because the grime of many years
had so encrusted the glass that it was of no more than the
demi-semi-transparency of thin horn. When she did look there was
nothing to see but a bulky array of chimney-pots crowning a next-door
house, and these continually hurled jays of soot against her window;
therefore, she did not care to look out often, for each time that she
did so she was forced to wash herself, and as water had to be carried
from the very bottom of the five-story house up hundreds and hundreds
of stairs to her room, she disliked having to use too much water.</p>

<p>Her mother seldom washed at all. She held that washing was very
unhealthy and took the natural gloss off the face, and that, moreover,
soap either tightened the skin or made it wrinkle. Her own face was
very tight in some places and very loose in others, and Mary
Makebelieve often thought that the tight places were spots which her
mother used to wash when she was young, and the loose parts were those
which had never been washed at all. She thought that she would prefer
to be either loose all over her face or tight all over it, and,
therefore, when she washed she did it thoroughly, and when she
abstained she allowed of no compromise.</p>

<p>Her mother's face was the colour of old, old ivory. Her nose was
like a great strong beak, and on it the skin was stretched very
tightly, so that her nose shone dully when the candle was lit. Her eyes
were big and as black as pools of ink and as bright as the eyes of a
bird. Her hair also was black, it was as smooth as the finest silk, and
when unloosened it hung straightly down, shining about her ivory face.
Her lips were thin and scarcely coloured at all, and her hands were
sharp, quick hands, seeming all knuckle when she closed them and all
fingers when they were opened again.</p>

<p>Mary Makebelieve loved her mother very dearly, and her mother
returned her affection with an overwhelming passion that sometimes
surged into physically painful caresses. When her mother hugged her for
any length of time she soon wept, rocking herself and her daughter to
and fro, and her clutch became then so frantic that poor Mary
Makebelieve found it difficult to draw her breath; but she would not
for the world have disturbed the career of her mother's love. Indeed,
she found some pleasure in the fierceness of those caresses, and
welcomed the pain far more than she reprobated it.</p>

<p>Her mother went out early every morning to work, and seldom returned
home until late at night. She was a charwoman, and her work was to
scrub out rooms and wash down staircases. She also did cooking when she
was asked, and needlework when she got any to do. She had made
exquisite dresses which were worn by beautiful young girls at balls and
picnics, and fine white shirts that great gentlemen wore when they were
dining, and fanciful waistcoats for gay young men, and silk stockings
for dancing in--but that was a long time ago, because these beautiful
things used to make her very angry when they were taken from her, so
that she cursed the people who came to take them away, and sometimes
tore up the dresses and danced on them and screamed.</p>

<p>She used often to cry because she was not rich. Sometimes, when she
came home from work, she liked to pretend that she was rich; she would
play at imagining that some one had died and left her a great fortune,
or that her brother Patrick had come back from America with vast
wealth, and then she would tell Mary Makebelieve of the things she
intended to buy and do the very next day. Mary Makebelieve liked
that...They were to move the first thing in the morning to a big house
with a garden behind it full of fruit-trees and flowers and birds.
There would be a wide lawn in front of the house to play lawn-tennis
in, and to walk with delicately fine young men with fair faces and
white hands, who would speak in the French language and bow often with
their hats almost touching the ground. There were to be twelve
servants--six of them men servants and six of them women servants--who
would instantly do as they were bidden, and would receive ten shillings
each per week and their board; they would also have two nights free in
the week, and would be very well fed. There were many wonderful dresses
to be bought, dresses for walking in the streets and dresses for
driving in a carriage, and others again for riding on horseback and for
travelling in. There was a dress of crimson silk with a deep lace
collar, and a heavy, wine-coloured satin dress with a gold chain
falling down in front of it, and there was a pretty white dress of the
finest linen, having one red rose pinned at the waist. There were black
silken stockings with quaint designs worked on them in red silk, and
scarves of silver gauze, and others embroidered with flowers and little
shapes of men and women.</p>

<p>When her mother was planning all these things she was very happy,
but afterwards she used to cry bitterly and rock her daughter to and
fro on her breast until she hurt her.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>II</h2>

<p>Every morning about six o'clock Mary Makebelieve left her bed and
lit the fire. It was an ugly fire to light, because the chimney had
never been swept, and there was no draught. Also, they never had any
sticks in the house, and scraps of paper twisted tightly into balls
with the last night's cinders placed on them and a handful of small
coals strewn on the top were used instead. Sometimes the fire blazed up
quickly, and that made her happy, but at other times it went out three
and four, and often half a dozen times; then the little bottle of
paraffin oil had to be squandered--a few rags well steeped in the oil
with a newspaper stretched over the grate seldom failed to coax enough
fire to boil the saucepan of water; generally this method smoked the
water, and then the tea tasted so so horrid that one only drank it for
the sake of economy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Makebelieve liked to lie in bed until the last possible moment.
As there was no table in the room, Mary used to bring the two cups of
tea, the tin of condensed milk, and the quarter of a loaf over to the
bed, and there she and her mother took their breakfast.</p>

<p>From the time she opened her eyes in the morning her mother never
ceased to talk. It was then she went over all the things that had
happened on the previous day, and enumerated the places she would have
to go to on the present day, and the chances for and against the making
of a little money. At this meal she used to arrange also to have the
room re-papered and the chimney swept and the rat-holes stopped
up--there were three of these; one was on the left-hand side of the
fire grate, the other two were under the bed, and Mary Makebelieve had
lain awake many a night listening to the gnawing of teeth on the
skirting and the scamper of little feet here and there on the floor.
Her mother further arranged to have a Turkey carpet placed' on the
floor, although she admitted that oilcloth or linoleum was easier to
clean, but they were not so nice to the feet or the eye. Into all these
improvements her daughter entered with the greatest delight. There was
to be a red mahogany chest of drawers against one wall, and a rosewood
piano against the wall opposite; a fender of shining brass, with brazen
furniture, a bright copper kettle for boiling water in, and an iron pot
for cooking potatoes and meat; there was to be a life-sized picture of
Mary over the mantelpiece, and a picture of her mother near the window
in a golden frame, also a picture of a Newfoundland dog lying in a
barrel and a little wee terrier crawling up to make friends with him,
and a picture of a battle between black people and soldiers.</p>

<p>Her mother knew it was time to get out of bed when she heard a heavy
step coming from the next room and going downstairs. A labouring man
lived there with his wife and six children. When the door banged she
jumped up, dressed quickly, and flew from the room in a panic of haste.
Usually then, as there was nothing to do, Mary went back to bed for
another couple of hours. After this she arose, made the bed and tidied
the room, and went out to walk in the streets, or to sit in the St.
Stephen's Green Park. She knew every bird in the Park, those that had
chickens, and those that had had chickens, and those that never had any
chickens at all--these latter were usually drakes, and had reason on
their side for an abstention which might otherwise have appeared
remarkable, but they did not deserve the pity which Mary lavished on
their childishness, nor the extra pieces of bread with which she sought
to recompense them. She loved to watch the ducklings swimming after
their mothers: they were quite fearless, and would dash to the water's
edge where one was standing and pick up nothing with the greatest
eagerness and swallow it with delight. The mother duck swam placidly
close to her brood, and clucked in a low voice all kinds of warnings
and advice and reproof to the little ones. Mary Makebelieve thought it
was very clever of the little ducklings to be able to swim so well. She
loved them, and when nobody was looking she used to cluck at them like
their mother; but she did not often do this, because she did not know
duck language really well, and feared that her cluck might mean the
wrong things, and that she might be giving these innocents bad advice,
and telling them to do something contrary to what their mother had just
directed.</p>

<p>The bridge across the big lake was a fascinating place. On the sunny
side lots of ducks were always standing on their heads searching for
something in the water, so that they looked like only half ducks. On
the shady side hundreds of eels were swimming about--they were most
wonderful things; some of them were thin like ribbons, and others were
round and plump like thick ropes. They never seemed to fight at all,
and although the ducklings were so tiny the big eels never touched any
of them, even when they dived right down amongst them. Some of the eels
swam along very slowly, looking on this side and on that as if they
were out of work or up from the country, and others whizzed by with
incredible swiftness. Mary Makebelieve thought that the latter kind had
just heard their babies crying; she wondered, when a little fish cried,
could its mother see the tears where there was already so much water
about, and then she thought that maybe they cried hard lumps of
something that was easily visible.</p>

<p>After this she would go around the flower-beds and look at each;
some of them were shaped like stars, and some were quite round, and
others again were square. She liked the star-shaped flower-beds best,
and next she liked the round ones, and last of all the square. But she
loved all the flowers, and used to make up stories about them.</p>

<p>After that, growing hungry, she would go home for her lunch. She
went home down Grafton Street and O'Connell Street. She always went
along the right-hand side of the street going home, and looked in every
shop window that she passed; and then, when she had eaten her lunch,
she came out again and walked along the left-hand side of the road,
looking at the shops on that side; and so she knew daily everything
that was new in the city, and was able to tell her mother at night time
that the black dress with Spanish lace was taken out of Manning's
window, and a red gown with tucks at the shoulders and Irish lace at
the wrists put in its place; or that the diamond ring in Johnson's
marked One Hundred Pounds was gone from the case, and that a slide of
brooches of beaten silver and blue enamel was there instead.</p>

<p>In the night time her mother and herself went round to each of the
theatres in turn and watched the people going in, and looked at the big
posters. When they went home afterwards they had supper, and used to
try to make out the plots of the various plays from the pictures they
had seen, so that generally they had lots to talk about before they
went to bed. Mary Makebelieve used to talk most in the night time, but
her mother talked most in the morning.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>III</h2>

<p>Her mother spoke sometimes of matrimony as a thing remote but very
certain: the remoteness of this adventure rather shocked Mary
Makebelieve; she knew that a girl had to get married, that a strange,
beautiful man would come from somewhere looking for a wife, and would
retire again with his bride to that Somewhere which is the country of
Romance. At times (and she could easily picture it) he rode in armour
on a great bay horse, the plume of his helmet trailing among the high
leaves of the forest. Or he came standing on the prow of a swift ship
with the sunlight blazing back from his golden armour. Or on a grassy
plain, fleet as the wind, he came running, leaping, laughing.</p>

<p>When the subject of matrimony was under discussion her mother
planned minutely the person of the groom, his vast accomplishments, and
yet vaster wealth, the magnificence of his person, and the love in
which he was held by rich and poor alike. She also discussed, down to
the smallest detail, the elaborate trousseau she would provide for her
daughter, the extravagant presents the bridegroom would make to his
bride and her maids, and those, yet more costly, which the bridegroom's
family would send to the newly-married pair. All these wonders could
only concentrate in the person of a lord. Mary Makebelieve's questions
as to the status and appurtenances of a lord were searching and minute;
her mother's rejoinders were equally elaborate and particular.</p>

<p>At his birth a lord is cradled in silver; at his death he is laid in
a golden casket, an oaken coffin, and a leaden outer coffin, until,
finally, a massy stone sarcophagus shrouds his remains for ever. His
life is a whirl of gaiety and freedom. Around his castle there spread
miles upon miles of sunny grass lands and ripened orchards and waving
forests, and through these he hunts with his laughing companions or
walks gently with his lady. He has servants by the thousand, each
anxious to die for him, and his wealth, prodigious beyond the
computation of avarice, is stored in underground chambers, whose low,
tortuous passages lead to labyrinths of vaults massy and
impregnable.</p>

<p>Mary Makebelieve would have loved to wed a lord. If a lord had come
to her when she paced softly through a forest, or stood alone on the
seashore, or crouched among the long grass of a windy plain, she would
have placed her hands in his and followed him and loved him truly for
ever. But she did not believe that these things happened nowadays, nor
did her mother. Nowadays! her mother looked on these paltry times with
an eye whose scorn was complicated by fury. Mean, ugly days! mean, ugly
lives! and mean, ugly people! said her mother, that's all one can get
nowadays; and then she spoke of the people whose houses she washed out
and whose staircases she scrubbed down, and her old-ivory face flamed
from her black hair, and her deep, dark eyes whirled and became hard
and motionless as points of jet, and her hands jumped alternately into
knuckles and claws.</p>

<p>But it became increasingly evident to Mary Makebelieve that marriage
was not a story but a fact, and, somehow, the romance of it did not
drift away, although the very house wherein she lived was infested by
these conjoints, and the streets wherein she walked were crowded with
undistinguished couples...Those grey--lived, dreary--natured people had
a spark of fire smouldering somewhere in their poor economy. Six feet
deep is scarcely deep enough to bury romance, and until that depth of
clay has clogged our bones the fire can still smoulder and be fanned,
and, perhaps, blaze up and flare across a county or a country to warm
the cold hands of many a shrivelled person.</p>

<p>How did all these people come together? She did not yet understand
the basic necessity that drives the male to the female. Sex was not yet
to her a physiological distinction, it was only a differentiation of
clothing, a matter of whiskers and no whiskers: but she had begun to
take a new and peculiar interest in men. One of these hurrying or
loitering strangers might be the husband whom fate had ordained for
her. She would scarcely have been surprised if one of the men who
looked at her casually in the street had suddenly halted and asked her
to marry him. It came on her with something like assurance that that
was the only business these men were there for; she could not discover
any other reason or excuse for their existence, and if some man had
been thus adventurous Mary Make-believe would have been sadly perplexed
to find an answer: she might, indeed, have replied, "Yes, thank you,
sir," for when a man asks one to do a thing for him one does it gladly.
There was an attraction about young men which she could not understand,
something peculiarly dear and magnetic; she would have liked to shake
hands with one to see how different he felt from a girl. They would,
probably, shake hands quite hard and then hit one. She fancied she
would not mind being hit by a man, and then, watching the vigour of
their movements, she thought they could hit very hard, but still there
was a terrible attraction about the idea of being hit by a man. She
asked her mother (with apparent irrelevance), had a man ever struck
her? Her mother was silent for a few moments, and then burst into so
violent a passion of weeping that Mary Makebelieve was frightened. She
rushed into her mother's arms, and was rocked fiercely against a heart
almost bursting with bitter pride and recollection. But her mother did
not then, nor did she ever afterwards, answer Mary Make-believe's
question.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>IV</h2>

<p>Every afternoon a troop of policemen marched in solemn and majestic
single file from the College Green Police Station. At regular
intervals, one by one, a policeman stepped sideways from the file,
adjusted his belt, touched his moustache, looked up the street and down
the street for stray criminals, and condescended to the duties of his
beat.</p>

<p>At the crossing where Nassau and Suffolk Streets intersect Grafton
Street one of these superb creatures was wont to relinquish his
companions, and there in the centre of the road, a monument of solidity
and law, he remained until the evening hour which released him again to
the companionship of his peers.</p>

<p>Perhaps this point is the most interesting place in Dublin. Upon one
vista Grafton Street with its glittering shops stretches, or rather
winds, to the St. Stephen's Green Park, terminating at the gate known
as the Fusiliers' Arch, but which local patriotism has rechristened the
Traitors' Gate. On the left Nassau Street, broad and clean, and a
trifle vulgar and bourgeois in its openness, runs away to Merrion
Square, and on with a broad ease to Blackrock and Kingstown and the
sea. On the right hand Suffolk Street, reserved and shy, twists up to
St. Andrew's Church, touches gingerly the South City Markets, droops to
George's Street, and is lost in mean and dingy intersections. At the
back of the crossing Grafton Street continues again for a little
distance down to Trinity College (at the gates whereof very intelligent
young men flaunt very tattered gowns and smoke massive pipes with great
skill for their years), skirting the Bank of Ireland, and on to the
river Liffey and the street which local patriotism defiantly speaks of
as O'Connell Street, and alien patriotism, with equal defiance and
pertinacity, knows as Sackville Street.</p>

<p>To the point where these places meet, and where the policeman
stands, all the traffic of Dublin converges in a constant stream. The
trams hurrying to Terenure, or Donnybrook, or Dalkey flash around this
corner; the doctors, who, in these degenerate days, concentrate in
Merrion Square, fly up here in carriages and motor-cars; the vans of
the great firms in Grafton and O'Connell Streets, or those outlying,
never cease their exuberant progress. The ladies and gentlemen of
leisure stroll here daily at four o'clock, and from all sides the
vehicles and pedestrians, the bicycles and motor bicycles, the trams
and the outside cars rush to the solitary policeman, who directs them
all with his severe but tolerant eye. He knows all the tram-drivers who
go by, and his nicely graduated wink rewards the glances of the
rubicund, jolly drivers of the hackneys and the decayed jehus with
purple faces and dismal hopefulness who drive sepulchral cabs for some
reason which has no acquaintance with profit; nor are the ladies and
gentlemen who saunter past foreign to his encyclopedic eye. Constantly
his great head swings a slow recognition, constantly his serene finger
motions onwards a well-known undesirable, and his big white teeth flash
for an instant at young, laughing girls and the more matronly
acquaintances who solicit the distinction of his glance.</p>

<p>To this place, and about this hour, Mary Makebelieve, returning from
her solitary lunch, was wont to come. The figure of the massive
policeman fascinated her. Surely everything desirable in manhood was
concentrated in his tremendous body. What an immense, shattering blow
that mighty fist could give! She could imagine it swinging vast as the
buffet of an hero, high-thrown and then down irresistibly--a crashing,
monumental hand. She delighted in his great, solid head as it swung
slowly from side to side, and his calm, proud eye--a governing,
compelling, and determined eye. She had never met his glance yet: she
withered away before it as a mouse withers and shrinks and falls to its
den before a cat's huge glare. She used to look at him from the
kerbstone in front of the chemist's shop, or on the opposite side of
the road, while pretending to wait for a tram; and at the pillar-box
beside the optician's she found time for one furtive twinkle of a
glance that shivered to his face and trembled away into the traffic.
She did not think he noticed her; but there was nothing he did not
notice. His business was noticing: he caught her in his mental
policeman's notebook the very first day she came; he saw her each day
beside, and at last looked for her coming and enjoyed her strategy. One
day her shy, creeping glance was caught by his; it held her mesmerised
for a few seconds; it looked down into her--for a moment the whole
world seemed to have become one immense eye--she could scarcely get
away from it.</p>

<p>When she remembered again she was standing by the pond in the St.
Stephen's Green Park, with a queer, frightened exaltation lightening
through her blood. She did not go home that night by Grafton
Street--she did not dare venture within reach of that powerful
organism--but went a long way round, and still the way seemed very
short.</p>

<p>That night her mother, although very tired, was the more talkative
of the two. She offered in exchange for her daughter's thoughts pennies
that only existed in her imagination. Mary Makebelieve professed that
it was sleep and not thought obsessed her, and exhibited voucher yawns
which were as fictitious as her reply. When they went to bed that night
it was a long time before she slept. She lay looking into the deep
gloom of the chamber, and scarcely heard the fierce dreams of her
mother, who was demanding from a sleep world the things she lacked in
the wide-awake one.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>V</h2>

<p>This is the appearance was on Mary Makebelieve at that time:--She
had fair hair, and it was very soft and very thick; when she unwound
this it fell, or rather flowed, down to her waist, and when she walked
about the room with her hair unloosened it curved beautifully about her
head, snuggled into the hollow of her neck, ruffled out broadly again
upon her shoulders, and swung into and out of her figure with every
motion, surging and shrinking and dancing; the ends of her hair were
soft and loose as foam, and it had the colour and shining of pure,
light gold. Commonly in the house she wore her hair loose, because her
mother liked the appearance of youth imparted by hanging hair, and
would often desire her daughter to leave off her outer skirt and walk
only in her petticoats to heighten the illusion of girlishness. Her
head was shaped very tenderly and softly; it was so small that when her
hair was twisted up it seemed much too delicate to bear so great a
burden. Her eyes were grey, limpidly tender and shy, drooping under
weighty lids, so that they seldom seemed more than half opened, and
commonly sought the ground rather than the bolder excursions of
straightforwardness; they seldom looked for longer than a glance,
climbing and poising and eddying about the person at whom she gazed,
and then dived away again; and always when she looked at any one she
smiled a deprecation of her boldness. She had a small white face, very
like her mother's in some ways and at some angles, but the tight beak
which was her mother's nose was absent in Mary; her nose withdrew
timidly in the centre, and only snatched a hurried courage to become
visible at the tip. It was a nose which seemed to have been snubbed
almost out of existence. Her mother loved it because it was so little,
and had tried so hard not to be a nose at all. They often stood
together before the little glass that had a great crack running
drunkenly from the right-hand top corner down to the left-hand bottom
corner, and two small arm crosses, one a little above the other, in the
centre. When one's face looked into this glass it often appeared there
as four faces with horrible aberrations; an ear might be curving around
a lip, or an eye leering strangely in the middle of a chin. But there
were ways of looking into the glass which practice had discovered, and
usage had long ago dulled the terrors of its vagaries. Looking into
this glass, Mrs. Makebelieve would comment minutely upon the two faces
therein, and, pointing to her own triumphantly genuine nose and the
fact that her husband's nose had been of quite discernible proportions,
she would seek in labyrinths of pedigree for a reason to justify her
daughter's lack; she passed all her sisters in this review, with an
army of aunts and great-aunts, rifling the tombs of grandparents and
their remoter blood, and making long-dead noses to live again. Mary
Makebelieve used to lift her timidly curious eye and smile in
deprecation of her nasal shortcomings, and then her mother would kiss
the dejected button and vow it was the dearest, loveliest bit of a nose
that had ever been seen.</p>

<p>"Big noses suit some people," said Mrs. Makebelieve, "but they do
not suit others, and one would not suit you, dearie. They go well with
black-haired people and very tall people, military gentlemen, judges
and apothecaries; but small, fair folk cannot support great noses. I
like my own nose," she continued. "At school, when I was a little girl,
the other girls used to laugh at my nose, but I always liked it, and
after a time other people came to like it also."</p>

<p>Mary Makebelieve had small, slim hands and feet: the palms of her
hands were softer than anything in the world; there were five little,
pink cushions on her palm--beginning at the little finger there was a
very tiny cushion, the next one was bigger, and the next bigger again,
until the largest ended a perfect harmony at the base of her thumb. Her
mother used to kiss these little cushions at times, holding back the
finger belonging to each, and naming it as she touched it. These are
the names of Mary Makebelieve's fingers, beginning with the thumb:--Tom
Tumkins, Willie Winkles, Long Daniel, Bessie Bobtail, and Little
Dick-Dick.</p>

<p>Her slight, girlish figure was only beginning to creep to the deeper
contours of womanhood, a half curve here and there, a sudden softness
in the youthful lines, certain angles trembling on the slightest of
rolls, a hint, a suggestion, the shadowy prophecy of circles and half
hoops that could not yet roll: the trip of her movements was troubled
sometimes to a sedater motion.</p>

<p>These things her mother's curiosity was continually recording,
sometimes with happy pride, but oftener in a kind of anger to find that
her little girl was becoming a big girl. If it had been possible she
would have detained her daughter for ever in the physique of a child;
she feared the time when Mary would become too evidently a woman, when
all kinds of equalities would come to hinder her spontaneous and active
affection. A woman might object to be nursed, while a girl would not;
Mrs. Makebelieve feared that objection, and, indeed, Mary, under the
stimulus of an awakening body and a new, strange warmth, was not
altogether satisfied by being nursed or by being the passive
participant in these caresses. She sometimes thought that she would
like to take her mother on her own breast and rock her to and fro,
crooning soft made-up words and kissing the top of a head or the
half-hidden curve of a cheek, but she did not dare to do so for fear
her mother would strike her. Her mother was very jealous on that point;
she loved her daughter to kiss her and stroke her hands and her face,
but she never liked her to play at being the mother, nor had she ever
encouraged her daughter in the occupations of a doll. She was the
mother and Mary was the baby, and she could not bear to have her
motherhood hindered even in play.</p>

<h2>VI</h2>

<p>Although Mary Makebelieve was sixteen years of age she had not yet
gone to work; her mother did not like the idea of her little girl
stooping to the drudgery of the only employment she could have aided
her to obtain--that was, to assist herself in the humble and arduous
toil of charing. She had arranged that Mary was to go into a shop, a
drapery store, or some such other, but that was to be in a sometime
which seemed infinitely remote. "And then, too," said Mrs. Makebelieve,
"all kinds of things may happen in a year or so if we wait. Your uncle
Patrick, who went to America twenty years ago, may come home, and when
he does you will not have to work, dearie, nor will I. Or again, some
one going along the street may take a fancy to you and marry you;
things often happen like that." There were a thousand schemes and
accidents which, in her opinion, might occur to the establishment of
her daughter's ease and the enlargement of her own dignity. And so Mary
Makebelieve, when her mother was at work (which was sometimes every day
in the week), had all the day to loiter in and spend as best she liked.
Sometimes she did not go out at all. She stayed in the top back room
sewing or knitting, mending holes in the sheets or the blankets, or
reading books from the Free Library in Capel Street: but generally she
preferred, after the few hours which served to put the room in order,
to go out and walk along the streets, taking new turnings as often as
she fancied, and striking down strange roads to see the shops and the
people.</p>

<p>There were so many people whom she knew by sight; almost daily she
saw these somewhere, and she often followed them for a short distance,
with a feeling of friendship; for the loneliness of the long day often
drew down upon her like a weight, so that even the distant
companionship of these remembered faces that did not know her was
comforting.</p>

<p>She wished she could find out who some of them were.--There was a
tall man with a sweeping brown beard, whose heavy overcoat looked as
though it had been put on with a shovel; he wore spectacles, and his
eyes were blue, and always seemed as if they were going to laugh; he,
also, looked into the shops as he went along, and he seemed to know
everybody. Every few paces people would halt and shake his hand, but
these people never spoke, because the big man with the brown beard
would instantly burst into a fury of speech which had no intervals; and
when there was no one with him at all he would talk to himself. On
these occasions he did not see any one, and people had to jump out of
his way while he strode onwards swinging his big head from one side to
the other, and with his eyes fixed on some place a great distance away.
Once or twice, in passing, she heard him singing to himself the most
lugubrious song in the world. There was another--a long, thin, black
man--who looked young and was always smiling secretly to himself; his
lips were never still for a moment, and, passing Mary Makebelieve a few
times, she heard him buzzing like a great bee. He did not stop to shake
hands with any one, and although many people saluted him he took no
heed, but strode on, smiling his secret smile and buzzing serenely.
There was a third man whom she often noticed: his clothing seemed as if
it had been put on him a long time ago and had never been taken off
again. He had a long, pale face, with a dark moustache drooping over a
most beautiful mouth. His eyes were very big and lazy, and did not look
quite human; they had a trick of looking sidewards--a most intimate,
personal look. Sometimes he saw nothing in the world but the pavement,
and at other times he saw everything. He looked at Mary Makebelieve
once, and she got a fright; she had a queer idea that she had known him
well hundreds of years before, and that he remembered her also. She was
afraid of that man, but she liked him because he looked so gentle and
so--there was something else he looked which as yet she could not put a
name to, but which her ancestry remembered dimly. There was a short,
fair, pale-faced man, who looked like the tiredest man in the world. He
was often preoccupied, but not in the singular way the others were. He
seemed to be always chewing the cud of remembrance, and looked at
people as if they reminded him of other people who were dead a long
time and whom he thought of but did not regret. He was a detached man
even in a crowd, and carried with him a cold atmosphere; even his smile
was bleak and aloof. Mary Makebelieve noticed that many people nudged
each other as he went by, and then they would turn and look after him
and go away whispering.</p>

<p>These and many others she saw almost daily, and used to look for
with a feeling of friendship. At other times she walked up the long
line of quays sentinelling the Liffey, watching the swift boats of
Guinness puffing down the river, and the thousands of sea-gulls
hovering above or swimming on the dark waters, until she came to the
Phoenix Park, where there was always a cricket or football match being
played, or some young men or girls playing hurley, or children playing
tip-and-tig, running after one another, and dancing and screaming in
the sunshine. Her mother liked very much to go with her to the Phoenix
Park on days when there was no work to be done. Leaving the great,
white main road, up which the bicycles and motor-cars are continually
whizzing, a few minutes' walk brings one to quiet alleys sheltered by
trees and groves of hawthorn. In these passages one can walk for a long
time without meeting a person, or lie on the grass in the shadow of a
tree and watch the sunlight beating down on the green fields and
shimmering between the trees. There is a deep silence to be found here,
very strange and beautiful to one fresh from the city, and it is
strange also to look about in the broad sunshine and see no person near
at all, and no movement saving the roll and folding of the grass, the
slow swinging of the branches of the trees, or the noiseless flight of
a bee, a butterfly, or a bird.</p>

<p>These things Mary Makebelieve liked, but her mother would pine for
the dances of the little children, the gallant hurrying of the
motor-cars, and the movement to and fro of the people with gay dresses
and coloured parasols and all the circumstance of holiday.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>VII</h2>

<p>One morning Mary Makebelieve jumped out of bed and lit the fire. For
a wonder it lit easily: the match was scarcely applied when the flames
were leaping up the black chimney, and this made her feel at ease with
the world. Her mother stayed in bed chatting with something more of
gaiety than usual. It was nearly six o'clock, and the early summer sun
was flooding against the grimy window. The previous evening's post had
brought a postcard for Mrs. Makebelieve, requesting her to call on a
Mrs. O'Connor, who had a house off Harcourt Street. This, of course,
meant a day's work--it also meant a new client.</p>

<p>Mrs. Makebelieve's clients were always new. She could not remain for
any length of time in people's employment without being troubled by the
fact that these folk had houses of their own and were actually
employing her in a menial capacity. She sometimes looked at their black
silk aprons in a way which they never failed to observe with anger, and
on their attempting (as they always termed it) to put her in her proper
place, she would discuss their appearance and morals with such power
that they at once dismissed her from their employment and incited their
husbands to assault her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Makebelieve's mind was exercised in finding out who had
recommended her to this new lady, and in what terms of encomium such
recommendation had been framed. She also debated as to whether it would
be wise to ask for one shilling and ninepence per day instead of the
customary one shilling and sixpence. If the house was a big one she
might be required by this new customer oftener than once a week, and,
perhaps, there were others in the house besides the lady who would find
small jobs for her to do--needlework or messages, or some such which
would bring in a little extra money; for she professed her willingness
and ability to undertake with success any form of work in which a woman
could be eminent. In a house where she had worked she had once been
asked by a gentleman who lodged there to order in two dozen bottles of
stout, and, on returning with the stout, the gentleman had thanked her
and given her a shilling. Incidents parallel to this had kept her faith
in humanity green. There must be plenty of these open-handed gentlemen
in houses such as she worked in, and, perhaps, in Mrs. O'Connor's house
there might be more than one such person. There were stingy people
enough, heaven knew, people who would get one to run messages and
almost expect to be paid themselves for allowing one to work for them.
Mrs. Makebelieve anathematised such skinflints with a vocabulary which
was quite equal to the detailing of their misdeeds; but she refused to
dwell on them: they were not really important in a world where the sun
was shining. In the night time she would again believe in their
horrible existences, but until then the world must be peopled with
kindhearted folk. She instanced many whom she knew, people who had
advanced services and effects without exacting or indeed expecting any
return.</p>

<p>When the tea was balanced insecurely on the bed, the two tea-cups on
one side of her legs, the three-quarters of a loaf and the tin of
condensed milk on the other, Mary sat down with great care, and all
through the breakfast her mother culled from her capacious memory a
list of kindnesses of which she had been the recipient or the witness.
Mary supplemented the recital by incidents from her own observation.
She had often seen a man in the street give a penny to an old woman.
She had often seen old women give things to other old women. She knew
many people who never looked for the halfpenny change from a newsboy.
Mrs. Makebelieve applauded the justice of such transactions; they were,
she admitted, the things she would do herself if she were in a position
to be careless; but a person to whom the discovery of her daily bread
is a daily problem, and who can scarcely keep pace with the
ever-changing terms of the problem, is not in a position to be
careless.--"Grind, grind, grind," said Mrs. Makebelieve, "that is life
for me, and if I ceased to grind for an instant ..." she flickered her
thin hand into a nowhere of terror. Her attitude was, that when one had
enough one should give the residue to some one who had not enough. It
was her woe, it stabbed her to the heart, to see desolate people
dragging through the streets, standing to glare through the windows of
bakeries and confectioners' shops, and little children in some of these
helpless arms! Thinking of these, she said that every morsel she ate
would choke her were it not for her own hunger. But maybe, said she,
catching a providential glance of the golden-tinted window, maybe these
poor people were not as poor as they seemed: surely they had ways of
collecting a living which other people did not know anything about. It
might be that they got lots of money from kind-hearted people, and food
at hospitable doors, and here and there clothing and oddments which, if
they did not wear, they knew how to dispose of advantageously. What
extremes of ways and means such people must be acquainted with! No
ditch was too low to rummage in, no rat-hole too hidden to be ravaged;
a gate represented something to be climbed over; an open door was an
invitation, a locked one a challenge. They could dodge under the fences
of the law and climb the barbed wire of morality with equal impunity,
and the utmost rigour of punishment had little terror for those whose
hardships could scarcely be artificially worsened. The stagger of
despair, the stricken, helpless aspect of such people, their gaunt
faces and blurred eyes, might conceivably be their stock-in-trade, the
keys wherewith they unlocked hearts and purses and area doors. It must
be so when the sun was shining and birds were singing across fields not
immeasurably distant, and children in walled gardens romped among
fruits and flowers. She would believe this, for it was the early
morning when one must believe, but when the night time came again she
would laugh to scorn such easy beliefs, she would see the lean ribs of
humanity when she undressed herself.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>VIII</h2>

<p>After her mother had gone, Mary Make-believe occupied herself
settling the room and performing the various offices which the keeping
in order of even one small room involves. There were pieces of the
wallpaper flapping loosely; these had to be gummed down with strips of
stamp-paper. The bed had to be made, the floor scrubbed, and a
miscellany of objects patted and tapped into order. Her few dresses
also had to be gone over for loose buttons, and the darning of
threadbare places was a duty exercising her constant attention. Her
clothing was always made by her mother, whose needle had once been
noted for expertness, and, therefore, fitted more accurately than is
customary in young girls' dresses. The arranging and rearranging of her
beads was a frequent and enjoyable labour. She had four different
necklaces, representing four different pennyworths of beads purchased
at a shop whose merchandise was sold for one penny per item. One
pennyworth of these beads was coloured green, another red, a third was
coloured like pearls, and the fourth was a miscellaneous packet of many
colours. A judicious selection of these beads could always provide a
new and magnificent necklace at the expense of little more than a
half-hour's easy work.</p>

<p>Because the sun was shining she brought out her white dress, and for
a time was busy on it. There had been five tucks in the dress, but one
after one they had to be let out. This was the last tuck that remained,
and it also had to go, but even with such extra lengthening the dress
would still swing free of her ankles. Her mother had promised to add a
false hem to it when she got time, and Mary determined to remind her of
this promise as soon as she came in from work. She polished her shoes,
put on the white dress, and then did up her hair in front of the
cracked looking-glass. She always put up her hair very plainly. She
first combed it down straight, then parted it in the centre, and rolled
it into a great ball at the back of her neck. She often wished to curl
her hair, and, indeed, it would have curled with the lightest
persuasion; but her mother, being approached on the subject, said that
curls were common and were seldom worn by respectable people, excepting
very small children or actresses, both of whose slender mentalities
were registered by these tiny daintinesses. Also, curls took up too
much time in arranging, and the slightest moisture in the air was
liable to draw them down into lank and unsightly plasters, and,
therefore, saving for a dance or a picnic, curls should not be
used.</p>

<p>Mary Makebelieve, having arranged her hair, hesitated for some time
in the choice of a necklace. There was the pearl-coloured necklace--it
was very pretty, but every one could tell at once that they were not
genuine pearls. Real pearls of the bigness of these would be very
valuable. Also, there was something childish about pearls which
latterly she wished to avoid. She had quite grown up now. The letting
down of the last tuck in her dress marked an epoch as distinct as did
the first rolling up of her hair. She wished her dress would go right
down to her heels so that she might have a valid reason for holding up
her skirts with one hand. She felt a trifle of impatience because her
mother had delayed making the false hem: she could have stitched it on
herself if her mother had cut it out, but for this day the dress would
have to do. She wished she owned a string of red coral; not that round
beady sort, but the jagged crisscross coral--a string of these long
enough to go twice round her neck, and yet hang down in front to her
waist. If she owned a string as long as that she might be able to cut
enough off to make a slender wristlet. She would have loved to see such
a wristlet sagging down to her hand.</p>

<p>Red, it seemed, would have to be the colour for this day, so she
took the red beads out of a box and put them on. They looked very nice
against her white dress, but still--she did not quite like them they
seemed too solid, so she put them back into the box again, and instead
tied round her neck a narrow ribbon of black velvet, which satisfied
her better. Next she put on her hat; it was of straw, and had been
washed many times. There was a broad ribbon of black velvet around it.
She wished earnestly that she had a sash of black velvet about three
inches deep to go round her waist. There was such a piece about the hem
of her mother's Sunday skirt, but, of course, that could not be
touched; maybe her mother would give it to her if she asked. The skirt
would look quite as well without it, and when her mother knew how nice
it looked round her waist she would certainly give it to her.</p>

<p>She gave a last look at herself in the glass and went out, turning
up to the quays in the direction of the Phoenix Park. The sun was
shining gloriously, and the streets seemed wonderfully clean in the
sunlight. The horses under the heavy drays pulled their loads as if
they were not heavy. The big, red-faced drivers leaned back at ease,
with their hard hats pushed back from their foreheads and their eyes
puckered at the sunshine. The tram-cars whizzed by like great jewels.
The outside cars went spanking down the broad road, and every
jolly-faced jarvey winked at her as he jolted by. The people going up
and down the street seemed contented and happy. It was one o'clock, and
from all kinds of offices and shops young men and women were darting
forth for their lunch; none of the young men were so hurried but they
had a moment to glance admiringly at Mary Makebelieve before diving
into a cheap restaurant or cheaper public-house for their food. The
gulls in the river were flying in long, lazy curves, dipping down to
the water, skimming it an instant, and then wheeling up again with
easy, slanting wings. Every few minutes a boat laden with barrels
puffed swiftly from beneath a bridge. All these boats had pretty
names--there was the <i>Shannon</i>, the <i>Suir</i>, the <i>Nore</i>,
the <i>Lagan</i>, and many others. The men on board sat contentedly on
the barrels and smoked and made slow remarks to one another; and
overhead the sky was blue and wonderful, immeasurably distant, filled
from horizon to horizon with sparkle and warmth. Mary Makebelieve went
slowly on towards the Park. She felt very happy. Now and then a darker
spot flitted through her mind, not at all obscuring, but toning the
brightness of her thoughts to a realisable serenity. She wished her
skirts were long enough to be held up languidly like the lady walking
in front: the hand holding up the skirt had a golden curb-chain on the
wrist which drooped down to the neatly-gloved hand, and between each
link of the chain was set a blue turquoise, and upon this jewel the sun
danced splendidly. Mary Makebelieve wished she had a slender red coral
wristlet; it also would have hung down to her palm and been lovely in
the sunlight, and it would, she thought, have been far nicer than the
bangle.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>IX</h2>

<p>She walked along for some time in the Park. Through the railings
flanking the great road many beds of flowers could be seen. These were
laid out in a great variety of forms, of stars and squares and crosses
and circles, and the flowers were arranged in exquisite patterns. There
was a great star which flamed with red flowers at the deep points, and
in its heart a heavier mass of yellow blossom glared suddenly. There
were circles wherein each ring was a differently-coloured flower, and
others where three rings alternated--three rings white, three purple,
and three orange, and so on in slenderer circles to the tiniest
diminishing. Mary Makebelieve wished she knew the names of all the
flowers, but the only ones she recognised by sight were the geraniums,
some species of roses, violets, and forget-me-nots and pansies. The
more exotic sorts she did not know, and, while she admired them
greatly, she had not the same degree of affection for them as for the
commoner, friendly varieties.</p>

<p>Leaving the big road, she wandered into wider fields. In a few
moments the path was hidden; the outside cars, motor-cars, and bicycles
had vanished as completely as though there were no such things in the
world. Great numbers of children were playing about in distinct bands;
each troop was accompanied by one and sometimes two older people, girls
or women who lay stretched out on the warm grass or leaned against the
tree-trunks reading novelettes, and around them the children whirled
and screamed and laughed. It was a world of waving pinafores and thin,
black-stockinged legs and shrill, sweet voices. In the great spaces the
children's voices had a strangely remote quality; the sweet, high tones
were not such as one heard in the streets or in houses. In a house or a
street these voices thudded upon the air and beat sonorously back again
from the walls, the houses, or the pavements; but out here the slender
sounds sang to a higher tenuity and disappeared out and up and away
into the tree-tops and the clouds and the wide, windy reaches. The
little figures partook also of this diminuendo effect; against the
great grassy curves they seemed smaller than they really were; the
trees stirred hugely above them, the grass waved vast beneath them, and
the sky ringed them in from immensity. Their forms scarcely disturbed
the big outline of nature; their laughter only whispered against the
silence, as ineffectual to disturb that gigantic serenity as a gnat's
wing fluttered against a precipice.</p>

<p>Mary Makebelieve wandered on; a few cows lifted solemnly curious
faces as she passed, and swung their heavy heads behind her. Once or
twice half a dozen deer came trotting from beyond the trees, and were
shocked to a halt on seeing her--a moment's gaze, and away like the
wind, bounding in a delicious freedom. Now a butterfly came twisting on
some eccentric journey--ten wing-beats to the left, twenty to the
right, and then back to the left, or, with a sudden twist, returning on
the path which it had already traversed, jerking carelessly through the
sunlight. Across the sky, very far up, a troop of birds sailed
definitely--they knew where they were going; momently one would detach
itself from the others in a burst of joyous energy and sweep a great
circle and back again to its comrades, and then away, away, away to the
skyline.--Ye swift ones! O, freedom and sweetness! A song falling from
the heavens! A lilt through deep sunshine! Happy wanderers! How fast ye
fly and how bravely--up and up, till the earth has fallen away and the
immeasurable heavens and the deep loneliness of the sunlight and the
silence of great spaces receive you!</p>

<p>Mary Makebelieve came to a tree around which a circular wooden seat
had been placed. Here for a time she sat looking out on the wide
fields. Far away in front the ground rolled down into valleys and up
into little hills, and from the valleys the green heads of trees
emerged, and on the further hills, in slender, distinct silhouette, and
in great masses, entire trees could be seen. Nearer were single trees,
each with its separate shadow and a stream of sunlight flooding
between; and everywhere the greenery of leaves and of grass, and the
gold of myriad buttercups, and multitudes of white daisies.</p>

<p>She had been sitting for some time when a shadow came from behind
her. She watched its lengthening and its queer bobbing motion. When it
grew to its greatest length it ceased to move. She felt that some one
had stopped. From the shape of the shadow she knew it was a man, but
being so close she did not like to look. Then a voice spoke. It was a
voice as deep as the rolling of a sea.</p>

<p>"Hello," said the voice, "what are you doing here all alone, young
lady?"</p>

<p>Mary Makebelieve's heart suddenly spurted to full speed. It seemed
to want more space than her bosom could afford. She looked up. Beside
her stood a prodigious man: one lifted hand curled his moustache, the
other carelessly twirled a long cane. He was dressed in ordinary
clothing, but Mary Makebelieve knew him at once for that great
policeman who guided the traffic at the Grafton Street crossing.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>X</h2>

<p>The policeman told her wonderful things. He informed her why the
Phoenix Park was called the Phoenix Park. He did not believe there was
a phoenix in the Zoological Gardens, although they probably had every
kind of bird in the world there. It had never struck him, now he came
to think of it, to look definitely for that bird, but he would do so
the next time he went into the Gardens. Perhaps the young lady would
allow him (it would be a much-appreciated privilege) to escort her
through the Gardens some fine day--the following day, for instance...?
He rather inclined to the belief that the phoenix was extinct--that is,
died out; and then, again, when he called to mind the singular habits
with which this bird was credited, he conceived that it had never had a
real but only a mythical existence--that is, it was a makebelieve bird,
a kind of fairy tale.</p>

<p>He further informed Mary Makebelieve that this Park was the third
largest in the world, but the most beautiful. His evidence for this
statement was not only the local newspapers, whose opinion might be
biased by patriotism--that is, led away from the exact truth; but in
the more stable testimony of reputable English journals, such as
<i>Answers</i> and <i>Tit-Bits</i> and <i>Pearson's Weekly</i>, he
found an authoritative and gratifying confirmation--that is, they
agreed. He cited for Mary Makebelieve's incredulity the exact immensity
of the Park in miles, in yards, and in acres, and the number of head of
cattle which could be accommodated therein if it were to be utilised
for grazing--that is, turned into grass lands; or, if transformed into
tillage, the number of small farmers who would be the proprietors of
economic holdings--that is, a recondite--that is, an abstruse and a
difficult scientific and sociological term.</p>

<p>Mary Makebelieve scarcely dared lift her glance to his face. An
uncontrollable shyness had taken possession of her. Her eyes could not
lift without an effort; they fluttered vainly upwards, but before
reaching any height they flinched aside and drooped again to her lap.
The astounding thought that she was sitting beside a man warmed and
affrighted her blood so that it rushed burningly to her cheeks and went
shuddering back again coldly. Her downcast eyes were almost mesmerised
by the huge tweed-clad knees which towered like monoliths beside her.
They rose much higher than her knees did, and extended far out more
than a foot and a half beyond her own modest stretch. Her knees slanted
gently downwards as she sat, but his jagged straitly forward, like the
immovable knees of a god which she had seen once in the Museum. On one
of these great knees an equally great hand rested. Automatically she
placed her own hand on her lap and, awe-stricken, tried to measure the
difference. Her hand was very tiny and as white as snow; it seemed so
light that the breathing of a wind might have fluttered it. The wrist
was slender and delicate, and through its milky covering faint blue
veins glimmered. A sudden and passionate wish came to her as she
watched her wrist. She wished she had a red coral bracelet on it, or a
chain of silver beaten into flat discs, or even two twists of little
green beads. The hand that rested on the neighbouring knee was bigger
by three times than her own, the skin on it was tanned to the colour of
ripe mahogany-wood, and the heat of the day had caused great purple
veins to grow in knots and ridges across the back and running in big
twists down to the wrists. The specific gravity of that hand seemed
tremendous; she could imagine it holding down the strong neck of a
bull. It moved continually while he spoke to her, closing in a tense
strong grip that changed the mahogany colour to a dull whiteness, and
opening again to a ponderous, inert width.</p>

<p>She was ashamed that she could find nothing to say. Her vocabulary
had suddenly and miserably diminished to a "yes" and "no," only
tolerably varied by a timid "indeed" and "I did not know that." Against
the easy clamour of his speech she could find nothing to oppose, and
ordinarily her tongue tripped and eddied and veered as easily and
nonchalantly as a feather in a wind. But he did not mind silence. He
interpreted it rightly as the natural homage of a girl to a policeman.
He liked this homage because it helped him to feel as big as he looked,
and he had every belief in his ability to conduct a polite and
interesting conversation with any lady for an indefinite time.</p>

<p>After a while Mary Makebelieve arose and was about bidding him a
timid good-bye. She wished to go away to her own little room where she
could look at herself and ask herself questions. She wanted to
visualise herself sitting under a tree beside a man. She knew that she
could reconstruct him to the smallest detail, but feared that she might
not be able to reconstruct herself. When she arose he also stood up,
and fell so naturally into step beside her that there was nothing to do
but to walk straight on. He still withstood the burden of conversation
easily and pleasantly and very learnedly. He discussed matters of high
political and social moment, explaining generously the more unusual and
learned words which bristled from his vocabulary. Soon they came to a
more populous part of the Park. The children ceased from their play to
gaze round-eyed at the little girl and the big man; their attendants
looked and giggled and envied. Under these eyes Mary Makebelieve's walk
became afflicted with a sideward bias which jolted her against her
companion. She was furious with herself and ashamed. She set her teeth
to walk easily and straightly, but constantly the jog of his elbow on
her shoulder or the swing of his hand against her blouse sent her
ambling wretchedly arm's-length from him. When this had occurred half a
dozen times she could have plumped down on the grass and wept loudly
and without restraint. At the Park gate she stopped suddenly and, with
the courage of despair, bade him good-bye. He begged courteously to be
allowed to see her a little way to her home, but she would not permit
it, and so he lifted his hat to her. (Through her distress she could
still note in a subterranean and half-conscious fashion the fact that
this was the first time a man had ever uncovered before her.) As she
went away down the road she felt that his eyes were following her, and
her tripping walk hurried almost to a run. She wished frantically that
her dress was longer than it was--that false hem! If she could have
gathered a skirt in her hand, the mere holding on to something would
have given her self-possession, but she feared he was looking
critically at her short skirt and immodest ankles.</p>

<p>He stood for a time gazing after her with a smile on his great face.
He knew that she knew he was watching, and as he stood he drew his hand
from his pocket and tapped and smoothed his moustache. He had a red
moustache; it grew very thickly, but was cropped short and square, and
its fibre was so strong that it stood out above his lip like wire. One
expected it to crackle when he touched it, but it never did.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Makebelieve came home that night she seemed very tired,
and complained that her work at Mrs. O'Connor's house was arduous
beyond any which she had yet engaged in. She enumerated the many rooms
that were in the house: those that were covered with carpets, the
margins whereof had to be beeswaxed; those others, only partially
covered with rugs, which had to be entirely waxed; the upper rooms were
uncarpeted and unrugged, and had, therefore, to be scrubbed; the
basement, consisting of two red-flagged kitchens and a scullery, had
also to be scoured out. The lady was very particular about the scouring
of wainscotings and doors. The upper part of the staircase was bare and
had to be scrubbed down, and the part down to the hall had a thin strip
of carpet on it secured by brazen rods; the margins on either side of
this carpet had to be beeswaxed and the brass rods polished. There was
a great deal of unnecessary and vexatious brass of one kind or another
scattered about the house, and as there were four children in the
family, besides Mrs. O'Connor and her two, sisters, the amount of
washing which had constantly to be done was enormous and
terrifying.</p>

<p>During their tea Mrs. Makebelieve called to mind the different
ornaments which stood on the parlour mantelpiece and on the top of the
piano.. There was a china shepherdess with a basket of flowers at one
end of the mantelpiece and an exact duplicate on the other. In the
centre a big clock of speckled marble was surmounted by a little domed
edifice with Corinthian pillars in front, and this again was topped by
the figure of an archer with a bent bow--there was nothing on top of
this figure because there was not any room. Between each of these
articles there stood little framed photographs of members of Mrs.
O'Connor's family, and behind all there was a carved looking-glass with
bevelled edges having many shelves. Each shelf had a cup or a saucer or
a china bowl on it. On the left-hand side of the fireplace there was a
plaque whereon a young lady dressed in a sky-blue robe crossed by means
of well-defined stepping-stones a thin but furious stream; the middle
distance was embellished by a cow, and the horizon sustained two white
lambs, a brown dog, a fountain, and a sun-dial. On the right-hand side
a young gentleman clad in a crimson coat and yellow knee-breeches
carried a three-cornered hat under his arm, and he also crossed a
stream which seemed the exact counterpart of the other one and whose
perspective was similarly complicated. There were three pictures on
each wall--nine in all: three of these were pictures of ships; three
were pictures of battles; two portrayed saintly but emaciated
personages sitting in peculiarly disheartening wildernesses (each
wilderness contained one cactus plant and a camel). One of these
personages stared fixedly at a skull; the other personage looked with
intense firmness away from a lady of scant charms in a white and
all-too-insufficient robe: above the robe a segment of the lady's bosom
was hinted at bashfully--it was probably this the personage looked
firmly away from. The remaining picture showed a little girl seated in
a big arm-chair and reading with profound culture the most massive of
Bibles: she had her grandmother's mutch cap and spectacles on, and
looked very sweet and solemn; a doll sat bolt upright beside her, and
on the floor a kitten hunted a ball of wool with great earnestness.</p>

<p>All these things Mrs. Makebelieve discussed to her daughter, as also
of the carpet which might have been woven in Turkey or elsewhere, the
sideboard that possibly was not mahogany, and the chairs and occasional
tables whose legs had attained to rickets through convulsions; the
curtains of cream-coloured lace which were reinforced by rep hangings
and guarded shutters from Venice, also the deer's head which stood on a
shelf over the door and was probably shot by a member of the family in
a dream, and the splendid silver tankards which flanked this trophy and
were possibly made of tin.</p>

<p>Mrs. Makebelieve further spoke of the personal characteristics of
the householder with an asperity which was still restrained. She had a
hairy chin, said Mrs. Makebelieve: she had buck teeth and a solid
smile, and was given to telling people who knew their business how
things ought to be done. Beyond this she would not say anything--The
amount of soap the lady allowed to wash out five rooms and a lengthy
staircase was not as generous as one was accustomed to, but, possibly,
she was well-meaning enough when one came to know her better.</p>

<p>Mary Makebelieve, apropos of nothing, asked her mother did she ever
know a girl who got married to a policeman, and did she think that
policemen were good men?</p>

<p>Her mother replied that policemen were greatly sought after as
husbands for several reasons--firstly, they were big men, and big men
are always good to look upon; secondly, their social standing was very
high and their respectability undoubted; thirdly, a policeman's pay was
such as would bring comfort to any household which was not needlessly
and criminally extravagant, and this was often supplemented in a
variety of ways which rumour only hinted at (there was also the safe
prospect of a pension and the possibility of a sergeantship, where the
emoluments were very great); and fourthly, a policeman, being subjected
for many years to a rigorous discipline, would likely make a nice and
obedient husband. Personally Mrs. Makebelieve did not admire
policemen--they thought too much of themselves, and their continual
pursuit of and intercourse with criminals tended to deteriorate their
moral tone; also, being much admired by a certain type of woman, their
morals were subjected to so continuous an assault that the wife of such
a one would be worn to a shadow in striving to preserve her husband
from designing and persistent females.</p>

<p>Mary Makebelieve said she thought it would be nice to have other
women dying for love of one's husband, but her mother opposed this with
the reflection that such people did not die for love at all--they were
merely anxious to gratify a foolish and excessive pride, or to inflict
pain on respectable married women. On the whole, a policeman was not an
ideal person to marry. The hours at which he came home were liable to
constant and vexatious changes, so that there was a continual feeling
of insecurity, which was bad for housekeeping; and if one had not
stability in one's home all discipline and all real home life was at an
end. There was this to be said for them--that they all loved little
children. But, all things considered, a clerk made a better husband:
his hours were regular, and knowing where he was at any moment, one's
mind was at ease.</p>

<p>Mary Makebelieve was burning to tell some one of her adventure
during the day, but although she had never before kept a secret from
her mother she was unable to tell her this one. Something--perhaps the
mere difference of age, and also a kind of shyness--kept her silent.
She wished she knew a nice girl of her own age, or even a little
younger, to whose enraptured ear she might have confided her story.
They would have hugged each other during the recital, and she would
have been able to enlarge upon an hundred trivialities of moustache and
hair and eyes, the wonder of which older minds can seldom
appreciate.</p>

<p>Her mother said she did not feel at all well. She did not know what
was the matter with her, but she was more tired than she could remember
being for a long time. There was a dull aching in all her bones, a
coldness in her limbs, and when she pressed her hair backwards it hurt
her head; so she went to bed much earlier than was usual. But long
after her regular time for sleep had passed Mary Makebelieve crouched
on the floor before the few warm coals. She was looking into the
redness, seeing visions of rapture, strange things which could not
possibly be true; but these visions warmed her blood and lifted her
heart on light and tremulous wings; there was a singing in her ears to
which she could never be tired listening.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>XII</h2>

<p>Mrs. Makebelieve felt much better the next morning after the extra
sleep which she had. She still confessed to a slight pain in her scalp
when she brushed her hair, and was a little languid, but not so much as
to call for complaint. She sat up in bed while her daughter prepared
the breakfast, and her tongue sped as rapidly as heretofore. She said
she had a sort of feeling that her brother Patrick must come back from
America some time, and she was sure that when he did return he would
lose no time in finding out his relatives and sharing with them the
wealth which he had amassed in that rich country. She had memories of
his generosity even as a mere infant, when he would always say "no" if
only half a potato remained in the dish or a solitary slice of bread
was on the platter. She delighted to talk of his good looks and high
spirits and of the amazingly funny things he had said and done. There
was always, of course, the chance that Patrick had got married and
settled down in America, and, if so, that would account for so
prolonged a silence. Wives always came between a man and his friends,
and this woman would do all she could to prevent Patrick benefiting his
own sister and her child. Even in Ireland there were people like that,
and the more one heard of America the less one knew what to expect from
the strange people who were native to that place. She had often thought
she would like to go out there herself, and, indeed, if she had a
little money she would think nothing of packing up her things to-morrow
and setting out for the States. There were fine livings to be made
there, and women were greatly in request, both as servants and wives.
It was well known, too, that the Americans loved Irish people, and so
there would be no difficulty at all in getting a start. The more she
thought of Mrs. O'Connor, the more favourably she pondered on
emigration. She would say nothing against Mrs. O'Connor yet, but the
fact remained that she had a wen on her cheek and buck teeth. Either of
these afflictions taken separately was excusable, but together she
fancied they betoken a bad, sour nature; but maybe the woman was to be
pitied: she might be a nice person in herself, but, then, there was the
matter of the soap, and she was very fond of giving unnecessary orders.
However, time would show, and, clients being as scarce as they were,
one could not quarrel with one's bread and butter.</p>

<p>The opening of a door and the stamping downstairs of heavy feet shot
Mrs. Makebelieve from her bed and into her clothing with furious speed.
Within five minutes she was dressed, and after kissing her daughter
three times she fled down the stairs and away to her business.</p>

<p>Mary had obtained her mother's consent to do as she pleased with the
piece of black velvet on the hem of her Sunday skirt, so she passed
some time in ripping this off and cleaning it. It would not come as
fresh as she desired, and there were some parts of it frayed and rubbed
so that the velvet was nearly lost, but other portions were quite good,
and by cutting out the worn parts and neatly joining the good pieces
she at last evolved a quite passable sash. Having the sash ready, she
dressed herself to see how it looked, and was delighted. Then, becoming
dissatisfied with the severe method of doing her hair, she manipulated
it gently for a few minutes until a curl depended by both ears and two
or three very tiny ones fluttered above her forehead. She put on her
hat and stole out, walking very gently for fear any of the other people
in the house would peep through their doors as she went by. Walk as
gently as she could, these bare, solid stairs rang loudly to each
footfall, and so she ended in a rush and was out and away without
daring to look if she was observed. She had a sort of guilty feeling as
she walked, which she tried to allay by saying very definitely that she
was not doing anything wrong. She said to herself with determined
candour that she would walk up to the St. Stephen's Green Park and look
at the ducks and the flower-beds and the eels, but when she reached the
quays she blushed deeply, and turning towards the right, went rapidly
in the direction of the Phoenix Park. She told herself that she was not
going in there, but would merely take a walk by the river, cross at
Island Bridge, and go back on the opposite side of the Liffey to the
Green. But when she saw the broad sunlit road gleaming through the big
gates she thought she would go for a little way up there to look at the
flowers behind the railings. As she went in a great figure came from
behind the newspaper kiosk outside the gates and followed Mary up the
road. When she paused to look at the flowers the great figure halted
also, and when she went on again it followed. Mary walked past the
Gough Statue and turned away into the fields and the trees, and here
the figure lengthened its stride. In the middle of the field a big
shadow bobbed past her shoulder, and she walked on holding her breath
and watching the shadow growing by queer forward jerks. In a moment the
dull beat of feet on grass banished all thought of the shadow, and then
there came a cheerful voice in her ears, and the big policeman was
standing by her side. For a few moments they were stationary, making
salutation and excuse and explanation, and then they walked slowly on
through the sunshine. Wherever there was a bush there were flowers on
it. Every tree was thronged with birds that sang shrilly and sweetly in
sudden thrills and clear sustained melodies, but in the open spaces the
silence was more wonderful; there was no bird note to come between Mary
and that deep voice, no shadow of a tree to swallow up their own two
shadows; and the sunlight was so mildly warm, the air was so sweet and
pure, and the little wind that hushed by from the mountains was a
tender and a peaceful wind.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>XIII</h2>

<p>After that day Mary Makebelieve met her new friend frequently.
Somehow, wherever she went, he was not far away; he seemed to spring
out of space--one moment she was alone watching the people passing and
the hurrying cars and the thronged and splendid shop windows, and then
a big voice was booming down to her and a big form was pacing
deliberately by her side. Twice he took her into a restaurant and gave
her lunch. She had never been in a restaurant before, and it seemed to
her like a place in fairyland. The semi-darkness of the retired rooms
faintly coloured by tiny electric lights, the beautifully clean tables
and the strange foods, the neatly dressed waitresses with quick, deft
movements and gravely attentive faces--these things thrilled her. She
noticed that the girls in the restaurant, in spite of their gravity and
industry, observed both herself and the big man with the minutest
inspection, and she felt that they all envied her the attentions of so
superb a companion. In the street also she found that many people
looked at them, but, listening to his constant and easy speech, she
could not give these people the attention they deserved.</p>

<p>When they did not go to the Park they sought the most reserved
streets or walked out to the confines of the town and up by the river
Dodder. There are exquisitely beautiful places along the side of the
Dodder: shy little harbours and backwaters, and now and then a
miniature waterfall or a broad, placid reach upon which the sun beats
down like silver. Along the river-bank the grass grows rank and wildly
luxurious, and at this season, warmed by the sun, it was a splendid
place to sit. She thought she could sit there for ever watching the
shining river and listening to the great voice by her side.</p>

<p>He told her many things about himself and about his comrades--those
equally huge men. She could see them walking with slow vigour through
their barrack-yard, falling in for exercise or gymnastics or for
school. She wondered what they were taught, and who had sufficient
impertinence to teach giants, and were they ever slapped for not
knowing their lessons? He told her of his daily work, the hours when he
was on and off duty, the hours when he rose in the morning and when he
went to bed. He told her of night duty, and drew a picture of the blank
deserted streets which thrilled and frightened her...the tense
darkness, and how through the silence the sound of a footstep was
magnified a thousand-fold, ringing down the desolate pathways away and
away to the smallest shrill distinctness; and she saw also the alleys
and lane-ways hooded in blackness, and the one or two human fragments
who drifted aimless and frantic along the lonely streets, striving to
walk easily for fear of their own thundering footsteps, cowering in the
vastness of the city, dwarfed and shivering beside the gaunt houses;
the thousands upon thousands of black houses, each deadly silent, each
seeming to wait and listen for the morning, and each teeming with men
and women who slept in peace because he was walking up and down
outside, flashing his lantern on shop windows, and feeling doors to see
if they were by any chance open. Now and again a step from a great
distance would tap-tap-tap, a far-off delicacy of sound, and either die
away down echoing side streets or come clanking on to where he stood,
growing louder and clearer and more resonant, ringing again and again
in doubled and trebled echoes; while he, standing far back in a
doorway, watched to see who was abroad at the dead of night--and then
that person went away on his strange errand, his footsteps trampling
down immense distances, till the last echo and the last faint tremble
of his feet eddied into the stillness. Now and again a cat dodged
gingerly along a railing, or a strayed dog slunk fearfully down the
pathway, nosing everywhere in and out of the lamplight, silent and
hungry and desperately eager. He told her stories also, wonderful tales
of great fights and cunning tricks, of men and women whose whole lives
were tricks, of people who did not know how to live except by theft and
violence; people who were born by stealth, who ate by subterfuge, drank
by dodges, got married in attics, and slid into death by strange,
subterranean passages. He told her the story of the Two Hungry Men, and
of The Sailor who had been Robbed, and a funny tale about the Barber
who had Two Mothers. He also told her the stories of The Eight Tinkers
and of the Old Women who Steal Fish at Night-time, and the story of The
Man he Let Off, and he told her a terrible story of how he fought five
men in a little room, and he showed her a great livid scar hidden by
his cap, and the marks in his neck where he had been stabbed with a
jagged bottle, and his wrist which an Italian madman had thrust through
and through with a dagger.</p>

<p>But though he was always talking, he was not always talking of
himself. Through his conversation there ran a succession of
queries--tiny, slender questions which ran out of his stories and into
her life--questions so skilful and natural and spontaneous that only a
girl could discover the curiosity which prompted them. He wanted her
name, her address, her mother's name, her father's name; had she other
relatives, did she go to work yet, what was her religion, was it a long
time since she left school, and what was her mother's business? To all
of these Mary Makebelieve answered with glad candour. She saw each
question coming, and the personal curiosity lying behind it she divined
and was glad of. She would have loved to ask him personal and intimate
questions about his parents, his brothers and sisters, and what he said
when he said his prayers, and had he walked with other girls, and, if
so, what had he said to them, and what did he really and truly think of
her? Her curiosity on all these points was abundant and eager, but she
did not dare to even hint a question.</p>

<p>One of the queries often touched upon by him she eluded--she shrank
from it with something like terror--it was, "What was her mother's
business?" She could not bear to say that her mother was a charwoman.
It did not seem fitting. She suddenly hated and was ashamed of this
occupation. It took on an aspect of incredible baseness. It seemed to
be the meanest employment wherein any one could be engaged; and so when
the question, conveyed in a variety of ways, had to be answered it was
answered with reservations--Mary Makebelieve told him a lie. She said
her mother was a dressmaker.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>XIV</h2>

<p>One night when Mrs. Makebelieve came home she was very low-spirited
indeed. She complained once more of a headache and of a languor which
she could not account for. She said it gave her all the trouble in the
world to lift a bucket. It was not exactly that she could not lift a
bucket, but that she could scarcely close her mind down to the fact
that a bucket had to be lifted. Some spring of willingness seemed to be
temporarily absent. To close her two hands on a floor-cloth and twist
it into a spiral in order to wring it thoroughly was a thing which she
found herself imagining she could do if she liked, but had not the
least wish to do. These duties, even when she was engaged in them, had
a curious quality of remoteness. The bucket into which her hand had
been plunged a moment before seemed somehow incredibly distant. To lift
the soap lying beside the bucket one would require an arm of more than
human reach, and having washed, or rather dabbed, at a square of
flooring, it was a matter of grave concern how to reach the unwashed
part just beyond without moving herself. This languor alarmed her. The
pain in her head, while it was severe, did not really matter. Every one
had pains and aches, sores and sprains, but this unknown weariness and
disinclination for the very slightest exertion gave her a fright.</p>

<p>Mary tempted her to come out and watch the people going into the
Gaiety Theatre. She said a certain actor was playing whom all the women
of Dublin make pilgrimages, even from distant places, to look at; and
by going at once they might be in time to see him arriving in a
motor-car at the stage door, when they could have a good look at him
getting out of the car and going into the theatre. At these tidings
Mrs. Makebelieve roused for a moment from her strange apathy. Since
tea-time she had sat (not as usual upright and gesticulating, but
humped up and flaccid) staring at a blob of condensed milk on the
outside of the tin. She said she thought she would go out and see the
great actor, although what all the women saw in him to go mad about she
did not know, but in another moment she settled back to her humped-up
position and restored her gaze to the condensed milk tin. With a little
trouble Mary got her to bed, where, after being hugged for one moment,
she went swiftly and soundly to sleep.</p>

<p>Mary was troubled because of her mother's illness, but, as it is
always difficult to believe in the serious illness of another person
until death has demonstrated its gravity, she soon dismissed the matter
from her mind. This was the more easily done because her mind was
teeming with impressions and pictures and scraps of dialogue.</p>

<p>As her mother was sleeping peacefully, Mary put on her hat and went
out. She wanted, in her then state of mind, to walk in the solitude
which can only be found in crowded places, and also she wanted some
kind of distraction. Her days had lately been so filled with adventure
that the placid immobility of the top back room was not only irksome
but maddening, and her mother's hasty and troubled breathing came
between her and her thoughts. The poor furniture of the room was
hideous to her eyes; the uncarpeted floor and bleak, stained walls
dulled her.</p>

<p>She went out, and in a few moments was part of the crowd which
passes and repasses nightly from the Rotunda up the broad pathways of
Sackville Street, across O'Connell Bridge, up Westmoreland Street, past
Trinity College, and on through the brilliant lights of Grafton Street
to the Fusiliers' Arch at the entrance to St. Stephen's Green Park.
Here from half-past seven o'clock in the evening youthful Dublin
marches in joyous procession. Sometimes bevies of young girls dance by,
each a giggle incarnate. A little distance behind these a troop of
young men follow stealthily and critically. They will be acquainted and
more or less happily paired before the Bridge is reached. But generally
the movement is in couples. Appointments, dating from the previous
night, have filled the streets with happy and careless boys and
girls--they are not exactly courting, they are enjoying the excitement
of fresh acquaintance; old conversation is here poured into new
bottles, old jokes have the freshness of infancy, every one is
animated, and polite to no one but his partner; the people they meet
and pass and those who overtake and pass them are all subjects for
their wit and scorn, while they, in turn, furnish a moment's amusement
and conversation to each succeeding couple. Constantly there are
stoppages when very high-bred introductions result in a re-distribution
of the youngsters. As they move apart the words "To-morrow night," or
"Thursday," or "Friday" are called laughingly back, showing that the
late partner is not to be lost sight of utterly; and then the
procession begins anew.</p>

<p>Among these folk Mary Makebelieve passed rapidly. She knew that if
she walked slowly some partially--elaborate gentleman would ask
suddenly what she had been doing with herself since last Thursday, and
would introduce her as Kate Ellen to six precisely similar young
gentlemen, who smiled blandly in a semicircle six feet distant. This
had happened to her once before, and as she fled the six young
gentlemen had roared "Bow, wow, wow" after her, while the seventh mewed
earnestly and with noise.</p>

<p>She stood for a time watching the people thronging into the Gaiety
Theatre. Some came in motor-cars, others in carriages. Many hearse-like
cabs deposited weighty and respectable solemnities under the
glass-roofed vestibule. Swift outside cars buzzed on rubber tyres with
gentlemen clad in evening dress, and ladies whose silken wraps blew
gently from their shoulders, and, in addition, a constant pedestrian
stream surged along the pathway. From the shelter of an opposite
doorway Mary watched these gaily animated people. She envied them all
innocently enough, and wondered would the big policeman ever ask her to
go to the theatre with him, and if he did, would her mother let her go.
She thought her mother would refuse, but was dimly certain that in some
way she would manage to get out if such a delightful invitation were
given her. She was dreaming of the alterations she would make in her
best frock in anticipation of such a treat when, half-consciously, she
saw a big figure appear round the corner of Grafton Street and walk
towards the theatre. It was he, and her heart jumped with delight. She
prayed that he would not see her, and then she prayed that he would,
and then, with a sudden, sickening coldness, she saw that he was not
alone. A young, plump, rosycheeked girl was at his side. As they came
nearer the girl put her arm into his and said something. He bent down
to her and replied, and she flashed a laugh up at him. There was a
swift interchange of sentences, and they both laughed together; then
they disappeared into the half-crown door.</p>

<p>Mary shrank back into the shadow of the doorway. She had a strange
notion that everybody was trying to look at her, and that they were all
laughing maliciously. After a few moments she stepped out on the path
and walked homewards quickly. She did not hear the noises of the
streets, nor see the promenading crowds. Her face was bent down as she
walked, and beneath the big brim of her straw hat her eyes were blinded
with the bitterest tears she had ever shed.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>XV</h2>

<p>Next morning her mother was no better. She made no attempt to get
out of bed, and listened with absolute indifference when the morning
feet of the next-door man pounded the stairs. Mary awakened her again
and again, but each time, after saying "All right, dearie," she
relapsed to a slumber which was more torpor than sleep. Her yellow,
old-ivory face was faintly tinged with colour; her thin lips were
relaxed, and seemed a trifle fuller, so that Mary thought she looked
better in sickness than in health; but the limp arm lying on the
patchwork quilt seemed to be more skinny than thin, and the hand was
more waxen and claw-like than heretofore.</p>

<p>Mary laid the breakfast on the bed as usual, and, again awakened her
mother, who, after staring into vacancy for a few moments, forced
herself to her elbow, and then, with sudden determination, sat up in
the bed and bent her mind inflexibly on her breakfast. She drank two
cups of tea greedily, but the bread had no taste in her mouth, and
after swallowing a morsel she laid it aside.</p>

<p>"I don't know what's up with me at all, at all," said she.</p>

<p>"Maybe it's a cold, mother," replied Mary.</p>

<p>"Do I look bad, now?"</p>

<p>Mary scrutinised her narrowly.</p>

<p>"No," she answered; "your face is redder than it does be, and your
eyes are shiny. I think you look splendid and well. What way do you
feel?"</p>

<p>"I don't feel at all, except that I'm sleepy. Give me the glass in
my hand, dearie, till I see what I'm like."</p>

<p>Mary took the glass from the wall and handed it to her.</p>

<p>"I don't look bad at all. A bit of colour always suited me. Look at
my tongue, though, it's very, very dirty; it's a bad tongue altogether.
My mother had a tongue like that, Mary, when she died."</p>

<p>"Have you any pain?" said her daughter.</p>

<p>"No, dearie; there is a buzz in the front of my head as if something
was spinning round and round very quickly, and that makes my eyes
tired, and there's a sort of feeling as if my head was twice as heavy
as it should be. Hang up the glass again. I'll try and get a sleep, and
maybe I'll be better when I waken up. Run you out and get a bit of
steak, and we'll stew it down and make beef-tea, and maybe that will do
me good. Give me my purse out of the pocket of my skirt."</p>

<p>Mary found the purse and brought it to the bed. Her mother opened it
and brought out a thimble, a bootlace, five buttons, one sixpenny piece
and a penny. She gave Mary the sixpence.</p>

<p>"Get half a pound of leg beef," said she, "and then we'll have
fourpence left for bread and tea: no, take the other penny, too, and
get half a pound of pieces at the butcher's for twopence, and a
twopenny tin of condensed milk, that's fourpence; and a three-ha'penny
loaf and one penny for tea, that's sixpence ha'penny; and get onions
with the odd ha'penny, and we'll put them in the beef-tea. Don't
forget, dearie, to pick lean bits of meat; them fellows do be always
trying to stick bits of bone and gristle on a body. Tell him it's for
beef-tea for your mother, and that I'm not well at all, and ask how
Mrs. Quinn is; she hasn't been down in the shop for a long time. I'll
go to sleep now. I'll have to go to work in the morning whatever
happens, because there isn't any money in the house at all. Come home
as quick as you can, dearie."</p>

<p>Mary dressed herself and went out for the provisions, but she did
not buy them at once. As she went down the street she turned suddenly,
clasping her hands in a desperate movement, and walked very quickly in
the opposite direction. She turned up the side streets to the quays,
and along these to the Park gates. Her hands were clasping and
unclasping in an agony of impatience, and her eyes roved busily here
and there, flying among the few pedestrians like lanterns. She went
through the gates and up the broad central path, and here 'she walked
more slowly: but she did not see the flowers behind the railings, or
even the sunshine that bathed the world in glory. At the monument she
sped a furtive glance down the road she had travelled--there was nobody
behind her. She turned into the fields, walking under trees which she
did not see, and up hills and down valleys without noticing the incline
of either. At times, through the tatter of her mind there blazed a
memory of her mother lying sick at home, waiting for her daughter to
return with food, and at such memories she gripped her hands together
frightfully and banished the thought.--A moment's reflection and she
could have hated her mother.</p>

<p>It was nearly five o'clock before she left the Park. She walked in a
fog of depression. For hours she had gone hither and thither in the
well-remembered circle, every step becoming more wayward and aimless.
The sun had disappeared, and a grey evening bowed down upon the fields;
the little wind that whispered along the grass or swung the light
branches of the trees had a bleak edge to it. As she left the big gates
she was chilled through and through, but the memory of her mother now
set her running homewards. For the time she forgot her quest among the
trees, and thought only, with shame and fear, of what her mother would
say, and of the reproachful, amazed eyes which would be turned on her
when she went in. What could she say? She could not imagine anything.
How could she justify a neglect which must appear gratuitous,
cold-blooded, inexplicable?</p>

<p>When she had brought the food and climbed the resonant stairs she
stood outside the door crying softly to herself. She hated to open the
door. She could imagine her mother sitting up in the bed dazed and
unbelieving, angry and frightened, imagining accidents and terrors, and
when she would go in...She had an impulse to open the door gently,
leave the food just inside, and run down the stairs out into the world
anywhere and never come back again. At last in desperation she turned
the handle and stepped inside. Her face flamed; the blood burned her
eyes physically so that she could not see through them. She did not
look at the bed, but went direct to the fireplace, and with a dogged
patience began mending the fire. After a few stubborn moments she
twisted violently to face whatever might come, ready to break into
angry reproaches and impertinences; but her mother was lying very
still. She was fast asleep, and a weight, an absolutely real pressure,
was lifted from Mary's heart. Her fingers flew about the preparation of
the beef-tea. She forgot the man whom she had gone to meet. Her arms
were tired and hungry to close around her mother. She wanted to whisper
little childish words to her, to rock her to and fro on her breast, and
croon little songs and kiss her and pat her face.</p>

<p>Her mother did not get better. Indeed, she got worse. In addition to
the lassitude of which she had complained, she suffered also from great
heat and great cold, and, furthermore, sharp pains darted so swiftly
through her brows that at times she was both dizzy and sightless. A
twirling movement in her head prevented her from standing up. Her
centre of gravity seemed destroyed, for when she did stand and
attempted to walk she had a strange bearing away on one side, so that
on striving to walk towards the door she veered irresistibly at least
four feet to the left-hand side of that point. Mary Makebelieve helped
her back to bed, where she lay for a time watching horizontal lines
spinning violently in front of her face, and these lines after a time
crossed and recrossed each other in so mazy and intricate a pattern
that she became violently sick from the mere looking at them.</p>

<p>All of these things she described to her daughter, tracing the queer
patterns which were spinning about her with such fidelity that Mary was
almost able to see them. She also theorised about the cause and
ultimate effect of these symptoms, and explained the degrees of heat
and cold which burned or chilled her, and the growth of a pain to its
exquisite startling apex, its subsequent slow recession, and the thud
of an india-rubber hammer which ensued when the pain had ebbed to its
easiest level. It did not occur to either of them to send for a doctor.
Doctors in such cases are seldom sent for, seldom even thought of. One
falls sick according to some severely definite, implacable law with
which it is foolish to quarrel, and one gets well again for no other
reason than that it is impossible to be sick for ever. As the night
struggles slowly into day, so sickness climbs stealthily into health,
and nature has a system of medicining her ailments which might only be
thwarted by the ministrations of a mere doctor. Doctors also expect
payment for their services--an expectation so wildly beyond the range
of common sense as to be ludicrous. Those who can scarcely fee a baker
when they are in health can certainly not remunerate a physician when
they are ill.</p>

<p>But, despite her sickness, Mrs. Makebelieve was worried with the
practical common politics of existence. The food purchased with her
last sevenpence was eaten beyond remembrance. The vital requirements of
the next day, and the following day, and of all subsequent days
thronged upon her, clamouring for instant attention. The wraith of a
landlord sat on her bed demanding rent and threatening grisly
alternatives. Goblins that were bakers and butchers and grocers grinned
and leered and jabbered from the corners of the room.</p>

<p>Each day Mary Makebelieve went to the pawn office with something.
They lived for a time on the only capital they had--the poor furniture
of their room. Everything which had even the narrowest margin of value
was sold. Mary's dresses kept them for six days. Her mother's Sunday
skirt fed them for another day. They held famine at bay with a
patchwork quilt and a crazy wash-stand. A water-jug and a strip of
oilcloth tinkled momentarily against the teeth of the wolf and
disappeared. The maw of hunger was not incommoded by the window
curtain.</p>

<p>At last the room was as bare as a desert and almost as
uninhabitable. A room without furniture is a ghostly place. Sounds made
therein are uncanny; even the voice puts off its humanity and rings
back with a bleak and hollow note, an empty resonance tinged with the
frost of winter. There is no other sound so deadly, so barren and
dispiriting, as the echoes of an empty room. The gaunt woman in the bed
seemed less gaunt than her residence, and there was nothing more to be
sent to the pawnbroker or the second-hand dealer.</p>

<p>A post-card came from Mrs. O'Connor requesting, in the peremptory
language customary to such communications, that Mrs. Makebelieve would
please call on her the following morning before eight o'clock. Mrs.
Makebelieve groaned as she read it. It meant work and food and the
repurchase of her household goods, and she knew that on the following
morning she would not be able to get up. She lay a while thinking, and
then called her daughter.</p>

<p>"Dearie," said she, "you will have to go to this place in the
morning and try what you can do. Tell Mrs. O'Connor that I am sick, and
that you are my daughter and will do the work, and try and do the best
you can for a while."</p>

<p>She caught her daughter's head down to her bosom and wept over her,
for she saw in this work a beginning and an end--the end of the little
daughter who could be petted and rocked and advised; the beginning of a
womanhood which would grow up to and beyond her, which would collect
and secrete emotions and aspirations and adventures not to be shared
even by a mother; and she saw the failure which this work meant, the
expanding of her daughter's life ripples to a bleak and miserable
horizon where the clouds were soap-suds and floor-cloths, and the
beyond a blank resignation only made energetic by hunger.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear," said she, "I hate to think of you having to do such
work, but it will only be for a while, a week, and then I will be well
again. Only a little week, my love, my sweetheart, my heart's
darling."</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>XVII</h2>

<p>Early on the following morning Mary Makebelieve awakened with a
start. She felt as if some one had called her, and lay for a few
moments to see had her mother spoken. But her mother was still asleep.
Her slumber was at all times almost as energetic as her wakening hours.
She twisted constantly and moved her hands and spoke ramblingly. Odd
interjections, such as "Ah, well!" "No matter!" "Certainly not!" and
"Indeed aye!" shot from her lips like bullets, and at intervals a
sarcastic sniff fretted or astonished her bedfellow into wakefulness.
But now as she lay none of these strenuous ejaculations were audible.
Sighs only, weighty and deep-drawn and very tired, broke on her lips
and lapsed sadly into the desolate room.</p>

<p>Mary Makebelieve lay for a time wondering idly what had awakened her
so completely, for her eyes were wide open and every vestige of sleep
was gone from her brain; and then she remembered that on this morning,
and for the first time in her life, she had to go to work. That
knowledge had gone to bed with her and had awakened her with an
imperious urgency. In an instant she sprang out of bed, huddled on
sufficient clothing for warmth, and set about lighting the fire. She
was far too early awake, but could not compose herself to lie for
another moment in bed. She did not at all welcome the idea of going to
work, but the interest attaching to a new thing, the freshness which
vitalises for a time even the dreariest undertaking, prevented her from
rueing with any bitterness her first day's work. To a young person even
work is an adventure, and anything which changes the usual current of
life is welcome. The fire also went with her; in quite a short time the
flames had gathered to a blaze, and matured, and concentrated to the
glowing redness of perfect combustion; then, when the smoke had
disappeared with the flames, she put on the saucepan of water. Quickly
the saucepan boiled, and she wet the tea. She cut the bread into
slices, put a spoonful of condensed milk into each cup, and awakened
her mother.</p>

<p>All through the breakfast her mother advised her on the doing of her
work. She cautioned her daughter when scrubbing woodwork always to
scrub against the grain, for this gave a greater purchase to the brush,
and removed the dirt twice as quickly as the seemingly easy opposite
movement. She told her never to save soap--little soap meant much
rubbing--and advised that she should scrub two minutes with one hand
and then two minutes with the other hand; and she was urgent on the
necessity of thoroughness in the wringing out of one's floor-cloth,
because a dry floor-cloth takes up twice as much water as a wet one,
and thus lightens labour; also she advised Mary to change her positions
as frequently as possible to avoid cramp when scrubbing, and to kneel
up or stand up when wringing her cloths, as this would give her a rest,
and the change of movement would relieve her very greatly; and above
all to take her time about the business, because haste seldom resulted
in clean work, and was never appreciated by one's employer.</p>

<p>Before going out Mary Makebelieve had to arrange for some one to
look after her mother during the day. This is an arrangement which,
among poor people, is never difficult of accomplishment. The first to
whom she applied was the labouring man's wife in the next room; she was
a vast woman with six children and a laugh like the rolling of a great
wind, and when Mary Makebelieve advanced her request she shook six
children off her like toys and came out on the landing.</p>

<p>"Run off to your work now, honey," said she, "and let you be easy in
your mind about your mother, for I'll go up to her this minute, and
when I'm not there myself I'll leave one of the children with her to
call me if she wants anything; and don't you be fretting at all, God
help you! for she'll be as safe and as comfortable with me as if she
was in Jervis Street Hospital or the Rotunda itself. What's wrong with
her now? Is it a pain in her head she has, or a sick stomach, God help
her?"</p>

<p>Mary explained briefly, and as she went down the stairs she saw the
big woman going into her mother's room.</p>

<p>She had not been out in the streets so early before, and had never
known the wonder and beauty of the sun in the early morning. The
streets were almost deserted, and the sunlight--a most delicate and
nearly colourless radiance--fell gently on the long silent paths.
Missing the customary throng of people and traffic, she seemed almost
in a strange country, and had to look twice for turnings which she
could easily have found with her eyes shut. The shutters were up in all
the shops, and the blinds were down in most of the windows. Now and
again a milk cart came clattering and rattling down a street, and now
and again a big red-painted baker's cart dashed along the road. Such
few pedestrians as she met were poorly dressed men, who carried tommy
cans and tools, and they were all walking at a great pace, as if they
feared they were late for somewhere. Three or four boys passed her
running; one of these had a great lump of bread in his hand, and as he
ran he tore pieces off the bread with his teeth and ate them. The
streets looked cleaner than she had thought they could look, and the
houses seemed very quiet and beautiful. When she came near a policeman
she looked at him keenly from a distance, hoping and fearing that it
might be her friend, but she did not see him. She had a sinking feeling
at the thought that maybe he would be in the Phoenix Park this day
looking for her, and might, indeed, have been there for the past few
days, and the thought that he might be seeking for her unavailingly
stabbed through her mind like a pain. It did not seem right, it was not
in proportion, that so big a man should seek for a mere woman and not
find one instantly to hand. It was pitiful to think of the huge man
looking on this side and on that, peering behind trees and through
distances, and thinking that maybe he was forgotten or scorned. Mary
Makebelieve almost wept at the idea that he should fancy she scorned
him. She wondered how, under such circumstances, a small girl can
comfort a big man. One may fondle his hand, but that is miserably
inadequate. She wished she was twice as big as he was, so that she
might lift him bodily to her breast and snuggle and hug him like a
kitten. So comprehensive an embrace alone could atone for injury to a
big man's feelings.</p>

<p>In about twenty minutes she reached Mrs. O'Connor's house and
knocked. She had to knock half a dozen times before she was admitted,
and on being admitted had a great deal of trouble explaining who she
was, and why her mother had not come, and that she was quite competent
to undertake the work. She knew the person who opened the door for her
was not Mrs. O'Connor, because she had not a hairy wart on her chin,
nor had she buck teeth. After a little delay she was brought to the
scullery and given a great pile of children's clothing to wash, and
after starting this work she was left to herself for a long time.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>XVIII</h2>

<p>It was a dark house. The windows were all withered away behind stiff
curtains, and the light that laboured between these was chastened to
the last degree of respectability. The doors skulked behind heavy plush
hangings. The floors hid themselves decently under thick red and black
carpets, and the margins which were uncarpeted were disguised by
beeswax, so that no one knew they were there at all. The narrow hall
was steeped in shadow, for there two black velvet portieres, at
distances of six feet apart, depended from rods in the ceiling. Similar
palls flopped on each landing of the staircase, and no sound was heard
in the house at all, except dim voices that droned from somewhere,
muffled and sepulchral and bodiless.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock, having finished the washing, Mary was visited by
Mrs. O'Connor, whom she knew at once by the signs she had been warned
of. The lady subjected each article that had been washed to a
particular scrutiny, and, with the shadowy gallop of a smile that
dashed into and out of sight in an instant, said they would do. She
then conducted Mary to the kitchen and, pointing to a cup of tea and
two slices of bread, invited her to breakfast, and left her for six
minutes, when she reappeared with the suddenness of a marionette and
directed her to wash her cup and saucer, and then to wash the kitchen,
and these things also Mary did.</p>

<p>She got weary very soon, but not dispirited, because there were many
things to look at in the kitchen. There were pots of various sizes and
metals, saucepans little and big, jugs of all shapes, and a regiment of
tea things were ranged on the dresser; on the walls were hung great
pot-lids like the shields of barbarous warriors which she had seen in a
story-book. Under the kitchen table there was a row of boots, all
wrinkled by usage, and each wearing a human and almost intelligent
aspect--a well-wrinkled boot has often an appearance of mad humanity
which can chain and almost hypnotise the observer. As she lifted the
boots out of her way she named each by its face. There was Grubtoes,
Sloucher, Thump-thump, Hoppit, Twitter, Hide-away, and Fairybell.</p>

<p>While she was working a young girl came into the kitchen and took up
the boots called Fairybell. Mary just tossed a look at her as she
entered and bent again to her washing. Then with an extreme
perturbation she stole another look. The girl was young and as trim as
a sunny garden. Her face was packed with laughter and freedom, like a
young morning when tender rosy clouds sail in the sky. She walked with
a light spring of happiness; each step seemed the beginning of a dance,
light and swift and certain. Mary knew her in a pang, and her bent face
grew redder than the tiles she was scrubbing. Like lightning she knew
her. Her brain swung in a clamour of "Where, where?" and even in the
question she had the answer, for this was the girl she had seen going
into the Gaiety Theatre swinging on the arm of her big policeman. The
girl said "Good morning" to her in a kindly voice, and Mary, with a
swift, frightened glance, whispered back "Good morning"; then the girl
went upstairs again, and Mary continued to scrub the floor.</p>

<p>When the kitchen was finished and inspected and approved of, she was
instructed to wash out the front hall, and set about the work at
once.</p>

<p>"Get it done as quickly as you can," said the mistress; "I am
expecting my nephew here soon, and he dislikes washing."</p>

<p>So Mary bent quickly to her work. She was not tired now. Her hands
moved swiftly up and down the floor without effort. Indeed, her actions
were almost mechanical. The self that was thinking and probing seemed
somehow apart from the body bending over the bucket, and the hands that
scrubbed and dipped and wrung. She had finished about three-quarters of
the hall when a couple of sharp raps came to the door. Mrs. O'Connor
flew noiselessly up from the kitchen.</p>

<p>"I knew," said she bitterly, "that you would not be finished before
he came. Dry that puddle at once, so that he can walk in, and take the
soap out of the way."</p>

<p>She stood with her hand on the door while Mary followed these
directions; then, when a couple of hasty movements had removed the
surplus water, Mrs. O'Connor drew the bolt and her nephew entered. Mary
knew him on the doorstep, and her blood froze in terror and boiled
again in shame.</p>

<p>Mrs. O'Connor drew the big policeman inside and kissed him.</p>

<p>"I can't get these people to do things in time," said she. "They are
that slow! Hang up your hat and coat and come into the parlour."</p>

<p>The policeman, with his eyes fixed steadily on Mary, began to take
off his coat. His eyes, his moustache, all his face and figure seemed
to be looking at her. He was an enormous and terrifying interrogation.
He tapped his tough moustache and stepped over the bucket; at the
entrance to the parlour he stood again and hung his monstrous look on
her. He seemed about to speak, but it was to Mrs. O'Connor 'his words
went.</p>

<p>"How's everything?" said he; and then the door closed behind
him.</p>

<p>Mary, with extraordinary slowness, knelt down again beside the
bucket and began to scrub. She worked very deliberately, sometimes
cleaning the same place two or three times. Now and again she sighed,
but without any consciousness of trouble. These were sighs which did
not seem to belong to her. She knew she was sighing, but could not
exactly see how the dull sounds came from her lips when she had no
desire to sigh and did not make any conscious effort to do so. Her mind
was an absolute blank; she could think of nothing but the bubbles which
broke on the floor and in the bucket, and the way the water squeezed
down from the cloth. There was something she could have thought about
if she wanted to, but she did not want to.</p>

<p>Mrs. O'Connor came out in a few minutes, inspected the hall, and
said it would do. She paid Mary her wages and told her to come again
the next day, and Mary went home. As she walked along she was very
careful not to step on any of the lines on the pavement; she walked
between these, and was distressed because these lines were not equally
distant from each other, so that she had to make unequal paces as she
went.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>XIX</h2>

<p>The name of the woman from next door was Mrs. Cafferty. She was big
and round, and when she walked her dress whirled about her like a
tempest. She seemed to be always turning round; when she was going
straight forward in any direction, say towards a press, she would turn
aside midway so sharply that her clothing spun gustily in her
wake--this probably came from having many children. A mother is
continually driving in oblique directions from her household
employments to rescue her children from a multitude of perils. An
infant and a fireplace act upon each other like magnets; a small boy is
always trying to eat a kettle or a piece of coal or the backbone of a
herring; a little girl and a slop-bucket are in immediate contact; the
baby has a knife in its mouth; the twin is on the point of swallowing a
marble, or is trying to wash itself in the butter, or the cat is about
to take a nap on its face. Indeed, the woman who has six children never
knows in what direction her next step must be, and the continual strain
of preserving her progeny converts many a one into regular cyclones of
eyes and arms and legs. It also induces in some a perpetual
good-humoured irritability wherein one can slap and cuddle a child in
the same instant, or shout threateningly or lovingly, call warningly
and murmur encouragingly in an astonishing sequence. The woman with six
children must both physically and mentally travel at a tangent, and
when a husband has to be badgered or humoured into the bargain, then
the life of such a woman is more complex than is readily
understood.</p>

<p>When Mary came home Mrs. Cafferty was sitting on her mother's bed,
two small children and a cat were also on the bed, two slightly bigger
children were under the bed, and two others were galloping furiously up
and down the room. At one moment these latter twain were runaway
horses, at another they were express trains. When they were horses they
snorted and neighed and kicked; when they were trains they backed and
shunted, blew whistles and blew off steam. The children under the bed
were tigers in a jungle, and they made the noises proper to such beasts
and such a place; they bit each other furiously, and howled and growled
precisely as tigers do. The pair of infants on the bed were playing the
game of bump; they would stand upright, then spring high into the air,
and come crashing down on the bed, which then sprung them partly up
again. Each time they jumped they screamed loudly, each time they fell
they roared delighted congratulations to each other, and when they fell
together they fought with strong good humour. Sometimes they fell on
Mrs. Makebelieve; always they bumped her. At the side of the bed their
mother sat telling with a gigantic voice a story wherein her husband's
sister figured as the despicable person she was to the eye of
discernment, and this story was punctuated and shot through and
dislocuted by objurgations, threats, pleadings, admirations, alarms,
and despairs addressed to the children separately and <i>en masse</i>,
by name, nickname, and hastily created epithet.</p>

<p>Mary halted in amazement in the doorway. She could not grasp all the
pandemonium at once, and while she stood Mrs. Cafferty saw her.</p>

<p>"Come on in, honey," said she. "Your ma's as right as a trivet. All
she wanted was a bit of good company and some children to play with.
Deed," she continued, "children are the best medicine for a woman that
I know of. They don't give you time to be sick, the creatures! Patrick
John, I'll give you a smack on the side of the head if you don't let
your little sister alone; and don't you, Norah, be vexing him or you'll
deserve all you get. Run inside, Julia Elizabeth, cut a slice of bread
for the twins, and put a bit of sugar on it, honey. Yes, Alanna, you
can have a slice for yourself, too, you poor child you, well you
deserve it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Makebelieve was sitting up in the bed with two pillows propping
up her back. One of her long thin arms was stretched out to preserve
the twins from being bruised against the wall in their play. Plainly
they had become great friends with her, for every now and then they
swarmed over her, and a hugging match of extreme complexity ensued. She
looked almost her usual self, and all the animation which had been so
marked a feature of her personality had returned to her.</p>

<p>"Are you better, mother?" said Mary.</p>

<p>Mrs. Makebelieve took her daughter's head in her hands and kissed
her until the twins butted them apart, clamouring for caresses.</p>

<p>"I am, honey," said she. "Those children done me good. I could have
got up at one o'clock, I felt so well, but Mrs. Cafferty thought I'd
better not."</p>

<p>"I did so," said Mrs. Cafferty. "Not a foot do you stir out of that
bed till your daughter comes home, ma'm,' said I. For do you see,
child, many's the time you'd be thinking you were well and feeling as
fit as a fiddle, and nothing would be doing you but to be up and
gallivanting about, and then the next day you'd have a relapse, and the
next day you'd be twice as bad, and the day after that they'd be
measuring you for your coffin maybe. I knew a woman was taken like
that--up she got; I'm as well as ever I was,' said she, and she ate a
feed of pig's cheek and cabbage and finished her washing, and they
buried her in a week. It's the quare thing sickness. What I say is,
when you're sick get into bed and stop there."</p>

<p>"It's easy saying that," said Mrs. Makebelieve.</p>

<p>"Sure, don't I know, you poor thing you," said Mrs. Cafferty; "but
you should stay in bed as long as you are able to, anyhow."</p>

<p>"How did you get on with Mrs. O'Connor?" said Mrs. Makebelieve.</p>

<p>"That's the mistress, isn't it?" queried Mrs. Cafferty; "an ould
devil, I'll bet you."</p>

<p>Mrs. Makebelieve rapidly and lightly sketched Mrs. O'Connor's
leading peculiarities.</p>

<p>"It's queer the people one has to work for, God knows it is," said
Mrs. Cafferty.</p>

<p>At this point a grave controversy on work might have arisen, but the
children, caring little for conversation, broke into so tumultuous play
that talk could not be proceeded with. Mary was enticed into a game
composed in part of pussy-four-corners and tip-and-tig, with a general
flavour of leap-frog working through. In five minutes her hair and her
stockings were both down, and the back of her skirt had crawled
three-quarters round to the front. The twins shouted and bumped on the
bed, upon which and on Mrs. Makebelieve they rubbed bread and butter
and sugar, while their mother roared an anecdote at Mrs. Makebelieve in
tones that ruled the din as a fog-horn rules the waves.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>XX</h2>

<p>Mary had lavished the entire of her first day's wages on delicate
foods wherewith to tempt her mother's languid appetite, and when the
morning dawned she arose silently, lit the fire, wet the tea, and
spread her purchases out on the side of the bed. There was a slice of
brawn, two pork sausages, two eggs, three rashers of bacon, a bun, a
pennyworth of sweets, and a pig's foot. These with bread and butter and
tea made a collection amid which an invalid might browse with some
satisfaction. Mary then awakened her, and sat by in a dream of
happiness watching her mother's eye roll slowly and unbelievingly from
item to item. Mrs. Makebelieve tipped each article with her first
finger and put its right name on it unerringly. Then she picked out an
important-looking sweet that had four colours and shone like the sun,
and put it in her mouth.</p>

<p>"I never saw anything like it, you good child you," said she.</p>

<p>Mary rocked herself to and fro and laughed loudly for delight, and
then they ate a bit of everything, and were very happy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Makebelieve said that she felt altogether better that morning.
She had slept like a top all through the night, and, moreover, had a
dream wherein she saw her brother Patrick standing on the remotest sea
point of distant America, from whence he had shouted loudly across the
ocean that he was coming back to Ireland soon, that he had succeeded
very well indeed, and that he was not married. He had not changed in
the slightest degree, said Mrs. Makebelieve, and he looked as young and
as jolly as when he was at home with her father and herself in the
County Meath twenty-two years before. This mollifying dream and the
easy sleep which followed it had completely restored her health and
spirits. Mrs. Makebelieve further intimated that she intended to go to
work that day. It did not fit in with her ideas of propriety that her
child should turn into a charwoman, the more particularly as there was
a strong--an almost certain--possibility of an early betterment of her
own and her daughter's fortunes.</p>

<p>Dreams, said Mrs. Makebelieve, did not come for nothing. There was
more in dreams than was generally understood. Many and many were the
dreams which she herself had been visited by, and they had come true so
often that she could no longer disregard their promises, admonishments,
or threats. Of course many people had dreams which were of no
consequence, and these could usually be traced to gluttony or a
flighty, inconstant imagination. Drunken people, for instance, often
dreamed strange and terrible things, but, even while they were awake,
these people were liable to imaginary enemies whom their clouded eyes
and intellects magnified beyond any thoughtful proportions, and when
they were asleep their dreams would also be subject to this haze and
whirl of unreality and hallucination.</p>

<p>Mary said that sometimes she did not dream at all, and at other
times she dreamed very vividly, but usually could not remember what the
dream had been about when she awakened; and once she had dreamed that
some one gave her a shilling which she placed carefully under her
pillow, and this dream was so real that in the morning she put her hand
under the pillow to see if the shilling was there, but it was not. The
very next night she dreamed the same dream, and as she put the phantom
money under her pillow she said out loudly to herself, "I am dreaming
this, and I dreamt it last night also." Her mother said if she had
dreamt it for the third time some one would have given her a shilling
surely. To this Mary agreed, and admitted that she had tried very hard
to dream it on the third night, but somehow could not do it.</p>

<p>"When my brother comes home from America," said Mrs. Makebelieve,
"we'll go away from this part of the city at once. I suppose he'd want
a rather big house on the south side--Rathfarnham or Terenure way, or,
maybe, Donnybrook. Of course he'll ask me to mind the house for him,
and keep the servants in order, and provide a different dinner every
day, and all that; while you could go out to the neighbours' places to
play lawn-tennis or cricket, and have lunch. It will be a very great
responsibility."</p>

<p>"What kind of dinners would you have?" said Mary.</p>

<p>Mrs. Makebelieve's eyes glistened, and she leaned forward in the
bed; but just as she was about to reply the labouring man in the next
room slammed his door, and went thundering down the stairs. In an
instant Mrs. Makebelieve bounded from her bed; three wide twists put up
her hair; eight strange, billow-like movements put on her clothes; as
each article of clothing reached a definite point on her person Mary
stabbed it swiftly with a pin--four ordinary pins in this place, two
safety-pins in that: then Mrs. Makebelieve kissed her daughter sixteen
times, and fled down the stairs and away to her work.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Mrs. Cafferty came into the room. She was, as every
woman is in the morning, primed with conversation about husbands; for
in the morning husbands are unwieldy, morose creatures without joy,
without lightness, lacking even the common, elemental interest in their
own children, and capable of detestably misinterpreting the
conversation of their wives. It is only by mixing amongst other men
that this malignant humour may be dispelled. To them the company of men
is like a great bath into which a husband will plunge wildly,
renouncing as he dives wife and children, all anchors and securities of
hearth and roof, and from which he again emerges singularly refreshed
and capable of being interested by a wife, a family, and a home until
the next morning. To many women this is a grievance amounting often to
an affront, and although they endeavour, even by cooking, to heal the
singular breach, they are utterly unable to do so, and perpetually seek
the counsel of each other on the subject. Mrs. Cafferty had merely
asked her husband would he hold the baby while she poured out his
stirabout, and he had incredibly threatened to pour the stirabout down
the back of her neck if she didn't leave him alone.</p>

<p>It was upon this morning madness she had desired to consult her
friend, and when she saw that Mrs. Makebelieve had gone away her
disappointment was quite evident. But this was only for a moment.
Almost all women are possessed of a fine social sense in relation to
other women. They are always on their best behaviour towards one
another. Indeed, it often seems as if they feared and must by all
possible means placate each other by flattery, humour, or a serious
tactfulness. There is very little freedom between them, because there
is no real freedom or acquaintance but between things polar. There is
nothing but a superficial resemblance between like and like, but
between like and unlike there is space wherein both curiosity and
spirit may go adventuring. Extremes must meet, it is their urgent
necessity, the reason for their distance, and the greater the distance
between them the swifter will be their return and the warmer their
impact: they may shatter each other to fragments, or they may fuse and
become indissoluble and new and wonderful, but there is no other
fertility. Between the sexes there is a really extraordinary freedom of
intercourse. They meet each other something more than half-way. A man
and a woman may become quite intimate in a quarter of an hour. Almost
certainly they will endeavour to explain themselves to each other
before many minutes have elapsed; but a man and a man will not do this,
and even less so will a woman and a woman, for these are the parallel
lines which never meet. The acquaintanceship of the latter, in
particular, often begins and ends in an armed and calculating
neutrality. They preserve their distances and each other's sufferance
by the exercise of a grave social tact which never deserts them, and
which more than anything else has contributed to build the ceremonials
which are nearly one-half of our civilisation.</p>

<p>It is a common belief amongst men that women cannot live together
without quarrelling, and that they are unable to get work done by other
women with any of the good will which men display in the same
occupations. If this is true, the reason should not be looked for in
any intersexual complications, such as fear or an acrid rivalry, but
only in the perpetually recurring physical disturbances to which, as a
sex, they are subjected; and as the ability and willingness of a man to
use his fists in response to an affront has imposed sobriety and good
humour towards each other in almost all their relations, so women have
placed barriers of politeness and ceremonial between their fellow-women
and their own excoriated sensibilities.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cafferty, therefore, dissembled her disappointment, and with an
increased cordiality addressed herself towards Mary. Sitting down on
the bedside, she discoursed on almost every subject upon which a woman
may discourse. It is considered that the conversation of women, while
incessant in its use, is rigorously bounded between the parlour and the
kitchen, or, to be more precise, between the attic and the scullery;
but these extremes are more inclusive than is imagined, for the attic
has an outlook on the stars while the scullery usually opens on the
kitchen garden or the dust-heap--vistas equal to horizons. The
mysteries of death and birth occupy women far more than is the case
with men, to whom political and mercantile speculations are more
congenial. With immediate buying and selling, and all the absolute
forms of exchange and barter, women are deeply engaged, so that the
realities of trade are often more intelligible to them than to many
merchants. If men understood domestic economy half as well as women do,
then their political economy and their entire consequent statecraft
would not be the futile muddle which it is.</p>

<p>It was all very interesting to Mary, and, moreover, she had a great
desire for companionship at the moment. If she had been left alone it
might have become necessary to confront certain thoughts, memories,
pictures, from which she had a dim idea it would be wise to keep her
distance. Her work on the previous day, the girl she had met in the
house, the policeman--from all or any of these recollections she
swerved mentally. She steadily rejected all impressions that touched
upon these. The policeman floated vaguely on her consciousness not as a
desirable person, not even as a person, but as a distance, as an hour
of her childhood, as a half-forgotten quaintness, a memory which it
would be better should never be revived. Indeed, her faint thought
shadowed him as a person who was dead, and would never again be visible
to her anywhere. So, resolutely, she let him drop down into her mind to
some uncomfortable oubliette from whence he threatened with feeble
insistence to pop up at any moment like a strange question or a sudden
shame. She hid him in a rosy flush which a breath could have made flame
unbearably, and she hid from him behind the light garrulity of Mrs.
Cafferty, through which now and again, as through a veil, she saw the
spike of his helmet, a wiry, bristling moustache, a surge of great
shoulders. On these ghostly indications she heaped a tornado of words
which swamped the wraith, but she knew he was waiting to catch her
alone, and would certainly catch her, and the knowledge made her hate
him.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>XXII</h2>

<p>Mrs. Cafferty suggested that she and Mary should go out together to
purchase that day's dinner, and by the time she had draped her
shoulders in a shawl, buried her head in a bonnet, cautioned all her
brood against going near the fireplace, the coal-box, and the
slop-bucket, cut a slice of bread for each of them, and placed each of
them in charge of all the rest, Mary's more elaborate dressing was
within two stages of her hat.</p>

<p>"Wait until you have children, my dear," said Mrs. Cafferty, "you
won't be so pernickety then." She further told Mary that when she was
herself younger she had often spent an hour and a half doing up her
hair, and she had been so particular that the putting on of a blouse or
the pinning of a skirt to a belt had tormented her happily for two
hours. "But, bless you," she roared, "you get out of all that when you
get children. Wait till you have six of them to be dressed every
morning, and they with some of their boots lost and the rest of them
mixed up, and each of them wriggling like an eel on a pan until you
have to slap the devil out of them before their stocking can be got on:
the way they screw their toes up in the wrong places and the way they
squeal that you're pinching them! and the way that they say you've
rubbed soap in their eyes!"--Mrs. Cafferty lifted her eyes and her
hands to the ceiling in a dumb remonstrance with Providence, and
dropped them again forlornly as one in whom Providence had never been
really interested "you'll have all the dressing you want, and a bit
over for luck," said she.</p>

<p>She complimented Mary on her hair, her complexion, the smallness of
her feet, the largeness of her eyes, the slenderness of her waist, the
width of her hat and of her shoestrings: so impartially and inclusively
did she compliment her that by the time they went out Mary was rosy
with appreciation and as self-confident as a young girl is entitled to
be.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful grey day, with a massy sky which seemed as if it
never could move again or change, and, as often happens in Ireland in
cloudy weather, the air was so very clear that one could see to a great
distance. On such days everything stands out in sharp outline. A street
is no longer a congeries of houses huddling shamefully together and
terrified lest any one should look at them and laugh. Each house then
recaptures its individuality. The very roadways are aware of
themselves, and bear their horses and cars and trams in a competent
spirit, adorned with modesty as with a garland. It has a beauty beyond
sunshine, for sunshine is only youth and carelessness. The impress of a
thousand memories, the historic visage, becomes apparent; the quiet
face which experience has ripened into knowledge and mellowed into the
wisdom of charity is seen then; the great social beauty shines from the
streets under this sky that broods like a thoughtful forehead.</p>

<p>While they walked Mrs. Cafferty planned, as a general might, her
campaign of shopping. Her shopping differed greatly from Mrs.
Makebelieve's, and the difference was probably caused by her necessity
to feed and clothe eight people as against Mrs. Makebelieve's two. Mrs.
Makebelieve went to the shop nearest her house, and there entered into
a staunch personal friendship with the proprietor. When she was given
anything of doubtful value or material she instantly returned and
handed it back, and the prices which were first quoted to her and
settled upon became to Mrs. Makebelieve an unalterable standard from
which no departure would be tolerated. Eggs might go up in price for
the remainder of the world, but not for her. A change of price threw
Mrs. Makebelieve into so wide-eyed, so galvanic, so powerfully-verbal
and friendship-shattering an anger that her terms were accepted and
registered as Median exactitudes. Mrs. Cafferty, on the other hand,
knew shopkeepers as personal enemies and as foes to the human race, who
were bent on despoiling the poor, and against whom a remorseless
warfare should be conducted by all decent people. Her knowledge of
material, of quality, of degrees of freshness, of local and distant
prices was profound. In Clanbrassil Street she would quote the prices
of Moore Street with shattering effect, and if the shopkeeper declined
to revise his tariff her good-humoured voice toned so huge a
disapproval that other intending purchasers left the shop impressed by
the unmasking of a swindler. Her method was abrupt. She seized an
article, placed it on the counter, and uttered these words, "Sixpence
and not a penny more; I can get it in Moore Street for fivepence
halfpenny." She knew all the shops having a cheap line in some special
article, and, therefore, her shopping was of a very extended
description; not that she went from point to point, for she continually
departed from the line of battle with the remark, "Let's try what they
have here," and when inside the shop her large eye took in at a glance
a thousand details of stock and price which were never afterwards
forgotten.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cafferty's daughter, Nora, was going to celebrate her first
Communion in a few days. This is a very important ceremony for a young
girl and for her mother. A white muslin dress and a blue sash, a white
muslin hat with blue ribbons, tan shoes, and stockings as germane to
the colour of tan as may be--these all have to be provided. It is a
time of grave concern for everybody intimately connected with the
event. Every girl in the world has performed this ceremony: they have
all been clad in these garments and shoes, and for a day or so all
women, of whatever age, are in love with the little girl making her
first Communion. Perhaps more than anything else it swings the passing
stranger back to the time when she was not a woman but a child with
present gaiety and curiosity, and a future all expectation and
adventure. Therefore, the suitable apparelling of one's daughter is a
public duty, and every mother endeavours to do the thing that is right,
and live, if only for one day, up to the admiration of her
fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>It was a trial, but an enjoyable one, to Mrs. Cafferty and Mary this
matching of tan stockings with tan shoes. The shoes were bought, and
then an almost impossible quest began to find stockings which would
exactly go with them. Thousands of boxes were opened, ransacked, and
waved aside without the absolute colour being discovered. From shop to
shop and from street to street they went, and the quest led them
through Grafton Street <i>en route</i> to a shop where, months before,
Mrs. Cafferty had seen stockings of a colour so nearly approximating to
tan that they almost might be suitable.</p>

<p>As they went past the College and entered the winding street Mary's
heart began to beat. She did not see any of the traffic flowing up and
down, or the jostling, busy foot-passengers, nor did she hear the eager
lectures of her companion. Her eyes were straining up the street
towards the crossing. She dared not turn back or give any explanation
to Mrs. Cafferty, and in a few seconds she saw him, gigantic, calm, the
adequate monarch of his world. His back was turned to her, and the
great sweep of his shoulders, his solid legs, his red neck, and
close-cropped, wiry hair were visible to her strangely. She had a
peculiar feeling of acquaintness and of aloofness, intimate knowledge
and a separation of sharp finality, caused her to stare at him with so
intent a curiosity that Mrs. Cafferty noticed it.</p>

<p>"That's a fine man," said she; "he won't have to go about looking
for girls."</p>

<p>As she spoke they passed by the policeman, and Mary knew that when
her eyes left him his gaze almost automatically fell upon her. She was
glad that he could not see her face. She was glad that Mrs. Cafferty
was beside her: had she been alone she would have been tempted to walk
away very quickly, almost to run, but her companion gave her courage
and self-possession, so that she walked gallantly. But her mind was a
fever. She could feel his eyes raking her from head to foot; she could
see his great hand going up to tap his crinkly moustache. These things
she could see in her terrified mind, but she could not think, she could
only give thanks to God because she had her best clothes on.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>XXIII</h2>

<p>Mrs. Makebelieve was planning to get back such of her furniture and
effects as had been pawned during her illness. Some of these things she
had carried away from her father's house many years before when she got
married. They had been amongst the earliest objects on which her eyes
had rested when she was born, and around them her whole life of
memories revolved: a chair in which her father had sat, and on the edge
whereof her husband had timidly balanced himself when he came courting
her, and into which her daughter had been tied when she was a baby. A
strip, of carpet and some knives and forks had formed portion of her
wedding presents. She loved these things, and had determined that if
work could retrieve them they should not be lost for ever. Therefore,
she had to suffer people like Mrs. O'Connor, not gladly, but with the
resignation due to the hests of Providence which one must obey but may
legitimately criticise. Mrs. Makebelieve said definitely that she
detested the woman. She was a cold-eyed person whose only ability was
to order about other people who were much better than she was. It
distressed Mrs. Makebelieve to have to work for such a person, to be
subject to her commands and liable to her reproofs or advice; these
were things which seemed to her to be out of all due proportion. She
did not wish the woman any harm, but some day or other she would
undoubtedly have to put her in her proper place. It was a day to which
she looked forward. Any one who had a sufficient income could have a
house and could employ and pay for outside help without any particular
reason for being proud, and many people, having such an income, would
certainly have a better appointed house and would be more generous and
civil to those who came to work for them. Everybody, of course, could
not have a policeman for a nephew, and there were a great many people
who would rather not have anything to do with a policeman at all.
Overbearing, rough creatures to whom everybody is a thief! If Mrs.
Makebelieve had such a nephew she would certainly have wrecked his
pride--the great beast! Here Mrs. Makebelieve grew very angry: her
black eyes blazed, her great nose grew thin and white, and her hands
went leaping in fury. "'You're not in Court now, you jackanapes you,'
said I--with his whiskers, and his baton, and his feet that were bigger
than anything in the world except his ignorant self-conceit. 'Have you
a daughter, ma'm?' said he. 'What's her age, ma'm?' said he. 'Is she a
good girl, ma'm?' said he." But she had settled him. "And that woman
was prouder of him than a king would be of his crown! Never mind," said
Mrs. Make-believe, and she darted fiercely up and down the room,
tearing pieces off the atmosphere and throwing them behind her.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, however, she sat down on the floor and drew her
daughter's head to her breast, and then, staring into the scrap of
fire, she counselled Mary wisely on many affairs of life and the
conduct of a girl under all kinds of circumstances--to be adequate in
spirit if not in physique: that was her theme. Never be a servant in
your heart, said she. To work is nothing; the king on his throne, the
priest kneeling before the Holy Altar, all people in all places had to
work, but no person at all need be a servant. One worked and was paid,
and went away keeping the integrity of one's soul unspotted and serene.
If an employer was wise or good or kind, Mrs. Makebelieve was prepared
to accord such a person instant and humble reverence. She would work
for such a one until the nails dropped off her fingers and her feet
crumpled up under her body; but a policeman, or a rich person, or a
person who ordered one about ... until she died and was buried in the
depths of the world, she would never give in to such a person or admit
anything but their thievishness and ill-breeding. Bad manners to the
like of them! said she, and might have sailed boisterously away upon an
ocean of curses, but that Mary turned her face closer to her breast and
began to speak.</p>

<p>For suddenly there had come to Mary a vision of peace: like a green
island in the sea it was, like a white cloud on a broiling day; the
sheltered life where all mundane preoccupations were far away, where
ambition and hope and struggle were incredibly distant foolishness.
Lowly and peaceful and unjaded was that life: she could see the nuns
pacing quietly in their enclosed gardens, fingering their beads as they
went to and fro and praying noiselessly for the sins of the world, or
walking with solemn happiness to the Chapel to praise God in their own
small companies, or going with hidden feet through the great City to
nurse the sick and comfort those who had no other comforter than
God--To pray in a quiet place, and not to be afraid any more or
doubtful or despised...! These things she saw and her heart leaped to
them, and of these things she spoke to her mother, who listened with a
tender smile and stroked her hair and hands. But her mother did not
approve of these things. She spoke of nuns with reverence and
affection. Many a gentle, sweet woman had she known of that sisterhood,
many a one before whom she could have abased herself with tears and
love, but such a life of shelter and restraint could never have been
hers, nor did she believe it could be Mary's. For her a woman's
business was life; the turmoil and strife of it was good to be in; it
was a cleansing and a bracing. God did not need any assistance, but man
did, bitterly he wanted it, and the giving of such assistance was the
proper business of a woman. Everywhere there was a man to be helped,
and the quest of a woman was to find the man who most needed her aid,
and having found, to cleave to him for ever. In most of the trouble of
life she divined men and women not knowing or not doing their duty,
which was to love one another and to be neighbourly and obliging to
their fellows. A partner, a home and children--through the loyal
co-operation of these she saw happiness and, dimly, a design of so vast
an architecture as scarcely to be discussed. The bad and good of
humanity moved her to an equal ecstasy of displeasure and approbation,
but her God was Freedom and her religion Love. Freedom! even the last
rags of it that remain to a regimented world! That was a passion with
her. She must order her personal life without any ghostly or bodily
supervision. She would oppose an encroachment on that with her nails
and her teeth; and this last fringe of freedom was what nuns had
sacrificed and all servants and other people had bartered away. One
must work, but one must never be a slave--these laws seemed to her
equally imperative; the structure of the world swung upon them, and
whoever violated these laws was a traitor to both God and man.</p>

<p>But Mary did not say anything. Her mother's arms were around her,
and suddenly she commenced to cry upon a bosom that was not strange.
There was surely healing in that breast of love, a rampart of
tenderness against the world, a door which would never be closed
against her or opened to her enemies.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>XXIV</h2>

<p>In a little city like Dublin one meets every person whom one knows
within a few days. Around each bend in the road there is a friend, an
enemy, or a bore striding towards you, so that, with a piety which is
almost religious, one says "touch wood" before turning any corner. It
was not long, therefore, until Mary again met the big policeman. He
came up behind her and walked by her side, chatting with a pleasant
ease, in which, however, her curious mind could discover some obscure
distinctions. On looking backwards it seemed to Mary that he had always
come from behind her, and the retrospect dulled his glory to the
diminishing point. For indeed his approach was too consistently
policeman-like, it was too crafty; his advent hinted at a gross
espionage, at a mind which was no longer a man's but a detective's, who
tracked everybody by instinct, and arrested his friends instead of
saluting them.</p>

<p>As they walked along Mary was in a fever of discomfort. She wished
dumbly that the man would go away, but for the wealth of the world she
could not have brought herself to hurt the feelings of so big a man. To
endanger the very natural dignity of a big man was a thing which no
woman could do without a pang; the shame of it made her feel hot: he
might have blushed or stammered, and the memory of that would sting her
miserably for weeks as though she had insulted an elephant or a
baby.</p>

<p>She could not get away from him. She had neither the courage nor the
experience which enables a woman to dismiss a man without wounding him,
and so, perforce, she continued walking by his side while he treated
her to an intelligent dissertation on current political events and the
topography of the City of Dublin.</p>

<p>But, undoubtedly, there was a change in the policeman, and it was
not difficult to account for. He was more easy and familiar in his
speech: while formerly he had bowed as from the peaks of manly
intellect to the pleasant valleys of girlish incompetence, he now
condescended from the loftiness of a policeman and a person of quality
to the quaint gutters of social inferiority. To many people mental
inferiority in a companion has a charm, for it induces in one's proper
person a feeling of philosophic detachment, a fine effect of personal
individuality and superiority which is both bracing and
uplifting--there is not any particular harm in this: progress can be,
and is, accelerated by the hypocrisies and snobbishness, all the minor,
unpleasant adjuncts of mediocrity. Snobbishness is a puling infant, but
it may grow to a deeply whiskered ambition, and most virtues are, on
examination, the amalgam of many vices. But while intellectual poverty
may be forgiven and loved, social inequality can only be utilised. Our
fellows, however addled, are our friends, our inferiors are our prey,
and since the policeman had discovered Mary publicly washing out an
alien hall his respect for her had withered and dropped to death almost
in an instant; whence it appears that there is really only one grave
and debasing vice in the world, and that is poverty.</p>

<p>In many little ways the distinction and the difference were apparent
to Mary. The dignity of a gentleman and a man of the world was partly
shorn away: the gentleman portion, which comprised kindness and
reticence, had vanished; the man of the world remained, typified by a
familiarity which assumed that this and that, understood but not to be
mentioned, shall be taken for granted; a spurious equalisation perched
jauntily but insecurely on a non-committal, and that base flattery
which is the only coin wherewith a thief can balance his depredations.
For as they went pacing down a lonely road towards the Dodder the
policeman diversified his entertaining lore by a succession of
compliments which ravaged the heavens and the earth and the deep sea
for a fitting symbology. Mary's eyes and the gay heavens were placed in
juxtaposition and the heavens were censured, the vegetable, animal, and
mineral worlds were discomfited, the deep sea sustained a reproof, and
the by-products of nature and of art drooped into a nothingness too
vast even for laughter. Mary had not the slightest objection to hearing
that all the other women in the world seemed cripples and gargoyles
when viewed against her own transcendent splendour, and she was
prepared to love the person who said this innocently and happily. She
would have agreed to be an angel or a queen to a man demanding
potentates and powers in his sweetheart, and would joyfully have
equalised matters by discovering the buried god in her lover and
believing in it as sincerely as he permitted--But this man was not
saying the truth. She could see him making the things up as he talked.
There was eagerness in him, but no spontaneity. It was not even
eagerness, it was greediness: he wanted to eat her up and go away with
her bones sticking out of his mouth as the horns of a deer protrude
from the jaws of an anaconda, veritable evidence to it and his fellows
of a victory and an orgy to command respect and envy. But he was
familiar, he was complacent, and--amazedly she discovered it--he was
big. Her vocabulary could not furnish her with the qualifying word, or
rather epithet, for his bigness. Horrible was suggested and retained,
but her instinct clamoured that there was a fat, oozy word somewhere
which would have brought comfort to her brains and her hands and feet.
He did not keep his arms quiet, but tapped his remarks into her blouse
and her shoulder. Each time his hands touched her they remained a
trifle longer. They seemed to be great red spiders, they would grip her
all round and squeeze her clammily while his face spiked her to death
with its moustache...And he smiled also, he giggled and cut capers; his
language now was a perpetual witticism at which he laughed in jerks,
and at which she laughed tightly like an obedient, quick echo: and
then, suddenly, without a word, in a dazing flash, his arms were about
her. There was nobody in sight at all, and he was holding her like a
great spider, and his bristly moustache darted forward to spike her to
death, and then, somehow, she was free, away from him, scudding down
the road lightly and fearfully and very swiftly. "Wait, wait," he
called--"wait!" But she did not wait.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>XXV</h2>

<p>Mrs. Cafferty came in that evening for a chat with Mrs. Makebelieve.
There were traces of worry on the lady's face, and she hushed the
children who trooped in her wake with less of good humour than they
were accustomed to. Instead of threatening to smack them on the head,
as was usual, she did smack them, and she walked surrounded by
lamentations as by a sea.</p>

<p>Things were not going at all well with her. There was a slackness in
her husband's trade; so that for days together he was idle, and
although the big woman amended her expenditure in every direction she
could not by any means adjust eight robust appetites to a shrunken
income. She explained her position to Mrs. Makebelieve:--Children would
not, they could not, consent to go on shorter rations than they had
been accustomed to, and it seemed to her that daily, almost hourly,
their appetites grew larger and more terrible. She showed her right
hand whereon the mere usage of a bread-knife had scored a ridge which
was now a permanent disfigurement.</p>

<p>"God bless me," she shouted angrily, "what right have I to ask the
creatures to go hungry? Am I to beat them when they cry? It's not their
fault that they want food, and it's not my poor man's fault that they
haven't any. He's ready to work at his trade if anybody wants him to do
so, and if he can't get work, and if the children are hungry, whose
fault is it?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Cafferty held that there was something wrong somewhere, but
whether the blame was to be allocated to the weather, the employer, the
Government, or the Deity, she did not know, nor did Mrs. Makebelieve
know; but they were agreed that there was an error somewhere, a lack of
adjustment with which they had nothing to do, but the effects whereof
were grievously visible in their privations. Meantime it had become
necessary that Mrs. Cafferty should adjust herself to a changing
environment. A rise or fall in wages is automatically followed by a
similar enlargement or shrinkage of one's necessities, and the
consequent difference is registered at all points of one's
life-contact. The physical and mental activities of a well-to-do person
can reach out to a horizon, while those of very poor people are limited
to their immediate, stagnant atmosphere, and so the lives of a vast
portion of society are liable to a ceaseless change, a flux swinging
from good to bad for ever, an expansion and constriction against which
they have no safeguards and not even any warning. In free nature this
problem is paralleled by the shrinking and expansion of the seasons;
the summer with its wealth of food, the winter following after with its
famine; but many wild creatures are able to make a thrifty provision
against the bad time which they know comes as certainly and
periodically as the good time. Bees and squirrels and many others fill
their barns with the plentiful overplus of the summer fields; birds can
migrate and find sunshine and sustenance elsewhere; and others again
can store during their good season a life energy by means whereof they
may sleep healthily through their hard times. These organisations can
be adjusted to their environments because the changes of the latter are
known and can be more or less accurately predicted from any point. But
the human worker has no such regularity. His food period does not ebb
and recur with the seasons. There is no periodicity in their changes,
and, therefore, no possibility for defensive or protective action. His
physical structure uses and excretes energy so rapidly that he cannot
store it up and go to sleep on his savings, and his harvests are
usually so lean and disconnected that the exercise of thrift is equally
an impossibility and a mockery. The life, therefore, of such a person
is composed of a constant series of adjustments and readjustments, and
the stern ability wherewith these changes are met and combated are more
admirably ingenious than the much-praised virtues of ants and bees to
which they are constantly directed as to exemplars.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cafferty had now less money than she had been used to, but she
had still the same rent to pay, the same number of children to feed,
and the same personal dignity to support as in her better days, and her
problem was to make up, by some means to which she was a stranger, the
money which had drifted beyond the reach of her husband. The methods by
which she could do this were very much restricted. Children require an
attention which occupies the entire of a mother's time, and,
consequently, she was prevented from seeking abroad any mitigation of
her hardships. The occupations which might be engaged in at home were
closed to her by mere overwhelming competition. The number of women who
are prepared to make ten million shirts for a penny is already far in
excess of the demand, and so, except by a severe undercutting such as a
contract to make twenty million shirts for a halfpenny, work of this
description is very difficult to obtain.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances nothing remained for Mrs. Cafferty but to
take in a lodger. This is a form of co-operation much practised among
the poorer people. The margin of direct profit accruing from such a
venture is very small, but this is compensated for by the extra
spending power achieved. A number of people pooling their money in this
way can buy to greater advantage and in a cheaper market than is
possible to the solitary purchaser, and a moderate toll for wear and
tear and usage, or, as it is usually put, for rent and attendance,
gives the small personal profit at which such services are
reckoned.</p>

<p>Through the good offices of a neighbouring shopkeeper Mrs. Cafferty
had secured a lodger, and, with the courage which is never separate
from despair, she had rented a small room beside her own. This room, by
an amazing economy of construction, contained a fireplace and a window:
it was about one square inch in diameter, and was undoubtedly a fine
room. The lodger was to enter into possession on the following day, and
Mrs. Cafferty said he was a very nice young man indeed and did not
drink.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>XXVI</h2>

<p>Mrs. Cafferty's lodger duly arrived. He was young and as thin as a
lath, and he moved with fury. He was seldom in the place at all: he
fled into the house for his food, and having eaten it, he fled away
from the house again, and did not reappear until it was time to go to
bed. What he did with himself in the interval Mrs. Cafferty did not
know, but she was prepared to wager her soul, the value of which she
believed was high, on the fact that he was a good young man who never
gave the slightest trouble, saving that his bedclothes were always
lying on the floor in the morning, that there was candle grease on one
corner of his pillow, and that he cleaned his boots on a chair. But
these were things which one expected a young man to do, and the
omission of them might have caused one to look curiously at the
creature and to doubt his masculinity.</p>

<p>Mrs. Makebelieve replied that habits of order and neatness were
rarely to be found in young people of either sex; more especially were
these absent in boys who are released in early youth by their mothers
from all purely domestic employments. A great many people believed, and
she believed herself, that it was not desirable a man or boy should
conform too rigidly to household rules. She had observed that the
comfort of a home was lost to many men if they were expected to take
their boots off when they came into the house, or to hang their hats up
in a special place. The women of a household, being so constantly
indoors, find it easy and businesslike to obey the small rules which
comprise household legislation, but as the entire policy of a house was
to make it habitable and comfortable for its men folk, all domestic
ordinances might be strained to the uttermost until the compromise was
found to mollify even exceptional idiosyncrasies. A man, she held,
bowed to quite sufficient discipline during his working hours, and his
home should be a place free from every vexatious restraint and wherein
he might enjoy as wide a liberty as was good for him.</p>

<p>These ideas were applauded by Mrs. Cafferty, and she supplemented
them by a recital of how she managed her own husband, and of the
ridiculous ease whereby any man may be governed; for she had observed
that men were very susceptible to control if only the control was not
too apparent. If a man did a thing twice, the doing of that thing
became a habit and a passion, any interference with which provoked him
to an unreasoning, bull-like wrath wherein both wives and crockery were
equally shattered; and, therefore, a woman had only to observe the
personal habits of her beloved and fashion her restrictions according
to that standard. This meant that men made the laws and women
administered them--a wise allocation of prerogatives, for she conceived
that the executive female function was every whit as important as the
creative faculty which brought these laws into being. She was quite
prepared to leave the creative powers in male hands if they would
equally abstain from interference with the subsequent working details,
for she was of opinion that in the pursuit of comfort (not entirely to
their credit was it said) men were far more anxiously concerned than
were women, and they flew to their bourne with an instinct for short
cuts wherewith women were totally unacquainted.</p>

<p>But in the young man who had come to lodge with her Mrs. Cafferty
discerned a being in whom virtue had concentrated to a degree that
almost amounted to a congestion. He had instantly played with the
children on their being presented to him: this was the sign of a good
nature. Before he was acquainted with her ten minutes he had made four
jokes: this was the sign of a pleasant nature; and he sang loudly and
unceasingly when he awoke in the morning, which was the unfailing index
to a happy nature. Moreover, he ate the meals provided for him without
any of that particular, tedious examination which is so insulting, and
had complimented Mrs. Cafferty on an ability to put a taste on food
which she was pleased to obtain recognition of.</p>

<p>Both Mary and her mother remarked on these details with an
admiration which was as much as either politeness or friendship could
expect. Mrs. Makebelieve's solitary method of life had removed her so
distantly from youth that information about a young man was almost
tonic to her. She had never wished for a second husband, but had often
fancied that a son would have been a wonderful joy to her. She
considered that a house which had no young man growing up in it was not
a house at all, and she believed that a boy would love his mother, if
not more than a daughter could, at least with a difference which would
be strangely sweet--a rash, impulsive, unquiet love; a love which would
continually prove her love to the breaking point; a love that demanded,
and demanded with careless assurance, that accepted her goodness as
unquestioningly as she accepted the fertility of the earth, and used
her knowing blindly and flatteringly how inexhaustively rich her depths
were...She could have wept for this; it was priceless beyond kingdoms;
the smile on a boy's face lifted her to an exaltation. Her girl was
inexpressibly sweet, surely an island in her wide heart, but a little
boy...her breasts could have filled with milk for him, him she could
have nourished in the rocks and in desert places: he would have been
life to her and adventure, a barrier against old age, an incantation
against sorrow, a fragrance and a grief and a defiance...</p>

<p>It was quite plain that Mrs. Cafferty was satisfied with this
addition to her household, but the profit which she had expected to
accrue from his presence was not the liberal one she had in mind when
making the preliminary arrangements. For it appeared that the young man
had an appetite of which Mrs. Cafferty spoke with the respect proper to
something colossal and awesome. A half-loaf did not more than break the
back of a hunger which could wriggle disastrously over another
half-loaf: so that, instead of being relieved by his advent, she was
confronted by a more immediate and desolating bankruptcy than that from
which she had attempted to escape. Exactly how to deal with this
situation she did not know, and it was really in order to discuss her
peculiar case that she had visited Mrs. Makebelieve. She could, of
course, have approached the young man and demanded from him an increase
of money that would still be equitable to both parties, but she
confessed a repugnance to this course. She did not like to upbraid or
trouble any one on account of an appetite which was so noteworthy. She
disliked, in any event, to raise a question about food: her instinct
for hospitality was outraged at the thought, and as she was herself the
victim, or the owner, of an appetite which had often placed a strain on
her revenues, a fellow-feeling operated still further in mitigation of
his disqualification.</p>

<p>Mrs. Makebelieve's advice was that she should stifle the first
fierce and indiscriminate cravings of the young man's hunger by a
liberal allowance of stirabout, which was a cheap, wholesome, and very
satisfying food, and in that way his destruction of more costly
victuals would be kept within reasonable limits. Appetite, she held,
was largely a matter of youth, and as a boy who was scarcely done
growing had no way of modifying his passion for nourishment, it would
be a lapse from decency to insult him on so legitimate a failing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cafferty thought that this might be done, and thanked her
friend for the counsel; but Mary, listening to these political matters,
conceived Mrs. Cafferty as a person who had no longer any claim to
honour, and she pitied the young man whose appetite was thus publicly
canvassed, and who might at any moment be turned out of house and home
on account of a hunger against which he had no safeguard and no
remedy.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>XXVII</h2>

<p>It was not long until Mary and Mrs. Cafferty's lodger met. As he
came in by the hall-door one day Mary was carrying upstairs a large
water-bucket, the portage of which two or three times a day is so heavy
a strain on the dweller in tenements. The youth instantly seized the
bucket, and despite her protestations and appeals, he carried it
upstairs. He walked a few steps in advance of Mary, whistling
cheerfully as he went, so she was able to get a good view of him. He
was so thin that he nearly made her laugh, but he carried the bucket,
the weight of which she had often bowed under, with an ease astonishing
in so slight a man, and there was a spring in his walk which was
pleasant to see. He laid the bucket down outside her room, and
requested her urgently to knock at his door whenever she required more
water fetched, because he would be only too delighted to do it for her,
and it was not the slightest trouble in the world. While he spoke he
was stealing glances at her face and Mary was stealing glances at his
face, and when they caught one another doing this at the same moment
they both looked hurriedly away, and the young man departed to his own
place.</p>

<p>But Mary was very angry with this young man. She had gone downstairs
in her house attire, which was not resplendent, and she objected to
being discovered by any youth in raiment not suitable to such an
occasion. She could not visualise herself speaking to a man unless she
was adorned as for a festivity. The gentlemen and ladies of whom her
mother sometimes spoke, and of whom she had often dreamt, were never
mean in their habiliments. The gentlemen frequently had green silken
jackets with a foam of lace at the wrists and a cascade of the same
rich material brawling upon their breasts, and the ladies were attired
in a magnificent scarcity of clothing, the fundamental principle
whereof, although she was quite assured of its righteousness, she did
not yet understand.</p>

<p>Indeed, at this period Mary's interest in dress far transcended any
interest she had ever known before. She knew intimately the window
contents of every costumier's shop in Grafton and Wicklow and Dawson
Streets, and could follow with intelligent amazement the apparently
trifling, but exceedingly important, differences of line or seam or
flounce which ranked one garment as a creation and its neighbour as a
dress. She and her mother often discussed the gowns wherein the native
dignity of their souls might be adequately caparisoned. Mrs.
Makebelieve, with a humility which had still a trace of anger, admitted
that the period when she could have been expressed in colour had
expired, and she decided that a black silk dress, with a heavy gold
chain falling along the bosom, was as much as her soul was now entitled
to. She had an impatience, amounting to contempt, for those florid,
flamboyant souls whose outer physical integument so grievously
misrepresented them. She thought that after a certain time one should
dress the body and not the soul, and, discovering an inseparability
between the two, she held that the mean shrine must hold a very
trifling deity and that an ill-made or time-worn body should never
dress gloriously under pain of an accusation of hypocrisy or
foolishness.</p>

<p>But for Mary she planned garments with a freedom and bravery which
astonished while it delighted her daughter. She combined twenty styles
into one style of terrifying originality. She conceived dresses of a
complexity beyond the labour of any but a divinely inspired needle, and
others again whose simplicity was almost too tenuous for human speech.
She discussed robes whose trailing and voluminous richness could with
difficulty be supported by ten strong attendants, and she had heard of
a dress the fabric whereof was of such gossamer and ethereal
insubstancy that it might be packed into a walnut more conveniently
than an ordinary dress could be impressed into a portmanteau. Mary's
exclamations of delight and longing ranged from every possible dress to
every impossible one, and then Mrs. Makebelieve reviewed all the
dresses she had worn from the age of three years to the present day,
including wedding and mourning dresses, those which were worn at
picnics and dances and for travelling, with an occasional divergence
which comprehended the clothing of her friends and her enemies during
the like period. She explained the basic principles of dress to her
daughter, showing that in this art, as in all else, order cannot be
dispensed with. There were things a tall person might wear, but which a
short person might not, and the draperies which adorned a portly lady
were but pitiable weeds when trailed by her attenuated sister. The
effect of long, thin lines in a fabric will make a short woman appear
tall, while round, thick lines can reduce the altitude of people whose
height is a trouble to be combated. She illustrated the usage of large
and small checks and plaids and all the mazy interweaving of other
cloths, and she elucidated the mystery of colour, tone, half-tone,
light and shade so interestingly that Mary could scarcely hear enough
of her lore. She was acquainted with the colours which a dark person
may wear and those which are suitable to a fair person, and the shades
proper to be used by the wide class ranging between these extremes she
knew also, with a special provision for red-haired and sandy folk and
those who have no complexion at all. Certain laws which she formulated
were cherished by her daughter as oracular utterances--that one should
match one's eyes in the house and one's hair in the street, was one;
that one's hat and gloves and shoes were of vastly more importance than
all the rest of one's clothing, was another; that one's hair and
stockings should tone as nearly as possible, was a third. Following
these rules, she assured her daughter, a woman could never be other
than well dressed, and all of these things Mary learned by heart and
asked her mother to tell her more, which her mother was quite able and
willing to do.</p>

<p>When the sexual instinct is aroused, men and dogs and frogs and
beetles, and such other creatures as are inside or outside of this
catalogue, are very tenacious in the pursuit of their ambition. We can
seldom get away from that which attracts or repels us. Love and hate
are equally magnetic and compelling, and each, being supernormal, drags
us willingly or woefully in its wake, until at last our blind
persistency is either routed or appeased, and we advance our lauds or
gnash our teeth as the occasion bids us. There is no tragedy more
woeful than the victory of hate, nor any attainment so hopelessly
barren as the sterility of that achievement; for hate is finality, and
finality is the greatest evil which can happen in a world of movement.
Love is an inaugurator displaying his banners on captured peaks and
pressing for ever to a new and more gracious enterprise, but the
victories of hate are gained in a ditch from which there is no horizon
visible, and whence there does not go even one limping courier,</p>

<p>After Mary fled from the embrace of the great policeman he came to
think more closely of her than he had been used; but her image was
throned now in anger: she came to him like a dull brightness wherefrom
desolate thunder might roll at an instant. Indeed, she began to obsess
him so that not even the ministrations of his aunt nor the obeisances
of that pleasant girl, the name of whose boots was Fairybell, could
give him any comfort or wean him from a contemplation which sprawled
gloomily between him and his duties to the traffic. If he had not
discovered the lowliness of her quality his course might have been
simple and straightforward: the issue, in such an event, would have
narrowed to every man's poser--whether he should marry this girl or
that girl?--but the arithmetic whereby such matters are elucidated
would at the last have eased his perplexity, and the path indicated
could have been followed with the fullest freedom on his part and
without any disaster to his self-love. If, whichever way his
inclination wavered, there was any pang of regret (and there was bound
to be), such a feeling would be ultimately waived by his reason or
retained as a memorial which had a gratifying savour. But the knowledge
of Mary's social inferiority complicated matters, for, although this
automatically put her out of the question as his wife, her subsequent
ill-treatment of himself had injected a virus to his blood which was
one-half a passion for her body and one-half a frenzy for vengeance. He
could have let her go easily enough if she had not first let him go;
for he read dismissal in her action and resented it as a trespass on
his own just prerogative.--He had but to stretch out his hand and she
would have dropped to it as tamely as a kitten, whereas now she eluded
his hand, would, indeed, have nothing to do with it; and this could not
be forgiven. He would gladly have beaten her into submission, for what
right has a slip of a girl to withstand the advances of a man and a
policeman? That is a crooked spirit demanding to be straightened with a
truncheon: but as we cannot decently, or even peaceably, beat a girl
until she is married to us, he had to relinquish that dear idea. He
would have dismissed her from his mind with the contempt she deserved,
but, alas! he could not: she clung there like a burr, not to be
dislodged saving by possession or a beating--two shuddering
alternatives--for she had become detestably dear to him. His senses and
his self-esteem conspired to heave her to a pedestal where his eye
strained upwards in bewilderment--that she who was below him could be
above him! This was astounding: she must be pulled from her eminence
and stamped back to her native depths by his own indignant hoofs;
thence she might be gloriously lifted again with a calm, benignant,
masculine hand shedding pardons and favours, and perhaps a mollifying
unguent for her bruises. Bruises! a knee, an elbow--they were nothing;
little damages which to kiss was to make well again. Will not women
cherish a bruise that it may be medicined by male kisses? Nature and
precedent have both sworn to it...But she was out of reach; his hand,
high-flung as it might be, could not get to her. He went furiously to
the Phoenix Park, to St. Stephen's Green, to outlying leafy spots and
sheltered lanes, but she was in none of these places. He even prowled
about the neighbourhood of her home and could not meet her. Once he had
seen Mary as she came along the road, and he drew back into a doorway.
A young man was marching by her side, a young man who gabbled without
ceasing and to whom Mary chattered again with an equal volubility. As
they passed by Mary caught sight of him, and her face went flaming. She
caught her companion's arm, and they hurried down the road at a great
pace...She had never chattered to him. Always he had done the talking,
and she had been an obedient, grateful listener. Nor did he quarrel
with her silence, but her reserve shocked him; it was a
pretence--worse, a lie--a masked and hooded falsehood. She had
surrendered to him willingly, and yet drew about her a protective
armour of reserve wherein she skulked immune to the arms which were
lawfully victorious. Is there, then, no loot for a conqueror? We demand
the keys of the City Walls and unrestricted entry, or our torches shall
blaze again. This chattering Mary was a girl whom he had never caught
sight of at all. She had been hiding from him even in his presence. In
every aspect she was an anger. But she could talk to the fellow with
her...a skinny whipper-snapper, whom the breath of a man could shred
into remote, eyeless vacuity. Was this man another insult? Did she not
even wait to bury her dead? Pah! she was not value for his thought. A
girl so lightly facile might be blown from here to there and she would
scarcely notice the difference. Here and there were the same places to
her, and him and him were the same person. A girl of that type comes to
a bad end: he had seen it often, the type and the end, and never
separate. Can one not prophesy from facts? He saw a slut in a slum, a
drab hovering by a dark entry, and the vision cheered him mightily for
one glowing minute and left him unoccupied for the next, into which she
thronged with the flutter of wings and the sound of a great
mocking.</p>

<p>His aunt tracked his brows back to the responsible duties of his
employment, and commiserated with him, and made a lamentation about
matters with which he never had been occupied, so that the last tag of
his good manners departed from him, and he damned her unswervingly into
consternation. That other pleasant girl, whose sweetness he had not so
much tasted as sampled, had taken to brooding in his presence: she
sometimes drooped an eye upon him like a question...Let her look out or
maybe he'd blaze into her teeth: howl menace down her throat until she
swooned. Some one should yield to him a visible and tangible agony to
balance his. Does law probe no deeper than the pillage of a watch? Can
one filch our self-respect and escape free? Shall not our souls also
sue for damages against its aggressor? Some person rich enough must pay
for his lacerations or there was less justice in heaven than in the
Police Courts; and it might be that girl's lot to expiate the sins of
Mary. It would be a pleasure, if a sour one, to make somebody wriggle
as he had, and somebody should wriggle; of that he was blackly
determined.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>XXIX</h2>

<p>Indeed, Mrs. Cafferty's lodger and Mary had become quite intimate,
and it was not through the machinations of either that this had
happened. Ever since Mrs. Makebelieve had heard of that young man's
appetite, and the miseries through which he had to follow it, she had
been deeply concerned on his behalf. She declined to believe that the
boy ever got sufficient to eat, and she enlarged to her daughter on the
seriousness of this privation to a young man. Disabilities, such as a
young girl could not comprehend, followed in the train of insufficient
nourishment. Mrs. Cafferty was her friend, and was, moreover, a good
decent woman against whom the tongue of rumour might wag in vain; but
Mrs. Cafferty was the mother of six children, and her natural
kindliness dared not expand to their detriment. Furthermore, the fact
of her husband being out of work tended to still further circumscribe
the limits of her generosity. She divined a lean pot in the Cafferty
household, and she saw the young man getting only as much food as Mrs.
Cafferty dared to give him, so that the pangs of his hunger almost
gnawed at her own vitals. Under these circumstances she had sought for
an opportunity to become better acquainted with him, and had very
easily succeeded; so when Mary found him seated on their bed and eating
violently of their half-loaf, if she was astonished at first she was
also very glad. Her mother watched the demolition of their food with a
calm happiness, for although the amount she could contribute was small,
every little helped, and not alone were his wants assisted, but her
friend Mrs. Cafferty and her children were also aided by this dulling
of an appetite which might have endangered their household peace.</p>

<p>The young man repaid their hospitality by an easy generosity of
speech covering affairs which neither Mrs. Makebelieve nor her daughter
had many opportunities for studying. He spoke of those very interesting
matters with which a young man is concerned, and his speculations on
various subjects, while often quite ignorant, were sufficiently vivid
to be interesting and were wrong in a boyish fashion which was not
unpleasant. He was very argumentative, but was still open to reason;
therefore Mrs. Makebelieve had opportunities for discussion which were
seldom granted to her. Insensibly she adopted the position of guide,
philosopher, and friend to him; and Mary also found new interests in
speech, for although the young man thought very differently from her,
he did think upon her own plane, and the things which secretly
engrossed him were also the things wherewith she was deeply
preoccupied. A community of ignorances may be as binding as a community
of interests. We have a dull suspicion of that him or her who knows
more than we do, but the person who is prepared to go out adventuring
with us, with surmise only for a chart and enjoyment for a guide, may
use our hand as his own and our pockets as his treasury.</p>

<p>As the young man had no more shyness than a cat, it soon fell out
that he and Mary took their evening walks together. He was a clerk in a
large retail establishment, and had many things to tell Mary which were
of great interest to both of them. For in his place of business he had
both friends and enemies of whom he was able to speak with the fluency
which was their due. Mary knew, for instance, that the chief was bald
but decent (she could not believe that the connection was natural), and
that the second in command had neither virtues nor whiskers. (She saw
him as a codfish with a malignant eye.) He epitomised the vices which
belonged in detail to the world, but were peculiar to himself in bulk.
(He must be hairy in that event.) Language, even the young man's, could
not describe him adequately. (He ate boys for breakfast and girls for
tea.) With this person the young man was in eternal conflict (a bear
with little ears and big teeth); not open conflict, for that would have
meant instant dismissal (not hairy at all--a long, slimy eel with a lot
of sense), but a veiled, unremitting warfare which occupied all their
spare attention. The young man knew for an actual fact that some day he
would be compelled to hit that chap, and it would be a sorry day for
the fellow, because his ability to hit was startling. He told Mary of
the evil results which had followed some of his blows, and Mary's
incredulity was only heightened by a display of the young man's
muscles. She extolled these because she thought it was her duty to do
so, but preserved some doubts of their unique destructiveness. Once she
asked him could he fight a policeman, and he assured her that policemen
are not able to fight at all singly, but only in squads, when their
warfare is callous and ugly and conducted mainly with their boots; so
that decent people have no respect for their fighting qualities or
their private characters. He assured her that not only could he fight a
policeman, but he could also tyrannise over the seed, breed, and
generation of such a one, and, moreover, he could accomplish this
without real exertion. Against all policemen and soldiers the young man
professed an eager hostility, and with these bad people he included
landlords and many employers of labour. His denunciation of these folk
might be traced back to the belief that none of them treated one
fairly. A policeman, he averred, would arrest a man for next door to
nothing, and any resistance offered to their spleen rendered the
unfortunate prisoner liable to be man-handled in his cell until their
outraged dignity was appeased. The three capital crimes upon which a
man is liable to arrest are for being drunk, or disorderly, or for
refusing to fight, and to these perils a young man is peculiarly
susceptible, and is, to that extent, interested in the Force, and
critical of their behaviour. The sight of a soldier annoyed him, for he
saw a conqueror, trampling vaingloriously through the capital of his
country, and the inability of his land to eject the braggart astonished
and mortified him. Landlords had no bowels of compassion. There was no
kindliness of heart among them, nor any wish to assist those whose
whole existence was engaged on their behalf. He saw them as lazy,
unproductive gluttons who cried for, ever "Give, give," and who gave
nothing in return but an increased insolent tyranny. Many employers
came into the same black category. They were people who had disowned
all duty to humanity, and who saw in themselves the beginning and the
end of all things. They gratified their acquisitiveness not in order
that they might become benefactors of their kind (the only righteous
freedom of which we know), but merely to indulge a petty exercise of
power and to attain that approval which is granted to wealth and the
giving of which is the great foolishness of mankind. These people used
their helpers and threw them away; they exploited and bought and sold
their fellow-men, while their arrogant self-assurance and the monstrous
power which they had gathered for their security shocked him like a
thing unbelievable in spite of its reality. That such things could be,
fretted him into clamour. He wanted to point them out to all people. He
saw his neighbours' ears clogged, and he was prepared to die howling if
only he could pierce those encrusted auditories. That what was so
simple to him should not be understood by everybody! He could see
plainly and others could not, although their eyes looked straightly
forward and veritably rolled with intent and consciousness! Did their
eyes and ears and brains act differently to his, or was he a singular
monster cursed from his birth with madness? At times he was prepared to
let humanity and Ireland go to the devil their own way, he being well
assured that without him they were bound quickly for deep perdition. Of
Ireland he sometimes spoke with a fervour of passion which would be
outrageous if addressed to a woman. Surely he saw her as a woman,
queenly and distressed and very proud. He was physically anguished for
her, and the man who loved her was the very brother of his bones. There
were some words the effect of which were almost hypnotic on him--The
Isle of the Blest, The Little Dark Rose, The Poor Old Woman, and
Caitlin the Daughter of Holohan. The mere repetition of these phrases
lifted him to an ecstasy; they had hidden, magical meanings which
pricked deeply to his heart-strings and thrilled him to a tempest of
pity and love. He yearned to do deeds of valour, violent, grandiose
feats which would redound to her credit and make the name of Irishmen
synonymous with either greatness or singularity: for, as yet, the
distinction between these words was no more clear to him than it is to
any other young man who reads violence as heroism and eccentricity as
genius. Of England he spoke with something like stupefaction: as a
child cowering in a dark wood tells of the ogre who has slain his
father and carried his mother away to a drear captivity in his castle
built of bones--so he spoke of England. He saw an Englishman stalking
hideously forward with a princess tucked under each arm, while their
brothers and their knights were netted in enchantment and slept
heedless of the wrongs done to their ladies and of the defacement of
their shields... "Alas, alas and alas, for the once proud people of
Banba!"</p>

<h2>XXX</h2>

<p>Mrs. Makebelieve was astonished when the policeman knocked at her
door. A knock at her door was a rare sound, for many years had gone by
since any one had come to visit her. Of late Mrs. Cafferty often came
to talk to her, but she never knocked; she usually shouted, "Can I come
in?" and then she came in. But this was a ceremonious knock which
startled her, and the spectacle of the great man bending through the
doorway almost stopped her breath. Mary also was so shocked into terror
that she stood still, forgetful of all good manners, and stared at the
visitor open-eyed. She knew and did not know what he had come for; but
that, in some way, his appearance related to her she was instantly
assured, although she could not even dimly guess at a closer
explanation of his visit. His eyes stayed on her for an instant and
then passed to her mother, and, following her rather tremulous
invitation, he came into the room. There was no chair to sit on, so
Mrs. Makebelieve requested him to sit down on the bed, which he did.
She fancied he had come on some errand from Mrs. O'Connor, and was
inclined to be angry at a visit which she construed as an intrusion,
so, when he was seated, she waited to hear what he might have to
say.</p>

<p>Even to her it was evident that the big man was perplexed and
abashed; his hat was in his way, and so were his hands, and when he
spoke his voice was so husky as to be distressful. On Mary, who had
withdrawn to the very end of the room, this discomfort of speech had a
peculiar effect: the unsteady voice touched her breast to a kindred
fluttering, and her throat grew parched and so irritated that a violent
fit of coughing could not be restrained, and this, with the nervousness
and alarm which his appearance had thronged upon her, drove her to a
very fever of distress. But she could not take her eyes away from him,
and she wondered and was afraid of what he might say. She knew there
were a great many things he might discuss which she would be loath to
hear in her mother's presence, and which her mother would not be
gratified to hear either.</p>

<p>He spoke for a few moments about the weather, and Mrs. Makebelieve
hearkened to his remarks with a perplexity which she made no effort to
conceal. She was quite certain he had not called to speak about the
weather, and she was prepared to tell him so if a suitable opportunity
should occur. She was also satisfied that he had not come on a formal,
friendly visit--the memory of her last interview with him forbade such
a conjecture, for on that occasion politeness had been deposed from her
throne and acrimony had reigned in her stead. If his aunt had desired
him to undertake an embassy to her he would surely have delivered his
message without preamble, and would not have been thrown by so trifling
a duty into the state of agitation in which he was. It was obvious,
therefore, that he had not come with a message relating to her work.
Something of fear touched Mrs. Makebelieve as she looked at him, and
her voice had an uneasy note when she requested to know what she could
do for him.</p>

<p>The policeman suddenly, with the gesture of one throwing away
anchors, plunged into the heart of his matter, and as he spoke the look
on Mrs. Makebelieve's face changed quickly from bewilderment to
curiosity and dulled again to a blank amazement. After the first few
sentences she half turned to Mary, but an obscure shame prevented her
from searching out her daughter's eyes. It was borne quickly and
painfully to her that Mary had not treated her fairly: there was a
secret here with which a mother ought to have been trusted, and one
which she could not believe Mary would have withheld from her; and so,
gauging her child's feelings by her own, she steadfastly refused to
look at her lest the shocked surprise in her eyes might lacerate the
girl she loved, and who she knew must at the instant be in a sufficient
agony.--Undoubtedly the man was suggesting that he wanted to marry her
daughter, and the unexpectedness of such a proposal left her mentally
gaping; but that there must have been some preliminaries of meeting and
courtship became obvious to her. Mary also listened to his remarks in a
stupor. Was there no possibility at all of getting away from the man? A
tenacity such as this seemed to her malignant. She had the feeling of
one being pursued by some relentless and unscrupulous hunter. She heard
him speaking through a cloud, and the only things really clear to her
were the thoughts which she knew her mother must be thinking. She was
frightened and ashamed, and the sullenness which is the refuge of most
young people descended upon her like a darkness. Her face grew heavy
and vacant, and she stared in front of her in the attitude of one who
had nothing to do with what was passing. She did not believe altogether
that he was in earnest: her immediate discomfort showed him as one who
was merely seeking to get her into trouble with her mother in order to
gratify an impotent rage. Twice or three times she flamed suddenly,
went tiptoe to run from the room. A flash, and she would be gone from
the place, down the stairs, into the streets, and away anywhere, and
she tingled with the very speed of her vision; but she knew that one
word from her mother would halt her like a barrier, and she hated the
thought that he should be a witness to her obedience.</p>

<p>While he was speaking he did not look at Mary. He told Mrs.
Makebelieve that, he loved her daughter very much, and he begged her
permission and favour for his suit. He gave her to understand that he
and Mary had many opportunities of becoming acquainted, and were at one
in this desire for matrimony.--To Mrs. Makebelieve's mind there
recurred a conversation which she had once held with her daughter, when
Mary was curious to know if a policeman was a desirable person for a
girl to marry. She saw this question now, not as being prompted by a
laudable, an almost scientific curiosity, but as the interested, sly
speculation of a schemer hideously accomplished in deceit. Mary could
see that memory flitting back through her mother's brain, and it
tormented her. Nor was her mother at ease--there was no chair to sit
upon; she had to stand and listen to all this while he spoke, more or
less at his ease, from the bed. If she also had been sitting down she
might have been mistress of her thoughts and able to deal naturally
with the situation; but an easy pose is difficult when standing: her
hands would fold in front of her, and the school-girl attitude annoyed
and restrained her. Also, the man appeared to be in earnest in what he
said. His words at the least, and the intention which drove them,
seemed honourable. She could not give rein to her feelings without
lapsing to a barbarity which she might not justify to herself even in
anger, and might, indeed, blush to remember. Perhaps his chief
disqualification consisted in a relationship to Mrs. O'Connor for which
he could not justly be held to blame, and for which she sincerely
pitied him. But this certainly was a disqualification never to be
redeemed. He might leave hi's work, or his religion, or his country,
but he could never quit his aunt, because he carried her with him under
his skin; he was her with additions, and at times Mrs. Makebelieve
could see Mrs. O'Connor looking cautiously at her through the
policeman's eyes; a turn of his forehead and she was there like a thin
wraith that vanished and appeared again. The man was spoiled for her.
He did not altogether lack sense, and the fact that he wished to marry
her daughter showed that he was not so utterly beyond the reach of
redemption as she had fancied.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he had finished his statement as regarded the affection
which he bore to her daughter and the suitability of their
temperaments, and had hurled himself into an explanation of his worldly
affairs, comprising his salary as a policeman, the possibility of
promotion and the increased emoluments which would follow it, and the
certain pension which would sustain his age. There were, furthermore,
his parents, from whose decease he would reap certain monetary
increments, and the deaths of other relatives from which an additional
enlargement of his revenues might reasonably be expected. Indeed, he
had not desired to speak of these matters 'at all, but the stony
demeanour of Mrs. Makebelieve and the sullen aloofness of her daughter
forced him, however reluctantly, to draw even ignoble weapons from his
armoury. He had not conceived they would be so obdurate: he had, in
fact, imagined that the elder woman must be flattered by his offer to
marry her daughter, and when no evidence to support this was
forthcoming he was driven to appeal to the cupidity which he believed
occupies the heart of every middle-aged, hard-worked woman. But these
statements also were received with a dreadful composure. He could have
smashed Mrs. Makebelieve where she stood. Now and again his body
strained to a wild, physical outburst, a passionate, red fury that
would have terrified these women to their knees, while he roared their
screams into thin whimpers as a man should. He did not even dare to
stop speaking, and his efforts at an easy, good-humoured, half-careless
presentation of his case was bitterly painful to him as it was to his
auditors. The fact that they were both standing up unnerved him
also--the pleasant equality which should have formed the atmosphere of
such an interview was destroyed from the first moment, and having once
sat down, he did not like to stand up again. He felt glued to the bed
on which he sat, and he felt also that if he stood up the tension in
the room would so relax that Mrs. Makebelieve would at once break out
into speech sarcastic and final, or her daughter might scream
reproaches and disclaimers of an equal finality. At her he did not dare
to look, but the corner of his eye could see her shape stiffened
against the fireplace, an attitude so different from the pliable
contours to which he was accustomed in her as almost to be repellent.
He would have thanked God to find himself outside the room, but how to
get out of it he did not know: his self-esteem forbade anything like a
retreat without honour, his nervousness did not permit him to move at
all, the anger which prickled the surface of his body and mind was held
in check only by an instinct of fear as to what he might do if he
moved, and so, with dreadful jocularity, he commenced to speak of
himself, his personal character, his sobriety and steadiness--of all
those safe negations on which many women place reliance he spoke, and
also of certain small vices which he magnified merely for the sake of
talking, such as smoking, an odd glass of porter, and the shilling
which, now and again, he had ventured upon a race-horse.</p>

<p>Mary listened to him for a while with angry intentness. The fact
that she was the subject of his extraordinary discourse quickened at
the first all her apprehensions. Had the matter been less important she
would have been glad to look at herself in this strange position, and
to savour, with as much detachment as was possible, the whole spirit of
the adventure. But when she heard him, as she put it, "telling on her,"
laying bare to her mother all the walks they had taken together, visits
to restaurants and rambles through the streets and the parks, what he
had said to her on this occasion and on that, and her remarks on such
and such a matter, she could not visualise him save as a malignant and
uncultivated person; and when he tacitly suggested that she was as
eager for matrimony as he was, and so put upon her the horrible onus of
rejecting him before a second person, she closed her mind and her ears
against him. She refused to listen, although her perceptions admitted
the trend of his speech. His words droned heavily and monotonously to
her as through dull banks of fog. She made up her mind that if she were
asked any questions by either of them she would not reply, and that she
would not look at either of them; and then she thought that she would
snap and stamp her feet and say that she hated him, that he had looked
down on her because she worked for his aunt, that he had meanly been
ashamed of and cut her because she was poor, that he had been going
with another girl all the time he was going with her, and that he only
pursued her in order to annoy her; that she didn't love him, that she
didn't even like him--that, in fact, she disliked him heartily. She
wished to say all these things in one whirling outcry, but feared that
before she had rightly begun she might become abashed, or, worse, might
burst into tears and lose all the dignity which she meant to preserve
in his presence for the purpose of showing to him in the best light
exactly what he was losing.</p>

<p>But the big man had come to the end of his speech. He made a few
attempts to begin anew on the desirability of such a union for both of
them, and the happiness it would give him if Mrs. Makebelieve would
come to live with them when they were married. He refused to let it
appear that there was any doubt as to Mary's attitude in the matter,
for up to the moment he came to their door he had not doubted her
willingness himself. Her late avoidance of him he had put down to mere
feminine tactics, which leads on by holding off. The unwilling person
he had been assured was himself--he stooped to her, and it was only
after a severe battle that he had been able to do it. The astonishment
and disapproval of his relatives and friends at such a step were very
evident to him, for to a man of his position and figure girls were
cheap creatures, the best of them to be had for the mere asking.
Therefore, the fact that this girl could be seriously rejecting his
offer of marriage came upon him like red astonishment. He had no more
to say, however, and he blundered and fumbled into silence.</p>

<p>For a moment or two the little room was so still that the quietness
seemed to hum and buzz like an eternity. Then, with a sigh, Mrs.
Makebelieve spoke.</p>

<p>"I don't know at all," said she, "why you should speak to me about
this, for neither my daughter nor yourself have ever even hinted to me
before that you were courting one another. Why Mary should keep such a
secret from her own mother I don't know. Maybe I've been cruel and
frightened her, although I don't remember doing anything that she could
have against me of that sort: or, maybe, she didn't think I was wise
enough to advise her about a particular thing like her marriage, for,
God knows, old women are foolish enough in their notions, or else they
wouldn't be slaving and grinding for the sake of their children the way
they do be doing year in and year out, every day in the week, and every
hour of the day. It isn't any wonder at all that a child would be a
liar and a sleeveen and a trampler of the roads with the first man that
nods to her when her mother is a foolish person that she can't trust.
Of course, I wouldn't be looking for a gentleman like yourself to
mention the matter to me when I might be scrubbing out your aunt's
kitchen or her hall-door, maybe, and you sitting in the parlour with
the company. Sure, I'm only an old charwoman, and what does it matter
at all what I'd be thinking, or whether I'd be agreeing or not to
anything? Don't I get my wages for my work, and what more does anybody
want in the world? As for me going to live with you when you are
married--it was kind of you to ask me that; but it's not the sort of
thing I'm likely to do, for if I didn't care for you as a stranger I'm
not going to like you any better as my daughter's husband. You'll
excuse me saying one thing, sir, but while we are talking we may as
well be talking out, and it's this--that I never did like you, and I
never will like you, and I'd sooner see my daughter married to any one
at all than to yourself. But, sure, I needn't be talking about it;
isn't it Mary's business altogether? and she'll be settling it with you
nicely, I don't doubt. She's a practised hand now at arranging things,
like you are yourself, and it will do me good to be learning something
from her."</p>

<p>Mrs. Makebelieve took a cloth in her hand and walked over to the
fireplace, which she commenced to polish.</p>

<p>The big man looked at Mary. It was incumbent on him to say
something. Twice he attempted to speak, and each time, on finding
himself about to say something regarding the weather, he stopped. Mary
did not look at him; her eyes were fixed stubbornly on a part of the
wall well away from his neighbourhood, and it seemed to him that she
had made a vow to herself never to look at him again. But the utter
silence of the room was unbearable. He knew that he ought to get up and
go out, but he could not bring himself to do so. His self-love, his
very physical strength, rebelled against so tame a surrender. One
thought he gathered in from swaying vacuity--that the timid little
creature whom he had patronised would not find the harsh courage to
refuse him point--blank if he charged her straitly with the question:
and so he again assayed speech.</p>

<p>"Your mother is angry with us, Mary," said he, "and I suppose she
has good right to be angry; but the reason I did not speak to her
before, as I admit I should have if I'd done the right thing, was that
I had very few chances of meeting her, and never did meet her without
some other person being there at the same time. I suppose the reason
you did not say anything was that you wanted to be quite sure of
yourself and of me too before you mentioned it. We have both done the
wrong thing in not being open, but maybe your mother will forgive us
when she knows we had no intention of hurting her, or of doing anything
behind her back. Your mother seems to hate me: I don't know why,
because she hardly knows me at all, and I've never done her any harm or
said a word against her. Perhaps when she knows me as well as you do
she'll change her mind: but you know I love you better than any one
else, and that I'd do anything I could to please you and be a good
husband to you. What I want to ask you before your mother is--will you
marry me?"</p>

<p>Mary made no reply. She did not look or give the slightest sign that
she had heard. But now it was that she did not dare to look at him. The
spectacle of this big man badgered by her and by her mother, pleading
to her, and pleading, as he and she well knew, hopelessly, would have
broken her heart if she looked at him. She had to admire the good
masculine fight he made of it. Even his tricks of word and tactic,
which she instantly divined, moved her almost to tears; but she feared
terribly that if she met his gaze she might not be able to resist his
huge helplessness, and that she might be compelled to do whatever he
begged of her even in despite of her own wishes.</p>

<p>The interval which followed his question weighed heavily upon them
all. It was only broken by Mrs. Makebelieve, who began to hum a song as
she polished the fire-grate. She meant to show her careless detachment
from the whole matter, but in the face of Mary's silence she could not
keep it up. After a few moments she moved around and said:</p>

<p>"Why don't you answer the gentleman, Mary?"</p>

<p>Mary turned and looked at her, and the tears which she had resisted
so long swam in her eyes: although she could keep her features composed
she had no further command over her tears.</p>

<p>"I'll answer whatever you ask me, mother," she whispered.</p>

<p>"Then, tell the gentleman whether you will marry him or not."</p>

<p>"I don't want to marry any one at all," said Mary.</p>

<p>"You are not asked to marry any one, darling," said Mrs.
Makebelieve, "but some one--this gentleman here whose name I don't
happen to know. Do you know his name?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mary.</p>

<p>"My name..." began the policeman.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter, sir," said Mrs. Make-believe. "Do you want to
marry this gentleman, Mary?"</p>

<p>"No," whispered Mary.</p>

<p>"Are you in love with him?"</p>

<p>Mary turned completely away from him. "No," she whispered again.</p>

<p>"Do you think you ever will be in love with him?"</p>

<p>She felt as a rat might when hunted to a corner. But the end must be
very near; this could not last for ever, because nothing can. Her lips
were parched, her eyes were burning. She wanted to lie down and go
asleep, and waken again laughing to say, "It was a dream."</p>

<p>Her reply was almost inaudible. "No," she said.</p>

<p>"You are quite sure? It is always better to be quite sure."</p>

<p>She did not answer any more, but the faint droop of her head gave
the reply her mother needed.</p>

<p>"You see, sir," said Mrs. Makebelieve, "that you were mistaken in
your opinion. My daughter is not old enough yet to be thinking of
marriage and such-like. Children do be thoughtless. I am sorry for all
the trouble she has given you, and "--a sudden compunction stirred her,
for the man was standing up now, and there was no trace of Mrs.
O'Connor visible in him; his face was as massive and harsh as a piece
of wall. "Don't you be thinking too badly of us now," said Mrs.
Makebelieve, with some agitation; "the child is too young altogether to
be asking her to marry. Maybe in a year or two--I said things, I know,
but I was vexed, and..."</p>

<p>The big man nodded his head and marched out.</p>

<p>Mary ran to her mother, moaning like a sick person, but Mrs.
Makebelieve did not look at her. She lay down on the bed and turned her
face to the wall, and she did not speak to Mary for a long time.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>XXXI</h2>

<p>When the young man who lodged with Mrs. Cafferty came in on the
following day he presented a deplorable appearance. His clothes were
torn and his face had several large strips of sticking-plaster on it,
but he seemed to be in a mood of extraordinary happiness
notwithstanding, and proclaimed that he had participated in the one
really great fight of his lifetime, that he wasn't injured at all, and
that he wouldn't have missed it for a pension.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cafferty was wild with indignation, and marched him into Mrs.
Makebelieve's room, where he had again to tell his story and have his
injuries inspected and commiserated. Even Mr. Cafferty came into the
room on this occasion. He was a large, slow man, dressed very
comfortably in a red beard--his beard was so red and so persistent that
it quite overshadowed the rest of his wrappings and did, indeed, seem
to clothe him. As he stood the six children walked in and out of his
legs, and stood on his feet in their proper turns without causing him
any apparent discomfort. During the young man's recital Mr. Cafferty
every now and then solemnly and powerfully smote his left hand with his
right fist, and requested that the aggressor should be produced to
him.</p>

<p>The young man said that as he was coming home the biggest man in the
world walked up to him. He had never set eyes on the man before in his
life, and thought at first he wanted to borrow a match or ask the way
to somewhere, or something like that, and, accordingly, he halted; but
the big man gripped him by the shoulder and said, "You damned young
whelp!" and then he laughed and hit him a tremendous blow with his
other hand. He twisted himself free at that, and said, "What's that
for?" and then the big man made another desperate clout at him. A
fellow wasn't going to stand that kind of thing, so he let out at him
with his left, and then jumped in with two short arm jabs that must
have tickled the chap; that fellow didn't have it all his own way
anyhow...The young man exhibited his knuckles, which were skinned and
bleeding, as evidence of some exchange; but, he averred, you might as
well be punching a sack of coal as that man's face. In another minute
they both slipped and rolled over and over in the road, hitting and
kicking as they sprawled: then a crowd of people ran forward and pulled
them asunder. When they were separated he saw the big man lift his
fist, and the person who was holding him ducked suddenly and ran for
his life: the other folk got out of the way too, and the big man walked
over to where he stood and stared into his face. His jaw was stuck out
like the seat of a chair, and his moustache was like a bristle of
barbed wire. The young man said to him, "What the hell's wrong with you
to go bashing a man for nothing at all?" and all of a sudden the big
fellow turned and walked away. It was a grand fight altogether, said
the youth, but the other man was a mile and a half too big for him.</p>

<p>As this story proceeded Mrs. Makebelieve looked once or twice at her
daughter. Mary's face had gone very pale, and she nodded back a
confirmation of her mother's conjecture; but it did not seem necessary
or wise to either of them that they should explain their thoughts. The
young man did not require either condolences or revenge. He was well
pleased at an opportunity to measure his hardihood against a worthy
opponent. He had found that his courage exceeded his strength, as it
always should--for how could we face the gods and demons of existence
if our puny arms were not backed up by our invincible eyes?--and he
displayed his contentment at the issue as one does a banner emblazoned
with merits. Mrs. Makebelieve understood also that the big man's action
was merely his energetic surrender, as of one who, instead of tendering
his sword courteously to the victor, hurls it at him with a
malediction; and that in assaulting their friend he was bidding them
farewell as heartily and impressively as he was able. So they fed the
young man and extolled him, applauding to the shrill winding of his
trumpet until he glowed again in the full satisfaction of heroism.</p>

<p>He and Mary did not discontinue their evening walks. Of these Mrs.
Makebelieve was fully cognisant, and although she did not remark on the
fact, she had been observing the growth of their intimacy with a care
which was one part approval and one part pain; for it was very evident
to her that her daughter was no longer a child to be controlled and
directed by authority. Her little girl was a big girl; she had grown up
and was eager to undertake the business of life on her own behalf. But
the period of Mrs. Makebelieve's motherhood had drawn to a close, and
her arms were empty. She was too used now to being a mother to
relinquish easily the prerogatives of that status, and her discontent
had this justification and assistance that it could be put into
definite words, fronted and approved or rejected as reason urged. By
knowledge and thought we will look through a stone wall if we look long
enough, for we see less through eyes than through Time. Time is the
clarifying perspective whereby myopia of any kind is adjusted, and a
thought emerges in its field as visibly as a tree does in nature's.
Mrs. Makebelieve saw seventeen years' apprenticeship to maternity
cancelled automatically without an explanation or a courtesy, and for a
little time her world was in ruins, the ashes of existence powdered her
hair and her forehead. Then she discovered that the debris was valuable
in known currency; the dust was golden: her love remained to her
undisturbed and unlikely to be disturbed by whatever event. And she
discovered further that parentage is neither a game nor a privilege,
but a duty; it is--astounding thought--the care of the young until the
young can take care of itself. It was for this freedom only that her
elaborate care had been necessary; her bud had blossomed and she could
add no more to its bloom or fragrance. Nothing had happened that was
not natural, and whoso opposes his brow against that imperious urgency
is thereby renouncing his kind and claiming a kinship with the wild
boar and the goat, which they, too, may repudiate with leaden
foreheads. There remained also the common human equality, not alone of
blood, but of sex also, which might be fostered and grow to an intimacy
more dear and enduring, more lovely and loving, than the necessarily
one-sided devotions of parentage. Her duties in that relationship
having been performed, it was her daughter's turn to take up hers and
prove her rearing by repaying to her mother the conscious love which
intelligence and a good heart dictates. This given Mrs. Makebelieve
could smile happily again, for her arms would be empty only for a
little time. The continuity of nature does not fail, saving for
extraordinary instances. She sees to it that a breast and an arm shall
not very long be unoccupied, and consequently, as Mrs. Makebelieve sat
contemplating that futurity which is nothing more than a prolongation
of experience, she could smile contentedly, for all was very well.</p>

<p>If the unexpected did not often happen life would be a logical,
scientific progression which might become dispirited and repudiate its
goal for very boredom, but nature has cunningly diversified the methods
whereby she coaxes or coerces us to prosecute, not our own, but her own
adventure. Beyond every corner there may be a tavern or a church
wherein both the saint and the sinner may be entrapped and remoulded.
Beyond the skyline you may find a dynamite cartridge, a drunken tinker,
a mad dog, or a shilling which some person has dropped; and any one of
these unexpectednesses may be potent to urge the traveller down a side
street and put a crook in the straight line which had been his life,
and to which he had become miserably reconciled. The element of
surprise being, accordingly, one of the commonest things in the world,
we ought not to be hypercritical in our review of singularities, or
say, "These things do not happen "--because it is indisputable that
they do happen. That combination which comprises a dark night, a
highwayman armed and hatted to the teeth, and myself, may be a purely
fortuitous one, but will such a criticism bring any comfort to the
highwayman? And the concourse of three benevolent millionaires with the
person to whom poverty can do no more is so pleasant and possible that
I marvel it does not occur more frequently. I am prepared to believe on
the very lightest assurance that these things do happen, but are hushed
up for reasons which would be cogent enough if they were available.</p>

<p>Mrs. Makebelieve opened the letter which the evening's post had
brought to her. She had pondered well before opening it, and had
discussed with her daughter all the possible people who could have
written it. The envelope was long and narrow; it was addressed in a
swift emphatic hand, the tail of the letter M enjoying a career
distinguished beyond any of its fellows by length and beauty. The
envelope, moreover, was sealed by a brilliant red lion with jagged
whiskers and a simper, who threatened the person daring to open a
missive not addressed to him with the vengeance of a battle-axe which
was balanced lightly but truculently on his right claw.</p>

<p>This envelope contained several documents purporting to be copies of
extraordinary originals, and amongst them a letter which was read by
Mrs. Makebelieve more than ten thousand times or ever she went to bed
that night. It related that more than two years previously one Patrick
Joseph Brady had departed this life, and that his will (dated from a
multitudinous address in New York) devised and bequeathed to his dearly
beloved sister Mary Eileen Makebelieve, otherwise Brady, the following
shares and securities for shares, to wit...and the thereinafter
mentioned houses and messuages, lands, tenements, hereditaments, and
premises, that was to say...and all household furniture, books,
pictures, prints, plate, linen, glass, and objects of vertu, carriages,
wines, liquors, and all consumable stores and effects whatsoever then
in the house so and so, and all money then in the Bank and thereafter
to accrue due upon the thereinbefore mentioned stocks, funds, shares,
and securities...Mrs. Makebelieve wept and besought God not to make a
fool of a woman who was not only poor but old. The letter requested her
to call on the following day, or at her earliest convenience, to "the
above address," and desired that she should bring with her such letters
or other documents as would establish her relationship to the deceased
and assist in extracting the necessary Grant of Probate to the said
Will, and it was subscribed by Messrs. Platitude and Glambe,
Solicitors, Commissioners for Oaths, and Protectors of the Poor.</p>

<p>To the Chambers of these gentlemen Mrs. Makebelieve and Mary
repaired on the following day, and having produced the letters and
other documents for inspection, the philanthropists, Platitude and
Glambe, professed themselves to be entirely satisfied as to their bona
fides, and exhibited an eagerness to be of immediate service to the
ladies in whatever capacity might be conceived. Mrs. Make-believe
instantly invoked the Pragmatic Sanction; she put the entire matter to
the touchstone of absolute verity by demanding an advance of fifty
pounds. Her mind reeled as she said the astounding amount, but her
voice did not. A cheque was signed and a clerk despatched, who returned
with eight five-pound notes and ten sovereigns of massy gold. Mrs.
Makebelieve secreted these, and went home marvelling to find that she
was yet alive. No trams ran over her. The motorcars pursued her, and
were evaded. She put her hope in God, and explained so breathlessly to
the furious street. One cyclist who took corners on trust she cursed by
the Ineffable Name, but instantly withdrew the malediction for luck,
and addressed his dwindling back with an eye of misery and a voice of
benediction. For a little time neither she nor her daughter spoke of
the change in their fortunes saving in terms of allusion; they feared
that, notwithstanding their trust, God might hear and shatter them with
His rolling laughter. They went out again that day furtively and
feverishly and bought...</p>

<p>But on the following morning Mrs. Make-believe returned again to her
labour. She intended finishing her week's work with Mrs. O'Connor (it
might not last for a week). She wished to observe that lady with the
exact particularity, the singleness of eye, the true, candid, critical
scrutiny which had hitherto been impossible to her. It was, she said to
Mary, just possible that Mrs. O'Connor might make some remarks about
soap. It was possible that the lady might advance theories as to how
this or that particular kind of labour ought to be conducted...Mrs.
Makebelieve's black eye shone upon her child with a calm peace, a
benevolent happiness rare indeed to human regard.</p>

<p>In the evening of that day Mary and the young man who lodged with
their neighbour went out for the walk which had become customary with
them. The young man had been fed with an amplitude which he had never
known before, so that not even the' remotest slim thread, shred, hint,
echo, or memory of hunger remained with him: he tried but could not
make a dint in himself anywhere, and, consequently, he was as sad as
only a well-fed person can be. Now that his hunger was gone he deemed
that all else was gone also. His hunger, his sweetheart, his hopes, his
good looks (for his injuries had matured to the ripe purple of the
perfect bruise), all were gone, gone, gone. He told it to Mary, but she
did not listen to him; to the rolling sky he announced it, and it paid
no heed. He walked beside Mary at last in silence, listening to her
plans and caprices, the things she would do and buy, the people to whom
gifts should be made, and the species of gift uniquely suitable to this
person and to that person, the people to whom money might be given and
the amounts, and the methods whereby such largesse could be
distributed. Hats were mentioned, and dresses, and the new house
somewhere--a space-embracing somewhere, beyond surmise, beyond
geography. They walked onwards for a long time, so long that at last a
familiar feeling stole upon the youth. The word "food" seemed suddenly
a topic worthy of the most spirited conversation. His spirits arose. He
was no longer solid, space belonged to him also, it was in him and of
him, and so there was a song in his heart. He was hungry and the friend
of man again. Now everything was possible. The girl? Was she not by his
side? The regeneration of Ireland and of Man? That could be done also;
a little leisure and everything that can be thought can be done: even
his good looks might be returned to him; he felt the sting and
tightness of his bruises and was reassured, exultant. He was a man
predestined to bruises; they would be his meat and drink and happiness,
his refuge and sanctuary for ever. Let us leave him, then, pacing
volubly by the side of Mary, and exploring with a delicate finger his
half-closed eye, which, until it was closed entirely, would always be
half-closed by the decent buffet of misfortune. His ally and stay was
hunger, and there is no better ally for any man: that satisfied and the
game is up; for hunger is life, ambition, goodwill and understanding,
while fulness is all those negatives which culminate in greediness,
stupidity, and decay; so his bruises troubled him no further than as
they affected the eyes of a lady wherein he prayed to be comely.</p>

<p>Bruises, unless they are desperate indeed, will heal at the last for
no other reason than that they must. The inexorable compulsion of all
things is towards health or destruction, life or death, and we hasten
our joys or our woes to the logical extreme. It is urgent, therefore,
that we be joyous if we wish to live. Our heads may be as solid as is
possible, but our hearts and our heels shall be light or we are ruined.
As to the golden mean--let us have nothing to do with that thing at
all; it may only be gilded, it is very likely made of tin of a dull
colour and a lamentable sound, unworthy even of being stolen; and
unless our treasures may be stolen they are of no use to us. It is
contrary to the laws of life to possess that which other people do not
want; therefore, your beer shall foam, your wife shall be pretty, and
your little truth shall have a plum in it--for this is so, that your
beer can only taste of your company, you can only know your wife when
some one else does, and your little truth shall be savoured or perish.
Do you demand a big truth? Then, 0 Ambitious! you must turn aside from
all your companions and sit very quietly, and if you sit long enough
and quiet enough it may come to you; but this thing alone of all things
you cannot steal, nor can it be given to you by the County Council. It
cannot be communicated, and yet you may get it. It is unspeakable but
not unthinkable, and it is born as certainly and unaccountably as you
were yourself, and is of just as little immediate consequence. Long,
long ago, in the dim beginnings of the world, there was a careless and
gay young man who said, "Let truth go to hell "--and it went there. It
was his misfortune that he had to follow it; it is ours that we are his
descendants. An evil will either kill you or be killed by you, and (the
reflection is comforting) the odds are with us in every fight waged
against humanity by the dark or elemental beings. But humanity is timid
and lazy, a believer in golden means and subterfuges and compromises,
loath to address itself to any combat until its frontiers are virtually
overrun and its cities and granaries and places of refuge are in
jeopardy from those gloomy marauders. In that wide struggle which we
call Progress, evil is always the aggressor and the vanquished, and it
is right that this should be so, for without its onslaughts and
depredations humanity might fall to a fat slumber upon its corn-sacks
and die snoring: or, alternatively, lacking these valorous alarms and
excursions, it might become self-satisfied and formularised, and be
crushed to death by the mere dull density of virtue. Next to good the
most valuable factor in life is evil. By the interaction of these all
things are possible, and therefore (or for any other reason that
pleases you) let us wave a friendly hand in the direction of that bold,
bad policeman whose thoughts were not governed by the Book of
Regulations which is issued to all recruits, and who, in despite of the
fact that he was enrolled among the very legions of order, had that
chaos in his soul which may "give birth to a Dancing Star."</p>

<p>As to Mary: Even ordinary, workaday politeness frowns on too abrupt
a departure from a lady, particularly one whom we have companioned thus
distantly from the careless simplicity of girlhood to the equally
careless but complex businesses of adolescence. The world is all before
her, and her chronicler may not be her guide. She will have adventures,
for everybody has. She will win through with them, for everybody does.
She may even meet bolder and badder men than the policeman--shall we,
then, detain her? I, for one, having urgent calls elsewhere, will
salute her fingers and raise my hat and stand aside, and you will do
likewise, because it is my pleasure that you should. She will go
forward, then, to do that which is pleasing to the gods, for less than
that she cannot do, and more is not to be expected of any one.</p>
