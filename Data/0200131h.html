  <h2>ARROWSMITH: A CONTEMPORARY REVIEW</h2>

  <h3>FROM <i>THE SPECTATOR</i>, LONDON, 7 MARCH 1925</h3>

  <p class="first">WE have already seen Mr. Sinclair Lewis display his talents
  in their full brilliance; but in <i>Martin Arrowsmith</i> he has made a
  serious effort to subjugate those talents, to use them steadily, to make them
  instruments to solidify and dignify his theme. In a word, he has tried to
  write a big novel. That is a cheering ambition, and we are grateful to him.
  When a writer already famous sets out with all his powers under control to
  justify that fame, we feel that he is giving us much more than we deserve.
  And though it turns out that Mr. Sinclair Lewis's new novel is accumulatively
  good, and not centrally good, though still it is the detail that interests
  and moves us most, yet <i>Martin Arrowsmith</i> is beyond doubt the best of
  Mr. Lewis's novels.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it will be well to begin by stating the theme, the first impulses
  of the book. It is an exposure of amateurism, blatancy, and purposelessness
  in life; it is an argument for the self-sacrificing, self-abnegating cold
  fury of hard work. And, as it deals with science, especially with medicine,
  the moral of the book is something like this: "Popularizers and publicists
  are scoundrels. There is a treachery to the cause of science in every mode of
  scientific occupation except the severest and most sceptical research. Work
  ten years, if need be, at the verification of the minutest details. Observe a
  thousand times before you theorize. Never be satisfied until you have proved
  each point beyond the possibility of error. Take no thought for fame or
  money, do not be misled even by a desire to throw open the benefits of
  science to mankind. It is only when a theory is established finally as a fact
  that it becomes really valuable."</p>

  <p>And that is rather a poor moral; or shall we say, it is shockingly
  incomplete. In so far as it is Mr. Sinclair Lewis's own opinion, which he
  wishes to propagate among us, we must condemn it out of hand. It is simply
  not true that the great triumphs and discoveries of science have been made by
  assiduous inductions. The verification of scientific theories can often be
  left, most economically and most safely, to someone other than their
  propounder. But it has at any rate provided Mr. Lewis with a theme to unify
  his book, and in so far as it is an ideal to his chief character, driving him
  to his best accomplishment, keeping him from sinking into laziness or
  carelessness, bringing him into emotional conflicts and giving him the chance
  to display his individuality, it is a good and legitimate background for the
  story. And where it occurs as an ideal in definite and final contrast with
  other ideals, when we are so placed that we are forced to choose between an
  almost heartless devotion to science and the common and passionate sympathies
  of our blood, so that heaven-only-knows which is the better choice, then the
  quarrel of ideals. becomes noble and tragic. In short, Mr. Lewis has made his
  novel a story with a problem, and he has explicitly stated his own side in
  the problem. That is the unforgivable sin in a work of creative fiction; the
  author's decision may be implicit; must be, indeed; but it must not be
  explicit; it must not be open for a casual, thoughtless, unrealizing reader
  to fix upon. So it happens that Mr. Lewis, in trying to write a great novel,
  has failed; but has nevertheless allowed himself the most thorough
  organization of his talents. His canvas is crowded, and surprisingly good in
  all its parts.</p>

  <p>He begins by showing us Martin Arrowsmith as a young medical student at
  the University of Winnemac. He is differentiated from his fellows by a kind
  of sullen and unsatisfied desire to find some creative work, some
  contribution to reality, to occupy and complete his life. There is Angus
  Muir, on the other hand, who knows from the beginning what he wants of the
  future; he is making himself proficient in medicine and physiology and
  surgery; he is ambitious and cold and competent. In many ways he is far more
  to be admired than Martin; for he really achieves as much knowledge of his
  profession as a fierce and controlled intention to "succeed" can bring him.
  There is Clif Clawson, too; a vulgar, friendly, practical-joking fellow,
  rather awful, but high-spirited and valuable for his freedom from snobbery.
  There is the Rev. Ira Hinkley, flowing over with missionary zeal and loving
  kindness, a fundamentalist and an intrusive bore, regarding cigarette-smoking
  as a diabolic sin, but being quite gentle and patronizing in his
  condemnations. He, too, has a kind of value in his ability to sacrifice
  himself for his principles and bear sneers and curses with equanimity. These
  characters are made as vivid and significant as could well be; Mr. Lewis has
  an admirable talent for convincing portraits.</p>

  <p>But Martin vacillates and despairs: he is involved in successive
  enthusiasms for this branch of science and that, this lecturer and that; he
  works hard and wastes his time alternately; he envies and despises social
  success and culture; be falls in love, he gets dead-drunk, he is impertinent
  to his tutors, he cannot confine himself to any ideal or to any line of work.
  His most constant enthusiasm is for Dr. Gottlieb, who represents to him
  science at its purest and best. For Gottlieb is a shabby, shambling old man,
  the chief expert in the world on his own subjects, with an unwavering
  contempt for charlatanry, for fame, for stamped work, an unwavering devotion
  to accuracy and thoroughness in scientific investigation. He publishes a
  paper once every five years that half-a-dozen men in the world can
  understand; and those half-dozen know when they see it that they can accept
  its findings as indubitably established.</p>

  <p>Martin has not yet reached such a stability of will that he can join
  Gottlieb in his single-hearted devotion; but through all his vacillations he
  keeps in the end Gottlieb's ideal for his own.</p>

  <p>He has the good fortune, quite unmerited, to marry an enchanting girl,
  matter-of-fact, tender and passionate, who loves him with her whole nature
  and yet, as much for his sake as for hers, never allows her personality to be
  swamped by his. She is content always with his actions, because she retains
  so deep a faith in his final integrity; but they are so much at one that they
  can allow themselves explosions of temper and domestic quarrels.</p>

  <p>We follow them through their vicissitudes; the disillusioning life of a
  general practitioner in a small town; the still more contemptible life of a
  health officer in a town notable for its "go," where every week was a Write
  to Mother week, an Eat more Corn week, a Banish the Booze week, a Tougher
  Teeth week; a More and Better Babies week, a Stop the Spitter Week...; the
  unimaginative life of a pathologist in a great clinic. And then he goes, with
  a sense of liberation and joy, to laboratory work under Gottlieb.</p>

  <p>The review may have sounded ungenerous up to this point; but, in truth,
  <i>Martin Arrowsmith</i> is absorbing and illuminating on every page; and
  whatever fault may be found with the theme of the book, the actual
  development, the comment, the portrayal of character, is masterly, beyond
  praise. The book is so packed with good work that only a few page of
  quotation would indicate its virtues. There arc a dozen kinds of delight in
  it; we must quote at least an extract from the <i>Leopolis Gazette</i>, an
  incredibly good satire upon the style of American small-town
  journalism:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="quote">"Dr. M. Arrowsmith of Wheatsylvania is being congratulated,
  we are informed by our valued pioneer local physician, Dr. Adam Winter, by
  the medical fraternity all through the Pong River Valley, there being no
  occupation or profession more unselfishly appreciative of each other's
  virtues than the medical gentlemen, on the courage and enterprise he recently
  displayed in addition to his scientific skill. Being called, to attend the
  little daughter of Henry Norwalk of near Delft the well-known farmer and
  finding the little one near death with diphtheria he made a desperate attempt
  to save it by himself bringing antitoxin from Blassner our ever popular
  druggist, who had on hand a full and fresh supply. He drove out and back in
  his gasoline chariot, making the total distance of 48 miles in 79 minutes.
  Fortunately our ever alert policeman, Joe Colby, was on the job and helped
  Dr. Arrowsmith find Mr. Blassner's bungalow on Red River Avenue and this
  gentleman rose from bed and hastened to supply the needed article but
  unfortunately the child was already too low to be saved but it is by such
  incidents of pluck and quick thinking as well as knowledge which make the
  medical profession one of our greatest blessings."</p>

  <p>While Martin is working in the laboratbry he discovers a new principle in
  medicine, a bacteriophage, an organism which feeds upon germs, and he is
  applying himself to the nature of the bacteriophage upon the germs of the
  plague when news is brought that in one of the West Indies, St. Hubert, the
  plague is raging with pitiable severity. Here is his chance to go out and
  test the value of his discovery; to establish beyond doubt for all future
  time the scientific facts. But he will need to be ruthless. Every victim must
  be a case, not a human creature. He must inject the phage into half the
  population only, and contrast the incidence of plague among them with the
  incidence among the untreated. He must not allow himself to be carried away
  by any false humanitarianism; he must allow men to die in order that future
  generations should be saved. He goes and sees the misery and squalor, the
  pain, the ruin, the tragedy. His wife, his dearest intimate, dies while he is
  at work in another part of the island. And in the black struggle between his
  ideals and his heart, it is heart that wins. He becomes a traitor to himself,
  a traitor to Gottlieb, a traitor to science; he treats his patients
  indiscriminately. And the plague stops; but who can say now what caused it to
  stop? Had it exhausted its virulence or had Martin's discovery proved its
  worth?</p>

  <p>It is here, in the bleak picture of death and the torture of the heart
  that Mr. Lewis reaches his greatest height. Martin recovers from his shame,
  and we leave him working with a static resolve never again to let himself be
  tempted from the path of pure science. But it would have been better if we
  bad left him in that deadlock of ideals; for there Mr. Lewis has truly shown
  us tragedy.<br></p>

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1">CHAPTER I.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">The driver of the wagon swaying through forest and swamp of
  the Ohio wilderness was a ragged girl of fourteen. Her mother they had buried
  near the Monongahela&mdash;the girl herself had heaped with torn sods the
  grave beside the river of the beautiful name. Her father lay shrinking with
  fever on the floor of the wagon-box, and about him played her brothers and
  sisters, dirty brats, tattered brats, hilarious brats.</p>

  <p>She halted at the fork in the grassy road, and the sick man quavered,
  "Emmy, ye better turn down towards Cincinnati. If we could find your Uncle
  Ed, I guess he'd take us in."</p>

  <p>"Nobody ain't going to take us in," she said. "We're going on jus' long as
  we can. Going West! They's a whole lot of new things I aim to be seeing!"</p>

  <p>She cooked the supper, she put the children to bed, and sat by the fire,
  alone.</p>

  <p>That was the great-grandmother of Martin Arrowsmith.</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">Cross-legged in the examining-chair in Doc Vickerson's
  office, a boy was reading "Gray's Anatomy." His name was Martin Arrowsmith,
  of Elk Mills, in the state of Winnemac.</p>

  <p>There was a suspicion in Elk Mills&mdash;now, in 1897, a dowdy red-brick
  village, smelling of apples&mdash;that this brown-leather adjustable seat
  which Doc Vickerson used for minor operations, for the infrequent pulling of
  teeth and for highly frequent naps, had begun life as a barber's chair. There
  was also a belief that its proprietor must once have been called Doctor
  Vickerson, but for years he had been only The Doc, and he was scurfier and
  much less adjustable than the chair.</p>

  <p>Martin was the son of J. J. Arrowsmith, who conducted the New York
  Clothing Bazaar. By sheer brass and obstinacy he had, at fourteen, become the
  unofficial, also decidedly unpaid, assistant to the Doc, and while the Doc
  was on a country call he took charge&mdash;though what there was to take
  charge of, no one could ever make out. He was a slender boy, not very tall;
  his hair and restless eyes were black, his skin unusually white, and the
  contrast gave him an air of passionate variability. The squareness of his
  head and a reasonable breadth of shoulders saved him from any appearance of
  effeminacy or of that querulous timidity which artistic young gentlemen call
  Sensitiveness. When he lifted his head to listen, his right eyebrow, slightly
  higher than the left, rose and quivered in his characteristic expression of
  energy, of independence, and a hint that he could fight, a look of
  impertinent inquiry which had been known to annoy his teachers and the Sunday
  School superintendent.</p>

  <p>Martin was, like most inhabitants of Elk Mills before the Slavo-Italian
  immigration, a Typical Pure-bred Anglo-Saxon American, which means that he
  was a union of German, French, Scotch, Irish, perhaps a little Spanish,
  conceivably a little of the strains lumped together as "Jewish," and a great
  deal of English, which is itself a combination of primitive Briton, Celt,
  Phoenician, Roman, German, Dane, and Swede.</p>

  <p>It is not certain that, in attaching himself to Doc Vickerson, Martin was
  entirely and edifyingly controlled by a desire to become a Great Healer. He
  did awe his Gang by bandaging stone-bruises, dissecting squirrels, and
  explaining the astounding and secret matters to be discovered at the back of
  the physiology, but he was not completely free from an ambition to command
  such glory among them as was enjoyed by the son of the Episcopalian minister,
  who could smoke an entire cigar without becoming sick. Yet this afternoon he
  read steadily at the section on the lymphatic system, and he muttered the
  long and perfectly incomprehensible words in a hum which made drowsier the
  dusty room.</p>

  <p>It was the central room of the three occupied by Doc Vickerson, facing on
  Main Street above the New York Clothing Bazaar. On one side of it was the
  foul waiting-room, on the other, the Doc's bedroom. He was an aged widower;
  for what he called "female fixings" he cared nothing; and the bedroom with
  its tottering bureau and its cot of frowsy blankets was cleaned only by
  Martin, in not very frequent attacks of sanitation.</p>

  <p>This central room was at once business office, consultation-room,
  operating-theater, living-room, poker den, and warehouse for guns and fishing
  tackle. Against a brown plaster wall was a cabinet of zoological collections
  and medical curiosities, and beside it the most dreadful and fascinating
  object known to the boy-world of Elk Mills&mdash;a skeleton with one gaunt
  gold tooth. On evenings when the Doc was away, Martin would acquire prestige
  among the trembling Gang by leading them into the unutterable darkness and
  scratching a sulfur match on the skeleton's jaw.</p>

  <p>On the wall was a home-stuffed pickerel on a home-varnished board. Beside
  the rusty stove, a sawdust-box cuspidor rested on a slimy oilcloth worn
  through to the threads. On the senile table was a pile of memoranda of debts
  which the Doc was always swearing he would "collect from those dead-beats
  right now," and which he would never, by any chance, at any time, collect
  from any of them. A year or two&mdash;a decade or two&mdash;a century or
  two&mdash;they were all the same to the plodding doctor in the bee-murmuring
  town.</p>

  <p>The most unsanitary corner was devoted to the cast-iron sink, which was
  oftener used for washing eggy breakfast plates than for sterilizing
  instruments. On its ledge were a broken test-tube, a broken fishhook, an
  unlabeled and forgotten bottle of pills, a nail-bristling heel, a frayed
  cigar-butt, and a rusty lancet stuck in a potato.</p>

  <p>The wild raggedness of the room was the soul and symbol of Doc Vickerson;
  it was more exciting than the flat-faced stack of shoe-boxes in the New York
  Bazaar: it was the lure to questioning and adventure for Martin
  Arrowsmith.</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">The boy raised his head, cocked his inquisitive brow. On the
  stairway was the cumbersome step of Doc Vickerson. The Doc was sober! Martin
  would not have to help him into bed.</p>

  <p>But it was a bad sign that the Doc should first go down the hall to his
  bedroom. The boy listened sharply. He heard the Doc open the lower part of
  the washstand, where he kept his bottle of Jamaica rum. After a long gurgle
  the invisible Doc put away the bottle and decisively kicked the doors shut.
  Still good. Only one drink. If he came into the consultation-room at once, he
  would be safe. But he was still standing in the bedroom. Martin sighed as the
  washstand doors were hastily opened again, as he heard another gurgle and a
  third.</p>

  <p>The Doc's step was much livelier when he loomed into the office, a gray
  mass of a man with a gray mass of mustache, a form vast and unreal and
  undefined, like a cloud taking for the moment a likeness of humanity. With
  the brisk attack of one who wishes to escape the discussion of his guilt, the
  Doc rumbled while he waddled toward his desk-chair:</p>

  <p>"What you doing here, young fella? What you doing here? I knew the cat
  would drag in something if I left the door unlocked." He gulped slightly; he
  smiled to show that he was being humorous&mdash;people had been known to
  misconstrue the Doc's humor.</p>

  <p>He spoke more seriously, occasionally forgetting what he was talking
  about:</p>

  <p>"Reading old Gray? That's right. Physician's library just three books:
  'Gray's Anatomy' and Bible and Shakespeare. Study. You may become great
  doctor. Locate in Zenith and make five thousand dollars year&mdash;much as
  United States Senator! Set a high goal. Don't let things slide. Get training.
  Go college before go medical school. Study. Chemistry. Latin. Knowledge! I'm
  plug doc&mdash;got chick nor child&mdash;nobody&mdash;old drunk. But
  you&mdash;leadin' physician. Make five thousand dollars year.</p>

  <p>"Murray woman's got endocarditis. Not thing I can do for her. Wants
  somebody hold her hand. Road's damn' disgrace. Culvert's out, beyond the
  grove. 'Sgrace.</p>

  <p>"Endocarditis and&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Training, that's what you got t' get. Fundamentals. Know chemistry.
  Biology. I nev' did. Mrs. Reverend Jones thinks she's got gastric ulcer.
  Wants to go city for operation. Ulcer, hell! She and the Reverend both eat
  too much.</p>

  <p>"Why they don't repair that culvert&mdash;And don't be a booze-hoister
  like me, either. And get your basic science. I'll splain."</p>

  <p>The boy, normal village youngster though he was, given to stoning cats and
  to playing pom-pom-pullaway, gained something of the intoxication of
  treasure-hunting as the Doc struggled to convey his vision of the pride of
  learning, the universality of biology, the triumphant exactness of chemistry.
  A fat old man and dirty and unvirtuous was the Doc; his grammar was doubtful,
  his vocabulary alarming, and his references to his rival, good Dr. Needham,
  were scandalous; yet he invoked in Martin a vision of making chemicals
  explode with much noise and stink and of seeing animalcules that no boy in
  Elk Mills had ever beheld.</p>

  <p>The Doc's voice was thickening; he was sunk in his chair, blurry of eye
  and lax of mouth. Martin begged him to go to bed, but the Doc insisted:</p>

  <p>"Don't need nap. No. Now you lissen. You don't appreciate but&mdash;Old
  man now. Giving you all I've learned. Show you collection. Only museum in
  whole county. Scientif' pioneer."</p>

  <p>A hundred times had Martin obediently looked at the specimens in the
  brown, crackly-varnished bookcase: the beetles and chunks of mica; the embryo
  of a two-headed calf, the gallstones removed from a respectable lady whom the
  Doc enthusiastically named to all visitors. The Doc stood before the case,
  waving an enormous but shaky forefinger.</p>

  <p>"Looka that butterfly. Name is porthesia chrysorrhoea. Doc Needham
  couldn't tell you that! He don't know what butterflies are called! He don't
  care if you get trained. Remember that name now?" He turned on Martin. "You
  payin' attention? You interested? <i>Huh?</i> Oh, the devil! Nobody wants to
  know about my museum&mdash;not a person. Only one in county but&mdash;I'm an
  old failure."</p>

  <p>Martin asserted, "Honest, it's slick!"</p>

  <p>"Look here! Look here! See that? In the bottle? It's an appendix. First
  one ever took out 'round here. I did it! Old Doc Vickerson, he did the first
  'pendectomy in <i>this</i> neck of the woods, you bet! And first museum. It
  ain't&mdash;so big&mdash;but it's start. I haven't put away money like Doc
  Needham, but I started first c'lection&mdash;I started it!"</p>

  <p>He collapsed in a chair, groaning, "You're right. Got to sleep. All in."
  But as Martin helped him to his feet he broke away, scrabbled about on his
  desk, and looked back doubtfully. "Want to give you something&mdash;start
  your training. And remember the old man. Will anybody remember the old
  man?"</p>

  <p>He was holding out the beloved magnifying glass which for years he had
  used in botanizing. He watched Martin slip the lens into his pocket, he
  sighed, he struggled for something else to say, and silently he lumbered into
  his bedroom.</p>

     name="ch2">CHAPTER II.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">The state of Winnemac is bounded by Michigan, Ohio,
  Illinois, and Indiana, and like them it is half Eastern, half Midwestern.
  There is a feeling of New England in its brick and sycamore villages, its
  stable industries, and a tradition which goes back to the Revolutionary War.
  Zenith, the largest city in the state, was founded in 1792. But Winnemac is
  Midwestern in its fields of corn and wheat, its red barns and silos, and,
  despite the immense antiquity of Zenith, many counties were not settled till
  1860.</p>

  <p>The University of Winnemac is at Mohalis, fifteen miles from Zenith. There
  are twelve thousand students; beside this prodigy Oxford is a tiny
  theological school and Harvard a select college for young gentlemen. The
  University has a baseball field under glass; its buildings are measured by
  the mile; it hires hundreds of young Doctors of Philosophy to give rapid
  instruction in Sanskrit, navigation, accountancy, spectacle-fitting, sanitary
  engineering, Provencal poetry, tariff schedules, rutabaga-growing, motor-car
  designing, the history of Voronezh, the style of Matthew Arnold, the
  diagnosis of myohypertrophia kymoparalytica, and department-store
  advertising. Its president is the best money-raiser and the best after-dinner
  speaker in the United States; and Winnemac was the first school in the world
  to conduct its extension courses by radio.</p>

  <p>It is not a snobbish rich-man's college, devoted to leisurely nonsense. It
  is the property of the people of the state, and what they want&mdash;or what
  they are told they want&mdash;is a mill to turn out men and women who will
  lead moral lives, play bridge, drive good cars, be enterprising in business,
  and occasionally mention books, though they are not expected to have time to
  read them. It is a Ford Motor Factory, and if its products rattle a little,
  they are beautifully standardized, with perfectly interchangeable parts.
  Hourly the University of Winnemac grows in numbers and influence, and by 1950
  one may expect it to have created an entirely new world-civilization, a
  civilization larger and brisker and purer.</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">In 1904, when Martin Arrowsmith was an Arts and Science
  Junior preparing for medical school, Winnemac had but five thousand students
  yet it was already brisk.</p>

  <p>Martin was twenty-one. He still seemed pale, in contrast to his black
  smooth hair, but he was a respectable runner, a fair basket-ball center, and
  a savage hockey-player. The co-eds murmured that he "looked so romantic," but
  as this was before the invention of sex and the era of petting-parties, they
  merely talked about him at a distance, and he did not know that he could have
  been a hero of amours. For all his stubbornness he was shy. He was not
  entirely ignorant of caresses but he did not make an occupation of them. He
  consorted with men whose virile pride it was to smoke filthy corncob pipes
  and to wear filthy sweaters.</p>

  <p>The University had become his world. For him Elk Mills did not exist. Doc
  Vickerson was dead and buried and forgotten; Martin's father and mother were
  dead, leaving him only enough money for his arts and medical courses. The
  purpose of life was chemistry and physics and the prospect of biology next
  year.</p>

  <p>His idol was Professor Edward Edwards, head of the department of
  chemistry, who was universally known as "Encore." Edwards' knowledge of the
  history of chemistry was immense. He could read Arabic, and he infuriated his
  fellow chemists by asserting that the Arabs had anticipated all their
  researches. Himself, Professor Edwards never did researches. He sat before
  fires and stroked his collie and chuckled in his beard.</p>

  <p>This evening Encore was giving one of his small and popular At Home's. He
  lolled in a brown-corduroy Morris chair, being quietly humorous for the
  benefit of Martin and half a dozen other fanatical young chemists, and
  baiting Dr. Norman Brumfit, the instructor in English. The room was full of
  heartiness and beer and Brumfit.</p>

  <p>Every university faculty must have a Wild Man to provide thrills and to
  shock crowded lecture-rooms. Even in so energetically virtuous an institution
  as Winnemac there was one Wild Man, and he was Norman Brumfit. He was
  permitted, without restriction, to speak of himself as immoral, agnostic and
  socialistic, so long as it was universally known that he remained pure,
  Presbyterian, and Republican. Dr. Brumfit was in form, tonight. He asserted
  that whenever a man showed genius, it could be proved that he had Jewish
  blood. Like all discussions of Judaism at Winnemac, this led to the mention
  of Max Gottlieb, professor of bacteriology in the medical school.</p>

  <p>Professor Gottlieb was the mystery of the University. It was known that he
  was a Jew, born and educated in Germany, and that his work on immunology had
  given him fame in the East and in Europe. He rarely left his small brown
  weedy house except to return to his laboratory, and few students outside of
  his classes had ever identified him, but everyone had heard of his tall,
  lean, dark aloofness. A thousand fables fluttered about him. It was believed
  that he was the son of a German prince, that he had immense wealth, that he
  lived as sparsely as the other professors only because he was doing
  terrifying and costly experiments which probably had something to do with
  human sacrifice. It was said that he could create life in the laboratory,
  that he could talk to the monkeys which he inoculated, that he had been
  driven out of Germany as a devil-worshiper or an anarchist, and that he
  secretly drank real champagne every evening at dinner.</p>

  <p>It was the tradition that faculty-members did not discuss their colleagues
  with students, but Max Gottlieb could not be regarded as anybody's colleague.
  He was impersonal as the chill northeast wind. Dr. Brumfit rattled:</p>

  <p>"I'm sufficiently liberal, I should assume, toward the claims of science,
  but with a man like Gottlieb&mdash;I'm prepared to believe that he knows all
  about material forces, but what astounds me is that such a man can be blind
  to the vital force that creates all others. He says that knowledge is
  worthless unless it is proven by rows of figures. Well, when one of you
  scientific sharks can take the genius of a Ben Jonson and measure it with a
  yardstick, then I'll admit that we literary chaps, with our doubtless absurd
  belief in beauty and loyalty and the world o' dreams, are off on the wrong
  track!"</p>

  <p>Martin Arrowsmith was not exactly certain what this meant and he
  enthusiastically did not care. He was relieved when Professor Edwards from
  the midst of his beardedness and smokiness made a sound curiously like "Oh,
  hell!" and took the conversation away from Brumfit. Ordinarily Encore would
  have suggested, with amiable malice, that Gottlieb was a "crapehanger" who
  wasted time destroying the theories of other men instead of making new ones
  of his own. But tonight, in detestation of such literary playboys as Brumfit,
  he exalted Gottlieb's long, lonely, failure-burdened effort to synthesize
  antitoxin, and his diabolic pleasure in disproving his own contentions as he
  would those of Ehrlich or Sir Almroth Wright. He spoke of Gottlieb's great
  book, "Immunology," which had been read by seven-ninths of all the men in the
  world who could possibly understand it&mdash;the number of these being
  nine.</p>

  <p>The party ended with Mrs. Edwards' celebrated doughnuts. Martin tramped
  toward his boarding-house through a veiled spring night. The discussion of
  Gottlieb had roused him to a reasonless excitement. He thought of working in
  a laboratory at night, alone, absorbed, contemptuous of academic success and
  of popular classes. Himself, he believed, he had never seen the man, but he
  knew that Gottlieb's laboratory was in the Main Medical Building. He drifted
  toward the distant medical campus. The few people whom he met were hurrying
  with midnight timidity. He entered the shadow of the Anatomy Building, grim
  as a barracks, still as the dead men lying up there in the dissecting-room.
  Beyond him was the turreted bulk of the Main Medical Building, a harsh and
  blurry mass, high up in its dark wall a single light. He started. The light
  had gone out abruptly, as though an agitated watcher were trying to hide from
  him.</p>

  <p>On the stone steps of the Main Medical, two minutes after, appeared
  beneath the arc-light a tall figure, ascetic, self-contained, apart. His
  swart cheeks were gaunt, his nose high-bridged and thin. He did not hurry,
  like the belated home-bodies. He was unconscious of the world. He looked at
  Martin and through him; he moved away, muttering to himself, his shoulders
  stooped, his long hands clasped behind him. He was lost in the shadows,
  himself a shadow.</p>

  <p>He had worn the threadbare top-coat of a poor professor, yet Martin
  remembered him as wrapped in a black velvet cape with a silver star arrogant
  on his breast.</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">On his first day in medical school, Martin Arrowsmith was in
  a high state of superiority. As a medic he was more picturesque than other
  students, for medics are reputed to know secrets, horrors, exhilarating
  wickednesses. Men from the other departments go to their rooms to peer into
  their books. But also as an academic graduate, with a training in the basic
  sciences, he felt superior to his fellow medics, most of whom had but a
  high-school diploma, with perhaps one year in a ten-room Lutheran college
  among the cornfields.</p>

  <p>For all his pride, Martin was nervous. He thought of operating, of making
  a murderous wrong incision; and with a more immediate, macabre fear, he
  thought of the dissecting-room and the stony, steely Anatomy Building. He had
  heard older medics mutter of its horrors: of corpses hanging by hooks, like
  rows of ghastly fruit, in an abominable tank of brine in the dark basement;
  of Henry the janitor, who was said to haul the cadavers out of the brine, to
  inject red lead into their veins, and to scold them as he stuffed them on the
  dumb-waiter.</p>

  <p>There was prairie freshness in the autumn day but Martin did not heed. He
  hurried into the slate-colored hall of the Main Medical, up the wide stairs
  to the office of Max Gottlieb. He did not look at passing students, and when
  he bumped into them he grunted in confused apology. It was a portentous hour.
  He was going to specialize in bacteriology; he was going to discover
  enchanting new germs; Professor Gottlieb was going to recognize him as a
  genius, make him an assistant, predict for him&mdash;He halted in Gottlieb's
  private laboratory, a small, tidy apartment with racks of cotton-corked
  test-tubes on the bench, a place unimpressive and unmagical save for the
  constant-temperature bath with its tricky thermometer and electric bulbs. He
  waited till another student, a stuttering gawk of a student, had finished
  talking to Gottlieb, dark, lean, impassive at his desk in a cubbyhole of an
  office, then he plunged.</p>

  <p>If in the misty April night Gottlieb had been romantic as a cloaked
  horseman, he was now testy and middle-aged. Near at hand, Martin could see
  wrinkles beside the hawk eyes. Gottlieb had turned back to his desk, which
  was heaped with shabby note-books, sheets of calculations, and a marvelously
  precise chart with red and green curves descending to vanish at zero. The
  calculations were delicate, minute, exquisitely clear; and delicate were the
  scientist's thin hands among the papers. He looked up, spoke with a hint of
  German accent. His words were not so much mispronounced as colored with a
  warm unfamiliar tint.</p>

  <p>"Vell? Yes?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Professor Gottlieb, my name is Arrowsmith. I'm a medic freshman,
  Winnemac B.A. I'd like awfully to take bacteriology this fall instead of next
  year. I've had a lot of chemistry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No. It is not time for you."</p>

  <p>"Honest, I know I could do it now."</p>

  <p>"There are two kinds of students the gods give me. One kind they dump on
  me like a bushel of potatoes. I do not like potatoes, and the potatoes they
  do not ever seem to have great affection for me, but I take them and teach
  them to kill patients. The other kind&mdash;they are very few!&mdash;they
  seem for some reason that is not at all clear to me to wish a liddle bit to
  become scientists, to work with bugs and make mistakes. Those, ah, those, I
  seize them, I denounce them, I teach them right away the ultimate lesson of
  science, which is to wait and doubt. Of the potatoes, I demand nothing; of
  the foolish ones like you, who think I could teach them something, I demand
  everything. No. You are too young. Come back next year."</p>

  <p>"But honestly, with my chemistry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Have you taken physical chemistry?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, but I did pretty well in organic."</p>

  <p>"Organic chemistry! Puzzle chemistry! Stink chemistry! Drugstore
  chemistry! Physical chemistry is power, it is exactness, it is life. But
  organic chemistry&mdash;that is a trade for pot-washers. No. You are too
  young. Come back in a year."</p>

  <p>Gottlieb was absolute. His talon fingers waved Martin to the door, and the
  boy hastened out, not daring to argue. He slunk off in misery. On the campus
  he met that jovial historian of chemistry, Encore Edwards, and begged, "Say,
  Professor, tell me, is there any value for a doctor in organic
  chemistry?"</p>

  <p>"Value? Why, it seeks the drugs that allay pain! It produces the paint
  that slicks up your house, it dyes your sweetheart's dress&mdash;and maybe,
  in these degenerate days, her cherry lips! Who the dickens has been talking
  scandal about my organic chemistry?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody. I was just wondering," Martin complained, and he drifted to the
  College Inn where, in an injured and melancholy manner, he devoured an
  enormous banana-split and a bar of almond chocolate, as he meditated:</p>

  <p>"I want to take bacteriology. I want to get down to the bottom of this
  disease stuff. I'll learn some physical chemistry. I'll show old Gottlieb,
  damn him! Some day I'll discover the germ of cancer or something, and then
  he'll look foolish in the face!...Oh, Lord, I hope I won't take sick, first
  time I go into the dissecting-room...I want to take
  bacteriology&mdash;now!"</p>

  <p>He recalled Gottlieb's sardonic face; he felt and feared his quality of
  dynamic hatred. Then he remembered the wrinkles, and he saw Max Gottlieb not
  as a genius but as a man who had headaches, who became agonizingly tired, who
  could be loved.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if Encore Edwards knows as much as I thought he did? What
  <i>is</i> Truth?" he puzzled.</p><br>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">Martin was jumpy on his first day of dissecting. He could
  not look at the inhumanly stiff faces of the starveling gray men lying on the
  wooden tables. But they were so impersonal, these lost old men, that in two
  days he was, like the other medics, calling them "Billy" and "Ike" and "the
  Parson," and regarding them as he had regarded animals in biology. The
  dissecting-room itself was impersonal: hard cement floor, walls of hard
  plaster between wire-glass windows. Martin detested the reek of formaldehyde;
  that and some dreadful subtle other odor seemed to cling about him outside
  the dissecting-room; but he smoked cigarettes to forget it, and in a week he
  was exploring arteries with youthful and altogether unholy joy.</p>

  <p>His dissecting partner was the Reverend Ira Hinkley, known to the class by
  a similar but different name.</p>

  <p>Ira was going to be a medical missionary. He was a man of twenty-nine, a
  graduate of Pottsburg Christian College and of the Sanctification Bible and
  Missions School. He had played football; he was as strong and nearly as large
  as a steer, and no steer ever bellowed more enormously. He was a bright and
  happy Christian, a romping optimist who laughed away sin and doubt, a joyful
  Puritan who with annoying virility preached the doctrine of his tiny sect,
  the Sanctification Brotherhood, that to have a beautiful church was almost as
  damnable as the debaucheries of card-playing.</p>

  <p>Martin found himself viewing "Billy," their cadaver&mdash;an undersized,
  blotchy old man with a horrible little red beard on his petrified, vealy
  face&mdash;as a machine, fascinating, complex, beautiful, but a machine. It
  damaged his already feeble belief in man's divinity and immortality. He might
  have kept his doubts to himself, revolving them slowly as he dissected out
  the nerves of the mangled upper arm, but Ira Hinkley would not let him alone.
  Ira believed that he could bring even medical students to bliss, which, to
  Ira, meant singing extraordinarily long and unlovely hymns in a chapel of the
  Sanctification Brotherhood.</p>

  <p>"Mart, my son," he roared, "do you realize that in this, what some might
  call a sordid task, we are learning things that will enable us to heal the
  bodies and comfort the souls of countless lost unhappy folks?"</p>

  <p>"Huh! Souls. I haven't found one yet in old Billy. Honest, do you believe
  that junk?"</p>

  <p>Ira clenched his fist and scowled, then belched with laughter, slapped
  Martin distressingly on the back, and clamored, "Brother, you've got to do
  better than that to get Ira's goat! You think you've got a lot of these fancy
  Modern Doubts. You haven't&mdash;you've only got indigestion. What you need
  is exercise and faith. Come on over to the Y.M.C.A. and I'll take you for a
  swim and pray with you. Why, you poor skinny little agnostic, here you have a
  chance to see the Almighty's handiwork, and all you grab out of it is a
  feeling that you're real smart. Buck up, young Arrowsmith. You don't know how
  funny you are, to a fellow that's got a serene faith!"</p>

  <p>To the delight of Clif Clawson, the class jester, who worked at the next
  table, Ira chucked Martin in the ribs, patted him, very painfully, upon the
  head, and amiably resumed work, while Martin danced with irritation.</p><br>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="first">In college Martin had been a "barb"&mdash;he had not
  belonged to a Greek Letter secret society. He had been "rushed," but he had
  resented the condescension of the aristocracy of men from the larger cities.
  Now that most of his Arts classmates had departed to insurance offices, law
  schools, and banks, he was lonely, and tempted by an invitation from Digamma
  Pi, the chief medical fraternity.</p>

  <p>Digamma Pi was a lively boarding-house with a billiard table and low
  prices. Rough and amiable noises came from it at night, and a good deal of
  singing about When I Die Don't Bury Me at All; yet for three years Digams had
  won the valedictory and the Hugh Loizeau Medal in Experimental Surgery. This
  autumn the Digams elected Ira Hinkley, because they had been gaining a
  reputation for dissipation&mdash;girls were said to have been smuggled in
  late at night&mdash;and no company which included the Reverend Mr. Hinkley
  could possibly be taken by the Dean as immoral, which was an advantage if
  they were to continue comfortably immoral.</p>

  <p>Martin had prized the independence of his solitary room. In a fraternity,
  all tennis rackets, trousers, and opinions are held in common. When Ira found
  that Martin was hesitating, he insisted, "Oh, come on in! Digam needs you.
  You do study hard&mdash;I'll say that for you&mdash;and think what a chance
  you'll have to influence The Fellows for good."</p>

  <p>(On all occasions, Ira referred to his classmates as The Fellows, and
  frequently he used the term in prayers at the Y.M.C.A.)</p>

  <p>"I don't want to influence anybody. I want to learn the doctor trade and
  make six thousand dollars a year."</p>

  <p>"My boy, if you only knew how foolish you sound when you try to be
  cynical! When you're as old as I am, you'll understand that the glory of
  being a doctor is that you can teach folks high ideals while you soothe their
  tortured bodies."</p>

  <p>"Suppose they don't want my particular brand of high ideals?"</p>

  <p>"Mart, have I got to stop and pray with you?"</p>

  <p>"No! Quit! Honestly, Hinkley, of all the Christians I ever met you take
  the rottenest advantages. You can lick anybody in the class, and when I think
  of how you're going to bully the poor heathen when you get to be a
  missionary, and make the kids put on breeches, and marry off all the happy
  lovers to the wrong people, I could bawl!"</p>

  <p>The prospect of leaving his sheltered den for the patronage of the
  Reverend Mr. Hinkley was intolerable. It was not till Angus Duer accepted
  election to Digamma Pi that Martin himself came in.</p>

  <p>Duer was one of the few among Martin's classmates in the academic course
  who had gone on with him to the Winnemac medical school. Duer had been the
  valedictorian. He was a silent, sharp-faced, curly-headed, rather handsome
  young man, and he never squandered an hour or a good impulse. So brilliant
  was his work in biology and chemistry that a Chicago surgeon had promised him
  a place in his clinic. Martin compared Angus Duer to a razor blade on a
  January morning; he hated him, was uncomfortable with him, and envied him. He
  knew that in biology Duer had been too busy passing examinations to ponder,
  to get any concept of biology as a whole. He knew that Duer was a tricky
  chemist, who neatly and swiftly completed the experiments demanded by the
  course and never ventured on original experiments which, leading him into a
  confused land of wondering, might bring him to glory or disaster. He was sure
  that Duer cultivated his manner of chill efficiency to impress instructors.
  Yet the man stood out so bleakly from a mass of students who could neither
  complete their experiments nor ponder nor do anything save smoke pipes and
  watch football-practice that Martin loved him while he hated him, and almost
  meekly he followed him into Digamma Pi.</p>

  <p>Martin, Ira Hinkley, Angus Duer, Clif Clawson, the meaty class jester, and
  one "Fatty" Pfaff were initiated into Digamma Pi together. It was a noisy and
  rather painful performance, which included smelling asafetida. Martin was
  bored, but Fatty Pfaff was in squeaking, billowing, gasping terror.</p>

  <p>Fatty was of all the new Freshmen candidates the most useful to Digamma
  Pi. He was planned by nature to be a butt. He looked like a distended
  hot-water bottle; he was magnificently imbecile; he believed everything, he
  knew nothing, he could memorize nothing; and anxiously he forgave the men who
  got through the vacant hours by playing jokes upon him. They persuaded him
  that mustard plasters were excellent for colds&mdash;solicitously they
  gathered about him, affixed an enormous plaster to his back, and afterward
  fondly removed it. They concealed the ear of a cadaver in his nice, clean,
  new pocket handkerchief when he went to Sunday supper at the house of a girl
  cousin in Zenith...At supper he produced the handkerchief with a
  flourish.</p>

  <p>Every night when Fatty retired he had to remove from his bed a collection
  of objects which thoughtful house-mates had stuffed between the
  sheets&mdash;soap, alarm clocks, fish. He was the perfect person to whom to
  sell useless things. Clif Clawson, who combined a brisk huckstering with his
  jokes, sold to Fatty for four dollars a History of Medicine which he had
  bought, second-hand, for two, and while Fatty never read it, never
  conceivably could read it, the possession of the fat red book made him feel
  learned. But Fatty's greatest beneficence to Digamma was his belief in
  spiritualism. He went about in terror of spooks. He was always seeing them
  emerging at night from the dissecting-room windows. His classmates took care
  that he should behold a great many of them flitting about the halls of the
  fraternity.</p><br>

  <h3>VI.</h3>

  <p class="first">Digamma Pi was housed in a residence built in the expansive
  days of 1885. The living-room suggested a recent cyclone. Knife-gashed
  tables, broken Morris chairs, and torn rugs were flung about the room, and
  covered with backless books, hockey shoes, caps, and cigarette stubs. Above,
  there were four men to a bedroom, and the beds were iron double-deckers, like
  a steerage.</p>

  <p>For ash-trays the Digams used sawed skulls, and on the bedroom walls were
  anatomical charts, to be studied while dressing. In Martin's room was a
  complete skeleton. He and his roommates had trustingly bought it from a
  salesman who came out from a Zenith surgical supply house. He was such a
  genial and sympathetic salesman; he gave them cigars and told G. U. stories
  and explained what prosperous doctors they were all going to be. They bought
  the skeleton gratefully, on the installment plan...Later the salesman was
  less genial.</p>

  <p>Martin roomed with Clif Clawson, Fatty Pfaff, and an earnest second-year
  medic named Irving Watters.</p>

  <p>Any psychologist desiring a perfectly normal man for use in demonstrations
  could not have done better than to have engaged Irving Watters. He was always
  and carefully dull; smilingly, easily, dependably dull. If there was any
  cliche which he did not use, it was because he had not yet heard it. He
  believed in morality&mdash;except on Saturday evenings; he believed in the
  Episcopal Church&mdash;but not the High Church; he believed in the
  Constitution, Darwinism, systematic exercise in the gymnasium, and the genius
  of the president of the university.</p>

  <p>Among them, Martin most liked Clif Clawson. Clif was the clown of the
  fraternity house, he was given to raucous laughter, he clogged and sang
  meaningless songs, he even practiced on the cornet, yet he was somehow a good
  fellow and solid, and Martin, in his detestation of Ira Hinkley, his fear of
  Angus Duer, his pity for Fatty Pfaff, his distaste for the amiable dullness
  of Irving Watters, turned to the roaring Clif as to something living and
  experimenting. At least Clif had reality; the reality of a plowed field, of a
  steaming manure-pile. It was Clif who would box with him; Clif
  who&mdash;though he loved to sit for hours smoking, grunting, magnificently
  loafing&mdash;could be persuaded to go for a five-mile walk.</p>

  <p>And it was Clif who risked death by throwing baked beans at the Reverend
  Ira Hinkley at supper, when Ira was bulkily and sweetly corrective.</p>

  <p>In the dissecting-room Ira was maddening enough with his merriment at such
  of Martin's ideas as had not been accepted in Pottsburg Christian College,
  but in the fraternity-house he was a moral pest. He never ceased trying to
  stop their profanity. After three years on a backwoods football team he still
  believed with unflinching optimism that he could sterilize young men by
  administering reproofs, with the nickering of a lady Sunday School teacher
  and the delicacy of a charging elephant.</p>

  <p>Ira also had statistics about Clean Living.</p>

  <p>He was full of statistics. Where he got them did not matter to him;
  figures in the daily papers, in the census report, or in the Miscellany
  Column of the Sanctification Herald were equally valid. He announced at
  supper table, "Clif, it's a wonder to me how as bright a fella as you can go
  on sucking that dirty old pipe. D'you realize that 67.9 per cent of all women
  who go to the operating table have husbands who smoke tobacco?"</p>

  <p>"What the devil would they smoke?" demanded Clif.</p>

  <p>"Where'd you get those figures?" from Martin.</p>

  <p>"They came out at a medical convention in Philadelphia in 1902," Ira
  condescended. "Of course I don't suppose it'll make any difference to a bunch
  of wise galoots like you that some day you'll marry a nice bright little
  woman and ruin her life with your vices. Sure, keep right on&mdash;fine brave
  virile bunch! A poor weakling preacher like me wouldn't dare do anything so
  brave as smoke a pipe!"</p>

  <p>He left them triumphantly, and Martin groaned, "Ira makes me want to get
  out of medicine and be an honest harness maker."</p>

  <p>"Aw, gee now, Mart," Fatty Pfaff complained, "you oughtn't to cuss Ira
  out. He's awful sincere."</p>

  <p>"Sincere? Hell! So is a cockroach!"</p>

  <p>Thus they jabbered, while Angus Duer watched them in a superior silence
  that made Martin nervous. In the study of the profession to which he had
  looked forward all his life he found irritation and vacuity as well as serene
  wisdom; he saw no one clear path to Truth but a thousand paths to a thousand
  truths far-off and doubtful.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3">CHAPTER III.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">John A. Robertshaw, John Aldington Robertshaw, professor of
  physiology in the medical school, was rather deaf, and he was the only
  teacher in the University of Winnemac who still wore mutton-chop whiskers. He
  came from Back Bay; he was proud of it and let you know about it. With three
  other Brahmins he formed in Mohalis a Boston colony which stood for sturdy
  sweetness and decorously shaded light. On all occasions he remarked, "When I
  was studying with Ludwig in Germany&mdash;" He was too absorbed in his own
  correctness to heed individual students, and Clif Clawson and the other young
  men technically known as "hell-raisers" looked forward to his lectures on
  physiology.</p>

  <p>They were held in an amphitheater whose seats curved so far around that
  the lecturer could not see both ends at once, and while Dr. Robertshaw,
  continuing to drone about blood circulation, was peering to the right to find
  out who was making that outrageous sound like a motor horn, far over on the
  left Clif Clawson would rise and imitate him, with sawing arm and stroking of
  imaginary whiskers. Once Clif produced the masterpiece of throwing a brick
  into the sink beside the platform, just when Dr. Robertshaw was working up to
  his annual climax about the effects of brass bands on the intensity of the
  knee-jerk.</p>

  <p>Martin had been reading Max Gottlieb's scientific papers&mdash;as much of
  them as he could read, with their morass of mathematical symbols&mdash;and
  from them he had a conviction that experiments should be something dealing
  with the foundations of life and death, with the nature of bacterial
  infection, with the chemistry of bodily reactions. When Robertshaw chirped
  about fussy little experiments, standard experiments, maiden-aunt
  experiments, Martin was restless. In college he had felt that prosody and
  Latin Composition were futile, and he had looked forward to the study of
  medicine as illumination. Now, in melancholy worry about his own
  unreasonableness, he found that he was developing the same contempt for
  Robertshaw's rules of the thumb&mdash;and for most of the work in
  anatomy.</p>

  <p>The professor of anatomy, Dr. Oliver O. Stout, was himself an anatomy, a
  dissection-chart, a thinly covered knot of nerves and blood vessels and
  bones. Stout had precise and enormous knowledge; in his dry voice he could
  repeat more facts about the left little toe than you would have thought
  anybody would care to learn regarding the left little toe.</p>

  <p>No discussion at the Digamma Pi supper table was more violent than the
  incessant debate over the value to a doctor, a decent normal doctor who made
  a good living and did not worry about reading papers at medical associations,
  of remembering anatomical terms. But no matter what they thought, they all
  ground at learning the lists of names which enable a man to crawl through
  examinations and become an Educated Person, with a market value of five
  dollars an hour. Unknown sages had invented rimes which enabled them to
  memorize. At supper&mdash;the thirty piratical Digams sitting at a long and
  spotty table, devouring clam chowder and beans and codfish balls and banana
  layer-cake&mdash;the Freshmen earnestly repeated after a senior:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">On old Olympus' topmost top<br>
  A fat-eared German viewed a hop.</p><br>

  <p>Thus by association with the initial letters they mastered the twelve
  cranial nerves: olfactory, optic, oculomotor, trochlear, and the rest. To the
  Digams it was the world's noblest poem, and they remembered it for years
  after they had become practicing physicians and altogether forgotten the
  names of the nerves themselves.</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">In Dr. Stout's anatomy lectures there were no disturbances,
  but in his dissecting-room were many pleasantries. The mildest of them was
  the insertion of a fire-cracker in the cadaver on which the two virginal and
  unhappy co-eds worked. The real excitement during Freshman year was the
  incident of Clif Clawson and the pancreas.</p>

  <p>Clif had been elected class president, for the year, because he was so
  full of greetings. He never met a classmate in the hall of Main Medical
  without shouting, "How's your vermiform appendix functioning this morning?"
  or "I bid thee a lofty greeting, old pediculosis." With booming decorum he
  presided at class meetings (indignant meetings to denounce the proposal to
  let the "aggies" use the North Side Tennis Courts), but in private life he
  was less decorous.</p>

  <p>The terrible thing happened when the Board of Regents were being shown
  through the campus. The Regents were the supreme rulers of the University;
  they were bankers and manufacturers and pastors of large churches; to them
  even the president was humble. Nothing gave them more interesting thrills
  than the dissecting-room of the medical school. The preachers spoke morally
  of the effect of alcohol on paupers, and the bankers of the disrespect for
  savings-accounts which is always to be seen in the kind of men who insist on
  becoming cadavers. In the midst of the tour, led by Dr. Stout and the
  umbrella-carrying secretary of the University, the plumpest and most
  educational of all the bankers stopped near Clif Clawson's dissecting-table,
  with his derby hat reverently held behind him, and into that hat Clif dropped
  a pancreas.</p>

  <p>Now a pancreas is a damp and disgusting thing to find in your new hat, and
  when the banker did so find one, he threw down the hat and said that the
  students of Winnemac had gone to the devil. Dr. Stout and the secretary
  comforted him; they cleaned the derby and assured him that vengeance should
  be done on the man who could put a pancreas in a banker's hat.</p>

  <p>Dr. Stout summoned Clif, as president of the Freshmen. Clif was pained. He
  assembled the class, he lamented that any Winnemac Man could place a pancreas
  in a banker's hat, and he demanded that the criminal be manly enough to stand
  up and confess.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately the Reverend Ira Hinkley, who sat between Martin and Angus
  Duer, had seen Clif drop the pancreas. He growled, "This is outrageous! I'm
  going to expose Clawson, even if he is a frat-brother of mine."</p>

  <p>Martin protested, "Cut it out. You don't want to get him fired?"</p>

  <p>"He ought to be!"</p>

  <p>Angus Duer turned in his seat, looked at Ira, and suggested, "Will you
  kindly shut up?" and, as Ira subsided, Angus became to Martin more admirable
  and more hateful than ever.</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">When he was depressed by a wonder as to why he was here,
  listening to a Professor Robertshaw, repeating verses about fat-eared
  Germans, learning the trade of medicine like Fatty Pfaff or Irving Watters,
  then Martin had relief in what he considered debauches. Actually they were
  extremely small debauches; they rarely went beyond too much lager in the
  adjacent city of Zenith, or the smiles of a factory girl parading the sordid
  back avenues, but to Martin, with his pride in taut strength, his joy in a
  clear brain, they afterward seemed tragic.</p>

  <p>His safest companion was Clif Clawson. No matter how much bad beer he
  drank, Clif was never much more intoxicated than in his normal state. Martin
  sank or rose to Clif's buoyancy, while Clif rose or sank to Martin's
  speculativeness. As they sat in a back-room, at a table glistening with
  beer-glass rings, Clif shook his finger and babbled, "You're only one 'at
  gets me, Mart. You know with all the hell-raising, and all the talk about
  bein' c'mmercial that I pull on these high boys like Ira Stinkley, I'm jus'
  sick o' c'mmercialism an' bunk as you are."</p>

  <p>"Sure. You bet," Martin agreed with alcoholic fondness. "You're jus' like
  me. My God, do you get it&mdash;dough-face like Irving Watters or heartless
  climber like Angus Duer, and then old Gottlieb! Ideal of research! Never
  bein' content with what <i>seems</i> true! Alone, not carin' a damn,
  square-toed as a captain on the bridge, working all night, getting to the
  bottom of things!"</p>

  <p>"Thash stuff. That's my idee, too. Lez have 'nother beer. Shake you for
  it!" observed Clif Clawson.</p>

  <p>Zenith, with its saloons, was fifteen miles from Mohalis and the
  University of Winnemac; half an hour by the huge, roaring, steel interurban
  trolleys, and to Zenith the medical students went for their forays. To say
  that one had "gone into town last night" was a matter for winks and leers.
  But with Angus Duer, Martin discovered a new Zenith.</p>

  <p>At supper Duer said abruptly, "Come into town with me and hear a
  concert."</p>

  <p>For all his fancied superiority to the class, Martin was illimitably
  ignorant of literature, of painting, of music. That the bloodless and
  acquisitive Angus Duer should waste time listening to fiddlers was astounding
  to him. He discovered that Duer had enthusiasm for two composers, called Bach
  and Beethoven, presumably Germans, and that he himself did not yet comprehend
  all the ways of the world. On the interurban, Duer's gravity loosened, and he
  cried, "Boy, if I hadn't been born to carve up innards, I'd have been a great
  musician! Tonight I'm going to lead you right into Heaven!"</p>

  <p>Martin found himself in a confusion of little chairs and vast gilded
  arches, of polite but disapproving ladies with programs in their laps,
  unromantic musicians making unpleasant noises below and, at last,
  incomprehensible beauty, which made for him pictures of hills and deep
  forests, then suddenly became achingly long-winded. He exulted, "I'm going to
  have 'em all&mdash;the fame of Max Gottlieb&mdash;I mean his
  ability&mdash;and the lovely music and lovely women&mdash;Golly! I'm going to
  do big things. And see the world...Will this piece never quit?"</p><br>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">It was a week after the concert that he rediscovered
  Madeline Fox.</p>

  <p>Madeline was a handsome, high-colored, high-spirited, opinionated girl
  whom Martin had known in college. She was staying on, ostensibly to take a
  graduate course in English, actually to avoid going back home. She considered
  herself a superb tennis player; she played it with energy and voluble
  swoopings and large lack of direction. She believed herself to be a
  connoisseur of literature; the fortunates to whom she gave her approval were
  Hardy, Meredith, Howells, and Thackeray, none of whom she had read for five
  years. She had often reproved Martin for his inappreciation of Howells, for
  wearing flannel shirts, and for his failure to hand her down from street-cars
  in the manner of a fiction hero. In college, they had gone to dances
  together, though as a dancer Martin was more spirited than accurate, and his
  partners sometimes had difficulty in deciding just what he was trying to
  dance. He liked Madeline's tall comeliness and her vigor; he felt that with
  her energetic culture she was somehow "good for him." During this year, he
  had scarcely seen her. He thought of her late in the evenings, and planned to
  telephone to her, and did not telephone. But as he became doubtful about
  medicine he longed for her sympathy, and on a Sunday afternoon of spring he
  took her for a walk along the Chaloosa River.</p>

  <p>From the river bluffs the prairie stretches in exuberant rolling hills. In
  the long barley fields, the rough pastures, the stunted oaks and brilliant
  birches, there is the adventurousness of the frontier, and like young
  plainsmen they tramped the bluffs and told each other they were going to
  conquer the world.</p>

  <p>He complained, "These damn' medics&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Martin, do you think 'damn' is a nice word?" said Madeline.</p>

  <p>He did think it was a very nice word indeed, and constantly useful to a
  busy worker, but her smile was desirable.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;these darn' studes, they aren't trying to learn science;
  they're simply learning a trade. They just want to get the knowledge that'll
  enable them to cash in. They don't talk about saving lives but about 'losing
  cases'&mdash;losing dollars! And they wouldn't even mind losing cases if it
  was a sensational operation that'd advertise 'em! They make me sick! How many
  of 'em do you find that're interested in the work Ehrlich is doing in
  Germany&mdash;yes, or that Max Gottlieb is doing right here and now!
  Gottlieb's just taken an awful fall out of Wright's opsonin theory."</p>

  <p>"Has he, really?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Has</i> he! I should say he had! And do you get any of the medics
  stirred up about it? You do not! They say, 'Oh, sure, science is all right in
  its way; helps a doc to treat his patients,' and then they begin to argue
  about whether they can make more money if they locate in a big city or a
  town, and is it better for a young doc to play the good-fellow and lodge
  game, or join the church and look earnest. You ought to hear Irve Watters.
  He's just got one idea: the fellow that gets ahead in medicine, is he the lad
  that knows his pathology? Oh, no; the bird that succeeds is the one that gets
  an office on a northeast corner, near a trolley car junction, with a 'phone
  number that'll be easy for patients to remember! Honest! He said so! I swear,
  when I graduate I believe I'll be a ship's doctor. You see the world that
  way, and at least you aren't racing up and down the boat trying to drag
  patients away from some rival doc that has an office on another deck!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know; it's dreadful the way people don't have ideals about their
  work. So many of the English grad students just want to make money teaching,
  instead of enjoying scholarship the way I do."</p>

  <p>It was disconcerting to Martin that she should seem to think that she was
  a superior person quite as much as himself, but he was even more disconcerted
  when she bubbled:</p>

  <p>"At the same time, Martin, one does have to be practical, doesn't one!
  Think how much more money&mdash;no, I mean how much more social position and
  power for doing good a successful doctor has than one of these scientists
  that just putter, and don't know what's going on in the world. Look at a
  surgeon like Dr. Loizeau, riding up to the hospital in a lovely car with a
  chauffeur in uniform, and all his patients simply worshiping him, and then
  your Max Gottlieb&mdash;somebody pointed him out to me the other day, and he
  had on a dreadful old suit, and I certainly thought he could stand a
  hair-cut."</p>

  <p>Martin turned on her with fury, statistics, vituperation, religious zeal,
  and confused metaphors. They sat on a crooked old-fashioned rail-fence where
  over the sun-soaked bright plantains the first insects of spring were
  humming. In the storm of his fanaticism she lost her airy Culture and
  squeaked, "Yes, I see now, I see," without stating what it was she saw. "Oh,
  you do have a fine mind and such fine&mdash;such integrity."</p>

  <p>"Honest? Do you think I have?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed I do, and I'm sure you're going to have a wonderful future.
  And I'm so glad you aren't commercial, like the others. Don't mind what they
  say!"</p>

  <p>He noted that Madeline was not only a rare and understanding spirit but
  also an extraordinarily desirable woman&mdash;fresh color, tender eyes,
  adorable slope from shoulder to side. As they walked back, he perceived that
  she was incredibly the right mate for him. Under his training she would learn
  the distinction between vague "ideals" and the hard sureness of science. They
  paused on the bluff, looking down at the muddy Chaloosa, a springtime Western
  river wild with floating branches. He yearned for her; he regretted the
  casual affairs of a student and determined to be a pure and extremely
  industrious young man, to be, in fact, "worthy of her."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Madeline," he mourned, "you're so darn' lovely!"</p>

  <p>She glanced at him, timidly.</p>

  <p>He caught her hand; in a desperate burst he tried to kiss her. It was very
  badly done. He managed only to kiss the point of her jaw, while she struggled
  and begged, "Oh, don't!" They did not acknowledge, as they ambled back into
  Mohalis, that the incident had occurred, but there was softness in their
  voices and without impatience now she heard his denunciation of Professor
  Robertshaw as a phonograph, and he listened to her remarks on the shallowness
  and vulgarity of Dr. Norman Brumfit, that sprightly English instructor. At
  her boarding-house she sighed, "I wish I could ask you to come in, but it's
  almost suppertime and&mdash;Will you call me up some day?"</p>

  <p>"You bet I will!" said Martin, according to the rules for amorous
  discourse in the University of Winnemac.</p>

  <p>He raced home in adoration. As he lay in his narrow upper bunk at
  midnight, he saw her eyes, now impertinent, now reproving, now warm with
  trust in him. "I love her! I <i>love</i> her! I'll 'phone her&mdash;Wonder if
  I dare call her up as early as eight in the morning?"</p>

  <p>But at eight he was too busy studying the lacrimal apparatus to think of
  ladies' eyes. He saw Madeline only once, and in the publicity of her
  boarding-house porch, crowded with coeds, red cushions, and marshmallows,
  before he was hurled into hectic studying for the year's final
  examinations.</p><br>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="first">At examination-time, Digamma Pi fraternity showed its value
  to urgent seekers after wisdom. Generations of Digams had collected
  test-papers and preserved them in the sacred Quiz Book; geniuses for detail
  had labored through the volume and marked with red pencil the problems most
  often set in the course of years. The Freshmen crouched in a ring about Ira
  Hinkley in the Digam living-room, while he read out the questions they were
  most likely to get. They writhed, clawed their hair, scratched their chins,
  bit their fingers, and beat their temples in the endeavor to give the right
  answer before Angus Duer should read it to them out of the textbook.</p>

  <p>In the midst of their sufferings they had to labor with Fatty Pfaff.</p>

  <p>Fatty had failed in the mid-year anatomical, and he had to pass a special
  quiz before he could take the finals. There was a certain fondness for him in
  Digamma Pi; Fatty was soft, Fatty was superstitious, Fatty was an imbecile,
  yet they had for him the annoyed affection they might have had for a
  second-hand motor or a muddy dog. All of them worked on him; they tried to
  lift him and thrust him through the examination as through a trap-door. They
  panted and grunted and moaned at the labor, and Fatty panted and moaned with
  them.</p>

  <p>The night before his special examination they kept him at it till two,
  with wet towels, black coffee, prayer, and profanity. They repeated
  lists&mdash;lists&mdash;lists to him; they shook their fists in his mournful
  red round face and howled, "Damn you, <i>will</i> you remember that the
  bicuspid valve is the <i>same</i> as the mitral valve and <i>not</i> another
  one?" They ran about the room, holding up their hands and wailing, "Won't he
  never remember nothing about nothing?" and charged back to purr with fictive
  calm, "Now no use getting fussed, Fatty. Take it easy. Just listen to this,
  quietly, will yuh, and try," coaxingly, "do try to remember <i>one</i> thing,
  anyway!"</p>

  <p>They led him carefully to bed. He was so filled with facts that the
  slightest jostling would have spilled them.</p>

  <p>When he awoke at seven, with red eyes and trembling lips, he had forgotten
  everything he had learned.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing for it," said the president of Digamma Pi. "He's got to
  have a crib, and take his chance on getting caught with it. I thought so. I
  made one out for him yesterday. It's a lulu. It'll cover enough of the
  questions so he'll get through."</p>

  <p>Even the Reverend Ira Hinkley, since he had witnessed the horrors of the
  midnight before, went his ways ignoring the crime. It was Fatty himself who
  protested: "Gee, I don't like to cheat. I don't think a fellow that can't get
  through an examination had hardly ought to be allowed to practice medicine.
  That's what my Dad said."</p>

  <p>They poured more coffee into him and (on the advice of Clif Clawson, who
  wasn't exactly sure what the effect might be but who was willing to learn)
  they fed him a potassium bromide tablet. The president of Digamma, seizing
  Fatty with some firmness, growled, "I'm going to stick this crib in your
  pocket&mdash;look, here in your breast pocket, behind your handkerchief."</p>

  <p>"I won't use it. I don't care if I fail," whimpered Fatty.</p>

  <p>"That's all right, but you keep it there. Maybe you can absorb a little
  information from it through your lungs, for God knows&mdash;" The president
  clenched his hair. His voice rose, and in it was all the tragedy of night
  watches and black draughts and hopeless retreats. "&mdash;God knows you can't
  take it in through your head!"</p>

  <p>They dusted Fatty, they stood him right side up, and pushed him through
  the door, on his way to Anatomy Building. They watched him go: a balloon on
  legs, a sausage in corduroy trousers.</p>

  <p>"Is it possible he's going to be honest?" marveled Clif Clawson.</p>

  <p>"Well, if he is, we better go up and begin packing his trunk. And this ole
  frat'll never have another goat like Fatty," grieved the president.</p>

  <p>They saw Fatty stop, remove his handkerchief, mournfully blow his
  nose&mdash;and discover a long thin slip of paper. They saw him frown at it,
  tap it on his knuckles, begin to read it, stuff it back into his pocket, and
  go on with a more resolute step.</p>

  <p>They danced hand in hand about the living-room of the fraternity, piously
  assuring one another, "He'll use it&mdash;it's all right&mdash;he'll get
  through or get hanged!"</p>

  <p>He got through.</p><br>

  <h3>VI.</h3>

  <p class="first">Digamma Pi was more annoyed by Martin's restless doubtings
  than by Fatty's idiocy, Clif Clawson's raucousness, Angus Duer's rasping, or
  the Reverend Ira Hinkley's nagging.</p>

  <p>During the strain of study for examinations Martin was peculiarly vexing
  in regard to "laying in the best quality medical terms like the best quality
  sterilizers&mdash;not for use but to impress your patients." As one, the
  Digams suggested, "Say, if you don't like the way we study medicine, we'll be
  tickled to death to take up a collection and send you back to Elk Mills,
  where you won't be disturbed by all us lowbrows and commercialists. Look
  here! We don't tell you how you ought to work. Where do you get the idea you
  got to tell us? Oh, turn it off, will you!"</p>

  <p>Angus Duer observed, with sour sweetness, "We'll admit we're simply
  carpenters, and you're a great investigator. But there's several things you
  might turn to when you finish science. What do you know about architecture?
  How's your French verbs? How many big novels have you ever read? Who's the
  premier of Austro-Hungary?"</p>

  <p>Martin struggled, "I don't pretend to know anything&mdash;except I do know
  what a man like Max Gottlieb means. He's got the right method, and all these
  other hams of profs, they're simply witch doctors. You think Gottlieb isn't
  religious, Hinkley. Why, his just being in a lab is a prayer. Don't you
  idiots realize what it means to have a man like that here, making new
  concepts of life? Don't you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Clif Clawson, with a chasm of yawning, speculated, "Praying in the lab!
  I'll bet I get the pants took off me, when I take bacteriology, if Pa
  Gottlieb catches me praying during experiment hours!"</p>

  <p>"Damn it, listen!" Martin wailed. "I tell you, you fellows are the kind
  that keep medicine nothing but guess-work diagnosis, and here you have a
  man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>So they argued for hours, after their sweaty fact-grinding.</p>

  <p>When the others had gone to bed, when the room was a muck-heap of flung
  clothing and weary young men snoring in iron bunks, Martin sat at the
  splintery long pine study-table, worrying. Angus Duer glided in, demanding,
  "Look here, old son. We're all sick of your crabbing. If you think medicine
  is rot, the way we study it, and if you're so confoundedly honest, why don't
  you get out?"</p>

  <p>He left Martin to agonize, "He's right. I've got to shut up or get out. Do
  I really mean it? What <i>do</i> I want? What <i>am</i> I going to
  do?"</p><br>

  <h3>VII.</h3>

  <p class="first">Angus Duer's studiousness and his reverence for correct
  manners were alike offended by Clif's bawdy singing, Clif's howling
  conversation, Clif's fondness for dropping things in people's soup, and
  Clif's melancholy inability to keep his hands washed. For all his appearance
  of nerveless steadiness, during the tension of examination-time Duer was as
  nervous as Martin, and one evening at supper, when Clif was bellowing, Duer
  snapped, "Will you kindly not make so much racket?"</p>

  <p>"I'll make all the damn' racket I damn' please!" Clif asserted, and a feud
  was on.</p>

  <p>Clif was so noisy thereafter that he almost became tired of his own noise.
  He was noisy in the living-room, he was noisy in the bath, and with some
  sacrifice he lay awake pretending to snore. If Duer was quiet and
  book-wrapped, he was not in the least timid; he faced Clif with the eye of a
  magistrate, and cowed him. Privily Clif complained to Martin, "Darn him, he
  acts like I was a worm. Either he or me has got to get out of Digam, that's a
  cinch, and it won't be me!"</p>

  <p>He was ferocious and very noisy about it, and it was he who got out. He
  said that the Digams were a "bunch of bum sports; don't even have a decent
  game of poker," but he was fleeing from the hard eyes of Angus Duer. And
  Martin resigned from the fraternity with him, planned to room with him the
  coming autumn.</p>

  <p>Clif's blustering rubbed Martin as it did Duer. Clif had no reticences;
  when he was not telling slimy stories he was demanding, "How much chuh pay
  for those shoes&mdash;must think you're a Vanderbilt!" or "D'I see you
  walking with that Madeline Fox femme&mdash;what chuh tryin' to do?" But
  Martin was alienated from the civilized, industrious, nice young men of
  Digamma Pi, in whose faces he could already see prescriptions, glossy white
  sterilizers, smart enclosed motors, and glass office-signs in the best gilt
  lettering. He preferred a barbarian loneliness, for next year he would be
  working with Max Gottlieb, and he could not be bothered.</p>

  <p>That summer he spent with a crew installing telephones in Montana.</p>

  <p>He was a lineman in the wire-gang. It was his job to climb the poles,
  digging the spurs of his leg-irons into the soft and silvery pine, to carry
  up the wire, lash it to the glass insulators, then down and to another
  pole.</p>

  <p>They made perhaps five miles a day; at night they drove into little
  rickety wooden towns. Their retiring was simple&mdash;they removed their
  shoes and rolled up in a horse-blanket. Martin wore overalls and a flannel
  shirt. He looked like a farm-hand. Climbing all day long, he breathed deep,
  his eyes cleared of worry, and one day he experienced a miracle.</p>

  <p>He was atop a pole and suddenly, for no clear cause, his eyes opened and
  he saw; as though he had just awakened he saw that the prairie was vast, that
  the sun was kindly on rough pasture and ripening wheat, on the old horses,
  the easy, broad-beamed, friendly horses, and on his red-faced jocose
  companions; he saw that the meadow larks were jubilant, and blackbirds
  shining by little pools, and with the living sun all life was living. Suppose
  the Angus Duers and Irving Watterses were tight tradesmen. What of it? "I'm
  <i>here!</i>" he gloated.</p>

  <p>The wire-gang were as healthy and as simple as the west wind; they had no
  pretentiousness; though they handled electrical equipment they did not, like
  medics, learn a confusion of scientific terms and pretend to the farmers that
  they were scientists. They laughed easily and were content to be themselves,
  and with them Martin was content to forget how noble he was. He had for them
  an affection such as he had for no one at the University save Max
  Gottlieb.</p>

  <p>He carried in his bag one book, Gottlieb's "Immunology." He could often
  get through half a page of it before he bogged down in chemical formulae.
  Occasionally, on Sundays or rainy days, he tried to read it, and longed for
  the laboratory; occasionally he thought of Madeline Fox, and became certain
  that he was devastatingly lonely for her. But week slipped into careless and
  robust week, and when he awoke in a stable, smelling the sweet hay and the
  horses and the lark-ringing prairie that crept near to the heart of these
  shanty towns, he cared only for the day's work, the day's hiking, westward
  toward the sunset.</p>

  <p>So they straggled through the Montana wheatland, whole duchies of wheat in
  one shining field, through the cattle-country and the sagebrush desert, and
  suddenly, staring at a persistent cloud, Martin realized that he beheld the
  mountains.</p>

  <p>Then he was on a train; the wire-gang were already forgotten; and he was
  thinking only of Madeline Fox, Clif Clawson, Angus Duer, and Max
  Gottlieb.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">Professor Max Gottlieb was about to assassinate a guinea pig
  with anthrax germs, and the bacteriology class were nervous.</p>

  <p>They had studied the forms of bacteria, they had handled Petri dishes and
  platinum loops, they had proudly grown on potato slices the harmless red
  cultures of Bacillus prodigiosus, and they had come now to pathogenic germs
  and the inoculation of a living animal with swift disease. These two
  beady-eyed guinea pigs, chittering in a battery jar, would in two days be
  stiff and dead.</p>

  <p>Martin had an excitement not free from anxiety. He laughed at it, he
  remembered with professional scorn how foolish were the lay visitors to the
  laboratory, who believed that sanguinary microbes would leap upon them from
  the mysterious centrifuge, from the benches, from the air itself. But he was
  conscious that in the cotton-plugged test-tube between the instrument-bath
  and the bichloride jar on the demonstrator's desk were millions of fatal
  anthrax germs.</p>

  <p>The class looked respectful and did not stand too close. With the flair of
  technique, the sure rapidity which dignified the slightest movement of his
  hands, Dr. Gottlieb clipped the hair on the belly of a guinea pig held by the
  assistant. He soaped the belly with one flicker of a hand-brush, he shaved it
  and painted it with iodine.</p>

  <p>(And all the while Max Gottlieb was recalling the eagerness of his first
  students, when he had just returned from working with Koch and Pasteur, when
  he was fresh from enormous beer seidels and Korpsbruder and ferocious
  arguments. Passionate, beautiful days! Die goldene Zeit! His first classes in
  America, at Queen City College, had been awed by the sensational discoveries
  in bacteriology; they had crowded about him reverently; they had longed to
  know. Now the class was a mob. He looked at them&mdash;Fatty Pfaff in the
  front row, his face vacant as a doorknob; the co-eds emotional and
  frightened; only Martin Arrowsmith and Angus Duer visibly intelligent. His
  memory fumbled for a pale blue twilight in Munich, a bridge and a waiting
  girl, and the sound of music.)</p>

  <p>He dipped his hands in the bichloride solution and shook them&mdash;a
  quick shake, fingers down, like the fingers of a pianist above the keys. He
  took a hypodermic needle from the instrument-bath and lifted the test-tube.
  His voice flowed indolently, with German vowels and blurred W's:</p>

  <p>"This, gentlemen, iss a twenty-four-hour culture of Bacillus anthracis.
  You will note, I am sure you will have noted already, that in the bottom of
  the tumbler there was cotton to keep the tube from being broken. I cannot
  advise breaking tubes of anthrax germs and afterwards getting the hands into
  the culture. You <i>might</i> merely get anthrax boils&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The class shuddered.</p>

  <p>Gottlieb twitched out the cotton plug with his little finger, so neatly
  that the medical students who had complained, "Bacteriology is junk;
  urinalysis and blood tests are all the lab stuff we need to know," now gave
  him something of the respect they had for a man who could do card tricks or
  remove an appendix in seven minutes. He agitated the mouth of the tube in the
  Bunsen burner, droning, "Every time you take the plug from a tube, flame the
  mouth of the tube. Make that a rule. It is a necessity of the technique, and
  technique, gentlemen, iss the beginning of all science. It iss also the
  least-known thing in science."</p>

  <p>The class was impatient. Why didn't he get on with it, on to the
  entertainingly dreadful moment of inoculating the pig?</p>

  <p>(And Max Gottlieb, glancing at the other guinea pig in the prison of its
  battery jar, meditated, "Wretched innocent! Why should I murder him, to teach
  Dummkopfe? It would be better to experiment on that fat young man.")</p>

  <p>He thrust the syringe into the tube, he withdrew the piston dextrously
  with his index finger, and lectured:</p>

  <p>"Take one half c.c. of the culture. There are two kinds of
  M.D.'s&mdash;those to whom c.c. means cubic centimeter and those to whom it
  means compound cathartic. The second kind are more prosperous."</p>

  <p>(But one cannot convey the quality of it: the thin drawl, the sardonic
  amiability, the hiss of the S's, the D's turned into blunt and challenging
  T's.)</p>

  <p>The assistant held the guinea pig close; Gottlieb pinched up the skin of
  the belly and punctured it with a quick down thrust of the hypodermic needle.
  The pig gave a little jerk, a little squeak, and the co-eds shuddered.
  Gottlieb's wise fingers knew when the peritoneal wall was reached. He pushed
  home the plunger of the syringe. He said quietly, "This poor animal will now
  soon be dead as Moses." The class glanced at one another uneasily. "Some of
  you will think that it does not matter; some of you will think, like Bernard
  Shaw, that I am an executioner and the more monstrous because I am cool about
  it; and some of you will not think at all. This difference in philosophy iss
  what makes life interesting."</p>

  <p>While the assistant tagged the pig with a tin disk in its ear and restored
  it to the battery jar, Gottlieb set down its weight in a note-book, with the
  time of inoculation and the age of the bacterial culture. These notes he
  reproduced on the blackboard, in his fastidious script, murmuring,
  "Gentlemen, the most important part of living is not the living but pondering
  upon it. And the most important part of experimentation is not doing the
  experiment but making notes, ve-ry accurate <i>quantitative</i>
  notes&mdash;in ink. I am told that a great many clever people feel they can
  keep notes in their heads. I have often observed with pleasure that such
  persons do not have heads in which to keep their notes. This iss very good,
  because thus the world never sees their results and science is not encumbered
  with them. I shall now inoculate the second guinea pig, and the class will be
  dismissed. Before the next lab hour I shall be glad if you will read Pater's
  'Marius the Epicurean,' to derife from it the calmness which iss the secret
  of laboratory skill."</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">As they bustled down the hall, Angus Duer observed to a
  brother Digam, "Gottlieb is an old laboratory plug; he hasn't got any
  imagination; he sticks here instead of getting out into the world and
  enjoying the fight. But he certainly is handy. Awfully good technique. He
  might have been a first-rate surgeon, and made fifty thousand dollars a year.
  As it is, I don't suppose he gets a cent over four thousand!"</p>

  <p>Ira Hinkley walked alone, worrying. He was an extraordinarily kindly man,
  this huge and bumbling parson. He reverently accepted everything, no matter
  how contradictory to everything else, that his medical instructors told him,
  but this killing of animals&mdash;he hated it. By a connection not evident to
  him he remembered that the Sunday before, in the slummy chapel where he
  preached during his medical course, he had exalted the sacrifice of the
  martyrs and they had sung of the blood of the lamb, the fountain filled with
  blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins, but this meditation he lost, and he
  lumbered toward Digamma Pi in a fog of pondering pity.</p>

  <p>Clif Clawson, walking with Fatty Pfaff, shouted, "Gosh, ole pig certainly
  did jerk when Pa Gottlieb rammed that needle home!" and Fatty begged, "Don't!
  Please!"</p>

  <p>But Martin Arrowsmith saw himself doing the same experiment and, as he
  remembered Gottlieb's unerring fingers, his hands curved in
  imitation.</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">The guinea pigs grew drowsier and drowsier. In two days they
  rolled over, kicked convulsively, and died. Full of dramatic expectation, the
  class reassembled for the necropsy. On the demonstrator's table was a wooden
  tray, scarred from the tacks which for years had pinned down the corpses. The
  guinea pigs were in a glass jar, rigid, their hair ruffled. The class tried
  to remember how nibbling and alive they had been. The assistant stretched out
  one of them with thumbtacks. Gottlieb swabbed its belly with a cotton wad
  soaked in lysol, slit it from belly to neck, and cauterized the heart with a
  red-hot spatula&mdash;the class quivered as they heard the searing of the
  flesh. Like a priest of diabolic mysteries, he drew out the blackened blood
  with a pipette. With the distended lungs, the spleen and kidneys and liver,
  the assistant made wavy smears on glass slides which were stained and given
  to the class for examination. The students who had learned to look through
  the microscope without having to close one eye were proud and professional,
  and all of them talked of the beauty of identifying the bacillus, as they
  twiddled the brass thumbscrews to the right focus and the cells rose from
  cloudiness to sharp distinctness on the slides before them. But they were
  uneasy, for Gottlieb remained with them that day, stalking behind them,
  saying nothing, watching them always, watching the disposal of the remains of
  the guinea pigs, and along the benches ran nervous rumors about a bygone
  student who had died from anthrax infection in the laboratory.</p><br>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">There was for Martin in these days a quality of satisfying
  delight; the zest of a fast hockey game, the serenity of the prairie, the
  bewilderment of great music, and a feeling of creation. He woke early and
  thought contentedly of the day; he hurried to his work, devout, unseeing.</p>

  <p>The confusion of the bacteriological laboratory was ecstasy to
  him&mdash;the students in shirt-sleeves, filtering nutrient gelatine, their
  fingers gummed from the crinkly gelatine leaves; or heating media in an
  autoclave like a silver howitzer. The roaring Bunsen flames beneath the
  hot-air ovens, the steam from the Arnold sterilizers rolling to the rafters,
  clouding the windows, were to Martin lovely with activity, and to him the
  most radiant things in the world were rows of test-tubes filled with watery
  serum and plugged with cotton singed to a coffee brown, a fine platinum loop
  leaning in a shiny test-glass, a fantastic hedge of tall glass tubes
  mysteriously connecting jars, or a bottle rich with gentian violet stain.</p>

  <p>He had begun, perhaps in youthful imitation of Gottlieb, to work by
  himself in the laboratory at night...The long room was dark, thick dark, but
  for the gas-mantle behind his microscope. The cone of light cast a gloss on
  the bright brass tube, a sheen on his black hair, as he bent over the
  eyepiece. He was studying trypanosomes from a rat&mdash;an eight-branched
  rosette stained with polychrome methylene blue; a cluster of organisms
  delicate as a narcissus, with their purple nuclei, their light blue cells,
  and the thin lines of the flagella. He was excited and a little proud; he had
  stained the germs perfectly, and it is not easy to stain a rosette without
  breaking the petal shape. In the darkness, a step, the weary step of Max
  Gottlieb, and a hand on Martin's shoulder. Silently Martin raised his head,
  pushed the microscope toward him. Bending down, a cigarette stub in his
  mouth&mdash;the smoke would have stung the eyes of any human
  being&mdash;Gottlieb peered at the preparation.</p>

  <p>He adjusted the gas light a quarter inch, and mused, "Splendid! You have
  craftsmanship. Oh, there is an art in science&mdash;for a few. You Americans,
  so many of you&mdash;all full with ideas, but you are impatient with the
  beautiful dullness of long labors. I see already&mdash;and I watch you in the
  lab before&mdash;perhaps you may try the trypanosomes of sleeping sickness.
  They are very, very interesting, and very, very ticklish to handle. It is
  quite a nice disease. In some villages in Africa, fifty per cent of the
  people have it, and it is invariably fatal. Yes, I think you might work on
  the bugs."</p>

  <p>Which, to Martin, was getting his brigade in battle.</p>

  <p>"I shall have," said Gottlieb, "a little sandwich in my room at midnight.
  If you should happen to work so late, I should be very pleast if you would
  come to have a bite."</p>

  <p>Diffidently, Martin crossed the hall to Gottlieb's immaculate laboratory
  at midnight. On the bench were coffee and sandwiches, curiously small and
  excellent sandwiches, foreign to Martin's lunch-room taste.</p>

  <p>Gottlieb talked till Clif had faded from existence and Angus Duer seemed
  but an absurd climber. He summoned forth London laboratories, dinners on
  frosty evenings in Stockholm, walks on the Pincio with sunset behind the dome
  of San Pietro, extreme danger and overpowering disgust from excreta-smeared
  garments in an epidemic at Marseilles. His reserve slipped from him and he
  talked of himself and of his family as though Martin were a contemporary.</p>

  <p>The cousin who was a colonel in Uruguay and the cousin, a rabbi, who was
  tortured in a pogrom in Moscow. His sick wife&mdash;it might be cancer. The
  three children&mdash;the youngest girl, Miriam, she was a good musician, but
  the boy, the fourteen-year-old, he was a worry; he was saucy, he would not
  study. Himself, he had worked for years on the synthesis of antibodies; he
  was at present in a blind alley, and at Mohalis there was no one who was
  interested, no one to stir him, but he was having an agreeable time
  massacring the opsonin theory, and that cheered him.</p>

  <p>"No, I have done nothing except be unpleasant to people that claim too
  much, but I have dreams of real discoveries some day. And&mdash;No. Not five
  times in five years do I have students who understand craftsmanship and
  precision and maybe some big imagination in hypotheses. I t'ink perhaps you
  may have them. If I can help you&mdash;So!</p>

  <p>"I do not t'ink you will be a good doctor. Good doctors are
  fine&mdash;often they are artists&mdash;but their trade, it is not for us
  lonely ones that work in labs. Once, I took an M.D. label. In Heidelberg that
  was&mdash;Herr Gott, back in 1875! I could not get much interested in
  bandaging legs and looking at tongues. I was a follower of
  Helmholtz&mdash;what a wild blithering young fellow! I tried to make
  researches in the physics of sound&mdash;I was bad, most unbelievable, but I
  learned that in this wale of tears there is nothing certain but the
  quantitative method. And I was a chemist&mdash;a fine stink-maker was I. And
  so into biology and much trouble. It has been good. I have found one or two
  things. And if sometimes I feel an exile, cold&mdash;I had to get out of
  Germany one time for refusing to sing Die Wacht am Rhein and trying to kill a
  cavalry captain&mdash;he was a stout fellow&mdash;I had to choke
  him&mdash;you see I am boasting, but I was a lifely Kerl thirty years ago!
  Ah! So!</p>

  <p>"There is but one trouble of a philosophical bacteriologist. Why should we
  destroy these amiable pathogenic germs? Are we too sure, when we regard these
  oh, most unbeautiful young students attending Y.M.C.A.'s and singing
  dinkle-songs and wearing hats with initials burned into them&mdash;iss it
  worth while to protect them from the so elegantly functioning Bacillus
  typhosus with its lovely flagella? You know, once I asked Dean Silva would it
  not be better to let loose the pathogenic germs on the world, and so solve
  all economic questions. But he did not care for my met'od. Oh, well, he is
  older than I am; he also gives, I hear, some dinner parties with bishops and
  judges present, all in nice clothes. He would know more than a German Jew who
  loves Father Nietzsche and Father Schopenhauer (but damn him, he was
  teleological-minded!) and Father Koch and Father Pasteur and Brother Jacques
  Loeb and Brother Arrhenius. Ja! I talk foolishness. Let us go look at your
  slides and so good night."</p>

  <p>When he had left Gottlieb at his stupid brown little house, his face as
  reticent as though the midnight supper and all the rambling talk had never
  happened, Martin ran home altogether drunk.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5">CHAPTER V.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">Though bacteriology was all of Martin's life now, it was the
  theory of the University that he was also studying pathology, hygiene,
  surgical anatomy, and enough other subjects to swamp a genius.</p>

  <p>Clif Clawson and he lived in a large room with flowered wallpaper, piles
  of filthy clothes, iron beds, and cuspidors. They made their own breakfasts;
  they dined on hash at the Pilgrim Lunch Wagon or the Dew Drop Inn. Clif was
  occasionally irritating; he hated open windows; he talked of dirty socks; he
  sang "Some die of Diabetes" when Martin was studying; and he was altogether
  unable to say anything directly. He had to be humorous. He remarked, "Is it
  your combobulatory concept that we might now feed the old faces?" or "How
  about ingurgitating a few calories?" But he had for Martin a charm that could
  not be accounted for by cheerfulness, his shrewdness, his vague courage. The
  whole of Clif was more than the sum of his various parts.</p>

  <p>In the joy of his laboratory work Martin thought rarely of his recent
  associates in Digamma Pi. He occasionally protested that the Reverend Ira
  Hinkley was a village policeman and Irving Watters a plumber, that Angus Duer
  would walk to success over his grandmother's head, and that for an idiot like
  Fatty Pfaff to practice on helpless human beings was criminal, but mostly he
  ignored them and ceased to be a pest. And when he had passed his first
  triumphs in bacteriology and discovered how remarkably much he did not know,
  he was curiously humble.</p>

  <p>If he was less annoying in regard to his classmates, he was more so in his
  classrooms. He had learned from Gottlieb the trick of using the word
  "control" in reference to the person or animal or chemical left untreated
  during an experiment, as a standard for comparison; and there is no trick
  more infuriating. When a physician boasted of his success with this drug or
  that electric cabinet, Gottlieb always snorted, "Where was your control? How
  many cases did you have under identical conditions, and how many of them did
  not get the treatment?" Now Martin began to mouth it&mdash;control, control,
  control, where's your control? where's your control?&mdash;till most of his
  fellows and a few of his instructors desired to lynch him.</p>

  <p>He was particularly tedious in materia medica.</p>

  <p>The professor of materia medica, Dr. Lloyd Davidson, would have been an
  illustrious shopkeeper. He was very popular. From him a future physician
  could learn that most important of all things: the proper drugs to give a
  patient, particularly when you cannot discover what is the matter with him.
  His classes listened with zeal, and memorized the sacred hundred and fifty
  favorite prescriptions. (He was proud that this was fifty more than his
  predecessor had required.)</p>

  <p>But Martin was rebellious. He inquired, and publicly, "Dr. Davidson, how
  do they know ichthyol is good for erysipelas? Isn't it just rotten fossil
  fish&mdash;isn't it like the mummy-dust and puppy-ear stuff they used to give
  in the olden days?"</p>

  <p>"How do they know? Why, my critical young friend, because thousands of
  physicians have used it for years and found their patients getting better,
  and that's how they know!"</p>

  <p>"But honest, Doctor, wouldn't the patients maybe have gotten better
  anyway? Wasn't it maybe a post hoc, propter hoc? Have they ever experimented
  on a whole slew of patients together, with controls?"</p>

  <p>"Probably not&mdash;and until some genius like yourself, Arrowsmith, can
  herd together a few hundred people with exactly identical cases of
  erysipelas, it probably never will be tried! Meanwhile I trust that you other
  gentlemen, who perhaps lack Mr. Arrowsmith's profound scientific attainments
  and the power to use such handy technical terms as 'control,' will, merely on
  my feeble advice, continue to use ichthyol!"</p>

  <p>But Martin insisted, "Please, Dr. Davidson, what's the use of getting all
  these prescriptions by heart, anyway? We'll forget most of 'em, and besides,
  we can always look 'em up in the book."</p>

  <p>Davidson pressed his lips together, then:</p>

  <p>"Arrowsmith, with a man of your age I hate to answer you as I would a
  three-year-old boy, but apparently I must. Therefore, you will learn the
  properties of drugs and the contents of prescriptions <i>because I tell you
  to</i>! If I did not hesitate to waste the time of the other members of this
  class, I would try to convince you that my statements may be accepted, not on
  my humble authority, but because they are the conclusions of wise
  men&mdash;men wiser or certainly a little older than you, my
  friend&mdash;through many ages. But as I have no desire to indulge in fancy
  flights of rhetoric and eloquence, I shall merely say that you will accept,
  and you will study, and you will memorize, because I tell you to!"</p>

  <p>Martin considered dropping his medical course and specializing in
  bacteriology. He tried to confide in Clif, but Clif had become impatient of
  his fretting, and he turned again to the energetic and willowy Madeline
  Fox.</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">Madeline was at once sympathetic and sensible. Why not
  complete his medical course, then see what he wanted to do?</p>

  <p>They tramped, they skated, they skied, they went to the University
  Dramatic Society play. Madeline's widowed mother had come to live with her,
  and they had taken a top-floor flat in one of the tiny apartment-houses which
  were beginning to replace the expansive old wooden houses of Mohalis. The
  flat was full of literature and decoration: a bronze Buddha from Chicago, a
  rubbing of Shakespeare's epitaph, a set of Anatole France in translation, a
  photograph of Cologne cathedral, a wicker tea-table with a samovar whose
  operation no one in the University understood, and a souvenir post-card
  album. Madeline's mother was a Main Street dowager duchess. She was stately
  and white-haired but she attended the Methodist Church. In Mohalis she was
  flustered by the chatter of the students; she longed for her home-town, for
  the church sociables and the meetings of the women's club&mdash;they were
  studying Education this year and she hated to lose all the information about
  university ways.</p>

  <p>With a home and a chaperone, Madeline began to "entertain": eight-o'clock
  parties with coffee, chocolate cake, chicken salad, and word-games. She
  invited Martin, but he was jealous of his evenings, beautiful evenings of
  research. The first affair to which she enticed him was her big New Year's
  Party in January. They "did advertisements"&mdash;guessed at tableaux
  representing advertising pictures; they danced to the phonograph; and they
  had not merely a lap-supper but little tables excessively covered with
  doilies.</p>

  <p>Martin was unaccustomed to such elegance. Though he had come in sulky
  unwillingness, he was impressed by the supper, by the frocks of the young
  women; he realized that his dancing was rusty, and he envied the senior who
  could do the new waltz called the "Boston." There was no strength, no grace,
  no knowledge, that Martin Arrowsmith did not covet, when consciousness of it
  had pierced through the layers of his absorption. If he was but little greedy
  for possessions, he was hungry for every skill.</p>

  <p>His reluctant wonder at the others was drowned in his admiration for
  Madeline. He had known her as a jacketed outdoor girl, but this was an
  exquisite indoor Madeline, slender in yellow silk. She seemed to him a
  miracle of tact and ease as she bullied her guests into an appearance of
  merriment. She had need of tact, for Dr. Norman Brumfit was there, and it was
  one of Dr. Brumfit's evenings to be original and naughty. He pretended to
  kiss Madeline's mother, which vastly discomforted the poor lady; he sang a
  strongly improper Negro song containing the word hell; he maintained to a
  group of women graduate students that George Sand's affairs might perhaps be
  partially justified by their influence on men of talent; and when they looked
  shocked, he pranced a little, and his eyeglasses glittered.</p>

  <p>Madeline took charge of him. She trilled, "Dr. Brumfit, you're terribly
  learned and so on and so forth, and sometimes in English classes I'm simply
  scared to death of you, but other times you're nothing but a bad small boy,
  and I won't have you teasing the girls. You can help me bring in the sherbet,
  that's what you can do."</p>

  <p>Martin adored her. He hated Brumfit for the privilege of disappearing with
  her into the closet-like kitchen of the flat. Madeline! She was the one
  person who understood him! Here, where everyone snatched at her and Dr.
  Brumfit beamed on her with almost matrimonial fondness, she was precious, she
  was something he must have.</p>

  <p>On pretense of helping her set the tables, he had a moment with her, and
  whimpered, "Lord, you're so lovely!"</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you think I'm a wee bit nice." She, the rose and the adored of
  all the world, gave him her favor.</p>

  <p>"Can I come call on you tomorrow evening?'</p>

  <p>"Well, I&mdash;Perhaps."</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">It cannot be said, in this biography of a young man who was
  in no degree a hero, who regarded himself as a seeker after truth yet who
  stumbled and slid back all his life and bogged himself in every obvious
  morass, that Martin's intentions toward Madeline Fox were what is called
  "honorable." He was not a Don Juan, but he was a poor medical student who
  would have to wait for years before he could make a living. Certainly he did
  not think of proposing marriage. He wanted&mdash;like most poor and ardent
  young men in such a case, he wanted all he could get.</p>

  <p>As he raced toward her flat, he was expectant of adventure. He pictured
  her melting; he felt her hand glide down his cheek. He warned himself, "Don't
  be a fool now! Probably nothing doing at all. Don't go get all worked up and
  then be disappointed. She'll probably cuss you out for something you did
  wrong at the party. She'll probably be sleepy and wish you hadn't come.
  Nothing!" But he did not for a second believe it.</p>

  <p>He rang, he saw her opening the door, he followed her down the meager
  hall, longing to take her hand. He came into the over-bright
  living-room&mdash;and he found her mother, solid as a pyramid,
  permanent-looking as sunless winter.</p>

  <p>But of course Mother would obligingly go, and leave him to conquest.</p>

  <p>Mother did not.</p>

  <p>In Mohalis, the suitable time for young men callers to depart is ten
  o'clock, but from eight till a quarter after eleven Martin did battle with
  Mrs. Fox; talked to her in two languages, an audible gossip and a mute but
  furious protest, while Madeline&mdash;she was present; she sat about and
  looked pretty. In an equally silent tongue Mrs. Fox answered him, till the
  room was thick with their antagonism, while they seemed to be discussing the
  weather, the University, and the trolley service into Zenith.</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course, some day I guess they'll have a car every twenty
  minutes," he said weightily.</p>

  <p>("Darn her, why doesn't she go to bed? Cheers! She's doing up her
  knitting. Nope. Damn it! She's taking another ball of wool.")</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I'm sure they'll have to have better service," said Mrs.
  Fox.</p>

  <p>("Young man, I don't know much about you, but I don't believe you're the
  right kind of person for Madeline to go with. Anyway, it's time you went
  home.")</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, sure, you bet. Lot better service."</p>

  <p>("I know I'm staying too long, and I know you know it, but I don't
  care!")</p>

  <p>It seemed impossible that Mrs. Fox should endure his stolid persistence.
  He used thought-forms, will-power, and hypnotism, and when he rose, defeated,
  she was still there, extremely placid. They said good-by not too warmly.
  Madeline took him to the door; for an exhilarating half-minute he had her
  alone.</p>

  <p>"I wanted so much&mdash;I wanted to talk to you!"</p>

  <p>"I know. I'm sorry. Some time!" she muttered.</p>

  <p>He kissed her. It was a tempestuous kiss, and very sweet.</p><br>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">Fudge parties, skating parties, sleighing parties, a
  literary party with the guest of honor a lady journalist who did the social
  page for the Zenith Advocate-Times&mdash;Madeline leaped into an orgy of
  jocund but extraordinarily tiring entertainments, and Martin obediently and
  smolderingly followed her. She appeared to have trouble in getting enough
  men, and to the literary evening Martin dragged the enraged Clif Clawson.
  Clif grumbled, "This is the damnedest zoo of sparrows I ever did time in,"
  but he bore off treasure&mdash;he had heard Madeline call Martin by her
  favorite name of "Martykins." That was very valuable. Clif called him
  Martykins. Clif told others to call him Martykins. Fatty Pfaff and Irving
  Watters called him Martykins. And when Martin wanted to go to sleep, Clif
  croaked:</p>

  <p>"Yuh, you'll probably marry her. She's a dead shot. She can hit a smart
  young M.D. at ninety paces. Oh, you'll have one fine young time going on with
  science after that skirt sets you at tonsil-snatching...She's one of these
  literary birds. She knows all about lite'ature except maybe how to
  read...She's not so bad-looking, now. She'll get fat, like her Ma."</p>

  <p>Martin said that which was necessary, and he concluded, "She's the only
  girl in the graduate school that's got any pep. The others just sit around
  and talk, and she gets up the best parties&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Any kissing parties?"</p>

  <p>"Now you look here! I'll be getting sore, first thing you know! You and I
  are roughnecks, but Madeline Fox&mdash;she's like Angus Duer, some ways. I
  realize all the stuff we're missing: music and literature, yes, and decent
  clothes, too&mdash;no harm to dressing well&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's just what I was tellin' you! She'll have you all dolled up in a
  Prince Albert and a boiled shirt, diagnosing everything as rich-widowitis.
  How you can fall for that four-flushing dame&mdash;<i>where's your
  control</i>?"</p>

  <p>Clif's opposition stirred him to consider Madeline not merely with a sly
  and avaricious interest but with a dramatic conviction that he longed to
  marry her.</p><br>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="first">Few women can for long periods keep from trying to Improve
  their men, and To Improve means to change a person from what he is, whatever
  that may be, into something else. Girls like Madeline Fox, artistic young
  women who do not work at it, cannot be restrained from Improving for more
  than a day at a time. The moment the urgent Martin showed that he was stirred
  by her graces, she went at his clothes&mdash;his corduroys and soft collars
  and eccentric old gray felt hat&mdash;at his vocabulary and his taste in
  fiction, with new and more patronizing vigor. Her sketchy way of saying,
  "Why, of course everybody knows that Emerson was the greatest thinker"
  irritated him the more in contrast to Gottlieb's dark patience.</p>

  <p>"Oh, let me alone!" he hurled at her. "You're the nicest thing the Lord
  ever made, when you stick to things you know about, but when you spring your
  ideas on politics and chemotherapy&mdash;Darn it, quit bullying me! I guess
  you're right about slang. I'll cut out all this junk about 'feeding your
  face' and so on. But I will not put on a hard-boiled collar! I won't!"</p>

  <p>He might never have proposed to her but for the spring evening on the
  roof.</p>

  <p>She used the flat roof of her apartment-house as a garden. She had set out
  one box of geraniums and a cast-iron bench like those once beheld in cemetery
  plots; she had hung up two Japanese lanterns&mdash;they were ragged and they
  hung crooked. She spoke with scorn of the other inhabitants of the
  apartment-house, who were "so prosaic, so conventional, that they never came
  up to this darling hidey-place." She compared her refuge to the roof of a
  Moorish palace, to a Spanish patio, to a Japanese garden, to a "pleasaunce of
  old Provencal." But to Martin it seemed a good deal like a plain roof. He was
  vaguely ready for a quarrel, that April evening when he called on Madeline
  and her mother sniffily told him that she was to be found on the roof.</p>

  <p>"Damned Japanese lanterns. Rather look at liver-sections," he grumbled, as
  he trudged up the curving stairs.</p>

  <p>Madeline was sitting on the funereal iron bench, her chin in her hands.
  For once she did not greet him with flowery excitement but with a
  noncommittal "Hello." She seemed spiritless. He felt guilty for his scoffing;
  he suddenly saw the pathos in her pretense that this stretch of tar-paper and
  slatted walks was a blazing garden. As he sat beside her he piped, "Say,
  that's a dandy new strip of matting you've put down."</p>

  <p>"It is not! It's mangy!" She turned toward him. She wailed, "Oh, Mart, I'm
  so sick of myself, tonight. I'm always trying to make people think I'm
  somebody. I'm not. I'm a bluff."</p>

  <p>"What is it, dear?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's lots. Dr. Brumfit, hang him&mdash;only he was right&mdash;he as
  good as told me that if I don't work harder I'll have to get out of the
  graduate school. I'm not doing a thing, he said, and if I don't have my
  Ph.D., then I won't be able to land a nice job teaching English in some swell
  school, and I'd better land one, too, because it doesn't look to poor
  Madeline as if anybody was going to marry her."</p>

  <p>His arm about her, he blared, "I know exactly who&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not fishing. I'm almost honest, tonight. I'm no good, Mart. I
  tell people how clever I am. And I don't suppose they believe it. Probably
  they go off and laugh at me!"</p>

  <p>"They do not! If they did&mdash;I'd like to see anybody that tried
  laughing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's awfully sweet and dear of you, but I'm not worth it. The poetic
  Madeline. With her ree-fined vocabulary! I'm a&mdash;I'm a&mdash;Martin, I'm
  a tin-horn sport! I'm everything your friend Clif thinks I am. Oh, you
  needn't tell me. I know what he thinks. And&mdash;I'll have to go home with
  Mother, and I can't stand it, dear, I can't stand it! I won't go back! That
  town! Never anything doing! The old tabbies, and the beastly old men, always
  telling the same old jokes. I won't!"</p>

  <p>Her head was in the hollow of his arm; she was weeping, hard; he was
  stroking her hair, not covetously now but tenderly, and he was
  whispering:</p>

  <p>"Darling! I almost feel as if I dared to love you. You're going to marry
  me and&mdash;Take me couple more years to finish my medical course and couple
  in hospital, then we'll be married and&mdash;By thunder, with you helping me,
  I'm going to climb to the top! Be big surgeon! We're going to have
  everything!"</p>

  <p>"Dearest, do be wise. I don't want to keep you from your scientific
  work&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh. Well. Well, I would like to keep up <i>some</i> research. But
  thunder, I'm not just a lab-cat. Battle o' life. Smashing your way through.
  Competing with real men in real he-struggle. If I can't do that and do some
  scientific work too, I'm no good. Course while I'm with Gottlieb, I want to
  take advantage of it, but afterwards&mdash;Oh, Madeline!"</p>

  <p>Then was all reasoning lost in a blur of nearness to her.</p><br>

  <h3>VI.</h3>

  <p class="first">He dreaded the interview with Mrs. Fox; he was certain that
  she would demand, "Young man, how do you expect to support my Maddy? And you
  use bad language." But she took his hand and mourned, "I hope you and my baby
  will be happy. She's a dear good girl, even if she is a little flighty
  sometimes, and I know you're nice and kind and hard-working. I shall pray
  you'll be happy&mdash;oh, I'll pray so hard! You young people don't seem to
  think much of prayer, but if you knew how it helped me&mdash;Oh, I'll
  petition for your sweet happiness!"</p>

  <p>She was weeping; she kissed Martin's forehead with the dry, soft, gentle
  kiss of an old woman, and he was near to weeping with her.</p>

  <p>At parting Madeline whispered, "Boy, I don't care a bit, myself, but
  Mother would love it if we went to church with her. Don't you think you
  could, just once?"</p>

  <p>The astounded world, the astounded and profane Clif Clawson, had the
  spectacle of Martin in shiny pressed clothes, a painful linen collar, and an
  arduously tied scarf, accompanying Mrs. Fox and the chastely chattering
  Madeline to the Mohalis Methodist Church, to hear the Reverend Dr. Myron
  Schwab discourse on "The One Way to Righteousness."</p>

  <p>They passed the Reverend Ira Hinkley, and Ira gloated with a holy gloating
  at Martin's captivity.</p><br>

  <h3>VII.</h3>

  <p class="first">For all his devotion to Max Gottlieb's pessimistic view of
  the human intellect, Martin had believed that there was such a thing as
  progress, that events meant something, that people could learn something,
  that if Madeline had once admitted she was an ordinary young woman who
  occasionally failed, then she was saved. He was bewildered when she began
  improving him more airily than ever. She complained of his vulgarity and what
  she asserted to be his slack ambition. "You think it's terribly smart of you
  to feel superior. Sometimes I wonder if it isn't just laziness. You like to
  day-dream around labs. Why should <i>you</i> be spared the work of memorizing
  your materia medica and so on and so forth? All the others have to do it. No,
  I won't kiss you. I want you to grow up and listen to reason."</p>

  <p>In fury at her badgering, in desire for her lips and forgiving smile, he
  was whirled through to the end of the term.</p>

  <p>A week before examinations, when he was trying to spend twenty-four hours
  a day in making love to her, twenty-four in grinding for examinations, and
  twenty-four in the bacteriological laboratory, he promised Clif that he would
  spend that summer vacation with him, working as a waiter in a Canadian hotel.
  He met Madeline in the evening, and with her walked through the cherry
  orchard on the Agricultural Experiment Station grounds.</p>

  <p>"You know what I think of your horrid Clif Clawson," she complained. "I
  don't suppose you care to hear my opinion of him."</p>

  <p>"I've had your opinion, my beloved." Martin sounded mature, and not too
  pleasant.</p>

  <p>"Well, I can tell you right now you haven't had my opinion of your being a
  waiter! For the life of me I can't understand why you don't get some
  gentlemanly job for vacation, instead of hustling dirty dishes. Why couldn't
  you work on a newspaper, where you'd have to dress decently and meet nice
  people?"</p>

  <p>"Sure. I might edit the paper. But since you say so, I won't work at all
  this summer. Fool thing to do, anyway. I'll go to Newport and play golf and
  wear a dress suit every night."</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't hurt you any! I do respect honest labor. It's like Burns
  says. But waiting on table! Oh, Mart, why are you so proud of being a
  roughneck? Do stop being smart, for a minute. Listen to the night. And smell
  the cherry blossoms...Or maybe a great scientist like you, that's so superior
  to ordinary people, is too good for cherry blossoms!"</p>

  <p>"Well, except for the fact that every cherry blossom has been gone for
  weeks now, you're dead right."</p>

  <p>"Oh, they have, have they! They may be faded but&mdash;Will you be so good
  as to tell me what that pale white mass is up there?"</p>

  <p>"I will. It looks to me like a hired-man's shirt."</p>

  <p>"Martin Arrowsmith, if you think for one moment that I'm ever going to
  marry a vulgar, crude, selfish, microbe-grubbing smart aleck&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And if you think I'm going to marry a dame that keeps nag-nag-naggin' and
  jab-jab-jabbin' at me all day long&mdash;"</p>

  <p>They hurt each other; they had pleasure in it; and they parted forever,
  twice they parted forever, the second time very rudely, near a
  fraternity-house where students were singing heart-breaking summer songs to a
  banjo.</p>

  <p>In ten days, without seeing her again, he was off with Clif to the North
  Woods, and in his sorrow of losing her, his longing for her soft flesh and
  for her willingness to listen to him, he was only a little excited that he
  should have led the class in bacteriology, and that Max Gottlieb should have
  appointed him undergraduate assistant for the coming year.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">The waiters at Nokomis Lodge, among the Ontario pines, were
  all of them university students. They were not supposed to appear at the
  Lodge dances&mdash;they merely appeared, and took the prettiest girls away
  from the elderly and denunciatory suitors in white flannels. They had to work
  but seven hours a day. The rest of the time they fished, swam, and tramped
  the shadowy trails, and Martin came back to Mohalis placid&mdash;and
  enormously in love with Madeline.</p>

  <p>They had written to each other, politely, regretfully, and once a
  fortnight; then passionately and daily. For the summer she had been dragged
  to her home town, near the Ohio border of Winnemac, a town larger than
  Martin's Elk Mills but more sun-baked, more barren with little factories. She
  sighed, in a huge loose script dashing all over the page:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Perhaps we shall never see each other again but I do want
  you to know how much I prize all the talks we had together about science
  &amp; ideals &amp; education, etc.&mdash;I certainly appreciate them here
  when I listen to these stick in the muds going on, oh, it is too dreadful,
  about their automobiles &amp; how much they have to pay their maids and so on
  &amp; so forth. You gave me so much but I did give you something didn't I? I
  cant always be in the wrong can I?</p><br>

  <p>"My dear, my little girl!" he lamented. "'Can't always be in the wrong'!
  You poor kid, you poor dear kid!"</p>

  <p>By midsummer they were firmly re-engaged and, though he was slightly
  disturbed by the cashier, a young and giggling Wisconsin school-teacher with
  ankles, he so longed for Madeline that he lay awake thinking of giving up his
  job and fleeing to her caresses&mdash;lay awake for minutes at a time.</p>

  <p>The returning train was torturingly slow, and he dismounted at Mohalis
  fevered with visions of her. Twenty minutes after, they were clinging
  together in the quiet of her living room. It is true that twenty minutes
  after that, she was sneering at Clif Clawson, at fishing, and at all
  school-teachers, but to his fury she yielded in tears.</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">His Junior year was a whirlwind. To attend lectures on
  physical diagnosis, surgery, neurology, obstetrics, and gynecology in the
  morning, with hospital demonstrations in the afternoon; to supervise the
  making of media and the sterilization of glassware for Gottlieb; to instruct
  a new class in the use of the microscope and filter and autoclave; to read a
  page now and then of scientific German or French; to see Madeline constantly;
  to get through it all he drove himself to hysterical hurrying, and in the
  dizziest of it he began his first original research&mdash;his first lyric,
  his first ascent of unexplored mountains.</p>

  <p>He had immunized rabbits to typhoid, and he believed that if he mixed
  serum taken from these immune animals with typhoid germs, the germs would
  die. Unfortunately&mdash;he felt&mdash;the germs grew joyfully. He was
  troubled; he was sure that his technique had been clumsy; he performed his
  experiment over and over, working till midnight, waking at dawn to ponder on
  his notes. (Though in letters to Madeline his writing was an inconsistent
  scrawl, in his laboratory notes it was precise.) When he was quite sure that
  Nature was persisting in doing something she ought not to, he went guiltily
  to Gottlieb, protesting, "The darn' bugs ought to die in this immune serum,
  but they don't. There's something wrong with the theories."</p>

  <p>"Young man, do you set yourself up against science?" grated Gottlieb,
  flapping the papers on his desk. "Do you feel competent, huh, to attack the
  dogmas of immunology?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, sir. I can't help what the dogma is. Here's my protocols.
  Honestly, I've gone over and over the stuff, and I get the same results, as
  you can see. I only know what I observe."</p>

  <p>Gottlieb beamed. "I give you, my boy, my episcopal blessings! That is the
  way! Observe what you observe, and if it does violence to all the nice
  correct views of science&mdash;out they go! I am very pleast, Martin. But now
  find out the Why, the underneath principle."</p>

  <p>Ordinarily, Gottlieb called him "Arrowsmith" or "You" or "Uh." When he was
  furious he called him, or any other student, "Doctor." It was only in high
  moments that he honored him with "Martin," and the boy trotted off
  blissfully, to try to find (but never to succeed in finding) the Why that
  made everything so.</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">Gottlieb had sent him into Zenith, to the huge Zenith
  General Hospital, to secure a strain of meningococcus from an interesting
  patient. The bored reception clerk&mdash;who was interested only in obtaining
  the names, business addresses, and religions of patients, and did not care
  who died or who spat on the beautiful blue and white linoleum or who went
  about collecting meningococci, so long as the addresses were properly
  entered&mdash;loftily told him to go up to Ward D. Through the long hallways,
  past numberless rooms from which peered yellow-faced old women sitting up in
  bed in linty nightgowns, Martin wandered, trying to look important, hoping to
  be taken for a doctor, and succeeding only in feeling extraordinarily
  embarrassed.</p>

  <p>He passed several nurses rapidly, half nodding to them, in the manner (or
  what he conceived to be the manner) of a brilliant young surgeon who is about
  to operate. He was so absorbed in looking like a brilliant young surgeon that
  he was completely lost, and discovered himself in a wing filled with private
  suites. He was late. He had no more time to go on being impressive. Like all
  males, he hated to confess ignorance by asking directions, but grudgingly he
  stopped at the door of a bedroom in which a probationer nurse was scrubbing
  the floor.</p>

  <p>She was a smallish and slender probationer, muffled in a harsh blue denim
  dress, an enormous white apron, and a turban bound about her head with an
  elastic&mdash;a uniform as grubby as her pail of scrub-water. She peered up
  with the alert impudence of a squirrel.</p>

  <p>"Nurse," he said, "I want to find Ward D."</p>

  <p>Lazily, "Do you?"</p>

  <p>"I do! If I can interrupt your work&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Doesn't matter. The damn' superintendent of nurses put me at scrubbing,
  and we aren't ever supposed to scrub floors, because she caught me smoking a
  cigarette. She's an old terror. If she found a child like you wandering
  around here, she'd drag you out by the ear."</p>

  <p>"My <i>dear</i> young woman, it may interest you to know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh! 'My dear young woman, it may&mdash;' Sounds exactly like our old
  prof, back home."</p>

  <p>Her indolent amusement, her manner of treating him as though they were a
  pair of children making tongues at each other in a railroad station, was
  infuriating to the earnest young assistant of Professor Gottlieb.</p>

  <p>"I am Dr. Arrowsmith," he snorted, "and I've been informed that even
  probationers learn that the first duty of a nurse is to stand when addressing
  doctors! I wish to find Ward D, to take a strain of&mdash;<i>it may interest
  you to know</i>!&mdash;a very dangerous microbe, and if you will kindly
  direct me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, gee, I've been getting fresh again. I don't seem to get along with
  this military discipline. All right. I'll stand up." She did. Her every
  movement was swiftly smooth as the running of a cat. "You go back, turn
  right, then left. I'm sorry I was fresh. But if you saw some of the old muffs
  of doctors that a nurse has to be meek to&mdash;Honestly, Doctor&mdash;if you
  <i>are</i> a doctor&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't see that I need to convince you!" he raged, as he stalked off.
  All the way to Ward D he was furious at her veiled derision. He was an
  eminent scientist, and it was outrageous that he should have to endure
  impudence from a probationer&mdash;a singularly vulgar probationer, a thin
  and slangy young woman apparently from the West. He repeated his rebuke: "I
  don't see that I need to convince you." He was proud of himself for having
  been lofty. He pictured himself telling Madeline about it, concluding, "I
  just said to her quietly, 'My dear young woman, I don't know that you are the
  person to whom I have to explain my mission here,' I said, and she
  wilted."</p>

  <p>But her image had not wilted, when he had found the intern who was to help
  him and had taken the spinal fluid. She was before him, provocative,
  enduring. He had to see her again, and convince her&mdash;"Take a better man
  than she is, better man than I've ever met, to get away with being insulting
  to <i>me!</i>" said the modest young scientist.</p>

  <p>He had raced back to her room and they were staring at each other before
  it came to him that he had not worked out the crushing things he was going to
  say. She had risen from her scrubbing. She had taken off her turban, and her
  hair was silky and honey-colored, her eyes were blue, her face childish.
  There was nothing of the slavey in her. He could imagine her running down
  hillsides, shinning up a sack of straw.</p>

  <p>"Oh," she said gravely. "I didn't mean to be rude then. I was
  just&mdash;Scrubbing makes me bad-tempered. I thought you were awfully nice,
  and I'm sorry I hurt your feelings, but you did seem so young for a
  doctor."</p>

  <p>"I'm not. I'm a medic. I was showing off."</p>

  <p>"So was I!"</p>

  <p>He felt an instant and complete comradeship with her, a relation free from
  the fencing and posing of his struggle with Madeline. He knew that this girl
  was of his own people. If she was vulgar, jocular, unreticent, she was also
  gallant, she was full of laughter at humbugs, she was capable of a loyalty
  too casual and natural to seem heroic. His voice was lively, though his words
  were only:</p>

  <p>"Pretty hard, this training for nursing, I guess."</p>

  <p>"Not so awful, but it's just as romantic as being a hired
  girl&mdash;that's what we call 'em in Dakota."</p>

  <p>"Come from Dakota?"</p>

  <p>"I come from the most enterprising town&mdash;three hundred and sixty-two
  inhabitants&mdash;in the entire state of North Dakota&mdash;Wheatsylvania.
  Are you in the U. medic school?"</p>

  <p>To a passing nurse, the two youngsters would have seemed absorbed in
  hospital business. Martin stood at the door, she by her scrubbing pail. She
  had reassumed her turban; its bagginess obscured her bright hair.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm a Junior medic in Mohalis. But&mdash;I don't know. I'm not much
  of a medic. I like the lab side. I think I'll be a bacteriologist, and raise
  Cain with some of the fool theories of immunology. And I don't think much of
  the bedside manner."</p>

  <p>"I glad you don't. You get it here. You ought to hear some of the docs
  that are the sweetest old pussies with their patients&mdash;the way they bawl
  out the nurses. But labs&mdash;they seem sort of real. I don't suppose you
  can bluff a bacteria&mdash;what is it?&mdash;bacterium?"</p>

  <p>"No, they're&mdash;What do they call you?"</p>

  <p>"Me? Oh, it's an idiotic name&mdash;Leora Tozer."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with Leora? It's fine."</p>

  <p>Sound of mating birds, sound of spring blossoms dropping in the tranquil
  air, the bark of sleepy dogs at midnight; who is to set them down and make
  them anything but hackneyed? And as natural, as conventional, as youthfully
  gauche, as eternally beautiful and authentic as those ancient sounds was the
  talk of Martin and Leora in that passionate half-hour when each found in the
  other a part of his own self, always vaguely missed, discovered now with
  astonished joy. They rattled like hero and heroine of a sticky tale, like
  sweat-shop operatives, like bouncing rustics, like prince and princess. Their
  words were silly and inconsequential, heard one by one, yet taken together
  they were as wise and important as the tides or the sounding wind.</p>

  <p>He told her that he admired Max Gottlieb, that he had crossed her North
  Dakota on a train, and that he was an excellent hockey-player. She told him
  that she "adored" vaudeville, that her father, Andrew Jackson Tozer, was born
  in the East (by which she meant Illinois), and that she didn't particularly
  care for nursing. She had no especial personal ambition; she had come here
  because she liked adventure. She hinted, with debonair regret, that she was
  not too popular with the superintendent of nurses; she meant to be good but
  somehow she was always dragged into rebellions connected with midnight fudge
  or elopements. There was nothing heroic in her story but from her placid way
  of telling it he had an impression of gay courage.</p>

  <p>He interrupted with an urgent, "When can you get away from the hospital
  for dinner? Tonight?"</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Please!"</p>

  <p>"All right."</p>

  <p>"When can I call for you?"</p>

  <p>"Do you think I ought to&mdash;Well, seven."</p>

  <p>All the way back to Mohalis he alternately raged and rejoiced. He informed
  himself that he was a moron to make this long trip into Zenith twice in one
  day; he remembered that he was engaged to a girl called Madeline Fox; he
  worried the matter of unfaithfulness; he asserted that Leora Tozer was merely
  an imitation nurse who was as illiterate as a kitchen wench and as
  impertinent as a newsboy; he decided, several times he decided, to telephone
  her and free himself from the engagement.</p>

  <p>He was at the hospital at a quarter to seven.</p>

  <p>He had to wait for twenty minutes in a reception-room like that of an
  undertaker. He was in a panic. What was he doing here? She'd probably be
  agonizingly dull, through a whole long dinner. Would he even recognize her,
  in mufti? Then he leaped up. She was at the door. Her sulky blue uniform was
  gone; she was childishly slim and light in a princess frock that was a
  straight line from high collar and soft young breast to her feet. It seemed
  natural to tuck her hand under his arm as they left the hospital. She moved
  beside him with a little dancing step, shyer now than she had been in the
  dignity of her job but looking up at him with confidence.</p>

  <p>"Glad I came?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>She thought it over. She had a trick of gravely thinking over obvious
  questions; and gravely (but with the gravity of a child, not the ponderous
  gravity of a politician or an office-manager) she admitted, "Yes, I am glad.
  I was afraid you'd go and get sore at me because I was so fresh, and I wanted
  to apologize and&mdash;I liked your being so crazy about your bacteriology. I
  think I'm a little crazy, too. The interns here&mdash;they come bothering
  around a lot, but they're so sort of&mdash;so sort of <i>soggy</i>, with
  their new stethoscopes and their brand-new dignity. Oh&mdash;" Most gravely
  of all: "Oh, gee, yes, I'm glad you came...Am I an idiot to admit it?"</p>

  <p>"You're a darling to admit it." He was a little dizzy with her. He pressed
  her hand with his arm.</p>

  <p>"You won't think I let every medic and doctor pick me up, will you?"</p>

  <p>"Leora! And you don't think I try and pick up every pretty girl I meet? I
  liked&mdash;I felt somehow we two could be chums. Can't we? Can't we?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. We'll see. Where are we going for dinner?"</p>

  <p>"The Grand Hotel."</p>

  <p>"We are not! It's terribly expensive. Unless you're awfully rich. You
  aren't, are you?"</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not. Just enough money to get through medic school. But I
  want&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Let's go to the Bijou. It's a nice place, and it isn't expensive."</p>

  <p>He remembered how often Madeline Fox had hinted that it would be a tasty
  thing to go to the Grand, Zenith's most resplendent hotel, but that was the
  last time he thought of Madeline that evening. He was absorbed in Leora. He
  found in her a casualness, a lack of prejudice, a directness, surprising in
  the daughter of Andrew Jackson Tozer. She was feminine but undemanding; she
  was never Improving and rarely shocked; she was neither flirtatious nor cold.
  She was indeed the first girl to whom he had ever talked without
  self-consciousness. It is doubtful if Leora herself had a chance to say
  anything, for he poured out his every confidence as a disciple of Gottlieb.
  To Madeline, Gottlieb was a wicked old man who made fun of the sanctities of
  Marriage and Easter lilies, to Clif, he was a bore, but Leora glowed as
  Martin banged the table and quoted his idol: "Up to the present, even in the
  work of Ehrlich, most research has been largely a matter of trial and error,
  the empirical method, which is the opposite of the scientific method, by
  which one seeks to establish a general law governing a group of phenomena so
  that he may predict what will happen."</p>

  <p>He intoned it reverently, staring across the table at her, almost glaring
  at her. He insisted, "Do you see where he leaves all these detail-grubbing,
  machine-made researchers buzzing in the manure heap just as much as he does
  the commercial docs? Do you get him? Do you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think I do. Anyway, I get your enthusiasm for him. But please
  don't bully me so!"</p>

  <p>"Was I bullying? I didn't mean to. Only, when I get to thinking about the
  way most of these damned profs don't even know what he's up to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Martin was off again, and if Leora did not altogether understand the
  relation of the synthesis of antibodies to the work of Arrhenius, yet she
  listened with comfortable pleasure in his zeal, with none of Madeline Fox's
  gently corrective admonitions.</p>

  <p>She had to warn him that she must be at the hospital by ten.</p>

  <p>"I've talked too much! Lord, I hope I haven't bored you," he blurted.</p>

  <p>"I loved it."</p>

  <p>"And I was so technical, and so noisy&mdash;Oh, I <i>am</i> a chump!"</p>

  <p>"I like having you trust me. I'm not 'earnest,' and I haven't any brains
  whatever, but I do love it when my menfolks think I'm intelligent enough to
  hear what they really think and&mdash;Good night!"</p>

  <p>They dined together twice in two weeks, and only twice in that time,
  though she telephoned to him, did Martin see his honest affianced,
  Madeline.</p>

  <p>He came to know all of Leora's background. Her bed-ridden grand-aunt in
  Zenith, who was her excuse for coming so far to take hospital training. The
  hamlet of Wheatsylvania, North Dakota; one street of shanties with the red
  grain-elevators at the end. Her father, Andrew Jackson Tozer, sometimes known
  as Jackass Tozer; owner of the bank, of the creamery, and an elevator,
  therefore the chief person in town; pious at Wednesday evening
  prayer-meeting, fussing over every penny he gave to Leora or her mother. Bert
  Tozer, her brother; squirrel teeth, a gold eye-glass chain over his ear,
  cashier and all the rest of the staff in the one-room bank owned by his
  father. The chicken salad and coffee suppers at the United Brethren Church;
  German Lutheran farmers singing ancient Teutonic hymns; the Hollanders, the
  Bohemians and Poles. And round about the village, the living wheat, arched
  above by tremendous clouds. He saw Leora, always an "odd child," doing
  obediently enough the flat household tasks but keeping snug the belief that
  some day she would find a youngster with whom, in whatever danger or poverty,
  she would behold all the colored world.</p>

  <p>It was at the end of her hesitating effort to make him see her childhood
  that he cried, "Darling, you don't have to tell me about you. I've always
  known you. I'm not going to let you go, no matter what. You're going to marry
  me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>They said it with clasping hands, confessing eyes, in that blatant
  restaurant. Her first words were:</p>

  <p>"I want to call you 'Sandy.' Why do I? I don't know why. You're as unsandy
  as can be, but somehow 'Sandy' means you to me and&mdash;Oh, my dear, I do
  like you!"</p>

  <p>Martin went home engaged to two girls at once.</p><br>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">He had promised to see Madeline the next morning.</p>

  <p>By any canon of respectable behavior he should have felt like a low dog;
  he assured himself that he must feel like a low dog; but he could not bring
  it off. He thought of Madeline's pathetic enthusiasms: her "Provencal
  pleasaunce" and the limp-leather volumes of poetry which she patted with fond
  finger-tips; of the tie she had bought for him, and her pride in his hair
  when he brushed it like the patent-leather heroes in magazine illustrations.
  He mourned that he had sinned against loyalty. But his agitation broke
  against the solidity of his union with Leora. Her companionship released his
  soul. Even when, as advocate for Madeline, he pleaded that Leora was a
  trivial young woman who probably chewed gum in private and certainly was
  careless about her nails in public, her commonness was dear to the commonness
  that was in himself, valid as ambition or reverence, an earthy base to her
  gaiety as it was to his nervous scientific curiosity.</p>

  <p>He was absent-minded in the laboratory, that fatal next day. Gottlieb had
  twice to ask him whether he had prepared the new batch of medium, and
  Gottlieb was an autocrat, sterner with his favorites than with the ruck of
  students. He snarled, "Arrowsmith, you are a moon-calf! My God, am I to spend
  my life with Dummkopfe? I cannot be always alone, Martin! Are you going to
  fail me? Two, three days now you haf not been keen about work."</p>

  <p>Martin went off mumbling, "I love that man!" In his tangled mood he
  catalogued Madeline's pretenses, her nagging, her selfishness, her
  fundamental ignorance. He worked himself up to a state of virtue in which it
  was agreeably clear to him that he must throw Madeline over, entirely as a
  rebuke. He went to her in the evening prepared to blaze out at her first
  complaining, to forgive her finally, but to break their engagement and make
  life resolutely simple again.</p>

  <p>She did not complain.</p>

  <p>She ran to him. "Dear, you're so tired&mdash;your eyes look tired. Have
  you been working frightfully hard? I've been so sorry you couldn't come
  'round, this week. Dear, you mustn't kill yourself. Think of all the years
  you have ahead to do splendid things in. No, don't talk. I want you to rest.
  Mother's gone to the movies. Sit here. See, I'll make you so comfy with these
  pillows. Just lean back&mdash;go to sleep if you want to&mdash;and I'll read
  you 'The Crock of Gold.' You'll love it."</p>

  <p>He was determined that he would not love it and, as he probably had no
  sense of humor whatever, it is doubtful whether he appreciated it, but its
  differentness aroused him. Though Madeline's voice was shrill and
  cornfieldish after Leora's lazy softness, she read so eagerly that he was
  sick ashamed of his intention to hurt her. He saw that it was she, with her
  pretenses, who was the child, and the detached and fearless Leora who was
  mature, mistress of a real world. The reproofs with which he had planned to
  crush her vanished.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she was beside him, begging, "I've been so lonely for you, all
  week!"</p>

  <p>So he was a traitor to both women, it was Leora who had intolerably roused
  him; it was really Leora whom he was caressing now; but it was Madeline who
  took his hunger to herself, and when she whimpered, "I'm so glad you're glad
  to be here," he could say nothing. He wanted to talk about Leora, to shout
  about Leora, to exult in her, his woman. He dragged out a few sound but
  unimpassioned flatteries; he observed that Madeline was a handsome young
  woman and a sound English scholar; and while she gaped with disappointment at
  his lukewarmness, he got himself away, at ten. He had finally succeeded very
  well indeed in feeling like a low dog.</p>

  <p>He hastened to Clif Clawson.</p>

  <p>He had told Clif nothing about Leora. He resented Clif's probable
  scoffing. He thought well of himself for the calmness with which he came into
  their room. Clif was sitting on the small of his back, shoeless feet upon the
  study table, reading a Sherlock Holmes story which rested on the powerful
  volume of Osler's Medicine which he considered himself to be reading.</p>

  <p>"Clif! Want a drink. Tired. Let's sneak down to Barney's and see if we can
  rustle one."</p>

  <p>"Thou speakest as one having tongues and who putteth the speed behind the
  ole rhombencephalon comprising the cerebellum and the medulla oblongata."</p>

  <p>"Oh, cut out the Cuteness! I'm in a bad temper."</p>

  <p>"Ah, the laddie has been having a scrap with his chaste lil Madeline! Was
  she horrid to ickly Martykins? All right. I'll quit. Come on. Yoicks for the
  drink."</p>

  <p>He told three new stories about Professor Robertshaw, all of them
  scurrilous and most of them untrue, on their way, and he almost coaxed Martin
  into cheerfulness. "Barney's" was a poolroom, a tobacco shop and, since
  Mohalis was dry by local option, an admirable blind-pig. Clif and the
  hairy-handed Barney greeted each other in a high and worthy manner:</p>

  <p>"The benisons of eventide to you, Barney. May your circulation proceed
  unchecked and particularly the dorsal carpal branch of the ulnar artery, in
  which connection, comrade, Prof. Dr. Col. Egbert Arrowsmith and I would fain
  trifle with another bottle of that renowned strawberry pop."</p>

  <p>"Gosh, Clif, you cer'nly got a swell line of jaw-music. If I ever need a'
  arm amputated when you get to be a doc, I'll come around and let you talk it
  off. Strawberry pop, gents?"</p>

  <p>The front room of Barney's was an impressionistic painting in which a
  pool-table, piles of cigarettes, chocolate bars, playing cards, and pink
  sporting papers were jumbled in chaos. The back room was simpler: cases of
  sweet and thinly flavored soda, a large ice-box, and two small tables with
  broken chairs. Barney poured, from a bottle plainly marked Ginger Ale, two
  glasses of powerful and appalling raw whiskey, and Clif and Martin took them
  to the table in the corner. The effect was swift. Martin's confused sorrows
  turned to optimism. He told Clif that he was going to write a book exposing
  idealism, but what he meant was that he was going to do something clever
  about his dual engagement. He had it! He would invite Leora and Madeline to
  lunch together, tell them the truth, and see which of them loved him. He
  whooped, and had another whiskey; he told Clif that he was a fine fellow, and
  Barney that he was a public benefactor, and unsteadily he retired to the
  telephone, which was shut off from public hearing in a closet.</p>

  <p>At the Zenith General Hospital he got the night superintendent, and the
  night Superintendent was a man frosty and suspicious. "This is no time to be
  calling up a probationer! Half-past eleven! Who are you, anyway?"</p>

  <p>Martin checked the "I'll damn' soon tell you who I am!" which was his
  natural reaction, and explained that he was speaking for Leora's invalid
  grand-aunt, that the poor old lady was very low, and if the night
  superintendent cared to take upon himself the murder of a blameless
  gentlewoman&mdash;</p>

  <p>When Leora came to the telephone he said quickly, and soberly now, feeling
  as though he had come from the menace of thronging strangers into the
  security of her presence:</p>

  <p>"Leora? Sandy. Meet me Grand lobby tomorrow, twelve-thirty. Must!
  Important! Fix 't somehow&mdash;your aunt's sick."</p>

  <p>"All right, dear. G' night," was all she said.</p>

  <p>It took him long minutes to get an answer from Madeline's flat, then Mrs.
  Fox's voice sounded, sleepily, quaveringly:</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes?"</p>

  <p>"'S Martin."</p>

  <p>"Who is it? Who is it? What is it? Are you calling the Fox apartment?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes! Mrs. Fox, it's Martin Arrowsmith speaking."</p>

  <p>"Oh, oh, my dear! The 'phone woke me out of a sound sleep, and I couldn't
  make out what you were saying. I was so frightened. I thought maybe it was a
  telegram or something. I thought perhaps something had happened to Maddy's
  brother. What is it, dear? Oh, I do hope nothing's happened!"</p>

  <p>Her confidence in him, the affection of this uprooted old woman bewildered
  in a strange land, overcame him; he lost all his whisky-colored feeling that
  he was a nimble fellow, and in a melancholy way, with all the weight of life
  again upon him, he sighed that no, nothing had happened, but he'd forgotten
  to tell Madeline something&mdash;so shor&mdash;so sorry call so
  late&mdash;could he speak Mad just minute&mdash;</p>

  <p>Then Madeline was bubbling, "Why, Marty dear, what is it? I do hope
  nothing has happened! Why, dear, you just left here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Listen, d-dear. Forgot to tell you. There's a&mdash;there's a great
  friend of mine in Zenith that I want you to meet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who is he?"</p>

  <p>"You'll see tomorrow. Listen, I want you come in and meet&mdash;come meet
  um at lunch. Going," with ponderous jocularity, "going to blow you all to a
  swell feed at the Grand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, how nice!"</p>

  <p>"&mdash;so I want you to meet me at the eleven-forty interurban, at
  College Square. Can you?"</p>

  <p>Vaguely, "Oh, I'd love to but&mdash;I have an eleven o'clock, and I don't
  like to cut it, and I promised May Harmon to go shopping with her&mdash;she's
  looking for some kind of shoes that you can wear with her pink crepe de chine
  but that you can walk in&mdash;and we sort of thought maybe we might lunch at
  Ye Kollege Karavanserai&mdash;and I'd half planned to go to the movies with
  her or somebody, Mother says that new Alaska film is simply dandy, she saw it
  tonight, and I thought I might go see it before they take it off, though
  Heaven knows I ought to come right home and study and not go anywhere at
  all&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Now <i>listen!</i> It's important. Don't you trust me? Will you come or
  not?"</p>

  <p>"Why, of course I trust you, dear. All right, I'll try to be there. The
  eleven-forty?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"At College Square? Or at Bluthman's Book Shop?"</p>

  <p>"<i>At College Square</i>!"</p>

  <p>Her gentle "I trust you" and her wambling "I'll try to" were warring in
  his ears as he plunged out of the suffocating cell and returned to Clif.</p>

  <p>"What's the grief?" Clif wondered. "Wife passed away? Or did the Giants
  win in the ninth? Barney, our wandering-boy-tonight looks like a necropsy.
  Slip him another strawberry pop, quick. Say, Doctor, I think you better call
  a physician."</p>

  <p>"Oh, shut up," was all Martin had to say, and that without conviction.
  Before telephoning he had been full of little brightnesses; he had praised
  Clif's pool-playing and called Barney "old Cimex lectularius"; but now, while
  the affectionate Clif worked on him, he sat brooding save when he grumbled
  (with a return of self-satisfaction), "If you knew all the troubles I
  have&mdash;all the doggone mess a fellow can get into&mdash;<i>you'd</i> feel
  down in the mouth!"</p>

  <p>Clif was alarmed. "Look here, old socks. If you've gotten in debt, I'll
  raise the cash, somehow. If it's&mdash;Been going a little too far with
  Madeline?"</p>

  <p>"You make me sick! You've got a dirty mind. I'm not worthy to touch
  Madeline's hand. I regard her with nothing but respect."</p>

  <p>"The hell you do! But never mind, if you say so. Gosh, wish there was
  <i>something</i> I could do for you. Oh! Have 'nother shot! Barney! Come
  a-runnin'!"</p>

  <p>By several drinks Martin was warmed into a hazy carelessness, and Clif
  solicitously dragged him home after he had desired to fight three large
  academic sophomores. But in the morning he awoke with a crackling skull and a
  realization that he was going to face Leora and Madeline at lunch.</p><br>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="first">His half-hour journey with Madeline into Zenith seemed a
  visible and oppressing thing, like a tornado cloud. He had not merely to get
  through each minute as it came; the whole grim thirty minutes were present at
  the same time. While he was practicing the tactful observation he was going
  to present two minutes from now, he could still hear the clumsy thing he had
  said two minutes before. He fought to keep her attention from the "great
  friend of his" whom they were to meet. With fatuous beaming he described a
  night at Barney's; without any success whatever he tried to be funny; and
  when Madeline lectured him on the evils of liquor and the evils of
  association with immoral persons, he was for once relieved. But he could not
  sidetrack her.</p>

  <p>"Who is this man we're going to see? What are you so mysterious about? Oh,
  Martin, is it a joke? Aren't we going to meet anybody? Did you just want to
  run away from Mama for a while and we have a bat at the Grand together? Oh,
  what fun! I've always wanted to lunch at the Grand. Of course I do think it's
  too sort of rococo, but still, it is impressive, and&mdash;Did I guess it,
  darling?"</p>

  <p>"No, there's someone&mdash;Oh, we're going to meet somebody, all
  right!"</p>

  <p>"Then why don't you tell me who he is? Honestly, Mart, you make me
  impatient."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll tell you. It isn't a Him; it's a Her."</p>

  <p>"Oh!"</p>

  <p>"It's&mdash;You know my work takes me to the hospitals, and some of the
  nurses at Zenith General have been awfully helpful." He was panting. His eyes
  ached. Since the torture of the coming lunch was inevitable, he wondered why
  he should go on trying to resist his punishment. "Especially there's one
  nurse there who's a wonder. She's learned so much about the care of the sick,
  and she puts me onto a lot of good stunts, and she seems like a nice
  girl&mdash;Miss Tozer, her name is&mdash;I think her first name is Lee or
  something like that&mdash;and she's so&mdash;her father is one of the big men
  in North Dakota&mdash;awfully rich&mdash;big banker&mdash;I guess she just
  took up nursing to do her share in the world's work." He had achieved
  Madeline's own tone of poetic uplift. "I thought you two might like to know
  each other. You remember you were saying how few girls there are in Mohalis
  that really appreciate&mdash;appreciate ideals."</p>

  <p>"Ye-es." Madeline gazed at something far away and, whatever it was, she
  did not like it. "I shall be ver' pleased to meet her, of course. <i>any</i>
  friend of yours&mdash;Oh, Mart! I do hope you don't flirt; I hope you don't
  get too friendly with all these nurses. I don't know anything about it, of
  course, but I keep hearing how some of these nurses are regular
  man-hunters."</p>

  <p>"Well, let me tell you right now, Leora isn't!"</p>

  <p>"No, I'm sure, but&mdash;Oh, Martykins, you won't be silly and let these
  nurses just amuse themselves with you? I mean, for your own sake. They have
  such an advantage. Poor Madeline, she wouldn't be allowed to go hanging
  around men's rooms learning&mdash;things, and you think you're so
  psychological, Mart, but honestly, any smart woman can twist you around her
  finger."</p>

  <p>"Well, I guess I can take care of myself!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I mean&mdash;I don't mean&mdash;But I do hope this Tozer
  person&mdash;I'm sure I shall like her, if you do, but&mdash;I am your own
  true love, aren't I, always!"</p>

  <p>She, the proper, ignored the passengers as she clasped his hand. She
  sounded so frightened that his anger at her reflections on Leora turned into
  misery. Incidentally, her thumb was gouging painfully into the back of his
  hand. He tried to look tender as he protested, "Sure&mdash;sure&mdash;gosh,
  honest, Mad, look out. The old duffer across the aisle is staring at us."</p>

  <p>For whatever infidelities he might ever commit he was adequately punished
  before they had reached the Grand Hotel.</p>

  <p>The Grand was, in 1907, the best hotel in Zenith. It was compared by
  traveling salesmen to the Parker House, the Palmer House, the West Hotel. It
  has been humbled since by the supercilious modesty of the vast Hotel
  Thornleigh; dirty now is its tessellated floor and all the wild gilt
  tarnished, and in its ponderous leather chairs are torn seams and stogie
  ashes and horse-dealers. But in its day it was the proudest inn between
  Chicago and Pittsburgh; an oriental palace, the entrance a score of brick
  Moorish arches, the lobby towering from a black and white marble floor, up
  past gilt iron balconies, to the green, pink, pearl, and amber skylight seven
  stories above.</p>

  <p>They found Leora in the lobby, tiny on an enormous couch built round a
  pillar. She stared at Madeline, quiet, waiting. Martin perceived that Leora
  was unusually sloppy&mdash;his own word. It did not matter to him how
  clumsily her honey-colored hair was tucked under her black hat, a
  characterless little mushroom of a hat, but he did see and resent the
  contrast between her shirtwaist, with the third button missing, her checked
  skirt, her unfortunate bright brown bolero jacket, and Madeline's sleekness
  of blue serge. The resentment was not toward Leora. Scanning them together
  (not haughtily, as the choosing and lofty male, but anxiously) he was more
  irritated than ever by Madeline. That she should be better dressed was an
  affront. His affection flew to guard Leora, to wrap and protect her.</p>

  <p>And all the while he was bumbling:</p>

  <p>"&mdash;thought you two girls ought to know each other&mdash;Miss Fox,
  want t' make you 'quainted with Miss Tozer&mdash;little
  celebration&mdash;lucky dog have two Queens of Sheba&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And to himself, "Oh, hell!"</p>

  <p>While they murmured nothing in particular to each other he herded them
  into the famous dining-room of the Grand. It was full of gilt chandeliers,
  red plush chairs, heavy silverware, and aged Negro retainers with gold and
  green waistcoats. Round the walls ran select views of Pompeii, Venice, Lake
  Como, and Versailles.</p>

  <p>"Swell room!" chirped Leora.</p>

  <p>Madeline had looked as though she intended to say the same thing in longer
  words, but she considered the frescoes all over again and explained, "Well,
  it's very large&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was ordering, with agony. He had appropriated four dollars for the
  orgy, strictly including the tip, and his standard of good food was that he
  must spend every cent of the four dollars. While he wondered what "Puree St.
  Germain" could be, and the waiter hideously stood watching behind his
  shoulder, Madeline fell to. She chanted with horrifying politeness:</p>

  <p>"Mr. Arrowsmith tells me you are a nurse, Miss&mdash;Tozer."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sort of."</p>

  <p>"Do you find it interesting?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;yes&mdash;yes, I think it's interesting."</p>

  <p>"I suppose it must be wonderful to relieve suffering. Of course my
  work&mdash;I'm taking my Doctor of Philosophy degree in English&mdash;" She
  made it sound as though she were taking her earldom&mdash;"it's rather dry
  and detached. I have to master the growth of the language and so on and so
  forth. With your practical training, I suppose you'd find that rather
  stupid."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it must be&mdash;no, it must be very interesting."</p>

  <p>"Do you come from Zenith, Miss&mdash;Tozer?"</p>

  <p>"No, I come from&mdash;Just a little town. Well, hardly a town...North
  Dakota."</p>

  <p>"Oh! North Dakota!"</p>

  <p>"Yes...Way West."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes...Are you staying East for some time?" It was precisely what a
  much-resented New York cousin had once said to Madeline.</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't&mdash;Yes, I guess I may be here quite some time."</p>

  <p>"Do you, uh, do you find you like it here?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, it's pretty nice. These big cities&mdash;So much to see."</p>

  <p>"'Big'? Well, I suppose it all depends on the point of view,
  <i>doesn't</i> it? I always think of New York as big but&mdash;Of
  course&mdash;Do you find the contrast to North Dakota interesting?"</p>

  <p>"Well, of course it's different."</p>

  <p>"Tell me what North Dakota's like. I've always wondered about these
  Western states." It was Madeline's second plagiarism of her cousin. "What is
  the general impression it makes on you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think I know just how you mean."</p>

  <p>"I mean what is the general effect? The&mdash;<i>impression</i>."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's got lots of wheat and lots of Swedes."</p>

  <p>"But I mean&mdash;I suppose you're all terribly virile and energetic,
  compared with us Easterners."</p>

  <p>"I don't&mdash;Well, yes, maybe."</p>

  <p>"Have you met lots of people in Zenith?"</p>

  <p>"Not so <i>awfully</i> many."</p>

  <p>"Oh, have you met Dr. Birchall, that operates in your hospital? He's such
  a nice man, and not just a good surgeon but frightfully talented. He sings
  won-derfully, and he comes from the most frightfully nice family."</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think I've met him yet," Leora bleated.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you must. And he plays the slickest&mdash;the most gorgeous game of
  tennis. He always goes to all these millionaire parties on Royal Ridge.
  Frightfully smart."</p>

  <p>Martin now first interrupted. "Smart? Him? He hasn't got any brains
  whatever."</p>

  <p>"My dear child, I didn't mean 'smart' in that sense!" He sat alone and
  helpless while she again turned on Leora and ever more brightly inquired
  whether Leora knew this son of a corporation lawyer and that famous
  debutante, this hatshop and that club. She spoke familiarly of what were
  known as the Leaders of Zenith Society, the personages who appeared daily in
  the society columns of the Advocate-Times, the Cowxes and Van Antrims and
  Dodsworths. Martin was astonished by the familiarity; he remembered that she
  had once gone to a charity ball in Zenith but he had not known that she was
  so intimate with the peerage. Certainly Leora had appallingly never heard of
  these great ones, nor even attended the concerts, the lectures, the recitals
  at which Madeline apparently spent all her glittering evenings.</p>

  <p>Madeline shrugged a little, then, "Well&mdash;Of course with the
  fascinating doctors and everybody that you meet in the hospital, I suppose
  you'd find lectures frightfully tame. Well&mdash;" She dismissed Leora and
  looked patronizingly at Martin. "Are you planning some more work on the
  what-is-it with rabbits?"</p>

  <p>He was grim. He could do it now, if he got it over quickly. "Madeline!
  Brought you two together because&mdash;Don't know whether you cotton to each
  other or not, but I wish you could, because I've&mdash;I'm not making any
  excuses for myself. I couldn't help it. I'm engaged to both of you, and I
  want to know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Madeline had sprung up. She had never looked quite so proud and fine. She
  stared at them, and walked away, wordless. She came back, she touched Leora's
  shoulder, and quietly kissed her. "Dear, I'm sorry for you. You've got a job!
  You poor baby!" She strode away, her shoulders straight.</p>

  <p>Hunched, frightened, Martin could not look at Leora.</p>

  <p>He felt her hand on his. He looked up. She was smiling, easy, a little
  mocking. "Sandy, I warn you that I'm never going to give you up. I suppose
  you're as bad as She says; I suppose I'm foolish&mdash;I'm a hussy. But
  you're mine! I warn you it isn't a bit of use your getting engaged to
  somebody else again. I'd tear her eyes out! Now don't think so well of
  yourself! I guess you're pretty selfish. But I don't care. You're mine!"</p>

  <p>He said brokenly many things beautiful in their commonness.</p>

  <p>She pondered, "I do feel we're nearer together than you and Her. Perhaps
  you like me better because you can bully me&mdash;because I tag after you and
  She never would. And I know your work is more important to you than I am,
  maybe more important than you are. But I am stupid and ordinary and She
  isn't. I simply admire you frightfully (Heaven knows why, but I do), while
  She has sense enough to make you admire Her and tag after Her."</p>

  <p>"No! I swear it isn't because I can bully you, Leora&mdash;I swear it
  isn't&mdash;I don't think it is. Dearest, don't <i>don't</i> think she's
  brighter than you are. She's glib but&mdash;Oh, let's stop talking! I've
  found you! My life's begun!"</p>

     name="ch7">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">The difference between Martin's relations to Madeline and to
  Leora was the difference between a rousing duel and a serene comradeship.
  From their first evening, Leora and he depended on each other's loyalty and
  liking, and certain things in his existence were settled forever. Yet his
  absorption in her was not stagnant. He was always making discoveries about
  the observations of life which she kept incubating in her secret little head
  while she made smoke rings with her cigarettes and smiled silently. He longed
  for the girl Leora; she stirred him, and with gay frank passion she answered
  him; but to another, sexless Leora he talked more honestly than to Gottlieb
  or his own worried self, while with her boyish nod or an occasional word she
  encouraged him to confidence in his evolving ambition and disdains.</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">Digamma Pi fraternity was giving a dance. It was understood
  among the anxiously whispering medics that so cosmopolitan was the University
  of Winnemac becoming that they were expected to wear the symbols of
  respectability known as "dress-suits." On the solitary and nervous occasion
  when Martin had worn evening clothes he had rented them from the Varsity
  Pantorium, but he must own them, now that he was going to introduce Leora to
  the world as his pride and flowering. Like two little old people, absorbed in
  each other and diffidently exploring new, unwelcoming streets of the city
  where their alienated children live, Martin and Leora edged into the
  garnished magnificence of Benson, Hanley and Koch's, the loftiest department
  store in Zenith. She was intimidated by the luminous cases of mahogany and
  plate glass, by the opera hats and lustrous mufflers and creamy riding
  breeches. When he had tried on a dinner suit and come out for her approval,
  his long brown tie and soft-collared shirt somewhat rustic behind the low
  evening waistcoat, and when the clerk had gone to fetch collars, she
  wailed:</p>

  <p>"Darn it, Sandy, you're too grand for me. I just simply can't get myself
  to fuss over my clothes, and here you're going to go and look so spiffy I
  won't have a chance with you."</p>

  <p>He almost kissed her.</p>

  <p>The clerk, returning, warbled, "I think, Modom, you'll find that your
  husband will look vurry nice indeed in these wing collars."</p>

  <p>Then, while the clerk sought ties, he did kiss her, and she sighed:</p>

  <p>"Oh, gee, you're one of these people that get ahead. I never thought I'd
  have to live up to a man with a dress-suit and a come-to-Heaven collar. Oh,
  well, I'll tag!"</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">For the Digamma Ball, the University Armory was extremely
  decorated. The brick walls were dizzy with bunting, spotty with paper
  chrysanthemums and plaster skulls and wooden scalpels ten feet long.</p>

  <p>In six years at Mohalis, Martin had gone to less than a score of dances,
  though the refined titillations of communal embracing were the chief delight
  of the co-educational university. When he arrived at the Armory, with Leora
  timorously brave in a blue crepe de chine made in no recognized style, he did
  not care whether he had a single two-step, though he did achingly desire to
  have the men crowd in and ask Leora, admire her and make her welcome. Yet he
  was too proud to introduce her about, lest he seem to be begging his friends
  to dance with her. They stood alone, under the balcony, disconsolately facing
  the vastness of the floor, while beyond them flashed the current of dancers,
  beautiful, formidable, desirable. Leora and he had assured each other that,
  for a student affair, dinner jacket and black waistcoat would be the thing,
  as stated in the Benson, Hanley and Koch Chart of Correct Gents' Wearing
  Apparel, but he grew miserable at the sight of voluptuous white waistcoats,
  and when that embryo famous surgeon, Angus Duer, came by, disdainful as a
  greyhound and pushing on white gloves (which are the whitest, the most
  superciliously white objects on earth), then Martin felt himself a
  hobbledehoy.</p>

  <p>"Come on, <i>we'll</i> dance," he said, as though it were a defiance to
  all Angus Duers.</p>

  <p>He very much wanted to go home.</p>

  <p>He did not enjoy the dance, though she waltzed easily and himself not too
  badly. He did not even enjoy having her in his arms. He could not believe
  that she was in his arms. As they revolved he saw Duer join a brilliance of
  pretty girls and distinguished-looking women about the great Dr. Silva, dean
  of the medical school. Angus seemed appallingly at home, and he waltzed off
  with the prettiest girl, sliding, swinging, deft. Martin tried to hate him as
  a fool, but he remembered that yesterday Angus had been elected to the
  honorary society of Sigma Xi.</p>

  <p>Leora and he crept back to the exact spot beneath the balcony where they
  had stood before, to their den, their one safe refuge. While he tried to be
  nonchalant and talk up to his new clothes, he was cursing the men he saw go
  by laughing with girls, ignoring his Leora.</p>

  <p>"Not many here yet," he fussed. "Pretty soon they'll all be coming, and
  then you'll have lots of dances."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't mind."</p>

  <p>("God, won't somebody come and ask the poor kid?")</p>

  <p>He fretted over his lack of popularity among the dancing-men of the
  medical school. He wished Clif Clawson were present&mdash;Clif liked any sort
  of assembly, but he could not afford dress-clothes. Then, rejoicing as at
  sight of the best-beloved, he saw Irving Watters, that paragon of
  professional normality, wandering toward them, but Watters passed by, merely
  nodding. Thrice Martin hoped and desponded, and now all his pride was gone.
  If Leora could be happy&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't care a hoot if she fell for the gabbiest fusser in the whole
  U., and gave me the go-by all evening. Anything to let her have a good time!
  If I could coax Duer over&mdash;No, that's one thing I couldn't stand:
  crawling to that dirty snob&mdash;I will!"</p>

  <p>Up ambled Fatty Pfaff, just arrived. Martin pounced on him lovingly.
  "H'lo, old Fat! You a stag tonight? Meet my friend Miss Tozer."</p>

  <p>Fatty's bulbous eyes showed approval of Leora's cheeks and amber hair. He
  heaved, "Pleasedmeetch&mdash;dance starting&mdash;have the honor?" in so
  flattering a manner that Martin could have kissed him.</p>

  <p>That he himself stood alone through the dance did not occur to him. He
  leaned against a pillar and gloated. He felt gorgeously unselfish...That
  various girl wallflowers were sitting near him, waiting to be asked, did not
  occur to him either.</p>

  <p>He saw Fatty introduce Leora to a decorative pair of Digams, one of whom
  begged her for the next. Thereafter she had more invitations than she could
  take. Martin's excitement cooled. It seemed to him that she clung too closely
  to her partners, that she followed their steps too eagerly. After the fifth
  dance he was agitated. "Course! <i>she's</i> enjoying herself! Hasn't got
  time to notice that I just stand here&mdash;yes, by thunder, and hold her
  scarf! Sure! Fine for her. Fact I might like a little dancing
  myself&mdash;And the way she grins and gawps at that fool Brindle Morgan,
  the&mdash;the&mdash;the damnedest&mdash;Oh, you and I are going to have a
  talk, young woman! And those hounds trying to pinch her off me&mdash;the one
  thing I've ever loved! Just because they dance better than I can, and spiel a
  lot of foolishness&mdash;And that damn' orchestra playing that damn' peppery
  music&mdash;And she falling for all their damn' cheap compliments
  and&mdash;You and I are going to have one lovely little understanding!"</p>

  <p>When she next returned to him, besieged by three capering medics, he
  muttered to her, "Oh, it doesn't <i>matter</i> about <i>me!</i>"</p>

  <p>"Would you like this one? <i>Course</i> you shall have it!" She turned to
  him fully; she had none of Madeline's sense of having to act for the benefit
  of observers. Through a strained eternity of waiting, while he glowered, she
  babbled of the floor, the size of the room, and her "dandy partners." At the
  sound of the music he held out his arms.</p>

  <p>"No," she said. "I want to talk to you." She led him to a corner and
  hurled at him, "Sandy, this is the last time I'm going to stand for your
  looking jealous. Oh, I know! See here! If we're going to stick
  together&mdash;and we are!&mdash;I'm going to dance with just as many men as
  I want to, and I'm going to be just as foolish with 'em as I want to. Dinners
  and those things&mdash;I suppose I'll always go on being a clam. Nothing to
  say. But I love dancing, and I'm going to do exactly what I want to, and if
  you had any sense whatever, you'd know I don't care a hang for anybody but
  you. Yours! Absolute. No matter what fool things you do&mdash;and they'll
  probably be a plenty. So when you go and get jealous on me again, you sneak
  off and get rid of it. Aren't you ashamed of yourself!"</p>

  <p>"I wasn't jealous&mdash;Yes, I was. Oh, I can't help it! I love you so
  much. I'd be one fine lover, now wouldn't I, if I never got jealous!"</p>

  <p>"All right. Only you've got to keep it under cover. Now we'll finish the
  dance."</p>

  <p>He was her slave.</p><br>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">It was regarded as immoral, at the University of Winnemac,
  to dance after midnight, and at that hour the guests crowded into the
  Imperial Cafeteria. Ordinarily it closed at eight, but tonight it kept open
  till one, and developed a spirit of almost lascivious mirth. Fatty Pfaff did
  a jig, another humorous student, with a napkin over his arm, pretended to be
  a waiter, and a girl (but she was much disapproved) smoked a cigarette.</p>

  <p>At the door Clif Clawson was waiting for Martin and Leora. He was in his
  familiar shiny gray suit, with a blue flannel shirt.</p>

  <p>Clif assumed that he was the authority to whom all of Martin's friends
  must be brought for judgment. He had not met Leora. Martin had confessed his
  double engagement; he had explained that Leora was unquestionably the most
  gracious young woman on earth; but as he had previously used up all of his
  laudatory adjectives and all of Clif's patience on the subject of Madeline,
  Clif failed to listen, and prepared to dislike Leora as another siren of
  morality.</p>

  <p>He eyed her now with patronizing enmity. He croaked at Martin behind her
  back, "Good-looking kid, I will say that for her&mdash;what's wrong with
  her?" When they had brought their own sandwiches and coffee and mosaic cake
  from the long counter, Clif rasped:</p>

  <p>"Well, it's grand of a couple of dress-suit swells like you to assassinate
  with me 'mid the midmosts of sartorials and Sassiety. Gosh, it's fierce I had
  to miss the select pleasures of an evening with Anxious Duer and associated
  highboys, and merely play a low game of poker&mdash;in which Father deftly
  removed the sum of six simolea, point ten, from the fore-gathered bums and
  yahoos. Well, Leory, I suppose you and Martykins here have now ratiocinated
  all these questions of polo and, uh, Monte Carlo and so on."</p>

  <p>She had an immense power of accepting people as they were. While Clif
  waited, leering, she placidly investigated the inside of a chicken sandwich
  and assented, "Um-huh."</p>

  <p>"Good boy! I thought you were going to pull that 'If you are a roughneck,
  I don't see why you think you've got to boast about it' stuff that Mart
  springs on me!"</p>

  <p>Clif turned into a jovial and (for him) unusually quiet
  companion...Ex-farmhand, ex-book-agent, ex-mechanic, he had so little money
  yet so scratching a desire to be resplendent that he took refuge in pride in
  poverty, pride in being offensive. Now, when Leora seemed to look through his
  boasting, he liked her as quickly as had Martin, and they buzzed with gaiety.
  Martin was warmed to benevolence toward mankind, including Angus Duer, who
  was at the end of the room at a table with Dean Silva and his silvery women.
  Without plan, Martin sprang up, raced down the room. Holding out his hand he
  clamored:</p>

  <p>"Angus, old man, want to congratulate you on getting Sigma Xi. That's
  fine."</p>

  <p>Duer regarded the outstretched hand as though it was an instrument which
  he had seen before but whose use he could not quite remember. He picked it up
  and shook it tentatively. He did not turn his back; he was worse than
  rude&mdash;he looked patient.</p>

  <p>"Well, good luck," said Martin, chilled and shaky.</p>

  <p>"Very good of you. Thanks."</p>

  <p>Martin returned to Leora and Clif, to tell them the incident as a cosmic
  tragedy. They agreed that Angus Duer was to be shot. In the midst of it Duer
  came past, trailing after Dean Silva's party, and nodded to Martin, who
  glared back, feeling noble and mature.</p>

  <p>At parting, Clif held Leora's hand and urged, "Honey, I think a lot of
  Mart, and one time I was afraid the old kid was going to get tied up
  to&mdash;to parties that would turn him into a hand-shaker. I'm a hand-shaker
  myself. I know less about medicine than Prof Robertshaw. But this boob has
  some conscience to him, and I'm so darn' glad he's playing around with a girl
  that's real folks and&mdash;Oh, listen at me fallin' all over my clumsy feet!
  But I just mean I hope you won't mind Uncle Clif saying he does by golly like
  you a lot!"</p>

  <p>It was almost four when Martin returned from taking Leora home and sagged
  into bed. He could not sleep. The aloofness of Angus Duer racked him as an
  insult to himself, as somehow an implied insult to Leora, but his boyish rage
  had passed into a bleaker worry. Didn't Duer, for all his snobbishness and
  shallowness, have something that he himself lacked? Didn't Clif, with his
  puppy-dog humor, his speech of a vaudeville farmer, his suspicion of fine
  manners as posing, take life too easily? Didn't Duer know how to control and
  drive his hard little mind? Wasn't there a technique of manners as there was
  of experimentation...Gottlieb's fluent bench-technique versus the clumsy and
  podgy hands of Ira Hinkley...Or was all this inquiry a treachery, a yielding
  to Duer's own affected standard?</p>

  <p>He was so tired that behind his closed eyelids were flashes of fire. His
  whirling mind flew over every sentence he had said or heard that night, till
  round his twisting body there was fevered shouting.</p><br>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="first">As he grumped across the medical campus next day, he came
  unexpectedly upon Angus and he was smitten with the guiltiness and
  embarrassment one has toward a person who has borrowed money and probably
  will not return it. Mechanically he began to blurt "Hello," but he checked it
  in a croak, scowled, and stumbled on.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mart," Angus called. He was dismayingly even. "Remember speaking to
  me last evening? It struck me when I was going out that you looked huffy. I
  was wondering if you thought I'd been rude. I'm sorry if you did. Fact is, I
  had a rotten headache. Look. I've got four tickets for 'As It Listeth,' in
  Zenith, next Friday evening&mdash;original New York cast! Like to see it? And
  I noticed you were with a peach, at the dance. Suppose she might like to go
  along with us, she and some friend of hers?"</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;gosh&mdash;I'll 'phone her&mdash;darn' nice of you to ask
  us&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It was not till melancholy dusk, when Leora had accepted and promised to
  bring with her a probationer-nurse named Nelly Byers, that Martin began to
  brood:</p>

  <p>"Wonder if he did have a headache last night?</p>

  <p>"Wonder if somebody <i>gave</i> him the tickets?</p>

  <p>"Why didn't he ask Dad Silva's daughter to go with us? Does he think Leora
  is some tart I've picked up?</p>

  <p>"Sure, he never really quarrels with anybody&mdash;wants to keep us all
  friendly, so we'll send him surgical patients some day when we're hick G.
  P.'s and he's a Great and Only.</p>

  <p>"Why did I crawl down so meekly?</p>

  <p>"I don't care! If Leora enjoys it&mdash;Me personally, I don't care two
  hoots for all this trotting around&mdash;Though of course it isn't so bad to
  see pretty women in fine clothes, and be dressed as good as anybody&mdash;Oh,
  I don't <i>know!</i>"</p><br>

  <h3>VI.</h3>

  <p class="first">In the slightly Midwestern city of Zenith, the appearance of
  a play "with the original New York cast" was an event. (What Play it was did
  not much matter.) The Dodsworth Theatre was splendid with the aristocracy
  from the big houses on Royal Ridge. Leora and Nelly Byers admired the
  bloods&mdash;graduates of Yale and Harvard and Princeton, lawyers and
  bankers, motor-manufacturers and inheritors of real estate, virtuosi of golf,
  familiars of New York&mdash;who with their shrill and glistening women
  occupied the front rows. Miss Byers pointed out the Dodsworths, who were
  often mentioned in Town Topics.</p>

  <p>Leora and Miss Byers bounced with admiration of the hero when he refused
  the governorship; Martin worried because the heroine was prettier than Leora;
  and Angus Duer (who gave an appearance of knowing all about plays without
  having seen more than half a dozen in his life) admitted that the set
  depicting "Jack Vanduzen's Camp in the Adirondacks: Sunset, the Next Day" was
  really very nice.</p>

  <p>Martin was in a mood of determined hospitality. He was going to give them
  supper and that was all there was to it. Miss Byers explained that they had
  to be in the hospital by a quarter after eleven, but Leora said lazily, "Oh,
  I don't care. I'll slip in through a window. If you're there in the morning,
  the Old Cat can't prove you got in late." Shaking her head at this lying
  wickedness, Miss Byers fled to a trolley car, while Leora, Angus, and Martin
  strolled to Epstein's Alt Nuremberg Cafe for beer and Swiss cheese sandwiches
  flavored by the sight of German drinking mottos and papier-mache armor.</p>

  <p>Angus was studying Leora, looking from her to Martin, watching their
  glances of affection. That a keen young man should make a comrade of a girl
  who could not bring him social advancement, that such a thing as the boy and
  girl passion between Martin and Leora could exist, was probably inconceivable
  to him. He decided that she was conveniently frail. He gave Martin a refined
  version of a leer, and set himself to acquiring her for his own uses.</p>

  <p>"I hope you enjoyed the play," he condescended to her.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Jove, I envy you two. Of course I understand why girls fall for Martin
  here, with his romantic eyes, but a grind like me, I have to go on working
  without a single person to give me sympathy. Oh, well, I deserve it for being
  shy of women."</p>

  <p>With unexpected defiance from Leora: "When anybody says that, it means
  they're not shy, and they despise women."</p>

  <p>"Despise them? Why, child, honestly, I long to be a Don Juan. But I don't
  know how. Won't you give me a lesson?" Angus's aridly correct voice had
  become lulling; he concentrated on Leora as he would have concentrated on
  dissecting a guinea pig. She smiled at Martin now and then to say, "Don't be
  jealous, idiot. I'm magnificently uninterested in this conceited hypnotist."
  But she was flustered by Angus's sleek assurance, by his homage to her eyes
  and wit and reticence.</p>

  <p>Martin twitched with jealousy. He blurted that they must be
  going&mdash;Leora really had to be back&mdash;The trolleys ran infrequently
  after midnight and they walked to the hospital through hollow and sounding
  streets. Angus and Leora kept up a high-strung chatter, while Martin stalked
  beside them, silent, sulky, proud of being sulky. Skittering through a garage
  alley they came out on the mass of Zenith General Hospital, a block long,
  five stories of bleak windows with infrequent dim blotches of light. No one
  was about. The first floor was but five feet from the ground, and they lifted
  Leora up to the limestone ledge of a half-open corridor window. She slid in,
  whispering, "G' night! Thanks!"</p>

  <p>Martin felt empty, dissatisfied. The night was full of a chill
  mournfulness. A light was suddenly flickering in a window above them, and
  there was a woman's scream breaking down into moans. He felt the tragedy of
  parting&mdash;that in the briefness of life he should lose one moment of her
  living presence.</p>

  <p>"I'm going in after her; see she gets there safe," he said.</p>

  <p>The frigid edge of the stone sill bit his hands, but he vaulted, thrust up
  his knee, crawled hastily through the window. Ahead of him, in the
  cork-floored hallway lit only by a tiny electric globe, Leora was tiptoeing
  toward a flight of stairs. He ran after her, on his toes. She squeaked as he
  caught her arm.</p>

  <p>"We got to say good night better than that!" he grumbled. "With that damn'
  Duer&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ssssssh! They'd simply murder me if they caught you here. Do you want to
  get me fired?"</p>

  <p>"Would you care, if it was because of me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;no&mdash;well&mdash;<i>but</i> they'd probably fire you from
  medic school, my lad. If&mdash;" His caressing hands could feel her shiver
  with anxiety. She peered along the corridor, and his quickened imagination
  created sneaking forms, eyes peering from doorways. She sighed, then,
  resolutely: "We can't talk here. We'll slip up to my room&mdash;roommate's
  away for the week. Stand there, in the shadow. If nobody's in sight upstairs,
  I'll come back."</p>

  <p>He followed her to the floor above, to a white door, then breathlessly
  inside. As he closed the door he was touched by this cramped refuge, with its
  camp-beds and photographs from home and softly wrinkled linen. He clasped
  her, but with hand against his chest she forbade him, as she mourned:</p>

  <p>"You were jealous again! How can you distrust me so? With that fool! Women
  not like him? They wouldn't have a chance! Likes himself too well. And then
  you jealous!"</p>

  <p>"I wasn't&mdash;Yes, I was, but I don't dare! To have to sit there and
  grin like a hyena, with him between us, when I wanted to talk to you, to kiss
  you! All right! Probably I'll always be jealous. It's you that have got to
  trust me. I'm not easy-going; never will be. Oh, trust me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Their profound and unresisted kiss was the more blind in memory of that
  barren hour with Angus. They forgot that the superintendent of nurses might
  dreadfully come bursting in; they forgot that Angus was waiting. "Oh, curse
  Angus&mdash;let him go home!" was Martin's only reflection, as his eyes
  closed and his long loneliness vanished.</p>

  <p>"Good night, dear love&mdash;my love forever," he exulted.</p>

  <p>In the still ghostliness of the hall, he laughed as he thought of how
  irritably Angus must have marched away. But from the window he discovered
  Angus huddled on the stone steps, asleep. As he touched the ground, he
  whistled, but stopped short. He saw bursting from the shadow a bulky man,
  vaguely in a porter's uniform, who was shouting:</p>

  <p>"I've caught yuh! Back you come into the hospital, and we'll find out what
  you've been up to!"</p>

  <p>They closed. Martin was wiry, but in the watchman's clasp he was
  smothered. There was a reek of dirty overalls, of unbathed flesh. Martin
  kicked his shins, struck at his boulder of red cheek, tried to twist his arm.
  He broke loose, started to flee, and halted. The struggle, in its contrast to
  the aching sweetness of Leora, had infuriated him. He faced the watchman,
  raging.</p>

  <p>From the awakened Angus, suddenly appearing beside him, there was a thin
  sound of disgust. "Oh, come <i>on!</i> Let's get out of this. Why do you
  dirty your hands on scum like him?"</p>

  <p>The watchman bellowed, "Oh, I'm scum, am I? I'll show you!"</p>

  <p>He collared Angus and slapped him.</p>

  <p>Under the sleepy street-lamp, Martin saw a man go mad. It was not the
  unfeeling Angus Duer who stared at the watchman; it was a killer, and his
  eyes were the terrible eyes of the killer, speaking to the least experienced
  a message of death. He gasped only, "He dared to touch me!" A pen-knife was
  somehow in his hands, he had leaped at the watchman, and he was busily and
  earnestly endeavoring to cut his throat.</p>

  <p>As Martin tried to hold them he heard the agitated pounding of a
  policeman's night stick on the pavement. Martin was slim but he had pitched
  hay and strung telephone wire. He hit the watchman, judiciously, beside the
  left ear, snatched Angus's wrist, and dragged him away. They ran up an alley,
  across a courtyard. They came to a thoroughfare as an owl trolley glowed and
  rattled round the corner; they ran beside it, swung up on the steps, and were
  safe.</p>

  <p>Angus stood on the back platform, sobbing. "My God, I wish I'd killed him!
  He laid his filthy hands on me! Martin! Hold me here on the car. I thought
  I'd got over that. Once when I was a kid I tried to kill a fellow&mdash;God,
  I wish I'd cut that filthy swine's throat!"</p>

  <p>As the trolley came into the center of the city, Martin coaxed, "There's
  an all-night lunch up Oberlin Avenue where we can get some white mule. Come
  on. It'll straighten you up."</p>

  <p>Angus was shaky and stumbling&mdash;Angus the punctilious. Martin led him
  into the lunch-room where, between catsup bottles, they had raw whisky in
  granite-like coffee cups. Angus leaned his head on his arm and sobbed,
  careless of stares, till he had drunk himself into obliteration, and Martin
  steered him home. Then to Martin, in his furnished room with Clif snoring,
  the evening became incredible and nothing more incredible than Angus Duer.
  "Well, he'll be a good friend of mine now, for always. Fine!"</p>

  <p>Next morning, in the hall of the Anatomy Building, he saw Angus and rushed
  toward him. Angus snapped; "You were frightfully stewed last night,
  Arrowsmith. If you can't handle your liquor better than that, you better cut
  it out entirely."</p>

  <p>He walked on, clear-eyed, unruffled.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">And always Martin's work went on&mdash;assisting Max
  Gottlieb, instructing bacteriological students, attending lectures and
  hospital demonstrations&mdash;sixteen merciless hours to the day. He stole
  occasional evenings for original research or for peering into the stirring
  worlds of French and German bacteriological publications; he went proudly now
  and then to Gottlieb's cottage where, against rain-smeared brown wallpaper,
  were Blake drawings and a signed portrait of Koch. But the rest was
  nerve-gnawing.</p>

  <p>Neurology, O.B., internal medicine, physical diagnosis; always a few pages
  more than he could drudge through before he fell asleep at his rickety
  study-table.</p>

  <p>Memorizing of gynecology, of ophthalmology, till his mind was burnt
  raw.</p>

  <p>Droning afternoons of hospital demonstrations, among stumbling students
  barked at by tired clinical professors.</p>

  <p>The competitive exactions of surgery on dogs, in which Angus Duer lorded
  it with impatient perfection.</p>

  <p>Martin admired the professor of internal medicine, T. J. H. Silva, known
  as "Dad" Silva, who was also dean of the medical faculty. He was a round
  little man with a little crescent of mustache. Silva's god was Sir William
  Osler, his religion was the art of sympathetic healing, and his patriotism
  was accurate physical diagnosis. He was a Doc Vickerson of Elk Mills, grown
  wiser and soberer and more sure. But Martin's reverence for Dean Silva was
  counterbalanced by his detestation for Dr. Roscoe Geake, professor of
  otolaryngology.</p>

  <p>Roscoe Geake was a peddler. He would have done well with oil stock. As an
  otolaryngologist he believed that tonsils had been placed in the human
  organism for the purpose of providing specialists with closed motors. A
  physician who left the tonsils in any patient was, he felt, foully and
  ignorantly overlooking his future health and comfort&mdash;the physician's
  future health and comfort. His earnest feeling regarding the nasal septum was
  that it never hurt any patient to have part of it removed, and if the most
  hopeful examination could find nothing the matter with the patient's nose and
  throat except that he was smoking too much, still, in any case, the enforced
  rest after an operation was good for him. Geake denounced this cant about
  Letting Nature Alone. Why, the average well-to-do man appreciated attention!
  He really didn't think much of his specialists unless he was operated on now
  and then&mdash;just a little and not very painfully. Geake had one classic
  annual address in which, winging far above otolaryngology, he evaluated all
  medicine, and explained to grateful healers like Irving Watters the method of
  getting suitable fees:</p>

  <p>"Knowledge is the greatest thing in the medical world but it's no good
  whatever unless you can sell it, and to do this you must first impress your
  personality on the people who have the dollars. Whether a patient is a new or
  an old friend, you must always use <i>salesmanship</i> on him. Explain to
  him, also to his stricken and anxious family, the hard work and thought you
  are giving to his case, and so make him feel that the good you have done him,
  or intend to do him, is even greater than the fee you plan to charge. Then,
  when he gets your bill, he will not misunderstand or kick."</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">There was, as yet, no vision in Martin of serene
  spaciousness of the mind. Beyond doubt he was a bustling young man, and
  rather shrill. He had no uplifted moments when he saw himself in relation to
  the whole world&mdash;if indeed he realized that there was a deal of the
  world besides himself. His friend Clif was boorish, his beloved Leora was
  rustic, however gallant she might be, and he himself wasted energy in hectic
  busyness and in astonishment at dullness. But if he had not ripened, yet he
  was close to earth, he did hate pretentiousness, he did use his hands, and he
  did seek iron actualities with a curiosity inextinguishable.</p>

  <p>And at infrequent times he perceived the comedy of life; relaxed for a
  gorgeous hour from the intensity wearing to his admirers. Such was the hour
  before Christmas vacation when Roscoe Geake rose to glory.</p>

  <p>It was announced in the Winnemac Daily News that Dr. Geake had been called
  from the chair of otolaryngology to the vice-presidency of the puissant New
  Idea Medical Instrument and Furniture Company of Jersey City. In celebration
  he gave a final address to the entire medical school on "The Art and Science
  of Furnishing the Doctor's Office."</p>

  <p>He was a neatly finished person, Geake, eye-glassed and enthusiastic and
  fond of people. He beamed on his loving students and cried:</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen, the trouble with too many doctors, even those splendid old
  pioneer war-horses who through mud and storm, through winter's chill blast
  and August's untempered heat, go bringing cheer and surcease from pain to the
  world's humblest, yet even these old Nestors not so infrequently settle down
  in a rut and never shake themselves loose. Now that I am leaving this field
  where I have labored so long and happily, I want to ask every man jack of you
  to read, before you begin to practice medicine, not merely your Rosenau and
  Howell and Gray, but also, as a preparation for being that which all good
  citizens must be, namely, practical men, a most valuable little manual of
  modern psychology, 'How to Put Pep in Salesmanship,' by Grosvenor A. Bibby.
  For don't forget, gentlemen, and this is my last message to you, the man
  worth while is not merely the man who takes things with a smile but also the
  man who's trained in philosophy, <i>practical</i> philosophy, so that instead
  of day-dreaming and spending all his time talking about 'ethics,' splendid
  though they are, and 'charity,' glorious virtue though that be, yet he never
  forgets that unfortunately the world judges a man by the amount of good hard
  cash he can lay away. The graduates of the University of Hard Knocks judge a
  physician as they judge a business man, not merely by his alleged 'high
  ideals' but by the horsepower he puts into carrying them out&mdash;and making
  them pay! And from a scientific standpoint, don't overlook the fact that the
  impression of properly remunerated competence which you make on a patient is
  of just as much importance, in these days of the new psychology, as the drugs
  you get into him or the operations he lets you get away with. The minute he
  begins to see that other folks appreciate and reward your skill, that minute
  he must begin to feel your power and so to get well.</p>

  <p>"Nothing is more important in inspiring him than to have such an office
  that as soon as he steps into it, you have begun to sell him the idea of
  being properly cured. I don't care whether a doctor has studied in Germany,
  Munich, Baltimore, and Rochester. I don't care whether he has all science at
  his fingertips, whether he can instantly diagnose with a considerable degree
  of accuracy the most obscure ailment, whether he has the surgical technique
  of a Mayo, a Crile, a Blake, an Ochsner, a Cushing. If he has a dirty old
  office, with hand-me-down chairs and a lot of second-hand magazines, then the
  patient isn't going to have confidence in him; he is going to resist the
  treatment&mdash;and the doctor is going to have difficulty in putting over
  and collecting an adequate fee.</p>

  <p>"To go far below the surface of this matter into the fundamental
  philosophy and esthetics of office-furnishing for the doctor, there are today
  two warring schools, the Tapestry School and the Aseptic School, if I may
  venture to so denominate and conveniently distinguish them. Both of them have
  their merits. The Tapestry School claims that luxurious chairs for waiting
  patients, handsome hand-painted pictures, a bookcase jammed with the world's
  best literature in expensively bound sets, together with cut-glass vases and
  potted palms, produce an impression of that opulence which can come only from
  sheer ability and knowledge. The Aseptic School, on the other hand, maintains
  that what the patient wants is that appearance of scrupulous hygiene which
  can be produced only by furnishing the outer waiting-room as well as the
  inner offices in white-painted chairs and tables, with merely a Japanese
  print against a gray wall.</p>

  <p>"But, gentlemen, it seems obvious to me, so obvious that I wonder it has
  not been brought out before, that the ideal reception-room is a combination
  of these two schools! Have your potted palms and handsome pictures&mdash;to
  the practical physician they are as necessary a part of his working equipment
  as a sterilizer or a Baumanometer. But so far as possible have everything in
  sanitary-looking white&mdash;and think of the color-schemes you can evolve,
  or the good wife for you, if she be one blessed with artistic tastes! Rich
  golden or red cushions, in a Morris chair enameled the purest white! A
  floor-covering of white enamel, with just a border of delicate rose! Recent
  and unspotted numbers of expensive magazines, with art covers, lying on a
  white table! Gentlemen, there is the idea of imaginative salesmanship which I
  wish to leave with you; there is the gospel which I hope to spread in my
  fresh field of endeavor, the New Idea Instrument Company of Jersey City,
  where at any time I shall be glad to see and shake by the hand any and all of
  you."</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">Through the storm of his Christmas examinations, Martin had
  an intensified need of Leora. She had been summoned home to Dakota, perhaps
  for months, on the ground that her mother was unwell, and he had, or thought
  he had, to see her daily. He must have slept less than four hours a night.
  Grinding at examinations on the interurban car, he dashed in to her, looking
  up to scowl when he thought of the lively interns and the men patients whom
  she met in the hospital, scorning himself for being so primitive, and
  worrying all over again. To see her at all, he had to wait for hours in the
  lobby, or walk up and down in the snow outside till she could slip to a
  window and peep out. When they were together, they were completely absorbed.
  She had a genius for frank passion; she teased him, tantalized him, but she
  was tender and unafraid.</p>

  <p>He was sick lonely when he saw her off at the Union Station. His
  examination papers were competent but, save in bacteriology and internal
  medicine, they were sketchy. He turned emptily to the laboratory for vacation
  time.</p>

  <p>He had so far displayed more emotion than achievement in his tiny original
  researches. Gottlieb was patient. "It iss a fine system, this education. All
  what we cram into the students, not Koch and two dieners could learn. Do not
  worry about the research. We shall do it yet." But he expected Martin to
  perform a miracle or two in the whole fortnight of the holidays and Martin
  had no stomach with which to think. He played in the laboratory; he spent his
  time polishing glassware, and when he transplanted cultures from his rabbits,
  his notes were incomplete.</p>

  <p>Gottlieb was instantly grim. "Was gibt es dann? Do you call these notes?
  Always when I praise a man must he stop working? Do you think that you are a
  Theobald Smith or a Novy that you should sit and meditate? You have the
  ability of Pfaff!"</p>

  <p>For once, Martin was impenitent. He mumbled to himself, as Gottlieb
  stamped out like a Grand Duke, "Rats, I've got <i>some</i> rest coming to me.
  Gosh, most fellows, why, they go to swell homes for vacation, and have dances
  and fathers and everything. If Leora was here, we'd go to a show
  tonight."</p>

  <p>He viciously seized his cap (a soggy and doubtful object), sought Clif
  Clawson, who was spending the vacation in sleeping between poker games at
  Barney's, and outlined a project of going into town and getting drunk. It was
  executed so successfully that during vacation it was repeated whenever he
  thought of the coming torture-wheel of uninspiring work, whenever he realized
  that it was only Gottlieb and Leora who held him here. After vacation, in
  late January, he found that whisky relieved him from the frenzy of work, from
  the terror of loneliness&mdash;then betrayed him and left him the more weary,
  the more lonely. He felt suddenly old; he was twenty-four now, he reminded
  himself, and a schoolboy, his real work not even begun. Clif was his refuge;
  Clif admired Leora and would listen to his babbling of her.</p>

  <p>But Clif and Martin came to the misfortune of Founder's Day.</p><br>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">January thirtieth, the birthday of the late Dr. Warburton
  Stonedge, founder of the medical department of Winnemac, was annually
  celebrated by a banquet rich in fraternalism and speeches and large lack of
  wine. All the faculty reserved their soundest observations for the event, and
  all the students were expected to be present.</p>

  <p>This year it was held in the large hall of the University Y.M.C.A., a
  moral apartment with red wall paper, portraits of whiskered alumni who had
  gone out to be missionaries, and long thin pine boxes intended to resemble
  exposed oak beams. About the famous guests&mdash;Dr. Rouncefield the Chicago
  surgeon, a diabetes specialist from Omaha, a Pittsburgh internist&mdash;stood
  massed the faculty members. They tried to look festal, but they were worn and
  nervous after four months of school. They had wrinkles and tired eyes. They
  were all in business suits, mostly unpressed. They sounded scientific and
  interested; they used words like phlebarteriectasia and
  hepatocholangio-enterostomy, and they asked the guests, "So you just been in
  Rochester? What's, uh, what're Charley and Will doing in orthopedics?" But
  they were full of hunger and melancholy. It was half-past seven, and they who
  did not normally dine at seven, dined at six-thirty.</p>

  <p>Upon this seedy gaiety entered a splendor, a tremendous black-bearded
  personage, magnificent of glacial shirt-bosom, vast of brow, wild-eyed with
  genius or with madness. In a marvelous great voice, with a flavor of German
  accent, he inquired for Dr. Silva, and sailed into the dean's group like a
  frigate among fishing-smacks.</p>

  <p>"Who the dickens is that?" wondered Martin.</p>

  <p>"Let's edge in and find out," said Clif, and they clung to the fast
  increasing knot about Dean Silva and the mystery, who was introduced as Dr.
  Benoni Carr, the pharmacologist.</p>

  <p>They heard Dr. Carr, to the pale admiration of the school-bound assistant
  professors, boom genially of working with Schmiedeberg in Germany on the
  isolation of dihydroxypentamethylendiamin, of the possibilities of
  chemotherapy, of the immediate cure of sleeping sickness, of the era of
  scientific healing. "Though I am American-born, I have the advantage of
  speaking German from a child, and so perhaps I can better understand the work
  of my dear friend Ehrlich. I saw him receive a decoration from His Imperial
  Highness the Kaiser. Dear old Ehrlich, he was like a child!"</p>

  <p>There was at this time (but it changed curiously in 1914 and 1915) an
  active Germanophile section of the faculty. They bent before this tornado of
  erudition. Angus Duer forgot that he was Angus Duer; and Martin listened with
  excited stimulation. Benoni Carr had all of Gottlieb's individuality, all his
  scorn of machine-made teachers, all his air of a great world which showed
  Mohalis as provincial, with none of Gottlieb's nervous touchiness. Martin
  wished Gottlieb were present; he wondered whether the two giants would
  clash.</p>

  <p>Dr. Carr was placed at the speakers' table, near the dean. Martin was
  astonished to see the eminent pharmacologist, after a shocked inspection of
  the sour chicken and mishandled salad which made up most of the dinner, pour
  something into his water glass from a huge silver flask&mdash;and pour that
  something frequently. He became boisterous. He leaned across two men to slap
  the indignant dean on the shoulder; he contradicted his neighbors; he sang a
  stanza of "I'm Bound Away for the Wild Missourai."</p>

  <p>Few phenomena at the dinner were so closely observed by the students as
  the manners of Dr. Benoni Carr.</p>

  <p>After an hour of strained festivity, when Dean Silva had risen to announce
  the speakers, Carr lumbered to his feet and shouted, "Let's not have any
  speeches. Only fools make speeches. Wise men sing songs. Whoopee! Oh,
  tireolee, oh, tireolee, oh, tireolee a lady! You profs are the bunk!"</p>

  <p>Dean Silva was to be seen beseeching him, then leading him out of the
  room, with the assistance of two professors and a football tackle, and in the
  hush of a joyful horror Clif grunted to Martin:</p>

  <p>"Here's where I get mine! And the damn' fool promised to stay sober!"</p>

  <p>"Huh?"</p>

  <p>"I might of known he'd show up stewed and spill the beans. Oh, maybe the
  dean won't hand me hell proper!"</p>

  <p>He explained. Dr. Benoni Carr was born Benno Karkowski. He had graduated
  from a medical school which gave degrees in two years. He had read vastly,
  but he had never been in Europe. He had been "spieler" in medicine shows,
  chiropodist, spiritualist medium, esoteric teacher, head of sanitariums for
  the diversion of neurotic women. Clif had encountered him in Zenith, when
  they were both drunk. It was Clif who had told Dean Silva that the celebrated
  pharmacologist, just back from Europe, was in Zenith for a few days and
  perhaps might accept an invitation&mdash;</p>

  <p>The dean had thanked Clif ardently.</p>

  <p>The banquet ended early, and there was inadequate attention to Dr.
  Rouncefield's valuable address on the Sterilization of Catgut.</p>

  <p>Clif sat up worrying, and admitting the truth of Martin's several
  observations. Next day&mdash;he had a way with women when he deigned to take
  the trouble&mdash;he pumped the dean's girl secretary, and discovered his
  fate. There had been a meeting of a faculty committee; the blame for the
  Benoni Carr outrage had been placed on Clif; and the dean had said all the
  things Clif had imagined, with a number which he had not possessed the talent
  to conceive. But the dean was not going to summon him at once; he was going
  to keep him waiting in torture, then execute him in public.</p>

  <p>"Good-by, old M.D. degree! Rats, I never thought much of the doctor
  business. Guess I'll be a bond salesman," said Clif to Martin. He strolled
  away, he went to the dean, and remarked:</p>

  <p>"Oh, Dean Silva, I just dropped in to tell you I've decided to resign from
  the medic school. Been offered a big job in, uh, in Chicago, and I don't
  think much of the way you run the school, anyway. Too much memorizing and too
  little real spirit of science. Good luck, Doc. So long."</p>

  <p>"Gggggg&mdash;" said Dean Silva.</p>

  <p>Clif moved into Zenith, and Martin was left alone. He gave up the double
  room at the front of his boarding-house for a hall-room at the rear, and in
  that narrow den he sat and mourned in a desolation of loneliness. He looked
  out on a vacant lot in which a tattered advertisement of pork and beans
  flapped on a leaning billboard. He saw Leora's eyes and heard Clif's
  comfortable scoffing, and the quiet was such as he could not endure.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">The persistent yammer of a motor horn drew Martin to the
  window of the laboratory, a late afternoon in February. He looked down on a
  startling roadster, all streamlines and cream paint, with enormous
  headlights. He slowly made out that the driver, a young man in coffee-colored
  loose motor coat and hectic checked cap and intense neckwear, was Clif
  Clawson, and that Clif was beckoning.</p>

  <p>He hastened down, and Clif cried:</p>

  <p>"Oh, boy! How do you like the boat? Do you diagnose this suit? Scotch
  heather&mdash;honest! Uncle Clif has nabbed off a twenty-five-buck-a-week job
  <i>with</i> commissions, selling autos. Boy, I was lost in your old medic
  school. I can sell anything to anybody. In a year I'll be making eighty a
  week. Jump in, old son. I'm going to take you in to the Grand and blow you to
  the handsomest feed you ever stuffed into your skinny organism."</p>

  <p>The thirty-eight miles an hour at which Clif drove into Zenith was, in
  1908, dismaying speed. Martin discovered a new Clif. He was as noisy as ever,
  but more sure, glowing with schemes for immediately acquiring large sums of
  money. His hair, once bushy and greasy in front, tending to stick out
  jaggedly behind, was sleek now, and his face had the pinkness of massage. He
  stopped at the fabulous Grand Hotel with a jar of brakes; before he left the
  car he changed his violent yellow driving-gauntlets for a pair of gray gloves
  with black stitching, which he immediately removed as he paraded through the
  lobby. He called the coat-girl "Sweetie," and at the dining-room door he
  addressed the head-waiter:</p>

  <p>"Ah, Gus, how's the boy, how's the boy feeling tonight? How's the mucho
  famoso majordomoso? Gus, want to make you 'quainted with Dr. Arrowsmith. Any
  time the doc comes here I want you to shake a leg and hand him out that
  well-known service, my boy, and give him anything he wants, and if he's
  broke, you charge it to me. Now, Gus, I want a nice little table for two,
  with garage and hot and cold water, and wouldst fain have thy advice,
  Gustavus, on the oysters and hore duffers and all the ingredients fair of a
  Maecenan feast."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, right this way, Mr. Clawson," breathed the headwaiter.</p>

  <p>Clif whispered to Martin, "I've got him like that in two weeks! You watch
  my smoke!"</p>

  <p>While Clif was ordering, a man stopped beside their table. He resembled an
  earnest traveling-man who liked to get back to his suburban bungalow every
  Saturday evening. He was beginning to grow slightly bald, slightly plump. His
  rimless eyeglasses, in the midst of a round smooth face, made him seem
  innocent. He stared about as though he wished he had someone with whom to
  dine. Clif darted up, patted the man's elbow, and bawled:</p>

  <p>"Ah, there, Babski, old boy. Feeding with anybody? Come join the Sporting
  Gents' Association."</p>

  <p>"All right, be glad to. Wife's out of town," said the man.</p>

  <p>"Shake hands with Dr. Arrowsmith Mart, meet George F. Babbitt, the
  hoch-gecelebrated Zenith real-estate king. Mr. Babbitt has just adorned his
  thirty-fourth birthday by buying his first benzine buggy from yours truly and
  beg to remain as always."</p>

  <p>It was, at least on the part of Clif and Mr. Babbitt, a mirthful affair,
  and when Martin had joined them in cocktails, St. Louis beer, and highballs,
  he saw that Clif was the most generous person now living, and Mr. George F.
  Babbitt a companion of charm.</p>

  <p>Clif explained how certain he was&mdash;apparently his distinguished
  medical training had something to do with it&mdash;to be president of a motor
  factory, and Mr. Babbitt confided:</p>

  <p>"You fellows are a lot younger than I am, eight-ten years, and you haven't
  learned yet, like I have, that where the big pleasure is, is in Ideals and
  Service and a Public Career. Now just between you and me and the gatepost, my
  vogue doesn't lie in real estate but in oratory. Fact, one time I planned to
  study law and go right in for politics. Just between ourselves, and I don't
  want this to go any farther, I've been making some pretty good affiliations
  lately&mdash;been meeting some of the rising young Republican politicians. Of
  course a fellow has got to start in modestly, but I may say, sotto voce, that
  I expect to run for alderman next fall. It's practically only a step from
  that to mayor and then to governor of the state, and if I find the career
  suits me, there's no reason why in ten or twelve years, say in 1918 or 1920,
  I shouldn't have the honor of representing the great state of Winnemac in
  Washington, D. C.!"</p>

  <p>In the presence of a Napoleon like Clif and a Gladstone like George F.
  Babbitt, Martin perceived his own lack of power and business skill, and when
  he had returned to Mohalis he was restless. Of his poverty he had rarely
  thought, but now, in contrast to Clif's rich ease, his own shabby clothes and
  his pinched room seemed shameful.</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">A long letter from Leora, hinting that she might not be able
  to return to Zenith, left him the more lonely. Nothing seemed worth doing. In
  that listless state he was mooning about the laboratory during elementary
  bacteriology demonstration hour, when Gottlieb sent him to the basement to
  bring up six male rabbits for inoculation. Gottlieb was working eighteen
  hours a day on new experiments; he was jumpy and testy; he gave orders like
  insults. When Martin came dreamily back with six females instead of males,
  Gottlieb shrieked at him, "You are the worst fool that was ever in this
  lab!"</p>

  <p>The groundlings, second-year men who were not unmindful of Martin's own
  scoldings, tittered like small animals, and jarred him into raging, "Well, I
  couldn't make out what you said. And it's the first time I ever fell down. I
  won't stand your talking to me like that!"</p>

  <p>"You will stand anything I say! Clumsy! You can take your hat and get
  out!"</p>

  <p>"You mean I'm fired as assistant?"</p>

  <p>"I am glad you haf enough intelligence to understand that, no matter how
  wretched I talk!"</p>

  <p>Martin flung away. Gottlieb suddenly looked bewildered and took a step
  toward Martin's retreating back. But the class, the small giggling animals,
  they stood delighted, hoping for more, and Gottlieb shrugged, glared them
  into terror, sent the least awkward of them for the rabbits, and went on,
  curiously quiet.</p>

  <p>And Martin, at Barney's dive, was hotly drinking the first of the whiskys
  which sent him wandering all night, by himself. With each drink he admitted
  that he had an excellent chance to become a drunkard, and with each he
  boasted that he did not care. Had Leora been nearer than Wheatsylvania twelve
  hundred miles away, he would have fled to her for salvation. He was still
  shaky next morning, and he had already taken a drink to make it possible to
  live through the morning when he received the note from Dean Silva bidding
  him report to the office at once.</p>

  <p>The dean lectured:</p>

  <p>"Arrowsmith, you've been discussed a good deal by the faculty council of
  late. Except in one or two courses&mdash;in my own I have no fault to
  find&mdash;you have been very inattentive. Your marks have been all right,
  but you could do still better. Recently you have also been drinking. You have
  been seen in places of very low repute, and you have been intimate with a man
  who took it upon himself to insult me, the Founder, our guests, and the
  University. Various faculty members have complained of your superior
  attitude&mdash;making fun of our courses right out in class! But Dr. Gottlieb
  has always warmly defended you. He insisted that you have a real flair for
  investigative science. Last night, however, he admitted that you had recently
  been impertinent to him. Now unless you immediately turn over a new leaf,
  young man, I shall have to suspend you for the rest of the year and, if that
  doesn't do the work, I shall have to ask for your resignation. And I think it
  might be a good thing for your humility&mdash;you seem to have the pride of
  the devil, young man!&mdash;it might be a good idea for you to see Dr.
  Gottlieb and start off your reformation by apologizing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It was the whisky spoke, not Martin:</p>

  <p>"I'm damned if I will! He can go to the devil! I've given him my life, and
  then he tattles on me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's absolutely unfair to Dr. Gottlieb. He merely&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sure. He merely let me down. I'll see him in hell before I'll apologize,
  after the way I've worked for him. And as for Clif Clawson that you were
  hinting at&mdash;him 'take it on himself to insult anybody'? He just played a
  joke, and you went after his scalp. I'm glad he did it!"</p>

  <p>Then Martin waited for the words that would end his scientific life.</p>

  <p>The little man, the rosy, pudgy, good little man, he stared and hummed and
  spoke softly:</p>

  <p>"Arrowsmith, I could fire you right now, of course, but I believe you have
  good stuff in you. I decline to let you go. Naturally, you're suspended, at
  least till you come to your senses and apologize to me and to Gottlieb." He
  was fatherly; almost he made Martin repent; but he concluded, "And as for
  Clawson, his 'joke' regarding this Benoni Carr person&mdash;and why I never
  looked the fellow up is beyond me, I suppose I was too busy&mdash;his 'joke,'
  as you call it, was the action either of an idiot or a blackguard, and until
  you are able to perceive that fact, I don't think you will be ready to come
  back to us."</p>

  <p>"All right," said Martin, and left the room.</p>

  <p>He was very sorry for himself. The real tragedy, he felt, was that though
  Gottlieb had betrayed him and ended his career, ended the possibility of his
  mastering science and of marrying Leora, he still worshiped the man.</p>

  <p>He said good-by to no one in Mohalis save his landlady. He packed, and it
  was a simple packing. He stuffed his books, his notes, a shabby suit, his
  inadequate linen, and his one glory, the dinner clothes, into his unwieldy
  imitation-leather bag. He remembered with drunken tears the hour of buying
  the dinner jacket.</p>

  <p>Martin's money, from his father's tiny estate, came in bimonthly checks
  from the bank at Elk Mills. He had now but six dollars.</p>

  <p>In Zenith he left his bag at the interurban trolley station and sought
  Clif, whom he found practicing eloquence over a beautiful pearl-gray motor
  hearse, in which a beer-fed undertaker was jovially interested. He waited,
  sitting hunched and twisted on the steel running-board of a limousine. He
  resented but he was too listless to resent greatly the stares of the other
  salesmen and the girl stenographers.</p>

  <p>Clif dashed up, bumbling, "Well, well, how's the boy? Come out and catchum
  little drink."</p>

  <p>"I could use one."</p>

  <p>Martin knew that Clif was staring at him. As they entered the bar of the
  Grand Hotel, with its paintings of lovely but absent-minded ladies, its
  mirrors, its thick marble rail along a mahogany bar, he blurted:</p>

  <p>"Well, I got mine, too. Dad Silva's fired me, for general footlessness.
  I'm going to bum around a little and then get some kind of a job. God, but
  I'm tired and nervous! Say, can you lend me some money?"</p>

  <p>"You bet. All I've got. How much you want?"</p>

  <p>"Guess I'll need a hundred dollars. May drift around quite some time."</p>

  <p>"Golly, I haven't got that much, but prob'ly I can raise it at the office.
  Here, sit down at this table and wait for me."</p>

  <p>How Clif obtained the hundred dollars has never been explained, but he was
  back with it in a quarter-hour. They went on to dinner, and Martin had much
  too much whisky. Clif took him to his own boarding-house&mdash;which was
  decidedly less promissory of prosperity than Clif's clothes&mdash;firmly gave
  him a cold bath to bring him to, and put him to bed. Next morning he offered
  to find a job for him, but Martin refused and left Zenith by the northbound
  train at noon.</p>

  <p>Always, in America, there remains from pioneer days a cheerful pariahdom
  of shabby young men who prowl causelessly from state to state, from gang to
  gang, in the power of the Wanderlust. They wear black sateen shirts, and
  carry bundles. They are not permanently tramps. They have home towns to which
  they return, to work quietly in the factory or the section-gang for a
  year&mdash;for a week&mdash;and as quietly to disappear again. They crowd the
  smoking cars at night; they sit silent on benches in filthy stations; they
  know all the land yet of it they know nothing, because in a hundred cities
  they see only the employment agencies, the all-night lunches, the blind-pigs,
  the scabrous lodging-houses. Into that world of voyageurs Martin vanished.
  Drinking steadily, only half-conscious of whither he was going, of what he
  desired to do, shamefully haunted by Leora and Clif and the swift hands of
  Gottlieb, he flitted from Zenith to the city of Sparta, across to Ohio, up
  into Michigan, west to Illinois. His mind was a shambles. He could never
  quite remember, afterward, where he had been. Once, it is clear, he was
  soda-fountain clerk in a Minnemagantic drug-store. Once he must have been,
  for a week, dishwasher in the stench of a cheap restaurant. He wandered by
  freight trains, on blind baggages, on foot. To his fellow prospectors he was
  known as "Slim," the worst-tempered and most restless of all their
  company.</p>

  <p>After a time a sense of direction began to appear in his crazy drifting.
  He was instinctively headed westward, and to the west, toward the long
  prairie dusk, Leora was waiting. For a day or two he stopped drinking. He
  woke up feeling not like the sickly hobo called "Slim," but like Martin
  Arrowsmith, and he pondered, with his mind running clear, "Why shouldn't I go
  back? Maybe this hasn't been so bad for me. I was working too hard. I was
  pretty high-strung. Blew up. Like to, uh&mdash;Wonder what happened to my
  rabbits?...Will they ever let me do research again?"</p>

  <p>But to return to the University before he had seen Leora was impossible.
  His need of her was an obsession, making the rest of earth absurd and
  worthless. He had, with blurry cunning, saved most of the hundred dollars he
  had taken from Clif; he had lived&mdash;very badly, on grease&mdash;swimming
  stews and soda-reeking bread&mdash;by what he earned along the way. Suddenly,
  on no particular day, in no particular town in Wisconsin, he stalked to the
  station, bought a ticket to Wheatsylvania, North Dakota, and telegraphed to
  Leora, "Coming 2:43 tomorrow Wednesday Sandy."</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">He crossed the wide Mississippi into Minnesota. He changed
  trains at St. Paul; he rolled into gusty vastnesses of snow, cut by thin
  lines of fence-wire. He felt free, in release from the little fields of
  Winnemac and Ohio, in relaxation from the shaky nerves of midnight study and
  midnight booziness. He remembered his days of wire-stringing in Montana and
  regained that careless peace. Sunset was a surf of crimson, and by night,
  when he stepped from the choking railroad coach and tramped the platform at
  Sauk Centre, he drank the icy air and looked up to the vast and solitary
  winter stars. The fan of the Northern Lights frightened and glorified the
  sky. He returned to the coach with the energy of that courageous land. He
  nodded and gurgled in brief smothering sleep; he sprawled on the seat and
  talked with friendly fellow vagrants; he drank bitter coffee and ate
  enormously of buckwheat cakes at a station restaurant; and so, changing at
  anonymous towns, he came at last to the squatty shelters, the two
  wheat-elevators, the cattle-pen, the oil-tank, and the red box of a station
  with its slushy platform, which composed the outskirts of Wheatsylvania.
  Against the station, absurd in a huge coonskin coat, stood Leora. He must
  have looked a little mad as he stared at her from the vestibule, as he
  shivered with the wind. She lifted to him her two open hands, childish in red
  mittens. He ran down, he dropped his awkward bag on the platform and, unaware
  of the gaping furry farmers, they were lost in a kiss.</p>

  <p>Years after, in a tropic noon, he remembered the freshness of her
  wind-cooled cheeks.</p>

  <p>The train was gone, pounding out of the tiny station. It had stood like a
  dark wall beside the platform, protecting them, but now the light from the
  snowfields glared in on them and left them exposed and self-conscious.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;what's happened?" she fluttered. "No letters. I was so
  frightened."</p>

  <p>"Off bumming. The dean suspended me&mdash;being fresh to profs. D' y'
  care?"</p>

  <p>"Course not, if you wanted to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I've come to marry you."</p>

  <p>"I don't see how we can, dearest, but&mdash;All right. There'll be a
  lovely row with Dad." She laughed. "He's always so surprised and <i>hurt</i>
  when anything happens that he didn't plan out. It'll be nice to have you with
  me in the scrap, because you aren't supposed to know that he expects to plan
  out everything for everybody and&mdash;Oh, Sandy, I've been so lonely for
  you! Mother isn't really a bit sick, not the least bit, but they go on
  keeping me here. I think probably somebody hinted to Dad that folks were
  saying he must be broke, if his dear little daughter had to go off and learn
  nursing, and he hasn't worried it all out yet&mdash;it takes Andrew Jackson
  Tozer about a year to worry out anything. Oh, Sandy! You're here!"</p>

  <p>After the clatter and jam of the train, the village seemed blankly empty.
  He could have walked around the borders of Wheatsylvania in ten minutes.
  Probably to Leora one building differed from another&mdash;she appeared to
  distinguish between the general store of Norblom and that of Frazier &amp;
  Lamb&mdash;but to Martin the two-story wooden shacks creeping aimlessly along
  the wide Main Street were featureless and inappreciable. Then "There's our
  house, end of the next block," said Leora, as they turned the corner at the
  feed and implement store, and in a panic of embarrassment Martin wanted to
  halt. He saw a storm coming: Mr. Tozer denouncing him as a failure who
  desired to ruin Leora, Mrs. Tozer weeping.</p>

  <p>"Say&mdash;say&mdash;say&mdash;have you told 'em about me?" he
  stammered.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Sort of. I said you were a wonder in medic school, and maybe we'd
  get married when you finished your internship, and then when your wire came,
  they wanted to know why you were coming, and why it was you wired from
  Wisconsin, and what color necktie you had on when you were sending the wire,
  and I couldn't make 'em understand I didn't know. They discussed it. Quite a
  lot. They do discuss things. All through supper. Solemn. Oh, Sandy, do curse
  and swear some at meals."</p>

  <p>He was in a funk. Her parents, formerly amusing figures in a story, became
  oppressively real in sight of the wide, brown, porchy house. A large
  plate-glass window with a colored border had recently been cut through the
  wall, as a sign of prosperity, and the garage was new and authoritative.</p>

  <p>He tagged after Leora, expecting the blast. Mrs. Tozer opened the door,
  and stared at him plaintively&mdash;a thin, faded, unhumorous woman. She
  bowed as though he was not so much unwelcome as unexplained and doubtful.</p>

  <p>"Will you show Mr. Arrowsmith his room, Ory, or shall I?" she peeped.</p>

  <p>It was the kind of house that has a large phonograph but no books, and if
  there were any pictures, as beyond hope there must have been, Martin never
  remembered them. The bed in his room was lumpy but covered with a chaste
  figured spread, and the flowery pitcher and bowl rested on a cover
  embroidered in red with lambs, frogs, water lilies, and a pious motto.</p>

  <p>He took as long as he could in unpacking things which needed no unpacking,
  and hesitated down the stairs. No one was in the parlor, which smelled of
  furnace-heat and balsam pillows; then, from nowhere apparent, Mrs. Tozer was
  there, worrying about him and trying to think of something polite to say.</p>

  <p>"Did you have a comfortable trip on the train?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, it was&mdash;Well, it was pretty crowded."</p>

  <p>"Oh, was it crowded?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, there were a lot of people traveling."</p>

  <p>"Were there? I suppose&mdash;Yes. Sometimes I wonder where all the people
  can be going that you see going places all the time. Did you&mdash;was it
  very cold in the Cities&mdash;in Minneapolis and St. Paul?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it was pretty cold."</p>

  <p>"Oh, was it cold?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Tozer was so still, so anxiously polite. He felt like a burglar taken
  for a guest, and intensely he wondered where Leora could be. She came in
  serenely, with coffee and a tremendous Swedish coffee-ring voluptuous with
  raisins and glistening brown sugar, and she had them talking, almost easily,
  about the coldness of winter and the value of Fords when into the midst of
  all this brightness slid Mr. Andrew Jackson Tozer, and they drooped again to
  politeness.</p>

  <p>Mr. Tozer was as thin and undistinguished and sun-worn as his wife, and
  like her he peered, he kept silence and fretted. He was astonished by
  everything in the world that did not bear on his grain elevator, his
  creamery, his tiny bank, the United Brethren Church, and the careful conduct
  of an Overland car. It was not astounding that he should have become almost
  rich, for he accepted nothing that was not natural and convenient to Andrew
  Jackson Tozer.</p>

  <p>He hinted a desire to know whether Martin "drank," how prosperous he was,
  and how he could possibly have come all this way from the urbanities of
  Winnemac. (The Tozers were born in Illinois, but they had been in Dakota
  since childhood, and they regarded Wisconsin as the farthest, most perilous
  rim of the Eastern horizon.) They were so blank, so creepily polite, that
  Martin was able to avoid such unpleasant subjects as being suspended. He
  dandled an impression that he was an earnest young medic who in no time at
  all would be making large and suitable sums of money for the support of their
  Leora, but as he was beginning to lean back in his chair he was betrayed by
  the appearance of Leora's brother.</p>

  <p>Bert Tozer, Albert R. Tozer, cashier and vice-president of the
  Wheatsylvania State Bank, auditor and vice-president of the Tozer Grain and
  Storage Company, treasurer and vice-president of the Star Creamery, was not
  in the least afflicted by the listening dubiousness of his parents. Bertie
  was a very articulate and modern man of affairs. He had buck teeth, and on
  his eye-glasses was a gold chain leading to a dainty hook behind his left
  ear. He believed in town-boosting, organized motor tours, Boy Scouts,
  baseball, and the hanging of I.W.W.'s; and his most dolorous regret was that
  Wheatsylvania was too small&mdash;as yet&mdash;to have a Y.M.C.A. or a
  Commercial Club. Plunging in beside him was his fiancee, Miss Ada Quist,
  daughter of the feed and implement store. Her nose was sharp, but not so
  sharp as her voice or the suspiciousness with which she faced Martin.</p>

  <p>"This Arrowswith?" demanded Bert. "Huh! Well, guess you're glad to be out
  here in God's country!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it's fine&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Trouble with the Eastern states is, they haven't got the git, or the room
  to grow. You ought to see a real Dakota harvest! Look here, how come you're
  away from school this time of year?"</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know all about school-terms. I went to business college in Grand Forks.
  How come you can get away now?"</p>

  <p>"I took a little lay-off."</p>

  <p>"Leora says you and her are thinking of getting married."</p>

  <p>"We&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Got any cash outside your school-money?"</p>

  <p>"I have not!"</p>

  <p>"Thought so! How juh expect to support a wife?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose I'll be practicing medicine some day."</p>

  <p>"Some day! Then what's the use of talking about being engaged till you can
  support a wife?"</p>

  <p>"That," interrupted Bert's lady-love, Miss Ada Quist, "that's just what
  <i>I</i> said, Ory!" She seemed to speak with her pointed nose as much as
  with her button of a mouth. "If Bert and I can wait, I guess other people
  can!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Tozer whimpered, "Don't be too hard on Mr. Arrowsmith, Bertie. I'm
  sure he wants to do the right thing."</p>

  <p>"I'm not being hard on anybody! I'm being sensible. If Pa and you would
  tend to things instead of standing around fussing, I wouldn't have to butt
  in. I don't believe in interfering with anybody else's doings, or anybody
  interfering with mine. Live and let live and mind your own business is my
  motto, and that's what I said to Alec Ingleblad the other day when I was in
  there having a shave and he was trying to get funny about our holding so many
  mortgages, but I'll be blamed if I'm going to allow a fellow that I don't
  know anything about to come snooping around My Sister till I find out
  something about his prospects!"</p>

  <p>Leora crooned, "Bertie, lamb, your tie is climbing your collar again."</p>

  <p>"Yes and <i>you</i>, Ory," shrieked Bert, "if it wasn't for me you'd have
  married Sam Petchek, two years ago!"</p>

  <p>Bert further said, with instances and illustrations, that she was
  light-minded, and as for nursing&mdash;<i>nursing!</i></p>

  <p>She said that Bert was what he was, and tried to explain to Martin the
  matter of Sam Petchek. (It has never yet been altogether explained.)</p>

  <p>Ada Quist said that Leora did not care if she broke her dear parents'
  hearts and ruined Bert's career.</p>

  <p>Martin said, "Look here, I&mdash;" and never got farther. Mr. and Mrs.
  Tozer said they were all to be calm, and of course Bert didn't mean&mdash;But
  really, it was true; they had to be sensible, and how Mr. Arrowsmith could
  expect to support a wife&mdash;</p>

  <p>The conference lasted till nine-thirty, which, as Mr. Tozer pointed out,
  was everybody's bedtime, and except for the five-minute discussion as to
  whether Miss Ada Quist was to stay to supper, and the debate on the saltiness
  of this last cornbeef, they clave faithfully to the inquiry as to whether
  Martin and Leora were engaged. All persons interested, which apparently did
  not include Martin and Leora, decided that they were not. Bert ushered Martin
  upstairs. He saw to it that the lovers should not have a chance for a
  good-night kiss; and until Mr. Tozer called down the hall, at seven minutes
  after ten, "You going to stay up and chew the rag the whole blessed night,
  Bert?" he made himself agreeable by sitting on Martin's bed, looking
  derisively at his shabby baggage, and demanding the details of his parentage,
  religion, politics, and attitude toward the horrors of card-playing and
  dancing.</p>

  <p>At breakfast they all hoped that Martin would stay one more night in their
  home&mdash;plenty of room.</p>

  <p>Bert stated that Martin would come down-town at ten and be shown the bank,
  creamery, and wheat elevator.</p>

  <p>But at ten Martin and Leora were on the eastbound train. They got out at
  the county seat, Leopolis, a vast city of four thousand population, with a
  three-story building. At one that afternoon they were married, by the German
  Lutheran pastor. His study was a bareness surrounding a large, rusty
  wood-stove, and the witnesses, the pastor's wife and an old German who had
  been shoveling walks, sat on the wood-box and looked drowsy. Not till they
  had caught the afternoon train for Wheatsylvania did Martin and Leora escape
  from the ghostly apprehension which had hunted them all day. In the fetid
  train, huddled close, hands locked, innocently free of the alienation which
  the pomposity of weddings sometimes casts between lovers, they sighed, "Now
  what are we going to do&mdash;what <i>are</i> we going to do?"</p>

  <p>At the Wheatsylvania station they were met by the whole family,
  rampant.</p>

  <p>Bert had suspected elopement. He had searched half a dozen towns by
  long-distance telephone, and got through to the county clerk just after the
  license had been granted. It did not soften Bert's mood to have the clerk
  remark that if Martin and Leora were of age, there was nothing he could do,
  and he didn't "care a damn who's talking&mdash;I'm running this Office!"</p>

  <p>Bert had come to the station determined to make Martin perfect, even as
  Bert Tozer was perfect, and to do it right now.</p>

  <p>It was a dreadful evening in the Tozer mansion.</p>

  <p>Mr. Tozer said, with length, that Martin had undertaken
  responsibilities.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Tozer wept, and said that she hoped Ory had not, for certain reasons,
  <i>had</i> to be married&mdash;</p>

  <p>Bert said that if such was the case, he'd kill Martin&mdash;</p>

  <p>Ada Quist said that Ory could now see what came of pride and boasting
  about going off to her old Zenith&mdash;</p>

  <p>Mr. Tozer said that there was one good thing about it, anyway: Ory could
  see for herself that they couldn't let her go back to nursing school and get
  into more difficulties&mdash;</p>

  <p>Martin from time to time offered remarks to the effect that he was a good
  young man, a wonderful bacteriologist, and able to take care of <i>his</i>
  wife; but no one save Leora listened.</p>

  <p>Bert further propounded (while his father squeaked, "Now don't be
  <i>too</i> hard on the boy,") that if Martin <i>thought</i> for one single
  <i>second</i> that he was going to get one red <i>cent</i> out of the Tozers
  because he'd gone and butted <i>in</i> where nobody'd <i>invited</i> him, he,
  Bert, wanted to <i>know</i> about it, that was all, he certainly wanted to
  <i>know</i> about it!</p>

  <p>And Leora watched them, turning her little head from one to another. Once
  she came over to press Martin's hand. In the roughest of the storm, when
  Martin was beginning to glare, she drew from a mysterious pocket a box of
  very bad cigarettes, and lighted one. None of the Tozers had discovered that
  she smoked. Whatever they thought about her sex morals, her infidelity to
  United Brethrenism, and her general dementia, they had not suspected that she
  could commit such an obscenity as smoking. They charged on her, and Martin
  caught his breath savagely.</p>

  <p>During these fulminations Mr. Tozer had somehow made up his mind. He could
  at times take the lead away from Bert, whom he considered useful but slightly
  indiscreet, and unable to grasp the "full value of a dollar." (Mr. Tozer
  valued it at one dollar and ninety, but the progressive Bert at scarce more
  than one-fifty.) Mr. Tozer mildly gave orders:</p>

  <p>They were to stop "scrapping." They had no proof that Martin was
  necessarily a bad match for Ory. They would see. Martin would return to
  medical school at once, and be a good boy and get through as quickly as he
  could and begin to earn money. Ory would remain at home and behave
  herself&mdash;and she certainly would never act like a Bad Woman again, and
  smoke cigarettes. Meantime Martin and she would have no, uh, relations. (Mrs.
  Tozer looked embarrassed, and the hungrily attentive Ada Quist tried to
  blush.) They could write to each other once a week, but that was all. They
  would in no way, uh, act as though they were married till he gave
  permission.</p>

  <p>"Well?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>Doubtless Martin should have defied them and with his bride in his arms
  have gone forth into the night. But it seemed only a moment to graduation, to
  beginning his practice. He had Leora now, forever. For her, he must be
  sensible. He would return to work, and be Practical. Gottlieb's ideals of
  science? Laboratories? Research? Rot!</p>

  <p>"All right," he said.</p>

  <p>It did not occur to him that their abstention from love began tonight; it
  did not come to him till, holding out his hands to Leora, smiling with virtue
  at having determined to be prudent, he heard Mr. Tozer cackling, "Ory, you go
  on up to bed now&mdash;in your own room!"</p>

  <p>That was his bridal night; tossing in his bed, ten yards from her.</p>

  <p>Once he heard a door open, and thrilled to her coming. He waited, taut.
  She did not come. He peeped out, determined to find her room. His deep
  feeling about his brother-in-law suddenly increased. Bert was parading the
  hall, on guard. Had Bert been more formidable, Martin might have killed him,
  but he could not face that buck-toothed and nickering righteousness. He lay
  and resolved to curse them all in the morning and go off with Leora, but with
  the coming of the three-o'clock depression he perceived that with him she
  would probably starve, that he was disgraced, that it was not at all certain
  he would not become a drunkard.</p>

  <p>"Poor kid, I'm not going to spoil her life. God, I do love her! I'm going
  back, and the way I'm going to work&mdash;Can I stand this?"</p>

  <p>That was his bridal night and the barren dawn.</p>

  <p>Three days later he was walking into the office of Dr. Silva, dean of the
  Winnemac Medical School.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10">CHAPTER X.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">Dean Silva's secretary looked up delightedly, she hearkened
  with anticipation. But Martin said meekly, "Please, could I see the dean?"
  and meekly he waited, in the row of oak chairs beneath the Dawson Hunziker
  pharmaceutical calendar.</p>

  <p>When he had gone solemnly through the ground-glass door to the dean's
  office, he found Dr. Silva glowering. Seated, the little man seemed large, so
  domed was his head, so full his rounding mustache.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir!"</p>

  <p>Martin pleaded, "I'd like to come back, if you'll let me. Honest, I do
  apologize to you, and I'll go to Dr. Gottlieb and apologize&mdash;though
  honest, I can't lay down on Clif Clawson&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dr. Silva bounced up from his chair, bristling. Martin braced himself.
  Wasn't he welcome? Had he no home, anywhere? He could not fight. He had no
  more courage. He was so tired after the drab journey, after restraining
  himself from flaring out at the Tozers. He was so tired! He looked wistfully
  at the dean.</p>

  <p>The little man chuckled, "Never mind, boy. It's all right! We're glad
  you're back. Bother the apologies! I just wanted you to do whatever'd buck
  you up. It's good to have you back! I believed in you, and then I thought
  perhaps we'd lost you. Clumsy old man!"</p>

  <p>Martin was sobbing, too weak for restraint, too lonely and too weak, and
  Dr. Silva soothed, "Let's just go over everything and find out where the
  trouble was. What can I do? Understand, Martin, the thing I want most in life
  is to help give the world as many good physicians, great healers, as I can.
  What started your nervousness? Where have you been?"</p>

  <p>When Martin came to Leora and his marriage, Silva purred, "I'm delighted!
  She sounds like a splendid girl. Well, we must try and get you into Zenith
  General for your internship, a year from now, and make you able to support
  her properly."</p>

  <p>Martin remembered how often, how astringently, Gottlieb had sneered at
  "dese merry vedding or jail bells." He went away Silva's disciple; he went
  away to study furiously; and the brilliant insanity of Max Gottlieb's genius
  vanished from his faith.</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">Leora wrote that she had been dropped from the school of
  nursing for over-absence and for being married. She suspected that it was her
  father who had informed the hospital authorities. Then, it appeared, she had
  secretly sent for a shorthand book and, on pretense of helping Bert, she was
  using the typewriter in the bank, hoping that by next autumn she could join
  Martin and earn her own living as a stenographer.</p>

  <p>Once he offered to give up medicine, to take what work he could find and
  send for her. She refused.</p>

  <p>Though in his service to Leora and to the new god, Dean Silva, he had
  become austere, denying himself whisky, learning page on page of medicine
  with a frozen fury, he was always in a vacuum of desire for her, and always
  he ran the last block to his boarding-house, looking for a letter from her.
  Suddenly he had a plan. He had tasted shame&mdash;this one last shame would
  not matter. He would flee to her in Easter vacation; he would compel Tozer to
  support her while she studied stenography in Zenith; he would have her near
  him through the last year. He paid Clif the borrowed hundred, when the
  bi-monthly check came from Elk Mills, and calculated his finances to the
  penny. By not buying the suit he distressingly needed, he could manage it.
  Then for a month and more he had but two meals a day, and of those meals one
  was bread and butter and coffee. He washed his own linen in the bath-tub and,
  except for occasional fiercely delightful yieldings, he did not smoke.</p>

  <p>His return to Wheatsylvania was like his first flight, except that he
  talked less with fellow tramps, and all the way, between uneasy naps in the
  red-plush seats of coaches, he studied the bulky books of gynecology and
  internal medicine. He had written certain instructions to Leora. He met her
  on the edge of Wheatsylvania and they had a moment's talk, a resolute
  kiss.</p>

  <p>News spreads not slowly in Wheatsylvania. There is a certain interest in
  other people's affairs, and the eyes of citizens of whose existence Martin
  did not know had followed him from his arrival. When the culprits reached the
  bone-littered castle of the Tozer ogres, Leora's father and brother were
  already there, and raging. Old Andrew Jackson cried out upon them. He said
  that conceivably it may not have been insane in Martin to have "run away from
  school once, but to go and sneak back this second time was absolutely plumb
  crazy." Through his tirade, Martin and Leora smiled confidently.</p>

  <p>From Bert, "By God, sir, this is too much!" Bert had been reading fiction.
  "I object to the use of profanity, but when you come and annoy My Sister a
  second time, all I can say is, by God, sir, this is too blame much!"</p>

  <p>Martin looked meditatively out of the widow. He noticed three people
  strolling the muddy street. They all viewed the Tozer house with hopeful
  interest. Then he spoke steadily:</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tozer, I've been working hard. Everything has gone fine. But I've
  decided I don't care to live without my wife. I've come to take her back.
  Legally, you can't prevent me. I'll admit, without any argument, I can't
  support her yet, if I stay in the University. She's going to study
  stenography. She'll be supporting herself in a few months, and meanwhile I
  expect you to be decent enough to send her money."</p>

  <p>"This <i>is</i> too much," said Tozer, and Bert carried it on: "Fellow not
  only practically ruins a girl but comes and demands that we support her for
  him!"</p>

  <p>"All right. Just as you want. In the long run it'll be better for her and
  for me and for you if I finish medic school and have my profession, but if
  you won't take care of her, I'll chuck school, I'll go to work. Oh, I'll
  support her, all right! Only you'll never see her again. If you go on being
  idiots, she and I will leave here on the night train for the Coast, and
  that'll be the end." For the first time in his centuries of debate with the
  Tozers, he was melodramatic. He shook his fist under Bert's nose. "And if you
  try to prevent our going, God help you! And the way this town will laugh at
  you!...How about it, Leora? Are you ready to go away with
  me&mdash;forever?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said.</p>

  <p>They discussed it, greatly. Tozer and Bert struck attitudes of defense.
  They couldn't, they said, be bullied by anybody. Also, Martin was an
  Adventurer, and how did Leora know he wasn't planning to live on the money
  they sent her? In the end they crawled. They decided that this new, mature
  Martin, this new, hard-eyed Leora were ready to throw away everything for
  each other.</p>

  <p>Mr. Tozer whined a good deal, and promised to send her seventy dollars a
  month till she should be prepared for office-work.</p>

  <p>At the Wheatsylvania station, looking from the train window, Martin
  realized that this anxious-eyed, lip-puckering Andrew Jackson Tozer did love
  his daughter, did mourn her going.</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">He found for Leora a room on the frayed northern edge of
  Zenith, miles nearer Mohalis and the University than her hospital had been; a
  square white and blue room, with blotchy but shoulder-wise chairs. It looked
  out on breezy, stubbly waste land reaching to distant glittering railroad
  tracks. The landlady was a round German woman with an eye for romance. It is
  doubtful if she ever believed that they were married. She was a good
  woman.</p>

  <p>Leora's trunk had come. Her stenography books were primly set out on her
  little table and her pink felt slippers were arranged beneath the white iron
  bed. Martin stood with her at the window, mad with the pride of
  proprietorship. Suddenly he was so weak, so tired, that the mysterious cement
  which holds cell to cell seemed dissolved, and he felt that he was
  collapsing. But with knees rigidly straightening, his head back, his lips
  tight across his teeth, he caught himself, and cried, "Our first home!"</p>

  <p>That he should be with her, quiet, none disturbing, was intoxication.</p>

  <p>The commonplace room shone with peculiar light; the vigorous weeds and
  rough grass of the waste land were radiant under the April sun, and sparrows
  were cheeping.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Leora, with voice, then hungry lips.</p><br>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">Leora attended the Zenith University of Business
  Administration and Finance, which title indicated that it was a large and
  quite reasonably bad school for stenographers, bookkeepers, and such sons of
  Zenith brewers and politicians as were unable to enter even state
  universities. She trotted daily to the car-line, a neat, childish figure with
  note-books and sharpened pencils, to vanish in the horde of students. It was
  six months before she had learned enough stenography to obtain a place in an
  insurance office.</p>

  <p>Till Martin graduated they kept that room, their home, ever dearer. No one
  was so domestic as these birds of passage. At least two evenings a week
  Martin dashed in from Mohalis and studied there. She had a genius for keeping
  out of his way, for not demanding to be noticed, so that, while he plunged
  into his books as he never had done in Clif's rustling, grunting,
  expectorating company, he had ever the warm, half-conscious feeling of her
  presence. Sometimes, at midnight, just as he began to realize that he was
  hungry, he would find that a plate of sandwiches had by silent magic appeared
  at his elbow. He was none the less affectionate because he did not comment.
  She made him secure. She shut out the world that had pounded at him.</p>

  <p>On their walks, at dinner, in the dissolute and deliciously wasteful
  quarter-hour when they sat on the edge of the bed with comforters wrapped
  about them and smoked an inexcusable cigarette before breakfast, he explained
  his work to her, and when her own studying was done, she tried to read
  whichever of his books was not in use. Knowing nothing, never learning much,
  of the actual details of medicine, yet she understood&mdash;better it may be
  than Angus Duer&mdash;his philosophy and the basis of his work. If he had
  given up Gottlieb-worship and his yearning for the laboratory as for a
  sanctuary, if he had resolved to be a practical and wealth-mastering doctor,
  yet something of Gottlieb's spirit remained. He wanted to look behind details
  and impressive-sounding lists of technical terms for the causes of things,
  for general rules which might reduce the chaos of dissimilar and
  contradictory symptoms to the orderliness of chemistry.</p>

  <p>Saturday evening they went solemnly to the motion pictures&mdash;one-and
  two-reel films with Cowboy Billy Anderson and a girl later to be famous as
  Mary Pickford&mdash;and solemnly they discussed the non-existent plots as
  they returned, unconscious of other people on the streets; but when they
  walked into the country on a Sunday (with four sandwiches and a bottle of
  ginger ale in his threadbare pockets), he chased her up-hill and down-gully,
  and they lost their solemnity in joyous childishness. He intended, when he
  came to her room in the evening, to catch the owl-car to Mohalis and be near
  his work when he woke in the morning. He was resolute about it, always, and
  she admired his efficiency, but he never caught the car. The crew of the six
  o'clock morning interurban became used to a pale, quick-moving young man who
  sat hunched in a back seat, devouring large red books, absently gnawing a
  rather dreadful doughnut. But in this young man there was none of the
  heaviness of workers dragged out of bed at dawn for another gray and futile
  day of labor. He appeared curiously determined, curiously content.</p>

  <p>It was all so much easier, now that he was partly freed from the
  tyrannical honesty of Gottliebism, from the unswerving quest for causes
  which, as it drove through layer below layer, seemed ever farther from the
  bottommost principles, from the intolerable strain of learning day by day how
  much he did not know. It warmed him to escape from Gottlieb's ice-box into
  Dean Silva's neighborly world.</p>

  <p>Now and then he saw Gottlieb on the campus. They bowed in embarrassment
  and passed in haste.</p><br>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="first">There seemed to be no division between his Junior and Senior
  years. Because of the time he had lost, he had to remain in Mohalis all
  summer. The year and a half from his marriage to his graduation was one
  whirling bewilderment, without seasons or dates.</p>

  <p>When he had, as they put it, "cut out his nonsense and buckled down to
  work," he had won the admiration of Dr. Silva and all the Good Students,
  especially Angus Duer and the Reverend Ira Hinkley. Martin had always
  announced that he did not care for their approbation, for the applause of
  commonplace drudges, but now that he had it, he prized it. However much he
  scoffed, he was gratified when he was treated as a peer by Angus, who spent
  the summer as extern in the Zenith General Hospital, and who already had the
  unapproachable dignity of a successful young surgeon.</p>

  <p>Through that hot summer Martin and Leora labored, panting, and when they
  sat in her room, over their books and a stout pot of beer, neither their
  costumes nor their language had the decorum which one ought to expect from a
  romantic pair devoted to science and high endeavor. They were not very
  modest. Leora came to use, in her casual way, such words, such ancient
  Anglo-Saxon monosyllables, as would have dismayed Angus or Bert Tozer. On
  their evenings off they went economically to an imitation Coney Island beside
  a scummy and stinking lake, and with grave pleasure they ate Hot Dogs,
  painstakingly they rode the scenic railway.</p>

  <p>Their chief appetizer was Clif Clawson. Clif was never willingly alone or
  silent except when he was asleep. It is probable that his success in
  motor-salesmanship came entirely from his fondness for the enormous amounts
  of bright conversation which seem necessary in that occupation. How much of
  his attention to Martin and Leora was friendliness and how much of it was due
  to his fear of being alone cannot be determined, but certainly he entertained
  them and drew them out of themselves, and never seemed offended by the surly
  unwillingness with which Martin was sometimes guilty of greeting him.</p>

  <p>He would come roaring up to the house in a motor, the muffler always cut
  out. He would shout at their window, "Come on, you guys! Come out of it!
  Shake a leg! Lez have a little drive and get cooled off, and then I'll buy
  you a feed."</p>

  <p>That Martin had to work, Clif never comprehended. There was small excuse
  for Martin's occasional brutality in showing his annoyance but, now that he
  was fulfilled in Leora and quite thoroughly and selfishly careless as to what
  hungry need others might have of himself, now that he was in a rut of
  industry and satisfied companionship, he was bored by Clif's unchanging flood
  of heavy humor. It was Leora who was courteous. She had heard rather too
  often the seven jokes which, under varying guises, made up all of Clif's
  humor and philosophy, but she could sit for hours looking amiable while Clif
  told how clever he was at selling, and she sturdily reminded Martin that they
  would never have a friend more loyal or generous.</p>

  <p>But Clif went to New York, to a new motor agency, and Martin and Leora
  were more completely and happily dependent on each other than ever
  before.</p>

  <p>Their last agitation was removed by the complacence of Mr. Tozer. He was
  cordial now in all his letters, however much he irritated them by the
  parental advice with which he penalized them for every check he sent.</p><br>

  <h3>VI.</h3>

  <p class="first">None of the hectic activities of Senior year&mdash;neurology
  and pediatrics, practical work in obstetrics, taking of case-histories in the
  hospitals, attendance on operations, dressing wounds, learning not to look
  embarrassed when charity patients called one "Doctor"&mdash;was quite so
  important as the discussion of "What shall we do after graduation?"</p>

  <p>Is it necessary to be an intern for more than a year? Shall we remain
  general practitioners all our lives, or work toward becoming specialists?
  Which specialties are the best&mdash;that is, the best paid? Shall we settle
  in the country or in the city? How about going West? What about the army
  medical corps; salutes, riding-boots, pretty women, travel?</p>

  <p>This discussion they harried in the corridors of Main Medical, at the
  hospital, at lunch-rooms; and when Martin came home to Leora he went through
  it all again, very learnedly, very explanatorily. Almost every evening he
  "reached a decision" which was undecided again by morning.</p>

  <p>Once when Dr. Loizeau, professor of surgery, had operated before a clinic
  which included several renowned visiting doctors&mdash;the small white figure
  of the surgeon below them, slashing between life and death, dramatic as a
  great actor taking his curtain-call&mdash;Martin came away certain that he
  was for surgery. He agreed then with Angus Duer, who had just won the Hugh
  Loizeau Medal in Experimental Surgery, that the operator was the lion, the
  eagle, the soldier among doctors. Angus was one of the few who knew without
  wavering precisely what he was going to do: after his internship he was to
  join the celebrated Chicago clinic headed by Dr. Rouncefield, the eminent
  abdominal surgeon. He would, he said briefly, be making twenty thousand a
  year as a surgeon within five years.</p>

  <p>Martin explained it all to Leora. Surgery. Drama. Fearless nerves. Adoring
  assistants. Save lives. Science in devising new techniques. Make
  money&mdash;not be commercial, of course, but provide Leora with comforts. To
  Europe&mdash;they two together&mdash;gray London. Viennese cafes. Leora was
  useful to him during his oration. She blandly agreed; and the next evening,
  when he sought to prove that surgery was all rot and most surgeons merely
  good carpenters, she agreed more amiably than ever.</p>

  <p>Next to Angus, and the future medical missionary, Ira Hinkley, Fatty Pfaff
  was the first to discover what his future was. He was going to be an
  obstetrician&mdash;or, as the medical students called it technically, a
  "baby-snatcher." Fatty had the soul of a midwife; he sympathized with women
  in their gasping agony, sympathized honestly and almost tearfully, and he was
  magnificent at sitting still and drinking tea and waiting. During his first
  obstetrical case, when the student with him was merely nervous as they
  fidgeted by the bed in the hard desolation of the hospital room, Fatty was
  terrified, and he longed as he had never longed for anything in his flabby
  yet wistful life to comfort this gray-faced, straining, unknown woman, to
  take her pains on himself.</p>

  <p>While the others drifted, often by chance, often through relatives, into
  their various classes, Martin remained doubtful. He admired Dean Silva's
  insistence on the physician's immediate service to mankind, but he could not
  forget the cool ascetic hours in the laboratory. Toward the end of Senior
  year, decision became necessary, and he was moved by a speech in which Dean
  Silva condemned too much specialization and pictured the fine old country
  doctor, priest and father of his people, sane under open skies, serene in
  self-conquest. On top of this came urgent letters from Mr. Tozer, begging
  Martin to settle in Wheatsylvania.</p>

  <p>Tozer loved his daughter, apparently, and more or less liked Martin, and
  he wanted them near him. Wheatsylvania was a "good location," he said: solid
  Scandinavian and Dutch and German and Bohemian farmers who paid their bills.
  The nearest doctor was Hesselink, at Groningen, nine and a half miles away,
  and Hesselink had more than he could do. If they would come, he would help
  Martin buy his equipment: he would even send him a check now and then during
  his two-year hospital internship. Martin's capital was practically gone.
  Angus Duer and he had received appointments to Zenith General Hospital, where
  he would have an incomparable training, but Zenith General gave its interns,
  for the first year, nothing but board and room, and he had feared that he
  could not take the appointment. Tozer's offer excited him. All night Leora
  and he sat up working themselves into enthusiasm about the freedom of the
  West, about the kind hearts and friendly hands of the pioneers, about the
  heroism and usefulness of country doctors, and this time they reached a
  decision which remained decided.</p>

  <p>They would settle in Wheatsylvania.</p>

  <p>If he ached a little for research and Gottlieb's divine
  curiosity&mdash;well, he would be such a country doctor as Robert Koch! He
  would not degenerate into a bridge-playing, duck-hunting drone. He would have
  a small laboratory of his own. So he came to the end of the year and
  graduated, looking rather flustered in his cap and gown. Angus stood first
  and Martin seventh in the class. He said good-by, with lamentations and
  considerable beer; he found a room for Leora nearer to the hospital; and he
  emerged as Martin L. Arrowsmith, M.D., house physician in the Zenith General
  Hospital.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">The Boardman Box Factory was afire. All South Zenith was
  agitated by the glare on the low-hung clouds, the smell of scorched timber,
  the infernal bells of charging fire-apparatus. Miles of small wooden houses
  west of the factory were threatened, and shawled women, tousled men in
  trousers over nightshirts, tumbled out of bed and came running with a thick
  mutter of footsteps in the night-chilled streets.</p>

  <p>With professional calmness, firemen in helmets were stoking the dripping
  engines. Policemen tramped in front of the press of people, swinging their
  clubs, shouting, "Get back there, you!" The fire-line was sacred. Only the
  factory-owner and the reporters were admitted. A crazy-eyed factory-hand was
  stopped by a police sergeant.</p>

  <p>"My tools are in there!" he shrieked.</p>

  <p>"That don't make no never-minds," bawled the strutting sergeant.
  "<i>Nobody</i> can't get through here!"</p>

  <p>But one got through. They heard the blang-blang-blang of a racing
  ambulance, incessant, furious, defiant. Without orders, the crowd opened, and
  through them, almost grazing them, slid the huge gray car. At the back,
  haughty in white uniform, nonchalant on a narrow seat, was The
  Doctor&mdash;Martin Arrowsmith.</p>

  <p>The crowd admired him, the policemen sprang to receive him.</p>

  <p>"Where's the fireman got hurt?" he snapped.</p>

  <p>"Over in that shed," cried the police sergeant, running beside the
  ambulance.</p>

  <p>"Drive over closer. Nev' mind the smoke!" Martin barked at the driver.</p>

  <p>A lieutenant of firemen led him to a pile of sawdust on which was huddled
  an unconscious youngster, his face bloodless and clammy.</p>

  <p>"He got a bad dose of smoke from the green lumber and keeled over. Fine
  kid. Is he a goner?" the lieutenant begged.</p>

  <p>Martin knelt by the man, felt his pulse, listened to his breathing.
  Brusquely opening a black bag, he gave him a hypodermic of strychnin and held
  a vial of ammonia to his nose. "He'll come around. Here, you two, getum into
  the ambulance&mdash;hustle!"</p>

  <p>The police sergeant and the newest probationer patrolman sprang together,
  and together they mumbled, "All right, Doc."</p>

  <p>To Martin came the chief reporter of the Advocate-Times. In years he was
  only twenty-nine, but he was the oldest and perhaps the most cynical man in
  the world. He had interviewed senators; he had discovered graft in charity
  societies and even in prize-fights. There were fine wrinkles beside his eyes,
  he rolled Bull Durham cigarettes constantly, and his opinion of man's honor
  and woman's virtue was but low. Yet to Martin, or at least to The Doctor, he
  was polite.</p>

  <p>"Will he pull through, Doc?" he twanged.</p>

  <p>"Sure, I think so. Suffocation. Heart's still going."</p>

  <p>Martin yelped the last words from the step at the back of the ambulance as
  it went bumping and rocking through the factory yard, through the bitter
  smoke, toward the shrinking crowd. He owned and commanded the city, he and
  the driver. They ignored traffic regulations, they disdained the people,
  returning from theaters and movies, who dotted the streets which unrolled
  before the flying gray hood. Let 'em get out of the way! The traffic officer
  at Chickasaw and Twentieth heard them coming, speeding like the Midnight
  Express&mdash;urrrrrr&mdash;blang-blang-blang-blang&mdash;and cleared the
  noisy corner. People were jammed against the curb, threatened by rearing
  horses and backing motors, and past them hurled the ambulance,
  blang-blang-blang-blang, with The Doctor holding a strap and swinging easily
  on his perilous seat.</p>

  <p>At the hospital, the hall-man cried, "Shooting case in the Arbor,
  Doc."</p>

  <p>"All right. Wait'll I sneak in a drink," said Martin placidly. On the way
  to his room he passed the open door of the hospital laboratory, with its
  hacked bench, its lifeless rows of flasks and test-tubes.</p>

  <p>"Huh! That stuff! Poking 'round labs! This is real sure-enough life," he
  exulted, and he did not permit himself to see the vision of Max Gottlieb
  waiting there, so gaunt, so tired, so patient.</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">The six interns in Zenith General, including Martin and
  Angus Duer, lived in a long dark room with six camp beds, and six bureaus
  fantastic with photographs and ties and undarned socks. They spent hours
  sitting on their beds, arguing surgery versus internal medicine, planning the
  dinners which they hoped to enjoy on their nights off, and explaining to
  Martin, as the only married man, the virtues of the various nurses with whom,
  one by one, they fell in love.</p>

  <p>Martin found the hospital routine slightly dull. Though he developed the
  Intern's Walk, that quick corridor step with the stethoscope conspicuous in
  the pocket, he did not, he could not, develop the bedside manner. He was
  sorry for the bruised, yellowed, suffering patients, always changing as to
  individuals and never changing as a mass of drab pain, but when he had thrice
  dressed a wound, he had had enough; he wanted to go on to new experiences.
  Yet the ambulance work outside the hospital was endlessly stimulating to his
  pride.</p>

  <p>The Doctor, and The Doctor alone, was safe by night in the slum called
  "the Arbor." His black bag was a pass. Policemen saluted him, prostitutes
  bowed to him without mockery, saloon-keepers called out, "Evenin', Doc," and
  hold-up men stood back in doorways to let him pass. Martin had power, the
  first obvious power in his life. And he was led into incessant adventure.</p>

  <p>He took a bank-president out of a dive; he helped the family conceal the
  disgrace; he irritably refused their bribe; and afterward, when he thought of
  how he might have dined with Leora, he was sorry he had refused it. He broke
  into hotel-rooms reeking with gas and revived would-be suicides. He drank
  Trinidad rum with a Congressman who advocated prohibition. He attended a
  policeman assaulted by strikers, and a striker assaulted by policemen. He
  assisted at an emergency abdominal operation at three o'clock in the morning.
  The operating-room&mdash;white tile walls and white tile floor and glittering
  frosted-glass skylight&mdash;seemed lined with fire-lit ice, and the large
  incandescents glared on the glass instrument cases, the cruel little knives.
  The surgeon, in long white gown, white turban, and pale orange rubber gloves,
  made his swift incision in the square of yellowish flesh exposed between
  towels, cutting deep into layers of fat, and Martin looked on unmoved as the
  first blood menacingly followed the cut. And a month after, during the
  Chaloosa River flood, he worked for seventy-six hours, with half-hours of
  sleep in the ambulance or on a police-station table.</p>

  <p>He landed from a boat at what had been the second story of a tenement and
  delivered a baby on the top floor; he bound up heads and arms for a line of
  men; but what gave him glory was the perfectly foolhardy feat of swimming the
  flood to save five children marooned and terrified on a bobbing church pew.
  The newspapers gave him large headlines, and when he had returned to kiss
  Leora and sleep twelve hours, he lay and thought about research with salty
  self-defensive scorn.</p>

  <p>"Gottlieb, the poor old impractical fusser! I'd like to see him swim that
  current!" jeered Dr. Arrowsmith to Martin.</p>

  <p>But on night duty, alone, he had to face the self he had been afraid to
  uncover, and he was homesick for the laboratory, for the thrill of uncharted
  discoveries, the quest below the surface and beyond the moment, the search
  for fundamental laws which the scientist (however blasphemously and
  colloquially he may describe it) exalts above temporary healing as the
  religious exalts the nature and terrible glory of God above pleasant daily
  virtues. With this sadness there was envy that he should be left out of
  things, that others should go ahead of him, ever surer in technique, more
  widely aware of the phenomena of biological chemistry, more deeply daring to
  explain laws at which the pioneers had but fumbled and hinted.</p>

  <p>In his second year of internship, when the thrills of fires and floods and
  murder became as obvious a routine as bookkeeping, when he had seen the
  strangely few ways in which mankind can contrive to injure themselves and
  slaughter one another, when it was merely wearing to have to live up to the
  pretentiousness of being The Doctor, Martin tried to satisfy and perhaps kill
  his guilty scientific lust by voluntary scrabbling about the hospital
  laboratory, correlating the blood counts in pernicious anemia. His trifling
  with the drug of research was risky. Amid the bustle of operations he began
  to picture the rapt quietude of the laboratory. "I better cut this out," he
  said to Leora, "if I'm going to settle down in Wheatsylvania and tend to
  business and make a living&mdash;and I by golly am!"</p>

  <p>Dean Silva often came to the hospital on consultations. He passed through
  the lobby one evening when Leora, returned from the office where she was a
  stenographer, was meeting Martin for dinner. Martin introduced them, and the
  little man held her hand, purred at her, and squeaked, "Will you children
  give me the pleasure of taking you to dinner? My wife has deserted me. I am a
  lone and misanthropic man."</p>

  <p>He trotted between them, round and happy. Martin and he were not student
  and teacher, but two doctors together, for Dean Silva was one pedagogue who
  could still be interested in a man who no longer sat at his feet. He led the
  two starvelings to a chop-house and in a settle-walled booth he craftily
  stuffed them with roast goose and mugs of ale.</p>

  <p>He concentrated on Leora, but his talk was of Martin:</p>

  <p>"Your husband must be an Artist Healer, not a picker of trifles like these
  laboratory men."</p>

  <p>"But Gottlieb's no picker of trifles," insisted Martin.</p>

  <p>"No-o. But with him&mdash;It's a difference of one's gods. Gottlieb's gods
  are the cynics, the destroyers&mdash;crapehangers the vulgar call 'em:
  Diderot and Voltaire and Elser; great men, wonder-workers, yet men that had
  more fun destroying other people's theories than creating their own. But my
  gods now, they're the men who took the discoveries of Gottlieb's gods and
  turned them to the use of human beings&mdash;made them come alive!</p>

  <p>"All credit to the men who invented paint and canvas, but there's more
  credit, eh? to the Raphaels and Holbeins who used those discoveries! Laennec
  and Osler, those are the men! It's all very fine, this business of pure
  research: seeking the truth, unhampered by commercialism or fame-chasing.
  Getting to the bottom. Ignoring consequences and practical uses. But do you
  realize if you carry that idea far enough, a man could justify himself for
  doing nothing but count the cobblestones on Warehouse Avenue&mdash;yes and
  justify himself for torturing people just to see how they screamed&mdash;and
  then sneer at a man who was making millions of people well and happy!</p>

  <p>"No, no! Mrs. Arrowsmith, this lad Martin is a passionate fellow, not a
  drudge. He must be passionate on behalf of mankind. He's chosen the highest
  calling in the world, but he's a feckless, experimental devil. You must keep
  him at it, my dear, and not let the world lose the benefit of his
  passion."</p>

  <p>After this solemnity Dad Silva took them to a musical comedy and sat
  between them, patting Martin's shoulder, patting Leora's arm, choking with
  delight when the comedian stepped into the pail of whitewash. In midnight
  volubility Martin and Leora sputtered their affection for him, and saw their
  Wheatsylvania venture as glory and salvation.</p>

  <p>But a few days before the end of Martin's internship and their migration
  to North Dakota, they met Max Gottlieb on the street.</p>

  <p>Martin had not seen him for more than a year; Leora never. He looked
  worried and ill. While Martin was agonizing as to whether to pass with a bow,
  Gottlieb stopped.</p>

  <p>"How is everything, Martin?" he said cordially. But his eyes said, "Why
  have you never come back to me?"</p>

  <p>The boy stammered something, nothing, and when Gottlieb had gone by,
  stooped and moving as in pain, he longed to run after him.</p>

  <p>Leora was demanding, "Is that the Professor Gottlieb you're always talking
  about?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Say! How does he strike you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't&mdash;Sandy, he's the greatest man I've ever seen! I don't know
  how I know, but he is! Dr. Silva is a darling, but that was a <i>great</i>
  man! I wish&mdash;I wish we were going to see him again. There's the first
  man I ever laid eyes on that I'd leave you for, if he wanted me. He's
  so&mdash;oh, he's like a sword&mdash;no, he's like a brain walking. Oh,
  Sandy, he looked so wretched. I wanted to cry. I'd black his shoes!"</p>

  <p>"God! So would I!"</p>

  <p>But in the bustle of leaving Zenith, the excitement of the journey to
  Wheatsylvania, the scramble of his state examinations, the dignity of being a
  Practicing Physician, he forgot Gottlieb, and on that Dakota prairie radiant
  in early June, with meadow larks on every fence post, he began his work.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">At the moment when Martin met him on the street, Gottlieb
  was ruined.</p>

  <p>Max Gottlieb was a German Jew, born in Saxony in 1850. Though he took his
  medical degree, at Heidelberg, he was never interested in practicing
  medicine. He was a follower of Helmholtz, and youthful researches in the
  physics of sound convinced him of the need of the quantitative method in the
  medical sciences. Then Koch's discoveries drew him into biology. Always an
  elaborately careful worker, a maker of long rows of figures, always realizing
  the presence of uncontrollable variables, always a vicious assailant of what
  he considered slackness or lie or pomposity, never too kindly to
  well-intentioned stupidity, he worked in the laboratories of Koch, of
  Pasteur, he followed the early statements of Pearson in biometrics, he drank
  beer and wrote vitriolic letters, he voyaged to Italy and England and
  Scandinavia, and casually, between two days, he married (as he might have
  bought a coat or hired a housekeeper) the patient and wordless daughter of a
  Gentile merchant.</p>

  <p>Then began a series of experiments, very important, very
  undramatic-sounding, very long, and exceedingly unappreciated. Back in 1881
  he was confirming Pasteur's results in chicken cholera immunity and, for
  relief and pastime, trying to separate an enzyme from yeast. A few years
  later, living on the tiny inheritance from his father, a petty banker, and
  quite carelessly and cheerfully exhausting it, he was analyzing critically
  the ptomain theory of disease, and investigating the mechanism of the
  attenuation of virulence of microorganisms. He got thereby small fame.
  Perhaps he was over-cautious, and more than the devil or starvation he hated
  men who rushed into publication unprepared.</p>

  <p>Though he meddled little in politics, considering them the most
  repetitious and least scientific of human activities, he was a sufficiently
  patriotic German to hate the Junkers. As a youngster he had a fight or two
  with ruffling subalterns; once he spent a week in jail; often he was
  infuriated by discriminations against Jews: and at forty he went sadly off to
  the America which could never become militaristic or anti-Semitic&mdash;to
  the Hoagland Laboratory in Brooklyn, then to Queen City University as
  professor of bacteriology.</p>

  <p>Here he made his first investigation of toxin-anti-toxin reactions. He
  announced that antibodies, excepting antitoxin, had no relation to the immune
  state of an animal, and while he himself was being ragingly denounced in the
  small but hectic world of scientists, he dealt calmly and most brutally with
  Yersin's and Marmorek's theories of sera.</p>

  <p>His dearest dream, now and for years of racking research, was the
  artificial production of antitoxin&mdash;its production in vitro. Once he was
  prepared to publish, but he found an error and rigidly suppressed his notes.
  All the while he was lonely. There was apparently no one in Queen City who
  regarded him as other than a cranky Jew catching microbes by their little
  tails and leering at them&mdash;no work for a tall man at a time when heroes
  were building bridges, experimenting with Horseless Carriages, writing the
  first of the poetic Compelling Ads, and selling miles of calico and
  cigars.</p>

  <p>In 1899 he was called to the University of Winnemac, as professor of
  bacteriology in the medical school, and here he drudged on for a dozen years.
  Not once did he talk of results of the sort called "practical"; not once did
  he cease warring on the post hoc propter hoc conclusions which still make up
  most medical lore; not once did he fail to be hated by his colleagues, who
  were respectful to his face, uncomfortable in feeling his ironic power, but
  privily joyous to call him Mephisto, Diabolist, Killjoy, Pessimist,
  Destructive Critic, Flippant Cynic, Scientific Bounder Lacking in Dignity and
  Seriousness, Intellectual Snob, Pacifist, Anarchist, Atheist, Jew. They said,
  with reason, that he was so devoted to Pure Science, to art for art's sake,
  that he would rather have people die by the right therapy than be cured by
  the wrong. Having built a shrine for humanity, he wanted to kick out of it
  all mere human beings.</p>

  <p>The total number of his papers, in a brisk scientific realm where really
  clever people published five times a year, was not more than twenty-five in
  thirty years. They were all exquisitely finished, all easily reduplicated and
  checked by the doubtfulest critics.</p>

  <p>At Mohalis he was pleased by large facilities for work, by excellent
  assistants, endless glassware, plenty of guinea pigs, enough monkeys; but he
  was bored by the round of teaching, and melancholy again in a lack of
  understanding friends. Always he sought someone to whom he could talk without
  suspicion or caution. He was human enough, when he meditated upon the
  exaltation of doctors bold through ignorance, of inventors who were but
  tinkers magnified, to be irritated by his lack of fame in America, even in
  Mohalis, and to complain not too nobly.</p>

  <p>He had never dined with a duchess, never received a prize, never been
  interviewed, never produced anything which the public could understand, nor
  experienced anything since his schoolboy amours which nice people could
  regard as romantic. He was, in fact, an authentic scientist.</p>

  <p>He was of the great benefactors of humanity. There will never, in any age,
  be an effort to end the great epidemics or the petty infections which will
  not have been influenced by Max Gottlieb's researches, for he was not one who
  tagged and prettily classified bacteria and protozoa. He sought their
  chemistry, the laws of their existence and destruction, basic laws for the
  most part unknown after a generation of busy biologists. Yet they were right
  who called him "pessimist," for this man who, as much as any other, will have
  been the cause of reducing infectious diseases to almost-zero often doubted
  the value of reducing infectious diseases at all.</p>

  <p>He reflected (it was an international debate in which he was joined by a
  few and damned by many) that half a dozen generations nearly free from
  epidemics would produce a race so low in natural immunity that when a great
  plague, suddenly springing from almost-zero to a world-smothering cloud,
  appeared again, it might wipe out the world entire, so that the measures to
  save lives to which he lent his genius might in the end be the destruction of
  all human life.</p>

  <p>He meditated that if science and public hygiene did remove tuberculosis
  and the other major plagues, the world was grimly certain to become so
  overcrowded, to become such a universal slave-packed shambles, that all
  beauty and ease and wisdom would disappear in a famine-driven scamper for
  existence. Yet these speculations never checked his work. If the future
  became overcrowded, the future must by birth-control or otherwise look to
  itself. Perhaps it would, he reflected. But even this drop of wholesome
  optimism was lacking in his final doubts. For he doubted all progress of the
  intellect and the emotions, and he doubted, most of all, the superiority of
  divine mankind to the cheerful dogs, the infallibly graceful cats, the
  unmoral and unagitated and irreligious horses, the superbly adventuring
  seagulls.</p>

  <p>While medical quacks, manufacturers of patent medicines, chewing-gum
  salesmen, and high priests of advertising lived in large houses, attended by
  servants, and took their sacred persons abroad in limousines, Max Gottlieb
  dwelt in a cramped cottage whose paint was peeling, and rode to his
  laboratory on an ancient and squeaky bicycle. Gottlieb himself protested
  rarely. He was not so unreasonable&mdash;usually&mdash;as to demand both
  freedom and the fruits of popular slavery. "Why," he once said to Martin,
  "should the world pay me for doing what I want and what they do not
  want?"</p>

  <p>If in his house there was but one comfortable chair, on his desk were
  letters, long, intimate, and respectful, from the great ones of France and
  Germany, Italy and Denmark, and from scientists whom Great Britain so much
  valued that she gave them titles almost as high as those with which she
  rewarded distillers, cigarette-manufacturers, and the owners of obscene
  newspapers.</p>

  <p>But poverty kept him from fulfillment of his summer longing to sit beneath
  the poplars by the Rhine or the tranquil Seine, at a table on whose checkered
  cloth were bread and cheese and wine and dusky cherries, those ancient and
  holy simplicities of all the world.</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">Max Gottlieb's wife was thick and slow-moving and mute; at
  sixty she had not learned to speak easy English; and her German was of the
  small-town bourgeois, who pay their debts and over-eat and grow red. If he
  was not confidential with her, if at table he forgot her in long reflections,
  neither was he unkind or impatient, and he depended on her housekeeping, her
  warming of his old-fashioned nightgown. She had not been well of late. She
  had nausea and indigestion, but she kept on with her work. Always you heard
  her old slippers slapping about the house.</p>

  <p>They had three children, all born when Gottlieb was over thirty-eight:
  Miriam, the youngest, an ardent child who had a touch at the piano, an
  instinct about Beethoven, and hatred for the "ragtime" popular in America; an
  older sister who was nothing in particular; and their boy Robert&mdash;Robert
  Koch Gottlieb. He was a wild thing and a distress. They sent him, with
  anxiety over the cost, to a smart school near Zenith, where he met the sons
  of manufacturers and discovered a taste for fast motors and eccentric
  clothes, and no taste what ever for studying. At home he clamored that his
  father was a "tightwad." When Gottlieb sought to make it clear that he was a
  poor man, the boy answered that out of his poverty he was always sneakingly
  spending money on his researches&mdash;he had no right to do that and shame
  his son&mdash;let the confounded University provide him with
  material!</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">There were few of Gottlieb's students who saw him and his
  learning as anything but hurdles to be leaped as quickly as possible. One of
  the few was Martin Arrowsmith.</p>

  <p>However harshly he may have pointed out Martin's errors, however loftily
  he may have seemed to ignore his devotion, Gottlieb was as aware of Martin as
  Martin of him. He planned vast things. If Martin really desired his help
  (Gottlieb could be as modest personally as he was egotistic and swaggering in
  competitive science), he would make the boy's career his own. During Martin's
  minute original research, Gottlieb rejoiced in his willingness to abandon
  conventional&mdash;and convenient&mdash;theories of immunology and in the
  exasperated carefulness with which he checked results. When Martin for
  unknown reasons became careless, when he was obviously drinking too much,
  obviously mixed up in some absurd personal affair, it was tragic hunger for
  friends and flaming respect for excellent work which drove Gottlieb to snarl
  at him. Of the apologies demanded by Silva he had no notion. He would have
  raged&mdash;</p>

  <p>He waited for Martin to return. He blamed himself: "Fool! There was a fine
  spirit. You should have known one does not use a platinum loop for shoveling
  coal." As long as he could (while Martin was dish-washing and wandering on
  improbable trains between impossible towns), he put off the appointment of a
  new assistant. Then all his wistfulness chilled to anger. He considered
  Martin a traitor, and put him out of his mind.</p><br>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">It is possible that Max Gottlieb was a genius. Certainly he
  was mad as any genius. He did, during the period of Martin's internship in
  Zenith General, a thing more preposterous than any of the superstitions at
  which he scoffed.</p>

  <p>He tried to become an executive and a reformer! He, the cynic, the anarch,
  tried to found an Institution, and he went at it like a spinster organizing a
  league to keep small boys from learning naughty words.</p>

  <p>He conceived that there might, in this world, be a medical school which
  should be altogether scientific, ruled by exact quantitative biology and
  chemistry, with spectacle-fitting and most of surgery ignored, and he further
  conceived that such an enterprise might be conducted at the University of
  Winnemac! He tried to be practical about it; oh, he was extremely practical
  and plausible!</p>

  <p>"I admit we should not be able to turn out doctors to cure village
  bellyaches. And ordinary physicians are admirable and altogether
  necessary&mdash;perhaps. But there are too many of them already. And on the
  'practical' side, you gif me twenty years of a school that is precise and
  cautious, and we shall cure diabetes, maybe tuberculosis and cancer, and all
  these arthritis things that the carpenters shake their heads at them and call
  them 'rheumatism.' So!"</p>

  <p>He did not desire the control of such a school, nor any credit. He was too
  busy. But at a meeting of the American Academy of Sciences he met one Dr.
  Entwisle, a youngish physiologist from Harvard, who would make an excellent
  dean. Entwisle admired him, and sounded him on his willingness to be called
  to Harvard. When Gottlieb outlined his new sort of medical school, Entwisle
  was fervent. "Nothing I'd like so much as to have a chance at a place like
  that," he fluttered, and Gottlieb went back to Mohalis triumphant. He was the
  more assured because (though he sardonically refused it) he was at this time
  offered the medical deanship of the University of West Chippewa.</p>

  <p>So simple, or so insane, was he that he wrote to Dean Silva politely
  bidding him step down and hand over his school&mdash;his work, his
  life&mdash;to an unknown teacher in Harvard! A courteous old gentleman was
  Dad Silva, a fit disciple of Osler, but this incredible letter killed his
  patience. He replied that while he could see the value of basic research, the
  medical school belonged to the people of the state, and its task was to
  provide them with immediate and practical attention. For himself, he hinted,
  if he ever believed that the school would profit by his resignation he would
  go at once, but he needed a rather broader suggestion than a letter from one
  of his own subordinates!</p>

  <p>Gottlieb retorted with spirit and indiscretion. He damned the People of
  the State of Winnemac. Were they, in their present condition of
  nincompoopery, worth any sort of attention? He unjustifiably took his demand
  over Silva's head to that great orator and patriot, Dr. Horace Greeley
  Truscott, president of the University.</p>

  <p>President Truscott said, "Really, I'm too engrossed to consider chimerical
  schemes, however ingenious they may be."</p>

  <p>"You are too busy to consider anything but selling honorary degrees to
  millionaires for gymnasiums," remarked Gottlieb.</p>

  <p>Next day he was summoned to a special meeting of the University Council.
  As head of the medical department of bacteriology, Gottlieb was a member of
  this all-ruling body, and when he entered the long Council Chamber, with its
  gilt ceiling, its heavy maroon curtains, its somber paintings of pioneers, he
  started for his usual seat, unconscious of the knot of whispering members,
  meditating on far-off absorbing things.</p>

  <p>"Oh, uh, Professor Gottlieb, will you please sit down there at the far end
  of the table?" called President Truscott.</p>

  <p>Then Gottlieb was aware of tensions. He saw that out of the seven members
  of the Board of Regents, the four who lived in or near Zenith were present.
  He saw that sitting beside Truscott was not the dean of the academic
  department but Dean Silva. He saw that however easily they talked, they were
  looking at him through the mist of their chatter.</p>

  <p>President Truscott announced, "Gentlemen, this joint meeting of the
  Council and the regents is to consider charges against Professor Max Gottlieb
  preferred by his dean and by myself."</p>

  <p>Gottlieb suddenly looked old.</p>

  <p>"These charges are: Disloyalty to his dean, his president, his regents and
  to the State of Winnemac. Disloyalty to recognized medical and scholastic
  ethics. Insane egotism. Atheism. Persistent failure to collaborate with his
  colleagues, and such inability to understand practical affairs as makes it
  dangerous to let him conduct the important laboratories and classes with
  which we have entrusted him. Gentlemen, I shall now prove each of these
  points, from Professor Gottlieb's own letters to Dean Silva."</p>

  <p>He proved them.</p>

  <p>The chairman of the Board of Regents suggested, "Gottlieb, I think it
  would simplify things if you just handed us your resignation and permitted us
  to part in good feeling, instead of having the unpleasant&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm damned if I will resign!" Gottlieb was on his feet, a lean fury.
  "Because you all haf schoolboy minds, golf-links minds, you are twisting my
  expression, and perfectly accurate expression, of a sound revolutionary
  ideal, which would personally to me be of no value or advantage whatefer,
  into a desire to steal promotions. That fools should judge honor&mdash;!" His
  long forefinger was a fish-hook, reaching for President Truscott's soul. "No!
  I will not resign! You can cast me out!"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid, then, we must ask you to leave the room while we vote." The
  president was very suave, for so large and strong and hearty a man.</p>

  <p>Gottlieb rode his wavering bicycle to the laboratory. It was by telephone
  message from a brusque girl clerk in the president's office that he was
  informed that "his resignation had been accepted."</p>

  <p>He agonized, "Discharge me? They couldn't! I'm the chief glory, the only
  glory, of this shopkeepers' school!" When he comprehended that apparently
  they very much had discharged him, he was shamed that he should have given
  them a chance to kick him. But the really dismaying thing was that he should
  by an effort to be a politician have interrupted the sacred work.</p>

  <p>He required peace and a laboratory, at once.</p>

  <p>They'd see what fools they were when they heard that Harvard had called
  him!</p>

  <p>He was eager for the mellower ways of Cambridge and Boston. Why had he
  remained so long in raw Mohalis? He wrote to Dr. Entwisle, hinting that he
  was willing to hear an offer. He expected a telegram. He waited a week, then
  had a long letter from Entwisle admitting that he had been premature in
  speaking for the Harvard faculty. Entwisle presented the faculty's
  compliments and their hope that some time they might have the honor of his
  presence, but as things were now&mdash;</p>

  <p>Gottlieb wrote to the University of West Chippewa that, after all, he was
  willing to think about their medical deanship...and had answer that the place
  was filled, that they had not greatly liked the tone of his former letter,
  and they did not "care to go into the matter further."</p>

  <p>At sixty-one, Gottlieb had saved but a few hundred dollars&mdash;literally
  a few hundred. Like any bricklayer out of work, he had to have a job or go
  hungry. He was no longer a genius impatient of interrupted creation but a
  shabby schoolmaster in disgrace.</p>

  <p>He prowled through his little brown house, fingering papers, staring at
  his wife, staring at old pictures, staring at nothing. He still had a month
  of teaching&mdash;they had dated ahead the resignation which they had written
  for him&mdash;but he was too dispirited to go to the laboratory. He felt
  unwanted, almost unsafe. His ancient sureness was broken into self-pity. He
  waited from delivery to delivery for the mail. Surely there would be aid from
  somebody who knew what he was, what he meant. There were many friendly
  letters about research, but the sort of men with whom he corresponded did not
  listen to intercollegiate faculty tattle nor know of his need.</p>

  <p>He could not, after the Harvard mischance and the West Chippewa rebuke,
  approach the universities or the scientific institutes, and he was too proud
  to write begging letters to the men who revered him. No, he would be
  business-like! He applied to a Chicago teachers' agency, and received a
  stilted answer promising to look about and inquiring whether he would care to
  take the position of teacher of physics and chemistry in a suburban high
  school.</p>

  <p>Before he had sufficiently recovered from his fury to be able to reply,
  his household was overwhelmed by his wife's sudden agony.</p>

  <p>She had been unwell for months. He had wanted her to see a physician, but
  she had refused, and all the while she was stolidly terrified by the fear
  that she had cancer of the stomach. Now when she began to vomit blood, she
  cried to him for help. The Gottlieb who scoffed at medical credos, at
  "carpenters" and "pill mongers," had forgotten what he knew of diagnosis, and
  when he was ill, or his family, he called for the doctor as desperately as
  any backwoods layman to whom illness was the black malignity of unknown
  devils.</p>

  <p>In unbelievable simplicity he considered that, as his quarrel with Silva
  was not personal, he could still summon him, and this time he was justified.
  Silva came, full of excessive benignity, chuckling to himself, "When he's got
  something the matter, he doesn't run for Arrhenius or Jacques Loeb, but for
  me!" Into the meager cottage the little man brought strength, and Gottlieb
  gazed down on him trustingly.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Gottlieb was suffering. Silva gave her morphine. Not without
  satisfaction he learned that Gottlieb did not even know the dose. He examined
  her&mdash;his pudgy hands had the sensitiveness if not the precision of
  Gottlieb's skeleton fingers. He peered about the airless bedroom: the dark
  green curtains, the crucifix on the dumpy bureau, the color-print of a
  virtuously voluptuous maiden. He was bothered by an impression of having
  recently been in the room. He remembered. It was the twin of the doleful
  chamber of a German grocer whom he had seen during a consultation a month
  ago.</p>

  <p>He spoke to Gottlieb not as to a colleague or an enemy but as a patient,
  to be cheered.</p>

  <p>"Don't think there's any tumorous mass. As of course you know, Doctor, you
  can tell such a lot by the differences in the shape of the lower border of
  the ribs, and by the surface of the belly during deep breathing."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yesss."</p>

  <p>"I don't think you need to worry in the least. We'd better hustle her off
  to the University Hospital, and we'll give her a test meal and get her
  X-rayed and take a look for Boas-Oppler bugs."</p>

  <p>She was taken away, heavy, inert, carried down the cottage steps. Gottlieb
  was with her. Whether or not he loved her, whether he was capable of ordinary
  domestic affection, could not be discovered. The need of turning to Dean
  Silva had damaged his opinion of his own wisdom. It was the final affront,
  more subtle and more enervating than the offer to teach chemistry to
  children. As he sat by her bed, his dark face was blank, and the wrinkles
  which deepened across that mask may have been sorrow, may have been
  fear...Nor is it known how, through the secure and uninvaded years, he had
  regarded his wife's crucifix, which Silva had spied on their bureau&mdash;a
  gaudy plaster crucifix on a box set with gilded shells.</p>

  <p>Silva diagnosed it as probable gastric ulcer, and placed her on treatment,
  with light and frequent meals. She improved, but she remained in the hospital
  for four weeks, and Gottlieb wondered: Are these doctors deceiving us? Is it
  really cancer, which by Their mystic craft They are concealing from me who
  know naught?</p>

  <p>Robbed of her silent assuring presence on which night by weary night he
  had depended, he fretted over his daughters, despaired at their noisy
  piano-practice, their inability to manage the slattern maid. When they had
  gone to bed he sat alone in the pale lamplight, unmoving, not reading. He was
  bewildered. His haughty self was like a robber baron fallen into the hands of
  rebellious slaves, stooped under a filthy load, the proud eye rheumy and
  patient with despair, the sword hand chopped off, obscene flies crawling
  across the gnawed wrist.</p>

  <p>It was at this time that he encountered Martin and Leora on the street in
  Zenith.</p>

  <p>He did not look back when they had passed him, but all that afternoon he
  brooded on them. "That girl, maybe it was she that stole Martin from
  me&mdash;from science! No! He was right. One sees what happens to the fools
  like me!"</p>

  <p>On the day after Martin and Leora had started for Wheatsylvania, singing,
  Gottlieb went to Chicago to see the teachers' agency.</p>

  <p>The firm was controlled by a Live Wire who had once been a county
  superintendent of schools. He was not much interested. Gottlieb lost his
  temper: "Do you make an endeavor to find positions for teachers, or do you
  merely send out circulars to amuse yourself? Haf you looked up my record? Do
  you know who I am?"</p>

  <p>The agent roared, "Oh, we know about you, all right, all right! I didn't
  when I first wrote you, but&mdash;You seem to have a good record as a
  laboratory man, though I don't see that you've produced anything of the
  slightest use in medicine. We had hoped to give you a chance such as you nor
  nobody else ever had. John Edtooth, the Oklahoma oil magnate, has decided to
  found a university that for plant and endowment and individuality will beat
  anything that's ever been pulled off in education&mdash;biggest gymnasium in
  the world, with an ex-New York Giant for baseball coach! We thought maybe we
  might work you in on the bacteriology or the physiology&mdash;I guess you
  could manage to teach that, too, if you boned up on it. But we've been making
  some inquiries. From some good friends of ours, down Winnemac way. And we
  find that you're not to be trusted with a position of real responsibility.
  Why, they fired you for general incompetence! But now that you've had your
  lesson&mdash;Do you think you'd be competent to teach Practical Hygiene in
  Edtooth University?"</p>

  <p>Gottlieb was so angry that he forgot to speak English, and as all his
  cursing was in student German, in a creaky dry voice, the whole scene was
  very funny indeed to the cackling bookkeeper and the girl stenographers. When
  he went from that place Max Gottlieb walked slowly, without purpose, and in
  his eyes were senile tears.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">No one in the medical world had ever damned more heartily
  than Gottlieb the commercialism of certain large pharmaceutical firms,
  particularly Dawson T. Hunziker &amp; Co., Inc., of Pittsburgh. The Hunziker
  Company was an old and ethical house which dealt only with reputable
  doctors&mdash;or practically only with reputable doctors. It furnished
  excellent antitoxins for diphtheria and tetanus, as well as the purest of
  official preparations, with the plainest and most official-looking labels on
  the swaggeringly modest brown bottles. Gottlieb had asserted that they
  produced doubtful vaccines, yet he returned from Chicago to write to Dawson
  Hunziker that he was no longer interested in teaching, and he would be
  willing to work for them on half time if he might use their laboratories, on
  possibly important research, for the rest of the day.</p>

  <p>When the letter had gone he sat mumbling. He was certainly not altogether
  sane. "Education! Biggest gymnasium in the world! Incapable of
  responsibility. Teaching I can do no more. But Hunziker will laugh at me. I
  haf told the truth about him and I shall haf to&mdash;Dear Gott, what shall I
  do?"</p>

  <p>Into this still frenzy, while his frightened daughters peered at him from
  doorways, hope glided.</p>

  <p>The telephone rang. He did not answer it. On the third irascible burring
  he took up the receiver and grumbled, "Yes, yes, vot iss it?"</p>

  <p>A twanging nonchalant voice: "This M. C. Gottlieb?"</p>

  <p>"This is Dr. Gottlieb!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I guess you're the party. Hola wire. Long distance wants yuh."</p>

  <p>Then, "Professor Gottlieb? This is Dawson Hunziker speaking. From
  Pittsburgh. My dear fellow, we should be delighted to have you join our
  staff."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I believe you have criticized the pharmaceutical houses&mdash;oh, we read
  the newspaper clippings very efficiently!&mdash;but we feel that when you
  come to us and understand the Spirit of the Old Firm better, you'll be
  enthusiastic. I hope, by the way, I'm not interrupting something."</p>

  <p>Thus, over certain hundreds of miles, from the gold and blue drawing-room
  of his Sewickley home, Hunziker spoke to Max Gottlieb sitting in his patched
  easy chair, and Gottlieb grated with a forlorn effort at dignity:</p>

  <p>"No, it iss all right."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;we shall be glad to offer you five thousand dollars a year,
  for a starter, and we shan't worry about the half-time arrangement. We'll
  give you all the space and technicians and material you need, and you just go
  ahead and ignore us, and work out whatever seems important to you. Our only
  request is that if you do find any serums which are of real value to the
  world, we shall have the privilege of manufacturing them, and if we lose
  money on 'em, it doesn't matter. We like to make money, if we can do it
  honestly, but our chief purpose is to serve mankind. Of course if the serums
  pay, we shall be only too delighted to give you a generous commission. Now
  about practical details&mdash;"</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">Gottlieb, the placidly virulent hater of religious rites,
  had a religious-seeming custom.</p>

  <p>Often he knelt by his bed and let his mind run free. It was very much like
  prayer, though certainly there was no formal invocation, no consciousness of
  a Supreme Being&mdash;other than Max Gottlieb. This night, as he knelt, with
  the wrinkles softening in his drawn face, he meditated, "I was asinine that I
  should ever scold the commercialists! This salesman fellow, he has his feet
  on the ground. How much more aut'entic the worst counter-jumper than
  frightened professors! Fine dieners! Freedom! No teaching of imbeciles! Du
  Heiliger!"</p>

  <p>But he had no contract with Dawson Hunziker.</p>

  <p>In the medical periodicals the Dawson Hunziker Company published full-page
  advertisements, most starchy and refined in type, announcing that Professor
  Max Gottlieb, perhaps the most distinguished immunologist in the world, had
  joined their staff.</p>

  <p>In his Chicago clinic, one Dr. Rouncefield chuckled, "That's what becomes
  of these super-highbrows. Pardon me if I seem to grin."</p>

  <p>In the laboratories of Ehrlich and Roux, Bordet and Sir David Bruce,
  sorrowing men wailed, "How could old Max have gone over to that damned
  pill-peddler? Why didn't he come to us? Oh, well, if he didn't want
  to&mdash;Voila! He is dead."</p>

  <p>In the village of Wheatsylvania, in North Dakota, a young doctor protested
  to his wife, "Of all the people in the world! I wouldn't have believed it!
  Max Gottlieb falling for those crooks!"</p>

  <p>"I don't care!" said his wife. "If he's gone into business he had some
  good reason for it. I told you, I'd leave you for&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, well," sighingly, "give and forgive. I learned a lot from Gottlieb
  and I'm grateful for&mdash;God, Leora, I wish <i>he</i> hadn't gone
  wrong!"</p>

  <p>And Max Gottlieb, with his three young and a pale, slow-moving wife, was
  arriving at the station in Pittsburgh, tugging a shabby wicker bag, an
  immigrant bundle, and a Bond Street dressing-case. From the train he had
  stared up at the valiant cliffs, down to the smoke-tinged splendor of the
  river, and his heart was young. Here was fiery enterprise, not the flat land
  and flat minds of Winnemac. At the station-entrance every dingy taxicab
  seemed radiant to him, and he marched forth a conqueror.</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">In the Dawson Hunziker building, Gottlieb found such
  laboratories as he had never planned, and instead of student assistants he
  had an expert who himself had taught bacteriology, as well as three swift
  technicians, one of them German-trained. He was received with acclaim in the
  private office of Hunziker, which was remarkably like a minor cathedral.
  Hunziker was bald and business-like as to skull but tortoise-spectacled and
  sentimental of eye. He stood up at his Jacobean desk, gave Gottlieb a Havana
  cigar, and told him that they had awaited him pantingly.</p>

  <p>In the enormous staff dining-room Gottlieb found scores of competent young
  chemists and biologists who treated him with reverence. He liked them. If
  they talked too much of money&mdash;of how much this new tincture of cinchona
  ought to sell, and how soon their salaries would be increased&mdash;yet they
  were free of the careful pomposities of college instructors. As a youngster,
  the cap-tilted young Max had been a laughing man, and now in gusty arguments
  his laughter came back.</p>

  <p>His wife seemed better; his daughter Miriam found an excellent piano
  teacher; the boy Robert entered college that autumn; they had a spacious
  though decrepit house; the relief from the droning and the annually repeated,
  inevitable routine of the classroom was exhilarating; and Gottlieb had never
  in his life worked so well. He was unconscious of everything outside of his
  laboratory and a few theaters and concert-halls.</p>

  <p>Six months passed before he realized that the young technical experts
  resented what he considered his jolly thrusts at their commercialism. They
  were tired of his mathematical enthusiasms and some of them viewed him as an
  old bore, muttered of him as a Jew. He was hurt, for he liked to be merry
  with fellow workers. He began to ask questions and to explore the Hunziker
  building. He had seen nothing of it save his laboratory, a corridor or two,
  the dining-room, and Hunziker's office.</p>

  <p>However abstracted and impractical, Gottlieb would have made an excellent
  Sherlock Holmes&mdash;if anybody who would have made an excellent Sherlock
  Holmes would have been willing to be a detective. His mind burned through
  appearances to actuality. He discovered now that the Dawson Hunziker Company
  was quite all he had asserted in earlier days. They did make excellent
  antitoxins and ethical preparations, but they were also producing a new
  "cancer remedy" manufactured from the orchid, pontifically recommended and
  possessing all the value of mud. And to various billboard-advertising beauty
  companies they sold millions of bottles of a complexion-cream guaranteed to
  turn a Canadian Indian guide as lily-fair as the angels. This treasure cost
  six cents a bottle to make and a dollar over the counter, and the name of
  Dawson Hunziker was never connected with it.</p>

  <p>It was at this time that Gottlieb succeeded in his masterwork after twenty
  years of seeking. He produced antitoxin in the test-tube, which meant that it
  would be possible to immunize against certain diseases without tediously
  making sera by the inoculation of animals. It was a revolution, the
  revolution, in immunology...if he was right.</p>

  <p>He revealed it at a dinner for which Hunziker had captured a general, a
  college president, and a pioneer aviator. It was an expansive dinner, with
  admirable hock, the first decent German wine Gottlieb had drunk in years. He
  twirled the slender green glass affectionately; he came out of his dreams and
  became excited, gay, demanding. They applauded him, and for an hour he was a
  Great Scientist. Of them all, Hunziker was most generous in his praise.
  Gottlieb wondered if someone had not tricked this good bald man into
  intrigues with the beautifiers.</p>

  <p>Hunziker summoned him to the office next day. Hunziker did his summoning
  very well indeed (unless it happened to be merely a stenographer). He sent a
  glossy morning-coated male secretary, who presented Mr. Hunziker's
  compliments to the much less glossy Dr. Gottlieb, and hinted with the
  delicacy of a lilac bud that if it was quite altogether convenient, if it
  would not in the least interfere with Dr. Gottlieb's experiments, Mr.
  Hunziker would be flattered to see him in the office at a quarter after
  three.</p>

  <p>When Gottlieb rambled in, Hunziker motioned the secretary out of existence
  and drew up a tall Spanish chair.</p>

  <p>"I lay awake half the night thinking about your discovery, Dr. Gottlieb.
  I've been talking to the technical director and sales-manager and we feel
  it's the time to strike. We'll patent your method of synthesizing antibodies
  and immediately put them on the market in large quantities, with a great big
  advertising campaign&mdash;you know&mdash;not circus it, of
  course&mdash;strictly high-class ethical advertising. We'll start with
  anti-diphtheria serum. By the way, when you receive your next check you'll
  find we've raised your honorarium to seven thousand a year." Hunziker was a
  large purring pussy now, and Gottlieb death-still. "Need I say, my dear
  fellow, that if there's the demand I anticipate, you will have exceedingly
  large commissions coming!"</p>

  <p>Hunziker leaned back with a manner of "How's that for glory, my boy?"</p>

  <p>Gottlieb spoke nervously: "I do not approve of patenting serological
  processes. They should be open to all laboratories. And I am strongly against
  premature production or even announcement. I think I am right, but I must
  check my technique, perhaps improve it&mdash;be <i>sure</i>. Then, I should
  think there should be no objection to market production, but in ve-ry small
  quantities and in fair competition with others, not under patents, as if this
  was a dinglebat toy for the Christmas tradings!"</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, I quite sympathize. Personally I should like nothing so
  much as to spend my whole life in just producing one priceless scientific
  discovery, without consideration of mere profit. But we have our duty toward
  the stockholders of the Dawson Hunziker Company to make money for them. Do
  you realize that they have&mdash;and many of them are poor widows and
  orphans&mdash;invested their Little All in our stock, and that we must keep
  faith? I am helpless; I am but their Humble Servant. And on the other side: I
  think we've treated you rather well, Dr. Gottlieb, and we've given you
  complete freedom. And we intend to go on treating you well! Why, man, you'll
  be rich; you'll be one of us! I don't like to make any demands, but on this
  point it's my duty to insist, and I shall expect you at the earliest possible
  moment to start manufacturing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Gottlieb was sixty-two. The defeat at Winnemac had done something to his
  courage...And he had no contract with Hunziker.</p>

  <p>He protested shakily, but as he crawled back to his laboratory it seemed
  impossible for him to leave this sanctuary and face the murderous brawling
  world, and quite as impossible to tolerate a cheapened and ineffective
  imitation of his antitoxin. He began, that hour, a sordid strategy which his
  old proud self would have called inconceivable; he began to equivocate, to
  put off announcement and production till he should have "cleared up a few
  points," while week on week Hunziker became more threatening. Meantime he
  prepared for disaster. He moved his family to a smaller house, and gave up
  every luxury, even smoking.</p>

  <p>Among his economies was the reduction of his son's allowance.</p>

  <p>Robert was a square-rigged, swart, tempestuous boy, arrogant where there
  seemed to be no reason for arrogance, longed for by the anemic, milky sort of
  girls, yet ever supercilious to them. While his father was alternately proud
  and amiably sardonic about his own Jewish blood, the boy conveyed to his
  classmates in college that he was from pure and probably noble German stock.
  He was welcomed, or half welcomed, in a motoring, poker-playing, country-club
  set, and he had to have more money. Gottlieb missed twenty dollars from his
  desk. He who ridiculed conventional honor had the honor, as he had the pride,
  of a savage old squire. A new misery stained his incessant bitterness at
  having to deceive Hunziker. He faced Robert with, "My boy, did you take the
  money from my desk?"</p>

  <p>Few youngsters could have faced that jut of his hawk nose, the red-veined
  rage of his sunken eyes. Robert spluttered, then shouted:</p>

  <p>"Yes, I did! And I've got to have some more! I've got to get some clothes
  and stuff. It's your fault. You bring me up to train with a lot of fellows
  that have all the cash in the world, and then you expect me to dress like a
  hobo!"</p>

  <p>"Stealing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Rats! What's stealing! You're always making fun of these preachers that
  talk about Sin and Truth and Honesty and all those words that've been used so
  much they don't mean a darn' thing and&mdash;I don't care! Daws Hunziker, the
  old man's son, he told me his dad said you could be a millionaire, and then
  you keep us strapped like this, and Mom sick&mdash;Let me tell you, back in
  Mohalis Mom used to slip me a couple of dollars almost every week
  and&mdash;I'm tired of it! If you're going to keep me in rags, I'm going to
  cut out college!"</p>

  <p>Gottlieb stormed, but there was no force in it. He did not know, all the
  next fortnight, what his son was going to do, what himself was going to
  do.</p>

  <p>Then, so quietly that not till they had returned from the cemetery did
  they realize her passing, his wife died, and the next week his oldest
  daughter ran off with a worthless laughing fellow who lived by gambling.</p>

  <p>Gottlieb sat alone. Over and over he read the Book of Job. "Truly the Lord
  hath smitten me and my house," he whispered. When Robert came in, mumbling
  that he would be good, the old man lifted to him a blind face, unhearing. But
  as he repeated the fables of his fathers it did not occur to him to believe
  them, or to stoop in fear before their God of Wrath&mdash;or to gain ease by
  permitting Hunziker to defile his discovery.</p>

  <p>He arose, in time, and went silently to his laboratory. His experiments
  were as careful as ever, and his assistants saw no change save that he did
  not lunch in hall. He walked blocks away, to a vile restaurant at which he
  could save thirty cents a day.</p><br>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">Out of the dimness which obscured the people about him,
  Miriam emerged.</p>

  <p>She was eighteen, the youngest of his brood, squat, and in no way comely
  save for her tender mouth. She had always been proud of her father,
  understanding the mysterious and unreasoning compulsions of his science, but
  she had been in awe till now, when he walked heavily and spoke rarely. She
  dropped her piano lessons, discharged the maid, studied the cook-book, and
  prepared for him the fat crisp dishes that he loved. Her regret was that she
  had never learned German, for he dropped now and then into the speech of his
  boyhood.</p>

  <p>He eyed her, and at length: "So! One is with me. Could you endure the
  poverty if I went away&mdash;to teach chemistry in a high school!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Of course. Maybe I could play the piano in a movie theater."</p>

  <p>He might not have done it without her loyalty, but when Dawson Hunziker
  next paraded into the laboratory, demanding, "Now look here. We've fussed
  long enough. We got to put your stuff on the market," then Gottlieb answered,
  "No. If you wait till I have done all I can&mdash;maybe one year, probably
  three&mdash;you shall have it. But not till I am sure. No."</p>

  <p>Hunziker went off huffily, and Gottlieb prepared for sentence.</p>

  <p>Then the card of Dr. A. DeWitt Tubbs, Director of the McGurk Institute of
  Biology, of New York, was brought to him.</p>

  <p>Gottlieb knew of Tubbs. He had never visited McGurk but he considered it,
  next to Rockefeller and McCormick, the soundest and freest organization for
  pure scientific research in the country, and if he had pictured a Heavenly
  laboratory in which good scientists might spend eternity in happy and
  thoroughly impractical research, he would have devised it in the likeness of
  McGurk. He was mildly pleased that its director should have called on
  him.</p>

  <p>Dr. A. DeWitt Tubbs was tremendously whiskered on all visible spots save
  his nose and temples and the palms of his hands, short but passionately
  whiskered, like a Scotch terrier. Yet they were not comic whiskers; they were
  the whiskers of dignity; and his eyes were serious, his step an earnest trot,
  his voice a piping solemnity.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Gottlieb, this is a great pleasure. I have heard your papers at the
  Academy of Sciences but, to my own loss, I have hitherto failed to have an
  introduction to you."</p>

  <p>Gottlieb tried not to sound embarrassed.</p>

  <p>Tubbs looked at the assistants; like a plotter in a political play, and
  hinted, "May we have a talk&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Gottlieb led him to his office, overlooking a vast bustle of side-tracks,
  of curving rails and brown freight-cars, and Tubbs urged:</p>

  <p>"It has come to our attention, by a curious chance, that you are on the
  eve of your most significant discovery. We all wondered, when you left
  academic work, at your decision to enter the commercial field. We wished that
  you had cared to come to us."</p>

  <p>"You would have taken me in? I needn't at all have come here?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally! Now from what we hear, you are not giving your attention to
  the commercial side of things, and that tempts us to wonder whether you could
  be persuaded to join us at McGurk. So I just sprang on a train and ran down
  here. We should be delighted to have you become a member of the institute,
  and chief of the Department of Bacteriology and Immunology. Mr. McGurk and I
  desire nothing but the advancement of science. You would, of course, have
  absolute freedom as to what researches you thought it best to pursue, and I
  think we could provide as good assistance and material as would be obtainable
  anywhere in the world. In regard to salary&mdash;permit me to be
  business-like and perhaps blunt, as my train leaves in one hour&mdash;I don't
  suppose we could equal the doubtless large emolument which the Hunziker
  people are able to pay you, but we can go to ten thousand dollars a
  year&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God, do not talk of the money! I shall be wit' you in New York one
  week from today. You see," said Gottlieb, "I haf no contract here!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">All afternoon they drove in the flapping buggy across the
  long undulations of the prairie. To their wandering there was no barrier,
  neither lake nor mountain nor factory-bristling city, and the breeze about
  them was flowing sunshine.</p>

  <p>Martin cried to Leora, "I feel as if all the Zenith dust and hospital lint
  were washed out of my lungs. Dakota. Real man's country. Frontier.
  Opportunity. America!"</p>

  <p>From the thick swale the young prairie chickens rose. As he watched them
  sweep across the wheat, his sun-drowsed spirit was part of the great land,
  and he was almost freed of the impatience with which he had started out from
  Wheatsylvania.</p>

  <p>"If you're going driving, don't forget that supper is six o'clock sharp,"
  Mrs. Tozer had said, smiling to sugar-coat it.</p>

  <p>On Main Street, Mr. Tozer waved to them and shouted, "Be back by six.
  Supper at six o'clock sharp."</p>

  <p>Bert Tozer ran out from the bank, like a country schoolmaster skipping
  from a one-room schoolhouse, and cackled, "Say, you folks better not forget
  to be back at six o'clock for supper or the Old Man'll have a fit. He'll
  expect you for supper at six o'clock sharp, and when he says six o'clock
  <i>sharp</i>, he means six o'clock <i>sharp</i>, and not five minutes past
  six!"</p>

  <p>"Now that," observed Leora, "is funny, because in my twenty-two years in
  Wheatsylvania I remember three different times when supper was as late as
  seven minutes after six. Let's get out of this, Sandy...I wonder were we so
  wise to live with the family and save money?"</p>

  <p>Before they had escaped from the not very extensive limits of
  Wheatsylvania they passed Ada Quist, the future Mrs. Bert Tozer, and through
  the lazy air they heard her voice slashing: "Better be home by six."</p>

  <p>Martin would be heroic. "We'll by golly get back when we're by golly good
  and ready!" he said to Leora; but on them both was the cumulative dread of
  the fussing voices, beyond every breezy prospect was the order, "Be back at
  six sharp"; and they whipped up to arrive at eleven minutes to six, as Mr.
  Tozer was returning from the creamery, full thirty seconds later than
  usual.</p>

  <p>"Glad to see you among us," he said. "Hustle now and get that horse in the
  livery stable. Supper's at six&mdash;sharp!"</p>

  <p>Martin survived it sufficiently to sound domestic when he announced at the
  supper-table:</p>

  <p>"We had a bully drive. I'm going to like it here. Well, I've loafed for a
  day and a half, and now I've got to get busy. First thing is, I must find a
  location for my office. What is there vacant, Father Tozer?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Tozer said brightly, "Oh, I have such a nice idea, Martin. Why can't
  we fix up an office for you out in the barn? It'd be so handy to the house,
  for you to get to meals on time, and you could keep an eye on the house if
  the girl was out and Ory and I went out visiting or to the Embroidery
  Circle."</p>

  <p>"In the barn!"</p>

  <p>"Why, yes, in the old harness room. It's partly ceiled, and we could put
  in some nice tar paper or even beaver board."</p>

  <p>"Mother Tozer, what the dickens do you think I'm planning to do? I'm not a
  hired man in a livery stable, or a kid looking for a place to put his birds'
  eggs! I was thinking of opening an office as a physician!"</p>

  <p>Bert made it all easy: "Yuh, but you aren't much of a physician yet.
  You're just getting your toes in."</p>

  <p>"I'm one hell of a good physician! Excuse me for cussing, Mother Tozer,
  but&mdash;Why, nights in the hospital, I've held hundreds of lives in my
  hand! I intend&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Look here, Mart," said Bertie. "As we're putting up the money&mdash;I
  don't want to be a tightwad but after all, a dollar is a dollar&mdash;if we
  furnish the dough, we've got to decide the best way to spend it."</p>

  <p>Mr. Tozer looked thoughtful and said helplessly, "That's so. No sense
  taking a risk, with the blame farmers demanding all the money they can get
  for their wheat and cream, and then deliberately going to work and not paying
  the interest on their loans. I swear, it don't hardly pay to invest in
  mortgages any longer. No sense putting on lugs. Stands to reason you can look
  at a fellow's sore throat or prescribe for an ear-ache just as well in a nice
  simple little office as in some fool place all fixed up like a Moorhead
  saloon. Mother will see you have a comfortable corner in the barn&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Leora intruded: "Look here, Papa. I want you to lend us one thousand
  dollars, outright, to use as we see fit." The sensation was immense. "We'll
  pay you six per cent&mdash;no, we won't; we'll pay you five; that's
  enough."</p>

  <p>"And mortgages bringing six, seven, and eight!" Bert quavered.</p>

  <p>"Five's enough. And we want our own say, absolute, as to how we use
  it&mdash;to fit up an office or anything else."</p>

  <p>Mr. Tozer began, "That's a foolish way to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bert took it away from him: "Ory, you're crazy! I suppose we'll have to
  lend you some money, but you'll blame well come to us for it from time to
  time, and you'll blame well take our advice&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Leora rose. "Either you do what I say, just exactly what I say, or Mart
  and I take the first train and go back to Zenith, and I mean it! Plenty of
  places open for him there, with a big salary, so we won't have to be
  dependent on anybody!"</p>

  <p>There was much conversation, most of which sounded like all the rest of
  it. Once Leora started for the stairs, to go up and pack; once Martin and she
  stood waving their napkins as they shook their fists, the general composition
  remarkably like the Laocoon.</p>

  <p>Leora won.</p>

  <p>They settled down to the most solacing fussing.</p>

  <p>"Did you bring your trunk up from the depot?" asked Mr. Tozer.</p>

  <p>"No sense leaving it there&mdash;paying two bits a day storage!" fumed
  Bert.</p>

  <p>"I got it up this morning," said Martin.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, Martin had it brought up this morning," agreed Mrs. Tozer.</p>

  <p>"You had it brought? Didn't you bring it up yourself?" agonized Mr.
  Tozer.</p>

  <p>"No. I had the fellow that runs the lumberyard haul it up for me," said
  Martin.</p>

  <p>"Well, gosh almighty, you could just as well've put it on a wheelbarrow
  and brought it up yourself and saved a quarter!" said Bert.</p>

  <p>"But a doctor has to keep his dignity," said Leora.</p>

  <p>"Dignity, rats! Blame sight more dignified to be seen shoving a
  wheelbarrow than smoking them dirty cigarettes all the time!"</p>

  <p>"Well, anyway&mdash;Where'd you put it?" asked Mr. Tozer.</p>

  <p>"It's up in our room," said Martin.</p>

  <p>"Where'd you think we better put it when it's unpacked? The attic is
  awful' full," Mr. Tozer submitted to Mrs. Tozer.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I think Martin could get it in there."</p>

  <p>"Why couldn't he put it in the barn?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, not a nice new trunk like that!"</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with the barn?" said Bert. "It's all nice and dry.
  Seems a shame to waste all that good space in the barn, now that you've gone
  and decided he mustn't have his dear little office there!"</p>

  <p>"Bertie," from Leora, "I know what we'll do. You seem to have the barn on
  your brain. You move your old bank there, and Martin'll take the bank
  building for his office."</p>

  <p>"That's entirely different&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Now there's no sense you two showing off and trying to be smart,"
  protested Mr. Tozer. "Do you ever hear your mother and I scrapping and
  fussing like that? When do you think you'll have your trunk unpacked, Mart?"
  Mr. Tozer could consider barns and he could consider trunks but his was not a
  brain to grasp two such complicated matters at the same time.</p>

  <p>"I can get it unpacked tonight, if it makes any difference&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't suppose it really makes any special difference, but when
  you start to <i>do</i> a thing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, what difference does it make whether he&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If he's going to look for an office, instead of moving right into the
  barn, he can't take a month of Sundays getting unpacked and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, good Lord, I'll get it done tonight&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And I think we can get it in the attic&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I tell you it's jam full already&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We'll go take a look at it after supper&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well now, I tell you when I tried to get that duck-boat in&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Martin probably did not scream, but he heard himself screaming. The free
  and virile land was leagues away and for years forgotten.</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">To find an office took a fortnight of diplomacy, and of
  discussion brightening three meals a day, every day. (Not that office-finding
  was the only thing the Tozers mentioned. They went thoroughly into every
  moment of Martin's day; they commented on his digestion, his mail, his walks,
  his shoes that needed cobbling, and whether he had yet taken them to the
  farmer-trapper-cobbler, and how much the cobbling ought to cost, and the
  presumable theology, politics, and marital relations of the cobbler.)</p>

  <p>Mr. Tozer had from the first known the perfect office. The Norbloms lived
  above their general store, and Mr. Tozer knew that the Norbloms were thinking
  of moving. There was indeed nothing that was happening or likely to happen in
  Wheatsylvania which Mr. Tozer did not know and explain. Mrs. Norblom was
  tired of keeping house, and she wanted to go to Mrs. Beeson's boarding house
  (to the front room, on the right as you went along the up-stairs hall, the
  room with the plaster walls and the nice little stove that Mrs. Beeson bought
  from Otto Krag for seven dollars and thirty-five cents&mdash;no, seven and a
  quarter it was).</p>

  <p>They called on the Norbloms and Mr. Tozer hinted that "it might be nice
  for the Doctor to locate over the store, if the Norbloms were thinking of
  making any change&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Norbloms stared at each other, with long, bleached, cautious,
  Scandinavian stares, and grumbled that they "didn't <i>know</i>&mdash;of
  course it was the finest location in town&mdash;" Mr. Norblom admitted that
  if, against all probability, they ever considered moving, they would probably
  ask twenty-five dollars a month for the flat, unfurnished.</p>

  <p>Mr. Tozer came out of the international conference as craftily joyful as
  any Mr. Secretary Tozer or Lord Tozer in Washington or London:</p>

  <p>"Fine! Fine! We made him commit himself! Twenty-five, he says. That means,
  when the time's ripe, we'll offer him eighteen and close for
  twenty-one-seventy-five. If we just handle him careful, and give him time to
  go see Mrs. Beeson and fix up about boarding with her, we'll have him just
  where we want him!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, if the Norbloms can't make up their minds, then let's try something
  else," said Martin. "There's a couple of vacant rooms behind the Eagle
  office."</p>

  <p>"What? Go chasing around, after we've given the Norbloms reason to think
  we're serious, and make enemies of 'em for life? Now that would be a fine way
  to start building up a practice, wouldn't it? And I must say I wouldn't blame
  the Norbloms one bit for getting wild if you let 'em down like that. This
  ain't Zenith, where you can go yelling around expecting to get things done in
  two minutes!"</p>

  <p>Through a fortnight, while the Norbloms agonized over deciding to do what
  they had long ago decided to do, Martin waited, unable to begin work. Until
  he should open a certified and recognizable office, most of the village did
  not regard him as a competent physician but as "that son-in-law of Andy
  Tozer's." In the fortnight he was called only once: for the sick-headache of
  Miss Agnes Ingleblad, aunt and housekeeper of Alec Ingleblad the barber. He
  was delighted, till Bert Tozer explained:</p>

  <p>"Oh, so <i>she</i> called you in, eh? She's always doctorin' around. There
  ain't a thing the matter with her, but she's always trying out the latest
  stunt. Last time it was a fellow that come through here selling pills and
  liniments out of a Ford, and the time before that it was a faith-healer,
  crazy loon up here at Dutchman's Forge, and then for quite a spell she
  doctored with an osteopath in Leopolis&mdash;though I tell you there's
  something to this osteopathy&mdash;they cure a lot of folks that you regular
  docs can't seem to find out what's the matter with 'em, don't you think
  so?"</p>

  <p>Martin remarked that he did not think so.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you docs!" Bert crowed in his most jocund manner, for Bert could be
  very joky and bright. "You're all alike, especially when you're just out of
  school and think you know it all. You can't see any good in chiropractic or
  electric belts or bone-setters or anything, because they take so many good
  dollars away from you."</p>

  <p>Then behold the Dr. Martin Arrowsmith who had once infuriated Angus Duer
  and Irving Watters by his sarcasm on medical standards upholding to a lewdly
  grinning Bert Tozer the benevolence and scientific knowledge of all doctors;
  proclaiming that no medicine had ever (at least by any Winnemac graduate)
  been prescribed in vain nor any operation needlessly performed.</p>

  <p>He saw a good deal of Bert now. He sat about the bank, hoping to be called
  on a case, his fingers itching for bandages. Ada Quist came in with frequency
  and Bert laid aside his figuring to be coy with her:</p>

  <p>"You got to be careful what you even think about, when the doc is here,
  Ade. He's been telling me what a whale of a lot of neurology and all that
  mind-reading stuff he knows. How about it, Mart? I'm getting so scared that
  I've changed the combination on the safe."</p>

  <p>"Heh!" said Ada. "He may fool some folks but he can't fool me. Anybody can
  learn things in books, but when it comes to practicing 'em&mdash;Let me tell
  you, Mart, if you ever have one-tenth of the savvy that old Dr. Winter of
  Leopolis has, you'll live longer than I expect!"</p>

  <p>Together they pointed out that for a person who felt his Zenith training
  had made him so "gosh-awful smart that he sticks up his nose at us poor hicks
  of dirt-farmers," Martin's scarf was rather badly tied.</p>

  <p>All of his own wit and some of Ada's Bert repeated at the supper
  table.</p>

  <p>"You oughtn't to ride the boy so hard. Still, that was pretty cute about
  the necktie&mdash;I guess Mart does think he's some punkins," chuckled Mr.
  Tozer.</p>

  <p>Leora took Martin aside after supper. "Darlin', can you stand it? We'll
  have our own house, soon as we can. Or shall we vamoose?"</p>

  <p>"I'm by golly going to stand it!"</p>

  <p>"Um. Maybe. Dear, when you hit Bertie, do be careful&mdash;they'll hang
  you."</p>

  <p>He ambled to the front porch. He determined to view the rooms behind the
  Eagle office. Without a retreat in which to be safe from Bert he could not
  endure another week. He could not wait for the Norbloms to make up their
  minds, though they had become to him dread and eternal figures whose enmity
  would crush him; prodigious gods shadowing this Wheatsylvania which was the
  only perceptible world.</p>

  <p>He was aware, in the late sad light, that a man was tramping the plank
  walk before the house, hesitating and peering at him. The man was one Wise, a
  Russian Jew known to the village as "Wise the Polack." In his shack near the
  railroad he sold silver stock and motor-factory stock, bought and sold
  farmlands and horses and muskrat hides. He called out, "That you, Doc?"</p>

  <p>"Yup!"</p>

  <p>Martin was excited. A patient!</p>

  <p>"Say, I wish you'd walk down a ways with me. Couple things I'd like to
  talk to you about. Or say, come on over to my place and sample some new
  cigars I've got." He emphasized the word "cigars." North Dakota was, like
  Mohalis, theoretically dry.</p>

  <p>Martin was pleased. He had been sober and industrious so long now!</p>

  <p>Wise's shack was a one-story structure, not badly built, half a block from
  Main Street, with nothing but the railroad track between it and open wheat
  country. It was lined with pine, pleasant-smelling under the stench of old
  pipe-smoke. Wise winked&mdash;he was a confidential, untrustworthy wisp of a
  man&mdash;and murmured, "Think you could stand a little jolt of first-class
  Kentucky bourbon?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I wouldn't get violent about it."</p>

  <p>Wise pulled down the sleazy window-shades and from a warped drawer of his
  desk brought up a bottle out of which they both drank, wiping the mouth of
  the bottle with circling palms. Then Wise, abruptly:</p>

  <p>"Look here, Doc. You're not like these hicks; you understand that
  sometimes a fellow gets mixed up in crooked business he didn't intend to.
  Well, make a long story short, I guess I've sold too much mining stock, and
  they'll be coming down on me. I've got to be moving&mdash;curse
  it&mdash;hoped I could stay settled for couple of years, this time. Well, I
  hear you're looking for an office. This place would be ideal. Ideal! Two
  rooms at the back besides this one. I'll rent it to you, furniture and the
  whole shooting-match, for fifteen dollars a month, if you'll pay me one year
  in advance. Oh, this ain't phony. Your brother-in-law knows all about my
  ownership."</p>

  <p>Martin tried to be very business-like. Was he not a young doctor who would
  soon be investing money, one of the most Substantial Citizens in
  Wheatsylvania? He returned home, and under the parlor lamp, with its green
  daisies on pink glass, the Tozers listened acutely, Bert stooping forward
  with open mouth.</p>

  <p>"You'd be safe renting it for a year, but that ain't the point," said
  Bert.</p>

  <p>"It certainly isn't! Antagonize the Norbloms, now that they've almost made
  up their minds to let you have their place? Make me a fool, after all the
  trouble I've taken?" groaned Mr. Tozer.</p>

  <p>They went over it and over it till almost ten o'clock, but Martin was
  resolute, and the next day he rented Wise's shack.</p>

  <p>For the first time in his life he had a place utterly his own, his and
  Leora's.</p>

  <p>In his pride of possession this was the most lordly building on earth, and
  every rock and weed and doorknob was peculiar and lovely. At sunset he sat on
  the back stoop (a very interesting and not too broken soap-box) and from the
  flamboyant horizon the open country flowed across the thin band of the
  railroad to his feet. Suddenly Leora was beside him, her arm round his neck,
  and he hymned all the glory of their future:</p>

  <p>"Know what I found in the kitchen here? A dandy old auger, hardly rusty a
  bit, and I can take a box and make a test-tube rack...of my own!"</p>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">With none of the profane observations on "medical peddlers"
  which had annoyed Digamma Pi, Martin studied the catalogue of the New Idea
  Instrument and Furniture Company, of Jersey City. It was a handsome thing. On
  the glossy green cover, in red and black, were the portraits of the
  president, a round quippish man who loved all young physicians; the general
  manager, a cadaverous scholarly man who surely gave all his laborious nights
  and days to the advancement of science; and the vice-president, Martin's
  former preceptor, Dr. Roscoe Geake, who had a lively, eye-glassed,
  forward-looking modernity all his own. The cover also contained in
  surprisingly small space, a quantity of poetic prose, and the inspiring
  promise:</p><br>

  <p class="quote">Doctor, don't be buffaloed by the unenterprising. No reason
  why <i>you</i> should lack the equipment which impresses patients, makes
  practice easy, and brings honor and riches. All the high-class supplies which
  distinguish the Leaders of the Profession from the Dubs are within
  <i>your</i> reach right <i>now</i> by the famous New Idea Financial System:
  "Just a little down and the rest <i>free</i>&mdash;out of the increased
  earnings which New Idea apparatus will bring you!"</p><br>

  <p>Above, in a border of laurel wreaths and Ionic capitals, was the
  challenge:</p><br>

  <p class="quote">Sing not the glory of soldiers or explorers or statesmen for
  who can touch the doctor&mdash;wise, heroic, uncontaminated by common greed.
  Gentlemen, we salute you humbly and herewith offer you the most
  up-to-the-jiffy catalogue ever presented by any surgical supply
  house.</p><br>

  <p>The back cover, though it was less glorious with green and red, was
  equally arousing. It presented illustrations of the Bindledorf Tonsillectomy
  Outfit and of an electric cabinet, with the demand:</p><br>

  <p class="quote">Doctor, are you sending your patients off to specialists for
  tonsil removal or to sanitoriums for electric, etc., treatment? If, so, you
  are losing the chance to show yourself one of the distinguished powers in the
  domain of medical advancement in your locality, and losing a lot of big fees.
  Don't you <i>want</i> to be a high-class practitioner? Here's the Open
  Door.</p>

  <p class="quote">The Bindledorf Outfit is not only useful but exquisitely
  beautiful, adorns and gives class to any office. We guarantee that by the
  installation of a Bindledorf Outfit and a New Idea Panaceatic
  Electro-Therapeutic Cabinet (see details on pp. 34 and 97) you can increase
  your income from a thousand to ten thousand annually and please patients more
  than by the most painstaking plugging.</p>

  <p class="quote">When the Great Call sounds, Doctor, and it's time for you to
  face your reward, will you be satisfied by a big Masonic funeral and tributes
  from Grateful Patients if you have failed to lay up provision for the
  kiddies, and faithful wife who has shared your tribulations?&gt;</p>

  <p class="quote">You may drive through blizzard and August heat, and go down
  into the purple-shadowed vale of sorrow and wrestle with the ebon-cloaked
  Powers of Darkness for the lives of your patients, but that heroism is
  incomplete without Modern Progress, to be obtained by the use of a Bindledorf
  Tonsillectomy Outfit and the New Idea Panaceatic Cabinet, to be obtained on
  small payment down, rest on easiest terms known in history of
  medicine!</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">This poetry of passion Martin neglected, for his opinion of
  poetry was like his opinion of electric cabinets, but excitedly he ordered a
  steel stand, a sterilizer, flasks, test-tubes, and a white-enameled mechanism
  with enchanting levers and gears which transformed it from examining-chair to
  operating-table. He yearned over the picture of a centrifuge while Leora was
  admiring the "stunning seven-piece Reception Room fumed oak set, upholstered
  in genuine Barcelona Longware Leatherette, will give your office the class
  and distinction of any high-grade New York specialist's."</p>

  <p>"Aw, let 'em sit on plain chairs," Martin grunted.</p>

  <p>In the attic Mrs. Tozer found enough seedy chairs for the reception-room,
  and an ancient bookcase which, when Leora had lined it with pink fringed
  paper, became a noble instrument-cabinet. Till the examining-chair should
  arrive, Martin would use Wise's lumpy couch, and Leora busily covered it with
  white oilcloth. Behind the front room of the tiny office-building were two
  cubicles, formerly bedroom and kitchen. Martin made them into
  consultation-room and laboratory. Whistling, he sawed out racks for the
  glassware and turned the oven of a discarded kerosene stove into a hot-air
  oven for sterilizing glassware.</p>

  <p>"But understand, Lee, I'm not going to go monkeying with any scientific
  research. I'm through with all that."</p>

  <p>Leora smiled innocently. While he worked she sat outside in the long wild
  grass, sniffing the prairie breeze, her hands about her ankles, but every
  quarter-hour she had to come in and admire.</p>

  <p>Mr. Tozer brought home a package at suppertime. The family opened it,
  babbling. After supper Martin and Leora hastened with the new treasure to the
  office and nailed it in place. It was a plate-glass sign; on it in gold
  letters, "M. Arrowsinith, M.D." They looked up, arms about each other,
  squealing softly, and in reverence he grunted,
  "There&mdash;by&mdash;jiminy!"</p>

  <p>They sat on the back stoop, exulting in freedom from Tozers. Along the
  railroad bumped a freight train with a cheerful clanking. The fireman waved
  to them from the engine, a brakeman from the platform of the red caboose.
  After the train there was silence but for the crickets and a distant
  frog.</p>

  <p>"I've never been so happy," he murmured.</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">He had brought from Zenith his own Ochsner surgical case. As
  he laid out the instruments he admired the thin, sharp, shining bistoury, the
  strong tenotome, the delicate curved needles. With them was a dental forceps.
  Dad Silva had warned his classes, "Don't forget the country doctor often has
  to be not only physician but dentist, yes, and priest, divorce lawyer,
  blacksmith, chauffeur, and road engineer, and if you are too lily-handed for
  those trades, don't get out of sight of a trolley line and a beauty parlor."
  And the first patient whom Martin had in the new office, the second patient
  in Wheatsylvania, was Nils Krag, the carpenter, roaring with an ulcerated
  tooth. This was a week before the glass sign was up, and Martin rejoiced to
  Leora, "Begun already! You'll see 'em tumbling in now."</p>

  <p>They did not see them tumbling in. For ten days Martin tinkered at his
  hot-air oven or sat at his desk, reading and trying to look busy. His first
  joy passed into fretfulness, and he could have yelped at the stillness, the
  inactivity.</p>

  <p>Late one afternoon, when he was in a melancholy way preparing to go home,
  into the office stamped a grizzled Swedish farmer who grumbled, "Doc, I got a
  fish-hook caught in my thumb and its all swole." To Arrowsmith, intern in
  Zenith General Hospital with its out-patient clinic treating hundreds a day,
  the dressing of a hand had been less important than borrowing a match, but to
  Dr. Arrowsmith of Wheatsylvania it was a hectic operation, and the farmer a
  person remarkable and very charming. Martin shook his left hand violently and
  burbled, "Now if there's anything, you just 'phone me&mdash;you just 'phone
  me."</p>

  <p>There had been, he felt, a rush of admiring patients sufficient to justify
  them in the one thing Leora and he longed to do, the thing about which they
  whispered at night: the purchase of a motor car for his country calls.</p>

  <p>They had seen the car at Frazier's store.</p>

  <p>It was a Ford, five years old, with torn upholstery, a gummy motor, and
  springs made by a blacksmith who had never made springs before. Next to the
  chugging of the gas engine at the creamery, the most familiar sound in
  Wheatsylvania was Frazier's closing the door of his Ford. He banged it flatly
  at the store, and usually he had to shut it thrice again before he reached
  home.</p>

  <p>But to Martin and Leora, when they had tremblingly bought the car and
  three new tires and a horn, it was the most impressive vehicle on earth. It
  was their own; they could go when and where they wished.</p>

  <p>During his summer at a Canadian hotel Martin had learned to drive the Ford
  station wagon, but it was Leora's first venture. Bert had given her so many
  directions that she had refused to drive the family Overland. When she first
  sat at the steering wheel, when she moved the hand-throttle with her little
  finger and felt in her own hands all this power, sorcery enabling her to go
  as fast as she might desire (within distinct limits), she transcended human
  strength, she felt that she could fly like the wild goose&mdash;and then in a
  stretch of sand she killed the engine.</p>

  <p>Martin became the demon driver of the village. To ride with him was to sit
  holding your hat, your eyes closed, waiting for death. Apparently he
  accelerated for corners, to make them more interesting. The sight of anything
  on the road ahead, from another motor to a yellow pup, stirred in him a
  frenzy which could be stilled only by going up and passing it. The village
  adored, "The Young Doc is quite some driver, all right." They waited, with
  amiable interest, to hear that he had been killed. It is possible that half
  of the first dozen patients who drifted into his office came because of awe
  at his driving...the rest because there was nothing serious the matter, and
  he was nearer than Dr. Hesselink at Groningen.</p><br>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">With his first admirers he developed his first enemies.</p>

  <p>When he met the Norbloms on the street (and in Wheatsylvania it is
  difficult not to meet everyone on the street every day), they glared. Then he
  antagonized Pete Yeska.</p>

  <p>Pete conducted what he called a "drug store," devoted to the sale of
  candy, soda water, patent medicines, fly paper, magazines, washing-machines,
  and Ford accessories, yet Pete would have starved if he had not been
  postmaster also. He alleged that he was a licensed pharmacist but he so
  mangled prescriptions that Martin burst into the store and addressed him
  piously.</p>

  <p>"You young docs make me sick," said Pete. "I was putting up prescriptions
  when you was in the cradle. The old doc that used to be here sent everything
  to me. My way o' doing things suits me, and I don't figure on changing it for
  you or any other half-baked young string-bean."</p>

  <p>Thereafter Martin had to purchase drugs from St. Paul, over-crowd his tiny
  laboratory, and prepare his own pills and ointments, looking in a homesick
  way at the rarely used test-tubes and the dust gathering on the bell glass of
  his microscope, while Pete Yeska joined with the Norbloms in Whispering,
  "This new doc here ain't any good. You better stick to Hesselink."</p><br>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="first">So blank, so idle, had been the week that when he heard the
  telephone at the Tozers', at three in the morning, he rushed to it as though
  he were awaiting a love message.</p>

  <p>A hoarse and shaky voice: "I want to speak to the doctor."</p>

  <p>"Yuh&mdash;yuh&mdash;'S the doctor speaking."</p>

  <p>"This is Henry Novak, four miles northeast, on the Leopolis road. My
  little girl, Mary, she has a terrible sore throat. I think maybe it is croup
  and she look awful and&mdash;Could you come right away?"</p>

  <p>"You bet. Be right there."</p>

  <p>Four miles&mdash;he would do it in eight minutes.</p>

  <p>He dressed swiftly, dragging his worn brown tie together, while Leora
  beamed over the first night call. He furiously cranked the Ford, banged and
  clattered past the station and into the wheat prairie. When he had gone six
  miles by the speedometer, slackening at each rural box to look for the
  owner's name, he realized that he was lost. He ran into a farm driveway and
  stopped under the willows, his headlight on a heap of dented milk-cans,
  broken harvester wheels, cord-wood, and bamboo fishing-poles. From the barn
  dashed a woolly anomalous dog, barking viciously, leaping up at the car.</p>

  <p>A frowsy head protruded from a ground-floor window. "What you want?"
  screamed a Scandinavian voice.</p>

  <p>"This is The Doctor. Where does Henry Novak live?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! The Doctor! Dr. Hesselink?"</p>

  <p>"No! Dr. Arrowsmith."</p>

  <p>"Oh. Dr. Arrowsmith. From Wheatsylvania? Um. Well, you went right near his
  place. You yoost turn back one mile and turn to the right by the brick
  schoolhouse, and it's about forty rods up the road&mdash;the house with a
  cement silo. Somebody sick by Henry's?"</p>

  <p>"Yuh&mdash;yuh&mdash;girl's got croup&mdash;thanks&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yoost keep to the right. You can't miss it." Probably no one who has
  listened to the dire "you can't miss it" has ever failed to miss it.</p>

  <p>Martin swung the Ford about, grazing a slashed chopping block; he rattled
  up the road, took the corner that side of the schoolhouse instead of this,
  ran half a mile along a boggy trail between pastures, and stopped at a
  farmhouse. In the surprising fall of silence, cows were to be heard feeding,
  and a white horse, startled in the darkness, raised its head to wonder at
  him. He had to arouse the house with wild squawkings of his horn, and an
  irate farmer who bellowed, "Who's there? I've got a shotgun!" sent him back
  to the country road.</p>

  <p>It was forty minutes from the time of the telephone call when he rushed
  into a furrowed driveway and saw on the doorstep, against the lamplight, a
  stooped man who called, "The Doctor? This is Novak."</p>

  <p>He found the child in a newly finished bedroom of white plastered walls
  and pale varnished pine. Only an iron bed, a straight chair, a chromo of St.
  Anne, and a shadeless hand-lamp on a rickety stand broke the staring
  shininess of the apartment, a recent extension of the farmhouse. A
  heavy-shouldered woman was kneeling by the bed. As she lifted her wet red
  face, Novak urged:</p>

  <p>"Don't cry now; he's here!" And to Martin: "The little one is pretty bad
  but we done all we could for her. Last night and tonight we steam her throat,
  and we put her here in our own bedroom!"</p>

  <p>Mary was a child of seven or eight. Martin found her lips and finger-tips
  blue, but in her face no flush. In the effort to expel her breath she writhed
  into terrifying knots, then coughed up saliva dotted with grayish specks.
  Martin worried as he took out his clinical thermometer and gave it a
  professional-looking shake.</p>

  <p>It was, he decided, laryngeal croup or diphtheria. Probably diphtheria. No
  time now for bacteriological examination, for cultures and leisurely
  precision. Silva the healer bulked in the room, crowding out Gottlieb the
  inhuman perfectionist. Martin leaned nervously over the child on the tousled
  bed, absentmindedly trying her pulse again and again. He felt helpless
  without the equipment of Zenith General, its nurses and Angus Duers sure
  advice. He had a sudden respect for the lone country doctor.</p>

  <p>He had to make a decision, irrevocable, perhaps perilous. He would use
  diphtheria antitoxin. But certainly he could not obtain it from Pete Yeska's
  in Wheatsylvania.</p>

  <p>Leopolis?</p>

  <p>"Hustle up and get me Blassner, the druggist at Leopolis, on the 'phone,"
  he said to Novak, as calmly as he could contrive. He pictured Blassner
  driving through the night, respectfully bringing the antitoxin to The Doctor.
  While Novak bellowed into the farm-line telephone in the dining-room, Martin
  waited&mdash;waited&mdash;staring at the child; Mrs. Novak waited for him to
  do miracles; the child's tossing and hoarse gasping became horrible; and the
  glaring walls, the glaring lines of pale yellow woodwork, hypnotized him into
  sleepiness. It was too late for anything short of antitoxin or tracheotomy.
  Should he operate; cut into the wind-pipe that she might breathe? He stood
  and worried; he drowned in sleepiness and shook himself awake. He had to do
  something, with the mother kneeling there, gaping at him, beginning to look
  doubtful.</p>

  <p>"Get some hot cloths&mdash;towels, napkins&mdash;and keep 'em around her
  neck. I wish to God he'd get that telephone call!" he fretted.</p>

  <p>As Mrs. Novak, padding on thick slippered feet, brought in the hot cloths,
  Novak appeared with a blank "Nobody sleeping at the drug store, and
  Blassner's house-line is out of order."</p>

  <p>"Then listen. I'm afraid this may be serious. I've got to have antitoxin.
  Going to drive t' Leopolis and get it. You keep up these hot applications
  and&mdash;Wish we had an atomizer. And room ought to be moister. Got 'n
  alcohol stove? Keep some water boiling in here. No use of medicine. B' right
  back."</p>

  <p>He drove the twenty-four miles to Leopolis in thirty-seven minutes. Not
  once did he slow down for a cross-road. He defied the curves, the roots
  thrusting out into the road, though always one dark spot in his mind feared a
  blow-out and a swerve. The speed, the casting away of all caution, wrought in
  him a high exultation, and it was blessed to be in the cool air and alone,
  after the strain of Mrs. Novak's watching. In his mind all the while was the
  page in Osler regarding diphtheria, the very picture of the words: "In severe
  cases the first dose should be from 8,000&mdash;" No. Oh, yes: "&mdash;from
  10,000 to 15,000 units."</p>

  <p>He regained confidence. He thanked the god of science for antitoxin and
  for the gas motor. It was, he decided, a Race with Death.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to do it&mdash;going to pull it off and save that poor kid!" he
  rejoiced.</p>

  <p>He approached a grade crossing and hurled toward it, ignoring possible
  trains. He was aware of a devouring whistle, saw sliding light on the rails,
  and brought up sharp. Past him, ten feet from his front wheels, flung the
  Seattle Express like a flying volcano. The fireman was stoking, and even in
  the thin clearness of coming dawn the glow from the fire-box was appalling on
  the under side of the rolling smoke. Instantly the apparition was gone and
  Martin sat trembling, hands trembling on the little steering-wheel, foot
  trembling like St. Vitus's dance on the brake. "That was an awful' close
  thing!" he muttered, and thought of a widowed Leora, abandoned to Tozers. But
  the vision of the Novak child, struggling for each terrible breath, overrode
  all else. "Hell! I've killed the engine!" he groaned. He vaulted over the
  side, cranked the car, and dashed into Leopolis.</p>

  <p>To Crynssen County, Leopolis with its four thousand people was a
  metropolis, but in the pinched stillness of the dawn it was a tiny graveyard:
  Main Street a sandy expanse, the low shops desolate as huts. He found one
  place astir; in the bleak office of the Dakota Hotel the night clerk was
  playing poker with the 'bus-driver and the town policeman.</p>

  <p>They wondered at his hysterical entrance.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Arrowsmith, from Wheatsylvania. Kid dying from diphtheria. Where's
  Blassner live? Jump in my car and show me."</p>

  <p>The constable was a lanky old man, his vest swinging open over a
  collarless shirt, his trousers in folds, his eyes resolute. He guided Martin
  to the home of the druggist, he kicked the door, then, standing with his lean
  and bristly visage upraised in the cold early light, he bawled, "Ed! Hey,
  you, Ed! Come out of it!"</p>

  <p>Ed Blassner grumbled from the up-stairs window. To him, death and furious
  doctors had small novelty. While he drew on his trousers and coat he was to
  be heard discoursing to his drowsy wife on the woe of druggists and the
  desirability of moving to Los Angeles and going into real estate. But he did
  have diphtheria antitoxin in his shop, and sixteen minutes after Martin's
  escape from being killed by a train he was speeding to Henry Novak's.</p><br>

  <h3>VI.</h3>

  <p class="first">The child was still alive when he came brusquely into the
  house</p>

  <p>All the way back he had seen her dead and stiff. He grunted "Thank God!"
  and angrily called for hot water. He was no longer the embarrassed cub doctor
  but the wise and heroic physician who had won the Race with Death, and in the
  Peasant eyes of Mrs. Novak, in Henry's nervous obedience, he read his
  power.</p>

  <p>Swiftly, smoothly, he made intravenous injection of the antitoxin, and
  stood expectant.</p>

  <p>The child's breathing did not at first vary, as she choked in the labor of
  expelling her breath. There was a gurgle, a struggle in which her face
  blackened, and she was still. Martin peered, incredulous. Slowly the Novaks
  began to glower, shaky hands at their lips. Slowly they knew the child was
  gone.</p>

  <p>In the hospital, death had become indifferent and natural to Martin. He
  had said to Angus, he had heard nurses say one to another, quite cheerfully,
  "Well, fifty-seven has just passed out." Now he raged with desire to do the
  impossible. She <i>couldn't</i> be dead. He'd do something&mdash;All the
  while he was groaning, "I should've operated&mdash;I should have." So
  insistent was the thought that for a time he did not realize that Mrs. Novak
  was clamoring, "She is dead? Dead?"</p>

  <p>He nodded, afraid to look at the woman.</p>

  <p>"You killed her, with that needle thing! And not even tell us, so we could
  call the priest!"</p>

  <p>He crawled past her lamentations and the man's sorrow and drove home,
  empty of heart.</p>

  <p>"I shall never practice medicine again," he reflected.</p>

  <p>"I'm through," he said to Leora. "I'm no good. I should of operated. I
  can't face people, when they know about it. I'm through. I'll go get a lab
  job&mdash;Dawson Hunziker or some place."</p>

  <p>Salutary was the tartness with which she protested, "You're the most
  conceited man that ever lived! Do you think you're the only doctor that ever
  lost a patient? I know you did everything you could." But he went about next
  day torturing himself, the more tortured when Mr. Tozer whined at supper,
  "Henry Novak and his woman was in town today. They say you ought to have
  saved their girl. Why didn't you give your mind to it and manage to cure her
  somehow? Ought to tried. Kind of too bad, because the Novaks have a lot of
  influence with all these Pole and Hunky farmers."</p>

  <p>After a night when he was too tired to sleep, Martin suddenly drove to
  Leopolis.</p>

  <p>From the Tozers he had heard almost religious praise of Dr. Adam Winter of
  Leopolis, a man of nearly seventy, the pioneer physician of Crynssen County,
  and to this sage he was fleeing. As he drove he mocked furiously his
  melodramatic Race with Death, and he came wearily into the dust-whirling Main
  Street. Dr. Winter's office was above a grocery, in a long "block" of bright
  red brick stores with an Egyptian cornice&mdash;of tin. The darkness of the
  broad hallway was soothing after the prairie heat and incandescence. Martin
  had to wait till three respectful patients had been received by Dr. Winter, a
  hoary man with a sympathetic bass voice, before he was admitted to the
  consultation-room.</p>

  <p>The examining-chair was of doubtful superiority to that once used by Doc
  Vickerson of Elk Mills, and sterilizing was apparently done in a wash-bowl,
  but in a corner was an electric therapeutic cabinet with more electrodes and
  pads than Martin had ever seen.</p>

  <p>He told the story of the Novaks, and Winter cried, "Why, Doctor, you did
  everything you could have and more too. Only thing is, next time, in a
  crucial case, you better call some older doctor in consultation&mdash;not
  that you need his advice, but it makes a hit with the family, it divides the
  responsibility, and keeps 'em from going around criticizing. I, uh, I
  frequently have the honor of being called by some of my younger colleagues.
  Just wait. I'll 'phone the editor of the Gazette and give him an item about
  the case."</p>

  <p>When he had telephoned, Dr. Winter shook hands ardently. He indicated his
  electric cabinet. "Got one of those things yet? Ought to, my boy. Don't know
  as I use it very often, except with the cranks that haven't anything the
  matter with 'em, but say, it would surprise you how it impresses folks. Well,
  Doctor, welcome to Crynssen County. Married? Won't you and your wife come
  take dinner with us some Sunday noon? Mrs. Winter will be real pleased to
  meet you. And if I ever can be of service to you in a consultation&mdash;I
  only charge a very little more than my regular fee, and it looks so well,
  talking the case over with an older man."</p>

  <p>Driving home, Martin fell into vain and wicked boasting:</p>

  <p>"You bet I'll stick to it! At worst, I'll never be as bad as that
  snuffling old fee-splitter!"</p>

  <p>Two weeks after, the Wheatsylvania Eagle, a smeary four-page rag,
  reported:</p><br>

  <p class="quote">Our enterprising contemporary, the Leopolis Gazette, had as
  follows last week to say of one of our townsmen who we recently welcomed to
  our midst.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Dr. M. Arrowsmith of Wheatsylvania is being congratulated,
  we are informed by our valued pioneer local physician, Dr. Adam Winter, by
  the medical fraternity all through the Pony River Valley, there being no
  occupation or profession more unselfishly appreciative of each other's
  virtues than the medical gentlemen, on the courage and enterprise he recently
  displayed in addition to his scientific skill.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Being called to attend the little daughter of Henry Norwalk
  of near Delft the well-known farmer and finding the little one near death
  with diphtheria he made a desperate attempt to save it by himself bringing
  antitoxin from Blassner our ever popular druggist, who had on hand a full and
  fresh supply. He drove out and back in his gasoline chariot, making the total
  distance of 48 miles in 79 minutes.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Fortunately our ever alert policeman, Joe Colby, was on the
  job and helped Dr. Arrowsmith find Mr. Blassner's bungalow on Red River
  Avenue and this gentleman rose from bed and hastened to supply the doctor
  with the needed article but unfortunately the child was already too low to be
  saved but it is by such incidents of pluck and quick thinking as well as
  knowledge which make the medical profession one of our greatest
  blessings."</p><br>

  <p>Two hours after this was published, Miss Agnes Ingleblad came in for
  another discussion of her non-existent ailments, and two days later Henry
  Novak appeared, saying proudly:</p>

  <p>"Well, Doc, we all done what we could for the poor little girl, but I
  guess I waited too long calling you. The woman is awful' cut up. She and I
  was reading that piece in the Eagle about it. We showed it to the priest.
  Say, Doc, I wish you'd take a look at my foot. I got kind of a rheumatic pain
  in the ankle."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">When he had practiced medicine in Wheatsylvania for one
  year, Martin was an inconspicuous but not discouraged country doctor. In
  summer Leora and he drove to the Pony River for picnic suppers and a swim,
  very noisy, splashing, and immodest; through autumn he went duck-hunting with
  Bert Tozer, who became nearly tolerable when he stood at sunset on a pass
  between two slews; and with winter isolating the village in a sun-blank
  desert of snow, they had sleigh-rides, card-parties, "sociables" at the
  churches.</p>

  <p>When Martin's flock turned to him for help, their need and their patient
  obedience made them beautiful. Once or twice he lost his temper with jovial
  villagers who bountifully explained to him that he was less aged than he
  might have been; once or twice he drank too much whisky at poker parties in
  the back room of the Co-operative Store; but he was known as reliable,
  skillful, and honest&mdash;and on the whole he was rather less distinguished
  than Alec Ingleblad the barber, less prosperous than Nils Krag the carpenter,
  and less interesting to his neighbors than the Finnish garageman.</p>

  <p>Then one accident and one mistake made him famous for full twelve miles
  about.</p>

  <p>He had gone fishing, in the spring. As he passed a farmhouse a woman ran
  out shrieking that her baby had swallowed a thimble and was choking to death.
  Martin had for surgical kit a large jack-knife. He sharpened it on the
  farmer's oilstone, sterilized it in the tea-kettle, operated on the baby's
  throat, and saved its life.</p>

  <p>Every newspaper in the Pony River Valley had a paragraph, and before this
  sensation was over he cured Miss Agnes Ingleblad of her desire to be
  cured.</p>

  <p>She had achieved cold hands and a slow circulation, and he was called at
  midnight. He was soggily sleepy, after two country drives on muddy roads, and
  in his torpor he gave her an overdose of strychnin, which so shocked and
  stimulated her that she decided to be well. It was so violent a change that
  it made her more interesting than being an invalid&mdash;people had of late
  taken remarkably small pleasure in her symptoms. She went about praising
  Martin, and all the world said, "I hear this Doc Arrowsmith is the only
  fellow Agnes ever doctored with that's done her a mite of good."</p>

  <p>He gathered a practice small, sound, and in no way remarkable. Leora and
  he moved from the Tozers' to a cottage of their own, with a
  parlor-dining-room which displayed a nickeled stove on bright, new,
  pleasant-smelling linoleum, and a golden-oak sideboard with a souvenir
  match-holder from Lake Minnetonka. He bought a small Roentgen ray outfit; and
  he was made a director of the Tozer bank. He became too busy to long for his
  days of scientific research, which had never existed, and Leora sighed:</p>

  <p>"It's fierce, being married. I did expect I'd have to follow you out on
  the road and be a hobo, but I never expected to be a Pillar of the Community.
  Well, I'm too lazy to look up a new husband. Only I warn you: when you become
  the Sunday School superintendent, you needn't expect me to play the organ and
  smile at the cute jokes you make about Willy's not learning his Golden
  Text."</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">So did Martin stumble into respectability.</p>

  <p>In the autumn of 1912, when Mr. Debs, Mr. Roosevelt, Mr. Wilson, and Mr.
  Taft were campaigning for the presidency, when Martin Arrowsmith had lived in
  Wheatsylvania for a year and a half, Bert Tozer became a Prominent Booster.
  He returned from the state convention of the Modern Woodmen of America with
  notions. Several towns had sent boosting delegations to the convention, and
  the village of Groningen had turned out a motor procession of five cars, each
  with an enormous pennant, "Groningen for White Men and Black Dirt."</p>

  <p>Bert came back clamoring that every motor in town must carry a
  Wheatsylvania pennant. He had bought thirty of them and they were on sale at
  the bank at seventy-five cents apiece. This, Bert explained to everyone who
  came into the bank, was exactly cost-price, which was within eleven cents of
  the truth. He came galloping at Martin, demanding that he be the first to
  display a pennant.</p>

  <p>"I don't want one of those fool things flopping from my 'bus," protested
  Martin. "What's the idea, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"What's the <i>idea?</i> To advertise your own town, of course!"</p>

  <p>"What is there to advertise? Do you think you're going to make strangers
  believe Wheatsylvania is a metropolis like New York or Jimtown by hanging a
  dusty rag behind a secondhand tin Lizzie?"</p>

  <p>"You never did have any patriotism! Let me tell you, Mart, if you don't
  put on a banner I'll see to it that everybody in town notices it!"</p>

  <p>While the other rickety cars of the village announced to the world, or at
  least to several square miles of the world, that Wheatsylvania was the
  "Wonder Town of Central N. D.," Martin's clattering Ford went bare; and when
  his enemy Norblom remarked, "I like to see a fellow have some public spirit
  and appreciate the place he gets his money outa," the citizenry nodded and
  spat, and began to question Martin's fame as a worker of miracles.</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">He had intimates&mdash;the barber, the editor of the Eagle,
  the garageman&mdash;to whom he talked comfortably of hunting and the crops,
  and with whom he played poker. Perhaps he was too intimate with them. It was
  the theory of Crynssen County that it was quite all right for a young
  professional man to take a timely drink providing he kept it secret and made
  up for it by yearning over the clergy of the neighborhood. But with the
  clergy Martin was brief, and his drinking and poker he never concealed.</p>

  <p>If he was bored by the United Brethren minister's discourse on doctrine,
  on the wickedness of movies, and the scandalous pay of pastors, it was not at
  all because he was a distant and supersensitive young man but because he
  found more savor in the garageman's salty remarks on the art of remembering
  to ante in poker.</p>

  <p>Through all the state there were celebrated poker players, rustic-looking
  men with stolid faces, men who sat in shirtsleeves, chewing tobacco; men
  whose longest remark was "By me," and who delighted to plunder the gilded and
  condescending traveling salesmen. When there was news of a "big game on," the
  county sports dropped in silently and went to work&mdash;the sewing-machine
  agent from Leopolis, the undertaker from Vanderheide's Grove, the bootlegger
  from St. Luke, the red fat man from Melody who had no known profession.</p>

  <p>Once (still do men tell of it gratefully, up and down the Valley), they
  played for seventy-two unbroken hours, in the office of the Wheatsylvania
  garage. It had been a livery-stable; it was littered with robes and long
  whips, and the smell of horses mingled with the reek of gasoline.</p>

  <p>The players came and went, and sometimes they slept on the floor for an
  hour or two, but they were never less than four in the game. The stink of
  cheap feeble cigarettes and cheap powerful cigars hovered about the table
  like a malign spirit; the floor was scattered with stubs, matches, old cards,
  and whisky bottles. Among the warriors were Martin, Alec Ingleblad the
  barber, and a highway engineer, all of them stripped to flannel undershirts,
  not moving for hour on hour, ruffling their cards, eyes squinting and
  vacant.</p>

  <p>When Bert Tozer heard of the affair, he feared for the good fame of
  Wheatsylvania, and to everyone he gossiped about Martin's evil ways and his
  own patience. Thus it happened that while Martin was at the height of his
  prosperity and credit as a physician, along the Pony River Valley sinuated
  the whispers that he was a gambler, that he was a "drinking man," that he
  never went to church; and all the godly enjoyed mourning, "Too bad to see a
  decent young man like that going to the dogs."</p>

  <p>Martin was as impatient as he was stubborn. He resented the well-meant
  greetings: "You ought to leave a little hooch for the rest of us to drink,
  Doc," or "I s'pose you're too busy playing poker to drive out to the house
  and take a look at the woman." He was guilty of an absurd and boyish
  tactlessness when he heard Norblom observing to the postmaster, "A fellow
  that calls himself a doctor just because he had luck with that fool Agnes
  Ingleblad, he hadn't ought to go getting drunk and disgracing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Martin stopped. "Norblom! You talking about me?"</p>

  <p>The storekeeper turned slowly. "I got more important things to do 'n talk
  about you," he cackled.</p>

  <p>As Martin went on he heard laughter.</p>

  <p>He told himself that these villagers were generous; that their snooping
  was in part an affectionate interest, and inevitable in a village where the
  most absorbing event of the year was the United Brethren Sunday School picnic
  on Fourth of July. But he could not rid himself of twitchy discomfort at
  their unending and maddeningly detailed comments on everything. He felt as
  though the lightest word he said in his consultation-room would be megaphoned
  from flapping ear to ear all down the country roads.</p>

  <p>He was contented enough in gossiping about fishing with the barber, nor
  was he condescending to meteorologicomania, but except for Leora he had no
  one with whom he could talk of his work. Angus Duer had been cold, but Angus
  had his teeth into every change of surgical technique, and he was an acrid
  debater. Martin saw that, unless he struggled, not only would he harden into
  timid morality under the pressure of the village, but be fixed in a routine
  of prescriptions and bandaging.</p>

  <p>He might find a stimulant in Dr. Hesselink of Groningen.</p>

  <p>He had seen Hesselink only once, but everywhere he heard of him as the
  most honest practitioner in the Valley. On impulse Martin drove down to call
  on him.</p>

  <p>Dr. Hesselink was a man of forty, ruddy, tall, broad-shouldered. You knew
  immediately that he was careful and that he was afraid of nothing, however
  much he might lack in imagination. He received Martin with no vast
  ebullience, and his stare said, "Well, what do you want? I'm a busy man."</p>

  <p>"Doctor," Martin chattered, "do you find it hard to keep up with medical
  developments?"</p>

  <p>"No. Read the medical journals."</p>

  <p>"Well, don't you&mdash;gosh, I don't want to get sentimental about it, but
  don't you find that without contact with the Big Guns you get mentally
  lazy&mdash;sort of lacking in inspiration?"</p>

  <p>"I do not! There's enough inspiration for me in trying to help the
  sick."</p>

  <p>To himself Martin was protesting, "All right, if you don't want to be
  friendly, go to the devil!" But he tried again:</p>

  <p>"I know. But for the game of the thing, for the pleasure of increasing
  medical knowledge, how can you keep up if you don't have anything but routine
  practice among a lot of farmers?"</p>

  <p>"Arrowsmith, I may do you an injustice, but there's a lot of you young
  practitioners who feel superior to the farmers, that are doing their own jobs
  better than you are. You think that if you were only in the city with
  libraries and medical meetings and everything, you'd develop. Well, I don't
  know of anything to prevent your studying at home! You consider yourself so
  much better educated than these rustics, but I notice you say 'gosh' and 'Big
  Guns' and that sort of thing. How much do you read? Personally, I'm extremely
  well satisfied. My people pay me an excellent living wage, they appreciate my
  work, and they honor me by election to the schoolboard. I find that a good
  many of these farmers think a lot harder and squarer than the swells I meet
  in the city. Well! I don't see any reason for feeling superior, or lonely
  either!"</p>

  <p>"Hell, I don't!" Martin mumbled. As he drove back he raged at Hesselink's
  superiority about not feeling superior, but he stumbled into uncomfortable
  meditation. It was true; he was half-educated. He was supposed to be a
  college graduate but he knew nothing of economics, nothing of history,
  nothing of music or painting. Except in hasty bolting for examinations he had
  read no poetry save that of Robert Service, and the only prose besides
  medical journalism at which he looked nowadays was the baseball and murder
  news in the Minneapolis papers and Wild West stories in the magazines.</p>

  <p>He reviewed the "intelligent conversation" which, in the desert of
  Wheatsylvania, he believed himself to have conducted at Mohalis. He
  remembered that to Clif Clawson it had been pretentious to use any phrase
  which was not as colloquial and as smutty as the speech of a truck-driver,
  and that his own discourse had differed from Clif's largely in that it had
  been less fantastic and less original. He could recall nothing save the
  philosophy of Max Gottlieb, occasional scoldings of Angus Duer, one out of
  ten among Madeline Fox's digressions, and the councils of Dad Silva which was
  above the level of Alec Ingleblad's barber-shop.</p>

  <p>He came home hating Hesselink but by no means loving himself; he fell upon
  Leora and, to her placid agreement, announced that they were "going to get
  educated, if it kills us." He went at it as he had gone at bacteriology.</p>

  <p>He read European history aloud at Leora, who looked interested or at least
  forgiving; he worried the sentences in a copy of "The Golden Bowl" which an
  unfortunate school-teacher had left at the Tozers'; he borrowed a volume of
  Conrad from the village editor and afterward, as he drove the prairie roads,
  he was marching into jungle villages&mdash;sun helmets, orchids, lost temples
  of obscene and dog-faced deities, secret and sun-scarred rivers. He was
  conscious of his own mean vocabulary. It cannot be said that he became
  immediately and conspicuously articulate, yet it is possible that in those
  long intense evenings of reading with Leora he advanced a step or two toward
  the tragic enchantments of Max Gottlieb's world&mdash;enchanting sometimes
  and tragic always.</p>

  <p>But in becoming a schoolboy again he was not so satisfied as Dr.
  Hesselink.</p><br>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">Gustaf Sondelius was back in America.</p>

  <p>In medical school, Martin had read of Sondelius, the soldier of science.
  He held reasonable and lengthy degrees, but he was a rich man and eccentric,
  and neither toiled in laboratories nor had a decent office and a home and a
  lacy wife. He roamed the world fighting epidemics and founding institutions
  and making inconvenient speeches and trying new drinks. He was a Swede by
  birth, a German by education, a little of everything by speech, and his clubs
  were in London, Paris, Washington, and New York. He had been heard of from
  Batoum and Fuchau, from Milan and Bechuanaland, from Antofagasta and Cape
  Romanzoff. Manson on Tropical Diseases mentions Sondelius's admirable method
  of killing rats with hydrocyanic acid gas, and The Sketch once mentioned his
  atrocious system in baccarat.</p>

  <p>Gustaf Sondelius shouted, in high places and low, that most diseases could
  be and must be wiped out; that tuberculosis, cancer, typhoid, the plague,
  influenza, were an invading army against which the world must
  mobilize&mdash;literally; that public health authorities must supersede
  generals and oil kings. He was lecturing through America, and his exclamatory
  assertions were syndicated in the press.</p>

  <p>Martin sniffed at most newspaper articles touching on science or health
  but Sondelius's violence caught him, and suddenly he was converted, and it
  was an important thing for him, that conversion.</p>

  <p>He told himself that however much he might relieve the sick, essentially
  he was a business man, in rivalry with Dr. Winter of Leopolis and Dr.
  Hesselink of Groningen; that though they might be honest, honesty and healing
  were less their purpose than making money; that to get rid of avoidable
  disease and produce a healthy population would be the worst thing in the
  world for them; and that they must all be replaced by public health
  officials.</p>

  <p>Like all ardent agnostics, Martin was a religious man. Since the death of
  his Gottlieb-cult he had unconsciously sought a new passion, and he found it
  now in Gustaf Sondelius's war on disease. Immediately he became as annoying
  to his patients as he had once been to Digamma Pi.</p>

  <p>He informed the farmers at Delft that they had no right to have so much
  tuberculosis.</p>

  <p>This was infuriating, because none of their rights as American citizens
  was better established, or more often used, than the privilege of being ill.
  They fumed, "Who does he think he is? We call him in for doctoring, not for
  bossing. Why, the damn' fool said we ought to burn down our houses&mdash;said
  we were committing a crime if we had the con. here! Won't stand for nobody
  talking to me like that!"</p>

  <p>Everything became clear to Martin&mdash;too clear. The nation must make
  the best physicians autocratic officials, at once, and that was all there was
  to it. As to how the officials were to become perfect executives, and how
  people were to be persuaded to obey them, he had no suggestions but only a
  beautiful faith. At breakfast he scolded, "Another idiotic day of writing
  prescriptions for bellyaches that ought never to have happened! If I could
  only get into the Big Fight, along with men like Sondelius! It makes me
  tired!"</p>

  <p>Leora murmured, "Yes, darling. I'll promise to be good. I won't have any
  little bellyaches or T.B. or anything, so please don't lecture me!"</p>

  <p>Even in his irritability he was gentle, for Leora was with child.</p><br>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="first">Their baby was coming in five months. Martin promised to it
  everything he had missed.</p>

  <p>"He's going to have a real education!" he gloated, as they sat on the
  porch in spring twilight. "He'll learn all this literature and stuff. We
  haven't done much ourselves&mdash;here we are, stuck in this two-by-twice
  crossroads for the rest of our lives&mdash;but maybe we've gone a little
  beyond our dads, and he'll go way beyond us."</p>

  <p>He was worried, for all his flamboyance. Leora had undue morning sickness.
  Till noon she dragged about the house, pea-green and tousled and
  hollow-faced. He found a sort of maid, and came home to help, to wipe the
  dishes and sweep the front walk. All evening he read to her, not history now
  and Henry James but "Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch," which both of them
  esteemed a very fine tale. He sat on the floor by the grubby second-hand
  couch on which she lay in her weakness; he held her hand and crowed:</p>

  <p>"Golly, we&mdash;No, not 'golly.' Well, what <i>can</i> you say except
  'golly'? Anyway: Some day we'll save up enough money for a couple months in
  Italy and all those places. All those old narrow streets and old castles!
  There must be scads of 'em that are couple hundred years old or older! And
  we'll take the boy...Even if he turns out to be a girl, darn him!...And he'll
  learn to chatter Wop and French and everything like a regular native, and his
  dad and mother'll be so proud! Oh, we'll be a fierce pair of old birds! We
  never did have any more morals 'n a rabbit, either of us, and probably when
  we're seventy we'll sit out on the doorstep and smoke pipes and snicker at
  all the respectable people going by, and tell each other scandalous stories
  about 'em till they want to take a shot at us, and our boy&mdash;he'll wear a
  plug hat and have a chauffeur&mdash;he won't dare to recognize us!"</p>

  <p>Trained now to the false cheerfulness of the doctor, he shouted, when she
  was racked and ghastly with the indignity of morning sickness, "There, that's
  fine, old girl! Wouldn't be making a good baby if you weren't sick. Everybody
  is." He was lying, and he was nervous. Whenever he thought of her dying, he
  seemed to die with her. Barren of her companionship, there would be nothing
  he wanted to do, nowhere to go. What would be the worth of having all the
  world if he could not show it to her, if she was not there&mdash;</p>

  <p>He denounced Nature for her way of tricking human beings, by every gay
  device of moonlight and white limbs and reaching loneliness, into having
  babies, then making birth as cruel and clumsy and wasteful as she could. He
  was abrupt and jerky with patients who called him into the country. With
  their suffering he was sympathetic as he had never been, for his eyes had
  opened to the terrible beauty of pain, but he must not go far from Leora's
  need.</p>

  <p>Her morning sickness turned into pernicious vomiting. Suddenly, while she
  was torn and inhuman with agony, he sent for Dr. Hesselink, and that horrible
  afternoon when the prairie spring was exuberant outside the windows of the
  poor iodoform-reeking room, they took the baby from her, dead.</p>

  <p>Had it been possible, he might have understood Hesselink's success then,
  have noted that gravity and charm, that pity and sureness, which made people
  entrust their lives to him. Not cold and blaming was Hesselink now, but an
  older and wiser brother, very compassionate. Martin saw nothing. He was not a
  physician. He was a terrified boy, less useful to Hesselink than the dullest
  nurse.</p>

  <p>When he was certain that Leora would recover, Martin sat by her bed,
  coaxing, "We'll just have to make up our minds we never can have a baby now,
  and so I want&mdash;Oh, I'm no good! And I've got a rotten temper. But to
  you, I want to be everything!"</p>

  <p>She whispered, scarce to be heard:</p>

  <p>"He would have been such a sweet baby. Oh, I know! I saw him so often.
  Because I knew he was going to be like you, When you were a baby." She tried
  to laugh. "Perhaps I wanted him because I could boss him. I've never had
  anybody that would let me boss him. So if I can't have a real baby, I'll have
  to bring you up. Make you a great man that everybody will wonder at, like
  your Sondelius...Darling, I worried so about your worrying&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He kissed her, and for hours they sat together, unspeaking, eternally
  understanding, in the prairie twilight.</p>

  <p>He came home in high cheerfulness, rode the youngest of his three children
  pickaback, and remarked to his wife:</p>

  <p>"Tessie, I got a swell idea."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and you got a swell breath, too. I wish you'd quit testing that old
  Spirits Frumentus bottle at the drug store!"</p>

  <p>"'At a girl! But honest, listen!"</p>

  <p>"I will not!" She bussed him heartily. "Nothing doing about driving to Los
  Angeles this summer. Too far, with all the brats squalling."</p>

  <p>"Sure. All right. But I mean: Let's pack up and light out and spend a week
  touring 'round the state. Say tomorrow or next day. Got nothing to keep me
  now except that obstetrical case, and we'll hand that over to Winter."</p>

  <p>"All right. We can try out the new thermos bottles!" Dr. Coughlin, his
  lady, and the children started at four in the morning. The car was at first
  too well arranged to be interesting, but after three days, as he approached
  you on the flat road that without an inch of curving was slashed for leagues
  through the grassy young wheat, you saw the doctor in his khaki suit, his
  horn-rimmed spectacles, and white linen boating hat; his wife in a green
  flannel blouse and a lace boudoir cap. The rest of the car was slightly
  confused. While you motored by you noticed a canvas Egyptian Water Bottle,
  mud on wheels and fenders, a spade, two older children leaning perilously out
  and making tongues at you, the baby's diapers hanging on a line across the
  tonneau, a torn copy of Snappy Stories, seven lollypop sticks, a jack, a
  fish-rod, and a rolled tent.</p>

  <p>Your last impression was of two large pennants labeled "Leopolis, N. D.,"
  and "Excuse Our Dust."</p>

  <p>The Coughlins had agreeable adventures. Once they were stuck in a
  mud-hole. To the shrieking admiration of the family, the doctor got them out
  by making a bridge of fence rails. Once the ignition ceased and, while they
  awaited a garageman summoned by telephone, they viewed a dairy farm with an
  electrical milking machine. All the way they were broadened by travel, and
  discovered the wonders of the great world: the movie theater at Roundup,
  which had for orchestra not only a hand-played piano but also a violin; the
  black fox farm at Melody; and the Severance water-tower, which was said to be
  the tallest in Central North Dakota.</p>

  <p>Dr. Coughlin "dropped in to pass the time of day," as he said, with all
  the doctors. At St. Luke he had an intimate friend in Dr. Tromp&mdash;at
  least they had met twice, at the annual meetings of the Pony River Valley
  Medical Association. When he told Tromp how bad they had found the hotels,
  Tromp looked uneasy and conscientious, and sighed, "If the wife could fix it
  up somehow, I'd like to invite you all to stay with us tonight."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't want to impose on you. Sure it wouldn't be any trouble?" said
  Coughlin.</p>

  <p>After Mrs. Tromp had recovered from her desire to call her husband aside
  and make unheard but vigorous observations, and after the oldest Tromp boy
  had learned that "it wasn't nice for a little gentleman to kick his wee
  guests that came from so far, far away," they were all very happy. Mrs.
  Coughlin and Mrs. Tromp bewailed the cost of laundry soap and butter, and
  exchanged recipes for pickled peaches, while the men, sitting on the edge of
  the porch, their knees crossed, eloquently waving their cigars, gave
  themselves up to the ecstasy of shop-talk:</p>

  <p>"Say, Doctor, how do you find collections?"</p>

  <p>(It was Coughlin speaking&mdash;or it might have been Tromp.)</p>

  <p>"Well, they're pretty good. These Germans pay up first rate. Never send
  'em a bill, but when they've harvested they come in and say, 'How much do I
  owe you, Doctor?'"</p>

  <p>"Yuh, the Germans are pretty good pay."</p>

  <p>"Yump, they certainly are. Not many dead-beats among the Germans."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's a fact. Say, tell me, Doctor, what do you do with your
  jaundice cases?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll tell you, Doctor: if it's a persistent case I usually give
  ammonium chlorid."</p>

  <p>"Do you? I've been giving ammonium chlorid but here the other day I see a
  communication in the Journal of the A.M.A. where a fellow was claiming it
  wasn't any good."</p>

  <p>"Is that a fact! Well, well! I didn't see that. Hum. Well. Say, Doctor, do
  you find you can do much with asthma?"</p>

  <p>"Well now, Doctor, just in confidence, I'm going to tell you something
  that may strike you as funny, but I believe that foxes' lungs are fine for
  asthma, and T.B. too. I told that to a Sioux City pulmonary specialist one
  time and he laughed at me&mdash;said it wasn't scientific&mdash;and I said to
  him, 'Hell!' I said, 'scientific!' I said, 'I don't know if it's the latest
  fad and wrinkle in science or not,' I said, 'but I get results, and that's
  what I'm looking for 's results!' I said. I tell you a plug G.P. may not have
  a lot of letters after his name, but he sees a slew of mysterious things that
  he can't explain, and I swear I believe most of these damn' alleged
  scientists could learn a whale of a lot from the plain country practitioners,
  let me tell you!"</p>

  <p>"Yuh, that's a fact. Personally I'd rather stay right here in the country
  and be able to do a little hunting and take it easy than be the classiest
  specialist in the cities. One time I kind of figured on becoming an X-ray
  specialist&mdash;place in New York where you can take the whole course in
  eight weeks&mdash;and maybe settling in Butte or Sioux Falls, but I figured
  that even if I got to making eight-ten thousand a year, 'twouldn't hardly
  mean more than three thousand does here and so&mdash;And a fellow has to
  consider his duty to his old patients."</p>

  <p>"That's so...Say, Doctor, say, what sort of fellow is McMinturn, down your
  way?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't like to knock any fellow practitioner, and I suppose he's
  well intentioned, but just between you and me he does too confounded much
  guesswork. Now you take you and me, we apply <i>science</i> to a case,
  instead of taking a chance and just relying on experience and going off
  half-cocked. But McMinturn, he doesn't know enough. And <i>say</i>, that wife
  of his, she's a caution&mdash;she's got the meanest tongue in four counties,
  and the way she chases around drumming up business for Mac&mdash;Well, I
  suppose that's their way of doing business."</p>

  <p>"Is old Winter keeping going?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, in a sort of way. You know how he is. Of course he's about
  twenty years behind the times, but he's a great hand-holder&mdash;keep some
  fool woman in bed six weeks longer than he needs to, and call around twice a
  day and chin with her&mdash;absolutely unnecessary."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you get your biggest competition from Silzer, Doctor?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you believe it, Doctor! He isn't beginning to do the practice he
  lets on to. Trouble with Silzer is, he's too brash&mdash;shoots off his mouth
  too much&mdash;likes to hear himself talk. Oh, say, by the way, have you run
  into this new fellow&mdash;will been located here about two years
  now&mdash;at Wheatsylvania&mdash;Arrowsmith?"</p>

  <p>"No, but they say he's a good bright young fellow."</p>

  <p>"Yes, they claim he's a brainy man&mdash;very well-informed&mdash;and I
  hear his wife is a nice brainy little woman."</p>

  <p>"I hear Arrowsmith hits it up too much though&mdash;likes his booze awful'
  well."</p>

  <p>"Yes, so they say. Shame, for a nice hustling young fellow. I like a nip
  myself, now and then, but a Drinking Man&mdash;! Suppose he's drunk and gets
  called out on a case! And a fellow from down there was telling me Arrowsmith
  is great on books and study, but he's a freethinker&mdash;never goes to
  church."</p>

  <p>"Is that a fact! Hm. Great mistake for any doctor to not identify himself
  with some good solid religious denomination, whether he believes the stuff or
  not. I tell you a priest or a preacher can send you an awful lot of
  business."</p>

  <p>"You bet he can! Well, this fellow said Arrowsmith was always arguing with
  the preachers&mdash;he told some Reverend that everybody ought to read this
  immunologist Max Gottlieb, and this Jacques Loeb&mdash;you know&mdash;the
  fellow that, well, I don't recall just exactly what it was, but he claimed he
  could create living fishes out of chemicals."</p>

  <p>"Sure! There you got it! That's the kind of delusions these laboratory
  fellows get unless they have some practical practice to keep 'em well
  balanced. Well, if Arrowsmith falls for that kind of fellow, no wonder people
  don't trust him."</p>

  <p>"That's so. Hm. Well, it's too bad Arrowsmith goes drinking and helling
  around and neglecting his family and his patients. I can see his finish.
  Shame. Well&mdash;wonder what time o' night it's getting to be?"</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">Bert Tozer wailed, "Mart, what you been doing to Dr.
  Coughlin of Leopolis? Fellow told me he was going around saying you were a
  booze-hoister and so on."</p>

  <p>"Did he? People do sort of keep an eye on one another around here, don't
  they?"</p>

  <p>"You bet your life they do, and that's why I tell you you ought to cut out
  the poker and the booze. You don't see <i>me</i> needing any liquor, do
  you?"</p>

  <p>Martin more desperately than ever felt the whole county watching him. He
  was not a praise-eater; he was not proud that he should feel misplaced; but
  however sturdily he struggled he saw himself outside the picture of
  Wheatsylvania and trudging years of country practice.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, without planning it, forgetting in his admiration for Sondelius
  and the health war his pride of the laboratory, he was thrown into a research
  problem.</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">There was blackleg among the cattle in Crynssen County. The
  state veterinarian had been called and Dawson Hunziker vaccine had been
  injected, but the disease spread. Martin heard the farmers wailing. He noted
  that the injected cattle showed no inflammation nor rise in temperature. He
  was roused by a suspicion that the Hunziker vaccine had insufficient living
  organisms, and he went yelping on the trail of his hypothesis.</p>

  <p>He obtained (by misrepresentations) a supply of the vaccine and tested it
  in his stuffy closet of a laboratory. He had to work out his own device for
  growing anaerobic cultures, but he had been trained by the Gottlieb who
  remarked, "Any man dat iss unable to build a filter out of toot'-picks, if he
  has to, would maybe better buy his results along with his fine equipment."
  Out of a large fruit-jar and a soldered pipe Martin made his apparatus.</p>

  <p>When he was altogether sure that the vaccine did not contain living
  blackleg organisms, he was much more delighted than if he had found that good
  Mr. Dawson Hunziker was producing honest vaccine.</p>

  <p>With no excuse and less encouragement he isolated blackleg organisms from
  sick cattle and prepared an attenuated vaccine of his own. It took much time.
  He did not neglect his patients but certainly he failed to appear in the
  stores, at the poker games. Leora and he dined on a sandwich every evening
  and hastened to the laboratory, to heat the cultures in the improvised
  water-bath, an ancient and leaky oatmeal-cooker with an alcohol lamp. The
  Martin who had been impatient of Hesselink was of endless patience as he
  watched his results. He whistled and hummed, and the hours from seven to
  midnight were a moment. Leora, frowning placidly, the tip of her tongue at
  the corner of her mouth, guarded the temperature like a good little
  watchdog.</p>

  <p>After three efforts with two absurd failures, he had a vaccine which
  satisfied him, and he injected a stricken herd. The blackleg stopped, which
  was for Martin the end and the reward, and he turned his notes and supply of
  vaccine over to the state veterinarian. For others, it was not the end. The
  veterinarian of the county denounced him for intruding on their right to save
  or kill cattle; the physicians hinted, "That's the kind of monkey-business
  that ruins the dignity of the profession. I tell you Arrowsmith's a medical
  nihilist and a notoriety-seeker, that's what he is. You mark my words,
  instead of his sticking to decent regular practice, you'll be hearing of his
  opening a quack sanitarium, one of these days!"</p>

  <p>He commented to Leora:</p>

  <p>"Dignity, hell! If I had my way I'd be doing research&mdash;oh, not this
  cold detached stuff of Gottlieb but really practical work&mdash;and then I'd
  have some fellow like Sondelius take my results and jam 'em down people's
  throats, and I'd make them and their cattle and their tabby-cats healthy
  whether they wanted to be or not, that's what I'd do!"</p>

  <p>In this mood he read in his Minneapolis paper, between a half column on
  the marriage of the light middleweight champion and three lines devoted to
  the lynching of an I.W.W. agitator, the announcement:</p><br>

  <p class="quote">Gustave Sundelios, well-known authority on cholera
  prevention, will give an address on "Heroes of Health" at the University
  summer school next Friday evening.</p><br>

  <p>He ran into the house gloating, "Lee! Sondelius going to lecture in
  Minneapolis. I'm going! Come on! We'll hear him and have a bat and
  everything!"</p>

  <p>"No, you run down by yourself. Be fine for you to get away from the town
  and the family and me for a while. I'll go down with you in the fall.
  Honestly. If I'm not in the way, maybe you can manage to have a good long
  talk with Dr. Sondelius."</p>

  <p>"Fat chance! The big city physicians and the state health authorities will
  be standing around him ten deep. But I'm going."</p><br>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">The prairie was hot, the wheat rattled in a weary breeze,
  the day-coach was gritty with cinders. Martin was cramped by the hours of
  slow riding. He drowsed and smoked and meditated. "I'm going to forget
  medicine and everything else," he vowed. "I'll go up and talk to somebody in
  the smoker and tell him I'm a shoe-salesman."</p>

  <p>He did. Unfortunately his confidant happened to be a real shoe-salesman,
  with a large curiosity as to what firm Martin represented, and he returned to
  the day coach with a renewed sense of injury. When he reached Minneapolis, in
  mid-afternoon, he hastened to the University and besought a ticket to the
  Sondelius lecture before he had even found a hotel, though not before he had
  found the long glass of beer which he had been picturing for a hundred
  miles.</p>

  <p>He had an informal but agreeable notion of spending his first evening of
  freedom in dissipation. Somewhere he would meet a company of worthies who
  would succor him with laughter and talk and many drinks&mdash;not too many
  drinks, of course&mdash;and motor very rapidly to Lake Minnetonka for a
  moonlight swim. He began his search for the brethren by having a cocktail at
  a hotel bar and dinner in a Hennepin Avenue restaurant. Nobody looked at him,
  nobody seemed to desire a companion. He was lonely for Leora, and all his
  state of grace, all his earnest and simple-hearted devotion to carousal,
  degenerated into sleepiness.</p>

  <p>As he turned and turned in his hotel bed he lamented, "And probably the
  Sondelius lecture will be rotten. Probably he's simply another Roscoe
  Geake."</p><br>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="first">In the hot night desultory students wandered up to the door
  of the lecture-hall, scanned the modest Sondelius poster, and ambled away.
  Martin was half minded to desert with them, and he went in sulkily. The hall
  was a third full of summer students and teachers, and men who might have been
  doctors or school-principals. He sat at the back, fanning with his straw hat,
  disliking the man with side-whiskers who shared the row with him,
  disapproving of Gustaf Sondelius, and as to himself having no good opinions
  whatever.</p>

  <p>Then the room was charged with vitality. Down the central aisle,
  ineffectively attended by a small fussy person, thundered a man with a smile,
  a broad brow, and a strawpile of curly flaxen hair&mdash;a Newfoundland dog
  of a man. Martin sat straight. He was strengthened to endure even the
  depressing man with side-whiskers as Sondelius launched out, in a musical
  bellow with Swedish pronunciation and Swedish singsong:</p>

  <p>"The medical profession can have but one desire: to destroy the medical
  profession. As for the laymen, they can be sure of but one thing: nine-tenths
  of what they know about health is not so, and with the other tenth they do
  nothing. As Butler shows in 'Erewhon'&mdash;the swine stole that idea from
  me, too, maybe thirty years before I ever got it&mdash;the only crime for
  w'ich we should hang people is having toobercoolosis."</p>

  <p>"Umph!" grunted the studious audience, doubtful whether it was fitting to
  be amused, offended, bored, or edified.</p>

  <p>Sondelius was a roarer and a playboy, but he knew incantations. With him
  Martin watched the heroes of yellow fever, Reed, Agramonte, Carroll, and
  Lazear; with him he landed in a Mexican port stilled with the plague and
  famished beneath the virulent sun; with him rode up the mountain trails to a
  hill town rotted with typhus; with him, in crawling August, when babies were
  parched skeletons, fought an ice trust beneath the gilt and blunted sword of
  the law.</p>

  <p>"That's what I want to do! Not just tinker at a lot of worn-out bodies but
  make a new world!" Martin hungered. "Gosh, I'd follow him through fire! And
  the way he lays out the crapehangers that criticize public health results! If
  I could only manage to meet him and talk to him for a couple o'
  minutes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He lingered after the lecture. A dozen people surrounded Sondelius on the
  platform; a few shook hands; a few asked questions; a doctor worried, "But
  how about the danger of free clinics and all those things drifting into
  socialism?" Martin stood back till Sondelius had been deserted. A janitor was
  closing the windows, very firmly and suggestively. Sondelius looked about,
  and Martin would have sworn that the Great Man was lonely. He shook hands
  with him, and quaked:</p>

  <p>"Sir, if you aren't due some place, I wonder if you'd like to come out and
  have a&mdash;a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Sondelius loomed over him in solar radiance and rumbled, "Have a drink?
  Well, I think maybe I would. How did the joke about the dog and his fleas go
  tonight? Do you think they liked it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, sure, you bet."</p>

  <p>The warrior who had been telling of feeding five thousand Tatars, of
  receiving a degree from a Chinese university and refusing a decoration from
  quite a good Balkan king, looked affectionately on his band of one disciple
  and demanded, "Was it all right&mdash;was it? Did they like it? So hot
  tonight, and I been lecturing nine time a week&mdash;Des Moines, Fort Dodge,
  LaCrosse, Elgin, Joliet [but he pronounced it Zho-lee-ay] and&mdash;I forget.
  Was it all right? Did they like it?"</p>

  <p>"Simply corking! Oh, they just ate it up! Honestly, I've never enjoyed
  anything so much in my life!"</p>

  <p>The prophet crowed, "Come! I buy a drink. As a hygienist, I war on
  alcohol. In excessive quantities it is almost as bad as coffee or even ice
  cream soda. But as one who is fond of talking, I find a nice long whisky and
  soda a great solvent of human idiocy. Is there a cool place with some
  Pilsener here in Detroit&mdash;no; where am I
  tonight?&mdash;Minneapolis?"</p>

  <p>"I understand there's a good beer-garden. And we can get the trolley right
  near here."</p>

  <p>Sondelius stared at him. "Oh, I have a taxi waiting."</p>

  <p>Martin was abashed by this luxury. In the taxi-cab he tried to think of
  the proper things to say to a celebrity.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Doctor, do they have city health boards in Europe?"</p>

  <p>Sondelius ignored him. "Did you see that girl going by? What ankles! What
  shoulders! Is it good beer at the beer-garden? Have they any decent cognac?
  Do you know Courvoisier 1865 cognac? Oof! Lecturing! I swear I will give it
  up. And wearing dress clothes a night like this! You know, I mean all the
  crazy things I say in my lectures, but let us now forget being earnest, let
  us drink, let us sing 'Der Graf von Luxemburg,' let us detach exquisite girls
  from their escorts, let us discuss the joys of 'Die Meistersinger,' which
  only I appreciate!"</p>

  <p>In the beer-garden the tremendous Sondelius discoursed of the Cosmos Club,
  Halle's investigation of infant mortality, the suitability of combining
  benedictine and apple-jack, Biarritz, Lord Haldane, the Doane-Buckley method
  of milk examination, George Gissing, and homard thermidor. Martin looked for
  a connection between Sondelius and himself, as one does with the notorious or
  with people met abroad. He might have said, "I think I met a man who knows
  you," or "I have had the pleasure of reading all your articles," but he
  fished with "Did you ever run into the two big men in my medical
  school&mdash;Winnemac&mdash;Dean Silva and Max Gottlieb?"</p>

  <p>"Silva? I don't remember. But Gottlieb&mdash;you know him? Oh!" Sondelius
  waved his mighty arms. "The greatest! The spirit of science! I had the
  pleasure to talk with him at McGurk. He would not sit here bawling like me!
  He makes me like a circus clown! He takes all my statements about
  epidemiology and shows me I am a fool! Ho, ho, ho!" He beamed, and was off on
  a denunciation of high tariff.</p>

  <p>Each topic had its suitable refreshment. Sondelius was a fantastic
  drinker, and zinc-lined. He mixed Pilsener, whisky, black coffee, and a
  liquid which the waiter asserted to be absinthe. "I should go to bed at
  midnight," he lamented, "but it is a cardinal sin to interrupt good talk.
  Yoost tempt me a little! I am an easy one to be tempted! But I must have five
  hours' sleep. Absolute! I lecture in&mdash;it's some place in
  Iowa&mdash;tomorrow evening. Now that I am past fifty, I cannot get along
  with three hours as I used to, and yet I have found so many new things that I
  want to talk about."</p>

  <p>He was more eloquent than ever; then he was annoyed. A surly-looking man
  at the next table listened and peered, and laughed at them. Sondelius dropped
  from Haffkine's cholera serum to an irate:</p>

  <p>"If that fellow stares at me some more, I am going over and kill him! I am
  a peaceful man, now that I am not so young, but I do not like starers. I will
  go and argue with him. I will yoost hit him a little!"</p>

  <p>While the waiters came rushing, Sondelius charged the man, threatened him
  with enormous fists, then stopped, shook hands repeatedly, and brought him
  back to Martin.</p>

  <p>"This is a born countryman of mine, from Gottenborg. He is a carpenter.
  Sit down, Nilsson, sit down and have a drink. Herumph! <i>vai</i>-ter!"</p>

  <p>The carpenter was a socialist, a Swedish Seventh Day Adventist, a
  ferocious arguer, and fond of drinking aquavit. He denounced Sondelius as an
  aristocrat, he denounced Martin for his ignorance of economics, he denounced
  the waiter concerning the brandy; Sondelius and Martin and the waiter
  answered with vigor; and the conversation became admirable. Presently they
  were turned out of the beer-garden and the three of them crowded into the
  still waiting taxicab, which shook to their debating. Where they went, Martin
  could never trace. He may have dreamed the whole tale. Once they were
  apparently in a roadhouse on a long street which must have been University
  Avenue; once in a saloon on Washington Avenue South, where three tramps were
  sleeping at the end of the bar; once in the carpenter's house, where an
  unexplained man made coffee for them.</p>

  <p>Wherever they might be, they were at the same time in Moscow and Curacao
  and Murwillumbah. The carpenter created communistic states, while Sondelius,
  proclaiming that he did not care whether he worked under socialism or an
  emperor so long as he could bully people into being well, annihilated
  tuberculosis and by dawn had cancer fleeing.</p>

  <p>They parted at four, tearfully swearing to meet again, in Minnesota or
  Stockholm, in Rio or on the southern seas, and Martin started for
  Wheatsylvania to put an end to all this nonsense of allowing people to be
  ill.</p>

  <p>And the great god Sondelius had slain Dean Silva, as Silva had slain
  Gottlieb, Gottlieb had slain "Encore" Edwards the playful chemist, Edwards
  had slain Doc Vickerson, and Vickerson had slain the minister's son who had a
  real trapeze in his barn.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">Dr. Woestijne of Vanderheide's Grove acted in spare time as
  Superintendent of Health for Crynssen County, but the office was not well
  paid and it did not greatly interest him. When Martin burst in and offered to
  do all the work for half the pay, Woestijne accepted with benevolence,
  assuring him that it would have a great effect on his private practice.</p>

  <p>It did. It almost ruined his private practice.</p>

  <p>There was never an official appointment. Martin signed Woestijne's name
  (spelling it in various interesting ways, depending on how he felt) to
  papers, and the Board of County Commissioners recognized Martin's limited
  power, but the whole thing was probably illegal.</p>

  <p>There was small science and considerably less heroism in his first furies
  as a health officer, but a great deal of irritation for his fellow-townsmen.
  He poked into yards, he denounced Mrs. Beeson for her reeking ash-barrels,
  Mr. Norblom for piling manure on the street, and the schoolboard for the
  school ventilation and lack of instruction in tooth-brushing. The citizens
  had formerly been agitated by his irreligion, his moral looseness, and his
  lack of local patriotism, but when they were prodded out of their comfortable
  and probably beneficial dirt, they exploded.</p>

  <p>Martin was honest and appallingly earnest, but if he had the innocence of
  the dove he lacked the wisdom of the serpent. He did not make them understand
  his mission; he scarce tried to make them understand. His authority, as
  Woestijne's alter ego, was imposing on paper but feeble in action, and it was
  worthless against the stubbornness which he aroused.</p>

  <p>He advanced from garbage-spying to a drama of infection. The community at
  Delft had a typhoid epidemic which slackened and continually reappeared. The
  villagers believed that it came from a tribe of squatters six miles up the
  creek, and they considered lynching the offenders, as a practical protest and
  an interesting break in wheat-farming. When Martin insisted that in six miles
  the creek would purify any waste and that the squatters were probably not the
  cause, he was amply denounced.</p>

  <p>"He's a fine one, he is, to go around blatting that we'd ought to have
  more health precautions! Here we go and show him where there's some
  hellhounds that ought to be shot, and them only Bohunks anyway, and he
  doesn't do a darn' thing but shoot a lot of hot air about germicidal effect
  or whatever the fool thing is," remarked Kaes, the wheat-buyer at the Delft
  elevator.</p>

  <p>Flashing through the county, not neglecting but certainly not enlarging
  his own practice, Martin mapped every recent case of typhoid within five
  miles of Delft. He looked into milk-routes and grocery deliveries. He
  discovered that most of the cases had appeared after the visits of an
  itinerant seamstress, a spinster virtuous and almost painfully hygienic. She
  had had typhoid four years before.</p>

  <p>"She's a chronic carrier of the bugs. She's got to be examined," he
  announced.</p>

  <p>He found her sewing at the house of an old farmer-preacher.</p>

  <p>With modest indignation she refused to be examined, and as he went away
  she could be heard weeping at the insult, while the preacher cursed him from
  the doorstep. He returned with the township police officer and had the
  seamstress arrested and confined in the segregation ward of the county
  poor-farm. In her discharges he found billions of typhoid bacilli.</p>

  <p>The frail and decent body was not comfortable in the board-lined
  whitewashed ward. She was shamed and frightened. She had always been well
  beloved, a gentle, shabby, bright-eyed spinster who brought presents to the
  babies, helped the overworked farmwives to cook dinner, and sang to the
  children in her thin sparrow voice. Martin was reviled for persecuting her.
  "He wouldn't dare pick on her if she wasn't so poor," they said, and they
  talked of a jail-delivery.</p>

  <p>Martin fretted. He called upon the seamstress at the poor-farm, he tried
  to make her understand that there was no other place for her, he brought her
  magazines and sweets. But he was firm. She could not go free. He was
  convinced that she had caused at least one hundred cases of typhoid, with
  nine deaths.</p>

  <p>The county derided him. Cause typhoid now, when she had been well for four
  years? The County Commissioners and the County Board of Health called Dr.
  Hesselink in from the next county. He agreed with Martin and his maps. Every
  meeting of the Commissioners was a battle now, and it was uncertain whether
  Martin would be ruined or throned.</p>

  <p>Leora saved him and the seamstress. "Why not take up a collection to send
  her off to some big hospital where she can be treated, or where they can keep
  her if she can't be cured?" said she.</p>

  <p>The seamstress entered a sanitarium&mdash;and was amiably forgotten by
  everyone for the rest of her life&mdash;and his recent enemies said of
  Martin, "He's mighty smart, and right on the job." Hesselink drove over to
  inform him, "You did pretty well this time, Arrowsmith. Glad to see you're
  settling down to business."</p>

  <p>Martin was slightly cocky, and immediately bounded after a fine new
  epidemic. He was so fortunate as to have a case of small-pox and several
  which he suspected. Some of these lay across the border in Mencken County,
  Hesselink's domain, and Hesselink laughed at him. "It's probably chicken-pox,
  except your one case. Mighty rarely you get small-pox in summer," he
  chuckled, while Martin raged up and down the two counties, proclaiming the
  scourge, imploring everyone to be vaccinated, thundering, "There's going to
  be all hell let loose here in ten or fifteen days!"</p>

  <p>But the United Brethren parson, who served chapels in Wheatsylvania and
  two other villages, was an anti-vaccinationist and he preached against it.
  The villages sided with him. Martin went from house to house, beseeching
  them, offering to treat them without charge. As he had never taught them to
  love him and follow him as a leader, they questioned, they argued long and
  easily on doorsteps, they cackled that he was drunk. Though for weeks his
  strongest draft had been the acrid coffee of the countryside, they peeped one
  to another that he was drunk every night, that the United Brethren minister
  was about to expose him from the pulpit.</p>

  <p>And ten dreadful days went by and fifteen, and all but the first case did
  prove to be chicken-pox. Hesselink gloated and the village roared and Martin
  was the butt of the land.</p>

  <p>He had only a little resented their gossip about his wickedness, only in
  evenings of slow depression had he meditated upon fleeing from them, but at
  their laughter he was black furious.</p>

  <p>Leora comforted him with cool hands. "It'll pass over," she said. But it
  did not pass.</p>

  <p>By autumn it had become such a burlesque epic as peasants love through all
  the world. He had, they mirthfully related, declared that anybody who kept
  hogs would die of small-pox; he had been drunk for a week, and diagnosed
  everything from gall-stones to heart-burn as small-pox. They greeted him,
  with no meaning of offense in their snickering, "Got a pimple on my chin,
  Doc. What is 't&mdash;small-pox?"</p>

  <p>More terrible than their rage is the people's laughter, and if it rends
  tyrants, with equal zest it pursues the saint and wise man and befouls their
  treasure.</p>

  <p>When the neighborhood suddenly achieved a real epidemic of diphtheria and
  Martin shakily preached antitoxin, one-half of them remembered his failure to
  save Mary Novak and the other half clamored, "Oh, give us a rest! You got
  epidemics on the brain!" That a number of children quite adequately died did
  not make them relinquish their comic epic.</p>

  <p>Then it was that Martin came home to Leora and said quietly, "I'm licked.
  I've got to get out. Nothing more I can do here. Take years before they'd
  trust me again. They're so damned <i>humorous!</i> I'm going to go get a real
  job&mdash;public health."</p>

  <p>"I'm so glad! You're too good for them here. We'll find some big place
  where they'll appreciate your work."</p>

  <p>"No, that's not fair. I've learned a little something. I've failed here.
  I've antagonized too many people. I didn't know how to handle them. We could
  stick it out, and I would, except that life is short and I think I'm a good
  worker in some ways. Been worrying about being a coward, about running away,
  'turning my&mdash;' What is it? '&mdash;turning my hand from the plow.' I
  don't care now! By God, I know what I can do! Gottlieb saw it! And I want to
  get to work. On we go. All right?"</p>

  <p>"Of course!"</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">He had read in the Journal of the American Medical
  Association that Gustaf Sondelius was giving a series of lectures at Harvard.
  He wrote asking whether he knew of a public health appointment. Sondelius
  answered, in a profane and blotty scrawl, that he remembered with joy their
  Minneapolis vacation, that he disagreed with Entwisle of Harvard about the
  nature of metathrombin, that there was an excellent Italian restaurant in
  Boston, and that he would inquire among his health-official friends as to a
  position.</p>

  <p>Two days later he wrote that Dr. Almus Pickerbaugh Director of Public
  Health in the city of Nautilus, Iowa, was looking for a
  second-in&mdash;command, and would probably be willing to send
  particulars.</p>

  <p>Leora and Martin swooped on an almanac.</p>

  <p>Gosh! Sixty-nine thousand people in Nautilus! Against three hundred and
  sixty-six here&mdash;no, wait, it's three hundred and sixty-seven now, with
  that new baby of Pete Yeska's that the dirty swine called in Hesselink for.
  People! People that can talk! Theaters! Maybe concerts! Leora, we'll be like
  a pair of kids let loose from school!"</p>

  <p>He telegraphed for details, to the enormous interest of the station agent,
  who was also telegraph operator.</p>

  <p>The mimeographed form which was sent to him said that Dr. Pickerbaugh
  required an assistant who would be the only full-time medical officer besides
  Pickerbaugh himself, as the clinic and school doctors were private physicians
  working part-time. The assistant would be epidemiologist, bacteriologist, and
  manager of the office clerks, the nurses, and the lay inspectors of dairies
  and sanitation. The salary would be twenty-five hundred dollars a
  year&mdash;against the fifteen or sixteen hundred Martin was making in
  Wheatsylvania.</p>

  <p>Proper recommendations were desired.</p>

  <p>Martin wrote to Sondelius, to Dad Silva, and to Max Gottlieb, now at the
  McGurk Institute in New York.</p>

  <p>Dr. Pickerbaugh informed him, "I have received very pleasant letters from
  Dean Silva and Dr. Sondelius about you, but the letter from Dr. Gottlieb is
  quite remarkable. He says you have rare gifts as a laboratory man. I take
  great pleasure in offering you the appointment; kindly wire."</p>

  <p>Not till then did Martin completely realize that he was leaving
  Wheatsylvania&mdash;the tedium of Bert Tozer's nagging&mdash;the spying of
  Pete Yeska and the Norbloms&mdash;the inevitability of turning, as so many
  unchanging times he had turned, south from the Leopolis road at the Two Mile
  Grove and following again that weary, flat, unbending trail&mdash;the
  superiority of Dr. Hesselink and the malice of Dr. Coughlin&mdash;the round
  which left him no time for his dusty laboratory&mdash;leaving it all for the
  achievement and splendor of the great city of Nautilus.</p>

  <p>"Leora, we're going! We're really going!"</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">Bert Tozer said:</p>

  <p>"You know by golly there's folks that would call you a traitor, after all
  we've done for you, even if you did pay back the thousand, to let some other
  doc come in here and get all that influence away from the Family."</p>

  <p>Ada Quist said:</p>

  <p>"I guess if you ain't any too popular with the folks around here you'll
  have one fine time in a big city like Nautilus! Well Bert and me are going to
  get married next year and when you two swells make a failure of it I suppose
  we'll have to take care of you at our house when you come sneaking back do
  you think we could get your house at the same rent you paid for it oh Bert
  why couldn't we take Mart's office instead it would save money well I've
  always said since we were in school together you couldn't stand a decent
  regular life Ory."</p>

  <p>Mr. Tozer said:</p>

  <p>"I simply can't understand it, with everything going so nice. Why, you'd
  be making three-four thousand a year some day, if you just stuck to it.
  Haven't we tried to treat you nice? I don't like to have my little girl go
  away and leave me alone, now I'm getting on in years. And Bert gets so cranky
  with me and Mother, but you and Ory would always kind of listen to us. Can't
  you fix it somehow so you could stay?"</p>

  <p>Pete Yeska said:</p>

  <p>"Doc, you could of knocked me down with a feather when I heard you were
  going! Course you and me have scrapped about this drug business, but Lord! I
  been kind of half thinking about coming around some time and offering you a
  partnership and let you run the drug end to suit yourself, and we could get
  the Buick agency, maybe, and work up a nice little business. I'm real sorry
  you're going to leave us...Well, come back some day and we'll take a shot at
  the ducks, and have a good laugh about that bull you made over the smallpox.
  I never will forget that! I was saying to the old woman just the other day,
  when she had an ear-ache, 'Ain't got smallpox, have yuh, Bess!'"</p>

  <p>Dr. Hesselink said:</p>

  <p>"Doctor, what's this I hear? You're not going away? Why, you and I were
  just beginning to bring medical practice in this neck of the woods up to
  where it ought to be, so I drove over tonight&mdash;Huh? We panned you?
  Ye-es, I suppose we did, but that doesn't mean we didn't appreciate you.
  Small place like here or Groningen, you have to roast your neighbors to keep
  busy. Why, Doctor, I've been watching you develop from an unlicked cub to a
  real upstanding physician, and now you're going away&mdash;you don't know how
  I feel!"</p>

  <p>Henry Novak said:</p>

  <p>"Why, Doc, you ain't going to <i>leave</i> us? And we got a new baby
  coming, and I said to the woman, just the other day, 'It's a good thing we
  got a doctor that hands you out the truth and not all this guff we used to
  get from Doc Winter.'"</p>

  <p>The wheat-buyer at Delft said:</p>

  <p>"Doc, what's this I hear? You ain't going <i>away?</i> A fellow told me
  you was and I says to him, 'Don't be more of a damn' fool than the Lord meant
  you to be,' I says. But I got to worrying about it, and I drove over
  and&mdash;Doc, I fire off my mouth pretty easy, I guess. I was agin you in
  the typhoid epidemic, when you said that seamstress was carrying the sickness
  around, and then you showed me up good. Doc, if you'd like to be state
  senator, and if you'll stay&mdash;I got quite a little
  influence&mdash;believe me, I'll get out and work my shirt off for you!"</p>

  <p>Alec Ingleblad said:</p>

  <p>"You're a lucky guy!"</p>

  <p>All the village was at the train when they left for Nautilus.</p>

  <p>For a hundred autumn-blazing miles Martin mourned his neighbors. "I feel
  like getting off and going back. Didn't we used to have fun playing Five
  Hundred with the Fraziers! I hate to think of the kind of doctor they may
  get. I swear, if some quack settles there or if Woestijne neglects the health
  work again, I'll go back and run 'em both out of business! And be kind of fun
  to be state senator, some ways."</p>

  <p>But as evening thickened and nothing in all the rushing world existed save
  the yellow Pintsch gas globes above them in the long car, they saw ahead of
  them great Nautilus, high honor and achievement, the making of a radiant
  model city and the praise of Sondelius&mdash;perhaps even of Max
  Gottlieb.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">Midmost of the black-soiled Iowa plain, watered only by a
  shallow and insignificant creek, the city of Nautilus bakes and rattles and
  glistens. For hundreds of miles the tall corn springs in a jungle of
  undeviating rows, and the stranger who sweatily trudges the corn-walled roads
  is lost and nervous with the sense of merciless growth.</p>

  <p>Nautilus is to Zenith what Zenith is to Chicago.</p>

  <p>With seventy thousand people, it is a smaller Zenith but no less brisk.
  There is one large hotel to compare with the dozen in Zenith, but that one is
  as busy and standardized and frenziedly modern as its owner can make it. The
  only authentic difference between Nautilus and Zenith is that in both cases
  all the streets look alike but in Nautilus they do not look alike for so many
  miles.</p>

  <p>The difficulty in defining its quality is that no one has determined
  whether it is a very large village or a very small city. There are houses
  with chauffeurs and Bacardi cocktails, but on August evenings all save a few
  score burghers sit in their shirt-sleeves on front porches. Across from the
  ten-story office building, in which a little magazine of the New Prose is
  published by a young woman who for five months lived in the cafes of
  Montparnasse, is an old frame mansion comfortable with maples, and a line of
  Fords and lumber-wagons in which the overalled farmers have come to town.</p>

  <p>Iowa has the richest land, the lowest illiteracy rate, the largest
  percentages of native-born whites and motor-car owners, and the most moral
  and forward-looking cities of all the States, and Nautilus is the most Iowan
  city in Iowa. One out of every three persons above the age of sixty has spent
  a winter in California, and among them are the champion horseshoe pitcher of
  Pasadena and the woman who presented the turkey which Miss Mary Pickford, the
  cinema princess, enjoyed at her Christmas dinner in 1912.</p>

  <p>Nautilus is distinguished by large houses with large lawns and by an
  astounding quantity of garages and lofty church spires. The fat fields run up
  to the edge of the city, and the scattered factories, the innumerable
  railroad side-tracks, and the scraggly cottages for workmen are almost amid
  the corn. Nautilus manufactures steel windmills, agricultural implements,
  including the celebrated Daisy Manure Spreader, and such corn-products as
  Maize Mealies, the renowned breakfast-food. It makes brick, it sells
  groceries wholesale, and it is the headquarters of the Cornbelt Co-operative
  Insurance Company.</p>

  <p>One of its smallest but oldest industries is Mugford Christian College,
  which has two hundred and seventeen students, and sixteen instructors, of
  whom eleven are ministers of the Church of Christ. The well-known Dr. Tom
  Bissex is football coach, health director, and professor of hygiene,
  chemistry, physics, French, and German. Its shorthand and piano departments
  are known far beyond the limits of Nautilus, and once, though that was some
  years ago, Mugford held the Grinnell College baseball team down to a score of
  eleven to five. It has never been disgraced by squabbles over teaching
  evolutionary biology&mdash;it never has thought of teaching biology at
  all.</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">Martin left Leora at the Sims House, the old-fashioned,
  second-best hotel in Nautilus, to report to Dr. Pickerbaugh, Director of the
  Department of Public Health.</p>

  <p>The department was on an alley, in a semi-basement at the back of that
  large graystone fungus, the City Hall. When he entered the drab
  reception-office he was highly received by the stenographer and the two
  visiting nurses. Into the midst of their flutterings&mdash;"Did you have a
  good trip, Doctor? Dr. Pickerbaugh didn't hardly expect you till tomorrow,
  Doctor. Is Mrs. Arrowsmith with you, Doctor?"&mdash;charged Pickerbaugh,
  thundering welcomes.</p>

  <p>Dr. Almus Pickerbaugh was forty-eight. He was a graduate of Mugford
  College and of the Wassau Medical School. He looked somewhat like President
  Roosevelt, with the same squareness and the same bristly mustache, and he
  cultivated the resemblance. He was a man who never merely talked: he either
  bubbled or made orations.</p>

  <p>He received Martin with four "Well's," which he gave after the manner of a
  college cheer; he showed him through the Department, led him into the
  Director's private office, gave him a cigar, and burst the dam of manly
  silence:</p>

  <p>"Doctor, I'm delighted to have a man with your scientific inclinations.
  Not that I should consider myself entirely without them. In fact I make it a
  regular practice to set aside a period for scientific research, without a
  certain amount of which even the most ardent crusade for health methods would
  scarcely make much headway."</p>

  <p>It sounded like the beginning of a long seminar. Martin settled in his
  chair. He was doubtful about his cigar, but he found that it helped him to
  look more interested.</p>

  <p>"But with me, I admit, it's a matter of temperament. I have often hoped
  that, without any desire whatever for mere personal aggrandizement, the
  powers above may yet grant me the genius to become at once the Roosevelt and
  the Longfellow of the great and universally growing movement for public
  health measures is your cigar too mild, Doctor? or perhaps it would be better
  to say the Kipling of public health rather than the Longfellow, because
  despite the beautiful passages and high moral atmosphere of the Sage of
  Cambridge, his poetry lacked the swing and punch of Kipling.</p>

  <p>"I assume you agree with me, or you will when you have had an opportunity
  to see the effect our work has on the city, and the success we have in
  selling the idea of Better Health, that what the world needs is a really
  inspired, courageous, overtowering leader&mdash;say a Billy Sunday of the
  movement&mdash;a man who would know how to use sensationalism properly and
  wake the people out of their sloth. Sometimes the papers, and I can only say
  they flatter me when they compare me with Billy Sunday, the greatest of all
  evangelists and Christian preachers&mdash;sometimes they claim that I'm too
  sensational. Huh! If they only could understand it, trouble is I can't be
  sensational enough! Still, I try, I try, and&mdash;Look here. Here's a
  placard, it was painted by my daughter Orchid and the poetry is my own humble
  effort, and let me tell you it gets quoted around everywhere:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">You can't get health<br>
  By a pussyfoot stealth,<br>
  So let's every health-booster<br>
  Crow just like a rooster.</p><br>

  <p>"Then there's another&mdash;this is a minor thing; it doesn't try to drive
  home general abstract principles, but it'd surprise you the effect it's had
  on careless housewives, who of course don't mean to neglect the health of
  their little ones and merely need instruction and a little pep put into them,
  and when they see a card like this, it makes 'em think:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">Boil the milk bottles or by gum<br>
  You better buy your ticket to Kingdom Come.</p><br>

  <p>"I've gotten quite a lot of appreciation in my small way for some of these
  things that didn't hardly take me five minutes to dash off. Some day when you
  get time, glance over this volume of clippings&mdash;just to show you,
  Doctor, what you can do if you go at the Movement in the up-to-date and
  scientific manner. This one, about the temperance meeting I addressed in Des
  Moines&mdash;say, I had that hall, and it was jam-pack-full, lifting right up
  on their feet when I proved by statistics that ninety-three per cent of all
  insanity is caused by booze! Then this&mdash;well, it hasn't anything to do
  with health, directly, but it'll just indicate the opportunity you'll have
  here to get in touch with all the movements for civic weal."</p>

  <p>He held out a newspaper clipping in which, above a pen-and-ink caricature
  portraying him with large mustached head on a tiny body, was the
  headline:</p><br>

  <p class="headline">DOC PICKERBAUGH BANNER BOOSTER<br>
  OF EVANGELINE COUNTY LEADS BIG<br>
  GO-TO-CHURCH DEMONSTRATION HERE</p><br>

  <p>Pickerbaugh looked it over, reflecting, "That was a dandy meeting! We
  increased church attendance here seventeen per cent! Oh, Doctor, you went to
  Winnemac and had your internship in Zenith, didn't you? Well, this might
  interest you then. It's from the Zenith Advocate-Times, and it's by Chum
  Frink, who, I think you'll agree with me, ranks with Eddie Guest and Walt
  Mason as the greatest, as they certainly are the most popular, of all our
  poets, showing that you can bank every time on the literary taste of the
  American Public. Dear old Chum! That was when I was in Zenith to address the
  national convention of Congregational Sunday-schools, I happen to be a
  Congregationalist myself, on 'The Morality of A1 Health.' So Chum wrote this
  poem about me:"</p><br>

  <p class="verse">Zenith welcomes with high hurraw<br>
  A friend in Almus Pickerbaugh,<br>
  The two-fisted fightin' poet doc<br>
  Who stands for health like Gibraltar's rock.<br>
  He's jammed with figgers and facts and fun,<br>
  The plucky old, lucky old son&mdash;of&mdash;a&mdash;gun!</p><br>

  <p>For a moment the exuberant Dr. Pickerbaugh was shy.</p>

  <p>"Maybe it's kind of immodest in me to show that around. And when I read a
  poem with such originality and swing, when I find a genu-ine vest-pocket
  masterpiece like this, then I realize that I'm not a poet at all, no matter
  how much my jingles may serve to jazz up the Cause of Health. My
  brainchildren may teach sanitation and do their little part to save thousands
  of dear lives, but they aren't literature, like what Chum Frink turns out.
  No, I guess I'm nothing but just a plain scientist in an office.</p>

  <p>"Still you'll readily see how one of these efforts of mine, just by having
  a good laugh and a punch and some melody in it, does gild the pill and make
  careless folks stop spitting on the sidewalks, and get out into God's great
  outdoors and get their lungs packed full of ozone and lead a real
  hairy-chested he-life. In fact you might care to look over the first number
  of a little semi-yearly magazine I'm just starting&mdash;I know for a fact
  that a number of newspaper editors are going to quote from it and so carry on
  the good work as well as boost my circulation."</p>

  <p>He handed to Martin a pamphlet entitled Pickerbaugh Pickings.</p>

  <p>In verse and aphorism, Pickings recommended good health, good roads, good
  business, and the single standard of morality. Dr. Pickerbaugh backed up his
  injunctions with statistics as impressive as those the Reverend Ira Hinkley
  had once used at Digamma Pi. Martin was edified by an item which showed that
  among all families divorced in Ontario, Tennessee, and Southern Wyoming in
  1912, the appalling number of fifty-three per cent of the husbands drank at
  least one glass of whisky daily.</p>

  <p>Before this warning had sunk in, Pickerbaugh snatched Pickings from him
  with a boyish, "Oh, you won't want to read any more of my rot. You can look
  it over some future time. But this second volume of my clippings may perhaps
  interest you, just as a hint of what a fellow can do."</p>

  <p>While he considered the headlines in the scrapbook, Martin realized that
  Dr. Pickerbaugh was vastly better known than he had realized. He was exposed
  as the founder of the first Rotary Club in Iowa; superintendent of the
  Jonathan Edwards Congregational Sunday School of Nautilus; president of the
  Moccasin Ski and Hiking Club, of the West Side Bowling Club, and the 1912
  Bull Moose and Roosevelt Club; organizer and cheerleader of a Joint Picnic of
  the Woodmen, Moose, Elks, Masons, Odd Fellows, Turnverein, Knights of
  Columbus, B'nai Brith, and the Y.M.C.A.; and winner of the prizes both for
  reciting the largest number of Biblical texts and for dancing the best Irish
  jig at the Harvest Moon Soiree of the Jonathan Edwards Bible Class for the
  Grown-ups.</p>

  <p>Martin read of him as addressing the Century Club of Nautilus on "A Yankee
  Doctor's Trip Through Old Europe," and the Mugford College Alumni Association
  on "Wanted: A Man-sized Feetball Coach for Old Mugford." But outside of
  Nautilus as well, there were loud alarums of his presence.</p>

  <p>He had spoken at the Toledo Chamber of Commerce Weekly Luncheon on "More
  Health&mdash;More Bank Clearings." He had edified the National Interurban
  Trolley Council, meeting at Wichita, on "Health Maxims for Trolley Folks."
  Seven thousand, six hundred Detroit automobile mechanics had listened to his
  observations on "Health First, Safety Second, and Booze Nowhere A-tall." And
  in a great convention at Waterloo he had helped organize the first regiment
  in Iowa of the Anti-rum Minute Men.</p>

  <p>The articles and editorials regarding him, in newspapers, house organs,
  and one rubber-goods periodical, were accompanied by photographs of himself,
  his buxom wife, and his eight bounding daughters, depicted in Canadian winter
  costumes among snow and icicles, in modest but easy athletic costumes,
  playing tennis in the backyard, and in costumes of no known genus whatever,
  frying bacon against a background of Northern Minnesota pines.</p>

  <p>Martin felt strongly that he would like to get away and recover.</p>

  <p>He walked back to the Sims House. He realized that to a civilized man the
  fact that Pickerbaugh advocated any reform would be sufficient reason for
  ignoring it.</p>

  <p>When he had gone thus far, Martin pulled himself up, cursed himself for
  what he esteemed his old sin of superiority to decent normal
  people...Failure. Disloyalty. In medical school, in private practice, in his
  bullying health administration. Now again?</p>

  <p>He urged, "This pep and heartiness stuff of Pickerbaugh's is exactly the
  thing to get across to the majority of people the scientific discoveries of
  the Max Gottliebs. What do I care how much Pickerbaugh gases before
  conventions of Sunday School superintendents and other morons, as long as he
  lets me do my work in the lab and dairy inspection?"</p>

  <p>He pumped up enthusiasm and came quite cheerfully and confidently into the
  shabby, high-ceilinged hotel bedroom where Leora sat in a rocker by the
  window.</p>

  <p>"Well?" she said.</p>

  <p>"It's fine&mdash;gave me fine welcome. And they want us to come to dinner
  tomorrow evening."</p>

  <p>"What's he like?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, he's awfully optimistic&mdash;he puts things over&mdash;he&mdash;Oh,
  Leora, am I going to be a sour, cranky, unpopular, rotten failure again?"</p>

  <p>His head was buried in her lap and he clung to her affection, the one
  reality in a world of chattering ghosts.</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">When the maples fluttered beneath their window in the breeze
  that sprang up with the beginning of twilight, when the amiable citizens of
  Nautilus had driven home to supper in their shaky Fords, Leora had persuaded
  him that Pickerbaugh's flamboyance would not interfere with his own work,
  that in any case they would not remain in Nautilus forever, that he was
  impatient, and that she loved him dearly. So they descended to supper, an
  old-fashioned Iowa supper with corn fritters and many little dishes which
  were of interest after the loving but misinformed cooking of Leora, and they
  went to the movies and held hands and were not ill content.</p>

  <p>The next day Dr. Pickerbaugh was busier and less buoyant. He gave Martin a
  notion of the details of his work.</p>

  <p>Martin had thought of himself, freed from tinkering over cut fingers and
  ear-aches, as spending ecstatic days in the laboratory, emerging only to
  battle with factory-owners who defied sanitation. But he found that it was
  impossible to define his work, except that he was to do a little of
  everything that Pickerbaugh, the press, or any stray citizen of Nautilus
  might think of.</p>

  <p>He was to placate voluble voters who came in to complain of everything
  from the smell of sewer-gas to the midnight beer parties of neighbors; he was
  to dictate office correspondence to the touchy stenographer, who was not a
  Working Girl but a Nice Girl Who Was Working; to give publicity to the
  newspapers; to buy paper-clips and floor-wax and report-blanks at the lowest
  prices; to assist, in need, the two part-time physicians in the city clinic;
  to direct the nurses and the two sanitary inspectors; to scold the Garbage
  Removal Company; to arrest&mdash;or at least to jaw at&mdash;all public
  spitters; to leap into a Ford and rush out to tack placards on houses in
  which were infectious diseases; to keep a learned implacable eye on epidemics
  from Vladivostok to Patagonia, and to prevent (by methods not very clearly
  outlined) their coming in to slay the yeomanry and even halt the business
  activities of Nautilus.</p>

  <p>But there was a little laboratory work: milk tests, Wassermanns for
  private physicians, the making of vaccines, cultures in suspected
  diphtheria.</p>

  <p>"I get it," said Leora, as they dressed for dinner at Pickerbaugh's. "Your
  job will only take about twenty-eight hours a day, and the rest of the time
  you're perfectly welcome to spend in research, unless somebody interrupts
  you."</p><br>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">The home of Dr. and Mrs. Almus Pickerbaugh, on the
  steeple-prickly West Side, was a Real Old-Fashioned Home. It was a wooden
  house with towers, swings, hammocks, rather mussy shade trees, a rather mangy
  lawn, a rather damp arbor, and an old carriage-house with a line of steel
  spikes along the ridge pole. Over the front gate was the name:
  <i>Uneedarest</i>.</p>

  <p>Martin and Leora came into a shambles of salutations and daughters. The
  eight girls, from pretty Orchid aged nineteen to the five-year-old twins,
  surged up in a tidal wave of friendly curiosity and tried to talk all at
  once.</p>

  <p>Their hostess was a plump woman with an air of worried trustfulness. Her
  conviction that everything was all right was constantly struggling with her
  knowledge that a great many things seemed to be all wrong. She kissed Leora
  while Pickerbaugh was pump-handling Martin. Pickerbaugh had a way of pressing
  his thumb into the back of your hand which was extraordinarily cordial and
  painful.</p>

  <p>He immediately drowned out even his daughters by an oration on the Home
  Nest:</p>

  <p>"Here you've got an illustration of Health in the Home. Look at these
  great strapping girls, Arrowsmith! Never been sick a day in their
  lives&mdash;practically&mdash;and though Mother does have her sick-headaches,
  that's to be attributed to the early neglect of her diet, because while her
  father, the old deacon&mdash;and a fine upstanding gentleman of the old
  school he was, too, if there ever was one, and a friend of Nathaniel Mugford,
  to whom more than any other we owe not only the foundation of Mugford College
  but also the tradition of integrity and industry which have produced our
  present prosperity&mdash;<i>but</i> he had no knowledge of diet or
  sanitation, and I've always thought&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The daughters were introduced as Orchid, Verbena, Daisy, Jonquil, Hibisca,
  Narcissa, and the twins, Arbuta and Gladiola.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Pickerbaugh sighed:</p>

  <p>"I suppose it would be dreadfully conventional to call them My
  Jewels&mdash;I do so hate these conventional phrases that everybody uses,
  don't you?&mdash;but that's what they really are to their mother, and the
  Doctor and I have sometimes wished&mdash;Of course when we'd started giving
  them floral names we had to keep it up, but if we'd started with jewels, just
  think of all the darling names we might have used, like Agate and Cameo and
  Sardonyx and Beryl and Topaz and Opal and Esmeralda and Chrysoprase&mdash;it
  <i>is</i> Chrysoprase, isn't it, not Chrysalis? Oh, well, many people have
  congratulated us on their names as it is. You know the girls are getting
  quite famous&mdash;their pictures in so many papers, and we have a
  Pickerbaugh Ladies' Baseball Team all our own&mdash;only the Doctor has to
  play on it now, because I'm beginning to get a little stout."</p>

  <p>Except by their ages, it was impossible to tell the daughters apart. They
  were all bouncing, all blond, all pretty, all eager, all musical, and not
  merely pure but clamorously clean-minded. They all belonged to the
  Congregational Sunday School, and to either the Y.W.C.A. or the Camp Fire
  Girls; they were all fond of picnicking; and they could all of them, except
  the five-year-old twins, quote practically without error the newest
  statistics showing the evils of alcohol.</p>

  <p>"In fact," said Dr. Pickerbaugh, "<i>we</i> think they're a very striking
  brood of chickabiddies."</p>

  <p>"They certainly are!" quivered Martin.</p>

  <p>"But best of all, they are able to help me put over the doctrine of the
  Mens Sana in the Corpus Sano. Mrs. Pickerbaugh and I have trained them to
  sing together, both in the home and publicly, and as an organization we call
  them the Healthette Octette."</p>

  <p>"Really?" said Leora, when it was apparent that Martin had passed beyond
  speech.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and before I get through with it I hope to popularize the name
  Healthette from end to end of this old nation, and you're going to see bands
  of happy young women going around spreading their winged message into every
  dark corner. Healthette Bands! Beautiful and pure-minded and enthusiastic and
  good basket-ball players! I tell you, <i>they'll</i> make the lazy and
  willful stir their stumps! They'll shame the filthy livers and filthy talkers
  into decency! I've already worked out a poem-slogan for the Healthette Bands.
  Would you like to hear it?"</p><br>

  <p class="verse">Winsome young womanhood wins with a smile<br>
  Boozers, spitters, and gamblers from things that are vile.<br>
  Our parents and teachers have explained the cause of life,<br>
  So against the evil-minded we'll also make strife.<br>
  We'll shame them, reclaim them, from bad habits, you bet!<br>
  Better watch out, Mr. Loafer, I am a Healthette!</p><br>

  <p>"But of course an even more important Cause is&mdash;and I was one of the
  first to advocate it&mdash;having a Secretary of Health and Eugenics in the
  cabinet at Washington&mdash;"</p>

  <p>On the tide of this dissertation they were swept through a stupendous
  dinner. With a hearty "Nonsense, nonsense, man, of course you want a second
  helping&mdash;this is Hospitality Hall!" Pickerbaugh so stuffed Martin and
  Leora with roast duck, candied sweet potatoes, and mince pie that they became
  dangerously ill and sat glassy-eyed. But Pickerbaugh himself did not seem to
  be affected. While he carved and gobbled, he went on discoursing till the
  dining-room, with its old walnut buffet, its Hoffmann pictures of Christ, and
  its Remington pictures of cowpunchers, seemed to vanish, leaving him on a
  platform beside a pitcher of ice-water.</p>

  <p>Not always was he merely fantastic. "Dr. Arrowsmith, I tell you we're
  lucky men to be able to get a living out of doing our honest best to make the
  people in a he-town like this well and vital. I could be pulling down eight
  or ten thousand a year in private practice, and I've been told I could make
  more than that in the art of advertising, yet I'm glad, and my dear ones are
  glad with me, to take a salary of four thousand. Think of our having a job
  where we've got nothing to sell but honesty and decency and the brotherhood
  o' man!"</p>

  <p>Martin perceived that Pickerbaugh meant it, and the shame of the
  realization kept him from leaping up, seizing Leora, and catching the first
  freight train out of Nautilus.</p>

  <p>After dinner the younger daughters desired to love Leora, in swarms.
  Martin had to take the twins on his knees and tell them a story. They were
  remarkably heavy twins, but no heavier than the labor of inventing a plot.
  Before they went to bed, the entire Healthette Octette sang the famous Health
  Hymn (written by Dr. Almus Pickerbaugh) which Martin was to hear on so many
  bright and active public occasions in Nautilus. It was set to the tune of
  "The Battle Hymn of the Republic," but as the twins' voices were energetic
  and extraordinarily shrill, it had an effect all its own:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">Oh, are you out for happiness or are you out for pelf?<br>
  You owe it to the grand old flag to cultivate yourself,<br>
  To train the mind, keep clean the streets, and ever guard your
  health.</p><br>

  <p>Then we'll all go marching on.</p><br>

  <p class="verse">A healthy mind in A clean body,<br>
  A healthy mind in A clean body,<br>
  A healthy mind in A clean body,<br>
  The slogan for one and all.</p><br>

  <p>As a bedtime farewell, the twins then recited, as they had recently at the
  Congregational Festival, one of their father's minor lyrics:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">What does little birdie say<br>
  On the sill at break o' day?<br>
  "Hurrah for health in Nautilus<br>
  For Pa and Ma and all of us,<br>
  Hurray, hurray, hurray!"</p><br>

  <p>"There, my popsywopsies, up to bed we go!" said Mrs. Pickerbaugh. "Don't
  you think, Mrs. Arrowsmith, they're natural-born actresses? They're not
  afraid of any audience, and the way they throw themselves into
  it&mdash;perhaps not Broadway, but the more refined theaters in New York
  would just love them, and maybe they've been sent to us to elevate the drama.
  Upsy go."</p>

  <p>During her absence the others gave a brief musical program.</p>

  <p>Verbena, the second oldest, played Chaminade. ("Of course we all love
  music, and popularize it among the neighbors, but Verby is perhaps the only
  real musical genius in the family.") But the unexpected feature was Orchid's
  cornet solo.</p>

  <p>Martin dared not look at Leora. It was not that he was sniffily superior
  to cornet solos, for in Elk Mills, Wheatsylvania, and surprisingly large
  portions of Zenith, cornet solos were done by the most virtuous females. But
  he felt that he had been in a madhouse for dozens of years.</p>

  <p>"I've never been so drunk in my life. I wish I could get at a drink and
  sober up," he agonized. He made hysterical and completely impractical plans
  for escape. Then Mrs. Pickerbaugh, returning from the still audible twins,
  sat down at the harp.</p>

  <p>While she played, a faded woman and thickish, she fell into a great
  dreaming, and suddenly Martin had a picture of her as a gay, good, dove-like
  maiden who had admired the energetic young medical student, Almus
  Pickerbaugh. She must have been a veritable girl of the late eighties and the
  early nineties, the naive and idyllic age of Howells, when young men were
  pure, when they played croquet and sang Swanee River; a girl who sat on a
  front porch enchanted by the sweetness of lilacs, and hoped that when Almus
  and she were married they would have a nickel-plated baseburner stove and a
  son who would become a missionary or a millionaire.</p>

  <p>For the first time that evening, Martin managed to put a respectable
  heartiness into his "Enjoyed that s' much." He felt victorious, and somewhat
  recovered from his weakness. But the evening's orgy was only begun.</p>

  <p>They played word-games, which Martin hated and Leora did very badly
  indeed. They acted charades, at which Pickerbaugh was tremendous. The sight
  of him on the floor in his wife's fur coat, being a seal on an ice-floe, was
  incomparable. Then Martin, Orchid, and Hibisca (aged twelve) had to present a
  charade, and there were complications.</p>

  <p>Orchid was as full of simple affections, of smilings and pattings and
  bouncings, as her younger sisters, but she was nineteen and not altogether a
  child. Doubtless she was as pure-minded and as devoted to Clean and Wholesome
  Novels as Dr. Pickerbaugh stated, and he stated it with frequency, but she
  was not unconscious of young men, even though they were married.</p>

  <p>She planned to enact the word doleful, with a beggar asking a dole, and a
  corncrib full. As they skipped upstairs to dress, she hugged Martin's arm,
  frisked beside him, and murmured, "Oh, Doctor, I'm so glad Daddy has you for
  assistant&mdash;somebody that's young and good-looking. Oh, was that dreadful
  of me? But I mean: you look so athletic and everything, and the other
  assistant director&mdash;don't tell Daddy I said so, but he was an old
  crank!"</p>

  <p>He was conscious of brown eyes and unshadowed virginal lips. As Orchid put
  on her agreeably loose costume as a beggar, he was also conscious of ankles
  and young bosom. She smiled at him, as one who had long known him, and said
  loyally, "We'll show 'em! I know you're a dan-dy actor!"</p>

  <p>When they bustled downstairs, as she did not take his arm, he took hers,
  and he pressed it slightly and felt alarmed and relinquished it with
  emphasis.</p>

  <p>Since his marriage he had been so absorbed in Leora, as lover, as
  companion, as helper, that till this hour his most devastating adventure had
  been a glance at a pretty girl in a train. But the flushed young gaiety of
  Orchid disturbed him. He wanted to be rid of her, he hoped that he would not
  be altogether rid of her, and for the first time in years he was afraid of
  Leora's eyes.</p>

  <p>There were acrobatic feats later, and a considerable prominence of Orchid,
  who did not wear stays, who loved dancing, and who praised Martin's feats in
  the game of "Follow the Leader."</p>

  <p>All the daughters save Orchid were sent to bed, and the rest of the fete
  consisted of what Pickerbaugh called "a little quiet scientific conversation
  by the fireside," made up of his observations on good roads, rural
  sanitation, Ideals in politics, and methods of letter filing in health
  departments. Through this placid hour, or it may have been an hour and a
  half, Martin saw that Orchid was observing his hair, his jaw, his hands, and
  he had, and dismissed, and had again a thought about the innocent
  agreeableness of holding her small friendly paw.</p>

  <p>He also saw that Leora was observing both of them, and he suffered a good
  deal, and had practically no benefit whatever from Pickerbaugh's notes on the
  value of disinfectants. When Pickerbaugh predicted for Nautilus, in fifteen
  years, a health department thrice as large, with many full-time clinic and
  school physicians and possibly Martin as director (Pickerbaugh himself having
  gone off to mysterious and interesting activities in a Larger Field), Martin
  merely croaked, "Yes, that'd be&mdash;be fine," while to himself he was
  explaining, "Damn that girl, I wish she wouldn't shake herself at me."</p>

  <p>At half-past eight he had pictured his escape as life's highest ecstasy;
  at twelve he took leave with nervous hesitation.</p>

  <p>They walked to the hotel. Free from the sight of Orchid, brisk in the
  coolness, he forgot the chit and pawed again the problem of his work in
  Nautilus.</p>

  <p>"Lord, I don't know whether I can do it. To work under that gas-bag, with
  his fool pieces about boozers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They weren't so bad," protested Leora.</p>

  <p>"Bad? Why, he's probably the worst poet that ever lived, and he certainly
  knows less about epidemiology than I thought any one man could ever learn,
  all by himself. But when it comes to this&mdash;what was it Clif Clawson used
  to call it?&mdash;by the way, wonder what's ever become of Clif; haven't
  heard from him for a couple o' years&mdash;when it comes to this
  'overpowering Christian Domesticity'&mdash;Oh, let's hunt for a blind-pig and
  sit around with the nice restful burglars."</p>

  <p>She insisted, "I thought his poems were kind of cute."</p>

  <p>"Cute! What a word!"</p>

  <p>"It's no worse than the cuss-words you're always using! But the cornet
  yowling by that awful oldest daughter&mdash;Ugh!"</p>

  <p>"Well, now she played darn' well!"</p>

  <p>"Martin, the cornet is the kind of instrument my brother would play. And
  you so superior about the doctor's poetry and my saying 'cute'! You're just
  as much a backwoods hick as I am, and maybe more so!"</p>

  <p>"Why, gee, Leora, I never knew you to get sore about nothing before! And
  can't you understand how important&mdash;You see, a man like Pickerbaugh
  makes all public health work simply ridiculous by his circusing and his
  ignorance. If he said that fresh air was a good thing, instead of making me
  open my windows it'd make me or any other reasonable person close 'em. And to
  use the word 'science' in those flop-eared limericks or whatever you call
  'em&mdash;it's sacrilege!"</p>

  <p>"Well, if you want to <i>know</i>, Martin Arrowsmith, I'll have no more of
  these high jinks with that Orchid girl! Practically hugging her when you came
  downstairs, and then mooning at her all evening! I don't mind your cursing
  and being cranky and even getting drunk, in a reasonable sort of way, but
  ever since the lunch when you told me and that Fox woman, 'I hope you girls
  won't mind, but I just happen to remember that I'm engaged to both of
  you'&mdash;You're mine, and I won't have any trespassers. I'm a cavewoman,
  and you'd better learn it, and as for that Orchid, with her simper and her
  stroking your arm and her great big absurd feet&mdash;Orchid! She's no
  orchid! She's a bachelor's button!"</p>

  <p>"But, honest, I don't even remember which of the eight she was."</p>

  <p>"Huh! Then you've been making love to all of 'em, that's why. Drat her!
  Well, I'm not going to go on scrapping about it. I just wanted to warn you,
  that's all."</p>

  <p>At the hotel, after giving up the attempt to find a short, jovial,
  convincing way of promising that he would never flirt with Orchid, he
  stammered, "If you don't mind, I think I'll stay down and walk a little more.
  I've got to figure this health department business out."</p>

  <p>He sat in the Sims House office&mdash;singularly dismal it was, after
  midnight, and singularly smelly.</p>

  <p>"That fool Pickerbaugh! I wish I'd told him right out that we know hardly
  anything about the epidemiology of tuberculosis, for instance.</p>

  <p>"Just the same, she's a darling child. Orchid! She's like an
  orchid&mdash;no, she's too healthy. Be a great kid to go hunting with. Sweet.
  And she acted as if I were her own age, not an old doctor. I'll be good, oh,
  I'll be good, but&mdash;I'd like to kiss her once, <i>good!</i> She likes me.
  Those darling lips, like&mdash;like rosebuds!</p>

  <p>"Poor Leora. I nev' was so astonished in my life. Jealous. Well, she's got
  a right to be! No woman ever stood by a man like&mdash;Lee, sweet, can't you
  see, idiot, if I skipped round the corner with seventeen billion Orchids,
  it'd be you I loved, and never anybody but you!</p>

  <p>"I can't go round singing Healthette Octette Pantalette stuff. Even if it
  did instruct people, which it don't. Be almost better to let 'em die than
  have to live and listen to&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Leora said I was a 'backwoods hick.' Let me tell you, young woman, as it
  happens I am a Bachelor of Arts, and you may recall the kind of books the
  'backwoods hick' was reading to you last winter, and even Henry James and
  everybody and&mdash;Oh, she's right. I am. I do know how to make pipets and
  agar, but&mdash;And yet some day I want to travel like Sondelius&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Sondelius! God! If it were he I was working for, instead of Pickerbaugh,
  I'd slave for him&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Or does he pull the bunk, too?</p>

  <p>"Now that's just what I mean. That kind of phrase. 'Pull the bunk'!
  Horrible!</p>

  <p>"Hell! I'll use any kind of phrase I want to! I'm not one of your social
  climbers like Angus. The way Sondelius cusses, for instance, and yet he's
  used to all those highbrows&mdash;</p>

  <p>"And I'll be so busy here in Nautilus that I won't even be able to go on
  reading. Still&mdash;I don't suppose they read much, but there must be quite
  a few of these rich men here that know about nice houses. Clothes. Theaters.
  That stuff.</p>

  <p>"Rats!"</p>

  <p>He wandered to an all-night lunch-wagon, where he gloomily drank coffee.
  Beside him, seated at the long shelf which served as table, beneath the noble
  red-glass window with a portrait of George Washington, was a policeman who,
  as he gnawed a Hamburger sandwich, demanded:</p>

  <p>"Say, ain't you this new doctor that's come to assist Pickerbaugh? Seen
  you at City Hall."</p>

  <p>"Yes. Say, uh, say, how does the city like Pickerbaugh? How do you like
  him? Tell me honestly, because I'm just starting in, and, uh&mdash;You get
  me."</p>

  <p>With his spoon held inside the cup by a brawny thumb, the policeman gulped
  his coffee and proclaimed, while the greasy friendly cook of the lunch-wagon
  nodded in agreement:</p>

  <p>"Well, if you want the straight dope, he hollers a good deal, but he's one
  awful brainy man. He certainly can sling the Queen's English, and jever hear
  one of his poems? They're darn' bright. I'll tell you: There's some people
  say Pickerbaugh pulls the song and dance too much, but way I figure it,
  course maybe for you and me, Doctor, it'd be all right if he just looked
  after the milk and the garbage and the kids' teeth. But there's a lot of
  careless, ignorant, foreign slobs that need to be jollied into using their
  konks about these health biznai, so's they won't go getting sick with a lot
  of these infectious diseases and pass 'em on to the rest of us, and believe
  me, old Doc Pickerbaugh is the boy that gets the idea into their noodles!</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, he's a great old coot&mdash;he ain't a clam like some of these
  docs. Why, say, one day he showed up at the St. Patrick picnic, even if he is
  a dirty Protestant, and him and Father Costello chummed up like two old
  cronies, and darn' if he didn't wrestle a fellow half his age, and awful'
  near throw him, yes, you bet he did, he certainly give that young fellow a
  run for his money all right! We fellows on the Force all like him, and we
  have to grin, the way he comes around and soft-soaps us into doing a lot of
  health work that by law we ain't hardly supposed to do, you might say,
  instead of issuing a lot of fool orders. You bet. He's a real guy."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Martin, and as he returned to the hotel he meditated:</p>

  <p>"But think of what Gottlieb would say about him.</p>

  <p>"Damn Gottlieb! Damn everybody except Leora!</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to fail here, way I did in Wheatsylvania.</p>

  <p>"Some day Pickerbaugh will get a bigger job&mdash;Huh! He's just the kind
  of jollying fourflusher that <i>would</i> climb! But anyway, I'll have my
  training then, and maybe I'll make a real health department here.</p>

  <p>"Orchid said we'd go skating this winter&mdash;</p>

  <p>"<i>Damn</i> Orchid!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20">CHAPTER XX.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">Martin found in Dr. Pickerbaugh a generous chief. He was
  eager to have Martin invent and clamor about his own Causes and Movements.
  His scientific knowledge was rather thinner than that of the visiting nurses,
  but he had little jealousy, and he demanded of Martin only the belief that a
  rapid and noisy moving from place to place is the means (and possibly the
  end) of Progress.</p>

  <p>In a two-family house on Social Hill, which is not a hill but a slight
  swelling in the plain, Martin and Leora found an upper floor. There was a
  simple pleasantness in these continuous lawns, these wide maple-shaded
  streets, and a joy in freedom from the peering whispers of Wheatsylvania.</p>

  <p>Suddenly they were being courted by the Nice Society of Nautilus.</p>

  <p>A few days after their arrival Martin was summoned to the telephone to
  hear a masculine voice rasping:</p>

  <p>"Hello. Martin? I bet you can't guess who this is!"</p>

  <p>Martin, very busy, restrained his desire to observe, "You win&mdash;g'
  by!" and he buzzed, with the cordiality suitable to a new Assistant
  Director:</p>

  <p>"No, I'm afraid I can't."</p>

  <p>"Well, make a guess."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;Clif Clawson?"</p>

  <p>"Nope. Say, I see you're looking fine. Oh, I guess I've got you guessing
  this time! Go on! Have another try!"</p>

  <p>The stenographer was waiting to take letters, and Martin had not yet
  learned to become impersonal and indifferent in her presence. He said with a
  perceptible tartness:</p>

  <p>"Oh, I suppose it's President Wilson. Look here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, Mart, it's Irve Watters! What do you know about that!"</p>

  <p>Apparently the jester expected large gratification, but it took ten
  seconds for Martin to remember who Irving Watters might be. Then he had it:
  Watters, the appalling normal medical student whose faith in the good, the
  true, the profitable, had annoyed him at Digamma Pi. He made his response as
  hearty as he could:</p>

  <p>"Well, well, what you doing here, Irve?"</p>

  <p>"Why, I'm settled here. Been here ever since internship. And got a nice
  little practice, too. Look, Mart, Mrs. Watters and I want you and your
  wife&mdash;I believe you are married, aren't you?&mdash;to come up to the
  house for dinner, tomorrow evening, and I'll put you onto all the local
  slants."</p>

  <p>The dread of Watters's patronage enabled Martin to lie vigorously:</p>

  <p>"Awfully sorry&mdash;awfully sorry&mdash;got a date for tomorrow evening
  and the next evening."</p>

  <p>"Then come have lunch with me tomorrow at the Elks' Club, and you and your
  wife take dinner with us Sunday noon."</p>

  <p>Hopelessly, "I don't think I can make it for lunch but&mdash;Well, we'll
  dine with you Sunday."</p>

  <p>It is one of the major tragedies that nothing is more discomforting than
  the hearty affection of the Old Friends who never were friends. Martin's
  imaginative dismay at being caught here by Watters was not lessened when
  Leora and he reluctantly appeared on Sunday at one-thirty and were by a fury
  of Old Friendship dragged back into the days of Digamma Pi.</p>

  <p>Watters's house was new, and furnished in a highly built-in and
  leaded-glass manner. He had in three years of practice already become
  didactic and incredibly married; he had put on weight and infallibility; and
  he had learned many new things about which to be dull. Having been graduated
  a year earlier than Martin and having married an almost rich wife, he was
  kind and hospitable with an emphasis which aroused a desire to do homicide.
  His conversation was a series of maxims and admonitions:</p>

  <p>"If you stay with the Department of Public Health for a couple of years
  and take care to meet the right people, you'll be able to go into very
  lucrative practice here. It's a fine town&mdash;prosperous&mdash;so few dead
  beats.</p>

  <p>"You want to join the country club and take up golf. Best opportunity in
  the world to meet the substantial citizens. I've picked up more than one
  high-class patient there.</p>

  <p>"Pickerbaugh is a good active man and a fine booster but he's got a bad
  socialistic tendency. These clinics&mdash;outrageous&mdash;the people that go
  to them that can afford to pay! Pauperize people. Now this may startle
  you&mdash;oh, you had a lot of crank notions when you were in school, but you
  aren't the only one that does some thinking for himself!&mdash;sometimes I
  believe it'd be better for the general health situation if there weren't any
  public health departments at all, because they get a lot of people into the
  habit of going to free clinics instead of to private physicians, and cut down
  the earnings of the doctors and reduce their number, so there are less of us
  to keep a watchful eye on sickness.</p>

  <p>"I guess by this time you've gotten over the funny ideas you used to have
  about being practical&mdash;'commercialism' you used to call it. You can see
  now that you've got to support your wife and family, and if you don't, nobody
  else is going to.</p>

  <p>"Any time you want a straight tip about people here, you just come to me.
  Pickerbaugh is a crank&mdash;he won't give you the right dope&mdash;the
  people you want to tie up with are the good, solid, conservative, successful
  business men."</p>

  <p>Then Mrs. Watters had her turn. She was meaty with advice, being the
  daughter of a prosperous person, none other than Mr. S. A. Peaseley, the
  manufacturer of the Daisy Manure Spreader.</p>

  <p>"You haven't any children?" she sobbed at Leora. "Oh, you must! Irving and
  I have two, and you don't know what an interest they are to us, and they keep
  us so young."</p>

  <p>Martin and Leora looked at each other pitifully.</p>

  <p>After dinner, Irving insisted on their recalling the "good times we used
  to have together at the dear old U." He took no denial. "You always want to
  make folks think you're eccentric, Mart. You pretend you haven't any college
  patriotism, but I know better&mdash;I know you're showing off&mdash;you
  admire the old place and our profs just as much as anybody. Maybe I know you
  better than you do yourself! Come on, now; let's give a long cheer and sing
  'Winnemac, Mother of Brawny Men.'"</p>

  <p>And, "Don't be silly; of course you're going to sing," said Mrs. Watters,
  as she marched to the piano, with which she dealt in a firm manner.</p>

  <p>When they had politely labored through the fried chicken and brick ice
  cream, through the maxims, gurglings and memories, Martin and Leora went
  forth and spoke in tongues:</p>

  <p>"Pickerbaugh must be a saint, if Watters roasts him. I begin to believe he
  has sense enough to come in when it rains."</p>

  <p>In their common misery they forgot that they had been agitated by a girl
  named Orchid.</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">Between Pickerbaugh and Irving Watters, Martin was drafted
  into many of the associations, clubs, lodges, and "causes" with which
  Nautilus foamed; into the Chamber of Commerce, the Moccasin Ski and Hiking
  Club, the Elks' Club, the Odd Fellows, and the Evangeline County Medical
  society. He resisted, but they said in a high hurt manner, "Why, my boy, if
  you're going to be a public official, and if you have the slightest
  appreciation of their efforts to make you welcome here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Leora and he found themselves with so many invitations that they, who had
  deplored the dullness of Wheatsylvania, complained now that they could have
  no quiet evenings at home. But they fell into the habit of social ease, of
  dressing, of going places without nervous anticipation. They modernized their
  rustic dancing; they learned to play bridge, rather badly, and tennis rather
  well; and Martin, not by virtue and heroism but merely by habit, got out of
  the way of resenting the chirp of small talk.</p>

  <p>Probably they were never recognized by their hostesses as pirates, but
  considered a Bright Young Couple who, since they were proteges of
  Pickerbaugh, must be earnest and forward-looking, and who, since they were
  patronized by Irving and Mrs. Watters, must be respectable.</p>

  <p>Watters took them in hand and kept them there. He had so thick a rind that
  it was impossible for him to understand that Martin's frequent refusals of
  his invitations could conceivably mean that he did not wish to come. He
  detected traces of heterodoxy in Martin, and with affection, diligence, and
  an extraordinarily heavy humor he devoted himself to the work of salvation.
  Frequently he sought to entertain other guests by urging, "Come on now, Mart,
  let's hear some of those crazy ideas of yours!"</p>

  <p>His friendly zeal was drab compared with that of his wife. Mrs. Watters
  had been reared by her father and by her husband to believe that she was the
  final fruit of the ages, and she set herself to correct the barbarism of the
  Arrowsmiths. She rebuked Martin's damns, Leora's smoking, and both their
  theories of bidding at bridge. But she never nagged. To have nagged would
  have been to admit that there were persons who did not acknowledge her
  sovereignty. She merely gave orders, brief, humorous, and introduced by a
  strident "Now don't be silly," and she expected that to settle the
  matter.</p>

  <p>Martin groaned, "Oh, Lord, between Pickerbaugh and Irve, it's easier to
  become a respectable member of society than to go on fighting."</p>

  <p>But Watters and Pickerbaugh were not so great a compulsion to
  respectability as the charms of finding himself listened to in Nautilus as he
  never had been in Wheatsylvania, and of finding himself admired by
  Orchid.</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">He had been seeking a precipitation test for the diagnosis
  of syphilis which should be quicker and simpler than the Wassermann. His
  slackened fingers and rusty mind were becoming used to the laboratory and to
  passionate hypotheses when he was dragged away to help Pickerbaugh in
  securing publicity. He was coaxed into making his first speech: an address on
  "What the Laboratory Teaches about Epidemics" for the Sunday Afternoon Free
  Lecture Course of the Star of Hope Universalist Church.</p>

  <p>He was flustered when he tried to prepare his notes, and on the morning of
  the affair he was chill as he remembered the dreadful thing he would do this
  day, but he was desperate with embarrassment when he came up to the Star of
  Hope Church.</p>

  <p>People were crowding in; mature, responsible people. He quaked, "They're
  coming to hear <i>me</i>, and I haven't got a darn' thing to say to 'em!" It
  made him feel the more ridiculous that they who presumably wished to listen
  to him should not be aware of him, and that the usher, profusely shaking
  hands at the Byzantine portal, should bluster, "You'll find plenty room right
  up the side aisles, young man."</p>

  <p>"I'm the speaker for the afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Oh, oh, yes, oh, yes, Doctor. Right round to the Bevis Street entrance,
  if you please, Doctor."</p>

  <p>In the parlors he was unctuously received by the pastor and a committee of
  three, wearing morning clothes and a manner of Christian intellectuality.</p>

  <p>They held his hand in turn, they brought up rustling women to meet him,
  they stood about him in a polite and twittery circle, and dismayingly they
  expected him to say something intelligent. Then, suffering, ghastly
  frightened, dumb, he was led through an arched doorway into the auditorium.
  Millions of faces were staring at his apologetic insignificance&mdash;faces
  in the curving lines of pews, faces in the low balcony, eyes which followed
  him and doubted him and noted that his heels were run down.</p>

  <p>The agony grew while he was prayed over and sung over.</p>

  <p>The pastor and the lay chairman of the Lecture Course opened with suitable
  devotions. While Martin trembled and tried to look brazenly at the massed
  people who were looking at him, while he sat nude and exposed and unprotected
  on the high platform, the pastor made announcement of the Thursday Missionary
  Supper and the Little Lads' Marching Club. They sang a brief cheerful hymn or
  two&mdash;Martin wondering whether to sit or stand&mdash;and the chairman
  prayed that "our friend who will address us today may have power to put his
  Message across." Through the prayer Martin sat with his forehead in his hand,
  feeling foolish, and raving, "I guess this is the proper
  attitude&mdash;they're all gawping at me&mdash;gosh, won't he ever
  quit?&mdash;oh, damn it, now what was that point I was going to make about
  fumigation?&mdash;oh, Lord, he's winding up and I've got to shoot!"</p>

  <p>Somehow, he was standing by the reading-desk, holding it for support, and
  his voice seemed to be going on, producing reasonable words. The blur of
  faces cleared and he saw individuals. He picked out a keen old man and tried
  to make him laugh and marvel.</p>

  <p>He found Leora, toward the back, nodding to him, reassuring him. He dared
  to look away from the path of faces directly in front of him. He glanced at
  the balcony&mdash;</p>

  <p>The audience perceived a young man who was being earnest about sera and
  vaccines but, while his voice buzzed on, that churchly young man had noted
  two silken ankles distinguishing the front row of the balcony, had discovered
  that they belonged to Orchid Pickerbaugh and that she was flashing down
  admiration.</p>

  <p>At the end Martin had the most enthusiastic applause ever known&mdash;all
  lecturers, after all lectures, are gratified by that kind of
  applause&mdash;and the chairman said the most flattering things ever uttered,
  and the audience went out with the most remarkable speed ever witnessed, and
  Martin discovered himself holding Orchid's hand in the parlors while she
  warbled, in the most adorable voice ever heard, "Oh, Dr. Arrowsmith, you were
  just wonderful! Most of these lecturers are old stuffs, but you put it right
  over! I'm going to do a dash home and tell Dad. He'll be so tickled!"</p>

  <p>Not till then did he find that Leora had made her way to the parlors and
  was looking at them like a wife.</p>

  <p>As they walked home Leora was eloquently silent.</p>

  <p>"Well, did you like my spiel?" he said, after a suitable time of indignant
  waiting.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it wasn't bad. It must have been awfully hard to talk to all those
  stupid people."</p>

  <p>"Stupid? What d'you mean by 'stupid'? They got me splendidly. They were
  fine."</p>

  <p>"Were they? Well anyway, thank Heaven, you won't have to keep up this
  silly gassing. Pickerbaugh likes to hear himself talk too well to let you in
  on it very often."</p>

  <p>"I didn't mind it. Fact, don't know but what it's a good thing to have to
  express myself publicly now and then. Makes you think more lucidly."</p>

  <p>"As for instance the nice, lovely, lucid politicians!"</p>

  <p>"Now you look here, Lee! Of course we know your husband is a mutt, and no
  good outside the laboratory, but I do think you might <i>pretend</i> to be a
  little enthusiastic over the first address he's ever made&mdash;the very
  first he's ev-er tackled&mdash;when it went off so well."</p>

  <p>"Why, silly, I was enthusiastic. I applauded a lot. I thought you were
  terribly smart. It's just&mdash;There's other things I think you can do
  better. What shall we do tonight; have a cold snack at home or go to the
  cafeteria?"</p>

  <p>Thus was he reduced from hero to husband, and he had all the pleasures of
  inappreciation.</p>

  <p>He thought about his indignities the whole week, but with the coming of
  winter there was a fever of dully sprightly dinners and safely wild bridge
  and their first evening at home, their first opportunity for secure and
  comfortable quarreling, was on Friday. They sat down to what he announced as
  "getting back to some real reading, like physiology and a little of this
  fellow Arnold Bennett&mdash;nice quiet reading," but which consisted of
  catching up on the news notes in the medical journals.</p>

  <p>He was restless. He threw down his magazine. He demanded:</p>

  <p>"What're you going to wear at Pickerbaugh's snow picnic tomorrow?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I haven't&mdash;I'll find something."</p>

  <p>"Lee, I want to ask you: Why the devil did you say I talked too much at
  Dr. Strafford's last evening? I know I've got most of the faults going, but I
  didn't know talking too much was one of 'em."</p>

  <p>"It hasn't been, till now."</p>

  <p>"'Till now'!"</p>

  <p>"You look here, Sandy Arrowsmith! You've been pouting like a bad brat all
  week. What's the matter with you?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I&mdash;Gosh, it makes me tired! Here everybody is so enthusiastic
  about my Star of Hope spiel&mdash;that note in the Morning Frontiersman, and
  Pickerbaugh says Orchid said it was a corker&mdash;and you never so much as
  peep!"</p>

  <p>"Didn't I applaud? But&mdash;It's just that I hope you aren't going to
  keep up this drooling."</p>

  <p>"You do, do you! Well, let me tell you I <i>am</i> going to keep it up!
  Not that I'm going to talk a lot of hot air. I gave 'em straight science,
  last Sunday, and they ate it up. I hadn't realized it isn't necessary to be
  mushy, to hold an audience. And the amount of good you can do! Why, I got
  across more Health Instruction and ideas about the value of the lab in that
  three-quarters of an hour than&mdash;I don't care for being a big gun but
  it's fine to have people where they have to listen to what you've got to say
  and can't butt in, way they did in Wheatsylvania. You bet I'm going to keep
  up what you so politely call my damn' fool drooling&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sandy, it may be all right for some people, but not for you. I can't tell
  you&mdash;that's one reason I haven't said more about your talk&mdash;I can't
  tell you how astonished I am to hear you, who're always sneering at what you
  call sentimentality, simply weeping over the Dear Little Tots!"</p>

  <p>"I never said that&mdash;never used the phrase and you know it. And by
  God! <i>You</i> talk about sneering! Just let me tell you that the Public
  Health Movement, by correcting early faults in children, by looking after
  their eyes and tonsils and so on, can save millions of lives and make a
  future generation&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know it! I love children much more than you do! But I mean all this
  ridiculous simpering&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, gosh, somebody has to do it. You can't work with people till you
  educate 'em. There's where old Pick, even if he is an imbecile, does such
  good work with his poems and all that stuff. Prob'ly be a good thing if I
  could write 'em&mdash;golly, wonder if I couldn't learn to?"</p>

  <p>"They're horrible!"</p>

  <p>"Now there's a fine consistency for you! The other evening you called 'em
  'cute.'"</p>

  <p>"I don't have to be consistent. I'm a mere woman. You, Martin Arrowsmith,
  you'd be the first to tell me so. And for Dr. Pickerbaugh they're all right,
  but not for you. You belong in a laboratory, finding out things, not
  advertising them. Do you remember once in Wheatsylvania for five minutes you
  almost thought of joining a church and being a Respectable Citizen? Are you
  going on for the rest of your life, stumbling into respectability and having
  to be dug out again? Will you never learn you're a barbarian?"</p>

  <p>"By God, I am! And&mdash;what was that other lovely thing you called
  me?&mdash;I'm also, soul of my soul, a damn' backwoods hick! And a fine lot
  you help! When I want to settle down to a decent and useful life and not go
  'round antagonizing people, you, the one that ought to believe in me, you're
  the first one to crab!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe Orchid Pickerbaugh would help you better."</p>

  <p>"She probably would! Believe me, she's a darling, and she did appreciate
  my spiel at the church, and if you think I'm going to sit up all night
  listening to you sneering at my work and my friends&mdash;I'm going to have a
  hot bath. Good <i>night!</i>"</p>

  <p>In the bath he gasped that it was impossible he should have been
  quarreling with Leora. Why! She was the only person in the world, besides
  Gottlieb and Sondelius and Clif Clawson&mdash;by the way, where was Clif?
  still in New York? didn't Clif owe him a letter? but anyway&mdash;He was a
  fool to have lost his temper, even if she was so stubborn that she wouldn't
  adjust her opinions, couldn't see that he had a gift for influencing people.
  Nobody would ever stand by him as she had, and he loved her&mdash;</p>

  <p>He dried himself violently; he dashed in with repentances; they told each
  other that they were the most reasonable persons living; they kissed with
  eloquence; and then Leora reflected:</p>

  <p>"Just the same, my lad, I'm not going to help you fool yourself. You're
  not a booster. You're a lie-hunter. Funny, you'd think to hear about these
  lie-hunters, like Professor Gottlieb and your old Voltaire, they couldn't be
  fooled. But maybe they were like you: always trying to get away from the
  tiresome truth, always hoping to settle down and be rich, always selling
  their souls to the devil and then going and doublecrossing the poor devil. I
  think&mdash;I think&mdash;" She sat up in bed, holding her temples in the
  labor of articulation. "You're different from Professor Gottlieb. He never
  makes mistakes or wastes time on&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He wasted time at Hunziker's nostrum factory all right, and his title is
  'Doctor,' not 'Professor,' if you <i>must</i> give him a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If he went to Hunziker's he had some good reason. He's a genius; he
  couldn't be wrong. Or could he, even he? But <i>anyway:</i> you, Sandy, you
  have to stumble every so often; have to learn by making mistakes. I will say
  one thing: you learn from your crazy mistakes. But I get a little tired,
  sometimes, watching you rush up and put your neck in every noose&mdash;like
  being a blinking orator or yearning over your Orchid."</p>

  <p>"Well, by golly! After I come in here trying to make peace! It's a good
  thing <i>you</i> never make any mistakes! But one perfect person in a
  household is enough!"</p>

  <p>He banged into bed. Silence. Soft sounds of "Mart&mdash;<i>Sandy!</i>" He
  ignored her, proud that he could be hard with her, and so fell asleep. At
  breakfast, when he was ashamed and eager, she was curt.</p>

  <p>"I don't care to discuss it," she said.</p>

  <p>In that wry mood they went on Saturday afternoon to the Pickerbaughs' snow
  picnic.</p><br>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">Dr. Pickerbaugh owned a small log cabin in a scanty grove of
  oaks among the hillocks north of Nautilus. A dozen of them drove out in a
  bob-sled filled with straw and blue woolly robes. The sleigh bells were
  exciting and the children leaped out to run beside the sled.</p>

  <p>The school physician, a bachelor, was attentive to Leora; twice he tucked
  her in, and that, for Nautilus, was almost compromising. In jealousy Martin
  turned openly and completely to Orchid.</p>

  <p>He grew interested in her not for the sake of disciplining Leora but for
  her own rosy sweetness. She was wearing a tweed jacket, with a tam, a
  flamboyant scarf, and the first breeches any girl had dared to display in
  Nautilus. She patted Martin's knee, and when they rode behind the sled on a
  perilous toboggan, she held his waist, resolutely.</p>

  <p>She was calling him "Dr. Martin" now, and he had come to a warm
  "Orchid."</p>

  <p>At the cabin there was a clamor of disembarkation. Together Martin and
  Orchid carried in the hamper of food; together they slid down the hillocks on
  skiis. When their skiis were entangled, they rolled into a drift, and as she
  clung to him, unafraid and unembarrassed, it seemed to him that in the
  roughness of tweeds she was but the softer and more wonderful&mdash;eyes
  fearless, cheeks brilliant as she brushed the coating of wet snow from them,
  flying legs of a slim boy, shoulders adorable in their pretense of sturdy
  boyishness&mdash;</p>

  <p>But "I'm a sentimental fool! Leora was right!" he snarled at himself. "I
  thought you had some originality! And poor little Orchid&mdash;she'd be
  shocked if she knew how sneak-minded you are!"</p>

  <p>But poor little Orchid was coaxing, "Come on, Dr. Martin, let's shoot off
  that high bluff. We're the only ones that have any pep."</p>

  <p>"That's because we're the only young ones."</p>

  <p>"It's because you're so young. I'm dreadfully old. I just sit and moon
  when you rave about your epidemics and things."</p>

  <p>He saw that, with her infernal school physician, Leora was sliding on a
  distant slope. It may have been pique and it may have been relief that he was
  licensed to be alone with Orchid, but he ceased to speak to her as though she
  were a child and he a person laden with wisdom; ceased to speak to her as
  though he were looking over his shoulder. They raced to the high bluff. They
  skied down it and fell; they had one glorious swooping slide, and wrestled in
  the snow.</p>

  <p>They returned to the cabin together, to find the others away. She stripped
  off her wet sweater and patted her soft blouse. They ferreted out a thermos
  of hot coffee, and he looked at her as though he was going to kiss her, and
  she looked back at him as though she did not mind. As they laid out the food
  they hummed with the intimacy of understanding, and when she trilled, "Now
  hurry up, lazy one, and put those cups on that horrid old table," it was as
  one who was content to be with him forever.</p>

  <p>They said nothing compromising, they did not hold hands, and as they rode
  home in the electric snow-flying darkness, though they sat shoulder by
  shoulder he did not put his arms about her except when the bob-sled slewed on
  sharp corners. If Martin was exalted with excitement, it was presumably
  caused by the wholesome exercises of the day. Nothing happened and nobody
  looked uneasy. At parting all their farewells were cheery and helpful.</p>

  <p>And Leora made no comments, though for a day or two there was about her a
  chill air which the busy Martin did not investigate.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">Nautilus was one of the first communities in the country to
  develop the Weeks habit, now so richly grown that we have Correspondence
  School Week, Christian Science Week, Osteopathy Week, and Georgia Pine
  Week.</p>

  <p>A Week is not merely a week.</p>

  <p>If an aggressive, wide-awake, live-wire, and go-ahead church or chamber of
  commerce or charity desires to improve itself, which means to get more money,
  it calls in those few energetic spirits who run any city, and proclaims a
  Week. This consists of one month of committee meetings, a hundred columns of
  praise for the organization in the public prints, and finally a day or two on
  which athletic persons flatter inappreciative audiences in churches or cinema
  theaters, and the prettiest girls in town have the pleasure of being allowed
  to talk to male strangers on the street corners, apropos of giving them
  extremely undecorative tags in exchange for the smallest sums which those
  strangers think they must pay if they are to be considered gentlemen.</p>

  <p>The only variation is the Weeks in which the object is not to acquire
  money immediately by the sale of tags but by general advertising to get more
  of it later.</p>

  <p>Nautilus had held a Pep Week, during which a race of rapidly talking men,
  formerly book-agents but now called Efficiency Engineers, went about giving
  advice to shopkeepers on how to get money away from one another more rapidly,
  and Dr. Almus Pickerbaugh addressed a prayer-meeting on "The Pep of St. Paul,
  the First Booster." It had held a Glad-hand Week, when everybody was supposed
  to speak to at least three strangers daily, to the end that infuriated
  elderly traveling salesmen were back-slapped all day long by hearty and
  powerful unknown persons. There had also been an Old Home Week, a Write to
  Mother Week, a We Want Your Factory in Nautilus Week, an Eat More Corn Week,
  a Go to Church Week, a Salvation Army Week, and an Own Your Own Auto
  Week.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the bonniest of all was Y. Week, to raise eighty thousand dollars
  for a new Y.M.C.A. building.</p>

  <p>On the old building were electric signs, changed daily, announcing "You
  Must Come Across," "Young Man Come Along" and "Your Money Creates 'Appiness."
  Dr. Pickerbaugh made nineteen addresses in three days, comparing the Y.M.C.A.
  to the Crusaders, the Apostles, and the expeditions of Dr. Cook&mdash;who, he
  believed, really had discovered the North Pole. Orchid sold three hundred and
  nineteen Y. tags, seven of them to the same man, who afterward made improper
  remarks to her. She was rescued by a Y.M.C.A. secretary, who for a
  considerable time held her hand to calm her.</p>

  <p>No organization could rival Almus Pickerbaugh in the invention of
  Weeks.</p>

  <p>He started in January with a Better Babies Week, and a very good Week it
  was, but so hotly followed by Banish the Booze Week, Tougher Teeth Week, and
  Stop the Spitter Week that people who lacked his vigor were heard groaning,
  "My health is being ruined by all this fretting over health."</p>

  <p>During Clean-up Week, Pickerbaugh spread abroad a new lyric of his own
  composition:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">Germs come by stealth<br>
  And ruin health,<br>
  So listen, pard,<br>
  Just drop a card<br>
  To some man who'll clean up your yard<br>
  And that will hit the old germs hard.</p><br>

  <p>Swat the Fly Week brought him, besides the joy of giving prizes to the
  children who had slaughtered the most flies, the inspiration for two verses.
  Posters admonished:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">Sell your hammer and buy a horn,<br>
  But hang onto the old fly-swatter.<br>
  If you don't want disease sneaking into the Home<br>
  Then to kill the fly you gotter!</p><br>

  <p>It chanced that the Fraternal Order of Eagles were holding a state
  convention at Burlington that week, and Pickerbaugh telegraphed to
  them:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">Just mention fly-prevention<br>
  At the good old Eagles' convention.</p><br>

  <p>This was quoted in ninety-six newspapers, including one in Alaska, and
  waving the clippings Pickerbaugh explained to Martin, "Now you see the way a
  fellow can get the truth across, if he goes at it right."</p>

  <p>Three Cigars a Day Week, which Pickerbaugh invented in midsummer, was not
  altogether successful, partly because an injudicious humorist on a local
  newspaper wanted to know whether Dr. Pickerbaugh really expected all babes in
  arms to smoke as many as three cigars a day, and partly because the
  cigar-manufacturers came around to the Department of Health with strong
  remarks about Common Sense. Nor was there thorough satisfaction in Can the
  Cat and Doctor the Dog Week.</p>

  <p>With all his Weeks, Pickerbaugh had time to preside over the Program
  Committee of the State Convention of Health Officers and Agencies.</p>

  <p>It was he who wrote the circular letter sent to all members:</p><br>

  <p class="typewriter">Brother Males and Shemales:</p>

  <p class="typewriter">Are you coming to the Health Bee? It will be the livest
  Hop-to-it that this busy lil ole planet has ever see. And it's going to be
  Practical. We'll kiss out on all these glittering generalities and get
  messages from men as kin talk, so we can lug a think or two (2) home wid
  us.</p>

  <p class="typewriter">Luther Botts, the famous community-sing leader, will be
  there to put Wim an Wigor neverything into the program. John F. Zeisser,
  M.A., M.D., nail the rest of the alphabet (part your hair Jack and look cute,
  the ladies will love you) will unlimber a coupla key-notes. (On your
  tootsies, fellers, thar she blows!) From time to time, if the brakes hold, we
  will, or shall in the infinitive, hie oursellufs from wherein we are at to
  thither, and grab a lunch with Wild Wittles.</p>

  <p class="typewriter">Do it sound like a good show? It do! Barber, you're
  next. Let's have those cards saying you're coming.</p><br>

  <p>This created much enthusiasm and merriment. Dr. Feesons of Clinton wrote
  to Pickerbaugh:</p>

  <p>I figure it was largely due to your snappy come-on letter that we pulled
  such an attendance and with all modesty I think we may say it was the best
  health convention ever held in the world. I had to laugh at one old hen,
  Bostonian or somepun, who was howling that your letter was "undignified"! Can
  you beat it! I think people as hypercritical and lacking in humor as her
  should be treated with the dignified contempt they deserve, the damn
  fool!</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">Martin was enthusiastic during Better Babies Week. Leora and
  he weighed babies, examined them, made out diet charts, and in each child saw
  the baby they could never have. But when it came to More Babies Week, then he
  was argumentative. He believed, he said, in birth-control. Pickerbaugh
  answered with theology, violence, and the example of his own eight
  beauties.</p>

  <p>Martin was equally unconvinced by Anti-Tuberculosis Week. He liked his
  windows open at night and he disliked men who spat tobacco juice on
  sidewalks, but he was jarred by hearing these certainly esthetic and possibly
  hygienic reforms proposed with holy frenzy and bogus statistics.</p>

  <p>Any questioning of his fluent figures about tuberculosis, any hint that
  the cause of decline in the disease may have been natural growth of immunity
  and not the crusades against spitting and stale air, Pickerbaugh regarded as
  a criticism of his honesty in making such crusades. He had the personal
  touchiness of most propagandists; he believed that because he was sincere,
  therefore his opinions must always be correct. To demand that he be accurate
  in his statements, to quote Raymond Pearl's dictum: "As a matter of objective
  scientific fact, extremely little is known about why the mortality from
  tuberculosis has declined"&mdash;this was to be a scoundrel who really liked
  to befoul the pavements.</p>

  <p>Martin was so alienated that he took an anti-social and probably vicious
  joy in discovering that though the death-rate in tuberculosis certainly had
  decreased during Pickerbaugh's administration in Nautilus, it had decreased
  at the same rate in most villages of the district, with no speeches about
  spitting, no Open Your Windows parades.</p>

  <p>It was fortunate for Martin that Pickerbaugh did not expect him to take
  much share in his publicity campaigns, but rather to be his substitute in the
  office during them. They stirred in Martin the most furious and complicated
  thoughts that had ever afflicted him.</p>

  <p>Whenever he hinted criticism, Pickerbaugh answered, "What if my statistics
  aren't always exact? W'hat if my advertising, my jollying of the public, does
  strike some folks as vulgar? It all does good; it's all on the right side. No
  matter what methods we use, if we can get people to have more fresh air and
  cleaner yards and less alcohol, we're justified."</p>

  <p>To himself, a little surprised, Martin put it, "Yes, does it really
  matter? Does truth matter&mdash;clean, cold, unfriendly truth, Max Gottlieb's
  truth? Everybody says, 'Oh, you mustn't tamper with the truth,' and everybody
  is furious if you hint that they themselves are tampering with it. Does
  anything matter, except making love and sleeping and eating and being
  flattered?</p>

  <p>"I think truth does matter to me, but if it does, isn't the desire for
  scientific precision simply my hobby, like another man's excitement about his
  golf? Anyway, I'm going to stick by Pickerbaugh."</p>

  <p>To the defense of his chief he was the more impelled by the attitude of
  Irving Watters and such other physicians as attacked Pickerbaugh because they
  feared that he really would be successful, and reduce their earnings. But all
  the while Martin was weary of unchecked statistics.</p>

  <p>He estimated that according to Pickerbaugh's figures on bad teeth,
  careless motoring, tuberculosis, and seven other afflictions alone, every
  person in the city had a one hundred and eighty per cent chance of dying
  before the age of sixteen and he could not startle with much alarm when
  Pickerbaugh shouted, "Do you realize that the number of people who died from
  yaws in Pickens County, Mississippi, last year alone, was twenty-nine and
  that they might all have been saved, yes, sir, <i>saved</i>, by a daily cold
  shower?"</p>

  <p>For Pickerbaugh had the dreadful habit of cold showers, even in winter,
  though he might have known that nineteen men between the ages of seventeen
  and forty-two died of cold showers in twenty-two years in Milwaukee
  alone.</p>

  <p>To Pickerbaugh the existence of "variables," a word which Martin now used
  as irritatingly as once he had used "control," was without significance. That
  health might be determined by temperature, heredity, profession, soil,
  natural immunity, or by anything save health-department campaigns for
  increased washing and morality, was to him inconceivable</p>

  <p>"Variables! Huh!" Pickerbaugh snorted. "Why, every enlightened man in the
  public service <i>knows</i> enough about the causes of disease&mdash;matter
  now of acting on that knowledge."</p>

  <p>When Martin sought to show that they certainly knew very little about the
  superiority of fresh air to warmth in schools, about the hygienic dangers of
  dirty streets about the real danger of alcohol, about the value of face-masks
  in influenza epidemics, about most of the things they tub-thumped in their
  campaigns, Pickerbaugh merely became angry, and Martin wanted to resign, and
  saw Irving Watters again, and returned to Pickerbaugh with new zeal, and was
  in general as agitated and wretched as a young revolutionist discovering the
  smugness of his leaders.</p>

  <p>He came to question what Pickerbaugh called "the proven practical value"
  of his campaigns as much as the accuracy of Pickerbaugh's biology. He noted
  how bored were most of the newspapermen by being galvanized into a new saving
  of the world once a fortnight, and how incomparably bored was the Man in the
  Street when the nineteenth pretty girl in twenty days had surged up demanding
  that he buy a tag to support an association of which he had never heard.</p>

  <p>But more dismaying was the slimy trail of the dollar which he beheld in
  Pickerbaugh's most ardent eloquence.</p>

  <p>When Martin suggested that all milk should be pasteurized, that certain
  tenements known to be tuberculosis-breeders should be burnt down instead of
  being fumigated in a fiddling useless way, when he hinted that these attacks
  would save more lives than ten thousand sermons and ten years of parades by
  little girls carrying banners and being soaked by the rain, then Pickerbaugh
  worried, "No, no, Martin, don't think we could do that. Get so much
  opposition from the dairymen and the landlords. Can't accomplish anything in
  this work unless you keep from offending people."</p>

  <p>When Pickerbaugh addressed a church or the home circle he spoke of "the
  value of health in making life more joyful," but when he addressed a business
  luncheon he changed it to "the value in good round dollars and cents of
  having workmen who are healthy and sober, and therefore able to work faster
  at the same wages." Parents' associations he enlightened upon "the saving in
  doctors' bills of treating the child before maladjustments go too far,' but
  to physicians he gave assurance that public health agitation would merely
  make the custom of going regularly to doctors more popular.</p>

  <p>To Martin, he spoke of Pasteur, George Washington, Victor Vaughan, and
  Edison as his masters, but in asking the business men of Nautilus&mdash;the
  Rotary Club, the Chamber of Commerce, the association of
  wholesalers&mdash;for their divine approval of more funds for his department,
  he made it clear that they were his masters and lords of all the land, and
  fatly, behind cigars, they accepted their kinghood.</p>

  <p>Gradually Martin's contemplation moved beyond Almus Pickerbaugh to all
  leaders, of armies or empires, of universities or churches, and he saw that
  most of them were Pickerbaughs. He preached to himself, as Max Gottlieb had
  once preached to him, the loyalty of dissent, the faith of being very
  doubtful, the gospel of not bawling gospels, the wisdom of admitting the
  probable ignorance of one's self and of everybody else, and the energetic
  acceleration of a Movement for going very slow.</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">A hundred interruptions took Martin out of his laboratory.
  He was summoned into the reception-room of the department to explain to angry
  citizens why the garage next door to them should smell of gasoline; he went
  back to his cubbyhole to dictate letters to school-principals about dental
  clinics; he drove out to Swede Hollow to see what attention the food and
  dairy inspector had given to the slaughterhouses; he ordered a family in
  Shantytown quarantined; and escaped at last into the laboratory.</p>

  <p>It was well lighted, convenient, well stocked. Martin had little time for
  anything but cultures, blood-tests, and Wassermanns for the private
  physicians of the city, but the work rested him, and now and then he
  struggled over a precipitation test which was going to replace Wassermanns
  and make him famous.</p>

  <p>Pickerbaugh apparently believed that this research would take six weeks;
  Martin had hoped to do it in two years; and with the present interruptions it
  would require two hundred, by which time the Pickerbaughs would have
  eradicated syphilis and made the test useless.</p>

  <p>To Martin's duties was added the entertainment of Leora in the strange
  city of Nautilus.</p>

  <p>"Do you manage to keep busy all day?" he encouraged her, and, "Any place
  you'd like to go this evening?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him suspiciously. She was as easily and automatically
  contented by herself as a pussy cat, and he had never before worried about
  her amusement.</p><br>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">The Pickerbaugh daughters were always popping into Martin's
  laboratory. The twins broke test-tubes, and made doll tents out of filter
  paper. Orchid lettered the special posters for her father's Weeks, and the
  laboratory, she said, was the quietest place in which to work. While Martin
  stood at his bench he was conscious of her, humming at a table in the corner.
  They talked, tremendously, and he listened with fatuous enthusiasm to
  opinions which, had Leora produced them, he would have greeted with "That's a
  damn' silly remark!"</p>

  <p>He held a clear, claret-red tube of hemolyzed blood up to the light,
  thinking half of its color and half of Orchid's ankles as she bent over the
  table, absurdly patient with her paintbrushes, curling her legs in a
  fantastic knot.</p>

  <p>Absurdly he asked her, "Look here, honey. Suppose you&mdash;suppose a kid
  like you were to fall in love with a married man. What d'you think she ought
  to do? Be nice to him? Or chuck him?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, she ought to chuck him. No matter how much she suffered. Even if she
  liked him terribly. Because even if she liked him, she oughtn't to wrong his
  wife."</p>

  <p>"But suppose the wife never knew, or maybe didn't care?" He had stopped
  his pretense of working; he was standing before her, arms akimbo, dark eyes
  demanding.</p>

  <p>"Well, if she didn't know&mdash;But it isn't that. I believe marriages
  really and truly are made in Heaven, don't you? Some day Prince Charming will
  come, the perfect lover&mdash;" She was so young, her lips were so young, so
  very sweet! "&mdash;and of course I want to keep myself for him. It would
  spoil everything if I made light of love before my Hero came."</p>

  <p>But her smile was caressing.</p>

  <p>He pictured them thrown together in a lonely camp. He saw her parroted
  moralities forgotten. He went through a change as definite as religious
  conversion or the coming of insane frenzy in war; the change from shamed
  reluctance to be unfaithful to his wife, to a determination to take what he
  could get. He began to resent Leora's demand that she, who had eternally his
  deepest love, should also demand his every wandering fancy. And she did
  demand it. She rarely spoke of Orchid, but she could tell (or nervously he
  thought she could tell) when he had spent an afternoon with the child. Her
  mute examination of him made him feel illicit. He who had never been unctuous
  was profuse and hearty as he urged her, "Been home all day? Well, we'll just
  skip out after dinner and take in a movie. Or shall we call up somebody and
  go see 'em? Whatever you'd like."</p>

  <p>He heard his voice being flowery, and he hated it and knew that Leora was
  not cajoled. Whenever he drifted into one of his meditations on the
  superiority of his brand of truth to Pickerbaugh's, he snarled, "You're a
  fine bird to think about truth, you liar!"</p>

  <p>He paid, in fact, an enormous price for looking at Orchid's lips, and no
  amount of anxiety about the price kept him from looking at them.</p>

  <p>In early summer, two months before the outbreak of the Great War in
  Europe, Leora went to Wheatsylvania for a fortnight with her family. Then she
  spoke:</p>

  <p>"Sandy, I'm not going to ask you any questions when I come back, but I
  hope you won't look as foolish as you've been looking lately. I don't think
  that bachelor's button, that ragweed, that lady idiot of yours is worth our
  quarreling. Sandy darling, I do want you to be happy, but unless I up and die
  on you some day, I'm not going to be hung up like an old cap. I warn you. Now
  about ice. I've left an order for a hundred pounds a week, and if you want to
  get your own dinners sometimes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>When she had gone, nothing immediately happened, though a good deal was
  always about to happen. Orchid had the flapper's curiosity as to what a man
  was likely to do, but she was satisfied by exceedingly small thrills.</p>

  <p>Martin swore, that morning of June, that she was a fool and a flirt, and
  he "hadn't the slightest intention of going near her." No! He would call on
  Irving Watters in the evening, or read, or have a walk with the school-clinic
  dentist.</p>

  <p>But at half-past eight he was loitering toward her house.</p>

  <p>If the elder Pickerbaughs were there&mdash;Martin could hear himself
  saying, "Thought I'd just drop by, Doctor, and ask you what you thought
  about&mdash;" Hang it! Thought about what? Pickerbaugh never thought about
  anything.</p>

  <p>On the low front steps he could see Orchid. Leaning over her was a boy of
  twenty, one Charley, a clerk.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Father in?" he cried, with a carelessness on which he could but
  pride himself.</p>

  <p>"I'm terribly sorry; he and Mama won't be back till eleven. Won't you sit
  down and cool off a little?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;" He did sit down, firmly, and tried to make youthful
  conversation, while Charley produced sentiments suitable, in Charley's
  opinion, to the aged Dr. Arrowsmith, and Orchid made little purry interested
  sounds, an art in which she was very intelligent.</p>

  <p>"Been, uh, been seeing many of the baseball games?" said Martin.</p>

  <p>"Oh, been getting in all I can," said Charley. "How's things going at City
  Hall? Been nailing a lot of cases of small-pox and winkulus pinkulus and all
  those fancy diseases?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, keep busy," grunted old Dr. Arrowsmith.</p>

  <p>He could think of nothing else. He listened while Charley and Orchid
  giggled cryptically about things which barred him out and made him feel a
  hundred years old: references to Mamie and Earl, and a violent "Yeh, that's
  all right, but any time you see me dancing with her you just tell me about
  it, will yuh!" At the corner, Verbena Pickerbaugh was yelping, and observing,
  "Now you quit!" to persons unknown.</p>

  <p>"Hell! It isn't worth it! I'm going home," Martin sighed, but at the
  moment Charley screamed, "Well, ta, ta, be good; gotta toddle along."</p>

  <p>He was left to Orchid and peace and a silence rather embarrassing.</p>

  <p>"It's so nice to be with somebody that has brains and doesn't always try
  to flirt, like Charley," said Orchid.</p>

  <p>He considered, "Splendid! She's going to be just a nice good girl. And
  I've come to my senses. We'll just have a little chat and I'll go home."</p>

  <p>She seemed to have moved nearer. She whispered at him, "I was so lonely,
  especially with that horrid slangy boy, till I heard your step on the walk. I
  knew it the second I heard it."</p>

  <p>He patted her hand. As his pats were becoming more ardent than might have
  been expected from the assistant and friend of her father, she withdrew her
  hand, clasped her knees, and began to chatter.</p>

  <p>Always it had been so in the evenings when he had drifted to the porch and
  found her alone. She was ten times more incalculable than the most complex
  woman. He managed to feel guilty toward Leora without any of the reputed joys
  of being guilty.</p>

  <p>While she talked he tried to discover whether she had any brains whatever.
  Apparently she did not have enough to attend a small Midwestern
  denominational college. Verbena was going to college this autumn, but Orchid,
  she explained, thought she "ought to stay home and help Mama take care of the
  chickabiddies."</p>

  <p>"Meaning," Martin reflected, "that she can't even pass the Mugford
  entrance exams!" But his opinion of her intelligence was suddenly enlarged as
  she whimpered, "Poor little me, prob'ly I'll always stay here in Nautilus,
  while you&mdash;oh, with your knowledge and your frightfully strong
  will-power, I know you're going to conquer the world!"</p>

  <p>"Nonsense, I'll never conquer any world, but I do hope to pull off a few
  good health measures. Honestly, Orchid honey, do you think I have much
  will-power?"</p>

  <p>The full moon was spacious now behind the maples. The seedy Pickerbaugh
  domain was enchanted; the tangled grass was a garden of roses, the ragged
  grape-arbor a shrine to Diana, the old hammock turned to fringed cloth of
  silver, the bad-tempered and sputtering lawn-sprinkler a fountain, and over
  all the world was the proper witchery of moonstruck love. The little city, by
  day as noisy and busy as a pack of children, was stilled and forgotten.
  Rarely had Martin been inspired to perceive the magic of a perfect hour, so
  absorbed was he ever in irascible pondering, but now he was caught, and
  lifted in rapture.</p>

  <p>He held Orchid's quiet hand&mdash;and was lonely for Leora.</p>

  <p>The belligerent Martin who had carried off Leora had not thought about
  romance, because in his clumsy way he had been romantic. The Martin who, like
  a returned warrior scented and enfeebled, yearned toward a girl in the
  moonlight, now desirously lifted his face to romance and was altogether
  unromantic.</p>

  <p>He felt the duty of making love. He drew her close, but when she sighed,
  "Oh, please don't," there was in him no ruthlessness and no conviction with
  which to go on. He considered the moonlight again, but also he considered
  being at the office early in the morning, and he wondered if he could without
  detection slip out his watch and see what time it was. He managed it. He
  stooped to kiss her good-night, and somehow didn't quite kiss her, and found
  himself walking home.</p>

  <p>As he went, he was ruthless and convinced enough regarding himself. He had
  never, he raged, however stumbling he might have been, expected to find
  himself a little pilferer of love, a peeping, creeping area-sneak, and not
  even successful in his sneaking, less successful than the soda-clerks who
  swanked nightly with the virgins under the maples. He told himself that
  Orchid was a young woman of no great wisdom, a sigher and drawer-out of her
  M's and O's, but once he was in his lonely flat he longed for her, thought of
  miraculous and completely idiotic ways of luring her here tonight, and went
  to bed yearning, "Oh, Orchid&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Perhaps he had paid too much attention to moonlight and soft summer, for
  quite suddenly, one day when Orchid came swarming all over the laboratory and
  perched on the bench with a whisk of stockings, he stalked to her,
  masterfully seized her wrists, and kissed her as she deserved to be
  kissed.</p>

  <p>He immediately ceased to be masterful. He was frightened. He stared at her
  wanly. She stared back, shocked, eyes wide, lips uncertain.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" she profoundly said.</p>

  <p>Then, in a tone of immense interest and some satisfaction:</p>

  <p>"Martin&mdash;oh&mdash;my dear&mdash;do you think you ought to have done
  that?"</p>

  <p>He kissed her again. She yielded and for a moment there was nothing in the
  universe, neither he nor she, neither laboratory nor fathers nor wives nor
  traditions, but only the intensity of their being together.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she babbled, "I know there's lots of conventional people that
  would say we'd done wrong, and perhaps I'd have thought so, one time,
  but&mdash;Oh, I'm terribly glad I'm liberal! Of course I wouldn't hurt dear
  Leora or do anything <i>really</i> wrong for the world, but isn't it
  wonderful that with so many bourgeois folks all around, we can rise above
  them and realize the call that strength makes to strength and&mdash;But I've
  simply <i>got</i> to be at the Y.W.C.A. meeting. There's a woman lawyer from
  New York that's going to tell us about the Modern Woman's Career."</p>

  <p>When she had gone Martin viewed himself as a successful lover. "I've won
  her," he gloated...Probably never has gloating been so shakily and badly
  done.</p>

  <p>That evening, when he was playing poker in his flat with Irving Watters,
  the school-clinic dentist, and a young doctor from the city clinic, the
  telephone bell summoned him to an excited but saccharine:</p>

  <p>"This is Orchid. Are you glad I called up?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, yes, mighty glad you called up." He tried to make it at once
  amorously joyful, and impersonal enough to beguile the three coatless,
  beer-swizzling, grinning doctors.</p>

  <p>"Are you doing anything this evening, Marty?"</p>

  <p>"Just, uh, couple fellows here for a little game cards."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" It was acute. "Oh, then you&mdash;I was such a baby to call you up,
  but Daddy is away and Verbena and everybody, and it was such a lovely
  evening, and I just thought&mdash;<i>do</i> you think I'm an awful little
  silly?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;sure not."</p>

  <p>"I'm so glad you don't. I'd hate it if I thought you thought I was just a
  silly to call you up. You don't, do you?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;course not. Look, I've got to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know. I mustn't keep you. But I just wanted you to tell me whether you
  thought I was a silly to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No! Honest! Really!"</p>

  <p>Three fidgety minutes later, deplorably aware of masculine snickers from
  behind him, he escaped. The poker-players said all the things considered
  suitable in Nautilus: "Oh, you little Don Jewen!" and "Can you beat
  it&mdash;his wife only gone for a week!" and "Who is she, Doctor? Go on, you
  tightwad, bring her up here!" and "Say, I know who it is; it's that little
  milliner on Prairie Avenue."</p>

  <p>Next noon she telephoned from a drug store that she had lain awake all
  night, and on profound contemplation decided that they "musn't ever do that
  sort of thing again"&mdash;and would he meet her at the corner of Crimmins
  Street and Missouri Avenue at eight, so that they might talk it all over?</p>

  <p>In the afternoon she telephoned and changed the tryst to half-past
  eight.</p>

  <p>At five she called up just to remind him&mdash;</p>

  <p>In the laboratory that day Martin transplanted cultures no more. He was
  too confusedly human to be a satisfactory experimenter, too coldly thinking
  to be a satisfactory sinful male, and all the while he longed for the sure
  solace of Leora.</p>

  <p>"I can go as far as I like with her tonight.</p>

  <p>"But she's a brainless man-chaser.</p>

  <p>"All the better. I'm tired of being a punk philosopher.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if these other lucky lovers that you read about in all this
  fiction and poetry feel as glum as I do?</p>

  <p>"I will <i>not</i> be middle-aged and cautious and monogamic and moral!
  It's against my religion. I demand the right to be free&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Hell! These free souls that have to slave at being free are just as bad
  as their Methodist dads. I have enough sound natural immorality in me so I
  can afford to be moral. I want to keep my brain clear for work. I don't want
  it blurred by dutifully running around trying to kiss everybody I can.</p>

  <p>"Orchid is too easy. I hate to give up the right of being a happy sinner,
  but my way was so straight, with just Leora and my work, and I'm not going to
  mess it. God help any man that likes his work and his wife! He's beaten from
  the beginning."</p>

  <p>He met Orchid at eight-thirty, and the whole matter was unkind. He was
  equally distasteful of the gallant Martin of two days ago and the prosy
  cautious Martin of tonight. He went home desolately ascetic, and longed for
  Orchid all the night.</p>

  <p>A week later Leora returned from Wheatsylvania.</p>

  <p>He met her at the station.</p>

  <p>"It's all right," he said. "I feel a hundred and seven years old. I'm a
  respectable, moral young man, and Lord how I'd hate it, if it wasn't for my
  precipitation test and you and&mdash;<i>why</i> do you always lose your trunk
  check? I suppose I am a bad example for others, giving up so easily. No, no,
  darling, can't you <i>see</i>, that's the transportation check the conductor
  gave you!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">This summer Pickerbaugh had shouted and hand-shaken his way
  through a brief Chautauqua tour in Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas. Martin
  realized that though he seemed, in contrast to Gustaf Sondelius, an
  unfortunately articulate and generous lout, he was destined to be ten times
  better known in America than Sondelius could ever be, a thousand times better
  known than Max Gottlieb.</p>

  <p>He was a correspondent of many of the nickel-plated Great Men whose
  pictures and sonorous aphorisms appeared in the magazines: the advertising
  men who wrote little books about Pep and Optimism, the editor of the magazine
  which told clerks how to become Goethes and Stonewall Jacksons by studying
  correspondence-courses and never touching the manhood-rotting beer, and the
  cornfield sage who was equally an authority on finance, peace, biology,
  editing, Peruvian ethnology, and making oratory pay. These intellectual
  rulers recognized Pickerbaugh as one of them; they wrote quippish letters to
  him: and when he answered he signed himself "Pick," in red pencil.</p>

  <p>The Onward March Magazine, which specialized in biographies of Men Who
  Have Made Good, had an account of Pickerbaugh among its sketches of the
  pastor who built his own, beautiful Neo-Gothic church out of tin cans, the
  lady who had in seven years kept 2,698 factory-girls from leading lives of
  shame, and the Oregon cobbler who had taught himself to read Sanskrit,
  Finnish, and Esperanto.</p>

  <p>"Meet Ol' Doe Almus Pickerbaugh, a he-man whom Chum Frink has hailed as
  'the two-fisted, fighting poet doc,' a scientist who puts his remarkable
  discoveries right over third base, yet who, as a reg'lar old-fashioned
  Sunday-school superintendent, rebukes the atheistic so-called scientists that
  are menacing the foundations of our religion and liberties by their
  smart-aleck cracks at everything that is noble and improving," chanted the
  chronicler.</p>

  <p>Martin was reading this article, trying to realize that it was actually
  exposed in a fabulous New York magazine, with a million circulation, when
  Pickerbaugh summoned him.</p>

  <p>"Marty" he said, "do you feel competent to run this Department?"</p>

  <p>"Why, uh&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do you think you can buck the Interests and keep a clean city all by
  yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Why, uh&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Because it looks as if I were going to Washington, as the next
  congressman from this district!"</p>

  <p>"Really?"</p>

  <p>"Looks that way. Boy, I'm going to take to the whole nation the Message
  I've tried to ram home here!"</p>

  <p>Martin got out quite a good "I congratulate you." He was so astonished
  that it sounded fervent. He still had a fragment of his boyhood belief that
  congressmen were persons of intelligence and importance.</p>

  <p>"I've just been in conference with some of the leading Republicans of the
  district. Great surprise to me. Ha, ha, ha! Maybe they picked me because they
  haven't anybody else to run this year. Ha, ha, ha!"</p>

  <p>Martin also laughed. Pickerbaugh looked as though that was not exactly the
  right response, but he recovered and caroled on:</p>

  <p>"I said to them, 'Gentlemen, I must warn you that I am not sure I possess
  the rare qualifications needful in a man who shall have the high privilege of
  laying down, at Washington, the rules and regulations for the guidance, in
  every walk of life, of this great nation of a hundred million people.
  However, gentlemen,' I said, 'the impulse that prompts me to consider, in all
  modesty, your unexpected and probably undeserved honor is the fact that it
  seems to me that what Congress needs is more forward-looking scientists to
  plan and more genu-ine trained business men to execute the improvements
  demanded by our evolving commonwealth, and also the possibility of persuading
  the Boys there at Washington of the pre-eminent and crying need of a
  Secretary of Health who shall completely control&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>But no matter what Martin thought about it, the Republicans really did
  nominate Pickerbaugh for Congress.</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">While Pickerbaugh went out campaigning, Martin was in charge
  of the Department, and he began his reign by getting himself denounced as a
  tyrant and a radical.</p>

  <p>There was no more sanitary and efficient dairy in Iowa than that of old
  Klopchuk, on the outskirts of Nautilus. It was tiled and drained and
  excellently lighted; the milking machines were perfect; the bottles were
  super-boiled; and Klopchuk welcomed inspectors and the tuberculin test. He
  had fought the dairy-men's union and kept his dairy open-shop by paying more
  than the union scale. Once, when Martin attended a meeting of the Nautilus
  Central Labor Council as Pickerbaugh's representative, the secretary of the
  council confessed that there was no plant which they would so like to
  unionize and which they were so unlikely to unionize as Klopchuk's Dairy.</p>

  <p>Now Martin's labor sympathies were small. Like most laboratory men, he
  believed that the reason why workmen found less joy in sewing vests or in
  pulling a lever than he did in a long research was because they were an
  inferior race, born lazy and wicked. The complaint of the unions was the one
  thing to convince him that at last he had found perfection.</p>

  <p>Often he stopped at Klopchuk's merely for the satisfaction of it. He noted
  but one thing which disturbed him: a milker had a persistent sore throat. He
  examined the man, made cultures, and found hemolytic streptococcus. In a
  panic he hurried back to the dairy, and after cultures he discovered that
  there was streptococcus in the udders of three cows.</p>

  <p>When Pickerbaugh had saved the health of the nation through all the
  smaller towns in the congressional district and had returned to Nautilus,
  Martin insisted on the quarantine of the infected milker and the closing of
  the Klopchuk Dairy till no more infection should be found.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! Why, that's the cleanest place in the city," Pickerbaugh
  scoffed. "Why borrow trouble? There's no sign of an epidemic of strep."</p>

  <p>"There darn' well will be! Three cows infected. Look at what's happened in
  Boston and Baltimore, here recently. I've asked Klopchuk to come in and talk
  it over."</p>

  <p>"Well, you know how busy I am, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Klopchuk appeared at eleven, and to Klopchuk the affair was tragic. Born
  in a gutter in Poland, starving in New York, working twenty hours a day in
  Vermont, in Ohio, in Iowa, he had made this beautiful thing, his dairy.</p>

  <p>Seamed, drooping, twirling his hat, almost in tears, he protested, "Dr.
  Pickerbaugh, I do everything the doctors say is necessary. I know dairies!
  Now comes this young man and he says because one of my men has a cold, I kill
  little children with diseased milk! I tell you, this is my life, and I would
  sooner hang myself than send out one drop of bad milk. The young man has some
  wicked reason. I have asked questions. I find he is a great friend from the
  Central Labor Council. Why, he go to their meetings! And they want to break
  me!"</p>

  <p>To Martin the trembling old man was pitiful, but he had never before been
  accused of treachery. He said grimly:</p>

  <p>"You can take up the personal charges against me later, Dr. Pickerbaugh.
  Meantime I suggest you have in some expert to test my results; say Long of
  Chicago or Brent of Minneapolis or somebody."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;" The Kipling and Billy Sunday of health looked
  as distressed as Klopchuk. "I'm sure our friend here doesn't really mean to
  make charges against you, Mart. He's overwrought, naturally. Can't we just
  treat the fellow that has the strep infection and not make everybody
  uncomfortable?"</p>

  <p>"All right, if you want a bad epidemic here, toward the end of your
  campaign!"</p>

  <p>"You know cussed well I'd do anything to avoid&mdash;Though I want you to
  distinctly understand it has nothing to do with my campaign for Congress!
  It's simply that I owe my city the most scrupulous performance of duty in
  safeguarding it against disease, and the most fearless
  enforcement&mdash;"</p>

  <p>At the end of his oratory Pickerbaugh telegraphed to Dr. J. C. Long, the
  Chicago bacteriologist.</p>

  <p>Dr. Long looked as though he had made the train journey in an ice-box.
  Martin had never seen a man so free from the poetry and flowing philanthropy
  of Almus Pickerbaugh. He was slim, precise, lipless, lapless, and
  eye-glassed, and his hair was parted in the middle. He coolly listened to
  Martin, coldly listened to Pickerbaugh, icily heard Klopchuk, made his
  inspection, and reported, "Dr. Arrowsmith seems to know his business
  perfectly, there is certainly a danger here, I advise closing the dairy, my
  fee is one hundred dollars, thank you no I shall not stay to dinner I must
  catch the evening train."</p>

  <p>Martin went home to Leora snarling, "That man was just as lovable as a
  cucumber salad, but my God, Lee, with his freedom from bunk he's made me wild
  to get back to research; away from all these humanitarians that are so busy
  hollering about loving the dear people that they let the people die! I hated
  him, but&mdash;Wonder what Max Gottlieb's doing this evening? The old German
  crank! I'll bet&mdash;I'll bet he's talking music or something with some
  terrible highbrow bunch. Wouldn't you like to see the old coot again? You
  know, just couple minutes. D'I ever tell you about the time I made the dandy
  stain of the trypanosomes&mdash;Oh, did I?"</p>

  <p>He assumed that with the temporary closing of the dairy the matter was
  ended. He did not understand how hurt was Klopchuk. He knew that Irving
  Watters, Klopchuk's physician, was unpleasant when they met, grumbling,
  "What's the use going on being an alarmist, Mart?" But he did not know how
  many persons in Nautilus had been trustily informed that this fellow
  Arrowsmith was in the pay of labor-union thugs.</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">Two months before, when Martin had been making his annual
  inspection of factories, he had encountered Clay Tredgold, the president (by
  inheritance) of the Steel Windmill Company. He had heard that Tredgold, an
  elaborate but easy-spoken man of forty-five, moved as one clad in purple on
  the loftiest planes of Nautilus society. After the inspection Tredgold urged,
  "Sit down, Doctor; have a cigar and tell me all about sanitation."</p>

  <p>Martin was wary. There was in Tredgold's affable eye a sardonic
  flicker.</p>

  <p>"What d'you want to know about sanitation?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, all about it."</p>

  <p>"The only thing I know is that your men must like you. Of course you
  haven't enough wash-bowls in that second-floor toilet room, and the whole lot
  of 'em swore you were putting in others immediately. If they like you enough
  to lie against their own interests, you must be a good boss, and I think I'll
  let you get away with it&mdash;till my next inspection! Well, got to
  hustle."</p>

  <p>Tredgold beamed on him. "My dear man, I've been pulling that dodge on
  Pickerbaugh for three years. I'm glad to have seen you. And I think I really
  may put in some more bowls&mdash;just before your next inspection.
  Good-by!"</p>

  <p>After the Klopchuk affair, Martin and Leora encountered Clay Tredgold and
  that gorgeous slim woman, his wife, in front of a motion-picture theater.</p>

  <p>"Give you a lift, Doctor?" cried Tredgold.</p>

  <p>On the way he suggested, "I don't know whether you're dry, like
  Pickerbaugh, but if you'd like I'll run you out to the house and present you
  with the noblest cocktail conceived since Evangeline County went dry. Does it
  sound reasonable?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't heard anything so reasonable for years," said Martin.</p>

  <p>The Tredgold house was on the highest knoll (fully twenty feet above the
  general level of the plain) in Ashford Grove, which is the Back Bay of
  Nautilus. It was a Colonial structure, with a sun-parlor, a white-paneled
  hall, and a blue and silver drawing-room. Martin tried to look casual as they
  were wafted in on Mrs. Tredgold's chatter, but it was the handsomest house he
  had ever entered.</p>

  <p>While Leora sat on the edge of her chair in the manner of one likely to be
  sent home, and Mrs. Tredgold sat forward like a hostess, Tredgold flourished
  the cocktail-shaker and performed courtesies:</p>

  <p>"How long you been here now, Doctor?"</p>

  <p>"Almost a year."</p>

  <p>"Try that. Look here, it strikes me you're kind of different from
  Salvation Pickerbaugh."</p>

  <p>Martin felt that he ought to praise his chief but, to Leora's gratified
  amazement, he sprang up and ranted in something like Pickerbaugh's best
  manner:</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen of the Steel Windmill Industries, than which there is no other
  that has so largely contributed to the prosperity of our commonwealth, while
  I realize that you are getting away with every infraction of the health laws
  that the inspector doesn't catch you at, yet I desire to pay a tribute to
  your high respect for sanitation, patriotism, and cocktails, and if I only
  had an assistant more earnest than young Arrowsmith, I should, with your
  permission, become President of the United States."</p>

  <p>Tredgold clapped. Mrs. Tredgold asserted, "If that isn't exactly like Dr.
  Pickerbaugh!" Leora looked proud, and so did her husband.</p>

  <p>"I'm so glad you're free from this socialistic clap-trap of
  Pickerbaugh's," said Tredgold.</p>

  <p>The assumption roused something sturdy and defensive in Martin:</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't care a hang how socialistic he is&mdash;whatever that means.
  Don't know anything about socialism. But since I've gone and given an
  imitation of him&mdash;I suppose it was probably disloyal&mdash;I must say
  I'm not very fond of oratory that's so full of energy it hasn't any room for
  facts. But mind you, Tredgold, it's partly the fault of people like your
  Manufacturers' Association. You encourage him to rant. I'm a laboratory
  man&mdash;or rather, I sometimes wish I were. I like to deal with exact
  figures."</p>

  <p>"So do I. I was keen on mathematics in Williams," said Tredgold.</p>

  <p>Instantly Martin and he were off on education, damning the universities
  for turning out graduates like sausages. Martin found himself becoming
  confidential about "variables," and Tredgold proclaimed that he had not
  wanted to take up the ancestral factory, but to specialize in astronomy.</p>

  <p>Leora was confessing to the friendly Mrs. Tredgold how cautiously the wife
  of an assistant director has to economize and with that caressing voice of
  hers Mrs. Tredgold comforted, "I know. I was horribly hard-up after Dad died.
  Have you tried the little Swedish dressmaker on Crimmins Street, two doors
  from the Catholic church? She's awfully clever, and so cheap."</p>

  <p>Martin had found, for the first time since marriage, a house in which he
  was altogether happy; Leora had found, in a woman with the easy smartness
  which she had always feared and hated, the first woman to whom she could talk
  of God and the price of toweling. They came out from themselves and were not
  laughed at.</p>

  <p>It was at midnight, when the charms of bacteriology and toweling were
  becoming pallid, that outside the house sounded a whooping, wheezing motor
  horn, and in lumbered a ruddy fat man who was introduced as Mr. Schlemihl,
  president of the Cornbelt Insurance Company of Nautilus.</p>

  <p>Even more than Clay Tredgold was he a leader of the Ashford Grove
  aristocracy, but, while he stood like an invading barbarian in the blue and
  silver room, Schlemihl was cordial:</p>

  <p>"Glad meet yuh, Doctor. Well, say, Clay, I'm tickled to death you've found
  another highbrow to gas with. Me, Arrowsmith, I'm simply a poor old insurance
  salesman. Clay is always telling me what an illiterate boob I am. Look here,
  Clay darling, do I get a cocktail or don't I? I seen your lights! I seen you
  in here telling what a smart guy you are! Come on! <i>Mix!</i>"</p>

  <p>Tredgold mixed, extensively. Before he had finished, young Monte Mugford,
  great-grandson of the sainted but side-whiskered Nathaniel Mugford who had
  founded Mugford College, also came in, uninvited. He wondered at the presence
  of Martin, found him human, told him he was human, and did his rather
  competent best to catch up on the cocktails.</p>

  <p>Thus it happened that at three in the morning Martin was singing to a
  commendatory audience the ballad he had learned from Gustaf
  Sondelius:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">She'd a dark and a roving eye,<br>
  And her hair hung down in ringlets,<br>
  A nice girl, a decent girl,<br>
  But one of the rakish kind.</p><br>

  <p>At four, the Arrowsmiths had been accepted by the most desperately Smart
  Set of Nautilus, and at four-thirty they were driven home, at a speed neither
  legal nor kind, by Clay Tredgold.</p><br>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">There was in Nautilus a country club which was the axis of
  what they called Society, but there was also a tribe of perhaps twelve
  families in the Ashford Grove section who, though they went to the country
  club for golf, condescended to other golfers, kept to themselves, and
  considered themselves as belonging more to Chicago than to Nautilus. They
  took turns in entertaining one another. They assumed that they were all
  welcome at any party given by any of them, and to none of their parties was
  anyone outside the Group invited except migrants from larger cities and
  occasional free lances like Martin. They were a tight little garrison in a
  heathen town.</p>

  <p>The members of the Group were very rich, and one of them, Montgomery
  Mugford, knew something about his great-grandfather. They lived in Tudor
  manor houses and Italian villas so new that the scarred lawns had only begun
  to grow. They had large cars and larger cellars, though the cellars contained
  nothing but gin, whisky, vermouth, and a few sacred bottles of rather sweet
  champagne. Everyone in the Group was familiar with New York&mdash;they stayed
  at the St. Regis or the Plaza and went about buying clothes and discovering
  small smart restaurants&mdash;and five of the twelve couples had been in
  Europe; had spent a week in Paris, intending to go to art galleries and
  actually going to the more expensive fool-traps of Montmartre.</p>

  <p>In the Group Martin and Leora found themselves welcomed as poor relations.
  They were invited to choric dinners, to Sunday lunches at the country club.
  Whatever the event, it always ended in rapidly motoring somewhere, having a
  number of drinks, and insisting that Martin again "give that imitation of Doc
  Pickerbaugh."</p>

  <p>Besides motoring, drinking, and dancing to the Victrola, the chief
  diversion of the Group was cards. Curiously, in this completely unmoral set,
  there were no flirtations; they talked with considerable freedom about "sex,"
  but they all seemed monogamic, all happily married or afraid to appear
  unhappily married. But when Martin knew them better he heard murmurs of
  husbands having "times" in Chicago, of wives picking up young men in New York
  hotels, and he scented furious restlessness beneath their superior sexual
  calm.</p>

  <p>It is not known whether Martin ever completely accepted as a
  gentleman-scholar the Clay Tredgold who was devoted to everything about
  astronomy except studying it, or Monte Mugford as the highly descended
  aristocrat, but he did admire the Group's motor cars, shower baths, Fifth
  Avenue frocks, tweed plus-fours, and houses somewhat impersonally decorated
  by daffodillic young men from Chicago. He discovered sauces and old silver.
  He began to consider Leora's clothes not merely as convenient coverings, but
  as a possible expression of charm, and irritably he realized how careless she
  was.</p>

  <p>In Nautilus, alone, rarely saying much about herself, Leora had developed
  an intense mute little life of her own. She belonged to a bridge club, and
  she went solemnly by herself to the movies, but her ambition was to know
  France and it engrossed her. It was an old desire, mysterious in source and
  long held secret, but suddenly she was sighing:</p>

  <p>"Sandy, the one thing I want to do, maybe ten years from now, is to see
  Touraine and Normandy and Carcassonne. Could we, do you think?"</p>

  <p>Rarely had Leora asked for anything. He was touched and puzzled as he
  watched her reading books on Brittany, as he caught her, over a highly
  simplified French grammar, breathing "J'ay&mdash;j'aye&mdash;damn it,
  whatever it is!"</p>

  <p>He crowed, "Lee, dear if you want to go to France&mdash;Listen! Some day
  we'll shoot over there with a couple of knapsacks on our backs, and we'll see
  that ole country from end to end!"</p>

  <p>Gratefully yet doubtfully: "You know if you got bored, Sandy, you could go
  see the work at the Pasteur Institute. Oh, I would like to tramp, just once,
  between high plastered walls, and come to a foolish little cafe and watch the
  men with funny red sashes and floppy blue pants go by. Really, do you think
  maybe we could?"</p>

  <p>Leora was strangely popular in the Ashford Grove Group, though she
  possessed nothing of what Martin called their "elegance." She always had at
  least one button missing. Mrs. Tredgold, best natured as she was least pious
  of women, adopted her complete.</p>

  <p>Nautilus had always doubted Clara Tredgold. Mrs. Almus Pickerbaugh said
  that she "took no part in any movement for the betterment of the city." For
  years she had seemed content to grow her roses, to make her startling hats,
  to almond-cream her lovely hands, and listen to her husband's improper
  stories&mdash;and for years she had been a lonely woman. In Leora she
  perceived an interested casualness equal to her own. The two women spent
  afternoons sitting on the sun-porch, reading, doing their nails, smoking
  cigarettes, saying nothing, trusting each other.</p>

  <p>With the other women of the Group Leora was never so intimate as with
  Clara Tredgold, but they liked her, the more because she was a heretic whose
  vices, her smoking, her indolence, her relish of competent profanity,
  disturbed Mrs. Pickerbaugh and Mrs. Irving Watters. The Group rather approved
  all unconventionalities&mdash;except such economic unconventionalities as
  threatened their easy wealth. Leora had tea, or a cocktail, alone with
  nervous young Mrs. Monte Mugford, who had been the lightest-footed debutante
  in Des Moines four years before and who hated now the coming of her second
  baby; and it was to Leora that Mrs. Schlemihl, though publicly she was
  rompish and serene with her porker of a husband, burst out, "If that man
  would only quit pawing me&mdash;reaching for me&mdash;slobbering on me! I
  hate it here! I <i>will</i> have my winter in New York&mdash;alone!"</p>

  <p>The childish Martin Arrowsmith, so unworthy of Leora's old quiet wisdoms,
  was not content with her acceptance by the Group. When she appeared with a
  hook unfastened or her hair like a crow's nest, he worried, and said things
  about her "sloppiness" which he later regretted.</p>

  <p>"Why can't you take a little time to make yourself attractive? God knows
  you haven't anything else to do! Great Jehoshaphat, can't you even sew on
  buttons?"</p>

  <p>But Clara Tredgold laughed, "Leora, I do think you have the sweetest back,
  but do you mind if I pin you up before the others come?"</p>

  <p>It happened after a party which lasted till two, when Mrs. Schlemihl had
  worn the new frock from Lucile's and Jack Brundidge (by day vice-president
  and sales-manager of the Maize Mealies Company) had danced what he
  belligerently asserted to be a Finnish polka, that when Martin and Leora were
  driving home in a borrowed Health Department car he snarled, "Lee, why can't
  you ever take any trouble with what you wear? Here this morning&mdash;or
  yesterday morning&mdash;you were going to mend that blue dress, and as far as
  I can figure out you haven't done a darn' thing the whole day but sit around
  and read, and then you come out with that ratty embroidery&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Will you stop the car!" she cried.</p>

  <p>He stopped it, astonished. The headlights made ridiculously important a
  barbed-wire fence, a litter of milkweeds, a bleak reach of gravel road.</p>

  <p>She demanded, "Do you want me to become a harem beauty? I could. I could
  be a floosey. But I've never taken the trouble. Oh, Sandy, I won't go on
  fighting with you. Either I'm the foolish sloppy wife that I am, or I'm
  nothing. What do you want? Do you want a real princess like Clara Tredgold,
  or do you want me, that don't care a hang where we go or what we do as long
  as we stand by each other? You do such a lot of worrying. I'm tired of it.
  Come on now. What do you want?"</p>

  <p>"I don't want anything but you. But can't you understand&mdash;I'm not
  just a climber&mdash;I want us both to be equal to anything we run into. I
  certainly don't see why we should be inferior to this bunch, in
  <i>anything</i>. Darling, except for Clara, maybe, they're nothing but rich
  bookkeepers! But we're real soldiers of fortune. Your France that you love so
  much&mdash;some day we'll go there, and the French President will be at the
  N.P. depot to meet us! Why should we let anybody do anything better than we
  can? Technique!"</p>

  <p>They talked for an hour in that drab place, between the poisonous lines of
  barbed wire.</p>

  <p>Next day, when Orchid came into his laboratory and begged, with the
  wistfulness of youth, "Oh, Dr. Martin, aren't you ever coming to the house
  again?" he kissed her so briskly, so cheerfully, that even a flapper could
  perceive that she was unimportant.</p><br>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="first">Martin realized that he was likely to be the next Director
  of the Department. Pickerbaugh had told him, "Your work is very satisfactory.
  There's only one thing you lack, my boy: enthusiasm for getting together with
  folks and giving a long pull and a strong pull, all together. But perhaps
  that'll come to you when you have more responsibility."</p>

  <p>Martin sought to acquire a delight in giving long strong pulls all
  together, but he felt like a man who has been dragooned into wearing yellow
  tights at a civic pageant.</p>

  <p>"Gosh, I may be up against it when I become Director," he fretted. "I
  wonder if there's people who become what's called 'successful' and then hate
  it? Well, anyway, I'll start a decent system of vital statistics in the
  department before they get me. I won't lay down! I'll fight! I'll make myself
  succeed!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">It may have been a yearning to give one concentrated dose of
  inspiration so powerful that no citizen of Nautilus would ever again dare to
  be ill, or perhaps Dr. Pickerbaugh desired a little reasonable publicity for
  his congressional campaign, but certainly the Health Fair which the good man
  organized was overpowering.</p>

  <p>He got an extra appropriation from the Board of Aldermen; he bullied all
  the churches and associations into co-operation; he made the newspapers
  promise to publish three columns of praise each day.</p>

  <p>He rented the rather dilapidated wooden "tabernacle" in which the Reverend
  Mr. Billy Sunday, an evangelist, had recently wiped out all the sin in the
  community. He arranged for a number of novel features. The Boy Scouts were to
  give daily drills. There was a W.C.T.U. booth at which celebrated clergymen
  and other physiologists would demonstrate the evils of alcohol. In a
  bacteriology booth, the protesting Martin (in a dinky white coat) was to do
  jolly things with test-tubes. An anti-nicotine lady from Chicago offered to
  kill a mouse every half-hour by injecting ground-up cigarette paper into it.
  The Pickerbaugh twins, Arbuta and Gladiola, now aged six, were to show the
  public how to brush its teeth, and in fact they did, until a sixty-year-old
  farmer of whom they had lovingly inquired, "Do you brush your teeth daily?"
  made thunderous answer, "No, but I'm going to paddle your bottoms daily, and
  I'm going to start in right now."</p>

  <p>None of these novelties was so stirring as the Eugenic Family, who had
  volunteered to give, for a mere forty dollars a day, an example of the
  benefits of healthful practices.</p>

  <p>They were father, mother, and five children, all so beautiful and powerful
  that they had recently been presenting refined acrobatic exhibitions on the
  Chautauqua Circuit. None of them smoked, drank, spit upon pavements, used
  foul language, or ate meat. Pickerbaugh assigned to them the chief booth on
  the platform once sacerdotally occupied by the Reverend Mr. Sunday.</p>

  <p>There were routine exhibits: booths with charts and banners and leaflets.
  The Pickerbaugh Healthette Octette held song recitals, and daily there were
  lectures, most of them by Pickerbaugh or by his friend Dr. Bissex, football
  coach and professor of hygiene and most other subjects in Mugford
  College.</p>

  <p>A dozen celebrities, including Gustaf Sondelius and the governor of the
  state, were invited to come and "give their messages," but it happened,
  unfortunately, that none of them seemed able to get away that particular
  week.</p>

  <p>The Health Fair opened with crowds and success. There was a slight
  misunderstanding the first day. The Master Bakers' Association spoke strongly
  to Pickerbaugh about the sign "Too much pie makes pyorrhea" on the diet
  booth. But the thoughtless and prosperity-destroying sign was removed at
  once, and the Fair was thereafter advertised in every bakery in town.</p>

  <p>The only unhappy participant, apparently, was Martin. Pickerbaugh had
  fitted up for him an exhibition laboratory which, except that it had no
  running water and except that the fire laws forbade his using any kind of a
  flame, was exactly like a real one. All day long he poured a solution of red
  ink from one test-tube into another, with his microscope carefully examined
  nothing at all, and answered the questions of persons who wished to know how
  you put bacterias to death once you had caught them swimming about.</p>

  <p>Leora appeared as his assistant, very pretty and demure in a nurse's
  costume, very exasperating as she chuckled at his low cursing. They found one
  friend, the fireman on duty, a splendid person with stories about pet cats in
  the fire-house and no tendency to ask questions in bacteriology. It was he
  who showed them how they could smoke in safety. Behind the Clean Up and
  Prevent Fires exhibit, consisting of a miniature Dirty House with red arrows
  to show where a fire might start and an extremely varnished Clean House,
  there was an alcove with a broken window which would carry off the smoke of
  their cigarettes. To this sanctuary Martin, Leora, and the bored fireman
  retired a dozen times a day, and thus wore through the week.</p>

  <p>One other misfortune occurred. The detective sergeant coming in not to
  detect but to see the charming spectacle of the mouse dying in agony from
  cigarette paper, stopped before the booth of the Eugenic Family, scratched
  his head, hastened to the police station, and returned with certain pictures.
  He growled to Pickerbaugh:</p>

  <p>"Hm. That Eugenic Family. Don't smoke or booze or anything?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely! And look at their perfect health."</p>

  <p>"Hm. Better keep an eye on 'em. I won't spoil your show, Doc&mdash;we
  fellows at City Hall had all ought to stick together. I won't run 'em out of
  town till after the Fair. But they're the Holton gang. The man and woman
  ain't married, and only one of the kids is theirs. They've done time for
  selling licker to the Indians, but their specialty, before they went into
  education, used to be the badger game. I'll detail a plain-clothes man to
  keep 'em straight. Fine show you got here, Doc. Ought to give this city a
  lasting lesson in the value of up-to-date health methods. Good luck! Say,
  have you picked your secretary yet, for when you get to Congress? I've got a
  nephew that's a crackajack stenographer and a bright kid and knows how to
  keep his mouth shut about stuff that don't concern him. I'll send him around
  to have a talk with you. So long."</p>

  <p>But, except that once he caught the father of the Eugenic Family relieving
  the strain of being publicly healthy by taking a long, gurgling, ecstatic
  drink from a flask, Pickerbaugh found nothing wrong in their conduct, till
  Saturday. There was nothing wrong with anything, till then.</p>

  <p>Never had a Fair been such a moral lesson, or secured so much publicity.
  Every newspaper in the congressional district gave columns to it, and all the
  accounts, even in the Democratic papers, mentioned Pickerbaugh's
  campaign.</p>

  <p>Then, on Saturday, the last day of the Fair, came tragedy.</p>

  <p>There was terrific rain, the roof leaked without restraint, and the lady
  in charge of the Healthy Housing Booth, which also leaked, was taken home
  threatened with pneumonia. At noon, when the Eugenic Family were giving a
  demonstration of perfect vigor, their youngest blossom had an epileptic fit,
  and before the excitement was over, upon the Chicago anti-nicotine lady as
  she triumphantly assassinated a mouse charged an anti-vivisection lady, also
  from Chicago.</p>

  <p>Round the two ladies and the unfortunate mouse gathered a crowd. The
  anti-vivisection lady called the anti-nicotine lady a murderer, a wretch, and
  an atheist, all of which the anti-nicotine lady endured, merely weeping a
  little and calling for the police. But when the anti-vivisection lady wound
  up, "And as for your pretensions to know anything about science, you're no
  scientist at all!" then with a shriek the anti-nicotine lady leaped from her
  platform, dug her fingers into the anti-vivisection lady's hair, and observed
  with distinctness, "I'll show you whether I know anything about science!"</p>

  <p>Pickerbaugh tried to separate them. Martin, standing happily with Leora
  and their friend the fireman on the edge, distinctly did not. Both ladies
  turned on Pickerbaugh and denounced him, and when they had been removed he
  was the center of a thousand chuckles, in decided danger of never going to
  Congress.</p>

  <p>At two o'clock, when the rain had slackened, when the after-lunch crowd
  had come in and the story of the anti ladies was running strong, the fireman
  retired behind the Clean Up and Prevent Fires exhibit for his hourly smoke.
  He was a very sleepy and unhappy little fireman; he was thinking about the
  pleasant fire-house and the unending games of pinochle. He dropped the match,
  unextinguished on the back porch of the model Clean House. The Clean House
  had been so handsomely oiled that it was like kindling soaked in kerosene. It
  flared up, and instantly the huge and gloomy Tabernacle was hysterical with
  flames. The crowd rushed toward the exits.</p>

  <p>Naturally, most of the original exits of the Tabernacle had been blocked
  by booths. There was a shrieking panic, and children were being trampled.</p>

  <p>Almus Pickerbaugh was neither a coward nor slothful. Suddenly, coming from
  nowhere, he was marching through the Tabernacle at the head of his eight
  daughters, singing "Dixie," his head up, his eyes terrible, his arms wide in
  pleading. The crowd weakly halted. With the voice of a clipper captain he
  unsnarled them and ushered them safely out, then charged back into the
  spouting flames.</p>

  <p>The rain-soaked building had not caught. The fireman, with Martin and the
  head of the Eugenic Family, was beating the flames. Nothing was destroyed
  save the Clean House, and the crowd which had fled in agony came back in
  wonder. Their hero was Pickerbaugh.</p>

  <p>Within two hours the Nautilus papers vomited specials which explained that
  not merely had Pickerbaugh organized the greatest lesson in health ever seen,
  but he had also, by his courage and his power to command, saved hundreds of
  people from being crushed, which latter was probably the only completely
  accurate thing that has been said about Dr. Almus Pickerbaugh in ten thousand
  columns of newspaper publicity.</p>

  <p>Whether to see the Fair, Pickerbaugh, the delightful ravages of a
  disaster, or another fight between the anti ladies, half the city struggled
  into the Tabernacle that evening, and when Pickerbaugh took the platform for
  his closing lecture he was greeted with frenzy. Next day, when he galloped
  into the last week of his campaign, he was overlord of all the
  district.</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">His opponent was a snuffy little lawyer whose strength lay
  in his training. He had been state senator, lieutenant governor, county
  judge. But the Democratic slogan, "Pickerbaugh the Pick-up Candidate," was
  drowned in the admiration for the hero of the health fair. He dashed about in
  motors, proclaiming, "I am not running because I want office, but because I
  want the chance to take to the whole nation my ideals of health." Everywhere
  was plastered:</p><br>

  <p class="sign">For Congress<br>
  <i>Pickerbaugh</i><br>
  The two-fisted fighting poet doc</p>

  <p class="sign">Just elect him for a term<br>
  And all through the nation he'll swat the germ.</p><br>

  <p>Enormous meetings were held. Pickerbaugh was ample and vague about his
  Policies. Yes, he was opposed to our entering the European War, but he
  assured them, he certainly did assure them, that he was for using every power
  of our Government to end this terrible calamity. Yes, he was for high tariff,
  but it must be so adjusted that the farmers in his district could buy
  everything cheaply. Yes, he was for high wages for each and every workman,
  but he stood like a rock, like a boulder, like a moraine, for protecting the
  prosperity of all manufacturers, merchants, and real-estate owners.</p>

  <p>While this larger campaign thundered, there was proceeding in Nautilus a
  smaller and much defter campaign, to re-elect as mayor one Mr. Pugh,
  Pickerbaugh's loving chief. Mr. Pugh sat nicely at desks, and he was pleasant
  and promissory to everybody who came to see him; clergymen, gamblers, G.A.R.
  veterans, circus advance-agents, policemen, and ladies of reasonable
  virtue&mdash;everybody except perhaps socialist agitators, against whom he
  staunchly protected the embattled city. In his speeches Pickerbaugh commended
  Pugh for "that firm integrity and ready sympathy with which His Honor had
  backed up every movement for the public weal," and when Pickerbaugh (quite
  honestly) begged, "Mr. Mayor, if I go to Congress you must appoint Arrowsmith
  in my place; he knows nothing about politics but he's incorruptible," then
  Pugh gave his promise, and amity abode in that land...Nobody said anything at
  all about Mr. F. X. Jordan.</p>

  <p>F. X. Jordan was a contractor with a generous interest in politics.
  Pickerbaugh called him a grafter, and the last time Pugh had been
  elected&mdash;it had been on a Reform Platform, though since that time the
  reform had been coaxed to behave itself and be practical&mdash;both Pugh and
  Pickerbaugh had denounced Jordan as a "malign force." But so kindly was Mayor
  Pugh that in the present election he said nothing that could hurt Mr.
  Jordan's feelings, and in return what could Mr. Jordan do but speak
  forgivingly about Mr. Pugh to the people in blind-pigs and houses of ill
  fame?</p>

  <p>On the evening of the election, Martin and Leora were among the company
  awaiting the returns at the Pickerbaughs'. They were confident. Martin had
  never been roused by politics, but he was stirred now by Pickerbaugh's
  twitchy pretense of indifference, by the telephoned report from the newspaper
  office, "Here's Willow Grove township&mdash;Pickerbaugh leading, two to one!"
  by the crowds which went past the house howling, "Pickerbaugh, Pickerbaugh,
  Pickerbaugh!"</p>

  <p>At eleven the victory was certain, and Martin, his bowels weak with
  unconfidence, realized that he was now Director of Public Health, with
  responsibility for seventy thousand lives.</p>

  <p>He looked wistfully toward Leora and in her still smile found
  assurance.</p>

  <p>Orchid had been airy and distant with Martin all evening, and dismayingly
  chatty and affectionate with Leora. Now she drew him into the back parlor and
  "So I'm going off to Washington&mdash;and you don't care a bit!" she said,
  her eyes blurred and languorous and undefended. He held her, muttering, "You
  darling child, I can't let you go!" As he walked home he thought less of
  being Director than of Orchid's eyes.</p>

  <p>In the morning he groaned, "Doesn't anybody ever learn anything? Must I
  watch myself and still be a fool, all my life? Doesn't any story ever
  end?"</p>

  <p>He never saw her afterward, except on the platform of the train.</p>

  <p>Leora surprisingly reflected, after the Pickerbaughs had gone, "Sandy
  dear, I know how you feel about losing your Orchid. It's sort of Youth going.
  She really is a peach. Honestly, I can appreciate how you feel, and
  sympathize with you&mdash;I mean, of course, providin' you aren't ever going
  to see her again."</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">Over the Nautilus Cornfield's announcement was the vigorous
  headline:</p><br>

  <p class="headline"><i>ALMUS PICKERBAUGH WINS</i><br>
  FIRST SCIENTIST EVER ELECTED<br>
  TO CONGRESS</p>

  <p class="headline">SIDE-KICK OF DARWIN AND PASTEUR<br>
  GIVES NEW PUNCH TO STEERING<br>
  SHIP OF STATE</p><br>

  <p>Pickerbaugh's resignation was to take effect at once; he was, he
  explained, going to Washington before his term began, to study legislative
  methods and start his propaganda for the creation of a national Secretaryship
  of Health. There was a considerable struggle over the appointment of Martin
  in his stead. Klopchuk the dairyman was bitter; Irving Watters whispered to
  fellow doctors that Martin was likely to extend the socialistic free clinics;
  F. X. Jordan had a sensible young doctor as his own candidate. It was the
  Ashford Grove Group, Tredgold, Schlemihl, Monte Mugford, who brought it
  off.</p>

  <p>Martin went to Tredgold worrying, "Do the people want me? Shall I fight
  Jordan or get out?"</p>

  <p>Tredgold said balmily, "Fight? What about? I own a good share of the bank
  that's lent various handy little sums to Mayor Pugh. You leave it to me."</p>

  <p>Next day Martin was appointed, but only as Acting Director, with a salary
  of thirty-five hundred instead of four thousand.</p>

  <p>That he had been put in by what he would have called "crooked politics"
  did not occur to him.</p>

  <p>Mayor Pugh called him in and chuckled:</p>

  <p>"Doc, there's been a certain amount of opposition to you, because you're
  pretty young and not many folks know you. I haven't any doubt I can give you
  the full appointment later&mdash;if we find you're competent and popular.
  Meantime you better avoid doing anything brash. Just come and ask my advice.
  I know this town and the people that count better than you do."</p><br>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">The day of Pickerbaugh's leaving for Washington was made a
  fiesta. At the Armory, from twelve to two, the Chamber of Commerce gave to
  everybody who came a lunch of hot wienies, doughnuts, and coffee, with
  chewing gum for the women and, for the men, Schweinhugel's Little Dandy
  Nautilus-made Cheroots.</p>

  <p>The train left at three-fifty-five. The station was, to the astonishment
  of innocent passengers gaping from the train windows, jammed with
  thousands.</p>

  <p>By the rear platform, on a perilous packing box, Mayor Pugh held forth.
  The Nautilus Silver Cornet Band played three patriotic selections, then
  Pickerbaugh stood on the platform, his family about him. As he looked on the
  crowd, tears were in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"For once," he stammered, "I guess I can't make a speech. D-darn it, I'm
  all choked up! I meant to orate a lot, but all I can say is&mdash;I love you
  all, I'm mighty grateful, I'll represent you my level best, neighbors! God
  bless you!"</p>

  <p>The train moved out, Pickerbaugh waving as long as he could see them.</p>

  <p>And Martin to Leora, "Oh, he's a fine old boy. He&mdash;No, I'm hanged if
  he is! The world's always letting people get away with asininities because
  they're kind-hearted. And here I've sat back like a coward, not saying a
  word, and watched 'em loose that wind-storm on the whole country. Oh, curse
  it, isn't anything in the world simple? Well, let's go to the office, and
  I'll begin to do things conscientiously and all wrong."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">It cannot be said that Martin showed any large ability for
  organization, but under him the Department of Public Health changed
  completely. He chose as his assistant Dr. Rufus Ockford, a lively youngster
  recommended by Dean Silva of Winnemac. The routine work, examination of
  babies, quarantines, anti-tuberculosis placarding, went on as before.</p>

  <p>Inspection of plumbing and food was perhaps more thorough, because Martin
  lacked Pickerbaugh's buoyant faith in the lay inspectors, and one of them he
  replaced, to the considerable displeasure of the colony of Germans in the
  Homedale district. Also he gave thought to the killing of rats and fleas, and
  he regarded the vital statistics as something more than a recording of births
  and deaths. He had notions about their value which were most amusing to the
  health department clerk. He wanted a record of the effect of race,
  occupation, and a dozen other factors upon the disease rate.</p>

  <p>The chief difference was that Martin and Rufus Ockford found themselves
  with plenty of leisure. Martin estimated that Pickerbaugh must have used half
  his time in being inspirational and eloquent.</p>

  <p>He made his first mistake in assigning Ockford to spend part of the week
  in the free city clinic, in addition to the two half-time physicians. There
  was fury in the Evangeline County Medical Society. At a restaurant, Irving
  Watters came over to Martin's table.</p>

  <p>"I hear you've increased the clinic staff," said Dr. Watters.</p>

  <p>"Yuh."</p>

  <p>"Thinking of increasing it still more?"</p>

  <p>"Might be a good idea."</p>

  <p>"Now you see here, Mart. As you know, Mrs. Watters and I have done
  everything in our power to make you and Leora welcome. Glad to do anything I
  can for a fellow alumnus of old Winnemac. But at the same time, there are
  limits, you know! Not that I've got any objection to your providing free
  clinical facilities. Don't know but what it's a good thing to treat the
  damn', lazy, lousy pauper-class free, and keep the D.B.'s off the books of
  the regular physicians. But same <i>time</i>, when you begin to make a
  practice of encouraging a lot of folks, that can afford to pay, to go and get
  free treatment, and practically you attack the integrity of the physicians of
  this city, that have been giving God knows how much of their time to
  charity&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Martin answered neither wisely nor competently: "Irve, sweetheart, you can
  go straight to hell!"</p>

  <p>After that hour, when they met there was nothing said between them.</p>

  <p>Without disturbing his routine work, he found himself able to sink
  blissfully into the laboratory. At first he merely tinkered, but suddenly he
  was in full cry, oblivious of everything save his experiment.</p>

  <p>He was playing with cultures isolated from various dairies and various
  people, thinking mostly of Klopchuk and streptococcus. Accidentally he
  discovered the lavish production of hemolysin in sheep's blood as compared
  with the blood of other animals. Why should streptococcus dissolve the red
  blood corpuscles of sheep more easily than those of rabbits?</p>

  <p>It is true that a busy health-department bacteriologist has no right to
  waste the public time in being curious, but the irresponsible sniffing beagle
  in Martin drove out the faithful routineer.</p>

  <p>He neglected the examination of an ominously increasing number of
  tubercular sputums; he set out to answer the question of the hemolysin. He
  wanted the streptococcus to produce its blood-destroying poison in
  twenty-four-hour cultures.</p>

  <p>He beautifully and excitedly failed, and sat for hours meditating. He
  tried a six-hour culture. He mixed the supernatant fluid from a centrifugated
  culture with a suspension of red blood corpuscles and placed it in the
  incubator. When he returned, two hours later, the blood cells were
  dissolved.</p>

  <p>He telephoned to Leora: "Lee! Got something! C'n you pack up sandwich and
  come down here f'r evening?"</p>

  <p>"Sure," said Leora.</p>

  <p>When she appeared he explained to her that his discovery was accidental,
  that most scientific discoveries were accidental, and that no investigator,
  however great, could do anything more than see the value of his chance
  results.</p>

  <p>He sounded mature and rather angry.</p>

  <p>Leora sat in the corner, scratching her chin, reading a medical journal.
  From time to time she reheated coffee, over a doubtful Bunsen flame. When the
  office staff arrived in the morning they found something that had but rarely
  occurred during the regime of Almus Pickerbaugh: the Director of the
  Department was transplanting cultures, and on a long table was his wife,
  asleep.</p>

  <p>Martin blared at Dr. Ockford, "Get t'hell out of this, Rufus, and take
  charge of the department for today&mdash;I'm out&mdash;I'm dead&mdash;and oh,
  say, get Leora home and fry her a couple o' eggs, and you might bring me a
  Denver sandwich from the Sunset Trail Lunch, will you?"</p>

  <p>"You bet, chief," said Ockford.</p>

  <p>Martin repeated his experiment, testing the cultures for hemolysin after
  two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve, fourteen, sixteen, and eighteen hours of
  incubation. He discovered that the maximum production of hemolysin occurred
  between four and ten hours. He began to work out the formula of
  production&mdash;and he was desolate. He fumed, raged, sweated. He found that
  his mathematics was childish, and all his science rusty. He pottered with
  chemistry, he ached over his mathematics, and slowly he began to assemble his
  results. He believed that he might have a paper for the Journal of Infectious
  Diseases.</p>

  <p>Now Almus Pickerbaugh had published scientific papers&mdash;often. He had
  published them in the Midwest Medical Quarterly, of which he was one of
  fourteen editors. He had discovered the germ of epilepsy and the germ of
  cancer&mdash;two entirely different germs of cancer. Usually it took him a
  fortnight to make the discovery, write the report, and have it accepted.
  Martin lacked this admirable facility.</p>

  <p>He experimented, he re-experimented, he cursed, he kept Leora out of bed,
  he taught her to make media, and was ill-pleased by her opinions on agar. He
  was violent to the stenographer; not once could the pastor of the Jonathan
  Edwards Congregational Church get him to address the Bible Class; and still
  for months his paper was not complete.</p>

  <p>The first to protest was His Honor the Mayor. Returning from an extremely
  agreeable game of chemin de fer with F. X. Jordan, taking a short cut through
  the alley behind the City Hall, Mayor Pugh saw Martin at two in the morning
  drearily putting test-tubes in the incubator, while Leora sat in a corner
  smoking. Next day he summoned Martin, and protested.</p>

  <p>"Doc, I don't want to butt in on your department&mdash;my specialty is
  never butting in&mdash;but it certainly strikes me that after being trained
  by a seventy-horse-power booster like Pickerbaugh, you ought to know that
  it's all damn' foolishness to spend so much time in the laboratory, when you
  can hire an A1 laboratory fellow for thirty bucks a week. What you ought to
  be doing is jollying along these sobs that are always panning the
  administration. Get out and talk to the churches and clubs, and help me put
  across the ideas that we stand for."</p>

  <p>"Maybe he's right," Martin considered. "I'm a rotten bacteriologist.
  Probably I never will get this experiment together. My job here is to keep
  tobacco-chewers from spitting. Have I the right to waste the tax-payers'
  money on anything else?"</p>

  <p>But that week he read, as an announcement issued by the McGurk Institute
  of Biology of New York, that Dr. Max Gottlieb had synthesized antibodies in
  vitro.</p>

  <p>He pictured the saturnine Gottlieb not at all enjoying the triumph but,
  with locked door, abusing the papers for their exaggerative reports of his
  work; and as the picture became sharp Martin was like a subaltern stationed
  in a desert isle when he learns that his old regiment is going off to an
  agreeable Border war.</p>

  <p>Then the McCandless fury broke.</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">Mrs. McCandless had once been a "hired girl"; then nurse,
  then confidante, then wife to the invalid Mr. McCandless, wholesale grocer
  and owner of real estate. When he died she inherited everything. There was a
  suit, of course, but she had an excellent lawyer.</p>

  <p>She was a grim, graceless, shady, mean woman, yet a nymphomaniac. She was
  not invited into Nautilus society, but in her unaired parlor, on the mildewed
  couch, she entertained seedy, belching, oldish married men, a young policeman
  to whom she often lent money, and the contractor-politician, F. X.
  Jordan.</p>

  <p>She owned, in Swede Hollow, the filthiest block of tenements in Nautilus.
  Martin had made a tuberculosis map of these tenements, and in conferences
  with Dr. Ockford and Leora he denounced them as murder-holes. He wanted to
  destroy them, but the police power of the Director of Public Health was
  vague. Pickerbaugh had enjoyed the possession of large power only because he
  never used it.</p>

  <p>Martin sought a court decision for the demolition of the McCandless
  tenements. Her lawyer was also the lawyer of F. X. Jordan, and the most
  eloquent witness against Martin was Dr. Irving Watters. But it chanced,
  because of the absence of the proper judge, that the case came before an
  ignorant and honest person who quashed the injunction secured by Mrs.
  McCandless's lawyer and instructed the Department of Public Health that it
  might use such methods as the city ordinances provided for emergencies.</p>

  <p>That evening Martin grumbled to young Ockford, "You don't suppose for a
  moment, do you, Rufus, that McCandless and Jordan won't appeal the case?
  Let's get rid of the tenements while it's comparatively legal, heh?"</p>

  <p>"You bet, chief," said Ockford, and, "Say, let's go out to Oregon and
  start practice when we get kicked out. Well, we can depend on our sanitary
  inspector, anyway. Jordan seduced his sister, here 'bout six years back."</p>

  <p>At dawn a gang headed by Martin and Ockford, in blue overalls, joyful and
  rowdyish, invaded the McCandless tenements, drove the tenants into the
  street, and began to tear down the flimsy buildings. At noon, when lawyers
  appeared and the tenants were in new flats commandeered by Martin, the
  wreckers set fire to the lower stories, and in half an hour the buildings had
  been annihilated.</p>

  <p>F. X. Jordan came to the scene after lunch. A filthy Martin and a dusty
  Ockford were drinking coffee brought by Leora.</p>

  <p>"Well, boys," said Jordan, "you've put it all over us. Only if you ever
  pull this kind of stunt again, use dynamite and save a lot of time. You know,
  I like you boys&mdash;I'm sorry for what I've got to do to you. But may the
  saints help you, because it's just a question of time when I learn you not to
  monkey with the buzz-saw."</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">Clay Tredgold admired their amateur arson and rejoiced,
  "Fine! I'm going to back you up in everything the D.P.H. does."</p>

  <p>Martin was not too pleased by the promise, for Tredgold's set were
  somewhat exigent. They had decided that Martin and Leora were free spirits
  like themselves, and amusing, but they had also decided, long before the
  Arrowsmiths had by coming to Nautilus entered into authentic existence, that
  the Group had a monopoly of all Freedom and Amusingness, and they expected
  the Arrowsmiths to appear for cocktails and poker every Saturday and Sunday
  evening. They could not understand why Martin should desire to spend his time
  in a laboratory, drudging over something called "streptolysin," which had
  nothing to do with cocktails, motors, steel windmills, or insurance.</p>

  <p>On an evening perhaps a fortnight after the destruction of the McCandless
  tenements, Martin was working late in the laboratory. He wasn't even doing
  experiments which might have diverted the Group&mdash;causing bacterial
  colonies to cloud liquids, or making things change color. He was merely
  sitting at a table, looking at logarithmic tables. Leora was not there, and
  he was mumbling, "Confound her, why did she have to go and be sick
  today?"</p>

  <p>Tredgold and Schlemihl and their wives were bound for the Old Farmhouse
  Inn. They had telephoned to Martin's flat and learned where he was. From the
  alley behind City Hall they could peer in and see him, dreary and
  deserted.</p>

  <p>"We'll take the old boy out and brighten him up. First, let's rush home
  and shake up a few cocktails and bring 'em down to surprise him," was
  Tredgold's inspiration.</p>

  <p>Tredgold came into the laboratory, a half-hour later, with much
  clamor.</p>

  <p>"This is a nice way to put in a moonlit spring evening, young Narrowsmith!
  Come on, we'll all go out and dance a little. Grab your hat."</p>

  <p>"Gosh, Clay, I'd like to, but honestly I can't. I've got to work; simply
  got to."</p>

  <p>"Rats! Don't be silly. You've been working too hard. Here&mdash;look what
  Father's brought. Be reasonable. Get outside of a nice long cocktail and
  you'll have a new light on things."</p>

  <p>Martin was reasonable up to that point, but he did not have a new light.
  Tredgold would not take No. Martin continued to refuse, affectionately, then
  a bit tartly. Outside, Schlemihl pressed down the button of the motor horn
  and held it, producing a demanding, infuriating yawp which made Martin cry,
  "For God's sake go out and make 'em quit that, will you, and let me alone!
  I've got to work, I told you!"</p>

  <p>Tredgold stared a moment. "I certainly shall! I'm not accustomed to force
  my attentions on people. Pardon me for disturbing you!"</p>

  <p>By the time Martin sulkily felt that he must apologize, the car was gone.
  Next day and all the week, he waited for Tredgold to telephone, and Tredgold
  waited for him to telephone, and they fell into a circle of dislike. Leora
  and Clara Tredgold saw each other once or twice, but they were uncomfortable,
  and a fortnight later, when the most prominent physician in town dined with
  the Tredgolds and attacked Martin as a bumptious and narrow-visioned young
  man, both the Tredgolds listened and agreed.</p>

  <p>Opposition to Martin developed all at once.</p>

  <p>Various physicians were against him, not only because of the enlarged
  clinics, but because he rarely asked their help and never their advice. Mayor
  Pugh considered him tactless. Klopchuk and F. X. Jordan were assailing him as
  crooked. The reporters disliked him for his secrecy and occasional
  brusqueness. And the Group had ceased to defend him. Of all these forces
  Martin was more or less aware, and behind them he fancied that doubtful
  business men, sellers of impure ice-cream and milk, owners of unsanitary
  shops and dirty tenements, men who had always hated Pickerbaugh but who had
  feared to attack him because of his popularity, were gathering to destroy the
  entire Department of Public Health...He appreciated Pickerbaugh in those
  days, and loved soldier-wise the Department.</p>

  <p>There came from Mayor Pugh a hint that he would save trouble by resigning.
  He would not resign. Neither would he go to the citizens begging for support.
  He did his work, and leaned on Leora's assurance, and tried to ignore his
  detractors. He could not.</p>

  <p>News-items and three-line editorial squibs dug at his tyranny, his
  ignorance, his callowness. An old women died after treatment at the clinic,
  and the coroner hinted that it had been the fault of "our almighty
  health-officer's pet cub assistant." Somewhere arose the name "the Schoolboy
  Czar" for Martin, and it stuck.</p>

  <p>In the gossip at luncheon clubs, in discussions at the Parents' and
  Teachers' Association, in one frank signed protest sent to the Mayor, Martin
  was blamed for too strict an inspection of milk, for insufficiently strict
  inspection of milk; for permitting garbage to lie untouched, for persecuting
  the overworked garbage collectors; and when a case of small-pox appeared in
  the Bohemian section, there was an opinion that Martin had gone out
  personally and started it.</p>

  <p>However vague the citizens were as to the nature of his wickedness, once
  they lost faith in him they lost it completely and with joy, and they
  welcomed an apparently spontaneously generated rumor that he had betrayed his
  benefactor, their beloved Dr. Pickerbaugh, by seducing Orchid.</p>

  <p>At this interesting touch of immorality, he had all the fashionable
  churches against him. The pastor of the Jonathan Edwards Church touched up a
  sermon about Sin in High Places by a reference to "one who, while like a Czar
  he pretends to be safeguarding the city from entirely imaginary dangers, yet
  winks at the secret vice rampant in hidden places; who allies himself with
  the forces of graft and evil and the thugs who batten on honest but deluded
  Labor; one who cannot arise, a manly man among men, and say, 'I have a clean
  heart and clean hands.'"</p>

  <p>It is true that some of the delighted congregation thought that this
  referred to Mayor Pugh, and others applied it to F. X. Jordan, but wise
  citizens saw that it was a courageous attack on that monster of treacherous
  lewdness, Dr. Arrowsmith.</p>

  <p>In all the city there were exactly two ministers who defended him: Father
  Costello of the Irish Catholic Church and Rabbi Rovine. They were, it
  happened, very good friends, and not at all friendly with the pastor of the
  Jonathan Edwards Church. They bullied their congregations; each of them
  asserted, "People come sneaking around with criticisms of our new Director of
  Health. If you want to make charges, make them openly. I will not listen to
  cowardly hints. And let me tell you that this city is lucky in having for
  health-officer a man who is honest and who actually knows something!"</p>

  <p>But their congregations were poor.</p>

  <p>Martin realized that he was lost. He tried to analyze his
  unpopularity.</p>

  <p>"It isn't just Jordan's plotting and Tredgold's grousing and Pugh's weak
  spine. It's my own fault. I can't go out and soft-soap the people and get
  their permission to help keep them well. And I won't tell them what a hell of
  an important thing my work is&mdash;that I'm the one thing that saves the
  whole lot of 'em from dying immediately. Apparently an official in a
  democratic state has to do those things. Well, I don't! But I've got to think
  up something or they'll emasculate the whole Department."</p>

  <p>One inspiration he did have. If Pickerbaugh were here, he could crush, or
  lovingly smother, the opposition. He remembered Pickerbaugh's farewell: "Now,
  my boy, even if I'm way off there in Washington, this Work will be as close
  to my heart as it ever was, and if you should really need me, you just send
  for me and I'll drop everything and come."</p>

  <p>Martin wrote hinting that he was much needed.</p>

  <p>Pickerbaugh replied by return mail&mdash;good old Pickerbaugh!&mdash;but
  the reply was, "I cannot tell you how grieved I am that I cannot for the
  moment possibly get away from Washington but am sure that in your earnestness
  you exaggerate strength of opposition, write me freely, at any time."</p>

  <p>"That's my last shot," Martin said to Leora. "I'm done. Mayor Pugh will
  fire me, just as soon as he comes back from his fishing trip. I'm a failure
  again, darling."</p>

  <p>"You're not a failure, and you must eat some of this nice steak, and what
  shall we do now&mdash;time for us to be moving on, anyway&mdash;I hate
  staying in one place," said Leora.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what we'll do. Maybe I could get a job at Hunziker's. Or go
  back to Dakota and try to work up a practice. What I'd like is to become a
  farmer and get me a big shot-gun and drive every earnest Christian citizen
  off the place. But meantime I'm going to stick here. I might win
  yet&mdash;with just a couple of miracles and a divine intervention. Oh, God,
  I am so tired! Are you coming back to the lab with me this evening? Honest,
  I'll quit early&mdash;before eleven, maybe."</p>

  <p>He had completed his paper on the streptolysin research, and he took a day
  off to go to Chicago and talk it over with an editor of the Journal of
  Infectious Diseases. As he left Nautilus he was confused. He had caught
  himself rejoicing that he was free of Wheatsylvania and bound for great
  Nautilus. Time bent back, progress was annihilated, and he was mazed with
  futility.</p>

  <p>The editor praised his paper, accepted it, and suggested only one change.
  Martin had to wait for his train. He remembered that Angus Duer was in
  Chicago, with the Rouncefield Clinic&mdash;a private organization of medical
  specialists, sharing costs and profits.</p>

  <p>The clinic occupied fourteen rooms in a twenty-story building constructed
  (or so Martin certainly remembered it) of marble, gold, and rubies. The
  clinic reception-room, focused on a vast stone fireplace, was like the
  drawing-room of an oil magnate, but it was not a place of leisure. The young
  woman at the door demanded Martin's symptoms and address. A page in buttons
  sped with his name to a nurse, who flew to the inner offices. Before Angus
  appeared, Martin had to wait a quarter-hour in a smaller, richer, still more
  abashing reception-room. By this time he was so awed that he would have
  permitted the clinic surgeons to operate on him for any ill which at the
  moment they happened to fancy.</p>

  <p>In medical school and Zenith General Hospital, Angus Duer had been
  efficient enough, but now he was ten times as self-assured. He was cordial;
  he invited Martin to step out for a dish of tea as though he almost meant it;
  but beside him Martin felt young, rustic, inept.</p>

  <p>Angus won him by pondering, "Irving Watters? He was Digam? I'm not sure I
  remember him. Oh, yes&mdash;he was one of these boneheads that are the curse
  of every profession."</p>

  <p>When Martin had sketched his conflict at Nautilus, Angus suggested, "You
  better come join us here at Rouncefield, as pathologist. Our pathologist is
  leaving in a few weeks. You could do the job, all right. You're getting
  thirty-five hundred a year now? Well, I think I could get you forty-five
  hundred, as a starter, and some day you'd become a regular member of the
  clinic and get in on all the profits. Let me know if you want it. Rouncefield
  told me to dig up a man."</p>

  <p>With this resource and with an affection for Angus, Martin returned to
  Nautilus and open war. When Mayor Pugh returned he did not discharge Martin,
  but he appointed over him, as full director, Pickerbaugh's friend, Dr.
  Bissex, the football coach and health director of Mugford College.</p>

  <p>Dr. Bissex first discharged Rufus Ockford, which took five minutes, went
  out and addressed a Y.M.C.A. meeting, then bustled in and invited Martin to
  resign.</p>

  <p>"I will like hell!" said Martin. "Come on, be honest, Bissex. If you want
  to fire me, do it, but let's have things straight. I won't resign, and if you
  do fire me I think I'll take it to the courts, and maybe I can turn enough
  light on you and His Honor and Frank Jordan to keep you from taking all the
  guts out of the work here."</p>

  <p>"Why, Doctor, what a way to talk! Certainly I won't fire you," said
  Bissex, in the manner of one who has talked to difficult students and to lazy
  football teams. "Stay with us as long as you like. Only, in the interests of
  economy, I reduce your salary to eight hundred dollars a year!"</p>

  <p>"All right, reduce and be damned," said Martin.</p>

  <p>It sounded particularly fine and original when he said it, but less so
  when Leora and he found that, with their rent fixed by their lease, they
  could not by whatever mean economies live on less than a thousand a year.</p>

  <p>Now that he was free from responsibility he began to form his own faction,
  to save the Department. He gathered Rabbi Rovine, Father Costello, Ockford,
  who was going to remain in town and practice, the secretary of the Labor
  Council, a banker who regarded Tredgold as "fast," and that excellent fellow
  the dentist of the school clinic.</p>

  <p>"With people like that behind me, I can do something," he gloated to
  Leora. "I'm going to stick by it. I'm not going to have the D.P.H. turned
  into a Y.M.C.A. Bissex has all of Pickerbaugh's mush without his honesty and
  vigor. I can beat him! I'm not much of an executive, but I was beginning to
  visualize a D.P.H. that would be solid and not gaseous&mdash;that would save
  kids and prevent epidemics. I won't give it up. You watch me!"</p>

  <p>His committee made representations to the Commercial Club, and for a time
  they were certain that the chief reporter of the Frontiersman was going to
  support them, "as soon as he could get his editor over being scared of a
  row." But Martin's belligerency was weakened by shame, for he never had
  enough money to meet his bills, and he was not used to dodging irate grocers,
  receiving dunning letters, standing at the door arguing with impertinent
  bill-collectors. He, who had been a city dignitary a few days before, had to
  endure, "Come on now, you pay up, you dead beat, or I'll get a cop!" When the
  shame had grown to terror, Dr. Bissex suddenly reduced his salary another two
  hundred dollars.</p>

  <p>Martin stormed into the mayor's office to have it out, and found F. X.
  Jordan sitting with Pugh. It was evident that they both knew of the second
  reduction and considered it an excellent joke.</p>

  <p>He reassembled his committee. "I'm going to take this into the courts," he
  raged.</p>

  <p>"Fine," said Father Costello; and Rabbi Rovine: "Jenkins, that radical
  lawyer, would handle the case free."</p>

  <p>The wise banker observed, "You haven't got anything to take into the
  courts till they discharge you without cause. Bissex has a legal right to
  reduce your salary all he wants to. The city regulations don't fix the salary
  of anybody except the Director and the inspectors. You haven't a thing to
  say."</p>

  <p>With a melodramatic flourish Martin protested, "And I suppose I haven't a
  thing to say if they wreck the Department!"</p>

  <p>"Not a thing, if the city doesn't care."</p>

  <p>"Well, I care! I'll starve before I'll resign!"</p>

  <p>"You'll starve if you don't resign, and your wife, too. Now here's my
  plan," said the banker. "You go into private practice here&mdash;I'll finance
  your getting an office and so on&mdash;and when the time comes, maybe in five
  or ten years from now, we'll all get together again and have you put in as
  full Director."</p>

  <p>"Ten years of waiting&mdash;in <i>nautilus?</i> Nope. I'm licked. I'm a
  complete failure&mdash;at thirty-two! I'll resign. I'll wander on," said
  Martin.</p>

  <p>"I know I'm going to love Chicago," said Leora.</p><br>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">He wrote to Angus Duer. He was appointed pathologist in the
  Rouncefield Clinic. But, Angus wrote, "they could not at the moment see their
  way clear to pay him forty-five hundred a year, though they were glad to go
  to twenty-five hundred."</p>

  <p>Martin accepted.</p><br>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="first">When the Nautilus papers announced that Martin had resigned,
  the good citizens chuckled, "Resigned? He got kicked out, that's what
  happened." One of the papers had an innocent squib:</p><br>

  <p class="quote">Probably a certain amount of hypocrisy is inevitable in us
  sinful human critters, but when a public official tries to pose as a saint
  while indulging in every vice, and tries to cover up his gross ignorance and
  incompetence by pulling political wires, and makes a holy show of himself by
  not even doing a first-class job of wire-pulling, then even the cussedest of
  us old scoundrels begins to holler for the meat-ax.</p><br>

  <p>Pickerbaugh wrote to Martin from Washington:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">I greatly regret to hear that you have resigned your post.
  I cannot tell you how disappointed I am, after all the pains I took in
  breaking you in and making you acquainted with my ideals. Bissex informs me
  that, because of crisis in city finances, he had to reduce your salary
  temporarily. Well personally I would rather work for the D.P.H. for nothing a
  year and earn my keep by being a night watchman than give up the fight for
  everything that is decent and constructive. I am sorry. I had a great liking
  for you, and your defection, your going back to private practice merely for
  commercial gain, your selling out for what I presume is a very high
  emolument, is one of the very greatest blows I have recently had to
  sustain.</p><br>

  <h3>VI.</h3>

  <p class="first">As they rode up to Chicago Martin thought aloud:</p>

  <p>"I never knew I could be so badly licked. I never want to see a laboratory
  or a public health office again. I'm done with everything but making
  money.</p>

  <p>"I suppose this Rouncefield Clinic is probably nothing but a gilded
  boob-trap&mdash;scare the poor millionaire into having all the fancy kinds of
  examinations and treatments the traffic will bear. I hope it is! I expect to
  be a commercial-group doctor the rest of my life. I hope I have the sense to
  be!</p>

  <p>"All wise men are bandits. They're loyal to their friends, but they
  despise the rest. Why not, when the mass of people despise them if they
  <i>aren't</i> bandits? Angus Duer had the sense to see this from the
  beginning, way back in medic school. He's probably a perfect technician as a
  surgeon, but he knows you get only what you grab. Think of the years it's
  taken me to learn what he savvied all the time!</p>

  <p>"Know what I'll do? I'll stick to the Rouncefield Clinic till I'm making
  maybe thirty thousand a year, and then I'll get Ockford and start my own
  clinic, with myself as internist and head of the whole shooting-match, and
  collect every cent I can.</p>

  <p>"All right, if what people want is a little healing and a lot of tapestry,
  they shall have it&mdash;and pay for it.</p>

  <p>"I never thought I could be such a failure&mdash;to become a commercialist
  and not want to be anything else. And I don't want to be anything else,
  believe me! I'm through!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">Then for a year with each day longer than a sleepless night,
  yet the whole year speeding without events or seasons or eagerness, Martin
  was a faithful mechanic in that most competent, most clean and brisk and
  visionless medical factory, the Rouncefield Clinic. He had nothing of which
  to complain. The clinic did, perhaps, give over-many roentgenological
  examinations to socially dislocated women who needed children and
  floor-scrubbing more than pretty little skiagraphs; they did, perhaps, view
  all tonsils with too sanguinary a gloom; but certainly no factory could have
  been better equipped or more gratifyingly expensive, and none could have
  routed its raw human material through so many processes so swiftly. The
  Martin Arrowsmith who had been supercilious toward Pickerbaugh and old Dr.
  Winters had for Rouncefield and Angus Duer and the other keen taut
  specialists of the clinic only the respect of the poor and uncertain for the
  rich and shrewd.</p>

  <p>He admired Angus's firmness of purpose and stability of habit.</p>

  <p>Angus had a swim or a fencing lesson daily; he swam easily and fenced like
  a still-faced demon. He was in bed before eleven-thirty; he never took more
  than one drink a day; and he never read anything or said anything which would
  not contribute to his progress as a Brilliant Young Surgeon. His underlings
  knew that Dr. Duer would not fail to arrive precisely on time, precisely well
  dressed, absolutely sober, very cool, and appallingly unpleasant to any nurse
  who made a mistake or looked for a smile.</p>

  <p>Martin would without fear have submitted to the gilded and ardent
  tonsil-snatcher of the clinic, would have submitted to Angus for abdominal
  surgery or to Rouncefield for any operation of the head or neck, providing he
  was himself quite sure the operation was necessary, but he was never able to
  rise to the clinic's faith that any portions of the body without which people
  could conceivably get along should certainly be removed at once.</p>

  <p>The real flaw in his year of Chicago was that through all his working day
  he did not live. With quick hands, and one-tenth of his brain, he made blood
  counts, did urinalyses and Wassermanns and infrequent necropsies, and all the
  while he was dead, in a white-tiled coffin. Amid the blattings of Pickerbaugh
  and the peepings of Wheatsylvania, he had lived, had fought his environment.
  Now there was nothing to fight.</p>

  <p>After hours, he almost lived. Leora and he discovered the world of
  book-shops and print-shops and theaters and concerts. They read novels and
  history and travel; they talked, at dinners given by Rouncefield or Angus, to
  journalists, engineers, bankers, merchants. They saw a Russian play, and
  heard Mischa Elman, and read Gottlieb's beloved Rabelais. Martin learned to
  flirt without childishness, and Leora went for the first time to a
  hair-dresser and to a manicure, and began her lessons in French. She had
  called Martin a "lie-hunter," a "truth-seeker." They decided now, talking it
  over in their tight little two-and-quarter room flat, that most people who
  call themselves "truth-seekers"&mdash;persons who scurry about chattering of
  Truth as though it were a tangible separable thing, like houses or salt or
  bread&mdash;did not so much desire to find Truth as to cure their mental
  itch. In novels, these truth-seekers quested the "secret of life" in
  laboratories which did not seem to be provided with Bunsen flames or
  reagents; or they went, at great expense and much discomfort from hot trains
  and undesirable snakes, to Himalayan monasteries, to learn from unaseptic
  sages that the Mind can do all sorts of edifying things if one will but spend
  thirty or forty years in eating rice and gazing on one's navel.</p>

  <p>To these high matters Martin responded, "Rot!" He insisted that there is
  no Truth but only many truths; that Truth is not a colored bird to be chased
  among the rocks and captured by its tail, but a skeptical attitude toward
  life. He insisted that no one could expect more than, by stubbornness or
  luck, to have the kind of work he enjoyed and an ability to become better
  acquainted with the facts of that work than the average job-holder.</p>

  <p>His mechanistic philosophy did not persuade him that he was progressing
  adequately. When he tried to match himself with the experts of the clinic or
  with their professional friends, he was even more uncomfortable than he had
  been under the disconcerting scorn of Dr. Hesselink of Groningen. At clinic
  luncheons he met surgeons from London, New York, Boston; men with limousines
  and social positions and the offensive briskness of the man who has numerous
  engagements, or the yet more offensive quietness of the person who is amused
  by his inferiors; master technicians, readers of papers at medical
  congresses, executives and controllers, unafraid to operate before a hundred
  peering doctors, or to give well-bred and exceedingly final orders to
  subordinates; captain-generals of medicine, never doubting themselves, great
  priests and healers; men mature and wise and careful and blandly cordial.</p>

  <p>In their winged presences, Max Gottlieb seemed an aged fusser, Gustaf
  Sondelius a mountebank, and the city of Nautilus unworthy of passionate
  warfare. As their suave courtesy smothered him, Martin felt like a
  footman.</p>

  <p>In long hours of increasing frankness and lucidity he discussed with Leora
  the question of "What is this Martin Arrowsmith and whither is he going?" and
  he admitted that the sight of the Famous Surgeons disturbed his ancient faith
  that he was somehow a superior person. It was Leora who consoled him:</p>

  <p>"I've got a lovely description for your dratted Famous Surgeons. You know
  how polite and important they are, and they smile so carefully? Well, don't
  you remember you once said that Professor Gottlieb called all such people
  like that 'men of measured merriment'?"</p>

  <p>He caught up the phrase; they sang it together; and they made of it a
  beating impish song:</p>

  <p>"Men of measured merriment! Men of measured merriment! Damn the great
  executives, the men of measured merriment, damn the men with careful smiles,
  damn the men that run the shops, oh, damn their measured merriment, the men
  with measured merriment, oh, damn their measured merriment, and <i>damn</i>
  their careful smiles!"</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">While Martin developed in a jagged way from the boy of
  Wheatsylvania to mature man, his relations to Leora developed from loyal
  boy-and-girl adventurousness to lasting solidity. They had that understanding
  of each other known only to married people, a few married people, wherein for
  all their differences they were as much indissoluble parts of a whole as are
  the eye and hand. Their identification did not mean that they dwelt always in
  rosy bliss. Because he was so intimately fond of her and so sure of her,
  because anger and eager hot injustices are but ways of expressing trust,
  Martin was irritated by her and querulous with her as he would not have
  endured being with any other woman, any charming Orchid.</p>

  <p>He stalked out now and then after a quarrel, disdaining to answer her, and
  for hours he left her alone, enjoying the knowledge that he was hurting her,
  that she was alone, waiting, perhaps weeping. Because he loved her and also
  was fond of her, he was annoyed when she was less sleek, less suave, than the
  women he encountered at Angus Duer's.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Rouncefield was a worthy old waddler&mdash;beside her, Leora was
  shining and exquisite. But Mrs. Duer was of amber and ice. She was a rich
  young woman, she dressed with distinction, she spoke with finishing-school
  mock-melodiousness, she was ambitious, and she was untroubled by the
  possession of a heart or a brain. She was, indeed, what Mrs. Irving Watters
  believed herself to be.</p>

  <p>In the simple gorgeousness of the Nautilus smart set, Mrs. Clay Tredgold
  had petted Leora and laughed at her if she lacked a shoe-buckle or split an
  infinitive, but the gold-slippered Mrs. Duer was accustomed to sneer at
  carelessness with the most courteous and unresentable and unmistakable
  sneers.</p>

  <p>As they returned by taxicab from the Duers', Martin flared:</p>

  <p>"Don't you ever learn anything? I remember once in Nautilus we stopped on
  a country road and talked till&mdash;oh, darn' near dawn, and you were going
  to be so energetic, but here we are again tonight, with just the same
  thing&mdash;Good God, couldn't you even take the trouble to notice you had a
  spot of soot on your nose tonight? Mrs. Duer noticed it, all right! Why are
  you so sloppy? Why can't you take a little care? And why can't you make an
  effort, anyway, to have something to say? You just sit there at
  dinner&mdash;you just sit and look healthy! Don't you want to help me? Mrs.
  Duer will probably help Angus to become president of the American Medical
  Association, in about twenty years, and by that time I suppose you'll have me
  back in Dakota as assistant to Hesselink!"</p>

  <p>Leora had been snuggling beside him in the unusual luxury of a taxicab.
  She sat straight now, and when she spoke she had lost the casual independence
  with which she usually regarded life:</p>

  <p>"Dear, I'm awfully sorry. I went out this afternoon, I went out and had a
  facial massage, so as to look nice for you, and then I knew you like
  conversation, so I got my little book about modern painting that I bought and
  I studied it terribly hard, but tonight I just couldn't seem to get the
  conversation around to modern painting&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was sobbing, with her head on his shoulder, "Oh, you poor, scared,
  bullied kid, trying to be grown-up with these dollar-chasers!"</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">After the first daze of white tile and bustling cleverness
  at the Rouncefield Clinic, Martin had the desire to tie up a few loose knots
  of his streptolysin research.</p>

  <p>When Angus Duer discovered it he hinted, "Look here, Martin, I'm glad
  you're keeping on with your science, but if I were you I wouldn't, I think,
  waste too much energy on mere curiosity. Dr. Rouncefield was speaking about
  it the other day. We'd be glad to have you do all the research you want, only
  we'd like it if you went at something practical. Take for instance: if you
  could make a tabulation of the blood-counts in a couple of hundred cases of
  appendicitis and publish it, that'd get somewhere, and you could sort of
  bring in a mention of the clinic, and we'd all receive a little
  credit&mdash;and incidentally maybe we could raise you to three thousand a
  year then."</p>

  <p>This generosity had the effect of extinguishing Martin's desire to do any
  research whatever.</p>

  <p>"Angus is right. What he means is: as a scientist I'm finished. I am. I'll
  never try to do anything original again."</p>

  <p>It was at this time, when Martin had been with the clinic for a year, that
  his streptolysin paper was published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.
  He gave reprints to Rouncefield and to Angus. They said extremely nice things
  which showed that they had not read the paper, and again they suggested his
  tabulating blood-counts.</p>

  <p>He also sent a reprint to Max Gottlieb, at the McGurk Institute of
  Biology.</p>

  <p>Gottlieb wrote to him, in that dead-black spider-web script:/p&gt;<br></p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Martin</span>:</p>

  <p class="letter">I have read your paper with great pleasure. The curves of
  the relation of hemolysin production to age of culture are illuminating. I
  have spoken about you to Tubbs. When are you coming to us&mdash;to me? Yor
  laboratory and diener are waiting for you here. The last thing I want to be
  is a mystic, but I feel when I see your fine engraved letterhead of a clinic
  and a Rouncefield that you should be tired of trying to be a good citizen and
  ready to come back to work. We shall be glad, &amp; Dr. Tubbs, if you can
  come.</p>

  <p class="letter">Truly yours,</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">M. Gottlieb</span>.</p><br>

  <p>"I'm simply going to adore New York," said Leora.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch26"
     name="ch26">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">The McGurk Building. A sheer wall, thirty blank stories of
  glass and limestone, down in the pinched triangle whence New York rules a
  quarter of the world.</p>

  <p>Martin was not overwhelmed by his first hint of New York; after a year in
  the Chicago Loop, Manhattan seemed leisurely. But when from the elevated
  railroad he beheld the Woolworth Tower, he was exalted. To him architecture
  had never existed; buildings were larger or smaller bulks containing more or
  less interesting objects. His most impassioned architectural comment had
  been, "There's a cute bungalow; be nice place to live." Now he pondered,
  "Like to see that tower every day&mdash;clouds and storms behind it and
  everything&mdash;so sort of satisfying."</p>

  <p>He came along Cedar Street, among thunderous trucks portly with wares from
  all the world; came to the bronze doors of the McGurk Building and a corridor
  of intemperately colored terracotta, with murals of Andean Indians, pirates
  booming up the Spanish Main, guarded gold-trains, and the stout walls of
  Cartagena. At the Cedar Street end of the corridor, a private street, one
  block long, was the Bank of the Andes and Antilles (Ross McGurk, chairman of
  the board), in whose gold-crusted sanctity red-headed Yankee exporters drew
  drafts on Quito, and clerks hurled breathless Spanish at bulky women. A sign
  indicated, at the Liberty Street end, "Passenger Offices, McGurk Line, weekly
  sailings for the West Indies and South America."</p>

  <p>Born to the prairies, never far from the sight of the cornfields, Martin
  was conveyed to blazing lands and portentous enterprises.</p>

  <p>One of the row of bronze-barred elevators was labeled "Express to McGurk
  Institute." He entered it proudly, feeling himself already a part of the
  godly association. They rose swiftly, and he had but half-second glimpses of
  ground glass doors with the signs of mining companies, lumber companies,
  Central American railroad companies.</p>

  <p>The McGurk Institute is probably the only organization for scientific
  research in the world which is housed in an office building. It has the
  twenty-ninth and thirtieth stories of the McGurk Building, and the roof is
  devoted to its animal house and to tiled walks along which (above a world of
  stenographers and bookkeepers and earnest gentlemen who desire to sell
  Better-bilt Garments to the golden dons of the Argentine) saunter rapt
  scientists dreaming of osmosis in Spirogyra.</p>

  <p>Later, Martin was to note that the reception-room of the Institute was
  smaller, yet more forbiddingly polite, in its white paneling and Chippendale
  chairs, than the lobby of the Rouncefield Clinic, but now he was unconscious
  of the room, of the staccato girl attendant, of everything except that he was
  about to see Max Gottlieb, for the first time in five years.</p>

  <p>At the door of the laboratory he stared hungrily.</p>

  <p>Gottlieb was thin-cheeked and dark as ever, his hawk nose bony, his fierce
  eyes demanding, but his hair had gone gray, the flesh round his mouth was
  sunken, and Martin could have wept at the feebleness with which he rose. The
  old man peered down at him, his hand on Martin's shoulder, but he said
  only:</p>

  <p>"Ah! Dis is good...Your laboratory is three doors down the hall...But I
  object to one thing in the good paper you send me. You say, 'The regularity
  of the rate at which the streptolysin disappears suggests that an equation
  may be found&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>"But it can, sir!"</p>

  <p>"Then why did you not make the equation?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I don't know. I wasn't enough of a mathematician."</p>

  <p>"Then you should not have published till you knew your math!"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;Look, Dr. Gottlieb, do you really think I know enough to work
  here? I want terribly to succeed."</p>

  <p>"Succeed? I have heard that word. It is English? Oh, yes, it is a word
  that liddle schoolboys use at the University of Winnemac. It means passing
  examinations. But there are no examinations to pass here...Martin, let us be
  clear. You know something of laboratory technique; you have heard about dese
  bacilli; you are not a good chemist, and mathematics&mdash;pfui!&mdash;most
  terrible! But you have curiosity and you are stubborn. You do not accept
  rules. Therefore I t'ink you will either make a very good scientist or a very
  bad one, and if you are bad enough, you will be popular with the rich ladies
  who rule this city, New York, and you can gif lectures for a living or even
  become, if you get to be plausible enough, a college president. So anyvay, it
  will be interesting."</p>

  <p>Half an hour later they were arguing ferociously, Martin asserting that
  the whole world ought to stop warring and trading and writing and get
  straightway into laboratories to observe new phenomena; Gottlieb insisting
  that there were already too many facile scientists, that the one thing
  necessary was the mathematical analysis (and often the destruction) of
  phenomena already observed.</p>

  <p>It sounded bellicose, and all the while Martin was blissful with the
  certainty that he had come home.</p>

  <p>The laboratory in which they talked (Gottlieb pacing the floor, his long
  arms fantastically knotted behind his thin back; Martin leaping on and off
  tall stools) was not in the least remarkable&mdash;a sink, a bench with racks
  of numbered test-tubes, a microscope, a few note-books and hydrogen-ion
  charts, a grotesque series of bottles connected by glass and rubber tubes on
  an ordinary kitchen table at the end of the room&mdash;yet now and then
  during his tirades Martin looked about reverently.</p>

  <p>Gottlieb interrupted their debate: "What work do you want to do here?"</p>

  <p>"Why, sir, I'd like to help you, if I can. I suppose you're cleaning up
  some things on the synthesis of antibodies."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I t'ink I can bring immunity reactions under the mass action law.
  But you are not to help me. You are to do your own work. What do you want to
  do? This is not a clinic; wit' patients going through so neat in a row!"</p>

  <p>"I want to find a hemolysin for which there's an antibody. There isn't any
  for streptolysin. I'd like to work with staphylolysin. Would you mind?"</p>

  <p>"I do not care what you do&mdash;if you just do not steal my staph
  cultures out of the ice-box, and if you will look mysterious all the time, so
  Dr. Tubbs, our Director, will t'ink you are up to something big. So! I haf
  only one suggestion: when you get stuck in a problem, I have a fine
  collection of detective stories in my office. But no. Should I be
  serious&mdash;this once, when you are just come?</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I am a crank, Martin. There are many who hate me. There are plots
  against me&mdash;oh, you t'ink I imagine it, but you shall see! I make many
  mistakes. But one thing I keep always pure: the religion of a scientist.</p>

  <p>"To be a scientist&mdash;it is not just a different job, so that a man
  should choose between being a scientist and being an explorer or a
  bond-salesman or a physician or a king or a farmer. It is a tangle of ver-y
  obscure emotions, like mysticism, or wanting to write poetry; it makes its
  victim all different from the good normal man. The normal man, he does not
  care much what he does except that he should eat and sleep and make love. But
  the scientist is intensely religious&mdash;he is so religious that he will
  not accept quarter-truths, because they are an insult to his faith.</p>

  <p>"He wants that everything should be subject to inexorable laws. He is
  equal opposed to the capitalists who t'ink their silly money-grabbing is a
  system, and to liberals who t'ink man is not a fighting animal; he takes both
  the American booster and the European aristocrat, and he ignores all their
  blithering. Ignores it! All of it! He hates the preachers who talk their
  fables, but he iss not too kindly to the anthropologists and historians who
  can only make guesses, yet they have the nerf to call themselves scientists!
  Oh, yes, he is a man that all nice good-natured people should naturally
  hate!</p>

  <p>"He speaks no meaner of the ridiculous faith-healers and chiropractors
  than he does of the doctors that want to snatch our science before it is
  tested and rush around hoping they heal people, and spoiling all the clues
  with their footsteps; and worse than the men like hogs, worse than the
  imbeciles who have not even heard of science, he hates pseudo-scientists,
  guess-scientists&mdash;like these psycho-analysts; and worse than those comic
  dream-scientists he hates the men that are allowed in a clean kingdom like
  biology but know only one text-book and how to lecture to nincompoops all so
  popular! He is the only real revolutionary, the authentic scientist, because
  he alone knows how liddle he knows.</p>

  <p>"He must be heartless. He lives in a cold, clear light. Yet dis is a funny
  t'ing: really, in private, he is not cold nor heartless&mdash;so much less
  cold than the Professional Optimists. The world has always been ruled by the
  Philanthropists: by the doctors that want to use therapeutic methods they do
  not understand, by the soldiers that want something to defend their country
  against, by the preachers that yearn to make everybody listen to them, by the
  kind manufacturers that love their workers, by the eloquent statesmen and
  soft-hearted authors&mdash;and see once what a fine mess of hell they haf
  made of the world! Maybe now it is time for the scientist, who works and
  searches and never goes around howling how he loves everybody!</p>

  <p>"But once again always remember that not all the men who work at science
  are scientists. So few! The rest&mdash;secretaries, press-agents,
  camp-followers! To be a scientist is like being a Goethe: it is born in you.
  Sometimes I t'ink you have a liddle of it born in you. If you haf, there is
  only one t'ing&mdash;no, there is two t'ings you must do: work twice as hard
  as you can, and keep people from using you. I will try to protect you from
  Success. It is all I can do. So...I should wish, Martin, that you will be
  very happy here. May Koch bless you!"</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">Five rapt minutes Martin spent in the laboratory which was
  to be his&mdash;smallish but efficient, the bench exactly the right height, a
  proper sink with pedal taps. When he had closed the door and let his spirit
  flow out and fill that minute apartment with his own essence, he felt
  secure.</p>

  <p>No Pickerbaugh or Rouncefield could burst in here and drag him away to be
  explanatory and plausible and public; he would be free to work, instead of
  being summoned to the package-wrapping and dictation of breezy letters which
  men call work.</p>

  <p>He looked out of the broad window above his bench and saw that he did have
  the coveted Woolworth Tower, to keep and gloat on. Shut in to a joy of
  precision, he would nevertheless not be walled out from flowing life. He had,
  to the north, not the Woolworth Tower alone but the Singer Building, the
  arrogant magnificence of the City Investing Building. To the west, tall ships
  were riding, tugs were bustling, all the world went by. Below his cliff, the
  streets were feverish. Suddenly he loved humanity as he loved the decent,
  clean rows of test-tubes, and he prayed then the prayer of the scientist:</p>

  <p>"God give me unclouded eyes and freedom from haste. God give me a quiet
  and relentless anger against all pretense and all pretentious work and all
  work left slack and unfinished. God give me a restlessness whereby I may
  neither sleep nor accept praise till my observed results equal my calculated
  results or in pious glee I discover and assault my error. God give me
  strength not to trust to God!"</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">He walked all the way up to their inconsiderable hotel in
  the Thirties, and all the way the crowds stared at him&mdash;this slim, pale,
  black-eyed, beaming young man who thrust among them, half-running, seeing
  nothing yet in a blur seeing everything: gallant buildings, filthy streets,
  relentless traffic, soldiers of fortune, fools, pretty women, frivolous
  shops, windy sky. His feet raced to the tune of "I've found my work, I've
  found my work, I've found my work!"</p>

  <p>Leora was awaiting him&mdash;Leora whose fate it was ever to wait for him
  in creaky rocking-chairs in cheapish rooms. As he galloped in she smiled, and
  all her thin, sweet body was illumined. Before he spoke she cried:</p>

  <p>"Oh, Sandy, I'm so glad!"</p>

  <p>She interrupted his room-striding panegyrics on Max Gottlieb, on the
  McGurk Institute, on New York, on the charms of staphylolysin, by a meek
  "Dear, how much are they going to pay you?"</p>

  <p>He stopped with a bump. "Gosh! I forgot to ask!"</p>

  <p>"Oh!"</p>

  <p>"Now you look here! This isn't a Rouncefield Clinic! I hate these buzzards
  that can't see anything but making money&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know, Sandy. Honestly, I don't care. I was just wondering what kind of
  a flat we'll be able to afford, so I can begin looking for it. Go on. Dr.
  Gottlieb said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It was three hours after, at eight, when they went to dinner.</p><br>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">The city of magic was to become to Martin neither a city nor
  any sort of magic but merely a route: their flat, the subway, the Institute,
  a favorite inexpensive restaurant, a few streets of laundries and
  delicatessens and movie theaters. But tonight it was a fog of wonder. They
  dined at the Brevoort, of which Gustaf Sondelius had told him. This was in
  1916, before the country had become wholesome and sterile, and the Brevoort
  was a tumult of French uniforms, caviar, Louis, dangling neckties, Nuits St.
  Georges, illustrators, Grand Marnier, British Intelligence officers, brokers,
  conversation, and Martell, V.O.</p>

  <p>"It's a fine crazy bunch," said Martin. "Do you realize we can stop being
  respectable now? Irving Watters isn't watching us, or Angus! Would we be too
  insane if we had a bottle of champagne?"</p>

  <p>He awoke next day to fret that there must be a trick somewhere, as there
  had been in Nautilus, in Chicago. But as he set to work he seemed to be in a
  perfect world. The Institute deftly provided all the material and facilities
  he could desire&mdash;animals, incubators, glassware, cultures,
  media&mdash;and he had a thoroughly trained technician&mdash;"garcon" they
  called him at the Institute. He really was let alone; he really was
  encouraged to do individual work; he really was associated with men who
  thought not in terms of poetic posters or of two-thousand-dollar operations
  but of colloids and sporulation and electrons, and of the laws and energies
  which governed them.</p>

  <p>On his first day there came to greet him the head of the Department of
  Physiology, Dr. Rippleton Holabird.</p>

  <p>Holabird seemed, though Martin had found his name starred in physiological
  journals, too young and too handsome to be the head of a department: a tall,
  slim, easy man with a trim mustache. Martin had been reared in the school of
  Clif Clawson; he had not realized, till he heard Dr. Holabird's quick
  greeting, that a man's voice may be charming without effeminacy.</p>

  <p>Holabird guided him through the two floors of the Institute, and Martin
  beheld all the wonders of which he had ever dreamed. If it was not so large,
  McGurk ranked in equipment with Rockefeller, Pasteur, McCormick, Lister.
  Martin saw rooms for sterilizing glass and preparing media, for
  glass-blowing, for the polariscope and the spectroscope, and a
  steel-and-cement-walled combustion-chamber. He saw a museum of pathology and
  bacteriology to which he longed to add. There was a department of
  publications, whence were issued the Institute reports, and the American
  Journal of Geographic Pathology, edited by the Director, Dr. Tubbs; there was
  a room for photography, a glorious library, an aquarium for the Department of
  Marine Biology, and (Dr. Tubbs's own idea) a row of laboratories which
  visiting foreign scientists were invited to use as their own. A Belgian
  biologist and a Portuguese bio-chemist were occupying guest laboratories now,
  and once, Martin thrilled to learn, Gustaf Sondelius had been here.</p>

  <p>Then Martin saw the Berkeley-Saunders centrifuge.</p>

  <p>The principle of the centrifuge is that of the cream-separator. It
  collects as sediment the solids scattered through a liquid, such as bacteria
  in a solution. Most centrifuges are hand- or water-power contrivances the
  size of a large cocktail-shaker, but this noble implement was four feet
  across, electrically driven, the central bowl enclosed in armor plate
  fastened with levers like a submarine hatch, the whole mounted on a cement
  pillar.</p>

  <p>Holabird explained, "There're only three of these in existence. They're
  made by Berkeley-Saunders in England. You know the normal speed, even for a
  good centrifuge, is about four thousand revolutions a minute. This does
  twenty thousand a minute&mdash;fastest in the world. Eh?"</p>

  <p>"Jove, they do give you the stuff to work with!" gloated Martin. (He
  really did, under Holabird's handsome influence, say Jove, not Gosh.)</p>

  <p>"Yes, McGurk and Tubbs are the most generous men in the scientific world.
  I think you'll find it very pleasant to be here, Doctor."</p>

  <p>"I know I will&mdash;shall. And Jove, it's awfully nice of you to take me
  around this way."</p>

  <p>"Can't you see how much I'm enjoying my chance to display my knowledge?
  There's no form of egotism so agreeable and so safe as being a cicerone. But
  we still have the real wonder of the Institute for to behold, Doctor. Down
  this way."</p>

  <p>The real wonder of the Institute had nothing visible to do with science.
  It was the Hall, in which lunched the staff, and in which occasional
  scientific dinners were given, with Mrs. McGurk as hostess. Martin gasped and
  his head went back as his glance ran from glistening floor to black and gold
  ceiling. The Hall rose the full height of the two floors of the Institute.
  Clinging to the soaring wall, above the dais on which lunched the Director
  and the seven heads of departments, was a carved musicians'-gallery. Against
  the oak paneling of the walls were portraits of the pontiffs of science, in
  crimson robes, with a vast mural by Maxfield Parrish, and above all was an
  electrolier of a hundred globes.</p>

  <p>"Gosh&mdash;<i>Jove</i>!" said Martin. "I never knew there was such a
  room!"</p>

  <p>Holabird was generous. He did not smile. "Oh, perhaps it's almost too
  gorgeous. It's Capitola's pet creation&mdash;Capitola is Mrs. Ross McGurk,
  wife of the founder; she's really an awfully nice woman but she does love
  Movements and Associations. Terry Wickett, one of the chemists here, calls
  this 'Bonanza Hall.' Yet it does inspire you when you come in to lunch all
  tired and grubby. Now let's go call on the Director. He told me to bring you
  in."</p>

  <p>After the Babylonian splendor of the Hall, Martin expected to find the
  office of Dr. A. DeWitt Tubbs fashioned like a Roman bath, but it was, except
  for a laboratory bench at one end, the most rigidly business-like apartment
  he had ever seen.</p>

  <p>Dr. Tubbs was an earnest man, whiskered like a terrier, very scholarly,
  and perhaps the most powerful American exponent of co-operation in science,
  but he was also a man of the world, fastidious of boots and waistcoats. He
  had graduated from Harvard, studied on the Continent, been professor of
  pathology in the University of Minnesota, president of Hartford University,
  minister to Venezuela, editor of the Weekly Statesman and president of the
  Sanity League, finally Director of McGurk.</p>

  <p>He was a member both of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and of
  the Academy of Sciences. Bishops, generals, liberal rabbis, and musical
  bankers dined with him. He was one of the Distinguished Men to whom the
  newspapers turned for authoritative interviews on all subjects.</p>

  <p>You realized before he had talked to you for ten minutes that here was one
  of the few leaders of mankind who could discourse on any branch of knowledge,
  yet could control practical affairs and drive stumbling mankind on to sane
  and reasonable ideals. Though a Max Gottlieb might in his research show a
  certain talent, yet his narrowness, his sour and antic humor, kept him from
  developing the broad view of education, politics, commerce, and all other
  noble matters which marked Dr. A. DeWitt Tubbs.</p>

  <p>But the Director was as cordial to the insignificant Martin Arrowsmith as
  though Martin were a visiting senator. He shook his hand warmly; he unbent in
  a smile; his baritone was mellow.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Arrowsmith, I trust we shall do more than merely say you are welcome
  here; I trust we shall show you how welcome you are! Dr. Gottlieb tells me
  that you have a natural aptitude for cloistered investigation but that you
  have been looking over the fields of medical practice and public health
  before you settled down to the laboratory. I can't tell you how wise I
  consider you to have made that broad preliminary survey. Too many would-be
  scientists lack the tutored vision which comes from coordinating all mental
  domains."</p>

  <p>Martin was dazed to discover that he had been making a broad survey.</p>

  <p>"Now you'll doubtless wish to take some time, perhaps a year or more, in
  getting into your stride, Dr. Arrowsmith. I shan't ask you for any reports.
  So long as Dr. Gottlieb feels that you yourself are satisfied with your
  progress, I shall be content. Only if there is anything in which I can advise
  you, from a perhaps somewhat longer career in science, please believe that I
  shall be delighted to be of aid, and I am quite sure the same obtains with
  Dr. Holabird here, though he really ought to be jealous, because he is one of
  our youngest workers&mdash;in fact I call him my enfant terrible&mdash;but
  you, I believe, are only thirty-three, and you quite put the poor fellow's
  nose out!"</p>

  <p>Holabird merrily suggested, "Oh, no, Doctor, it's been put out long ago.
  You forget Terry Wickett. He's under forty."</p>

  <p>"Oh. <i>Him!</i>" murmured Dr. Tubbs.</p>

  <p>Martin had never heard a man disposed of so poisonously with such
  politeness. He saw that in Terry Wickett there might be a serpent even in
  this paradise.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Dr. Tubbs, "perhaps you might like to glance around my place
  here. I pride myself on keeping our card-indices and letter-files as
  unimaginatively as though I were an insurance agent. But there is a certain
  exotic touch in these charts." He trotted across the room to show a nest of
  narrow drawers filled with scientific blue-prints.</p>

  <p>Just what they were charts of, he did not say, nor did Martin ever
  learn.</p>

  <p>He pointed to the bench at the end of the room, and laughingly
  admitted:</p>

  <p>"You can see there what an inefficient fellow I really am. I keep
  asserting that I have given up all the idyllic delights of pathological
  research for the less fascinating but so very important and fatiguing cares
  of the directorship. Yet such is the weakness of genus homo that sometimes,
  when I ought to be attending to practical details, I become obsessed by some
  probably absurd pathological concept, and so ridiculous am I that I can't
  wait to hasten down the hall to my regular laboratory&mdash;I must always
  have a bench at hand and an experiment going on. Oh, I'm afraid I'm not the
  moral man that I pose as being in public! Here I am married to executive
  procedure, and still I hanker for my first love, Milady Science!"</p>

  <p>"I think it's fine you still have an itch for it," Martin ventured.</p>

  <p>He was wondering just what experiments Dr. Tubbs had been doing lately.
  The bench seemed rather unused.</p>

  <p>"And now, Doctor, I want you to meet the real Director of the
  Institute&mdash;my secretary, Miss Pearl Robbins."</p>

  <p>Martin had already noticed Miss Robbins. You could not help noticing Miss
  Robbins. She was thirty-five and stately, a creamy goddess. She rose to shake
  hands&mdash;a firm, competent grasp&mdash;and to cry in her glorious
  contralto, "Dr. Tubbs is so complimentary only because he knows that
  otherwise I wouldn't give him his afternoon tea. We've heard so much about
  your cleverness from Dr. Gottlieb that I'm almost afraid to welcome you, Dr.
  Arrowsmith, but I do want to."</p>

  <p>Then, in a glow, Martin stood in his laboratory looking at the Woolworth
  Tower. He was dizzy with these wonders&mdash;his own wonders, now! In
  Rippleton Holabird, so gaily elegant yet so distinguished, he hoped to have a
  friend. He found Dr. Tubbs somewhat sentimental, but he was moved by his
  kindness and by Miss Robbins's recognition. He was in a haze of future glory
  when his door was banged open by a hard-faced, red-headed, soft-shirted man
  of thirty-six or -eight.</p>

  <p>"Arrowsmith?" the intruder growled. "My name is Wickett, Terry Wickett.
  I'm a chemist. I'm with Gottlieb. Well, I noticed the Holy Wren was showing
  you the menagerie."</p>

  <p>"Dr. Holabird?"</p>

  <p>"Him...Well, you must be more or less intelligent, if Pa Gottlieb let you
  in. How's it starting? Which kind are you going to be? One of the polite
  birds that uses the Institute for social climbing and catches him a rich
  wife, or one of the roughnecks like me and Gottlieb?"</p>

  <p>Terry Wickett's croak was as irritating a sound as Martin had ever heard.
  He answered in a voice curiously like that of Rippleton Holabird:</p>

  <p>"I don't think you need to worry. I happen to be married already!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't let that fret you, Arrowsmith. Divorces are cheap, in this
  man's town. Well, did the Holy Wren show you Gladys the Tart?"</p>

  <p>"Huh?"</p>

  <p>"Gladys the Tart, or the Galloping Centrifuge."</p>

  <p>"Oh. You mean the Berkeley-Saunders?"</p>

  <p>"I do, soul of my soul. Whajuh think of it?"</p>

  <p>"It's the finest centrifuge I've ever seen. Dr. Holabird said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hell, he ought to say something! He went and got old Tubbs to buy it. He
  just loves it, Holy Wren does."</p>

  <p>"Why not? It's the fastest&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sure. Speediest centrifuge in the whole Vereinigten, and made of the best
  toothpick steel. The only trouble is, it always blows out fuses, and it
  spatters the bugs so that you need a gas-mask if you're going to use it...And
  did you love dear old Tubbsy and the peerless Pearl?"</p>

  <p>"I did!"</p>

  <p>"Fine. Of course Tubbs is an illiterate jackass but still, at that, he
  hasn't got persecution-mania, like Gottlieb."</p>

  <p>"Look here, Wickett&mdash;is it Dr. Wickett?"</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh...M.D., Ph.D., but a first-rate chemist just the same."</p>

  <p>"Well, Dr. Wickett, it seems to me a shame that a man of your talents
  should have to associate with idiots like Gottlieb and Tubbs and Holabird.
  I've just left a Chicago clinic where everybody is nice and sensible. I'd be
  glad to recommend you for a job there!"</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't be so bad. At least I'd avoid all the gassing at lunch in
  Bonanza Hall. Well, sorry I got your goat, Arrowsmith, but you look all right
  to me."</p>

  <p>"Thanks!"</p>

  <p>Wickett grinned obscenely&mdash;red-headed, rough-faced, wiry&mdash;and
  snorted, "By the way, did Holabird tell you about being wounded in the first
  month of the war, when he was a field marshal or a hospital orderly or
  something in the British Army?"</p>

  <p>"He did not! He didn't mention the war!"</p>

  <p>"He will! Well, Brer Arrowsmith, I look forward to many happy, happy years
  together, playing at the feet of Pa Gottlieb. So long. My lab is right next
  to yours."</p>

  <p>"Fool!" Martin decided, and, "Well, I can stand him as long as I can fall
  back on Gottlieb and Holabird. But&mdash;The conceited idiot! Gosh, so
  Holabird was in the war! Invalided out, I guess. I certainly got back at
  Wickett on that! 'Did he tell you about his being a jolly old hero in the
  blinkin' war?' he said, and I came right back at him, 'I'm sorry to displease
  you,' I said, 'but Dr. Holabird did not mention the war.' The idiot! Well, I
  won't let him worry me."</p>

  <p>And indeed, as Martin met the staff at lunch, Wickett was the only one
  whom he did not find courteous, however brief their greetings. He did not
  distinguish among them; for days most of the twenty researchers remained a
  blur. He confused Dr. Yeo, head of the Department of Biology, with the
  carpenter who had come to put up shelves.</p>

  <p>The staff sat in Hall at two long tables, one on the dais, one below: tiny
  insect groups under the massy ceiling. They were not particularly noble of
  aspect, these possible Darwins and Huxleys and Pasteurs. None of them were
  wide-browed Platos. Except for Rippleton Holabird and Max Gottlieb and
  perhaps Martin himself, they looked like lunching grocers: brisk featureless
  young men; thick mustached elders; and wimpish little men with spectacles,
  men whose collars did not meet. But there was a steady calm about them; there
  was, Martin believed, no anxiety over money in their voices nor any
  restlessness of envy and scandalous gossip. They talked gravely or
  frivolously of their work, the one sort of work that, since it becomes part
  of the chain of discovered fact, is eternal, however forgotten the worker's
  name.</p>

  <p>As Martin listened to Terry Wickett (rude and slangy as ever, referring to
  himself as "the boy chemist," speaking of "this gaudy Institute" and "our
  trusting new lil brother, Arrowsmith") debating with a slight thin-bearded
  man&mdash;Dr. William T. Smith, assistant in bio-chemistry&mdash;the
  possibility of increasing the effects of all enzymes by doses of X-rays, as
  he heard one associate-member vituperate another for his notions of
  cell-chemistry and denounce Ehrlich as "the Edison of medical science,"
  Martin perceived new avenues of exciting research; he stood on a mountain,
  and unknown valleys, craggy tantalizing paths, were open to his feet.</p><br>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="first">Dr. and Mrs. Rippleton Holabird invited them to dinner, a
  week after their coming.</p>

  <p>As Holabird's tweeds made Clay Tredgold's smartness seem hard and
  pretentious, so his dinner revealed Angus Duer's affairs in Chicago as
  mechanical and joyless and a little anxious. Everyone whom Martin met at the
  Holabirds' flat was a Somebody, though perhaps a minor Somebody: a goodish
  editor or a rising ethnologist; and all of them had Holabird's graceful
  casualness.</p>

  <p>The provincial Arrowsmiths arrived on time, therefore fifteen minutes
  early. Before the cocktails appeared, in old Venetian glass, Martin demanded,
  "Doctor, what problems are you getting after now in your physiology?"</p>

  <p>Holabird was transformed into an ardent boy. With a deprecatory "Would you
  really like to hear about 'em&mdash;you needn't be polite, you know!" he
  dashed into an exposition of his experiments, drawing sketches on the blank
  spaces in newspaper advertisements, on the back of a wedding invitation, on
  the flyleaf of a presentation novel, looking at Martin apologetically,
  learned yet gay.</p>

  <p>"We're working on the localization of brain functions. I think we've gone
  beyond Bolton and Flechsig. Oh, it's jolly exciting, exploring the brain.
  Look here!"</p>

  <p>His swift pencil was sketching the cerebrum; the brain lived and beat
  under his fingers.</p>

  <p>He threw down the paper. "I say, it's a shame to inflict my hobbies on
  you. Besides, the others are coming. Tell me, how is your work going? Are you
  comfortable at the Institute? Do you find you like people?"</p>

  <p>"Everybody except&mdash;To be frank, I'm jarred by Wickett."</p>

  <p>Generously, "I know. His manner is slightly aggressive. But you mustn't
  mind him; he's really an extraordinarily gifted biochemist. He's a
  bachelor&mdash;gives up everything for his work. And he doesn't really mean
  half the rude things he says. He detests me, among others. Has he mentioned
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Why, not especially&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have a feeling he goes around saying that I talk about my experiences
  in the war, which really isn't quite altogether true."</p>

  <p>"Yes," in a burst, "he did say that."</p>

  <p>"I do rather wish he wouldn't. So sorry to have offended him by going and
  getting wounded. I'll remember and not do it again! Such a fuss for a war
  record as insignificant as mine! What happened was: when the war broke out in
  '14 I was in England, studying under Sherrington. I pretended to be a
  Canadian and joined up with the medical corps and got mine within three weeks
  and got hoofed out, and that was the end of my magnificent career! Here's
  somebody arriving."</p>

  <p>His easy gallantry won Martin complete. Leora was equally captivated by
  Mrs. Holabird, and they went home from the dinner in new enchantment.</p>

  <p>So began for them a white light of happiness. Martin was scarce more
  blissful in his undisturbed work than in his life outside the laboratory.</p>

  <p>All the first week he forgot to ask what his salary was to be. Then it
  became a game to wait until the end of the month. Evenings, in little
  restaurants, Leora and he would speculate about it.</p>

  <p>The Institute would surely not pay him less than the twenty-five hundred
  dollars a year he had received at the Rouncefield Clinic, but on evenings
  when he was tired it dropped to fifteen hundred, and one evening when they
  had Burgundy he raised it to thirty-five hundred.</p>

  <p>When his first monthly check came, neat in a little sealed envelope, he
  dared not look at it. He took it home to Leora. In their hotel room they
  stared at the envelope as though it was likely to contain poison. Martin
  opened it shakily; he stared, and whispered, "Oh, those decent people!
  They're paying me&mdash;this is for four hundred and twenty
  dollars&mdash;they're paying me five thousand a year!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Holabird, a white kitten of a woman, helped Leora find a three-room
  flat with a spacious living-room, in an old house near Gramercy Park, and
  helped her furnish it with good bits, second-hand. When Martin was permitted
  to look he cried, "I hope we stay here for fifty years!"</p>

  <p>This was the Grecian isle where they found peace. Presently they had
  friends: the Holabirds, Dr. Billy Smith&mdash;the thin-bearded bio-chemist,
  who had an intelligent taste in music and German beer&mdash;an anatomist whom
  Martin met at a Winnemac alumni dinner, and always Max Gottlieb.</p>

  <p>Gottlieb had found his own serenity. In the Seventies he had a brown small
  flat, smelling of tobacco and leather books. His son Robert had graduated
  from City College and gone bustlingly into business. Miriam kept up her music
  while she guarded her father&mdash;a dumpling of a girl, holy fire behind the
  deceptive flesh. After an evening of Gottlieb's acrid doubting, Martin was
  inspired to hasten to the laboratory and attempt a thousand new queries into
  the laws of micro-organisms, a task which usually began with blasphemously
  destroying all the work he had recently done.</p>

  <p>Even Terry Wickett became more tolerable. Martin perceived that Wickett's
  snarls were partly a Clif Clawson misconception of humor, but partly a
  resentment, as great as Gottlieb's, of the morphological scientists who
  ticket things with the nicest little tickets, who name things and rename them
  and never analyze them. Wickett often worked all night; he was to be seen in
  shirt-sleeves, his sulky red hair rumpled, sitting with a stop-watch before a
  constant temperature bath for hours. Now and then it was a relief to have the
  surly intentness of Wickett instead of the elegance of Rippleton Holabird,
  which demanded from Martin so much painful elegance in turn, at a time when
  he was sunk beyond sounding in his experimentation.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch27"
     name="ch27">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">His work began fumblingly. There were days when, for all the
  joy of it, he dreaded lest Tubbs stride in and bellow, "What are you doing
  here? You're the wrong Arrowsmith! Get out!"</p>

  <p>He had isolated twenty strains of staphylococcus germs and he was testing
  them to discover which of them was most active in producing a hemolytic, a
  blood-disintegrating toxin, so that he might produce an antitoxin.</p>

  <p>There were picturesque moments when, after centrifuging, the organisms lay
  in coiling cloudy masses at the bottoms of the tubes; or when the red
  corpuscles were completely dissolved and the opaque brick-red liquid turned
  to the color of pale wine. But most of the processes were incomparably
  tedious: removing samples of the culture every six hours, making salt
  suspensions of corpuscles in small tubes, recording the results.</p>

  <p>He never knew they were tedious.</p>

  <p>Tubbs came in now and then, found him busy, patted his shoulder, said
  something which sounded like French and might even have been French, and gave
  vague encouragement; while Gottlieb imperturbably told him to go ahead, and
  now and then stirred him by showing his own note-books (they were full of
  figures and abbreviations, stupid-seeming as invoices of calico) or by
  speaking of his own work, in a vocabulary as heathenish as Tibetan magic:</p>

  <p>"Arrhenius and Madsen have made a contribution toward bringing immunity
  reactions under the mass action law, but I hope to show that antigen-antibody
  combinations occur in stoicheiometric proportions when certain variables are
  held constant."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I see," said Martin; and to himself: "Well, I darn near a
  quarter understand that! Oh, Lord, if they'll only give me a little time and
  not send me back to tacking up diphtheria posters!"</p>

  <p>When he had obtained a satisfactory toxin, Martin began his effort to find
  an antitoxin. He made vast experiments with no results. Sometimes he was
  certain that he had something, but when he rechecked his experiments he was
  bleakly certain that he hadn't. Once he rushed into Gottlieb's laboratory
  with the announcement of the antitoxin, whereupon with affection and several
  discomforting questions and the present of a box of real Egyptian cigarettes,
  Gottlieb showed him that he had not considered certain dilutions.</p>

  <p>With all his amateurish fumbling, Martin had one characteristic without
  which there can be no science: a wide-ranging, sniffing, snuffling,
  undignified, unself-dramatizing curiosity, and it drove him on.</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">While he puttered his insignificant way through the early
  years of the Great European War, the McGurk Institute had a lively existence
  under its placid surface.</p>

  <p>Martin may not have learned much in the matter of antibodies but he did
  learn the secret of the Institute, and he saw that behind all its quiet
  industriousness was Capitola McGurk, the Great White Uplifter.</p>

  <p>Capitola, Mrs. Ross McGurk, had been opposed to woman suffrage&mdash;until
  she learned that women were certain to get the vote&mdash;but she was a
  complete controller of virtuous affairs.</p>

  <p>Ross McGurk had bought the Institute not only to glorify himself but to
  divert Capitola and keep her itching fingers out of his shipping and mining
  and lumber interests, which would not too well have borne the investigations
  of a Great White Uplifter.</p>

  <p>Ross McGurk was at the time a man of fifty-four, second generation of
  California railroad men; a graduate of Yale; big, suave, dignified, cheerful,
  unscrupulous. Even in 1908, when he had founded the Institute, he had had too
  many houses, too many servants, too much food, and no children, because
  Capitola considered "that sort of thing detrimental to women with large
  responsibilities." In the Institute he found each year more satisfaction,
  more excuse for having lived.</p>

  <p>When Gottlieb arrived, McGurk went up to look him over. McGurk had bullied
  Dr. Tubbs now and then; Tubbs was compelled to scurry to his office as though
  he were a messenger boy; yet when he saw the saturnine eyes of Gottlieb,
  McGurk looked interested; and the two men, the bulky, clothes-conscious,
  powerful, reticent American and the cynical, simple, power-despising
  European, became friends. McGurk would slip away from a conference affecting
  the commerce of a whole West Indian island to sit on a high stool, silent,
  and watch Gottlieb work.</p>

  <p>"Some day when I quit hustling and wake up, I'm going to become your
  garcon, Max," said McGurk, and Gottlieb answered, "I don't know&mdash;you haf
  imagination, Ross, but I t'ink you are too late to get a training in reality.
  Now if you do not mind eating at Childs's, we will avoid your very
  expostulatory Regal Hall, and I shall invite you to lunch."</p>

  <p>But Capitola did not join their communion.</p>

  <p>Gottlieb's arrogance had returned, and with Capitola McGurk he needed it.
  She had such interesting little problems for her husband's pensioners to
  attack. Once, in excitement, she visited Gottlieb's laboratory to tell him
  that large numbers of persons die of cancer, and why didn't he drop this
  anti-whatever-it-was and find a cure for cancer, which would be ever so nice
  for all of them.</p>

  <p>But her real grievance arose when, after Rippleton Holabird had agreed to
  give midnight supper on the roof of the Institute to one of her most
  intellectual dinner-parties, she telephoned to Gottlieb, merely asking,
  "Would it be too much trouble for you to go down and open your lab, so we can
  all enjoy just a tiny peep at it?" and he answered:</p>

  <p>"It would! Good night!"</p>

  <p>Capitola protested to her husband. He listened&mdash;at least he seemed to
  listen&mdash;and remarked:</p>

  <p>"Cap, I don't mind your playing the fool with the footmen. They've got to
  stand it. But if you get funny with Max, I'll simply shut up the whole
  Institute, and then you won't have anything to talk about at the Colony Club.
  And it certainly does beat the deuce that a man worth thirty million
  dollars&mdash;at least a fellow that's got that much&mdash;can't find a clean
  pair of pajamas. No, I <i>won't</i> have a valet! Oh, please now, Capitola,
  please quit being high-minded and let me go to sleep, will you!"</p>

  <p>But Capitola was uncontrollable, especially in the matter of the monthly
  dinners which she gave at the Institute.</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">The first of the McGurk Scientific Dinners which Martin and
  Leora witnessed was a particularly important and explanatory dinner, because
  the guest of honor was Major-General Sir Isaac Mallard, the London surgeon,
  who was in America with a British War Mission. He had already beautifully let
  himself be shown through the Institute; he had been Sir Isaac'd by Dr. Tubbs
  and every researcher except Terry Wickett; he remembered meeting Rippleton
  Holabird in London, or said he remembered; and he admired Gladys the
  Centrifuge.</p>

  <p>The dinner began with one misfortune in that Terry Wickett, who hitherto
  could be depended upon to stay decently away, now appeared, volunteering to
  the wife of an ex-ambassador, "I simply couldn't duck this spread, with dear
  Sir Isaac coming. Say, if I hadn't told you, you wouldn't hardly think my
  dress-suit was rented, would you! Have you noticed that Sir Isaac is getting
  so he doesn't tear the carpet with his spurs any more? I wonder if he still
  kills all his mastoid patients?"</p>

  <p>There was vast music, vaster food; there were uncomfortable scientists
  explaining to golden cooing ladies, in a few words, just what they were up to
  and what in the next twenty years they hoped to be up to; there were the
  cooing ladies themselves, observing in tones of pretty rebuke, "But I'm
  afraid you haven't yet made it as clear as you might." There were the cooing
  ladies' husbands&mdash;college graduates, manipulators of oil stocks or of
  corporation law&mdash;who sat ready to give to anybody who desired it their
  opinion that while antitoxins might be racy, what we really needed was a good
  substitute for rubber.</p>

  <p>There was Rippleton Holabird, being charming.</p>

  <p>And in the pause of the music, there suddenly was Terry Wickett, saying to
  quite an important woman, one of Capitola's most useful friends, "Yes, his
  name is spelled G-o-t-t-l-i-e-b but it's pronounced Gottdamn."</p>

  <p>But such outsiders as Wickett and such silent riders as Martin and Leora
  and such totally absent members as Max Gottlieb were few, and the dinner
  waxed magnificently to a love-feast when Dr. Tubbs and Sir Isaac Mallard paid
  compliments to each other, to Capitola, to the sacred soil of France, to
  brave little Belgium, to American hospitality, to British love of privacy,
  and to the extremely interesting things a young man with a sense of
  co-operation might do in modern science.</p>

  <p>The guests were conducted through the Institute. They inspected the marine
  biology aquarium, the pathological museum, and the animal house, at sight of
  which one sprightly lady demanded of Wickett, "Oh, the poor little guinea
  pigs and darling rabbicks! Now honestly, Doctor, don't you think it would be
  ever so much nicer if you let them go free, and just worked with your
  test-tubes?"</p>

  <p>A popular physician, whose practice was among rich women, none of them
  west of Fifth Avenue, said to the sprightly lady, "I think you're absolutely
  right. I never have to kill any poor wee little beasties to get my
  knowledge!"</p>

  <p>With astounding suddenness Wickett took his hat and went away.</p>

  <p>The sprightly lady said, "You see, he didn't dare stand up to a real
  argument. Oh, Dr. Arrowsmith, of course I know how wonderful Ross McGurk and
  Dr. Tubbs and all of you are, but I must say I'm disappointed in your
  laboratories. I'd expected there'd be such larky retorts and electric
  furnaces and everything but, honestly, I don't see a single thing that's
  interesting, and I do think all you clever people ought to do
  <i>something</i> for us, now that you've coaxed us all the way down here.
  Can't you or somebody create life out of turtle eggs, or whatever it is? Oh,
  please do! Pretty please! Or at least, do put on one of these cunnin' dentist
  coats that you wear."</p>

  <p>Then Martin also went rapidly away, accompanied by a furious Leora, who in
  the taxicab announced that she had desired to taste the champagne-cup which
  she had observed on the buffet, and that her husband was little short of a
  fool.</p><br>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">Thus, however satisfying his work, Martin began to wonder
  about the perfection of his sanctuary; to wonder why Gottlieb should be so
  insulting at lunch to neat Dr. Sholtheis, the industrious head of the
  Department of Epidemiology, and why Dr. Sholtheis should endure the insults;
  to wonder why Dr. Tubbs, when he wandered into one's laboratory, should
  gurgle, "The one thing for you to keep in view in all your work is the ideal
  of co-operation"; to wonder why so ardent a physiologist as Rippleton
  Holabird should all day long be heard conferring with Tubbs instead of
  sweating at his bench.</p>

  <p>Holabird had, five years before, done one bit of research which had taken
  his name into scientific journals throughout the world: he had studied the
  effect of the extirpation of the anterior lobes of a dog's brain on its
  ability to find its way through the laboratory. Martin had read of that
  research before he had thought of going to McGurk; on his arrival he was
  thrilled to have it chronicled by the master himself; but when he had heard
  Holabird refer to it a dozen times he was considerably less thrilled, and he
  speculated whether all his life Holabird would go on being "the
  man&mdash;<i>you</i> remember&mdash;the chap that did the big stunt, whatever
  it was, with locomotion in dogs or something."</p>

  <p>Martin speculated still more as he perceived that all his colleagues were
  secretly grouped in factions.</p>

  <p>Tubbs, Holabird, and perhaps Tubbs's secretary, Pearl Robbins, were the
  ruling caste. It was murmured that Holabird hoped some day to be made
  Assistant Director, an office which was to be created for him. Gottlieb,
  Terry Wickett, and Dr. Nicholas Yeo, that long-mustached and rustic biologist
  whom Martin had first taken for a carpenter, formed an independent faction of
  their own, and however much he disliked the boisterous Wickett, Martin was
  dragged into it.</p>

  <p>Dr. William Smith, with his little beard and a notion of mushrooms formed
  in Paris, kept to himself. Dr. Sholtheis, who had been born to a synagogue in
  Russia but who was now the most zealous high-church Episcopalian in Yonkers,
  was constantly in his polite small way trying to have his scientific work
  commended by Gottlieb. In the Department of Bio-Physics, the good-natured
  chief was reviled and envied by his own assistant. And in the whole Institute
  there was not one man who would, in all states of liquor, assert that the
  work of any other scientist anywhere was completely sound, or that there was
  a single one of his rivals who had not stolen ideas from him. No
  rocking-chair clique on a summer-hotel porch, no knot of actors, ever
  whispered more scandal or hinted more warmly of complete idiocy in their
  confreres than did these uplifted scientists.</p>

  <p>But these discoveries Martin could shut out by closing his door, and he
  had that to do now which deafened him to the mutters of intrigue.</p><br>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="first">For once Gottlieb did not amble into his laboratory but
  curtly summoned him. In a corner of Gottlieb's office, a den opening from his
  laboratory, was Terry Wickett, rolling a cigarette and looking sardonic.</p>

  <p>Gottlieb observed, "Martin, I haf taken the privilege of talking you over
  with Terry, and we concluded that you haf done well enough now so it is time
  you stop puttering and go to work."</p>

  <p>"I thought I was working, sir!"</p>

  <p>All the wide placidness of his halcyon days was gone; he saw himself
  driven back to Pickerbaughism.</p>

  <p>Wickett intruded, "No, you haven't. You've just been showing that you're a
  bright boy who might work if he only knew something."</p>

  <p>While Martin turned on Wickett with a "Who the devil are you?" expression,
  Gottlieb went on:</p>

  <p>"The fact is, Martin, you can do nothing till you know a little
  mathematics. If you are not going to be a cookbook bacteriologist, like most
  of them, you must be able to handle some of the fundamentals of science. All
  living things are physicochemical machines. Then how can you make progress if
  you do not know physical chemistry, and how can you know physical chemistry
  without much mathematics?"</p>

  <p>"Yuh," said Wickett, "you're lawn-mowing and daisy-picking, not
  digging."</p>

  <p>Martin faced them. "But rats, Wickett, a man can't know everything. I'm a
  bacteriologist, not a physicist. Strikes me a fellow ought to use his
  insight, not just a chest of tools, to make discoveries. A good sailor could
  find his way at sea even if he didn't have instruments, and a whole
  Lusitania-ful of junk wouldn't make a good sailor out of a dub. Man ought to
  develop his brain, not depend on tools."</p>

  <p>"Ye-uh, but if there were charts and quadrants in existence, a sailor that
  cruised off without 'em would be a chump!"</p>

  <p>For half an hour Martin defended himself, not too politely, before the
  gem-like Gottlieb, the granite Wickett. All the while he knew that he was
  sickeningly ignorant.</p>

  <p>They ceased to take interest. Gottlieb was looking at his notebooks,
  Wickett was clumping off to work. Martin glared at Gottlieb. The man meant so
  much that he could be furious with him as he would have been with Leora, with
  his own self.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry you think I don't know anything," he raged, and departed with
  the finest dramatic violence. He slammed into his own laboratory, felt freed,
  then wretched. Without volition, like a drunken man, he stormed to Wickett's
  room, protesting, "I suppose you're right. My physical chemistry is nix, and
  my math rotten. What am I going to do&mdash;what am I going to do?"</p>

  <p>The embarrassed barbarian grumbled, "Well, for Pete's sake, Slim, don't
  worry. The old man and I were just egging you on. Fact is, he's tickled to
  death about the careful way you're starting in. About the math&mdash;probably
  you're better off than the Holy Wren and Tubbs right now; you've forgotten
  all the math you ever knew, and they never knew any. Gosh all fishhooks!
  Science is supposed to mean Knowledge&mdash;from the Greek, a handsome
  language spoken by the good old booze-hoisting Hellenes&mdash;and the way
  most of the science boys resent having to stop writing little jeweled papers
  or giving teas and sweat at getting some knowledge certainly does make me a
  grand booster for the human race. My own math isn't any too good, Slim, but
  if you'd like to have me come around evenings and tutor you&mdash;Free, I
  mean!"</p>

  <p>Thus began the friendship between Martin and Terry Wickett; thus began a
  change in Martin's life whereby he gave up three or four hours of wholesome
  sleep each night to grind over matters which everyone is assumed to know, and
  almost everyone does not know.</p>

  <p>He took up algebra; found that he had forgotten most of it; cursed over
  the competition of the indefatigable A and the indolent B who walk from Y to
  Z; hired a Columbia tutor; and finished the subject, with a spurt of
  something like interest in regard to quadratic equations, in six
  weeks...while Leora listened, watched, waited, made sandwiches, and laughed
  at the tutor's jokes.</p>

  <p>By the end of his first nine months at McGurk, Martin had reviewed
  trigonometry and analytic geometry and he was finding differential calculus
  romantic. But he made the mistake of telling Terry Wickett how much he
  knew.</p>

  <p>Terry croaked, "Don't trust math too much, son," and he so confused him
  with references to the thermo-dynamical derivation of the mass action law,
  and to the oxidation reduction potential, that he stumbled again into raging
  humility, again saw himself an impostor and a tenth-rater.</p>

  <p>He read the classics of physical science: Copernicus and Galileo,
  Lavoisier, Newton, LaPlace, Descartes, Faraday. He became completely bogged
  in Newton's "Fluxions"; he spoke of Newton to Tubbs and found that the
  illustrious Director knew nothing about him. He cheerfully mentioned this to
  Terry, and was shockingly cursed for his conceit as a "nouveau cultured," as
  a "typical enthusiastic convert," and so returned to the work whose end is
  satisfying because there is never an end.</p>

  <p>His life did not seem edifying nor in any degree amusing. When Tubbs
  peeped into his laboratory he found a humorless young man going about his
  tests of hemolytic toxins with no apparent flair for the Real Big Thing in
  Science, which was co-operation and being efficient. Tubbs tried to set him
  straight with "Are you quite sure you're following a regular demarked line in
  your work?"</p>

  <p>It was Leora who bore the real tedium.</p>

  <p>She sat quiet (a frail child, only up to one's shoulder, not nine minutes
  older than at marriage, nine years before), or she napped inoffensively, in
  the long living-room of their flat, while he worked over his dreary
  digit-infested books till one, till two, and she politely awoke to let him
  worry at her, "But look here now, I've got to keep up my research at the same
  time. God, I am so tired!"</p>

  <p>She dragged him away for an illegal five-day walk on Cape Cod, in March.
  He sat between the Twin Lights at Chatham, and fumed, "I'm going back and
  tell Terry and Gottlieb they can go to the devil with their crazy physical
  chemistry. I've had enough, now I've done math," and she commented, "Yes, I
  certainly would&mdash;though isn't it funny how Dr. Gottlieb always seems to
  be right?"</p>

  <p>He was so absorbed in staphylolysin and in calculus that he did not
  realize the world was about to be made safe for democracy. He was a little
  dazed when America entered the war.</p><br>

  <h3>VI.</h3>

  <p class="first">Dr. Tubbs dashed to Washington to offer the services of the
  Institute to the War Department.</p>

  <p>All the members of the staff, except Gottlieb and two others who declined
  to be so honored, were made officers and told to run out and buy nice
  uniforms.</p>

  <p>Tubbs became a Colonel, Rippleton Holabird a Major, Martin and Wickett and
  Billy Smith were Captains. But the garcons had no military rank whatever, nor
  any military duties except the polishing of brown riding-boots and leather
  puttees, which the several warriors wore as pleased their fancies or their
  legs. And the most belligerent of all, Miss Pearl Robbins, she who at tea
  heroically slaughtered not only German men but all their women and viperine
  children, was wickedly unrecognized and had to make up a uniform for
  herself.</p>

  <p>The only one of them who got nearer to the front than Liberty Street was
  Terry Wickett, who suddenly asked for leave, was transferred to the
  artillery, and sailed off to France.</p>

  <p>He apologized to Martin: "I'm ashamed of chucking my work like this, and I
  certainly don't want to kill Germans&mdash;I mean not any more'n I want to
  kill most people&mdash;but I never could resist getting into a big show. Say,
  Slim, keep an eye on Pa Gottlieb, will you? This has hit him bad. He's got a
  bunch of nephews and so on in the German army, and the patriots like Big Foot
  Pearl will give an exhibit of idealism by persecuting him. So long, Slim,
  take care y'self."</p>

  <p>Martin had vaguely protested at being herded into the army. The war was to
  him chiefly another interruption to his work, like Pickerbaughism, like
  earning his living at Wheatsylvania. But when he had gone strutting forth in
  uniform, it was so enjoyable that for several weeks he was a standard
  patriot. He had never looked so well, so taut and erect, as in khaki. It was
  enchanting to be saluted by privates, quite as enchanting to return the
  salute in the dignified, patronizing, all-comrades-together splendor which
  Martin shared with the other doctors, professors, lawyers, brokers, authors,
  and former socialist intellectuals who were his fellow-officers.</p>

  <p>But in a month the pleasures of being a hero became mechanical, and Martin
  longed for soft shirts, easy shoes, and clothes with reasonable pockets. His
  puttees were a nuisance to wear and an inferno to put on; his collar pinched
  his neck and jabbed his chin; and it was wearing on a man who sat up till
  three, on the perilous duty of studying calculus, to be snappy at every
  salute.</p>

  <p>Under the martinet eye of Col. Director Dr. A. DeWitt Tubbs he had to wear
  his uniform, at least recognizable portions of it, at the Institute, but by
  evening he slipped into the habit of sneaking into citizen clothes, and when
  he went with Leora to the movies he had an agreeable feeling of being Absent
  Without Leave, of risking at every street corner arrest by the Military
  Police and execution at dawn.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately no M.P. ever looked at him. But one evening when in an
  estimable and innocent manner he was looking at the remains of a gunman who
  had just been murdered by another gunman, he realized that Major Rippleton
  Holabird was standing by, glaring. For once the Major was unpleasant:</p>

  <p>"Captain, does it seem to you that this is quite playing the game, to wear
  mufti? We, unfortunately, with our scientific work, haven't the privilege of
  joining the Boys who are up against the real thing, but we are under orders
  just as if we were in the trenches&mdash;where <i>some</i> of us would so
  much like to be again! Captain, I trust I shall never again see you breaking
  the order about being in uniform, or&mdash;uh&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Martin blurted to Leora, later:</p>

  <p>"I'm sick of hearing about his being wounded. Nothing that I can see to
  prevent his going back to the trenches. Wound's all right now. I want to be
  patriotic, but my patriotism is chasing antitoxins, doing my job, not wearing
  a particular kind of pants and a particular set of ideas about the Germans.
  Mind you, I'm anti-German all right&mdash;I think they're probably just as
  bad as we are. Oh, let's go back and do some more calculus...Darling, my
  working nights doesn't bore you too much, does it?"</p>

  <p>Leora had cunning. When she could not be enthusiastic, she could be
  unannoyingly silent.</p>

  <p>At the Institute Martin perceived that he was not the only defender of his
  country who was not comfortable in the garb of heroes. The most dismal of the
  staff-members was Dr. Nicholas Yeo, the Yankee sandy-mustached head of the
  Department of Biology.</p>

  <p>Yeo had put on Major's uniform, but he never felt neighborly with it. (He
  knew he was a Major, because Col. Dr. Tubbs had told him he was, and he knew
  that this was a Major's uniform because the clothing salesman said so.) He
  walked out of the McGurk Building in a melancholy, deprecatory way, with one
  breeches leg bulging over his riding-boots; and however piously he tried, he
  never remembered to button his blouse over the violet-flowered shirts which,
  he often confided, you could buy ever so cheap on Eighth Avenue.</p>

  <p>But Major Dr. Yeo had one military triumph. He hoarsely explained to
  Martin, as they were marching to the completely militarized dining-hall:</p>

  <p>"Say, Arrowsmith, do you ever get balled up about this saluting? Darn it,
  I never can figure out what all these insignia mean. One time I took a
  Salvation Army Lieutenant for a Y.M.C.A. General, or maybe he was a Portygee.
  But I've got the idea now!" Yeo laid his finger beside his large nose, and
  produced wisdom: "Whenever I see any fellow in uniform that looks older than
  I am, I salute him&mdash;my nephew, Ted, has drilled me so I salute swell
  now&mdash;and if he don't salute back, well, Lord, I just think about my work
  and don't fuss. If you look at it scientifically, this military life isn't so
  awful' hard after all!"</p><br>

  <h3>VII.</h3>

  <p class="first">Always, in Paris or in Bonn, Max Gottlieb had looked to
  America as a land which, in its freedom from Royalist tradition, in its
  contact with realities of cornfields and blizzards and town-meetings, had set
  its face against the puerile pride of war. He believed that he had ceased to
  be a German, now, and become a countryman of Lincoln.</p>

  <p>The European War was the one thing, besides his discharge from Winnemac,
  which had ever broken his sardonic serenity. In the war he could see no
  splendor nor hope, but only crawling tragedy. He treasured his months of work
  and good talk in France, in England, in Italy; he loved his French and
  English and Italian friends as he loved his ancient Korpsbruder, and very
  well indeed beneath his mocking did he love the Germans with whom he had
  drudged and drunk.</p>

  <p>His sister's sons&mdash;on home-craving vacations he had seen them, in
  babyhood, in boyhood, in ruffling youngmanhood&mdash;went out with the
  Kaiser's colors in 1914; one of them became an Oberst, much decorated, one
  existed insignificantly, and one was dead and stinking in ten days. This he
  sadly endured, as later he endured his son Robert's going out as an American
  lieutenant, to fight his own cousins. What struck down this man to whom
  abstractions and scientific laws were more than kindly flesh was the mania of
  hate which overcame the unmilitaristic America to which he had emigrated in
  protest against Junkerdom.</p>

  <p>Incredulously he perceived women asserting that all Germans were
  baby-killers, universities barring the language of Heine, orchestras
  outlawing the music of Beethoven, professors in uniform bellowing at clerks,
  and the clerks never protesting.</p>

  <p>It is uncertain whether the real hurt was to his love for America or to
  his egotism, that he should have guessed so grotesquely; it is curious that
  he who had so denounced the machine-made education of the land should yet
  have been surprised when it turned blithely to the old, old, mechanical
  mockeries of war.</p>

  <p>When the Institute sanctified the war, he found himself regarded not as
  the great and impersonal immunologist but as a suspect German Jew.</p>

  <p>True, the Terry who went off to the artillery did not look upon him
  dourly, but Major Rippleton Holabird became erect and stiff when they passed
  in the corridor. When Gottlieb insisted to Tubbs at lunch, "I am villing to
  admit every virtue of the French&mdash;I am very fond of that so individual
  people&mdash;but on the theory of probabilities I suggest that there must be
  some good Germans out of sixty millions," then Col. Dr. Tubbs commanded, "In
  this time of world tragedy, it does not seem to me particularly becoming to
  try to be flippant, Dr. Gottlieb!"</p>

  <p>In shops and on the elevated train, little red-faced sweaty people when
  they heard his accent glared at him, and growled one to another, "There's one
  of them damn' barb'rous well-poisoning Huns!" and however contemptuous he
  might be, however much he strove for ignoring pride, their nibbling reduced
  him from arrogant scientist to an insecure, raw-nerved, shrinking old
  man.</p>

  <p>And once a hostess who of old time had been proud to know him, a hostess
  whose maiden name was Straufnabel and who had married into the famous old
  Anglican family of Rosemont when Gottlieb bade her "Auf Wiedersehen" cried
  out upon him, "Dr. Gottlieb, I'm very sorry, but the use of that disgusting
  language is not permitted in this house!"</p>

  <p>He had almost recovered from the anxieties of Winnemac and the Hunziker
  factory; he had begun to expand, to entertain people&mdash;scientists,
  musicians, talkers. Now he was thrust back into himself. With Terry gone, he
  trusted only Miriam and Martin and Ross McGurk; and his deep-set
  wrinkle-lidded eyes looked ever on sadness.</p>

  <p>But he could still be tart. He suggested that Capitola ought to have in
  the window of her house a Service Flag with a star for every person at the
  Institute who had put on uniform.</p>

  <p>She took it quite seriously, and did it.</p><br>

  <h3>VIII.</h3>

  <p class="first">The military duties of the McGurk staff did not consist
  entirely in wearing uniforms, receiving salutes, and listening to Col. Dr.
  Tubbs's luncheon lectures on "the part America will inevitably play in the
  reconstruction of a Democratic Europe."</p>

  <p>They prepared sera; the assistant in the Department of Bio-Physics was
  inventing electrified wire entanglements; Dr. Billy Smith, who six months
  before had been singing Studentenlieder at Luchow's, was working on poison
  gas to be used against all singers of Lieder; and to Martin was assigned the
  manufacture of lipovaccine, a suspension of finely ground typhoid and
  paratyphoid organisms in oil. It was a greasy job, and dull. Martin was
  faithful enough about it, and gave to it almost every morning, but he
  blasphemed more than usual and he unholily welcomed scientific papers in
  which lipovaccines were condemned as inferior to ordinary salt solutions.</p>

  <p>He was conscious of Gottlieb's sorrowing and tried to comfort him.</p>

  <p>It was Martin's most pitiful fault that he was not very kind to shy people
  and lonely people and stupid old people; he was not cruel to them, he simply
  was unconscious of them or so impatient of their fumbling that he avoided
  them. Whenever Leora taxed him with it he grumbled:</p>

  <p>"Well, but&mdash;I'm too much absorbed in my work, or in doping stuff out,
  to waste time on morons. And it's a good thing. Most people above the grade
  of hog do so much chasing around after a lot of vague philanthropy that they
  never get anything done&mdash;and most of your confounded shy people get
  spiritually pauperized. Oh, it's so much easier to be good-natured and
  purring and self-congratulatory and generally footless than it is to pound
  ahead and keep yourself strictly for your own work, the work that gets
  somewhere. Very few people have the courage to be decently selfish&mdash;not
  answer letters&mdash;and demand the right to work. If they had their way,
  these sentimentalists would've had a Newton&mdash;yes, or probably a
  Christ!&mdash;giving up everything they did for the world to address meetings
  and listen to the troubles of cranky old maids. Nothing takes so much courage
  as to keep hard and clear-headed."</p>

  <p>And he hadn't even that courage.</p>

  <p>When Leora had made complaint, he would be forcibly kind to all sorts of
  alarmed stray beggars for a day or two, then drift back into his absorption.
  There were but two people whose unhappiness could always pierce him: Leora
  and Gottlieb.</p>

  <p>Though he was busier than he had known anyone could ever be, with
  lipovaccines in the morning, physical chemistry in the evening and, at all
  sorts of intense hours between, the continuation of his staphylolysin
  research, he gave what time he could to seeking out Gottlieb and warming his
  vanity by reverent listening.</p>

  <p>Then his research wiped out everything else, made him forget Gottlieb and
  Leora and all his briskness about studying, made him turn his war work over
  to others, and confounded night and day in one insane flaming blur as he
  realized that he had something not unworthy of a Gottlieb, something at the
  mysterious source of life.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch28"
     name="ch28">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">Captain Martin Arrowsmith, M.R.C., came home to his good
  wife Leora, wailing, "I'm so rotten tired, and I feel kind of discouraged. I
  haven't accomplished a darn' thing in this whole year at McGurk. Sterile. No
  good. And I'm hanged if I'll study calculus this evening. Let's go to the
  movies. Won't even change to regular human clothes. Too tired."</p>

  <p>"All right, honey," said Leora. "But let's have dinner here. I bought a
  wonderful ole fish this afternoon."</p>

  <p>Through the film Martin gave his opinion, as a captain and as a doctor,
  that it seemed improbable a mother should not know her daughter after an
  absence of ten years. He was restless and rational, which is not a mood in
  which to view the cinema. When they came blinking out of that darkness lit
  only from the shadowy screen, he snorted, "I'm going back to the lab. I'll
  put you in a taxi."</p>

  <p>"Oh, let the beastly thing go for one night."</p>

  <p>"Now that's unfair! I haven't worked late for three or four nights
  now!"</p>

  <p>"Then take me along."</p>

  <p>"Nope. I have a hunch I may be working all night."</p>

  <p>Liberty Street, as he raced along it, was sleeping below its towers. It
  was McGurk's order that the elevator to the Institute should run all night,
  and indeed three or four of the twenty staff-members did sometimes use it
  after respectable hours.</p>

  <p>That morning Martin had isolated a new strain of staphylococcus bacteria
  from the gluteal carbuncle of a patient in the Lower Manhattan Hospital, a
  carbuncle which was healing with unusual rapidity. He had placed a bit of the
  pus in broth and incubated it. In eight hours a good growth of bacteria had
  appeared. Before going wearily home he had returned the flask to the
  incubator.</p>

  <p>He was not particularly interested in it, and now, in his laboratory, he
  removed his military blouse, looked down to the lights on the blue-black
  river, smoked a little, thought what a dog he was not to be gentler to Leora,
  and damned Bert Tozer and Pickerbaugh and Tubbs and anybody else who was
  handy to his memory before he absent-mindedly wavered to the incubator, and
  found that the flask, in which there should have been a perceptible cloudy
  growth, had no longer any signs of bacteria&mdash;of staphylococci.</p>

  <p>"Now what the hell!" he cried. "Why, the broth's as clear as when I seeded
  it! Now what the&mdash;Think of this fool accident coming up just when I was
  going to start something new!"</p>

  <p>He hastened from the incubator, in a closet off the corridor, to his
  laboratory and, holding the flask under a strong light, made certain that he
  had seen aright. He fretfully prepared a slide from the flask contents and
  examined it under the microscope. He discovered nothing but shadows of what
  had been bacteria: thin outlines, the form still there but the cell substance
  gone; minute skeletons on an infinitesimal battlefield.</p>

  <p>He raised his head from the microscope, rubbed his tired eyes,
  reflectively rubbed his neck&mdash;his blouse was off, his collar on the
  floor, his shirt open at the throat. He considered:</p>

  <p>"Something funny here. This culture was growing all right, and now it's
  committed suicide. Never heard of bugs doing that before. I've hit something!
  What caused it? Some chemical change? Something organic?"</p>

  <p>Now in Martin Arrowsmith there were no decorative heroisms, no genius for
  amours, no exotic wit, no edifyingly borne misfortunes. He presented neither
  picturesque elegance nor a moral message. He was full of hasty faults and of
  perverse honesty; a young man often unkindly, often impolite. But he had one
  gift: curiosity whereby he saw nothing as ordinary. Had he been an acceptable
  hero, like Major Rippleton Holabird, he would have chucked the contents of
  the flask into the sink, avowed with pretty modesty, "Silly! I've made some
  error!" and gone his ways. But Martin, being Martin, walked prosaically up
  and down his laboratory, snarling. "Now there was some <i>cause</i> for that,
  and I'm going to find out what it was."</p>

  <p>He did have one romantic notion: he would telephone to Leora and tell her
  that splendor was happening, and she wasn't to worry about him. He fumbled
  down the corridor, lighting matches, trying to find electric switches.</p>

  <p>At night all halls are haunted. Even in the smirkingly new McGurk Building
  there had been a bookkeeper who committed suicide. As Martin groped he was
  shakily conscious of feet padding behind him, of shapes which leered from
  doorways and insolently vanished, of ancient bodiless horrors, and when he
  found the switch he rejoiced in the blessing and security of sudden light
  that re-created the world.</p>

  <p>At the Institute telephone switchboard he plugged in wherever it seemed
  reasonable. Once he thought he was talking to Leora, but it proved to be a
  voice, sexless and intolerant, which said "Number pleeeeeze" with a taut
  alertness impossible to anyone so indolent as Leora. Once it was a voice
  which slobbered, "Is this Sarah?" then, "I don't want <i>you!</i> Ring off,
  will yuh!" Once a girl pleaded, "Honestly, Billy, I did try to get there but
  the boss came in at five and he said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>As for the rest it was only a blurring; the sound of seven million people
  hungry for sleep or love or money.</p>

  <p>He observed, "Oh, rats, I guess Lee'll have gone to bed by now," and felt
  his way back to the laboratory.</p>

  <p>A detective, hunting the murderer of bacteria, he stood with his head
  back, scratching his chin, scratching his memory for like cases of
  microorganisms committing suicide or being slain without perceptible cause.
  He rushed up-stairs to the library, consulted the American and English
  authorities and, laboriously, the French and German. He found nothing.</p>

  <p>He worried lest there might, somehow, have been no living staphylococci in
  the pus which he had used for seeding the broth&mdash;none there to die. At a
  hectic run, not stopping for lights, bumping corners and sliding on the too
  perfect tile floor, he skidded down the stairs and galloped through the
  corridors to his room. He found the remains of the original pus, made a smear
  on a glass slide, and stained it with gentian-violet, nervously dribbling out
  one drop of the gorgeous dye. He sprang to the microscope. As he bent over
  the brass tube and focused the objective, into the gray-lavender circular
  field of vision rose to existence the grape-like clusters of staphylococcus
  germs, purple dots against the blank plane.</p>

  <p>"Staph in it, all right!" he shouted.</p>

  <p>Then he forgot Leora, war, night, weariness, success, everything, as he
  charged into preparations for an experiment, his first great experiment. He
  paced furiously, rather dizzy. He shook himself into calmness and settled
  down at a table, among rings and spirals of cigarette smoke, to list on small
  sheets of paper all the possible causes of suicide in the bacteria&mdash;all
  the questions he had to answer and the experiments which should answer
  them.</p>

  <p>It might be that alkali in an improperly cleaned flask had caused the
  clearing of the culture. It might be some anti-staph substance existing in
  the pus, or something liberated by the staphylococci themselves. It might be
  some peculiarity of this particular broth.</p>

  <p>Each of these had to be tested.</p>

  <p>He pried open the door of the glass-storeroom, shattering the lock. He
  took new flasks, cleaned them, plugged them with cotton, and placed them in
  the hot-air oven to sterilize. He found other batches of broth&mdash;as a
  matter of fact he stole them, from Gottlieb's private and highly sacred
  supply in the ice-box. He filtered some of the clarified culture through a
  sterile porcelain filter, and added it to his regular staphylococcus
  strains.</p>

  <p>And, perhaps most important of all, he discovered that he was out of
  cigarettes.</p>

  <p>Incredulously he slapped each of his pockets, and went the round and
  slapped them all over again. He looked into his discarded military blouse;
  had a cheering idea about having seen cigarettes in a drawer; did not find
  them; and brazenly marched into the room where hung the aprons and jackets of
  the technicians. Furiously he pilfered pockets, and found a dozen beautiful
  cigarettes in a wrinkled and flattened paper case.</p>

  <p>To test each of the four possible causes of the flask's clearing he
  prepared and seeded with bacteria a series of flasks under varying
  conditions, and set them away in the incubator at body temperature. Till the
  last flask was put away, his hand was steady, his worn face calm. He was
  above all nervousness, free from all uncertainty, a professional going about
  his business.</p>

  <p>By this time it was six o'clock of a fine wide August morning, and as he
  ceased his swift work, as taut nerves slackened, he looked out of his lofty
  window and was conscious of the world below: bright roofs, jubilant towers,
  and a high-decked Sound steamer swaggering up the glossy river.</p>

  <p>He was completely fagged; he was, like a surgeon after a battle, like a
  reporter during an earthquake, perhaps a little insane; but sleepy he was
  not. He cursed the delay involved in the growth of the bacteria, without
  which he could not discover the effect of the various sorts of broths and
  bacterial strains, but choked his impatience.</p>

  <p>He mounted the noisy slate stairway to the lofty world of the roof. He
  listened at the door of the Institute's animal house. The guinea pigs, awake
  and nibbling, were making a sound like that of a wet cloth rubbed on glass in
  window-cleaning. He stamped his foot, and in fright they broke out in their
  strange sound of fear, like the cooing of doves.</p>

  <p>He marched violently up and down, refreshed by the soaring sky, till he
  was calmed to hunger. Again he went pillaging. He found chocolate belonging
  to an innocent technician; he even invaded the office of the Director and in
  the desk of the Diana-like Pearl Robbins unearthed tea and a kettle (as well
  as a lip-stick, and a love-letter beginning "My Little Ickles"). He made
  himself a profoundly bad cup of tea, then, his whole body dragging, returned
  to his table to set down elaborately, in a shabby, nearly-filled note-book,
  every step of his experiment.</p>

  <p>After seven he worked out the operation of the telephone switchboard and
  called Lower Manhattan Hospital. Could Dr. Arrowsmith have some more pus from
  the same carbuncle? What? It'd healed? Curse it! No more of that
  material.</p>

  <p>He hesitated over waiting for Gottlieb's arrival, to tell him of the
  discovery, but determined to keep silence till he should have determined
  whether it was an accident. Eyes wide, too wrought up to sleep in the subway,
  he fled uptown to tell Leora. He had to tell someone! Waves of fear, doubt,
  certainty, and fear again swept over him; his ears rang and his hands
  trembled.</p>

  <p>He rushed up to the flat; he bawled "Lee! Lee!" Before he had unlocked the
  door. And she was gone.</p>

  <p>He gaped. The flat breathed emptiness. He searched it again. She had slept
  there, she had had a cup of coffee, but she had vanished.</p>

  <p>He was at once worried lest there had been an accident, and furious that
  she should not have been here at the great hour. Sullenly he made breakfast
  for himself...It is strange that excellent bacteriologists and chemists
  should scramble eggs so waterily, should make such bitter coffee and be so
  casual about dirty spoons...By the time he had finished the mess he was ready
  to believe that Leora had left him forever. He quavered, "I've neglected her
  a lot." Sluggishly, an old man now, he started for the Institute, and at the
  entrance to the subway he met her.</p>

  <p>She wailed, "I was so worried! I couldn't get you on the 'phone. I went
  clear down to the Institute to see what'd happened to you."</p>

  <p>He kissed her, very competently, and raved, "God, woman, I've got it! The
  real big stuff! I've found something, not a chemical you put in I mean, that
  eats bugs&mdash;dissolves 'em&mdash;kills 'em. May be a big new step in
  therapeutics. Oh, no, rats, I don't suppose it really is. Prob'ly just
  another of my bulls."</p>

  <p>She sought to reassure him but he did not wait. He dashed down to the
  subway, promising to telephone to her. By ten, he was peering into his
  incubator.</p>

  <p>There was a cloudy appearance of bacteria in all the flasks except those
  in which he had used broth from the original alarming flask. In these, the
  mysterious murderer of germs had prevented the growth of the new bacteria
  which he had introduced.</p>

  <p>"Great stuff," he said.</p>

  <p>He returned the flasks to the incubator, recorded his observations, went
  again to the library, and searched handbooks, bound proceedings of societies,
  periodicals in three languages. He had acquired a reasonable scientific
  French and German. It is doubtful whether he could have bought a drink or
  asked the way to the Kursaal in either language, but he understood the
  universal Hellenistic scientific jargon, and he pawed through the heavy
  books, rubbing his eyes, which were filled with salty fire.</p>

  <p>He remembered that he was an army officer and had lipovaccine to make this
  morning. He went to work, but he was so twitchy that he ruined the batch,
  called his patient garcon a fool, and after this injustice sent him out for a
  pint of whisky.</p>

  <p>He had to have a confidant. He telephoned to Leora, lunched with her
  expensively, and asserted, "It still looks as if there were something to it."
  He was back in the Institute every hour that afternoon, glancing at his
  flasks, but between he tramped the streets, creaking with weariness, drinking
  too much coffee.</p>

  <p>Every five minutes it came to him, as a quite new and ecstatic idea, "Why
  don't I go to sleep?" then he remembered, and groaned, "No, I've got to keep
  going and watch every step. Can't leave it, or I'll have to begin all over
  again. But I'm so sleepy! Why don't I go to sleep?"</p>

  <p>He dug down, before six, into a new layer of strength, and at six his
  examination showed that the flasks containing the original broth still had no
  growth of bacteria, and the flasks which he had seeded with the original pus
  had, like the first eccentric flask, after beginning to display a good growth
  of bacteria cleared up again under the slowly developing attack of the
  unknown assassin.</p>

  <p>He sat down, drooping with relief. He had it! He stated in the conclusions
  of his first notes:</p>

  <p>"I have observed a principle, which I shall temporarily call the X
  Principle, in pus from a staphylococcus infection, which checks the growth of
  several strains of staphylococcus, and which dissolves the staphylococci from
  the pus in question."</p>

  <p>When he had finished, at seven, his head was on his notebook and he was
  asleep.</p>

  <p>He awoke at ten, went home, ate like a savage, slept again, and was in the
  laboratory before dawn. His next rest was an hour that afternoon, sprawled on
  his laboratory table, with his garcon on guard; the next, a day and a half
  later, was eight hours in bed, from dawn till noon.</p>

  <p>But in dreams he was constantly upsetting a rack of test-tubes or breaking
  a flask. He discovered an X Principle which dissolved chairs, tables, human
  beings. He went about smearing it on Bert Tozers and Dr. Bissexes and
  fiendishly watching them vanish, but accidentally he dropped it on Leora and
  saw her fading, and he woke screaming to find the real Leora's arms about
  him, while he sobbed, "Oh, I couldn't do anything without you! Don't ever
  leave me! I do love you so, even if this damned work does keep me tied up.
  Stay with me!"</p>

  <p>While she sat by him on the frowsy bed, gay in her gingham, he went to
  sleep, to wake up three hours later and start off for the Institute, his eyes
  blood-glaring and set. She was ready for him with strong coffee, waiting on
  him silently, looking at him proudly, while he waved his arms, babbling:</p>

  <p>"Gottlieb better not talk any more about the importance of new
  observations! The X Principle may not just apply to staph. Maybe you can sic
  it on any bug&mdash;cure any germ disease by it. Bug that lives on bugs! Or
  maybe it's a chemical principle, an enzyme. Oh, I don't know. But I
  will!"</p>

  <p>As he bustled to the Institute he swelled with the certainty that after
  years of stumbling he had arrived. He had visions of his name in journals and
  textbooks; of scientific meetings cheering him. He had been an unknown among
  the experts of the Institute, and now he pitied all of them. But when he was
  back at his bench the grandiose aspirations faded and he was the sniffing,
  snuffling beagle, the impersonal worker. Before him, supreme joy of the
  investigator, new mountain-passes of work opened, and in him was new
  power.</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">For a week Martin's life had all the regularity of an
  escaped soldier in the enemy's country, with the same agitation and the same
  desire to prowl at night. He was always sterilizing flasks, preparing media
  of various hydrogen-ion concentrations, copying his old notes into a new book
  lovingly labeled "X Principle, Staph," and adding to it further observations.
  He tried, elaborately, with many flasks and many reseedings, to determine
  whether the X Principle would perpetuate itself indefinitely, whether when it
  was transmitted from tube to new tube of bacteria it would reappear, whether,
  growing by cell-division automatically, it was veritably a germ, a sub-germ
  infecting germs.</p>

  <p>During the week Gottlieb occasionally peered over his shoulder, but Martin
  was unwilling to report until he should have proof, and one good night's
  sleep, and perhaps even a shave.</p>

  <p>When he was sure that the X Principle did reproduce itself indefinitely,
  so that in the tenth tube it grew to have as much effect as in the first,
  then he solemnly called on Gottlieb and laid before him his results, with his
  plans for further investigation.</p>

  <p>The old man tapped his thin fingers on the report, read it intently,
  looked up and, not wasting time in congratulations, vomited questions:</p>

  <p>Have you done dis? Why have you not done dat? At what temperature is the
  activity of the Principle at its maximum? Is its activity manifested on
  agar-solid medium?</p>

  <p>"This is my plan for new work. I think you'll find it includes most of
  your suggestions."</p>

  <p>"Huh!" Gottlieb ran through it and snorted, "Why have you not planned to
  propagate it on dead staph? That is most important of all."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>Gottlieb flew instantly to the heart of the jungle in which Martin had
  struggled for many days: "Because that will show whether you are dealing with
  a living virus."</p>

  <p>Martin was humbled, but Gottlieb beamed:</p>

  <p>"You haf a big thing. Now do not let the Director know about this and get
  enthusiastic too soon. I am glad, Martin!"</p>

  <p>There was that in his voice which sent Martin swanking down the corridor,
  back to work&mdash;and to not sleeping.</p>

  <p>What the X Principle was&mdash;chemical or germ&mdash;he could not
  determine, but certainly the original Principle flourished. It could be
  transmitted indefinitely; he determined the best temperature for it and found
  that it did not propagate on dead staphylococcus. When he added a drop
  containing the Principle to a growth of staphylococcus which was a gray film
  on the solid surface of agar, the drop was beautifully outlined by bare
  patches, as the enemy made its attack, so that the agar slant looked like
  moth-eaten beeswax. But within a fortnight one of the knots of which Gottlieb
  warned him appeared.</p>

  <p>Wary of the hundreds of bacteriologists who would rise to slay him once
  his paper appeared, he sought to make sure that his results could be
  confirmed. At the hospital he obtained pus from many boils, of the arms, the
  legs, the back; he sought to reduplicate his results&mdash;and failed,
  complete. No X Principle appeared in any of the new boils, and sadly he went
  to Gottlieb.</p>

  <p>The old man meditated, asked a question or two, sat hunched in his
  cushioned chair, and demanded:</p>

  <p>"What kind of a carbuncle was the original one?"</p>

  <p>"Gluteal."</p>

  <p>"Ah, den the X Principle may be present in the intestinal contents. Look
  for it, in people with boils and without."</p>

  <p>Martin dashed off. In a week he had obtained the Principle from intestinal
  contents and from other gluteal boils, finding an especial amount in boils
  which were "healing of themselves"; and he transplanted his new Principle, in
  a heaven of triumph, of admiration for Gottlieb. He extended his
  investigation to the intestinal group of organisms and discovered an X
  Principle against the colon bacillus. At the same time he gave some of the
  original Principle to a doctor in the Lower Manhattan Hospital for the
  treatment of boils, and from him had excited reports of cures, more excited
  inquiries as to what this mystery might be.</p>

  <p>With these new victories he went parading in to Gottlieb, and suddenly he
  was being trounced:</p>

  <p>"Oh! So! Beautiful! You let a doctor try it before you finished your
  research? You want fake reports of cures to get into the newspapers, to be
  telegraphed about places, and have everybody in the world that has a pimple
  come tumbling in to be cured, so you will never be able to work? You want to
  be a miracle man, and not a scientist? You do not want to complete things?
  You wander off monkey-skipping and flap-doodling with colon bacillus before
  you have finish with staph&mdash;before you haf really begun your
  work&mdash;before you have found what is the <i>nature</i> of the X
  Principle? Get out of my office! You are a&mdash;a&mdash;a college president!
  Next I know you will be dining with Tubbs, and get your picture in the papers
  for a smart cure-vendor!"</p>

  <p>Martin crept out, and when he met Billy Smith in the corridor and the
  little chemist twittered, "Up to something big? Haven't seen you lately,"
  Martin answered in the tone of Doc Vickerson's assistant in Elk Mills:</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;no&mdash;gee&mdash;I'm just grubbing along, I guess."</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">As sharply and quite as impersonally as he would have
  watched the crawling illness of an infected guinea pig, Martin watched
  himself, in the madness of overwork, drift toward neurasthenia. With
  considerable interest he looked up the symptoms of neurasthenia, saw one
  after another of them twitch at him, and casually took the risk.</p>

  <p>From an irritability which made him a thoroughly impossible person to live
  with, he passed into a sick nervousness in which he missed things for which
  he reached, dropped test-tubes, gasped at sudden footsteps behind him. Dr.
  Yeo's croaking voice became to him a fever, an insult, and he waited with his
  whole body clenched, muttering, "Shut up&mdash;shut up&mdash;oh, shut
  <i>up</i>!" when Yeo stopped to talk to someone outside his door.</p>

  <p>Then he was obsessed by the desire to spell backward all the words which
  snatched at him from signs.</p>

  <p>As he stood dragging out his shoulder on a subway strap, he pored over the
  posters, seeking new words to spell backward. Some of them were remarkably
  agreeable: No Smoking became a jaunty and agreeable "gnikoms on," and
  Broadway was tolerable as "yawdaorb," but he was displeased by his attempts
  on Punch, Health, Rough; while Strength, turning into "htgnerts" was
  abominable.</p>

  <p>When he had to return to his laboratory three times before he was
  satisfied that he had closed the window, he sat down, coldly, informed
  himself that he was on the edge, and took council as to whether he dared go
  on. It was not very good council: he was so glorified by his unfolding work
  that his self could not be taken seriously.</p>

  <p>At last Fear closed in on him.</p>

  <p>It began with childhood's terror of the darkness. He lay awake dreading
  burglars; footsteps in the hall were a creeping cutthroat; an unexplained
  scratching on the fire-escape was a murderer with an automatic in his fist.
  He beheld it so clearly that he had to spring from bed and look timorously
  out, and when in the street below he did actually see a man standing still,
  he was cold with panic.</p>

  <p>Every sky glow was a fire. He was going to be trapped in his bed, be
  smothered, die writhing.</p>

  <p>He knew absolutely that his fears were absurd, and that knowledge did not
  at all keep them from dominating him.</p>

  <p>He was ashamed at first to acknowledge his seeming cowardice to Leora.
  Admit that he was crouching like a child? But when he had lain rigid, almost
  screaming, feeling the cord of an assassin squeezing his throat, till the
  safe dawn, brought back a dependable world, he muttered of "insomnia" and
  after that, night on night, he crept into her arms and she shielded him from
  the horrors, protected him from garroters, kept away the fire.</p>

  <p>He made a checking list of the favorite neurasthenic fears: agoraphobia,
  claustrophobia, pyrophobia, anthropophobia, and the rest, ending with what he
  asserted to be "the most fool, pretentious, witch-doctor term of the whole
  bloomin' lot," namely, siderodromophobia, the fear of a railway journey. The
  first night, he was able to check against pyrophobia, for at the vaudeville
  with Leora, when on the stage a dancer lighted a brazier, he sat waiting for
  the theater to take fire. He looked cautiously along the row of seats (raging
  at himself the while for doing it), he estimated his chance of reaching an
  exit, and became easy only when he had escaped into the street.</p>

  <p>It was when anthropophobia set in, when he was made uneasy by people who
  walked too close to him, that, sagely viewing his list and seeing how many
  phobias were now checked, he permitted himself to rest.</p>

  <p>He fled to the Vermont hills for a four-day tramp&mdash;alone, that he
  might pound on the faster. He went at night, by sleeper, and was able to make
  the most interesting observations of siderodromophobia.</p>

  <p>He lay in a lower berth, the little pillow wadded into a lump. He was
  annoyed by the waving of his clothes as they trailed from the hanger beside
  him, at the opening of the green curtains. The window-shade was up six
  inches; it left a milky blur across which streaked yellow lights, emphatic in
  the noisy darkness of his little cell. He was shivering with anxiety.
  Whenever he tried to relax, he was ironed back into apprehension. When the
  train stopped between stations and from the engine came a questioning,
  fretful whistle, he was aghast with certainty that something had gone
  wrong&mdash;a bridge was out, a train was ahead of them; perhaps another was
  coming just behind them, about to smash into them at sixty miles an
  hour&mdash;</p>

  <p>He imagined being wrecked, and he suffered more than from the actual
  occurrence, for he pictured not one wreck but half a dozen, with assorted
  miseries...The flat wheel just beneath him&mdash;surely it shouldn't pound
  like that&mdash;why hadn't the confounded man with the hammer detected it at
  the last big station?&mdash;the flat wheel cracking; the car lurching,
  falling, being dragged on its side...A collision, a crash, the car instantly
  a crumpled, horrible heap, himself pinned in the telescoped berth, caught
  between seat and seat. Shrieks, death groans, the creeping flames...The car
  turning, falling plumping into a river on its side; himself trying to crawl
  through a window as the water seeped about his body...Himself standing by the
  wrenched car, deciding whether to keep away and protect his sacred work or go
  back, rescue people, and be killed.</p>

  <p>So real were the visions that he could not endure lying here, waiting. He
  reached for the berth light, and could not find the button. In agitation he
  tore a match-box from his coat pocket, scratched a match, snapped on the
  light. He saw himself, under the sheets, reflected in the polished wooden
  ceiling of his berth like a corpse in a coffin. Hastily he crawled out, with
  trousers and coat over his undergarments (he had somehow feared to show so
  much trust in the train as to put on pajamas), and with bare disgusted feet
  he paddled up to the smoking compartment. The porter was squatting on a
  stool, polishing an amazing pile of shoes.</p>

  <p>Martin longed for his encouraging companionship, and ventured, "Warm
  night."</p>

  <p>"Uh-huh," said the porter.</p>

  <p>Martin curled on the chill leather seat of the smoking compartment,
  profoundly studying a brass wash-bowl. He was conscious that the porter was
  disapproving, but he had comfort in calculating that the man must make this
  run thrice a week, tens of thousands of miles yearly, apparently without
  being killed, and there might be a chance of their lasting till morning.</p>

  <p>He smoked till his tongue was raw and till, fortified by the calmness of
  the porter, he laughed at the imaginary catastrophes. He staggered sleepily
  to his berth.</p>

  <p>Instantly he was tense again, and he lay awake till dawn.</p>

  <p>For four days he tramped, swam in cold brooks, slept under trees or in
  straw stacks, and came back (but by day) with enough reserve of energy to
  support him till his experiment should have turned from overwhelming glory
  into sane and entertaining routine.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch29"
     name="ch29">CHAPTER XXIX.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">When the work on the X Principle had gone on for six weeks,
  the Institute staff suspected that something was occurring, and they hinted
  to Martin that he needed their several assistances. He avoided them. He did
  not desire to be caught in any of the log-rolling factions, though for Terry
  Wickett, still in France, and for Terry's rough compulsion to honesty he was
  sometimes lonely.</p>

  <p>How the Director first heard that Martin was finding gold is not
  known.</p>

  <p>Dr. Tubbs was tired of being a Colonel&mdash;there were too many Generals
  in New York&mdash;and for two weeks he had not had an Idea which would
  revolutionize even a small part of the world. One morning he burst in,
  whiskers alive, and reproached Martin:</p>

  <p>"What is this mysterious discovery you're making, Arrowsmith? I've asked
  Dr. Gottlieb, but he evades me; he says you want to be sure, first. I must
  know about it, not only because I take a very friendly interest in your work
  but because I am, after all, your Director!"</p>

  <p>Martin felt that his one ewe lamb was being snatched from him but he could
  see no way to refuse. He brought out his note-books and the agar slants with
  their dissolved patches of bacilli. Tubbs gasped, assaulted his whiskers, did
  a moment of impressive thinking, and clamored:</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say you think you've discovered an infectious disease of
  bacteria, and you haven't told me about it? My dear boy, I don't believe you
  quite realize that you may have hit on the supreme way to kill pathogenic
  bacteria...And you didn't tell me!"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, I wanted to make certain&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I admire your caution, but you must understand, Martin, that the basic
  aim of this Institution is the conquest of disease, not making pretty
  scientific notes! You <i>may</i> have hit on one of the discoveries of a
  generation; the sort of thing that Mr. McGurk and I are looking for...If your
  results are confirmed...I shall ask Dr. Gottlieb's opinion."</p>

  <p>He shook Martin's hand five or six times and bustled out. Next day he
  called Martin to his office, shook his hand some more, told Pearl Robbins
  that they were honored to know him, then led him to a mountain top and showed
  him all the kingdoms of the world:</p>

  <p>"Martin, I have some plans for you. You have been working brilliantly, but
  without a complete vision of broader humanity. Now the Institute is organized
  on the most flexible lines. There are no set departments, but only units
  formed about exceptional men like our good friend Gottlieb. If any new man
  has the real right thing, we'll provide him with every facility, instead of
  letting him merely plug along doing individual work. I have given your
  results the most careful consideration, Martin; I have talked them over with
  Dr. Gottlieb&mdash;though I must say he does not altogether share my
  enthusiasm about immediate practical results. And I have decided to submit to
  the Board of Trustees a plan for a Department of Microbic Pathology, with you
  as head! You will have an assistant&mdash;a real trained Ph.D.&mdash;and more
  room and technicians, and you will report to me directly, talk things over
  with me daily, instead of with Gottlieb. You will be relieved of all war
  work, by my order&mdash;though you can retain your uniform and everything.
  And your salary will be, I should think, if Mr. McGurk and the other Trustees
  confirm me, ten thousand a year instead of five.</p>

  <p>"Yes, the best room for you would be that big one on the upper floor, to
  the right of the elevators. That's vacant now. And your office across the
  hall.</p>

  <p>"And all the assistance you require. Why, my boy, you won't need to sit up
  nights using your hands in this wasteful way, but just think things out and
  take up possible extensions of the work-cover all the possible fields. We'll
  extend this to everything! We'll have scores of physicians in hospitals
  helping us and confirming our results and widening our efforts...We might
  have a weekly council of all these doctors and assistants, with you and me
  jointly presiding...If men like Koch and Pasteur had only had such a system,
  how much more <i>scope</i> their work might have had! Efficient universal
  <i>co-operation</i>&mdash;that's the thing in science today&mdash;the time of
  this silly, jealous, fumbling individual research has gone by.</p>

  <p>"My boy, we may have found the real thing&mdash;another salvarsan! We'll
  publish together! We'll have the whole world talking! Why, I lay awake last
  night thinking of our magnificent opportunity! In a few months we may be
  curing not only staph infections but typhoid, dysentery! Martin, as your
  colleague, I do not for a moment wish to detract from the great credit which
  is yours, but I must say that if you had been more closely allied with Me you
  would have extended your work to practical proofs and results long before
  this."</p>

  <p>Martin wavered back to his room, dazzled by the view of a department of
  his own, assistants, a cheering world&mdash;and ten thousand a year. But his
  work seemed to have been taken from him, his own self had been taken from
  him; he was no longer to be Martin, and Gottlieb's disciple, but a Man of
  Measured Merriment, Dr. Arrowsmith, Head of the Department of Microbic
  Pathology, who would wear severe collars and make addresses and never
  curse.</p>

  <p>Doubts enfeebled him. Perhaps the X Principle would develop only in the
  test-tube; perhaps it had no large value for human healing. He wanted to
  know&mdash;to <i>know</i>.</p>

  <p>Then Rippleton Holabird burst in on him:</p>

  <p>"Martin, my dear boy, the Director has just been telling me about your
  discovery and his splendid plans for you. I want to congratulate you with all
  my heart, and to welcome you as a fellow department-head&mdash;and you so
  young&mdash;only thirty-four, isn't it? What a magnificent future! Think,
  Martin"&mdash;Major Holabird discarded his dignity, sat astride a
  chair&mdash;"think of all you have ahead! If this work really pans out,
  there's no limit to the honors that'll come to you, you lucky young dog!
  Acclaim by scientific societies, any professorship you might happen to want,
  prizes, the biggest men begging to consult you, a ripping place in
  society!</p>

  <p>"Now listen, old boy: Perhaps you know how close I am to Dr. Tubbs, and I
  see no reason why you shouldn't come in with us, and we three run things here
  to suit ourselves. Wasn't it simply too decent of the Director to be so eager
  to recognize and help you in every way! So cordial&mdash;and so helpful. Now
  you really understand him. And the three of us&mdash;Some day we might be
  able to erect a superstructure of co-operative science which would control
  not only McGurk but every institute and every university scientific
  department in the country, and so produce really efficient research. When Dr.
  Tubbs retires, I have&mdash;I'm speaking with the most complete
  confidence&mdash;I have some reason to suppose that the Board of Trustees
  will consider me as his successor. Then, old boy, if this work succeeds, you
  and I can do things together!</p>

  <p>"To be ever so frank, there are very few men in our world (think of poor
  old Yeo!) who combine presentable personalities with first-rate achievement,
  and if you'll just get over some of your abruptness and your unwillingness to
  appreciate big executives and charming women (because, thank God, you do wear
  your clothes well&mdash;when you take the trouble!) why, you and I can become
  the dictators of science throughout the whole country!"</p>

  <p>Martin did not think of an answer till Holabird had gone.</p>

  <p>He perceived the horror of the shrieking bawdy thing called Success, with
  its demand that he give up quiet work and parade forth to be pawed by every
  blind devotee and mud-spattered by every blind enemy.</p>

  <p>He fled to Gottlieb as to the wise and tender father, and begged to be
  saved from Success and Holabirds and A. DeWitt Tubbses and their hordes of
  address-making scientists, degree-hunting authors, pulpit orators, popular
  surgeons, valeted journalists, sentimental merchant princes, literary
  politicians, titled sportsmen, statesmenlike generals, interviewed senators,
  sententious bishops.</p>

  <p>Gottlieb was worried:</p>

  <p>"I knew Tubbs was up to something idealistic and nasty when he came
  purring to me, but I did not t'ink he would try to turn you into a megaphone
  all so soon in one day! I will gird up my loins and go oud to battle with the
  forces of publicity!"</p>

  <p>He was defeated.</p>

  <p>"I have let you alone, Dr. Gottlieb," said Tubbs, "but, hang it, I am the
  Director! And I must say that, perhaps owing to my signal stupidity, I fail
  to see the horrors of enabling Arrowsmith to cure thousands of suffering
  persons and to become a man of weight and esteem!"</p>

  <p>Gottlieb took it to Ross McGurk.</p>

  <p>"Max, I love you like a brother, but Tubbs is the Director, and if he
  feels he needs this Arrowsmith (Is he the thin young fellow I see around your
  lab?) then I have no right to stop him. I've got to back him up the same as I
  would the master of one of our ships," said McGurk.</p>

  <p>Not till the Board of Trustees, which consisted of McGurk himself, the
  president of the University of Wilmington, and three professors of science in
  various universities, should meet and give approval, would Martin be a
  department-head. Meantime Tubbs demanded:</p>

  <p>"Now, Martin, you must hasten and publish your results. Get right to it.
  In fact you should have done it before this. Throw your material together as
  rapidly as possible and send a note in to the Society for Experimental
  Biology and Medicine, to be published in their next proceedings."</p>

  <p>"But I'm not ready to publish! I want to have every loophole plugged up
  before I announce anything whatever!"</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! That attitude is old-fashioned. This is no longer an age of
  parochialism but of competition, in art and science just as much as in
  commerce&mdash;co-operation with your own group, but with those outside it,
  competition to the death! Plug up the holes thoroughly, later, but we can't
  have somebody else stealing a march on us. Remember you have your name to
  make. The way to make it is by working with me&mdash;toward the greatest good
  for the greatest number."</p>

  <p>As Martin began his paper, thinking of resigning but giving it up because
  Tubbs seemed to him at least better than the Pickerbaughs, he had a vision of
  a world of little scientists, each busy in a roofless cell. Perched on a
  cloud, watching them, was the divine Tubbs, a glory of whiskers, ready to
  blast any of the little men who stopped being earnest and wasted time on
  speculation about anything which he had not assigned to them. Back of their
  welter of coops, unseen by the tutelary Tubbs, the lean giant figure of
  Gottlieb stood sardonic on a stormy horizon.</p>

  <p>Literary expression was not easy to Martin. He delayed with his paper,
  while Tubbs became irritable and whipped him on. The experiments had ceased;
  there were misery and pen-scratching and much tearing of manuscript paper in
  Martin's particular roofless cell.</p>

  <p>For once he had no refuge in Leora. She cried:</p>

  <p>"Why not? Ten thousand a year would be awfully nice, Sandy. Gee! We've
  always been so poor, and you do like nice flats and things. And to boss your
  own department&mdash;And you could consult Dr. Gottlieb just the same. He's a
  department-head, isn't he, and yet he keeps independent of Dr. Tubbs. Oh, I'm
  for it!"</p>

  <p>And slowly, under the considerable increase in respect given to him at
  Institute lunches, Martin himself was "for it."</p>

  <p>"We could get one of those new apartments on Park Avenue. Don't suppose
  they cost more than three thousand a year," he meditated. "Wouldn't be so bad
  to be able to entertain people there. Not that I'd let it interfere with my
  work...Kind of nice."</p>

  <p>It was still more kind of nice, however agonizing in the taking, to be
  recognized socially.</p>

  <p>Capitola McGurk, who hitherto had not perceived him except as an object
  less interesting than Gladys the Centrifuge, telephoned: "...Dr. Tubbs so
  enthusiastic and Ross and I are so pleased. Be delighted if Mrs. Arrowsmith
  and you could dine with us next Thursday at eight-thirty."</p>

  <p>Martin accepted the royal command.</p>

  <p>It was his conviction that after glimpses of Angus Duer and Rippleton
  Holabird he had seen luxury, and understood smart dinner parties. Leora and
  he went without too much agitation to the house of Ross McGurk, in the East
  Seventies, near Fifth Avenue. The house did, from the street, seem to have an
  unusual quantity of graystone gargoyles and carven lintels and bronze grills,
  but it did not seem large.</p>

  <p>Inside, the vaulted stone hallway opened up like a cathedral. They were
  embarrassed by the footmen, awed by the automatic elevator, oppressed by a
  hallway full of vellum folios and Italian chests and a drawing-room full of
  water-colors, and reduced to rusticity by Capitola's queenly white satin and
  pearls.</p>

  <p>There were eight or ten Persons of Importance, male and female, looking
  insignificant but bearing names as familiar as Ivory Soap.</p>

  <p>Did one give his arm to some unknown lady and "take her in," Martin
  wondered. He rejoiced to find that one merely straggled into the dining-room
  under McGurk's amiable basso herding.</p>

  <p>The dining-room was gorgeous and very hideous, in stamped leather and
  hysterias of gold, with collections of servants watching one's use of
  asparagus forks. Martin was seated (it is doubtful if he ever knew that he
  was the guest of honor) between Capitola McGurk and a woman of whom he could
  learn only that she was the sister of a countess.</p>

  <p>Capitola leaned toward him in her great white splendor.</p>

  <p>"Now, Dr. Arrowsmith, just what is this you are discovering?"</p>

  <p>"Why, it's&mdash;uh&mdash;I'm trying to figure&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Dr. Tubbs tells us that you have found such wonderful new ways of
  controlling disease." Her L's were a melody of summer rivers, her R's the
  trill of birds in the brake. "Oh, what&mdash;<i>what</i> could be more
  beau-tiful than relieving this sad old world of its burden of illness! But
  just precisely what <i>is</i> it that you're doing?"</p>

  <p>"Why, it's awfully early to be sure but&mdash;You see, it's like this. You
  take certain bugs like staph&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, how interesting science is, but how frightfully difficult for simple
  people like me to grasp! But we're all so humble. We're just waiting for
  scientists like you to make the world secure for friendship&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Then Capitola gave all her attention to her other man. Martin looked
  straight ahead and ate and suffered. The sister of the countess, a sallow and
  stringy woman, was glowing at him. He turned with unhappy meekness (noting
  that she had one more fork than he, and wondering where he had got lost).</p>

  <p>She blared, "You are a scientist, I am told."</p>

  <p>"Ye-es."</p>

  <p>"The trouble with scientists is that they do not understand beauty. They
  are so cold."</p>

  <p>Rippleton Holabird would have made pretty mirth, but Martin could only
  quaver, "No, I don't think that's true," and consider whether he dared drink
  another glass of champagne.</p>

  <p>When they had been herded back to the drawing-room, after masculine but
  achingly elaborate passings of the port, Capitola swooped on him with white
  devouring wings:</p>

  <p>"Dear Dr. Arrowsmith, I really didn't get a chance at dinner to ask you
  just exactly <i>what</i> you are doing... Oh! Have you seen my dear little
  children at the Charles Street settlement? I'm sure ever so many of them will
  become the most fascinating scientists. You must come lecture to them."</p>

  <p>That night he fretted to Leora, "Going to be hard to keep up this
  twittering. But I suppose I've got to learn to enjoy it. Oh, well, think how
  nice it'll be to give some dinners of our own, with real people, Gottlieb and
  everybody, when I'm a department-head."</p>

  <p>Next morning Gottlieb came slowly into Martin's room. He stood by the
  window; he seemed to be avoiding Martin's eyes. He sighed, "Something sort of
  bad&mdash;perhaps not altogether bad&mdash;has happened."</p>

  <p>"What is it, sir? Anything I can do?"</p>

  <p>"It does not apply to me. To you."</p>

  <p>Irritably Martin thought, "Is he going into all this
  danger-of-rapid-success stuff again? I'm getting tired of it!"</p>

  <p>Gottlieb ambled toward him. "It iss a pity, Martin, but you are not the
  discoverer of the X Principle."</p>

  <p>"Wh-what&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Someone else has done it."</p>

  <p>"They have not! I've searched all the literature, and except for Twort,
  not one person has even hinted at anticipating&mdash;Why, good Lord, Dr.
  Gottlieb, it would mean that all I've done, all these weeks, has just been
  waste, and I'm a fool&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Vell. Anyvay. D'Herelle of the Pasteur Institute has just now published
  in the Comptes Rendus, Academie des Sciences, a report&mdash;it is your X
  Principle, absolute. Only he calls it 'bacteriophage.' So."</p>

  <p>"Then I'm&mdash;"</p>

  <p>In his mind Martin finished it, "Then I'm not going to be a
  department-head or famous or anything else. I'm back in the gutter." All
  strength went out of him and all purpose, and the light of creation faded to
  dirty gray.</p>

  <p>"Now of course," said Gottlieb, "you could claim to be co-discoverer and
  spend the rest of your life fighting to get recognized. Or you could forget
  it, and write a nice letter congratulating D'Herelle, and go back to
  work."</p>

  <p>Martin mourned, "Oh, I'll go back to work. Nothing else to do. I guess
  Tubbs'll chuck the new department now. I'll have time to really finish my
  research&mdash;maybe I've got some points that D'Herelle hasn't hit
  on&mdash;and I'll publish it to corroborate him...Damn him!...Where is his
  report?...I suppose you're glad that I'm saved from being a Holabird."</p>

  <p>"I ought to be. It is a sin against my religion that I am not. But I am
  getting old. And you are my friend. I am sorry you are not to have the fun of
  being pretentious and successful&mdash;for a while...Martin, it iss nice that
  you will corroborate D'Herelle. That is science: to work and not to
  care&mdash;too much&mdash;if somebody else gets the credit...Shall I tell
  Tubbs about D'Herelle's priority, or will you?"</p>

  <p>Gottlieb straggled away, looking back a little sadly.</p>

  <p>Tubbs came in to wail, "If you had only published earlier, as I told you,
  Dr. Arrowsmith! You have really put me in a most embarrassing position before
  the Board of Trustees. Of course there can be no question now of a new
  department."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Martin vacantly.</p>

  <p>He carefully filed away the beginnings of his paper and turned to his
  bench. He stared at a shining flask till it fascinated him like a crystal
  ball. He pondered:</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't have been so bad if Tubbs had let me alone. Damn these old men,
  damn these Men of Measured Merriment, these Important Men that come and offer
  you honors. Money. Decorations. Titles. Want to make you windy with
  authority. Honors! If you get 'em, you become pompous, and then when you're
  used to 'em, if you lose 'em you feel foolish.</p>

  <p>"So I'm not going to be rich. Leora, poor kid, she won't have her new
  dresses and flat and everything. We&mdash;Won't be so much fun in the lil old
  flat, now. Oh, quit whining!</p>

  <p>"I wish Terry were here.</p>

  <p>"I love that man Gottlieb. He might have gloated&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Bacteriophage, the Frenchman calls it. Too long. Better just call it
  <i>phage</i>. Even got to take his name for it, for my own X Principle! Well,
  I had a lot of fun, working all those nights. Working&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was coming out of his trance. He imagined the flask filled with
  staph-clouded broth. He plodded into Gottlieb's office to secure the journal
  containing D'Herelle's report, and read it minutely, enthusiastically.</p>

  <p>"There's a man, there's a scientist!" he chuckled.</p>

  <p>On his way home he was planning to experiment on the Shiga dysentery
  bacillus with phage (as henceforth he called the X Principle), planning to
  volley questions and criticisms at D'Herelle, hoping that Tubbs would not
  discharge him for a while, and expanding with relief that he would not have
  to do his absurd premature paper on phage, that he could be lewd and
  soft-collared and easy, not judicious and spied-on and weighty.</p>

  <p>He grinned, "Gosh, I'll bet Tubbs was disappointed! He'd figured on
  signing all my papers with me and getting the credit. Now for this Shiga
  experiment&mdash;Poor Lee, she'll have to get used to my working nights, I
  guess."</p>

  <p>Leora kept to herself what she felt about it&mdash;or at least most of
  what she felt.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch30"
     name="ch30">CHAPTER XXX.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">For a year broken only by Terry Wickett's return after the
  Armistice, and by the mockeries of that rowdy intelligence, Martin was in a
  grind of drudgery. Week on week he toiled at complicated phage experiments.
  His work&mdash;his hands, his technique&mdash;became more adept, and his days
  more steady, less fretful.</p>

  <p>He returned to his evening studying. He went from mathematics into
  physical chemistry; began to understand the mass action law; became as
  sarcastic as Terry about what he called the "bedside manner" of Tubbs and
  Holabird; read much French and German; went canoeing on the Hudson on Sunday
  afternoons; and had a bawdy party with Leora and Terry to celebrate the day
  when the Institute was purified by the sale of Holabird's pride, Gladys the
  Centrifuge.</p>

  <p>He suspected that Dr. Tubbs, now magnificent with the ribbon of the Legion
  of Honor, had retained him in the Institute only because of Gottlieb's
  intervention. But it may be that Tubbs and Holabird hoped he would again
  blunder into publicity-bringing miracles, for they were both polite to him at
  lunch&mdash;polite and wistfully rebuking, and full of meaty remarks about
  publishing one's discoveries early instead of dawdling.</p>

  <p>It was more than a year after Martin's anticipation by D'Herelle when
  Tubbs appeared in the laboratory with suggestions:</p>

  <p>"I've been thinking, Arrowsmith," said Tubbs.</p>

  <p>He looked it.</p>

  <p>"D'Herelle's discovery hasn't aroused the popular interest I thought it
  would. If he'd only been here with us, I'd have seen to it that he got the
  proper attention. Practically no newspaper comment at all. Perhaps we can
  still do something. As I understand it, you've been going along with what Dr.
  Gottlieb would call 'fundamental research.' I think it may now be time for
  you to use phage in practical healing. I want you to experiment with phage in
  pneumonia, plague, perhaps typhoid, and when your experiments get going, make
  some practical tests in collaboration with the hospitals. Enough of all this
  mere frittering and vanity. Let's really <i>cure</i> somebody!"</p>

  <p>Martin was not free from a fear of dismissal if he refused to obey. And he
  was touched as Tubbs went on:</p>

  <p>"Arrowsmith, I suspect you sometimes feel I lack a sense of scientific
  precision when I insist on practical results. I&mdash;Somehow I don't see the
  really noble and transforming results coming out of this Institute that we
  ought to be getting, with our facilities. I'd like to do something big, my
  boy, something fine for poor humanity, before I pass on. Can't you give it to
  me? Go cure the plague!"</p>

  <p>For once Tubbs was a tired smile and not an earnestness of whiskers.</p>

  <p>That day, concealing from Gottlieb his abandonment of the quest for the
  fundamental nature of phage, Martin set about fighting pneumonia, before
  attacking the Black Death. And when Gottiieb learned of it, he was absorbed
  in certain troubles of his own.</p>

  <p>Martin cured rabbits of pleuro-pneumonia by the injection of phage, and by
  feeding them with it he prevented the spread of pneumonia. He found that
  phage-produced immunity could be as infectious as a disease.</p>

  <p>He was pleased with himself, and expected pleasure from Tubbs, but for
  weeks Tubbs did not heed him. He was off on a new enthusiasm, the most
  virulent of his whole life: he was organizing the League of Cultural
  Agencies.</p>

  <p>He was going to standardize and co-ordinate all mental activities in
  America, by the creation of a bureau which should direct and pat and gently
  rebuke and generally encourage chemistry and batik-making, poetry and Arctic
  exploration, animal husbandry and Bible study, Negro spirituals and
  business-letter writing. He was suddenly in conference with conductors of
  symphony orchestras, directors of art-schools, owners of itinerant
  Chautauquas, liberal governors, ex-clergymen who wrote tasty philosophy for
  newspaper syndicates, in fact all the proprietors of American
  intellectuality&mdash;particularly including a millionaire named Minnigen who
  had recently been elevating the artistic standards of the motion
  pictures.</p>

  <p>Tubbs was all over the Institute inviting the researchers to join him in
  the League of Cultural Agencies with its fascinating committee-meetings and
  dinners. Most of them grunted, "The Old Man is erupting again," and forgot
  him, but one ex-major went out every evening to confer with serious ladies
  who wore distinguished frocks, who sobbed over "the loss of spiritual and
  intellectual horse-power through lack of co-ordination," and who went home in
  limousines.</p>

  <p>There were rumors. Dr. Billy Smith whispered that he had gone in to see
  Tubbs and heard McGurk shouting at him, "Your job is to run this shop and not
  work for that land-stealing, four-flushing, play-producing son of evil, Pete
  Minnigen!"</p>

  <p>The morning after, when Martin ambled to his laboratory, he discovered a
  gasping, a muttering, a shaking in the corridors, and incredulously he
  heard:</p>

  <p>"Tubbs has resigned!"</p>

  <p>"No!"</p>

  <p>"They say he's gone to his League of Cultural Agencies. This fellow
  Minnigen has given the League a scad of money, and Tubbs is to get twice the
  salary he had here!"</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">Instantly, for all but the zealots like Gottlieb, Terry,
  Martin, and the bio-physics assistant, research was halted. There was a
  surging of factions, a benevolent and winning buzz of scientists who desired
  to be the new Director of the Institute.</p>

  <p>Rippleton Holabird, Yeo the carpenter-like biologist, Gillingham the joky
  chief in bio-physics, Aaron Sholtheis the neat Russian Jewish High Church
  Episcopalian, all of them went about with expressions of modest willingness.
  They were affectionate with everybody they met in the corridors, however
  violent they were in private discussions. Added to them were no few
  outsiders, professors and researchers in other institutes, who found it
  necessary to come and confer about rather undefined matters with Ross
  McGurk.</p>

  <p>Terry remarked to Martin, "Probably Pearl Robbins and your garcon are
  pitching horseshoes for the Directorship. My garcon ain't&mdash;the only
  reason, though, is because I've just murdered him. At that, I think Pearl
  would be the best choice. She's been Tubbs's secretary so long that she's
  learned all his ignorance about scientific technique."</p>

  <p>Rippleton Holabird was the most unctuous of the office seekers, and the
  most hungry. The war over, he missed his uniform and his authority. He urged
  Martin:</p>

  <p>"You know how I've always believed in your genius, Martin, and I know how
  dear old Gottlieb believes in you. If you would get Gottlieb to back me, to
  talk to McGurk&mdash;Of course in taking the Directorship I would be making a
  sacrifice, because I'd have to give up my research, but I'd be willing
  because I feel, really, that somebody with a Tradition ought to carry on the
  control. Tubbs is backing me, and if Gottlieb did&mdash;I'd see that it was
  to Gottlieb's advantage. I'd give him a lot more floor-space!"</p>

  <p>Through the Institute it was vaguely known that Capitola was advocating
  the election of Holabird as "the only scientist here who is also a
  gentleman." She was seen sailing down corridors, a frigate, with Holabird a
  sloop in her wake.</p>

  <p>But while Holabird beamed, Nicholas Yeo looked secret and satisfied.</p>

  <p>The whole Institute fluttered on the afternoon when the Board of Trustees
  met in the Hall, for the election of a Director. They were turned from
  investigators into boarding-school girls. The Board debated, or did something
  annoying, for draining hours.</p>

  <p>At four, Terry Wickett hastened to Martin with, "Say, Slim, I've got a
  straight tip that They've elected Silva, dean of the Winnemac medical school.
  That's your shop, isn't it? Wha's like?"</p>

  <p>"He's a fine old&mdash;No! He and Gottlieb hate each other. Lord!
  Gottlieb'll resign, and I'll have to get out. Just when my work's going
  nice!"</p>

  <p>At five, past doors made of attentive eyes, the Board of Trustees marched
  to the laboratory of Max Gottlieb.</p>

  <p>Holabird was heard saying bravely, "Of course with me, I wouldn't give my
  research up for any administrative job." And Pearl Robbins informed Terry,
  "Yes, it's true&mdash;Mr. McGurk himself just told me&mdash;the Board has
  elected Dr. Gottlieb the new Director."</p>

  <p>"Then they're fools," said Terry. "He'll refuse it, with wilence. 'Dot dey
  should ask me to go monkey-skipping mit committee meetings!' Fat chance!"</p>

  <p>When the Board had gone, Martin and Terry flooded into Gottlieb's
  laboratory and found the old man standing by his bench, more erect than they
  had seen him for years.</p>

  <p>"Is it true&mdash;they want you to be Director?" panted Martin.</p>

  <p>"Yes, they have asked me."</p>

  <p>"But you'll refuse? You won't let 'em gum up your work!"</p>

  <p>"Vell...I said my real work must go on. They consent I should appoint an
  Assistant Director to do the detail. You see&mdash;Of course nothing must
  interfere with my immunology, but dis gives me the chance to do big t'ings
  and make a free scientific institute for all you boys. And those fools at
  Winnemac that laughed at my idea of a real medical school, now maybe they
  will see&mdash;Do you know who was my rival for Director&mdash;do you know
  who it was, Martin? It was that man Silva! Ha!"</p>

  <p>In the corridor Terry groaned, "Requiescat in pace."</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">To the dinner in Gottlieb's honor (the only dinner that ever
  was given in Gottlieb's honor) there came not only the men of impressive but
  easy affairs who attend all dinners of honor, but the few scientists whom
  Gottlieb admired.</p>

  <p>He appeared late, rather shaky, escorted by Martin. When he reached the
  speakers' table, the guests rose to him, shouting. He peered at them, he
  tried to speak, he held out his long arms as if to take them all in, and sank
  down sobbing.</p>

  <p>There were cables from Europe; ardent letters from Tubbs and Dean Silva
  bewailing their inability to be present; telegrams from college presidents;
  and all of these were read to admiring applause.</p>

  <p>But Capitola murmured, "Just the same, we shall miss dear Dr. Tubbs. He
  was so forward-looking. Don't play with your fork, Ross."</p>

  <p>So Max Gottlieb took charge of the McGurk Institute of Biology, and in a
  month that Institute became a shambles.</p><br>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">Gottlieb planned to give only an hour a day to business. As
  Assistant Director he appointed Dr. Aaron Sholtheis, the epidemiologist, the
  Yonkers churchman and dahlia-fancier. Gottlieb explained to Martin that,
  though of course Sholtheis was a fool, yet he was the only man in sight who
  combined at least a little scientific ability with a willingness to endure
  the routine and pomposity and compromises of executive work.</p>

  <p>By continuing his ancient sneers at all bustling managers, Gottlieb
  obviously felt that he excused himself for having become a manager.</p>

  <p>He could not confine his official work to an hour a day. There were too
  many conferences, too many distinguished callers, too many papers which
  needed his signature. He was dragged into dinner-parties; and the long,
  vague, palavering luncheons to which a Director has to go, and the
  telephoning to straighten out the dates of these tortures, took nervous
  hours. Each day his executive duties crawled into two hours or three or four,
  and he raged, he became muddled by complications of personnel and economy, he
  was ever more autocratic, more testy; and the loving colleagues of the
  Institute, who had been soothed or bullied into surface peace by Tubbs, now
  jangled openly.</p>

  <p>While he was supposed to radiate benevolence from the office recently
  occupied by Dr. A. DeWitt Tubbs, Gottlieb clung to his own laboratory and to
  his narrow office as a cat clings to its cushion under a table. Once or twice
  he tried to sit and look impressive in the office of the Director, but fled
  from that large clean vacuity and from Miss Robbins's snapping typewriter to
  his own den that smelled not of forward-looking virtue but only of cigarettes
  and old papers.</p>

  <p>To McGurk, as to every scientific institution, came hundreds of farmers
  and practical nurses and suburban butchers who had paid large fares from
  Oklahoma or Oregon to get recognition for the unquestionable cures which they
  had discovered: oil of Mississippi catfish which saved every case of
  tuberculosis, arsenic pastes guaranteed to cure all cancers. They came with
  letters and photographs amid the frayed clean linen in their shabby
  suit-cases&mdash;at any opportunity they would stoop over their bags and
  hopefully bring out testimonials from their Pastors; they begged for a chance
  to heal humanity, and for themselves only enough money to send The Girl to
  musical conservatory. So certain, so black-crapely beseeching were they that
  no reception-clerk could be trained to keep them all out.</p>

  <p>Gottlieb found them seeping into his office. He was sorry for them. They
  did take his working hours, they did scratch his belief that he was
  hard-hearted, but they implored him with such wretched timorousness that he
  could not get rid of them without making promises, and admitting afterward
  that to have been more cruel would have been less cruel.</p>

  <p>It was the Important People to whom he was rude.</p>

  <p>The Directorship devoured enough time and peace to prevent Gottlieb from
  going on with the ever more recondite problems of his inquiry into the nature
  of specificity, and his inquiry prevented him from giving enough attention to
  the Institute to keep it from falling to pieces. He depended on Sholtheis,
  passed decisions on to him, but Sholtheis, since in any case Gottlieb would
  get all the credit for a successful Directorship, kept up his own scientific
  work and passed the decisions to Miss Pearl Robbins, so that the actual
  Director was the handsome and jealous Pearl.</p>

  <p>There was no craftier or crookeder Director in the habitable world. Pearl
  enjoyed it. She so warmly and modestly assured Ross McGurk of the merits of
  Gottlieb and of her timorous devotion to him, she so purred to the flattery
  of Rippleton Holabird, she so blandly answered the hoarse hostility of Terry
  Wickett by keeping him from getting materials for his work, that the
  Institute reeled with intrigue.</p>

  <p>Yeo was not speaking to Sholtheis. Terry threatened Holabird to "paste him
  one." Gottlieb constantly asked Martin for advice, and never took it. Joust,
  the vulgar but competent bio-physicist, lacking the affection which kept
  Martin and Terry from reproaching the old man, told Gottlieb that he was a
  "rotten Director and ought to quit," and was straightway discharged and
  replaced by a muffin.</p>

  <p>Max Gottlieb had ever discoursed to Martin of "the jests of the gods."
  Among these jests Martin had never beheld one so pungent as this whereby the
  pretentiousness and fussy unimaginativeness which he had detested in Tubbs
  should have made him a good manager, while the genius of Gottlieb should have
  made him a feeble tyrant; the jest that the one thing worse than a too
  managed and standardized institution should be one that was not managed and
  standardized at all. He would once have denied it with violence, but nightly
  now he prayed for Tubbs's return.</p>

  <p>If the business of the Institute was not more complicated thereby,
  certainly its placidity was the more disturbed by the appearance of Gustaf
  Sondelius, who had just returned from a study of sleeping sickness in Africa
  and who noisily took one of the guest laboratories.</p>

  <p>Gustaf Sondelius, the soldier of preventive medicine whose lecture had
  sent Martin from Wheatsylvania to Nautilus, had remained in his gallery of
  heroes as possessing a little of Gottlieb's perception, something of Dad
  Silva's steady kindliness, something of Terry's tough honesty though none of
  his scorn of amenities, and with these a spicy, dripping richness altogether
  his own. It is true that Sondelius did not remember Martin. Since their
  evening in Minneapolis he had drunk and debated and flamboyantly ridden to
  obscure but vinuous destinations with too many people. But he was made to
  remember, and in a week Sondelius and Terry and Martin were to be seen
  tramping and dining, or full of topics and gin at Martin's flat.</p>

  <p>Sondelius's wild flaxen hair was almost gray, but he had the same bull
  shoulders, the same wide brow, and the same tornado of plans to make the
  world aseptic, without neglecting to enjoy a few of the septic things before
  they should pass away.</p>

  <p>His purpose was, after finishing his sleeping sickness report, to found a
  school of tropical medicine in New York.</p>

  <p>He besieged McGurk and the wealthy Mr. Minnigen who was Tubbs's new
  patron, and in and out of season he besieged Gottlieb.</p>

  <p>He adored Gottlieb and made noises about it. Gottlieb admired his courage
  and his hatred of commercialism, but his presence Gottlieb could not endure.
  He was flustered by Sondelius's hilarity, his compliments, his bounding
  optimism, his inaccuracy, his boasting, his oppressive bigness. It may be
  that Gottlieb resented the fact that though Sondelius was only eleven years
  younger&mdash;fifty-eight to Gottlieb's sixty-nine&mdash;he seemed thirty
  years younger, half a century gayer.</p>

  <p>When Sondelius perceived this grudgingness he tried to overcome it by
  being more noisy and complimentary and enthusiastic than ever. On Gottlieb's
  birthday he gave him a shocking smoking-jacket of cherry and mauve velvet,
  and when he called at Gottlieb's flat, which was often, Gottlieb had to put
  on the ghastly thing and sit humming while Sondelius assaulted him with
  roaring condemnations of mediocre soup and mediocre musicians...That
  Sondelius gave up surprisingly decorative dinner-parties for these calls,
  Gottlieb never knew.</p>

  <p>Martin turned to Sondelius for courage as he turned to Terry for
  concentration. Courage and concentration were needed, in these days of an
  Institute gone insane, if a man was to do his work.</p>

  <p>And Martin was doing it.</p><br>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="first">After a consultation with Gottlieb and a worried conference
  with Leora about the danger of handling the germs, he had gone on to bubonic
  plague, to the possibilities of preventing it and curing it with phage.</p>

  <p>To have heard him asking Sondelius about his experience in plague
  epidemics, one would have believed that Martin found the Black Death
  delightful. To have beheld him infecting lean snaky rats with the horror, all
  the while clucking to them and calling them pet names, one would have known
  him mad.</p>

  <p>He found that rats fed with phage failed to come down with plague; that
  after phage-feeding, Bacillus pestis disappeared from carrier rats which,
  without themselves being killed thereby, harbored and spread chronic plague;
  and that, finally, he could cure the disease. He was as absorbed and happy
  and nervous as in the first days of the X Principle. He worked all night...At
  the microscope, under a lone light, fishing out with a glass pipette drawn
  fine as a hair one single plague bacillus.</p>

  <p>To protect himself from infection by the rat-fleas he wore, while he
  worked with the animals, rubber gloves, high leather boots, straps about his
  sleeves. These precautions thrilled him, and to the others at McGurk they had
  something of the esoteric magic of the alchemists. He became a bit of a hero
  and a good deal of a butt. No more than hearty business men in offices or
  fussy old men in villages are researchers free from the tedious vice of
  jovial commenting. The chemists and biologists called him "The Pest," refused
  to come to his room, and pretended to avoid him in the corridors.</p>

  <p>As he went fluently on from experiment to experiment, as the drama of
  science obsessed him, he thought very well of himself and found himself taken
  seriously by the others. He Published one cautious paper on phage in plague,
  which was mentioned in numerous scientific journals. Even the harassed
  Gottlieb was commendatory, though he could give but little attention and no
  help. But Terry Wickett remained altogether cool. He showed for Martin's
  somewhat brilliant work only enough enthusiasm to indicate that he was not
  jealous; he kept poking in to ask whether, with his new experimentation,
  Martin was continuing his quest for the fundamental nature of all phage, and
  his study of physical chemistry.</p>

  <p>Then Martin had such an assistant as has rarely been known, and that
  assistant was Gustaf Sondelius.</p>

  <p>Sondelius was discouraged regarding his school of tropical medicine. He
  was looking for new trouble. He had been through several epidemics, and he
  viewed plague with affectionate hatred. When he understood Martin's work he
  gloated, "Hey, Yesus! Maybe you got the t'ing that will be better than Yersin
  or Haffkine or anybody! Maybe you cure all the world of plague&mdash;the poor
  devils in India&mdash;millions of them. Let me in!"</p>

  <p>He became Martin's collaborator; unpaid, tireless, not very skillful,
  valuable in his buoyancy. As well as Martin he loved irregularity; by
  principle he never had his meals at the same hours two days in succession,
  and by choice he worked all night and made poetry, rather bad poetry, at
  dawn.</p>

  <p>Martin had always been the lone prowler. Possibly the thing he most liked
  in Leora was her singular ability to be cheerfully non-existent even when she
  was present. At first he was annoyed by Sondelius's disturbing presence,
  however interesting he found his fervors about plague-bearing rats (whom
  Sondelius hated not at all but whom, with loving zeal, he had slaughtered by
  the million, with a romantic absorption in traps and poison gas). But the
  Sondelius who was raucous in conversation could be almost silent at work. He
  knew exactly how to hold the animals while Martin did intrapleural
  injections; he made cultures of Bacillus pestis; when Martin's technician had
  gone home at but a little after midnight (the garcon liked Martin and thought
  well enough of science, but he was prejudiced in favor of six hours' daily
  sleep and sometimes seeing his wife and children in Harlem), then Sondelius
  cheerfully sterilized glassware and needles, and lumbered up to the animal
  house to bring down victims.</p>

  <p>The change whereby Sondelius was turned from Martin's master to his slave
  was so unconscious, and Sondelius, for all his Pickerbaughian love of
  sensationalism, cared so little about mastery or credit, that neither of them
  considered that there had been a change. They borrowed cigarettes from each
  other; they went out at the most improbable hours to have flap-jacks and
  coffee at an all-night lunch; and together they candled test-tubes charged
  with death.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch31"
     name="ch31">CHAPTER XXXI.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">From Yunnan in China, from the clattering bright bazaars,
  crept something invisible in the sun and vigilant by dark, creeping,
  sinister, ceaseless; creeping across the Himalayas, down through walled
  market-places, across a desert, along hot yellow rivers, into an American
  missionary compound&mdash;creeping, silent, sure; and here and there on its
  way a man was black and stilled with plague.</p>

  <p>In Bombay a new dock-guard, unaware of things, spoke boisterously over his
  family rice of a strange new custom of the rats.</p>

  <p>Those princes of the sewer, swift to dart and turn, had gone mad. They
  came out on the warehouse floor, ignoring the guard, springing up as though
  (the guard said merrily) they were trying to fly, and straightway falling
  dead. He had poked at them, but they did not move.</p>

  <p>Three days later that dock-guard died of the plague.</p>

  <p>Before he died, from his dock a ship with a cargo of wheat steamed off to
  Marseilles. There was no sickness on it all the way; there was no reason why
  at Marseilles it should not lie next to a tramp steamer, nor why that
  steamer, pitching down to Montevideo with nothing more sensational than a
  discussion between the supercargo and the second officer in the matter of a
  fifth ace, should not berth near the S.S. Pendown Castle, bound for the
  island of St. Hubert to add cocoa to its present cargo of lumber.</p>

  <p>On the way to St. Hubert, a Goanese seedie boy and after him the messroom
  steward on the Pendown Castle died of what the skipper called influenza. A
  greater trouble was the number of rats which, ill satisfied with lumber as
  diet, scampered up to the food-stores, then into the forecastle, and for no
  reason perceptible died on the open decks. They danced comically before they
  died, and lay in the scuppers stark and ruffled.</p>

  <p>So the Pendown Castle came to Blackwater, the capital and port of St.
  Hubert.</p>

  <p>It is a little isle of the southern West Indies, but St. Hubert supports a
  hundred thousand people&mdash;English planters and clerks, Hindu road-makers,
  Negro cane-hands, Chinese merchants. There is history along its sands and
  peaks. Here the buccaneers careened their ships; here the Marquess of
  Wimsbury, when he had gone mad, took to repairing clocks and bade his slaves
  burn all the sugar-cane.</p>

  <p>Hither that peasant beau, Gaston Lopo, brought Madame de Merlemont, and
  dwelt in fashionableness till the slaves whom he had often relished to lash
  came on him shaving, and straightway the lather was fantastically smeared
  with blood.</p>

  <p>Today, St. Hubert is all sugar-cane and Ford cars, oranges and plantains
  and the red and yellow pods of cocoa, bananas and rubber trees and jungles of
  bamboo, Anglican churches and tin chapels, colored washerwomen busy at the
  hollows in the roots of silk-cotton trees, steamy heat and royal palms and
  the immortelle that fills the valleys with crimson; today it is all splendor
  and tourist dullness and cabled cane-quotations, against the unsparing
  sun.</p>

  <p>Blackwater, flat and breathless town of tin-roofed plaster houses and
  incandescent bone-white roads, of salmon-red hibiscus and balconied stores
  whose dark depths open without barrier from the stifling streets, has the
  harbor to one side and a swamp to the other. But behind it are the Penrith
  Hills, on whose wholesome and palm-softened heights is Government House,
  looking to the winking sails.</p>

  <p>Here lived in bulky torpor His Excellency the Governor of St. Hubert,
  Colonel Sir Robert Fairlamb.</p>

  <p>Sir Robert Fairlamb was an excellent fellow, a teller of mess-room
  stories, one who in a heathen day never smoked till the port had gone seven
  times round; but he was an execrable governor and a worried governor. The man
  whose social rank was next to his own&mdash;the Hon. Cecil Eric George
  Twyford, a lean, active, high-nosed despot who owned and knew rod by
  snakewrithing rod some ten thousand acres of cane in St. Swithin's
  Parish&mdash;Twyford said that His Excellency was a "potty and snoring fool,"
  and versions of the opinion came not too slowly to Fairlamb. Then, to destroy
  him complete, the House of Assembly, which is the St. Hubert legislature, was
  riven by the feud of Kellett the Red Leg and George William Vertigan.</p>

  <p>The Red Legs were a tribe of Scotch-Irish poor whites who had come to St.
  Hubert as indentured servants two hundred years before. Most of them were
  still fishermen and plantation-foremen, but one of them, Kellett, a man
  small-mouthed and angry and industrious, had risen from office-boy to owner
  of a shipping company, and while his father still spread his nets on the
  beach at Point Carib, Kellett was the scourge of the House of Assembly and a
  hound for economy&mdash;particularly any economy which would annoy his fellow
  legislator, George William Vertigan.</p>

  <p>George William, who was sometimes known as "Old Jeo Win" and sometimes as
  "The King of the Ice House" (that enticing and ruinous bar), had been born
  behind a Little Bethel in Lancashire. He owned The Blue Bazaar, the hugest
  stores in St. Hubert; he caused tobacco to be smuggled into Venezuela; he was
  as full of song and incaution and rum as Kellett the Red Leg was full of
  figures and envy and decency.</p>

  <p>Between them, Kellett and George William split the House of Assembly.
  There could be, to a respectable person, no question as to their merits:
  Kellett the just and earnest man of domesticity whose rise was an inspiration
  to youth; George William the gambler, the lusher, the smuggler, the liar, the
  seller of shoddy cottons, a person whose only excellence was his cheap good
  nature.</p>

  <p>Kellett's first triumph in economy was to pass an ordinance removing the
  melancholy Cockney (a player of oboes) who was the official rat-catcher of
  St. Hubert.</p>

  <p>George William Vertigan insisted in debate, and afterward privily to Sir
  Robert Fairlamb, that rats destroy food and perhaps spread disease, and His
  Excellency must veto the bill. Sir Robert was troubled. He called in The
  Surgeon General, Dr. R. E. Inchcape Jones (but he preferred to be called
  Mister, not Doctor).</p>

  <p>Dr. Inchcape Jones was a thin, tall, fretful, youngish man, without
  bowels. He had come out from Home only two years before, and he wanted to go
  back Home, to that particular part of Home represented by tennis-teas in
  Surrey. He remarked to Sir Robert that rats and their ever faithful fleas do
  carry diseases&mdash;plague and infectious jaundice and rat-bite fever and
  possibly leprosy&mdash;but these diseases did not and therefore could not
  exist in St. Hubert, except for leprosy, which was a natural punishment of
  outlandish Native Races. In fact, noted Inchcape Jones, nothing did exist in
  St. Hubert except malaria, dengue, and a general beastly dullness, and if Red
  Legs like Kellett longed to die of plague and rat-bite fever, why should
  decent people object?</p>

  <p>So by the sovereign power of the House of Assembly of St. Hubert, and of
  His Excellency the Governor, the Cockney rat-catcher and his jiggling young
  colored assistant were commanded to cease to exist. The rat-catcher became a
  chauffeur. He drove Canadian and American tourists, who stopped over at St.
  Hubert for a day or two between Barbados and Trinidad, along such hill-trails
  as he considered most easy to achieve with a second-hand motor, and gave them
  misinformation regarding the flowers. The rat-catcher's assistant became a
  respectable smuggler and leader of a Wesleyan choir. And as for the rats
  themselves, they flourished, they were glad in the land, and each female
  produced from ten to two hundred offspring every year.</p>

  <p>They were not often seen by day. "The rats aren't increasing; the cats
  kill 'em," said Kellett the Red Leg. But by darkness they gamboled in the
  warehouses and in and out of the schooners along the quay. They ventured
  countryward, and lent their fleas to a species of ground squirrels which were
  plentiful about the village of Carib.</p>

  <p>A year and a half after the removal of the rat-catcher, when the Pendown
  Castle came in from Montevideo and moored by the Councillor Pier, it was
  observed by ten thousand glinty small eyes among the piles.</p>

  <p>As a matter of routine, certainly not as a thing connected with the deaths
  from what the skipper had called influenza, the crew of the Pendown Castle
  put rat-shields on the mooring hawsers, but they did not take up the
  gang-plank at night, and now and then a rat slithered ashore to find among
  its kin in Blackwater more unctuous fare than hardwood lumber. The Pendown
  sailed amiably for home, and from Avonmouth came to Surgeon General Inchcape
  Jones a cable announcing that the ship was held, that others of the crew had
  died...and died of plague.</p>

  <p>In the curt cablegram the word seemed written in bone-scorching fire.</p>

  <p>Two days before the cable came, a Blackwater lighterman had been smitten
  by an unknown ill, very unpleasant, with delirium and buboes. Inchcape Jones
  said that it could not be plague, because there never was plague in St.
  Hubert. His confrere, Stokes, retorted that perhaps it couldn't be plague,
  but it damn' well <i>was</i> plague.</p>

  <p>Dr. Stokes was a wiry, humorless man, the parish medical officer of St.
  Swithin Parish. He did not remain in the rustic reaches of St. Swithin, where
  he belonged, but snooped all over the island, annoying Inchcape Jones. He was
  an M.B. of Edinburgh; he had served in the African bush; he had had
  black-water fever and cholera and most other reasonable afflictions; and he
  had come to St. Hubert only to recover his red blood corpuscles and to
  disturb the unhappy Inchcape Jones. He was not a nice man; he had beaten
  Inchcape Jones at tennis, with a nasty, unsporting serve&mdash;the sort of
  serve you'd expect from an American.</p>

  <p>And this Stokes, rather a bounder, a frightful bore, fancied himself as an
  amateur bacteriologist! It was a bit thick to have him creeping about the
  docks, catching rats, making cultures from the bellies of their fleas, and
  barging in&mdash;sandy-headed and red-faced, thin and unpleasant&mdash;to
  insist that they bore plague.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, there's always some Bacillus pestis among rats," said
  Inchcape Jones, in a kindly but airy way.</p>

  <p>When the lighterman died, Stokes irritatingly demanded that it be openly
  admitted that the plague had come to St. Hubert.</p>

  <p>"Even if it was plague, which is not certain," said Inchcape Jones,
  "there's no reason to cause a row and frighten everybody. It was a sporadic
  case. There won't be any more."</p>

  <p>There were more, immediately. In a week three other waterfront workers and
  a fisherman at Point Carib were down with something which, even Inchcape
  Jones acknowledged, was uncomfortably like the description of plague in
  "Manson's Tropical Diseases": "a prodromal stage characterized by depression,
  anorexia, aching of the limbs," then the fever, the vertigo, the haggard
  features, the bloodshot and sunken eyes, the buboes in the groin. It was not
  a pretty disease. Inchcape Jones ceased being chattery and ever so jolly
  about picnics, and became almost as grim as Stokes. But publicly he still
  hoped and denied and St. Hubert did not know...did not know.</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">To drinking men and wanderers, the pleasantest place in the
  rather dull and tin-roofed town of Blackwater is the bar and restaurant
  called the Ice House.</p>

  <p>It is on the floor above the Kellett Shipping Agency and the shop where
  the Chinaman who is supposed to be a graduate of Oxford sells carved
  tortoise, and cocoanuts in the horrible likeness of a head shrunken by
  headhunters. Except for the balcony, where one lunches and looks down on
  squatting breech-clouted Hindu beggars, and unearthly pearl-pale English
  children at games in the savannah, all of the Ice House is a large and
  dreaming dimness wherein you are but half conscious of Moorish grills, a
  touch of gilt on white-painted walls, a heavy, amazingly long mahogany bar,
  slot machines, and marble-topped tables beyond your own.</p>

  <p>Here, at the cocktail-hour, are all the bloodless, sun-helmeted white
  rulers of St. Hubert who haven't quite the caste to belong to the Devonshire
  Club: the shipping-office clerks, the merchants who have no grandfathers, the
  secretaries to the Inchcape Joneses, the Italians and Portuguese who smuggle
  into Venezuela.</p>

  <p>Calmed by rum swizzles, those tart and commanding aperitifs which are made
  in their deadly perfection only by the twirling swizzle-sticks of the darkies
  at the Ice House bar, the exiles become peaceful, and have another swizzle,
  and grow certain again (as for twenty-four hours, since the last
  cocktail-hour, they have not been certain) that next year they will go Home.
  Yes, they will taper off, take exercise in the dawn coolness, stop drinking,
  become strong and successful, and go Home...the Lotus Eaters, tears in their
  eyes when in the dimness of the Ice House they think of Piccadilly or the
  heights of Quebec, of Indiana or Catalonia or the clogs of Lancashire...They
  never go Home. But always they have new reassuring cocktail-hours at the Ice
  House, until they die, and the other lost men come to their funerals and
  whisper one to another that they <i>are</i> going Home.</p>

  <p>Now of the Ice House, George William Vertigan, owner of The Blue Bazaar,
  was unchallenged monarch. He was a thick, ruddy man, the sort of Englishman
  one sees in the Midlands, the sort that is either very Non-Conformist or very
  alcoholic, and George William was not Non-Conformist. Each day from five to
  seven he was tilted against the bar, never drunk, never altogether sober,
  always full of melody and kindliness; the one man who did not long for Home,
  because outside the Ice House he remembered no home.</p>

  <p>When it was whispered that a man had died of something which might be
  plague, George William announced to his court that if it were true, it would
  serve Kellett the Red Leg jolly well right. But everyone knew that the West
  Indian climate prevented plague.</p>

  <p>The group, quivering on the edge of being panicky, were reassured.</p>

  <p>It was two nights afterward that there writhed into the Ice House a rumor
  that George William Vertigan was dead.</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">No one dared speak of it, whether in the Devonshire Club or
  the Ice House or the breeze-fluttered, sea-washed park where the Negroes
  gather after working hours, but they heard, almost without hearing, of this
  death&mdash;and this&mdash;and another. No one liked to shake hands with his
  oldest friend; everyone fled from everyone else, though the rats loyally
  stayed with them; and through the island galloped the Panic, which is more
  murderous than its brother, the Plague.</p>

  <p>Still there was no quarantine, no official admission. Inchcape Jones
  vomited feeble proclamations of the inadvisability of too-large public
  gatherings, and wrote to London to inquire about Haffkine's prophylactic, but
  to Sir Robert Fairlamb he protested, "Honestly, there's only been a few
  deaths and I think it's all passed over. As for these suggestions of Stokes
  that we burn the village of Carib, merely because they've had several
  cases&mdash;why, it's barbarous! And it's been conveyed to me that if we were
  to establish a quarantine, the merchants would take the strongest measures
  against the administration. It would ruin the tourist and export
  business."</p>

  <p>But Stokes of St. Swithin's secretly wrote to Dr. Max Gottlieb, Director
  of the McGurk Institute, that the plague was ready to flare up and consume
  all the West Indies, and would Dr. Gottlieb do something about it?</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch32"
     name="ch32">CHAPTER XXXII.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">There may have been in the shadowy heart of Max Gottlieb a
  diabolic insensibility to divine pity, to suffering humankind; there may have
  been mere resentment of the doctors who considered his science of value only
  as it was handy to advertising their business of healing; there may have been
  the obscure and passionate and unscrupulous demand of genius for privacy.
  Certainly he who had lived to study the methods of immunizing mankind against
  disease had little interest in actually using those methods. He was like a
  fabulous painter, so contemptuous of popular taste that after a lifetime of
  creation he should destroy everything he has done, lest it be marred and
  mocked by the dull eyes of the crowd.</p>

  <p>The letter from Dr. Stokes was not his only intimation that plague was
  striding through St. Hubert, that tomorrow it might be leaping to Barbados,
  to the Virgin Islands...to New York. Ross McGurk was an emperor of the new
  era, better served than any cloistered satrap of old. His skippers looked in
  at a hundred ports; his railroads penetrated jungles; his correspondents
  whispered to him of the next election in Colombia, of the Cuban cane-crop, of
  what Sir Robert Fairlamb had said to Dr. R. E. Inchcape Jones on his bungalow
  porch. Ross McGurk, and after him Max Gottlieb, knew better than did the
  Lotus Eaters of the Ice House how much plague there was in St. Hubert.</p>

  <p>Yet Gottlieb did not move, but pondered the unknown chemical structure of
  antibodies, interrupted by questions as to whether Pearl Robbins had enough
  pencils, whether it would be quite all right for Dr. Holabird to receive the
  Lettish scientific mission this afternoon, so that Dr. Sholtheis might attend
  the Anglican Conference on the Reservation of the Host.</p>

  <p>He was assailed by inquirers: public health officials, one Dr. Almus
  Pickerbaugh, a congressman who was said to be popular in Washington, Gustaf
  Sondelius, and a Martin Arrowsmith who could not (whether because he was too
  big or too small) quite attain Gottlieb's concentrated indifference.</p>

  <p>It was rumored that Arrowsmith of McGurk had something which might
  eradicate plague. Letters demanded of Gottlieb, "Can you stand by, with the
  stuff of salvation in your hands, and watch thousands of these unfortunate
  people dying in St. Hubert, and what is more are you going to let the dreaded
  plague gain a foothold in the Western hemisphere? My dear man, this is the
  time to come out of your scientific reverie and act!"</p>

  <p>Then Ross McGurk, over a comfortable steak, hinted, not too diffidently,
  that this was the opportunity for the Institute to acquire world-fame.</p>

  <p>Whether it was the compulsion of McGurk or the demands of the
  public-spirited, or whether Gottlieb's own imagination aroused enough to
  visualize the far-off misery of the blacks in the canefields, he summoned
  Martin and remarked:</p>

  <p>"It comes to me that there is pneumonic plague in Manchuria and bubonic in
  St. Hubert, in the West Indies. If I could trust you, Martin, to use the
  phage with only half your patients and keep the others as controls, under
  normal hygienic conditions but without the phage, then you could make an
  absolute determination of its value as complete as what we have of mosquito
  transmission of yellow fever, and then I would send you down to St. Hubert.
  What do you t'ink?"</p>

  <p>Martin swore by Jacques Loeb that he would observe test conditions; he
  would determine forever the value of phage by the contrast between patients
  treated and untreated and so, perhaps, end all plague forever; he would
  harden his heart and keep clear his eyes.</p>

  <p>"We will get Sondelius to go along," said Gottlieb. "He will do the big
  boom-boom and so bring us the credit in the newspapers which, I am now told,
  a Director must obtain."</p>

  <p>Sondelius did not merely consent&mdash;he insisted.</p>

  <p>Martin had never seen a foreign country&mdash;he could not think of
  Canada, where he had spent a vacation as hotel-waiter, as foreign to him. He
  could not comprehend that he was really going to a place of palm trees and
  brown faces and languid Christmas Eves. He was busy (while Sondelius was out
  ordering linen suits and seeking a proper new sun helmet) making anti-plague
  phage on a large scale: a hundred liters of it, sealed in tiny ampules. He
  felt like the normal Martin, but conferences and powers were considering
  him.</p>

  <p>There was a meeting of the Board of Trustees to advise Martin and
  Sondelius as to their methods. For it the President of the University of
  Wilmington gave up a promising interview with a millionaire alumnus, Ross
  McGurk gave up a game of golf, and one of the three university scientists
  arrived by aeroplane. Called in from the laboratory, a rather young man in a
  wrinkled soft collar, dizzy still with the details of Erlenmeyer flasks,
  infusorial earth, and sterile filters, Martin was confronted by the Men of
  Measured Merriment, and found that he was no longer concealed in the
  invisibility of insignificance but regarded as a leader who was expected not
  only to produce miracles but to explain beforehand how important and mature
  and miraculous he was.</p>

  <p>He was shy before the spectacled gravity of the five Trustees as they sat,
  like a Supreme Court, at the dais table in Bonanza Hall&mdash;Gottlieb a
  little removed, also trying to look grave and supreme. But Sondelius rolled
  in, enthusiastic and tremendous, and suddenly Martin was not shy, nor was he
  respectful to his one-time master in public health.</p>

  <p>Sondelius wanted to exterminate all the rodents in St. Hubert, to enforce
  a quarantine, to use Yersin's serum and Haffkine's prophylactic, and to give
  Martin's phage to everybody in St. Hubert, all at once, all with
  everybody.</p>

  <p>Martin protested. For the moment it might have been Gottlieb speaking.</p>

  <p>He knew, he flung at them, that humanitarian feeling would make it
  impossible to use the poor devils of sufferers as mere objects of experiment,
  but he must have at least a few real test cases, and he was damned, even
  before the Trustees he was damned, if he would have his experiment so mucked
  up by multiple treatment that they could never tell whether the cures were
  due to Yersin or Haffkine or phage or none of them.</p>

  <p>The Trustees adopted his plan. After all, while they desired to save
  humanity, wasn't it better to have it saved by a McGurk representative than
  by Yersin or Haffkine or the outlandish Sondelius?</p>

  <p>It was agreed that if Martin could find in St. Hubert a district which was
  comparatively untouched by the plague, he should there endeavor to have test
  cases, one half injected with phage, one half untreated. In the badly
  afflicted districts, he might give the phage to everyone, and if the disease
  slackened unusually, that would be a secondary proof.</p>

  <p>Whether the St. Hubert government, since they had not asked for aid, would
  give Martin power to experiment and Sondelius police authority, the Trustees
  did not know. The Surgeon General, a chap named Inchcape Jones, had replied
  to their cables: "No real epidemic not need help." But McGurk promised that
  he would pull his numerous wires to have the McGurk Commission (Chairman,
  Martin Arrowsmith, B.A., M.D.) welcomed by the authorities.</p>

  <p>Sondelius still insisted that in this crisis mere experimentation was
  heartless, yet he listened to Martin's close-reasoned fury with enthusiasm
  which this bull-necked eternal child had for anything which sounded new and
  preferably true. He did not, like Almus Pickerbaugh, regard a difference of
  scientific opinion as an attack on his character.</p>

  <p>He talked of going on his own, independent of Martin and McGurk, but he
  was won back when the Trustees murmured that though they really did wish the
  dear man wouldn't fool with sera, they would provide him with apparatus to
  kill all the rats he wanted.</p>

  <p>Then Sondelius was happy:</p>

  <p>"And you watch me! I am the captain-general of rat-killers! I yoost walk
  into a warehouse and the rats say, 'There's that damn' old Uncle
  Gustaf&mdash;what's the use?' and they turn up their toes and die! I am yoost
  as glad I have you people behind me, because I am broke&mdash;I went and
  bought some oil stock that don't look so good now&mdash;and I shall need a
  lot of hydrocyanic acid gas. Oh, those rats! You watch me! Now I go and
  telegraph I can't keep a lecture engagement next week&mdash;huh! me lecture
  to a women's college, me that can talk rat-language and know seven beautiful
  deadly kind of traps!"</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">Martin had never known greater peril than swimming a flood
  as a hospital intern. From waking to midnight he was too busy making phage
  and receiving unsolicited advice from all the Institute staff to think of the
  dangers of a plague epidemic, but when he went to bed, when his brain was
  still revolving with plans, he pictured rather too well the chance of dying,
  unpleasantly.</p>

  <p>When Leora received the idea that he was going off to a death-haunted
  isle, to a place of strange ways and trees and faces (a place, probably,
  where they spoke funny languages and didn't have movies or tooth-paste), she
  took the notion secretively away with her, to look at it and examine it,
  precisely as she often stole little foods from the table and hid them and
  meditatively ate them at odd hours of the night, with the pleased expression
  of a bad child. Martin was glad that she did not add to his qualms by
  worrying. Then, after three days, she spoke:</p>

  <p>"I'm going with you."</p>

  <p>"You are not!"</p>

  <p>"Well...I am!"</p>

  <p>"It's not safe."</p>

  <p>"Silly! Of course it is. You can shoot your nice old phage into me, and
  then I'll be absolutely all right. Oh, I have a husband who cures things, I
  have! I'm going to blow in a lot of money for thin dresses, though I bet St.
  Hubert isn't any hotter than Dakota can be in August."</p>

  <p>"Listen! Lee, darling! Listen! I do think the phage will immunize against
  the plague&mdash;you bet I'll be mighty well injected with it
  myself!&mdash;but I don't <i>know</i>, and even if it were practically
  perfect, there'd always be some people it wouldn't protect. You simply can't
  go, sweet. Now I'm terribly sleepy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Leora seized his lapels, as comic fierce as a boxing kitten, but her eyes
  were not comic, nor her wailing voice; age-old wail of the soldiers'
  women:</p>

  <p>"Sandy, don't you know I haven't any life outside of you? I might've had,
  but honestly, I've been glad to let you absorb me. I'm a lazy, useless,
  ignorant scut, except as maybe I keep you comfortable. If you were off there,
  and I didn't know you were all right, or if you died and somebody else cared
  for your body that I've loved so&mdash;haven't I loved it, dear?&mdash;I'd go
  mad. I mean it&mdash;can't you see I mean it&mdash;I'd go mad! It's
  just&mdash;I'm you, and I got to be with you. And I <i>will</i> help you!
  Make your media and everything. You know how often I've helped you. Oh, I'm
  not much good at McGurk, with all your awful' complicated jiggers, but I did
  help you at Nautilus&mdash;I <i>did</i> help you, didn't I?&mdash;and maybe
  in St. Hubert"&mdash;her voice was the voice of women in midnight
  terror&mdash;"maybe you won't find anybody that can help you even my little
  bit, and I'll cook and everything&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Darling, don't make it harder for me. Going to be hard enough in any
  case&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Damn you, Sandy Arrowsmith, don't you dare use those old stuck-up
  expressions that husbands have been drooling out to wives forever and ever!
  I'm not a wife, any more'n you're a husband. You're a rotten husband! You
  neglect me absolutely. The only time you know what I've got on is when some
  doggone button slips&mdash;and how they can pull off when a person has gone
  over 'em and sewed 'em all on again is simply beyond me!&mdash;and then you
  bawl me out. But I don't care. I'd rather have you than any decent
  husband...Besides. I'm going."</p>

  <p>Gottlieb opposed it, Sondelius roared about it, Martin worried about it,
  but Leora went, and&mdash;his only act of craftiness as Director of the
  Institute&mdash;Gottlieb made her "Secretary and Technical Assistant to the
  McGurk Plague and Bacteriophage Commission to the Lesser Antilles," and
  blandly gave her a salary.</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">The day before the Commission sailed, Martin insisted that
  Sondelius take his first injection of phage. He refused.</p>

  <p>"No, I will not touch it till you get converted to humanity, Martin, and
  give it to everybody in St. Hubert. And you will! Wait till you see them
  suffering by the thousand. You have not seen such a thing. Then you will
  forget science and try to save everybody. You shall not inject me till you
  will inject all my Negro friends down there too."</p>

  <p>That afternoon Gottlieb called Martin in. He spoke with hesitation:</p>

  <p>"You're off for Blackwater tomorrow."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"Hm. You may be gone some time. I&mdash;Martin, you are my oldest friend
  in New York, you and the good Miriam. Tell me: At first you and Terry t'ought
  I should not take up the Directorship. Don't you t'ink I was wise?"</p>

  <p>Martin stared, then hastily he lied and said that which was comforting and
  expected.</p>

  <p>"I am glad you t'ink so. You have known so long what I have tried to do. I
  haf faults, but I t'ink I begin to see a real scientific note coming into the
  Institute at last, after the popoolarity-chasing of Tubbs and Holabird...I
  wonder how I can discharge Holabird, that pants-presser of science? If only
  he dit not know Capitola so well&mdash;socially, they call it! But
  anyway&mdash;</p>

  <p>"There are those that said Max Gottlieb could not do the child job of
  running an institution. Huh! Buying note-books! Hiring women that sweep
  floors! Or no&mdash;the floors are swept by women hired by the superintendent
  of the building, nicht wahr? But anyway&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I did not make a rage when Terry and you doubted. I am a great fellow for
  allowing everyone his opinion. But it pleases me&mdash;I am very fond of you
  two boys&mdash;the only real sons I have&mdash;" Gottlieb laid his withered
  hand on Martin's arm. "It pleases me that you see now I am beginning to make
  a real scientific Institute. Though I have enemies. Martin, you would t'ink I
  was joking, if I told you the plotting against me&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Even Yeo. I t'ought he was my friend. I t'ought he was a real biologist.
  But just today he comes to me and says he cannot get enough sea-urchins for
  his experiments. As if I could make sea-urchins out of thin air! He said I
  keep him short of all materials. Me! That have always stood for&mdash;I do
  not care what they <i>pay</i> scientists, but always I have stood, against
  that fool Silva and all of them, all my enemies&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You do not know how many enemies I have, Martin! They do not dare show
  their faces. They smile to me, but they whisper&mdash;I will show
  Holabird&mdash;always he plot against me and try to win over Pearl Robbins,
  but she is a good girl, she knows what I am doing, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He looked perplexed; he peered at Martin as though he did not quite
  recognize him, and begged:</p>

  <p>"Martin, I grow old&mdash;not in years&mdash;it is a lie I am over
  seventy&mdash;but I have my worries. Do you mind if I give you advice as I
  have done so often, so many years? Though you are not a schoolboy now in
  Queen City&mdash;no, at Winnemac it was. You are a man and you are a genuine
  worker. But&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Be sure you do not let anything, not even your own good kind heart, spoil
  your experiment at St. Hubert. I do not make funniness about humanitarianism
  as I used to; sometimes now I t'ink the vulgar and contentious human race may
  yet have as much grace and good taste as the cats. But if this is to be,
  there must be knowledge. So many men, Martin, are kind and neighborly; so few
  have added to knowledge. You have the chance! You may be the man who ends all
  plague, and maybe old Max Gottlieb will have helped, too, hein, maybe?</p>

  <p>"You must not be just a good doctor at St. Hubert. You must pity, oh, so
  much the generation after generation yet to come that you can refuse to let
  yourself indulge in pity for the men you will see dying.</p>

  <p>"Dying...It will be peace.</p>

  <p>"Let nothing, neither beautiful pity nor fear of your own death, keep you
  from making this plague experiment complete. And as my friend&mdash;If you do
  this, something will yet have come out of my Directorship. If but one fine
  thing could come, to justify me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>When Martin came sorrowing into his laboratory he found Terry Wickett
  waiting.</p>

  <p>"Say, Slim," Terry blurted, "just wanted to butt in and suggest, now for
  St. Gottlieb's sake keep your phage notes complete and up-to-date, and keep
  'em in ink!"</p>

  <p>"Terry, it looks to me as if you thought I had a fine chance of not coming
  back with the notes myself."</p>

  <p>"Aw, what's biting you!" said Terry feebly.</p><br>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">The epidemic in St. Hubert must have increased, for on the
  day before the McGurk Commission sailed, Dr. Inchcape Jones declared that the
  island was quarantined. People might come in, but no one could leave. He did
  this despite the fretting of the Governor, Sir Robert Fairlamb, and the
  protests of the hotel-keepers who fed on tourists, the ex-rat-catchers who
  drove the same, Kellett the Red Leg who sold them tickets, and all the other
  representatives of sound business in St. Hubert.</p><br>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="first">Besides his ampules of phage and his Luer syringes for
  injection, Martin made personal preparations for the tropics. He bought, in
  seventeen minutes, a Palm Beach suit, two new shirts, and, as St. Hubert was
  a British possession and as he had heard that all Britishers carry canes, a
  stick which the shop-keeper guaranteed to be as good as genuine
  malacca.</p><br>

  <h3>VI.</h3>

  <p class="first">They started, Martin and Leora and Gustaf Sondelius, on a
  winter morning, on the six-thousand-ton steamer St. Buryan of the McGurk
  Line, which carried machinery and flour and codfish and motors to the Lesser
  Antilles and brought back molasses, cocoa, avocados, Trinidad asphalt. A
  score of winter tourists made the round trip, but only a score, and there was
  little handkerchief-waving.</p>

  <p>The McGurk Line pier was in South Brooklyn, in a district of brown
  anonymous houses. The sky was colorless above dirty snow. Sondelius seemed
  well content. As they drove upon a wharf littered with hides and boxes and
  disconsolate steerage passengers, he peered out of their crammed taxicab and
  announced that the bow of the St. Buryan&mdash;all they could see of
  it&mdash;reminded him of the Spanish steamer he had taken to the Cape Verde
  Isles. But to Martin and Leora, who had read of the drama of departure, of
  stewards darting with masses of flowers, dukes and divorcees being
  interviewed, and bands playing "The Star-spangled Banner," the St. Buryan was
  unromantic and its ferry-like casualness was discouraging.</p>

  <p>Only Terry came to see them off, bringing a box of candy for Leora.</p>

  <p>Martin had never ridden a craft larger than a motor launch. He stared up
  at the black wall of the steamer's side. As they mounted the gangplank he was
  conscious that he was cutting himself off from the safe, familiar land, and
  he was embarrassed by the indifference of more experienced-looking
  passengers, staring down from the rail. Aboard, it seemed to him that the
  forward deck looked like the backyard of an old-iron dealer, that the St.
  Buryan leaned too much to one side, and that even in the dock she swayed
  undesirably.</p>

  <p>The whistle snorted contemptuously; the hawsers were cast off. Terry stood
  on the pier till the steamer, with Martin and Leora and Sondelius above,
  their stomachs pressed against the rail, had slid past him, then he abruptly
  clumped away.</p>

  <p>Martin realized that he was off for the perilous sea and the perilous
  plague; that there was no possibility of leaving the ship till they should
  reach some distant island. This narrow deck, with its tarry lines between
  planks, was his only home. Also, in the breeze across the wide harbor he was
  beastly cold, and in general God help him!</p>

  <p>As the St. Buryan was warped out into the river, as Martin was suggesting
  to his Commission, "How about going downstairs and seeing if we can raise a
  drink?" there was the sound of a panicky taxicab on the pier, the sight of a
  lean, tall figure running&mdash;but so feebly, so shakily&mdash;and they
  realized that it was Max Gottlieb, peering for them, tentatively raising his
  thin arm in greeting, not finding them at the rail, and turning sadly
  away.</p><br>

  <h3>VII.</h3>

  <p class="first">As representatives of Ross McGurk and his various works,
  evil and benevolent, they had the two suites de luxe on the boat deck.</p>

  <p>Martin was cold off snow-blown Sandy Hook, sick off Cape Hatteras, and
  tired and relaxed between; with him Leora was cold, and in a ladylike manner
  she was sick, but she was not at all tired. She insisted on conveying
  information to him, from the West Indian guide-book which she had earnestly
  bought.</p>

  <p>Sondelius was conspicuously all over the ship. He had tea with the
  Captain, scouse with the fo'c'sle, and intellectual conferences with the
  Negro missionary in the steerage. He was to be heard&mdash;always he was to
  be heard: singing on the promenade deck, defending Bolshevism against the
  boatswain, arguing oil-burning with the First Officer, and explaining to the
  bar steward how to make a gin sling. He held a party for the children in the
  steerage, and he borrowed from the First Officer a volume of navigation to
  study between parties.</p>

  <p>He gave flavor to the ordinary cautious voyage of the St. Buryan, but he
  made a mistake. He was courteous to Miss Gwilliam; he tried to cheer her on a
  seemingly lonely adventure.</p>

  <p>Miss Gwilliam came from one of the best families in her section of New
  Jersey; her father was a lawyer and a church-warden, her grandfather had been
  a solid farmer. That she had not married, at thirty-three, was due entirely
  to the preference of modern young men for jazz-dancing hussies; and she was
  not only a young lady of delicate reservations but also a singer; in fact,
  she was going to the West Indies to preserve the wonders of primitive art for
  reverent posterity in the native ballads she would collect and sing to a
  delighted public&mdash;if only she learned how to sing.</p>

  <p>She studied Gustaf Sondelius. He was a silly person, not in the least like
  the gentlemanly insurance-agents and office-managers she was accustomed to
  meet at the country club, and what was worse, he did not ask her opinions on
  art and good form. His stories about generals and that sort of people could
  be discounted as lies, for did he not associate with grimy engineers? He
  needed some of her gentle but merry chiding.</p>

  <p>When they stood together at the rail and he chanted in his ludicrous
  up-and-down Swedish sing-song that it was a fine evening, she remarked,
  "Well, Mr. Roughneck, have you been up to something smart again today? Or
  have you been giving somebody else a chance to talk, for once?"</p>

  <p>She was placidly astonished when he clumped away with none of the obedient
  reverence which any example of cultured American womanhood has a right to
  expect from all males, even foreigners.</p>

  <p>Sondelius came to Martin lamenting, "Slim&mdash;if I may call you so, like
  Terry&mdash;I think you and your Gottlieb are right. There is no use saving
  fools. It's a great mistake to be natural. One should always be a stuffed
  shirt, like old Tubbs. Then one would have respect even from artistic New
  Jersey spinsters...How strange is conceit! That I who have been cursed and
  beaten by so many Great Ones, who was once led out to be shot in a Turkish
  prison, should never have been annoyed by them as by this smug wench. Ah,
  smugness! That is the enemy!"</p>

  <p>Apparently he recovered from Miss Gwilliam. He was seen arguing with the
  ship's doctor about sutures in Negro skulls, and he invented a game of deck
  cricket. But one evening when he sat reading in the "social hall," stooped
  over, wearing betraying spectacles and his mouth puckered, Martin walked past
  the window and incredulously saw that Sondelius was growing old.</p><br>

  <h3>VIII.</h3>

  <p class="first">As he sat by Leora in a deck-chair, Martin studied her,
  really looked at her pale profile, after years when she had been a matter of
  course. He pondered on her as he pondered on phage; he weightily decided that
  he had neglected her, and weightily he started right in to be a good
  husband.</p>

  <p>"Now I have a chance to be human, Lee, I realize how lonely you must have
  been in New York."</p>

  <p>"But I haven't."</p>

  <p>"Don't be foolish! Of course you've been lonely! Well, when we get back,
  I'll take a little time off every day and we'll&mdash;we'll have walks and go
  to the movies and everything. And I'll send you flowers, every morning. Isn't
  it a relief to just sit here! But I do begin to think and realize how I've
  prob'ly neglected&mdash;Tell me, honey, has it been too terribly dull?"</p>

  <p>"Hunka. Really."</p>

  <p>"No, but <i>tell</i> me."</p>

  <p>"There's nothing to tell."</p>

  <p>"Now bang it, Leora, here when I <i>do</i> have the first chance in eleven
  thousand years to think about you, and I come right out frankly and admit how
  slack I've been&mdash;And planning to send you flowers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You look here, Sandy Arrowsmith! Quit bullying me! You want the luxury of
  harrowing yourself by thinking what a poor, bawling, wretched, story-book
  wife I am. You're working up to become perfectly miserable if you can't enjoy
  being miserable...It would be terrible, when we got back to New York, if you
  did get on the job and devoted yourself to showing me a good time. You'd go
  at it like a bull. I'd have to be so dratted grateful for the flowers every
  day&mdash;the days you didn't forget!&mdash;and the way you'd sling me off to
  the movies when I wanted to stay home and snooze&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, by thunder, of all the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, please! You're dear and good, but you're so bossy that I've always
  got to be whatever <i>you</i> want, even if it's lonely. But&mdash;Maybe I'm
  lazy. I'd rather just snoop around than have to work at being well-dressed
  and popular and all those jobs. I fuss over the flat&mdash;hang it, wish I'd
  had the kitchen repainted while we're away, it's a <i>nice</i> little
  kitchen&mdash;and I make believe read my French books, and go out for a walk,
  and look in the windows, and eat an ice cream soda, and the day slides by.
  Sandy, I do love you awful' much; if I could, I'd be as ill-treated as the
  dickens, so you could enjoy it, but I'm no good at educated lies, only at
  easy little ones like the one I told you last week&mdash;I said I hadn't
  eaten any candy and didn't have a stomach-ache, and I'd eaten half a pound
  and I was as sick as a pup...Gosh, I'm a good wife I am!"</p>

  <p>They rolled from gray seas to purple and silver. By dusk they stood at the
  rail, and he felt the spaciousness of the sea, of life. Always he had lived
  in his imagination. As he had blundered through crowds, an inconspicuous
  young husband trotting out to buy cold roast beef for dinner, his brain-pan
  had been wide as the domed sky. He had seen not the streets, but
  microorganisms large as jungle monsters, miles of flasks cloudy with
  bacteria, himself giving orders to his garcon, Max Gottlieb awesomely
  congratulating him. Always his dreams had clung about his work. Now, no less
  passionately, he awoke to the ship, the mysterious sea, the presence of
  Leora, and he cried to her, in the warm tropic winter dusk:</p>

  <p>"Sweet, this is only the first of our big hikes! Pretty soon, if I'm
  successful in St. Hubert, I'll begin to count in science, and we'll go
  abroad, to your France and England and Italy and everywhere!"</p>

  <p>"Can we, do you think? Oh, Sandy! Going <i>places!</i>"</p><br>

  <h3>IX.</h3>

  <p class="first">He never knew it but for an hour, in their cabin
  half-lighted from the lamps in their sitting-room beyond, she watched him
  sleeping.</p>

  <p>He was not handsome; he was grotesque as a puppy napping on a hot
  afternoon. His hair was ruffled, his face was deep in the crumpled pillow he
  had encircled with both his arms. She looked at him, smiling, with the
  stretched corners of her lips like tiny flung arrows.</p>

  <p>"I do love him so when he's frowsy! Don't you see, Sandy, I was wise to
  come! You're so worn out. <i>it</i> might get you, and nobody but me could
  nurse you. Nobody knows all your cranky ways&mdash;about how you hate prunes
  and everything. Night and day I'll nurse you&mdash;the least whisper and I'll
  be awake. And if you need ice bags and stuff&mdash;And I'll <i>have</i> ice,
  too, if I have to sneak into some millionaire's house and steal it out of his
  highballs! My dear!"</p>

  <p>She shifted the electric fan so that it played more upon him, and on soft
  toes she crept into their stiff sitting-room. It did not contain much save a
  round table, a few chairs, and a Sybaritic glass and mahogany wall-cabinet
  whose purpose was never discovered.</p>

  <p>"It's so sort of&mdash;Aah! Pinched. I guess maybe I ought to fix it up
  somehow."</p>

  <p>But she had no talent for the composing of chairs and pictures which
  brings humanness into a dead room. Never in her life had she spent three
  minutes in arranging flowers. She looked doubtful, she smiled and turned out
  the light, and slipped in to him.</p>

  <p>She lay on the coverlet of her berth, in the tropic languidness, a slight
  figure in a frivolous nightgown. She thought, "I like a small bedroom,
  because Sandy is nearer and I don't get so scared by things. What a dratted
  bully the man is! Some day I'm going to up and say to him: 'You go to the
  devil!' I will so! Darling, we will hike off to France together, just you and
  I, won't we!"</p>

  <p>She was asleep, smiling, so thin a little figure&mdash;</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch33"
     name="ch33">CHAPTER XXXIII.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">Misty mountains they saw, and on their flanks the
  palm-crowned fortifications built of old time against the pirates. In
  Martinique were white-faced houses like provincial France, and a boiling
  market full of colored women with kerchiefs ultramarine and scarlet. They
  passed hot St. Lucia, and Saba that is all one lone volcano. They devoured
  paw-paws and breadfruit and avocados, bought from coffee-colored natives who
  came alongside in nervous small boats; they felt the languor of the isles,
  and panted before they approached Barbados.</p>

  <p>Just beyond was St. Hubert.</p>

  <p>None of the tourists had known of the quarantine. They were raging that
  the company should have taken them into danger. In the tepid wind they felt
  the plague.</p>

  <p>The skipper reassured them, in a formal address. Yes, they would stop at
  Blackwater, the port of St. Hubert, but they would anchor far out in the
  harbor; and while the passengers bound for St. Hubert would be permitted to
  go ashore, in the port-doctor's launch, no one in St. Hubert would be allowed
  to leave&mdash;nothing from that pest-hole would touch the steamer except the
  official mail, which the ship's surgeon would disinfect.</p>

  <p>(The ship's surgeon was wondering, the while, how you disinfected
  mail&mdash;let's see&mdash;sulfur burning in the presence of moisture, wasn't
  it?)</p>

  <p>The skipper had been trained in oratory by arguments with wharf-masters,
  and the tourists were reassured. But Martin murmured to his Commission, "I
  hadn't thought of that. Once we go ashore, we'll be practically prisoners
  till the epidemic's over&mdash;if it ever does get over&mdash;prisoners with
  the plague around us."</p>

  <p>"Why, of course!" said Sondelius.</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">They left Bridgetown, the pleasant port of Barbados, by
  afternoon. It was late night, with most of the passengers asleep, when they
  arrived at Blackwater. As Martin came out on the damp and vacant deck, it
  seemed unreal, harshly unfriendly, and of the coming battleground he saw
  nothing but a few shore lights beyond uneasy water.</p>

  <p>About their arrival there was something timorous and illicit. The ship's
  surgeon ran up and down, looking disturbed; the captain could be heard
  growling on the bridge; the first officer hastened up to confer with him and
  disappeared below again; and there was no one to meet them. The steamer
  waited, rolling in a swell, while from the shore seemed to belch a hot
  miasma.</p>

  <p>"And here's where we're going to land and <i>stay!</i>" Martin grunted to
  Leora, as they stood by their bags, their cases of phage, on the heaving,
  black-shining deck near the top of the accommodation-ladder.</p>

  <p>Passengers came out in dressing-gowns, chattering, "Yes, this must be the
  place, those lights there. Must be fierce. <i>What?</i> Somebody going
  ashore? Oh, sure those two doctors. Well, they got nerve. I certainly don't
  envy them!"</p>

  <p>Martin heard.</p>

  <p>From shore a pitching light made toward the ship, slid round the bow, and
  sidled to the bottom of the accommodation-ladder. In the haze of a lantern
  held by a steward at the foot of the steps, Martin could see a smart covered
  launch, manned by darky sailors in naval uniform and glazed black straw hats
  with ribbons, and commanded by a Scotch-looking man with some sort of a
  peaked uniform cap over a civilian jacket.</p>

  <p>The captain clumped down the swinging steps beside the ship. While the
  launch bobbed, its wet canvas top glistening, he had a long and complaining
  conference with the commander of the launch, and received a pouch of mail,
  the only thing to come aboard.</p>

  <p>The ship's surgeon took it from the captain with aversion, grumbling, "Now
  where can I get a barrel to disinfect these darn' letters in?"</p>

  <p>Martin and Leora and Sondelius waited, without option.</p>

  <p>They had been joined by a thin woman in black whom they had not seen all
  the trip&mdash;one of the mysterious passengers who are never noticed till
  they come on deck at landing. Apparently she was going ashore. She was pale,
  her hands twitching.</p>

  <p>The captain shouted at them, "All right&mdash;all right&mdash;all right!
  You can go now. Hustle, please. I've got to get on...Damn' nuisance."</p>

  <p>The St. Buryan had not seemed large or luxurious, but it was a castle,
  steadfast among storms, its side a massy wall, as Martin crept down the
  swaying stairs, thinking all at once, "We're in for it; like going to the
  scaffold&mdash;they lead you along&mdash;no chance to resist," and, "You're
  letting your imagination run away with you; quit it now!" and, "Is it too
  late to make Lee stay behind, on the steamer?" and an agonized, "Oh, Lord,
  are the stewards handling that phage carefully?" Then he was on the tiny
  square platform at the bottom of the accommodation-ladder, the ship's side
  was high above him, lit by the round ports of cabins, and someone was helping
  him into the launch.</p>

  <p>As the unknown woman in black came aboard, Martin saw in lantern light how
  her lips tightened once, then her whole face went blank, like one who waited
  hopelessly.</p>

  <p>Leora squeezed his hand, hard, as he helped her in.</p>

  <p>He muttered, while the steamer whistled, "Quick! You can still go back!
  You must!"</p>

  <p>"And leave the pretty launch? Why, Sandy! Just look at the elegant engine
  it's got!...Gosh, I'm scared blue!"</p>

  <p>As the launch sputtered, swung round, and headed for the filtering of
  lights ashore, as it bowed its head and danced to the swell, the sandy-headed
  official demanded of Martin:</p>

  <p>"You're the McGurk Commission?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Good." He sounded pleased yet cold, a busy voice and humorless.</p>

  <p>"Are you the port-doctor?" asked Sondelius.</p>

  <p>"No, not exactly. I'm Dr. Stokes, of St. Swithin's Parish. We're all of us
  almost everything, nowadays. The port-doctor&mdash;In fact he died couple of
  days ago."</p>

  <p>Martin grunted. But his imagination had ceased to agitate him.</p>

  <p>"You're Dr. Sondelius, I imagine. I know your work in Africa, in German
  East&mdash;was out there myself. And you're Dr. Arrowsmith? I read your
  plague phage paper. Much impressed. Now I have just the chance to say before
  we go ashore&mdash;You'll both be opposed. Inchcape Jones, the S.G., has lost
  his head. Running in circles, lancing buboes&mdash;afraid to burn Carib,
  where most of the infection is. Arrowsmith, I have a notion of what you may
  want to do experimentally. If Inchcape balks, you come to me in my
  parish&mdash;if I'm still alive. Stokes, my name is...Damn it, boy, what
  <i>are</i> you doing? Trying to drift clear down to Venezuela?...Inchcape and
  H.E. are so afraid that they won't even cremate the bodies&mdash;some
  religious prejudice among the blacks&mdash;obee or something."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Martin.</p>

  <p>"How many cases plague you got now?" said Sondelius.</p>

  <p>"Lord knows. Maybe a thousand. And ten million rats...I'm so
  sleepy!...Well, welcome, gentlemen&mdash;" He flung out his arms in a dry
  hysteria. "Welcome to the Island of Hesperides!"</p>

  <p>Out of darkness Blackwater swung toward them, low flimsy barracks on a low
  swampy plain stinking of slimy mud. Most of the town was dark, dark and
  wickedly still. There was no face along the dim waterfront&mdash;warehouses,
  tram station, mean hotels&mdash;and they ground against a pier, they went
  ashore, without attention from customs officials. There were no carriages,
  and the hotel-runners who once had pestered tourists landing from the St.
  Buryan, whatever the hour, were dead now or hidden.</p>

  <p>The thin mysterious woman passenger vanished, staggering with her
  suit-case&mdash;she had said no word, and they never saw her again. The
  Commission, with Stokes and the harbor-police who had manned the launch,
  carried the baggage (Martin weaving with a case of the phage) through the
  rutty balconied streets to the San Marino Hotel.</p>

  <p>Once or twice faces, disembodied things with frightened lips, stared at
  them from alley-mouths; and when they came to the hotel, when they stood
  before it, a weary caravan laden with bags and boxes, the bulging-eyed
  manageress peered from a window before she would admit them.</p>

  <p>As they entered, Martin saw under a street light the first stirring of
  life: a crying woman and a bewildered child following an open wagon in which
  were heaped a dozen stiff bodies.</p>

  <p>"And I might have saved all of them, with phage," he whispered to
  himself.</p>

  <p>His forehead was cold, yet it was greasy with sweat as he babbled to the
  manageress of rooms and meals, as he prayed that Leora might not have seen
  the Things in that slow creaking wagon.</p>

  <p>"I'd have choked her before I let her come, if I'd known," he was
  shuddering.</p>

  <p>The woman apologized, "I must ask you gentlemen to carry your things up to
  your rooms. Our boys&mdash;They aren't here any more."</p>

  <p>What became of the walking stick which, in such pleased vanity, Martin had
  bought in New York, he never knew. He was too busy guarding the cases of
  phage, and worrying, "Maybe this stuff would save everybody."</p>

  <p>Now Stokes of St. Swithin's was a reticent man and hard, but when they had
  the last bag upstairs, he leaned his head against a door, cried, "My God,
  Arrowsmith, I'm so glad you've got here," and broke from them, running...One
  of the Negro harbor-police, expressionless, speaking the English of the
  Antilles with something of the accent of Piccadilly, said, "Sar, have you any
  other command for I? If you permit, we boys will now go home. Sar, on the
  table is the whisky Dr. Stokes have told I to bring."</p>

  <p>Martin stared. It was Sondelius who said. "Thank you very much, boys.
  Here's a quid between you. Now get some sleep."</p>

  <p>They saluted and were not.</p>

  <p>Sondelius made the novices as merry as he could for half an hour.</p>

  <p>Martin and Leora woke to a broiling, flaring, green and crimson morning,
  yet ghastly still; awoke and realized that about them was a strange land, as
  yet unseen, and before them the work that in distant New York had seemed
  dramatic and joyful and that stank now of the charnel house.</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">A sort of breakfast was brought to them by a Negress who,
  before she would enter, peeped fearfully at them from the door.</p>

  <p>Sondelius rumbled in from his room, in an impassioned silk dressing-gown.
  If ever, spectacled and stooped, he had looked old, now he was young and
  boisterous.</p>

  <p>"Hey, ya, Slim, I think we get some work here! Let me at those rats! This
  Inchcape&mdash;to try to master them with strychnin! A noble melon! Leora,
  when you divorce Martin, you marry me, heh? Give me the salt. Yey, I sleep
  fine!"</p>

  <p>The night before, Martin had scarce looked at their room. Now he was
  diverted by what he considered its foreignness: the lofty walls of wood
  painted a watery blue, the wide furnitureless spaces, the bougainvillaea at
  the window, and in the courtyard the merciless heat and rattling metallic
  leaves of palmettoes.</p>

  <p>Beyond the courtyard walls were the upper stories of a balconied Chinese
  shop and the violent-colored skylight of The Blue Bazaar.</p>

  <p>He felt that there should be a clamor from this exotic world, but there
  was only a rebuking stillness, and even Sondelius became dumb, though he had
  his moment. He waddled back to his room, dressed himself in surah silk last
  worn on the East Coast of Africa, and returned bringing a sun-helmet which
  secretly he had bought for Martin.</p>

  <p>In linen jacket and mushroom helmet, Martin belonged more to the tropics
  than to his own harsh Northern meadows.</p>

  <p>But his pleasure in looking foreign was interrupted by the entrance of the
  Surgeon General, Dr. R. E. Inchcape Jones, lean but apple-cheeked, worried
  and hasty.</p>

  <p>"Of course you chaps are welcome, but really, with all we have to do I'm
  afraid we can't give you the attention you doubtless expect," he said
  indignantly.</p>

  <p>Martin sought for adequate answer. It was Sondelius who spoke of a
  non-existent cousin who was a Harley Street specialist, and who explained
  that all they wanted was a laboratory for Martin and, for himself, a chance
  to slaughter rats. How many times, in how many lands, had Gustaf Sondelius
  flattered pro-consuls and persuaded the heathen to let themselves be
  saved!</p>

  <p>Under his hands the Surgeon General became practically human; he looked as
  though he really thought Leora was pretty; he promised that he might perhaps
  let Sondelius tamper with his rats. He would return that afternoon and
  conduct them to the house prepared for them, Penrith Lodge, on the safe
  secluded hills behind Blackwater. And (he bowed gallantly) he thought that
  Mrs. Arrowsmith would find the Lodge a topping bungalow, with three rather
  decent servants. The butler, though a colored chap, was an old
  mess-sergeant.</p>

  <p>Inchcape Jones had scarce gone when at the door there was a pounding and
  it opened on Martin's classmate at Winnemac, Dr. the Rev. Ira Hinkley.</p>

  <p>Martin had forgotten Ira, that bulky Christian who had tried to save him
  during otherwise dulcet hours of dissection. He recalled him confusedly. The
  man came in, vast and lumbering. His eyes were staring and altogether mad,
  and his voice was parched:</p>

  <p>"Hello, Mart. Yump, it's old Ira. I'm in charge of all the chapels of the
  Sanctification Brotherhood here. Oh, Mart, if you only knew the wickedness of
  the natives, and the way they lie and sing indecent songs and commit all
  manner of vileness! And the Church of England lets them wallow in their sins!
  Only us to save them. I heard you were coming. I have been laboring, Mart.
  I've nursed the poor plague-stricken devils, and I've told them how hellfire
  is roaring about them. Oh, Mart, if you knew how my heart bleeds to see these
  ignorant fellows going unrepentant to eternal torture! After all these years
  I know you can't still be a scoffer. I come to you with open hands, begging
  you not merely to comfort the sufferers but to snatch their souls from the
  burning lakes of sulfur to which, in His everlasting mercy, the Lord of Hosts
  hath condemned those that blaspheme against His gospel, freely
  given&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Again it was Sondelius who got Ira Hinkley out, not too discontented,
  while Martin could only sputter, "Now how do you suppose that maniac ever got
  here? This is going to be awful!"</p>

  <p>Before Inchcape Jones returned, the Commission ventured out for their
  first sight of the town...A Scientific Commission, yet all the while they
  were only boisterous Gustaf and doubtful Martin and casual Leora.</p>

  <p>The citizens had been told that in bubonic plague, unlike pneumonic, there
  is no danger from direct contact with people developing the disease, so long
  as vermin were kept away, but they did not believe it. They were afraid of
  one another, and the more afraid of strangers. The Commission found a street
  dying with fear. House-shutters were closed, hot slatted patches in the sun;
  and the only traffic was an empty trolley-car with a frightened motorman who
  peered down at them and sped up lest they come aboard. Grocery shops and
  drugstores were open, but from their shady depths the shopkeepers looked out
  timidly, and when the Commission neared a fish-stall, the one customer fled,
  edging past them.</p>

  <p>Once a woman, never explained, a woman with wild ungathered hair, ran by
  them shrieking, "My little boy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>They came to the market, a hundred stalls under a long corrugated-iron
  roof, with stone pillars bearing the fatuous names of the commissioners who
  had built it&mdash;by voting bonds for the building. It should have been
  buzzing with jovial buyers and sellers, but in all the gaudy booths there
  were only one Negress with a row of twig besoms, one Hindu in gray rags
  squatting before his wealth of a dozen vegetables. The rest was emptiness,
  and a litter of rotted potatoes and scudding papers.</p>

  <p>Down a grim street of coal yards, they found a public square, and here was
  the stillness not of sleep but of ancient death.</p>

  <p>The square was rimmed with the gloom of mango trees, which shut out the
  faint-hearted breeze and cooped in the heat&mdash;stale lifeless heat, in
  whose misery the leering silence was the more dismaying. Through a break in
  the evil mangoes they beheld a plaster house hung with black crape.</p>

  <p>"It's too hot to walk. Perhaps we'd better go back to the hotel," said
  Leora.</p><br>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">In the afternoon Inchcape Jones appeared with a Ford, whose
  familiarity made it the more grotesque in this creepy world, and took them to
  Penrith Lodge, on the cool hills behind Blackwater.</p>

  <p>They traversed a packed native section of bamboo hovels and shops that
  were but unpainted, black-weathered huts, without doors, without windows,
  from whose recesses dark faces looked at them resentfully. They passed, at
  their colored driver's most jerky speed, a new brick structure in front of
  which stately Negro policemen with white gloves, white sun-helmets, and
  scarlet coats cut by white belts, marched with rifles at the carry.</p>

  <p>Inchcape Jones sighed, "Schoolhouse. Turned it into pest-house. Hundred
  cases in there. Die every hour. Have to guard it&mdash;patients get delirious
  and try to escape."</p>

  <p>After them trailed an odor of rotting.</p>

  <p>Martin did not feel superior to humanity.</p><br>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="first">With broad porches and low roof, among bright flamboyants
  and the cheerful sago palms, the bungalow of Penrith Lodge lay high on a
  crest, looking across the ugly flat of the town to the wash of sea. At its
  windows the reed jalousies whispered and clattered, and the high bare rooms
  were enlivened by figured Carib scarfs...It had belonged to the Port-doctor,
  dead these three days.</p>

  <p>Inchcape Jones assured the doubtful Leora that she would nowhere else be
  so safe; the house was rat-proofed, and the doctor had caught the plague at
  the pier, had died without ever coming back to this well-beloved bungalow in
  which he, the professional bachelor, had given the most clamorous parties in
  St. Hubert.</p>

  <p>Martin had with him sufficient equipment for a small laboratory, and he
  established it in a bedroom with gas and running water. Next to it was his
  and Leora's bedroom, then an apartment which Sondelius immediately made
  homelike by dropping his clothes and his pipe ashes all over it.</p>

  <p>There were two colored maids and an ex-soldier butler, who received them
  and unpacked their bags as though the plague did not exist.</p>

  <p>Martin was perplexed by their first caller. He was a singularly handsome
  young Negro, quick-moving, intelligent of eye. Like most white Americans,
  Martin had talked a great deal about the inferiority of Negroes and had
  learned nothing whatever about them. He looked questioning as the young man
  observed:</p>

  <p>"My name is Oliver Marchand."</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"Dr. Marchand&mdash;I have my M.D. from Howard."</p>

  <p>"Oh."</p>

  <p>"May I venture to welcome you, Doctor? And may I ask before I hurry
  off&mdash;I have three cases from official families isolated at the bottom of
  the hill&mdash;oh, yes, in this crisis they permit a Negro doctor to practice
  even among the whites! But&mdash;Dr. Stokes insists that D'Herelle and you
  are right in calling bacteriophage an organism. But what about Bordet's
  contention that it's an enzyme?"</p>

  <p>Then for half an hour did Dr. Arrowsmith and Dr. Marchand, forgetting the
  plague, forgetting the more cruel plague of race-fear, draw diagrams.</p>

  <p>Marchand sighed, "I must go, Doctor. May I help you in any way I can? It
  is a great privilege to know you."</p>

  <p>He saluted quietly and was gone, a beautiful young animal. "I never
  thought a Negro doctor&mdash;I wish people wouldn't keep showing me how much
  I don't know!" said Martin.</p><br>

  <h3>VI.</h3>

  <p class="first">While Martin prepared his laboratory, Sondelius was joyfully
  at work, finding out what was wrong with Inchcape Jones's administration,
  which proved to be almost anything that could be wrong.</p>

  <p>A plague epidemic today, in a civilized land, is no longer an affair of
  people dying in the streets and of drivers shouting "Bring out your dead."
  The fight against it is conducted like modern warfare, with telephones
  instead of foaming chargers. The ancient horror bears a face of efficiency.
  There are offices, card indices, bacteriological examinations of patients and
  of rats. There is, or should be, a lone director with superlegal powers.
  There are large funds, education of the public by placard and newspaper,
  brigades of rat-killers, a corps of disinfectors, isolation of patients lest
  vermin carry the germs from them to others.</p>

  <p>In most of these particulars Inchcape Jones had failed. To have the
  existence of the plague admitted in the first place, he had had to fight the
  merchants controlling the House of Assembly, who had howled that a quarantine
  would ruin them, and who now refused to give him complete power and tried to
  manage the epidemic with a Board of Health, which was somewhat worse than
  navigating a ship during a typhoon by means of a committee.</p>

  <p>Inchcape Jones was courageous enough, but he could not cajole people. The
  newspapers called him a tyrant, would not help win over the public to take
  precautions against rats and ground squirrels. He had tried to fumigate a few
  warehouses with sulfur dioxid, but the owners complained that the fumes
  stained fabrics and paint; and the Board of Health bade him wait&mdash;wait a
  little while&mdash;wait and see. He had tried to have the rats examined, to
  discover what were the centers of infection, but his only bacteriologists
  were the overworked Stokes and Oliver Marchand; and Inchcape Jones had often
  explained, at nice dinner-parties, that he did not trust the intelligence of
  Negroes.</p>

  <p>He was nearly insane; he worked twenty hours a day; he assured himself
  that he was not afraid; he reminded himself that he had an honestly won
  D.S.O.; he longed to have someone besides a board of Red Leg merchants give
  him orders; and always in the blur of his sleepless brain he saw the hills of
  Surrey, his sisters in the rose-walk, and the basket-chairs and tea-table
  beside his father's tennis-lawn.</p>

  <p>Then Sondelius, that crafty and often lying lobbyist, that unmoral soldier
  of the Lord, burst in and became dictator.</p>

  <p>He terrified the Board of Health. He quoted his own experiences in
  Mongolia and India. He assured them that if they did not cease being
  politicians, the plague might cling in St. Hubert forever, so that they would
  no more have the amiable dollars of the tourists and the pleasures of
  smuggling.</p>

  <p>He threatened and flattered, and told a story which they had never heard,
  even at the Ice House; and he had Inchcape Jones appointed dictator of St.
  Hubert.</p>

  <p>Gustaf Sondelius stood extremely close behind the dictator.</p>

  <p>He immediately started rat-killing. On a warrant signed by Inchcape Jones,
  he arrested the owner of a warehouse who had declared that he was not going
  to have <i>his</i> piles of cocoa ruined. He marched his policemen, stout
  black fellows trained in the Great War, to the warehouse, set them on guard,
  and pumped in hydrocyanic acid gas.</p>

  <p>The crowd gathered beyond the police line, wondering, doubting. They could
  not believe that anything was happening, for the cracks in the warehouse
  walls had been adequately stuffed and there was no scent of gas. But the roof
  was leaky. The gas crept up through it, colorless, diabolic, and suddenly a
  buzzard circling above the roof tilted forward, fell slantwise, and lay dead
  among the watchers.</p>

  <p>A man picked it up, goggling.</p>

  <p>"Dead, right enough," everybody muttered. They looked at Sondelius,
  parading among his soldiers, with reverence.</p>

  <p>His rat-crew searched each warehouse before pumping in the gas, lest
  someone be left in the place, but in the third one a tramp had been asleep,
  and when the doors were anxiously opened after the fumigation, there were not
  only thousands of dead rats but also a dead and very stiff tramp.</p>

  <p>"Poor fella&mdash;bury him," said Sondelius.</p>

  <p>There was no inquest.</p>

  <p>Over a rum swizzle at the Ice House, Sondelius reflected, "I wonder how
  many men I murder, Martin? When I was disinfecting ships at Antofagasta,
  always afterward we find two or three stowaways. They hide too good. Poor
  fellas."</p>

  <p>Sondelius arbitrarily dragged bookkeepers and porters from their work, to
  pursue the rats with poison, traps, and gas, or to starve them by concreting
  and screening stables and warehouses. He made a violent red and green rat map
  of the town. He broke every law of property by raiding shops for supplies. He
  alternately bullied and caressed the leaders of the House of Assembly. He
  called on Kellett, told stories to his children, and almost wept as he
  explained what a good Lutheran he was&mdash;and consistently (but not at
  Kellett's) he drank too much.</p>

  <p>The Ice House, that dimmest and most peaceful among saloons, with its cool
  marble tables, its gilt-touched white walls, had not been closed, though only
  the oldest topers and the youngest bravos, fresh out from Home and
  agonizingly lonely for Peckham or Walthamstow, for Peel Park or the
  Cirencester High Street, were desperate enough to go there, and of the
  attendants there remained only one big Jamaica barman. By chance he was among
  them all the most divine mixer of the planter's punch, the New Orleans fizz,
  and the rum swizzle. His masterpieces Sondelius acclaimed, he alone placid
  among the scary patrons who came in now not to dream but to gulp and flee.
  After a day of slaughtering rats and disinfecting houses he sat with Martin,
  with Martin and Leora, or with whomever he could persuade to linger.</p>

  <p>To Gustaf Sondelius, dukes and cobblers were alike remarkable, and Martin
  was sometimes jealous when he saw Sondelius turning to a cocoa-broker's clerk
  with the same smile he gave to Martin. For hours Sondelius talked, of
  Shanghai and epistemology and the painting of Nevinson; for hours he sang
  scurrilous lyrics of the Quarter, and boomed, "Yey, how I kill the rats at
  Kellett's wharf today! I don't t'ink one little swizzle would break down too
  many glomeruli in an honest man's kidneys."</p>

  <p>He was cheerful, but never with the reproving and infuriating cheerfulness
  of an Ira Hinkley. He mocked himself, Martin, Leora, and their work. At home
  dinner he never cared what he ate (though he did care what he drank), which
  at Penrith Lodge was desirable, in view of Leora's efforts to combine the
  views of Wheatsylvania with the standards of West Indian servants and the
  absence of daily deliveries. He shouted and sang&mdash;and took precautions
  for working among rats and the agile fleas: the high boots, the strapped
  wrists, and the rubber neck-band which he had invented and which is known in
  every tropical supply shop today as the Sondelius Anti-vermin Neck
  Protector.</p>

  <p>It happened that he was, without Martin or Gottlieb ever understanding it,
  the most brilliant as well as the least pompous and therefore least
  appreciated warrior against epidemics that the world has known.</p>

  <p>Thus with Sondelius, though for Martin there were as yet but embarrassment
  and futility and the fear of fear.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch34"
     name="ch34">CHAPTER XXXIV.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">To persuade the shopkeeping lords of St. Hubert to endure a
  test in which half of them might die, so that all plague
  might&mdash;perhaps&mdash;be ended forever, was impossible. Martin argued
  with Inchcape Jones, with Sondelius, but he had no favor, and he began to
  meditate a political campaign as he would have meditated an experiment.</p>

  <p>He had seen the suffering of the plague and he had (though he still
  resisted) been tempted to forget experimentation, to give up the possible
  saving of millions for the immediate saving of thousands. Inchcape Jones, a
  little rested now under Sondelius's padded bullying and able to slip into a
  sane routine, drove Martin to the village of Carib, which, because of its
  pest of infected ground squirrels, was proportionately worse smitten than
  Blackwater.</p>

  <p>They sped out of the capital by white shell roads agonizing to the
  sun-poisoned eyes; they left the dusty shanties of suburban Yamtown for a
  land cool with bamboo groves and palmettoes, thick with sugar-cane. From a
  hilltop they swung down a curving road to a beach where the high surf boomed
  in limestone caves. It seemed impossible that this joyous shore could be
  threatened by plague, the slimy creature of dark alleys.</p>

  <p>The motor cut through a singing trade wind which told of clean sails and
  disdainful men. They darted on where the foam feathers below Point Carib and
  where, round that lone royal palm on the headland, the bright wind hums. They
  slipped into a hot valley, and came to the village of Carib and to creeping
  horror.</p>

  <p>The plague had been dismaying in Blackwater; in Carib it was the end of
  all things. The rat-fleas had found fat homes in the ground squirrels which
  burrowed in every garden about the village. In Blackwater there had from the
  first been isolation of the sick, but in Carib death was in every house, and
  the village was surrounded by soldier police, with bayonets, who let no one
  come or go save the doctors.</p>

  <p>Martin was guided down the stinking street of cottages palm-thatched and
  walled with cow-dung plaster on bamboo laths, cottages shared by the roosters
  and the goats. He heard men shrieking in delirium; a dozen times he saw that
  face of terror&mdash;sunken bloody eyes, drawn face, open mouth&mdash;which
  marks the Black Death; and once he beheld an exquisite girl child in coma on
  the edge of death, her tongue black and round her the scent of the tomb.</p>

  <p>They fled away, to Point Carib and the trade wind, and when Inchcape Jones
  demanded, "After that sort of thing, can you really talk of experimenting?"
  then Martin shook his head, while he tried to recall the vision of Gottlieb
  and all their little plans: "half to get the phage, half to be sternly
  deprived."</p>

  <p>It came to him that Gottlieb, in his secluded innocence, had not realized
  what it meant to gain leave to experiment amid the hysteria of an
  epidemic.</p>

  <p>He went to the Ice House; he had a drink with a frightened clerk from
  Derbyshire; he regained the picture of Gottlieb's sunken, demanding eyes; and
  he swore that he would not yield to a compassion which in the end would make
  all compassion futile.</p>

  <p>Since Inchcape Jones could not understand the need of experimentation, he
  would call on the Governor, Colonel Sir Robert Fairlamb.</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">Though Government House was officially the chief residence
  of St. Hubert, it was but a thatched bungalow a little larger than Martin's
  own Penrith Lodge. When he saw it, Martin felt more easy, and he ambled up to
  the broad steps, at nine of the evening, as though he were dropping in to
  call on a neighbor in Wheatsylvania.</p>

  <p>He was stopped by a Jamaican man-servant of appalling courtesy.</p>

  <p>He snorted that he was Dr. Arrowsmith, head of the McGurk Commission, and
  he was sorry but he must see Sir Robert at once.</p>

  <p>The servant was suggesting, in his blandest and most annoying manner, that
  really Dr. Uh would do better to see the Surgeon General, when a broad red
  face and a broad red voice projected themselves over the veranda railing,
  with a rumble of, "Send him up, Jackson, and don't be a fool!"</p>

  <p>Sir Robert and Lady Fairlamb were finishing dinner on the veranda, at a
  small round table littered with coffee and liqueurs and starred with candles.
  She was a slight, nervous insignificance; he was rather puffy, very flushed,
  undoubtedly courageous, and altogether dismayed; and at a time when no
  laundress dared go anywhere, his evening shirt was luminous.</p>

  <p>Martin was in his now beloved linen suit, with a crumply soft shirt which
  Leora had been meanin' to wash.</p>

  <p>Martin explained what he wanted to do&mdash;what he must do, if the world
  was ever to get over the absurdity of having plague.</p>

  <p>Sir Robert listened so agreeably that Martin thought he understood, but at
  the end he bellowed:</p>

  <p>"Young man, if I were commanding a division at the front, with a dud show,
  an awful show, going on, and a War Office clerk asked me to risk the whole
  thing to try out some precious little invention of his own, can you imagine
  what I'd answer? There isn't much I can do now&mdash;these doctor Johnnies
  have taken everything out of my hands&mdash;but as far as possible I shall
  certainly prevent you Yankee vivisectionists from coming in and using us as a
  lot of sanguinary&mdash;sorry, Evelyn&mdash;sanguinary corpses. Good night,
  sir!"</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">Thanks to Sondelius's crafty bullying, Martin was able to
  present his plan to a Special Board composed of the Governor, the temporarily
  suspended Board of Health, Inchcape Jones, several hearty members of the
  House of Assembly, and Sondelius himself, attending in the unofficial
  capacity which all over the world he had found useful for masking a cheerful
  tyranny. Sondelius even brought in the Negro doctor, Oliver Marchand, not on
  the ground that he was the most intelligent person on the island (which
  happened to be Sondelius's reason) but because he "represented the plantation
  hands."</p>

  <p>Sondelius himself was as much opposed to Martin's unemotional experiments
  as was Fairlamb; he believed that all experiments should be, by devices not
  entirely clear to him, carried on in the laboratory without disturbing the
  conduct of agreeable epidemics, but he could never resist a drama like the
  innocent meeting of the Special Board.</p>

  <p>The meeting was set for a week ahead...with scores dying every day. While
  he waited for it Martin manufactured more phage and helped Sondelius murder
  rats, and Leora listened to the midnight debates of the two men and tried to
  make them acknowledge that it had been wise to let her come. Inchcape Jones
  offered to Martin the position of Government bacteriologist, but he refused
  lest he be sidetracked.</p>

  <p>The Special Board met in Parliament House, all of them trying to look not
  like their simple and domestic selves but like judges. With them appeared
  such doctors of the island as could find the time.</p>

  <p>While Leora listened from the back of the room, Martin addressed them, not
  unaware of the spectacle of little Mart Arrowsmith of Elk Mills taken
  seriously by the rulers of a tropic isle headed by a Sir Somebody. Beside him
  stood Max Gottlieb, and in Gottlieb's power he reverently sought to explain
  that mankind has ever given up eventual greatness because some crisis, some
  war or election or loyalty to a Messiah which at the moment seemed weighty,
  has choked the patient search for truth. He sought to explain that he
  could&mdash;perhaps&mdash;save half of a given district, but that to test for
  all time the value of phage, the other half must be left without it...though,
  he craftily told them, in any case the luckless half would receive as much
  care as at present.</p>

  <p>Most of the Board had heard that he possessed a magic cure for the plague
  which for unknown and probably discreditable reasons, he was withholding, and
  they were not going to have it withheld. There was a great deal of discussion
  rather unconnected with what he had said, and out of it came only the fact
  that everybody except Stokes and Oliver Marchand was against him; Kellett was
  angry with this American, Sir Robert Fairlamb was beefily disapproving, and
  Sondelius admitted that though Martin was quite a decent young man, he was a
  fanatic.</p>

  <p>Into their argument plunged a fury in the person of Ira Hinkley,
  missionary of the Sanctification Brotherhood.</p>

  <p>Martin had not seen him since the first morning in Blackwater. He gaped as
  he heard Ira pleading:</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen, I know almost the whole bunch of you are Church of England,
  but I beg you to listen to me, not as a minister but as a qualified doctor of
  medicine. Oh, the wrath of God is upon you&mdash;But I mean: I was a
  classmate of Arrowsmith in the States. I'm onto him! He was such a failure
  that he was suspended from medical school. A scientist! And his boss, this
  fellow Gottlieb, he was fired from the University of Winnemac for
  incompetence! I know 'em! Liars and fools! Scorners of righteousness! Has
  anybody but Arrowsmith himself told you he's a qualified scientist?"</p>

  <p>The face of Sondelius changed from curiosity to stolid Scandinavian wrath.
  He arose and shouted:</p>

  <p>"Sir Robert, this man is crazy! Dr. Gottlieb is one of the seven
  distinguished living scientists, and Dr. Arrowsmith is his representative! I
  announce my agreement with him, complete. As you must have seen from my work,
  I'm perfectly independent of him and entirely at your service, but I know his
  standing and I follow him, quite humbly."</p>

  <p>The Special Board coaxed Ira Hinkley out, for the meanest of
  reasons&mdash;in St. Hubert the whites do not greatly esteem the holy
  ecstasies of Negroes in the Sanctification Brotherhood chapels&mdash;but they
  voted only to "give the matter their consideration," while still men died by
  the score each day, and in Manchuria as in St. Hubert they prayed for rest
  from the ancient clawing pain.</p>

  <p>Outside, as the Special Board trudged away, Sondelius blared at Martin and
  the indignant Leora, "Yey, a fine fight!"</p>

  <p>Martin answered, "Gustaf, you've joined me now. The first darn' thing you
  do, you come have a shot of phage."</p>

  <p>"No. Slim, I said I will not have your phage till you give it to
  everybody. I mean it, no matter how much I make fools of your Board."</p>

  <p>As they stood before Parliament House, a small motor possessing everything
  but comfort and power staggered up to them, and from it vaulted a man lean as
  Gottlieb and English as Inchcape Jones.</p>

  <p>"You Dr. Arrowsmith? My name is Twyford, Cecil Twyford of St. Swithin's
  Parish. Tried to get here for the Special Board meeting, but my beastly
  foreman had to take the afternoon off and die of plague. Stokes has told me
  your plans. Quite right. All nonsense to go on having plague. Board refused?
  Sorry. Perhaps we can do something in St. Swithin's. Goo' day."</p>

  <p>All evening Martin and Sondelius were full of language. Martin went to bed
  longing for the regularity of working all night and foraging for cigarettes
  at dawn. He could not sleep, because an imaginary Ira Hinkley was always
  bursting in on him.</p>

  <p>Four days later he heard that Ira was dead.</p>

  <p>Till he had sunk in coma, Ira had nursed and blessed his people, the
  humble colored congregation in the hot tin chapel which he had now turned
  into a pest-house. He staggered from cot to cot, under the gospel texts he
  had lettered on the whitewashed wall, then he cried once, loudly, and dropped
  by the pine pulpit where he had joyed to preach.</p><br>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">One chance Martin did have. In Carib, where every third man
  was down with plague and one doctor to attend them all, he now gave phage to
  the entire village; a long strain of injections, not improved by the
  knowledge that one jaunty flea from any patient might bring him the
  plague.</p>

  <p>The tedium of dread was forgotten when he began to find and make precise
  notes of a slackening of the epidemic, which was occurring nowhere except
  here at Carib.</p>

  <p>He came home raving to Leora, "I'll show 'em! Now they'll let me try test
  conditions, and then when the epidemic's over we'll hustle home. It'll be
  lovely to be cold again! Wonder if Holabird and Sholtheis are any more
  friendly now? Be pretty good to see the little ole flat, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, won't it!" said Leora. "I wish I'd thought to have the kitchen
  painted while we're away...I think I'll put that blue chair in the
  bedroom."</p>

  <p>Though there was a decrease in the Plague at Carib, Sondelius was worried,
  because it was the worst center for infected ground squirrels on the island.
  He made decisions quickly. One evening he explained certain things to
  Inchcape Jones and Martin, rode down their doubts, and snorted:</p>

  <p>"Only way to disinfect that place is to burn it&mdash;burn th' whole
  thing. Have it done by morning, before anybody can stop us."</p>

  <p>With Martin as his lieutenant he marshaled his troop of
  rat-catchers&mdash;ruffians all of them, with high boots, tied jacket
  sleeves, and ebon visages of piracy. They stole food from shops, tents and
  blankets and camp-stoves from the Government military warehouse, and jammed
  their booty into motor trucks. The line of trucks roared down to Carib, the
  rat-catchers sitting atop, singing pious hymns.</p>

  <p>They charged on the village, drove out the healthy, carried the sick on
  litters, settled them all in tents in a pasture up the valley, and after
  midnight they burned the town.</p>

  <p>The troops ran among the huts, setting them alight with fantastic torches.
  The palm thatch sent up thick smoke, dead sluggish white with currents of
  ghastly black through which broke sudden flames. Against the glare the
  palmettoes were silhouetted. The solid-seeming huts were instantly changed
  into thin bamboo frameworks, thin lines of black slats, with the thatch
  falling in sparks. The flame lighted the whole valley; roused the terrified
  squawking birds, and turned the surf at Point Carib to bloody foam.</p>

  <p>With such of the natives as had strength enough and sense enough,
  Sondelius's troops made a ring about the burning village, shouting insanely
  as they clubbed the fleeing rats and ground squirrels. In the flare of
  devastation Sondelius was a fiend, smashing the bewildered rats with a club,
  shooting at them as they fled, and singing to himself all the while the
  obscene chantey of Bill the Sailor. But at dawn he was nursing the sick in
  the bright new canvas village, showing mammies how to use their camp-stoves,
  and in a benevolent way discussing methods of poisoning ground squirrels in
  their burrows.</p>

  <p>Sondelius returned to Blackwater, but Martin remained in the tent village
  for two days, giving them the phage, making notes, directing the amateur
  nurses. He returned to Blackwater one mid-afternoon and sought the office of
  the Surgeon General, or what had been the office of the Surgeon General till
  Sondelius had come and taken it away from him.</p>

  <p>Sondelius was there, at Inchcape Jones's desk, but for once he was not
  busy. He was sunk in his chair, his eyes bloodshot.</p>

  <p>"Yey! We had a fine time with the rats at Carib, eh? How is my new tent
  willage?" he chuckled, but his voice was weak, and as he rose he
  staggered.</p>

  <p>"What is it? What is it?"</p>

  <p>"I t'ink&mdash;It's got me. Some flea got me. Yes," in a shaky but
  extremely interested manner, "I was yoost thinking I will go and quarantine
  myself. I have fever all right, and adenitis. My strength&mdash;Huh! I am
  almost sixty, but the way I can lift weights that no sailor can
  touch&mdash;And I could fight five rounds! Oh, my God, Martin, I am so weak!
  Not scared! No!"</p>

  <p>But for Martin's arms he would have collapsed.</p>

  <p>He refused to return to Penrith Lodge and Leora's nursing. "I who have
  isolated so many&mdash;it is my turn," he said.</p>

  <p>Martin and Inchcape Jones found for Sondelius a meager clean
  cottage&mdash;the family had died there, all of them, but it had been
  fumigated. They procured a nurse and Martin himself attended the sick man,
  trying to remember that once he had been a doctor, who understood ice-bags
  and consolation. One thing was not to be had&mdash;mosquito netting&mdash;and
  only of this did Sondelius complain.</p>

  <p>Martin bent over him, agonized to see how burning was his skin, how
  swollen his face and his tongue, how weak his voice as he babbled:</p>

  <p>"Gottlieb is right about these jests of God. Yey! His best one is the
  tropics. God planned them so beautiful, flowers and sea and mountains. He
  made the fruit to grow so well that man need not work&mdash;and then He
  laughed, and stuck in volcanoes and snakes and damp heat and early senility
  and the plague and malaria. But the nastiest trick He ever played on man was
  inventing the flea."</p>

  <p>His bloated lips widened, from his hot throat oozed a feeble croaking, and
  Martin realized that he was trying to laugh.</p>

  <p>He became delirious, but between spasms he muttered, with infinite pain,
  tears in his eyes at his own weakness:</p>

  <p>"I want you to see how an agnostic can die!</p>

  <p>"I am not afraid, but yoost once more I would like to see Stockholm, and
  Fifth Avenue on the day the first snow falls and Holy Week at Sevilla. And
  one good last drunk! I am very peaceful, Slim. It hurts some, but life was a
  good game. And&mdash;I am a pious agnostic. Oh, Martin, give my people the
  phage! Save all of them&mdash;God, I did not think they could hurt me
  so!"</p>

  <p>His heart had failed. He was still on his low cot.</p><br>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="first">Martin had an unhappy pride that, with all his love for
  Gustaf Sondelius, he could still keep his head, still resist Inchcape Jones's
  demand that he give the phage to everyone, still do what he had been sent to
  do.</p>

  <p>"I'm not a sentimentalist; I'm a scientist!" he boasted.</p>

  <p>They snarled at him in the streets now; small boys called him names and
  threw stones. They had heard that he was willfully withholding their
  salvation. The citizens came in Committees to beg him to heal their children,
  and he was so shaken that he had ever to keep before him the vision of
  Gottlieb.</p>

  <p>The panic was increasing. They who had at first kept cool could not endure
  the strain of wakening at night to see upon their windows the glow of the
  pile of logs on Admiral Knob, the emergency crematory where Gustaf Sondelius
  and his curly gray mop had been shoveled into the fire along with a crippled
  Negro boy and a Hindu beggar.</p>

  <p>Sir Robert Fairlamb was a blundering hero, exasperating the sick while he
  tried to nurse them; Stokes remained the Rock of Ages&mdash;he had only three
  hours' sleep a night, but he never failed to take his accustomed fifteen
  minutes of exercise when he awoke; and Leora was busy in Penrith Lodge,
  helping Martin prepare phage.</p>

  <p>It was the Surgeon General who went to pieces.</p>

  <p>Robbed of his dependence on the despised Sondelius, sunk again in a mad
  planlessness, Inchcape Jones shrieked when he thought he was speaking low,
  and the cigarette which was ever in his thin hand shook so that the smoke
  quivered up in trembling spirals.</p>

  <p>Making his tour, he came at night on a sloop by which a dozen Red Legs
  were escaping to Barbados, and suddenly he was among them, bribing them to
  take him along.</p>

  <p>As the sloop stood out from Blackwater Harbor he stretched his arms toward
  his sisters and the peace of the Surrey hills, but as the few frightened
  lights of the town were lost, he realized that he was a coward and came up
  out of his madness, with his lean head high.</p>

  <p>He demanded that they turn the sloop and take him back. They refused,
  howling at him, and locked him in the cabin. They were becalmed; it was two
  days before they reached Barbados, and by then the world would know that he
  had deserted.</p>

  <p>Altogether expressionless, Inchcape Jones tramped from the sloop to a
  waterfront hotel in Barbados, and stood for a long time in a slatternly room
  smelling of slop-pails. He would never see his sisters and the cool hills.
  With the revolver which he had carried to drive terrified patients back into
  the isolation wards, with the revolver which he had carried at Arras, he
  killed himself.</p><br>

  <h3>VI.</h3>

  <p class="first">Thus Martin came to his experiment. Stokes was appointed
  Surgeon General, vice Inchcape Jones, and he made an illegal assignment of
  Martin to St. Swithin's Parish, as medical officer with complete power. This,
  and the concurrence of Cecil Twyford, made his experiment possible.</p>

  <p>He was invited to stay at Twyford's. His only trouble was the guarding of
  Leora. He did not know what he would encounter in St. Swithin's, while
  Penrith Lodge was as safe as any place on the island. When Leora insisted
  that, during his experiment, the cold thing which had stilled the laughter of
  Sondelius might come to him and he might need her, he tried to satisfy her by
  promising that if there was a place for her in St. Swithin's, he would send
  for her.</p>

  <p>Naturally, he was lying.</p>

  <p>"Hard enough to see Gustaf go. By thunder she's not going to run risks!"
  he vowed.</p>

  <p>He left her, protected by the maids and the soldier butler, with Dr.
  Oliver Marchand to look in when he could.</p><br>

  <h3>VII.</h3>

  <p class="first">In St. Swithin's Parish the cocoa and bamboo groves and
  sharp hills of southern St. Hubert gave way to unbroken cane-fields. Here
  Cecil Twyford, that lean abrupt man, ruled every acre and interpreted every
  law.</p>

  <p>His place, Frangipani Court, was a refuge from the hot humming plain. The
  house was old and low, of thick stone and plaster walls; the paneled rooms
  were lined with the china, the portraits, and the swords of Twyfords for
  three hundred years; and between the wings was a walled garden dazzling with
  hibiscus.</p>

  <p>Twyford led Martin through the low cool hall and introduced him to five
  great sons and to his mother, who, since his wife's death, ten years ago, had
  been mistress of the house.</p>

  <p>"Have tea?" said Twyford. "Our American guest will be down in a
  moment."</p>

  <p>He would not have thought of saying it, but he had sworn that since for
  generations Twyfords had drunk tea here at a seemly hour, no panic should
  prevent their going on drinking it at that hour.</p>

  <p>When Martin came into the garden, when he saw the old silver on the wicker
  table and heard the quiet voices, the plague seemed conquered, and he
  realized that, four thousand miles southwest of the Lizard, he was in
  England.</p>

  <p>They were seated, pleasant but not too comfortable, when the American
  guest came down and from the door stared at Martin as strangely as he stared
  in turn.</p>

  <p>He beheld a woman who must be his sister. She was perhaps thirty to his
  thirty-seven, but in her slenderness, her paleness, her black brows and dusky
  hair, she was his twin; she was his self enchanted.</p>

  <p>He could hear his voice croaking, "But you're my sister!" and she opened
  her lips, yet neither of them spoke as they bowed at introduction. When she
  sat down, Martin had never been so conscious of a woman's presence.</p>

  <p>He learned, before evening, that she was Joyce Lanyon, widow of Roger
  Lanyon of New York. She had come to St. Hubert to see her plantations and had
  been trapped by the quarantine. He had tentatively heard of her dead husband
  as a young man of wealth and family; he seemed to remember having seen in
  Vanity Fair a picture of the Lanyons at Palm Beach.</p>

  <p>She talked only of the weather, the flowers, but there was a rising gaiety
  in her which stirred even the dour Cecil Twyford. In the midst of her
  debonair insults to the hugest of the huge sons, Martin turned on her:</p>

  <p>"You <i>are</i> my sister!"</p>

  <p>"Obviously. Well, since you're a scientist&mdash;Are you a good
  scientist?"</p>

  <p>"Pretty good."</p>

  <p>"I've met your Mrs. McGurk. And Dr. Rippleton Holabird. Met 'em in Hessian
  Hook. You know it, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"No, I&mdash;Oh, I've heard of it."</p>

  <p>"You know. It's that renovated old part of Brooklyn where writers and
  economists and all those people, some of them almost as good as the very
  best, consort with people who are almost as smart as the very smartest. You
  know. Where they dress for dinner but all of them have heard about James
  Joyce. Dr. Holabird is frightfully charming, don't you think?"</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tell me. I really mean it. Cecil has been explaining what you plan to do
  experimentally. Could I help you&mdash;nursing or cooking or
  something&mdash;or would I merely be in the way?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know yet. If I can use you, I'll be unscrupulous enough!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't be earnest like Cecil here, and Dr. Stokes! They have no sense
  of play. Do you like that man Stokes? Cecil adores him, and I suppose he's
  simply infested with virtues, but I find him so dry and thin and
  unappetizing. Don't you think he might be a little gayer?"</p>

  <p>Martin gave up all chance of knowing her as he hurled:</p>

  <p>"Look here! You said you found Holabird 'charming.' It makes me tired to
  have you fall for his scientific tripe and not appreciate Stokes. Stokes is
  hard&mdash;thank God!&mdash;and probably he's rude. Why not? He's fighting a
  world that bellows for fake charm. No scientist can go through his grind and
  not come out more or less rude. And I tell you Stokes was born a researcher.
  I wish we had him at McGurk. Rude? Wish you could hear him being rude to
  me!"</p>

  <p>Twyford looked doubtful, his mother looked delicately shocked, and the
  five sons beefily looked nothing at all, while Martin raged on, trying to
  convey his vision of the barbarian, the ascetic, the contemptuous acolyte of
  science. But Joyce Lanyon's lovely eyes were kind, and when she spoke she had
  lost something of her too-cosmopolitan manner of a diner-out:</p>

  <p>"Yes. I suppose it's the difference between me, playing at being a
  planter, and Cecil."</p>

  <p>After dinner he walked with her in the garden and sought to defend himself
  against he was not quite sure what, till she hinted:</p>

  <p>"My dear man, you're so apologetic about never being apologetic! If you
  really must be my twin brother, do me the honor of telling me to go to the
  devil whenever you want to. I don't mind. Now about your Gottlieb, who seems
  to be so much of an obsession with you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Obsession! Rats! He&mdash;"</p>

  <p>They parted an hour after.</p>

  <p>Least of all things Martin desired such another peeping, puerile,
  irritable restlessness as he had shared with Orchid Pickerbaugh, but as he
  went to bed in a room with old prints and a four-poster, it was disturbing to
  know that somewhere near him was Joyce Lanyon.</p>

  <p>He sat up, aghast with truth. Was he going to fall in love with this
  desirable and quite useless young woman? (How lovely her shoulders, above
  black satin at dinner! She had a genius of radiant flesh; it made that of
  most women, even the fragile Leora, seem coarse and thick. There was a rosy
  glow behind it, as from an inner light.)</p>

  <p>Did he really want Leora here, with Joyce Lanyon in the house? (Dear
  Leora, who was the source of life! Was she now, off there in Penrith Lodge,
  missing him, lying awake for him?)</p>

  <p>How could he, even in the crisis of an epidemic, invite the formal
  Twyfords to invite Leora? (How honest was he? That afternoon he had
  recognized the rigid though kindly code of the Twyfords, but could he not set
  it aside by being frankly an Outlander?)</p>

  <p>Suddenly he was out of bed, kneeling, praying to Leora.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch35"
     name="ch35">CHAPTER XXXV.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">The plague had only begun to invade St. Swithin's, but it
  was unquestionably coming, and Martin, with his power as official medical
  officer of the parish, was able to make plans. He divided the population into
  two equal parts. One of them, driven in by Twyford, was injected with plague
  phage, the other half was left without.</p>

  <p>He began to succeed. He saw far-off India, with its annual four hundred
  thousand deaths from plague, saved by his efforts. He heard Max Gottlieb
  saying, "Martin, you haf done your experiment. I am very glat!"</p>

  <p>The pest attacked the unphaged half of the parish much more heavily than
  those who had been treated. There did appear a case or two among those who
  had the phage, but among the others there were ten, then twenty, then thirty
  daily victims. These unfortunate cases he treated, giving the phage to
  alternate patients, in the somewhat barren almshouse of the parish, a
  whitewashed cabin the meaner against its vaulting background of banyans and
  breadfruit trees.</p>

  <p>He could never understand Cecil Twyford. Though Twyford had considered his
  hands as slaves, though he had, in his great barony, given them only this
  barren almshouse, yet he risked his life now in nursing them, and the lives
  of all his sons.</p>

  <p>Despite Martin's discouragement, Mrs. Lanyon came down to cook, and a
  remarkably good cook she was. She also made beds; she showed more
  intelligence than the Twyford men about disinfecting herself; and as she
  bustled about the rusty kitchen, in a gingham gown she had borrowed from a
  maid, she so disturbed Martin that he forgot to be gruff.</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">In the evening, while they returned by Twyford's rattling
  little motor to Frangipani Court, Mrs. Lanyon talked to Martin as one who had
  shared his work, but when she had bathed and powdered and dressed, he talked
  to her as one who was afraid of her. Their bond was their resemblance as
  brother and sister. They decided, almost irritably, that they looked utterly
  alike, except that her hair was more patent-leather than his and she lacked
  his impertinent, cocking eyebrow.</p>

  <p>Often Martin returned to his patients at night, but once or twice Mrs.
  Lanyon and he fled, as much from the family stolidity of the Twyfords as from
  the thought of fever-scorched patients, to the shore of a rocky lagoon which
  cut far in from the sea.</p>

  <p>They sat on a cliff, full of the sound of the healing tide. His brain was
  hectic with the memory of charts on the whitewashed broad planks, of the
  almshouse, the sun cracks in the wall, the puffy terrified faces of black
  patients, how one of the Twyford sons had knocked over an ampule of phage,
  and how itchingly hot it had been in the ward. But to his intensity the
  lagoon breeze was cooling, and cooling the rustling tide. He perceived that
  Mrs. Lanyon's white frock was fluttering about her knees; he realized that
  she too was strained and still. He turned somberly toward her, and she
  cried:</p>

  <p>"I'm so frightened and so lonely! The Twyfords are heroic, but they're
  stone. I'm so marooned!"</p>

  <p>He kissed her, and she rested against his shoulder. The softness of her
  sleeve was agitating to his hand. But she broke away with:</p>

  <p>"No! You don't really care a hang about me. Just curious. Perhaps that's a
  good thing for me&mdash;tonight."</p>

  <p>He tried to assure her, to assure himself, that he did care with peculiar
  violence, but languor was over him; between him and her fragrance were the
  hospital cots, a great weariness, and the still face of Leora. They were
  silent together, and when his hand crept to hers they sat unimpassioned,
  comprehending, free to talk of what they would.</p>

  <p>He stood outside her door, when they had returned to the house, and
  imagined her soft moving within.</p>

  <p>"No," he raged. "Can't do it. Joyce&mdash;women like her&mdash;one of the
  million things I've given up for work and for Lee. Well. That's all there is
  to it then. But if I were here two weeks&mdash;Fool! She'd be furious if you
  knocked! But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was aware of the dagger of light under her door; the more aware of it
  as he turned his back and tramped to his room.</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">The telephone service in St. Hubert was the clumsiest
  feature of the island. There was no telephone at Penrith Lodge&mdash;the
  port-doctor had cheerfully been wont to get his calls through a neighbor. The
  central was now demoralized by the plague, and when for two hours Martin had
  tried to have Leora summoned, he gave up.</p>

  <p>But he had triumphed. In three or four days he would drive to Penrith
  Lodge. Twyford had blankly assented to his suggestion that Leora be invited
  hither, and if she and Joyce Lanyon should become such friends that Joyce
  would never again turn to him in loneliness, he was willing, he was
  eager&mdash;he was almost eager.</p><br>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">When Martin left her at the Lodge, in the leafy gloom high
  on the Penrith Hills, Leora felt his absence. They had been so little apart
  since he had first come on her, scrubbing a hospital room in Zenith.</p>

  <p>The afternoon was unending; each time she heard a creaking she roused with
  the hope that it was his step, and realized that he would not be coming, all
  the blank evening, the terrifying night; would not be here anywhere, not his
  voice nor the touch of his hand.</p>

  <p>Dinner was mournful. Often enough she had dined alone when Martin was at
  the Institute, but then he had been returning to her some time before
  dawn&mdash;probably&mdash;and she had reflectively munched a snack on the
  corner of the kitchen table, looking at the funnies in the evening paper.
  Tonight she had to live up to the butler, who served her as though she were a
  dinner-party of twenty.</p>

  <p>She sat on the porch, staring at the shadowy roofs of Blackwater below,
  sure that she felt a "miasm" writhing up through the hot darkness.</p>

  <p>She knew the direction of St. Swithin's Parish&mdash;beyond that delicate
  glimmer of lights from palm huts coiling up the hills. She concentrated on
  it, wondering if by some magic she might not have a signal from him, but she
  could get no feeling of his looking toward her. She sat long and quiet...She
  had nothing to do.</p>

  <p>Her night was sleepless. She tried to read in bed, by an electric globe
  inside the misty little tent of the mosquito-netting, but there was a tear in
  the netting and the mosquitoes crept through. As she turned out the light and
  lay tense, unable to give herself over to sleep, unable to sink into
  security, while to her blurred eyes the half-seen folds of the mosquito
  netting seemed to slide about her, she tried to remember whether these
  mosquitoes might be carrying plague germs. She realized how much she had
  depended on Martin for such bits of knowledge, as for all philosophy. She
  recalled how annoyed he had been because she could not remember whether the
  yellow fever mosquito was Anopheles or Stegomyia&mdash;or was it
  Aedes?&mdash;and suddenly she laughed in the night.</p>

  <p>She was reminded that he had told her to give herself another injection of
  phage.</p>

  <p>"Hang it, I forgot. Well, I must be sure to do that tomorrow.</p>

  <p>"Do that t'morrow&mdash;do that t'morrow," buzzed in her brain, an
  irritating inescapable refrain, while she was suspended over sleep, conscious
  of how much she wanted to creep into his arms.</p>

  <p>Next morning (and she did not remember to give herself another injection)
  the servants seemed twitchy, and her effort to comfort them brought out the
  news that Oliver Marchand, the doctor on whom they depended, was dead.</p>

  <p>In the afternoon the butler heard that his sister had been taken off to
  the isolation ward, and he went down to Blackwater to make arrangements for
  his nieces. He did not return; no one ever learned what had become of
  him.</p>

  <p>Toward dusk, when Leora felt as though a skirmish line were closing in on
  her, she fled into Martin's laboratory. It seemed filled with his jerky
  brimming presence. She kept away from the flasks of plague germs, but she
  picked up, because it was his, a half-smoked cigarette and lighted it.</p>

  <p>Now there was a slight crack in her lips; and that morning, fumbling at
  dusting&mdash;here in the laboratory meant as a fortress against
  disease&mdash;a maid had knocked over a test-tube, which had trickled. The
  cigarette seemed dry enough, but in it there were enough plague germs to kill
  a regiment.</p>

  <p>Two nights after, when she was so desperately lonely that she thought of
  walking to Blackwater, finding a motor, and fleeing to Martin, she woke with
  a fever, a headache, her limbs chilly. When the maids discovered her in the
  morning, they fled from the house. While lassitude flowed round her, she was
  left alone in the isolated house, with no telephone.</p>

  <p>All day, all night, as her throat crackled with thirst, she lay longing
  for someone to help her. Once she crawled to the kitchen for water. The floor
  of the bedroom was an endless heaving sea, the hall a writhing dimness, and
  by the kitchen door she dropped and lay for an hour, whimpering.</p>

  <p>"Got to&mdash;got to&mdash;can't remember what it was," her voice kept
  appealing to her cloudy brain.</p>

  <p>Aching, fighting the ache, she struggled up, wrapped about her a shabby
  cloak which one of the maids had abandoned in flight, and in the darkness
  staggered out to find help. As she came to the highway she stumbled, and lay
  under the hedge, unmoving, like a hurt animal. On hands and knees she crawled
  back into the Lodge, and between times, as her brain went dark, she nearly
  forgot the pain in her longing for Martin.</p>

  <p>She was bewildered; she was lonely; she dared not start on her long
  journey without his hand to comfort her. She listened for
  him&mdash;listened&mdash;tense with listening.</p>

  <p>"You will come! I know you'll come and help me! I know. You'll come!
  Martin! Sandy! <i>Sandy!</i>" she sobbed.</p>

  <p>Then she slipped down into the kindly coma. There was no more pain, and
  all the shadowy house was quiet but for her hoarse and struggling
  breath.</p><br>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="first">Like Sondelius, Joyce Lanyon tried to persuade Martin to
  give the phage to everybody.</p>

  <p>"I'm getting to be good and stern, with all you people after me. Regular
  Gottlieb. Nothing can make me do it, not if they tried to lynch me," he
  boasted.</p>

  <p>He had explained Leora to Joyce.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether you two will like each other. You're so darn'
  different. You're awfully articulate, and you like these 'pretty people' that
  you're always talking about, but she doesn't care a hang for 'em. She sits
  back&mdash;oh, she never misses anything, but she never says much. Still,
  she's got the best instinct for honesty that I've ever known. I hope you
  two'll get each other. I was afraid to let her come here&mdash;didn't know
  what I'd find&mdash;but now I'm going to hustle to Penrith and bring her here
  today."</p>

  <p>He borrowed Twyford's car and drove to Blackwater, up to Penrith, in
  excellent spirits. For all the plague, they could have a lively time in the
  evenings. One of the Twyford sons was not so solemn; he and Joyce, with
  Martin and Leora, could slip down to the lagoon for picnic suppers; they
  would sing&mdash;</p>

  <p>He came up to Penrith Lodge bawling, "Lee! Leora! Come on! <i>Here</i> we
  are!"</p>

  <p>The veranda, as he ran up on it, was leaf-scattered and dusty, and the
  front door was banging. His voice echoed in a desperate silence. He was
  uneasy. He darted in, found no one in the living-room, the kitchen, then
  hastened into their bedroom.</p>

  <p>On the bed, across the folds of the torn mosquito netting, was Leora's
  body, very frail, quite still. He cried to her, he shook her, he stood
  weeping.</p>

  <p>He talked to her, his voice a little insane, trying to make her understand
  that he had loved her and had left her here only for her safety&mdash;</p>

  <p>There was rum in the kitchen, and he went out to gulp down raw full
  glasses. They did not affect him.</p>

  <p>By evening he strode to the garden, the high and windy garden looking
  toward the sea, and dug a deep pit. He lifted her light stiff body, kissed
  it, and laid it in the pit. All night he wandered. When he came back to the
  house and saw the row of her little dresses with the lines of her soft body
  in them, he was terrified.</p>

  <p>Then he went to pieces.</p>

  <p>He gave up Penrith Lodge, left Twyford's, and moved into a room behind the
  Surgeon General's office. Beside his cot there was always a bottle.</p>

  <p>Because death had for the first time been brought to him, he raged, "Oh,
  damn experimentation!" and, despite Stokes's dismay, he gave the phage to
  everyone who asked.</p>

  <p>Only in St. Swithin's, since there his experiment was so excellently
  begun, did some remnant of honor keep him from distributing the phage
  universally; but the conduct of this experiment he turned over to Stokes.</p>

  <p>Stokes saw that he was a little mad, but only once, when Martin snarled,
  "What do I care for your science?" did he try to hold Martin to his test.</p>

  <p>Stokes himself, with Twyford, carried on the experiment and kept the notes
  Martin should have kept. By evening, after working fourteen or fifteen hours
  since dawn, Stokes would hasten to St. Swithin's by motor-cycle&mdash;he
  hated the joggling and the lack of dignity and he found it somewhat dangerous
  to take curving hill-roads at sixty miles an hour, but this was the quickest
  way, and till midnight he conferred with Twyford, gave him orders for the
  next day, arranged his clumsy annotations, and marveled at his grim
  meekness.</p>

  <p>Meantime, all day, Martin injected a line of frightened citizens, in the
  Surgeon General's office in Blackwater. Stokes begged him at least to turn
  the work over to another doctor and take what interest he could in St.
  Swithin's, but Martin had a bitter satisfaction in throwing away all his
  significance, in helping to wreck his own purposes.</p>

  <p>With a nurse for assistant, he stood in the bare office. File on file of
  people, black, white, Hindu, stood in an agitated cue a block long, ten deep,
  waiting dumbly, as for death. They crept up to the nurse beside Martin and in
  embarrassment exposed their arms, which she scrubbed with soap and water and
  dabbed with alcohol before passing them on to him. He brusquely pinched up
  the skin of the upper arm and jabbed it with the needle of the syringe,
  cursing at them for jerking, never seeing their individual faces. As they
  left him they fluttered with gratitude&mdash;"Oh, may God bless you,
  Doctor!"&mdash;but he did not hear.</p>

  <p>Sometimes Stokes was there, looking anxious, particularly when in the
  queue he saw plantation-hands from St. Swithin's, who were supposed to remain
  in their parish under strict control, to test the value of the phage.
  Sometimes Sir Robert Fairlamb came down to beam and gurgle and offer his
  aid...Lady Fairlamb had been injected first of all, and next to her a
  tattered kitchen wench, profuse with Hallelujah's.</p>

  <p>After a fortnight when he was tired of the drama, he had four doctors
  making the injections, while he manufactured phage.</p>

  <p>But by night Martin sat alone, tousled, drinking steadily, living on
  whisky and hate, freeing his soul and dissolving his body by hatred as once
  hermits dissolved theirs by ecstasy. His life was as unreal as the nights of
  an old drunkard. He had an advantage over normal cautious humanity in not
  caring whether he lived or died, he who sat with the dead, talking to Leora
  and Sondelius, to Ira Hinkley and Oliver Marchand, to Inchcape Jones and a
  shadowy horde of blackmen with lifted appealing hands.</p>

  <p>After Leora's death he had returned to Twyford's but once, to fetch his
  baggage, and he had not seen Joyce Lanyon. He hated her. He swore that it was
  not her presence which had kept him from returning earlier to Leora, but he
  was aware that while he had been chattering with Joyce, Leora had been
  dying.</p>

  <p>"Damn' glib society climber! Thank God I'll never see <i>her</i>
  again!"</p>

  <p>He sat on the edge of his cot, in the constricted and airless room, his
  hair ruffled, his eyes blotched with red, a stray alley kitten, which he
  esteemed his only friend, asleep on his pillow. At a knock he muttered, "I
  can't talk to Stokes now. Let him do his own experiments. Sick of
  experiments!"</p>

  <p>Sulkily, "Oh, come in!"</p>

  <p>The door opened on Joyce Lanyon, cool, trim, sure.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" he grunted.</p>

  <p>She stared at him; she shut the door; silently she straightened the litter
  of food, papers, and instruments on his table. She coaxed the indignant
  kitten to a mat, patted the pillow, and sat by him on the frowsy cot.
  Then:</p>

  <p>"Please! I know what's happened. Cecil is in town for an hour and I wanted
  to bring&mdash;Won't it comfort you a little if you know how fond we are of
  you? Won't you let me offer you friendship?"</p>

  <p>"I don't want anybody's friendship. I haven't any friends!"</p>

  <p>He sat dumb, her hand on his, but when she was gone he felt a shiver of
  new courage.</p>

  <p>He could not get himself to give up his reliance on whisky, and he could
  see no way of discontinuing the phage-injection of all who came begging for
  it, but he turned both injection and manufacture over to others, and went
  back to the most rigid observation of his experiment in St.
  Swithin's...blotted as it now was by the unphaged portion of the parish going
  in to Blackwater to receive the phage.</p>

  <p>He did not see Joyce. He lived at the almshouse, but most evenings now he
  was sober.</p><br>

  <h3>VI.</h3>

  <p class="first">The gospel of rat-extermination had spread through the
  island; everybody from five-year-old to hobbling grandam was out shooting
  rats and ground squirrels. Whether from phage or rat-killing or Providence,
  the epidemic paused, and six months after Martin's coming, when the West
  Indian May was broiling and the season of hurricanes was threatened, the
  plague had almost vanished and the quarantine was lifted.</p>

  <p>St. Hubert felt safe in its kitchens and shops, and amid the roaring
  spring the island rejoiced as a sick man first delivered from pain rejoices
  at merely living and being at peace.</p>

  <p>That chaffering should be abusive and loud in the public market, that
  lovers should stroll unconscious of all save themselves, that loafers should
  tell stories and drink long drinks at the Ice House, that old men should
  squat cackling in the shade of the mangoes, that congregations should sing
  together to the Lord&mdash;this was no longer ordinary to them nor stupid,
  but the bliss of paradise.</p>

  <p>They made a festival of the first steamer's leaving. White and black,
  Hindu and Chink and Caribbee, they crowded the wharf, shouting, waving
  scarfs, trying not to weep at the feeble piping of what was left of the
  Blackwater Gold Medal Band; and as the steamer, the St. Ia of the McGurk
  Line, was warped out, with her captain at the rail of the bridge, very
  straight, saluting them with a flourish but his eyes so wet that he could not
  see the harbor, they felt that they were no longer jailed lepers but a part
  of the free world.</p>

  <p>On the steamer Joyce Lanyon sailed. Martin said good-by to her at the
  wharf.</p>

  <p>Strong of hand, almost as tall as he, she looked at him without flutter,
  and rejoiced, "You've come through. So have I. Both of us have been mad,
  trapped here the way we've been. I don't suppose I helped you, but I did try.
  You see, I'd never been trained in reality. You trained me. Good-by."</p>

  <p>"Mayn't I come to see you in New York?"</p>

  <p>"If you'd really like to."</p>

  <p>She was gone, yet she had never been so much with him as through that
  tedious hour when the steamer was lost beyond the horizon, a line edged with
  silver wire. But that night, in panic, he fled up to Penrith Lodge and buried
  his cheek in the damp soil above the Leora with whom he had never had to
  fence and explain, to whom he had never needed to say, "Mayn't I come to see
  you?"</p>

  <p>But Leora, cold in her last bed, unsmiling, did not answer him nor comfort
  him.</p><br>

  <h3>VII.</h3>

  <p class="first">Before Martin took leave he had to assemble the notes of his
  phage experiment; add the observation of Stokes and Twyford to his own first
  precise figures.</p>

  <p>As the giver of phage to some thousands of frightened islanders, he had
  become a dignitary. He was called, in the first issue of the Blackwater
  Guardian after the quarantine was raised, "the savior of all our lives." He
  was the universal hero. If Sondelius had helped to cleanse them, had
  Sondelius not been his lieutenant? If it was the intervention of the Lord, as
  the earnest old Negro who succeeded Ira Hinkley in the chapels of the
  Sanctification Brotherhood insisted, had not the Lord surely sent him?</p>

  <p>No one heeded a wry Scotch doctor, diligent but undramatic through the
  epidemic, who hinted that plagues have been known to slacken and cease
  without phage.</p>

  <p>When Martin was completing his notes he had a letter from the McGurk
  Institute, signed by Rippleton Holabird.</p>

  <p>Holabird wrote that Gottlieb was "feeling seedy," that he had resigned the
  Directorship, suspended his own experimentation, and was now at home,
  resting. Holabird himself had been appointed Acting Director of the
  Institute, and as such he chanted:</p><br>

  <p class="typewriter">The reports of your work in the letters from Mr.
  McGurk's agents which the quarantine authorities have permitted to get
  through to us apprize us far more than does your own modest report what a
  really sensational success you have had. You have done what few other men
  living could do, both established the value of bacteriophage in plague by
  tests on a large scale, and saved most of the unfortunate population. The
  Board of Trustees and I are properly appreciative of the glory which you have
  added, and still more will add when your report is published, to the name of
  McGurk institute, and we are thinking, now that we may for some months be
  unable to have your titular chief, Dr. Gottlieb, working with us, of
  establishing a separate Department, with you as its head.</p><br>

  <p>"Established the value&mdash;rats! I about half made the tests," sighed
  Martin, and: "Department! I've given too many orders here. Sick of authority.
  I want to get back to my lab and start all over again."</p>

  <p>It came to him that now he would probably have ten thousand a year...Leora
  would have enjoyed small extravagant dinners.</p>

  <p>Though he had watched Gottlieb declining, it was a shock that he could be
  so unwell as to drop his work even for a few months.</p>

  <p>He forgot his own self as it came to him that in giving up his experiment,
  playing the savior, he had been a traitor to Gottlieb and all that Gottlieb
  represented. When he returned to New York he would have to call on the old
  man and admit to him, to those sunken relentless eyes, that he did not have
  complete proof of the value of the phage.</p>

  <p>If he could have run to Leora with his ten thousand a year&mdash;</p><br>

  <h3>VIII.</h3>

  <p class="first">He left St. Hubert three weeks after Joyce Lanyon.</p>

  <p>The evening before his sailing, a great dinner with Sir Robert Fairlamb in
  the chair was given to him and to Stokes. While Sir Robert ruddily blurted
  compliments and Kellett tried to explain things, and all of them drank to
  him, standing, after the toast to the King, Martin sat lonely, considering
  that tomorrow he would leave these trusting eyes and face the harsh demands
  of Gottlieb, of Terry Wickett.</p>

  <p>The more they shouted his glory, the more he thought about what unknown,
  tight-minded scientists in distant laboratories would say of a man who had
  had his chance and cast it away. The more they called him the giver of life,
  the more he felt himself disgraced and a traitor; and as he looked at Stokes
  he saw in his regard a pity worse than condemnation.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch36"
     name="ch36">CHAPTER XXXVI.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">It happened that Martin returned to New York, as he had
  come, on the St. Buryan. The ship was haunted with the phantoms of Leora
  dreaming, of Sondelius shouting on the bridge.</p>

  <p>And on the St. Buryan was the country-club Miss Gwilliam who had offended
  Sondelius.</p>

  <p>She had spent the winter importantly making notes on native music in
  Trinidad and Caracas; at least in planning to make notes. She saw Martin come
  aboard at Blackwater, and pertly noted the friends who saw him off&mdash;two
  Englishmen, one puffy, one rangy, and a dry-looking Scotsman.</p>

  <p>"Your friends all seem to be British," she enlightened him, when she had
  claimed him as an old friend.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"You've spent the winter here."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Hard luck to be caught by the quarantine. But I <i>told</i> you you were
  silly to go ashore! You must have managed to pick up quite a little money
  practicing. But it must have been unpleasant, really."</p>

  <p>"Ye&mdash;es, I suppose it was."</p>

  <p>"I told you it would be! You ought to have come on to Trinidad. Such a
  fascinating island! And tell me, how is the Roughneck?"</p>

  <p>"Who?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you know&mdash;that funny Swede that used to dance and
  everything."</p>

  <p>"He is dead."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I <i>am</i> sorry. You know, no matter what the others said, I never
  thought he was so bad. I'm sure he had quite a nice cultured mind, when he
  wasn't carousing around. Your wife isn't with you, is she?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;she isn't with me. I must go down and unpack now." Miss Gwilliam
  looked after him with an expression which said that the least people could do
  was to learn some manners.</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">With the heat and the threat of hurricanes, there were few
  first-class passengers on the St. Buryan, and most of these did not count,
  because they were not jolly, decent Yankee tourists but merely South
  Americans. As tourists do when their minds have been broadened and enriched
  by travel, when they return to New Jersey or Wisconsin with the credit of
  having spent a whole six months in the West Indies and South America, the
  respectable remnant studied one another fastidiously, and noted the slim pale
  man who seemed so restless, who all day trudged round the deck, who after
  midnight was seen standing by himself at the rail.</p>

  <p>"That guy looks awful' restless to me!" said Mr. S. Sanborn Hibble of
  Detroit to the charming Mrs. Dawson of Memphis, and she answered, with the
  wit which made her so popular wherever she went, "Yes, don't he. I reckon he
  must be in love!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know him!" said Miss Gwilliam. "He and his wife were on the St.
  Buryan when I came down. She's in New York now. He's some kind of a
  doctor&mdash;not awful' successful I don't believe. Just between ourselves, I
  don't think much of him or of her either. They sat and looked stupid all the
  way down."</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">Martin was itching to get his fingers on his test-tubes. He
  knew, as once he had guessed, that he hated administration and Large
  Affairs.</p>

  <p>As he tramped the deck, his head cleared and he was himself. Angrily he
  pictured the critics who would soon be pecking at whatever final report he
  might make. For a time he hated the criticism of his fellow laboratory-grinds
  as he had hated their competition; he hated the need of forever looking over
  his shoulder at pursuers. But on a night when he stood at the rail for hours,
  he admitted that he was afraid of their criticism, and afraid because his
  experiment had so many loopholes. He hurled overboard all the polemics with
  which he had protected himself: "Men who never have had the experience of
  trying, in the midst of an epidemic, to remain calm and keep experimental
  conditions, do not realize in the security of their laboratories what one has
  to contend with."</p>

  <p>Constant criticism was good, if only it was not spiteful, jealous,
  petty&mdash;</p>

  <p>No, even then it might be good! Some men had to be what easy-going workers
  called "spiteful." To them the joyous spite of crushing the almost-good was
  more natural than creation. Why should a great house-wrecker, who could clear
  the cumbered ground, be set at trying to lay brick?</p>

  <p>"All right!" he rejoiced. "Let 'em come! Maybe I'll anticipate 'em and
  publish a roast of my own work. I have got something, from the St. Swithin
  test, even if I did let things slide for a while. I'll take my tables to a
  biometrician. He may rip 'em up. Good! What's left, I'll publish."</p>

  <p>He went to bed feeling that he could face the eyes of Gottlieb and Terry,
  and for the first time in weeks he slept without terror.</p><br>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">At the pier in Brooklyn, to the astonishment and slight
  indignation of Miss Gwilliam, Mr. S. Sanborn Hibble, and Mrs. Dawson, Martin
  was greeted by reporters who agreeably though vaguely desired to know what
  were these remarkable things he had been doing to some disease or other, in
  some island some place.</p>

  <p>He was rescued from them by Rippleton Holabird, who burst through them
  with his hands out, crying, "Oh, my dear fellow! We know all that's happened.
  We grieve for you so, and we're so glad you were spared to come back to
  us."</p>

  <p>Whatever Martin might, under the shadow of Max Gottlieb, have said about
  Holabird, now he wrung his hands and muttered, "It's good to be home."</p>

  <p>Holabird (he was wearing a blue shirt with a starched blue collar, like an
  actor) could not wait till Martin's baggage had gone through the customs. He
  had to return to his duties as Acting Director of the Institute. He delayed
  only to hint that the Board of Trustees were going to make him full Director,
  and that certainly, my dear fellow, he would see that Martin had the credit
  and the reward he deserved.</p>

  <p>When Holabird was gone, driving away in his neat coupe (he often explained
  that his wife and he could afford a chauffeur, but they preferred to spend
  the money on other things), Martin was conscious of Terry Wickett, leaning
  against a gnawed wooden pillar of the wharf-house, as though he had been
  there for hours.</p>

  <p>Terry strolled up and snorted, "Hello, Slim. All O.K.? Lez shoot the stuff
  through the customs. Great pleasure to see the Director and you kissing."</p>

  <p>As they drove through the summer-walled streets of Brooklyn, Martin
  inquired, "How's Holabird working out as Director? And how is Gottlieb?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, the Holy Wren is no worse than Tubbs; he's even politer and more
  ignorant...Me, you watch me! One of these days I'm going off to the
  woods&mdash;got a shack in Vermont&mdash;going to work there without having
  to produce results for the Director! They've stuck me in the Department of
  Biochemistry. And Gottlieb&mdash;" Terry's voice became anxious. "I guess
  he's pretty shaky&mdash;They've pensioned him off. Now look, Slim: I hear
  you're going to be a gilded department-head, and I'll never be anything but
  an associate member. Are you going on with me, or are you going to be one of
  the Holy Wren's pets&mdash;hero-scientist?"</p>

  <p>"I'm with you, Terry, you old grouch." Martin dropped the cynicism which
  had always seemed proper between him and Terry. "I haven't got anybody else.
  Leora and Gustaf are gone and now maybe Gottlieb. You and I have got to stick
  together!"</p>

  <p>"It's a go!"</p>

  <p>They shook hands, they coughed gruffly, and talked of straw hats.</p><br>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="first">When Martin entered the Institute, his colleagues galloped
  up to shake hands and to exclaim, and if their praise was flustering, there
  is no time at which one can stomach so much of it as at home-coming.</p>

  <p>Sir Robert Fairlamb had written to the Institute a letter glorifying him.
  The letter arrived on the same boat with Martin, and next day Holabird gave
  it out to the press.</p>

  <p>The reporters, who had been only a little interested at his landing, came
  around for interviews, and while Martin was sulky and jerky Holabird took
  them in hand, so that the papers were able to announce that America, which
  was always rescuing the world from something or other, had gone and done it
  again. It was spread in the prints that Dr. Martin Arrowsmith was not only a
  powerful witch-doctor and possibly something of a laboratory-hand, but also a
  ferocious rat-killer, village-burner, Special Board addresser, and snatcher
  from death. There was at the time, in certain places, a doubt as to how
  benevolent the United States had been to its Little Brothers&mdash;Mexico,
  Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua&mdash;and the editors and politicians were grateful to
  Martin for this proof of their sacrifice and tender watchfulness.</p>

  <p>He had letters from the Public Health service; from an enterprising
  Midwestern college which desired to make him a Doctor of Civil Law; from
  medical schools and societies which begged him to address them. Editorials on
  his work appeared in the medical journals and the newspapers; and Congressman
  Almus Pickerbaugh telegraphed him from Washington in what the Congressman may
  conceivably have regarded as verse: "They got to go some to get ahead of
  fellows that come from old Nautilus." And he was again invited to dinner at
  the McGurks', not by Capitola but by Ross McGurk, whose name had never had
  such a whitewashing.</p>

  <p>He refused all invitations to speak, and the urgent organizations which
  had invited him responded with meekness that they understood how
  intimidatingly busy Dr. Arrowsmith was, and if he ever <i>could</i> find the
  time, they would be most highly honored&mdash;</p>

  <p>Rippleton Holabird was elected full Director now, in succession to
  Gottlieb, and he sought to use Martin as the prize exhibit of the Institute.
  He brought all the visiting dignitaries, all the foreign Men of Measured
  Merriment, in to see him, and they looked pleased and tried to think up
  questions. Then Martin was made head of the new Department of Microbiology at
  twice his old salary.</p>

  <p>He never did learn what was the difference between microbiology and
  bacteriology. But none of his glorification could he resist. He was still too
  dazed&mdash;he was more dazed when he had seen Max Gottlieb.</p><br>

  <h3>VI.</h3>

  <p class="first">The morning after his return he had telephoned to Gottlieb's
  flat, had spoken to Miriam and received permission to call in the late
  afternoon.</p>

  <p>All the way uptown he could hear Gottlieb saying, "You were my son! I gave
  you eferyt'ing I knew of truth and honor, and you haf betrayed me. Get out of
  my sight!"</p>

  <p>Miriam met him in the hall, fretting, "I don't know if I should have let
  you come at all, Doctor."</p>

  <p>"Why? Isn't he well enough to see people?"</p>

  <p>"It isn't that. He doesn't really seem ill, except that he's feeble, but
  he doesn't know anyone. The doctors say it's senile dementia. His memory is
  gone. And he's just suddenly forgotten all his English. He can only speak
  German, and I can't speak it, hardly at all. If I'd only studied it, instead
  of music! But perhaps it may do him good to have you here. He was always so
  fond of you. You don't know how he talked of you and the splendid experiment
  you've been doing in St. Hubert."</p>

  <p>"Well, I&mdash;" He could find nothing to say.</p>

  <p>Miriam led him into a room whose walls were dark with books. Gottlieb was
  sunk in a worn chair, his thin hand lax on the arm.</p>

  <p>"Doctor, it's Arrowsmith, just got back!" Martin mumbled.</p>

  <p>The old man looked as though he half understood; he peered at him, then
  shook his head and whimpered, "Versteh' nicht." His arrogant eyes were
  clouded with ungovernable slow tears.</p>

  <p>Martin understood that never could he be punished now and cleansed.
  Gottlieb had sunk into his darkness still trusting him.</p><br>

  <h3>VII.</h3>

  <p class="first">Martin closed his flat&mdash;their flat&mdash;with a cold
  swift fury, lest he yield to his misery in finding among Leora's possessions
  a thousand fragments which brought her back: the frock she had bought for
  Capitola McGurk's dinner, a petrified chocolate she had hidden away to munch
  illegally by night, a memorandum, "Get almonds for Sandy." He took a grimly
  impersonal room in a hotel, and sunk himself in work. There was nothing for
  him but work and the harsh friendship of Terry Wickett.</p>

  <p>His first task was to check the statistics of his St. Swithin treatments
  and the new figures still coming in from Stokes. Some of them were shaky,
  some suggested that the value of phage certainly had been confirmed, but
  there was nothing final. He took his figures to Raymond Pearl the
  biometrician, who thought less of them than did Martin himself.</p>

  <p>He had already made a report of his work to the Director and the Trustees
  of the Institute, with no conclusion except "the results await statistical
  analysis and should have this before they are published." But Holabird had
  run wild, the newspapers had reported wonders, and in on Martin poured
  demands that he send out phage; inquiries as to whether he did not have a
  phage for tuberculosis, for syphilis; offers that he take charge of this
  epidemic and that.</p>

  <p>Pearl had pointed out that his agreeable results in first phaging the
  whole of Carib village must be questioned, because it was possible that when
  he began, the curve of the disease had already passed its peak. With this and
  the other complications, viewing his hot work in St. Hubert as coldly as
  though it were the pretense of a man whom he had never seen, Martin decided
  that he had no adequate proof, and strode in to see the Director.</p>

  <p>Holabird was gentle and pretty, but he sighed that if this conclusion were
  published, he would have to take back all the things he had said about the
  magnificence which, presumably, he had inspired his subordinate to
  accomplish. He was gentle and pretty, but firm; Martin was to suppress
  (Holabird did not say "suppress"&mdash;he said "leave to me for further
  consideration") the real statistical results, and issue the report with an
  ambiguous summary.</p>

  <p>Martin was furious, Holabird delicately relentless. Martin hastened to
  Terry, declaring that he would resign&mdash;would denounce&mdash;would
  expose&mdash;Yes! He would! He no longer had to support Leora. He'd work as a
  drug-clerk. He'd go back right now and tell the Holy Wren&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Hey! Slim! Wait a minute! Hold your horses!" observed Terry. "Just get
  along with Holy for a while, and we'll work out something we can do together
  and be independent. Meanwhile you have got your lab here, and you still have
  some physical chemistry to learn! And, uh&mdash;Slim, I haven't said anything
  about your St. Hubert stuff, but you know and I know you bunged it up badly.
  Can you come into court with clean hands, if you're going to indict the Holy
  One? Though I do agree that aside from being a dirty, lying, social-climbing,
  sneaking, power-grabbing hypocrite, he's all right. Hold on. We'll fix up
  something. Why, son, we've just been learning our science; we're just
  beginning to work."</p>

  <p>Then Holabird published officially, under the Institute's seal, Martin's
  original report to the Trustees, with such quaint revisions as a change of
  "the results should have analysis" to "while statistical analysis would seem
  desirable, it is evident that this new treatment has accomplished all that
  had been hoped."</p>

  <p>Again Martin went mad, again Terry calmed him; and with a hard fury unlike
  his eagerness of the days when he had known that Leora was waiting for him he
  resumed his physical chemistry.</p>

  <p>He learned the involved mysteries of freezing-point determinations,
  osmotic pressure determinations, and tried to apply Northrop's
  generalizations on enzymes to the study of phage.</p>

  <p>He became absorbed in mathematical laws which strangely predicted natural
  phenomena; his world was cold, exact, austerely materialistic, bitter to
  those who founded their logic on impressions. He was daily more scornful
  toward the counters of paving stones, the renamers of species, the compilers
  of irrelevant data. In his absorption the pleasant seasons passed unseen.</p>

  <p>Once he raised his head in astonishment to perceive that it was spring;
  once Terry and he tramped two hundred miles through the Pennsylvania hills,
  by summer roads; but it seemed only a day later when it was Christmas, and
  Holabird was being ever so jolly and yuley about the Institute.</p>

  <p>The absence of Gottlieb may have been good for Martin, since he no longer
  turned to the master for solutions in tough queries. When he took up
  diffusion problems, he began to develop his own apparatus, and whether it was
  from inborn ingenuity or merely from a fury of labor, he was so competent
  that he won from Terry the almost overwhelming praise: "Why, that's not so
  darn' bad, Slim!"</p>

  <p>The sureness to which Max Gottlieb seems to have been born came to Martin
  slowly, after many stumblings, but it came. He desired a perfection of
  technique in the quest for absolute and provable fact; he desired as greatly
  as any Pater to "burn with a hard gem-like flame," and he desired not to have
  ease and repute in the market-place, but rather to keep free of those
  follies, lest they confuse him and make him soft.</p>

  <p>Holabird was as much bewildered as Tubbs would have been by the
  ramifications of Martin's work. What did he think he was anyway&mdash;a
  bacteriologist or a bio-physicist? But Holabird was won by the scientific
  world's reception of Martin's first important paper, on the effect of X-rays,
  gamma rays, and beta rays on the anti-Shiga phage. It was praised in Paris
  and Brussels and Cambridge as much as in New York, for its insight and for
  "the clarity and to perhaps be unscientifically enthusiastic, the sheer
  delight and style of its presentation," as Professor Berkeley Wurtz put it;
  which may be indicated by quoting the first paragraph of the paper:</p><br>

  <p class="typewriter">In a preliminary publication, I have reported a marked
  qualitative destructive effect of the radiations from radium emanations on
  Bacteriophage-anti-Shiga. In the present paper it is shown that X-rays, gamma
  rays, and beta rays produce identical inactivating effects on this
  bacteriophage. Furthermore, a quantitative relation is demonstrated to exist
  between this inactivation and the radiations that produce it. The results
  obtained from this quantitative study permit the statement that the
  percentage of inactivation, as measured by determining the units of
  bacteriophage remaining after irradiation by gamma and beta rays of a
  suspension of fixed virulence, is a function of the two variables,
  nillicuries and hours. The following equation accounts quantitatively for the
  experimental results obtained:</p>

  <p class="typewriter"
     style="text-align:center">u0<br>
  &lambda; log e &mdash;<br>
  u<br>
  K=--------------------<br>
  EO (&epsilon;-&lambda; t1)</p><br>

  <p>When Director Holabird saw the paper&mdash;Yeo was vicious enough to take
  it in and ask his opinion&mdash;he said, "Splendid, oh, I say, simply
  splendid! I've just had the chance to skim through it, old boy, but I shall
  certainly read it carefully, the first free moment I have."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch37"
     name="ch37">CHAPTER XXXVII.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">Martin did not see Joyce Lanyon for weeks after his return
  to New York. Once she invited him to dinner, but he could not come, and he
  did not hear from her again.</p>

  <p>His absorption in osmotic pressure determinations did not content him when
  he sat in his prim hotel room and was reduced from Dr. Arrowsmith to a man
  who had no one to talk to. He remembered how they had sat by the lagoon in
  the tepid twilight; he telephoned asking whether he might come in for
  tea.</p>

  <p>He knew in an unformulated way that Joyce was rich, but after seeing her
  in gingham, cooking in the kitchen of St. Swithin's almshouse, he did not
  grasp her position; and he was uncomfortable when, feeling dusty from the
  laboratory, he came to her great house and found her the soft-voiced mistress
  of many servants. Hers was a palace, and palaces, whether they are such very
  little ones as Joyce's, with its eighteen rooms, or Buckingham or vast
  Fontainebleau, are all alike; they are choked with the superfluities of
  pride, they are so complete that one does not remember small endearing
  charms, they are indistinguishable in their common feeling of polite and
  uneasy grandeur, they are therefore altogether tedious.</p>

  <p>But amid the pretentious splendor which Roger Lanyon had accumulated,
  Joyce was not tedious. It is to be suspected that she enjoyed showing Martin
  what she really was, by producing footmen and too many kinds of sandwiches,
  and by boasting, "Oh, I never do know what they're going to give me for
  tea."</p>

  <p>But she had welcomed him, crying, "You look so much better. I'm
  frightfully glad. Are you still my brother? I was a good cook at the
  almshouse, wasn't I!"</p>

  <p>Had he been suave then and witty, she would not have been greatly
  interested. She knew too many men who were witty and well-bred, ivory smooth
  and competent to help her spend the four or five million dollars with which
  she was burdened. But Martin was at once a scholar who made osmotic pressure
  determinations almost interesting, a taut swift man whom she could fancy
  running or making love, and a lonely youngster who naively believed that here
  in her soft security she was still the girl who had sat with him by the
  lagoon, still the courageous woman who had come to him in a drunken room at
  Blackwater.</p>

  <p>Joyce Lanyon knew how to make men talk. Thanks more to her than to his own
  articulateness, he made living the Institute, the members, their feuds, and
  the drama of coursing on the trail of a discovery.</p>

  <p>Her easy life here had seemed tasteless after the risks of St. Hubert, and
  in his contempt for ease and rewards she found exhilaration.</p>

  <p>He came now and then to tea, to dinner; he learned the ways of her house,
  her servants, the more nearly intelligent of her friends. He liked&mdash;and
  possibly he was liked by&mdash;some of them. With one friend of hers Martin
  had a state of undeclared war. This was Latham Ireland, an achingly
  well-dressed man of fifty, a competent lawyer who was fond of standing in
  front of fireplaces and being quietly clever. He fascinated Joyce by telling
  her that she was subtle, then telling her what she was being subtle
  about.</p>

  <p>Martin hated him.</p>

  <p>In midsummer Martin was invited for a week-end at Joyce's vast blossom-hid
  country house at Greenwich. She was half apologetic for its luxury; he was
  altogether unhappy.</p>

  <p>The strain of considering clothes; of galloping out to buy white trousers
  when he wanted to watch the test-tubes in the constant-temperature bath, of
  trying to look easy in the limousine which met him at the station, and of
  deciding which servants to tip and how much and when, was dismaying to a
  simple man. He felt rustic when, after he had blurted, "Just a minute til I
  go up and unpack my suit-case," she said gently, "Oh, that will have been
  done for you."</p>

  <p>He discovered that a valet had laid out for him to put on, that first
  evening, all the small store of underclothes he had brought, and had squeezed
  out on his brush a ribbon of toothpaste.</p>

  <p>He sat on the edge of his bed, groaning, "This is too rich for my
  blood!"</p>

  <p>He hated and feared that valet, who kept stealing his clothes, putting
  them in places where they could not be found, then popping in menacingly when
  Martin was sneaking about the enormous room looking for them.</p>

  <p>But his chief unhappiness was that there was nothing to do. He had no
  sport but tennis, at which he was too rusty to play with these chattering
  unidentified people who filled the house and, apparently with perfect
  willingness, worked at golf and bridge. He had met but few of the friends of
  whom they talked. They said, "You know dear old R. G.," and he said, "Oh,
  <i>yes</i>," but he never did know dear old R. G.</p>

  <p>Joyce was as busily amiable as when they were alone at tea, and she found
  for him a weedy flapper whose tennis was worse than his own, but she had
  twenty guests&mdash;forty at Sunday lunch&mdash;and he gave up certain
  agreeable notions of walking with her in fresh lanes and, after excitedly
  saying this and that, perhaps kissing her. He had one moment with her. As he
  was going, she ordered, "Come here, Martin," and led him apart.</p>

  <p>"You haven't really enjoyed it."</p>

  <p>"Why, sure, course I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course you haven't! And you despise us, rather, and perhaps you're
  partly right. I do like pretty people and gracious manners and good games,
  but I suppose they seem piffling after nights in a laboratory."</p>

  <p>"No, I like 'em too. In a way. I like to look at beautiful women&mdash;at
  you! But&mdash;Oh, darn it, Joyce, I'm not up to it. I've always been poor
  and horribly busy. I haven't learned your games."</p>

  <p>"But, Martin, you could, with the intensity you put into everything."</p>

  <p>"Even getting drunk in Blackwater!"</p>

  <p>"And I hope in New York, too! Dear Roger, he did have such an innocent,
  satisfying time getting drunk at class-dinners! But I mean: if you went at
  it, you could play bridge and golf&mdash;and talking&mdash;better than any of
  them. If you only knew how frightfully recent most of the ducal class in
  America are! And Martin: wouldn't it be good for you? Wouldn't you work all
  the better if you got away from your logarithmic tables now and then? And are
  you going to admit there's anything you can't conquer?"</p>

  <p>"No, I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Will you come to dinner on Tuesday week, just us two, and we'll fight it
  out?"</p>

  <p>"Be glad to."</p>

  <p>For a number of hours, on the train to Terry Wickett's vacation place in
  the Vermont hills, Martin was convinced that he loved Joyce Lanyon, and that
  he was going to attack the art of being amusing as he had attacked physical
  chemistry. Ardently, and quite humorlessly, as he sat stiffly in a stale
  Pullman chaircar with his feet up on his suit-case, he pictured himself
  wearing a club-tie (presumably first acquiring the tie and the club), playing
  golf in plus-fours, and being entertaining about dear old R. G. and
  incredibly witty about dear old Latham Ireland's aged Rolls-Royce.</p>

  <p>But these ambitions he forgot as he came to Terry's proud proprietary
  shanty, by a lake among oaks and maples, and heard Terry's real theories of
  the decomposition of quinine derivatives.</p>

  <p>Being perhaps the least sentimental of human beings, Terry had named his
  place "Birdies' Rest." He owned five acres of woodland, two miles from a
  railroad station. His shanty was a two-room affair of logs, with bunks for
  beds and oilcloth for table-linen.</p>

  <p>"Here's the layout, Slim," said Terry. "Some day I'm going to figure out a
  way of making a lab here pay, by manufacturing sera or something, and I'll
  put up a couple more buildings on the flat by the lake, and have one
  absolutely independent place for science&mdash;two hours a day on the
  commercial end, and say about six for sleeping and a couple for feeding and
  telling dirty stories. That leaves&mdash;two and six and two make ten, if I'm
  any authority on higher math&mdash;that leaves fourteen hours a day for
  research (except when you got something special on), with no Director and no
  Society patrons and no Trustees that you've got to satisfy by making fool
  reports. Of course there won't be any scientific dinners with ladies in
  candy-box dresses, but I figure we'll be able to afford plenty of salt pork
  and corncob pipes, and your bed will be made perfectly&mdash;if you make it
  yourself. Huh? Lez go and have a swim."</p>

  <p>Martin returned to New York with the not very compatible plans of being
  the best-dressed golfer in Greenwich and of cooking beef-stew with Terry at
  Birdies' Rest.</p>

  <p>But the first of these was the more novel to him.</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">Joyce Lanyon was enjoying a conversion. Her St. Hubert
  experiences and her natural variability had caused her to be dissatisfied
  with Roger's fast-motoring set.</p>

  <p>She let the lady Maecenases of her acquaintance beguile her into several
  of their Causes, and she enjoyed them as she had enjoyed her active and
  entirely purposeless war work in 1917, for Joyce Lanyon was to some degree an
  Arranger, which was an epithet invented by Terry Wickett for Capitola
  McGurk.</p>

  <p>An Arranger and even an Improver was Joyce, but she was not a Capitola;
  she neither waved a feathered fan and spoke spaciously, nor did she take out
  her sex-passion in talking. She was fine and occasionally gorgeous, with
  tiger in her, though she was as far from perfumed-boudoir and black-lingerie
  passion as she was from Capitola's cooling staleness. Hers was sheer straight
  white silk and cherished skin.</p>

  <p>Behind all her reasons for valuing Martin was the fact that the only time
  in her life when she had felt useful and independent was when she had been an
  almshouse cook.</p>

  <p>She might have drifted on, in her world of drifters, but for the
  interposition of Latham Ireland, the lawyer-dilettante lover.</p>

  <p>"Joy," he observed, "there seems to be an astounding quantity of that Dr.
  Arrowsmith person about the place. As your benign uncle&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Latham, my sweet, I quite agree that Martin is too aggressive, thoroughly
  unlicked, very selfish, rather a prig, absolutely a pedant, and his shirts
  are atrocious. And I rather think I shall marry him. I almost think I love
  him!"</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't cyanide be a neater way of doing suicide?" said Latham
  Ireland.</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">What Martin felt for Joyce was what any widowed man of
  thirty-eight would feel for a young and pretty and well-spoken woman who was
  attentive to his wisdom. As to her wealth, there was no problem at all. He
  was no poor man marrying money! Why, he was making ten thousand a year, which
  was eight thousand more than he needed to live on!</p>

  <p>Occasionally he was suspicious of her dependence on luxury. With
  tremendous craft he demanded that instead of their dining in her Jacobean
  hall of state, she come with him on his own sort of party. She came, with
  enthusiasm. They went to abysmal Greenwich Village restaurants with candles,
  artistic waiters, and no food; or to Chinatown dives with food and nothing
  else. He even insisted on their taking the subway&mdash;though after dinner
  he usually forgot that he was being Spartan, and ordered a taxicab. She
  accepted it all without either wincing or too much gurgling.</p>

  <p>She played tennis with him in the court on her roof; she taught him
  bridge, which, with his concentration and his memory, he soon played better
  than she and enjoyed astonishingly; she persuaded him that he had a leg and
  would look well in golf clothes.</p>

  <p>He came to take her to dinner, on a serene autumn evening. He had a taxi
  waiting.</p>

  <p>"Why don't we stick to the subway?" she said.</p>

  <p>They were standing on her doorstep, in a blankly expensive and quite
  unromantic street off Fifth Avenue.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I hate the rotten subway as much as you do! Elbows in my stomach
  never did help me much to plan experiments. I expect when we're married I'll
  enjoy your limousine."</p>

  <p>"Is this a proposal? I'm not at all sure I'm going to marry you. Really,
  I'm <i>not!</i> You have no sense of ease!"</p>

  <p>They were married the following January, in St. George's Church, and
  Martin suffered almost as much over the flowers, the bishop, the relatives
  with high-pitched voices, and the top hat which Joyce had commanded, as he
  did over having Rippleton Holabird wring his hand with a look of, "At last,
  dear boy, you have come out of barbarism and become One of Us."</p>

  <p>Martin had asked Terry to be his best man. Terry had refused, and asserted
  that only with pain would he come to the wedding at all. The best man was Dr.
  William Smith, with his beard trimmed for the occasion, and distressing
  morning clothes and a topper which he had bought in London eleven years
  before, but both of them were safe in charge of a cousin of Joyce who was
  guaranteed to have extra handkerchiefs and to recognize the Wedding March. He
  had understood that Martin was Groton and Harvard, and when he discovered
  that he was Winnemac and nothing at all, he became suspicious.</p>

  <p>In their stateroom on the steamer Joyce murmured, "Dear, you were brave! I
  didn't know what a damn' fool that cousin of mine was. Kiss me!"</p>

  <p>Thenceforth...except for a dreadful second when Leora floated between
  them, eyes closed and hands crossed on her pale cold breast...they were happy
  and in each other found adventurous new ways.</p><br>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">For three months they wandered in Europe.</p>

  <p>On the first day Joyce had said, "Let's have this beastly money thing
  over. I should think you are the least mercenary of men. I've put ten
  thousand dollars to your credit in London&mdash;oh, yes, and fifty thousand
  in New York&mdash;and if you'd like, when you have to do things for me, I'd
  be glad if you'd draw on it. No! Wait! Can't you see how easy and decent I
  want to make it all? You won't hurt me to save your own
  self-respect?"</p><br>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="first">They really had, it seemed, to stay with the Principessa del
  Oltraggio (formerly Miss Lucy Deemy Bessy of Dayton), Madame des Basses Loges
  (Miss Brown of San Francisco), and the Countess of Marazion (who had been
  Mrs. Arthur Snaipe of Albany, and several things before that), but Joyce did
  go with him to see the great laboratories in London, Paris, Copenhagen. She
  swelled to perceive how Nobel-prize winners received Her Husband, knew of
  him, desired to be violent with him about phage, and showed him their work of
  years. Some of them were hasty and graceless, she thought. Her Man was
  prettier than any of them, and if she would but be patient with him, she
  could make him master polo and clothes and conversation...but of course go on
  with his science...a pity he could not have a knighthood, like one or two of
  the British scientists they met. But even in America there were honorary
  degrees...</p>

  <p>While she discovered and digested Science, Martin discovered
  Women.</p><br>

  <h3>VI.</h3>

  <p class="first">Aware only of Madeline Fox and Orchid Pickerbaugh, who were
  Nice American Girls, of soon-forgotten ladies of the night, and of Leora,
  who, in her indolence, her indifference to decoration and good fame, was
  neither woman nor wife but only her own self, Martin knew nothing whatever
  about Women. He had expected Leora to wait for him, to obey his wishes, to
  understand without his saying them all the flattering things he had planned
  to say. He was spoiled, and Joyce was not timorous about telling him so.</p>

  <p>It was not for her to sit beaming and wordless while he and his
  fellow-researchers arranged the world. With many jolts he perceived that even
  outside the bedroom he had to consider the fluctuations and variables of his
  wife, as A Woman, and sometimes as A Rich Woman.</p>

  <p>It was confusing to find that where Leora had acidly claimed sex-loyalty
  but had hummingly not cared in what manner he might say Good Morning, Joyce
  was indifferent as to how many women he might have fondled (so long as he did
  not insult her by making love to them in her presence) but did require him to
  say Good Morning as though he meant it. It was confusing to find how starkly
  she discriminated between his caresses when he was absorbed in her and his
  hasty interest when he wanted to go to sleep. She could, she said, kill a man
  who considered her merely convenient furniture, and she uncomfortably
  emphasized the "kill."</p>

  <p>She expected him to remember her birthday, her taste in wine, her liking
  for flowers, and her objection to viewing the process of shaving. She wanted
  a room to herself; she insisted that he knock before entering; and she
  demanded that he admire her hats.</p>

  <p>When he was so interested in the work at Pasteur Institute that he had a
  clerk telephone that he would not be able to meet her for dinner, she was
  tight-lipped with rage.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you got to expect that," he reflected, feeling that he was being
  tactful and patient and penetrating.</p>

  <p>It annoyed him, sometimes, that she would never impulsively start off on a
  walk with him. No matter how brief the jaunt, she must first go to her room
  for white gloves&mdash;placidly stand there drawing them on...And in London
  she made him buy spats...and even wear them.</p>

  <p>Joyce was not only an Arranger&mdash;she was a Loyalist. Like most
  American cosmopolites she revered the English peerage, adopted all their
  standards and beliefs&mdash;or what she considered their standards and
  beliefs&mdash;and treasured her encounters with them. Three and a half years
  after the War of 1914-18, she still said that she loathed all Germans, and
  the one complete quarrel between her and Martin occurred when he desired to
  see the laboratories in Berlin and Vienna.</p>

  <p>But for all their differences it was a romantic pilgrimage. They loved
  fearlessly; they tramped through the mountains and came back to revel in vast
  bathrooms and ingenious dinners; they idled before cafes, and save when he
  fell silent as he remembered how much Leora had wanted to sit before cafes in
  France, they showed each other all the eagernesses of their minds.</p>

  <p>Europe, her Europe, which she had always known and loved, Joyce offered to
  him on generous hands, and he who had ever been sensitive to warm colors and
  fine gestures&mdash;when he was not frenzied with work&mdash;was grateful to
  her and boyish with wonder. He believed that he was learning to take life
  easily and beautifully; he criticized Terry Wickett (but only to himself) for
  provincialism; and so in a golden leisure they came back to America and
  prohibition and politicians charging to protect the Steel Trust from the
  communists, to conversation about bridge and motors and to osmotic pressure
  determinations.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch38"
     name="ch38">CHAPTER XXXVIII.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">Director Rippleton Holabird had also married money, and
  whenever his colleagues hinted that since his first ardent work in physiology
  he had done nothing but arrange a few nicely selected flowers on the tables
  hewn out by other men, it was a satisfaction to him to observe that these
  rotters came down to the Institute by subway, while he drove elegantly in his
  coupe. But now Arrowsmith, once the poorest of them all, came by limousine
  with a chauffeur who touched his hat, and Holabird's coffee was salted.</p>

  <p>There was a simplicity in Martin, but it cannot be said that he did not
  lick his lips when Holabird mooned at the chauffeur.</p>

  <p>His triumph over Holabird was less than being able to entertain Angus Duer
  and his wife, on from Chicago; to introduce them to Director Holabird, to
  Salamon the king of surgeons, and to a medical baronet; and to have Angus
  gush, "Mart, do you mind my saying we're all awfully proud of you?
  Rouncefield was speaking to me about it the other day. 'It may be
  presumptuous,' he said, 'but I really feel that perhaps the training we tried
  to give Dr. Arrowsmith here in the Clinic did in some way contribute to his
  magnificent work in the West Indies and at McGurk.' What a lovely woman your
  wife is, old man! Do you suppose she'd mind telling Mrs. Duer where she got
  that frock?"</p>

  <p>Martin had heard about the superiority of poverty to luxury, but after the
  lunch-wagons of Mohalis, after twelve years of helping Leora check the
  laundry and worry about the price of steak, after a life of waiting in the
  slush for trolleys, it was not at all dismaying to have a valet who produced
  shirts automatically; not at all degrading to come to meals which were always
  interesting, and, in the discretion of his car, to lean an aching head
  against softness and think how clever he was.</p>

  <p>"You see, by having other people do the vulgar things for you, it saves
  your own energy for the things that only you can do," said Joyce.</p>

  <p>Martin agreed, then drove to Westchester for a lesson in golf.</p>

  <p>A week after their return from Europe, Joyce went with him to see
  Gottlieb. He fancied that Gottlieb came out of his brooding to smile on
  them.</p>

  <p>"After all," Martin considered, "the old man did like beautiful things. If
  he'd had the chance, he might've liked a big Establishment, too, maybe."</p>

  <p>Terry was surprisingly complaisant.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you, Slim&mdash;if you want to know. Personally I'd hate to
  have to live up to servants. But I'm getting old and wise. I figure that
  different folks like different things, and awful' few of 'em have the sense
  to come and ask me what they ought to like. But honest, Slim, I don't think
  I'll come to dinner. I've gone and bought a dress-suit&mdash;<i>bought</i>
  it! got it in my room&mdash;damn' landlady keeps filling it with
  moth-balls&mdash;but I don't think I could stand listening to Latham Ireland
  being clever."</p>

  <p>It was, however, Rippleton Holabird's attitude which most concerned
  Martin, for Holabird did not let him forget that unless he desired to drift
  off and be merely a ghostly Rich Woman's husband, he would do well to
  remember who was Director.</p>

  <p>Along with the endearing manners which he preserved for Ross McGurk,
  Holabird had developed the remoteness, the inhuman quiet courtesy, of the Man
  of Affairs, and people who presumed on his old glad days he courteously put
  in their places. He saw the need of repressing insubordination, when
  Arrowsmith appeared in a limousine. He gave him one week after his return to
  enjoy the limousine, then blandly called on him in his laboratory.</p>

  <p>"Martin," he sighed, "I find that our friend Ross McGurk is just a bit
  dissatisfied with the practical results that are coming out of the Institute
  and, to convince him, I'm afraid I really must ask you to put less emphasis
  on bacteriophage for the moment and take up influenza. The Rockefeller
  Institute has the right idea. They've utilized their best minds, and spent
  money magnificently, on such problems as pneumonia, meningitis, cancer.
  They've already lessened the terrors of meningitis and pneumonia, and yellow
  fever is on the verge of complete abolition through Noguchi's work, and I
  have no doubt their hospital, with its enormous resources and splendidly
  co-operating minds, will be the first to find something to alleviate
  diabetes. Now, I understand, they're hot after the cause of influenza.
  They're not going to permit another great epidemic of it. Well, dear chap,
  it's up to us to beat them on the flu, and I've chosen you to represent us in
  the race."</p>

  <p>Martin was at the moment hovering over a method of reproducing phage on
  dead bacteria, but he could not refuse, he could not risk being discharged.
  He was too rich! Martin the renegade medical student could flounder off and
  be a soda-clerk, but if the husband of Joyce Lanyon should indulge in such
  insanity, he would be followed by reporters and photographed at the soda
  handles. Still less could he chance becoming merely her supported
  husband&mdash;a butler of the boudoir.</p>

  <p>He assented, not very pleasantly.</p>

  <p>He began to work on the cause of influenza with a half-heartedness almost
  magnificent. In the hospitals he secured cultures from cases which might be
  influenza and might be bad colds&mdash;no one was certain just what the
  influenza symptoms were; nothing was clean cut. He left most of the work to
  his assistants, occasionally giving them sardonic directions to "put on
  another hundred tubes of the A medium&mdash;hell, make it another thousand!"
  and when he found that they were doing as they pleased, he was not righteous
  nor rebuking. If he did not guiltily turn his hand from the plow it was only
  because he never touched the plow. Once his own small laboratory had been as
  fussily neat as a New Hampshire kitchen. Now the several rooms under his
  charge were a disgrace, with long racks of abandoned test-tubes, many
  half-filled with mold, none of them properly labeled.</p>

  <p>Then he had his idea. He began firmly to believe that the Rockefeller
  investigators had found the cause of flu. He gushed in to Holabird and told
  him so. As for himself, he was going back to his search for the real nature
  of phage.</p>

  <p>Holabird argued that Martin must be wrong. If Holabird wanted the McGurk
  Institute&mdash;and the Director of the McGurk Institute&mdash;to have the
  credit for capturing influenza, then it simply could not be possible that
  Rockefeller was ahead of them. He also said weighty things about phage. Its
  essential nature, he pointed out, was an academic question.</p>

  <p>But Martin was by now too much of a scientific dialectician for Holabird,
  who gave up and retired to his den (or so Martin gloomily believed) to devise
  new ways of plaguing him. For a time Martin was again left free to wallow in
  work.</p>

  <p>He found a means of reproducing phage on dead bacteria by a very
  complicated, very delicate use of partial oxygen-carbon dioxide
  tension&mdash;as exquisite as cameo-carving, as improbable as weighing the
  stars. His report stirred the laboratory world, and here and there (in Tokio,
  in Amsterdam, in Winnemac) enthusiasts believed he had proven that phage was
  a living organism; and other enthusiasts said, in esoteric language with
  mathematical formulae, that he was a liar and six kinds of a fool.</p>

  <p>It was at this time, when he might have become a Great Man, that he
  pitched over most of his own work and some of the duties of being Joyce's
  husband to follow Terry Wickett, which showed that he lacked common sense,
  because Terry was still an assistant while he himself was head of a
  department.</p>

  <p>Terry had discovered that certain quinine derivatives when introduced into
  the animal body slowly decompose into products which are highly toxic to
  bacteria but only mildly toxic to the body. There was hinted here a whole new
  world of therapy. Terry explained it to Martin, and invited him to
  collaborate. Buoyant with great things they got leave from Holabird&mdash;and
  from Joyce&mdash;and though it was winter they went off to Birdies' Rest, in
  the Vermont hills. While they snowshoed and shot rabbits, and all the long
  dark evenings while they lay on their bellies before the fire, they ranted
  and planned.</p>

  <p>Martin had not been so long silk-wrapped that he could not enjoy gobbling
  salt pork after the northwest wind and the snow. It was not unpleasant to be
  free of thinking up new compliments for Joyce.</p>

  <p>They had, they saw, to answer an interesting question: Do the quinine
  derivatives act by attaching themselves to the bacteria, or by changing the
  body fluids? It was a simple, clear, definite question which required for
  answer only the inmost knowledge of chemistry and biology, a few hundred
  animals on which to experiment, and perhaps ten or twenty or a million years
  of trying and failing.</p>

  <p>They decided to work with the pneumococcus, and with the animal which
  should most nearly reproduce human pneumonia. This meant the monkey, and to
  murder monkeys is expensive and rather grim. Holabird, as Director, could
  supply them, but if they took him into confidence he would demand immediate
  results.</p>

  <p>Terry meditated, "'Member there was one of these Nobel-prize winners,
  Slim, one of these plumb fanatics that instead of blowing in the prize spent
  the whole thing on chimps and other apes, and he got together with another of
  those whiskery old birds, and they ducked up alleys and kept the anti-viv
  folks from prosecuting them, and settled the problem of the transfer of
  syphilis to lower animals? But we haven't got any Nobel Prize, I grieve to
  tell you, and it doesn't look to me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Terry, I'll do it, if necessary! I've never sponged on Joyce yet, but I
  will now, if the Holy Wren holds out on us."</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">They faced Holabird in his office, sulkily, rather
  childishly, and they demanded the expenditure of at least ten thousand
  dollars for monkeys. They wished to start a research which might take two
  years without apparent results&mdash;possibly without any results. Terry was
  to be transferred to Martin's department as co-head, their combined salaries
  shared equally.</p>

  <p>Then they prepared to fight.</p>

  <p>Holabird stared, assembled his mustache, departed from his Diligent
  Director manner, and spoke:</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute, if you don't mind. As I gather it, you are explaining to
  me that occasionally it's necessary to take some time to elaborate an
  experiment. I really must tell you that I was formerly a researcher in an
  Institute called McGurk, and learned several of these things all by myself!
  Hell, Terry, and you, Mart, don't be so egotistic! You're not the only
  scientists who like to work undisturbed! If you poor fish only knew how I
  long to get away from signing letters and get my fingers on a kymograph drum
  again! Those beautiful long hours of search for truth! And if you knew how
  I've fought the Trustees for the chance to keep you fellows free! All right.
  You shall have your monkeys. Fix up the joint department to suit yourselves.
  And work ahead as seems best. I doubt if in the whole scientific world
  there's two people that can be trusted as much as you two surly birds!"</p>

  <p>Holabird rose, straight and handsome and cordial, his hand out. They
  sheepishly shook it and sneaked away, Terry grumbling, "He's spoiled my whole
  day! I haven't got a single thing to kick about! Slim, where's the catch? You
  can bet there is one&mdash;there always is!"</p>

  <p>In a year of divine work, the catch did not appear. They had their
  monkeys, their laboratories and garcons, and their unbroken leisure; they
  began the most exciting work they had ever known, and decidedly the most
  nerve-jabbing. Monkeys are unreasonable animals; they delight in developing
  tuberculosis on no provocation whatever; in captivity they have a liking for
  epidemics; and they make scenes by cursing at their masters in seven
  dialects.</p>

  <p>"They're so up-and-coming," sighed Terry. "I feel like lettin' 'em go and
  retiring to Birdies' Rest to grow potatoes. Why should we murder live-wires
  like them to save pasty-faced, big-bellied humans from pneumonia?"</p>

  <p>Their first task was to determine with accuracy the tolerated dose of the
  quinine derivative, and to study its effects on the hearing and vision, and
  on the kidneys, as shown by endless determinations of blood sugar and blood
  urea. While Martin did the injections and observed the effect on the monkeys
  and lost himself in chemistry, Terry toiled (all night, all next day, then a
  drink and a frowsy nap and all night again) on new methods of synthesizing
  the quinine derivative.</p>

  <p>This was the most difficult period of Martin's life. To work, staggering
  sleepy, all night, to drowse on a bare table at dawn and to breakfast at a
  greasy lunch-counter, these were natural and amusing, but to explain to Joyce
  why he had missed her dinner to a lady sculptor and a lawyer whose
  grandfather had been a Confederate General, this was impossible. He won a
  brief tolerance by explaining that he really had longed to kiss her
  good-night, that he did appreciate the basket of sandwiches which she had
  sent, and that he was about to remove pneumonia from the human race, a
  statement which he healthily doubted.</p>

  <p>But when he had missed four dinners in succession; when she had raged,
  "Can you imagine how awful it was for Mrs. Thorn to be short a man at the
  last moment?" when she had wailed, "I didn't so much mind your rudeness on
  the other nights, but this evening, when I had nothing to do and sat home
  alone and waited for you"&mdash;then he writhed.</p>

  <p>Martin and Terry began to produce pneumonia in their monkeys and to treat
  them, and they had success which caused them to waltz solemnly down the
  corridor. They could save the monkeys from pneumonia invariably, when the
  infection had gone but one day, and most of them on the second day and the
  third.</p>

  <p>Their results were complicated by the fact that a certain number of
  monkeys recovered by themselves, and this they allowed for by simple-looking
  figures which took days of stiff, shoulder-aching sitting over papers...one
  wild-haired collarless man at a table, while the other walked among stinking
  cages of monkeys, clucking to them, calling them Bess and Rover, and grunting
  placidly, "Oh, you would bite me, would you, sweetheart!" and all the while,
  kindly but merciless as the gods, injecting them with the deadly
  pneumonia.</p>

  <p>They came into a high upland where the air was thin with failures. They
  studied in the test-tube the break-down products of pneumococci&mdash;and
  failed. They constructed artificial body fluids (carefully, painfully,
  inadequately), they tried the effect of the derivative on germs in this
  artificial blood&mdash;and failed.</p>

  <p>Then Holabird heard of their previous success, and came down on them with
  laurels and fury.</p>

  <p>He understood, he said, that they had a cure for pneumonia. Very well! The
  Institute could do with the credit for curing that undesirable disease, and
  Terry and Martin would kindly publish their findings (mentioning McGurk) at
  once.</p>

  <p>"We will not! Look here, Holabird!" snarled Terry, "I thought you were
  going to let us alone!"</p>

  <p>"I have! Nearly a year! Till you should complete your research. And now
  you've completed it. It's time to let the world know what you're doing."</p>

  <p>"If I did, the world would know a doggone sight more'n I do! Nothing
  doing, Chief. Maybe we can publish, in a year from now."</p>

  <p>"You'll publish now or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All right, Holy. The blessed moment has arrived. I quit! And I'm so
  gentlemanly that I do it without telling you what I think of you!"</p>

  <p>Thus was Terry Wickett discharged from McGurk. He patented the process of
  synthesizing his quinine derivative and retired to Birdies' Rest, to build a
  laboratory out of his small savings and spend a life of independent research
  supported by a restricted sale of sera and of his drug.</p>

  <p>For Terry, wifeless and valetless, this was easy enough, but for Martin it
  was not simple.</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">Martin assumed that he would resign. He explained it to
  Joyce. How he was to combine a town house and a Greenwich castle with
  flannel-shirt collaboration at Birdies' Rest he had not quite planned, but he
  was not going to be disloyal.</p>

  <p>"Can you beat it! The Holy Wren fires Terry but doesn't dare touch me! I
  waited simply because I wanted to watch Holabird figure out what I'd do. And
  now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was elucidating it to her in their&mdash;in her&mdash;car, on the way
  home from a dinner at which he had been so gaily charming to an important
  dowager that Joyce had crooned, "What a fool Latham Ireland was to say he
  couldn't be polite!"</p>

  <p>"I'm free, by thunder at last I'm free, because I've worked up to
  something that's worth being free for!" he exulted.</p>

  <p>She laid her fine hand on his, and begged, "Wait! I want to think. Please!
  Do be quiet for a moment."</p>

  <p>Then: "Mart, if you went on working with Mr. Wickett, you'd have to be
  leaving me constantly."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I really don't think that would be quite nice&mdash;I mean especially
  now, because I fancy I'm going to have a baby."</p>

  <p>He made a sound of surprise.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm not going to do the weeping mother. And I don't know whether I'm
  glad or furious, though I do believe I'd like to have one baby. But it does
  complicate things, you know. And personally, I should be sorry if you left
  the Institute, which gives you a solid position, for a hole-and-corner
  existence. Dear, I have been fairly nice, haven't I? I really do like you,
  you know! I don't want you to desert me, and you would if you went off to
  this horrid Vermont place."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't we get a little house near there, and spend part of the
  year?"</p>

  <p>"Pos-sibly. But we ought to wait till this beastly job of bearing a Dear
  Little One is over, then think about it."</p>

  <p>Martin did not resign from the Institute, and Joyce did not think about
  taking a house near Birdies' Rest to the extent of doing it.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch39"
     name="ch39">CHAPTER XXXIX.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">With Terry Wickett gone, Martin returned to phage. He made a
  false start and did the worst work of his life. He had lost his fierce
  serenity. He was too conscious of the ordeal of a professional social life,
  and he could never understand that esoteric phenomenon, the
  dinner-party&mdash;the painful entertainment of people whom one neither likes
  nor finds interesting.</p>

  <p>So long as he had had a refuge in talking to Terry, he had not been too
  irritated by well-dressed nonentities, and for a time he had enjoyed the
  dramatic game of making Nice People accept him. Now he was disturbed by
  reason.</p>

  <p>Clif Clawson showed him how tangled his life had grown.</p>

  <p>When he had first come to New York, Martin had looked for Clif, whose
  boisterousness had been his comfort among Angus Duers and Irving Watterses in
  medical school. Clif was not to be found, neither at the motor agency for
  which he had once worked nor elsewhere on Automobile Row. For fourteen years
  Martin had not seen him.</p>

  <p>Then to his laboratory at McGurk was brought a black-and-red card:</p><br>

  <p class="sign">CLIFFORD L. CLAWSON<br>
  (Clif)<br>
  TOP NOTCH GUARANTEED OIL INVESTMENTS<br>
  Higham Block<br>
  Butte</p><br>

  <p>"Clif! Good old Clif! The best friend a man ever had! That time he lent me
  the money to get to Leora! Old Clif! By golly I need somebody like him, with
  Terry out of it and all these tea-hounds around me!" exulted Martin.</p>

  <p>He dashed out and stopped abruptly, staring at a man who was, not softly,
  remarking to the girl reception-clerk:</p>

  <p>"Well, sister, you scientific birds certainly do lay on the agony! Never
  struck a sweller layout than you got here, except in crook
  investment-offices&mdash;and I've never seen a nicer cutie than you anywhere.
  How 'bout lil dinner one of these beauteous evenings? I expect I'll
  parley-vous with thou full often now&mdash;I'm a great friend of Doc
  Arrowsmith. Fact I'm a doc myself&mdash;honest&mdash;real sawbones&mdash;went
  to medic school and everything. Ah! <i>Here's</i> the boy!"</p>

  <p>Martin had not allowed for the changes of fourteen years. He was
  dismayed.</p>

  <p>Clif Clawson, at forty, was gross. His face was sweaty, and puffy with
  pale flesh; his voice was raw; he fancied checked Norfolk jackets, tight
  across his swollen shoulders and his beefy hips.</p>

  <p>He bellowed, while he belabored Martin's back:</p>

  <p>"Well, well, well, well, well, well! Old Mart! Why, you old son of a gun!
  Why, you old son of a gun! Why, you damn' old chicken-thief! Say you skinny
  little runt, I'm a son of a gun if you look one day older'n when I saw you
  last in Zenith!"</p>

  <p>Martin was aware of the bright leering of the once humble reception-clerk.
  He said, "Well, gosh, it certainly is good to see you," and hastened to get
  Clif into the privacy of his office.</p>

  <p>"You look fine," he lied, when they were safe. "What you been doing with
  yourself? Leora and I did our best to look you up, when we first came to New
  York. Uh&mdash;Do you know about, uh, about her?"</p>

  <p>"Yuh, I read about her passing away. Fierce luck. And about your swell
  work in the West Indies&mdash;where was it? I guess you're a great man
  now&mdash;famous plague-chaser and all that stuff, and world-renowned
  skee-entist. I don't suppose you remember your old friends now."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't be a chump! It's&mdash;it's&mdash;it's fine to see you."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm glad to observe you haven't got the capitus enlargatus, Mart.
  Golly, I says to meself says I, if I blew in and old Mart high-hatted me, I'd
  just about come nigh unto letting him hear the straight truth, after all the
  compliments he's been getting from the sassiety dames. I'm glad you've kept
  your head. I thought about writing you from Butte&mdash;been selling some bum
  oil-stock there and kind of got out quick to save the inspectors the trouble
  of looking over my books. 'Well,' I thought, 'I'll just sit down and write
  the whey-faced runt a letter, and make him feel good by telling him how
  tickled I am over his nice work.' But you know how it is&mdash;time kind of
  slips by. Well, this is excellentus! We'll have a chance to see a whole lot
  of each other now. I'm going in with a fellow on an investment stunt here in
  New York. Great pickings, old kid! I'll take you out and show you how to
  order a real feed, one of these days. Well, tell me what you been doing since
  you got back from the West Indies. I suppose you're laying your plans to try
  and get in as the boss or president or whatever they call it of this
  gecelebrated Institute."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I, uh, well, I shouldn't much care to be Director. I prefer
  sticking to my lab. I&mdash;Perhaps you'd like to hear about my work on
  phage."</p>

  <p>Rejoicing to discover something of which he could talk, Martin sketched
  his experiments.</p>

  <p>Clif spanked his forehead with a spongy hand and shouted:</p>

  <p>"Wait! Say, I've got an idea&mdash;and you can come right in on it. As I
  apperceive it, the dear old Gen. Public is just beginning to hear about this
  bac&mdash;what is it?&mdash;bacteriophage junk. Look here! Remember that old
  scoundrel Benoni Carr, that I introduced as a great pharmacologist at the
  medical banquet? Had din-din with him last eventide. He's running a
  sanitarium out on Long Island&mdash;slick idea, too&mdash;practically he's a
  bootlegger; gets a lot of high-rollers out there and let's 'em have all the
  hooch they want, on prescriptions, absolutely legal and water-tight! The
  parties they throw at that joint, dames and everything! Believe me, Uncle
  Clif is sore stricken with tootelus bootelus and is going to the Carr
  Sanitarium for what ails him! But now look: Suppose we got him or somebody to
  rig up a new kind of cure&mdash;call it phageotherapy&mdash;oh, it takes
  Uncle Clif to invent the names that claw in the bounteous dollars! Patients
  sit in a steam cabinet and eat tablets made of phage, with just a little
  strychnin to jazz up their hearts! Bran-new! Million in it!
  What-cha-think?"</p>

  <p>Martin was almost feeble. "No. I'm afraid I'm against it."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I&mdash;Honestly, Clif, if you don't understand it, I don't know
  how I can explain the scientific attitude to you. You know&mdash;that's what
  Gottlieb used to call it&mdash;scientific attitude. And as I'm a
  scientist&mdash;least I hope I am&mdash;I couldn't&mdash;Well, to be
  associated with a thing like that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But, you poor louse, don't you suppose I understand the scientific
  attitude? Gosh, I've seen a dissecting-room myself! Why, you poor crab, of
  course I wouldn't expect you to have your name associated with it! You'd keep
  in the background and slip us all the dope, and get a lot of publicity for
  phage in general so the Dee-ah People would fall easier, and we'd pull all
  the strong-arm work."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;I hope you're joking, Clif. If you weren't joking, I'd tell you
  that if anybody tried to pull a thing like that, I'd expose 'em and get 'em
  sent to jail, no matter who they were!"</p>

  <p>"Well, gosh, if you feel that way about it&mdash;!"</p>

  <p>Clif was peering over the fatty pads beneath his eyes. He sounded
  doubtful:</p>

  <p>"I suppose you have the right to keep other guys from grabbing your own
  stuff. Well, all right, Mart. Got to be teloddeling. Tell you what you
  <i>might</i> do, though, if that don't hurt your tender conscience, too: you
  might invite old Clif up t' the house for dinner, to meet the new lil wifey
  that I read about in the sassiety journals. You might happen to remember, old
  bean, that there have been times when you were glad enough to let poor fat
  old Clif slip you a feed and a place to sleep!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know. You bet there have! Nobody was ever decenter to me; nobody.
  Look. Where you staying? I'll find out from my wife what dates we have ahead,
  and telephone you tomorrow morning."</p>

  <p>"So you let the Old Woman keep the work-sheet for you, huh? Well, I never
  butt into anybody's business. I'm staying at the Berrington Hotel, room
  617&mdash;'member that, 617&mdash;and you might try and 'phone me before ten
  tomorrow. Say, that's one grand sweet song of a cutie you got on the door
  here. What cha think? How's chances on dragging her out to feed and shake a
  hoof with Uncle Clif?"</p>

  <p>As primly as the oldest, most staid scientist in the Institute, Martin
  protested, "Oh, she belongs to very nice family. I don't think I should try
  it. Really, I'd rather you didn't."</p>

  <p>Clif's gaze was sharp, for all its fattiness.</p>

  <p>With excessive cordiality, with excessive applause when Clif remarked,
  "You better go back to work and put some salt on a coupla bacteria's tails,"
  Martin guided him to the reception-room, safely past the girl clerk, and to
  the elevator.</p>

  <p>For a long time he sat in his office and was thoroughly wretched.</p>

  <p>He had for years pictured Clif Clawson as another Terry Wickett. He saw
  that Clif was as different from Terry as from Rippleton Holabird. Terry was
  rough, he was surly, he was colloquial, he despised many fine and gracious
  things, he offended many fine and gracious people, but these acerbities made
  up the haircloth robe wherewith he defended a devotion to such holy work as
  no cowled monk ever knew. But Clif&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I'd do the world a service by killing that man!" Martin fretted.
  "Phageotherapy at a yegg sanitarium! I stand him only because I'm too much of
  a coward to risk his going around saying that 'in the days of my Success,
  I've gone back on my old friends.' (Success! Puddling at work! Dinners!
  Talking to idiotic women! Being furious because you weren't invited to the
  dinner to the Portuguese minister!) No. I'll 'phone Clif we can't have him at
  the house."</p>

  <p>Over him came remembrance of Clif's loyalty in the old barren days, and
  Clif's joy to share with him every pathetic gain.</p>

  <p>"Why <i>should</i> he understand my feeling about phage? Was his scheme
  any worse than plenty of reputable drug-firms? How much was I righteously
  offended, and how much was I sore because he didn't recognize the high social
  position of the rich Dr. Arrowsmith?"</p>

  <p>He gave up the question, went home, explained almost frankly to Joyce what
  her probable opinion of Clif would be, and contrived that Clif should be
  invited to dinner with only the two of them.</p>

  <p>"My dear Mart," said Joyce, "why do you insult me by hinting that I'm such
  a snob that I'll be offended by racy slang and by business ethics very much
  like those of dear Roger's grandpapa? Do you think I've never ventured out of
  the drawing-room? I thought you'd seen me outside it! I shall probably like
  your Clawson person very much indeed."</p>

  <p>The day after Martin had invited him to dinner, Clif telephoned to
  Joyce:</p>

  <p>"This Mrs. Arrowsmith? Well, say, this is old Clif."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I didn't quite catch it."</p>

  <p>"Clif! Old Clif!"</p>

  <p>"I'm frightfully sorry but&mdash;Perhaps there's a bad connection."</p>

  <p>"Why, it's Mr. <i>Clawson</i>, that's going to feed with you
  on&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, of course. I <i>am</i> so sorry."</p>

  <p>"Well, look: What I wanted to know is: Is this going to be just a homey
  grub-grabbing or a real soiree? In other words, honey, shall I dress natural
  or do I put on the soup-and-fish? Oh, I got 'em&mdash;swallowtail and the
  whole darn' outfit!"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;Do you mean&mdash;Oh. Shall you dress for dinner? I think perhaps
  I would."</p>

  <p>"Attaboy! I'll be there, dolled up like a new saloon. I'll show you folks
  the cutest lil line of jeweled studs you ever laid eyes on. Well, it's been a
  great pleezhure to meet Mart's Missus, and we will now close with singing
  'Till We Meet Again' or 'Au Reservoir.'"</p>

  <p>When Martin came home, Joyce faced him with, "Sweet, I can't do it! The
  man must be mad. Really, dear, you just take care of him and let me go to
  bed. Besides: you two won't want me&mdash;you'll want to talk over old times,
  and I'd only interfere. And with baby coming in two months now, I ought to go
  to bed early."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Joy, Clif'd be awfully offended, and he's always been so decent to me
  and&mdash;And you've often asked me about my cub days. Don't you
  <i>want</i>," plaintively, "to hear about 'em?"</p>

  <p>"Very well, dear. I'll try to be a little sunbeam to him, but I warn you I
  sha'n't be a success."</p>

  <p>They worked themselves up to a belief that Clif would be raucous, would
  drink too much, and slap Joyce on the back. But when he appeared for dinner
  he was agonizingly polite and flowery&mdash;till he became slightly drunk.
  When Martin said "damn," Clif reproved him with, "Of course I'm only a hick,
  but I don't think a lady like the Princess here would like you to cuss."</p>

  <p>And, "Well, I never expected a rube like young Mart to marry the real
  bon-ton article."</p>

  <p>And, "Oh, maybe it didn't cost something to furnish this dining-room, oh,
  not a-tall!"</p>

  <p>And, "Champagne, heh? Well, you're certainly doing poor old Clif proud.
  Your Majesty, just tell your High Dingbat to tell his valay to tell my
  secretary the address of your bootlegger, will you?"</p>

  <p>In his cups, though he severely retained his moral and elegant vocabulary,
  Clif chronicled the jest of selling oil-wells unprovided with oil and of
  escaping before the law closed in; the cleverness of joining churches for the
  purpose of selling stock to the members; and the edifying experience of
  assisting Dr. Benoni Carr to capture a rich and senile widow for his
  sanitarium by promising to provide medical consultation from the
  spirit-world.</p>

  <p>Joyce was silent through it all, and so superbly polite that everyone was
  wretched.</p>

  <p>Martin struggled to make a liaison between them, and he had no elevating
  remarks about the strangeness of a man's boasting of his own crookedness, but
  he was coldly furious when Clif blundered:</p>

  <p>"You said old Gottlieb was sort of down on his luck now."</p>

  <p>"Yes, he's not very well."</p>

  <p>"Poor old coot. But I guess you've realized by now how foolish you were
  when you used to fall for him like seven and a half brick. Honestly, Lady
  Arrowsmith, this kid used to think Pa Gottlieb was the cat's
  pajamas&mdash;begging your pardon for the slanguageness."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" said Martin.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm onto Gottlieb! Of course you know as well as I do that he always
  was a self-advertiser, getting himself talked about by confidin' to the whole
  ops terrara what a strict scientist he was, and putting on a lot of dog and
  emitting these wise cracks about philosophy and what fierce guys the regular
  docs were. But what's worse than&mdash;Out in San Diego I ran onto a fellow
  that used to be an instructor in botany in Winnemac, and he told me that with
  all this antibody stuff of his, Gottlieb never gave any credit to&mdash;well,
  he was some Russian that did most of it before and Pa Gottlieb stole all his
  stuff."</p>

  <p>That in this charge against Gottlieb there was a hint of truth, that he
  knew the great god to have been at times ungenerous, merely increased the
  rage which was clenching Martin's fist in his lap.</p>

  <p>Three years before, he would have thrown something, but he was an
  adaptable person. He had yielded to Joyce's training in being quietly instead
  of noisily disagreeable; and his only comment was "No, I think you're wrong,
  Clif. Gottlieb has carried the antibody work 'way beyond all the others."</p>

  <p>Before the coffee and liqueurs had come into the drawing-room, Joyce
  begged, at her prettiest, "Mr. Clawson, do you mind awfully if I slip up to
  bed? I'm so frightfully glad to have had the opportunity of meeting one of my
  husband's oldest friends, but I'm not feeling very well, and I do think I'd
  be wise to have some rest."</p>

  <p>"Madam the Princess, I noticed you were looking peeked."</p>

  <p>"Oh! Well&mdash;Good-night!"</p>

  <p>Martin and Clif settled in large chairs in the drawing-room, and tried to
  play at being old friends happy in meeting. They did not look at each
  other.</p>

  <p>After Clif had cursed a little and told three sound smutty stories, to
  show that he had not been spoiled and that he had been elegant only to
  delight Joyce, he flung:</p>

  <p>"Huh! So that is that, as the Englishers remark. Well, I could see your
  Old Lady didn't cotton to me. She was just as chummy as an iceberg. But gosh,
  I don't mind. She's going to have a kid, and of course women, all of 'em, get
  cranky when they're that way. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He hiccuped, looked sage, and bolted his fifth cognac.</p>

  <p>"But what I never could figure out&mdash;Mind you, I'm not criticizing the
  Old Lady. She's as swell as they make 'em. But what I can't understand is how
  after living with Leora, who was the real thing, you can stand a hoity-toity
  skirt like Joycey!"</p>

  <p>Then Martin broke.</p>

  <p>The misery of not being able to work, these months since Terry had gone,
  had gnawed at him.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Clif. I won't have you discuss my wife. I'm sorry she doesn't
  please you, but I'm afraid that in this particular matter&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Clif had risen, not too steadily, though his voice and his eyes were
  resolute.</p>

  <p>"All right. I figured out you were going to high-hat me. Of course I
  haven't got a rich wife to slip me money. I'm just a plain old hobo. I don't
  belong in a place like this. Not smooth enough to be a butler. You are. All
  right. I wish you luck. And meanwhile you can go plumb to hell, my young
  friend!"</p>

  <p>Martin did not pursue him into the hall.</p>

  <p>As he sat alone he groaned, "Thank Heaven, that operation's over!"</p>

  <p>He told himself that Clif was a crook, a fool, and a fat waster; he told
  himself that Clif was a cynic without wisdom, a drunkard without charm, and a
  philanthropist who was generous only because it larded his vanity. But these
  admirable truths did not keep the operation from hurting any more than it
  would have eased the removal of an appendix to be told that it was a bad
  appendix, an appendix without delicacy or value.</p>

  <p>He had loved Clif&mdash;did love him and always would. But he would never
  see him again. Never!</p>

  <p>The impertinence of that flabby blackguard to sneer at Gottlieb! His
  boorishness! Life was too short for&mdash;</p>

  <p>"But hang it&mdash;yes, Clif is a tough, but so am I. He's a crook, but
  wasn't I a crook to fake my plague figures in St. Hubert&mdash;and the worse
  crook because I got praise for it?"</p>

  <p>He bobbed up to Joyce's room. She was lying in her immense four-poster,
  reading "Peter Whiffle."</p>

  <p>"Darling, it was all rather dreadful, wasn't it!" she said. "He's
  gone?"</p>

  <p>"Yes...He's gone...I've driven out the best friend I ever
  had&mdash;practically. I let him go, let him go off feeling that he was a
  rotter and a failure. It would have been decenter to have killed him. Oh, why
  couldn't you have been simple and jolly with him? You were so confoundedly
  polite! He was uneasy and unnatural, and showed up worse than he really is.
  He's no tougher than&mdash;he's a lot better than the financiers who cover up
  their stuff by being suave...Poor devil! I'll bet right now Clif's tramping
  in the rain, saying, 'The one man I ever loved and tried to do things for has
  turned against me, now he's&mdash;now he has a lovely wife. What's the use of
  ever being decent?' he's saying...Why couldn't you be simple and chuck your
  high-falutin' manners for once?"</p>

  <p>"See here! You disliked him quite as much as I did, and I will not have
  you blame it on me! You've grown beyond him. You that are always blaring
  about Facts&mdash;can't you face the fact? For once, at least, it's not my
  fault. You may perhaps remember, my king of men, that I had the good sense to
  suggest that I shouldn't appear tonight; not meet him at all."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;well&mdash;yes&mdash;gosh&mdash;but&mdash;Oh, I suppose so.
  Well, anyway&mdash;It's over, and that's all there is to it."</p>

  <p>"Darling, I do understand how you feel. But isn't it good it is over! Kiss
  me good-night."</p>

  <p>"<i>But</i>"&mdash;Martin said to himself, as he sat feeling naked and
  lost and homeless, in the dressing-gown of gold dragon-flies on black silk
  which she had bought for him in Paris&mdash;"but if it'd been Leora instead
  of Joyce&mdash;Leora would've known Clif was a crook, and she'd've accepted
  it as a fact. (Talk about your facing facts!) She wouldn't've insisted on
  sitting as a judge. She wouldn't've said, 'This is different from me, so it's
  wrong.' She'd've said, 'This is different from me, so it's interesting.'
  Leora&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He had a sharp, terrifying vision of her, lying there coffinless, below
  the mold in a garden on the Penrith Hills.</p>

  <p>He came out of it to growl, "What was it Clif said? 'You're not her
  husband&mdash;you're her butler&mdash;you're too smooth.' He was right! The
  whole point is: I'm not allowed to see who I want to. I've been so clever
  that I've made myself the slave of Joyce and Holy Holabird."</p>

  <p>He was always going to, but he never did see Clif Clawson again.</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">It happened that both Joyce's and Martin's paternal
  grandfathers had been named John, and John Arrowsmith they called their son.
  They did not know it, but a certain John Arrowsmith, mariner of Bideford, had
  died in the matter of the Spanish Armada, taking with him five valorous
  Dons.</p>

  <p>Joyce suffered horribly, and renewed all of Martin's love for her (he did
  love pitifully this slim, brilliant girl).</p>

  <p>"Death's a better game than bridge&mdash;you have no partner to help you!"
  she said, when she was grotesquely stretched on a chair of torture and
  indignity; when before they would give her the anesthetic, her face was green
  with agony.</p>

  <p>John Arrowsmith was straight of back and straight of limb&mdash;ten good
  pounds he weighed at birth&mdash;and he was gay of eye when he had ceased to
  be a raw wrinkled grub and become a man-child. Joyce worshiped him, and
  Martin was afraid of him, because he saw that this minuscule aristocrat, this
  child born to the self-approval of riches, would some day condescend to
  him.</p>

  <p>Three months after child-bearing, Joyce was more brisk than ever about
  putting and back-hand service and hats and Russian emigres.</p><br>

  <p class="first">For science Joyce had great respect and no understanding.
  Often she asked Martin to explain his work, but when he was glowing, making
  diagrams with his thumb-nail on the tablecloth, she would interrupt him with
  a gracious "Darling&mdash;do you mind&mdash;just a second&mdash;Plinder,
  isn't there any more of the sherry?"</p>

  <p>When she turned back to him, though her eyes were kind his enthusiasm was
  gone.</p>

  <p>She came to his laboratory, asked to see his flasks and tubes, and begged
  him to bully her into understanding, but she never sat back watching for
  silent hours.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, in his bogged floundering in the laboratory, he touched solid
  earth. He blundered into the effect of phage on the mutation of bacterial
  species&mdash;very beautiful, very delicate&mdash;and after plodding months
  when he had been a sane citizen, an almost good husband, an excellent
  bridge-player, and a rotten workman, he knew again the happiness of high taut
  insanity.</p>

  <p>He wanted to work nights, every night. During his uninspired fumbling,
  there had been nothing to hold him at the Institute after five, and Joyce had
  become used to having him flee to her. Now he showed an inconvenient ability
  to ignore engagements, to snap at delightful guests who asked him to explain
  all about science, to forget even her and the baby.</p>

  <p>"I've <i>got</i> to work evenings!" he said. "I can't be regular and easy
  about it when I'm caught by a big experiment, any more than you could be
  regular and easy and polite when you were gestating the baby."</p>

  <p>"I know but&mdash;Darling, you get so nervous when you're working like
  this. Heavens, I don't care how much you offend people by missing
  engagements&mdash;well, after all, I wish you wouldn't, but I do know it may
  be unavoidable. But when you make yourself so drawn and trembly, are you
  gaining time in the long run? It's just for your own sake. Oh, I have it!
  Wait! You'll see what a scientist I am! No, I won't explain&mdash;not
  yet!"</p>

  <p>Joyce had wealth and energy. A week later, flushed, slim, gallant, joyous,
  she said to him after dinner, "I've got a surprise for you!"</p>

  <p>She led him to the unoccupied rooms over the garage, behind their house.
  In that week, using a score of workmen from the most immaculate and elaborate
  scientific supply-house in the country, she had created for him the best
  bacteriological laboratory he had ever seen&mdash;white-tile floor and
  enameled brick walls, ice-box and incubator, glassware and stains and
  microscope, a perfect constant-temperature bath&mdash;and a technician,
  trained in Lister and Rockefeller, who had his bedroom behind the laboratory
  and who announced his readiness to serve Dr. Arrowsmith day or night.</p>

  <p>"There!" sang Joyce. "Now when you simply must work evenings, you won't
  have to go clear down to Liberty Street. You can duplicate your cultures or
  whatever you call 'em. If you're bored at dinner&mdash;all right! You can
  slip out here afterward and work as late as ever you want. Is&mdash;Sweet, is
  it all right? Have I done it right? I tried so hard&mdash;I got the best men
  I could&mdash;"</p>

  <p>While his lips were against hers he brooded, "To have done this for me!
  And to be so humble!...And now, curse it, I'll <i>never</i> be able to get
  away by myself!"</p>

  <p>She so joyfully demanded his finding some fault that, to give her the
  novel pleasure of being meek, he suggested that the centrifuge was
  inadequate.</p>

  <p>"You wait, my man!" she crowed.</p>

  <p>Two evenings after, when they had returned from the opera, she led him to
  the cement-floored garage beneath his new laboratory, and in a corner, ready
  to be set up, was a secondhand but adequate centrifuge, a most adequate
  centrifuge, the masterpiece of the great firm of Berkeley-Saunders&mdash;in
  fact none other than Gladys, whose dismissal from McGurk for her sluttish
  ways had stirred Martin and Terry to go out and get bountifully drunk.</p>

  <p>It was less easy for him, this time, to be grateful, but he worked at
  it.</p><br>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">Through both the economico-literary and the Rolls-Royce
  section of Joyce's set the rumor panted that there was a new diversion in an
  exhausted world&mdash;going out to Martin's laboratory and watching him work,
  and being ever so silent and reverent, except perhaps when Joyce murmured,
  "Isn't he adorable the way he teaches his darling bacteria to say 'Pretty
  Polly'!" or when Latham Ireland convulsed them by arguing that scientists had
  no sense of humor, or Sammy de Lembre burst out in his marvelous burlesque of
  jazz:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">Oh, Mistah Back-sil-lil-us, don't you gri-in at me;<br>
  You mi-cro-bi-o-log-ic cuss, I'm o-on-to thee.<br>
  When Mr. Dr. Arrowsmith's done looked at de clues,<br>
  You'll sit in jail a-singin' dem Bac-ter-i-uh Blues.</p><br>

  <p>Joyce's cousin from Georgia sparkled, "Mart is so cute with all those lil
  vases of his. But Ah can always get him so mad by tellin' him the trouble
  with <i>him</i> is, he don't go to church often enough!"</p>

  <p>While Martin sought to concentrate.</p>

  <p>They flocked from the house to his laboratory only once a week, which was
  certainly not enough to disturb a resolute man&mdash;merely enough to keep
  him constantly waiting for them.</p>

  <p>When he sedately tried to explain this and that to Joyce, she said, "Did
  we bother you this evening? But they do admire you so."</p>

  <p>He remarked, "Well," and went to bed.</p><br>

  <h3>V.</h3>

  <p class="first">R. A. Hopburn, the eminent patent-lawyer, as he drove away
  from the Arrowsmith-Lanyon mansion grunted at his wife:</p>

  <p>"I don't mind a host throwing the port at you, if he thinks you're a
  chump, but I do mind his being bored at your daring to express any opinion
  whatever...Didn't he look silly, out in his idiotic laboratory!...How the
  deuce do you suppose Joyce ever came to marry him?"</p>

  <p>"I can't imagine."</p>

  <p>"I can only think of one reason. Of course she may&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Now please don't be filthy!"</p>

  <p>"Well, anyway&mdash;She who might have picked any number of well-bred,
  agreeable, intelligent chaps&mdash;and I <i>mean</i> intelligent, because
  this Arrowsmith person may know all about germs, but he doesn't know a
  symphony from a savory...I don't think I'm too fussy, but I don't quite see
  why we should go to a house where the host apparently enjoys flatly
  contradicting you...Poor devil, I'm really sorry for him; probably he doesn't
  even know when he's being rude."</p>

  <p>"No. Perhaps. What hurts is to think of old Roger&mdash;so gay, so strong,
  real Skull and Bones&mdash;and to have this abrupt Outsider from the tall
  grass sitting in his chair, failing to appreciate his Pol Roger&mdash;What
  Joyce ever saw in him! Though he does have nice eyes and such funny strong
  hands&mdash;"</p><br>

  <h3>VI.</h3>

  <p class="first">Joyce's busyness was on his nerves. Why she was so busy it
  was hard to ascertain; she had an excellent housekeeper, a noble butler, and
  two nurses for the baby. But she often said that she was never allowed to
  attain her one ambition: to sit and read.</p>

  <p>Terry had once caller her The Arranger, and though Martin resented it,
  when he heard the telephone bell he groaned, "Oh, Lord, there's The
  Arranger&mdash;wants me to come to tea with some high-minded hen."</p>

  <p>When he sought to explain that he must be free from entanglements, she
  suggested, "Are you such a weak, irresolute, <i>little</i> man that the only
  way you can keep concentrated is by running away? Are you afraid of the big
  men who can do big work, and still stop and play?"</p>

  <p>He was likely to turn abusive, particularly as to her definition of Big
  Men, and when he became hot and vulgar, she turned grande dame, so that he
  felt like an impertinent servant and was the more vulgar.</p>

  <p>He was afraid of her then. He imagined fleeing to Leora, and the two of
  them, frightened little people, comforting each other and hiding from her in
  snug corners.</p>

  <p>But often enough Joyce was his companion, seeking new amusements as
  surprises for him, and in their son they had a binding pride. He sat watching
  little John, rejoicing in his strength.</p>

  <p>It was in early winter, after she had royally taken the baby South for a
  fortnight, that Martin escaped for a week with Terry at Birdies' Rest.</p>

  <p>He found Terry tired and a little surly, after months of working
  absolutely alone. He had constructed beside the home cabin a shanty for
  laboratory, and a rough stable for the horses which he used in the
  preparation of his sera. Terry did not, as once he would have, flare into the
  details of his research, and not till evening, when they smoked before the
  rough fireplace of the cabin, loafing in chairs made of barrels cushioned
  with elk skin, could Martin coax him into confidences.</p>

  <p>He had been compelled to give up much of his time to mere housework and
  the production of the sera which paid his expenses. "If you'd only been with
  me, I could have accomplished something." But his quinine derivative research
  had gone on solidly, and he did not regret leaving McGurk. He had found it
  impossible to work with monkeys; they were too expensive and too fragile to
  stand the Vermont winter; but he had contrived a method of using mice
  infected with pneumococcus and&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Oh, what's the use of my telling you this, Slim? You're not interested,
  or you'd have been up here at work with me, months ago. You've chosen between
  Joyce and me. All right, but you can't have both."</p>

  <p>Martin snarled, "I'm very sorry I intruded on you, Wickett," and slammed
  out of the cabin. Stumbling through the snow, blundering in darkness against
  stumps, he knew the agony of his last hour, the hour of failure.</p>

  <p>"I've lost Terry, now (though I won't stand his impertinence!). I've lost
  everybody, and I've never really had Joyce. I'm completely alone. And I can
  only half work! I'm through! They'll never let me get to work again!"</p>

  <p>Suddenly, without arguing it out, he knew that he was not going to give
  up.</p>

  <p>He floundered back to the cabin and burst in, crying, "You old grouch, we
  got to stick together!"</p>

  <p>Terry was as much moved as he; neither of them was far from tears; and as
  they roughly patted each other's shoulders they growled, "Fine pair of fools,
  scrapping just because we're tired!"</p>

  <p>"I will come and work with you, somehow!" Martin swore. "I'll get a six
  months' leave from the Institute, and have Joyce stay at some hotel near
  here, or do <i>some</i>thing. Gee! Back to real work...<i>work!</i>...Now
  tell me: When I come up here, what d'you say we&mdash;"</p>

  <p>They talked till dawn.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch40"
     name="ch40">CHAPTER XL.</a></h2><br>

  <h3>I.</h3>

  <p class="first">Dr. and Mrs. Rippleton Holabird had invited only Joyce and
  Martin to dinner. Holabird was his most charming self. He admired Joyce's
  pearls, and when the squabs had been served he turned on Martin with friendly
  intensity:</p>

  <p>"Now will Joyce and you listen to me most particularly? Things are
  happening, Martin, and I want you&mdash;no, Science wants you!&mdash;to take
  your proper part in them. I needn't, by the way, hint that this is absolutely
  confidential. Dr. Tubbs and his League of Cultural Agencies are beginning to
  accomplish marvels, and Colonel Minnigen has been extraordinarily
  liberal.</p>

  <p>"They've gone at the League with exactly the sort of thoroughness and
  taking-it-slow that you and dear old Gottlieb have always insisted on. For
  four years now they've stuck to making plans. I happen to know that Dr. Tubbs
  and the council of the League have had the most wonderful conferences with
  college-presidents and editors and clubwomen and labor-leaders (the sound,
  sensible ones, of course) and efficiency-experts and the more advanced
  advertising-men and ministers, and all the other leaders of public
  thought.</p>

  <p>"They've worked out elaborate charts classifying all intellectual
  occupations and interests, with the methods and materials and tools, and
  especially the goals&mdash;the aims, the ideals, the moral
  purposes&mdash;that are suited to each of them. Really tremendous! Why, a
  musician or an engineer, for example, could look at his chart and tell
  accurately whether he was progressing fast enough, at his age, and if not,
  just what his trouble was, and the remedy. With this basis, the League is
  ready to go to work and encourage all brain-workers to affiliate.</p>

  <p>"McGurk Institute simply must get in on this co-ordination, which I regard
  as one of the greatest advances in thinking that has ever been made. We are
  at last going to make all the erstwhile chaotic spiritual activities of
  America really conform to the American ideal; we're going to make them as
  practical and supreme as the manufacture of cash-registers! I have certain
  reasons for supposing I can bring Ross McGurk and Minnigen together, now that
  the McGurk and Minnigen lumber interests have stopped warring, and if so I
  shall probably quit the Institute and help Tubbs guide the League of Cultural
  Agencies. Then we'll need a new Director of McGurk who will work with us and
  help bring Science out of the monastery to serve Mankind."</p>

  <p>By this time Martin understood everything about the League except what the
  League was trying to do.</p>

  <p>Holabird went on:</p>

  <p>"Now I know, Martin, that you've always rather sneered at Practicalness,
  but I have faith in you! I believe you've been too much under the influence
  of Wickett, and now that he's gone and you've seen more of life and of
  Joyce's set and mine, I believe I can coax you to take (oh! without in any
  way neglecting the severities of your lab work!) a broader view.</p>

  <p>"I am authorized to appoint an Assistant Director, and I think I'm safe in
  saying he would succeed me as full Director. Sholtheis wants the place, and
  Dr. Smith and Yeo would leap at it, but I haven't yet found any of them that
  are quite Our Own Sort, and I offer it to you! I daresay in a year or two,
  you will be Director of McGurk Institute!"</p>

  <p>Holabird was uplifted, as one giving royal favor. Mrs. Holabird was
  intense, as one present on an historical occasion and Joyce was ecstatic over
  the honor to her Man.</p>

  <p>Martin stammered, "W-why, I'll have to think it over. Sort of
  unexpected&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The rest of the evening Holabird so brimmingly enjoyed himself picturing
  an era in which Tubbs and Martin and he would rule, co-ordinate, standardize,
  and make useful the whole world of intelligence, from trousers-designing to
  poetry, that he did not resent Martin's silence. At parting he chanted, "Talk
  it over with Joyce, and let me have your decision tomorrow. By the way, I
  think we'll get rid of Pearl Robbins; she's been useful but now she considers
  herself indispensable. But that's a detail...Oh, I do have faith in you,
  Martin, dear old boy! You've grown and calmed down, and you've widened your
  interests so much, this past year!"</p>

  <p>In their car, in that moving curtained room under the crystal dome-light,
  Joyce beamed at him.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it too wonderful, Mart! And I do feel Rippleton can bring it off.
  Think of your being Director, head of that whole great Institute, when just a
  few years ago you were only a cub there! But haven't I perhaps helped, just a
  little?"</p>

  <p>Suddenly Martin hated the blue-and-gold velvet of the car, the cunningly
  hid gold box of cigarettes, all this soft and smothering prison. He wanted to
  be out beside the unseen chauffeur&mdash;His Own Sort!&mdash;facing the
  winter. He tried to look as though he were meditating, in an awed,
  appreciative manner, but he was merely being cowardly, reluctant to begin the
  slaughter. Slowly:</p>

  <p>"Would you really like to see me Director?"</p>

  <p>"Of course! All that&mdash;Oh, you know; I don't just mean the prominence
  and respect, but the power to accomplish good."</p>

  <p>"Would you like to see me dictating letters, giving out interviews, buying
  linoleum, having lunch with distinguished fools, advising men about whose
  work I don't know a blame' thing?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't be so superior! Someone has to do these things. And that'd be
  only a small part of it. Think of the opportunity of encouraging some
  youngster who wanted a chance to do splendid science!"</p>

  <p>"And give up my own chance?"</p>

  <p>"Why need you? You'd be head of your own department just the same. And
  even if you did give up&mdash;You are so stubborn! It's lack of imagination.
  You think that because you've started in on one tiny branch of mental
  activity, there's nothing else in the world. It's just as when I persuaded
  you that if you got out of your stinking laboratory once a week or so, and
  actually bent your powerful intellect to a game of golf, the world of science
  wouldn't immediately stop! No imagination! You're precisely like these
  business men you're always cursing because they can't see anything in life
  beyond their soap-factories or their banks!"</p>

  <p>"And you really would have me give up my work&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He saw that with all her eager complaisances she had never understood what
  he was up to, had not comprehended one word about the murderous effect of the
  directorship on Gottlieb.</p>

  <p>He was silent again, and before they reached home she said only, "You know
  I'm the last person to speak of money, but really, it's you who have so often
  brought up the matter of hating to be dependent on me, and you know as
  Director you would make so much more that&mdash;Forgive me!"</p>

  <p>She fled before him into her palace, into the automatic elevator.</p>

  <p>He plodded up the stairs, grumbling, "Yes, it is the first chance I've had
  to really contribute to the expenses here. Sure! Willing to take her money,
  but not to do anything in return, and then call it 'devotion to science!'
  Well, I've got to decide right now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He did not go through the turmoil of deciding; he leaped to decision
  without it. He marched into Joyce's room, irritated by its snobbishness of
  discreet color. He was checked by the miserable way in which she sat brooding
  on the edge of her day couch, but he flung:</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to do it, even if I have to leave the Institute&mdash;and
  Holabird will just about make me quit. I will not get buried in this pompous
  fakery of giving orders and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mart! Listen! Don't you want your son to be proud of you?"</p>

  <p>"Um. Well&mdash;<i>no</i>, not if he's to be proud of me for being a
  stuffed shirt, a sideshow barker&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Please don't be vulgar."</p>

  <p>"Why not? Matter of fact, I haven't been vulgar enough lately. What I
  ought to do is to go to Birdies' Rest right now, and work with Terry."</p>

  <p>"I wish I had some way of showing you&mdash;Oh, for a 'scientist' you do
  have the most incredible blind-spots! I wish I could make you see just how
  weak and futile that is. The wilds! The simple life! The old argument. It's
  just the absurd, cowardly sort of thing these tired highbrows do that sneak
  off to some Esoteric Colony and think they're getting strength to conquer
  life, when they're merely running away from it."</p>

  <p>"No. Terry has his place in the country only because he can live cheaper
  there. If we&mdash;if he could afford it, he'd probably be right here, in
  town, with garcons and everything, like McGurk, but with no Director
  Holabird, by God&mdash;and no Director Arrowsmith!"</p>

  <p>"Merely a cursing, ill-bred, intensely selfish Director Terry
  Wickett!"</p>

  <p>"Now, by God, let me tell you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Martin, do you need to emphasize your arguments by a 'by God' in every
  sentence, or have you a few other expressions in your highly scientific
  vocabulary?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I have enough vocabulary to express the idea that I'm thinking of
  joining Terry."</p>

  <p>"Look here, Mart. You feel so virtuous about wanting to go off and wear a
  flannel shirt and be peculiar and very, very pure. Suppose everybody argued
  that way. Suppose every father deserted his children whenever his nice little
  soul ached? Just what would become of the world? Suppose I were poor, and you
  left me, and I had to support John by taking in washing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It'd probably be fine for you but fierce on the washing! No! I beg your
  pardon. That was an obvious answer. But&mdash;I imagine it's just that
  argument that's kept almost everybody, all these centuries, from being
  anything but a machine for digestion and propagation and obedience. The
  answer is that very few ever do, under any condition, willingly leave a soft
  bed for a shanty bunk in order to be pure, as you very properly call it, and
  those of us that are pioneers&mdash;Oh, this debate could go on forever! We
  could prove that I'm a hero or a fool or a deserter or anything you like, but
  the fact is I've suddenly seen I must go! I want my freedom to work, and I
  herewith quit whining about it and grab it. You've been generous to me. I'm
  grateful. But you've never been mine. Good-by."</p>

  <p>"Darling, darling&mdash;We'll talk it over again in the morning, when you
  aren't so excited...And an hour ago I was so proud of you!"</p>

  <p>"All right. Good-night."</p>

  <p>But before morning, taking two suit-cases and a bag of his roughest
  clothes, leaving for her a tender note which was the hardest thing he had
  ever written, kissing his son and muttering, "Come to me when you grow up,
  old man," he went to a cheap side-street hotel. As he stretched on the
  rickety iron bed, he grieved for their love. Before noon he had gone to the
  Institute, resigned, taken certain of his own apparatus and notes and books
  and materials, refused to answer a telephone call from Joyce, and caught a
  train for Vermont.</p>

  <p>Cramped on the red-plush seat of the day-coach (he who of late had ridden
  in silken private cars), he grinned with the joy of no longer having to toil
  at dinner-parties.</p>

  <p>He drove up to Birdies' Rest in a bob-sled. Terry was chopping wood, in a
  mess of chip-littered snow.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Terry. Come for keeps."</p>

  <p>"Fine, Slim. Say, there's a lot of dishes in the shack need
  washing."</p><br>

  <h3>II.</h3>

  <p class="first">He had become soft. To dress in the cold shanty and to wash
  in icy water was agony; to tramp for three hours through fluffy snow
  exhausted him. But the rapture of being allowed to work twenty-four hours a
  day without leaving an experiment at its juiciest moment to creep home for
  dinner, of plunging with Terry into arguments as cryptic as theology and
  furious as the indignation of a drunken man, carried him along, and he felt
  himself growing sinewy. Often he meditated on yielding to Joyce so far as to
  allow her to build a better laboratory for them, and more civilized
  quarters.</p>

  <p>With only one servant, though, or two at the very most, and just a simple
  decent bathroom&mdash;</p>

  <p>She had written, "You have been thoroughly beastly, and any attempt at
  reconciliation, if that is possible now, which I rather doubt, must come from
  you."</p>

  <p>He answered, describing the ringing winter woods and not mentioning the
  platform word Reconciliation.</p><br>

  <h3>III.</h3>

  <p class="first">They wanted to study further the exact mechanism of the
  action of their quinine derivatives. This was difficult with the mice which
  Terry had contrived to use instead of monkeys, because of their size. Martin
  had brought with him strains of Bacillus lepisepticus, which causes a
  pleuro-pneumonia in rabbits, and their first labor was to discover whether
  their original compound was effective against this bacillus as well as
  against pneumococcus. Profanely they found that it was not; profanely and
  patiently they trudged into an infinitely complicated search for a compound
  that should be.</p>

  <p>They earned their living by preparing sera which rather grudgingly they
  sold to physicians of whose honesty they were certain, abruptly refusing the
  popular drug-vendors. They thus received surprisingly large sums, and among
  all clever people it was believed that they were too coyly shrewd to be
  sincere.</p>

  <p>Martin worried as much over what he considered his treachery to Clif
  Clawson as over his desertion of Joyce and John, but this worrying he did
  only when he could not sleep. Regularly, at three in the morning, he brought
  both Joyce and honest Clif to Birdies' Rest; and regularly, at six, when he
  was frying bacon, he forgot them.</p>

  <p>Terry the barbarian, once he was free of the tittering and success-pawing
  of Holabird, was an easy campmate. Upper berth or lower was the same to him,
  and till Martin was hardened to cold and fatigue, Terry did more than his
  share of wood-cutting and supply-toting, and with great melody and skill he
  washed their clothes.</p>

  <p>He had the genius to see that they two alone, shut up together season on
  season, would quarrel. He planned with Martin that the laboratory scheme
  should be extended to include eight (but never more!) maverick and undomestic
  researchers like themselves, who should contribute to the expenses of the
  camp by manufacturing sera, but otherwise do their own independent
  work&mdash;whether it should be the structure of the atom, or a disproof of
  the results of Drs. Wickett and Arrowsmith. Two rebels, a chemist now caught
  in a drug-firm and a university professor, were coming next autumn.</p>

  <p>"It's kind of a mis'able return to monasteries," grumbled Terry, "except
  that we're not trying to solve anything for anybody but our own fool selves.
  Mind you! When this place becomes a shrine, and a lot of cranks begin to
  creep in here, then you and I got to beat it, Slim. We'll move farther back
  in the woods, or if we feel too old for that, we'll take another shot at
  professorships or Dawson Hunziker or even the Rev. Dr. Holabird."</p>

  <p>For the first time Martin's work began definitely to draw ahead of
  Terry's.</p>

  <p>His mathematics and physical chemistry were now as sound as Terry's, his
  indifference to publicity and to flowery hangings as great, his industry as
  fanatical, his ingenuity in devising new apparatus at least comparable, and
  his imagination far more swift. He had less ease but more passion. He hurled
  out hypotheses like sparks. He began, incredulously, to comprehend his
  freedom. He would yet determine the essential nature of phage; and as he
  became stronger and surer&mdash;and no doubt less human&mdash;he saw ahead of
  him innumerous inquiries into chemotherapy and immunity; enough adventures to
  keep him busy for decades.</p>

  <p>It seemed to him that this was the first spring he had ever seen and
  tasted. He learned to dive into the lake, though the first plunge was an
  agony of fiery cold. They fished before breakfast, they supped at a table
  under the oaks, they tramped twenty miles on end, they had bluejays and
  squirrels for interested neighbors; and when they had worked all night, they
  came out to find serene dawn lifting across the sleeping lake.</p>

  <p>Martin felt sun-soaked and deep of chest, and always he hummed.</p>

  <p>And one day he peeped out, beneath his new horn-rimmed almost-middle-aged
  glasses, to see a gigantic motor crawling up their woods road. From the car,
  jolly and competent in tweeds, stepped Joyce.</p>

  <p>He wanted to flee through the back door of the laboratory shanty.
  Reluctantly he edged out to meet her.</p>

  <p>"It's a sweet place, really!" she said, and amiably kissed him. "Let's
  walk down by the lake."</p>

  <p>In a stilly place of ripples and birch boughs, he was moved to grip her
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>She cried, "Darling, I <i>have</i> missed you! You're wrong about lots of
  things, but you're right about this&mdash;you must work and not be disturbed
  by a lot of silly people. Do you like my tweeds? Don't they look wildernessy?
  You see, I've come to stay! I'll build a house near here; perhaps right
  across the lake. Yes. That will make a sweet place, over there on that sort
  of little plateau, if I can get the land&mdash;probably some horrid
  tight-fisted old farmer owns it. Can't you just <i>see</i> it: a wide low
  house, with enormous verandas and red awnings&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And visitors coming?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so. Sometimes. Why?"</p>

  <p>Desperately, "Joyce, I do love you. I want awfully, just now, to kiss you
  properly. But I will not have you bringing a lot of people&mdash;and there'd
  probably be a rotten noisy motor launch. Make our lab a joke. Roadhouse. New
  sensation. Why, Terry would go crazy! You <i>are</i> lovely! But you want a
  playmate, and I want to work. I'm afraid you can't stay. No."</p>

  <p>"And our son is to be left without your care?"</p>

  <p>"He&mdash;Would he have my care if I died?...He is a nice kid, too! I hope
  he won't be a Rich Man!...Perhaps ten years from now he'll come to me
  here."</p>

  <p>"And live like <i>this?</i>"</p>

  <p>"Sure&mdash;unless I'm broke. Then he won't live so well. We have meat
  practically every day now!"</p>

  <p>"I see. And suppose your Terry Wickett should marry some waitress or some
  incredibly stupid rustic? From what you've told me, he rather fancies that
  sort of girl!"</p>

  <p>"Well, either he and I would beat her, together, or it would be the one
  thing that could break me."</p>

  <p>"Martin, aren't you perhaps a little insane?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, absolutely! And how I enjoy it! Though you&mdash;You look here now,
  Joy! We're insane but we're not cranks! Yesterday an 'esoteric healer' came
  here because he thought this was a free colony, and Terry walked him twenty
  miles, and then I think he threw him in the lake. No. Gosh. Let me think." He
  scratched his chin. "I don't believe we're insane. We're farmers."</p>

  <p>"Martin, it's too infinitely diverting to find you becoming a fanatic, and
  all the while trying to wriggle out of being a fanatic. You've left common
  sense. I <i>am</i> common sense. I believe in bathing! Good-by!"</p>

  <p>"Now you look here. By golly&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She was gone, reasonable and triumphant.</p>

  <p>As the chauffeur maneuvered among the stumps of the clearing, for a moment
  Joyce looked out from her car, and they stared at each other, through tears.
  They had never been so frank, so pitiful, as in this one unarmored look which
  recalled every jest, every tenderness, every twilight they had known
  together. But the car rolled on unhalted, and he remembered that he had been
  doing an experiment&mdash;</p><br>

  <h3>IV.</h3>

  <p class="first">On a certain evening of May, Congressman Almus Pickerbaugh
  was dining with the President of the United States.</p>

  <p>"When the campaign is over, Doctor," said the President, "I hope we shall
  see you a cabinet-member&mdash;the first Secretary of Health and Eugenics in
  the country!"</p>

  <p>That evening, Dr. Rippleton Holabird was addressing a meeting of
  celebrated thinkers, assembled by the League of Cultural Agencies. Among the
  Men of Measured Merriment on the platform were Dr. Aaron Sholtheis, the new
  Director of McGurk Institute, and Dr. Angus Duer, head of the Duer Clinic and
  professor of surgery in Fort Dearborn Medical College.</p>

  <p>Dr. Holabird's epochal address was being broadcast by radio to a million
  ardently listening lovers of science.</p>

  <p>That evening, Bert Tozer of Wheatsylvania, North Dakota, was attending
  mid-week prayer-meeting. His new Buick sedan awaited him outside, and with
  modest satisfaction he heard the minister gloat:</p>

  <p>"The righteous, even the Children of Light, they shall be rewarded with a
  great reward and their feet shall walk in gladness, saith the Lord of Hosts;
  but the mockers, the Sons of Belial, they shall be slain betimes and cast
  down into darkness and failure, and in the busy marts shall they be
  forgot."</p>

  <p>That evening, Max Gottlieb sat unmoving and alone, in a dark small room
  above the banging city street. Only his eyes were alive.</p>

  <p>That evening, the hot breeze languished along the palm-waving ridge where
  the ashes of Gustaf Sondelius were lost among cinders, and a depression in a
  garden marked the grave of Leora.</p>

  <p>That evening, after an unusually gay dinner with Latham Ireland, Joyce
  admitted, "Yes, if I do divorce him, I may marry you. I know! He's never
  going to see how egotistical it is to think he's the only man living who's
  always right!"</p>

  <p>That evening, Martin Arrowsmith and Terry Wickett lolled in a clumsy boat,
  an extraordinarily uncomfortable boat, far out on the water.</p>

  <p>"I feel as if I were really beginning to work now," said Martin. "This new
  quinine stuff may prove pretty good. We'll plug along on it for two or three
  years, and maybe we'll get something permanent&mdash;and probably we'll
  fail!"</p>
