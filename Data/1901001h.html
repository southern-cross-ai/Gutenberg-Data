<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I. A MEETING ON THE
SEA.</h2>

<p>HE, She and Another&mdash;the triangle of the human drama! He
was a rich, popular, unmarried artist, now on his return from a
tour in the Western States. She was a young American actress, for
whom her friends prophesied a great future. The "Other" was as yet
unknown. He and She were fellow-passengers on board one of the
North German Lloyd boats from New York to Southampton. They had
been at sea several days, but had not so far made acquaintance. The
early part of the voyage was rough; and though he was a good
sailor, and ate, and smoked, and paced the deck with as much ease
as the motion of the vessel would allow, she had neither his
courage nor his hardihood, and did not even put in an appearance in
the saloon or the reading-room.</p>

<p>It was on the sixth evening that he was struck at dinner by the
sight of a new face, and saw that the hitherto vacant chair on the
left hand of the captain was filled at last. He was glad to find
that its occupant was a young woman&mdash;hardly more than a
girl&mdash;and, moreover, that she was very beautiful. There could
not be two opinions as to her beauty, though he mentally decided
that it was of a kind which would not appeal with equal force to
all tastes; certainly, it would not appeal at all to admirers of
the fleshly type, who prefer the charm of sense to that of
soul.</p>

<p>It seemed to Lendon&mdash;so he was called&mdash;that this young
lady's soul might he likened, as in Dryden's metaphor, to a rare
and well-tempered blade fretting its too delicate scabbard, so
frail was her physique, so ethereal her look. Her face was very
pale, but its paleness was not that of ill health. It had no lines,
and the shadows beneath her eyes and around the curve of her cheek
melted into each other, so that there seemed perfect softness and
no shadow. Her features were small and regular, the nose delicately
curved, and the nostrils slightly distended, thus giving a look of
quick sensibility. She had one of those mobile mouths&mdash;the
shape of a strung bow, in which the under lip goes up to meet the
curve of the upper&mdash;which are said to ho a sign of histrionic
genius. Her eyes were blue, very clear and wide open, with an
innocent irresponsible expression; and her hair, profuse in
quantity, was pale yellow, and had a sort of life of its own, each
strand seeming to stand apart and to reflect the light like a
filament of spun glass.</p>

<p>All this Lendon took in by a succession of quick glances; at
last he asked his neighbour, "Who is that young lady?" The
gentleman he addressed pulled out of his pocket a list of the
passengers and proceeded to mark off and identify the row of people
opposite, then he appealed to a ship's officer on the other side of
him for information, and finally turned to Lendon.</p>

<p>"Her name is Brett," he said, "Miss Beatrice Brett; she's a
singer or a performer of some sort, and she's going to join her
relations in England and work the newspaper people over there, so
that she can come back and make a boom with what they call a
European reputation. As if an American reputation wasn't good
enough! But that's the way with all of them. She's travelling by
herself, and she's under the captain's charge. Pretty, ain't
she?&mdash;but too like a ghost to suit my style."</p>

<p>Lendon continued to glance from time to time at Miss Brett, and,
as was natural to him, theories concerning her began to shape
themselves in his mind. He was quite certain that she did not want
to "make a boom." He could imagine nothing more repugnant to her
temperament than the vulgar process of "working the newspaper
people." He was sure, too, that she was not a singer&mdash;she
hadn't the sort of throat, he said to himself; and certainly she
was not one of those Western lecturing women who can spout forth
Art, Hygiene, or Free Love as commercial opportunities present
themselves. Yet she had the expression of one absorbed in a
purpose, whose mind was constantly dwelling upon her purpose, and
who was determined at all labour to carry it through. He wondered
what that purpose could be. The band was playing, as it always does
at dinner on the German line of boats. He knew the music; it was a
dreamy dance in a popular ballet, which bad been new and the rage
when be left London. He watched the girl's face as she bent forward
a little to listen. It gave him pleasure to see how her sensitive
lip trembled, how her eyes gathered intensity, and her nervous
lingers clasped and unclasped each other. He admired the way in
which her hair grew, and wondered if it would be possible to make a
sketch of her, which later he might work up into a fancy
picture.</p>

<p>As soon as dinner was over, Miss Brett got up and went into her
cabin. The next day the weather was very fine, and during the band
promenade nearly all the sick people found their way up on deck.
Among them was Miss Brett. She came up leaning on the arm of the
captain, who, having seated her in her long armchair and covered
her with her buffalo robe, left her to the company of her books.
She had two, Lendon noticed&mdash;one, a new novel with the pages
uncut, the other a worn-looking volume which, from its sober Russia
leather binding and quiet lettering, might have been taken for
either the Bible or Shakespeare. Lendon jumped to the conclusion
that it was Shakespeare, and, as it proved, was right.</p>

<p>For a German band, the music that morning was distinctly
uninteresting. The noisy march, to which most of the promenaders
kept time with a. cheerful effort, seemed no more to Miss Brett's
taste than it was to Lendon's. She lay back for a little while and
listened impatiently. Then she tried Shakespeare: he had stolen
along the bulwarks, and a furtive glance had told him that the play
was <i>Macbeth</i>. Presently she closed the volume with a sigh,
and began to turn over the leaves of the novel. The paper-cutter
slipped from her lap, and was carried along the deck. This was
Lendon's opportunity; he picked it up, and banded it back to her.
She thanked him with a smile that was very sweet and childlike. She
began to cut the leaves, but her muffiings embarrassed. her.</p>

<p>"Allow me," said Lendon, deferentially. He took the book from
her, and began to cut it with great deliberation. As he did so, he
made some observations on the weather and the aspect of the sea,
which broke the ice between them. He ventured to inquire if she had
suffered much during the rough weather.</p>

<p>"Oh! I am never ill," she answered. "I like the sea; I like it
even when it is rough."</p>

<p>He remarked that he had not seen her in the saloon till
yesterday.</p>

<p>"Oh," she answered, with a charming little blush, "I was very
lazy. I had an interesting book, and felt a little shy. I have
never crossed alone before. My people are to meet me at
Southampton." She went on to say that she had enjoyed lying quiet
is her cabin and being waited upon. "Before I left America I had
scarcely a moment to myself; I had worked very hard."</p>

<p>He glanced at the book in the sober binding. "You are a student
of Shakespeare, I see?</p>

<p>"I am an actress," she answered, as though the one thing implied
the other. "Of course I study Shakespeare; I study a great many
dramatists."</p>

<p>"And?"...he asked, and added, "I wonder if theoretical knowledge
is of much use?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well," she replied, laughing slightly, "I am bound to
confess that my theories don't serve me at critical moments. It is
something outside oneself that really helps. But I always remember
what a great actress told me once. Inspiration is a capricious
goddess, and it is well to have knowledge ready to take her place
in case she should desert one in the hour of need."</p>

<p>"Does she ever desert in the hour of need? It always seemed to
me that inspiration came with the desperate need."</p>

<p>"Ah, you know all about it," she said, and went on with the
questioning air of a child. "The captain told me your name. You are
the artist, are you not?"</p>

<p>He could not help being pleased at the indirect compliment which
her use of the definite article conveyed.</p>

<p>"I know all about you," she went on. "My uncle, Professor Viall,
bought one of your pictures two years ago from a dealer in England.
It is a desolate little hit of landscape&mdash;an autumn evening, a
wintry-looking pool, with sedges and rushes bending over it, and
dying leaves floating upon its surface. I like the picture, but it
always makes me melancholy."</p>

<p>"I think the picture is called 'A Pool of Melancholy,'" he said.
"I remember it very well. I am glad that your uncle liked it, and
still more glad that it pleases you; but I am sorry that it makes
you sad."</p>

<p>"I like everything that is sad," she answered. "It is my
temperament. I adore moonlight; I love grey skies, and wintry
effects, and autumnal tints, and melancholy music&mdash;all that is
flickering, vague, and suggestive. It is the temperament of the
artist. You have it too."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"By your face&mdash;your eyes&mdash;something&mdash;I can't tell
you what. I have my intuitions I can always tell beforehand whether
I shall like people or things."</p>

<p>"Is it your intuition that you will like England and the
English, might one ask? Or perhaps you have been there
already?"</p>

<p>"No, I have never yet been there."</p>

<p>"Shall you like it?"</p>

<p>"Like it? I love it!"</p>

<p>"But you don't know England."</p>

<p>"Don't I? Yes, indeed I do. Why it's the home and the cradle of
all my race&mdash;the old dead-and-gone ones I mean. I feel like a
girl going home."</p>

<p>"He knew a scholar once," said Lendon gravely, "who said that
when be first went to Greece&mdash;and he wasn't a young man then,
far from it&mdash;he felt that he had long been an exile, and that
now he had come home."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, thoughtfully, "I think I can understand. I
think I shall perhaps feel like that when I stand by some quiet
English stream."</p>

<p>"What do you most wish to see in England?"</p>

<p>"A stream, a country churchyard&mdash;the churchyard in
Stratford perhaps, or the Gray's Elegy one&mdash;and an old castle.
And I want to hear the nightingale&mdash;Matthew Arnold's
nightingale."</p>

<p>"Don't you want to see the Queen, and to be presented at Court?"
he asked, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Oh no; I haven't thought about it. Why should I?"</p>

<p>"I thought that every American girl was like that."</p>

<p>"I am not every American girl. But you must not believe in the
caricatures of American girls. You must not disparage my
countrywomen."</p>

<p>"I greatly admire your countrywomen."</p>

<p>"I am glad," she said simply.</p>

<p>"Well, tell me what other things you want to see and hear in
England."</p>

<p>"No; we have got out of tune, I think." She sank back in her
chair with a little sigh as if she were disappointed. He felt a
pang of something like guilt. How had he jarred upon her? He
wondered if he ought to go away. In fact, he moved a few steps
towards the bulwarks, and then came back. A movement of hers, an
ineffectual effort to tuck her buffalo robe a little more closely
round her, gave him an excuse for going to her aid. "Thank you,"
she said, and was silent again. He lingered. Presently she asked
abruptly, "Do you know Miravoglia?"</p>

<p>"Miravoglia?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"The artist, the musician, the person who trains young
actresses. I am going to him. He saw me act once, at Philadelphia,
and he was impressed. He advised me. Now I am going to take his
advice. Then I was not of age, and my guardian, Professor Viall,
had an objection to my going on the stage; but during these two
years I have done my best to train myself."</p>

<p>"And your guardian has relented?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he had no very rooted objection; it was on psychological
grounds. My uncle is a great psychologist. Lately he has been so
much occupied with his new invention that he has not thought much
of me."</p>

<p>"And what is the invention?"</p>

<p>"You haven't heard of it? But you soon will, and won't forestall
my uncle's pleasure in describing it to you. We are sure to meet in
London."</p>

<p>"There are many eddies and currents in London society," said
Lendon. "How can I be certain of such good fortune?"</p>

<p>"But you, are an artist; and I&mdash;I am an artist, Miravoglia
is an artist. All artists know each other in London&mdash;at least,
so Mrs. Walcot Valbry tells me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, I know Mrs. Walcot Valbry," said Lendon.</p>

<p>"There. Did I not say? We shall meet at Mrs. Walcot Valbry's. I
have known her in America, of course. She adores artists, and she
is interested in everything that is mystic and out of the common.
Therefore, naturally, she is interested in my uncle."</p>

<p>"And you?" asked Lendon. "Are you a mystic too?"</p>

<p>The girl seemed to consider for a moment, and looked at him
seriously with a certain questioning in her eyes.</p>

<p>It was clear to him, however, that she was not in doubt as to
her own views on the subject, but rather as to the manner in which
ho might receive them.</p>

<p>"Everyone is a mystic," she answered gravely. "Everyone, that
is, who feels and thinks, and analyzes feelings and
thoughts&mdash;artists most peculiarly so. Surely you must often
have been conscious of forces within you which base come from
outside yourself?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said, "that is true; and more than once I have solved
the mystery of some unaccountable impulse, some prompting to evil,
by the exploded theory of ghostly possession. Ghosts Do you know
Ibsen's fine lines?"</p>

<p>"Yes;" and she recited, with a dramatic intensity which took him
by surprise, Mrs. Alving's speech to the Pastor.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "it is the ghosts of dead faiths, dead
conventions, dead traditions, which turn us this way and that, and
more or less determine our lives."</p>

<p>"I did not mean such forces as those," she replied. "No, I would
allow no dead faith to rule my life. I meant, Mr. Lendon, that you
and I ought to be proud and happy that we are artists; for Art is
the door through which the undying dead ones can come into our
lives and teach us how to move our world as they themselves once
moved theirs. If ever I am a great actress, as indeed I think I
shall be some day, it will not be I myself who have any power, but
the ghosts who have given to me of theirs."</p>

<p>"That is a fanciful theory, Miss Brett," said Lendon.</p>

<p>"Don't you think that it may be a morbid one?"</p>

<p>"Morbid I Oh! morbid!" she repeated with fine scorn. "I hate
that word morbid. It is such a cant phrase. I suppose that all the
people of genius, in the world or out of it, who ever moved souls
to enthusiasm were told at some time or other, by some wise person
or other, that they were&mdash;morbid. Pray Heaven give me
morbidness! That is all I say."</p>

<p>"No! no!" he exclaimed; "I won't say Amen to that impious
supplication."</p>

<p>She laughed. "Well," she said, "I think I shall go down to my
cabin, for I am feeling a little shivery; and if you will take me
as far as the companion, I shall be grateful."</p>

<p>He gave her his arm, and took charge of her rug and various
other belongings.</p>

<p>"But you will let me convince you, some time soon, that I meant
no disrespect to genius by refusing to allow that it is
morbid?"</p>

<p>She nodded and laughed again. "You don't mean it; you don't mean
it!" she cried. "You mean just what I mean, only you call it by
another name. You are just as bad as the worst of them, if you like
to put it in that way. You're just as open to&mdash;to influences
and impulses and misdirected enthusiasms as the people you pretend
to despise. Why, you are utterly morbid, or you could never have
painted 'The Pool of Melancholy.'"</p>

<p>"There's something in that," said Lendon to himself, as he paced
the deck, after he had seen her to the door of her cabin. "The
curse of the artist temperament is on me as fatally almost as upon
Miss Beatrice Brett herself."</p>

<p>He watched for the young actress for the rest of the day, but
she did not reappear. Nor was she on deck at promenade time the
following morning. It irked him to remember that in forty-eight
hours they were due at Southampton. He put artfully veiled
questions to his communicative neighbour at <i>table d'hote</i>;
and having set him on the trail, very soon elicited through him the
information that Miss Brett had caught a slight cold, and was not
likely to show herself above while the weather continued stormy. It
had come on to blow again, and Lendon began to think the Fates were
against any practical outcome from his already strong interest in
the young actress.</p>

<p>He found her at last, however, in the reading-room, where she
was sitting very becomingly, muffled in furs and with a book in her
hand. She smiled and bowed, and, in answer to his inquiries, told
him she was better, and that she had caught cold, and was suffering
from hoarseness. "And you know," she added, "an actress is bound to
be careful of her voice, for it is the best part of her stock in
trade."</p>

<p>She asked him when they should get in, and he told her that it
would be late that night, and ventured to inquire whether any one
would meet her, and if he might presume on his acquaintanceship
with her friend Mrs. Walcot Valbry, and offer his help in the
Custom Rouse, which, as he put it, was an awkward business for a
lady who was not very strong.</p>

<p>"Oh," she answered, "my people wilt be there to meet me, and
they will arrange everything; but thank you all the same."</p>

<p>"I hope," he said, a little shyly, "that I may look forward to
being presented to Professor Flail."</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," she answered: "if you know Mrs. Walcot Valbry,
you will see a great deal of my uncle. She has a high opinion of
the Professor and of his discovery."</p>

<p>"Don't think me very ignorant," said Lendon, "but will you tell
me what is your uncle's particular field of scientific
investigation. I don't go in much for that sort of thing," he went
on apologetically; "I think we painters are, of all people, the
narrowest in our sympathies and interests; we shut ourselves up in
our studios, or potter along through aesthetic by-ways, or else cut
ourselves off from everything, as I have done this last year or so,
and go of to the wilds in search of a new sensation."</p>

<p>She looked at him a little wistfully. "I should have thought,"
she said, "that you would have found plenty of sensations in
London."</p>

<p>He laughed. "Well, but your uncle, the Professor, what is his
line?"</p>

<p>"Magnetic-Dynamics," she answered seriously, and then suddenly
laughed like a child at his puzzled look. "Oh, you will find out
all about it soon enough. It is something very important, I assure
you."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt of that. May I call upon you in London? and
perhaps," he went on eagerly, "if you care for pictures and sights,
and that sort of thing, I have friends who would be
delighted&mdash;and I should like to show you my studio when it is
in order again, if you would let me."</p>

<p>"I am going to be dreadfully hard at work," she answered; "but
you are very kind, and, if there's time, I should like it very
much. I should like in any case to see your studio."</p>

<p>He was obliged to be content with this sort of indefinite
promise; and just then the captain came up and began talking to
Miss Brett in German&mdash;a language which she appeared to speak
fluently. He had no further conversation with her before the
arrival at Southampton, and in the hurry and confusion of landing
he lost sight of her, and to his infinite regret had not even the
satisfaction of bidding her good-by.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II. THE IMPROVISATRICE.</h2>

<p>ON the journey from Southampton to London, during which the
image of the young actress obtruded itself somewhat disquietingly,
Lendon assured himself that the serious business of home-coming and
resettling himself in his ordinary routine of occupation would
leave him but little leisure for romantic speculations about Miss
Beatrice Brett. He was a little ashamed of the sudden interest with
which she had inspired him, for he had been indulging of late in a
lofty, philosophic indifference, not to say scorn of the charms of
womanhood, and had made up his mind that for him emotional
disturbance was a matter of the past. He had acted out his drama,
had lived through his disillusionment, as he fancied, and it was
humiliating to find himself as susceptible still to the light of a
pair of bright eyes as ever he had been in the old days before the
first had turned to ashes, and be had gone madly off to the New
World to heal his heart's wound. It was this feeling which made him
determine that he would not think of her, would not make any
special effort to find out her whereabouts, would not call upon
Mrs. Walcot Valbry, would not search the papers for any mention of
the Professor and his discovery in magnetic-dynamics (whatever that
might mean), or of the trumpet praises which pique curiosity as to
any forthcoming <i>débutante</i> on the London stage. As a matter of fact,
he did think a good deal about her, nevertheless, and he never saw
the turn of a particularly slender throat, the shape of an
unusually delicate form, or the back of a golden head in front of
him in a theatre-stall or in the street, without a sudden inward
flutter and desperate, if momentary, wonderment whether at last
kindly chance were about to throw them together. He never did come
across her, however, nor had he any means of finding out where she
lived. He plunged into business and pleasure, and tried to forget
her. One morning it gave him an odd thrill to receive a note from
her, enclosing a card of invitation from Mrs. Walcot Valbry, that
American lady of whom they had spoken, and who was, indeed, well
known in the upper Bohemia of London. The inscription on the card
ran&mdash;</p>

<p class="cpb">"Mrs. Walcot Valbry<br>
At home<br>
Wednesday, February 20th, at 9.30.<br>
Fleetwood House, West Kensington.<br>
To meet Professor Villa (Inventor of the Viall-Motor)<br>
and<br>
Miss Beatrice Brett (the celebrated American
'Improvisatrice')."</p>

<p>The note said&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">DEAR MR. LENDON,<br>
<br>
Do come; though I warn you that I am not inclined to do the
'Improvisatrice,' consciously at any rate, for any one; and I am
not celebrated yet. But, as I told you, I mean to be by-and-by. We
have gotten charming rooms, and I am preparing for my London
<i>début</i>, and sometimes I don't seem to know which is <i>me</i>
and which is&mdash;. Never mind; I'll explain, perhaps, some
day.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Cubison and Professor Viall send their kind regards;<br>
<br>
And I am, yours sincerely,<br>
BEATRICE BRETT.</p>

<p>Lendon despatched a prompt acceptance of Mrs. Walcot Valbry's
invitation. He would have liked to write also to Miss Brett, but
with characteristic carelessness&mdash;or could it be intention?
she had omitted to name the locality of their charming rooms. And
be did not venture upon addressing her at the house of Mrs.
Valbry.</p>

<p>The cultivation of cheap celebrity is a disease in tipper
Bohemia, where patrons and patronised, inviters and invitees, have
their very being, socially and commercially, in the easily bought
advertisement which sells their wares and trumpets them into a
third-rate notoriety. Mrs. Walcot Valbry was rich enough to despise
paragraphists; nevertheless, paragraphists abounded at her "at
Home;" and representative Bohemia&mdash;mummers, novelists, poets,
artists, dilettanti members of parliament, and sensation-hunting
visitants from a more aristocratic sphere, made a brave show in the
spacious drawing-rooms. Just outside the most prominent door, Mrs.
Walcot Valbry herself, large, bediamonded, with the crisp, abundant
white hair and yellow crumpled face familiar to the casual
traveller in the parlours of New York hotels, stood, and in an
absent manner received her guests.</p>

<p>As Lendon came on to the landing she was saying, "You are
interested in the Viall-Motor?" to a young-old society man, with a
tired expression and a neatly trimmed Vandyke beard, who
counter-queried&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is the Viall-Motor?"</p>

<p>"Well, I did presume <i>you</i> knew that, Sir Donald!" replied
the American lady, severely. "The Viall-Motor is&mdash;everything.
It's science; it's religion; it's Bulwer Lytton's grill;" and she
shook hands vaguely at the same time with Lendon, adding, "You know
Professor Viall and Miss Beatrice Brett, don't you? I needn't
present you."</p>

<p>"Is it the Viall-Motor or the Improvisatrice that brings you
here, Lendon?" said the gentleman called Sir Donald, drawing Lendon
back into a recess on the other side of the door.</p>

<p>"Both," returned Lendon, laconically.</p>

<p>"A combination of science and beauty!" Lendon's eyes roved. "You
are looking for her. We are at the wrong door. She is in the inner
room, which our hostess guards. By the way, you haven't forgotten
that you sup with me at twelve to-night?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" Lendon had indeed forgotten.</p>

<p>"Would it be possible to transfer the attraction from here to my
house in Eaton Square? Please present me by-and-by."</p>

<p>"At once if you wish it."</p>

<p>"No; I am glued to the door till Countess Adrian arrives."</p>

<p>"Countess Adrian! The lady of the lawsuit?"</p>

<p>"The lady who has been the victim of a cowardly and infamous
husband&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"But the marriage was declared invalid," said Lendon,
thoughtlessly. "Wasn't it the general opinion that Countess
Adrian&mdash;as she still seems to call herself&mdash;was playing a
bold game?"</p>

<p>"Stop!" said Sir Donald, with scarcely a change of inflexion in
his apathetic voice. "I had better tell you that Countess Adrian
has honoured me by consenting to become my wife."</p>

<p>"Urquhart! A million pardons. I read the report of the trial in
America, and you know what newspapers are there. I spoke as I had
no right to speak&mdash;on the vaguest impression. How can I prove
my regret?"</p>

<p>"By letting me present you to Countess Adrian when she comes,
and by forgetting everything to her disadvantage that you have ever
heard," replied Urquhart graciously. "See, there is a rift in the
crowd, and if I am not mistaken the Improvisatrice wishes you to
pay your respects."</p>

<p>"Lendon," whispered Phil Bonhote, a young journalist, who at the
moment pressed up against him, "if they grow them like this I shall
take shares in the Viall-Motor."</p>

<p>Lendon's heart gave a bound as he suddenly became aware that
Beatrice Brett was close to him, that she was smiling seriously at
him, and, by an almost unnoticeable movement of her small hand, was
beckoning him to approach. His first feeling was a sort of surprise
and dazzlement that she was so much more beautiful than even love's
memory had painted her. Of course he had never before seen her in
evening dress, and her throat and arms were finely formed and had
the whiteness&mdash;not of marble, but of a stephanotis petal.
There was about her a girlish radiance which he had not associated
with her on the steamer. Her eyes were alight as if with some
secret fire, her golden hair was dressed in a more elaborate
fashion; she swayed nervously to and fro a great feather fan, and
in the same hand, held with the fan, she carried a bunch of lilies
of the valley tied loosely in the American manner with a knot of
white ribbon. He found himself wondering seriously what young
admirer had sent her the flowers, and then he realised suddenly
that he was in love with her&mdash;in love with this girl to whom
he had only spoken twice before in his life.</p>

<p>She was quite unembarrassed. She was not in love with him. Oh,
no; she was not the sort of girl to fall of a sudden in love with
anyone. She was devoted to her art, for one thing. She was at the
age, of the temperament, in the mood when art and ambition are
consuming passions and allow but little play to any more strictly
human emotion. Of course, as indeed he had hinted, she was inclined
to be morbid, and she was self-analytical, and cold as a vestal,
but yet she had a keen artistic curiosity and she was very sweet
and very womanly, though she tried to persuade herself and others
that she was an altogether abnormal creature. She was interested in
his ardent admiration, and on the whole she was touched and excited
and altogether glad to see him once more.</p>

<p>Somebody stepped up before Lendon and kept her for a moment or
two in conversation. There appeared to be a sudden stir and
excitement in her neighbourhood, and when Lendon moved eagerly
forward, though she smiled again, she made a slight movement as if
bidding him wait. He saw that Mrs. Walcot Vary was holding her hand
persuasively and speaking in a low tone as if urging her to comply
with some request. Mrs. Valbry was struck by the expression of the
girl's eyes and the sweet smile of recognition directed towards
some further object, and her look following that of Beatrice
encountered Lendon.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she exclaimed, "here's somebody who knows the people and
will tell you it is all for your advantage. Mr. Lendon, we want the
weight of your influence. Come along."</p>

<p>Lendon approached and took Beatrice's hand. "What is my
influence required for?" he asked. "Miss Brett, I hope that your
cold is quite well."</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you," she replied frankly. "I told you we should
meet here; but you know you haven't got any influence; we don't
think alike. If I do what they want, you'd say I am morbid."</p>

<p>"That unlucky word," said Lendon, "I take it back. I know what
Mrs. Walcot Valbry means. Cosway Keele is here, and half-a-dozen of
the principal critics. Don't recite unless you are quite sure of
yourself, and unless you want to be the talk of the Garrick
to-night, and to be in all the society papers of the week."</p>

<p>"That's what I've been saying to the Professor," said Mrs.
Walcot Valbry, "he says she is sure of herself."</p>

<p>A tall loan gentleman standing by had poked his head forward and
was scrutinizing Lendon with interest. "You hear Mr. Lendon's
opinion," Mrs. Valbry said; "you see it is important."</p>

<p>"Very important," he assented, and added interrogatively, "Mr.
Lendon?</p>

<p>"Mr. Lendon is hand-and-glove with the critics. He writes plays
himself sometimes, and he designs Cosway Keele's costumes. You two
haven't met yet. Why, it's lovely for you to meet here. He's just
lovely," she added vaguely, her eyes fixed upon a point halfway
between the tall gentleman and the painter, so that it was not
directly evident to which she referred.</p>

<p>"Professor Viall, Mr. Lendon. Professor Viall is Miss Brett's
uncle."</p>

<p>Lendon bowed and shook hands, first with the Professor and then
with a small lady beside him, whom the Professor introduced as "My
sister, Mrs. Cubison."</p>

<p>Miss Brett's guardians presented a curious contrast to one
another. The Professor was a man of about sixty, with straight
iron-grey hair, a very long nose, and an even disproportionately
long upper lip and chin. His forehead was high and narrow. His
height could not have been less than six feet four or five inches,
and with his narrow shoulders&mdash;one a little lower than the
other&mdash;and his spare frame, he made one think somehow of an
ill-balanced obelisk; whereas his sister, Mrs. Cubison, resembled
nothing so much as a fat pouter pigeon, so short was she, so plump
and so common, place and comforting.</p>

<p>"Oh, she's always sure of herself," said Mrs. Cubison. "There's
no fear of Beaty's breaking down. <i>They</i> always carry her
through."</p>

<p>"Then why should there be so much fuss?" said Mrs. Walcot
Valbry. "You are going to do it, Beatrice?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the girl, composedly; "I am going to do it."</p>

<p>"That's right. Now you'll astonish us all. I'll leave you to
look after her, Mr. Lendon&mdash;you and the Professor, for I see
some new people coming," and she hurried of to her station at the
door.</p>

<p>The Professor was not thinking just now of Beatrice. "Why, it's
Maddox Challis,' he said, craning his head.</p>

<p>"Maddox Challis!" repeated Lendon. "I thought he was in
Palestine."</p>

<p>"I mean the Occultist," said the Professor, with the deepest
interest. "Do you know him?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;yes," Lendon answered. "Every one knows Maddox
Challis&mdash;in one sense. In another, no one knows him."</p>

<p>"That is true," assented the Professor. "The ordinary London
diner-out would not know Maddox Challis."</p>

<p>"Mr. Lendon is not the ordinary London diner-out," said Beatrice
Brett.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said. A glance of sympathy passed between them.
"Did you mean," he asked, "that you are really going to play the
Improvisatrice; and since Mr. Walcot Valbry put you in my charge,
tell me what I am to do."</p>

<p>"Take me to some place where I can be quiet for a few minutes,"
she answered.</p>

<p>He gave her his arm, and piloted her across the room. "I may
talk to you some time this evening?" he asked. "I have so much I
want to say to you, and then there's the visit to my studio, we
must arrange that."</p>

<p>She looked troubled and preoccupied and withdrew her arm,
standing still before him. "I can't think of anything now, but what
I am going to do. I don't know why I want to do it, but I can't
help it; it's been in me all day, making me so restless."</p>

<p>Mrs. Walcot Valbry, who had rejoined the Professor, came up with
him at that moment and put Beatrice's arm within hers as she
whispered something in the girl's ear.</p>

<p>"Yes, I will come," said Beatrice. She turned to Lendon with a
look he had never yet seen on her face&mdash;a hushed, breathless,
awed look, and said in a very low voice:</p>

<p>"I made sure I wouldn't net to-night, but it's stronger than I
am. Wait; talk to you by and by."</p>

<p>She moved on, led by Mrs. Walcot Valbry, and passed between the
heavy velvet curtains that divided a farther room from that in
which most of the guests were assembled. The crowd was very dense;
and on Mrs. Valbry's reappearance, there was a momentary silence,
and presently the word went round that the Improvisatrice was about
to do one of the inspirational scenes for which she was already
celebrated in America. The dramatic stars who were present looked
at each other, at once interested and contemptuous. Two
actor-managers simultaneously changed their positions and crossed
to where they would be more advantageously placed for seeing the
performance. Miravoglia, who had helped to train Aimée Deselées,
said aloud, "I know her; she is my pupil. Inspiration! Dead
spirits! Bah! I say that is living genius."</p>

<p>As the assemblage stood waiting, with eyes bent towards the
closed curtain, there was a rustle of heavy brocade near the door,
an announcement distinctly audible, "Countess Adrian," and then
that sudden stir of heads and shoulders which tells of an instantly
diverted curiosity. Lendon turned too, and for the first time saw
the woman whom, somewhat less than a year ago, a <i>cause
célèbre</i> had made famous.</p>

<p>Was she beautiful? No. He remembered vaguely to have heard her
described as "La belle Laide." She was far too large, too tall, too
bounteously made for beauty. But then, how perfectly she was
proportioned, and what a graceful snake-like way she had of moving,
and what a grand carriage of bead and magnificence of bust! Her
eyes were too close together. But the eyes I Surely they might have
illustrated Professor Viall's theory of Magnetic Dynamics. They
were all pupil and yellow light. When the pupil dilated, there was
nothing else; when it contracted, the iris showed queer golden
gleams, like those in the eyes of some savage animal, Her features
were too irregular. But what matter of that, when they were so full
of power and passion? And who cared that the rich red lips, parted
so as to show a double row of small glistening teeth, were so red
and so ripe as to suggest sense rather than soul? Soul somehow was
the last attribute one would associate with Countess Adrian. A
glorious creature certainly&mdash;an intellectual creature&mdash;a
creature with will, emotion, force of diameter, noble instinct it
might be; but always of the flesh, and not of the spirit. Countess
Adrian a disembodied thing! That splendid, glowing vitality
quenched for ever! Impossible!</p>

<p>She was dressed peculiarly in a gown of some stiff red,
expensive fabric, that hung in massive folds about her. The jewels
she wore were barbaric looking&mdash;a great uncut ruby at her
breast, and valuable cats-eyes, set in diamonds, on her neck and in
her black hair. She carried a big fan of deep yellow ostrich
feathery, with glittering sticks.</p>

<p>"It isn't really safe to come to houses like this, though they
are amusing," observed a thin woman in a tiara, on Lendon's right.
She was a great lady, to whom the Improvisatrice had acted as a
"draw."</p>

<p>"I used to know her in Paris&mdash;every one did, till it was
discovered that she was a fraud&mdash;no more married to Count
Adrian than I am. Of course, nobody can know her now."</p>

<p>Lendon murmured something about her being a victim to
circumstances.</p>

<p>"Victim to fiddlesticks!" pursued the irate great lady. "Do you
suppose she didn't know that sham ceremony meant nothing? Does she
look as if a nincompoop like Adrian could bamboozle her?"</p>

<p>The argument seemed unanswerable. Just then there was a cry of
"Silence, please!" and the drawn curtains disclosed Beatrice
Brett.</p>

<p>Is this Beatrice Brett&mdash;this strange woman, cowering in the
stillness of absolute misery, unconscious of herself, unconscious
of her surroundings&mdash;blank despair in her eyes, blank despair
on her white mask-like features, despair and doom in the rigid lips
and the tense limbs? She is alone in the condemned cell. Death on
the scaffold to-morrow, or death to-night by the poison which was
her lover's last gift&mdash;which? And now she moves&mdash;memory
awakes. The past comes back. The drama is re-enacted. She lives
again through dead days&mdash;the convent, the marriage&mdash;a
lamb led to slaughter&mdash;one more maiden sacrificed to the
elderly debauchee. Then, love&mdash;white in its bud, red passion
in its growth. Temptation. Crime. She secretly kills the loathed
husband. And now there is no barrier between her and the man of her
heart&mdash;the man who, honouring her, will not gain her through
dishonour...All this in broken soliloquy and gesture&mdash;quiet at
first, girlishly tender, piteously human; and then, always
repressed, reaching the climax of a tragedy, than which no tragedy
could be more grim. It is the moment in which her lover's arms
first clasp her as his promised bride. His kiss is on her lips. She
trembles with a holy ecstasy...Ah!...It is Hell, not Heaven!
Rapture becomes horror unimaginable. The punishment is from beyond
the grave. A ghost has come forth to be its own avenger. The arms
which encircle her are <i>dead</i> arms. The lips that press hers
are the lips of a corpse, It is her murdered husband who, embodied
in her living lover, claims her for his wife...She kneels. She
cries for mercy. In her agony, the horrible confession is made. And
now, silence...</p>

<p>A long breath of pent emotion heaved through the audience.
Lendon became conscious of a movement behind him. A woman's voice
whispered in an audible sibilant whisper, "She shalt feel me." He
turned involuntarily. Countess Adrian was standing with her head
bent a little forward, and her eyes fixed in a gaze of the most
extraordinary intensity on the young actress's face.</p>

<p>There was nothing malignant in the look. It expressed thoughtful
curiosity and eager desire of dominance, such as might be been in
some wrestler, not certain of mastery, who, calculating his
resources, calls will-force to his aid in a supreme effort for
victory.</p>

<p>If Countess Adrian's object were to test her power by quenching
the girl's inspiration and forcing her soul back to the realm of
commonplace, she succeeded in her attempt. No words came to break
the pause. The actress gave a long shiver. Life and light went out
of her face. The guilty woman, in her passion of love and terror
and remorse, had vanished. There remained a shrinking child, dazed
by some bewildering sight or sound, helpless and incapable. She
tottered; a low moaning cry broke from her lips, and she fell
forward insensible.</p>

<p>Lendon leaped to his feet and, forcing himself to the front,
reached the prostrate girl just as Professor Viall, with quiet
presence of mind, stepped within the arch and drew down the heavy
curtains. Lendon knew nothing for a moment but that he was holding
her in his arms, and that her golden hair brushed his face. People
pressed into the room. There were confused inquiries and
ejaculations, and a doctor proffered his services. But Professor
Viall waved them all away with an authoritative air&mdash;all
except one man, who held his place, also as if with authority, and
who looked at the young actress as she lay in Lendon's arms with an
expression of thoughtful interest.</p>

<p>"This is not an ordinary seizure," he said quietly. "If you will
allow me to try some magnetic passes, I think I can do good, My
name is Maddox Challis, and I um supposed to have some skill in the
higher magnetism."</p>

<p>"The name and works of Maddox Challis are very familiar to me,"
said the Professor. "It has long been my wish to meet one of whom I
have read and heard so much, and with whose pursuits I am to a
certain extent identified, for I also am a humble student of
Occultism. I have been accustomed to use magnetism in the treatment
of my niece, and I now readily yield to a higher power than
mine."</p>

<p>Maddox Challis bowed only in reply to the Professor's elaborate
address, and, opening the door of the tiny boudoir which led out of
the room in which they were, motioned to Lendon to carry his burden
thither. Presently the girl was lying upon a sofa, with Mrs.
Cubison loosening her dress and Mr. Challis making passes over her,
extending and drawing back his arms slowly every now and then with
a jerky movement of his fingers, plucking, as it were, something
invisible from her and throwing it away. She revived almost
immediately. The deathly look left her face. She drew a deep sigh
and opened her eyes. They rested on the stranger's face with a
startled gaze but he did not pause for an instant from his
monotonous passes, and after a minute or two the look of
bewilderment gave place to an expression of relief, and with
another sigh she again closed her eyes. A faint flush crept into
her cheek, and her breathing became soft and regular. Maddox
Challis discontinued his passes. He laid his hand for a moment on
the girl's forehead, then, without a word, left the room.</p>

<p>The Professor seemed disappointed. His eyes followed Challis
till the door closed, then he turned and watched Beatrice.</p>

<p>"She will be all right now," he said. "I presume it was the
mixed magnetism that upset her."</p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Cubison, mysteriously; "it was the influences.
She encourages them. I'm sure I don't wonder, considering what they
do for her. It might have been Rachel who controlled her, you know.
I never saw her finer than she was to-night."</p>

<p>"Influences?" repeated Lendon in a puzzled tone.</p>

<p>"You're not troubled with them?" remarked Mrs. Cubison,
composedly.</p>

<p>"No," answered Lendon.</p>

<p>"Ah, perhaps you don't come of an inspirational family, as we
do. It has its drawbacks. Beaty's mother used to suffer from
influences. Hers weren't always satisfactory. They had a very bad
effect on Beaty's mother," Mrs. Cubison added, and paused.</p>

<p>"They drove her out of her mind," said the Professor,
drearily.</p>

<p>"But, good Heavens! you don't mean that there is any danger?"
exclaimed Lendon.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know that I can explain," began the
Professor.</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't mind Mr. Lendon," put in Mrs. Cubison. "He's
inspirational himself&mdash;in a certain sense. All artists must be
inspirational, you know, more or less, and of course they attract
artistic spirits into their sphere."</p>

<p>Lendon laughed. "Do you mean that the influences are dead
people?" he asked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cubison nodded. The Professor stroked his long upper
lip.</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," he said, "Of course, there's danger; but
what's the use of worrying over what part of your temperament? We
have the misfortune to be a family of mediums. It is a
disease&mdash;hereditary, like consumption and other things. I've
got over it. The Viall-Motor helped me through. Acting will be
Beaty's safeguard. Her mother was an idle woman, and she fell in
love and died in an asylum. Beaty is different. As long as she
keeps real grip on her work she has nothing to be afraid of."</p>

<p>"Nothing to be afraid of!" Lendon repeated vaguely.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she'll come all right," pursued the Professor. "They
wont hurt her while she sticks to Art. The danger is of her falling
in with some living influence that might prove stronger than the
dead ones."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;if she should marry?" timidly suggested
Lendon.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know that I meant that altogether. She'll have to
take her chance anyhow. What is to be, will be, you know," answered
the Professor, with cheerful fatalism. "It would be curious,
wouldn't it, if one could know which of them it was to-night," he
added, as if an idea had struck him&mdash;"Rachel or Siddons, or
perhaps poor Aimée Desclées?"</p>

<p>"Ah," said Lendon again, with his little laugh, which was half
nervous, "I have no doubt any of our young actresses would gladly
run some risk for the sake of being able to summon such
distinguished persons as familiar spirits."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose they would be at the beck of <i>any</i> young
actress? My dear sir," said the Professor solemnly, "perhaps you
don't remember Schiller's description of certain exceptional
natures for which 'too easily is ripped open the kingdom of the
ghosts'&mdash;that's the literal translation, I believe. Those
words are another phrase for genius. What <i>is</i> genius?" he
went on fervidly. "<i>She</i> hasn't got it" (indicating Mrs.
Cubism, who was preening herself in her pouter-pigeon fashion).
"<i>I</i> haven't got it. <i>You</i> haven't got it&mdash;at least,
I beg your pardon, but I should guess not. My niece has it, though;
and it's nothing but the unconscious power of access to the highest
influences of the past&mdash;a power as rare as are the Talmas and
the Siddons themselves. It's be open door through which these
bodiless beings from the other side can enter into oar world
again&mdash;the body by which they can vent their unsatisfied
cravings and pent-up aspirations. Art is a passion as high and as
low as other passions. I have no doubt it was a satisfaction to
poor Desclées&mdash;if it was she&mdash;to hear again the applause
that was once her nightly food." He paused, for at this moment the
girl stirred. "We'll talk of this some other time," he said.</p>

<p>Beatrice raised herself as he spoke, and looked at him with
steady eyes. She seemed now to have pike recovered from her strange
attack. "I will talk to Mr. Lendon," she said. "Uncle, I want you
to go back to those people and tell them&mdash;oh, tell them
anything. They've seen enough to show them I <i>can</i> act. They
won't want me any more. Let us go home when you have explained why
I fainted."</p>

<p>"Why <i>did</i> you faint, Beaty?" Mrs. Cubison questioned, when
the Professor bad, without further words, left the room.</p>

<p>She gave a shudder and looked at Lendon. "Who is that woman?"
she asked, taking no notice of her aunt. "Countess Adrian," he
answered at once.</p>

<p>"I knew that you would know. Is she a friend of yours?"</p>

<p>"She is going to marry a friend of mine," he replied. The girl
was silent.</p>

<p>"But you haven't told its why you fainted, Beaty," said Mrs.
Cubison.</p>

<p>"Nor ever shall, I fancy, Marmy dear, for that's one of the
mysterious things in earth and heaven that are beyond my
understanding." She got up from the sofa as she spoke, and, going
to the mantel-piece by which Lendon was standing, leaned her elbow
upon it and stood looking at him with a troubled, questioning
expression. He uttered some anxious words about her health, but she
stopped him.</p>

<p>"No, never mind. I'm quite well now Mr. Lendon, would you do
something for me?"</p>

<p>"I would do anything in this world for you," he answered
fervently.</p>

<p>She blushed and drooped her eyes, and for the first time a
delicious hope dawned within him.</p>

<p>"Will you ask Countess Adrian to leave me alone?"</p>

<p>"But you have strength to overcome this fancy," he began
vehemently.</p>

<p>"It is no fancy; it's something real." She shuddered again. "If
Countess Adrian came to the theatre and looked at me like that when
I was acting, I should break down&mdash;as I did to-night. And I
think that would kill me. My art is all the world to me. I live for
it; I live in it. Mr. Lendon&mdash;no, don't speak, listen&mdash;I
have a feeling that <i>you</i> could stand between one and&mdash;and
Countess Adrian."</p>

<p>"Between you and everything that could vex or harm you, if you
would only let me. I can&mdash;and I will. Miss Brett, trust
me."</p>

<p>She put out her band and let him hold it in his for a
moment.</p>

<p>"Yes, I will trust you. I can't tell you now all that I want to
say. You must go to the others, and we will go home. Good
night!"</p>

<p>"But I may come to you?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes. Marmy will be glad, and so shall I. In the evenings,
please. I'm working all day. Miravoglia is directing my lessons.
Marmy will give you the address."</p>

<p>Mrs. Cubison took out a card from her pocket-book and gave it to
him. The young man received it as though it had been a key to the
gates of Paradise&mdash;as indeed it seemed to his excited fancy
just then. And then be bade them good night.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III. A MODERN MYSTIC.</h2>

<p>A STRONG impression had been created by Miss Beatrice Brett's
performance, which its abrupt and somewhat tragic termination
appeared to have strengthened rather than lessened. The party broke
up 'very soon afterwards, and Mrs. Walcot Valbry had the agreeable
conviction of having furnished Bohemia with a sensation. Later on,
the subject was freely discussed at Sir Donald Urquhart's supper. A
good many of Mrs. Walcot Valbry's guests had gone on to Eaton
Place. Miravoglia was there, revelling in a peculiarly choice
preparation of Neapolitan maccaroni, which was one of the features
of these repasts. Miravoglia would dine or sup at no house where
there was not maccaroni. A certain distinguished actor-manager was
there&mdash;that same Cosway Keele of whom Mrs. Valbry had spoken.
Cosway Keele's approval was highly coveted by young actors and
actresses. Another actor-manager of lesser distinction was there
also. So was the chief interviewer on the staff of an important
weekly paper; and so, too, was the editor of a popular society
journal&mdash;a gentleman 'versed in traditions of the drama, who
did not scruple to declare that he saw in the young American a
coming Rachel. The secondary actor-manager plied Miravoglia with
questions about the Improvisatrice in the intervals of maccaroni
and draughts of Chianti. Cosway Keele smiled to himself in a
brooding manner. It was quite evident that managerial curiosity had
been baited.</p>

<p>Among the guests less directly interested, conversation soon
drifted off' to other topics. Sir Donald Urquhart's suppers were
always lively and unconventional. They had an agreeably mingled
flavour of the chicory of Bohemia and the mocha of fashion. All the
women were pretty, entertaining, and becomingly dressed. Most of
the men were well bred; all had in some way or other made their
mark. The talk was a finely distilled essence of art, science,
politics, and society. Sir Donald was rich; the appointments of his
house were in perfect taste. Softly shaded electric drops lighted
the rooms. The pictures and bric-a-brac were historic. The
supper-table, with its hothouse flowers, its Venetian glass and
delicate equipments, was a harmony in colour which had been
composed by a Royal Academician. Sir Donald had the reputation of
being a confirmed bachelor, and though he announced his engagement
to Countess Adrian, few of his friends took it seriously. She was
seated at his right; but her attention seemed chiefly directed to
an elderly gentleman next her, with a grey beard, piercing brown
eyes, and an altogether odd and powerful face&mdash;the same person
who had brought back Beatrice Brett to consciousness; no other,
indeed, than the celebrated Maddox Challis, Socialist, mystic,
novelist, and philosopher, who, an ascetic in the East, was in
London one of the wittiest and most agreeable of diners out.
Lendon, who knew him slightly in that phase of his curious
personality, was seated on his other side, and exchanged a few
words with him as Countess Adrian bent forward to speak to some one
across the table.</p>

<p>"You will be glad to hear," he said, "that Miss Brett had quite
recovered when I left her. She was going home with her aunt."</p>

<p>"Ah! yes, I knew she would recover quickly. It was nothing
serious, except in the sense of being an unhappy augury for her
future. She is a very interesting young lady: I should like to see
something more of her."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt that Professor Vial! would be delighted to give
you the opportunity," said Lendon.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, it is impossible. I am on the eve of one of my
pilgrimages to the East. If you know Miss Brett well enough, advise
her to be careful. She will be a great actress, but it may be at
the expense of what is more valuable even than fame."</p>

<p>"You mean that she is too nervous and highly wrought for the
wear and tear of such a career?"</p>

<p>"I mean that she is one of those strange and rarely endowed
beings whose garment of flesh is but a thin and ineffectual shield
against spiritual onslaughts, and who under certain conditions
would be almost defenceless against malignant influences, or even
against a magnetism of a different and more dominant nature than
her own. In the old days such beings were called Sibyls; they were
isolated from contaminating currents, and were guarded by the
priests, who made use of their peculiar gifts as something sacred.
The fashion of Sibyls has gone out, as well as the knowledge that
trained them. Nowadays they are called mediums, and are let loose
upon society to be its destruction and their own."</p>

<p>Countess Adrian leaned back again, and, turning to Challis,
interrupted the conversation.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Mr. Challis, but I have heard nothing so
interesting for a long time as the account of those hypnotic
experiments in Paris. Please go on."</p>

<p>Lendon strained his ears to listen, but at that moment the lady
next him awoke to the fact of his existence, and began questioning
him about his late tour, and the mystic's low-toned utterances lost
themselves in a confused murmur. Countess Adrian appeared to find
them absorbing; she sat forward with her elbow on the table, eating
nothing, and with neither eyes nor ears for any other person.
Presently the babble on Lendon's left set itself in another
direction, and he made out that Mr. Challis and Countess Adrian
were still discussing hypnotism, and the possibility of a strong
vitality absorbing into itself a weaker nature than its own&mdash;a
question in which Countess Adrian seemed intensely interested.</p>

<p>"You mean to say, then," Lendon heard her ask, "that I, for
instance, who have any amount of animal spirits and energy, could,
if I chose to use my will-power, take possession of some peculiarly
sensitive organization and control it in whatever way I
pleased?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly," answered Mr. Challis, "though that too is quite
possible. This is what I meant. Suppose a person of enormous
vitality&mdash;yourself, for example&mdash;suddenly killed by
accident, or it might be by heart-disease?"</p>

<p>"No, no. Oh, don't suppose the one fate of which I have a
terror." Countess Adrian bent eagerly forward, so that Lendon, who
was leaning on the table, his face in her direction, caught her
eyes full. Both drew back, but the conversation continued.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Challis, "let us rot suppose that, since it is
disagreeable to you."</p>

<p>"But tell me the case you were going to put. I know that you
have all sorts of queer ideas and experiences, if you could only be
persuaded. to make them public."</p>

<p>"In this instance nothing could give me greater pleasure, since
you express a desire to hear them. The case in my mind was that of
a strong person, dying suddenly during a paroxysm of violent
emotion, the object of the emotion being a woman of just that
sensitive organization you describe."</p>

<p>"Well, and what then?"</p>

<p>"Don't you see that the intense emotion, the human clinging to
life, would create a force which must be inextinguishable. That
strong individuality could not be blown out in a breath. There was
a moment's physical contact with the weaker frame, and a magnetic
connection was established. Nature works by material as well as by
spiritual law. The stronger soul expelled the feebler, and lived
out the drama in another body."</p>

<p>"Ah! And the poor spirit that was driven forth?"</p>

<p>"Who knows? Perhaps it went to the limbo of unborn souls to wait
for a new garment of flesh."</p>

<p>"What a strange man you are! I understand you, though. See! you
have made Mr. Lendon think us both crazy." She pointedly leaned
forward again, and her eyes purposely met those of Lendon a second
time, as she addressed him. Earlier in the evening Sir Donald had
presented him to her.</p>

<p>"Many people think <i>me</i> crazy," composedly replied Mr.
Challis. "But surely no one would venture to suggest anything so
commonplace of the Countess Adrian. I am going to say good night,"
he added; "for I see that the smoking stage is reached, and to take
one's leave with the second cigarette is like rising during a
sermon before the exordium closes&mdash;a bad compliment to be
avoided. We shall not meet for some time, Countess. I start for
Palestine immediately."</p>

<p>He rose. His wiry grey beard touched her shoulder, as he said
something in a low tone, at which she shook her head and smiled.
Then he glided unobtrusively behind his host's chair, made his
farewell and vanished.</p>

<p>"A remarkable man!" observed. Lendon, taking the vacant
place.</p>

<p>Countess Adrian merely nodded. There was a general stir just
then. Chairs were being pushed back, couples were pairing, and they
were drawing up lounges round the blazing fire in an inner
smoking-room, separated from that in which they had supped by a
screen of Eastern carving. Sir Donald was pressing upon his lady
guests some especially choice Russian cigarettes. He noticed that
Countess Adrian and Lendon had moved from the table together, and
smiled in the indifferent way that with him expressed approval. It
was difficult to realise that he was in love with the lady, but
indifferentism is the hall-mark of a certain type of London
man.</p>

<p>"You'll find it more comfortable in there," he said. "Let me
recommend the liqueur."</p>

<p>Countess Adrian placed herself upon a divan, partially screened
by draperies of Turkish brocade, and looked at Lendon above her
yellow fan. He seated himself also. "I have your permission?" he
asked, fixing his cigarette in its holder.</p>

<p>"Of course. My own sky-parlour is often redolent of smoke, even
at this hour. I live at the very top of Queen Anne's Mansions. Mr.
Lendon, come and see me, won't you? I've a particular reason for
wanting to know more of you."</p>

<p>He expressed his gratification and at the same time his
curiosity as to the reason she spoke of.</p>

<p>"I will tell you," she answered. "I know that you once did a
very noble action to a woman who repaid you with base ingratitude.
I have seen your portrait. I have read some of your letters. You
will understand what I mean when I tell you that circumstances once
brought me into contact with Jessie Harford."</p>

<p>Lendon winced. The episode in his life to which she alluded was
one fall of pain. When much younger, he had fallen romantically in
love with his model&mdash;a young married woman deserted by her
husband, and living a life of temptation that must have inevitably
led to ruin. Lendon saved this woman, for a time at any rate, from
her tempters, from herself, and, it must be added, from his own
worst self also. He could not marry her, and he idealized her too
much to offer her anything less than marriage. For five years he
was her loyal friend. He asked from her no reward. He never spoke
to her of his love, but honestly did his best to live it down. He
found her a companion of her own sex, and placed her in a position
to earn a safe and honourable livelihood. After five years she
betrayed his trust in the basest and most ungrateful manner. Even
still he saw in ha the traces of a better nature; he sought her
out, forgave her, and started her afresh. Again. she deceived him,
and this time sank beyond hope of redemption. It was, he afterwards
learned, during the brief period of her reclamation that Countess
Adrian became acquainted with her.</p>

<p>"And you thought," she said, with a dash of cynicism in her
tone, "that women are to be won by generosity! You are mistaken, my
friend. There are few women with whom a bad man has not a better
chance than a good one; at all events, with whom tyranny hasn't a
better chance than tender devotion."</p>

<p>"I cannot believe that, Countess," Lendon said sadly; "and
anyhow a man can't turn himself into a tyrant, if nature has not
turned him out one, to win the respect of a woman&mdash;of such a
woman."</p>

<p>"Never mind," she said; "I respect and admire you all the same.
I don't believe I should ever care much about a tyrant. I should
railer do all the tyranny myself&mdash;if I could."</p>

<p>She looked sweetly at him, gave a little sigh, and then turned
the conversation on to some other subject, merely reminding him
that he had promised to come to see her in Queen Anne's
Mansions.</p>

<p>Nest day Lendon went to call on Miss Brett. Of coarse, he went
in the evening. As she had told him, Beatrice lived with her
guardian and his sister, not merely in charming rooms, as she had
said in her letter to him, but in a charming house in the Regent's
Park, which Professor Viall had first fallen in love with and then
hired. It was a small ivy-covered house, or rather cottage,
standing in the midst of a little garden and grounds of its own,
just out of one of the avenues of the Park, One might pass and
repass a score of times and never observe that there was an
isolated habitation behind that iron railing. Salisbury Plain could
not give more solitude or more meditation than the dwellers in that
little house could have when once they had got within its
enclosure; and yet they could hear the roar of the lions in the
Zoological Gardens very distinctly every now and then.</p>

<p>Lendon was in luck; Professor Viall and Mrs. Cubison both
happened to be out at the moment of his calling, and ho asked for
Miss Brett, and was told she was at home. He was shown into a
little sitting-room, evidently decorated and arranged by her own
hand; to his quick artistic eye there were manifest touches of her
individuality and her poetic taste everywhere&mdash;and she
received him with the free and cordial welcome of an American girl.
Perhaps if Lendon had been a connoisseur in girls and love-making,
he might have wished for just a little air of embarrassment in her
manner of receiving him&mdash;a faint blush, a fall of the eyelid,
a tremble of the hand.</p>

<p>They plunged into talk, real talk, at once.</p>

<p>"You have a great gift," he said. "Do you know quite what your
gift is?"</p>

<p>"Tell me what you think it is. I don't know much about it, or
how it comes to me, or what it is, or how it is different from the
gift of somebody else."</p>

<p>"You have full possession of that rarest of all dramatic arts,
the art of impersonation. See what most of the men and women on the
modern stage are. They are always just themselves&mdash;in
different parts, in new dresses. Of course, we have some real
actors, men and women who can impersonate. You are destined to a
place with the very highest, for you can create a part utterly
unlike your own individuality; and if you can create one, you can
create twenty."</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said thoughtfully. "My mind seems to work in
two ways. An idea springs up at once, seems almost to spring at me
from the outside, leaps at me like a tiger, and then I put it into
acting; just as I did last night&mdash;until that terrible Countess
Adrian spoiled my work. But at other times I get an idea suggested
to me and I brood and brood over it&mdash;some part, some
character, you know&mdash;and it seems gradually to grow into me,
and I to grow into it, and at last it has full possession of
me&mdash;and then. I know I am right; at least, I know that that is
how I must play the part. Some other woman might have her own
reading, and that might be better for her; bat my idea has grown to
he&mdash;myself."</p>

<p>"What do you think of doing in London? An improvisation or a
play, or both?"</p>

<p>"Both, I think," she answered, somewhat hesitatingly. "I want to
do the improvisation because it is something new and peculiar in
this country; but I don't call it art in any high sense. Do you? It
is something hysteric almost. I want to study a really great part
in a great play, and see if I can do it. But, oh, if I should
fail!&mdash;here in this cold crowded London; if anything&mdash;any
influence should chill me!"</p>

<p>A sudden impression was borne in upon him. "You are thinking of
the Countess Adrian?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied.</p>

<p>In the simplest and most child-like way she put her hand upon
his arm as if appealing to him for protection against some
threatened danger. Ills pulses stirred at the touch; and then again
the touch disheartened him&mdash;it was too purely friendly and
appealing, and her eyes looked into his with all the frankness of
an unspoiled and unconscious school-girl&mdash;if there is such a
creature.</p>

<p>"You must conquer that odd fantasy," he answered, after a
moment's pause, "and you'll not fail; at least, it will not be your
fault&mdash;the fault of your intellect and your genius and your
soul&mdash;if you do fail. But I should be a little afraid about
your nerves and your strength. Too much of such a performance as
last night's would soon wear you out. I fear it would take too much
out of you. You are but a fragile girl, Miss Brett; you need
looking after."</p>

<p>"Yes, I feel very weak sometimes," she said with a
sigh&mdash;"both mentally and physically. I feel as if I should
like to lean on some one. Oh, they are so kind, the Professor and
Mrs. Cubison; but they are so strong and self-contained that they
can't either of them give me just what I need. Am I talking
nonsense and egotism?"</p>

<p>"You are not talking nonsense, and I specially wish to heir you
talk about yourself. Yes; you do need to be looked after, you want
some pillar to lean against.</p>

<p>"But," and here Lendon made a strong effort to master his
emotions, to be not himself&mdash;an effort almost as strong as one
of her own feats of impersonation, "you will find some one to love,
and who will love you and understand you, and he will be the pillar
to lean against." She looked up to him without a gleam of surprise
or a shadow of displeasure on her face; and she answered very
quietly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Mr. Lendon; I don't think so at all. I am too fond of
this calling of mine; I haven't room for any slighter affection. I
couldn't love a man in that way, I am sure; and he would be jealous
of my Art. I am certain. No, there would hardly be space enough in
my life for him and for my Art."</p>

<p>She spoke with as unaffected a directness and simplicity as if
they had only been talking of the fine weather.</p>

<p>"But you can't always lead this lonely kind of life," he
said.</p>

<p>"I am never lonely&mdash;in that sense. Perhaps I could do
better Sometimes if I were more alone."</p>

<p>Lendon felt disappointed. It was clear that she cared nothing
about him; never thought of him in any lover-like sense&mdash;as
yet. All the while he felt more and more in love with her, felt
himself becoming almost painfully absorbed in her.</p>

<p>"Well," he said resolutely, dropping that subject, "I want to
see you create some part in a great play&mdash;something that is
not familiar to our London audiences. That would be better than the
Improvisation. The Improvisation takes too much out of you, I am
sure. And then I feel, with you, that it is hardly Art. Am I too
outspoken in my opinions?"</p>

<p>"Oh no! I delight to hear you tell me whet I ought to do. I am
sure you understand me better than&mdash;most people."</p>

<p>Was she going to say, "Better than any one;" and did she check
herself on the words? Yes, be thought so, and he felt a thrill of
delight.</p>

<p>"I think I understand you better than most people," he said;
"and I think you have not yet got the secret of your own
power&mdash;the talisman to summon it."</p>

<p>"Oh no, I am sure I have not. I cannot tell why I am so strong
and passionate and all aflame when I am possessed of some part, and
why in my common life I am so weak and easily tired, and why I long
to lean on some support. An odd notion comes into my mind
sometimes. I feel as if I had not quite a soul of my own; and that
when I get inspired with some part it is the soul of some one else
which has come in to the help of mine, or has driven mine out for
the moment. You may laugh at me if you like, Mr. Lendon, I shan't
be one bit angry; but I do feel like that sometimes."</p>

<p>"You make me think," Lendon said, "of the Italian legend about
Paganini. Have you ever heard of it?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think I have."</p>

<p>"I forget the details of the story; but the central idea was
that Paganini had contrived, by some unearthly arts, to conjure the
soul of his dying sweetheart into his violin, and that the
marvellous music which the instrument gave out ever after was the
wail of the soul eternally imprisoned within it."</p>

<p>"How strange!" she paid, with a little shudder. "It is an
uncanny story, and yet it fascinates me."</p>

<p>"I want to ask you a favour," he broke off abruptly. "I want you
to let me paint you as you appear in your great character."</p>

<p>"Oh yes," she replied; and for the first time during their talk
a light flush came over her face. "But it shall be on condition,
Mr. Lendon&mdash;yes, I must exact a condition."</p>

<p>"And the condition is?"</p>

<p>"That you find the great part for me."</p>

<p>"That is the very thing I wanted to do; I was going to ask you
to let me look out a part for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall be so delighted! I never could find one for myself;
and I don't think there is any one who could find me a part that I
should trust myself to&mdash;but only you."</p>

<p>"Then you will try the part I find for you?"</p>

<p>"I Will play any part you find for me. I know that I shall make
it my own; I know that it will grow into me, and that I shall grow
into it. Yes, I shall feel absolute trust in your choice, Mr.
Lendon. Why, this is exactly what I was saying, a short time ago,
that I wanted above all other things."</p>

<p>"What is that?" he asked in an embarrassed tone.</p>

<p>"Why, don't you remember?&mdash;an influence to take care of
me&mdash;a pillar to lean against. And now I have my wish granted
all at once. You shall be the influence to take care of me and
guide me; I shall lean against the pillar of your support."</p>

<p>The words were sweet, ineffably sweet, to his ears; although,
most assuredly, they were not words of a girl's love: they told of
trust, and even, perhaps, of affection; but Beatrice Brett was
evidently not thinking of love. "Never mind," he said to himself,
and his heart beat a triumphant measure, "that will come in time; I
know it will."</p>

<p>"Is it not strange," she said softly, "how well I seem to know
you already, and how sure I feel that you will put me in the right
way in my Art and in everything?"</p>

<p>"So then," he said joyously, "this is a compact between us, Miss
Brett?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I am so glad!&mdash;a compact of friendship."</p>

<p>"Of friendship now," he said to his own heart; "of something
better later on."</p>

<p>"But I think I should like you to call me Beatrice," she said;
"it would sound more friendly; it would seem as if I were your
pupil, and you had charge of me."</p>

<p>"Very well," Lendon replied; "Beatrice."</p>

<p>Just then Professor Viall and Mrs. Cubison came in, and the
illumination seemed to go out of the scene for Lendon.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV. THE ACTRESS AT
HOME.</h2>

<p>THE transcendent love-illumination went out; but homelier lights
shed themselves upon the Viall household, and made a little more
clear to Lendon various things which had puzzled him. With an
unconventional friendliness, which seemed to him very un-English,
they insisted upon his staying for their evening meal&mdash;a sort
of high tea of smoking cakes and scolloped oysters, and innocent
beverages which reminded him of repasts in certain Puritan
households in the smaller Massachusetts towns. Both the Professor
and Mrs. Cubison drank many cups of tea; and when the meal was
over, as if to make up for their abstinence from alcoholic
stimulant, they both smoked many cigarettes. It was over the
cigarettes that their hearts expanded, and that they took Lendon
freely into their confidence as to their plans, hopes, prospects,
and family history. Beatrice did not smoke cigarettes, nor was she
equally communicative. She went away for a little while, on the
plea of preparing her morning's lesson for Miravoglia, and when she
came back sat thoughtfully apart with a book which she did not
read. The result of the Professor's and Mrs. Cubison's confidences
was that Lendon mentally decided they were "a queer lot." Perhaps a
wholly unprejudiced observer might not have hesitated to include
Miss Beatrice Brett herself in the sweeping summing up. Lendon;
however, confined his criticism to the Professor, Mrs. Cubison, and
the race of Transatlantic occultists in general, of whose
peculiarities he quickly gleaned something in the conversation of
his new friends. For one thing he learned that "Occultist," as
opposed to "Spiritualist," was the proper term to apply to
enlightened beings possessed of ideas of a supramundane order, and
relating, broadly, to will-force, magnetic healing, inspirational
gifts, and communion with beings from what Professor Viall and Mrs.
Cubison called "the other side." The Professor was careful to
impress upon his auditors that the commonplace wonders of
professional mediums were not to be named in a breath with that
higher spiritual science which had evolved the Viall-Motor, and
that the vulgar sprites of the planchette and the tilted table were
utterly beneath the contempt of one who had been admitted among the
cultured aristocracy of the world of shades.</p>

<p>All this might have seemed less strange and absurd to Lendon,
had be known anything of the mystical backwaters of London society;
but when "Mr. Isaacs" and "The Occult World" had heralded in the
new religion of Theosophy, he had been absorbed in the tragedy of
Jessie Harford; and before the advent of Madame Blavatsky he had
taken ship to South America, and was shooting condors and making
sketches on the lower slopes of the Andes. Thus he was somewhat
behind his time as regards this latest development of modern
thought.</p>

<p>He had read "The Undiscovered Country," however, and soon became
of opinion that it would require the genius of Mr. Howells to do
justice to the complexities of Professor Viall's personality,
Perhaps it was a certain superficial similarity between Miss Brett
and the innocent clairvoyant of that novel that made him at first
lick upon the Professor as a crack-brained charlatan exploiting a
beautiful young victim, whose mental characteristics lent
themselves 'readily to his fraudulent purposes. But before many
days were past he had changed his views; for be discovered that,
not only was the Professor's main and absorbing object the
exploitation of his Viall-Motor, but that he was a rich
man&mdash;rich enough, at any rate, to be an enthusiast without
suspicion of base intentions. He discovered, too, that Miss Brett
herself had an independent fortune, and that she, on her part, was
absorbed by one dream and determination&mdash;that of succeeding in
the dramatic profession, for which she had been carefully trained,
awl that she was merely taking advantage of her uncle and aunt's
chaperonage for the furthering of her own particular scheme of
life. No, if they were queer, they were certainly genuine; and if
they were adventurers, it was not with any notion of gulling the
British public.</p>

<p>As in this evening's talk he learned more of the Professor's
immediate plans and interests, Lendon began to resent in an odd way
the very indifference he seemed to show for Miss Brett's lonely
position, and tin easy manner in which he appeared to take it for
granted that Fate would steer her safely through the troubled
waters of a theatrical career. He could not help saying, when the
Professor spoke of his return to the States as imminent&mdash;</p>

<p>"But surely you will not leave Miss Brett here alone?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" said the Professor calmly. "She has been alone all
her life. She studied by herself in New York and Paris, and I
presume London is no worse a place for a young woman than they are.
Oh, Beaty is very well able to get along, though she looks so
fragile."</p>

<p>"Suppose she should be ill?" said Lendon; "if she should have
another fainting fit, like that of the other night, for
instance?"</p>

<p>"That's true," said the Professor. "I guess she must keep as
clear as she can of mixed magnetism; and if she does get upset, why
there's Mrs. Cubison to look after her. She says it was that
Countess Adrian that affected her. I've given her a good talking
to. I've shown her how she ought to train herself to resist
cross-magnetism: not that I ever knew Beaty affected like that
before," he added thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Lendon glanced at Beatrice, who, while the others were talking,
sat in front of the fire&mdash;for the evenings were very
cold&mdash;her eyes fixed on the flames. By intuition, it seemed,
they turned, as his sought hers, and she smiled a smile of frank,
childlike confidence. His heart thrilled at the thought of this
unspoken understanding. She counted on him to guard her against
real and fancied evil&mdash;against the actual dangers of London,
against the imaginary danger of Countess Adrian. This was what her
look said; and then she turned bank again to the contemplation of
the fire.</p>

<p>"Yes, there's Mrs. Cubison," repeated the Professor; "she'll
nurse her if she is ill, and do the housekeeping, and keep off the
sharks. Marmy is not good for much social business, but she is good
for that."</p>

<p>Mrs. Cubison gave a fat laugh. "I'll do my best," she said,
nodding at Beatrice, who took no notice; "but Beaty is kinder
wilful, and hard to drive."</p>

<p>"Yet, if Miss Brett intends seriously to go on the stage, there
should be some one, should there not, to take care of her
professional interests?" said Lendon.</p>

<p>"Pull the wires, you mean, butter up the critics, tackle the
managers, and supply the newspapers with paragraphs. But <i>we</i> are
independent of wire-pulling, Mr. Lendon. Beaty is a born genius,
and genius don't need bolstering up. She ain't going to bind
herself down body and soul to any manager. She has gone through the
drudgery, and now she means to produce herself. The London managers
will be glad enough to take her on her own terms when they see what
she can do. Her business man will do the dirty work for her; and as
for other things, why I dare say you'll look in sometimes, Mr.
Lendon, and give her and Marmy a bib of advice."</p>

<p>Lendon profited by the invitation, and during the next week or
two made his way very often to the little house in Regent's Park.
His visits were usually timed in the evening or late afternoon, and
on most occasions he found Beatrice alone. Mrs. Cubison was a lady
who evidently enjoyed and made the most of such society as was
within her reach. She had a weakness for matinees at the theatres,
and frequented drawing-room recitals and entertainments, for the
most part got up by enterprising Americans who wanted to air their
special views or to exhibit their special accomplishments. She had
also an immense amount of shopping to do for herself and her
friends, and accounted for her apparent extravagance on the plea
that everything was so dear "on the other side." It must be owned
that Lendon got sometimes a little bewildered among Mrs. Cubison's
figures of speech, and was not always certain whether she meant the
other side of the Atlantic or across the border? of Infinity. Mrs.
Cubison occupied herself a good deal, as well, in visiting her
English or American-English acquaintances. She bad quite a large
circle of friends, none of whom did Miss Beatrice appear to know,
and who seemed for the greater number to live in the remoter parts
of West Kensington and Notting Hill, or in Camden Town, or other
distant regions. Thus it happened that, when she came home late and
found Lendon talking to Beatrice, she seemed glad of the excuse to
absent herself, declaring that Beaty couldn't be dull while he was
there, and that she really must rest her poor head and legs, which
were quite worn out. As for the Professor, he lived principally in
his study when he was at home, and that was seldom: he seemed to be
always flying over the country, to attend some mysterious meeting,
or to consult some scientist, unknown to fame, on matters relating
to the Viall-Motor. Lendon had a very imperfect comprehension or
the properties of the Viall-Motor, shirking explanations with the
Professor as one shirks discussing with its subject the details of
harmless monomania, and amiably accepting it on the authority of
Mrs. Walcot Valbry as something in the way of psychical
electricity&mdash;so she called it&mdash;altogether wonderful and
altogether indefinite, which, when it was completed, would
supersede every other motive force in the world, but about which it
would be time enough to think seriously when it was completed. His
dominant feeling in regard to it at present was one of gratitude
for the opportunities of unrestricted companionship with Beatrice
which it afforded him.</p>

<p>Since the establishment of the compact between them, she seemed
to take it for granted that he was to go and see her when he
pleased; and many times he did so please. She always received him
in her own little sitting-room, where her piano lay open, with its
odd-looking score of vocal exercises on the desk, and which was
strewn with her own particular books&mdash;her Shakespeare (of
course, she held the Baconian theory, and studied the plays by the
light of Mr. Donnelly's Cryptogram, and many a long argument had
she on the subject with Lendon, who fought stoutly for the Bard of
Avon), her dramatic critics, her Lessing, her Diderot, her
Coleridge, her Charles Lamb, her Hazlitt, her George Henry Lewes.
Sometimes they sat in the tiny walled garden, and sometimes they
strolled into the Regent's Park, or even, when she was in a
particularly frivolous mood, found their way to the Zoo.</p>

<p>He was careful not to speak to her of love; he saw that the time
was not yet ripe; and then, too, her attitude towards him seemed as
if intended to convey the impression that they met on a kind of
neutral and shadowy ground, and that she did not belong to his
world, nor he to hers. So far, indeed, he had not even been able to
persuade her to visit his studio; she always made an excuse for
putting off a serious proposition that he ventured to put forward;
nor would she let him do guide-book for her, and show her the
sights of London. She seemed to have an odd shrinking from glare
and society. She lived in her books and her work, and, though shut
out from her in one sense, it was sweet to him to feel that she
allowed him to identify himself with these interests, and that in
the quiet region of Art their spirits might come together. It
pleased her sometimes to play the pupil, and to appeal to him to
direct her reading; and, in truth, he found that, well educated,
even cultured as she was, she had roved in very desultory and
discursive fashion through the field of dramatic literature. He
discovered that she was but poorly acquainted with the Elizabethan
dramatists, and it was he who introduced her to Massinger's sweet
and tender Camiola, the Maid of Honour; to Dekker's wild, impulsive
and altogether womanly Roaring Girl; to Webster's beautiful and
tragic Duchess of Malfi&mdash;a play of which he was particularly
fond, and of the revival of which before a London audience he
cherished wild dreams: he had talked about it more than once to
Cosway Keele, and had even attempted a somewhat modernised version
of the great work, but so far nothing had come of it; and Cosway
Keele had always shaken his head, and declared that there was not a
living actress who could play the part of the Duchess. Lendon gave
the play now to Beatrice to study, and was delighted to find that
she shared his admiration, and took the same noble and sympathetic
view of the character as he himself, for to him the Duchess of
Malfi was one of the ideal women. So the weeks wore on in the
little house in Regent's Park.</p>

<p>Never did actress lead simpler or more innocent life. She worked
all the morning, practising elocution with Miravoglia, or gesture
with an eminent lady-professor from the Paris Conservatoire, and
then when she came home she studied her parts, and when Lendon was
announced he often found her stretched in sheer fatigue on the sofa
beneath the bulging casement-window and ready to yield herself, as
a child might do, to a little deferential netting and sympathy.</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V. TEA IN THE STUDIO.</h2>

<p>LENDON'S studio was situated in the artistic colony o Chelsea.
He had built himself a low red-brick boon after all the approved
canons. His fortune was sufficiently large to enable him to gratify
a mild passion for <i>bric-à-brac</i>. He had some very good china and a
quantity of fine tapestry, and his collection of old prints was
famous. The studio itself was a homelike place; he was fond of it,
and, in the Jessie Harford days, work had been his passion. He had
idealized her in every possible mood and attitude, and studies of
her still hung in dim corners and stood on unused easels like
mocking ghosts of the past. He put these away with something of an
ironic pang on the day before that fixed for Beatrice Brett's
'first visit&mdash;such a pang as a sincere-minded person might
feel in taking down the symbol of an outworn faith to make place
for the sign visible of conversion to a new and more convincing
creed. He took a good deal of pains 111 beautifying his studio for
the reception of his American guests&mdash;Beatrice and Mrs.
Cubison only; the Professor had been called away on other business.
Never before had he fidgeted so over the placing of his chairs, or
examined his various properties with so critical an eye as to the
effect they might produce on an outside observer, or altered and
disposed anew so many times the fold of a piece of drapery or the
arrangement of his curious collection of pots and pans; not even on
the occasion of a visit from a royal personage, or on that of the
annual reception, a few days before Show Sunday, at which he was
wont to entertain his especial circle of friends apart from the
ordinary herd who trotted round the artists' quarter. The studio
had a gallery at one end, hung with his rough sketches, and draped
with odd bits of Oriental work. He wondered whether Beatrice would
admire his hangings of Moorish tapestry and Persian embroidery, his
Turkish tiles let into the fireplace, and his odd pieces of
Oriental brass-work; and he wondered whether she would be
interested in hearing him tell of how he had come by his different
treasures&mdash;for to nearly all some reminiscence of adventure or
more or less romantic association was attached&mdash;and if her
eyes would lighten, and her charming smile come into play; and if
she would puke about with that air of child-like interest which
already he had begun to know and look for; and if she would notice
his collection of pipes, and remark his little jewelled
liqueur-cups; and if perhaps&mdash;audacious thought!&mdash;she
would accept one of the pretty things in token that she had
forgiven that unlucky speech in relation to the objectionable word
"morbid," which she was always in a half serious, half laughing
way, bringing up against him. And had she ever tasted Russian tea
he wondered, and would she like it; and would she try his piano? He
knew she was musical, for he had once called and been shown into
her sitting-room in the course of a lesson from Miravoglia, and he
had known by the way in which the fat little Italian put his finger
to his lip with a deep-drawn S-sh, and had struck the chords of the
accompaniment with a sign that she was to go on unmindful of the
interruption, that the master was proud of his pupil and wished to
show her off to the intruder. She had only been singing a sort of
recitative exercise, but Miravoglia had patted her shoulder when
she had finished, with an air of benevolent commendation.</p>

<p>"Zat is good, but it is not as good as you can do. You are weak.
You do not eat." He turned round on his stool and gazed at her. "My
gracious I how pale you are! What is ze matter?"</p>

<p>"I didn't sleep very well last night, Signor," said Beatrice,
who had in the meantime nodded welcome to Lendon. "I have just
finished," she added, motioning him to a seat.</p>

<p>"You not sleep last night," repeated Miravoglia. "What as 'e
been doing? I kill 'im if 'e worry you."</p>

<p>"There's no 'he' in the question, Signor."</p>

<p>"Then why you worry?" and he made a gesture of sovereign
contempt, as if to imply that nothing short of a lover could by any
possibility be a legitimate cause for uneasiness to a young woman.
"You must eat much. To-morrow you take a good breakfast&mdash;not
your leetle toast and tea of the fine ladies who lean back in their
carriages in the Park&mdash;but a vex' good meal. You are a worker,
Workers must eat."</p>

<p>"I know that, Signor," said Beatrice meekly. "Tell me, do you
take such good care of all your pupils?"</p>

<p>"Not of all, not of all," and he looked at Lendon as he tapped
himself knowingly on the chest; "but I have somesing 'ere to take
care of&mdash;somesing zat will do great sings."</p>

<p>"The reason why Signor Miravoglia is so popular with his pupils
is that he pays them all such nice sugary compliments," said
Beatrice, teasingly, turning to Lendon. "Compliments!" cried the
Signor; "you shall 'ear. Zere was a young lady who came to me zis
morning; she want to go on de stage. Mademoiselle,' I say to 'er,
'you have come to know if you can sing you say you 'ave a lofely
voice. Perhaps I may not sink you 'ave a lofely voice. No matter, I
will tell you de truth.' So she sing&mdash;you shall 'ear if I
compliment. 'Mademoiselle,' I say to 'er, 'it is <i>awful!</i>
Nevare sing again, nevare sing one note.' And now, Mees Beatrice,
we will have a leetle song. Begin."</p>

<p>She protested that her lesson was over. Miravoglia insisted.
Lendon entreated. So she sang a German firing after a fashion that
called forth a "Brava" from Miravoglia, and that touched Lendon to
the very depths of his heart. It was wonderful that so strong and
rich a voice should come from that fragile frame. It was very
sweet, too, and had a pathos which he thought he had never heard
equalled.</p>

<p>When she had finished, Miravoglia swung himself round on the
music-stool and cut short Lendon's thanks. "She will do," he cried;
"but she is nervous. No matter!&mdash;zere never was an artist who
was not nervous. I believe in 'er. Remember, Mees Beatrice, what I
tell you. Sing from your big 'eart. Sing as if you was in lofe.
Zere is no 'e!" he went on indignantly. "Zere must be one 'e, I
tell you. You are in lofe?" he questioned insinuatingly.</p>

<p>A beautiful blush came over Beatrice's face. She laughed with a
touch of embarrassment. "No, indeed, Signor," she answered. "I
haven't any time for that."</p>

<p>"No time? Ah! Bah! It is good for an artist to be in lofe. Make
yourself in lofe, Mees Beatrice."</p>

<p>"But, Signor Miravoglia, I have tried and quite unsuccessfully.
I have done my very best to fall in love with each of the heroes at
each one of the plays which I have gone to see in London, and all
in vain. There is not one among them who gives me an
emotion&mdash;except, perhaps, Cosway Keele."</p>

<p>"Ah! Cosway Keele!" echoed Miravoglia, contemptuously. "He is
not bad, but 'e is too old, and besides No, Cosway Keele will not
do. Never mind," he added, reflectively; and as he spoke his eyes
were on Lendon, and it seemed as if he were appraising Lendon's
qualifications for a possible lover. "Wait; 'e will come. Zere
never was an artist who did not lofe; and zen," he added,
consolingly, "she will sing from the bottom of very big 'nit," And
with this prophecy Miravoglia bundled up his music and
departed.</p>

<p>Lendon remembered the little scene, and Beatrice's flush, and
her shy laugh when Miravoglia had gone and they were atone, and how
she had abruptly turned the conversation and had there and then
selected her visit to the studio this very day. He went off into a
blissful dream, which was interrupted by the entrance of his
servant with some flowers he had ordered. And then there were
minute directions to be given as to the preparation of the tea and
the purchase of an especial cake which was only to be procured in
one particular shop in High Street, Kensington, and which he was
certain Beatrice would like; and there was a box of Paris <i>bonbons</i>
to be unpacked&mdash;did not all American girls adore
<i>bonbons!</i>&mdash;and there were the flowers to be arranged&mdash;such
glorious masses of Nice violets, and branches of mimosa, and
bunches of red and purple and pink anemones, so that the dusky
studio was fragrant and beautiful with blossom as the gardens and
olive groves of the sunny South.</p>

<p>And how Lendon was rewarded for all his pains by Beatrice's
exclamations of delight, and by the brightening of her serious
face, and the girlish pleasure with which she bent over the bowls
of mimosa and violets and anemones, which last were new to her, and
by her frank admiration of all his pretty things, and by her sweet
and gracious acceptance of the tiny Moorish cup he shyly offered
her! The sun shone out, though it had been dark and foggy enough
before, and made her golden hair glisten in its rays, and it seemed
to him that she had brought the sunbeams with her. Oh! it was a
very pleasant afternoon. The cake and the bonbons were a success,
and so was the Russian tea, not the least so because it absorbed
Mrs. Cubison's attention for the time, and set her speculating as
to how she could procure a samovar to send as a present to a New
York lady of culture and taste who appreciated things out of the
common. The samovar turned her off on a voyage of discovery among
the relics, as she called them, and she begged that she might be
allowed to prowl about among the cabinets and in the dark corners,
in the hope that she might improve her taste and cultivate her eye
to the capacity of discriminating between the genuine articles and
the Birmingham imitations on exhibition in Regent Street and Oxford
Circus. So Beatrice and Lendon were left more or less to themselves
at the piano; and a charming sympathetic talk they had, while she
played dreamy little things by Hiller and Brahm, or he played and
she listened, conversation rippling on to the measure of the music
in an odd, fitful, fanciful fashion.</p>

<p>The sun went down; the lamps were brought in, and the fire
danced up and deepened the tender glow on Beatrice's cheeks. Mrs.
Cubison reminded her that they were going to the theatre that
evening&mdash;Cosway Keele had sent them a box for the now waning
attraction at the Dionysion, and though they had seen it once
already they were happy to go again&mdash;and then, to Lendon's
surprise and pleasure, Beatrice herself turned rather timidly to
him and asked him if in the Professor's absence he would care to be
their escort. Would he not? His fête day was not over yet, for
there and then he devised a little plan by which Beatrice should
see something more of London life, and he should have still a
further taste of her society. What was to prevent them from dining
with him at the Orpheus Club? And might he call at their house, say
an hour hence, and take them thither? and that would give him just
time to dress and to go round by the Orpheus and order a table and
see that the champagne was put on ice. For Mrs. Cubison must throw
aside her Puritan ways for that one evening; and indeed he was sure
that she was not a Puritan at all, but a veritable Bohemian; and
since, of coarse, she would not forego her after-dinner cigarette
she would find the Orpheus supply quite reliable. They had a cosy
meal, though Mrs. Cubison did not indulge in her usual cigarette,
which she declared she only smoked to keep the Professor company,
and though the consumption of champagne, as far as the ladies were
concerned, was not large; and it was Cosway Keele's own box which
be had sent them, so that nothing could have been more agreeable or
comfortable. There occurred, however, one curious drawback to the
evening's enjoyment, and this was the discovery by Beatrice herself
that Countess Adrian was in the house.</p>

<p>Lendon wondered why suddenly she drew back and gave a little
shiver, and why she turned so pale.</p>

<p>"Are you cold?" he asked; "I am afraid there is a draught in
that corner."</p>

<p>"No," she answered, "it is not that. Look down at the end of the
third row, just below us."</p>

<p>He did so, and saw Sir Donald Urquhart's slightly bald head and
bored impassive face raised upwards, and beside him Countess
Adrian's sleek coils of hair and statuesque neck and shoulders.</p>

<p>"Don't you see that you are giving way to a fancy?" he said.
"You were quite happy till they came in."</p>

<p>"Ah!" she answered, "that is just the thing. I seemed all of a
sudden to know that she was near me, and then I saw them take their
places there."</p>

<p>"Beatrice," he said, leaning towards her and speaking very low.
"Do you remember our compact and your own words to me&mdash;your
promise that I should be an influence to take care of you, a pillar
against which you might lean for support?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, "I remember."</p>

<p>"Then try to think that, unworthy as I am, my dearest longing in
the whole world is to be your support, your shield against this
uncanny fancy which has taken possession of you. Put your hand in
mine for a moment and gain strength and courage to fight against
it, from the knowledge of my"&mdash;he paused for an instant and
his voice trembled&mdash;"of my sympathy and affection."</p>

<p>She did put her hand in his&mdash;her little trembling band
whose touch thrilled him with a peculiar magnetism of its own. At
that moment Countess Adrian looked up. Her dark eyes rested on the
box for several seconds and she seemed to be taking in all its
occupants; then she bowed to Lendon, and turning, whispered
something in Sir Donald's ear.</p>

<p>"Are you stronger, Beatrice?" Lendon whispered. "Do you not feel
that it is a fancy to ha combated and conquered?"</p>

<p>"It is no fancy," she replied, "but I am stronger when you are
with me. You don't know how I feel when she looked at me," the girl
went on hurriedly; "I seem to lose all power, and even all sense of
individuality. You can imagine nothing more horrible than the
sensation of spiritual blankness and desolation and helpless. It is
like having the evil eye upon one."</p>

<p>"Then," he said, smiling at her la the effort to reassure her as
though she were a little child, "I am going to give you a charm
which an Arab woman gave me against the evil eye, and you must
always wear it, and it will make you at least remember that there
is one person who would give his life to help you." As Ito spoke he
detached from his watch-chain a little gold hand, such as one sees
among the Mohammedans in the East, traced with certain mystic lines
and a crescent on the palm.</p>

<p>She took it from him and examined it with deep interest and an
air of comfort and confidence; then she unloosened from her arm a
bangle of plain gold with a ring at the clasp, and asked him to
fasten the charm upon it. "It shall be my talisman," she said, "to
guard me from evil."</p>

<p>She made 110 further allusion to Countess Adrian, but sat back
silent and thoughtful till the close of the last act but one. Then
she rose suddenly. "Marmy," she said, "I must go home. I have a
headache. I can't stay here any longer. Mr. Lendon will go behind
and explain to Cosway Keele, and thank him for us."</p>

<p>Mrs. Cubison got up obediently, and Lendon took them down and
saw them into a cab. The mission entrusted to him obliged him to
sit out the performance. As he went back to the theatre he met Sir
Donald and Countess Adrian coming out. She stopped and spoke to
him.</p>

<p>"So your Improvisatrice, like myself, is bored with Cosway
Keele?"</p>

<p>"She is tired and not very well," replied Lendon, "and like
yourself, probably, she has seen the play before."</p>

<p>"Oh! one has seen it half-a-dozen times; but like everything at
the Dionysion, it is a perfect picture, at which one can look in a
dreamy way and fancy oneself taken back to the times it represents.
Has she quite recovered from her fainting fit of the other
night?&mdash;your Inaprovisatrice, I mean."</p>

<p>"I believe so," Lendon answered guardedly; though had not Sir
Donald been present he would have tried to ascertain if Countess
Adrian were aware of the curious influence she exercised. At that
moment the footman appeared and her carriage was called. She turned
back to him with a smile as Si Donald offered her his arm.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lendon," she said, "I think you arc almost the only person
I have ever asked twice to come and see me. I assure you that many
people find me interesting."</p>

<p>He was taken aback by her frankness, but recovered himself
sufficiently to frame an apology which might be accepted as a
compliment.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "you shall prove your sincerity, but not just
yet. I am going to Paris for a few weeks; when I come back again
you shall hear from me."</p>

<p>He was glad to be able to tell Beatrice that she need not, for
the present at least, dread the evil eye of Countess Adrian. It
seemed to him that for the first few days after the encounter at
the theatre the girl drooped a little, and was less enthusiastic
about her work, less sanguine about the future. Miravoglia
mournfully reiterated his enquiry. "What 'as 'e been doing?" and
would not be satisfied with Beatrice's repeated statement that
there was no "he" in the case. Probably Miravoglia would not have
believed her had she told him the truth, and would have scouted the
idea that a woman whom she had seen only twice, and to Whom she had
never spoken, was the cause of the disturbance. But simultaneously
with Countess Adrian's departure Beatrice revived, and shortly
afterwards a great event occurred&mdash;one of those fateful
accidents which turn the current of an existence, and present the
opportunity which makes or mars a career.</p>

<p>For Beatrice's opportunity has come. Now, at last, she is very
happy. The manager has been found and, better still, the great
part. She is to play Webster's "Duchess of Malfi."</p>

<p>Lendon had from the first felt inspired by the conviction that
this was the predestined part, and he rejoiced now to think that
she had studied it in the first instance at his instigation. The
piece had not been played in London for a generation, and at the
time it was played had not' ever had a fitting Duchess. Now the
Duchess had come.</p>

<p>It had been partly Lendon's doing. This especial actor-manager
under whom Beatrice was to make her great appearance&mdash;a man of
genius with the untiring perseverance, the power of organizing, and
the capacity for detail and stage arrangement which ensured success
for any production he might put on the boards of the
Dionysion&mdash;was an old friend of the painter's.</p>

<p>Cosway Keele&mdash;for he was this actor-manager&mdash;had, as
has been told, seen Beatrice Brett's performance at Mrs. Walcot
Valbry's, and had been much struck by its extraordinary power and
originality. He had long contemplated the revival of Webster's
tragedy, he himself playing the part of Bosola, but had declared
over and over again to his intimates that he knew no living actress
capable of personating the ill-fated Duchess. Beatrice had
impressed him strangely. "I think I see my Duchess at last," he
said to Lendon that very night at Mrs. Walcot Valbry's; and it was
this remark which had caused Lendon to turn Beatrice's attention to
the Elizabethan dramatists. "But," added the manager, "it is out of
the question now; and though I am not sure that I would not risk
such an actress, untried though she is in England, I must wait. We
shall see, at any rate, bow she proves herself."</p>

<p>Strange things came about, however. Just as the new Dionysion
production had been decided upon&mdash;a Shakespearean
comedy&mdash;and the scenic artists and the authorities on historic
costume and furniture, whose services the theatre retained, were
torturing their brains to produce an effect that should beat even
the Dionysion record, the leading lady fell suddenly and
dangerously ill and threw all the Dionysion arrangements into
chaos. She was forbidden to act again for a year. In the meantime
what was to be done? Who would take her place, and what play could
be put on that would satisfy an exacting public which had been
trained to demand much from Cosway Keele? It was at this juncture
that Lendon put in a word.</p>

<p>"Why not try 'The Duchess of Malfi,'" he said, "and give the
American Improvisatrice the part?"</p>

<p>Cosway Keele took a day to think over the scheme. He had already
met Beatrice socially, now in a business capacity was introduced to
her in her little study, and was delighted with her interpretation
of the part. Before many hours all was settled. Beatrice was to
play in the great tragedy. To Bernard Lendon was entrusted the task
of some revisions and alterations in the text, and as soon as this
was done "The Duchess of Malfi" was to be put into rehearsal.</p>

<p>Lendon set to his work with ardour. It gave him opportunities
for consulting Beatrice, for studying her and for identifying
himself with her aims and hopes, which were sweeter to him than any
other pleasure that could at this time have been offered him. And
the more her nature revealed itself to him, the more tender, true
and womanly did it appear, the more did she seem to him not only an
ideal to be worshipped, but a woman to be wholly loved. She had her
little moods of despondency&mdash;nay, even of despair, when she
declared herself incapable of realizing the creation, and
prophesied for herself dire failure and for Cosway Keele
disappointment and disaster. Then how he delighted to soothe and to
encourage her and to buoy up the elastic artist spirit till she was
hopeful and sell-confident once more. But she had, too, her times
of artistic exaltation when the fire of genius burned, and, as Mrs.
Cubison would have put it, the "influences" were propitious, when
she astonished them at rehearsal and sent Cosway Keele away from
the Dionysion under the conviction that he was about to introduce
to the world a new Rachel. On the whole things went merrily at the
Dionysion, and some doubts which had been felt as to the
suitability of such a piece for the modern stage subsided. Lendon
had cut out all the rough phraseology of a play which, but for the
out-spoken language of the time, not then thought harm by woman or
man, is pure as newly-congealed ice. He had shortened the play and
made it end with the death of the sweet, sad, wronged heroic
Duchess, the doomed victim of a brother's hate and treachery. Never
was woman more truly moulded for happiness and joy and love, more
sweetly, purely passionate in her love. Yes, and she finds a lover
worthy&mdash;at least not unworthy&mdash;of her, though of lowlier
rank than hers; and she stoops to him and lifts him to her heart,
and they are married; and then her brother's hate, rapacity, and
cruelty sends her to her death. And what a death, and how she meets
it: prayerful, gentle, sublimely serene, absolutely undismayed by
the coming death itself and by all its accompanying and artificial
horrors.</p>

<p class="poem">"Whether the spirit of greatness or of woman<br>
Reigns most in her I know not."</p>

<p>"These," said Beatrice to Lendon, "are the very words that first
taught me the part. See, I have scored and underscored them."</p>

<p>"Her waiting-woman's words?" Leaden said.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;she has so great a soul that she has lifted the very
waiting-woman into a comprehension of it! Shall I ever be able to
put all my fall sense of her love and her nobleness and her courage
into words? Oh, tell me!"</p>

<p>"Yon can, and you will, and all London will fall down before
you," Lendon exclaimed in the full rapture of the sincerest
conviction, already proud of the anticipated triumph.</p>

<p>"I don't think about that now&mdash;oh, hardly at all! I only
think about <i>her</i>. I feel as if she would be looking down on me from
that heaven to which she has gone. I think of her as a real woman.
I feel her reality. Do you know, Mr. Lendon, I sometimes fancy in a
half-dreamy sort of way that I shall feel her soul possessing me;
so that I shall make her live again in me? Do you think me
extravagant, absurd?"</p>

<p>"I think you have the very soul of an artist," he said. "And see
how the artist's ambition triumphs over everything lower! You don't
care about the crowded houses and the applause any more?"</p>

<p>"They don't come into my thoughts. I dare say if I succeed I
shall enjoy the success to the full by-and-by. I am ambitious. Oh,
yes! I want to succeed. But, Mr. Lendon, if I can only play that
part as I see it&mdash;as I see it of nights when I lie
awake&mdash;well, then, it couldn't be prevented&mdash;I must
succeed!"</p>

<p>"Come," Lendon said cheerily, "yon have spoken those words with
a brave conviction worthy of the Duchess herself. Only make her
speak like <i>that</i>, and you must succeed."</p>

<p>"But she has such wonderful lines to speak; there is such
variety in her, such high spirit, such gaiety, such chaff,
even&mdash;yes, such downright merry womanish chaff; and then the
pathos, the passion, the fervid love, the agony, the anger, the
pity, the forgiveness. Oh! shall I ever be able to do it all?"</p>

<p>"You have done it all&mdash;you are doing it all," Lendon said,
delighted and satisfied.</p>

<p>"Well, it will be your doing," she answered, dropping her
voice&mdash;"yours and hers! We can think of the crowd and the
applause some other time, if they come. <i>Now</i>, I cannot feet myself
playing for <i>them</i>. I am playing for her, and, and," she blushed a
little and half turned her head away, "and for <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>"Beatrice," he exclaimed passionately; "Is that really true? Do
you feel that you care more to please me than to please the crowds
who will throng to see you, and who will admire you, and call you
great&mdash;yes, you know they will&mdash;and you will smile
serenely; and you will turn to <i>me?</i> At last, at last, you will learn
to love me?"</p>

<p>"Hush," she said, blushing very red; "we are talking of the
Duchess. We must only think of the Duchess now."</p>

<p>"I have been very patient," he urged. "Have I not thought of the
Duchess? Have I not respected the Duchess' claims all these weeks?
How can I help sometimes thinking of the woman, not of the artist?
Do not ask me to be more than man."</p>

<p>"I ask you only to be yourself," she answered. "Come, hear me my
lesson and tell me if I say it well."</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI. COUNTESS ADRIAN'S
SKY-PARLOUR.</h2>

<p>IN the excitement of the preparations for "The Duchess of Malfi"
Lendon had almost forgotten Countess Adrian. It was with something
of a feeling of guilt that he one day read the following
note:&mdash;</p>

<p>Queen Anne's Mansions, April.<br>
<br>
DEAR MR. LENDON,<br>
<br>
I have come back from Paris, and am writing to remind you of your
promise to visit me in my sky-parlour. I have something that I want
particularly to ask you. Can you come to me to-morrow at five?<br>
<br>
Yours,<br>
AGNES ADRIAN.</p>

<p>The sky-parlour proved to be a very attractive domicile, though
it was at the very top of Queen Anne's Mansions and two lifts were
necessary to get to it. A Chinese boy, with a pig-tail and dressed
in a sort of national costume of dark blue curiously embroidered,
ushered Lendon along the inner corridor. It struck him that the
Oriental attendant was quite in keeping with a certain Eastern
luxuriance and semi-barbaric magnificence peculiar to Countess
Adrian herself, and his artistic sense was gratified by the due
appearance of so judicious a touch of colour. The young Celestial
retreated with all the gravity of his race to inform his mistress
of her visitor, and Lendon had once again an opportunity to
appreciate the harmony of effect arrived at between the lady and
her surroundings. The boudoir was gorgeous, but it was a splendour
in which, notwithstanding its audacity of combination, nothing
jarred. Never were such vivid and bewildering pinks and greens and
yellows so subtly interblended on wall and ceiling with deep
crimson and burnished gold. The furniture was principally Japanese
of the costliest description&mdash;inlaid work, lacquer and enamel,
with here and there grotesque carvings, eccentric masks in old
ivory, startling monsters in bronze and porcelain, exquisite pieces
of old pottery and bits of drapery heavily wrought in silver and
gold, such as might have come straight from the Mikado's palace.
Everything about the room was fantastic and luxurious to the last
degree. Almost everything might have fetched a price in an art
collection. Lendon perceived with delight that the tea-service
which stood in readiness before the fire was of rarest old Dutch,
and that a casket lying open and filled with dainty French bonbons
was of the most valuable <i>cinque-cento</i> workmanship. Amid all
this congruous incongruity were different modern feminine
trifles&mdash;Palais Royal knick-knacks&mdash;the latest thing in
scent-bottles, photographs with the signatures of distinguished.
persons, lying heaped pell-mell, in a bowl of ancient Tokio ware. A
soft enervating odour pervaded the place. It came, he discovered,
from a curious preparation of <i>pot-pourri</i> that blended with
the fresh perfume of forced roses and early lilac and Parma
violets.</p>

<p>"You like my den?" said the Countess Adrian's deep musical voice
beside him. He had not heard her enter. She was holding out both
hands in frank welcome, and her splendid eyes, glowing with power,
passion, and rich vitality, were looking into his Again be had the
sensation of being almost oppressed by that superabundance of life
force which her whole presence conveyed. He could,
indeed&mdash;remembering by a curious association of idea, the
words of Maddox Challis in that respect&mdash;fancy it well might
extinguish or absorb into itself any feebler spark. To-day she was
positively beautiful, and, certainly, did not deserve her titular
epithet of the "belle-Laide." There was a soft rose flush upon her
smooth cheek. The turn of her neck was enchanting; so also were the
curves of the ripe red lips and the gleam of white teeth between
them; and so too was the shapeliness of her form, which seemed to
undulate beneath the folds of an odd clinging sort of dress of some
delicate Eastern fabric.</p>

<p>"A thousand pardons, Countess," Lendon began.</p>

<p>"We had the colour copied from one of the Japanese
theatre-books," she went on, seating herself at the table and
pouring out a cap of tea as she talked. "It was very difficult to
get the British workman to understand the scheme. All sense of
colour seems to have been blotted out of you in your grey, grimy,
foggy little island. For myself, since I cannot have the sunshine
in which I was born I must try to make up for it by colour."</p>

<p>"You were born in a tropical country, Countess?" asked
Lendon.</p>

<p>"I was born in Jamaica," she answered; "and I have Spanish and
French as well as English blood in my veins. The cabinets and
draperies and things," she went on as if pursuing a narrative, "I
brought myself from Asia."</p>

<p>"I did not guess that you had been such a wanderer," he
said.</p>

<p>"Yes. I have wandered all my life. I have never had a home.
Sometimes," she added sadly, "I fancy that I never shall have one.
Not that I regret my wanderings," she added hastily; "they have
thrown me among strange people and have taught me some strange
things, though I am not quite so learned in Eastern lore as Maddox
Challis. Do you know, by the way, whether he has really started for
Lebanon?"</p>

<p>Lendon answered in the negative.</p>

<p>"That man fascinates me," said the Countess. "He is the only
person I have ever met who gives me the feeling that he could make
me do what he pleased. I met him first at Pekin. I spent a whole
year in India, China and Japan; it was the year after my marriage
with Count Adrian."</p>

<p>The idea crossed Lendon's mind that it was strange she should
thus composedly allude to a ceremony which the law-courts had
pronounced null and void. Clearly, also, as she retained the title
to which it had been decreed she had no right, there was wisdom in
the bold part of assuming her history to be above reproach or
question.</p>

<p>He did not answer directly, but accepted the tea and sugar which
she handed to him, with some commonplace complimentary remark upon
the excellence and peculiarity of the brew.</p>

<p>"It's Asiatic too," she said. "I know what you are thinking of,"
she added abruptly. "You are wondering that I should speak of my
husband with so little embarrassment&mdash;after all that you have
heard and read in the newspapers. Now confess&mdash;isn't it
so?"</p>

<p>"I have heard&mdash;of coarse," he said, not denying the
inference. "As for the newspapers, I am more in the dark than you
think, for I was out of England at the time of the trial to which,
I suppose, you refer."</p>

<p>"At any rate you know the circumstances. I have no doubt they
were in a hundred mouths at Mrs. Walcot Valbry's the other night. I
have no doubt, too, that not a few of the great ladies were
indignant at meeting me, though they were glad enough to accept the
hospitality of my hotel in Paris, in the old days. I dare say, too,
that people in general think I am trying to brazen it out, and take
my appearance in society as a proof of my utter heartlessness. That
is of very little consequence, but <i>you</i> will know that after a great
storm, when the waters have been lashed to foam and the billows
torn to their very depths, by-and-by the tumult subsides as though
it had never been, and the surface of the sea is scarcely stirred
by so much as a ripple."</p>

<p>"There was a great storm?" said Lendon questioningly. "I am
speaking of the storm in your own nature&mdash;not of the outside
world&mdash;the newspapers and the gossip of scandal-mongers. That
is all only a cyclone of straws."</p>

<p>She paused an instant with her eyes on his face.</p>

<p>"I like to hear you say that," she replied. "It gives me a kind
of key to your character. I like a man to look upon the
society-sensation part of the affair&mdash;the notoriety and all
that kind of thing, you know&mdash;as a cyclone of straws. Here is
where the real tempest rages." And she laid. her hand lightly upon
her breast. "A storm? Yes; a hurricane, a tornado, a cataclysm!
Great Heavens How I suffered!"</p>

<p>"Ah, I can understand the suffering you may have gone
through&mdash;the pain of a trust betrayed&mdash;of a noble love
hurt to the death by the discovery that it had spent itself upon an
unworthy object."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;<i>you</i> know. That I suppose was how you felt
about Jessie Harford. You <i>did</i> love that woman, Mr. Lendon.
If some one had only loved <i>me</i> like that!"</p>

<p>"Surely there must be many&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"Oh many!" she interrupted. "Yon think I am a woman to inspire
love. Well, I suppose I can count my lovers by the
score&mdash;perhaps I can't count them at all&mdash;it would be a
bore to try. But that's not the kind of love I mean&mdash;love that
loves on through ingratitude and baseness, and reverences itself
too much to make a mere plaything of what, after all, was only in
its very nature created for the lower uses. I wonder"&mdash;she
added slowly&mdash;"that you were not tempted to revenge yourself
in that way, after you had found out how she deceived you, and when
you loved the woman still."</p>

<p>"I <i>was</i> tempted&mdash;for a little while," he answered. "I thank
Heaven for the strength which enabled me to overcome the
temptation. Don't let us talk of that, Countess."</p>

<p>"Whey, since it is all dead? It is dead, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"My love for Jessie Harford is dead," he said, quietly.</p>

<p>He rose as he spoke and stood by the fire-place, absently
fingering a quaint little porcelain figure which stood upon it.</p>

<p>"And that is what comes even of such love!" she said, looking at
him intently.</p>

<p>"Of <i>such</i> love!" he repeated. "No! the love never dies, it
lives again in another form. But, talk to me about
yourself&mdash;if you will."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I am an egotist; I always talk about myself. But
haven't you noticed that nobody ever finds fault with a judicious
egotism in the case of a man or woman who is in the nature of
things interesting? I suppose, without bad taste, I may assume that
I <i>am</i> interesting; at any rate some misguided people have found me
so. You were wrong, Mr. Lendon," she went on, without waiting for
his reply. It was a peculiarity of Countess Adrian that she never
allowed time for a reply that must necessarily be a compliment.
"Wrong, in your interpretation of what I said about my husband.
There was no trust betrayed, in one sense. There was no discovery
of the kind you mean. I always knew that he was ignoble. There was
no love hurt to the death."</p>

<p>"You mean that you did not love him?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "It is my misfortune perhaps&mdash;perhaps
my good fortune, that I have never loved anyone, except myself.
Tell me, what do you say to that?"</p>

<p>"I can hardly venture, Countess. Anything I might sly would be
either impertinent or ridiculous."</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm a woman who has got past conventionalities. That is
part of my wretched position; one of the cruellest of the wrongs he
has done me. He has given the world permission to insult me."</p>

<p>"No!" exclaimed Lendon, eagerly. "You do injustice to yourself,
as well as to the world."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> are not likely to insult me, you mean. If you were, I
should not be talking to you now, in this fashion. I have a fine
scent for possibilities of disrespect. No, Mr. Lendon, I value your
consideration and I value your opinion also. I should like you to
understand me."</p>

<p>She rose too, and stood beside him, one elbow resting on the
mantel-piece, her face turned towards him as she leaned slightly
backward. Her eyes looked at him with a wistful expression. Her
whole attitude&mdash;the tilt of her small head, the exquisite
modelling of her chin and throat, the droop of her
eye-lids&mdash;were indescribably alluring. She affected him as
some strong perfume or heady wine might do. It occurred to him, in
a whimsical manner, that were he not in love with Beatrice Brett,
he should certainly fall in love with Countess Adrian.</p>

<p>"Come and sit down," she said; "you look so unsociable standing
there." She motioned him to a chair, and sank herself upon a low
cushioned sort of lounge, beside the fireplace.</p>

<p>"I want you to understand that I was never in love with my
husband," she went on. "I was a wild ignorant Creole girl,
hungering to see the world, and I married him because he was rich
and had a title, and would open my oyster for me. I did really
marry him, or at least I believe so. You don't suppose that at
sixteen I was so worldly wise as they tried to make out."</p>

<p>"Sixteen!" he repeated pitifully&mdash;"only sixteen!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am younger than you fancied perhaps; I am
twenty-five&mdash;twenty-five," she said again&mdash;"no great age;
and what have I not gone through! I lived with him for nearly seven
years, then he got tired of me and cast me off, but I did not
choose to be flung aside like a&mdash;shall I say a Jessie
Harford!"</p>

<p>"No!" he exclaimed savagely; "you must not speak of her in that
way."</p>

<p>"Ah, I <i>can</i> hurt you. I wanted to. I said that or purpose. When I
can make a man look as you did at that moment, I know that he is
not quite indifferent to me."</p>

<p>"Forgive me. I don't want you to be indifferent to me." She put
out her hand to him and let it fall again, as her tones fell also
in a caressing cadence.</p>

<p>"You know that would be impossible," he said.</p>

<p>"Would it? Well, we shall see. I took my claim into the law
courts, and they decided against me&mdash;as law courts have a way
of deciding against an unfriended woman. In spite of them he is my
husband in deed and in fact, and I am his wife, yet we are both at
liberty to marry again whenever we please."</p>

<p>"Report says, doesn't it, that Count Adrian is about to avail
himself of that liberty?"</p>

<p>"He is going to marry the daughter of one of your English peers.
You see there are mothers even in your pious England who don't
hesitate to give their young daughters to a man of known
profligacy, and who has a wife already living. There will be a
grand wedding and columns in the <i>Morning Post</i>, which you may be
sure will not be so ill-bred as to mention the fact of my
existence. I have no doubt that if Count Adrian had been an
Englishman and a politician, a great deal of political capital
would have been made out of that&mdash;misadventure, shall we call
it? I should have had champions by the thousand. They might even,
had I the misfortune now to be poor, have got up a public
subscription for me. But as it is, he is not an Englishman, he has
nothing to do with politics, and so the papers ignore his past, and
Society opens its doors to him, and mothers welcome him as a suitor
to their daughters. In <i>my</i> case everything would be different; there
is not a mother in England who would not think her son polluted by
a marriage with me. Isn't it so? Tell me!"</p>

<p>Lendon felt at a loss to reply; all he could say wag, "You are
very hard."</p>

<p>She laughed. "I knew you would make some banal remark. I hoped
you would be more original. Of course I am hard; and of course,
too, it is as I say even Sir Donald Urquhart is obliged to confess
it."</p>

<p>"Sir Donald, at any rate, proudly announced the probability of
your bearing his name."</p>

<p>"He is too devoted. He thinks it advisable I should change one
which is a subject of disagreeable notoriety. He is willing to
sacrifice himself on the altar of his infatuation: I may say that
without vanity. His love isn't the kind of love I spoke of to
you."</p>

<p>"You don't love him, then?" Lendon blurted.</p>

<p>"Love him! My friend&mdash;I may call you my friend, may I
not?&mdash;it doesn't imply anything compromising&mdash;do you
think I have lived twenty-five years in the world, and during nine
of them have been in familiar acquaintance with some of the
wittiest and best-bred and altogether most fascinating men in the
world, to succumb now to the attractions of Sir Donald
Urquhart?"</p>

<p>"Yet you have consented to marry him."</p>

<p>"Not quite. It was agreed between us that he should announce the
fact of our engagement it doesn't follow that the engagement is a
binding reality. He believed that the announcement would improve my
position. Of course he was right, a future Lady Urquhart may be no
very great personage, but at least people are less eager to be
unpleasant to her than to notorious, by courtesy Countess Adrian.
Do you see? And when any one offers me something good I never
hesitate to take it, always provided that the extent of the
obligation is clearly defined."</p>

<p>"And is that the case with Sir Donald? I should hardly have
thought so."</p>

<p>"I think it is. At any rate, if he is under any rosy delusion,
that is not from any want of candour on my part. I have no doubt he
would tell you so if you pressed him."</p>

<p>"I! What right have I to question his or your arrangements?"</p>

<p>"None, I suppose; but it is the right of a friend to be
interested in one's welfare. You never answered my question. May I
count on your friendship?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly, Countess. On my warm admiration and my humble
services, if they can be of any use to you."</p>

<p>"I shall fasten you to your word presently. Mr. Lendon, does it
seem strange to you that I, being what I am, don't jump at the
prospect of marrying Sir Donald Urquhart?"</p>

<p>"It seems to me that perhaps you hardly appreciate his devotion
at its true value."</p>

<p>"You mean that, on the face of things, there is a sort of
heroism in his willingness to give his name to a woman whose own
has been so smirched and bespattered. I don't know, though that it
is such a very ancient and honourable name. His grandfather was a
nobody, who made money and voted steadfastly with the Government;
but let that pass. No, I don't think it is altogether heroism. You
see, Sir Donald is not a very young man, and so has less to lose.
He has no one to please but himself, and so can't hurt anybody's
feelings of consequence to him. Then he is an art-collector and
<i>dilettante</i>, and has a reputation for eccentricity, so can do with
impunity many things that in anybody the would set Mrs. Grundy
rampant. Added to all this, he is a man about town of no very
exalted moral standard. He has never in his life denied himself a
thing he wanted; and he is rich enough to pay a long price for the
article he fancies. He is going to pay a long price for me. He
wouldn't do it if he were not infatuated. Now, is that
heroism?"</p>

<p>"As you put it, no."</p>

<p>"I put it after the way of a woman of the world. Now for my side
of the question."</p>

<p>"Ah! your side of the question, about which I confess to feeling
the deepest interest."</p>

<p>"Well, why do I hold back? Why have I stipulated for a year in
which to make up my mind&mdash;a year in which, though we are bound
before the world, I am free as air to give myself to any one I like
better? For the simple reason I have already told you I have never
been in love."</p>

<p>"Forgive me for saying that this seems to me the most curious
and interesting fact in your most remarkable and interesting
personality."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't take me for a woman of ice? I'm not. I'm a pent
volcano. I could love with all my heart and soul and strength,
if&mdash;if the right man came along. But he has never come. My
Prince Charming has never stepped within the enchanted palace to
awake the sleeping princess by his kiss."</p>

<p>An odd little exclamation broke involuntarily from Lendon. It
was half of pity, half of amusement. There did indeed seem
something almost bordering on comedy in this picture Countess
Adrian drew of herself as the innocent slumbering beauty who had
never thrilled to passion. Countess Adrian, of whom the world
said&mdash;he was too chivalrous to finish the sentence, even in
thought. She seemed to have read what was passing in his mind a
deep blush overspread her face.</p>

<p>"You judge me like the typical man of the world," she said, with
a sadness which touched him infinitely; "and no man of the world
can ever conceive it possible that a woman may be dragged in the
mire and yet through all keep the heart of a girl. Well, no
matter."</p>

<p>"Countess," said Lendon hastily, fearing be had wounded her, "I
want to think of you only as you would have me think. You puzzle
me; you interest me. Teach me to understand you."</p>

<p>"Then," she said, "we must agree, once for all, to drop
conventional standards. Think of me&mdash;of this outer husk of
me"&mdash;and again she laid her two hands upon her bosom&mdash;"as
what the conditions of my life have made me. Think of the inner
woman as still untouched with cynicism, still with the capacity for
enthusiasm&mdash;for devotion. The outer experiences are only as
garments to be worn or thrown aside. I am twenty-five, and I have
had a rich wardrobe. Everything has happened to me
except&mdash;Death and Love."</p>

<p>"Why do you put death first?" he said.</p>

<p>"Because it might come to me at any moment. My mother died
suddenly of heart-disease. I, too, have disease of the heart. Don't
speak of that: it is a subject I can't bear to dwell upon."</p>

<p>He could not help a shudder.</p>

<p>"It is inconceivable!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes, I look splendidly well: I feel life thrilling in every
pulse of me. But never mind. I am going to tell you something which
will partly explain my conduct in regard to Sir Donald. It is this:
I am intensely superstitious. No, that is not the right expression.
It would be more correct to say that I believe in moult
forces."</p>

<p>"You, too!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Why do you say you, too?' Have you been meeting anyone lately
who goes in seriously for that sort of thing?"</p>

<p>"It seems to me that everyone goes in for that sort of thing
more or less seriously," he answered evasively; "and occult' is the
fashionable adjective."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so. At any rate this superstition of mine is the reason
of Maddox Challis's influence over me," she went on. "I have learnt
enough to know that he is an Initiate of the lower grade. He
doesn't choose to exert his powers&mdash;indeed, I believe it is a
rule of the Brotherhood that they are not to be lightly
displayed&mdash;but he could teach you and me some strange secrets
of Nature, if he would. He won't talk to me; he doesn't like me;
but he knows that I blow."</p>

<p>"And where did you get your knowledge, Countess?" Lendon
asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, mine is only a smattering. I knew a man in the
East&mdash;he was a Parsee&mdash;an astrologer&mdash;a sort of Mr.
Isaacs and Ram-Lal combined. It was he who told me that this year
would be the most fateful in my life. Now you know why I don't
choose to bind myself. I stake my all on this year&mdash;Death or
Love."</p>

<p>She got up from her chair and held out her hand as if she would
have dismissed him. He Look her hand, and some impulse for which he
could not account prompted him to raise it to his lips.</p>

<p>"You play a strange game, Countess," he said; "and one in which
it is you yourself who incur the least danger. To a man who
accepted your challenge&mdash;Death or Love&mdash;the game might
well prove fatal."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Surely, to know you is to love you&mdash;but the Prince
Charming fortunate enough to touch your heart must be a rare and
exceptionally endowed person."</p>

<p>"You think so?" she said.</p>

<p>"Isn't it proved, since, as you say, you have never loved? And
yet, how many there must be who have loved you."</p>

<p>"There is a fatality in that sort of thing. It is
destiny&mdash;not temperament. Or, as the poets tell us, a
wandering soul finding its twin."</p>

<p>"Oh, the twin soul theory is a hackneyed solution of the problem
why some two people love earl other, and some other two do not My
theory is that certain forces in oneself reach their climax, and at
the same given time certain outside currents converge and bring
about a convulsion, and then it is, when one's nature and one's
surroundings are ripe, that love comes. It is the 'psychological
moment,' in short. And given the psychological moment, there is
bound to be a Prince Charming hanging round. Where, then, is the
question of hazard?"</p>

<p>Countess Adrian looked at him steadily for a moment or two
before she replied.</p>

<p>"Suppose," she said, "that the man I loved, the man whom I knew
would satisfy all the requirements of my being, for whom I had
poured forth all that I have to give&mdash;what could never be
taken back and given to another&mdash;suppose that he had no love
to give me in return?"</p>

<p>"Impossible, Countess," said Lendon, "unless&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unless?" she repeated.</p>

<p>"Unless he were devoted heart and soul to another woman."</p>

<p>"There is the hazard of the game," she said calmly. "He might
be&mdash;married&mdash;or he might be, as you say, devoted heart
and soul to another woman."</p>

<p>"Heaven grant, Countess, that it may be happy love which awaits
you!"</p>

<p>"Good-bye," she said abruptly. "Our talk this afternoon has
interested me. You must come again. But I have said nothing that I
intended to say, and I have said everything that I meant not to
say. I don't mean to flatter you; but I am naturally a reserved
person, and I dislike the after taste of indiscreet
confidences."</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg you not to regret having given me a glimpse of your
true self," he exclaimed warmly. "Surely what you have said could
only heighten my admiration&mdash;my esteem."</p>

<p>"That will be for you to show me," she answered, smiling.</p>

<p>"At least," he said, "you will allow me to hear what it is that
you intended to say?"</p>

<p>"My object, in short, for asking you to call to-day. I had been
thinking of sending for you for several days. I have really been
back from Paris for some time, but I had a notion that you were
otherwise engaged, and I felt a most unaccountable and unusual
timidity. However, as you see, I took my courage in both hands and
sent for you."</p>

<p>"Well? Is it anything I can do? If so, command me."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is something I want you to do. Oh, it's not a thing
that you will dislike&mdash;at least, I hope not. But let that
stand over for to-day. I don't feel in the mood to ask
favours."</p>

<p>"I assure you, Countess, whatever the favour may be, it is
granted. For you to ask a favour from me is to confer one."</p>

<p>"We shall see. I will write. And now that you know your way to
my sky parlour, I am always at home after five o'clock."</p>

<p>He took his leave, and made his journey down; and it was not
till he had reached the dark little court outside the Mansions,
that he remembered the fact that Beatrice Brett's name had never
once been mentioned during the Long afternoon talk.</p>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII. COUNTESS ADRIAN'S
PORTRAIT.</h2>

<p>BERNARD LENDON was in his studio the morning after his visit to
Countess Adrian, He was by way of having taken up work again, and
the place was littered with sketches and unfinished landscapes, the
result of his American trip. There was also on the stocks a
portrait of a very handsome and fashionable woman, newly married,
whose husband was a friend of his and had commissioned him to paint
his bride. He was expecting its original for a sitting when a
carriage drove up to the door. He waited in the full anticipation
that she and no other was his visitor. He was mistaken, however.
The door leading on to the gallery was opened, and the
<i>portière</i> held aside for a lady to pass through and descend,
but the lady was Countess Adrian.</p>

<p>She came down the stairs with composed undulating grace, raising
her veil as be advanced to meet her, and she smiled as if there
appeared to herself something odd and amusing in this impromptu
call.</p>

<p>"You see, I have taken upon myself to return your
visit&mdash;and very soon," she said, when the first greetings were
over. "I was going to write to you as I said, but the impulse
seized me to come and see you instead. I always act on impulse; so
I am here to tell my business in person."</p>

<p>He offered her a chair, and she unwound some of her furs.</p>

<p>"Isn't that a dangerous creed, Countess?"</p>

<p>"Very likely; it has certainly not answered as a whole in my
case. Let us hope that it may turn out better in detail. Well, I
told you I meant to ask you to do something fur me. Briefly, I am
going to give you a commission, if you will accept it."</p>

<p>"A commission, Countess!"</p>

<p>"There's nothing odd in that. You take commissions to paint
portraits," and she glanced at the one on the easel. "I want you to
paint mine. Does that please you, or the reverse?"</p>

<p>"Of course, it pleases me."</p>

<p>"Then you will do it?"</p>

<p>"With the utmost pleasure."</p>

<p>"But I want it done quickly&mdash;a half-length. I shall sit to
you every day."</p>

<p>"So much the better."</p>

<p>"Really, you are delightfully accommodating. I don't know why I
imagined that you would make all manner of difficulties, but I did.
I assure you I was quite nervous about making my request. But now
to business, please. I am quite in serious earnest&mdash;about my
dress, and the time, and everything else. It is to be given to Sir
Donald Urquhart on his birthday, three weeks hence; so you see
there is no time for delay."</p>

<p>When the preliminaries were settled, she got up and roved about
the room, examining the tapestry, and making lithe discursive
remarks as she went along. "You think he will like the portrait? It
is so dreadfully difficult to find a present for a man like Sir
Donald. That's the worst of being so rich. But you think it's a
good idea?"</p>

<p>"If only I can do you justice."</p>

<p>"Oh t I am sure you will do me far more than justice: r shall be
at my very best. I am certain that it is quite as necessary for the
sitter to be on the alert&mdash;sympathetic, you
understand&mdash;as the artist himself. And I like your portraits.
Looking at that"&mdash;she stopped before the easel on which his
latest work was placed&mdash;"one would almost fancy that Mrs.
Jarvis had a soul. Tell me," she added, turning to him as if a new
idea had struck her, "did Maddox Challis ever talk to you about the
possibility of forcing one person's soul into another person's
body?"</p>

<p>"I have a distinct recollection of hearing him speak on that
subject at Sir Donald's supper-table, the first time I met
you."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember. Well, do you believe in it?"</p>

<p>"As much as I believe in this." He took up a yellow-covered
French novel which was lying on a small table beside his own
particular lounging-chair, and held it towards her.</p>

<p>She read the title&mdash;</p>

<p>"Théophile Gautier's '<i>Avatar</i>.' I know it. Odd that you
should have been reading that book just before the thought came
uppermost in my mind. I always say what is uppermost; that's
another article of my dangerous creed. I don't know why you should
be so sceptical. The theory of the <i>Avatar</i> is as old as the oldest
religion. Haven't you ever felt, when you took laughing-gas or
chloroform," she went on, "that your soul left your body?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have," he answered, laughing; "and it must have gone on.
some pleasant excursion, for I remember, oar awaking, that I felt
confoundedly sorry that it had come back again."</p>

<p>"Oh I I think it is a frightful sensation. I can imagine nothing
more horrible than the sudden knowledge that one must die&mdash;to
go forth cold, naked, and grey, into blank space&mdash;to have no
body, no soft warm flesh. I lore my downy skin," She held out her
arm as she spoke, and pushed back her sleeve and looked tenderly on
the delicate velvety surface. "To have no power of animal
enjoyment; to lose the pleasure of basking in sunshine, the joy of
physical sense, and to be conscious all the while of one's craving
and one's nothingness Ghastly! No; give me
life&mdash;life&mdash;long life!"</p>

<p>"Yet," said Lendon, "I have been told that death brings with it
the strangest sense of peace and content."</p>

<p>"Not for me. It would be a very tearing apart of spirit and
flesh. I should be one of those vampire-spirits one reads
of&mdash;you know Sheridan Le Farm's story?&mdash;and renew my life
with human blood; or should I be strong enough, I wonder, to carry
out Mr. Challis's idea, and usurp a body at the expense of some
weak unfortunate soul? Mr. Lendon, how would one feel, I wonder,
encased in some one else's body? Would one keep its consciousness
of identity? and, if so, what an amusing sense of paradox would rim
through all experience; or would it be a mere confused blending of
personalities&mdash;a bewildering jumble of past and present
impressions&mdash;a sort of battle between spirit and flesh&mdash;a
mystery without a clue? What do you think?"</p>

<p>"How can I form an idea of what is absolutely outside
experience?"</p>

<p>"Oh! but it need not be, Did you not hear Maddox Challis say
that such an <i>Avatar</i> was quite possible?"</p>

<p>"Ah, then, we want Maddox Challis here to explain the
process."</p>

<p>"He is quite capable of corning&mdash;in his astral form. I know
that once, when his real body was in Palestine, his astral shape
appeared to a friend of his in London, and, warned him of a coming
danger."</p>

<p>"In time to avert it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He never plays those pranks without a sufficient motive;
but he cannot bear any allusion to that story, and will answer no
questions about it. The man to whom he appeared was a changed
person from that day. He had been a materialist before; now ho has
entered the Roman Catholic Church, and joins mortification of the
flesh to the highest mysticism."</p>

<p>"Are you a Catholic?" asked Lendon, abruptly.</p>

<p>"No. Frankly, I am nothing. I own no God but nature, and I want
nothing higher." There was a short silence, during which Countess
Adrian examined a sketch lying on an easel near her. "I wish I knew
whether I should lose my identity," she went on, reflectively, as
if she were again seriously considering the possibilities of such a
transformation as that to which she had alluded.</p>

<p>"I don't respect myself in the least, Mr. Lendon. I know that
there are hundreds of millions of more estimable persons; but I am
not uninteresting, even to myself. I shouldn't like to give up my
own identity. With all my faults and follies, and God knows they
are numerous enough to wreck a dozen lives, I find myself <i>bon
camarade</i>. We have gone through a good deal together, this Agnes
Adrian and I; we should not like to part company. Mr. Lendon," she
added suddenly, not waiting for him to reply; "why do we always get
upon horrors? Good-by, till to-morrow!" As she went up the stairs,
she stopped, and, looking down upon him, asked, "By the way, have
you seen the Improvisatrice lately?"</p>

<p>The suddenness of the question startled Lendon. He felt that his
face changed. He answered lamely that he had called upon her a few
days before.</p>

<p>The Countess' penetrating gaze was confusing.</p>

<p>"She is going to play the Duchess of Malfi, I hear. Can she do
it?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Cosway Keele at any rate thinks so."</p>

<p>"I know the play; it is one of the parts I have always thought I
should like to act. Did you know that after my&mdash;my
<i>bouleversement</i>"&mdash;she gave her shoulders a little
shrug&mdash;"I thought of going on the stage?"</p>

<p>"I had never heard it," he answered; "but that goes for
nothing."</p>

<p>"No! You were oddly ignorant about me; and I thought I was
famous! Yes, I actually went to a manager. One had to do something.
I was poor, with the habits and tastes of the Second Empire. I
couldn't be a governess. No one would hire me as a servant. There
was nothing but to be a barmaid or an actress. Well, luckily for
me, an old man who had been in love with me died and left me a
fortune, and so I was spared the necessity of earning my bread. But
the Duchess! You came over from America with her, did you not?"</p>

<p>He replied that they had travelled in the same steamer.</p>

<p>"And you are altering the play? Yon see her very often, of
course," she went on. Then, without waiting for his answer, said,
"Shall you marry her?"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be more to the purpose to say, 'Will she marry me?'"
he returned, with an awkward attempt at pleasantry. "Miss Brett is
wedded to her art."</p>

<p>"Oh! That is nonsense. All women who do anything are wedded to
their art, till the art of love proves more attractive. But <i>are</i> you
going to marry her?"</p>

<p>"I have never asked her," he replied.</p>

<p>She was thoughtful for a moment. "Are you going to paint her
then?"</p>

<p>"Really, Countess, I have not thought of that either."</p>

<p>"I always believed that was a painter's first thought when he
saw a beautiful woman. And she <i>is</i> beautiful. Why did she faint so
suddenly the other night?"</p>

<p>"She has a strange fancy that it was because <i>you</i> looked at
her?"</p>

<p>Countess Adrian bent forward quite eagerly.</p>

<p>"That is a curious idea."</p>

<p>"It is an idea which has taken possession of her. She dreads you
with a superstitious and unreasoning dread. She believes that you
have the evil eye. She thinks that if you chose to exert your power
you could make her fail in a great part."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am not so wicked as that," Countess Adrian laughed
softly. "She has all my good wishes for success in the Duchess of
Malfi. She will succeed, I am sure of it!"</p>

<p>"Yea, I am sure of it also," answered Lendon.</p>

<p>"But, tell me," the Countess went on, "for this to me is deeply
interesting. Is that exactly how she feels? She was really
conscious the other night that it was <i>my</i> influence which affected
her and made her unable to go on acting?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know it?" answered Lendon, almost roughly. He was
jarred inexpressibly by the cool manner in which Countess Adrian
appeared to weigh poor Beatrice's agonies. It reminded him somehow
of the scientific interest of a vivisector. "You know that you
<i>meant</i> to make her feel your influence that evening. Was it quite
kind to experimentalize upon one so delicate, and at a moment too
when she was necessarily more emotionally susceptible than at other
times?"</p>

<p>Her face seemed to pale a little and her eyes gathered fire as
they fixed themselves upon him while he spoke. "On the contrary,
she ought not to have been at a disadvantage. One might have
supposed her so absorbed in, and identified with, the character she
was representing as to be quite impervious to any outside
impressions. Come, there's an interesting and instructive problem
for dramatic psychologists to squabble over. I commend it to you in
your new capacity of playwright and dramatic critic."</p>

<p>"It is a problem that does not interest me," he answered
coldly.</p>

<p>"But I know what <i>does</i> interest you; and that is&mdash;Miss
Beatrice Brett. I don't know what you mean by asking if it was kind
of me to experimentalize in that way. I never thought of it. I
won't admit anything as to my motives. In the first place you have
no right to assume that I had any malevolent intention."</p>

<p>"I don't assume it. I only ask you to be merciful in future. Of
course, Miss Brett's dread of you is only an imagination. It seems
almost absurd to discuss it seriously, but imagination may work
great havoc with a nervous system so highly wrought as hers."</p>

<p>Countess Adrian had reached the gallery and was standing a
little above him, as leaning against the balustrade she looked down
on him with a grave and yet satisfied smile.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "it does seem absurd to discuss seriously a
merely elementary experiment in occultism. I am rather ashamed of
it. It was an experiment. I wanted to see what it was possible to
do when one concentrated one's will-power upon a person susceptible
to magnetism."</p>

<p>Lendon could have imagined that she was experimentalizing at
this moment upon himself, so deep and steady was her gaze.
Nevertheless, he felt curiously unaffected by it.</p>

<p>"Why did you choose Miss Brett as a subject?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Because I thought she seemed a likely one; and then everyone's
attention was drawn to her. Tell her though that she need not be
afraid, I will not do it again."</p>

<p>"Thank yon." He laughed a little awkwardly. "Apart from any
interest I may feel in Miss Brett, I have very strong interest in
the fate of the Duchess of Malfi. But tell me, Countess, do you go
about the world choosing like another 'She' whom you will 'blast' with
your eyes? Oughtn't I to take this as a warning to a rash artist
who is so venturesome as to try and paint those same dangerous
orbs?"</p>

<p>She dropped her gaze at once and flushed again as rosily as a
girl.</p>

<p>"You know quite well that my eyes are not clangorous to you. It
annoys me when you take that sneering cynical tone. I shall not
tell you any more of my occult experiments."</p>

<p>With these words she left him.</p>

<p>It must be owned that, during those mornings in the week which
were devoted to the portrait, Lendon found Countess Adrian a very
agreeable companion. She was certainly a delightful object of
contemplation; and she had not walked the world so freely without
acquiring ideas sufficiently bold and varied to keep a listener's
mind pleasantly on the stretch. Her frankness was amazing. She
seemed to want to convey to Lendon that be of all beings was the
one whom she most desired should know her in her heights and depths
and with all possible extenuating explanations. She appeared to
wish to disarm any outside criticism which might reach him, by
giving him first her own version of various episodes in her
somewhat adventurous career. She had a pictorial way of relating
things, and put into her accounts of herself a richness of colour
and a mysterious suggestiveness of complex motive that threw a rosy
glow of poetry and romance over all that she told of her actions
and moods.</p>

<p>He was more than ever impressed by the tropical luxuriance of
her temperament. Her audacity had something of the unconsciousness
of childhood, and there seemed truth in her remark upon herself
that, in spite of her many experiences, she was at bottom
absolutely natural.</p>

<p>She had the ways of a woman at war with society; but her manner
clearly indicated that she considered the challenge had not been
laid down on her part. "Do circumstances make temperament, or does
temperament make circumstances?" was one of the riddles she
propounded. Her moods were quite incalculable. Sometimes she would
come to the studio and pose with an air of chastened sweetness
worthy of a Madonna, while her speech was gentle and tender as the
murmurs of a cooing dove. At other times she paced the room like a
caged lioness, as if she needed some vent for her fiery and
impetuous energy; and as under these conditions serious work was
out of the question, she would propose that he should walk with her
along the Embankment, or cross the bridge to the Battersea region,
and tramp the Park till she was subdued and conventional again.
Sometimes she had all the dignity of a great lady pure and simple;
sometimes she would smoke a cigarette, and toss off her little
glass of cognac with the unrestraint of a <i>cocotte</i>. Yet
through all these chameleon changes she was always herself, racy,
original, daring, refined, and altogether brilliant, with that
nameless shadow of sadness, that not too obtrusive touch of the
sensuous, which increased her bewildering charm.</p>

<p>It struck him as curious that her talk so often touched on
mystic subjects. Ire wondered where she had got her curious lore.
She told him once that, if he had ever lived in Paris, he would not
be surprised that her taste ran in that direction; for that not
only were Professor Chorea's experiments carried on in private life
in certain sections of society, but that the modern medical school
numbered many an aspiring dabbler in black magic. She laughed of
his questions as to whether she had tampered with the forbidden
knowledge, and said that she had always gone on the principle of
putting out feelers in every direction. What was life worth if you
must be bound down to one narrow groove of experience? She liked to
sip every variety of beverage, and this was only one phase of her
character. When he knew her better, he would discover that she was
equally at home as a sportswoman, a woman of letters, and a
butterfly of society. Still he noticed that there were two subjects
which were always obtruding themselves in her
conversation&mdash;so-called occultism and Maddox Challis.</p>

<p>"He is the only person in the world that I am afraid of," she
said once, "and I am afraid of him because he knows me too well.
Don't misunderstand me," she added laughing, as Tendon looked at
her, perplexed as to her meaning; "I don't want to convey in a
roundabout fashion that I am a secret murderess, and that I have a
mysterious crime on my conscience of which Maddox Challis only
possesses the key. I have never done anything half as bad as the
evil deeds for which the world already gives me the credit."</p>

<p>"Why, then?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why? I am going to tell you something. There's a little old
lady in London whom I know, and who has clairvoyant eyes&mdash;the
clearest, most penetrating blue eyes, which seem to be looking far,
far into space. So, in fact, they are. They have a terrible power,
those eyes; and I always avoid that old lady. The odd thing is that
she is quite simple and unsophisticated, and doesn't seem in the
least to realise what a terror she might be to some people, and
what a help to others. If she were here now, she could tell you
that you were surrounded by a crowd of bodiless beings, and she
would describe them to you. Perhaps they might be good spirits who
prompt you to good actions and sweet and gracious thoughts, or they
might be very evil ones&mdash;and then she would turn very pale and
shudder, and go away from you as soon as she could without actual
rudeness. Once she paid a visit to Monte Carlo, and she described
the <i>galerie</i> behind the rows of players invisible to
everybody but herself. These people were the spirits of suicides
mostly; and some had their throats gaping, and some had part of
their faces and heads blown away, and were bespattered with blood,
and some bad the marks of strangulation, and others were only
greedy and excited with the passion for play They hang on the
croupier's call as eager and as fascinated as the living
themselves, and would stretch out their hands gloatingly over the
gold. They would whisper in the ear of some player, and the payer
seemed to be obeying the invisible prompters, who would often laugh
with the most execrable grimaces when the stake was raked in, as
though they were glad of the ill-fortune, and they would stoop and
whisper again and again, till the player, goaded to desperation,
doubled and doubled, and lost and lost. Well, who would play at
Monte Carlo if they could see what that little old lady saw? Maddox
Challis is like that. He sees within and without, but he is not
simple and unsophisticated like the little old lady. He knows the
power he possesses, and he says nothing. He bides his time. He only
looks at you, and pays courtly compliments, and lets you know by
his eyes that he <i>knows</i>. I dare say that, while he is smoking
cigarettes, at this present moment, in the courtyard of his house
at Damascus, he is perfectly well aware that you and I are talking
about him here."</p>

<p>Lendon felt an odd reluctance to tell Beatrice of that
conversation with Countess Adrian which had reference to herself,
and of Countess Adrian's promise that she would not again
experimentalize, as she had done, upon the memorable occasion at
Mrs. Walcot Valbry's. There were several reasons for his
disinclination to open up the subject. The rehearsals of "The
Duchess of Malfi" were in their full swing. Brain, nerves, and
energies of every one in the theatre were concentrated upon what
was fie would be either an enormous success or an ignominious
failure. Cosway Keele was terribly anxious. The tragic atmosphere
of medieval Italy seemed to pervade the Dionysion. The actors were
frightfully nervous, and among themselves prophesied disaster.
Theatrical people are famous for superstitions, and the fact was
commented upon direfully that the stage eat&mdash;that friendly
familiar, without which it is supposed that no theatre can be
lucky&mdash;had died during the first week of the rehearsals. There
were other minor portents of ill. Even the scene-shifters moved
about as if overwhelmed by a weight of care. As for Beatrice
herself, she lived in her part. She was no longer Beatrice Brett;
she was the Duchess of Malfi. She was not the young American
actress about to make an ambitious venture which should raise her
to giddy heights of success, or send her tottering down to join the
crowd of failures. She was not the Beatrice who lay on the sofa in
her little study, and looked out on the trees in Regent's Park. She
was not the Beatrice who paced the boards of the Dionysion, or
waited at the wings for her cue, or stood patiently under the hands
of designer and dressmaker. This was not Regent's Park. This was
not the Dionysian, It was a stately Italian palace, and outside,
the roses and the orange-trees were in bloom, and the poor Princess
of court etiquette, impatient of her brother's jealous
surveillance, waited and watched for the hour when she should steal
forth to meet her lowly-born husband-lover. She had no thought for
the common things of London life. She had forgotten even her terror
of Countess Adrian, since for the time Countess Adrian had
disappeared from her horizon. And why should London rouse the
morbid fancy, and even, in reassuring her, remind her anew of the
slumbering dread, and perhaps revive all her superstitions fancies?
And then, again, he had a feeling of suppressed irritation at the
mere notion that she was so far in Countess Adrain's power. It
annoyed him to think that this girl, who was his ideal of all that
was pure and perfect, should be at the mercy, as it were, of a
woman of whom the world spoke slightingly. It was only in
association with Beatrice that the thought of Countess Adrian's
antecedents vexed Mm. He would have taken her part loyally against
her traducers as he would that of a trusted comrade. In his own
mind, and even hitherto in speaking of her to Beatrice, he had
maintained that she was a wronged and maligned woman. But a man may
entertain all these sentiments about a certain woman and yet be
unwilling that she should exercise an unaccountable influence over
the one woman, dearest to him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII. THE GREAT NIGHT.</h2>

<p>IT was a mixture of these feelings which made Lendon, when he
was with Beatrice, avoid mentioning that Countess Adrian was
sitting to him for her portrait. The discovery came about by
accident, though it must not be supposed that he made any special
point of concealment. In truth his mind, except during the
sittings, was too much occupied with Beatrice herself and with the
fate of the play, to concern itself deeply about Countess Adrian.
He was working at the background one afternoon when, to his great,
surprise, Mrs. Cubison and Miss Brett were announced.</p>

<p>They bad come to consult him upon a matter in the Duchess'
costume, about which Cosway Keele and the Dionysion authorities
found themselves in sudden perplexity. An impulse had seized
Beatrice to drive along the embankment to Chelsea. They bad got
into a hansom at the door of the Dionysion, where they were. So
Mrs. Cubison explained. The matter of the costume could be settled
at once by reference to a volume in the library, and Lendon at once
proposed an adjournment thither. Mrs. Cubison declared her
intention of waiting for them in the studio, thus taking an
opportunity of resting her poor legs and head, and forthwith
proceeded to repose herself on the sofa. As she passed the easel at
which Lendon had been working, Beatrice stopped with a startled
exclamation and stood motionless before the portrait.</p>

<p>"Ah! I forgot," said Lendon a little awkwardly. "I am painting
Countess Adrian. It is a curious sort of commission, and I am bound
to secrecy, for it is to be a birthday present to Sir Donald
Urquhart, and till the day comes he is to know nothing about
it."</p>

<p>Beatrice said not a word for a minute, but looked intently at
the picture.</p>

<p>"Is that why you did not tell me?" she asked.</p>

<p>"In good truth," he answered, "when I am with you I can think of
nothing but you and the Duchess of Malfi. And then I did not want
to revive an unpleasant association."</p>

<p>Beatrice touched the little charm at her wrist. "You need not
have been afraid; she has been away. And besides, I have been
relying on my talisman."</p>

<p>"Or rather work has driven away the foolish fancy&mdash;sober,
serious, earnest work&mdash;for it was a foolish fancy, Beatrice,
you will admit it now."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "It was no fancy; and even as I look at her
portrait, the eyes seem to follow me and make me shiver with that
strange horrible dread. I shall never get over it&mdash;never, But
I am stronger and better able to face it when I have you to help
me." She paused a moment. As if with an effort she turned away from
the portrait. Presently she said to him in a tone of
alarm&mdash;"She is back again from Paris? And she will be at the
Dionysion first-night. Oh! what shall I do?"</p>

<p>"My dear child," he said soothingly. "It makes me miserable to
see how this thing unnerves you. I have got a message for you from
Countess Adrian herself, which I had not meant to give you until
you yourself should bring up the subject. Perhaps it may comfort
you."</p>

<p>"You told her that I was afraid?"</p>

<p>"I told her that you were delicate, nervous and overwrought, and
that imagination is apt to run riot with such an organization as
yours. Well, she bade me tell you that she would never
experimentalize, as she called it, on you again, and that you had
her Heartiest wishes for success as the Duchess of Malfi. You will
find her one of the most sympathetic of your first-night
audience."</p>

<p>She gave another little shiver. "Tell me," she said "you are
painting her picture, you have many opportunities of hearing her
talk. You should be in some sort of position to know whether this
instinctive dread of mine has any foundation in fact. Do you think
she is a good woman?"</p>

<p>He hesitated. With the girl's large clear eyes full upon him, it
seemed to him impossible to answer from his heart that he believed
Countess Adrian to be a good woman. "I don't know; I cannot tell,"
he answered. "Don't let us talk of Countess Adrian any more. Come
to the book-room and we will look up the Duchess' sleeve."</p>

<p>She went up the stairs silently, and followed him as he led the
way to a quaint bow-windowed room, which contained the celebrated
Stothard prints, and a collection of volumes rare enough to satisfy
a most fastidious collector, It was some time before they settled
the vexed question of the pattern of the Duchess' sleeve. Then the
prints bad to be examined. And then some curious Moorish brass work
took her fancy. He thought she had quite forgotten Countess Adrian;
but after she had said that they must go down and wake up Marmy,
she paused, and returned again to the subject.</p>

<p>"It is humiliating to confess that I am relieved at Countess
Adrian's promise to spare me," she said, "but it is true. And I am
almost glad to know that she was consciously exerting her will
against me. Perhaps now that I am warned and on my guard, I might
have some strength to resist. But I feel that I could not act if
that power was working against me. It was like a sort of death that
night. Everything seemed to go out of me, and there came the most
appalling sensation of absolute loneliness and terror. Then I
fainted. Bat I will be strong," she added feverishly. "I am be
strong, for now I have you to help me."</p>

<p>"Oh Beatrice," Lendon cried. "You don't know how happy those
words of yours make me. They give me hope and courage. They lift me
nearer to you. Don't let us talk of Countess Adrian, dear. Let us
talk of ourselves. Oh, if only I could be certain that you would
let me help you always&mdash;in everything. If only I might be
close to you always to protect you from all trouble, to take the
burden of all that perplexes and alarms you. These imaginary
terrors would vanish away into the night from which they had
sprung, and my love would be like a wall encompassing you and
guarding you from every hurtful influence."</p>

<p>"Your love!" she replied, in a subdued half-wondering tone.</p>

<p>"You know that I love you," he exclaimed passionately. "I have
loved you from the first moment that saw you on the steamer. I love
you as I have never loved any other woman in the
world&mdash;purely, wholly, devotedly. I don't want to hide from
you that I have loved before. I cared once for a woman
who&mdash;who was unworthy. That love is dead&mdash;a thing of the
past; and deep as it was, it seems nothing&mdash;nothing in
comparison with the love I feel for you."</p>

<p>It was the first time he had declared his love so unreservedly,
though over and over again, in every word and look he had implied
it. She drew back a little, as if he had pained her.</p>

<p>"Hush," she said, "you mustn't, say that. You mustn't talk to me
of love&mdash;now."</p>

<p>"How can I keep silence, when your voice, your look, something
in your eyes, in your manner when we are together half implies that
you do care for me a little? Oh! Beatrice, you know it is so. You
know that there is sympathy between us. You are happy in my
companionship."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" she answered simply, "But Mr. Lendon&mdash;that is
not love."</p>

<p>"It would soon grow to be love," he urged, "if only you would
give your heart full play, if only it might not be a forbidden
subject between us."</p>

<p>"It must be so still," she answered. "I cannot think of love
yet."</p>

<p>"But a little later," he pleaded, "when you know me better, and
trust me more."</p>

<p>"I don't need to do that," she said; "I have trusted you always.
I trusted you not to be like other men who have wanted to make love
to me. I trusted you to be my friend and to have my career at
heart."</p>

<p>There was a note of reproach in her tone which touched him
keenly.</p>

<p>"Oh Beatrice," he said, "you expect too much of me&mdash;you
expect me to be more than human; how can I help loving you? And
have I not. your career at heart? There is no one who thinks so
much of it as I do&mdash;yea, not even you yourself&mdash;for you
don't see the dangers as I see them. You don't see that you need
some clue to lean upon. Some one to stand between you and the jars
and shocks your sensitive nature must inevitably suffer. You don't
see that, however brilliant your life may be&mdash;and it will be
that, for you will certainly succeed&mdash;the more brilliant
indeed that it is, more lonely it will be."</p>

<p>"I do know that," she answered sadly; "you can little guess how
lonely I have felt, even here in London. Do I not know how lonely I
shall feel on the first night of the 'Duchess of Malfi,' more
lonely if it is success than if&mdash;if it be failure."</p>

<p>"No, Beatrice," he said, taking her hands in his; "you will not
be lonely, for I shall be there, and my whole heart will be with
you."</p>

<p>She did not answer. They stood thus with hands clasped, both
looking out on the little garden gay with its spring bulbs.</p>

<p>"We ought to go to Marmy," she said at last, withdrawing her
hands.</p>

<p>"Will you not give me one word of hope? I will wait as long as
you please. Only give me the right to stand by you before the world
as your affianced husband. I know that I could understand you, and
that I could make you happy. I know that I could win your
love."</p>

<p>"Does that seem to you so very difficult?" she said, looking at
him with the first gleam of coquetry he had ever seen in her
eyes.</p>

<p>He took her hand again in his and kissed it. "Say that it may be
so, Beatrice. Give me the right to guard you. Give me the right to
prove to you how tenderly and passionately I love you."</p>

<p>"No," she answered seriously, "not now. I am going to tell you
exactly how I feel, and you mustn't think me ungrateful or
unwomanly. I do value your love. I do feel proud of the honour you
have done me. Perhaps some day, if you would be patient&mdash;some
day I might be able to tell you that I care for you in the way you
wish; but now"&mdash;a smile played on her face&mdash;"Mr. Lendon,
the truth is that I am devoted heart and soul to some one
else."</p>

<p>"Some one else!" Lendon exclaimed, thrilling with doubt and
dread.</p>

<p>"Yes; some one worthy of my devotion. I have been constantly in
his company during the past weeks. I have studied his character in
many phases. He has his faults, but he is greater than his faults;
and I admire him in spite of them&mdash;nay, because of them. That
is how one ought to love, is it not, Mr. Lendon?"</p>

<p>"Beatrice it is not like you to play with a man's heart in this
way."</p>

<p>She smiled again. "But I want you to hear all about my hero,
Bernard. He is a brave, loyal, devoted gentleman. He is very proud,
but he is an odd mixture, too, of modesty and pride&mdash;too
modest to speak of love until ha is told that he may love&mdash;but
then, when lifted so high, brave enough for any woman's
heart&mdash;resolute to hold to her, to defend her, to fight for
her, to die for her, to do anything but give her up!"</p>

<p>She was becoming melodramatic; Lendon was becoming sullen.</p>

<p>"Any man would be like that, I suppose," he said; "any man who
cared for a woman&mdash;we have all of us pluck enough for
that."</p>

<p>"Oh, but all men are not like my hero, and my champion, and my
lover!"</p>

<p>The last word revived him.</p>

<p>"Come, now," he said, "I know you are talking nonsense when you
talk like that. May I hear that wonderful hero's name?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! his name is Antonio."</p>

<p>A thrill of relief passed through Lendon's heart.</p>

<p>"Treacherous Antonio," he said with a smile. "I introduced him
to you, and he has supplanted me! Antonio is the lover and husband
of the Duchess of Malfi."</p>

<p>Beatrice smiled a sweet, half-pathetic smile. "Antonio must have
his day," she answered. "But the curtain must fall upon him.
Then&mdash;perhaps!"</p>

<p class="cpb">* * *</p>

<p>There was an all pervading thrill of excitement in the closely
packed Tows of seats at the Dionysian on the first night of "The
Duchess of Mall." This was always, more or less, the case. A
Dionysion fiat-night was one of the events of the year. Seats were
taken months beforehand, and the life of Cosway Keele's manager was
made a burden to him, because of the number of applications and
entreaties from acquaintances who thought they had a right to be
present on this important occasion. The world of London showed
itself in miniature&mdash;aristocracy, art, and letters, sent their
representatives. Every face in the stalls and boxes was the face of
a man or woman known and talked about, and not to be at the first
night of the Dionysion was to proclaim oneself out of the swim, at
least in Bohemia.</p>

<p>To-night, the excitement was intensified. Beatrice Brett had
been much trumpeted, much cried down. The members of the profession
were jealous of her notoriety, furious at what they called her
audacity. She had been much written about. For weeks the
paragraphists had been busy gleaning details as to the new
production. The pessimists declared it to be a mad venture; the
optimists maintained that a great actress was going to astonish the
world. The sick leading lady, who was of course too ill to be
present, cursed fate in having been forced to give an opening to a
formidable rival. The friends of that same leading lady gathered in
somewhat gloomy force, prepared to report and condemn. The audience
was what the newspapers called a more than usually brilliant
assemblage, but as the house filled there were evidences of almost
painful tension. Friends looked anxious and alert. Critics gathered
in knots, after having deposited their opera hats, and talked
together as gravely as though the fate of a nation were at stake.
The pit and gallery were noisy and exuberant. Cosway Keele was a
favourite. He had never failed them yet, and they were prepared to
back his judgment now. Every now and then, as some recognized
celebrity took his seat, a cheer would float down from the ranks
above. Lendon was one of those thus greeted. It was freely
announced that he was principally responsible for the modernised
version of Webster's play, and also for the costumes of the
performers; and then, too, thanks to Mrs. Walcot Valbry, rumour
already credited him with more than a professional interest in the
new actress. He himself was strung to the extremest pitch of
nervousness. Mrs. Walcot Valbry, resplendent in diamonds, bent over
the edge of her box and nodded and beckoned him to come to her. She
bad one of the large boxes on the ground tier so that it was easy
for an occupant of the stalls to go to her without any troublesome
ceremony of knocking at doors. A great many of the dramatic critics
availed themselves of the privilege, and she had the satisfaction
of feeling that she was putting in a good word for her
<i>protégée</i>. As she sat in the corner seat facing the house,
she bowed till the diamonds on her white head twinkled like a rain
of dewdrops, and she looked like a benign fairy who felt herself
more or less responsible for the whole occasion, for did not
everyone know that it was at her house Cosway Keele had first seen
the American Improvisatrice? She was not the only attraction of the
box, which in truth drew towards it many pairs of eyes. Countess
Adrian sat looking towards the stage, and somewhat shielded by a
curtain from general observation, but Sir Donald Urquhart, in the
centre, was fully visible, and it was easy to guess who was the
lady monopolizing his attention. She, too, bent over and smiled and
nodded at London, and when he came to speak to her,
whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't be uneasy, your Improvisatrice shall not have to dread my
evil eye to-night&mdash;all my influence, all my wishes, will spur
her on to success."</p>

<p>And the overture began, and the play opened, and went on, it
seemed to Lendon, like the drama of a dream. And at last the
curtain did fall upon Antonio&mdash;or it would be more correct to
say, upon the Duchess&mdash;amid such a tempest of applause as
perhaps, in spite of all its famous revivals, had never been heard
within the walls of the Dionysion.</p>

<p>Needless to say that the play was mounted with all the splendour
and dramatic effect and strict attention to historic detail which
could make medieval Italy live again in modern London; needless to
say that Cosway Keele as Bosola, the finished villain, surpassed
all his previous impersonations, and that a new name was written on
the list of stage successes. All this was taken for granted and
melted into comparative insignificance before the stupendous
impression created by the new Duchess of MM. Beatrice had verified
all her admirers' most sanguine predictions, and in one night had
lifted herself to the rank of the Immortals. Her grace and dignity,
her exquisite pathos, her womanly passion, and, at the last, her
sublime and saint-like courage, literally took the house by storm.
There was an audible sob through the theatre when, just before her
cruel death, the Duchess begs that her little children may be cared
for&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">I pray thee, look thou giv'st my little boy<br>
Some syrup for his cold, and let the girl<br>
Say her prayers ere she sleep.</p>

<p>And again, as the strangling cords are round her&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">Pull, and pull strongly, for your able
strength,<br>
Must pull down heaven upon me;&mdash;<br>
Yet stay, heaven gates are not so highly arch'd<br>
As princes' palaces; they that enter there<br>
Must go upon their knees&mdash;Come, violent death,<br>
Serve for mandragora to make me steep!&mdash;</p>

<p>Lendon felt his whole being torn with wonder and emotion, and a
strange sweet despair. How could he ever hope to win this dazzling
creature, whose look, and word, and gesture could thrill and hold
spell-bound a vast assemblage such as this which watched her
to-night! And how pure womanly she was! In very soul and essence
the type of wife and mother! There lay the secret of her power! She
was almost fainting when Cosway Keele brought her forward. Her eye
turned to the upper box in which Lendon sat beside Mrs. Cubism. He
felt that they were lifted in yearning for sympathy, and, oh! with
what wild passionate love his heart went out to her! Mrs. Cubison
hurried down the narrow staircase and along the stone passage that
led behind. The word had gone round that, as usual on first nights,
Cosway Keele would hold a reception on the stage when all was over,
and half the occupants of the stalls and boxes were crowding round.
Lendon held back. It would have been agony to him that night to
join in the commonplace criticisms and the effusive ejaculations of
wonder and delight. Beatrice's triumph was to him too sacred a
thing for this. Mrs. Cubism bade him wait while she went into
Beatrice's dressing-room. Presently her dresser came out to say
that Miss Brett and Mrs. Cubison were going straight home and
wished Mr. Lendon to go with them.</p>

<p>It was not long before Beatrice herself, leaning shyly on Mrs.
Cubison's arm, stole down the passage so closely cloaked and hooded
as to be scarcely recognizable. At the same moment Cosway Keele
rushed out through the green-room door.</p>

<p>"Miss Brett, we are waiting for you. You will come on? All
London is longing to congratulate you."</p>

<p>"Not to-night," she answered. "Indeed, Mr. Keele, I cannot.
Indeed, I must go home. Tell me that you are pleased. That's all I
care about."</p>

<p>The manager took her two hands in his and pressed them
warmly.</p>

<p>"I have told you already what I think," he said. "You are finer
than the finest. God bless you, my dear, and thank you. Go home,
child," he added with feeling, "and sleep sweetly and dream of the
glorious future that is yours from to-night." He turned to Mrs.
Cubison, partly to conceal his emotion; he, too, was overwrought.
"You must have telegrams you want to send; I have arranged at the
office. Yon had better write them here."</p>

<p>"Why, certainly, there must go a cablegram to the Professor,"
cried Mrs. Cubison, and ran into the green room. Cosway Keele once
more clasped Beatrice's hand. The low roar of voices and laughter
from the stage reached them distinctly. "I mast go to my guests,"
he said. "We shall see you round, I suppose, presently,
Lendon?"</p>

<p>"He is coming with me," said Beatrice, and slipped her hand
within his arm.</p>

<p>Cosway Keele gave a quick look at both&mdash;a look which seemed
to take in the situation, and left them.</p>

<p>They stood in the narrow passage, her hand was on his arm, and
her sweet face was turned up to his.</p>

<p>"Beatrice&mdash;my love," he whispered wildly. "How can I dare
ask you to stoop to me&mdash;after to-night?"</p>

<p>"The curtain has fallen," she said softly. "Antonio Las had his
day."</p>

<p>Not one word more was spoken then. They understood each other.
Surely for the space of three minutes that narrow stone-paved
corridor was transformed into Elysium. Scene-shifters and supers
and dressers passed on their way out into the street, and looked
curiously at the young heroine of the evening cowering here in the
half-darkness, when not many paces distant champagne corks were
popping and glasses were passing, and some hundreds of the
best-known people in London were celebrating her triumph. Mrs.
Cubison came back having written and dispatched a little sheaf of
telegrams, and Lendon went to find the brougham and put them into
it and took his seat beside them. It was so strange driving through
the streets after all that had happened on that wondrous evening.
Beatrice leaned back like a broken lily; but her eyes glowed soft
and bright as stars. She did not speak. Fortunately for Lendon,
Mrs. Cubison rattled on, delivering a pecan of joy and
thanksgiving. The little house was all astir, and supper was laid
in the dining-room. Mrs. Cubison, intent on some domestic
arrangement, preceded them thither. She wanted to be certain that
the champagne had been iced. Lendon drew Beatrice into her own
little study where they had sat so often together.</p>

<p>She threw off her cloak and stood before him, her face very pale
and tremulous, with a strange, sweet, inviting smile on her lips,
and her golden hair shining round her.</p>

<p>"Beatrice&mdash;my darling!" Lendon cried; and he would have
taken her in his arms then and there; but something in her clear,
pure eyes, in her strange bright smile, that was so sweet and yet
so cold, something in her statuesque attitude rebuked his lover's
ardour. He let his hands fall upon her dress, but attempted no
closet embrace; then he lifted her cloak and then laid it down, and
wheeled forward a chair to the fire.</p>

<p>"Sit down," he said gently, "you must be very cold and very
Creel."</p>

<p>"I am not cold," she answered, "and I am too happy to be tired.
I never was so happy in all my life."</p>

<p>"Are you lonely, Beatrice, as you feared?" he said.</p>

<p>"No," she answered. "I am not lonely. You are sharing my joy
with me."</p>

<p>He knelt on the ground beside her, and took her hand and kissed
it.</p>

<p>"Beatrice, did you mean what you said in the theatre? Has
Antonio had his day, and is it my turn now? Oh I my love, be true
and frank. Don't keep me in suspense. I lore you with my whole
heart and soul. Tell me that you will be my wire."</p>

<p>"If you will take me, Bernard," she answered; "I will try to be
a true and loving wife; and I know that you will be good to me. You
won't expect too much from me, dear. I want you to be very gentle;
I want you to be very patient."</p>

<p>He took her in his arms and kissed her with tenderness, but with
no passion. It was not passion that she needed from him, but
protecting love. He had felt this from the first.</p>

<p>When they went out to the lighted supper-room, Beatrice shyly
took Bernard's hand and led him to Mrs. Cubison. "Marmy," she said,
"I have promised to be Mr. Lendon's wife?"</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX. MRS. WALCOT VALBRY'S
BALL.</h2>

<p>MRS. WALCOT VALBRY'S balls were always amusing functions, and
one that she gave in the July following the revival of the Duchess
of Malfi was more than usually crowded and more than usually talked
about.</p>

<p>In the first place she had a large detached house which had once
belonged to a famous Academician, and where the studio, built out
beyond the reception-rooms, made an ideal ball-room&mdash;it was
used as the supper-room at her ordinary "At Homes." Indeed,
secondly, Mrs. Walcot Valbry had a reputation for suppers. Her
champagne was beyond praise, and her guests were not obliged to
file down in relays to a long, narrow board and a sort of <i>table
d'hôte</i> collation, at which people ate in fear of their
neighbours' elbows. They were provided with a number or small
tables, with special waiters for each, and abundance of room in
which to take a leisurely repast, and to feast their minds as well
as their bodies with sallies of wit anti genial conversation. Then,
too, she was a kind of purveyor of American beauty, and more than
one lovely lady celebrated in higher circles had made her
<i>dèbut</i> in London society under Mrs. Walcot Valbry's wing.
Moreover, everyone knew that she went in for stars of the
theatrical profession, and everyone remembered the performance of
the Improvisatrice that spring&mdash;much quoted since the
Dionysian revival&mdash;and everyone took it for granted that the
Duchess of Malfi&mdash;as they called Beatrice&mdash;would be
present.</p>

<p>For the Duchess of Malfi was the rage, and when Lendon sets up
an idol she certainly does not stint her incense. Beatrice's
photographs were everywhere&mdash;in shop windows and on
drawing-room tables. Certain great ladies dropped cards of
invitation at the little house in Regent's Park, and certain
distinguished gentlemen made requests for her presence at their
supper-parties. Newspaper people interviewed her, painters begged
for remission to take her portrait; she was pestered with
entreaties to hold stalls at fancy fairs, and to assist at
charitable entertainments. The lesser crowd of lion-hunters
besieged her, and love-letters from the mashers of the stalls
rained upon her. Mrs. Cubison's position as sheep-dog was just now
no sinecure.</p>

<p>The play at the Dionysian was never over till past eleven, and
Lendon, knew that Beatrice could not arrive at Mrs. Walcot Valbry's
till long after the dancing hail begun. He was at the theatre as
usual; indeed he bad made himself rather conspicuous by his
constant attendance, which was hardly now to be excused on the plea
of his part in the revival. Again he had delighted eyes and heart,
and had followed line by line, mood by mood, the exhibition of that
rare and spiritual passion, that absolute self-surrender of the
actress to her ecstasy of love which yet seemed all a madness of
soul with no part of sense. It was to him a foretaste of almost
unrealizable bliss to watch this beautiful creature as she thrilled
with the emotion of her part, and to know that he alone had a
lover's right to the exquisite lips, that for his own secret
delight were reserved all those graces of womanhood, and that for
his ear was destined love-talk tenderly intimate and heavenly sweet
as, in those short days of wedded bliss, the ill-fated Duchess
whispered in the ears of Antonio.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, he had never during the love-scenes&mdash;some
of them emotional and impassioned enough, between the Duchess and
Antonio&mdash;felt any thrill of jealousy on account of the
smoothly locutionary lover.</p>

<p>To-night it seemed to him that Beatrice was finer than usual.
The interest had risen to enthusiasm. Stalls and boxes were full,
and the pit and galleries were densely packed. The curtain was
raised several times at the end of each act; and at the close of
the performance the calls and shouts of "Brava!" were deafening,
till Beatrice appeared once more before the curtain, and, pale and
overwrought, bowed her acknowledgments of the applause. Lendon went
round to the stage entrance and waited till the actress came out.
He was in the habit of seeing her and Mrs. Cubison, who usually
accompanied her, into their brougham; but he had never, since the
first night of "The Duchess," gone behind the scenes. The
management at the Dionysion was despotic, and not even to the
leading lady might note or message be conveyed till her part for
the evening was over. To-night Beatrice came out alone. Mrs.
Cubison, she explained afterwards, had a headache and was resting
in preparation for her labours of chaperone at the ball later on.
The girl looked white and weary, and he fancied a little
distraught, as though the emotion of those harrowing scenes was
still racking her. She gave him to hold, as was her custom, the
little bag in which nightly she carried home the jewels she had
worn, and put her hand through his arm with an air of gladness and,
relief.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bernard," she whispered, "it was nice of yon to come round.
I wanted you to-night."</p>

<p>"Why to-night?" he asked anxiously. "Darling, are you ill?"</p>

<p>"No, not ill. But I have a strange feeling&mdash;I have had it
all day&mdash;a feeling of sadness and dread, a sort of
presentiment of coming evil. Don't laugh at me, Bernard. You know I
am not made of the same sort of stuff as your practical
matter-of-fact people. I believe in these things."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I am too anxious and unhappy about you to feel inclined
to smile at your presentiments," he said. "Did you not see to-night
how real it all Was?" she went on. "I was not acting. I was not the
Duchess of Malfi. I was Beatrice Brett parting for ever from the
man she loves. Bernard"&mdash;and as they stood outside the little
paved lane she clung to him almost wildly&mdash;"something is going
to part us. I know it; I feel it. Oh! fight against it. Don't let
it happen. Keep me safe."</p>

<p>"My dearest," he said gravely, his voice trembling with emotion,
"nothing shall pare us on this side of the grave&mdash;nothing,
except your own will, Beatrice. Don't be frightened, dear. See, you
are trembling with nervousness and exhaustion. That play takes too
much out of you. If you weren't overdone, you couldn't have fancies
like this."</p>

<p>"Ever since I was a child I have had fancies, as you call them.
I have always had a foreshadowing presentiment before any great
event in my life. Something will happen to me soon, and it will not
be for good. But I'm not going to give way to morbidness, Bernard.
I shall go home now and dress for my ball, and try to put dark
thoughts aside."</p>

<p>He put her into the carriage and let her take the bag with her
trinkets from him. Then, instead of closing the door, he got in
after her.</p>

<p>"No, no," she exclaimed, "I have alarmed you quite needlessly. I
assure you I am perfectly well."</p>

<p>His only answer was to take her in his arms and kiss her
passionately. He rarely allowed his love for her to have its full
vent. Perhaps it was something impersonal and cold in her which
checked its overflow. She never scorned to him so much an ordinary
woman as an ideal to be reverenced. But to-night he could not
restrain himself, and she yielded herself with a little sigh of
content to his embrace. They scarcely spoke; but she let her head
rest upon his shoulder, and his arm was round her, and his lips
brushed her hair as he rapturously pictured to himself the time
when she would be all his own. They drove quickly on. He had never
driven with her alone so at night before. The lights of the hansoms
flashing by, the clusters of lamps, the intoxication of the
caress&mdash;all seemed part of some wonderful dream. The carriage
stopped at last. She raised herself with a little laugh.</p>

<p>"Now you must get into a hansom and drive quickly to Mrs. Walcot
Valbry's, and tell her that as soon as I am dressed I am coming
along."</p>

<p>"Dearest," he said, "are you well enough for a ball
to-night?"</p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. Walcot Valbry would be just, mad if I disappointed
her, and all her grand people who want to stare at the poor little
American actress I I had a frantic note from her this morning,
begging me not to be late. And, besides, I have never danced with
you, Bernard; and I'm so fond of dancing, and we are going to waltz
together to-night."</p>

<p>She jumped from the carriage while she spoke, waving him back as
she ran along the paved causeway to the house. "Quick," she cried,
"tell them I am coming," and disappeared within the hall-door which
Mrs. Cubison, on the watch, threw open.</p>

<p>Lendon remembered, as he drove along, that Countess Adrian had
that morning laughingly engaged him to dance the first waltz after
midnight. She had insisted upon his coining up to her, no matter
with whom she might be talking, exactly as the clock struck. "It
will be the first time that I shall have danced," she said, "for
five years."</p>

<p>"Why is that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Because the doctor, who found out that my heart was affected,
told me to avoid any violent exercise or excitement. That was in
the days of the whirling <i>deux temps</i>," she added with a
laugh; "but you and I to-night will dance a slow and graceful
measure to celebrate the completion of the portrait, and the happy
course of our friendship."</p>

<p>Remorsefully he reflected now that midnight was passed.</p>

<p>She was the first person who greeted him after he had paid his
respects and delivered Beatrice's message to Mrs. Walcot Valbry.
She was coming towards him on Sir Donald Urquhart's arm, which she
relinquished as he approached. "You are too late," she said.</p>

<p>"Countess, a thousand apologies. The fact is that&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped him with a gesture, at the same moment taking his
arm, and dismissing Sir Donald with a smile and a nod. "Don't tell
me that you forgot me. That would be a sore wound to my vanity, and
I am in the mood to enjoy myself to-night."</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Countess. I was unavoidably detained by the
illness&mdash;of a friend."</p>

<p>"A friend!" she repeated.</p>

<p>"They are playing another waltz now," he rejoined hastily, as
the band broke into a prelude that be knew. "Will you give it to me
instead?"</p>

<p>"No, we will not dance this one," she answered. "I am tired. I
want to talk. Take me to the conservatory, and let us wait there
for the next waltz."</p>

<p>They threaded their way through the long room. The dream-like
feeling was upon him still. The reflection of the electric lights
on the parquet floor reminded him of the lamps shining on the
asphalte as he had driven with Beatrice from the theatre, and the
thrill of Beatrice's touch stirred him yet.</p>

<p>Strange how a mood inspired by one woman reacts again upon
another woman! It was as though Countess Adrian were touched with
something of the same dream-like magic. It seemed to him that her
voice had a note of ineffable tenderness, as she said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have so looked forward to to-night, since we parted."</p>

<p>"This morning, Countess;" Lendon answered.</p>

<p>"Yes, only this morning; but does not one sometimes live years
in a day? I have sat alone&mdash;alone, thinking, dreaming,
wondering, during the hours that have passed since I left you."</p>

<p>"Has anything happened&mdash;tell me&mdash;in those hours?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, my friend, except perhaps the end of a
friendship."</p>

<p>"You speak of our friendship?" he said eagerly. She bowed her
head.</p>

<p>"Surely," he added, "that need not end because the portrait is
finished?"</p>

<p>"I think it will," she answered. "There are more ways than one
of ending a friendship. Are you sorry the portrait is finished?"
she asked suddenly.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered unhesitatingly. There was in his mind no
shadow of falsity to Beatrice. If some faint doubt of Countess
Adrian's feeling for himself had ever glanced across it, he had
dismissed the fancy with a smile at his own vanity. Remembering
what she had told him, taking her at her own showing as a trusty
comrade&mdash;a woman in need of friends and not finding them
readily among her own sex, believing that she was-world-worn,
satiated with admiration, hard to please, with indeed a heart that
could only be roused by some glittering prince of romance who would
appeal to that element of the dramatic, the luxurious, and the
splendid which formed so large a part of her nature, it would have
appeared to him absolutely impossible that she could fall seriously
in love with a work-a day artist in prosaic Lendon, who professed
nothing more for her than friendship. He liked her; she interested
him intensely, speaking in the abstract, in her way, perhaps, quite
as much as Beatrice.</p>

<p>He delighted in her beauty, her curious grace, the charm of her
conversation, and the frank audacity with which she laid herself
bare before him. But love That belonged to a secret inner chamber
of which Countess Adrian could never possess the key.</p>

<p>"I have had a pleasant task, Countess," he went on. "To watch
you, to paint you would have been almost pleasure enough to an
artist; but when the charm of hearing you talk is added, and the
privilege of being admitted to a certain extent into your
confidence, why then the artist is a favoured mortal, indeed."</p>

<p>"We won't talk the language of compliments to-night," she said,
with a melancholy that deeply touched him; "I have had too much of
that; I should like something different from you."</p>

<p>"If mine is the language of compliment, at least you will
believe it is sincere," he said.</p>

<p>They were standing in the conservatory which was a fairy-land of
palms and blossom, cushioned lounges and pale electric stars. At
the furthest end was an archway draped with Moorish curtains. "Have
you seen Mrs. Walcot Valbry's Eastern room?" she asked. "Come; we
shall be quiet there." She drew aside the curtains which fell
behind them as they passed through. They found themselves in a
wonderful "Liberty" apartment&mdash;draperies, divans, canopied
ceiling, soft shaded lamp of quaint designs, idols, and orchids,
the whole pervaded by a delicate Oriental perfume&mdash;a
"flirtation corner" which did not appear as yet to have attracted
the attention of Mrs. Walcot Valbry's guests. Countess Adrian sank
upon a divan. "Sit here," she said.</p>

<p>Lendon did not at once comply with the invitation, but stood
looking at her, his artist eye taking in and enjoying the beauty of
the picture she presented.</p>

<p>"I wish," he said, "that I had seen you before in that dress. I
should have liked to paint you in it."</p>

<p>The soft amber stuff, with its shining embroidery, was certainly
well suited to her clear ivory skin and dark eyes and hair, and was
made in a fashion that showed to peculiar advantage the magnificent
lines of her throat and bust. Her arms were bare to the shoulders
and clasped with barbaric looking armlets of gold set with uncut
stones. Her breast heaved beneath its transparent drapery, as if
with some pent emotion. Her lips parted in a dreamy smile; the
expression of her eyes as they gazed into his was indescribably
alluring, and the dark brown shade beneath the lower lid enhanced
their penetrating lustre. There was about her a conscious witchery
and abandon which, in spite of himself, in spite of the image
enshrined in his heart, set his blood coursing faster. She might
indeed at that moment have postured as the embodiment of sensuous
charm.</p>

<p>"Tell me&mdash;" she began, still looking at him with that
curious intentness, then stopped.</p>

<p>He seated himself beside her, "What is it that you wish me to
tell you?"</p>

<p>"No!" she answered. "<i>I</i> will tell <i>you</i> something. Do you remember
what I once said to you about my superstition in regard to this
year?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," he replied.</p>

<p>"The astrologer, who foretold that this year would he fateful to
me, fixed the very time at which the crisis would take plate. That
time is now."</p>

<p>"Now!" he repeated, startled.</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>now</i>! The first and second hours of the morning.
These are the hours which will decide my destiny. That is why I
begged you to come to me when midnight struck. I wanted to see your
face&mdash;to feel that you were near me. I wanted you to share the
ordeal with me." She laid her ungloved hand softly upon his. It was
dry and hot, and he felt the fingers quivering as they touched his
flesh.</p>

<p>"Countess, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Do you think I am working up a melodramatic effect for your
especial amusement? Ah! I I assure you that I am too serious to be
melodramatic. My whole life is at stake, and I am tortured by
anxiety&mdash;hope&mdash;doubt&mdash;dread. I watched for you. I
waited. You were late. The clock struck. You did not come. It was
an ill portent."</p>

<p>"Countess Adrian, you bewilder me. This is a modern London ball;
and you and I were engaged to dance a waltz together. Surely, the
days of astrologers and magic and portents are passed; and my
experience of destiny is that she works in common-place fashion and
does not usually prepare so elaborate a <i>mise-en-scène</i>, when
she deals out her crushing calamities, or her most precious
benefits."</p>

<p>"You are right. Destiny is a poor stage-manager as a rule, and
for to-night I would have chosen a different <i>mise-en-scene</i>. But
destiny only knows whether the curtain is to fall on a tragedy, or
on wedding bells&mdash;and perhaps for either, a ball-room is the
most appropriate background."</p>

<p>"Tell me, Countess, since we are friends&mdash;what is it that
you hope for? What is it that you dread?"</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you&mdash;Bernard?" She lingered with musical
cadence on his name; it was the first time she had ever called him
by it. "I said to you the second time we met, that everything had
happened to me&mdash;everything&mdash;except death and love.
Suppose that the one supreme experience for which I have longed,
and that yet has filled me with terror, has come to me at
bast&mdash;silently, overpoweringly. Suppose that for the first
time in my life&mdash;I&mdash;love."</p>

<p>"To suppose that, Countess," he said, with a forced lightness
that seemed to him at the moment a mockery of himself, "is to
suppose that at least there is one happy man in the world."</p>

<p>"You think," she said slowly, "that I could make any man love
me?"</p>

<p>"Would he not be curiously insensible if <i>you</i> could not touch his
heart?"</p>

<p>"But if," she said, "if the man whom I love had once been sorely
wounded by a woman's treachery, and had hardened himself against
all other women&mdash;if he were of a self-contained nature, slow
to believe that he could inspire love&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Surely in that case only time and opportunity are needed. Love
has a way of breaking down such barriers."</p>

<p>"But if he had been given an opportunity&mdash;if all that a
woman could say had been said, and if he had never by word or look
conveyed that he cared for her in any way other than as a
friend&mdash;"</p>

<p>She broke off agitatedly; but she had said too much. Her full
meaning flashed upon him. He gave a startled exclamation, and drew
slightly back. Her throbbing fingers tightened on his hand. She
bent over towards him, her head thrown back, her breath coming
quickly, her glowing eyes burning upon his, every pulse in her
quivering with emotion.</p>

<p>"Would he he strong enough&mdash;cruel enough to repulse such a
woman as I am, Bernard?" she went on in low tremulous
terms&mdash;"if for his sake she, this woman, were to cast away her
womanly pride&mdash;she to whom so many have poured out love, and
who has accepted it so disdainfully&mdash;if she were to say to him
with all the fullness of her soul, 'I love you. Take me. Do with me
what you will. Make me your slave&mdash;only love me.'"</p>

<p>"And if that were impossible," Bernard answered, no less
agitated than she herself. "If, while admiring her above all women,
valuing her friendship, honouring her for her noble frankness, he
were yet unable to give back the love she offered him, and which
under other conditions would have made his happiness&mdash;if this
were so&mdash;became his heart had been given before he knew her,
and another woman claimed all his devotion&mdash;"</p>

<p>She interrupted him with a little inarticulate cry; but only the
more closely did she cling to him, "Love me, Bernard," she
murmured, and all the passion of her being seemed concentrated in
the appeal. "Love me. Let the other woman go. <i>She</i> does not love you
as <i>I</i> love you. She cannot charm you as I would charm you. She cannot
give you what I could give you." As Countess Adrian spoke she
raised herself closer to him. Her arm stole round his neck, her
palpitating form pressed against his, and her lips met his in an
impassioned kiss. Thus for a moment they remained locked in each
other's embrace. For that moment he was like a man giddy and
overcome by some subtle magnetism, which enervated his will and
robbed him of all power of resistance. For a moment he gave himself
up to the intoxication of the contact&mdash;of her perfumed breath,
of her warm soft lips. He would have been more than man had he kept
his senses. "Agnes," he whispered, as he strained her closer. Then
with a sudden shock of revulsion came the thought of Beatrice and
of her pure love. It steeled him and gave him new strength. He rose
from the divan and put Agnes gently from him. She seemed
instinctively to realise that his mood had changed; her arms
relaxed and the flame in her sank.</p>

<p>"Agnes," he said, "forgive me this moment of madness. Let us
forget it. Let us keep our friendship. I could not bear to forfeit
that."</p>

<p>"You!" she cried wildly. "What have you done? I offered you my
love, it is I who am shamed."</p>

<p>"There is no shame in love." He bent his head and with great
respect kissed her hand. "I am not worthy that you should do me
this honour. Six months ago I could have loved you with all the
ardour that you could wish. Yes, there's no treason to <i>her</i> in
saying that. But now, it is she who has all my heart, and this is
impossible."</p>

<p>Countess Adrian moved away from him as he spoke. She drew a deep
long breath like the moan of a wounded animal. The sound cut his
very heart. All the glow and transport had gone from her face,
leaving an ashy pallor and strange stillness. She stood for a
second or two perfectly silent, her hand pressed against her side
as if she were suffering. Presently she said, in a voice that had
utterly changed:</p>

<p>"It is all over then&mdash;I want to know&mdash;who is it that
you love?"</p>

<p>"I am engaged to marry Miss Beatrice Brett," he answered.</p>

<p>"The actress! I might have known that." Again she paused. "Mr.
Lendon, you are right. This has been a moment of madness, and there
is nothing for us but to try and forget it. Spare me now, and do
not let word or look in the future remind me of my
humiliation."</p>

<p>"Ah! do not misjudge me. Should I not value you more and not
less for this? Surely, you and I can stand&mdash;soul to
soul&mdash;outside conventions."</p>

<p>"That was the agreement we made," she said, with a wan smile.
"Very well, let it be so. You are great enough for a woman to be
safe with you. But&mdash;it is not so certain that I can be safe
with myself. After to-night I shall never willingly see you again.
But I shall not misjudge you, and I shall wish you happiness. Come,
let us go into the ball-room."</p>

<p>He led her out in silence. The waltz was still going on. As they
stood at the entrance of the conservatory he saw Beatrice enter.
She was all in white, flushed and radiant, with a bouquet of lilies
in her hand. So beautiful was she, so pure, and so ethereal, that
her presence, following on that strange scene, seemed to him like
that of some rebuking heavenly visitant. She recognized him and
smiled. Countess Adrian also was watching her. Again he heard that
low curious moan and looked at her in alarm. Her deathly paleness
struck him. He saw that she was commanding all the force of her
will to sustain her strength.</p>

<p>"Countess," he exclaimed, pierced with remorse, "you are not
well."</p>

<p>She looked up bravely. "I am quite well&mdash;well enough to
keep our engagement. This waltz is mine, remember. We will
dance&mdash;for the first and last time."</p>

<p>He put his arm around her, and they glided out among the
dancers. Presently the waltz changed its strain. It had been a
plaintive and dreamy air. Now it clashed out in wild, fast rhythm
that had something uncanny in its discords. His partner's form
undulated with the music. Tall and magnificently framed as she was,
so lightly did she dance, so entirely was her every movement in
harmony with the measure, so rapid was the gliding pace she kept,
that it seemed to him as though he were guiding a being possessed.
Three mad whirls they made, then there was a rush, a shrieking of
the violins, a long drawn closing chord, and the waltz was at an
end.</p>

<p>They paused at the spot where Beatrice was standing. She was
leaning against a crimson-draped pillar, fanning herself slowly,
and talking to Sir Donald Urquhart, who was by her side. The two
women faced each other. At the sight of Countess Adrian, the light
went out of Beatrice's eyes. The motion of her fan ceased. She
shrank back a little and cast a look at Lendon as if imploring his
support. The Countess took her hand away from his arm, and he moved
a step, ranging himself, as it were, on the side of the woman he
loved. Countess Adrian advanced. "Miss Brett," she said, "I am Mr.
Lendon's friend. Will you let me offer my congratulations to his
future wife?" Lendon watched Beatrice's face. He saw the same dazed
expression creep over it as upon that occasion when her performance
had been interrupted by Countess Adrian's malign influence. The fan
dropped from her hand. With an effort she appeared to try and brace
herself, staggering a little as she moved forward. She looked
wildly around, and half extended her hand, then her limbs drooped
flaccidly again. She tottered against the pillar, and every drop of
blood seemed to leave her cheeks. The Countess took her hand and
stood tall and erect before the shrinking girl. Her bosom dilated
as if she were drawing in strength. For a moment she did not speak.
It was a strange scene. Lendon felt his heart throb with fear and
suspense. He looked from Beatrice to Countess Adrian. Never had he
seen so sudden and curious a change in the face of any human being.
It was like the contrast between dead grey ashes and living fire.
The impression she gave him was one of demoniac power. Her eyes
glowed with an unearthly lustre from her white face. Her features
were rigid, her frame tense as though she were concentrating all
her force in one superhuman effort of will. It only tasted for a
second, and Beatrice's eyes, large, blank, cowed, were drawn as by
a magnet into that terrible compelling gaze. The girl trembled and
yet looked fascinated, like a helpless victim before the snake
makes its fatal spring. Countess Adrian went nearer. She spoke with
a low, intense utterance words that burned like fire into Lendon's
heart.</p>

<p>"You are going to be his wife," she said. "To you is given all
that has been denied to me. I will give you more and yet more. I
will give you the desire with which I have desired him, the
yearning, the doubt', the agony with which I have striven for his
love. I will give you the passion with which he has filled my
heart, to be my torment and my heaven. I will give you of my
strength and of my life. I will give you of my spirit and of my
sense, till my soul itself shall live in you, and in loving you he
shall love me whom he has scorned. This shall be my bridal gift to
you, and with my kiss I seal it."</p>

<p>The red ripe lips of Countess Adrian bent down to Beatrice's
lips and clung to them in a vampire kiss which seemed to drain the
very life-breath from the girl's body. She uttered no sound, but as
Countess Adrian moved from her she sank white and limp into
Lendon's arms. Countess Adrian stood for a moment, rigid, and with
staring glassy eyes. Then, with a sudden piercing cry, she pressed
her hands to her heart, her body swayed, and she fell dead upon the
floor.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X. THE AVATAR.</h2>

<p>ON the next morning all London rang with the tragic event which
had taken place at Mrs. Walcot Valbry's ball.</p>

<p>Countess Adrian was dead. The cause of her death was clear
enough. Her doctors knew that she had been long suffering from
heart disease, and they had warned her that any violent exertion
must prove fatal. She had danced a waltz, and a few minutes
afterwards her heart had ceased to beat. This was what science
declared. Science was more puzzled by the simultaneous and
prolonged fainting-fit of the young American actress who was the
last person to whom Countess Adrian had spoken. Countess Adrian had
drawn her last breath in the giving of that kiss of fate; and
Beatrice Brett, stricken by the horror of the shock, had lain
unconscious ever since the dead woman's lips touched hers.</p>

<p>They took the girl home and laid her upon her bed. Ail night and
ell the next day Lendon watched below. Every effort to restore her
proved unavailing. Doctors came and went. Mrs. Cubison wept and
bemoaned Professor's Viall's absence. Cosway Keele drove down in an
agony of anxiety. Newspaper people called to get the latest
intelligence for the evening papers. The Duchess of Malfi's
mysterious swoon was the talk of the hour. The next day, the
tragedy of Countess Adrian, as one of the papers had it, in
sensational type, had become a secondary affair. London could do
without, Countess Adrian, but it could not calmly contemplate the
loss of its Duchess of Malfi. Placards were posted at the theatre.
Hurried rehearsals were called, and Beatrice's understudy stepped
into prominence and exulted in secret over the calamity which had
given her her great opp&mdash;I. Utility. The doctors agreed that
the long trance was cataleptic, and that nothing could be done but
to watch and wait. The two women lay, each cold and motionless, the
living, to all outward semblance, as lifeless as the dead. But
there were no wreaths and crosses round Beatrice's still body, and
the summer sun threw gleams through the half-drawn blinds, while
Countess Adrian rested in state in a darkened chamber, with
watchers and tapers at her bead and feet, and the room was heavy
with the scent of funeral flowers. She was very lonely in her
death. No one eared much&mdash;except, indeed, Sir Donald Urquhart.
She had no relations. She had very few friends. She had had many
lovers, but only one was faithful to her at the last. The wreaths
which heaped her bier were sent by acquaintances who shed not one
tear because she was dead. Lendon brought a cluster of white roses
with faint pink hearts and laid them himself between the cold
hands.</p>

<p>From Queen Anne's Mansions he went to the house in Regent's
Park. It was now the third day since Beatrice's strange seizure. As
Mrs. Cubison came towards him, he asked, hoarsely "Is there any
change?"</p>

<p>"She has moved," answered Mrs. Cubism; "her eyes look natural
again. It's Inskip's doing. The Professor telegraphed us to send
for Inskip. He is a professional magnetizer, you know. I tried him
once for neuralgia, but being a positive myself and he being
another positive, nothing came of it. He's not like the
Professor&mdash;quite a common man and on a different plane
altogether; but he has done Beaty good."</p>

<p>"And what does he think is the cause of her illness?" asked
Lendon, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh! he doesn't know&mdash;they none of them do. There's no
knowing how influences will affect a person that's subject to
them," said Mrs. Cubism, vaguely; "and for my part I'm only
thankful that Beaty doesn't take them in the same way as her
mother. Inskip says that she'll soon be right again."</p>

<p>The relief was inexpressible. Lendon could almost have wept
tears of joy. Mrs. Cubism sent him away. Inskip and the doctors had
agreed that sleep was the best restorer, and she wanted to keep the
house as quiet as possible. She promised to telegraph, and told him
that he might come back in the evening. He went to his studio and
occupied himself feverishly during the intervals of the hourly
bulletins which announced Beatrice's progress.</p>

<p>The portrait of Countess Adrian, glowing with beauty and with
all the appearance of inextinguishable life, stood in mockery upon
its easel, and oppressed him like a living presence. He removed the
canvas and turned it with its face to the wail. The place seemed
steeped in associations of the dead woman. He wandered up and down
the studio. The telegrams came regularly. Beatrice breathed
naturally. She had recognized her Aunt. The last bulletin told that
she was sleeping a sweet healthful sleep.</p>

<p>The summer dusk crept up. The room was full of shadows. He could
almost fancy, as he leaned back in his chair, that Countess
Adrian's ghost was sitting in the place where she had been
accustomed to sit, or was standing on the gallery steps as she had
stood and looked down on him that day that she had questioned him
so abruptly about Beatrice. The yellow-covered French
novel&mdash;"The Avatar"&mdash;reminded him afresh of her. He tried
to shake off the memory and walked to the window and gazed out into
the twilight. As he stood, an awesome eerie feeling came over him.
Suddenly he became conscious of another presence. Some one was
standing beside him. He knew that it was Beatrice. He seemed to
feel her soft breathing. He recognized a faint familiar perfume. He
gazed&mdash;there was nothing; and yet she was there. "Beatrice,"
he whispered; and a voice answered in low mysterious tones,
thrilling with tenderness, "Bernard." Then the presence melted, and
though he saw no vanishing vision, heard. no parting sound, he knew
that she was gone.</p>

<p>He remained for some moments transfixed, dazed, the one thought
only possessing him. She was dead, and her spirit had come to bid
him farewell, he ran out into the street, hailed a hansom, and bade
the driver go with all possible speed to Regent's Park. Lights were
moving in the windows. The sight confirmed hip despair. There was
no motive now for keeping stillness. The doctor's brougham was
before the house. As Lendon rushed to the door it was opened from
within; the doctor came out. Lendon's lips could scarcely frame the
enquiry. The physician was a friend of his and guessed the state of
affairs.</p>

<p>"Don't distress yourself, Lendon," he said kindly. "She will do
well enough now. Magnetism&mdash;charlatanism, one might
say&mdash;has succeeded where our science was helpless. The passes
threw her into a natural sleep of three hours. She has awakened and
seems herself again. In a night or two we shall have our Duchess of
Malfi on the boards once more. Let me have a form, by the way, and
telegraph to let Cosway Keele know the good news."</p>

<p>"She is not dead?" cried Lendon, confused by the sudden
revulsion.</p>

<p>"Not dead! I should think not. She has spoken; she has eaten. In
a few days, perhaps, you may see her. For the present, I have
ordered absolute quiet. I am afraid of her asking questions about
Countess Adrian and reviving that terrible impression. What an
extraordinary thing that was! Poor woman She had such an intense
terror of death."</p>

<p>Minion shuddered as he remembered her passionate cry, "Give me
life; oh, long life."</p>

<p>"And what a magnificent woman!" the doctor went on. "It is
almost impossible to imagine so brilliant a flame could be put out
in an instant&mdash;for ever. Has it ever occurred to you, Lendon,
that the one great force on which the very world depends&mdash;that
of human existence&mdash;falsifies all the laws of science and
vanishes, leaving no trace?"</p>

<p>"Don't you believe in the soul, doctor?"</p>

<p>"The soul!" Doctor Sheriff&mdash;so he was called&mdash;shrugged
his shoulders. "I believe in the vital principle; and I want to
know into what sort of ethereal gas it is transmuted. Does it
exhaust itself in the atmosphere? Does it enrich another
organization, or does it simply go out?"</p>

<p>"Ah," said Lendon, "we want Maddox Challis to tell us that."</p>

<p>The doctor shrugged his shoulders again. "Are you one of his
disciples? Did you see in the paper yesterday that he had left
Damascus, and was gone to his hermit's cave in the mountains? On
second thoughts, call round by Cosway Keele's rooms, they are in my
way. Good by." And the doctor stepped into his brougham and drove
off.</p>

<p class="cpb">* * *</p>

<p>It was the day after Countess Adrian's funeral, and Lendon, with
heart beating like that of the most timid undeclared lover, stood
for the first time since her illness on the threshold of Beatrice's
sitting-room.</p>

<p>He had expected some change in her. He had expected to find her
with wasted body, and nerves strained by the and the shock she had
undergone. He had expected her to be shy and silent, and to shrink
perhaps a little from his too frank ebullition of feeling. He had
pictured her as even more reticent, more virginal, than was her
wont. He had determined that no demonstration on his part should
jar or frighten her. He had imagined her submitting at first a
little constrainedly to his caresses, and then gradually gaining
confidence and satisfaction in them from their very gentleness, and
at last yielding herself sweetly to his embrace, and resting
contentedly in his arms like a fluttering bird in its mother's
nest.</p>

<p>But the Beatrice who met him was not the Beatrice of his
imaginings. He could not, at the first glance, tell wherein lay the
subtle change, and yet from the first glance he was conscious of
it. She was not resting on her sofa beneath the window, with her
books around her, as he had been accustomed to see her. She was
pacing the little room restlessly; her cheeks were flushed; there
was an alertness in her air and gestures, and a feverish expectancy
in her eyes, which seemed at once brighter, more dreamy, and less
limpidly serene. She gave him an odd indefinable impression of
greater physical vigour than he had ever associated with the
fragile, sensitive creature, whose slender frame seemed worn by the
fire of genius that burned within it. She made a glad movement
towards him, and was in his arms, and he was pressing his lips on
hers, and returning hot, eager, lovers' kisses. All his vague
doubts and scruples fled. There was only the rapture of reunion. He
was not afraid now of frightening her. She drew him to the sofa
beside her, and leaned against him and looked up at him, her eyes
beaming with emotion.</p>

<p>"Bernard," she said, "you love me&mdash;you love me!
<i>me&mdash;me</i>&mdash;only me!"</p>

<p>He kissed her again and again. Never were lovers' protestations
fonder.</p>

<p>"It is so sweet to hear those words&mdash;so sweet to feel your
arms about me, to know that you are mine&mdash;all mine," she
whispered. "Oh! Bernard, it has been such a long night&mdash;such a
long dark night."</p>

<p>"You have been very ill, dearest."</p>

<p>She shuddered. "What happened? I don't know; I can't remember. I
remember nothing except those eyes&mdash;flames that seemed to burn
into my very being; and then sudden pain and darkness, intense
black darkness. It seemed to me as if my body lay helpless and
bound, that my soul was hovering above the earth, utterly cold,
lonely, desolate. I knew that I was dead, and I hungered for the
joy of life. I hungered for the joy of love. I felt that I had lost
you, Bernard&mdash;that you were living and that I was wandering in
black space, and oh, so cold&mdash;so cold! I craved to be with
you. I yearned for you with the wildest yearning. And then it
seemed to me that my soul willed with all its might and strength
that it might live, and that you might love me&mdash;as I love you.
And then I awoke. Say that you love me, Bernard."</p>

<p>"My darling, is there any need for that? Do you not know that I
love you?"</p>

<p>"But not as I love you. I cannot live without you. Your touch
thrills me like some strange electric current. I want to be near
you. Your presence seems to warm and vivify me and fill me with all
kinds of wild delicious fancies. I shall think of you to-night, and
you only, when I am playing the Duchess of Malfi."</p>

<p>"You are going to play to-night?" he asked in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course&mdash;and in my love scene with Antonio I shall
see you&mdash;only you&mdash;and when I tell him of my love, I
shall speak to <i>you</i>. And when I say those words, take them to
your heart, for they will be for <i>you</i>. Don't you remember them?</p>

<p class="poem">"'You do tremble<br>
Make not your heart so dead a piece of flesh<br>
To fear more than to love me. Sir, be confident<br>
What is't distracts you? This is flesh and blood, sir...'"</p>

<p>She drew him down to her with a seductive gesture, and her arms
interlaced his neck in an impassioned embrace. But though be held
her close, and kissed back the red warm lips, there ran through him
a strange shiver of recoil. A feeling of trouble and terror came
over him. An indescribable sort of magnetism seemed to emanate from
her that excited and pained him, and turned him giddy. What did it
mean? Was it possible that any show of affection from the woman he
idolized could for an instant shock and repel him? And yet this
fervid passion did repel him, though a moment afterwards he hated
himself for the involuntary treason. Was it not she herself, his
Beatrice, with the violet eyes and the golden hair and the sweet
drooping mouth? and had be not welcomed so gladly any sign of
effusiveness from her in the earlier days when it was he who had
pleaded for her love, and it had been his lips which had timidly
sought hers, and her kisses had been rare as pearls, and fresh and
pure as morning dewdrops? He told himself that she was overwrought,
that she had passed through a dangerous crisis, and that the joy of
being restored to him sufficiently accounted for these unaccustomed
transports.</p>

<p>Then he gave himself up to the moment's happiness, which was so
strange a blending of rapture and suffering. For a little while
existence seemed narrowed to a lover's dream, and then came again
the throb of revulsion, He roused himself and shook his brain free
of the fumes which had mounted to it.</p>

<p>"It is time that I should go," he said. But she clung to him and
drew down his lips to hers. "I love you so, I love you so," she
whispered in passionate accents. "I have never known what it is to
live till now; and in my love for you is my life."</p>

<p>Was this his Beatrice whose form trembled in his embrace, whose
eyes gazed into his so strangely, whose hot arms entwined his neck
so that he used gentle force to unloose their clasp?</p>

<p>"Good-by," he said. He loosened the arms which entwined him.</p>

<p>"Till to-night," she murmured; "to-night you will come back with
me from the theatre. Marmy is ill&mdash;worn out, and I shall be
alone. Stay for a little while with me, and let us be happy
again."</p>

<p>"Till to-night," he answered, and left her, his whole being a
tumult of misery, joy, longing, and repugnance. He walked all the
way back to the studio. He felt like a man who has taken haschish
and has still self-control enough left to despise himself for his
weakness. His own sensations were an enigma to him. It seemed
impossible that Beatrice&mdash;his tender, dignified girlish
Beatrice, could have inspired him with feelings so wild and
contradictory. What did it mean? he asked himself over and over
again, and there was no answer to the riddle.</p>

<p>It was late when he got to the theatre. The excitement outside
was great. Placards announcing that all available space was
occupied were out over the box-office, and disappointed
pleasure-seekers wore turning away in little crowds. "Reappearance
of Miss Beatrice Brett after her serious illness" was announced in
large letters. Many of the critics had assembled. It was supposed
that Cosway Keele might hold one of his receptions "behind," to
celebrate the event. Lendon pushed his way in and reached his
stall. The first act was more than half over. It seemed to him that
even then there was in the theatre an atmosphere of excitement and
wonder. A pair of critics were whispering together over the backs
of their chains. "It is Simply extraordinary," he heard one of them
say as he brushed past. "The whole nature of the woman, is
changed." Behind him there was the same echo, "What does she mean?
Is it a new reading?" muttered a man whom he knew, in the ear of
his companion.</p>

<p>He had arrived during the Duchess' scene with Cariola in the
first act, and she was saying the concluding words which Beatrice
had been accustomed to deliver with an appealing pathos that was
irresistible&mdash;the pathos of a proud spirit forced by the
accident of birth to woo instead of being wooed, and shrinking from
the sacrifice of her womanly dignity, yet daring even misconception
for the sake of a pure absorbing love.</p>

<p>How strange! She gave those words now with a half-defiant
unsexed air as of a coquette who knows the power of her wiles, and
is determined, even at the cost of her fair fame, to bring the man
to her feet. Then followed the scene with Antonio, in which
Beatrice had always before been so tender, sweet, and
womanly&mdash;so pure, that in the very faith and fortitude of her
own purity she was free to come down and to defy conventionality,
and bid her lover come up to her. Now&mdash;what had come over her?
It was not a Duchess of Malfi, but a Catherine of Russia. It was
not the unconventionality of purity, but the recklessness of
passion. It was not the sister of Ferdinand, but Ferdinand's own
vile and brutal reading of his sister's character. The tone and
manner in which she spoke some of the lines made Lendon start and
shudder.</p>

<p class="poem">"&mdash;Awake, awake, man!<br>
I do here put off all vain ceremony,<br>
And only do appear to you a young widow<br>
That claims you for her husband, and, like a widow,<br>
I use but half a blush in't!"</p>

<p>With her eyes and her voice and her gesture, she stood the
embodied lust of the flesh.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI. THE EXORCISM.</h2>

<p>THE buzz of applause was over. This strange new Duchess, bold,
self-indulgent, cynical, who had thrown the world away for the
gratification of her passion and had met her doom with the courage
of a nature that fears neither God nor man, had come before the
=Lain and had curtsied to the cheers and clappings which her
remarkable performance deserved. Shocked, miserable and sick at
heart, Lendon was preparing to leave the theatre. His mind vividly
recalled the last occasion on which Beatrice had played the part,
when her acting had been wrought to so refined a pitch of spiritual
passion that there was scarcely a dry eye in the house as the
curtain fell to Ferdinand's remorseful ejaculation:</p>

<p class="poem">"Cover her face; mine eyes dazzle; she died
young."</p>

<p>This Duchess had called forth no tears, no emotion, sate that of
almost involuntary admiration of her dauntless bravery. The
prevailing sentiment was one of bewilderment. From a saint the
Duchess of Malfi had been transformed into an 'evil enchantress.
There were people who declared that her very physique had changed,
that her form seemed more luxuriantly moulded than before her
illness, and that her lips and eyes had acquired a peculiar and
voluptuous expression. A good many of the Dionysion clique stood in
knots about the stalls and lower boxes, and discussed the
phenomenon.</p>

<p>As had been anticipated the word went round that Cosway Keele
expected his immediate friends "behind," and these hundred and one
intimates were waiting till the ordinary crowd had departed, and
till the stage was cleared and the drop curtain once more raised.
It was with a little difficulty that Lendon steered his way
through. At each turn someone accosted him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lendon, what do you think of it?...It is
extraordinary!...It is disgusting!...It is too horrible! But how
could she have done it?...When could she have thought out such a
reading?...Do tell me, is she really not quite a proper
person?...It is impossible that she can be nice and yet act
<i>so</i>!"</p>

<p>Such were the confused remarks and murmurs. And again, from a
young lady artist, who delighted in the drama, "I think it is
simply utterly uncanny; but I never saw anything so powerful. I
loved the other Duchess of Ma, I hate this one."</p>

<p>A bearded critic, given to rather straight language, pulled
Lendon aside. "Good God! Lendon, what does she mean by this? You
know more of the girl than most of us. Why, in the name of Heaven,
has she started on that tack? Does she propose to rival Violet
Belavon?"&mdash;he named an actress whose name was uttered in
horror by even the more lax members of her profession&mdash;"I
never saw anything more damnably suggestive."</p>

<p>"But what a genius!" put in another critic, who had joined them.
"There has never been anything the least like it since Lucca
changed her first reading of Marguerite&mdash;only that was the
other way. And there's no doubt the character lends itself to the
coarser interpretation. It's much more likely the Duchess was a
sinner than a saint&mdash;much more in the spirit of medieval
Italy. It's audacious; but as I say, it's genius."</p>

<p>"Are you coming behind, Mr. Lendon?" somebody asked.</p>

<p>"No!" he returned, savagely. He could almost have throttled the
critic who had first spoken. That Beatrice&mdash;his Beatrice,
should be the subject of ribald remark! He heard in anticipation
the gossip of club suppers. That she, whom he had so loved and so
reverenced, should have dragged herself down to this! It was too
horrible! He passed a night of intense misery. Part of it was spent
in roaming the street; and then he went home and paced his room
till morning. He almost persuaded himself that he was a victim of
his own diseased imagination, bat the morning paper confirmed too
surely his impression of the night. He sent out for other papers.
All, in more or less suggestive language, gave the same verdict.
All expressed amazement at the singular genius which could
transform an impersonation of the purest, most womanly, poetry into
that of a high-born courtezan.</p>

<p>To a nature refined, sensitive, as that of Lendon, these
criticisms were torture. In his quieter moments, when he was not
writhing under the pain and shock which her presence caused him, he
thought, with the deepest pity, of the agony she must suffer when
she read the papers, and realized the feelings that her acting had
produced. She would recover from this temporary madness, for such
he felt certain was the cause of the change in her; and then, what
need of him she would have to comfort, and console her! He thought
of Mrs. Cubison's dark hints. He thought of cases he had read
about, in which most refined women had shown the first signs of
insanity by a coarseness in their demeanour that had shocked al
puzzled their friends. This was the clue to the mystery. Ire blamed
himself for his own passion of revolt. What was his love worth if
it could not bear this strain! It should be his part to tend and
cherish her in her sickness, and to help reawaken her own pure
exquisite nature. He was thinking thus when the curtain that
covered the gallery doer was drawn aside and, unannounced, Beatrice
herself descended the steps and came towards him. She was alone.
Never before had Beatrice come to him in this manner. Involuntarily
his mind leaped to the memory of Countess Adrian and of her first
visit to the studio.</p>

<p>"Beatrice!" he cried.</p>

<p>She had thrown back her veil and caught both his hands in hers,
which were hot and feverish. "I have come to you," she said;
"because you would not come to me, and I long for you. You are my
magnet, Bernard; and if you were at the other end of the world I
should fly to you. Why did you not keep your promise last night? I
watched, and watched. The night was so beautiful; and the moon was
shining, and I at at my window, and my heart called to you, 'Love;
Love&mdash;come.' Where were you? I left the theatre early; I would
not wait for the supper and the congratulations. Tell me. Did I
please you? Did you think me beautiful? Was I sweet to you&mdash;my
Antonio&mdash;my lover&mdash;my husband?"</p>

<p>"Beatrice," he said gravely, "have you read the papers? Do you
know what they say of your performance last night?"</p>

<p>She laughed lightly. "Oh! the critics. I have set them a riddle.
What does it matter about them? I was not acting to them, but to
<i>you</i>. I wanted to show you that I could love well. You saw
how the Duchess loved Antonio. That is how I love <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>Lendon drew back, half unconsciously.</p>

<p>"Why, my Antonio," she said, "how cold and constrained you are!
Where is your love? <i>The</i> Antonio was not like that. He could
meet his Duchess half way, at least, and take her to his heart.
Come&mdash;meet me half way." She advanced towards him.</p>

<p>"Beatrice," he said gravely. "I don't quite understand your
altered. manner. You are not quite yourself. You are not well. You
want care and tenderness and watching." He forced himself to talk
gently and kindly to her. His real self he felt sure must be all
gentleness and kindness to her. But there was something stirring in
his heart that seemed to keep him away from her, that seemed to
make him shrink from her, almost to make him hate her.</p>

<p>"Not well!" she exclaimed with a scornful laugh, "My solemn
Antonio, I am bubbling over with outrageous health and sheer animal
spirits, and with love for <i>you</i>. Come&mdash;talk to me like a
lover."</p>

<p>"You will find a lover&mdash;a true, devoted lover&mdash;in your
husband, Beatrice."</p>

<p>"Let us not wait too long, then I am sick of this separation,
this lonely life." There was something now in her tone that touched
him in spite of his revolt against her.</p>

<p>"We shall not wait long, we shall be married at once, as soon as
ever you wish." His heart seemed to sink as he spoke the words. A
fearful thought arose in him, was he as one who chains himself to a
maniac? Oh, what <i>had</i> become of his Beatrice?</p>

<p>"Oh, at once, at once," she said eagerly. "I long to be able to
call you mine for ever. You will be mine for ever?"</p>

<p>"For ever!" The words came out as if they acknowledged a
sentence of doom, rather than gave forth a pledge of love.</p>

<p>"In this world and the next," she cried, and flung her arms
round his neck.</p>

<p>Suddenly she started violently. Her arms fell, and she cowered
back as though she had seen something which terrified her.</p>

<p>Lendon turned. There had been no announcement, no sound of
opening door, no step on the stairs, and yet there, not six paces
from him, stood Maddox Challis&mdash;Maddox Challis, the mystic
philosopher, whom the papers reported to be thousands of miles
distant, away in the fastnesses of Lebanon, yet here in a light
semi-Eastern dress, grey-bearded, keen-eyed, withered, and sallow,
and with the same half cynical, half benevolent smile as when he
had taken leave of the Countess Adrian at Sir Donald Urquhart's
supper-party.</p>

<p>"Forgive my intrusion," he said, in his slow incisive way,
looking from one to the other, and showing no sign of surprise at
the effect his appearance produced. "I had orders, Mr. Lendon, from
those in authority, to present myself in your studio this
morning."</p>

<p>"From those in authority?" repeated Lendon in bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Strange things seem to have happened in the last few days,"
Challis went on, taking no heed of the interruption. "It is the
death of Countess Adrian which has brought me here from
Palestine."</p>

<p>"You say you have come from Palestine!" cried Lendon.
"Impossible. It is scarcely a week since Countess Adrian died; and,
even if the news had been sent you by telegraph, you could not have
arrived so soon."</p>

<p>The mystic smiled his peculiar smile. "My Masters have other
means of transmitting intelligence than by the electric wires," he
said. "And as for my rapid travelling&mdash;well, Mr. Lendon, time
and space are very slight hindrances to those whom the Masters
choose to do their business. If the conditions of my visit appear
strange to you now, I will give you an explanation later."</p>

<p>"You are welcome, Mr. Challis, under any conditions," said
Lendon, recovering himself. "First, I want you to know this
lady&mdash;my future wife&mdash;Miss Beatrice Brett."</p>

<p>Challis made a slight dignified inclination of his head, and his
deep luminous eyes fixed themselves on Beatrice with an expression
of sternness&mdash;it seemed to Lendon, of wrath. The effect his
gaze produced on Beatrice was extraordinary. For an instant she
glared at him like a wild animal entrapped. Then her eyes drooped
as if she were cowed. All the grace and charm of womanhood vanished
from her features. There was something approaching, bestiality in
their look. Lendon, who had gone close to her, started back. As
Challis addressed her he gave a cry of horror and amazement, but
words forsook him.</p>

<p>"Woman, possessed with a devil," said the mystic, "my business
is with you." He drew up his bent frame and stood before her erect
and stately, with set majestic face and arm upraised, the
forefinger pointed at her, like some high priest, denouncing a
sinner against the supreme law. "I know you for what you are," he
went on in vibrating tones that thrilled Lendon with the sense of
being in presence of a power above things earthly. "You, who walked
the earth in the body of a passion-tossed woman, and as Countess
Adrian awoke the desire of sin and the lust of the
flesh&mdash;spirit of all evil and uncleanness, in the might of the
White Brotherhood, by the Sign which must be obeyed, by the Word
which is Holy, I command you to come forth."</p>

<p>He pronounced some syllables in a strange tongue of which Lendon
knew no interpretation, and with his first finger traced rapidly in
the air the sign of the mystic Pentagram. As his hand moved, the
Odic Force flowed from it, showing a faint bluish light. Fire
seemed to flame from the Initiate's eyes. His spare frame dilated.
Twice again, in low awe-inspiring accents, he uttered the sacred
formula.</p>

<p>The girl struggled under the spell. Curious inarticulate cries
came from her. Her features were contorted and her eyes became
glassy. Her body writhed as in a convulsion, and site beat the air
helplessly with her hands as she staggered forward, and then fell,
a piteous heap, white and still on the ground.</p>

<p>A dumb horror seized Lendon as he watched her. He too felt under
a spell. He had an impulse to rush to her and support her, but he
was not able to move or speak.</p>

<p>He was conscious of a sensation of intense cold. Again the
mystic spoke, but his voice sounded afar-off and unintelligible as
a sound in a dream. A wonderful supernal light filled the studio,
outshining the light of day and bringing with it a giddy sense of
exhilaration and of divine ecstasy. He fancied that he beheld for a
moment the outlines of a gracious god-like form. There ran through
his body a thrill ineffable, and then his Limbs grew numb as under
the influence of an atmosphere rarer and more potent than that
which the untempered human frame can endure. His brain reeled. The
celestial radiance, the glorious visitant, the helpless, huddled
form of Beatrice, even the face of the Seer himself&mdash;all grew
dim, and he knew no more.</p>

<p class="cpb">* * *</p>

<p>When he came to himself the studio was darkened, he was seated
in his own chair, and Maddox Challis, to all appearance in ordinary
flesh and blood, was bending over him, one hand on his forehead and
the other feeling his pulse. He drew back as Lendon opened his
eyes.</p>

<p>"You are right now," he said quietly. "The Master's magnetism
was more than you could stand; but you will feel the benefit of it
in time to come, and your studio will certainly be the clearer of
all unwholesome influences."</p>

<p>"The Master!" repeated Lendon dreamily. "What has happened?"</p>

<p>"You scarcely remember," said Challis. "It is well that the
impression of horror should fade. For your comfort I will tell you
that in a few hours' time you will have ceased to connect the woman
you love, and who is pure and sweet and worthy of your Love, with
the soul of that unhappy being who was Countess Adrian."</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried Lendon with a shudder. "The horror comes back now.
But my mind is confused. I can't realize what you have done. Mr.
Challis, there is a mystery, will you explain it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, there is a mystery," replied Challis, "but it is easily
read by those whose eyes are open to the Inner Light. Mr. Lendon,
if you were learned in the lore of the Cabala you would know that
there exist in Nature certain elementary spirits which are indeed
the astral corpses of those who have died in crime or in the flush
and heat of sensuous longing, and who, bodiless, tormented by
desire, and incapable of gratifying it, haunt cities, like vampires
suck the vitality of human beings, and even sometimes enter the
bodies of living persons, and thus live on in enjoyment of their
material pleasures.</p>

<p>"To those who know, many a man and woman going about in the
world is but a soulless organism whose higher self has been
expelled by some sudden shock or demoniac machination, and whose
body has become the home of one of these wandering earth-bound
spirits. Strange it is that the more spiritual the nature, the more
loosely are the particles bound together, and the more readily is
the soul separated from the body. Do not misunderstand me. Such
expulsions, though retarding the progress of the soul, do it no
ultimate injury. For the body is but a garment; the spirit is
eternal and must live again. This is the occult explanation of
incurable propensity to crime, mania, epilepsy, and other diseases
with which medicine is powerless to grapple. For even in this
nineteenth-century London, devils may enter into a man and torment
him as in the days in Galilee when Jesu cast forth that dumb spirit
which threw the young man clown and tare him grievously. It was for
this reason that the ancients, who understood the secret laws of
nature, guarded their Sybils and their Pythonesses so that no
impure magnetism might touch them, and that they might be less
accessible to the influences from the astral world. In these days
such beings are called mediums, and they are let loose in the foul
atmosphere of cities, and woe be to those who are not pure and
strong to escape destruction." Challis paused. "Do you understand
the mystery?" he asked. "The soul of Countess Adrian was one of
these vampire spirits. When it lost its home of flesh Countess
Adrian's will prepared for it another body. Countess Adrian's kiss
established the necessary physical contact at the moment of
dissolution. The emotional conditions, the peculiar organization of
Beatrice, the love of the two women for you&mdash;all contributed
to the magnetic rapport."</p>

<p>"And Beatrice," cried Lendon, "Oh, tell me&mdash;she is saved?"
He rose in his agitation, one thought only possessing him. "Where
is she?" he cried.</p>

<p>"See," said Challis. He led Lendon to a sofa beneath the window
where Beatrice lay, pure, sweet, and serene, as a child in a happy
sleep. She smiled in her dream as her lover bent over her. Her eyes
opened. It was the soul that be knew which gazed out of them.</p>

<p>He caught her in his arms. In that kiss, long, deep, wholly
rapturous, the memory of Countess Adrian and of the nightmare
Avatar vanished for ever. When he released her, they were alone.
Maddox Challis had vanished too.</p>
