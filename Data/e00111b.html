<p>Production Notes:</p>
<p>The pre-existing Project Gutenberg Australia text has been
taken and compared with the scanned volumes (Chater's
translation, in two volumes.) Hence here, one volume of text has
become two volumes of html, with all the additions which that entails,
essentially two separate tables of contents.</p>
<p>All "--"s have been converted to "&mdash;"s. Italics have been
added to all appropriate words, and all illustrations, maps and
so forth and their captions have been added. Unlisted
illustrations have been added to the Contents to allow linking.
The index has been added to Volume 2. The few footnotes have each
been moved to the end of the relevant paragraph.</p>
<p>None of the font of the body of the Appendices has been
reduced in size here.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X<br>
<br>
<small>THE START FOR THE POLE</small></h3>
<p><small>AT</small> last we got away, on October 19. The weather
for the past few days had not been altogether reliable; now
windy, now calm&mdash;now snowing, now clear: regular spring
weather, in other words. That day it continued unsettled; it was
misty and thick in the morning, and did not promise well for the
day, but by 9.30 there was a light breeze from the east, and at
the same time it cleared.</p>
<p>There was no need for a prolonged inquiry into the sentiments
of the party.&mdash;What do you think? Shall we
start?"&mdash;Yes, of course. Let's be jogging on." There was
only one opinion about it. Our coursers were harnessed in a
jiffy, and with a little nod&mdash;as much as to say, "See you
to-morrow"&mdash;we were off. I don't believe Lindstr&ouml;m even
came out of doors to see us start. "Such an everyday affair:
what's the use of making a fuss about it?"</p>
<p>There were five of us&mdash;Hanssen, Wisting, Hassel,
Bjaaland, and myself. We had four sledges, with thirteen dogs to
each. At the start our sledges were very light, as we were only
taking supplies for the trip to 80&deg; S., where all our cases
were waiting for us; we could therefore sit on the sledges and
flourish our whips with a jaunty air. I sat astride on Wisting's
sledge, and anyone who had seen us would no doubt have thought a
Polar journey looked very inviting.</p>
<p>Down on the sea-ice stood Prestrud with the cinematograph,
turning the crank as fast as he could go as we went past. When we
came up on to the Barrier on the other side, he was there again,
turning incessantly. The last thing I saw, as we went over the
top of the ridge and everything familiar disappeared, was a
cinematograph; it was coming inland at full speed. I had been
engaged in looking out ahead, and turned round suddenly to throw
a last glance in the direction of the spot that to us stood for
all that was beautiful on earth, when I caught sight
of&mdash;what do you think? A cinematograph. "He can't be taking
anything but air now, can he?"&mdash;"Hardly that." The
cinematograph vanished below the horizon.</p>
<p>The going was excellent, but the atmosphere became thicker as
we went inland. For the first twelve miles from the edge of the
Barrier I had been sitting with Hassel, but, seeing that
Wisting's dogs could manage two on the sledge better than the
others, I moved. Hanssen drove first; he had to steer by compass
alone, as the weather had got thicker. After him came Bjaaland,
then Hassel, and, finally, Wisting and I. We had just gone up a
little slope, when we saw that it dropped rather steeply on the
other side; the descent could not be more than 20 yards long. I
sat with my back to the dogs, looking aft, and was enjoying the
brisk drive. Then suddenly the surface by the side of the sledge
dropped perpendicularly, and showed a yawning black abyss, large
enough to have swallowed us all, and a little more. A few inches
more to one side, and we should have taken no part in the Polar
journey. We guessed from this broken surface that we had come too
far to the east, and altered our course more westerly. When we
had reached safer ground, I took the opportunity of putting on my
ski and driving so; in this way the weight was more distributed.
Before very long it cleared a little, and we saw one of our
mark-flags straight ahead. We went up to it; many memories clung
to the spot&mdash;cold and slaughter of dogs. It was there we had
killed the three puppies on the last trip.</p>
<p>We had then covered seventeen miles, and we camped, well
pleased with the first day of our long journey. My belief that,
with all in one tent, we should manage our camping and
preparations much better than before was fully justified. The
tent went up as though it arose out of the ground, and everything
was done as though we had had long practice. We found we had
ample room in the tent, and our arrangements worked splendidly
the whole time. They were as follows: as soon as we halted, all
took a hand at the tent. The pegs in the valance of the tent were
driven in, and Wisting crept inside and planted the pole, while
the rest of us stretched the guy-ropes. When this was done, I
went in, and all the things that were to go inside were handed in
to me&mdash;sleeping-bags, kit-bags, cookers, provisions.
Everything was put in its place, the Primus lighted, and the
cooker filled with snow. Meanwhile the others fed their dogs and
let them loose. Instead of the "guard," we shovelled loose snow
round the tent; this proved to be sufficient protection&mdash;the
dogs respected it. The bindings were taken off all our ski, and
either stowed with other loose articles in a provision-case, or
hung up together with the harness on the top of the ski, which
were lashed upright to the front of the sledge. The tent proved
excellent in every way; the dark colour subdued the light, and
made it agreeable.</p>
<p>Neptune, a fine dog, was let loose when we had come six miles
over the plain; he was so fat that he could not keep up. We felt
certain that he would follow us, but he did not appear. We then
supposed that he had turned back and made for the flesh-pots,
but, strangely enough, he did not do that either. He never
arrived at the station; it is quite a mystery what became of him.
Rotta, another fine animal, was also set free; she was not fit
for the journey, and she afterwards arrived at home. Ulrik began
by having a ride on the sledge; he picked up later. Bj&ouml;rn
went limping after the sledge. Peary was incapacitated; he was
let loose and followed for a time, but then disappeared. When the
eastern party afterwards visited the depot in 80&deg; S., they
found him there in good condition. He was shy at first, but by
degrees let them come near him and put the harness on. He did
very good service after that. Uranus and Fuchs were out of
condition. This was pretty bad for the first day, but the others
were all worth their weight in gold.</p>

<br>
<small>A SNOW BEACON ON THE BARRIER SURFACE.</small></p>
<br>
<p>During the night it blew a gale from the east, but it
moderated in the morning, so that we got away at 10 a.m. The
weather did not hold for long; the wind came again with renewed
force from the same quarter, with thick driving snow. However, we
went along well, and passed flag after flag. After going nineteen
and a quarter miles, we came to a snow beacon that had been
erected at the beginning of April, and had stood for seven
months; it was still quite good and solid. This gave us a good
deal to think about: so we could depend upon these beacons; they
would not fall down. From the experience thus gained, we
afterwards erected the whole of our extensive system of beacons
on the way south. The wind went to the south-east during the day;
it blew, but luckily it had stopped snowing. The temperature was
-11.5&deg; F., and bitter enough against the wind. When we
stopped in the evening and set our tent, we had just found our
tracks from the last trip; they were sharp and clear, though six
weeks old. We were glad to find them, as we had seen no flag for
some time, and were beginning to get near the ugly trap,
forty-six and a half miles from the house, that had been found on
the last depot journey, so we had to be careful.</p>
<p>The next day, the 21st, brought very thick weather: a strong
breeze from the south-east, with thick driving snow. It would not
have been a day for crossing the trap if we had not found our old
tracks. It was true that we could not see them far, but we could
still see the direction they took. So as to be quite safe, I now
set our course north-east by east&mdash;two points east was the
original course. And compared with our old tracks, this looked
right, as the new course was considerably more easterly than the
direction of the tracks. One last glance over the camping-ground
to see whether anything was forgotten, and then into the
blizzard. It was really vile weather, snowing from above and
drifting from below, so that one was quite blinded. We could not
see far; very often we on the last sledge had difficulty in
seeing the first. Bjaaland was next in front of us. For a long
time we had been going markedly downhill, and this was not in
accordance with our reckoning; but in that weather one could not
make much of a reckoning. We had several times passed over
crevasses, but none of any size. Suddenly we saw Bjaaland's
sledge sink over. He jumped off and seized the trace. The sledge
lay on its side for a few seconds, then began to sink more and
more, and finally disappeared altogether. Bjaaland had got a good
purchase in the snow, and the dogs lay down and dug their claws
in. The sledge sank more and more&mdash;all this happened in a
few moments. "Now I can't hold it any longer." We&mdash;Wisting
and I&mdash;had just come up. He was holding on convulsively, and
resisting with all his force, but it was no use&mdash;inch by
inch the sledge sank deeper. The dogs, too, seemed to understand
the gravity of the situation; stretched out in the snow, they dug
their claws in, and resisted with all their strength. But still,
inch by inch, slowly and surely, it went down into the abyss.
Bjaaland was right enough when he said he couldn't hold on any
longer. A few seconds more, and his sledge and thirteen dogs
would never have seen the light of day again. Help came at the
last moment. Hanssen and Hassel, who were a little in advance
when it happened, had snatched an Alpine rope from a sledge and
came to his assistance. They made the rope fast to the trace, and
two of us&mdash;Bjaaland and I&mdash;were now able, by getting a
good purchase, to hold the sledge suspended. First the dogs were
taken out; then Hassel's sledge was drawn back and placed across
the narrowest part of the crevasse, where we could see that the
edges were solid. Then by our combined efforts the sledge, which
was dangling far below, was hoisted up as far as we could get it,
and made fast to Hassel's sledge by the dogs' traces. Now we
could slack off and let go: one sledge hung securely enough by
the other. We could breathe a little more freely.</p>
<p>The next thing to be done was to get the sledge right, up, and
before we could manage that it had to be unloaded. A man would
have to go down on the rope, cast off the lashings of the cases,
and attach them again for drawing up. They all wanted this job,
but Wisting had it; he fastened the Alpine rope round his body
and went down. Bjaaland and I took up our former positions, and
acted as anchors; meanwhile Wisting reported what he saw down
below. The case with the cooker was hanging by its last thread;
it was secured, and again saw the light of day. Hassel and
Hanssen attended to the hauling up of the cases, as Wisting had
them ready. These two fellows moved about on the brink of the
chasm with a coolness that I regarded at first with approving
eyes. I admire courage and contempt for danger. But the length to
which they carried it at last was too much of a good thing; they
were simply playing hide-and-seek with Fate. Wisting's
information from below&mdash;that the cornice they were standing
on was only a few inches thick&mdash;did not seem to have the
slightest effect on them; on the contrary, they seemed to stand
all the more securely.</p>
<p>"We've been lucky," said Wisting; "this is the only place
where the crevasse is narrow enough to put a sledge across. If we
had gone a little more to the left"&mdash;Hanssen looked eagerly
in that direction&mdash;"none of us would have escaped. There is
no surface there; only a crust as thin as paper. It doesn't look
very inviting down below, either; immense spikes of ice sticking
up everywhere, which would spit you before you got very far
down."</p>
<p>This description was not attractive; it was well we had found
"such a good place." Meanwhile Wisting had finished his work, and
was hauled up. When asked whether he was not glad to be on the
surface again, he answered with a smile that "it was nice and
warm down there." We then hauled the sledge up, and for the time
being all was well. "But," said Hassel, "we must be careful going
along here, because I was just on the point of going in when
Hanssen and I were bringing up the sledge." He smiled as though
at a happy memory. Hassel had seen that it was best to be
careful. There was no need to look for crevasses; there was
literally nothing else to be seen.</p>
<p>There could be no question of going farther into the trap, for
we had long ago come to the conclusion that, in spite of our
precautions, we had arrived at this ugly place. We should have to
look about for a place for the tent, but that was easier said
than done. There was no possibility of finding a place large
enough for both the tent and the guy-ropes; the tent was set up
on a small, apparently solid spot, and the guys stretched across
crevasses in all directions. We were beginning to be quite
familiar with the place. That crevasse ran there and there, and
it had a side-fissure that went so and so&mdash;just like
schoolboys learning a lesson.</p>
<p>Meanwhile we had brought all our things as far as possible
into a place of safety; the dogs lay harnessed to reduce the risk
of losing them. Wisting was just going over to his
sledge&mdash;he had gone the same way several times
before&mdash;when suddenly I saw nothing but his head, shoulders
and arms above the snow. He had fallen through, but saved himself
by stretching his arms out as he fell. The crevasse was
bottomless, like the rest. We went into the tent and cooked
lobscouse. Leaving the weather to take care of itself, we made
ourselves as comfortable as we could. It was then one o'clock in
the afternoon. The wind had fallen considerably since we came in,
and before we knew what was happening, it was perfectly calm. It
began to brighten a little about three, and we went out to look
at it.</p>
<p>The weather was evidently improving, and on the northern
horizon there was a sign of blue sky. On the south it was thick.
Far off, in the densest part of the mist, we could vaguely see
the outline of a dome-like elevation, and Wisting and Hanssen
went off to examine it. The dome turned out to be one of the
small haycock formations that we had seen before in this
district. They struck at it with their poles, and just as they
expected&mdash;it was hollow, and revealed the darkest abyss.
Hanssen was positively chuckling with delight when he told us
about it; Hassel sent him an envious glance.</p>

<br>
<small>CREVASSED SURFACE ON THE BARRIER.</small></p>
<br>
<p>By 4 p.m. it cleared, and a small reconnoitring party,
composed of three, started to find a way out of this. I was one
of the three, so we had a long Alpine rope between us; I don't
like tumbling in, if I can avoid it by such simple means. We set
out to the east&mdash;the direction that had brought us out of
the same broken ground before&mdash;and we had not gone more than
a few paces when we were quite out of it. It was now clear enough
to look about us. Our tent stood at the north-eastern corner of a
tract that was full of hummocks; we could decide beyond a doubt
that this was the dreaded trap. We continued a little way to the
east until we saw our course clearly, and then returned to camp.
We did not waste much time in getting things ready and leaving
the place. It was a genuine relief to find ourselves once more on
good ground, and we resumed our journey southward at a brisk
pace.</p>
<p>That we were not quite out of the dangerous zone was shown by
a number of small hummocks to the south of us. They extended
across our course at right angles. We could also see from some
long but narrow crevasses we crossed that we must keep a good
look-out. When we came into the vicinity of the line of hummocks
that lay in our course, we stopped and discussed our prospects.
"We shall save a lot of time by going straight on through here
instead of going round," said Hanssen. I had to admit this; but,
on the other hand, the risk was much greater. "Oh, let's try it,"
he went on; "if we can't do it, we can't." I was weak, and
allowed myself to be persuaded, and away we went among the
haycocks. I could see how Hanssen was enjoying himself; this was
just what he wanted. We went faster and faster. Curiously enough,
we passed several of these formations without noticing anything,
and began to hope that we should get through. Then suddenly
Hanssen's three leading dogs disappeared, and the others stopped
abruptly. He got them hauled up without much trouble and came
over. We others, who were following, crossed without accident,
but our further progress seemed doubtful, for after a few more
paces the same three dogs fell in again. We were now in exactly
the same kind of place as before; crevasses ran in every
direction, like a broken pane of glass. I had had enough, and
would take no more part in this death-ride. I announced
decisively that we must turn back, follow our tracks, and go
round it all. Hanssen looked quite disappointed. "Well," he said,
"but we shall be over it directly." "I dare say we shall," I
replied; "but we must go back first." This was evidently hard on
him; there was one formation in particular that attracted him,
and he wanted to try his strength with it. It was a pressure-mass
that, as far as appearance went, might just as well have been
formed out in the drift-ice. It looked as if it was formed of
four huge lumps of ice raised on end against each other. We knew
what it contained without examination&mdash;a yawning chasm.
Hanssen cast a last regretful glance upon it, and then turned
back.</p>
<p>We could now see all our surroundings clearly. This place lay,
as we had remarked before, in a hollow; we followed it round, and
came up the rise on the south without accident. Here we caught
sight of one of our flags; it stood to the east of us, and thus
confirmed our suspicion that we had been going too far to the
west. We had one more contact with the broken ground, having to
cross some crevasses and pass a big hole; but then it was done,
and we could once more rejoice in having solid ice beneath us.
Hanssen, however, was not satisfied till he had been to look into
the hole. In the evening we reached the two snow-huts we had
built on the last trip, and we camped there, twenty-six miles
from the depot. The huts were drifted up with snow, so we left
them in peace, and as the weather was now so mild and fine, we
preferred the tent.</p>
<p>It had been an eventful day, and we had reason to be satisfied
that we had come off so easily. The going had been good, and it
had all gone like a game. When we started the next morning it was
overcast and thick, and before we had gone very far we were in
the midst of a south-wester, with snow so thick that we could
hardly see ten sledge-lengths ahead of us. We had intended to
reach the depot that day, but if this continued, it was more than
doubtful whether we should find it. Meanwhile we put on the pace.
It was a long way on, so there was no danger of driving past it.
During this while it had remained clear in the zenith, and we had
been hoping that the wind and snow would cease; but we had no
such luck&mdash;it increased rather than dropped. Our best
sledge-meter&mdash;one we knew we could depend on&mdash;was on
Wisting's sledge; therefore he had to check the distance. At 1.30
p.m. he turned round to me, and pointed out that we had gone the
exact distance; I called out to Hanssen to use his eyes well.
Then, at that very moment, the depot showed up a few
sledge-lengths to the left of us, looking like a regular palace
of snow in the thick air. This was a good test both for the
sledge-meter and the compass. We drove up to it and halted. There
were three important points to be picked up on our way south, and
one of them was found; we were all glad and in good spirits.</p>
<p>The ninety-nine miles from Framheim to this point had been
covered in four marches, and we could now rest our dogs, and give
them as much seal's flesh as they were capable of eating. Thus
far the trip had been a good one for the animals; with one
exception, they were all in the best condition. This exception
was Uranus. We had never been able to get any fat on his bones;
he remained thin and scraggy, and awaited his death at the depot,
a little later, in 82&deg; S. If Uranus was lanky to look at, the
same could not be said of Jaala, poor beast! In spite of her
condition, she struggled to keep up; she did her utmost, but
unless her dimensions were reduced before we left 82&deg; S., she
would have to accompany Uranus to another world.</p>
<p>The cases of provisions and outfit that we had left here on
the last trip were almost entirely snowed under, but it did not
take long to dig them out. The first thing to be done was to cut
up the seals for the dogs. These grand pieces of meat, with the
blubber attached, did not have to be thrown at the dogs; they
just helped themselves as long as there was any meat cut up, and
when that was finished, they did not hesitate to attack the
"joint." It was a pleasure to see them, as they lay all over the
place, enjoying their food; it was all so delightfully calm and
peaceful, to begin with. They were all hungry, and thought of
nothing but satisfying their immediate cravings; but when this
was done there was an end of the truce. Although Hai had only
half finished his share, he must needs go up to Rap and take away
the piece he was eating. Of course, this could not happen without
a great row, which resulted in the appearance of Hanssen; then
Hai made himself scarce. He was a fine dog, but fearfully
obstinate; if he had once taken a thing into his head, it was not
easy to make him give it up. On one of our depot journeys it
happened that I was feeding Hanssen's dogs. Hai had made short
work of his pemmican, and looked round for more. Ah! there was
Rap enjoying his&mdash;that would just do for him. In a flash Hai
was upon him, forced him to give up his dinner, and was about to
convert it to his own use. Meanwhile I had witnessed the whole
scene, and before Hai knew anything about it, I was upon him in
turn. I hit him over the nose with the whip-handle, and tried to
take the pemmican from him, but it was not so easy. Neither of us
would give in, and soon we were both rolling over and over in the
snow struggling for the mastery. I came off victorious after a
pretty hot fight, and Rap got his dinner again. Any other dog
would have dropped it at once on being hit over the nose, but not
Hai.</p>
<p>It was a treat to get into the tent; the day had been a bitter
one. During the night the wind went round to the north, and all
the snow that had been blown northward by the wind of the
previous day had nothing to do but to come back again; the road
was free. And it made the utmost use of its opportunity; nothing
could be seen for driving snow when we turned out next morning.
We could only stay where we were, and console ourselves with the
thought that it made no difference, as it had been decided that
we were to remain here two days. But staying in a tent all day is
never very amusing, especially when one is compelled to keep to
one's sleeping-bag the whole time. You soon get tired of talking,
and you can't write all day long, either. Eating is a good way of
passing the time, if you can afford it, and so is reading, if you
have anything to read; but as the menu is limited, and the
library as a rule somewhat deficient on a sledging trip, these
two expedients fall to the ground. There is, however, one form of
entertainment that may be indulged in under these circumstances
without scruple, and that is a good nap. Happy the man who can
sleep the clock round on days like these; but that is a gift that
is not vouchsafed to all, and those who have it will not own up
to it. I have heard men snore till I was really afraid they would
choke, but as for acknowledging that they had been
asleep&mdash;never! Some of them even have the coolness to assert
that they suffer from sleeplessness, but it was not so bad as
that with any of us.</p>
<p>In the course of the day the wind dropped, and we went out to
do some work. We transferred the old depot to the new one. We now
had here three complete sledge-loads, for which there would be
little use, and which, therefore, were left behind. The eastern
party availed themselves of part of these supplies on their
journey, but not much. This depot is a fairly large one, and
might come in useful if anyone should think of exploring the
region from King Edward Land southward. As things were, we had no
need of it. At the same time the sledges were packed, and when
evening came everything was ready for our departure. There had
really been no hurry about this, as we were going to stay here on
the following day as well; but one soon learns in these regions
that it is best to take advantage of good weather when you have
it&mdash;you never know how long it will last. There was,
however, nothing to be said about the day that followed; we could
doze and doze as much as we liked. The work went on regularly,
nevertheless. The dogs gnawed and gnawed, storing up strength
with every hour that went by.</p>
<p>We will now take a trip out to our loaded sledges, and see
what they contain. Hanssen's stands first, bow to the south;
behind it come Wisting's, Bjaaland's and Hassel's. They all look
pretty much alike, and as regards provisions their loads are
precisely similar.</p>
<p>Case No. 1 contains about 5,300 biscuits, and weighs 111
pounds.</p>
<p>Case No. 2: 112 rations of dogs' pemmican; 11 bags of dried
milk, chocolate, and biscuits. Total gross weight, 177
pounds.</p>
<p>Case No. 3: 124 rations of dogs' pemmican; 10 bags of dried
milk and biscuits. Gross weight, 161 pounds.</p>
<p>Case No. 4: 39 rations of dogs' pemmican; 86 rations of men's
pemmican; 9 bags of dried milk and biscuits. Gross weight, 165
pounds.</p>
<p>Case No. 5: 96 rations of dogs' pemmican. Weight, 122
pounds.</p>
<p>Total net weight of provisions per sledge, 668 pounds.</p>
<p>With the outfit and the weight of the sledge itself, the total
came to pretty nearly 880 pounds.</p>
<p>Hanssen's sledge differed from the others, in that it had
aluminium fittings instead of steel and no sledge-meter, as it
had to be free from iron on account of the steering-compass he
carried. Each of the other three sledges had a sledge-meter and
compass. We were thus equipped with three sledge-meters and four
compasses. The instruments we carried were two sextants and three
artificial horizons&mdash;two glass and one mercury&mdash;a
hypsometer for measuring heights, and one aneroid. For
meteorological observations, four thermometers. Also two pairs of
binoculars. We took a little travelling case of medicines from
Burroughs Wellcome and Co. Our surgical instruments were not
many: a dental forceps and&mdash;a beard-clipper. Our sewing
outfit was extensive. We carried a small, very light tent in
reserve; it would have to be used if any of us were obliged to
turn back. We also carried two Primus lamps. Of paraffin we had a
good supply: twenty-two and a half gallons divided among three
sledges. We kept it in the usual cans, but they proved too weak;
not that we lost any paraffin, but Bjaaland had to be constantly
soldering to keep them tight. We had a good soldering outfit.
Every man carried his own personal bag, in which he kept reserve
clothing, diaries and observation books. We took a quantity of
loose straps for spare ski-bindings. We had double sleeping-bags
for the first part of the time; that is to say, an inner and an
outer one. There were five watches among us, of which three were
chronometer watches.</p>
<p>We had decided to cover the distance between 80&deg; and
82&deg; S. in daily marches of seventeen miles. We could easily
have done twice this, but as it was more important to arrive than
to show great speed, we limited the distance; besides which, here
between the depots we had sufficient food to allow us to take our
time. We were interested in seeing how the dogs would manage the
loaded sledges. We expected them to do well, but not so well as
they did.</p>
<p>On October 25 we left 80&deg; S. with a light north-westerly
breeze, clear and mild. I was now to take up my position in
advance of the sledges, and placed myself a few paces in front of
Hanssen's, with my ski pointing in the right direction. A last
look behind me: "All ready?" and away I went. I thought&mdash;no;
I didn't have time to think. Before I knew anything about it, I
was sent flying by the dogs. In the confusion that ensued they
stopped, luckily, so that I escaped without damage, as far as
that went. To tell the truth, I was angry, but as I had sense
enough to see that the situation, already sufficiently comic,
would be doubly ridiculous if I allowed my annoyance to show
itself, I wisely kept quiet. And, after all, whose fault was it?
I was really the only one to blame; why in the world had I not
got away faster? I now changed my plan entirely&mdash;there is
nothing to be ashamed of in that, I hope&mdash;and fell in with
the awkward squad; there I was more successful. "All ready? Go!"
And go they did. First Hanssen went off like a meteor; close
behind him came Wisting, and then Bjaaland and Hassel. They all
had ski on, and were driving with a line. I had made up my mind
to follow in the rear, as I thought the dogs would not keep this
up for long, but I soon had enough of it. We did the first six
and a quarter miles in an hour. I thought that would do for me,
so I went up to Wisting, made a rope fast to his sledge, and
there I stood till we reached 85&deg; 5' S.&mdash;three hundred
and forty miles. Yes; that was a pleasant surprise. We had never
dreamed of anything of the sort&mdash;driving on ski to the Pole!
Thanks to Hanssen's brilliant talents as a dog-driver, we could
easily do this. He had his dogs well in hand, and they knew their
master. They knew that the moment they failed to do their duty
they would be pulled up, and a hiding all round would follow. Of
course, as always happens, Nature occasionally got the better of
discipline; but the "confirmation" that resulted checked any
repetition of such conduct for a long while. The day's march was
soon completed in this way, and we camped early.</p>
<p>On the following day we were already in sight of the large
pressure-ridges on the east, which we had seen for the first time
on the second depot journey between 81&deg; and 82&deg; S., and
this showed that the atmosphere must be very clear. We could not
see any greater number than the first time, however. From our
experience of beacons built of snow, we could see that if we
built such beacons now, on our way south, they would be splendid
marks for our return journey; we therefore decided to adopt this
system of landmarks to the greatest possible extent. We built in
all 150 beacons, 6 feet high, and used in their construction
9,000 blocks, cut out of the snow with specially large
snow-knives. In each of them was deposited a paper, giving the
number and position of the beacon, and indicating the distance
and the direction to be taken to reach the next beacon to the
north. It may appear that my prudence was exaggerated, but it
always seemed to me that one could not be too careful on this
endless, uniform surface. If we lost our way here, it would be
difficult enough to reach home. Besides which, the building of
these beacons had other advantages, which we could all see and
appreciate. Every time we stopped to build one, the dogs had a
rest, and they wanted this, if they were to keep up the pace.</p>
<p>We erected the first beacon in 80&deg; 23' S. To begin with,
we contented ourselves with putting them up at every thirteenth
or fifteenth kilometre. On the 29th we shot the first dog,
Hanssen's Bone. He was too old to keep up, and was only a
hindrance. He was placed in depot under a beacon, and was a great
joy to us&mdash;or rather to the dogs&mdash;later on.</p>
<p>On the same day we reached the second important
point&mdash;the depot in 81&deg; S. Our course took us very
slightly to the east of it. The small pieces of packing-case that
had been used as marks on each side of the depot could be seen a
long way off. On a subsequent examination they showed no sign of
snowfall; they stood just as they had been put in. In the
neighbourhood of the depot we crossed two quite respectable
crevasses; they were apparently filled up, and caused us no
trouble. We reached the depot at 2 p.m.; everything was in the
best of order. The flag was flying, and hardly looked as if it
had been up a day, although it had now been waving there for
nearly eight months. The drifts round the depot were about
1&frac12; feet high.</p>
<p>The next day was brilliant&mdash;calm and clear. The sun
really baked the skin of one's face. We put all our skin clothing
out to dry; a little rime will always form at the bottom of a
sleeping-bag. We also availed ourselves of this good opportunity
to determine our position and check our compasses; they proved to
be correct. We replaced the provisions we had consumed on the
way, and resumed our journey on October 31.</p>
<p>There was a thick fog next morning, and very disagreeable
weather; perhaps we felt it more after the previous fine day.
When we passed this way for the first time going south, Hanssen's
dogs had fallen into a crevasse, but it was nothing to speak of;
otherwise we had no trouble. Nor did we expect any this time; but
in these regions what one least expects frequently happens. The
snow was loose and the going heavy; from time to time we crossed
a narrow crevasse. Once we saw through the fog a large open hole;
we could not have been very far from it, or we should not have
seen it, the weather was so thick. But all went well till we had
come thirteen and a half miles. Then Hanssen had to cross a
crevasse a yard wide, and in doing it he was unlucky enough to
catch the point of his ski in the traces of the hindmost dogs,
and fall right across the crevasse. This looked unpleasant. The
dogs were across, and a foot or two on the other side, but the
sledge was right over the crevasse, and had twisted as Hanssen
fell, so that a little more would bring it into line with the
crevasse, and then, of course, down it would go. The dogs had
quickly scented the fact that their lord and master was for the
moment incapable of administering a "confirmation," and they did
not let slip the golden opportunity. Like a lot of roaring
tigers, the whole team set upon each other and fought till the
hair flew. This naturally produced short, sharp jerks at the
traces, so that the sledge worked round more and more, and at the
same time the dogs, in the heat of the combat, were coming nearer
and nearer to the brink. If this went on, all was irretrievably
lost. One of us jumped the crevasse, went into the middle of the
struggling team, and, fortunately, got them to stop. At the same
time, Wisting threw a line to Hanssen and hauled him out of his
unpleasant position&mdash;although, I thought to myself, as we
went on: I wonder whether Hanssen did not enjoy the situation?
Stretched across a giddy abyss, with the prospect of slipping
down it at any moment&mdash;that was just what he would like. We
secured the sledge, completed our seventeen miles, and
camped.</p>
<p>From 81&deg; S. we began to erect beacons at every nine
kilometres. The next day we observed the lowest temperature of
the whole of this journey: -31.1&deg; F The wind was
south-south-east, but not very strong. It did not feel like
summer, all the same. We now adopted the habit which we kept up
all the way to the south&mdash;of taking our lunch while building
the beacon that lay half-way in our day's march. It was nothing
very luxurious&mdash;three or four dry oatmeal biscuits, that was
all. If one wanted a drink, one could mix snow with the
biscuit&mdash;"bread and water." It is a diet that is not much
sought after in our native latitudes, but latitude makes a very
great difference in this world. It anybody had offered us more
"bread and water," we should gladly have accepted it.</p>
<p>That day we crossed the last crevasse for a long time to come,
and it was only a few inches wide. The surface looked grand ahead
of us; it went in very long, almost imperceptible undulations. We
could only notice them by the way in which the beacons we put up
often disappeared rather rapidly.</p>
<p>On November 2 we had a gale from the south, with heavy snow.
The going was very stiff, but the dogs got the sledges along
better than we expected. The temperature rose, as usual, with a
wind from this quarter: +14&deg; F. It was a pleasure to be out
in such a temperature, although it did blow a little. The day
after we had a light breeze from the north. The heavy going of
the day before had completely disappeared; instead of it we had
the best surface one could desire, and it made our dogs break
into a brisk gallop. That was the day we were to reach the depot
in 82&deg; S., but as it was extremely thick, our chances of
doing so were small. In the course of the afternoon the distance
was accomplished, but no depot was visible. However, our range of
vision was nothing to boast of&mdash;ten sledge-lengths; not
more. The most sensible thing to do, under the circumstances, was
to camp and wait till it cleared.</p>
<p>At four o'clock next morning the sun broke through. We let it
get warm and disperse the fog, and then went out. What a morning
it was&mdash;radiantly clear and mild. So still, so still lay the
mighty desert before us, level and white on every side. But, no;
there in the distance the level was broken: there was a touch of
colour on the white. The third important point was reached, the
extreme outpost of civilization. Our last depot lay before us;
that was an unspeakable relief. The victory now seemed half won.
In the fog we had come about three and a half miles too far to
the west; but we now saw that if we had continued our march the
day before, we should have come right into our line of flags.
There they stood, flag after flag, and the little strip of black
cloth seemed to wave quite proudly, as though it claimed credit
for the way in which it had discharged its duty. Here, as at the
depot in 81&deg; S., there was hardly a sign of snowfall. The
drift round the depot had reached the same height as
there&mdash;1&frac12; feet. Clearly the same conditions of
weather had prevailed all over this region. The depot stood as we
had made it, and the sledge as we had left it. Falling snow and
drift had not been sufficient to cover even this. The little
drift that there was offered an excellent place for the tent,
being hard and firm. We at once set about the work that had to be
done. First, Uranus was sent into the next world, and although he
had always given us the impression of being thin and bony, it was
now seen that there were masses of fat along his back; he would
be much appreciated when we reached here on the return. Jaala did
not look as if she would fulfil the conditions, but we gave her
another night. The dogs' pemmican in the depot was just enough to
give the dogs a good feed and load up the sledges again. We were
so well supplied with all other provisions that we were able to
leave a considerable quantity behind for the return journey.</p>
<p>Next day we stayed here to give the dogs a thorough rest for
the last time. We took advantage of the fine weather to dry our
outfit and check our instruments. When evening came we were all
ready, and now we could look back with satisfaction to the good
work of the autumn; we had fully accomplished what we aimed
at&mdash;namely, transferring our base from 78&deg; 38' to
82&deg; S. Jaala had to follow Uranus; they were both laid on the
top of the depot, beside eight little ones that never saw the
light of day. During our stay here we decided to build beacons at
every fifth kilometre, and to lay down depots at every degree of
latitude. Although the dogs were drawing the sledges easily at
present, we knew well enough that in the long-run they would find
it hard work if they were always to have heavy weights to pull.
The more we could get rid of, and the sooner we could begin to do
so, the better.</p>
<p>On November 6, at 8 a.m., we left 82&deg; S. Now the unknown
lay before us; now our work began in earnest. The appearance of
the Barrier was the same everywhere&mdash;flat, with a splendid
surface. At the first beacon we put up we had to shoot Lucy. We
were sorry to put an end to this beautiful creature, but there
was nothing else to be done. Her friends&mdash;Karenius, Sauen,
and Schwartz&mdash;scowled up at the beacon where she lay as they
passed, but duty called, and the whip sang dangerously near them,
though they did not seem to hear it. We had now extended our
daily march to twenty-three miles; in this way we should do a
degree in three days.</p>

<br>
<p>On the 7th we decided to stop for a day's rest. The dogs had
been picking up wonderfully every day, and were now at the top of
their condition, as far as health and training went. With the
greatest ease they covered the day's march at a pace of seven and
a half kilometres (four miles and two-thirds) an hour. As for
ourselves, we never had to move a foot; all we had to do was to
let ourselves be towed. The same evening we had to put an end to
the last of our ladies&mdash;Else. She was Hassel's pride and the
ornament of his team; but there was no help for it. She was also
placed at the top of a beacon.</p>
<p>When we halted that evening in 82&deg; 20' S., we saw on the
south-western horizon several heavy masses of drab-coloured
cloud, such as are usually to be seen over land. We could make
out no land that evening, however; but when we came out next
morning and directed our glasses to that quarter, the land lay
there, lofty and clear in the morning sun. We were now able to
distinguish several summits, and to determine that this was the
land extending south-eastward from Beardmore Glacier in South
Victoria Land. Our course had been true south all the time; at
this spot we were about 250 miles to the east of Beardmore
Glacier. Our course would continue to be true south.</p>
<p>The same evening&mdash;November 8&mdash;we reached 83&deg; S.
by dead reckoning. The noon altitude next day gave 83&deg; 1' S.
The depot we built here contained provisions for five men and
twelve dogs for four days; it was made square&mdash;6 feet each
way&mdash;of hard, solid blocks of snow. A large flag was placed
on the top. That evening a strange thing happened&mdash;three
dogs deserted, going northward on our old tracks. They were
Lucy's favourites, and had probably taken it into their heads
that they ought to go back and look after their friend. It was a
great loss to us all, but especially to Bjaaland; they were all
three first-rate animals, and among the best we had. He had to
borrow a dog from Hanssen's team, and if he did not go quite so
smoothly as before, he was still able to keep up.</p>
<p>On the 10th we got a bearing of the mountain chain right down
in south by west true. Each day we drew considerably nearer the
land, and could see more and more of its details: mighty peaks,
each loftier and wilder than the last, rose to heights of 15,000
feet. What struck us all were the bare sides that many of these
mountains showed; we had expected to see them far more covered
with snow. Mount Fridtjof Nansen, for example, had quite a
blue-black look. Only quite at the summit was it crowned by a
mighty hood of ice that raised its shining top to some 15,000
feet. Farther to the south rose Mount Don Pedro Christophersen;
it was more covered with snow, but the long, gabled summit was to
a great extent bare. Still farther south Mounts Alice Wedel
Jarlsberg, Alice Gade, and Ruth Gade, came in sight; all
snow-clad from peak to base. I do not think I have ever seen a
more beautiful or wilder landscape. Even from where we were, we
seemed to be able to see a way up from several places. There lay
Liv's Glacier,* for instance, which would undoubtedly afford a
good and even ascent, but it lay too far to the north. It is of
enormous extent, and would prove interesting to explore. Crown
Prince Olav's Mountains looked less promising, but they also lay
too far to the north. A little to the west of south lay an
apparently good way up. The mountains nearest to the Barrier did
not seem to offer any great obstruction. What one might find
later, between Mounts Pedro Christophersen and Fridtjof Nansen,
was not easy to say.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Named after Dr. Nansen's
daughter.&mdash;T<small>R</small>.]</p>
<p>On the 12th we reached 84&deg; S. On that day we made the
interesting discovery of a chain of mountains running to the
east; this, as it appeared from the spot where we were, formed a
semicircle, where it joined the mountains of South Victoria Land.
This semicircle lay true south, and our course was directed
straight towards it.</p>
<p>In the depot in 84&deg; S. we left, besides the usual quantity
of provisions for five men and twelve dogs for four days, a can
of paraffin, holding 17 litres (about 34 gallons). We had
abundance of matches, and could therefore distribute them over
all the depots. The Barrier continued as flat as before, and the
going was as good as it could possibly be. We had thought that a
day's rest would be needed by the dogs for every degree of
latitude, but this proved superfluous; it looked as if they could
no longer be tired. One or two had shown signs of bad feet, but
were now perfectly well; instead of losing strength, the dogs
seemed to become stronger and more active every day. Now they,
too, had sighted the land, and the black mass of Mount Fridtjof
Nansen seemed specially to appeal to them; Hanssen often had hard
work to keep them in the right course. Without any longer stay,
then, we left 84&deg; S. the next day, and steered for the bay
ahead.</p>
<p>That day we went twenty-three miles in thick fog, and saw
nothing of the land. It was hard to have to travel thus blindly
off an unknown coast, but we could only hope for better weather.
During the previous night we had heard, for a change, a noise in
the ice. It was nothing very great, and sounded like scattered
infantry fire&mdash;a few rifle-shots here and there underneath
our tent; the artillery had not come up yet. We took no notice of
it, though I heard one man say in the morning: "Blest if I didn't
think I got a whack on the ear last night." I could witness that
it had not cost him his sleep, as that night he had very nearly
snored us all out of the tent. During the forenoon we crossed a
number of apparently newly-formed crevasses; most of them only
about an inch wide. There had thus been a small local disturbance
occasioned by one of the numerous small glaciers on land. On the
following night all was quiet again, and we never afterwards
heard the slightest sound.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Image66" id="Image66"></a><img alt=""

<br>
<small>AT THE DEPOT IN LAT. 84&deg; S.</small></p>
<br>
<p>On November 14 we reached 84&deg; 40' S. We were now rapidly
approaching land; the mountain range on the east appeared to turn
north-eastward. Our line of ascent, which we had chosen long ago
and now had our eyes fixed upon as we went, would take us a
trifle to the west of south, but so little that the digression
was of no account. The semicircle we saw to the south made a more
disquieting impression, and looked as if it would offer great
irregularities. On the following day the character of the surface
began to change; great wave-like formations seemed to roll higher
and higher as they approached the land, and in one of the troughs
of these we found the surface greatly disturbed. At some bygone
time immense fissures and chasms would have rendered its passage
practically impossible, but now they were all drifted up, and we
had no difficulty in crossing.</p>
<p>That day&mdash;November 15&mdash;we reached 85&deg; S., and
camped at the top of one of these swelling waves. The valley we
were to cross next day was fairly broad, and rose considerably on
the other side. On the west, in the direction of the nearest
land, the undulation rose to such a height that it concealed a
great part of the land from us. During the afternoon we built the
usual depot, and continued our journey on the following day. As
we had seen from our camping-ground, it was an immense undulation
that we had to traverse; the ascent on the other side felt
uncomfortably warm in the powerful sun, but it was no higher than
300 feet by the aneroid. From the top of this wave the Barrier
stretched away before us, flat at first, but we could see
disturbances of the surface in the distance. Now we are going to
have some fun in getting to land, I thought, for it seemed very
natural that the Barrier, hemmed in as it was here, would be much
broken up. The disturbances we had seen consisted of some big,
old crevasses, which were partly filled up; we avoided them
easily. Now there was another deep depression before us; with a
correspondingly high rise on the other side. We went over it
capitally; the surface was absolutely smooth, without a sign of
fissure or hole anywhere. Then we shall get them when we are on
the top, I thought. It was rather stiff work uphill, unaccustomed
as we were to slopes. I stretched my neck more and more to get a
view. At last we were up; and what a sight it was that met us!
Not an irregularity, not a sign of disturbance; quietly and
evenly the ascent continued. I believe that we were then already
above land; the large crevasses that we had avoided down below
probably formed the boundary. The hypsometer gave 930 feet above
the sea.</p>
<p>We were now immediately below the ascent, and made the final
decision of trying it here. This being settled, we pitched our
camp. It was still early in the day, but we had a great deal to
arrange before the morrow. Here we should have to overhaul our
whole supply of provisions, take with us what was absolutely
necessary for the remainder of the trip, and leave the rest
behind in depot. First, then, we camped, worked out our position,
fed the dogs and let them loose again, and then went into our
tent to have something to eat and go through the provision
books.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Image67" id="Image67"></a><img alt=""
src="e00111b-images/Image67.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>THE DEPOT AND MOUNTAINS IN LAT. 85&deg; S.</small></p>
<br>
<p>We had now reached one of the most critical points of our
journey. Our plan had now to be laid so that we might not only
make the ascent as easily as possible, but also get through to
the end. Our calculations had to be made carefully, and every
possibility taken into account. As with every decision of
importance, we discussed the matter jointly. The distance we had
before us, from this spot to the Pole and back, was 683 miles.
Reckoning with the ascent that we saw before us, with other
unforeseen obstructions, and finally with the certain factor that
the strength of our dogs would be gradually reduced to a fraction
of what it now was, we decided to take provisions and equipment
for sixty days on the sledges, and to leave the remaining
supplies&mdash;enough for thirty days&mdash;and outfit in depot.
We calculated, from the experience we had had, that we ought to
be able to reach this point again with twelve dogs left. We now
had forty-two dogs. Our plan was to take all the forty-two up to
the plateau; there twenty-four of them were to be slaughtered,
and the journey continued with three sledges and eighteen dogs.
Of these last eighteen, it would be necessary, in our opinion, to
slaughter six in order to bring the other twelve back to this
point. As the number of dogs grew less, the sledges would become
lighter and lighter, and when the time came for reducing their
number to twelve, we should only have two sledges left. This time
again our calculations came out approximately right; it was only
in reckoning the number of days that we made a little
mistake&mdash;we took eight days less than the time allowed. The
number of dogs agreed exactly; we reached this point again with
twelve.</p>
<p>After the question had been well discussed and each had given
his opinion, we went out to get the repacking done. It was lucky
the weather was so fine, otherwise this taking stock of
provisions might have been a bitter piece of work. All our
supplies were in such a form that we could count them instead of
weighing them. Our pemmican was in rations of &frac12; kilogram
(1 pound 1&frac12; ounces). The chocolate was divided into small
pieces, as chocolate always is, so that we knew what each piece
weighed. Our milk-powder was put up in bags of 10&frac12; ounces
just enough for a meal. Our biscuits possessed the same
property&mdash;they could be counted, but this was a tedious
business, as they were rather small. On this occasion we had to
count 6,000 biscuits. Our provisions consisted only of these four
kinds, and the combination turned out right enough. We did not
suffer from a craving either for fat or sugar, though the want of
these substances is very commonly felt on such journeys as ours.
In our biscuits we had an excellent product, consisting of
oatmeal, sugar, and dried milk. Sweetmeats, jam, fruit, cheese,
etc., we had left behind at Framheim.</p>
<p>We took our reindeer-skin clothing, for which we had had no
use as yet, on the sledges. We were now coming on to the high
ground, and it might easily happen that it would be a good thing
to have. We did not forget the temperature of -40&deg; F. that
Shackleton had experienced in 88&deg; S., and if we met with the
same, we could hold out a long while if we had the skin clothing.
Otherwise, we had not very much in our bags. The only change we
had with us was put on here, and the old clothes hung out to air.
We reckoned that by the time we came back, in a couple of months,
they would be sufficiently aired, and we could put them on again.
As far as I remember, the calculation proved correct. We took
more foot-gear than anything else: if one's feet are well shod,
one can hold out a long time.</p>
<p>When all this was finished, three of us put on our ski and
made for the nearest visible land. This was a little peak, a mile
and three-quarters away&mdash;Mount Betty. It did not look lofty
or imposing, but was, nevertheless, 1,000 feet above the sea.
Small as it was, it became important to us, as it was there we
got all our geological specimens. Running on ski felt quite
strange, although I had now covered 385 miles on them; but we had
driven the whole way, and were somewhat out of training. We could
feel this, too, as we went up the slope that afternoon. After
Mount Betty the ascent became rather steep, but the surface was
even, and the going splendid, so we got on fast. First we came up
a smooth mountain-side, about 1,200 feet above the sea, then over
a little plateau; after that another smooth slope like the first,
and then down a rather long, flat stretch, which after a time
began to rise very gradually, until it finally passed into small
glacier formations. Our reconnaissance extended to these small
glaciers. We had ascertained that the way was practicable, as far
as we were able to see; we had gone about five and a half miles
from the tent, and ascended 2,000 feet. On the way back we went
gloriously; the last two slopes down to the Barrier gave us all
the speed we wanted. Bjaaland and I had decided to take a turn
round by Mount Betty for the sake of having real bare ground
under our feet; we had not felt it since Madeira in September,
1910, and now we were in November, 1911. No sooner said than
done. Bjaaland prepared for an elegant "Telemark swing", and
executed it in fine style. What I prepared to do, I am still not
quite sure. What I did was to roll over, and I did it with great
effect. I was very soon on my feet again, and glanced at
Bjaaland; whether he had seen my tumble, I am not certain.
However, I pulled myself together after this unfortunate
performance, and remarked casually that it is not so easy to
forget what one has once learnt. No doubt he thought that I had
managed the "Telemark swing"; at any rate, he was polite enough
to let me think so.</p>
<br>

<br>
<small>ASCENDING MOUNT BETTY.</small></p>
<br>
<p>Mount Betty offered no perpendicular crags or deep precipices
to stimulate our desire for climbing; we only had to take off our
ski, and then we arrived at the top. It consisted of loose
screes, and was not an ideal promenade for people who had to be
careful of their boots. It was a pleasure to set one's foot on
bare ground again, and we sat down on the rocks to enjoy the
scene. The rocks very soon made themselves felt, however, and
brought us to our feet again. We photographed each other in
"picturesque attitudes," took a few stones for those who had not
yet set foot on bare earth, and strapped on our ski. The dogs,
after having been so eager to make for bare land when they first
saw it, were now not the least interested in it; they lay on the
snow, and did not go near the top. Between the bare ground and
the snow surface there was bright, blue-green ice, showing that
at times there was running water here. The dogs did what they
could to keep up with us on the way down, but they were soon left
behind. On our return, we surprised our comrades with presents
from the country, but I fear they were not greatly appreciated. I
could hear such words as, "Norway-stones&mdash;heaps of them,"
and I was able to put them together and understand what was
meant. The "presents" were put in depot, as not absolutely
indispensable on the southern journey.</p>
<p>By this time the dogs had already begun to be very voracious.
Everything that came in their way disappeared; whips,
ski-bindings, lashings, etc., were regarded as delicacies. If one
put down anything for a moment, it vanished. With some of them
this voracity went so far that we had to chain them.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI<br>
<br>
<small>THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS</small></h3>
<p><small>ON</small> the following day&mdash;November 17&mdash;we
began the ascent. To provide for any contingency, I left in the
depot a paper with information of the way we intended to take
through the mountains, together with our plan for the future, our
outfit, provisions, etc. The weather was fine, as usual, and the
going good. The dogs exceeded our expectations; they negotiated
the two fairly steep slopes at a jog-trot. We began to think
there was no difficulty they could not surmount; the five miles
or so that we had gone the day before, and imagined would be more
than enough for this day's journey, were now covered with full
loads in shorter time. The small glaciers higher up turned out
fairly steep, and in some places we had to take two sledges at a
time with double teams. These glaciers had an appearance of being
very old, and of having entirely ceased to move. There were no
new crevasses to be seen; those that there were, were large and
wide, but their edges were rounded off everywhere, and the
crevasses themselves were almost entirely filled with snow. So as
not to fall into these on the return, we erected our beacons in
such a way that the line between any two of them would take us
clear of any danger. It was no use working in Polar clothing
among these hills; the sun, which stood high and clear, was
uncomfortably warm, and we were obliged to take off most of our
things. We passed several summits from 3,000 to 7,000 feet high;
the snow on one of them had quite a reddish-brown tint.</p>
<p>Our distance this first day was eleven and a half miles, with
a rise of 2,000 feet. Our camp that evening lay on a little
glacier among huge crevasses; on three sides of us were towering
summits. When we had set our tent, two parties went out to
explore the way in advance. One party&mdash;Wisting and
Hanssen&mdash;took the way that looked easiest from the
tent&mdash;namely, the course of the glacier; it here rose
rapidly to 4,000 feet, and disappeared in a south-westerly
direction between two peaks. Bjaaland formed the other party. He
evidently looked upon this ascent as too tame, and started up the
steepest part of the mountain-side. I saw him disappear up aloft
like a fly. Hassel and I attended to the necessary work round
about and in the tent.</p>
<p>We were sitting inside chatting, when we suddenly heard
someone come swishing down towards the tent. We looked at each
other; that fellow had some pace on. We had no doubt as to who it
was&mdash;Bjaaland, of course. He must have gone off to refresh
old memories. He had a lot to tell us; amongst other things, he
had found "the finest descent" on the other side. What he meant
by "fine" I was not certain. If it was as fine as the ascent he
had made, then I asked to be excused. We now heard the others
coming, and these we could hear a long way off. They had also
seen a great deal, not to mention "the finest descent." But both
parties agreed in the mournful intelligence that we should have
to go down again. They had both observed the immense glacier that
stretched beneath us running east and west. A lengthy discussion
took place between the two parties, who mutually scorned each
other's "discoveries." "Yes; but look here, Bjaaland, we could
see that from where you were standing there's a sheer
drop&mdash;"&mdash;"You couldn't see me at all. I tell you I was
to the west of the peak that lies to the south of the peak that"
I gave up trying to follow the discussion any longer. The way in
which the different parties had disappeared and come in sight
again gave me every reason to decide in favour of the route the
last arrivals had taken. I thanked these keen gentlemen for their
strenuous ramble in the interests of the expedition, and went
straight off to sleep. I dreamed of mountains and precipices all
night, and woke up with Bjaaland whizzing down from the sky. I
announced once more that I had made up my mind for the other
course, and went to sleep again.</p>
<p>We debated next morning whether it would not be better to take
the sledges two by two to begin with; the glacier before us
looked quite steep enough to require double teams. It had a rise
of 2,000 feet in quite a short distance. But we would try first
with the single teams. The dogs had shown that their capabilities
were far above our expectation; perhaps they would be able to do
even this. We crept off: The ascent began at once&mdash;good
exercise after a quart of chocolate. We did not get on fast, but
we won our way. It often looked as if the sledge would stop, but
a shout from the driver and a sharp crack of the whip kept the
dogs on the move. It was a fine beginning to the day, and we gave
them a well-deserved rest when we got up. We then drove in
through the narrow pass and out on the other side. It was a
magnificent panorama that opened before us. From the pass we had
come out on to a very small flat terrace, which a few yards
farther on began to drop steeply to a long valley. Round about us
lay summit after summit on every side. We had now come behind the
scenes, and could get our bearings better. We now saw the
southern side of the immense Mount Nansen; Don Pedro
Christophersen we could see in his full length. Between these two
mountains we could follow the course of a glacier that rose in
terraces along their sides. It looked fearfully broken and
disturbed, but we could follow a little connected line among the
many crevasses; we saw that we could go a long way, but we also
saw that the glacier forbade us to use it in its full extent.
Between the first and second terraces the ice was evidently
impassable. But we could see that there was an unbroken ledge up
on the side of the mountain; Don Pedro would help us out. On the
north along the Nansen Mountain there was nothing but chaos,
perfectly impossible to get through. We put up a big beacon where
we were standing, and took bearings from it all round the
compass.</p>
<p>I went back to the pass to look out over the Barrier for the
last time. The new mountain chain lay there sharp and clear; we
could see how it turned from the east up to east-north-east, and
finally disappeared in the north-east&mdash;as we judged, about
84&deg; S. From the look of the sky, it appeared that the chain
was continued farther. According to the aneroid, the height of
the terrace on which we stood was 4,000 feet above the sea. From
here there was only one way down, and we began to go. In making
these descents with loaded sledges, one has to use the greatest
care, lest the speed increase to such a degree that one loses
command over the sledge. If this happens, there is a danger, not
only of running over the dogs, but of colliding with the sledge
in front and smashing it. This was all the more important in our
case, as the sledges carried sledge-meters. We therefore put
brakes of rope under our runners when we were to go downhill.
This was done very simply by taking a few turns with a thin piece
of rope round each runner; the more of these turns one took, the
more powerful, of course, was the brake. The art consisted in
choosing the right number of turns, or the right brake; this was
not always attained, and the consequence was that, before we had
come to the end of these descents, there were several collisions.
One of the drivers, in particular, seemed to have a supreme
contempt for a proper brake; he would rush down like a flash of
lightning, and carry the man in front with him. With practice we
avoided this, but several times things had an ugly look.</p>
<p>The first drop took us down 800 feet; then we had to cross a
wide, stiff piece of valley before the ascent began again. The
snow between the mountains was loose and deep, and gave the dogs
hard work. The next ascent was up very steep glaciers, the last
of which was the steepest bit of climbing we had on the whole
journey&mdash;stiff work even for double teams. Going in front of
the dogs up these slopes was, I could see, a business that
Bjaaland would accomplish far more satisfactorily than I, and I
gave up the place to him. The first glacier was steep, but the
second was like the side of a house. It was a pleasure to watch
Bjaaland use his ski up there; one could see that he had been up
a hill before. Nor was it less interesting to see the dogs and
the drivers go up. Hanssen drove one sledge alone; Wisting and
Hassel the other. They went by jerks, foot by foot, and ended by
reaching the top. The second relay went somewhat more easily in
the tracks made by the first.</p>
<p>Our height here was 4,550 feet, the last ascent having brought
us up 1,250 feet; we had arrived on a plateau, and after the dogs
had rested we continued our march. Now, as we advanced, we had a
better view of the way we were going; before this the nearest
mountains had shut us in. The mighty glacier opened out before
us, stretching, as we could now see, right up from the Barrier
between the lofty mountains running east and west. It was by this
glacier that we should have to gain the plateau; we could see
that. We had one more descent to make before reaching it, and
from above we could distinguish the edges of some big gaps in
this descent, and found it prudent to examine it first. As we
thought, there was a side-glacier coming down into it, with
large, ugly crevasses in many places; but it was not so bad as to
prevent our finally reaching, with caution and using good brakes,
the great main ice-field&mdash;Axel Heiberg Glacier. The plan we
had proposed to ourselves was to work our way up to the place
where the glacier rose in abrupt masses between the two
mountains. The task we had undertaken was greater than we
thought. In the first place, the distance was three times as
great as any of us had believed; and, in the second place, the
snow was so loose and deep that it was hard work for the dogs
after all their previous efforts. We set our course along the
white line that we had been able to follow among the numerous
crevasses right up to the first terrace. Here tributary glaciers
came down on all sides from the mountains and joined the main
one; it was one of these many small arms that we reached that
evening, directly under Don Pedro Christophersen.</p>
<p>The mountain below which we had our camp was covered with a
chaos of immense blocks of ice. The glacier on which we were was
much broken up, but, as with all the others, the fissures were of
old date, and, to a large extent, drifted up. The snow was so
loose that we had to trample a place for the tent, and we could
push the tent-pole right down without meeting resistance;
probably it would be better higher up. In the evening Hanssen and
Bjaaland went out to reconnoitre, and found the conditions as we
had seen them from a distance. The way up to the first terrace
was easily accessible; what the conditions would be like between
this and the second terrace we had still to discover.</p>
<p>It was stiff work next day getting up to the first terrace.
The arm of the glacier that led up was not very long, but
extremely steep and full of big crevasses; it had to be taken in
relays, two sledges at a time. The state of the going was,
fortunately, better than on the previous day, and the surface of
the glacier was fine and hard, so that the dogs got a splendid
hold. Bjaaland went in advance up through this steep glacier, and
had his work cut out to keep ahead of the eager animals. One
would never have thought we were between 85&deg; and 86&deg; S.;
the heat was positively disagreeable, and, although lightly clad,
we sweated as if we were running races in the tropics. We were
ascending rapidly, but, in spite of the sudden change of
pressure, we did not yet experience any difficulty of breathing,
headache, or other unpleasant results. That these sensations
would make their appearance in due course was, however, a matter
of which we could be certain. Shackleton's description of his
march on the plateau, when headache of the most violent and
unpleasant kind was the order of the day, was fresh in the memory
of all of us.</p>
<p>In a comparatively short time we reached the ledge in the
glacier that we had noticed a long way off; it was not quite
flat, but sloped slightly towards the edge. When we came to the
place to which Hanssen and Bjaaland had carried their
reconnaissance on the previous evening, we had a very fine
prospect of the further course of the glacier. To continue along
it was an impossibility; it consisted here&mdash;between the two
vast mountains&mdash;of nothing but crevasse after crevasse, so
huge and ugly that we were forced to conclude that our further
advance that way was barred. Over by Fridtjof Nansen we could not
go; this mountain here rose perpendicularly, in parts quite bare,
and formed with the glacier a surface so wild and cut up that all
thoughts of crossing the ice-field in that direction had to be
instantly abandoned. Our only chance lay in the direction of Don
Pedro Christophersen; here, so far as we could see, the
connection of the glacier and the land offered possibilities of
further progress. Without interruption the glacier was merged in
the snow-clad mountain-side, which rose rapidly towards the
partially bare summit. Our view, however, did not extend very
far. The first part of the mountain-side was soon bounded by a
lofty ridge running east and west, in which we could see huge
gaps here and there. From the place where we were standing, we
had the impression that we should be able to continue our course
up there under the ridge between these gaps, and thus come out
beyond the disturbed tract of glacier. We might possibly succeed
in this, but we could not be certain until we were up on the
ridge itself.</p>
<p>We took a little rest&mdash;it was not a long one&mdash;and
then started. We were impatient to see whether we could get
forward up above. There could be no question of reaching the
height without double teams; first we had to get Hanssen's and
Wisting's sledges up, and then the two others. We were not
particularly keen on thus covering the ground twice, but the
conditions made it imperative. We should have been pleased just
then if we had known that this was to be the last ascent that
would require double teams; but we did not know this, and it was
more than any of us dared to hope. The same hard work, and the
same trouble to keep the dogs at an even pace, and then we were
up under the ridge amongst the open chasms. To go farther without
a careful examination of the ground was not to be thought of.
Doubtless, our day's march had not been a particularly long one,
but the piece we had covered had indeed been fatiguing enough. We
therefore camped, and set our tent at an altitude of 5,650 feet
above the sea.</p>

<br>
<small>MOUNT FRIDTJOF NANSEN, 15,000 FEET ABOVE THE
SEA.</small></p>
<br>
<p>We at once proceeded to reconnoitre, and the first thing to be
examined was the way we had seen from below. This led in the
right direction&mdash;that is, in the direction of the glacier,
east and west&mdash;and was thus the shortest. But it is not
always the shortest way that is the best; here, in any case, it
was to be hoped that another and longer one would offer better
conditions. The shortest way was awful&mdash;possibly not
altogether impracticable, if no better was to be found. First we
had to work our way across a hard, smooth slope, which formed an
angle of 45 degrees, and ended in a huge, bottomless chasm. It
was no great pleasure to cross over here on ski, but with
heavily-laden sledges the enjoyment would be still less. The
prospect of seeing sledge, driver, and dogs slide down sideways
and disappear into the abyss was a great one. We got across with
whole skins on ski, and continued our exploration. The
mountain-side along which we were advancing gradually narrowed
between vast fissures above and vaster fissures below, and
finally passed by a very narrow bridge&mdash;hardly broader than
the sledges&mdash;into the glacier. On each side of the bridge,
one looked down into a deep blue chasm. To cross here did not
look very inviting; no doubt we could take the dogs out and haul
the sledges over, and thus manage it&mdash;presuming the bridge
held&mdash;but our further progress, which would have to be made
on the glacier, would apparently offer many surprises of an
unpleasant kind. It was quite possible that, with time and
patience, one would be able to tack through the apparently
endless succession of deep crevasses; but we should first have to
see whether something better than this could not be found in
another direction. We therefore returned to camp.</p>
<p>Here in the meantime everything had been put in order, the
tent set up, and the dogs fed. Now came the great question: What
was there on the other side of the ridge? Was it the same
desperate confusion, or would the ground offer better facilities?
Three of us went off to see. Excitement rose as we neared the
saddle; so much depended on finding a reasonable way. One more
pull and we were up; it was worth the trouble. The first glance
showed us that this was the way we had to go. The mountain-side
ran smooth and even under the lofty summit-like a gabled church
tower&mdash;of Mount Don Pedro Christophersen, and followed the
direction of the glacier. We could see the place where this long,
even surface united with the glacier; to all appearance it was
free from disturbance. We saw some crevasses, of course, but they
were far apart, and did not give us the idea that they would be a
hindrance. But we were still too far from the spot to be able to
draw any certain conclusions as to the character of the ground;
we therefore set off towards the bottom to examine the conditions
more closely. The surface was loose up here, and the snow fairly
deep; our ski slipped over it well, but it would be heavy for
dogs. We advanced rapidly, and soon came to the huge crevasses.
They were big enough and deep enough, but so scattered that,
without much trouble, we could find a way between them. The
hollow between the two mountains, which was filled by the Heiberg
Glacier, grew narrower and narrower towards the end, and,
although appearances were still very pleasant, I expected to find
some disturbance when we arrived at the point where the
mountain-side passed into the glacier. But my fears proved
groundless; by keeping right under Don Pedro we went clear of all
trouble, and in a short time, to our great joy, we found
ourselves above and beyond that chaotic part of the Heiberg
Glacier which had completely barred our progress.</p>
<p>Up here all was strangely peaceful; the mountain-side and the
glacier united in a great flat terrace&mdash;a plain, one might
call it&mdash;without disturbance of any kind. We could see
depressions in the surface where the huge crevasses had formerly
existed, but now they were entirely filled up, and formed one
with the surrounding level. We could now see right to the end of
this mighty glacier, and form some idea of its proportions. Mount
Wilhelm Christophersen and Mount Ole Engelstad formed the end of
it; these two beehive-shaped summits, entirely covered with snow,
towered high into the sky. We understood now that the last of the
ascent was before us, and that what we saw in the distance
between these two mountains was the great plateau itself. The
question, then, was to find a way up, and to conquer this last
obstruction in the easiest manner. In the radiantly clear air we
could see the smallest details with our excellent prismatic
glasses, and make our calculations with great confidence. It
would be possible to clamber up Don Pedro himself; we had done
things as difficult before. But here the side of the mountain was
fairly steep, and full of big crevasses and a fearful quantity of
gigantic blocks of ice. Between Don Pedro and Wilhelm
Christophersen an arm of the glacier went up on to the plateau,
but it was so disturbed and broken up that it could not be used.
Between Wilhelm Christophersen and Ole Engelstad there was no
means of getting through. Between Ole Engelstad and Fridtjof
Nansen, on the other hand, it looked more promising, but as yet
the first of these mountains obstructed our view so much that we
could not decide with certainty. We were all three rather tired,
but agreed to continue our excursion, and find out what was here
concealed. Our work to-day would make our progress to-morrow so
much the easier. We therefore went on, and laid our course
straight over the topmost flat terrace of the Heiberg Glacier. As
we advanced, the ground between Nansen and Engelstad opened out
more and more, and without going any farther we were able to
decide from the formations that here we should undoubtedly find
the best way up. If the final ascent at the end of the glacier,
which was only partly visible, should present difficulties, we
could make out from where we stood that it would be possible,
without any great trouble, to work our way over the upper end of
the Nansen Mountain itself, which here passed into the plateau by
a not too difficult glacier. Yes, now we were certain that it was
indeed the great plateau and nothing else that we saw before us.
In the pass between the two mountains, and some little distance
within the plateau, Helland Hansen showed up, a very curious peak
to look at. It seemed to stick its nose up through the plateau,
and no more; its shape was long, and it reminded one of nothing
so much as the ridge of a roof. Although this peak was thus only
just visible, it stood 11,000 feet above the sea.</p>
<p>After we had examined the conditions here, and found out that
on the following day&mdash;if the weather permitted&mdash;we
should reach the plateau, we turned back, well satisfied with the
result of our trip. We all agreed that we were tired, and longing
to reach camp and get some food. The place where we turned was,
according to the aneroid, 8,000 feet above the sea; we were
therefore 2,500 feet higher than our tent down on the hill-side.
Going down in our old tracks was easier work, though the return
journey was somewhat monotonous. In many places the slope was
rapid, and not a few fine runs were made. On approaching our
camping-ground we had the sharpest descent, and here, reluctant
as we might be, we found it wiser to put both our poles together
and form a strong brake. We came down smartly enough, all the
same. It was a grand and imposing sight we had when we came out
on the ridge under which&mdash;far below&mdash;our tent stood.
Surrounded on all sides by huge crevasses and gaping chasms, it
could not be said that the site of our camp looked very inviting.
The wildness of the landscape seen from this point is not to be
described; chasm after chasm, crevasse after crevasse, with great
blocks of ice scattered promiscuously about, gave one the
impression that here Nature was too powerful for us. Here no
progress was to be thought of.</p>
<p>It was not without a certain satisfaction that we stood there
and contemplated the scene. The little dark speck down
there&mdash;our tent&mdash;in the midst of this chaos, gave us a
feeling of strength and power. We knew in our hearts that the
ground would have to be ugly indeed if we were not to manoeuvre
our way across it and find a place for that little home of ours.
Crash upon crash, roar upon roar, met our ears. Now it was a shot
from Mount Nansen, now from one of the others; we could see the
clouds of snow rise high into the air. It was evident that these
mountains were throwing off their winter mantles and putting on a
more spring-like garb.</p>
<p>We came at a tearing pace down to the tent, where our
companions had everything in most perfect order. The dogs lay
snoring in the heat of the sun, and hardly condescended to move
when we came scudding in among them. Inside the tent a regular
tropical heat prevailed; the sun was shining directly on to the
red cloth and warming it. The Primus hummed and hissed, and the
pemmican-pot bubbled and spurted. We desired nothing better in
the world than to get in, fling ourselves down, eat, and drink.
The news we brought was no trifling matter&mdash;the plateau
to-morrow. It sounded almost too good to be true; we had reckoned
that it would take us ten days to get up, and now we should do it
in four. In this way we saved a great deal of dog food, as we
should be able to slaughter the superfluous animals six days
earlier than we had calculated. It was quite a little feast that
evening in the tent; not that we had any more to eat than
usual&mdash;we could not allow ourselves that&mdash;but the
thought of the fresh dog cutlets that awaited us when we got to
the top made our mouths water. In course of time we had so
habituated ourselves to the idea of the approaching slaughter
that this event did not appear to us so horrible as it would
otherwise have done. Judgment had already been pronounced, and
the selection made of those who were worthy of prolonged life and
those who were to be sacrificed. This had been, I may add, a
difficult problem to solve, so efficient were they all.</p>
<p>The rumblings continued all night, and one avalanche after
another exposed parts of the mountain-sides that had been
concealed from time immemorial. The following day, November 20,
we were up and away at the usual time, about 8 a.m. The weather
was splendid, calm and clear. Getting up over the saddle was a
rough beginning of the day for our dogs, and they gave a good
account of themselves, pulling the sledges up with single teams
this time. The going was heavy, as on the preceding day, and our
advance through the loose snow was not rapid. We did not follow
our tracks of the day before, but laid our course directly for
the place where we had decided to attempt the ascent. As we
approached Mount Ole Engelstad, under which we had to pass in
order to come into the arm of the glacier between it and Mount
Nansen, our excitement began to rise. What does the end look
like? Does the glacier go smoothly on into the plateau, or is it
broken up and impassable? We rounded Mount Engelstad more and
more; wider and wider grew the opening. The surface looked
extremely good as it gradually came into view, and it did not
seem as though our assumption of the previous day would be put to
shame. At last the whole landscape opened out, and without
obstruction of any kind whatever the last part of the ascent lay
before us. It was both long and steep from the look of it, and we
agreed to take a little rest before beginning the final
attack.</p>
<p>We stopped right under Mount Engelstad in a warm and sunny
place, and allowed ourselves on this occasion a little lunch, an
indulgence that had not hitherto been permitted. The cooking-case
was taken out, and soon the Primus was humming in a way that told
us it would not be long before the chocolate was ready. It was a
heavenly treat, that drink. We had all walked ourselves warm, and
our throats were as dry as tinder. The contents of the pot were
served round by the cook&mdash;Hanssen. It was no use asking him
to share alike; he could not be persuaded to take more than half
of what was due to him&mdash;the rest he had to divide among his
comrades. The drink he had prepared this time was what he called
chocolate, but I had some difficulty in believing him. He was
economical, was Hanssen, and permitted no extravagance; that
could be seen very well by his chocolate. Well, after all, to
people who were accustomed to regard "bread and water" as a
luxury, it tasted, as I have said, heavenly. It was the liquid
part of the lunch that was served extra; if anyone wanted
something to eat, he had to provide it himself&mdash;nothing was
offered him. Happy was he who had saved some biscuits from his
breakfast!</p>
<p>Our halt was not a very long one. It is a queer thing that,
when one only has on light underclothing and windproof overalls,
one cannot stand still for long without feeling cold. Although
the temperature was no lower than -4&deg; F., we were glad to be
on the move again. The last ascent was fairly hard work,
especially the first half of it. We never expected to do it with
single teams, but tried it all the same. For this last pull up I
must give the highest praise both to the dogs and their drivers;
it was a brilliant performance on both sides. I can still see the
situation clearly before me. The dogs seemed positively to
understand that this was the last big effort that was asked of
them; they lay flat down and hauled, dug their claws in and
dragged themselves forward. But they had to stop and get breath
pretty often, and then the driver's strength was put to the test.
It is no child's play to set a heavily-laden sledge in motion
time after time. How they toiled, men and beasts, up that slope!
But they got on, inch by inch, until the steepest part was behind
them. Before them lay the rest of the ascent in a gentle rise, up
which they could drive without a stop. It was stiff,
nevertheless, and it took a long time before we were all up on
the plateau on the southern side of Mount Engelstad.</p>
<p>We were very curious and anxious to see what the plateau
looked. like. We had expected a great, level plain, extending
boundlessly towards the south; but in this we were disappointed.
Towards the south-west it looked very level and fine, but that
was not the way we had to go. Towards the south the ground
continued to rise in long ridges running east and west, probably
a continuation of the mountain chain running to the south-east,
or a connection between it and the plateau. We stubbornly
continued our march; we would not give in until we had the plain
itself before us. Our hope was that the ridge projecting from
Mount Don Pedro Christophersen would be the last; we now had it
before us. The going changed at once up here; the loose snow
disappeared, and a few wind-waves (<i>sastrugi</i>) began to show
themselves. These were specially unpleasant to deal with on this
last ridge; they lay from south-east to north-west, and were as
hard as flints and as sharp as knives. A fall among them might
have had very serious consequences. One would have thought the
dogs had had enough work that day to tire them, but this last
ridge, with its unpleasant snow-waves, did not seem to trouble
them in the least. We all drove up gaily, towed by the sledges,
on to what looked to us like the final plateau, and halted at 8
p.m. The weather had held fine, and we could apparently see a
very long way. In the far distance, extending to the north-west,
rose peak after peak; this was the chain of mountains running to
the south-east, which we now saw from the other side. In our own
vicinity, on the other band, we saw nothing but the backs of the
mountains so frequently mentioned. We afterwards learned how
deceptive the light can be. I consulted the aneroid immediately
on our arrival at the camping-ground, and it showed 10,920 feet
above the sea, which the hypsometer afterwards confirmed. All the
sledge-meters gave seventeen geographical miles, or thirty-one
kilometres (nineteen and a quarter statute miles). This day's
work&mdash;nineteen and a quarter miles, with an ascent of 5,750
feet&mdash;gives us some idea of what can be performed by dogs in
good training. Our sledges still had what might be considered
heavy loads; it seems superfluous to give the animals any other
testimonial than the bare fact.</p>
<p>It was difficult to find a place for the tent, so hard was the
snow up here. We found one, however, and set the tent.
Sleeping-bags and kit-bags were handed in to me, as usual,
through the tent-door, and I arranged everything inside. The
cooking-case and the necessary provisions for that evening and
the next morning were also passed in; but the part of my work
that went more quickly than usual that night was getting the
Primus started, and pumping it up to high-pressure. I was hoping
thereby to produce enough noise to deaden the shots that I knew
would soon be heard&mdash;twenty-four of our brave companions and
faithful helpers were marked out for death. It was hard&mdash;but
it had to be so. We had agreed to shrink from nothing in order to
reach our goal. Each man was to kill his own dogs to the number
that had been fixed.</p>
<p>The pemmican was cooked remarkably quickly that evening, and I
believe I was unusually industrious in stirring it. There went
the first shot&mdash;I am not a nervous man, but I must admit
that I gave a start. Shot now followed upon shot&mdash;they had
an uncanny sound over the great plain. A trusty servant lost his
life each time. It was long before the first man reported that he
had finished; they were all to open their dogs, and take out the
entrails to prevent the meat being contaminated. The entrails
were for the most part devoured warm on the spot by the victims'
comrades, so voracious were they all. Suggen, one of Wisting's
dogs, was especially eager for warm entrails; after enjoying this
luxury, he could be seen staggering about in a quite misshapen
condition. Many of the dogs would not touch them at first, but
their appetite came after a while.</p>
<p>The holiday humour that ought to have prevailed in the tent
that evening&mdash;our first on the plateau&mdash;did not make
its appearance; there was depression and sadness in the
air&mdash;we had grown so fond of our dogs. The place was named
the "Butcher's Shop." It had been arranged that we should stop
here two days to rest and eat dog. There was more than one among
us who at first would not hear of taking any part in this feast;
but as time went by, and appetites became sharper, this view
underwent a change, until, during the last few days before
reaching the Butcher's Shop, we all thought and talked of nothing
but dog cutlets, dog steaks, and the like. But on this first
evening we put a restraint on ourselves; we thought we could not
fall upon our four-footed friends and devour them before they had
had time to grow cold.</p>
<p>We quickly found out that the Butcher's Shop was not a
hospitable locality. During the night the temperature sank, and
violent gusts of wind swept over the plain; they shook and tore
at the tent, but it would take more than that to get a hold of
it. The dogs spent the night in eating; we could hear the
crunching and grinding of their teeth whenever we were awake for
a moment. The effect of the great and sudden change of altitude
made itself felt at once; when I wanted to turn round in my bag,
I had to do it a bit at a time, so as not to get out of breath.
That my comrades were affected in the same way, I knew without
asking them; my ears told me enough.</p>
<p>It was calm when we turned out, but the weather did not look
altogether promising; it was overcast and threatening. We
occupied the forenoon in flaying a number of dogs. As I have
said, all the survivors were not yet in a mood for dog's flesh,
and it therefore had to be served in the most enticing form. When
flayed and cut up, it went down readily all along the line; even
the most fastidious then overcame their scruples. But with the
skin on we should not have been able to persuade them all to eat
that morning; probably this distaste was due to the smell
clinging to the skins, and I must admit that it was not
appetizing. The meat itself, as it lay there cut up, looked well
enough, in all conscience; no butcher's shop could have exhibited
a finer sight than we showed after flaying and cutting up ten
dogs. Great masses of beautiful fresh, red meat, with quantities
of the most tempting fat, lay spread over the snow. The dogs went
round and sniffed at it. Some helped themselves to a piece;
others were digesting. We men had picked out what we thought was
the youngest and tenderest one for ourselves. The whole
arrangement was left to Wisting, both the selection and the
preparation of the cutlets. His choice fell upon Rex, a beautiful
little animal&mdash;one of his own dogs, by the way. With the
skill of an expert, he hacked and cut away what he considered
would be sufficient for a meal. I could not take my eyes off his
work; the delicate little cutlets had an absolutely hypnotizing
effect as they were spread out one by one over the snow. They
recalled memories of old days, when no doubt a dog cutlet would
have been less tempting than now&mdash;memories of dishes on
which the cutlets were elegantly arranged side by side, with
paper frills on the bones, and a neat pile of <i>petits pois</i>
in the middle. Ah, my thoughts wandered still farther
afield&mdash;but that does not concern us now, nor has it
anything to do with the South Pole.</p>
<p>I was aroused from my musings by Wisting digging his axe into
the snow as a sign that his work was done, after which he picked
up the cutlets, and went into the tent. The clouds had dispersed
somewhat, and from time to time the sun appeared, though not in
its most genial aspect. We succeeded in catching it just in time
to get our latitude determined&mdash;85&deg; 36' S. We were
lucky, as not long after the wind got up from the
east-south-east, and, before we knew what was happening,
everything was in a cloud of snow. But now we snapped our fingers
at the weather; what difference did it make to us if the wind
howled in the guy-ropes and the snow drifted? We had, in any
case, made up our minds to stay here for a while, and we had food
in abundance. We knew the dogs thought much the same so long as
we have enough to eat, let the weather go hang.</p>
<p>Inside the tent Wisting was getting on well when we came in
after making these observations. The pot was on, and, to judge by
the savoury smell, the preparations were already far advanced.
The cutlets were not fried; we had neither frying-pan nor butter.
We could, no doubt, have got some lard out of the pemmican, and
we might have contrived some sort of a pan, so that we could have
fried them if it had been necessary; but we found it far easier
and quicker to boil them, and in this way we got excellent soup
into the bargain. Wisting knew his business surprisingly well; he
had put into the soup all those parts of the pemmican that
contained most vegetables, and now he served us the finest fresh
meat soup with vegetables in it. The <i>clou</i> of the repast
was the dish of cutlets. If we had entertained the slightest
doubt of the quality of the meat, this vanished instantly on the
first trial. The meat was excellent, quite excellent, and one
cutlet after another disappeared with lightning-like rapidity. I
must admit that they would have lost nothing by being a little
more tender, but one must not expect too much of a dog. At this
first meal I finished five cutlets myself, and looked in vain in
the pot for more. Wisting appeared not to have reckoned on such a
brisk demand.</p>
<p>We employed the afternoon in going through our stock of
provisions, and dividing the whole of it among three sledges; the
fourth&mdash;Hassel's&mdash;was to be left behind. The provisions
were thus divided. Sledge No.1 (Wisting's) contained:</p>
<p>Biscuits, 3,700 (daily ration, 40 biscuits per man).</p>
<p>Dogs' pemmican, 277&frac34; pounds (&frac12; kilogram, or 1
pound 1&frac12; ounces per dog per day).</p>
<p>Men's pemmican, 59&frac12; pounds (350 grams, or 12.34 ounces
per man per day).</p>
<p>Chocolate, 12&frac34; pounds (40 grams, or 1.4 ounces per man
per day).</p>
<p>Milk-powder, 13&frac14; pounds (60 grams, or 2.1 ounces per
man per day).</p>
<p>The other two sledges had approximately the same supplies, and
thus permitted us on leaving this place to extend our march over
a period of sixty days with full rations. Our eighteen surviving
dogs were divided into three teams, six in each. According to our
calculation, we ought to be able to reach the Pole from here with
these eighteen, and to leave it again with sixteen. Hassel, who
was to leave his sledge at this point, thus concluded his
provision account, and the divided provisions were entered in the
books of the three others.</p>
<p>All this, then, was done that day on paper. It remained to
make the actual transfer of provisions later, when the weather
permitted. To go out and do it that afternoon was not advisable.
Next day, November 23, the wind had gone round to the north-east,
with comparatively manageable weather, so at seven in the morning
we began to repack the sledges. This was not an altogether
pleasant task; although the weather was what I have called
"comparatively manageable," it was very far from being suitable
for packing provisions. The chocolate, which by this time
consisted chiefly of very small pieces, had to be taken out,
counted, and then divided among the three sledges. The same with
the biscuits; every single biscuit had to be taken out and
counted, and as we had some thousands of them to deal with, it
will readily be understood what it was to stand there in about
-4&deg; F. and a gale of wind, most of the time with bare hands,
fumbling over this troublesome occupation. The wind increased
while we were at work, and when at last we had finished, the snow
was so thick that we could scarcely see the tent.</p>
<p>Our original intention of starting again as soon as the
sledges were ready was abandoned. We did not lose very much by
this; on the contrary, we gained on the whole. The dogs&mdash;the
most important factor of all&mdash;had a thorough rest, and were
well fed. They had undergone a remarkable change since our
arrival at the Butcher's Shop; they now wandered about, fat,
sleek, and contented, and their former voracity had completely
disappeared. As regards ourselves, a day or two longer made no
difference; our most important article of diet, the pemmican, was
practically left untouched, as for the time being dog had
completely taken its place. There was thus no great sign of
depression to be noticed when we came back into the tent after
finishing our work, and had to while away the time. As I went in,
I could descry Wisting a little way off kneeling on the ground,
and engaged in the manufacture of cutlets. The dogs stood in a
ring round him, and looked on with interest. The north-east wind
whistled and howled, the air was thick with driving snow, and
Wisting was not to be envied. But he managed his work well, and
we got our dinner as usual. During the evening the wind moderated
a little, and went more to the east; we went to sleep with the
best hopes for the following day.</p>
<p>Saturday, November 25, came; it was a grand day in many
respects. I had already seen proofs on several occasions of the
kind of men my comrades were, but their conduct that day was such
that I shall never forget it, to whatever age I may live. In the
course of the night the wind had gone back to the north, and
increased to a gale. It was blowing and snowing so that when we
came out in the morning we could not see the sledges; they were
half snowed under. The dogs had all crept together, and protected
themselves as well as they could against the blizzard. The
temperature was not so very low (-16.6&deg; F.), but low enough
to be disagreeably felt in a storm. We had all taken a turn
outside to look at the weather, and were sitting on our
sleeping-bags discussing the poor prospect. "It's the devil's own
weather here at the Butcher's," said one; "it looks to me as if
it would never get any better. This is the fifth day, and it's
blowing worse than ever." We all agreed. "There's nothing so bad
as lying weather-bound like this," continued another; "it takes
more out of you than going from morning to night." Personally, I
was of the same opinion. One day may be pleasant enough, but two,
three, four, and, as it now seemed, five days&mdash;no, it was
awful. "Shall we try it?" No sooner was the proposal submitted
than it was accepted unanimously and with acclamation. When I
think of my four friends of the southern journey, it is the
memory of that morning that comes first to my mind. All the
qualities that I most admire in a man were clearly shown at that
juncture: courage and dauntlessness, without boasting or big
words. Amid joking and chaff, everything was packed, and
then&mdash;out into the blizzard.</p>

EXPEDITION.<br>

<br>
<p>It was practically impossible to keep one's eyes open; the
fine drift-snow penetrated everywhere, and at times one had a
feeling of being blind. The tent was not only drifted up, but
covered with ice, and in taking it down we had to handle it with
care. so as not to break it in pieces. The dogs were not much
inclined to start, and it took time to get them into their
harness, but at last we were ready. One more glance over the
camping-ground to see that nothing we ought to have with us had
been forgotten. The fourteen dogs' carcasses that were left were
piled up in a heap, and Hassel's sledge was set up against it as
a mark. The spare sets of dog-harness, some Alpine ropes, and all
our crampons for ice-work, which we now thought would not be
required, were left behind. The last thing to be done was
planting a broken ski upright by the side of the depot. It was
Wisting who did this, thinking, presumably, that an extra mark
would do no harm. That it was a happy thought the future will
show.</p>
<p>And then we were off: It was a hard pull to begin with, both
for men and beasts, as the high <i>sastrugi</i> continued towards
the south, and made it extremely difficult to advance. Those who
had sledges to drive had to be very attentive, and support them
so that they did not capsize on the big waves, and we who had no
sledges found great difficulty in keeping our feet, as we had
nothing to lean against. We went on like this, slowly enough, but
the main thing was that we made progress. The ground at first
gave one the impression of rising, though not much. The going was
extremely heavy; it was like dragging oneself through sand.
Meanwhile the <i>sastrugi</i> grew smaller and smaller, and
finally they disappeared altogether, and the surface became quite
flat. The going also improved by degrees, for what reason it is
difficult to say, as the storm continued unabated, and the
drift&mdash;now combined with falling snow&mdash;was thicker than
ever. It was all the driver could do to see his own dogs. The
surface, which had become perfectly level, had the appearance at
times of sinking; in any case, one would have thought so from the
pace of the sledges. Now and again the dogs would set off
suddenly at a gallop. The wind aft, no doubt, helped the pace
somewhat, but it alone could not account for the change.</p>
<p>I did not like this tendency of the ground to fall away. In my
opinion, we ought to have done with anything of that sort after
reaching the height at which we were; a slight slope upward,
possibly, but down&mdash;no, that did not agree with my
reckoning. So far the incline had not been so great as to cause
uneasiness, but if it seriously began to go downhill, we should
have to stop and camp. To run down at full gallop, blindly and in
complete ignorance of the ground, would be madness. We might risk
falling into some chasm before we had time to pull up.</p>
<p>Hanssen, as usual, was driving first. Strictly speaking, I
should now have been going in advance, but the uneven surface at
the start and the rapid pace afterwards had made it impossible to
walk as fast the dogs could pull. I was therefore following by
the side of Wisting's sledge, and chatting with him. Suddenly I
saw Hanssen's dogs shoot ahead, and downhill they went at the
wildest pace, Wisting after them. I shouted to Hanssen to stop,
and he succeeded in doing so by twisting his sledge. The others,
who were following, stopped when they came up to him. We were in
the middle of a fairly steep descent; what there might be below
was not easy to decide, nor would we try to find out in that
weather. Was it possible that we were on our way down through the
mountains again? It seemed more probable that we lay on one of
the numerous ridges; but we could be sure of nothing before the
weather cleared. We trampled down a place for the tent in the
loose snow, and soon got it up. It was not a long day's march
that we had done&mdash;eleven and three-quarter miles&mdash;but
we had put an end to our stay at the Butcher's Shop, and that was
a great thing. The boiling-point test that evening showed that we
were 10,300 feet above the sea, and that we had thus gone down
620 feet from the Butcher's. We turned in and went to sleep. As
soon as it brightened, we should have to be ready to jump out and
look at the weather; one has to seize every opportunity in these
regions. If one neglects to do so, it may mean a long wait and
much may be lost. We therefore all slept with one eye open, and
we knew well that nothing could happen without our noticing
it.</p>
<p>At three in the morning the sun cut through the clouds and we
through the tent-door. To take in the situation was more than the
work of a moment. The sun showed as yet like a pat of butter, and
had not succeeded in dispersing the thick mists; the wind had
dropped somewhat, but was still fairly strong. This is, after
all, the worst part of one's job&mdash;turning out of one's good,
warm sleeping-bag, and standing outside for some time in thin
clothes, watching the weather. We knew by experience that a gleam
like this, a clearing in the weather, might come suddenly, and
then one had to be on the spot. The gleam came; it did not last
long, but long enough. We lay on the side of a ridge that fell
away pretty steeply. The descent on the south was too abrupt, but
on the south-east it was better and more gradual, and ended in a
wide, level tract. We could see no crevasses or unpleasantness of
any kind. It was not very far that we could see, though; only our
nearest surroundings. Of the mountains we saw nothing, neither
Fridtjof Nansen nor Don Pedro Christophersen. Well content with
our morning's work, we turned in again and slept till 6 a.m.,
when we began our morning preparations. The weather, which had
somewhat improved during the night, had now broken loose again,
and the north-easter was doing all it could. However, it would
take more than storm and snow to stop us now, since we had
discovered the nature of our immediate surroundings; if we once
got down to the plain, we knew that we could always feel our way
on.</p>
<p>After putting ample brakes on the sledge-runners, we started
off downhill in a south-easterly direction. The slight idea of
the position that we had been able to get in the morning proved
correct. The descent was easy and smooth, and we reached the
plain without any adventure. We could now once more set our faces
to the south, and in thick driving snow we continued our way into
the unknown, with good assistance from the howling north-easterly
gale. We now recommenced the erection of beacons, which had not
been necessary during the ascent. In the course of the forenoon
we again passed over a little ridge, the last of them that we
encountered. The surface was now fine enough, smooth as a floor
and without a sign of <i>sastrugi</i>. If our progress was
nevertheless slow and difficult, this was due to the wretched
going, which was real torture to all of us. A sledge journey
through the Sahara could not have offered a worse surface to move
over. Now the forerunners came into their own, and from here to
the Pole Hassel. and I took it in turns to occupy the
position.</p>
<p>The weather improved in the course of the day, and when we
camped in the afternoon it looked quite smiling. The sun came
through and gave a delightful warmth after the last few bitter
days. It was not yet clear, so that we could see nothing of our
surroundings. The distance according to our three sledge-meters
was eighteen and a half miles; taking the bad going into
consideration, we had reason to be well satisfied with it. Our
altitude came out at 9,475 feet above the sea, or a drop of 825
feet in the course of the day. This surprised me greatly. What
did it mean? Instead of rising gradually, we were going slowly
down. Something extraordinary must await us farther on, but,
what? According to dead reckoning our latitude that evening was
86&deg; S.</p>
<p>November 27 did not bring us the desired weather; the night
was filled with sharp gusts from the north; the morning came with
a slack wind, but accompanied by mist and snowfall. This was
abominable; here we were, advancing over absolutely virgin
ground, and able to see nothing. The surface remained about the
same&mdash;possibly rather more undulating. That it had been
blowing here at some time, and violently too, was shown by the
under-surface, which was composed of <i>sastrugi</i> as hard as
iron. Luckily for us, the snowfall of the last few days had
filled these up, so as to present a level surface. It was heavy
going, though better than on the previous day.</p>
<p>As we were advancing, still blindly, and fretting at the
persistently thick weather, one of us suddenly called out:
"Hullo, look there!" A wild, dark summit rose high out of the
mass of fog to the east-south-east. It was not far away&mdash;on
the contrary, it seemed threateningly near and right over us. We
stopped and looked at the imposing sight, but Nature did not
expose her objects of interest for long. The fog rolled over
again, thick, heavy and dark, and blotted out the view. We knew
now that we had to be prepared for surprises. After we had gone
about ten miles the fog again lifted for a moment, and we saw
quite near&mdash;a mile or so away&mdash;two long, narrow
mountain ridges to the west of us, running north and south, and
completely covered with snow. These&mdash;Helland Hansen's
Mountains&mdash;were the only ones we saw on our right hand
during the march on the plateau; they were between 9,000 and
10,000 feet high, and would probably serve as excellent landmarks
on the return journey. There was no connection to be traced
between these mountains and those lying to the east of them; they
gave us the impression of being entirely isolated summits, as we
could not make out any lofty ridge running east and west. We
continued our course in the constant expectation of finding some
surprise or other in our line of route. The air ahead of us was
as black as pitch, as though it concealed something. It could not
be a storm, or it would have been already upon us. But we went on
and on, and nothing came. Our day's march was eighteen and a half
miles.</p>
<p>I see that my diary for November 28 does not begin very
promisingly: "Fog, fog&mdash;and again fog. Also fine falling
snow, which makes the going impossible. Poor beasts, they have
toiled hard to get the sledges forward to-day." But the day did
not turn out so badly after all, as we worked our way out of this
uncertainty and found out what was behind the pitch-dark clouds.
During the forenoon the sun came through and thrust aside the fog
for a while; and there, to the south-east, not many miles away,
lay an immense mountain mass. From this mass, right across our
course, ran a great, ancient glacier; the sun shone down upon it
and showed us a surface full of huge irregularities. On the side
nearest to the mountain these disturbances were such that a hasty
glance was enough to show us the impossibility of advancing that
way. But right in our line of route&mdash;straight on to the
glacier&mdash;it looked, as far as we could see, as though we
could get along. The fog came and went, and we had to take
advantage of the clear intervals to get our bearings. It would,
no doubt, have been better if we could have halted, set up our
tent, and waited for decently clear weather, so that we might
survey the ground at our ease and choose the best way. Going
forward without an idea of what the ground was like, was not very
pleasant. But how long should we have to wait for clear weather?
That question was unanswerable; possibly a week, or even a
fortnight, and we had no time for that. Better go straight on,
then, and take what might come.</p>
<p>What we could see of the glacier appeared to be pretty steep;
but it was only between the south and south-east, under the new
land, that the fog now and again lifted sufficiently to enable us
to see anything. From the south round to the west the fog lay as
thick as gruel. We could see that the big crevasses lost
themselves in it, and the question of what the glacier looked
like on the west had to be put aside for the moment. It was to
the south we had to go, and there it was possible to go forward a
little way. We continued our march until the ground began to show
signs of the glacier in the form of small crevasses, and then we
halted. It was our intention to lighten our sledges before
tackling the glacier; from the little we could see of it, it was
plain enough that we should have stiff work. It was therefore
important to have as little as possible on the sledges.</p>
<p>We set to work at once to build the depot; the snow here was
excellent for this purpose&mdash;as hard as glass. In a short
time an immense erection of adamantine blocks of snow rose into
the air, containing provisions for five men for six days and for
eighteen dogs for five days. A number of small articles were also
left behind.</p>
<p>While we were thus occupied, the fog had been coming and
going; some of the intervals had been quite clear, and had given
me a good view of the nearest part of the range. It appeared to
be quite isolated, and to consist of four mountains; one of
these&mdash;Mount Helmer Hanssen&mdash;lay separated from the
rest. The other three&mdash;Mounts Oscar Wisting, Sverre Hassel,
and Olav Bjaaland&mdash;lay closer together. Behind this group
the air had been heavy and black the whole time, showing that
more land must be concealed there. Suddenly, in one of the
brightest intervals, there came a rift in this curtain, and the
summits of a colossal mountain mass appeared. Our first
impression was that this mountain&mdash;Mount Thorvald
Nilsen&mdash;must be something over 20,000 feet high; it
positively took our breath away, so formidable did it appear. But
it was only a glimpse that we had, and then the fog enclosed it
once more. We had succeeded in taking a few meagre bearings of
the different summits of the nearest group; they were not very
grand, but better ones were not to be obtained. For that matter,
the site of the depot was so well marked by its position under
the foot of the glacier that we agreed it would be impossible to
miss it.</p>
<p>Having finished the edifice, which rose at least 6 feet into
the air, we put one of our black provision cases on the top of
it, so as to be able to see it still more easily on the way back.
An observation we had contrived to take while the work was in
progress gave us our latitude as 86&deg; 21' S. This did not
agree very well with the latitude of our dead
reckoning&mdash;86&deg; 23' S. Meanwhile the fog had again
enveloped everything, and a fine, light snow was falling. We had
taken a bearing of the line of glacier that was most free of
crevasses, and so we moved on again. It was some time before we
felt our way up to the glacier. The crevasses at its foot were
not large, but we had no sooner entered upon the ascent than the
fun began. There was something uncanny about this perfectly blind
advance among crevasses and chasms on all sides. We examined the
compass from time to time, and went forward cautiously.</p>
<p>Hassel and I went in front on a rope; but that, after all, was
not much of a help to our drivers. We naturally glided lightly on
our ski over places where the dogs would easily fall through.
This lowest part of the glacier was not entirely free from
danger, as the crevasses were often rendered quite invisible by a
thin overlying layer of snow. In clear weather it is not so bad
to have to cross such a surface, as the effect of light and shade
is usually to show up the edges of these insidious pitfalls, but
on a day like this, when everything looked alike, one's advance
is doubtful. We kept it going, however, by using the utmost
caution. Wisting came near to sounding the depth of one of these
dangerous crevasses with sledge, dogs and all, as the bridge he
was about to cross gave way. Thanks to his presence of mind and a
lightning-like movement&mdash;some would call it luck&mdash;he
managed to save himself. In this way we worked up about 200 feet,
but then we came upon such a labyrinth of yawning chasms and open
abysses that we could not move. There was nothing to be done but
to find the least disturbed spot, and set the tent there.</p>
<p>As soon as this was done Hanssen and I set out to explore. We
were roped, and therefore safe enough. It required some study to
find a way out of the trap we had run ourselves into. Towards the
group of mountains last described&mdash;which now lay to the east
of us&mdash;it had cleared sufficiently to give us a fairly good
view of the appearance of the glacier in that direction. What we
had before seen at a distance, was now confirmed. The part
extending to the mountains was so ground up and broken that there
was positively not a spot where one could set one's foot. It
looked as if a battle had been fought here, and the ammunition
had been great blocks of ice. They lay pell-mell, one on the top
of another, in all directions, and evoked a picture of violent
confusion. Thank God we were not here while this was going on, I
thought to myself, as I stood looking out over this battlefield;
it must have been a spectacle like doomsday, and not on a small
scale either. To advance in that direction, then, was hopeless,
but that was no great matter, since our way was to the south. On
the south we could see nothing; the fog lay thick and heavy
there. All we could do was to try to make our way on, and we
therefore crept southward.</p>
<p>On leaving our tent we had first to cross a comparatively
narrow snow-bridge, and then go along a ridge or saddle, raised
by pressure, with wide open crevasses on both sides. This ridge
led us on to an ice-wave about 25 feet high&mdash;a formation
which was due to the pressure having ceased before the wave had
been forced to break and form hummocks. We saw well enough that
this would be a difficult place to pass with sledges and dogs,
but in default of anything better it would have to be done. From
the top of this wave-formation we could see down on the other
side, which had hitherto been hidden from us. The fog prevented
our seeing far, but the immediate surroundings were enough to
convince us that with caution we could beat up farther. From the
height on which we stood, every precaution would be required to
avoid going down on the other side; for there the wave ended in
an open crevasse, specially adapted to receive any drivers,
sledges or dogs that might make a slip.</p>
<p>This trip that Hanssen and I took to the south was made
entirely at random, as we saw absolutely nothing; our object was
to make tracks for the following day's journey. The language we
used about the glacier as we went was not altogether
complimentary; we had endless tacking and turning to get on. To
go one yard forward, I am sure we had to go at least ten to one
side. Can anyone be surprised that we called it the Devil's
Glacier? At any rate, our companions acknowledged the justness of
the name with ringing acclamations when we told them of it.</p>
<p>At Hell's Gate Hanssen and I halted. This was a very
remarkable formation; the glacier had here formed a long ridge
about 20 feet high; then, in the middle of this ridge, a fissure
had opened, making a gateway about 6 feet wide. This
formation&mdash;like everything else on the glacier&mdash;was
obviously very old, and for the most part filled with snow. From
this point the glacier, as far as our view extended to the south,
looked better and better; we therefore turned round and followed
our tracks in the comforting conviction that we should manage to
get on.</p>
<p>Our companions were no less pleased with the news we brought
of our prospects. Our altitude that evening was 8,650 feet above
the sea&mdash;that is to say, at the foot of the glacier we had
reached an altitude of 8,450 feet, or a drop from the Butcher's
of 2,570 feet. We now knew very well that we should have this
ascent to make again, perhaps even more; and this idea did not
arouse any particular enthusiasm. In my diary I see that I
conclude the day with the following words "What will the next
surprise be, I wonder?"</p>
<br>

<small>A LARGE FILLED CREVASSE ON THE DEVIL'S
GLACIER.</small></p>
<br>
<p>It was, in fact, an extraordinary journey that we were
undertaking, through new regions, new mountains, glaciers, and so
on, without being able to see. That we were prepared for
surprises was perhaps quite natural. What I liked least about
this feeling one's way forward in the dark was that it would be
difficult&mdash;very difficult indeed&mdash;to recognize the
ground again on the way back. But with this glacier lying
straight across our line of route, and with the numerous beacons
we had erected, we reassured ourselves on this score. It would
take a good deal to make us miss them on the return. The point
for us, of course, was to find our descent on to the Barrier
again&mdash;a mistake there might be serious enough. And it will
appear later in this narrative that my fear of our not being able
to recognize the way was not entirely groundless. The beacons we
had put up came to our aid, and for our final success we owe a
deep debt of gratitude to our prudence and thoughtfulness in
adopting this expedient.</p>
<p>Next morning, November 29, brought considerably clearer
weather, and allowed us a very good survey of our position. We
could now see that the two mountain ranges uniting in 86&deg; S.
were continued in a mighty chain running to the south-east, with
summits from 10,000 to 15,000 feet. Mount Thorvald Nilsen was the
most southerly we could see from this point. Mounts Hanssen,
Wisting, Bjaaland, and Hassel formed, as we had thought the day
before, a group by themselves, and lay separated from the main
range.</p>
<p>The drivers had a warm morning's work. They had to drive with
great circumspection and patience to grapple with the kind of
ground we had before us; a slight mistake might be enough to send
both sledge and dogs with lightning rapidity into the next world.
It took, nevertheless, a remarkably short time to cover the
distance we had explored on the previous evening; before we knew
it, we were at Hell's Gate.</p>
<p>Bjaaland took an excellent photograph here, which gives a very
good idea of the difficulties this part of the journey presented.
In the foreground, below the high snow-ridge that forms one side
of a very wide but partly filled-up crevasse, the marks of ski
can be seen in the snow. This was the photographer, who, in
passing over this snow-bridge, struck his ski into it to try the
strength of the support. Close to the tracks can be seen an open
piece of the crevasse; it is a pale blue at the top, but ends in
the deepest black&mdash;in a bottomless abyss. The photographer
got over the bridge and back with a whole skin, but there could
be no question of risking sledges and dogs on it, and it can be
seen in the photograph that the sledges have been turned right
round to try another way. The two small black figures in the
distance, on the right, are Hassel and I, who are reconnoitring
ahead.</p>

<small>HELL'S GATE ON THE DEVIL'S GLACIER.</small></p>
<br>
<p>It was no very great distance that we put behind us that
day&mdash;nine and a quarter miles in a straight line. But,
taking into account all the turns and circuits we had been
compelled to make, it was not so short after all. We set our tent
on a good, solid foundation, and were well pleased with the day's
work. The altitude was 8,960 feet above the sea. The sun was now
in the west, and shining directly upon the huge mountain masses.
It was a fairy landscape in blue and white, red and black, a play
of colours that defies description. Clear as it now appeared to
be, one could understand that the weather was not all that could
be wished, for the south-eastern end of Mount Thorvald Nilsen
lost itself in a dark, impenetrable cloud, which led one to
suspect a continuation in that direction, though one could not be
certain.</p>
<p>Mount Nilsen&mdash;ah! anything more beautiful, taking it
altogether, I have never seen. Peaks of the most varied forms
rose high into the air, partly covered with driving clouds. Some
were sharp, but most were long and rounded. Here and there one
saw bright, shining glaciers plunging wildly down the steep
sides, and merging into the underlying ground in fearful
confusion. But the most remarkable of them all was Mount Helmer
Hanssen; its top was as round as the bottom of a bowl, and
covered by an extraordinary ice-sheet, which was so broken up and
disturbed that the blocks of ice bristled in every direction like
the quills of a porcupine. It glittered and burned in the
sunlight&mdash;a glorious spectacle. There could only be one such
mountain in the world, and as a landmark it was priceless. We
knew that we could not mistake that, however the surroundings
might appear on the return journey, when possibly the conditions
of lighting might be altogether different.</p>
<p>After camping, two of us went out to explore farther. The
prospect from the tent was not encouraging, but we might possibly
find things better than we expected. We were lucky to find the
going so fine as it was on the glacier; we had left our crampons
behind at the Butcher's Shop, and if we had found smooth ice,
instead of a good, firm snow surface, such as we now had, it
would have caused us much trouble. Up&mdash;still up, among
monsters of crevasses, some of them hundreds of feet wide and
possibly thousands of feet deep. Our prospects of advancing were
certainly not bright; as far as we could see in the line of our
route one immense ridge towered above another, concealing on
their farther sides huge, wide chasms, which all had to be
avoided. We went forward&mdash;steadily forward&mdash;though the
way round was both long and troublesome. We had no rope on this
time, as the irregularities were so plain that it would have been
difficult to go into them. It turned out, however, at several
points, that the rope would not have been out of place. We were
just going to cross over one of the numerous ridges&mdash;the
surface here looked perfectly whole&mdash;when a great piece
broke right under the back half of Hanssen's ski. We could not
deny ourselves the pleasure of glancing down into the hole. The
sight was not an inviting one, and we agreed to avoid this place
when we came on with our dogs and sledges.</p>
<p>Every day we had occasion to bless our ski. We often used to
ask each other where we should now have been without these
excellent appliances. The usual answer was: Most probably at the
bottom of some crevasse. When we first read the different
accounts of the aspect and nature of the Barrier, it was clear to
all of us, who were born and bred with ski on our feet, that
these must be regarded as indispensable. This view was confirmed
and strengthened every day, and I am not giving too much credit
to our excellent ski when I say that they not only played a very
important part, but possibly the most important of all, on our
journey to the South Pole. Many a time we traversed stretches of
surface so cleft and disturbed that it would have been an
impossibility to get over them on foot. I need scarcely insist on
the advantages of ski in deep, loose snow.</p>
<p>After advancing for two hours, we decided to return. From the
raised ridge on which we were then standing, the surface ahead of
us looked more promising than ever; but we had so often been
deceived on the glacier that we had now become definitely
sceptical. How often, for instance, had we thought that beyond
this or that undulation our trials would be at an end, and that
the way to the south would lie open and free; only to reach the
place and find that the ground behind the ridge was, if possible,
worse than what we had already been struggling with. But this
time we seemed somehow to feel victory in the air. The formations
appeared to promise it, and yet&mdash;had we been so often
deceived by these formations that we now refused to offer them a
thought? Was it possibly instinct that told us this? I do not
know, but certain it is that Hanssen and I agreed, as we stood
there discussing our prospects, that behind the farthest ridge we
saw, we should conquer the glacier. We had a feverish desire to
go and have a look at it; but the way round the many crevasses
was long, and&mdash;I may as well admit it&mdash;we were
beginning to get tired. The return, downhill as it was, did not
take long, and soon we were able to tell our comrades that the
prospects for the morrow were very promising.</p>
<p>While we had been away, Hassel had measured the Nilsen
Mountain, and found its height to be 15,500 feet above the sea.
How well I remember that evening, when we stood contemplating the
glorious sight that Nature offered, and believing the air to be
so clear that anything within range of vision must have shown
itself; and how well, too, I remember our astonishment on the
return journey on finding the whole landscape completely
transformed! If it had not been for Mount Helmer Hanssen, it
would have been difficult for us to know where we were. The
atmosphere in these regions may play the most awkward tricks.
Absolutely clear as it seemed to us that evening, it nevertheless
turned out later that it had been anything but clear. One has,
therefore, to be very careful about what one sees or does not
see. In most cases it has proved that travellers in the Polar
regions have been more apt to see too much than too little; if,
however, we had charted this tract as we saw it the first time, a
great part of the mountain ranges would have been omitted.</p>

<small>MOUNT THORVALD NILSEN.</small></p>
<br>
<p>During the night a gale sprang up from the south-east, and
blew so that it howled in the guy-ropes of the tent; it was well
that the tent-pegs had a good hold. In the morning, while we were
at breakfast, it was still blowing, and we had some thoughts of
waiting for a time; but suddenly, without warning, the wind
dropped to such an extent that all our hesitation vanished. What
a change the south-east wind had produced! The splendid covering
of snow that the day before had made ski-running a pleasure, was
now swept away over great stretches of surface, exposing the hard
substratum. Our thoughts flew back; the crampons we had left
behind seemed to dance before my eyes, backwards and forwards,
grinning and pointing fingers at me. It would be a nice little
extra trip back to the Butcher's to fetch them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we packed and made everything ready. The tracks of
the day before were not easy to follow; but if we lost them now
and again on the smooth ice surface, we picked them up later on a
snow-wave that had resisted the attack of the wind. It was hard
and strenuous work for the drivers. The sledges were difficult to
manage over the smooth, sloping ice; sometimes they went
straight, but just as often cross-wise, requiring sharp attention
to keep them from capsizing. And this had to be prevented at all
costs, as the thin provision cases would not stand many bumps on
the ice; besides which, it was such hard work righting the
sledges again that for this reason alone the drivers exercised
the greatest care. The sledges were put to a severe test that
day, with the many great and hard irregularities we encountered
on the glacier; it is a wonder they survived it, and is a good
testimonial for Bjaaland's work.</p>
<p>The glacier that day presented the worst confusion we had yet
had to deal with. Hassel and I went in front, as usual, with the
rope on. Up to the spot Hanssen and I had reached the evening
before our progress was comparatively easy; one gets on so much
quicker when one knows that the way is practicable. After this
point it became worse; indeed, it was often so bad that we had to
stop for a long time and try in various directions, before
finding a way. More than once the axe had to be used to hack away
obstructions. At one time things looked really serious; chasm
after chasm, hummock after hummock, so high and steep that they
were like mountains. Here we went out and explored in every
direction to find a passage; at last we found one, if, indeed, it
deserved the name of a passage. It was a bridge so narrow that it
scarcely allowed room for the width of the sledge; a fearful
abyss on each side. The crossing of this place reminded me of the
tight-rope walker going over Niagara. It was a good thing none of
us was subject to giddiness, and that the dogs did not know
exactly what the result of a false step would be.</p>
<p>On the other side of this bridge we began to go downhill, and
our course now lay in a long valley between lofty undulations on
each side. It tried our patience severely to advance here, as the
line of the hollow was fairly long and ran due west. We tried
several times to lay our course towards the south and clamber up
the side of the undulation, but these efforts did not pay us. We
could always get up on to the ridge, but we could not come down
again on the other side; there was nothing to be done but to
follow the natural course of the valley until it took us into the
tract lying to the south. It was especially the drivers whose
patience was sorely tried, and I could see them now and then take
a turn up to the top of the ridge, not satisfied with the
exploration Hassel and I had made. But the result was always the
same; they had to submit to Nature's caprices and follow in our
tracks.</p>
<p>Our course along this natural line was not entirely free from
obstruction; crevasses of various dimensions constantly crossed
our path. The ridge or undulation, at the top of which we at last
arrived, had quite an imposing effect. It terminated on the east
in a steep drop to the underlying surface, and attained at this
point a height of over 100 feet. On the west it sloped gradually
into the lower ground and allowed us to advance that way. In
order to have a better view of the surroundings we ascended the
eastern and highest part of the ridge, and from here we at once
had a confirmation of our supposition of the day before. The
ridge we had then seen, behind which we hoped to find better
conditions, could now be seen a good way ahead. And what we then
saw made our hearts beat fast with joy. Could that great white,
unbroken plain over there be real, or was it only an illusion?
Time would show.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Hassel and I jogged on, and the others followed. We
had to get through a good many difficulties yet before we reached
that point, but, compared with all the breakneck places we had
already crossed, these were of a comparatively tame description.
It was with a sigh of relief that we arrived at the plain that
promised so well; its extent was not very great, but we were not
very exacting either in this respect, after our last few days'
march over the broken surface. Farther to the south we could
still see great masses piled up by pressure, but the intervals
between them were very great and the surface was whole. This was,
then, the first time since we tackled the Devil's Glacier that we
were able to steer true south for a few minutes.</p>
<p>As we progressed, it could be seen that we had really come
upon another kind of ground; for once we had not been made fools
of. Not that we had an unbroken, level surface to go
upon&mdash;it would be a long time before we came to
that&mdash;but we were able to keep our course for long stretches
at a time. The huge crevasses became rarer, and so filled up at
both ends that we were able to cross them without going a long
way round. There was new life in all of us, both dogs and men,
and we went rapidly southward. As we advanced, the conditions
improved more and more. We could see in the distance some huge
dome-shaped formations, that seemed to tower high into the air:
these turned out to be the southernmost limit of the big
crevasses and to form the transition to the third phase of the
glacier.</p>
<p>It was a stiff climb to get up these domes, which were fairly
high and swept smooth by the wind. They lay straight in our
course, and from their tops we had a good view. The surface we
were entering upon was quite different from that on the northern
side of the domes. Here the big crevasses were entirely filled
with snow and might be crossed anywhere. What specially attracted
one's attention here was an immense number of small formations in
the shape of haycocks. Great stretches of the surface were swept
bare, exposing the smooth ice.</p>
<p>It was evident that these various formations or phases in the
glacier were due to the underlying ground. The first tract we had
passed, where the confusion was so extreme, must be the part that
lay nearest the bare land; in proportion as the glacier left the
land, it became less disturbed: In the haycock district the
disturbance had not produced cracks in the surface to any extent,
only upheaval here and there. How these haycocks were formed and
what they looked like inside we were soon to find out. It was a
pleasure to be able to advance all the time, instead of
constantly turning and going round; only once or twice did we
have to turn aside for the larger haycocks, otherwise we kept our
course. The great, clean-swept stretches of surface that we came
upon from time to time were split in every direction, but the
cracks were very narrow&mdash;about half an inch wide.</p>
<p>We had difficulty in finding a place for the tent that
evening; the surface was equally hard everywhere, and at last we
had to set it on the bare ice. Luckily for our tent-pegs, this
ice was not of the bright, steely variety; it was more milky in
appearance and not so hard, and we were thus able to knock in the
pegs with the axe. When the tent was up, Hassel went out as usual
to fetch snow for the cooker. As a rule he performed this task
with a big knife, specially made for snow; but this evening he
went out armed with an axe. He was very pleased with the abundant
and excellent material that lay to his hand; there was no need to
go far. Just outside the tent door, two feet away, stood a fine
little haycock, that looked as if it would serve the purpose
well. Hassel raised his axe and gave a good sound blow; the axe
met with no resistance, and went in up to the haft. The haycock
was hollow. As the axe was pulled out the surrounding part gave
way, and one could hear the pieces of ice falling down through
the dark hole. It appeared, then, that two feet from our door we
had a most convenient way down into the cellar. Hassel looked as
if he enjoyed the situation. "Black as a sack," he smiled;
"couldn't see any bottom." Hanssen was beaming; no doubt he would
have liked the tent a little nearer. The material provided by the
haycock was of the best quality, and well adapted for cooking
purposes.</p>
<p>The next day, December 1, was a very fatiguing one for us all.
From early morning a blinding blizzard raged from the south-east,
with a heavy fall of snow. The going was of the very worst
kind&mdash;polished ice. I stumbled forward on ski, and had
comparatively easy work. The drivers had been obliged to take off
their ski and put them on the loads, so as to walk by the side,
support the sledges, and give the dogs help when they came to a
difficult place; and that was pretty often, for on this smooth
ice surface there were a number of small scattered
<i>sastrugi</i>, and these consisted of a kind of snow that
reminded one more of fish-glue than of anything else when the
sledges came in contact with it. The dogs could get no hold with
their claws on the smooth ice, and when the sledge came on to one
of these tough little waves, they could not manage to haul it
over, try as they might. The driver then had to put all his
strength into it to prevent the sledge stopping. Thus in most
cases the combined efforts of men and dogs carried the sledge
on.</p>
<p>In the course of the afternoon the surface again began to be
more disturbed, and great crevasses crossed our path time after
time. These crevasses were really rather dangerous; they looked
very innocent, as they were quite filled up with snow, but on a
nearer acquaintance with them we came to understand that they
were far more hazardous than we dreamed of at first. It turned
out that between the loose snow-filling and the firm ice edges
there was a fairly broad, open space, leading straight down into
the depths. The layer of snow which covered it over was in most
cases quite thin. In driving out into one of these snow-filled
crevasses nothing happened as a rule; but it was in getting off
on the other side that the critical moment arrived. For here the
dogs came up on to the smooth ice surface, and could get no hold
for their claws, with the result that it was left entirely to the
driver to haul the the sledge up. The strong pull he then had to
give sent him through the thin layer of snow. Under these
circumstances he took a good, firm hold of the sledge-lashing, or
of a special strap that had been made with a view to these
accidents. But familiarity breeds contempt, even with the most
cautious, and some of the drivers were often within an ace of
going down into "the cellar."</p>
<p>If this part of the journey was trying for the dogs, it was
certainly no less so for the men. If the weather had even been
fine, so that we could have looked about us, we should not have
minded it so much, but in this vile weather it was, indeed, no
pleasure. Our time was also a good deal taken up with thawing
noses and cheeks as they froze&mdash;not that we stopped; we had
no time for that. We simply took off a mit, and laid the warm
hand on the frozen spot as we went; when we thought we had
restored sensation, we put the hand back into the mit. By this
time it would want warming. One does not keep one's hands bare
for long with the thermometer several degrees below zero and a
storm blowing. In spite of the unfavourable conditions we had
been working in, the sledge-meters that evening showed a distance
of fifteen and a half miles. We were well satisfied with the
day's work when we camped.</p>
<p>Let us cast a glance into the tent this evening. It looks cosy
enough. The inner half of the tent is occupied by three
sleeping-bags, whose respective owners have found it both
comfortable and expedient to turn in, and may now be seen engaged
with their diaries. The outer half&mdash;that nearest the
door&mdash;has only two sleeping-bags, but the rest of the space
is taken up with the whole cooking apparatus of the expedition.
The owners of these two bags are still sitting up. Hanssen is
cook, and will not turn in until the food is ready and served.
Wisting is his sworn comrade and assistant, and is ready to lend
him any aid that may be required. Hanssen appears to be a careful
cook; he evidently does not like to burn the food, and his spoon
stirs the contents of the pot incessantly. "Soup!" The effect of
the word is instantaneous. Everyone sits up at once with a cup in
one hand and a spoon in the other. Each one in his turn has his
cup filled with what looks like the most tasty vegetable soup.
Scalding hot it is, as one can see by the faces, but for all that
it disappears with surprising rapidity. Again the cups are
filled, this time with more solid stuff pemmican. With
praiseworthy despatch their contents are once more demolished,
and they are filled for the third time. There is nothing the
matter with these men's appetites. The cups are carefully
scraped, and the enjoyment of bread and water begins. It is easy
to see, too, that it is an enjoyment&mdash;greater, to judge by
the pleasure on their faces, than the most skilfully devised menu
could afford. They positively caress the biscuits before they eat
them. And the water&mdash;ice-cold water they all call
for&mdash;this also disappears in great quantities, and procures,
I feel certain from their expression, a far greater pleasure and
satisfaction than the finest wine that was ever produced. The
Primus hums softly during the whole meal, and the temperature in
the tent is quite pleasant.</p>
<p>When the meal is over, one of them calls for scissors and
looking-glass, and then one may see the Polar explorers dressing
their hair for the approaching Sunday. The beard is cut quite
short with the clipper every Saturday evening; this is done not
so much from motives of vanity as from considerations of utility
and comfort. The beard invites an accumulation of ice, which may
often be very embarrassing. A beard in the Polar regions seems to
me to be just as awkward and unpractical as&mdash;well, let us
say, walking with a tall hat on each foot. As the beard-clipper
and the mirror make their round, one after the other disappears
into his bag, and with five "Good-nights," silence falls upon the
tent. The regular breathing soon announces that the day's work
demands its tribute. Meanwhile the south-easter howls, and the
snow beats against the tent. The dogs have curled themselves up,
and do not seem to trouble themselves about the weather.</p>
<p>The storm continued unabated on the following day, and on
account of the dangerous nature of the ground we decided to wait
awhile. In the course of the morning&mdash;towards noon,
perhaps&mdash;the wind dropped a little, and out we went. The sun
peeped through at times, and we took the welcome opportunity of
getting an altitude&mdash;86&deg; 47' S. was the result.</p>
<p>At this camp we left behind all our delightful reindeer-skin
clothing, as we could see that we should have no use for it, the
temperature being far too high. We kept the hoods of our reindeer
coats, however; we might be glad of them in going against the
wind. Our day's march was not to be a long one; the little
slackening of the wind about midday was only a joke. It soon came
on again in earnest, with a sweeping blizzard from the same
quarter&mdash;the south-east. If we had known the ground, we
should possibly have gone on; but in this storm and driving snow,
which prevented our keeping our eyes open, it was no use. A
serious accident might happen and ruin all. Two and half miles
was therefore our whole distance. The temperature when we camped
was -5.8&deg; F. Height above the sea, 9,780 feet.</p>
<p>In the course of the night the wind veered from south-east to
north, falling light, and the weather cleared. This was a good
chance for us, and we were not slow to avail ourselves of it. A
gradually rising ice surface lay before us, bright as a mirror.
As on the preceding days, I stumbled along in front on ski, while
the others, without their ski, had to follow and support the
sledges. The surface still offered filled crevasses, though
perhaps less frequently than before. Meanwhile small patches of
snow began to show themselves on the polished surface, and soon
increased in number and size, until before very long they united
and covered the unpleasant ice with a good and even layer of
snow. Then ski were put on again, and we continued our way to the
south with satisfaction.</p>
<p>We were all rejoicing that we had now conquered this
treacherous glacier, and congratulating ourselves on having at
last arrived on the actual plateau. As we were going along,
feeling pleased about this, a ridge suddenly appeared right
ahead, telling us plainly that perhaps all our sorrows were not
yet ended. The ground had begun to sink a little, and as we came
nearer we could see that we had to cross a rather wide, but not
deep, valley before we arrived under the ridge. Great lines of
hummocks and haycock-shaped pieces of ice came in view on every
side; we could see that we should have to keep our eyes open.</p>
<p>And now we came to the formation in the glacier that we called
the Devil's Ballroom. Little by little the covering of snow that
we had praised in such high terms disappeared, and before us lay
this wide valley, bare and gleaming. At first it went well
enough; as it was downhill, we were going at a good pace on the
smooth ice. Suddenly Wisting's sledge cut into the surface, and
turned over on its side. We all knew what had happened&mdash;one
of the runners was in a crevasse. Wisting set to work, with the
assistance of Hassel, to raise the sledge, and take it out of its
dangerous position; meanwhile Bjaaland had got out his camera and
was setting it up. Accustomed as we were to such incidents,
Hanssen and I were watching the scene from a point a little way
in advance, where we had arrived when it happened. As the
photography took rather a long time, I assumed that the crevasse
was one of the filled ones and presented no particular danger,
but that Bjaaland wanted to have a souvenir among his photographs
of the numerous crevasses and ticklish situations we had been
exposed to. As to the crack being filled up, there was of course
no need to inquire. I hailed them, and asked how they were
getting on. "Oh, all right," was the answer; "we've just
finished."&mdash;"What does the crevasse look like?"&mdash;"Oh,
as usual," they shouted back; "no bottom." I mention this little
incident just to show how one can grow accustomed to anything in
this world. There were these two&mdash;Wisting and
Hassel&mdash;lying over a yawning, bottomless abyss, and having
their photograph taken; neither of them gave a thought to the
serious side of the situation. To judge from the laughter and
jokes we heard, one would have thought their position was
something quite different.</p>
<p>When the photographer had quietly and leisurely finished his
work&mdash;he got a remarkably good picture of the
scene&mdash;the other two together raised the sledge, and the
journey was continued. It was at this crevasse that we entered
his Majesty's Ballroom. The surface did not really look bad.
True, the snow was blown away, which made it difficult to
advance, but we did not see many cracks. There were a good many
pressure-masses, as already mentioned, but even in the
neighbourhood of these we could not see any marked disturbance.
The first sign that the surface was more treacherous than it
appeared to be was when Hanssen's leading dogs went right through
the apparently solid floor. They remained hanging by their
harness, and were easily pulled up again. When we looked through
the hole they had made in the crust, it did not give us the
impression of being very dangerous, as, 2 or 3 feet below the
outer crust, there lay another surface, which appeared to consist
of pulverized ice. We assumed that this lower surface was the
solid one, and that therefore there was no danger in falling
through the upper one. But Bjaaland was able to tell us a
different story. He had, in fact, fallen through the outer crust,
and was well on his way through the inner one as well, when he
got hold of a loop of rope on his sledge and saved himself in the
nick of time. Time after time the dogs now fell through, and time
after time the men went in. The effect of the open space between
the two crusts was that the ground under our feet sounded
unpleasantly hollow as we went over it. The drivers whipped up
their dogs as much as they could, and with shouts and brisk
encouragement they went rapidly over the treacherous floor.
Fortunately this curious formation was not of great extent, and
we soon began to observe a change for the better as we came up
the ridge. It soon appeared that the Ballroom was the glacier's
last farewell to us. With it all irregularities ceased, and both
surface and going improved by leaps and bounds, so that before
very long we had the satisfaction of seeing that at last we had
really conquered all these unpleasant difficulties. The surface
at once became fine and even, with a splendid covering of snow
everywhere, and we went rapidly on our way to the south with a
feeling of security and safety.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII<br>
<br>
<small>AT THE POLE</small></h3>
<p><small>IN</small> lat. 87&deg; S.&mdash;according to dead
reckoning&mdash;we saw the last of the land to the north-east.
The atmosphere was then apparently as clear as could be, and we
felt certain that our view covered all the land there was to be
seen from that spot. We were deceived again on this occasion, as
will be seen later. Our distance that day (December 4) was close
upon twenty-five miles; height above the sea, 10,100 feet.</p>
<p>The weather did not continue fine for long. Next day (December
5) there was a gale from the north, and once more the whole plain
was a mass of drifting snow. In addition to this there was thick
falling snow, which blinded us and made things worse, but a
feeling of security had come over us and helped us to advance
rapidly and without hesitation, although we could see nothing.
That day we encountered new surface conditions&mdash;big, hard
snow-waves (<i>sastrugi</i>). These were anything but pleasant to
work among, especially when one could not see them. It was of no
use for us "forerunners" to think of going in advance under these
circumstances, as it was impossible to keep on one's feet. Three
or four paces was often the most we managed to do before falling
down. The <i>sastrugi</i> were very high, and often abrupt; if
one came on them unexpectedly, one required to be more than an
acrobat to keep on one's feet. The plan we found to work best in
these conditions was to let Hanssen's dogs go first; this was an
unpleasant job for Hanssen, and for his dogs too, but it
succeeded, and succeeded well. An upset here and there was, of
course, unavoidable, but with a little patience the sledge was
always righted again. The drivers had as much as they could do to
support their sledges among these <i>sastrugi</i>, but while
supporting the sledges, they had at the same time a support for
themselves. It was worse for us who had no sledges, but by
keeping in the wake of them we could see where the irregularities
lay, and thus get over them. Hanssen deserves a special word of
praise for his driving on this surface in such weather. It is a
difficult matter to drive Eskimo dogs forward when they cannot
see; but Hanssen managed it well, both getting the dogs on and
steering his course by compass. One would not think it possible
to keep an approximately right course when the uneven ground
gives such violent shocks that the needle flies several times
round the compass, and is no sooner still again than it
recommences the same dance; but when at last we got an
observation, it turned out that Hanssen had steered to a hair,
for the observations and dead reckoning agreed to a mile. In
spite of all hindrances, and of being able to see nothing, the
sledge-meters showed nearly twenty-five miles. The hypsometer
showed 11,070 feet above the sea; we had therefore reached a
greater altitude than the Butcher's.</p>
<p>December 6 brought the same weather: thick snow, sky and plain
all one, nothing to be seen. Nevertheless we made splendid
progress. The <i>sastrugi</i> gradually became levelled out,
until the surface was perfectly smooth; it was a relief to have
even ground to go upon once more. These irregularities that one
was constantly falling over were a nuisance; if we had met with
them in our usual surroundings it would not have mattered so
much; but up here on the high ground, where we had to stand and
gasp for breath every time we rolled over, it was certainly not
pleasant.</p>
<p>That day we passed 88&deg; S., and camped in 88&deg; 9' S. A
great surprise awaited us in the tent that evening. I expected to
find, as on the previous evening, that the boiling-point had
fallen somewhat; in other words, that it would show a continued
rise of the ground, but to our astonishment this was not so. The
water boiled at exactly the same temperature as on the preceding
day. I tried it several times, to convince myself that there was
nothing wrong, each time with the same result. There was great
rejoicing among us all when I was able to announce that we had
arrived on the top of the plateau.</p>
<p>December 7 began like the 6th, with absolutely thick weather,
but, as they say, you never know what the day is like before
sunset. Possibly I might have chosen a better expression than
this last&mdash;one more in agreement with the natural
conditions&mdash;but I will let it stand. Though for several
weeks now the sun had not set, my readers will not be so critical
as to reproach me with inaccuracy. With a light wind from the
north-east, we now went southward at a good speed over the
perfectly level plain, with excellent going. The uphill work had
taken it out of our dogs, though not to any serious extent. They
had turned greedy&mdash;there is no denying that&mdash;and the
half kilo of pemmican they got each day was not enough to fill
their stomachs. Early and late they were looking for
something&mdash;no matter what&mdash;to devour. To begin with
they contented themselves with such loose objects as
ski-bindings, whips, boots, and the like; but as we came to know
their proclivities, we took such care of everything that they
found no extra meals lying about. But that was not the end of the
matter. They then went for the fixed lashings of the sledges,
and&mdash;if we had allowed it&mdash;would very quickly have
resolved the various sledges into their component parts. But we
found a way of stopping that: every evening, on halting, the
sledges were buried in the snow, so as to hide all the lashings.
That was successful; curiously enough, they never tried to force
the "snow rampart."</p>
<p>I may mention as a curious thing that these ravenous animals,
that devoured everything they came across, even to the ebonite
points of our ski-sticks, never made any attempt to break into
the provision cases. They lay there and went about among the
sledges with their noses just on a level with the split cases,
seeing and scenting the pemmican, without once making a sign of
taking any. But if one raised a lid, they were not long in
showing themselves. Then they all came in a great hurry and
flocked about the sledges in the hope of getting a little extra
bit. I am at a loss to explain this behaviour; that bashfulness
was not at the root of it, I am tolerably certain.</p>
<p>During the forenoon the thick, grey curtain of cloud began to
grow thinner on the horizon, and for the first time for three
days we could see a few miles about us. The feeling was something
like that one has on waking from a good nap, rubbing one's eyes
and looking around. We had become so accustomed to the grey
twilight that this positively dazzled us. Meanwhile, the upper
layer of air seemed obstinately to remain the same and to be
doing its best to prevent the sun from showing itself. We badly
wanted to get a meridian altitude, so that we could determine our
latitude. Since 86&deg; 47' S. we had had no observation, and it
was not easy to say when we should get one. Hitherto, the weather
conditions on the high ground had not been particularly
favourable. Although the prospects were not very promising, we
halted at 11 a.m. and made ready to catch the sun if it should be
kind enough to look out. Hassel and Wisting used one sextant and
artificial horizon, Hanssen and I the other set.</p>
<p>I don't know that I have ever stood and absolutely pulled at
the sun to get it out as I did that time. If we got an
observation here which agreed with our reckoning, then it would
be possible, if the worst came to the worst, to go to the Pole on
dead reckoning; but if we got none now, it was a question whether
our claim to the Pole would be admitted on the dead reckoning we
should be able to produce. Whether my pulling helped or not, it
is certain that the sun appeared. It was not very brilliant to
begin with, but, practised as we now were in availing ourselves
of even the poorest chances, it was good enough. Down it came,
was checked by all, and the altitude written down. The curtain of
cloud was rent more and more, and before we had finished our
work&mdash;that is to say, caught the sun at its highest, and
convinced ourselves that it was descending again&mdash;it was
shining in all its glory. We had put away our instruments and
were sitting on the sledges, engaged in the calculations. I can
safely say that we were excited. What would the result be, after
marching blindly for so long and over such impossible ground, as
we had been doing? We added and subtracted, and at last there was
the result. We looked at each other in sheer incredulity: the
result was as astonishing as the most consummate conjuring
trick&mdash;88&deg; 16' S., precisely to a minute the same as our
reckoning, 88&deg; 16' S. If we were forced to go to the Pole on
dead reckoning, then surely the most exacting would admit our
right to do so. We put away our observation books, ate one or two
biscuits, and went at it again.</p>

<br>
<small>TAKING AN OBSERVATION AT THE POLE.</small></p>
<br>
<p>We had a great piece of work before us that day nothing less
than carrying our flag farther south than the foot of man had
trod. We had our silk flag ready; it was made fast to two
ski-sticks and laid on Hanssen's sledge. I had given him orders
that as soon as we had covered the distance to 88&deg;S., which
was Shackleton's farthest south, the flag was to be hoisted on
his sledge. It was my turn as forerunner, and I pushed on. There
was no longer any difficulty in holding one's course; I had the
grandest cloud-formations to steer by, and everything now went
like a machine. First came the forerunner for the time being,
then Hanssen, then Wisting, and finally Bjaaland. The forerunner
who was not on duty went where he liked; as a rule he accompanied
one or other of the sledges. I had long ago fallen into a
reverie&mdash;far removed from the scene in which I was moving;
what I thought about I do not remember now, but I was so
preoccupied that I had entirely forgotten my surroundings. Then
suddenly I was roused from my dreaming by a jubilant shout,
followed by ringing cheers. I turned round quickly to discover
the reason of this unwonted occurrence, and stood speechless and
overcome.</p>
<p>I find it impossible to express the feelings that possessed me
at this moment. All the sledges had stopped, and from the
foremost of them the Norwegian flag was flying. It shook itself
out, waved and flapped so that the silk rustled; it looked
wonderfully well in the pure, clear air and the shining white
surroundings. 88&deg; 23' was past; we were farther south than
any human being had been. No other moment of the whole trip
affected me like this. The tears forced their way to my eyes; by
no effort of will could I keep them back. It was the flag yonder
that conquered me and my will. Luckily I was some way in advance
of the others, so that I had time to pull myself together and
master my feelings before reaching my comrades. We all shook
hands, with mutual congratulations; we had won our way far by
holding together, and we would go farther yet&mdash;to the
end.</p>
<p>We did not pass that spot without according our highest
tribute of admiration to the man, who&mdash;together with his
gallant companions&mdash;had planted his country's flag so
infinitely nearer to the goal than any of his precursors. Sir
Ernest Shackleton's name will always be written in the annals of
Antarctic exploration in letters of fire. Pluck and grit can work
wonders, and I know of no better example of this than what that
man has accomplished.</p>
<p>The cameras of course had to come out, and we got an excellent
photograph of the scene which none of us will ever forget. We
went on a couple of miles more, to 88&deg; 25', and then camped.
The weather had improved, and kept on improving all the time. It
was now almost perfectly calm, radiantly clear, and, under the
circumstances, quite summer-like: -0.4&deg; F. Inside the tent it
was quite sultry. This was more than we had expected.</p>
<p>After much consideration and discussion we had come to the
conclusion that we ought to lay down a depot&mdash;the last
one&mdash;at this spot. The advantages of lightening our sledges
were so great that we should have to risk it. Nor would there be
any great risk attached to it, after all, since we should adopt a
system of marks that would lead even a blind man back to the
place. We had determined to mark it not only at right angles to
our course&mdash;that is, from east to west&mdash;but by snow
beacons at every two geographical miles to the south.</p>
<p>We stayed here on the following day to arrange this depot.
Hanssen's dogs were real marvels, all of them; nothing seemed to
have any effect on them. They had grown rather thinner, of
course, but they were still as strong as ever. It was therefore
decided not to lighten Hanssen's sledge, but only the two others;
both Wisting's and Bjaaland's teams had suffered, especially the
latter's. The reduction in weight that was effected was
considerable&mdash;nearly 110 pounds on each of the two sledges;
there was thus about 220 pounds in the depot. The snow here was
ill-adapted for building, but we put up quite a respectable
monument all the same. It was dogs' pemmican and biscuits that
were left behind; we carried with us on the sledges provisions
for about a month. If, therefore, contrary to expectation, we
should be so unlucky as to miss this depot, we should
nevertheless be fairly sure of reaching our depot in 86&deg; 21'
before supplies ran short. The cross-marking of the depot was
done with sixty splinters of black packing-case on each side,
with 100 paces between each. Every other one had a shred of black
cloth on the top. The splinters on the east side were all marked,
so that on seeing them we should know instantly that we were to
the east of the depot. Those on the west had no marks.</p>
<p>The warmth of the past few days seemed to have matured our
frost-sores, and we presented an awful appearance. It was
Wisting, Hanssen, and I who had suffered the worst damage in the
last south-east blizzard; the left side of our faces was one mass
of sore, bathed in matter and serum. We looked like the worst
type of tramps and ruffians, and would probably not have been
recognized by our nearest relations. These sores were a great
trouble to us during the latter part of the journey. The
slightest gust of wind produced a sensation as if one's face were
being cut backwards and forwards with a blunt knife. They lasted
a long time, too; I can remember Hanssen removing the last scab
when we were coming into Hobart&mdash;three months later. We were
very lucky in the weather during this depot work; the sun came
out all at once, and we had an excellent opportunity of taking
some good azimuth observations, the last of any use that we got
on the journey.</p>
<p>December 9 arrived with the same fine weather and sunshine.
True, we felt our frost-sores rather sharply that day, with
-18.4&deg; F. and a little breeze dead against us, but that could
not be helped. We at once began to put up beacons&mdash;a work
which was continued with great regularity right up to the Pole.
These beacons were not so big as those we had built down on the
Barrier; we could see that they would be quite large enough with
a height of about 3 feet, as it was, very easy to see the
slightest irregularity on this perfectly flat surface. While thus
engaged we had an opportunity of becoming thoroughly acquainted
with the nature of the snow. Often&mdash;very often
indeed&mdash;on this part of the plateau, to the south of 88&deg;
25', we had difficulty in getting snow good enough&mdash;that is,
solid enough for cutting blocks. The snow up here seemed to have
fallen very quietly, in light breezes or calms. We could thrust
the tent-pole, which was 6 feet long, right down without meeting
resistance, which showed that there was no hard layer of snow.
The surface was also perfectly level; there was not a sign of
<i>sastrugi</i> in any direction.</p>
<p>Every step we now took in advance brought us rapidly nearer
the goal; we could feel fairly certain of reaching it on the
afternoon of the 14th. It was very natural that our conversation
should be chiefly concerned with the time of arrival. None of us
would admit that he was nervous, but I am inclined to think that
we all had a little touch of that malady. What should we see when
we got there? A vast, endless plain, that no eye had yet seen and
no foot yet trodden; or&mdash;&mdash;No, it was an impossibility;
with the speed at which we had travelled, we must reach the goal
first, there could be no doubt about that. And yet&mdash;and
yet&mdash;&mdash;Wherever there is the smallest loophole, doubt
creeps in and gnaws and gnaws and never leaves a poor wretch in
peace. "What on earth is Uroa scenting?" It was Bjaaland who made
this remark, on one of these last days, when I was going by the
side of his sledge and talking to him. "And the strange thing is
that he's scenting to the south. It can never be&mdash;&mdash;"
Mylius, Ring, and Suggen, showed the same interest in the
southerly direction; it was quite extraordinary to see how they
raised their heads, with every sign of curiosity, put their noses
in the air, and sniffed due south. One would really have thought
there was something remarkable to be found there.</p>
<p>From 88&deg; 25' S. the barometer and hypsometer indicated
slowly but surely that the plateau was beginning to descend
towards the other side. This was a pleasant surprise to us; we
had thus not only found the very summit of the plateau, but also
the slope down on the far side. This would have a very important
bearing for obtaining an idea of the construction of the whole
plateau. On December 9 observations and dead reckoning agreed
within a mile. The same result again on the 10th: observation 2
kilometres behind reckoning. The weather and going remained about
the same as on the preceding days: light south-easterly breeze,
temperature -18.4&deg; F. The snow surface was loose, but ski and
sledges glided over it well. On the 11th, the same weather
conditions. Temperature -13&deg; F. Observation and reckoning
again agreed exactly. Our latitude was 89&deg; 15' S. On the 12th
we reached 89&deg; 30', reckoning 1 kilometre behind observation.
Going and surface as good as ever. Weather splendid&mdash;calm
with sunshine. The noon observation on the 13th gave 89&deg; 37'
S. Reckoning 89&deg; 38.5' S. We halted in the afternoon, after
going eight geographical miles, and camped in 89&deg; 45',
according to reckoning.</p>
<p>The weather during the forenoon had been just as fine as
before; in the afternoon we had some snow-showers from the
south-east. It was like the eve of some great festival that night
in the tent. One could feel that a great event was at hand. Our
flag was taken out again and lashed to the same two ski-sticks as
before. Then it was rolled up and laid aside, to be ready when
the time came. I was awake several times during the night, and
had the same feeling that I can remember as a little boy on the
night before Christmas Eve&mdash;an intense expectation of what
was going to happen. Otherwise I think we slept just as well that
night as any other.</p>
<p>On the morning of December 14 the weather was of the finest,
just as if it had been made for arriving at the Pole. I am not
quite sure, but I believe we despatched our breakfast rather more
quickly than usual and were out of the tent sooner, though I must
admit that we always accomplished this with all reasonable haste.
We went in the usual order&mdash;the forerunner, Hanssen,
Wisting, Bjaaland, and the reserve forerunner. By noon we had
reached 89&deg; 53' by dead reckoning, and made ready to take the
rest in one stage. At 10 a.m. a light breeze had sprung up from
the south-east, and it had clouded over, so that we got no noon
altitude; but the clouds were not thick, and from time to time we
had a glimpse of the sun through them. The going on that day was
rather different from what it had been; sometimes the ski went
over it well, but at others it was pretty bad. We advanced that
day in the same mechanical way as before; not much was said, but
eyes were used all the more. Hanssen's neck grew twice as long as
before in his endeavour to see a few inches farther. I had asked
him before we started to spy out ahead for all he was worth, and
he did so with a vengeance. But, however keenly he stared, he
could not descry anything but the endless flat plain ahead of us.
The dogs had dropped their scenting, and appeared to have lost
their interest in the regions about the earth's axis.</p>

<small>CHART OF THE IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS OF THE SOUTH
POLE.</small></p>
<br>
<p>At three in the afternoon a simultaneous "Halt!" rang out from
the drivers. They had carefully examined their sledge-meters, and
they all showed the full distance&mdash;our Pole by reckoning.
The goal was reached, the journey ended. I cannot
say&mdash;though I know it would sound much more
effective&mdash;that the object of my life was attained. That
would be romancing rather too bare-facedly. I had better be
honest and admit straight out that I have never known any man to
be placed in such a diametrically opposite position to the goal
of his desires as I was at that moment. The regions around the
North Pole&mdash;well, yes, the North Pole itself&mdash;had
attracted me from childhood, and here I was at the South Pole.
Can anything more topsy-turvy be imagined?</p>
<p>We reckoned now that we were at the Pole. Of course, every one
of us knew that we were not standing on the absolute spot; it
would be an impossibility with the time and the instruments at
our disposal to ascertain that exact spot. But we were so near it
that the few miles which possibly separated us from it could not
be of the slightest importance. It was our intention to make a
circle round this camp, with a radius of twelve and a half miles
(20 kilometres), and to be satisfied with that. After we had
halted we collected and congratulated each other. We had good
grounds for mutual respect in what had been achieved, and I think
that was just the feeling that was expressed in the firm and
powerful grasps of the fist that were exchanged. After this we
proceeded to the greatest and most solemn act of the whole
journey&mdash;the planting of our flag. Pride and affection shone
in the five pairs of eyes that gazed upon the flag, as it
unfurled itself with a sharp crack, and waved over the Pole. I
had determined that the act of planting it&mdash;the historic
event&mdash;should be equally divided among us all. It was not
for one man to do this; it was for all who had staked their lives
in the struggle, and held together through thick and thin. This
was the only way in which I could show my gratitude to my
comrades in this desolate spot. I could see that they understood
and accepted it in the spirit in which it was offered. Five
weather-beaten, frost-bitten fists they were that grasped the
pole, raised the waving flag in the air, and planted it as the
first at the geographical South Pole. "Thus we plant thee,
beloved flag, at the South Pole, and give to the plain on which
it lies the name of King Haakon VII.'s Plateau." That moment will
certainly be remembered by all of us who stood there.</p>
<p>One gets out of the way of protracted ceremonies in those
regions&mdash;the shorter they are the better. Everyday life
began again at once. When we had got the tent up, Hanssen set
about slaughtering Helge, and it was hard for him to have to part
from his best friend. Helge had been an uncommonly useful and
good-natured dog; without making any fuss he had pulled from
morning to night, and had been a shining example to the team. But
during the last week he had quite fallen away, and on our arrival
at the Pole there was only a shadow of the old Helge left. He was
only a drag on the others, and did absolutely no work. One blow
on the skull, and Helge had ceased to live. "What is death to one
is food to another," is a saying that can scarcely find a better
application than these dog meals. Helge was portioned out on the
spot, and within a couple of hours there was nothing left of him
but his teeth and the tuft at the end of his tail. This was the
second of our eighteen dogs that we had lost. The Major, one of
Wisting's fine dogs, left us in 88&deg; 25' S., and never
returned. He was fearfully worn out, and must have gone away to
die. We now had sixteen dogs left, and these we intended to
divide into two equal teams, leaving Bjaaland's sledge
behind.</p>
<p>Of course, there was a festivity in the tent that
evening&mdash;not that champagne corks were popping and wine
flowing&mdash;no, we contented ourselves with a little piece of
seal meat each, and it tasted well and did us good. There was no
other sign of festival indoors. Outside we heard the flag
flapping in the breeze. Conversation was lively in the tent that
evening, and we talked of many things. Perhaps, too, our thoughts
sent messages home of what we had done.</p>
<p>Everything we had with us had now to be marked with the words
"South Pole" and the date, to serve afterwards as souvenirs.
Wisting proved to be a first-class engraver, and many were the
articles he had to mark. Tobacco&mdash;in the form of
smoke&mdash;had hitherto never made its appearance in the tent.
From time to time I had seen one or two of the others take a
quid, but now these things were to be altered. I had brought with
me an old briar pipe, which bore inscriptions from many places in
the Arctic regions, and now I wanted it marked "South Pole." When
I produced my pipe and was about to mark it, I received an
unexpected gift Wisting offered me tobacco for the rest of the
journey. He had some cakes of plug in his kit-bag, which he would
prefer to see me smoke. Can anyone grasp what such an offer meant
at such a spot, made to a man who, to tell the truth, is very
fond of a smoke after meals? There are not many who can
understand it fully. I accepted the offer, jumping with joy, and
on the way home I had a pipe of fresh, fine-cut plug every
evening. Ah! that Wisting, he spoiled me entirely. Not only did
he give me tobacco, but every evening&mdash;and I must confess I
yielded to the temptation after a while, and had a morning smoke
as well&mdash;he undertook the disagreeable work of cutting the
plug and filling my pipe in all kinds of weather.</p>
<p>But we did not let our talk make us forget other things. As we
had got no noon altitude, we should have to try and take one at
midnight. The weather had brightened again, and it looked as if
midnight would be a good time for the observation. We therefore
crept into our bags to get a little nap in the intervening hours.
In good time&mdash;soon after 11 p.m.&mdash;we were out again,
and ready to catch the sun; the weather was of the best, and the
opportunity excellent. We four navigators all had a share in it,
as usual, and stood watching the course of the sun. This was a
labour of patience, as the difference of altitude was now very
slight. The result at which we finally arrived was of great
interest, as it clearly shows how unreliable and valueless a
single observation like this is in these regions. At 12.30 a.m.
we put our instruments away, well satisfied with our work, and
quite convinced that it was the midnight altitude that we had
observed. The calculations which were carried out immediately
afterwards gave us 89&deg; 56' S. We were all well pleased with
this result.</p>
<p>The arrangement now was that we should encircle this camp with
a radius of about twelve and a half miles. By encircling I do
not, of course, mean that we should go round in a circle with
this radius; that would have taken us days, and was not to be
thought of. The encircling was accomplished in this way: Three
men went out in three different directions, two at right angles
to the course we had been steering, and one in continuation of
that course. To carry out this work I had chosen Wisting, Hassel,
and Bjaaland. Having concluded our observations, we put the
kettle on to give ourselves a drop of chocolate; the pleasure of
standing out there in rather light attire had not exactly put
warmth into our bodies. As we were engaged in swallowing the
scalding drink, Bjaaland suddenly observed: "I'd like to tackle
this encircling straight away. We shall have lots of time to
sleep when we get back." Hassel and Wisting were quite of the
same opinion, and it was agreed that they should start the work
immediately. Here we have yet another example of the good spirit
that prevailed in our little community. We had only lately come
in from our day's work&mdash;a march of about eighteen and a half
miles&mdash;and now they were asking to be allowed to go on
another twenty-five miles. It seemed as if these fellows could
never be tired. We therefore turned this meal into a little
breakfast&mdash;that is to say, each man ate what he wanted of
his bread ration, and then they began to get ready for the work.
First, three small bags of light windproof stuff were made, and
in each of these was placed a paper, giving the position of our
camp. In addition, each of them carried a large square flag of
the same dark brown material, which could be easily seen at a
distance. As flag-poles we elected to use our spare
sledge-runners, which were both long&mdash;12 feet&mdash;and
strong, and which we were going to take off here in any case, to
lighten the sledges as much as possible for the return
journey.</p>
<p>Thus equipped, and with thirty biscuits as an extra ration,
the three men started off in the directions laid down. Their
march was by no means free from danger, and does great honour to
those who undertook it, not merely without raising the smallest
objection, but with the greatest keenness. Let us consider for a
moment the risk they ran. Our tent on the boundless plain,
without marks of any kind, may very well be compared with a
needle in a haystack. From this the three men were to steer out
for a distance of twelve and a half miles. Compasses would have
been good things to take on such a walk, but our sledge-compasses
were too heavy and unsuitable for carrying. They therefore had to
go without. They had the sun to go by, certainly, when they
started, but who could say how long it would last? The weather
was then fine enough, but it was impossible to guarantee that no
sudden change would take place. If by bad luck the sun should be
hidden, then their own tracks might help them. But to trust to
tracks in these regions is a dangerous thing. Before you know
where you are the whole plain may be one mass of driving snow,
obliterating all tracks as soon as they are made. With the rapid
changes of weather we had so often experienced, such a thing was
not impossible. That these three risked their lives that morning,
when they left the tent at 2.30, there can be no doubt at all,
and they all three knew it very well. But if anyone thinks that
on this account they took a solemn farewell of us who stayed
behind, he is much mistaken. Not a bit; they all vanished in
their different directions amid laughter and chaff.</p>
<p>The first thing we did&mdash;Hanssen and I&mdash;was to set
about arranging a lot of trifling matters; there was something to
be done here, something there, and above all we had to be ready
for the series of observations we were to carry out together, so
as to get as accurate a determination of our position as
possible. The first observation told us at once how necessary
this was. For it turned out that this, instead of giving us a
greater altitude than the midnight observation, gave us a smaller
one, and it was then clear that we had gone out of the meridian
we thought we were following. Now the first thing to be done was
to get our north and south line and latitude determined, so that
we could find our position once more. Luckily for us, the weather
looked as if it would hold. We measured the sun's altitude at
every hour from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m., and from these observations
found, with some degree of certainty, our latitude and the
direction of the meridian.</p>
<p>By nine in the morning we began to expect the return of our
comrades; according to our calculation they should then have
covered the distance&mdash;twenty-five miles. It was not till ten
o'clock that Hanssen made out the first black dot on the horizon,
and not long after the second and third appeared. We both gave a
sigh of relief as they came on; almost simultaneously the three
arrived at the tent. We told them the result of our observations
up to that time; it looked as if our camp was in about 89&deg;
54' 30" S., and that with our encircling we had therefore
included the actual Pole. With this result we might very well
have been content, but as the weather was so good and gave the
impression that it would continue so, and our store of provisions
proved on examination to be very ample, we decided to go on for
the remaining ten kilometres (five and a half geographical
miles), and get our position determined as near to the Pole as
possible. Meanwhile the three wanderers turned in&mdash;not so
much because they were tired, as because it was the right thing
to do&mdash;and Hanssen and I continued the series of
observations.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we again went very carefully through our
provision supply before discussing the future. The result was
that we had food enough for ourselves and the dogs for eighteen
days. The surviving sixteen dogs were divided into two teams of
eight each, and the contents of Bjaaland's sledge were shared
between Hanssen's and Wisting's. The abandoned sledge was set
upright in the snow, and proved to be a splendid mark. The
sledge-meter was screwed to the sledge, and we left it there; our
other two were quite sufficient for the return journey; they had
all shown themselves very accurate. A couple of empty provision
cases were also left behind. I wrote in pencil on a piece of case
the information that our tent&mdash;"Polheim"&mdash;would be
found five and a half geographical miles north-west quarter west
by compass from the sledge. Having put all these things in order
the same day, we turned in, very well satisfied.</p>
<p>Early next morning, December 16, we were on our feet again.
Bjaaland, who had now left the company of the drivers and been
received with jubilation into that of the forerunners, was
immediately entrusted with the honourable task of leading the
expedition forward to the Pole itself. I assigned this duty,
which we all regarded as a distinction, to him as a mark of
gratitude to the gallant Telemarkers for their pre-eminent work
in the advancement of ski sport. The leader that day had to keep
as straight as a line, and if possible to follow the direction of
our meridian. A little way after Bjaaland came Hassel, then
Hanssen, then Wisting, and I followed a good way behind. I could
thus check the direction of the march very accurately, and see
that no great deviation was made. Bjaaland on this occasion
showed himself a matchless forerunner; he went perfectly straight
the whole time. Not once did he incline to one side or the other,
and when we arrived at the end of the distance, we could still
clearly see the sledge we had set up and take its bearing. This
showed it to be absolutely in the right direction.</p>

<small>A PAGE FROM THE OBSERVATION BOOK, DECEMBER 17,
1911.</small></p>
<br>
<p>It was 11 a.m. when we reached our destination. While some of
us were putting up the tent, others began to get everything ready
for the coming observations. A solid snow pedestal was put up, on
which the artificial horizon was to be placed, and a smaller one
to rest the sextant on when it was not in use. At 11.30 a.m. the
first observation was taken. We divided ourselves into two
parties&mdash;Hanssen and I in one, Hassel and Wisting in the
other. While one party slept, the other took the observations,
and the watches were of six hours each. The weather was
altogether grand, though the sky was not perfectly bright the
whole time. A very light, fine, vaporous curtain would spread
across the sky from time to time, and then quickly disappear
again. This film of cloud was not thick enough to hide the sun,
which we could see the whole time, but the atmosphere seemed to
be disturbed. The effect of this was that the sun appeared not to
change its altitude for several hours, until it suddenly made a
jump.</p>
<p>Observations were now taken every hour through the whole
twenty-four. It was very strange to turn in at 6 p.m., and then
on turning out again at midnight to find the sun apparently still
at the same altitude, and then once more at 6 a.m. to see it
still no higher. The altitude had changed, of course, but so
slightly that it was imperceptible with the naked eye. To us it
appeared as though the sun made the circuit of the heavens at
exactly the same altitude. The times of day that I have given
here are calculated according to the meridian of Framheim; we
continued to reckon our time from this. The observations soon
told us that we were not on the absolute Pole, but as close to it
as we could hope to get with our instruments. The observations,
which have been submitted to Mr. Anton Alexander, will be
published, and the result given later in this book.</p>
<p>On December 17 at noon we had completed our observations, and
it is certain that we had done all that could be done. In order
if possible to come a few inches nearer to the actual Pole,
Hanssen and Bjaaland went out four geographical miles (seven
kilometres) in the direction of the newly found meridian.</p>
<p>Bjaaland astonished me at dinner that day. Speeches had not
hitherto been a feature of this journey, but now Bjaaland
evidently thought the time had come, and surprised us all with a
really fine oration. My amazement reached its culmination when,
at the conclusion of his speech, he produced a cigar-case full of
cigars and offered it round. A cigar at the Pole! What do you say
to that? But it did not end there. When the cigars had gone
round, there were still four left. I was quite touched when he
handed the case and cigars to me with the words: "Keep this to
remind you of the Pole." I have taken good care of the case, and
shall preserve it as one of the many happy signs of my comrades'
devotion on this journey. The cigars I shared out afterwards, on
Christmas Eve, and they gave us a visible mark of that
occasion.</p>
<p>When this festival dinner at the Pole was ended, we began our
preparations for departure. First we set up the little tent we
had brought with us in case we should be compelled to divide into
two parties. It had been made by our able sailmaker, R&ouml;nne,
and was of very thin windproof gabardine. Its drab colour made it
easily visible against the white surface. Another pole was lashed
to the tent-pole, making its total height about 13 feet. On the
top of this a little Norwegian flag was lashed fast, and
underneath it a pennant, on which "Fram" was painted. The tent
was well secured with guy-ropes on all sides. Inside the tent, in
a little bag, I left a letter, addressed to H.M. the King, giving
information of what we had accomplished. The way home was a long
one, and so many things might happen to make it impossible for us
to give an account of our expedition. Besides this letter, I
wrote a short epistle to Captain Scott, who, I assumed, would be
the first to find the tent. Other things we left there were a
sextant with a glass horizon, a hypsometer case, three
reindeer-skin foot-bags, some kamiks and mits.</p>
<p>When everything had been laid inside, we went into the tent,
one by one, to write our names on a tablet we had fastened to the
tent-pole. On this occasion we received the congratulations of
our companions on the successful result, for the following
messages were written on a couple of strips of leather, sewed to
the tent: "Good luck," and "Welcome to 90&deg;." These good
wishes, which we suddenly discovered, put us in very good
spirits. They were signed by Beck and R&ouml;nne. They had good
faith in us. When we had finished this we came out, and the
tent-door was securely laced together, so that there was no
danger of the wind getting a hold on that side.</p>
<p>And so good-bye to Polheim. It was a solemn moment when we
bared our heads and bade farewell to our home and our flag. And
then the travelling tent was taken down and the sledges packed.
Now the homeward journey was to begin&mdash;homeward, step by
step, mile after mile, until the whole distance was accomplished.
We drove at once into our old tracks and followed them. Many were
the times we turned to send a last look to Polheim. The vaporous,
white air set in again, and it was not long before the last of
Polheim, our little flag, disappeared from view.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII<br>
<br>
<small>THE RETURN TO FRAMHEIM</small></h3>
<p><small>THE</small> going was splendid and all were in good
spirits, so we went along at a great pace. One would almost have
thought the dogs knew they were homeward bound. A mild,
summer-like wind, with a temperature of -2.2&deg; F., was our
last greeting from the Pole.</p>
<p>When we came to our last camp, where the sledge was left, we
stopped and took a few things with us. From this point we came
into the line of beacons. Our tracks had already become very
indistinct, but, thanks to his excellent sight, Bjaaland kept in
them quite well. The beacons, however, served their purpose so
satisfactorily that the tracks were almost superfluous. Although
these beacons were not more than about 3 feet high, they were
extremely conspicuous on the level surface. When the sun was on
them, they shone like electric lighthouses; and when the sun was
on the other side, they looked so dark in the shadow that one
would have taken them for black rocks. We intended in future to
travel at night; the advantages of this were many and great. In
the first place, we should have the sun behind us, which meant a
good deal to our eyes. Going against the sun on a snow surface
like this tells fearfully on the eyes, even if one has good
snow-goggles; but with the sun at one's back it is only play.
Another great advantage&mdash;which we did not reap till
later&mdash;was that it gave us the warmest part of the
twenty-four hours in the tent, during which time we had an
opportunity of drying wet clothes, and so on. This last advantage
was, however, a doubtful one, as we shall see in due course.</p>
<p>It was a great comfort to turn our backs to the south. The
wind, which had nearly always been in this quarter, had often
been very painful to our cracked faces; now we should always have
it at our backs, and it would help us on our way, besides giving
our faces time to heal. Another thing we were longing for was to
come down to the Barrier again, so that we could breathe freely.
Up here we were seldom able to draw a good long breath; if we
only had to say "Yes," we had to do it in two instalments. The
asthmatic condition in which we found ourselves during our six
weeks' stay on the plateau was anything but pleasant. We had
fixed fifteen geographical miles (seventeen and three-eighths
statute miles) as a suitable day's march on the homeward journey.
We had, of course, many advantages now as compared with the
southward journey, which would have enabled us to do longer
marches than this; but we were afraid of overworking the dogs,
and possibly using them up before we had gone very far, if we
attempted too great a distance daily. It soon proved, however,
that we had underestimated our dogs' powers; it only took us five
hours to cover the appointed distance, and our rest was therefore
a long one.</p>
<p>On December 19 we killed the first dog on the homeward trip.
This was Lasse, my own favourite dog. He had worn himself out
completely, and was no longer worth anything. He was divided into
fifteen portions, as nearly equal as possible, and given to his
companions. They had now learnt to set great store by fresh meat,
and it is certain that the extra feeds, like this one, that took
place from time to time on the way home, had no small share in
the remarkably successful result. They seemed to benefit by these
meals of fresh meat for several days afterwards, and worked much
more easily.</p>
<p>December 20 began with bitter weather, a breeze from the
south-east, grey and thick. We lost the trail, and for some time
had to go by compass. But as usual it suddenly cleared, and once
more the plain lay before us, light and warm. Yes, too warm it
was. We had to take off everything&mdash;nearly&mdash;and still
the sweat poured off us. It was not for long that we were
uncertain of the way: our excellent beacons did us brilliant
service, and one after another they came up on the horizon,
flashed and shone, and drew us on to our all-important depot in
88&deg; 25' S. We were now going slightly uphill, but so slightly
that it was unnoticeable. The hypsometer and barometer, however,
were not to be deceived, and both fell in precisely the same
degree as they had risen before. Even if we had not exactly
noticed the rise, the feeling of it was present. It may perhaps
be called imagination, but I certainly thought I could notice the
rise by my breathing.</p>
<p>Our appetite had increased alarmingly during the last few
days. It appeared that we ski-runners evinced a far greater
voracity than the drivers. There were days&mdash;only a few days,
be it said&mdash;when I believe any of us three&mdash;Bjaaland,
Hassel, and myself&mdash;would have swallowed pebbles without
winking. The drivers never showed such signs of starvation. It
has occurred to me that this may possibly have been due to their
being able to lean on the sledges as they went along, and thus
have a rest and support which we had to do without. It seems
little enough simply to rest one's hand on a sledge on the march,
but in the long run, day after day, it may perhaps make itself
felt. Fortunately we were so well supplied that when this
sensation of hunger came over us, we could increase our daily
rations. On leaving the Pole we added to our pemmican ration,
with the result that our wild-beast appetites soon gave way and
shrank to an ordinary good, everyday twist. Our daily programme
on entering upon the return journey was so arranged that we began
to get breakfast ready at 6 p.m., and by 8 p.m. we were usually
quite ready to start the day's march. An hour or so after
midnight the fifteen geographical miles were accomplished, and we
could once more put up our tent, cook our food, and seek our
rest. But this rest soon became so insufferably long. And then
there was the fearful heat&mdash;considering the
circumstances&mdash;which often made us get out of our
sleeping-bags and lie with nothing over us. These rests of
twelve, fourteen, sometimes as much as sixteen hours, were what
most tried our patience during the early part of the return
journey. We could see so well that all this rest was unnecessary,
but still we kept it up as long as we were on the high ground.
Our conversation at this time used to turn very often on the best
way of filling up these long, unnecessary waits.</p>
<p>That day&mdash;December 20&mdash;Per&mdash;good, faithful,
conscientious Per&mdash;broke down utterly and had to be taken on
the sledge the last part of the way. On arrival at the
camping-ground he had his reward. A little blow of the back of
the axe was enough for him; without making a sound the worn-out
animal collapsed. In him Wisting lost one of his best dogs. He
was a curious animal&mdash;always went about quietly and
peaceably, and never took part in the others' battles; from his
looks and behaviour one would have judged him, quite mistakenly,
to be a queer sort of beast who was good for nothing. But when he
was in harness he showed what he could do. Without needing any
shouts or cuts of the whip, he put himself into it from morning
to night, and was priceless as a draught dog. But, like others of
the same character, he could not keep it going any longer; he
collapsed, was killed and eaten.</p>
<p>Christmas Eve was rapidly approaching. For us it could not be
particularly festive, but we should have to try to make as much
of it as circumstances would permit. We ought, therefore, to
reach our depot that evening, so as to keep Christmas with a dish
of porridge. The night before Christmas Eve we slaughtered
Svartflekken. There was no mourning on this occasion Svartflekken
was one of Hassel's dogs, and had always been a reprobate. I find
the following in my diary, written the same evening: "Slaughtered
Svartflekken this evening. He would not do any more, although
there was not much wrong with his looks. Bad character. If a man,
he would have ended in penal servitude." He was comparatively
fat, and was consumed with evident satisfaction.</p>
<p>Christmas Eve came; the weather was rather
changeable&mdash;now overcast, now clear&mdash;when we set out at
8 p.m. the night before. We had not far to go before reaching our
depot. At 12 midnight we arrived there in the most glorious
weather, calm and warm. Now we had the whole of Christmas Eve
before us, and could enjoy it at our ease. Our depot was at once
taken down and divided between the two sledges. All crumbs of
biscuit were carefully collected by Wisting, the cook for the
day, and put into a bag. This was taken into the tent and
vigorously beaten and kneaded; the result was pulverized biscuit.
With this product and a sausage of dried milk, Wisting succeeded
in making a capital dish of Christmas porridge. I doubt whether
anyone at home enjoyed his Christmas dinner so much as we did
that morning in the tent. One of Bjaaland's cigars to follow
brought a festival spirit over the whole camp.</p>
<p>Another thing we had to rejoice about that day was that we had
again reached the summit of the plateau, and after two or three
more days' march would begin to go downhill, finally reaching the
Barrier and our old haunts. Our daily march had hitherto been
interrupted by one or two halts; we stopped to rest both the dogs
and ourselves. On Christmas Eve we instituted a new order of
things, and did the whole distance&mdash;fifteen geographical
miles&mdash;without a stop. We liked this arrangement best, after
all, and it seemed as if the dogs did the same. As a rule it was
hard to begin the march again after the rest; one got rather
stiff lazy, too, perhaps&mdash;and had to become supple
again.</p>
<p>On the 26th we passed 88&deg; S., going well. The surface
appeared to have been exposed to powerful sunshine since we left
it, as it had become quite polished. Going over these polished
levels was like crossing smooth ice, but with the important
difference that here the dogs had a good foothold. This time we
sighted high land even in 88&deg;, and it had great surprises in
store for us. It was clear that this was the same mighty range
running to the south-east as we had seen before, but this time it
stretched considerably farther to the south. The weather was
radiantly clear, and we could see by the land that the range of
vision was very great. Summit after summit the range extended to
the south-east, until it gradually disappeared; but to judge from
the atmosphere, it was continued beyond our range of vision in
the same direction. That this chain traverses the Antarctic
continent I therefore consider beyond a doubt. Here we had a very
good example of how deceptive the atmosphere is in these regions.
On a day that appeared perfectly clear we had lost sight of the
mountains in 87&deg;, and now we saw them as far as the eye could
reach in 88&deg;. That we were astonished is a mild expression.
We looked and looked, entirely unable to recognize our position;
little did we guess that the huge mountain-mass that stood up so
high and clear on the horizon was Mount Thorvald Nilsen. How
utterly different it had looked in the misty air when we said
good-bye to it. It is amusing to read my diary of this time and
see how persistently we took the bearings of land every day, and
thought it was new. We did not recognize that vast mountain until
Mount Helmer Hanssen began to stick up out of the plain.</p>
<p>On December 28 we left the summit of the plateau, and began
the descent. Although the incline was not perceptible to the
naked eye, its effect could easily be seen in the dogs. Wisting
now used a sail on his sledge, and was thus able to keep up with
Hanssen. If anyone had seen the procession that came marching
over the plateau at that time, he would hardly have thought we
had been out for seventy days at a stretch, for we came at a
swinging pace. We always had the wind at our backs, with sunshine
and warmth the whole time. There was never a thought of using the
whip now; the dogs were bursting with health, and tugged at their
harness to get away. It was a hard time for our worthy
forerunner; he often had to spurt as much as he could to keep
clear of Hanssen's dogs. Wisting in full sail, with his dogs
howling for joy, came close behind. Hassel had his work cut out
to follow, and, indeed, I had the same. The surface was
absolutely polished, and for long stretches at a time we could
push ourselves along with our sticks. The dogs were completely
changed since we had left the Pole; strange as it may sound, it
is nevertheless true that they were putting on flesh day by day,
and getting quite fat. I believe it must have been feeding them
on fresh meat and pemmican together that did this. We were again
able to increase our ration of pemmican from December 28; the
daily ration was 1 pound (450 grams) per man, and we could not
manage more&mdash;at least, I think not.</p>
<p>On December 29 we went downhill more and more, and it was
indeed tough work being a ski-runner. The drivers stood so
jauntily by the side of their sledges, letting themselves be
carried over the plain at a phenomenal pace. The surface
consisted of <i>sastrugi</i>, alternating with smooth stretches
like ice. Heaven help me, how we ski-runners had to struggle to
keep up! It was all very well for Bjaaland; he had flown faster
on even worse ground. But for Hassel and me it was different. I
saw Hassel put out, now an arm; now a leg, and make the most
desperate efforts to keep on his feet. Fortunately I could not
see myself; if I had been able to, I am sure I should have been
in fits of laughter. Early that day Mount Helmer Hanssen
appeared. The ground now went in great undulations&mdash;a thing
we had not noticed in the mist when we were going south. So high
were these undulations that they suddenly hid the view from us.
The first we saw of Mount Hanssen was from the top of one of
these big waves; it then looked like the top of a pressure
hummock that was just sticking up above the surface. At first we
did not understand at all what it was; it was not till the next
day that we really grasped it, when the pointed blocks of ice
covering the top of the mountain came into view. As I have said,
it was only then that we made sure of being on the right course;
all the rest of the land that we saw was so entirely strange to
us. We recognized absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>On the 30th we passed 87&deg; S., and were thus rapidly
nearing the Devil's Ballroom and Glacier. The next day was
brilliantly fine-temperature -2.2&deg; F.&mdash;with a good
breeze right aft. To our great joy, we got sight of the land
around the Butcher's Shop. It was still a long way off, of
course, but was miraged up in the warm, sunny air. We were
extraordinarily lucky on our homeward trip; we escaped the
Devil's Ballroom altogether.</p>
<p>On January 1 we ought, according to our reckoning, to reach
the Devil's Glacier, and this held good. We could see it at a
great distance; huge hummocks and ice-waves towered into the sky.
But what astonished us was that between these disturbances and on
the far side of them, we seemed to see an even, unbroken plain,
entirely unaffected by the broken surface. Mounts Hassel,
Wisting, and Bjaaland, lay as we had left them; they were easy to
recognize when we came a little nearer to them. Now Mount Helmer
Hanssen again towered high into the air; it flashed and sparkled
like diamonds as it lay bathed in the rays of the morning sun. We
assumed that we had come nearer to this range than when we were
going south, and that this was the reason of our finding the
ground so changed. When we were going south, it certainly looked
impassable between us and the mountains; but who could tell?
Perhaps in the middle of all the broken ground that we then saw
there was a good even stretch, and that we had now been lucky
enough to stumble upon it. But it was once more the atmosphere
that deceived us, as we found out on the following day, for
instead of being nearer the range we had come farther out from
it, and this was the reason of our only getting a little strip of
this undesirable glacier.</p>
<p>We had our camp that evening in the middle of a big, filled-up
crevasse. We were a trifle anxious as to what kind of surface we
should find farther on; that these few hummocks and old crevasses
were all the glacier had to offer us this time, was more than we
dared to hope. But the 2nd came, and brought&mdash;thank
God!&mdash;no disappointment. With incredible luck we had slipped
past all those ugly and dangerous places, and now, before we knew
where we were, we found ourselves safe and sound on the plain
below the glacier. The weather was not first-rate when we started
at seven in the evening. It was fairly thick, and we could only
just distinguish the top of Mount Bjaaland. This was bad, as we
were now in the neighbourhood of our depot, and would have liked
clear weather to find out where it lay; but instead of clearing,
as we hoped, it grew thicker and thicker, and when we had gone
about six and three-quarter miles, it was so bad that we thought
it best to stop and wait for a while. We had all the time been
going on the erroneous assumption that we had come too far to the
east-that is, too near the mountains&mdash;and under the
circumstances&mdash;in the short gleams that had come from time
to time&mdash;we had not been able to recognize the ground below
the glacier. According to our idea, we were on the east of the
depot. The bearings, which had been taken in thick air, and were
now to guide us in this heavy mist, gave no result whatever.
There was no depot to be seen.</p>
<p>We had just swallowed the grateful warm pemmican when the sun
suddenly showed itself. I don't think the camp was ever broken
and the sledges packed in such a short time. From the moment we
jumped out of our bags till the sledges were ready, it only took
us fifteen minutes, which is incredibly quick. "What on earth is
that shining over there through the fog?" The question came from
one of the lads. The mist had divided, and was rolling away on
both sides; in the western bank something big and white peeped
through&mdash;along ridge running north and south. Hurrah! it's
Helland Hansen. Can't possibly be anything else. Our only
landmark on the west. We all shouted with joy on meeting this old
acquaintance. But in the direction of the depot the fog hung
thick. We held a brief consultation, and agreed to let it go, to
steer for the Butcher's and put on the pace. We had food enough,
anyhow. No sooner said than done, and we started off. It rapidly
cleared, and then, on our way towards Helland Hansen, we found
out that we had come, not too far to the east, but too far to the
west. But to turn round and begin to search for our depot was not
to our liking. Below Mount Helland Hansen we came up on a fairly
high ridge. We had now gone our fixed distance, and so
halted.</p>
<p>Behind us, in the brightest, clearest weather, lay the
glacier, as we had seen it for the first time on our way to the
south: break after break, crevasse after crevasse. But in among
all this nastiness there ran a white, unbroken line, the very
path we had stood and looked at a few weeks back. And directly
below that white stripe we knew, as sure as anything could be,
that our depot lay. We stood there expressing our annoyance
rather forcibly at the depot having escaped us so easily, and
talking of how jolly it would have been to have picked up all our
depots from the plain we had strewed them over. Dead tired as I
felt that evening, I had not the least desire to go back the
fifteen miles that separated us from it. "If anybody would like
to make the trip, he shall have many thanks." They all wanted to
make it&mdash;all as one man. There was no lack of volunteers in
that company. I chose Hanssen and Bjaaland. They took nearly
everything off the sledge, and went away with it empty.</p>
<p>It was then five in the morning. At three in the afternoon
they came back to the tent, Bjaaland running in front, Hanssen
driving the sedge. That was a notable feat, both for men and
dogs. Hanssen, Bjaaland, and that team had covered about fifty
miles that day, at an average rate of three to three and a half
miles an hour. They had found the depot without much search.
Their greatest difficulty had been in the undulating surface; for
long stretches at a time they were in the hollows between the
waves, which shut in their view entirely. Ridge succeeded ridge,
endlessly. We had taken care that everything was ready for their
return&mdash;above all great quantities of water. Water, water
was the first thing, and generally the last, that was in request.
When their thirst was a little quenched, great interest was shown
in the pemmican. While these two were being well looked after,
the depot they had brought in was divided between the two
sledges, and in a short time all was ready for our departure.
Meanwhile, the weather had been getting finer and finer, and
before us lay the mountains, sharp and clear. We thought we
recognized Fridtjof Nansen and Don Pedro Christophersen, and took
good bearings of them in case the fog should return. With most of
us the ideas of day and night began to get rather mixed. "Six
o'clock," someone would answer, when asked the time. "Yes, in the
morning," remarks the other. "No; what are you talking about?"
answers the first one again; "it's evening, of course." The date
was hopeless; it was a good thing if we remembered the year. Only
when writing in our diaries and observation books did we come
across such things as dates; while at work we had not the
remotest idea of them.</p>
<p>Splendid weather it was when we turned out on the morning of
January 3. We had now agreed to go as it suited us, and take no
notice of day or night; for some time past we had all been sick
of the long hours of rest, and wanted to break them up at any
price. As I have said, the weather could not have been finer
brilliantly clear and a dead calm. The temperature of -2.2&deg;
F. felt altogether like summer in this bright, still air. Before
we began our march all unnecessary clothes were taken off and put
on the sledges. It almost looked as if everything would be
considered superfluous, and the costume in which we finally
started would no doubt have been regarded as somewhat unseemly in
our latitudes. We smiled and congratulated ourselves that at
present no ladies had reached the Antarctic regions, or they
might have objected to our extremely comfortable and serviceable
costume. The high land now stood out still more sharply. It was
very interesting to see in these conditions the country we had
gone through on, the southward trip in the thickest blizzard. We
had then been going along the foot of this immense mountain chain
without a suspicion of how near we were to it, or how colossal it
was. The ground was fortunately quite undisturbed in this part. I
say fortunately, as Heaven knows what would have happened to us
if we had been obliged to cross a crevassed surface in such
weather as we then had. Perhaps we should have managed
it&mdash;perhaps not.</p>
<p>The journey before us was a stiff one, as the Butcher's lay
2,680 feet higher than the place where we were. We had been
expecting to stumble upon one of our beacons before long, but
this did not happen until we had gone twelve and a half miles.
Then one of them suddenly came in sight, and was greeted with
joy. We knew well enough that we were on the right track, but an
old acquaintance like this was very welcome all the same. The sun
had evidently been at work up here while we were in the south, as
some of the beacons were quite bent over, and great icicles told
us clearly enough how powerful the sunshine had been. After a
march of about twenty-five miles we halted at the beacon we had
built right under the hill, where we had been forced to stop by
thick weather on November 25.</p>
<p>January 4 was one of the days to which we looked forward with
anxiety, as we were then due at our depot at the Butcher's, and
had to find it. This depot, which consisted of the finest, fresh
dogs' flesh, was of immense importance to us. Not only had our
animals got into the way of preferring this food to pemmican,
but, what was of still greater importance, it had an extremely
good effect on the dogs' state of health. No doubt our pemmican
was good enough&mdash;indeed, it could not have been
better&mdash;but a variation of diet is a great consideration,
and seems, according to my experience, to mean even more to the
dogs than to the men on a long journey like this. On former
occasions I have seen dogs refuse pemmican, presumably because
they were tired of it, having no variety; the result was that the
dogs grew thin and weak, although we had food enough. The
pemmican I am referring to on that occasion was made for human
use, so that their distaste cannot have been due to the
quality.</p>
<p>It was 1.15 a.m. when we set out. We had not had a long sleep,
but it was very important to avail ourselves of this fine, clear
weather while it lasted; we knew by experience that up here in
the neighbourhood of the Butcher's the weather was not to be
depended upon. From the outward journey we knew that the distance
from the beacon where our camp was to the depot at the Butcher's
was thirteen and a half miles. We had not put up more than two
beacons on this stretch, but the ground was of such a nature that
we thought we could not go wrong. That it was not so easy to find
the way, in spite of the beacons, we were soon to discover. In
the fine, clear weather, and with Hanssen's sharp eyes, we picked
up both our beacons. Meanwhile we were astonished at the
appearance of the mountains. As I have already mentioned, we
thought the weather was perfectly clear when we reached the
Butcher's for the first time, on November 20. I then took a
bearing from the tent of the way we had come up on to the plateau
between the mountains, and carefully recorded it. After passing
our last beacon, when we were beginning to approach the
Butcher's&mdash;as we reckoned&mdash;we were greatly surprised at
the aspect of our surroundings. Last time&mdash;on November
20&mdash;we had seen mountains on the west and north, but a long
way off: Now the whole of that part of the horizon seemed to be
filled with colossal mountain masses, which were right over us.
What in the world was the meaning of this? Was it witchcraft? I
am sure I began to think so for a moment. I would readily have
taken my most solemn oath that I had never seen that landscape
before in my life. We had now gone the full distance, and
according to the beacons we had passed, we ought to be on the
spot. This was very strange; in the direction in which I had
taken the bearing of our ascent, we now only saw the side of a
perfectly unknown mountain, sticking up from the plain. There
could be absolutely no way down in that precipitous wall. Only on
the north-west did the ground give the impression of allowing a
descent; there a natural depression seemed to be formed, running
down towards the Barrier, which we could see far, far away.</p>
<p>We halted and discussed the situation. "Hullo!" Hanssen
suddenly exclaimed, "somebody has been here before."&mdash;"Yes,"
broke in Wisting; "I'm hanged if that isn't my broken ski that I
stuck up by the depot." So it was Wisting's broken ski that
brought us out of this unpleasant situation. It was a good thing
he put it there&mdash;very thoughtful, in any case. I now
examined the place with the glasses, and by the side of a snow
mound, which proved to be our depot, but might easily have
escaped our notice, we could see the ski sticking up out of the
snow. We cheerfully set our course for the spot, but did not
reach it until we had gone three miles.</p>
<p>There was rejoicing in our little band when we arrived and saw
that what we had considered the most important point of our
homeward journey had been reached. It was not so much for the
sake of the food it contained that we considered it so necessary
to find this spot, as for discovering the way down to the Barrier
again. And now that we stood there, we recognized this necessity
more than ever. For although we now knew, from our bearings,
exactly where the descent lay, we could see nothing of it at all.
The plateau there seemed to go right up to the mountain, without
any opening towards the lower ground beyond; and yet the compass
told us that such an opening must exist, and would take us down.
The mountain, on which we had thus walked all day on the outward
journey, without knowing anything of it, was Mount Fridtjof
Nansen. Yes, the difference in the light made a surprising
alteration in the appearance of things.</p>
<p>The first thing we did on reaching the depot was to take out
the dogs' carcasses that lay there and cut them into big lumps,
that were divided among the dogs. They looked rather surprised;
they had not been accustomed to such rations. We threw three
carcasses on to the sledges, so as to have a little extra food
for them on the way down. The Butcher's was not a very friendly
spot this time, either. True, it was not the same awful weather
as on our first visit, but it was blowing a fresh breeze with a
temperature of -9.4&deg; F., which, after the heat of the last
few days, seemed to go to one's marrow, and did not invite us to
stay longer than was absolutely necessary. Therefore, as soon as
we had finished feeding the dogs and putting our sledges in
order, we set out.</p>
<p>Although the ground had not given us the impression of
sloping, we soon found out that it did so when we got under way.
It was not only downhill, but the pace became so great that we
had to stop and put brakes under the sledges. As we advanced, the
apparently unbroken wall opened more and more, and showed us at
last our old familiar ascent. There lay Mount Ole Engelstad,
snowclad and cold, as we saw it the first time. As we rounded it
we came on to the severe, steep slope, where, on the way south, I
had so much admired the work done by my companions and the dogs
that day. But now I had an even better opportunity of seeing how
steep this ascent really had been. Many were the brakes we had to
put on before we could reduce the speed to a moderate pace, but
even so we came down rapidly, and soon the first part of the
descent lay behind us. So as not to be exposed to possible gusts
from the plain, we went round Mount Engelstad and camped under
the lee of it, well content with the day's work. The snow lay
here as on our first visit, deep and loose, and it was difficult
to find anything like a good place for the tent. We could soon
feel that we had descended a couple of thousand feet and come
down among the mountains. It was still, absolutely still, and the
sun broiled us as on a day of high summer at home. I thought,
too, that I could notice a difference in my breathing; it seemed
to work much more easily and pleasantly&mdash;perhaps it was only
imagination.</p>
<p>At one o'clock on the following morning we were out again. The
sight that met our eyes that morning, when we came out of the
tent, was one of those that will always live in our memories. The
tent stood in the narrow gap between Fridtjof Nansen and Ole
Engelstad. The sun, which now stood in the south, was completely
hidden by the latter mountain, and our camp was thus in the
deepest shadow; but right against us on the other side the Nansen
mountain raised its splendid ice-clad summit high towards heaven,
gleaming and sparkling in the rays of the midnight sun. The
shining white passed gradually, very gradually, into pale blue,
then deeper and deeper blue, until the shadow swallowed it up.
But down below, right on the Heiberg Glacier, its ice-covered
side was exposed&mdash;dark and solemn the mountain mass stood
out. Mount Engelstad lay in shadow, but on its summit rested a
beautiful light little cirrus cloud, red with an edge of gold.
Down over its side the blocks of ice lay scattered pell-mell. And
farther down on the east rose Don Pedro Christophersen, partly in
shadow, partly gleaming in the sun&mdash;a marvellously beautiful
sight. And all was so still; one almost feared to disturb the
incomparable splendour of the scene.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Image80" id="Image80"></a><img alt=""
src="e00111b-images/Image80.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>MOUNT DON PEDRO CHRISTOPHERSEN.</small></p>
<br>
<p>We now knew the ground well enough to be able to go straight
ahead without any detours. The huge avalanches were more frequent
than on the outward journey. One mass of snow after another
plunged down; Don Pedro was getting rid of his winter coat. The
going was precisely the same&mdash;loose, fairly deep snow. We
went quite easily over it, however, and it was all downhill. On
the ridge where the descent to the glacier began we halted to
make our preparations. Brakes were put under the sledges, and our
two ski-sticks were fastened together to make one strong one; we
should have to be able to stop instantly if surprised by a
crevasse as we were going. We ski-runners went in front. The
going was ideal here on the steep slope, just enough loose snow
to give one good steering on ski. We went whizzing down, and it
was not many minutes before we were on the Heiberg Glacier. For
the drivers it was not quite such plain sailing: they followed
our tracks, but had to be extremely careful on the steep
fall.</p>
<p>We camped that evening on the selfsame spot where we had had
our tent on November 18, at about 3,100 feet above the sea. From
here one could see the course of the Axel Heiberg Glacier right
down to its junction with the Barrier. It looked fine and even,
and we decided to follow it instead of climbing over the
mountain, as we had done on the way south. Perhaps the distance
would be somewhat longer, but probably we should make a
considerable saving of time. We had now agreed upon a new
arrangement of our time; the long spells of rest were becoming
almost unbearable. Another very important side of the question
was that, by a reasonable arrangement, we should be able to save
a lot of time, and reach home several days sooner than we had
reckoned. After a great deal of talk on one side and on the
other, we agreed to arrange matters thus: we were to do our
fifteen geographical miles, or twenty-eight kilometres, and then
have a sleep of six hours, turn out again and do fifteen miles
more, and so on. In this way we should accomplish a very good
average distance on our day's march. We kept to this arrangement
for the rest of the journey, and thus saved a good many days.</p>
<p>Our progress down the Heiberg Glacier did not encounter any
obstructions; only at the transition from the glacier to the
Barrier were there a few crevasses that had to be circumvented.
At 7 a.m. on January 6 we halted at the angle of land that forms
the entrance to the Heiberg Glacier, and thence extends
northward. We had not yet recognized any of the land we lay
under, but that was quite natural, as we now saw it from the
opposite side. We knew, though, that we were not far away from
our main depot in 85&deg; 5' S. On the afternoon of the same day
we were off again. From a little ridge we crossed immediately
after starting, Bjaaland thought he could see the depot down on
the Barrier, and it was not very long before we came in sight of
Mount Betty and our way up. And now we could make sure with the
glasses that it really was our depot that we saw&mdash;the same
that Bjaaland thought he had seen before. We therefore set our
course straight for it, and in a few minutes we were once more on
the Barrier&mdash;January 6, 11 p.m.&mdash;after a stay of
fifty-one days on land. It was on November 17 that we had begun
the ascent.</p>
<p>We reached the depot, and found everything in order. The heat
here must have been very powerful; our lofty, solid depot was
melted by the sun into a rather low mound of snow. The pemmican
rations that had been exposed to the direct action of the sun's
rays had assumed the strangest forms, and, of course, they had
become rancid. We got the sledges ready at once, taking all the
provisions out of the depot and loading them. We left behind some
of the old clothes we had been wearing all the way from here to
the Pole and back. When we had completed all this repacking and
had everything ready, two of us went over to Mount Betty, and
collected as many different specimens of rock as we could lay our
hands on. At the same time we built a great cairn, and left there
a can of 17 litres of paraffin, two packets of
matches&mdash;containing twenty boxes&mdash;and an account of our
expedition. Possibly someone may find a use for these things in
the future.</p>
<p>We had to kill Frithjof, one of Bjaaland's dogs, at this camp.
He had latterly been showing marked signs of shortness of breath,
and finally this became so painful to the animal that we decided
to put an end to him. Thus brave Frithjof ended his career. On
cutting him open it appeared that his lungs were quite shrivelled
up; nevertheless, the remains disappeared pretty quickly into his
companions' stomachs. What they had lost in quantity did not
apparently affect their quality. Nigger, one of Hassel's dogs,
had been destroyed on the way down from the plateau. We thus
reached this point again with twelve dogs, as we had reckoned on
doing, and left it with eleven. I see in my diary the following
remark: "The dogs look just as well as when we left Framheim." On
leaving the place a few hours later we had provisions for
thirty-five days on the sledges. Besides this, of course, we had
a depot at every degree of latitude up to 80&deg;.</p>
<p>It looked as though we had found our depot at the right
moment, for when we came out to continue our journey the whole
Barrier was in a blizzard. A gale was blowing from the south,
with a sky completely clouded over; falling snow and drift united
in a delightful dance, and made it difficult to see. The lucky
thing was that now we had the wind with us, and thus escaped
getting it all in our eyes, as, we had been accustomed to. The
big crevasse, which, as we knew, lay right across the line of our
route, made us go very carefully. To avoid any risk, Bjaaland and
Hassel, who went in advance, fastened an alpine rope between
them. The snow was very deep and loose, and the going very heavy.
Fortunately, we were warned in time of our approach to the
expected cracks by the appearance of some bare ice ridges. These
told us clearly enough that disturbances had taken place here,
and that even greater ones might be expected, probably near at
hand. At that moment the thick curtain of cloud was torn asunder,
and the sun pierced the whirling mass of snow. Instantly Hanssen
shouted: "Stop, Bjaaland!" He was just on the edge of the yawning
crevasse. Bjaaland himself has splendid sight, but his excellent
snow-goggles&mdash;his own patent&mdash;entirely prevented his
seeing. Well, Bjaaland would not have been in any serious danger
if he had fallen into the crevasse, as he was roped to Hassel,
but it would have been confoundedly unpleasant all the same.</p>
<p>As I have said before, I assume that these great disturbances
here mark the boundary between the Barrier and the land. This
time, curiously enough, they seemed also to form a boundary
between good and bad weather, for on the far side of
them&mdash;to the north&mdash;the Barrier lay bathed in sunshine.
On the south the blizzard raged worse than ever. Mount Betty was
the last to send us its farewell. South Victoria Land had gone
into hiding, and did not show itself again. As soon as we came
into the sunshine, we ran upon one of our beacons; our course lay
straight towards it. That was not bad steering in the dark. At 9
p.m. we reached the depot in 85&deg; S. Now we could begin to be
liberal with the dogs' food, too; they had double pemmican
rations, besides as many oatmeal biscuits as they would eat. We
had such masses of biscuits now that we could positively throw
them about. Of course, we might have left a large part of these
provisions behind; but there was a great satisfaction in being so
well supplied with food, and the dogs did not seem to mind the
little extra weight in the least. As long as things went so
capitally as they were going&mdash;that is, with men and dogs
exactly keeping pace with one another&mdash;we could ask for
nothing better. But the weather that had cheered us was not of
long duration. "Same beastly weather," my diary says of the next
stage. The wind had shifted to the north-west, with overcast,
thick weather, and very troublesome drifting snow. In spite of
these unfavourable conditions, we passed beacon after beacon, and
at the end of our march had picked up all the beacons we had
erected on this distance of seventeen miles and three-eighths.
But, as before, we owed this to Hanssen's good eyes.</p>
<p>On our way southward we had taken a good deal of seal meat and
had divided it among the depots we built on the Barrier in such a
way that we were now able to eat fresh meat every day. This had
not been done without an object; if we should be visited with
scurvy, this fresh meat would be invaluable. As we
were&mdash;sound and healthy as we had never been
before&mdash;the seal-beef was a pleasant distraction in our
menu, nothing more. The temperature had risen greatly since we
came down on to the Barrier, and kept steady at about +14&deg; F.
We were so warm in our sleeping-bags that we had to turn them
with the hair out. That was better; we breathed more freely and
felt happier. "Just like going into an ice-cellar," somebody
remarked. The same feeling as when on a really warm summer day
one comes out of the hot sun into cool shade.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 9.&mdash;"Same beastly weather; snow, snow,
snow, nothing but snow. Is there no end to it? Thick too, so that
we have not been able to see ten yards ahead. Temperature
+17.6&deg; F. Thawing everywhere on the sledges. Everything
getting wet. Have not found a single beacon in this blind man's
weather. The snow was very deep to begin with and the going
exceedingly heavy, but in spite of this the dogs managed their
sledges very well." That evening the weather improved,
fortunately, and became comparatively clear by the time we
resumed our journey at 10 p.m. Not long after we sighted one of
our beacons. It lay to the west, about 200 yards away. We were
thus not far out of our course; we turned aside and went up to
it, as it was interesting to see whether our reckoning was in
order. The beacon was somewhat damaged by sunshine and storms,
but we found the paper left in it, which told us that this beacon
was erected on November 14, in 84&deg; 26' S. It also told us
what course to steer by compass to reach the next beacon, which
lay five kilometres from this one.</p>
<p>As we were leaving this old friend and setting our course as
it advised, to our unspeakable astonishment two great
birds&mdash;skua gulls&mdash;suddenly came flying straight
towards us. They circled round us once or twice and then settled
on the beacon. Can anyone who reads these lines form an idea of
the effect this had upon us? It is hardly likely. They brought us
a message from the living world into this realm of death&mdash;a
message of all that was dear to us. I think the same thoughts
filled us all. They did not allow themselves a long rest, these
first messengers from another world; they sat still a while, no
doubt wondering who we were, then rose aloft and flew on to the
south. Mysterious creatures! they were now exactly half-way
between Framheim and the Pole, and yet they were going farther
inland. Were they going over to the other side?</p>
<p>Our march ended this time at one of our beacons, in 84&deg;
15'. It felt so good and safe to lie beside one of these; it
always gave us a sure starting-point for the following stage. We
were up at 4 a.m. and left the place a few hours later, with the
result that the day's march brought us thirty-four miles nearer
Framheim. With our present arrangement, we had these long-day
marches every other day. Our dogs need no better testimonial than
this&mdash;one day seventeen miles, the next day thirty-four, and
fresh all the way home. The two birds, agreeably as their first
appearance had affected me, led my thoughts after a while in
another direction, which was anything but agreeable. It occurred
to me that these two might only be representatives of a larger
collection of these voracious birds, and that the remainder might
now be occupied in consuming all the fresh meat we had so
laboriously transported with us and spread all over the plain in
our depots. It is incredible what a flock of these birds of prey
can get rid of; it would not matter if the meat were frozen as
hard as iron, they would have managed it, even if it had been a
good deal harder than iron. Of the seals' carcasses we had lying
in 80&deg;, I saw in my thoughts nothing but the bones. Of the
various dogs we had killed on our way south and laid on the tops
of beacons I did not see even so much as that. Well, it was
possible that my thoughts had begun to assume too dark a hue;
perhaps the reality would be brighter.</p>
<p>Weather and going began by degrees to right themselves; it
looked as if things would improve in proportion to our distance
from land. Finally, both became perfect; the sun shone from a
cloudless sky, and the sledges ran on the fine, even surface with
all the ease and speed that could be desired. Bjaaland, who had
occupied the position of forerunner all the way from the Pole,
performed his duties admirably; but the old saying that nobody is
perfect applied even to him. None of us&mdash;no matter who it
may be&mdash;can keep in a straight line, when he has no marks to
follow. All the more difficult is this when, as so often happened
with us, one has to go blindly. Most of us, I suppose, would
swerve now to one side, now to the other, and possibly end, after
all this groping, by keeping pretty well to the line. Not so with
Bjaaland; he was a right-hand man. I can see him now; Hanssen has
given him the direction by compass, and Bjaaland turns round,
points his ski in the line indicated and sets of with decision.
His movements clearly show that he has made up his mind, cost
what it may, to keep in the right direction. He sends his ski
firmly along, so that the snow spurts from them, and looks
straight before him. But the result is the same; if Hanssen had
let Bjaaland go on without any correction, in the course of an
hour or so the latter would probably have described a beautiful
circle and brought himself back to the spot from which he had
started. Perhaps. after all, this was not a fault to complain of,
since we always knew with absolute certainty that, when we had
got out of the line of beacons, we were to the right of it and
had to search for the beacons to the west. This conclusion proved
very useful to us more than once, and we gradually became so
familiar with Bjaaland's right-handed tendencies that we actually
counted on them.</p>
<p>On January 13, according to our reckoning, we ought to reach
the depot in 83&deg; S. This was the last of our depots that was
not marked at right angles to the route, and therefore the last
critical point. The day was not altogether suited for finding the
needle in the haystack. It was calm with a thick fog, so thick
that we could only see a few yards in front of us. We did not see
a single beacon on the whole march. At 4 p.m. we had completed
the distance, according to the sledge-meters, and reckoned that
we ought to be in 83&deg; S., by the depot; but there was nothing
to be seen. We decided, therefore, to set our tent and wait till
it cleared. While we were at work with this, there was a rift in
the thick mass of fog, and there, not many yards away&mdash;to
the west, of course&mdash;lay our depot. We quickly took the tent
down again, packed it on the sledge, and drove up to our food
mound, which proved to be quite in order. There was no sign of
the birds having paid it a visit. But what was that? Fresh,
well-marked dog-tracks in the newly-fallen snow. We soon saw that
they must be the tracks of the runaways that we had lost here on
the way south. Judging by appearances, they must have lain under
the lee of the depot for a considerable time; two deep hollows in
the snow told us that plainly. And evidently they must have had
enough food, but where on earth had they got it from? The depot
was absolutely untouched, in spite of the fact that the lumps of
pemmican lay exposed to the light of day and were very easy to
get at; besides which, the snow on the depot was not so hard as
to prevent the dogs pulling it down and eating up all the food.
Meanwhile the dogs had left the place again, as shown by the
fresh trail, which pointed to the north. We examined the tracks
very closely, and agreed that they were not more than two days
old. They went northward, and we followed them from time to time
on our next stage. At the beacon in 82&deg; 45', where we halted,
we saw them still going to the north. In 82&deg; 24' the trail
began to be much confused, and ended by pointing due west. That
was the last we saw of the tracks; but we had not done with these
dogs, or rather with their deeds. We stopped at the beacon in
82&deg; 20'. Else, who had been laid on the top of it, had fallen
down and lay by the side; the sun had thawed away the lower part
of the beacon. So the roving dogs had not been here; so much was
certain, for otherwise we should not have found Else as we did.
We camped at the end of that stage by the beacon in 82&deg; 15',
and shared out Else's body. Although she had been lying in the
strong sunshine, the flesh was quite good, when we had scraped
away a little mouldiness. It smelt rather old, perhaps, but our
dogs were not fastidious when it was a question of meat.</p>
<p>On January 16 we arrived at the depot in 82&deg; S. We could
see from a long way off that the order in which we had left it no
longer prevailed. When we came up to it, we saw at once what had
happened. The innumerable dog-tracks that had trampled the snow
quite hard round the depot declared plainly enough that the
runaways had spent a good deal of time here. Several of the cases
belonging to the depot had fallen down, presumably from the same
cause as Else, and the rascals had succeeded in breaking into one
of them. Of the biscuits and pemmican which it had contained,
nothing, of course, was left; but that made no difference to us
now, as we had food in abundance. The two dogs' carcasses that we
had placed on the top of the depot&mdash;Uranus and
Jaala&mdash;were gone, not even the teeth were to be seen. Yet
they had left the teeth of Lucy, whom they had eaten in 82&deg;
3'. Jaala's eight puppies were still lying on the top of a case;
curiously enough, they had not fallen down. In addition to all
the rest, the beasts had devoured some ski-bindings and things of
that sort. It was no loss to us, as it happened; but who could
tell which way these creatures had gone? If they had succeeded in
finding the depot in 80&deg; S., they would probably by this time
have finished our supply of seal meat there. Of course it would
be regrettable if this had happened, although it would entail no
danger either to ourselves or our animals. If we got as far as
80&deg;, we should come through all right. For the time being, we
had to console ourselves with the fact that we could see no
continuation of the trail northward.</p>
<p>We permitted ourselves a little feast here in 82&deg;. The
"chocolate pudding" that Wisting served as dessert is still fresh
in my memory; we all agreed that it came nearer perfection than
anything it had hitherto fallen to our lot to taste. I may
disclose the receipt: biscuit-crumbs, dried milk and chocolate
are put into a kettle of boiling water. What happens afterwards,
I don't know; for further information apply to Wisting. Between
82&deg; and 81&deg; we came into our old marks of the second
depot journey; on that trip we had marked this distance with
splinters of packing-case at every geographical mile. That was in
March, 1911, and now we were following these splinters in the
second half of January, 1912. Apparently they stood exactly as
they had been put in. This marking stopped in 81&deg; 33' S.,
with two pieces of case on a snow pedestal. The pedestal was
still intact and good.</p>
<p>I shall let my diary describe what we saw on January 18:
"Unusually fine weather to-day. Light south-south-west breeze,
which in the course of our march cleared the whole sky. In
81&deg; 20' we came abreast of our old big pressure ridges. We
now saw far more of them than ever before. They extended as far
as the eye could see, running north-east to south-west, in ridges
and peaks. Great was our surprise when, a short time after, we
made out high, bare land in the same direction, and not long
after that two lofty, white summits to the south-east, probably
in about 82&deg; S. It could be seen by the look of the sky that
the land extended from north-east to south-west. This must be the
same land that we saw lose itself in the horizon in about
84&deg;S., when we stood at a height of about 4,000 feet and
looked out over the Barrier, during our ascent. We now have
sufficient indications to enable us without hesitation to draw
this land as continuous&mdash;Carmen Land. The surface against
the land is violently disturbed&mdash;crevasses and pressure
ridges, waves and valleys, in all directions. We shall no doubt
feel the effect of it to-morrow." Although what we have seen
apparently justifies us in concluding that Carmen Land extends
from 86&deg; S. to this position&mdash;about 81&deg; 30'
S.&mdash;and possibly farther to the north-east, I have not
ventured to lay it down thus on the map. I have contented myself
with giving the name of Carmen Land to the land between 86&deg;
and 84&deg;, and have called the rest "Appearance of Land." It
will be a profitable task for an explorer to investigate this
district more closely.</p>
<p>As we had expected, on our next stage we were made to feel the
effect of the disturbances. Three times we had now gone over this
stretch of the Barrier without having really clear weather. This
time we had it, and were able to see what it actually looked
like. The irregularities began in 81&deg; 12' S., and did not
extend very far from north to south&mdash;possibly about five
kilometres (three and a quarter miles). How far they extended
from east to west it is difficult to say, but at any rate as far
as the eye could reach. Immense pieces of the surface had fallen
away and opened up the most horrible yawning gulfs, big enough to
swallow many caravans of the size of ours. From these open holes,
ugly wide cracks ran out in all directions; besides which, mounds
and haycocks were everywhere to be seen. Perhaps the most
remarkable thing of all was that we had passed over here
unharmed. We went across as light-footedly as possible, and at
top speed. Hanssen went halfway into a crevasse, but luckily got
out of it again without difficulty.</p>
<p>The depot in 81&deg; S. was in perfect order; no dog-tracks to
be seen there. Our hopes that the depot in 80&deg; S. would be
intact rose considerably. In 80&deg; 45' S. lay the first dog we
had killed&mdash;Bone. He was particularly fat, and was immensely
appreciated. The dogs no longer cared very much for pemmican. On
January 21 we passed our last beacon, which stood in 80&deg; 23'
S. Glad as we were to leave it behind, I cannot deny that it was
with a certain feeling of melancholy that we saw it vanish. We
had grown so fond of our beacons, and whenever we met them we
greeted them as old friends. Many and great were the services
these silent watchers did us on our long and lonely way.</p>
<p>On the same day we reached our big depot in 80&deg; S., and
now we considered that we were back. We could see at once that
others had been at the depot since we had left it, and we found a
message from Lieutenant Prestrud, the leader of the eastern
party, saying that he, with Stubberud and Johansen, had passed
here on November 12, with two sledges, sixteen dogs, and supplies
for thirty days. Everything thus appeared to be in the best of
order. Immediately on arriving at the depot we let the dogs
loose, and they made a dash for the heap of seal's flesh, which
had been attacked neither by birds nor dogs in our absence. It
was not so much for the sake of eating that our dogs made their
way to the meat mound, as for the sake of fighting. Now they
really had something to fight about. They went round the seals'
carcasses a few times, looked askance at the food and at each
other, and then flung themselves into the wildest scrimmage. When
this had been duly brought to a conclusion, they went away and
lay round their sledges. The depot in 80&deg; S. is still large,
well supplied and well marked, so it is not impossible that it
may be found useful later.</p>
<p>The journey from 80&deg; S. to Framheim has been so often
described that there is nothing new to say about it. On January
25, at 4 a.m., we reached our good little house again, with two
sledges and eleven dogs; men and animals all hale and hearty. We
stood and waited for each other outside the door in the early
morning; our appearance must be made all together. It was so
still and quiet&mdash;they must be all asleep. We came in.
Stubberud started up in his bunk and glared at us; no doubt he
took us for ghosts. One after another they woke up&mdash;not
grasping what was happening. Then there was a hearty welcome home
on all sides "Where's the <i>Fram</i>?" was of course our first
question Our joy was great when we heard all was well. "And what
about the Pole? Have you been there?"&mdash;"Yes, of course;
otherwise you would hardly have seen us again." Then the coffee
kettle was put on, and the perfume of "hot cakes" rose as in old
days. We agreed that it was good outside, but still better at
home. Ninety-nine days the trip had taken. Distance about 1,860
miles.</p>
<p>The <i>Fram</i> had come in to the Barrier on January 8, after
a three months' voyage from Buenos Aires; all were well on board.
Meanwhile, bad weather had forced her to put out again. On the
following day the lookout man reported that the <i>Fram</i> was
approaching There was life in the camp; on with furs and out with
the dogs. They should see that our dogs were not worn out yet. We
heard the engine panting and grunting, saw the crow's-nest appear
over the edge of the Barrier, and at last she glided in, sure and
steady. It was with a joyful heart I went on board and greeted
all these gallant men, who had brought the <i>Fram</i> to her
destination through so many fatigues and perils, and had
accomplished so much excellent work on the way. They all looked
pleased and happy, but nobody asked about the Pole. At last it
slipped out of Gjertsen: "Have you been there?" Joy is a poor
name for the feeling that beamed in my comrades' faces; it was
something more.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV<br>
<br>
<small>NORTHWARD</small></h3>
<p><small>AFTER</small> two days of bustle in getting on board
the things we were to take with us, we managed to be ready for
sea on the afternoon of January 30. There could scarcely have
been anything at that moment that rejoiced us more than just that
fact, that we were able at so early a date to set our course
northward and thus take the first step on the way to that world
which, as we knew, would soon begin to expect news from us, or of
us. And yet, I wonder whether there was not a little feeling of
melancholy in the midst of all our joy? It can hardly be doubted
that such was really the case, although to many this may seem a
flat contradiction. But it is not altogether so easy to part from
a place that has been one's home for any length of time, even
though this home lie in the 79th degree of latitude, more or less
buried in snow and ice. We human beings are far too dependent on
habit to be able to tear ourselves abruptly from the surroundings
with which we have been obliged to be familiar for many months.
That outsiders would perhaps pray all the powers of goodness to
preserve them from such surroundings, does not counteract the
full validity of this rule. To an overwhelming majority of our
fellow-men Framheim will certainly appear as one of those spots
on our planet where they would least of all wish to find
themselves&mdash;a God-forsaken, out-of-the-way hole that could
offer nothing but the very climax of desolation, discomfort, and
boredom. To us nine, who stood on the gangway ready to leave this
place, things appeared somewhat differently. That strong little
house, that now lay entirely hidden beneath the snow behind Mount
Nelson, had for a whole year been our home, and a thoroughly good
and comfortable home it was, where after so many a hard day's
work we had found all the rest and quiet we wanted. Through the
whole Antarctic winter&mdash;and it is a winter&mdash;those four
walls had protected us so well that many a poor wretch in milder
latitudes would have envied us with all his heart, if he could
have seen us. In conditions so hard that every form of life flies
headlong from them, we had lived on at Framheim undisturbed and
untroubled, and lived, be it said, not as animals, but as
civilized human beings, who had always within their reach most of
the good things that are found in a well-ordered home. Darkness
and cold reigned outside, and the blizzards no doubt did their
best to blot out most traces of our activity, but these enemies
never came within the door of our excellent dwelling; there we
shared quarters with light and warmth and comfort. What wonder
was it that this spot exercised a strong attraction upon each of
us at the moment when we were to turn our backs upon it for good?
Outside the great world beckoned to us, that is true; and it
might have much to offer us that we had had to forego for a long
time; but in what awaited us there was certainly a great deal
that we would gladly have put off for as long as possible. When
everyday life came with its cares and worries, it might well
happen that we should look back with regret to our peaceful and
untroubled existence at Framheim.</p>
<p>However, this feeling of melancholy was hardly so strong that
we could not all get over it comparatively quickly. Judging by
the faces, at any rate, one would have thought that joy was the
most predominant mood. And why not? It was no use dwelling on the
past, however attractive it might seem just then, and as to the
future, we had every right to expect the best of it. Who cared to
think of coming troubles? No one. Therefore the <i>Fram</i> was
dressed with flags from stem to stern, and therefore faces beamed
at each other as we said good-bye to our home on the Barrier. We
could leave it with the consciousness that the object of our
year's stay had been attained, and, after all, this consciousness
was of considerably more weight than the thought that we had been
so happy there. One thing that in the course of our two years'
association on this expedition contributed enormously to making
time pass easily and keeping each of us in full vigour was the
entire absence of what I may call "dead periods." As soon as one
problem was solved, another instantly appeared. No sooner was one
goal reached, than the next one beckoned from afar. In this way
we always had our hands full, and when that is the case, as
everyone knows, time flies quickly. One often hears it asked, How
is it possible to make the time pass on such a trip? My good
friends, I would answer, if anything caused us worry, it was the
thought of how we should find time enough for all we had to do.
Perhaps to many this assertion will bear the stamp of
improbability; it is, nevertheless, absolutely true. Those who
have read this narrative through will, in any case, have received
the impression that unemployment was an evil that was utterly
unknown in our little community.</p>

<br>
<small>FAREWELL TO THE BARRIER.</small></p>
<br>
<p>At the stage where we now found ourselves, with the main
object of our enterprise achieved, there might have been reason
to expect a certain degree of relaxation of interest. This,
however, was not the case. The fact was that what we had done
would have no real value until it was brought to the knowledge of
mankind, and this communication had to be made with as little
loss of time as possible. If anyone was interested in being first
in the market it was certainly ourselves. The probability was, no
doubt, that we were out in good time; but, in spite of all, it
was only a probability. On the other hand, it was absolutely
certain that we had a voyage of 2,400 nautical miles to Hobart,
which had been selected as our first port of call; and it was
almost equally certain that this voyage would be both slow and
troublesome. A year before our trip through Ross Sea had turned
out almost like a pleasure cruise, but that was in the middle of
summer. Now we were in February, and autumn was at hand. As
regards the belt of drift-ice, Captain Nilsen thought that would
cause us no delay in future. He had discovered a patent and
infallible way of getting through! This sounded like a rather
bold assertion, but, as will be seen later, he was as good as his
word. Our worst troubles would be up in the westerlies, where we
should this time be exposed to the unpleasant possibility of
having to beat. The difference in longitude between the Bay of
Whales and Hobart is nearly fifty degrees. If we could have
sailed off this difference in longitude in the latitudes where we
then were, and where a degree of longitude is only about thirteen
nautical miles, it would all have been done in a twinkling; but
the mighty mountain ranges of North Victoria Land were a decisive
obstacle. We should first have to follow a northerly course until
we had rounded the Antarctic Continent's northern outpost, Cape
Adare, and the Balleny Islands to the north of it. Not till then
would the way be open for us to work to the west; but then we
should be in a region where in all probability the wind would be
dead against us, and as to tacking with the <i>Fram</i>&mdash;no,
thank you! Every single man on board knew enough of the
conditions to be well aware of what awaited us, and it is equally
certain that the thoughts of all were centred upon how we might
conquer our coming difficulties in the best and quickest way. It
was the one great, common object that still bound, and would
continue to bind, us all together in our joint efforts.</p>

<br>
[below]: DOGS LANDED AT HOBART FOR DR. MAWSON'S
EXPEDITION.</small></p>
<br>
<p>Among the items of news that we had just received from the
outer world was the message that the Australian Antarctic
Expedition under Dr. Douglas Mawson would be glad to take over
some of our dogs, if we had any to spare. The base of this
expedition was Hobart, and as far as that went, this suited us
very well. It chanced that we were able to do our esteemed
colleague this small service. On leaving the Barrier we could
show a pack of thirty-nine dogs, many of which had grown up
during our year's stay there; about half had survived the whole
trip from Norway, and eleven had been at the South Pole. It had
been our intention only to keep a suitable number as the
progenitors of a new pack for the approaching voyage in the
Arctic Ocean, but Dr. Mawson's request caused us to take all the
thirty-nine on board. Of these dogs, if nothing unforeseen
happened, we should be able to make over twenty-one to him. When
the last load was brought down, there was nothing to do but to
pull the dogs over the side, and then we were ready. It was quite
curious to see how several of the old veterans seemed at home
again on the <i>Fram</i>'s deck. Wisting's brave dog, the old
Colonel, with his two adjutants, Suggen and Arne, at once took
possession of the places where they had stood for so many a long
day on the voyage south&mdash;on the starboard side of the
mainmast; the two twins, Mylius and Ring, Helmer Hanssen's
special favourites, began their games away in the corner of the
fore-deck to port, as though nothing had happened. To look at
those two merry rascals no one would have thought they had
trotted at the head of the whole caravan both to and from the
Pole. One solitary dog could be seen stalking about, lonely and
reserved, in a continual uneasy search. This was the boss of
Bjaaland's team. He was unaffected by any advances; no one could
take the place of his fallen comrade and friend, Frithjof, who
had long ago found a grave in the stomachs of his companions many
hundreds of miles across the Barrier.</p>
<p>No sooner was the last dog helped on board, and the two
ice-anchors released, than the engine-room telegraph rang, and
the engine was at once set going to keep us from any closer
contact with the ice-foot in the Bay of Whales. Our farewell to
this snug harbour took almost the form of a leap from one world
to another; the fog hung over us as thick as gruel, concealing
all the surrounding outlines behind its clammy curtain, as we
stood out. After a lapse of three or four hours, it lifted quite
suddenly, but astern of us the bank of fog still stood like a
wall; behind it the panorama, which we knew would have looked
wonderful in clear weather, and which we should so gladly have
let our eyes rest upon as long as we could, was entirely
concealed.</p>
<p>The same course we had steered when coming in a year before
could safely be taken in the opposite direction now we were going
out. The outlines of the bay had remained absolutely unchanged
during the year that had elapsed. Even the most projecting point
of the wall on the west side of the bay, Cape Man's Head, stood
serenely in its old place, and it looked as if it was in no
particular hurry to remove itself. It will probably stay where it
is for many a long day yet, for if any movement of the ice mass
is taking place at the inner end of the bay, it is in any case
very slight. Only in one respect did the condition of things
differ somewhat this year from the preceding. Whereas in 1911 the
greater part of the bay was free of sea-ice as early as January
14, in 1912 there was no opening until about fourteen days later.
The ice-sheet had stubbornly held on until the fresh
north-easterly breeze, that appeared on the very day the southern
party returned, had rapidly provided a channel of open water. The
breaking up of the ice could not possibly have taken place at a
more convenient moment; the breeze in question saved us a great
deal, both of time and trouble, as the way to the place where the
<i>Fram</i> lay before the ice broke up was about five times as
long as the distance we now had to go. This difference of
fourteen days in the time of the disappearance of the ice in two
summers showed us how lucky we had been to choose that particular
year&mdash;1911&mdash;for our landing here. The work which we
carried out in three weeks in 1911, thanks to the early breaking
up of the ice, would certainly have taken us double the time in
1912, and would have caused us far more difficulty and
trouble.</p>
<p>The thick fog that, as I have said, lay over the Bay of Whales
when we left it, prevented us also from seeing what our friends
the Japanese were doing. The <i>Kainan Maru</i> had put to sea in
company with the <i>Fram</i> during the gale of January 27, and
since that time we had seen nothing of them. Those members of the
expedition who had been left behind in a tent on the edge of the
Barrier to the north of Framheim had also been very retiring of
late. On the day we left the place, one of our own party had an
interview with two of the foreigners. Prestrud had gone to fetch
the flag that had been set up on Cape Man's Head as a signal to
the <i>Fram</i> that all had returned. By the side of the flag a
tent had been put up, which was intended as a shelter for a
lookout man, in case the <i>Fram</i> had been delayed. When
Prestrud came up, he was no doubt rather surprised to find
himself face to face with two sons of Nippon, who were engaged in
inspecting our tent and its contents, which, however, only
consisted of a sleeping-bag and a Primus. The Japanese had opened
the conversation with enthusiastic phrases about "nice day" and
"plenty ice"; when our man had expressed his absolute agreement
on these indisputable facts, he tried to get information on
matters of more special interest. The two strangers told him that
for the moment they were the only inhabitants of the tent out on
the edge of the Barrier. Two of their companions had gone on a
tour into the Barrier to make meteorological observations, and
were to be away about a week. The <i>Kainan Maru</i> had gone on
another cruise in the direction of King Edward Land. As far as
they knew, it was intended that the ship should be back before
February 10, and that all the members of the expedition should
then go on board and sail to the north. Prestrud had invited his
two new acquaintances to visit us at Framheim, the sooner the
better; they delayed their coming too long, however, for us to be
able to wait for them. If they have since been at Framheim, they
will at any rate be able to bear witness that we did our best to
make things comfortable for any successors.</p>

<br>
<small>MEMBERS OF THE JAPANESE ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION.</small></p>
<br>
<p>When the fog lifted, we found ourselves surrounded by open
sea, practically free from ice, on all sides. A blue-black sea,
with a heavy, dark sky above it, is not usually reckoned among
the sights that delight the eye. To our organs of vision it was a
real relief to come into surroundings where dark colours
predominated. For months we had been staring at a dazzling sea of
white, where artificial means had constantly to be employed to
protect the eyes against the excessive flood of light. As a rule,
it was even necessary to limit the exposure of the pupils to a
minimum, and to draw the eyelids together. Now we could once more
look on the world with open eyes, literally "without winking ";
even such a commonplace thing as this is an experience in one's
life. Ross Sea showed itself again on its most favourable side. A
cat's paw of south-westerly wind enabled us to use the sails, so
that after a lapse of two days we were already about two hundred
miles from the Barrier. Modest as this distance may be in itself,
when seen on the chart it looked quite imposing in our eyes. It
must be remembered that, with the means of transport we had
employed on land, it cost us many a hard day's march to cover a
distance of two hundred geographical miles.</p>
<p>Nilsen had marked on the chart the limits of the belt of
drift-ice during the three passages the <i>Fram</i> had already
made. The supposition that an available opening is always to be
found in the neighbourhood of the 150th meridian appears to be
confirmed. The slight changes in the position of the channel were
only caused, according to Nilsen's experiences, by variations in
the direction of the wind. He had found that it always answered
his purpose to turn and try to windward, if the pack showed signs
of being close. This mode of procedure naturally had the effect
of making the course somewhat crooked, but to make up for this it
had always resulted in his finding open water. On this trip we
reached the edge of the pack-ice belt three days after leaving
the Barrier. The position of the belt proved to be very nearly
the same as on previous passages. After we had held our course
for some hours, however, the ice became so thick that it looked
badly for our further progress. Now was the time to try Nilsen's
method: the wind, which, by the way, was quite light, came about
due west, and accordingly the helm was put to starboard and the
bow turned to the west. For a good while we even steered true
south, but it proved that this fairly long turn had not been made
in vain; after we had worked our way to windward for a few hours,
we found openings in numbers. If we had held our course as we
began, it is not at all impossible that we should have been
delayed for a long time, with a free passage a few miles
away.</p>
<p>After having accomplished this first long turn, we escaped
having to make any more in future. The ice continued slack, and
on February 6 the rapidly increasing swell told us that we had
done with the Antarctic drift-ice for good. I doubt if we saw a
single seal during our passage through the ice-belt this time;
and if we had seen any, we should scarcely have allowed the time
for shooting them. There was plenty of good food both for men and
dogs this time, without our having recourse to seal-beef. For the
dogs we had brought all our remaining store of the excellent
dogs' pemmican, and that was not a little. Besides this, we had a
good lot of dried fish. They had fish and pemmican on alternate
days. On this diet the animals kept in such splendid condition
that, when on arrival at Hobart they had shed most of their rough
winter coats, they looked as if they had been in clover for a
year.</p>
<p>For the nine of us who had just joined the ship, our comrades
on board had brought all the way from Buenos Aires several fat
pigs, that were now living in luxury in their pen on the
after-deck; in addition to these, three fine sheep's carcasses
hung in the workroom. It need scarcely be said that we were fully
capable of appreciating these unexpected luxuries. Seal-beef, no
doubt, had done excellent service, but this did not prevent roast
mutton and pork being a welcome change, especially as they came
as a complete surprise. I hardly think one of us had counted on
the possibility of getting fresh meat before we were back again
in civilization.</p>
<p>On her arrival at the Bay of Whales there were eleven men on
board the <i>Fram</i>, all included. Instead of Kutschin and
N&ouml;dtvedt, who had gone home from Buenos Aires while the ship
was there in the autumn of 1911, three new men were
engaged&mdash;namely, Halvorsen, Olsen and Steller; the two
first-named were from Bergen; Steller was a German, who had lived
for several years in Norway, and talked Norwegian like a native.
All three were remarkably efficient and friendly men; it was a
pleasure to have any dealings with them. I venture to think that
they, too, found themselves at home in our company; they were
really only engaged until the <i>Fram</i> called at the first
port, but they stayed on board all the way to Buenos Aires, and
will certainly go with us farther still.</p>
<p>When the shore party came on board, Lieutenant Prestrud took
up his old position as first officer; the others began duty at
once. All told, we were now twenty men on board, and after the
<i>Fram</i> had sailed for a year rather short-handed, she could
now be said to have a full crew again. On this voyage we had no
special work outside the usual sea routine, and so long as the
weather was fair, we had thus a comparatively quiet life on
board. But the hours of watch on deck passed quickly enough, I
expect; there was material in plenty for many a long chat now. If
we, who came from land, showed a high degree of curiosity about
what had been going on in the world, the sea-party were at least
as eager to have full information of every detail of our
year-long stay on the Barrier. One must almost have experienced
something similar oneself to be able to form an idea of the hail
of questions that is showered upon one on such an occasion. What
we land-lubbers had to relate has been given in outline in the
preceding chapters. Of the news we heard from outside, perhaps
nothing interested us so much as the story of how the change in
the plan of the expedition had been received at home and
abroad.</p>
<p>It must have been at least a week before there was any
noticeable ebb in the flood of questions and answers. That week
went by quickly; perhaps more quickly than we really cared for,
since it proved that the <i>Fram</i> was not really able to keep
pace with time. The weather remained quite well behaved, but not
exactly in the way we wished. We had reckoned that the
south-easterly and easterly winds, so frequent around Framheim,
would also show themselves out in Ross Sea, but they entirely
forgot to do so. We had little wind, and when there was any, it
was, as a rule, a slant from the north, always enough to delay
our honest old ship. It was impossible to take any observations
for the first eight days, the sky was continuously overcast. If
one occasionally asked the skipper about her position, he usually
replied that the only thing that could be said for certain was
that we were in Ross Sea. On February 7, however, according to a
fairly good noon observation, we were well to the north of Cape
Adare, and therefore beyond the limits of the Antarctic
Continent. On the way northward we passed Cape Adare at a
distance hardly greater than could have been covered with a good
day's sailing; but our desire of making this detour had to give
way to the chief consideration&mdash;northward, northward as
quickly as possible.</p>
<p>There is usually plenty of wind in the neighbourhood of bold
promontories, and Cape Adare is no exception in this respect; it
is well known as a centre of bad weather. Nor did we slip by
without getting a taste of this; but it could not have been more
welcome, as it happened that the wind was going the same way as
ourselves. Two days of fresh south-east wind took us
comparatively quickly past the Balleny Islands, and on February 9
we could congratulate ourselves on being well out of the south
frigid zone. It was with joy that we had crossed the Antarctic
Circle over a year ago, going south; perhaps we rejoiced no less
at crossing it this time in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>In the bustle of getting away from our winter-quarters there
had been no time for any celebration of the fortunate reunion of
the land and sea parties. As this occasion for festivity had been
let slip, we had to look out for another, and we agreed that the
day of our passage from the frigid to the temperate zone afforded
a very good excuse. The pre-arranged part of the programme was
extremely simple: an extra cup of coffee, duly accompanied by
punch and cigars, and some music on the gramophone. Our worthy
gramophone could not offer anything that had the interest of
novelty to us nine who had wintered at Framheim: we knew the
whole repertoire pretty well by heart; but the well-known
melodies awakened memories of many a pleasant Saturday evening
around the toddy table in our cosy winter home down at the head
of the Bay of Whales&mdash;memories which we need not be ashamed
of recalling. On board the <i>Fram</i> gramophone music had not
been heard since Christmas Eve, 1910, and the members of the sea
party were glad enough to encore more than one number.</p>
<p>Outside the limits of the programme we were treated to an
extra number by a singer, who imitated the gramophone in
utilizing a big megaphone, to make up for the deficiencies of his
voice&mdash;according to his own statement. He hid behind the
curtain of Captain Nilsen's cabin, and through the megaphone came
a ditty intended to describe life on the Barrier from its
humorous side. It was completely successful, and we again had a
laugh that did us good. Performances of this kind, of course,
only have a value to those who have taken part in or are
acquainted with the events to which they refer. In case any
outsider may be interested in seeing what our entertainment was
like, a few of the verses are given here.</p>
<p>It must be remarked that the author composed his production in
the supposition that we should be able to meet by Christmas, and
he therefore proposed that for the moment we should imagine
ourselves to be celebrating that festival. We made no difficulty
about acceding to his request:</p>
<p class="quote">Well, here we are assembled to jollity once
more,<br>
Some from off the ocean and the rest from off the shore.<br>
A year has passed since last we met and all are safe and
sound,<br>
Then let us banish all our cares and join our hands all
round.<br>
Christmas, happy Christmas! let us pass the flowing bowl,<br>
Fill your glasses all, and let's make "Sails" a wee bit full.<br>
For all I'll say is this&mdash;that it's in his country's
cause;<br>
If he staggers just a little, it is in his country's cause.</p>
<p class="quote">Now you sailor boys shall hear about the time we
have gone through:<br>
The winter&mdash;well, it wasn't long, we had so much to do.<br>
There was digging snow, and sleeping&mdash;you can bet we're good
at that&mdash;<br>
And eating, too&mdash;no wonder that we're all a little fat.<br>
We had hot cakes for our breakfast and "hermetik" each day,<br>
Mutton pies, ragouts and curries, for that is Lindstr&ouml;m's
way.<br>
But all I'll say is this&mdash;that 'twas in our country's
cause,<br>
If we stuffed ourselves with dainties, it was in our country's
cause.</p>
<p class="quote">September came and off we went&mdash;that trip
was pretty tough;<br>
Our compasses all went on strike, they thought it cold
enough.<br>
The brandy in the Captain's flask froze to a lump of ice;<br>
We all agreed, both men and dogs, such weather wasn't nice.<br>
So back we went to Framheim to thaw our heels and toes;<br>
It could not be quite healthy when our feet and fingers
froze.<br>
But all I say is this&mdash;that 'twas in our country's
cause,<br>
And we did not mind a frost-bite when 'twas in our country's
cause.</p>
<p class="quote">The sun came up and warmed us then a little day
by day;<br>
Five men went out again and toiled along the southern way.<br>
This time they conquered snow and ice, and all the world may
hear<br>
That Norway's flag flies at the Pole. Now, boys, a ringing
cheer<br>
For him who led them forward through the mountains and the
plain,<br>
Up to the goal they aimed at, and safely back again.<br>
But all I'll say is this&mdash;that 'twas in his country's
cause;<br>
If he went through and won the Pole, 'twas in his country's
cause.</p>
<br>
<p>It could soon be noticed, in one way and another, that we had
reached latitudes where existence took a very different aspect
from what we had been accustomed to south of the 66th parallel.
One welcome change was the rise in temperature; the mercury now
climbed well above freezing-point, and those individuals on board
who were still more or less clad in skins, shed the last remnants
of their Polar garb for a lighter and more convenient costume.
Those who waited longest before making the change were the ones
who belonged to the shore party. The numerous people who imagine
that a long stay in the Polar regions makes a man less
susceptible of cold than other mortals are completely mistaken.
The direct opposite is more likely to be the case. A man who
stays some time in a place where the everyday temperature is down
in the fifties below zero, or more than that, will not trouble
himself greatly about the cold, so long as he has good and
serviceable skin clothing. Let the same man, rigged out in
civilized clothes, be suddenly put down in the streets of
Christiania on a winter day, with thirty or thirty-five degrees
of frost, and the poor fellow's teeth will chatter till they fall
out of his mouth. The fact is, that on a Polar trip one defends
oneself effectively against the cold; when one comes back, and
has to go about with the protection afforded by an overcoat, a
stiff collar, and a hard hat&mdash;well, then one feels it.</p>
<p>A less welcome consequence of the difference in latitude was
the darkening of the nights. It may be admitted that continual
daylight would be unpleasant in the long run ashore, but aboard
ship an everlasting day would certainly be preferred, if such a
thing could be had. Even if we might now consider that we had
done with the principal mass of Antarctic ice, we still had to
reckon with its disagreeable outposts&mdash;the icebergs. It has
already been remarked that a practised look-out man can see the
blink of one of the larger bergs a long way off in the dark, but
when it is a question of one of the smaller masses of ice, of
which only an inconsiderable part rises above the surface, there
is no such brightness, and therefore no warning. A little lump
like this is just as dangerous as a big berg; you run the same
risks in a possible collision of knocking a hole in the bows or
carrying away the rigging. In these transitional regions, where
the temperature of the water is always very low, the thermometer
is a very doubtful guide.</p>
<p>The waters in which we were sailing are not yet so well known
as to exclude the possibility of meeting with land. Captain
Colbeck, who commanded one of the relief ships sent south during
Scott's first expedition, came quite unexpectedly upon a little
island to the east of Cape Adare; this island was afterwards
named after Captain Scott. When Captain Colbeck made his
discovery, he was about on the course that has usually been taken
by ships whose destination was within the limits of Ross Sea.
There is still a possibility that in going out of one's course,
voluntarily or involuntarily, one may find more groups of islands
in that part.</p>
<p>On the current charts of the South Pacific there are marked
several archipelagoes and islands, the position of which is not a
little doubtful. One of these&mdash;Emerald Island&mdash;is
charted as lying almost directly in the course we had to follow
to reach Hobart. Captain Davis, who took Shackleton's ship, the
<i>Nimrod</i>, home to England in 1909, sailed, however, right
over the point where Emerald Island should be found according to
the chart without seeing anything of it. If it exists at all, it
is, at any rate, incorrectly charted. In order to avoid its
vicinity, and still more in order to get as far as possible to
the west before we came into the westerly belt proper, we pressed
on as much as we could for one hard week, or perhaps nearer two;
but a continual north-west wind seemed for a long time to leave
us only two disagreeable possibilities, either of drifting to the
eastward, or of finding ourselves down in the drift-ice to the
north of Wilkes Land.</p>
<p>Those weeks were a very severe trial of patience to the many
on board who were burning with eagerness to get ashore with our
news, and perhaps to hear some in return. When the first three
weeks of February were past, we were not much more than half-way;
with anything like favourable conditions we ought to have arrived
by that time. The optimists always consoled us by saying that
sooner or later there would be a change for the better, and at
last it came. A good spell of favourable wind took us at a bound
well to the windward both of the doubtful Emerald Island and of
the authentic Macquarie group to the north of it. It may be
mentioned in passing, that at the time we went by, the most
southerly wireless telegraphy station in the world was located on
one of the Macquarie Islands. The installation belonged to Dr.
Mawson's Antarctic expedition. Dr. Mawson also took with him
apparatus for installing a station on the Antarctic Continent
itself, but, so far as is known, no connection was accomplished
the first year.</p>
<p>During this fortunate run we had come so far to the west that
our course to Hobart was rapidly approaching true north. On the
other hand, we should have liked to be able to take advantage of
the prevailing winds,&mdash;the westerlies. These vary little
from one year to another, and we found them much the same as we
had been accustomed to before: frequent, stiff breezes from the
north-west, which generally held for about twelve hours, and then
veered to west or south-west. So long as the north-wester was
blowing, there was nothing to do but to lie to with shortened
sail; when the change of wind came, we made a few hours' progress
in the right direction. In this way we crept step by step
northward to our destination. It was slow enough, no doubt; but
every day the line of our course on the chart grew a little
longer, and towards the end of February the distance between us
and the southern point of Tasmania had shrunk to very modest
dimensions.</p>
<p>With the constant heavy westerly swell, the <i>Fram</i>, light
as she now was, surpassed herself in rolling, and that is indeed
saying a great deal. This rolling brought us a little damage to
the rigging, the gaff of the mainsail breaking; however, that
affair did not stop us long. The broken spar was quickly replaced
by a spare gaff.</p>
<p>Our hopes of arriving before the end of February came to
naught, and a quarter of March went by before our voyage was at
an end.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of March 4, we had our first glimpse of land;
but, as the weather was by no means clear and we had not been
able to determine our longitude with certainty for two days, we
were uncertain which point of Tasmania we had before us. To
explain the situation, a short description of the coast-line is
necessary. The southern angle of Tasmania runs out in three
promontories; off the easternmost of these, and only divided from
it by a very narrow channel, lies a steep and apparently
inaccessible island, called Tasman Island. It is, however,
accessible, for on the top of it&mdash;900 feet above the
sea&mdash;stands a lighthouse. The middle promontory is called
Tasman Head, and between this and the eastern one we have Storm
Bay, which forms the approach to Hobart; there, then, lay our
course. The question was, which of the three heads we had
sighted. This was difficult, or rather impossible, to decide, so
indistinct was the outline of the land in the misty air; it was
also entirely unknown to us, as not one of us had ever before
been in this corner of the world. When darkness came on, a heavy
rain set in, and without being able to see anything at all, we
lay there feeling our way all night. With the appearance of
daylight a fresh south-west wind came and swept away most of the
rain, so that we could again make out the land. We decided that
what we saw was the middle promontory, Tasman Head, and gaily set
our course into Storm Bay&mdash;as we thought. With the rapidly
strengthening breeze we went spinningly, and the possibility of
reaching Hobart in a few hours began to appear as a dead
certainty. With this comfortable feeling we had just sat down to
the breakfast table in the fore-saloon, when the door was pulled
open with what seemed unnecessary violence, and the face of the
officer of the watch appeared in the doorway. "We're on the wrong
side of the head," was the sinister message, and the face
disappeared. Good-bye to our pleasant plans, good-bye to our
breakfast! All hands went on deck at once, and it was seen only
too well that the melancholy information was correct. We had made
a mistake in the thick rain. The wind, that had now increased to
a stiff breeze, had chased the rain-clouds from the tops of the
hills, and on the point we had taken for Tasman Head, we now saw
the lighthouse. It was therefore Tasman Island, and instead of
being in Storm Bay, we were out in the open Pacific, far to
leeward of the infamous headland. There was nothing to be done
but to beat and attempt to work our way back to windward,
although we knew it would be practically labour in vain. The
breeze increased to a gale, and instead of making any headway we
had every prospect of drifting well to leeward; that was the
usual result of trying to beat with the <i>Fram</i>. Rather
annoyed though we were, we set to work to do what could be done,
and with every square foot of canvas set the <i>Fram</i> pitched
on her way close-hauled. To begin with, it looked as if we held
our own more or less, but as the distance from land increased and
the wind got more force, our bearings soon showed us that we were
going the way the hen kicks. About midday we went about and stood
in towards land again; immediately after came a violent squall
which tore the outer jib to ribbons; with that we were also
obliged to take in the mainsail, otherwise it would pretty soon
have been caught aback, and there would have been further damage
to the rigging. With the remaining sails any further attempt was
useless; there was nothing left but to get as close under the lee
of the land as we could and try with the help of the engine to
hold our own till the weather moderated. How it blew that
afternoon! One gust after another came dancing down the slopes of
the hills, and tore at the rigging till the whole vessel shook.
The feeling on board was, as might be expected, somewhat sultry,
and found an outlet in various expressions the reverse of gentle.
Wind, weather, fate, and life in general were inveighed against,
but this availed little. The peninsula that separated us from
Storm Bay still lay there firm and immovable, and the gale went
on as if it was in no hurry to let us get round. The whole day
went by, and the greater part of the night, without any change
taking place. Not till the morning of the 6th did our prospects
begin to improve. The wind became lighter and went more to the
south; that was, of course, the way we had to go, but by hugging
the shore, where we had perfectly smooth water, we succeeded in
working our way down to Tasman Island before darkness fell. The
night brought a calm, and that gave us our chance. The engine
worked furiously, and a slight favourable current contributed to
set us on our way. By dawn on the 7th we were far up Storm Bay
and could at last consider ourselves masters of the
situation.</p>
<p>It was a sunny day, and our faces shone in rivalry with the
sun; all trace of the last two days' annoyances had vanished. And
soon the <i>Fram</i>, too, began to shine. The white paint on
deck had a thorough overhauling with soap and water in strong
solution. The Ripolin was again as fresh as when new. When this
had been seen to, the outward appearance of the men also began to
undergo a striking change. The Iceland jackets and "blanket
costumes" from Horten gave way to "shore clothes" of the most
varied cut, hauled out after a two years' rest; razors and
scissors had made a rich harvest, and sailmaker R&ouml;nne's
fashionable Burberry caps figured on most heads. Even
Lindstr&ouml;m, who up to date had held the position among the
land party of being its heaviest, fattest, and blackest member,
showed unmistakable signs of having been in close contact with
water.</p>
<p>Meanwhile we were nearing a pilot station, and a bustling
little motor launch swung alongside. "Want a pilot, captain?" One
positively started at the sound of the first new human voice.
Communication with the outer world was again established. The
pilot&mdash;a brisk, good-humoured old man&mdash;looked about him
in surprise when he came up on to our deck. "I should never have
imagined things were so clean and bright on board a Polar ship,"
he said; "nor should I have thought from the look of you that you
had come from Antarctica. You look as if you had had nothing but
a good time." We could assure him of that, but as to the rest, it
was not our intention just yet to allow ourselves to be pumped,
and the old man could see that. He had no objection to our
pumping him, though he had no very great store of news to give
us. He had heard nothing of the <i>Terra Nova</i>; on the other
hand, he was able to tell us that Dr. Mawson's ship, the
<i>Aurora</i>, commanded by Captain Davis, might be expected at
Hobart any day. They had been looking out for the <i>Fram</i>
since the beginning of February, and had given us up long ago.
That was a surprise, anyhow.</p>
<p>Our guest evidently had no desire to make the acquaintance of
our cuisine; at any rate, he very energetically declined our
invitation to breakfast. Presumably he was afraid of being
treated to dog's flesh or similar original dishes. On the other
hand, he showed great appreciation of our Norwegian tobacco. He
had his handbag pretty nearly full when he left us.</p>
<p>Hobart Town lies on the bank of the Derwent River, which runs
into Storm Bay. The surroundings are beautiful, and the soil
evidently extremely fertile; but woods and fields were almost
burnt up on our arrival; a prolonged drought had prevailed, and
made an end of all green things. To our eyes it was, however, an
unmixed delight to look upon meadows and woods, even if their
colours were not absolutely fresh. We were not very difficult to
please on that score.</p>
<p>The harbour of Hobart is an almost ideal one, large and
remarkably well protected. As we approached the town, the usual
procession of harbour-master, doctor, and Custom-house officers
came aboard. The doctor soon saw that there was no work for his
department, and the Custom-house officers were easily convinced
that we had no contraband goods. The anchor was dropped, and we
were free to land. I took my cablegrams, and accompanied the
harbour-master ashore.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV<br>
<br>
<small>THE EASTERN SLEDGE JOURNEY<br>
<br>
<i>By Lieutenant K. Prestrud</i></small></h3>
<p><small>ON</small> October 20, 1911, the southern party started
on their long journey. The departure took place without much
ceremony, and with the smallest possible expenditure of words. A
hearty grasp of the hand serves the purpose quite as well on such
occasions. I accompanied them to the place we called the
starting-point, on the south side of the bay. After a final "Good
luck" to our Chief and comrades&mdash;as sincere a wish as I have
ever bestowed upon anyone&mdash;I cinematographed the caravan,
and very soon after it was out of sight. Those fellows went
southward at a great pace, Helmer Hanssen's quick-footed team
leading as usual.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Image85" id="Image85"></a><img alt=""

<br>
<small>LIEUTENANT PRESTRUD.</small></p>
<br>
<p>There I stood, utterly alone, and I cannot deny that I was a
prey to somewhat mixed feelings. When should we see those five
again, who had just disappeared from view on the boundless plain,
and in what conditions? What sort of a report would they bring of
the result? There was plenty of room for guesses here, and
abundant opportunity for weighing every possibility, good and
bad; but there was very little to be gained by indulging in
speculations of that sort. The immediate facts first claimed
attention. One fact, amongst others, was that Framheim was a good
three miles away; another was that the cinematograph apparatus
weighed a good many pounds; and a third that Lindstr&ouml;m would
be mightily put out if I arrived too late for dinner. Our
<i>chef</i> insisted on a high standard of punctuality in the
matter of meal-times. Homeward, then, at the best speed possible.
The speed, however, was not particularly good, and I began to
prepare for the consequences of a long delay. On the other side
of the bay I could just make out a little black speck, that
seemed to be in motion towards me. I thought at first it was a
seal, but, fortunately, it turned out to be J&ouml;rgen Stubberud
with six dogs and a sledge. This was quite encouraging: in the
first place, I should get rid of my unmanageable burden, and in
the second I might expect to get on faster. Stubberud's team
consisted, however, of four intractable puppies, besides Puss and
another courser of similar breed; the result was that our pace
was a modest one and our course anything but straight, so that we
arrived at Framheim two hours after the time appointed for
dinner. Those who know anything of Master Lindstr&ouml;m and his
disposition will easily be able from this explanation to form an
idea of his state of mind at the moment when we entered the door.
Yes, he was undoubtedly angry, but we were at least equally
hungry; and if anything can soften the heart of a Norwegian
caterer, it is a ravenous appetite in those he has to feed,
provided, of course, that he have enough to offer them, and
Lindstr&ouml;m's supplies were practically unlimited.</p>
<p>I remember that dinner well: at the same table where eight of
us had sat for so many months, there were now only three
left&mdash;Johansen, Stubberud, and I. We had more room, it is
true, but that gain was a poor satisfaction. We missed those who
had gone very badly, and our thoughts were always following them.
The first thing we discussed on this occasion was how many miles
they might be expected to do that day: nor was this the last
dispute we had on the same theme. During the weeks and months
that followed, it was constantly to the fore, and gave plenty of
material for conversation when we had exhausted our own concerns.
As regards these latter, my instructions were</p>
<p>1. To go to King Edward VII. Land, and there carry out what
exploration time and circumstances might permit.</p>
<p>2. To survey and map the Bay of Whales and its immediate
surroundings.</p>
<p>3. As far as possible to keep the station at Framheim in
order, in case we might have to spend another winter there.</p>
<p>As regards time, my orders were to be back at Framheim before
we could reasonably expect the arrival of the <i>Fram</i>. This
was, and would necessarily remain, somewhat uncertain. No doubt
we all had a great idea of the <i>Fram</i>'s capacity for keeping
time, and Lieutenant Nilsen had announced his intention of being
back by Christmas or the New Year; but nevertheless a year is a
long time, and there are many miles in a trip round the world. If
we assumed that no mishap had occurred to the <i>Fram</i>, and
that she had left Buenos Aires at the time fixed in the
plan&mdash;October 1, 1911&mdash;she would in all probability be
able to arrive at the Bay of Whales about the middle of January,
1912. On the basis of this calculation we decided, if possible,
to get the sledge journey to King Edward Land done before
Christmas, while the surveying work around the bay would have to
be postponed to the first half of January, 1912. I thought,
however, seeing the advantages of working while the bay was still
frozen over, that it would pay to devote a few
days&mdash;immediately following the departure of the southern
party&mdash;to the preparatory work of measuring. But this did
not pay at all. We had reckoned without the weather, and in
consequence were well taken in. When one thinks over it
afterwards, it seems reasonable enough that the final victory of
mild weather over the remains of the Antarctic winter cannot be
accomplished without serious disturbances of the atmospheric
conditions. The expulsion of one evil has to be effected by the
help of another; and the weather was bad with a vengeance. During
the two weeks that followed October 20 there were only three or
four days that offered any chance of working with the theodolite
and plane-table. We managed to get a base-line measured, 1,000
metres long, and to lay out the greater part of the east side of
the bay, as well as the most prominent points round the camp; but
one had positively to snatch one's opportunities by stealth, and
every excursion ended regularly in bringing the instruments home
well covered with snow.</p>
<p>If the bad weather thus put hindrances in the way of the work
we were anxious to do, it made up for it by providing us with a
lot of extra work which we could very well have done without.
There was incessant shovelling of snow to keep any sort of
passage open to the four dog-tents that were left standing, as
well as to our own underground dwelling, over which the snow
covering had been growing constantly higher. The fairly high wall
that we had originally built on the east side of the entrance
door was now entirely buried in the snow-drift. It had given us
good protection; now the drift had unimpeded access, and the
opening, like the descent into a cellar, that led down to the
door, was filled up in the course of a few hours when the wind
was in the right quarter. Lindstr&ouml;m shook his head when we
sometimes asked him how he would get on by himself if the weather
continued in this way. "So long as there's nothing but snow in
the way, I'll manage to get out," said he. One day he came and
told us that he could no longer get at the coal, and on further
investigation it looked rather difficult. The roof of the place
where the coal was stored had yielded to the pressure of the mass
of snow, and the whole edifice had collapsed. There was nothing
to be done but to set to work at once, and after a great deal of
hard labour we got the remainder of the precious fuel moved into
the long snow tunnel that led from the house to the coal-store.
With that our "black diamonds" were in safety for the time being.
This job made us about as black as the "diamonds." When we came
in the cook, as it happened, had just been doing a big wash on
his own account&mdash;a comparatively rare event&mdash;and there
was surprise on both sides. The cook was as much taken aback at
seeing us so black as we were at seeing him so clean.</p>
<p>All the snow-shovelling that resulted from the continued bad
weather, in conjunction with the necessary preparations for the
sledge journey, gave us plenty of occupation, but I will venture
to say that none of us would care to go through those days again.
We were delayed in our real work, and delay, which is unpleasant
enough in any circumstances, was all the more unwelcome down
here, where time is so precious. As we only had two sledges on
which to transport supplies for three men and sixteen dogs,
besides all our outfit, and as on our trip we should have no
depots to fall back on, the duration of the journey could not be
extended much beyond six weeks. In order to be back again by
Christmas, we had, therefore, to leave before the middle of
November. It would do no harm, however, to be off before this,
and as soon as November arrived we took the first opportunity of
disappearing.</p>
<p>On account of getting on the right course, we preferred that
the start should take place in clear weather. The fact was that
we were obliged to go round by the depot in 80&deg; S. As King
Edward Land lies to the east, or rather north-east, of Framheim,
this was a considerable detour; it had to be made, because in
September we had left at this depot all the packed sledging
provisions, a good deal of our personal equipment, and, finally,
some of the necessary instruments.</p>
<p>On the way to the depot, about thirty geographical miles south
of Framheim, we had the nasty crevassed surface that had been met
with for the first time on the third depot journey in the autumn
of 1911&mdash;in the month of April. At that time we came upon it
altogether unawares, and it was somewhat remarkable that we
escaped from it with the loss of two dogs. This broken surface
lay in a depression about a mile to the west of the route
originally marked out; but, however it may have been, it seems
ever since that time to have exercised an irresistible
attraction. On our first attempt to go south, in September, 1911,
we came right into the middle of it, in spite of the fact that it
was then perfectly clear. I afterwards heard that in spite of all
their efforts, the southern party, on their last trip, landed in
this dangerous region, and that one man had a very narrow escape
of falling in with sledge and dogs. I had no wish to expose
myself to the risk of such accidents&mdash;at any rate, while we
were on familiar ground. That would have been a bad beginning to
my first independent piece of work as a Polar explorer. A day or
two of fine weather to begin with would enable us to follow the
line originally marked out, and thus keep safe ground under our
feet until the ugly place was passed.</p>
<p>In the opening days of November the weather conditions began
to improve somewhat; in any case, there was not the continual
driving snow. Lindstr&ouml;m asked us before we left to bring up
a sufficient quantity of seals, to save him that work as long as
possible. The supply we had had during the winter was almost
exhausted; there was only a certain amount of blubber left. We
thought it only fair to accede to his wish, as it is an awkward
business to transport those heavy beasts alone, especially when
one has only a pack of unbroken puppies to drive. We afterwards
heard that Lindstr&ouml;m had some amusing experiences with them
during the time he was left alone.</p>
<p>Leaving the transport out of the question, this seal-hunting
is a very tame sport. An old Arctic hand or an Eskimo would
certainly be astounded to see the placid calm with which the
Antarctic seal allows itself to be shot and cut up. To them
Antarctica would appear as a fairyland made real, a land flowing
with milk and honey, where seals are to he found in quantities,
and the difficulty of getting at them is reduced to <i>nil</i>.
The fact is that these animals have once for all acquired the
conviction that they are beyond the reach of any danger so long
as they keep on land or on the ice. There they have never been
attacked, and they are quite incapable of grasping the
possibility of attack. Their natural enemies are in the water,
and these enemies are not to be trifled with; that can clearly be
seen from the gaping wounds that are often found on the seals'
bodies. To avoid the attacks of these enemies the seals have only
to get on to the ice, where for generations they have been
accustomed to bask in the sun undisturbed, without other
neighbours than the, to them, perfectly harmless penguins and
skua gulls.</p>
<p>The sudden appearance of a man on the scene will therefore at
first have very little effect on an Antarctic seal. One can go
right up to it without its doing anything but staring with eyes
that reflect a perfectly hopeless failure to comprehend the
seriousness of the situation. It is only when one touches them
with a ski-pole or something of the sort that they begin to fear
danger. If the stirring-up is continued in a rather more pointed
fashion, the seal soon shows the most manifest signs of terror.
It groans, roars, and at the same time makes an attempt to get
away from its unwelcome visitor; but it seldom removes itself
many yards at a time, for the motions of the seal are just as
clumsy and slow on land as they are active and swift in the
water. When it has crawled with great pains to a little distance,
there is no sign that the interruption has made any lasting
impression on it. It looks more as if it took it all as an
unpleasant dream or nightmare, which it would be best to sleep
off as soon as possible. If one shoots a single seal, this may
happen without those lying round so much as raising their heads.
Indeed, we could open and cut up a seal right before the noses of
its companions without this making the slightest impression on
them.</p>

<br>
<small>AN ORIGINAL INHABITANT OF THE ANTARCTIC.</small></p>
<br>
<p>About the beginning of November the seals began to have their
young. So far as we could make out, the females kept out of the
water for several days without taking any food, until the young
one was big enough to be able to go to sea; otherwise, it did not
seem that the mothers cared very much for their little ones.
Some, it is true, made a sort of attempt to protect their
offspring if they were disturbed, but the majority simply left
their young ones in the lurch.</p>
<p>As far as we were concerned, we left the females and their
young as much as possible in peace. We killed two or three
new-born seals to get the skins for our collection. It was
another matter with the dogs. With them seal-hunting was far too
favourite a sport for the opportunity to be neglected. Against a
full-grown seal, however, they could do nothing; its body offered
no particularly vulnerable spots, and the thick, tight-fitting
skin was too much even for dogs' teeth. The utmost the rascals
could accomplish was to annoy and torment the object of their
attack. It was quite another matter when the young ones began to
arrive. Among this small game the enterprising hunters could
easily satisfy their inborn craving for murder, for the
scoundrels only killed for the sake of killing; they were not at
all hungry, as they had as much food as they liked. Of course, we
did all we could to put a stop to this state of things, and so
long as there were several of us at the hut, we saw that the
whole pack was tied up; but when Lindstr&ouml;m was left by
himself, he could not manage to hold them fast. His tents were
altogether snowed under in the weather that prevailed on the
seaboard in December. There were not many dogs left in his
charge, but I am afraid those few wrought great havoc among the
young seals out on the ice of the bay. The poor mothers could
hardly have done anything against a lot of dogs, even if they had
been more courageous. Their enemies were too active. For them it
was the work of a moment to snatch the young one from the side of
its mother, and then they were able to take the poor thing's life
undisturbed.</p>

<br>
<small>STUBBERUD REVIEWS THE SITUATION.</small></p>
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, there were no sea-leopards in the neighbourhood
of Framheim. These, which are far quicker in their movements than
the Weddell seal, and are, moreover, furnished with a formidable
set of teeth, would certainly have made the four-footed
seal-hunters more careful in their behaviour.</p>
<p>After we had brought up to the house enough seals' carcasses
to keep the ten or twelve dogs that would be left supplied for a
good while, and had cut up a sufficient quantity for our own use
on the way to 80&deg; S., we took the first opportunity of
getting away. Before I pass on to give an account of our trip, I
wish to say a few words about my companions&mdash;Johansen and
Stubberud. It goes without saying that it gave me, as a beginner,
a great feeling of security to have with me such a man as
Johansen, who possessed many years' experience of all that
pertains to sledging expeditions; and as regards Stubberud, I
could not have wished for a better travelling companion than him
either&mdash;a first-rate fellow, steady and efficient in word
and deed. As it turned out, we were not to encounter very many
difficulties, but one never escapes scot-free on a sledge journey
in these regions. I owe my comrades thanks for the way in which
they both did their best to smooth our path.</p>
<p>Johansen and Stubberud drove their dog-teams; I myself acted
as "forerunner." The drivers had seven dogs apiece. We took so
many, because we were not quite sure of what the animals we had
were fit for. As was right and proper, the southern party had
picked out the best. Among those at our disposal there were
several that had previously shown signs of being rather quickly
tired. True, this happened under very severe conditions. As it
turned out, our dogs exceeded all our expectations in the easier
conditions of work that prevailed during the summer. On the first
part of the way&mdash;as far as the depot in 80&deg; S.&mdash;the
loads were quite modest. Besides the tent, the sleeping-bags, our
personal outfit, and instruments, we only had provisions for
eight days-seals' flesh for the dogs, and tinned food for
ourselves. Our real supplies were to be taken from the depot,
where there was enough of everything.</p>
<p>On November 8 we left Framheim, where in future Lindstr&ouml;m
was to reside as monarch of all he surveyed. The weather was as
fine as could be wished. I was out with the cinematograph
apparatus, in order if possible to immortalize the start. To
complete the series of pictures, Lindstr&ouml;m was to take the
forerunner, who was now, be it said, a good way behind those he
was supposed to be leading. With all possible emphasis I enjoined
Lindstr&ouml;m only to give the crank five or six turns, and then
started off to catch up the drivers. When I had nearly reached
the provision store I pulled up, struck by a sudden apprehension.
Yes, I was right on looking back I discovered that incorrigible
person still hard at work with the crank, as though he were going
to be paid a pound for every yard of film showing the back view
of the forerunner. By making threatening gestures with a ski-pole
I stopped the too persistent cinematograph, and then went on to
join Stubberud, who was only a few yards ahead. Johansen had
disappeared like a meteor. The last I saw of him was the soles of
his boots, as he quite unexpectedly made an elegant backward
somersault off the sledge when it was passing over a little
unevenness by the provision store. The dogs, of course, made off
at full speed, and Johansen after them like the wind. We all met
again safe and sound at the ascent to the Barrier. Here a proper
order of march was formed, and we proceeded southward.</p>
<p>The Barrier greeted us with a fresh south wind, that now and
then made an attempt to freeze the tip of one's nose; it did not
succeed in this, but it delayed us a little. It does not take a
great deal of wind on this level plain to diminish the rate of
one's progress. But the sun shone too gaily that day to allow a
trifle of wind to interfere very much with our enjoyment of life.
The surface was so firm that there was hardly a sign of
drift-snow. As it was perfectly clear, the mark-flags could be
followed the whole time, thus assuring us that, at any rate, the
first day's march would be accomplished without any deviation
from the right track.</p>
<p>At five o'clock we camped, and when we had fed the dogs and
come into the tent we could feel how much easier and pleasanter
everything was at this season than on the former journeys in
autumn and spring. We could move freely in a convenient costume;
if we wished, there was nothing to prevent our performing all the
work of the camp with bare hands and still preserving our
finger-tips unharmed. As I had no dog-team to look after, I
undertook the duty of attending to our own needs; that is to say,
I acted as cook. This occupation also was considerably easier now
than it had been when the temperature was below -60&deg; F. At
that time it took half an hour to turn the snow in the cooker
into water; now it was done in ten minutes, and the cook ran no
risk whatever of getting his fingers frozen in the process.</p>
<p>Ever since we landed on the Barrier in January, 1911, we had
been expecting to hear a violent cannonade as the result of the
movement of the mass of ice. We had now lived a whole winter at
Framheim without having observed, as far as I know, the slightest
sign of a sound. This was one of many indications that the ice
round our winter-quarters was not in motion at all.</p>
<p>No one, I believe, had noticed anything of the expected noise
on the sledge journeys either, but at the place where we camped
on the night of November 8 we did hear it. There was a report
about once in two minutes, not exactly loud, but still, there it
was. It sounded just as if there was a whole battery of small
guns in action down in the depths below us. A few hundred yards
to the west of the camp there were a number of small hummocks,
which might indicate the presence of crevasses, but otherwise the
surface looked safe enough. The small guns kept up a lively
crackle all through the night, and combined with a good deal of
uproar among the dogs to shorten our sleep. But the first night
of a sledge journey is almost always a bad one. Stubberud
declared that he could not close his eyes on account of "that
filthy row." He probably expected the ice to open and swallow him
up every time he heard it. The surface, however, held securely,
and we turned out to the finest day one could wish to see. It did
not require any very great strength of mind to get out of one's
sleeping-bag now. The stockings that had been hung up in the
evening could be put on again as dry as a bone; the sun had seen
to that. Our ski boots were as soft as ever; there was not a sign
of frost on them. It is quite curious to see the behaviour of the
dogs when the first head appears through the tent-door in the
morning. They greet their lord and master with the most
unmistakable signs of joy, although, of course, they must know
that his arrival will be followed by many hours of toil, with,
perhaps, a few doses of the whip thrown in; but from the moment
he begins to handle the sledge, the dogs look as if they had no
desire in the world but to get into the harness as soon as
possible and start away. On days like this their troubles would
be few; with the light load and good going we had no difficulty
in covering nineteen geographical miles in eight hours.
Johansen's team was on my heels the whole time, and Stubberud's
animals followed faithfully behind. From time to time we saw
sledge-tracks quite plainly; we also kept the mark-flags in sight
all day. In the temperatures we now had to deal with our costume
was comparatively light&mdash;certainly much lighter than most
people imagine; for there is a kind of summer even in Antarctica,
although the daily readings of the thermometer at this season
would perhaps rather remind our friends at home of what they are
accustomed to regard as winter.</p>
<p>In undertaking a sledge journey down there in autumn or
spring, the most extraordinary precautions have to be taken to
protect oneself against the cold. Skin clothing is then the only
thing that is of any use; but at this time of year, when the sun
is above the horizon for the whole twenty-four hours, one can go
for a long time without being more heavily clad than a lumberman
working in the woods. During the march our clothing was usually
the following: two sets of woollen underclothes, of which that
nearest the skin was quite thin. Outside the shirt we wore either
an ordinary waistcoat or a comparatively light knitted woollen
jersey. Outside all came our excellent Burberry
clothes&mdash;trousers and jacket. When it was calm, with full
sunshine, the Burberry jacket was too warm; we could then go all
day in our shirt-sleeves. To be provided for emergencies, we all
had our thinnest reindeer-skin clothes with us; but, so far as I
know, these were never used, except as pillows or mattresses.</p>
<p>The subject of sleeping-bags has no doubt been thoroughly
threshed out on every Polar expedition. I do not know how many
times we discussed this question, nor can I remember the number
of more or less successful patents that were the fruit of these
discussions. In any case, one thing is certain, that the
adherents of one-man bags were in an overwhelming majority, and
no doubt rightly. As regards two-man bags, it cannot be denied
that they enable their occupants to keep warm longer; but it is
always difficult to find room for two big men in one sack, and if
the sack is to be used for sleeping in, and one of the big men
takes to snoring into the other's ear, the situation may become
quite unendurable. In the temperatures we had on the summer
journeys there was no difficulty in keeping warm enough with the
one-man bags, and they were used by all of us.</p>
<p>On the first southern journey, in September, Johansen and I
used a double bag between us; in the intense cold that prevailed
at that time we managed to get through the night without
freezing; but if the weather is so cold that one cannot keep
warmth in one's body in good, roomy one-man bags, then it is
altogether unfit for sledging journeys.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 10.&mdash;Immediately after the start this
morning we tried how we could get on without a forerunner. As
long as we were in the line of flags this answered very well; the
dogs galloped from one flag to another, while I was able to adopt
the easy method of hanging on to Stubberud's sledge. About midday
we were abreast of the depression already mentioned, where, on
the third depot journey last autumn, we ran into a regular net of
crevasses. This time we were aware of the danger, and kept to the
left; but at the last moment the leading team ran out to the
wrong side, and we cut across the eastern part of the dangerous
zone. Fortunately it was taken at full gallop. It is quite
possible that I inwardly wished we were all a few pounds lighter,
as our little caravan raced across those thin snow bridges,
through which could be seen the blue colour of the ugly gulfs
below. But after the lapse of a few long minutes we could
congratulate ourselves on getting over with our full numbers.</p>
<p>Not for anything would I have gone that mile without ski on my
feet; it would practically have meant falling in and going out.
It is, perhaps, saying a good deal to claim that with ski on, one
is absolutely secured against the danger these crevasses present;
if misfortunes are abroad, anything may happen. But it would
require a very considerable amount of bad luck for man and ski to
fall through.</p>

<br>
<p><i>November</i> 11.&mdash;In weather like this, going on the
march is like going to a dance: tent, sleeping-bags, and clothes
keep soft and dry as a bone. The thermometer is about -4&deg; F.
A fellow-man suddenly put down in our midst from civilized
surroundings would possibly shake his head at so many degrees of
frost, but it must be remembered that we have long ago abandoned
the ordinary ideas of civilized people as to what is endurable in
the way of temperature. We are enthusiastic about the spring-like
weather, especially when we remember what it was like down here
two months ago, when the thermometer showed -76&deg; F., and the
rime hung an inch thick inside the tent, ready to drop on
everything and everybody at the slightest movement. Now there is
no rime to be seen; the sun clears it away. For now there is a
sun; not the feeble imitation of one that stuck its red face
above the northern horizon in August, but our good old
acquaintance of lower latitudes, with his wealth of light and
warmth.</p>
<p>After two hours' march we came in sight, at ten o'clock in the
morning, of the two snow-huts that were built on the last trip.
We made straight for them, thinking we might possibly find some
trace of the southern party. So we did, though in a very
different way from what we expected. We were, perhaps, about a
mile off when we all three suddenly halted and stared at the
huts. "There are men," said Stubberud. At any rate there was
something black that moved, and after confused thoughts of
Japanese, Englishmen, and the like had flashed through our minds,
we at last got out the glasses. It was not men, but a dog. Well,
the presence of a live dog here, seventy-five miles up the
Barrier, was in itself a remarkable thing. It must, of course, be
one of the southern party's dogs, but how the runaway had kept
himself alive all that time was for the present a mystery. On
coming to closer quarters we soon found that it was one of
Hassel's dogs, Peary by name. He was a little shy to begin with,
but when he heard his name he quickly understood that we were
friends come on a visit, and no longer hesitated to approach us.
He was fat and round, and evidently pleased to see us again. The
hermit had lived on the lamentable remains of poor Sara, whom we
had been obliged to kill here in September. Sara's lean and
frozen body did not seem particularly adapted for making anyone
fat, and yet our newly-found friend Peary looked as if he had
been feasting for weeks. Possibly he had begun by devouring
Neptune, another of his companions, who had also given the
southern party the slip on the way to the depot in 80&deg; S.
However this may be, Peary's rest cure came to an abrupt
conclusion. Stubberud took him and put him in his team.</p>
<p>We had thought of reaching the depot before the close of the
day, and this we could easily have done if the good going had
continued; but during the afternoon the surface became so loose
that the dogs sank in up to their chests, and when&mdash;at about
six in the evening&mdash;the sledge-meter showed twenty-one
geographical miles, the animals were so done up that it was no
use going on.</p>
<p>At eleven o'clock the next morning&mdash;Sunday, November
12&mdash;we reached the depot. Captain Amundsen had promised to
leave a brief report when the southern party left here, and the
first thing we did on arrival was, of course, to search for the
document in the place agreed upon. There were not many words on
the little slip of paper, but they gave us the welcome
intelligence: "All well so far."</p>
<p>We had expected that the southern party's dogs would have
finished the greater part, if not the whole, of the seal meat
that was laid down here in April; but fortunately this was not
the case. There was a great quantity left, so that we could give
our own dogs a hearty feed with easy consciences. They had it,
too, and it was no trifling amount that they got through. The
four days' trot from Framheim had been enough to produce an
unusual appetite. There was a puppy in Johansen's team that was
exposed for the first time in his life to the fatigues of a
sledge journey. This was a plucky little chap that went by the
name of Lillegut. The sudden change from short commons to
abundance was too much for his small stomach, and the poor puppy
lay shrieking in the snow most of the afternoon.</p>
<p>We also looked after ourselves that day, and had a good meal
of fresh seal meat; after that we supplied ourselves from the
large stores that lay here with the necessary provisions for a
sledge journey of five weeks: three cases of dogs' pemmican, one
case of men's pemmican, containing ninety rations, 20 pounds of
dried milk, 55 pounds of oatmeal biscuits, and three tins of
malted milk, besides instruments, Alpine rope, and clothing. The
necessary quantity of chocolate had been brought with us from
Framheim, as there was none of this to spare out in the field.
Our stock of paraffin was 6&frac12; gallons, divided between two
tanks, one on each sledge. Our cooking outfit was exactly the
same as that used by the southern party.</p>
<p>The instruments we carried were a theodolite, a hypsometer,
two aneroids, one of which was no larger than an ordinary watch,
two thermometers, one chronometer watch, one ordinary watch, and
one photographic camera (Kodak 3 x 3 inches), adapted for using
either plates or films. We had three spools of film, and one
dozen plates.</p>
<p>Our medical outfit was exceedingly simple. It consisted of
nothing but a box of laxative pills, three small rolls of gauze
bandage, and a small pair of scissors, which also did duty for
beard-cutting. Both pills and gauze were untouched when we
returned; it may therefore be safely said that our state of
health during the journey was excellent.</p>
<p>While the drivers were packing and lashing their loads, which
now weighed nearly 600 pounds, I wrote a report to the Chief, and
took an azimuth observation to determine the direction of our
course. According to our instructions we should really have taken
a north-easterly course from here; but as our dogs seemed to be
capable of more and better work than we had expected, and as
there was believed to be a possibility that bare land was to be
found due east of the spot where we were, it was decided to make
an attempt in that direction.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Image89" id="Image89"></a><img alt=""

<br>
<small>OFF TO THE EAST.</small></p>
<br>
<p>Our old enemy the fog had made its appearance in the course of
the night, and now hung, grey and disgusting, under the sky, when
we broke camp at the depot on the morning of November 13.
However, it was not so bad as to prevent our following the flags
that marked the depot on the east.</p>
<p>My duty as forerunner was immediately found to be considerably
lighter than before. With the greatly increased weight behind
them the dogs had all they could do to follow, if I went at an
ordinary walking pace. At 11 a.m. we passed the easternmost flag,
at five geographical miles from the depot, and then we found
ourselves on untrodden ground. A light southerly breeze appeared
very opportunely and swept away the fog; the sun again shed its
light over the Barrier, which lay before us, shining and level,
as we had been accustomed to see it. There was, however, one
difference: with every mile we covered there was the possibility
of seeing something new. The going was excellent, although the
surface was rather looser than one could have wished. The ski
flew over it finely, of course, while dogs' feet and
sledge-runners sank in. I hope I shall never have to go here
without ski; that would be a terrible punishment; but with ski on
one's feet and in such weather it was pure enjoyment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the new sights we expected were slow in coming. We
marched for four days due east without seeing a sign of change in
the ground; there was the same undulating surface that we knew so
well from previous expeditions. The readings of the hypsometer
gave practically the same result day after day; the ascent we
were looking for failed to appear.</p>
<p>Stubberud, who for the first day or two after leaving the
depot had been constantly stretching himself on tiptoe and
looking out for mountain-tops, finally gave it as his heartfelt
conviction that this King Edward Land we were hunting for was
only a confounded "Flyaway Land," which had nothing to do with
reality. We others were not yet quite prepared to share this
view; for my own part, in any case, I was loth to give up the
theory that assumed a southward continuation of King Edward Land
along the 158th meridian; this theory had acquired a certain
force during the winter, and was mainly supported by the fact
that on the second depot journey we had seen, between the 81st
and 82nd parallels, some big pressure-ridges, which suggested the
presence of bare land in a south-easterly direction.</p>
<p>On November 16 we found ourselves at the 158th meridian, but
on every side the eye encountered the level, uninterrupted snow
surface and nothing else. Should we go on? It was tempting
enough, as the probability was that sooner or later we should
come upon something; but there was a point in our instructions
that had to be followed, and it said: Go to the point where land
is marked on the chart. This point was now about 120 geographical
miles to the north of us. Therefore, instead of going on to the
east in uncertainty, we decided to turn to the left and go north.
The position of the spot where we altered our course was
determined, and it was marked by a snow beacon 7 feet high, on
the top of which was placed a tin box containing a brief
report.</p>
<p>On that part of the way which we now had before us there was
little prospect of meeting with surprises; nor did any fall to
our lot. In day's marches that varied from seventeen to twenty
geographical miles, we went forward over practically level
ground. The nature of the surface was at first ideal; but as we
came farther north and thus nearer to the sea, our progress was
impeded by a great number of big snow-waves (<i>sastrugi</i>),
which had probably been formed during the long period of bad
weather that preceded our departure from Framheim. We did not
escape damage on this bad surface. Stubberud broke the forward
part of the spare ski he had lashed under his sledge, and
Johansen's sledge also suffered from the continual bumping
against the hard <i>sastrugi</i>. Luckily he had been foreseeing
enough to bring a little hickory bar, which came in very handy as
a splint for the broken part.</p>
<p>As we were now following the direction of the meridian, or in
other words, as our course was now true north, the daily
observations of latitude gave a direct check on the readings of
the sledge-meter. As a rule they agreed to the nearest minute.
Whilst I was taking the noon altitude my companions had the
choice of standing by the side of their sledges and eating their
lunch, or setting the tent and taking shelter. They generally
chose the latter alternative, making up for it by going an hour
longer in the afternoon. Besides the astronomical observations,
the barometric pressure, temperature, force and direction of the
wind, and amount of cloud were noted three times daily; every
evening a hypsometer reading was taken.</p>
<p>If I were to undertake the description of a long series of
days like those that passed while we were travelling on the flat
Barrier, I am afraid the narrative would be strikingly
reminiscent of the celebrated song of a hundred and twenty
verses, all with the same rhyme. One day was very much like
another. One would think that this monotony would make the time
long, but the direct opposite was the case. I have never known
time fly so rapidly as on these sledge journeys, and seldom have
I seen men more happy and contented with their existence than we
three, when after a successful day's march we could set about
taking our simple meal, with a pipe of cut plug to follow. The
bill of fare was identically the same every day, perhaps a fault
in the eyes of many; variety of diet is supposed to be the thing.
Hang variety, say I; appetite is what matters. To a man who is
really hungry it is a very subordinate matter what he shall eat;
the main thing is to have <i>something</i> to satisfy his
hunger.</p>
<p>After going north for seven days, we found that according to
observations and sledge-meter we ought to be in the neighbourhood
of the sea. This was correct. My diary for November 23 reads:</p>
<p>"To-day we were to see something besides sky and snow. An hour
after breaking camp this morning two snowy petrels came sailing
over us; a little while later a couple of skua gulls. We welcomed
them as the first living creatures we had seen since leaving
winter-quarters. The constantly increasing 'water-sky' to the
north had long ago warned us that we were approaching the sea;
the presence of the birds told us it was not far off. The skua
gulls settled very near us, and the dogs, no doubt taking them
for baby seals, were of course ready to break the line of march,
and go off hunting, but their keenness soon passed when they
discovered that the game had wings.</p>
<p>"The edge of the Barrier was difficult to see, and, profiting
by previous experience of how easy it is to go down when the
light is bad, we felt our way forward step by step. At four
o'clock we thought we could see the precipice. A halt was made at
a safe distance, and I went in advance to look over. To my
surprise I found that there was open water right in to the wall
of ice. We had expected the sea-ice to extend a good way out
still, seeing it was so early in summer; but there lay the sea,
almost free of ice as far as the horizon. Black and threatening
it was to look at, but still a beneficent contrast to the
everlasting snow surface on which we had now tramped for 300
geographical miles.</p>
<p>"The perpendicular drop of 100 feet that forms the boundary
between the dead Barrier and the sea, with its varied swarm of
life, is truly an abrupt and imposing transition. The panorama
from the top of the ice-wall is always grand, and it can be
beautiful as well. On a sunny day, or still more on a moonlit
night, it has a fairylike beauty. To-day a heavy, black sky hung
above a still blacker sea, and the ice-wall, which shines in the
light with a dazzling white purity, looked more like an old
white-washed wall than anything else. There was not a breath of
wind; the sound of the surf at the bottom of the precipice now
and then reached my ears&mdash;this was the only thing that broke
the vast silence. One's own dear self becomes so miserably small
in these mighty surroundings; it was a sheer relief to get back
to the company of my comrades."</p>

<br>
<small>THE JUNCTION OF THE GREAT BARRIER AND KING EDWARD
LAND.</small></p>
<br>
<p>As things now were, with open water up to the Barrier itself,
our prospect of getting seals here at the edge of the ice seemed
a poor one. Next morning, however, we found, a few miles farther
east, a bay about four miles long, and almost entirely enclosed.
It was still frozen over, and seals were lying on the ice by the
dozen. Here was food enough to give both ourselves and the dogs
an extra feed and to replenish our supplies. We camped and went
off to examine the ground more closely. There were plenty of
crevasses, but a practicable descent was found, and in a very
short time three full-grown seals and a fat young one were
despatched. We hauled half a carcass up to the camp with the
Alpine rope. As we were hard at work dragging our spoil up the
steep slope, we heard Stubberud sing out, "Below,
there!"&mdash;and away he went like a stone in a well. He had
gone through the snow-bridge on which we were standing, but a
lucky projection stopped our friend from going very far down,
besides which he had taken a firm round turn with the rope round
his wrist. It was, therefore, a comparatively easy matter to get
him up on the surface again. This little intermezzo would
probably have been avoided if we had not been without our ski,
but the slope was so steep and smooth that we could not use them.
After a few more hauls we had the seal up by the tent, where a
large quantity of it disappeared in a surprisingly short time
down the throats of fifteen hungry dogs.</p>
<p>The ice of the bay was furrowed by numerous leads, and while
the hunters were busy cutting up the seals, I tried to get a
sounding, but the thirty fathoms of Alpine rope I had were not
enough; no bottom was reached. After having something to eat we
went down again, in order if possible to find out the depth. This
time we were better supplied with sounding tackle two reels of
thread, a marlinspike, and our geological hammer.</p>
<p>First the marlinspike was sent down with the thread as a line.
An inquisitive lout of a seal did all it could to bite through
the thread, but whether this was too strong or its teeth too
poor, we managed after a lot of trouble to coax the marlinspike
up again, and the interfering rascal, who had to come up to the
surface now and then to take breath, got the spike of a ski-pole
in his thick hide. This unexpected treatment was evidently not at
all to his liking, and after acknowledging it by a roar of
disgust, he vanished into the depths. Now we got on better. The
marlinspike sank and sank until it had drawn with it 130 fathoms
of thread. A very small piece of seaweed clung to the thread as
we hauled it in again; on the spike there was nothing to be seen.
As its weight was rather light for so great a depth&mdash;a
possible setting of current might have carried it a little to one
side&mdash;we decided to try once more with the hammer, which was
considerably heavier, in order to check the result. The hammer,
on the other hand, was so heavy, that with the delicate thread as
a line the probability of successfully carrying out the
experiment seemed small, but we had to risk it. The improvised
sinker was well smeared with blubber, and this time it sank so
rapidly to the bottom as to leave no doubt of the correctness of
the sounding&mdash;130 fathoms again. By using extreme care we
succeeded in getting the hammer up again in safety, but no
specimen of the bottom was clinging to it.</p>

<small>IMPROVISED SOUNDING TACKLE.</small></p>
<br>
<p>On the way back to camp we dragged with us the carcass of the
young seal. It was past three when we got into our sleeping-bags
that night, and, in consequence, we slept a good deal later than
usual the next morning. The forenoon was spent by Johansen and
Stubberud in hauling up another seal from the bay and packing as
much flesh on the sledges as possible. As fresh meat is a
commodity that takes up a great deal of space in proportion to
its weight, the quantity we were able to take with us was not
large. The chief advantage we had gained was that a considerable
supply could be stored on the spot, and it might be useful to
fall back upon in case of delay or other mishaps.</p>
<p>I took the observation for longitude and latitude, found the
height by hypsometer, and took some photographs. After laying
down the depot and erecting beacons, we broke camp at 3 p.m.
South of the head of the bay there were a number of elevations
and pressure masses, exactly like the formations to be found
about Framheim. To the east a prominent ridge appeared, and with
the glass it could be seen to extend inland in a south-easterly
direction. According to our observations this must be the same
that Captain Scott has marked with land-shading on his chart.</p>
<p>We made a wide detour outside the worst pressure-ridges, and
then set our course east-north-east towards the ridge just
mentioned. It was a pretty steep rise, which was not at all a
good thing for the dogs. They had overeaten themselves
shockingly, and most of the seal's flesh came up again. So that
their feast should not be altogether wasted, we stopped as soon
as we had come far enough up the ridge to be able to regard the
surface as comparatively safe; for in the depression round the
bay it was somewhat doubtful.</p>
<p>On the following morning&mdash;Sunday, November 26&mdash;there
was a gale from the north-east with sky and Barrier lost in
driving snow. That put an end to our plans of a long Sunday
march. In the midst of our disappointment I had a sudden bright
idea. It was Queen Maud's birthday! If we could not go on, we
could at least celebrate the day in a modest fashion. In one of
the provision cases there was still a solitary Stavanger tin,
containing salt beef and peas. It was opened at once, and its
contents provided a banquet that tasted better to us than the
most carefully chosen menu had ever done. In this connection I
cannot help thinking of the joy it would bring to many a
household in this world if its master were possessed of an
appetite like ours. The wife would then have no need to dread the
consequences, however serious the shortcomings of the cuisine
might be. But to return to the feast. Her Majesty's health was
drunk in a very small, but, at the same time, very good tot of
<i>aquavit</i>, served in enamelled iron mugs. Carrying alcohol
was, of course, against regulations, strictly speaking; but, as
everyone knows, prohibition is not an easy thing to put into
practice. Even in Antarctica this proved to be the case.
Lindstr&ouml;m had a habit of sending a little surprise packet
with each sledging party that went out, and on our departure he
had handed us one of these, with the injunction that the packet
was only to be opened on some festive occasion; we chose as such
Her Majesty's birthday. On examination the packet was found to
contain a little flask of spirits, in which we at once agreed to
drink the Queen's health.</p>
<p>The 27th brought the same nasty weather, and the 28th was not
much better, though not bad enough to stop us. After a deal of
hard work in hauling our buried belongings out of the snow, we
got away and continued our course to the north-eastward. It was
not exactly an agreeable morning: a brisk wind with driving snow
right in one's face. After trudging against this for a couple of
hours I heard Stubberud call "Halt!"&mdash;half his team were
hanging by the traces in a crevasse. I had gone across without
noticing anything; no doubt owing to the snow in my face. One
would think the dogs would be suspicious of a place like this;
but they are not&mdash;they plunge on till the snow-bridge breaks
under them. Luckily the harness held, so that it was the affair
of a moment to pull the poor beasts up again. Even a dog might
well be expected to be a trifle shaken after hanging head
downwards over such a fearful chasm; but apparently they took it
very calmly, and were quite prepared to do the same thing over
again.</p>
<p>For my own part I looked out more carefully after this, and
although there were a good many ugly fissures on the remaining
part of the ascent, we crossed them all without further
incident.</p>
<p>Unpleasant as these crevasses are, they do not involve any
direct danger, so long as the weather is clear and the light
favourable. One can then judge by the appearance of the surface
whether there is danger ahead; and if crevasses are seen in time,
there is always a suitable crossing to be found. The case is
somewhat different in fog, drift, or when the light is such that
the small inequalities marking the course of the crevasse do not
show up. This last is often the case in cloudy weather, when even
a fairly prominent rise will not be noticed on the absolutely
white surface until one falls over it. In such conditions it is
safest to feel one's way forward with the ski-pole; though this
mode of proceeding is more troublesome than effective.</p>
<p>In the course of the 28th the ascent came to an end, and with
it the crevasses. The wind fell quite light, and the blinding
drift was succeeded by clear sunshine. We had now come
sufficiently high up to have a view of the sea far to the
north-west. During the high wind a quantity of ice had been
driven southward, so that for a great distance there was no open
water to be seen, but a number of huge icebergs. From the
distance of the sea horizon we guessed our height to be about
1,000 feet, and in the evening the hypsometer showed the guess to
be very nearly right.</p>
<p><i>November</i> 29.&mdash;Weather and going all that could be
wished on breaking camp this morning; before us we had a level
plateau, which appeared to be quite free from unpleasant
obstructions. When we halted for the noon observation the
sledge-meter showed ten geographical miles, and before evening we
had brought the day's distance up to twenty. The latitude was
then 77&deg; 32'. The distance to the Barrier edge on the north
was, at a guess, about twenty geographical miles. We were now a
good way along the peninsula, the northern point of which Captain
Scott named Cape Colbeck, and at the same time a good way to the
east of the meridian in which he put land-shading on his chart.
Our height above the sea, which was now about 1,000 feet, was
evidence enough that we had firm land under us, but it was still
sheathed in ice. In that respect the landscape offered no change
from what we had learnt to know by the name of "Barrier." It
cannot be denied that at this juncture I began to entertain a
certain doubt of the existence of bare land in this quarter.</p>
<p>This doubt was not diminished when we had done another good
day's march to the eastward on November 30. According to our
observations we were then just below the point where the
Alexandra Mountains should begin, but there was no sign of
mountain ranges; the surface was a little rougher, perhaps.
However, it was still too soon to abandon the hope. It would be
unreasonable to expect any great degree of accuracy of the chart
we had to go by; its scale was far too large for that. It was,
moreover, more than probable that our own determination of
longitude was open to doubt.</p>
<p>Assuming the approximate accuracy of the chart, by holding on
to the north-east we ought soon to come down to the seaboard, and
with this object in view we continued our march. On December 1,
in the middle of the day, we saw that everything agreed. From the
top of an eminence the sea was visible due north, and on the east
two domed summits were outlined, apparently high enough to be
worthy of the name of mountains. They were covered with snow, but
on the north side of them there was an abrupt precipice, in which
many black patches showed up sharply against the white
background. It was still too soon to form an idea as to whether
they were bare rock or not; they might possibly be fissures in
the mass of ice. The appearance of the summits agreed exactly
with Captain Scott's description of what he saw from the deck of
the <i>Discovery</i> in 1902. He assumed that the black patches
were rocks emerging from the snow-slopes. As will be seen later,
our respected precursor was right.</p>
<p>In order to examine the nature of the seaboard, we began by
steering down towards it; but in the meantime the weather
underwent an unfavourable change. The sky clouded over and the
light became as vile as it could be. The point we were anxious to
clear up was whether there was any Barrier wall here, or whether
the land and sea-ice gradually passed into each other in an easy
slope. As the light was, there might well have been a drop of 100
feet without our seeing anything of it. Securely roped together
we made our way down, until our progress was stopped by a huge
pressure-ridge, which, as far as could be made out, formed the
boundary between land and sea-ice. It was, however, impossible in
the circumstances to get any clear view of the surroundings, and
after trudging back to the sledges, which had been left up on the
slope, we turned to the east to make a closer examination of the
summits already mentioned. I went in front, as usual, in the
cheerful belief that we had a fairly level stretch before us, but
I was far out in my calculation. My ski began to slip along at a
terrific speed, and it was advisable to put on the brake. This
was easily done as far as I was concerned, but with the dogs it
was a different matter. Nothing could stop them when they felt
that the sledge was running by its own weight; they went in a
wild gallop down the slope, the end of which could not at present
be seen. I suppose it will sound like a tall story, but it is a
fact, nevertheless, that to our eyes the surface appeared to be
horizontal all the time. Snow, horizon and sky all ran together
in a white chaos, in which all lines of demarcation were
obliterated.</p>
<p>Fortunately nothing came of our expectation that the scamper
would have a frightful ending in some insidious abyss. It was
stopped quite naturally by an opposing slope, which appeared to
be as steep as the one we had just slid down. If the pace had
been rather too rapid before, there was now no ground of
complaint on that score. Step by step we crawled up to the top of
the ridge; but the ground was carefully surveyed before we
proceeded farther.</p>
<p>In the course of the afternoon we groped our way forward over
a whole series of ridges and intervening depressions. Although
nothing could be seen, it was obvious enough that our
surroundings were now of an entirely different character from
anything we had previously been accustomed to. The two mountain
summits had disappeared in the fleecy mist, but the increasing
unevenness of the ground showed that we were approaching them.
Meanwhile I considered it inadvisable to come to close quarters
with them so long as we were unable to use our eyes, and,
remembering what happens when the blind leads the blind, we
camped. For the first time during the trip I had a touch of
snow-blindness that afternoon. This troublesome and rightly
dreaded complaint was a thing that we had hitherto succeeded in
keeping off by a judicious use of our excellent snow-goggles.
Among my duties as forerunner was that of maintaining the
direction, and this, at times, involved a very severe strain on
the eyes. In thick weather it is only too easy to yield to the
temptation of throwing off the protective goggles, with the idea
that one can see better without them. Although I knew perfectly
well what the consequence would be, I had that afternoon broken
the commandment of prudence. The trifling smart I felt in my eyes
was cured by keeping the goggles on for a couple of hours after
we were in the tent. Like all other ills, snow-blindness may
easily be dispelled by taking it in time.</p>
<p>Next morning the sun's disc could just be made out through a
veil of thin stratus clouds, and then the light was more or less
normal again. As soon as we could see what our surroundings were,
it was clear enough that we had done right in stopping the game
of blind man's buff we had been playing on the previous day. It
might otherwise have had an unpleasant ending. Right across our
line of route and about 500 yards from our camp the surface was
so broken up that it was more like a sieve than anything else. In
the background the masses of snow were piled in huge drifts down
a steep slope on the north-west side of the two mountains. It was
impossible to take the sledges any farther on the way we had
hitherto been following, but in the course of the day we worked
round by a long detour to the foot of the most westerly of the
mountains. We were then about 1,000 feet above the sea; to the
north of us we had the abrupt descent already mentioned, to the
south it was quite flat. Our view to the east was shut in by the
two mountains, and our first idea was to ascend to the tops of
them, but the powers of the weather again opposed us with their
full force. A stiff south-east wind set in and increased in the
course of half an hour to a regular blizzard. Little as it suited
our wishes, there was nothing to be done but to creep back into
the tent. For a whole month now we had seen scarcely anything but
fair weather, and the advance of summer had given us hopes that
it would hold; but just when it suited us least of all came a
dismal change.</p>
<p>The light Antarctic summer night ran its course, while the
gusts of wind tugged and tore at the thin sides of our tent; no
snowfall accompanied the south-easterly wind, but the loose snow
of the surface was whirled up into a drift that stood like an
impenetrable wall round the tent. After midnight it moderated a
little, and by four o'clock there was comparatively fair weather.
We were on our feet at once, put together camera, glasses,
aneroids, axe, Alpine rope, with some lumps of pemmican to eat on
the way, and then went off for a morning walk with the nearer of
the two hills as our goal. All three of us went, leaving the dogs
in charge of the camp. They were not so fresh now that they would
not gladly accept all the rest that was offered them. We had no
need to fear any invasion of strangers; the land we had come to
appeared to be absolutely devoid of living creatures of any
kind.</p>
<p>The hill was farther off and higher than it appeared at first;
the aneroid showed a rise of 700 feet when we reached the top. As
our camp lay at a height of 1,000 feet, this gave us 1,700 feet
as the height of this hill above the sea. The side we went up was
covered by n&eacute;v&eacute;, which, to judge from the depth of
the cracks, must have been immense. As we approached the summit
and our view over the surrounding ground became wider, the belief
that we should see so much as a crag of this King Edward Land
grew weaker and weaker. There was nothing but white on every
side, not a single consolatory little black patch, however
carefully we looked. And to think that we had been dreaming of
great mountain masses in the style of McMurdo Sound, with sunny
slopes, penguins by the thousand, seals and all the rest! All
these visions were slowly but surely sunk in an endless sea of
snow, and when at last we stood on the highest point, we
certainly thought there could be no chance of a revival of our
hopes.</p>
<p>But the unexpected happened after all. On the precipitous
northern side of the adjacent hill our eyes fell upon bare
rock&mdash;the first glimpse we had had of positive land during
the year we had been in Antarctica. Our next thought was of how
to get to it and take specimens, and with this object we at once
began to scale the neighbouring hill, which was a trifle higher
than the one we had first ascended. The precipice was, however,
perpendicular, with a huge snow cornice over-hanging it. Lowering
a man on the rope would be rather too hazardous a proceeding;
besides which, a length of thirty yards would not go very far. If
we were to get at the rock, it would have to be from below. In
the meantime we availed ourselves of the opportunity offered by
the clear weather to make a closer examination of our
surroundings. From the isolated summit, 1,700 feet high, on which
we stood, the view was fairly extensive. Down to the sea on the
north the distance was about five geographical miles. The surface
descended in terraces towards the edge of the water, where there
was quite a low Barrier wall. As might be expected, this stretch
of the ice-field was broken by innumerable crevasses, rendering
any passage across it impossible.</p>
<p>On the east extended a well-marked mountain-ridge, about
twenty geographical miles in length, and somewhat lower than the
summit on which we stood. This was the Alexandra Mountains. It
could not be called an imposing range, and it was snow-clad from
one end to the other. Only on the most easterly spur was the rock
just visible.</p>
<p>On the south and south-west nothing was to be seen but the
usual undulating Barrier surface. Biscoe Bay, as Captain Scott
has named it, was for the moment a gathering-place for numerous
icebergs; one or two of these seemed to be aground. The inmost
corner of the bay was covered with sea-ice. On its eastern side
the Barrier edge could be seen to continue northward, as marked
in Captain Scott's chart; but no indication of bare land was
visible in that quarter.</p>
<p>Having built a snow beacon, 6 feet high, on the summit, we put
on our ski again and went down the eastern slope of the hill at a
whizzing pace. On this side there was an approach to the level on
the north of the precipice, and we availed ourselves of it. Seen
from below the mountain crest looked quite grand, with a
perpendicular drop of about 1,000 feet. The cliff was covered
with ice up to a height of about 100 feet, and this circumstance
threatened to be a serious obstacle to our obtaining specimens of
the rocks. But in one place a nunatak about 250 feet high stood
out in front of the precipice, and the ascent of this offered no
great difficulty.</p>
<p>A wall of rock of very ordinary appearance is not usually
reckoned among things capable of attracting the attention of the
human eye to any marked extent; nevertheless, we three stood and
gazed at it, as though we had something of extraordinary beauty
and interest before us. The explanation is very simple, if we
remember the old saying about the charm of variety. A sailor, who
for months has seen nothing but sea and sky, will lose himself in
contemplation of a little islet, be it never so barren and
desolate. To us, who for nearly a year had been staring our eyes
out in a dazzling white infinity of snow and ice, it was indeed
an experience to see once more a bit of the earth's crust. That
this fragment was as poor and bare as it could be was not taken
into consideration at the moment.</p>
<p>The mere sight of the naked rock was, however, only an
anticipatory pleasure. A more substantial one was the feeling of
again being able to move on ground that afforded a sure and
trustworthy foothold. It is possible that we behaved rather like
children on first reaching bare land. One of us, in any case,
found immense enjoyment in rolling one big block after another
down the steep slopes of the nunatak. At any rate, the sport had
the interest of novelty.</p>
<p>This little peak was built up of very heterogeneous materials.
As the practical result of our visit, we brought away a fairly
abundant collection of specimens of all the rocks to be found
there. Not being a specialist, I cannot undertake any
classification of the specimens. It will be the task of
geologists to deal with them, and to obtain if possible some
information as to the structure of the country. I will only
mention that some of the stones were so heavy that they must
certainly have contained metallic ore of one kind or another. On
returning to camp that evening, we tried them with the
compass-needle, and it showed very marked attraction in the case
of one or two of the specimens. These must, therefore, contain
iron-ore.</p>

<br>
<small>THE LEADER OF THE EASTERN EXPEDITION, PRESTRUD, ON SCOTT'S
NUNATAK.</small></p>
<br>
<p>This spur, which had been severely handled by ice-pressure and
the ravages of time, offered a poor chance of finding what we
coveted most&mdash;namely, fossils&mdash;and the most diligent
search proved unsuccessful in this respect. From finds that have
been made in other parts of Antarctica it is known that in former
geological periods&mdash;the Jurassic epoch&mdash;even this
desolate continent possessed a rich and luxurious vegetation. The
leader of the Swedish expedition to Graham Land, Dr.
Nordenskj&ouml;ld, and his companion, Gunnar Andersson, were the
first to make this exceedingly interesting and important
discovery.</p>
<p>While it did not fall to our lot to furnish any proof of the
existence of an earlier flora in King Edward Land, we found
living plants of the most primitive form. Even on that tiny islet
in the ocean of snow the rock was in many places covered with
thick moss. How did that moss come there? Its occurrence might,
perhaps, be quoted in support of the hypothesis of the genesis of
organic life from, dead matter. This disputed question must here
be left open, but it may be mentioned in the same connection that
we found the remains of birds' nests in many places among the
rocks. Possibly the occupants of these nests may have been
instrumental in the conveyance of the moss.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the signs of bird life were very few. One or two
solitary snowy petrels circled round the summit while we were
there; that was all.</p>
<p>It was highly important to obtain some successful photographs
from this spot, and I was setting about the necessary
preparations, when one of my companions made a remark about the
changed appearance of the sky. Busy with other things, I had
entirely neglected to keep an eye on the weather, an omission for
which, as will be seen, we might have had to pay dearly.
Fortunately, another had been more watchful than I, and the
warning came in time. A glance was enough to convince me of the
imminent approach of a snow-storm; the fiery red sky and the
heavy ring round the sun spoke a language that was only too
clear. We had a good hour's march to the tent, and the
possibility of being surprised by the storm before we arrived was
practically equivalent to never arriving at all.</p>
<p>We very soon put our things together, and came down the
nunatak even more quickly. On the steep slopes leading up to the
plateau on which the tent stood the pace was a good deal slower,
though we made every possible effort to hurry. There was no need
to trouble about the course; we had only to follow the trail of
our own ski&mdash;so long as it was visible. But the drift was
beginning to blot it out, and if it once did that, any attempt at
finding the tent would be hopeless. For a long and anxious
quarter of an hour it looked as if we should be too late, until
at last the tent came in sight, and we were saved. We had escaped
the blizzard so far; a few minutes later it burst in all its
fury, and the whirling snow was so thick that it would have been
impossible to see the tent at a distance of ten paces, but by
then we were all safe and sound inside. Ravenously hungry after
the twelve hours that had passed since our last proper meal, we
cooked an extra large portion of pemmican and the same of
chocolate, and with this sumptuous repast we celebrated the event
of the day&mdash;the discovery of land. From what we had seen in
the course of the day it might be regarded as certain that we
should be disappointed in our hopes of finding any great and
interesting field for our labours in this quarter; King Edward
Land was still far too well hidden under eternal snow and ice to
give us that. But even the establishment of this, to us, somewhat
unwelcome fact marked an increase of positive human knowledge of
the territory that bears the name of King Edward VII.; and with
the geological specimens that we had collected, we were in
possession of a tangible proof of the actual existence of solid
ground in a region which otherwise bore the greatest resemblance
to what we called "Barrier" elsewhere, or in any case to the
Barrier as it appears in the neighbourhood of our winter-quarters
at Framheim.</p>
<p><i>Monday, December</i> 4.&mdash;The gale kept on at full
force all night, and increased rather than moderated as the day
advanced. As usual, the storm was accompanied by a very marked
rise of temperature. At the noon observation to-day the reading
was + 26.6&deg; F. This is the highest temperature we have had so
far on this trip, and a good deal higher than we care about. When
the mercury comes so near freezing-point as this, the floor of
the tent is always damp.</p>
<p>To-day, for once in a way, we have falling snow, and enough of
it. It is snowing incessantly&mdash;big, hard flakes, almost like
hail. When the cooker was filled to provide water for dinner, the
half-melted mass looked like sago. The heavy flakes of snow make
a noise against the tent that reminds one of the safety-valve of
a large boiler blowing off: Inside the tent it is difficult to
hear oneself speak; when we have anything to say to each other we
have to shout.</p>
<p>These days of involuntary idleness on a sledge journey may
safely be reckoned among the experiences it is difficult to go
through without a good deal of mental suffering. I say nothing of
the purely physical discomfort of having to pass the day in a
sleeping-bag. That may be endured; in any case, so long as the
bag is fairly dry. It is a far worse matter to reconcile oneself
to the loss of the many solid hours that might otherwise have
been put to a useful purpose, and to the irritating consciousness
that every bit of food that is consumed is so much wasted of the
limited store. At this spot of all others we should have been so
glad to spend the time in exploring round about, or still more in
going farther. But if we are to go on, we must be certain of
having a chance of getting seals at a reasonable distance from
here. With our remaining supply of dogs' food we cannot go on for
more than three days.</p>
<p>What we have left will be just enough for the return journey,
even if we should not find the depot of seals' flesh left on the
way. There remained the resource of killing dogs, if it was a
question of getting as far to the east as possible, but for many
reasons I shrank from availing myself of that expedient. We could
form no idea of what would happen to the southern party's
animals. The probability was that they would have none left on
their return. Supposing their return were delayed so long as to
involve spending another winter on the Barrier, the transport of
supplies from the ship could hardly be carried out in the
necessary time with the ten untrained puppies that were left with
Lindstr&ouml;m. We had picked out the useful ones, and I thought
that, should the necessity arise, they could be used with greater
advantage for this work than we should derive from slaughtering
them here, and thereby somewhat prolonging the distance covered;
the more so as, to judge from all appearance, there was a poor
prospect of our finding anything of interest within a reasonable
time.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday, December</i> 5.&mdash;It looks as if our patience
is to be given a really hard trial this time. Outside the same
state of things continues, and the barometer is going down. A
mass of snow has fallen in the last twenty-four hours. The drift
on the windward side of the tent is constantly growing; if it
keeps on a little longer it will be as high as the top of the
tent. The sledges are completely snowed under, and so are the
dogs; we had to haul them out one by one in the middle of the
day. Most of them are now loose, as there is nothing exposed to
the attacks of their teeth. It is now blowing a regular gale; the
direction of the wind is about true east. Occasionally squalls of
hurricane-like violence occur. Fortunately the big snow-drift
keeps us comfortable, and we are under the lee of a hill,
otherwise it would look badly for our tent. Hitherto it has held
well, but it is beginning to be rather damp inside. The
temperature remains very high (+ 27.2&deg; F. at noon to-day),
and the mass of snow pressing against the tent causes the
formation of rime.</p>

STORM.</small></p>
<br>
<p>In order to while away the time to some extent under
depressing circumstances like these, I put into my diary on
leaving Framheim a few loose leaves of a Russian grammar;
Johansen solaced himself with a serial cut out of the
<i>Aftenpost</i>; as far as I remember, the title of it was "The
Red Rose and the White." Unfortunately the story of the Two Roses
was very soon finished; but Johansen had a good remedy for that:
he simply began it over again. My reading had the advantage of
being incomparably stiffer. Russian verbs are uncommonly
difficult of digestion, and not to be swallowed in a hurry. For
lack of mental nutriment, Stubberud with great resignation
consoled himself with a pipe, but his enjoyment must have been
somewhat diminished by the thought that his stock of tobacco was
shrinking at an alarming rate. Every time he filled his pipe, I
could see him cast longing looks in the direction of my pouch,
which was still comparatively full. I could not help promising a
fraternal sharing in case he should run short; and after that our
friend puffed on with an easy mind.</p>
<p>Although I look at it at least every half-hour, the barometer
will not go up. At 8 p.m. it was down to 27.30. If this means
anything, it can only be that we shall have the pleasure of being
imprisoned here another day. Some poor consolation is to be had
in the thought of how lucky we were to reach the tent at the last
moment the day before yesterday. A storm as lasting as this one
would in all probability have been too much for us if we had not
got in.</p>
<p><i>Wednesday, December</i> 6.&mdash;the third day of idleness
has at last crept away after its predecessors. We have done with
it. It has not brought any marked variation. The weather has been
just as violent, until now&mdash;8 p.m.&mdash;the wind shows a
slight tendency to moderate. It is, surely, time it did; three
days and nights should be enough for it. The heavy snowfall
continues. Big, wet flakes come dancing down through the opening
in the drift in which the peak of the tent still manages to show
itself. In the course of three days we have had more snowfall
here than we had at Framheim in ten whole months. It will be
interesting to compare our meteorological log with
Lindstr&ouml;m's; probably he has had his share of the storm, and
in that case it will have given him some exercise in
snow-shovelling.</p>
<p>The moisture is beginning to be rather troublesome now; most
of our wardrobe is wet through, and the sleeping-bags will soon
meet with the same fate. The snow-drift outside is now so high
that it shuts out most of the daylight; we are in twilight.
To-morrow we shall be obliged to dig out the tent, whatever the
weather is like, otherwise we shall be buried entirely, and run
the additional risk of having the tent split by the weight of
snow. I am afraid it will be a day's work to dig out the tent and
the two sledges; we have only one little shovel to do it
with.</p>
<p>A slight rise of both barometer and thermometer tells us that
at last we are on the eve of the change we have been longing for.
Stubberud is certain of fair weather to-morrow, he says. I am by
no means so sure, and offer to bet pretty heavily that there will
be no change. Two inches of Norwegian plug tobacco is the stake,
and with a heartfelt desire that J&ouml;rgen may win I await the
morrow.</p>
<p><i>Thursday, December</i> 7.&mdash;Early this morning I owned
to having lost my bet, as the weather, so far as I could tell,
was no longer of the same tempestuous character; but Stubberud
thought the contrary. "It seems to me just as bad," said he. He
was right enough, as a matter of fact, but this did not prevent
my persuading him to accept payment. Meanwhile we were obliged to
make an attempt to dig out the tent, regardless of the weather;
the situation was no longer endurable. We waited all the forenoon
in the hope of an improvement; but as none came, we set to work
at twelve o'clock. Our implements showed some originality and
diversity: a little spade, a biscuit-tin, and a cooker. The drift
did its best to undo our work as fast as we dug, but we managed
to hold our own against it. Digging out the tent-pegs gave most
trouble. After six hours' hard work we got the tent set up a few
yards to windward of its first position; the place where it had
stood was now a well about seven feet deep. Unfortunately there
was no chance of immortalizing this scene of excavation. It would
have been amusing enough to have it on the plate; but drifting
snow is a serious obstacle to an amateur
photographer&mdash;besides which, my camera was on Stubberud's
sledge, buried at least four feet down.</p>
<p>In the course of our digging we had had the misfortune to make
two or three serious rents in the thin canvas of the tent, and
the drift was not long in finding a way through these when the
tent was up again. To conclude my day's work I had, therefore, a
longish tailor's job, while the other two men were digging out a
good feed for the dogs, who had been on half-rations for the last
two days. That night we went rather short of sleep. Vulcan, the
oldest dog in Johansen's team, was chiefly to blame for this. In
his old age Vulcan was afflicted with a bad digestion, for even
Eskimo dogs may be liable to this infirmity, hardy as they
generally are. The protracted blizzard had given the old fellow a
relapse, and he proclaimed this distressing fact by incessant
howling. This kind of music was not calculated to lull us to
sleep, and it was three or four in the morning before we could
snatch a nap. During a pause I was just dropping off, when the
sun showed faintly through the tent. This unwonted sight at once
banished all further thoughts of sleep; the Primus was lighted, a
cup of chocolate swallowed, and out we went. Stubberud and
Johansen set to work at the hard task of digging out the sledges;
they had to go down four feet to get hold of them. I dragged our
wet clothes, sleeping-bags, and so forth out of the tent, and
hung them all up to dry. In the course of the morning
observations were taken for determining the geographical
longitude and latitude, as well as a few photographs, which will
give some idea of what our camp looked like after the
blizzard.</p>

<br>
<small>SCOTT'S NUNATAK.</small></p>
<br>
<p>Having made good the damage and put everything fairly in
order, we hurried away to our peaks, to secure some photographs
while the light was favourable. This time we were able to achieve
our object. "Scott's Nunataks," as they were afterwards
named&mdash;after Captain Scott, who first saw them&mdash;were
now for the first time recorded by the camera. Before we left the
summit the Norwegian flag was planted there, a snow beacon
erected, and a report of our visit deposited in it. The weather
would not keep clear; before we were back at the camp there was a
thick fog, and once more we had to thank the tracks of our ski
for showing us the way. During the time we had been involuntarily
detained at this spot, our store of provisions had decreased
alarmingly; there was only a bare week's supply left, and in less
than a week we should hardly be able to make home; probably it
would take more than a week, but in that case we had the depot at
our Bay of Seals to fall back upon. In the immediate
neighbourhood of our present position we could not reckon on
being able to replenish our supply in the continued unfavourable
state of the weather. We therefore made up our minds on the
morning of December 9 to break off the journey and turn our faces
homeward. For three days more we had to struggle with high wind
and thick snow, but as things now were, we had no choice but to
keep going, and by the evening of the 11th we had dragged
ourselves fifty geographical miles to the west. The weather
cleared during the night, and at last, on December 12, we had a
day of real sunshine. All our discomforts were forgotten;
everything went easily again. In the course of nine hours we
covered twenty-six geographical miles that day, without any great
strain on either dogs or men.</p>
<p>At our midday rest we found ourselves abreast of the bay,
where, on the outward journey, we had laid down our depot of
seals' flesh. I had intended to turn aside to the depot and
replenish our supply of meat as a precaution, but Johansen
suggested leaving out this detour and going straight on. We might
thereby run the risk of having to go on short rations; but
Johansen thought it a greater risk to cross the treacherous
ground about the bay, and, after some deliberation, I saw he was
right. It was better to go on while we were about it.</p>
<p>From this time on we met with no difficulty, and rapidly drew
near to our destination in regular daily marches of twenty
geographical miles. After men and dogs had received their daily
ration on the evening of the 15th, our sledge cases were
practically empty; but, according to our last position, we should
not have more than twenty geographical miles more to
Framheim.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, December</i> 16.&mdash;We broke camp at the usual
time, in overcast but perfectly clear weather, and began what was
to be our last day's march on this trip. A dark water-sky hung
over the Barrier on the west and north-west, showing that there
was open sea off the mouth of the Bay of Whales. We went on till
10.30, our course being true west, when we made out far to the
north-west an ice-cape that was taken to be the extreme point on
the western side of the bay. Immediately after we were on the
edge of the Barrier, the direction of which was here south-west
and north-east. We altered our course and followed the edge at a
proper distance until we saw a familiar iceberg that had broken
off to the north of Framheim, but had been stopped by the sea-ice
from drifting out. With this excellent mark in view the rest of
the way was plain sailing. The sledge-meter showed 19.5
geographical miles, when in the afternoon we came in sight of our
winter home. Quiet and peaceful it lay there, if possible more
deeply covered in snow than when we had left it. At first we
could see no sign of life, but soon the glasses discovered a
lonely wanderer on his way from the house to the "meteorological
institute." So Lindstr&ouml;m was still alive and performing his
duties.</p>
<p>When we left, our friend had expressed his satisfaction at
"getting us out of the way"; but I have a suspicion that he was
quite as pleased to see us back again. I am not quite certain,
though, that he did see us for the moment, as he was about as
snow-blind as a man can be. Lindstr&ouml;m was the last person we
should have suspected of that malady. On our asking him how it
came about, he seemed at first unwilling to give any explanation;
but by degrees it came out that the misfortune had happened a
couple of days before, when he had gone out after seals. His
team, composed of nothing but puppies, had run away and pulled up
at a big hummock out by the western cape, ten miles from the
station. But Lindstr&ouml;m, who is a determined man, would not
give up before he had caught the runaways; and this was too much
for his eyes, as he had no goggles with him. "When I got home I
couldn't see what the time was," he said; "but it must have been
somewhere about six in the morning." When we had made him put on
plenty of red eye-ointment and supplied him with a proper pair of
goggles, he was soon cured.</p>
<p>Framheim had had the same protracted storms with heavy
snowfall. On several mornings the master of the house had had to
dig his way out through the snow-wall outside the door; but
during the last three fine days he had managed to clear a
passage, not only to the door, but to the window as well.
Daylight came down into the room through a well nine feet deep.
This had been a tremendous piece of work; but, as already hinted,
nothing can stop Lindstr&ouml;m when he makes up his mind. His
stock of seals' flesh was down to a minimum; the little there was
vanished on the appearance of our ravenous dogs. We ourselves
were in no such straits; sweets were the only things in special
demand.</p>
<p>We stayed at home one day. After bringing up two loads of
seals' flesh, filling our empty provision cases, carrying out a
number of small repairs, and checking our watches, we were again
on the road on Monday the 18th. We were not very loth to leave
the house; indoor existence had become rather uncomfortable on
account of constant dripping from the ceiling. In the course of
the winter a quantity of ice had formed in the loft. As the
kitchen fire was always going after our return, the temperature
became high enough to melt the ice, and the water streamed down.
Lindstr&ouml;m was annoyed and undertook to put a stop to it. He
disappeared into the loft, and sent down a hail of ice,
bottle-straw, broken cases, and other treasures through the
trap-door. We fled before the storm and drove away. This time we
had to carry out our instructions as to the exploration of the
long eastern arm of the Bay of Whales. During the autumn several
Sunday excursions had been made along this remarkable formation;
but although some of these ski-runs had extended as far as twelve
miles in one direction, there was no sign of the hummocks coming
to an end. These great disturbances of the ice-mass must have a
cause, and the only conceivable one was that the subjacent land
had brought about this disruption of the surface. For immediately
to the south there was undoubtedly land, as there the surface
rose somewhat rapidly to a height of 1,000 feet; but it was
covered with snow. There was a possibility that the rock might
project among the evidences of heavy pressure at the foot of this
slope; and with this possibility in view we made a five days'
trip, following the great fissure, or "bay," as we generally
called it, right up to its head, twenty-three geographical miles
to the east of our winter-quarters.</p>
<p>Although we came across no bare rock, and in that respect the
journey was a disappointment, it was nevertheless very
interesting to observe the effects of the mighty forces that had
here been at work, the disruption of the solid ice-sheath by the
still more solid rock.</p>
<p>The day before Christmas Eve we were back at Framheim.
Lindstr&ouml;m had made good use of his time in our absence. The
ice had disappeared from the loft, and therewith the rain from
the ceiling. New linoleum had been laid down over half the floor,
and marks of the paint-brush were visible on the ceiling. These
efforts had possibly been made with an eye to the approaching
festival, but in other respects we abstained from any attempt at
keeping Christmas. It did not agree with the time of year;
constant blazing sunshine all through the twenty-four hours could
not be reconciled with a northerner's idea of Christmas. And for
that reason we had kept the festival six months before. Christmas
Eve fell on a Sunday, and it passed just like any ordinary
Sunday. Perhaps the only difference was that we used a razor that
day instead of the usual beard-clipper. On Christmas Day we took
a holiday, and Lindstr&ouml;m prepared a banquet of skua gulls.
Despise this dish as one may, it tasted undeniably
of&mdash;bird.</p>
<p>The numerous snow-houses were now in a sad way. Under the
weight of the constantly increasing mass, the roofs of most of
the rooms were pressed so far in that there was just enough space
to crawl on hands and knees. In the Crystal Palace and the
Clothing Store we kept all our skin clothing, besides a good deal
of outfit, which it was intended to take on board the <i>Fram</i>
when she and the southern party arrived. If the sinking
continued, it would be a long business digging these things out
again, and in order to have everything ready we made up our minds
to devote a few days to this work at once. We hauled the snow up
from these two rooms through a well twelve feet deep by means of
tackles. It was a long job, but when we had finished this part of
the labyrinth was as good as ever. We had no time to deal with
the vapour-bath or the carpenter's shop just then. There still
remained the survey of the south-western corner of the Bay of
Whales and its surroundings. On an eight days' sledge journey,
starting at the New Year, we ranged about this district, where we
were surprised to find the solid Barrier divided into small
islands, separated by comparatively broad sounds. These isolated
masses of ice could not possibly be afloat, although the depth in
one or two places, where we had a chance of making soundings,
proved to be as much as 200 fathoms. The only rational
explanation we could think of was that there must be a group of
low-lying islands here, or in any case shoals. These "ice
islands," if one may call them so, had a height of 90 feet and
sloped evenly down to the water on the greater part of their
circumference. One of the sounds, that penetrated into the
Barrier a short distance inside the western cape of the bay,
continued southward and gradually narrowed to a mere fissure. We
followed this until it lost itself, thirty geographical miles
within the Barrier.</p>
<p>The last day of this trip&mdash;Thursday, January
11&mdash;will always be fixed in our memory; it was destined to
bring us experiences of the kind that are never forgotten. Our
start in the morning was made at exactly the same time and in
exactly the same way as so many times before. We felt pretty
certain of reaching Framheim in the course of the day, but that
prospect was for the moment of minor importance. In the existing
state of the weather our tent offered us as comfortable quarters
as our snowed-up winter home. What made us look forward to our
return with some excitement was the possibility of seeing the
<i>Fram</i> again, and this thought was no doubt in the minds of
all of us that January morning, though we did not say much about
it.</p>
<p>After two hours' march we caught sight of West Cape, at the
entrance to the bay, in our line of route, and a little later we
saw a black strip of sea far out on the horizon. As usual, a
number of bergs of all sizes were floating on this strip, in
every variety of shade from white to dark grey, as the light fell
on them. One particular lump appeared to us so dark that it could
hardly be made of ice; but we had been taken in too many times to
make any remark about it.</p>
<p>As the dogs now had a mark to go by, Johansen was driving in
front without my help; I went by the side of Stubberud's sledge.
The man at my side kept staring out to sea, without uttering a
word. On my asking him what in the world he was looking at, he
replied "I could almost swear it was a ship, but of course it's
only a wretched iceberg." We were just agreed upon this, when
suddenly Johansen stopped short and began a hurried search for
his long glass. "Are you going to look at the <i>Fram</i>?" I
asked ironically. "Yes, I am," he said; and while he turned the
telescope upon the doubtful object far out in Ross Sea, we two
stood waiting for a few endless seconds. "It's the <i>Fram</i>
sure enough, as large as life!" was the welcome announcement that
broke our suspense. I glanced at Stubberud and saw his face
expanding into its most amiable smile. Though I had not much
doubt of the correctness of Johansen's statement, I borrowed his
glass, and a fraction of a second was enough to convince me. That
ship was easily recognized; she was our own old <i>Fram</i>
safely back again.</p>
<p>We had still fourteen long miles to Framheim and an obstinate
wind right in our faces, but that part of the way was covered in
a remarkably short time. On arriving at home at two in the
afternoon we had some expectation of finding a crowd of people in
front of the house; but there was not a living soul to be seen.
Even Lindstr&ouml;m remained concealed, though as a rule he was
always about when anyone arrived. Thinking that perhaps our
friend had had a relapse of snow-blindness, I went in to announce
our return. Lindstr&ouml;m was standing before his range in the
best of health when I entered the kitchen. "The <i>Fram</i>'s
come!" he shouted, before I had shut the door. "Tell me something
I don't know," said I, "and be so kind as to give me a cup of
water with a little syrup in it if you can." I thought somehow
that the cook had a sly grin on his face when he brought what I
asked for, but with the thirst I had after the stiff march, I
gave a great part of my attention to the drink. I had consumed
the best part of a quart, when Lindstr&ouml;m went off to his
bunk and asked if I could guess what he had hidden there. There
was no time to guess anything before the blankets were thrown on
to the floor, and after them bounded a bearded ruffian clad in a
jersey and a pair of overalls of indeterminable age and colour.
"Hullo!" said the ruffian, and the voice was that of Lieutenant
Gjertsen. Lindstr&ouml;m was shaking with laughter while I stood
open-mouthed before this apparition; I had been given a good
surprise. We agreed to treat Johansen and Stubberud in the same
way, and as soon as they were heard outside, Gjertsen hid himself
again among the blankets. But Stubberud had smelt a rat in some
way or other. "There are more than two in this room," he said, as
soon as he came in. It was no surprise to him to find a man from
the <i>Fram</i> in Lindstr&ouml;m's bunk.</p>

<br>
<small>THE "FRAM" AT THE ICE-EDGE, JANUARY, 1912.</small></p>
<br>
<p>When we heard that the visitor had been under our roof for a
whole day, we assumed that in the course of that time he had
heard all about our own concerns from Lindstr&ouml;m. We were
therefore not inclined to talk about ourselves; we wanted news
from without, and Gjertsen was more than ready to give us them.
The <i>Fram</i> had arrived two days before, all well. After
lying at the ice edge for a day and a night, keeping a constant
lookout for the "natives," Gjertsen had grown so curious to know
how things were at Framheim that he had asked Captain Nilsen for
"shore leave." The careful skipper had hesitated a while before
giving permission; it was a long way up to the house, and the
sea-ice was scored with lanes, some of them fairly wide. Finally
Gjertsen had his way, and he left the ship, taking a signal flag
with him. He found it rather difficult to recognize his
surroundings, to begin with; one ice cape was very like another,
and ugly ideas of calvings suggested themselves, until at last he
caught sight of Cape Man's Head, and then he knew that the
foundations of Framheim had not given way. Cheered by this
knowledge, he made his way towards Mount Nelson, but on arriving
at the top of this ridge, from which there was a view over
Framheim, the eager explorer felt his heart sink. Where our new
house had made such a brave show a year before on the surface of
the Barrier, there was now no house at all to be seen. All that
met the eyes of the visitor was a sombre pile of ruins. But his
anxiety quickly vanished when a man emerged from the confusion.
The man was Lindstr&ouml;m, and the supposed ruin was the most
ingenious of all winter-quarters. Lindstr&ouml;m was ignorant of
the <i>Fram</i>'s arrival, and the face he showed on seeing
Gjertsen must have been worth some money to look at.</p>
<p>When our first curiosity was satisfied, our thoughts turned to
our comrades on board the <i>Fram</i>. We snatched some food, and
then went down to the sea-ice, making our way across the little
bay due north of the house. Our well-trained team were not long
in getting there, but we had some trouble with them in crossing
the cracks in the ice, as some of the dogs, especially the
puppies, had a terror of water.</p>
<p>The <i>Fram</i> was cruising some way out, but when we came
near enough for them to see us, they made all haste to come in to
the ice-foot. Yes, there lay our good little ship, as trim as
when we had last seen her; the long voyage round the world had
left no mark on her strong hull. Along the bulwarks appeared a
row of smiling faces, which we were able to recognize in spite of
the big beards that half concealed many of them. While
clean-shaven chins had been the fashion at Framheim, almost every
man on board appeared with a flowing beard. As we came over the
gangway questions began to hail upon us. I had to ask for a
moment's grace to give the captain and crew a hearty shake of the
hand, and then I collected them all about me and gave a short
account of the most important events of the past year. When this
was done, Captain Nilsen pulled me into the chart-house, where we
had a talk that lasted till about four the next morning&mdash;to
both of us certainly one of the most interesting we have ever
had. On Nilsen's asking about the prospects of the southern
party, I ventured to assure him that in all probability we should
have our Chief and his companions back in a few days with the
Pole in their pockets.</p>
<p>Our letters from home brought nothing but good news. What
interested us most in the newspapers was, of course, the account
of how the expedition's change of route had been received.</p>
<p>At 8 a.m. we left the <i>Fram</i> and returned home. For the
next few days we were occupied with the work of surveying and
charting, which went comparatively quickly in the favourable
weather. When we returned after our day's work on the afternoon
of the 17th, we found Lieutenant Gjertsen back at the hut. He
asked us if we could guess the news, and as we had no answer
ready, he told us that the ship of the Japanese expedition had
arrived. We hurriedly got out the cinematograph apparatus and the
camera, and went off as fast as the dogs could go, since Gjertsen
thought this visit would not be of long duration.</p>
<p>When we caught sight of the <i>Fram</i> she had her flag up,
and just beyond the nearest cape lay the <i>Kainan Maru</i>, with
the ensign of the Rising Sun at the peak. <i>Banzai!</i> We had
come in time. Although it was rather late in the evening, Nilsen
and I decided to pay her a visit, and if possible to see the
leader of the expedition. We were received at the gangway by a
young, smiling fellow, who beamed still more when I produced the
only Japanese word I knew: <i>Oheio</i>&mdash;Good-day. There the
conversation came to a full stop, but soon a number of the
inquisitive sons of Nippon came up, and some of them understood a
little English. We did not get very far, however. We found out
that the <i>Kainan Maru</i> had been on a cruise in the direction
of King Edward VII. Land; but we could not ascertain whether any
landing had been attempted or not.</p>
<p>As the leader of the expedition and the captain of the ship
had turned in, we did not want to disturb them by prolonging our
visit; but we did not escape before the genial first officer had
offered us a glass of wine and a cigar in the chart-house. With
an invitation to come again next day, and permission to take some
photographs, we returned to the <i>Fram</i>; but nothing came of
the projected second visit to our Japanese friends. Both ships
put out to sea in a gale that sprang up during the night, and
before we had another opportunity of going on board the <i>Kainan
Maru</i> the southern party had returned.</p>

<br>
<small>THE "KAINAN MARU".</small></p>
<br>
<p>The days immediately preceding the departure of the expedition
for the north fell about the middle of the short Antarctic
summer, just at the time when the comparatively rich animal life
of the Bay of Whales shows itself at its best.</p>
<p>The name of the Bay of Whales is due to Shackleton, and is
appropriate enough; for from the time of the break-up of the
sea-ice this huge inlet in the Barrier forms a favourite
playground for whales, of which we often saw schools of as many
as fifty disporting themselves for hours together. We had no
means of disturbing their peaceful sport, although the sight of
all these monsters, each worth a small fortune, was well
calculated to make our fingers itch. It was the whaling demon
that possessed us.</p>
<p>For one who has no special knowledge of the industry it is
difficult to form an adequate opinion as to whether this part of
Antarctica is capable of ever becoming a field for whaling
enterprise. In any case, it will probably be a long time before
such a thing happens. In the first place, the distance to the
nearest inhabited country is very great&mdash;over 2,000
geographical miles&mdash;and in the second, there is a serious
obstruction on this route in the shape of the belt of pack-ice,
which, narrow and loose as it may be at times, will always
necessitate the employment of timber-built vessels for the work
of transport.</p>
<p>The conditions prevailing in the Bay of Whales must presumably
offer a decisive obstacle to the establishment of a permanent
station. Our winter house was snowed under in the course of two
months, and to us this was only a source of satisfaction, as our
quarters became all the warmer on this account; but whether a
whaling station would find a similar fate equally convenient is
rather doubtful.</p>
<p>Lastly, it must be said that, although in the bay itself huge
schools of whales were of frequent occurrence, we did not receive
the impression that there was any very great number of them out
in Ross Sea. The species most commonly seen was the Finner; after
that the Blue Whale.</p>
<p>As regards seals, they appeared in great quantities along the
edge of the Barrier so long as the sea-ice still lay there; after
the break-up of the ice the Bay of Whales was a favourite resort
of theirs all through the summer. This was due to its offering
them an easy access to the dry surface, where they could abandon
themselves to their favourite occupation of basking in the
sunshine.</p>
<p>During our whole stay we must have killed some two hundred and
fifty of them, by far the greater number of which were shot in
the autumn immediately after our arrival. This little inroad had
no appreciable effect. The numerous survivors, who had been
eye-witnesses of their companions' sudden death, did not seem to
have the slightest idea that the Bay of Whales had become for the
time being a somewhat unsafe place of residence.</p>

<br>
<p>As early as September, while the ice still stretched under in
the course of two months, and to us this was only a source of
satisfaction, as our quarters became all the warmer on this
account; but whether a whaling station would find a similar fate
equally convenient is rather doubtful.</p>
<p>Of the three different species we met with&mdash;the Weddell,
the sea-leopard, and the crab-eater&mdash;the first-named was by
far the most numerous. The Weddell seal is an extremely awkward
and clumsy animal, that fully understands the art of not
hurrying; this, of course, applies only to its movements out of
the water. A full-grown bull is almost as large as a walrus, and
must certainly weigh something like 8 hundredweight. A
ridiculously small head is set upon its heavy body, and its mouth
is provided with teeth about as innocuous as those of the
domestic cow. The skins vary from light grey to brownish
black.</p>
<p>The sea-leopard was far more rare in these parts. In the bay
itself it was not found; the few specimens we saw were met with
in the pack-ice. As far as I know, we only secured a couple of
them. The sea-leopard is a far more dangerous fellow than his
cousin the Weddell seal. He is almost as big, but his body is
very much more lithe and agile; he has a mouth full of long,
sharp teeth, and is always ready to use this weapon. He is not to
be approached without a certain caution, and in the water he must
be an extremely unpleasant opponent.</p>
<p>The name crab-eater may possibly evoke ideas of some ferocious
creature; in that case it is misleading. The animal that bears it
is, without question, the most amicable of the three species. It
is of about the same size as our native seal, brisk and active in
its movements, and is constantly exercising itself in high jumps
from the water on to the ice-foot. Even on the ice it can work
its way along so fast that it is all a man can do to keep up. Its
skin is extraordinarily beautiful&mdash;grey, with a sheen of
silver and small dark spots.</p>
<p>One is often asked whether seal's flesh does not taste of
train oil. It seems to be a common assumption that it does so.
This, however, is a mistake; the oil and the taste of it are only
present in the layer of blubber, an inch thick, which covers the
seal's body like a protective armour. The flesh itself contains
no fat; on the other hand, it is extremely rich in blood and its
taste in consequence reminds one of black-puddings. The flesh of
the Weddell seal is very dark in colour; in the frying-pan it
turns quite black. The flesh of the crab-eater is of about the
same colour as beef, and to us, at any rate, its taste was
equally good. We therefore always tried to get crab-eater when
providing food for ourselves.</p>
<p>We found the penguins as amusing as the seals were useful. So
much has been written recently about these remarkable creatures,
and they have been photographed and cinematographed so many
times, that everyone is acquainted with them. Nevertheless,
anyone who sees a living penguin for the first time will always
be attracted and interested, both by the dignified Emperor
penguin, with his three feet of stature, and by the bustling
little Ad&eacute;lie.</p>
<p>Not only in their upright walk, but also in their manners and
antics, these birds remind one strikingly of human beings. It has
been remarked that an Emperor is the very image of "an old
gentleman in evening dress," and the resemblance is indeed very
noticeable. It becomes still more so when the Emperor&mdash;as is
always his habit&mdash;approaches the stranger with a series of
ceremonious bows; such is their good breeding!</p>
<p>When this ceremony is over, the penguin will usually come
quite close; he is entirely unsuspecting and is not frightened
even if one goes slowly towards him. On the other hand, if one
approaches rapidly or touches him, he is afraid and immediately
takes to flight. It sometimes happens, though, that he shows
fight, and then it is wiser to keep out of range of his flippers;
for in these he has a very powerful weapon, which might easily
break a man's arm. If you wish to attack him, it is better to do
so from behind; both flippers must be seized firmly at the same
time and bent backwards along his back; then the fight is
over.</p>
<p>The little Ad&eacute;lie is always comic. On meeting a flock
of these little busybodies the most ill-humoured observer is
forced to burst into laughter. During the first weeks of our stay
in the Bay of Whales, while we were still unloading stores, it
was always a welcome distraction to see a flock of Ad&eacute;lie
penguins, to the number of a dozen or so, suddenly jump out of
the water, as though at a word of command, and then sit still for
some moments, stiff with astonishment at the extraordinary things
they saw. When they had recovered from the first surprise, they
generally dived into the sea again, but their intense curiosity
soon drove them back to look at us more closely.</p>
<p>In contradistinction to their calm and self-controlled
relative, the Emperor penguin, these active little creatures have
an extremely fiery temperament, which makes them fly into a
passion at the slightest interference with their affairs; and
this, of course, only makes them still more amusing.</p>
<p>The penguins are birds of passage; they spend the winter on
the various small groups of islands that are scattered about the
southern ocean. On the arrival of spring they betake themselves
to Antarctica, where they have their regular rookeries in places
where there is bare ground. They have a pronounced taste for
roaming, and as soon as the chicks are grown they set out, young
and old together, on their travels. It was only as tourists that
the penguins visited Framheim and its environs; for there was, of
course, no bare land in our neighbourhood that might offer them a
place of residence. For this reason we really saw comparatively
little of them; an Emperor was a very rare visitor; but the few
occasions on which we met these peculiar "bird people" of
Antarctica will remain among the most delightful memories of our
stay in the Bay of Whales.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI<br>
<br>
<small>THE VOYAGE OF THE "FRAM"<br>
<br>

Nilsen</small></i></small></h3>
<br>
<a name="ch-08" id="ch-08"></a>
<h3>I.<br>
<br>
<small>FROM NORWAY TO THE BARRIER.</small></h3>
<p><small>AFTER</small> the <i>Fram</i> had undergone extensive
repairs in Horten Dockyard, and had loaded provisions and
equipment in Christiania, we left the latter port on June 7,
1910. According to the plan we were first to make an
oceanographical cruise of about two months in the North Atlantic,
and then to return to Norway, where the <i>Fram</i> was to be
docked and the remaining outfit and dogs taken on board.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Image100" id="Image100"></a><img alt=

<br>
<small>FIRST-LIEUTENANT THORVALD NILSEN, NORWEGIAN
NAVY.</small></p>
<br>
<p>This oceanographical cruise was in many respects successful.
In the first place, we gained familiarity with the vessel, and
got everything shipshape for the long voyage to come; but the
best of all was, that we acquired valuable experience of our
auxiliary engine. This is a 180 h.p. Diesel motor, constructed
for solar oil, of which we were taking about 90,000 litres (about
19,800 gallons). In this connection it may be mentioned that we
consumed about 500 litres (about 110 gallons) a day, and that the
<i>Fram</i>'s radius of action was thus about six months. For the
first day or two the engine went well enough, but after that it
went slower and slower, and finally stopped of its own accord.
After this it was known as the "Whooping Cough." This happened
several times in the course of the trip; the piston-rods had
constantly to be taken out and cleared of a thick black deposit.
As possibly our whole South Polar Expedition would depend on the
motor doing its work properly, the result of this was that the
projected cruise was cut short, and after a lapse of three weeks
our course was set for Bergen, where we changed the oil for
refined paraffin, and at the same time had the motor thoroughly
overhauled.</p>
<p>Since then there has never been anything wrong with the
engine.</p>
<p>From Bergen we went to Christiansand, where the <i>Fram</i>
was docked, and, as already mentioned, the remaining outfit, with
the dogs and dog-food, was taken on board.</p>
<p>The number of living creatures on board when we left Norway
was nineteen men, ninety-seven dogs, four pigs, six carrier
pigeons, and one canary.</p>
<p>At last we were ready to leave Christiansand on Thursday,
August 9, 1910, and at nine o'clock that evening the anchor was
got up and the motor started. After the busy time we had had, no
doubt we were all glad to get off. As our departure had not been
made public, only the pilot and a few acquaintances accompanied
us a little way out. It was glorious weather, and everyone stayed
on deck till far into the light night, watching the land slowly
disappear. All the ninety-seven dogs were chained round the deck,
on which we also had coal, oil, timber and other things, so that
there was not much room to move about.</p>
<p>The rest of the vessel was absolutely full. To take an
example, in the fore-saloon we had placed forty-three sledging
cases, which were filled with books, Christmas presents,
underclothing, and the like. In addition to these, one hundred
complete sets of dog-harness, all our ski, ski-poles, snow-shoes,
etc. Smaller articles were stowed in the cabins, and every man
had something. When I complained, as happened pretty often, that
I could not imagine where this or that was to be put, the Chief
of the expedition used generally to say: "Oh, that's all right;
you can just put it in your cabin!" Thus it was with every
imaginable thing&mdash;from barrels of paraffin and new-born pups
to writing materials and charts.</p>
<p>As the story of this voyage has already been told, it may be
rapidly passed over here. After much delay through headwinds in
the Channel, we picked up the north-east trade in about the
latitude of Gibraltar, and arrived at Madeira on September 6.</p>
<p>At 9 p.m. on September 9 we weighed anchor for the last time,
and left Madeira. As soon as we were clear of the land we got the
north-east trade again, and it held more or less fresh till about
lat. 11&deg; N.</p>
<p>After our departure from Madeira I took over the morning
watch, from 4 to 8 a.m.; Prestrud and Gjertsen divided the
remainder of the twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>In order if possible to get a little more way on the ship, a
studding-sail and a skysail were rigged up with two awnings; it
did not increase our speed very much, but no doubt it helped a
little.</p>
<p>The highest temperature we observed was 84&deg; F. In the
trade winds we constantly saw flying-fish, but as far as I know
not one was ever found on deck; those that came on board were of
course instantly snapped up by the dogs.</p>
<p>In about lat. 11&deg; N. we lost the north-east trade, and
thus came into the "belt of calms," a belt that extends on each
side of the Equator, between the north-east and south-east
trades. Here, as a rule, one encounters violent rain-squalls; to
sailing ships in general and ourselves in particular this heavy
rain is welcome, as water-tanks can be filled up. Only on one day
were we lucky enough to have rain, but as it was accompanied by a
strong squall of wind, we did not catch all the water we wanted.
All hands were on deck carrying water, some in oilskins, some in
Adam's costume; the Chief in a white tropical suit, and, as far
as I remember, clogs. As the latter were rather slippery, and the
<i>Fram</i> suddenly gave an unexpected lurch, he was carried off
his legs, and left sitting on the deck, while his bucket of water
poured all over him. But "it was all in his country's cause," so
he did not mind. We caught about 3 tons of water, and then had
our tanks full, or about 30 tons, when the shower passed off;
later in the voyage we filled a bucket now and again, but it
never amounted to much, and if we had not been as careful as we
were, our water-supply would hardly have lasted out.</p>
<p>On October 4 we crossed the Equator. The south-east trade was
not so fresh as we had expected, and the engine had to be kept
going the whole time.</p>
<p>At the beginning of November we came down into the west wind
belt, or the "Roaring Forties," as they are called, and from that
time we ran down our easting at a great rate. We were very lucky
there, and had strong fair winds for nearly seven weeks at a
stretch. In the heavy sea we found out what it was to sail in the
<i>Fram</i>; she rolls incessantly, and there is never a moment's
rest. The dogs were thrown backwards and forwards over the deck,
and when one of them rolled into another, it was taken as a
personal insult, and a fight followed at once. But for all that
the <i>Fram</i> is a first-rate sea boat, and hardly ever ships
any water. If this had been otherwise, the dogs would have been
far worse off than they were.</p>

<br>
THE "FRAM" SIGHTED.</small></p>
<br>
<p>The weather in the "Foggy Fifties" varied between gales,
calms, fogs, snowstorms, and other delights. As a rule, the
engine was now kept constantly ready, in case of our being so
unlucky as to come too near an iceberg. Fortunately, however, we
did not meet any of these until early on the morning of January
1, 1911, when we saw some typical Antarctic bergs; that is to
say, entirely tabular. Our latitude was then a little over
60&deg; S., and we were not far off the pack. On the 1st and 2nd
we sailed southward without seeing anything but scattered bergs
and a constantly increasing number of lumps of ice, which showed
us we were getting near. By 10 p.m. on the 2nd we came into slack
drift-ice; the weather was foggy, and we therefore kept going as
near as might be on the course to the Bay of Whales, which was
destined to be our base.</p>
<p>A good many seals were lying on the ice-floes, and as we went
forward we shot some. As soon as the first seal was brought on
board, all our dogs had their first meat meal since Madeira; they
were given as much as they wanted, and ate as much as they could.
We, too, had our share of the seal, and from this time forward we
had fresh seal-steak for breakfast at least every day; it tasted
excellent to us, who for nearly half a year had been living on
nothing but tinned meat. With the steak whortleberries were
always served, which of course helped to make it appreciated. The
biggest seal we got in the pack-ice was about 12 feet long, and
weighed nearly half a ton. A few penguins were also shot, mostly
Ad&eacute;lie penguins; these are extraordinarily amusing, and as
inquisitive as an animal can be. When any of them saw us, they at
once came nearer to get a better view of the unbidden guests. If
they became too impertinent, we did not hesitate to take them,
for their flesh, especially the liver, was excellent. The
albatrosses, which had followed us through the whole of the west
wind belt, had now departed, and in their place came the
beautiful snowy petrels and Antarctic petrels.</p>
<p>We had more or less fog all through the pack-ice. Only on the
night of the 5th did we have sun and fine weather, when we saw
the midnight sun for the first time. A more beautiful morning it
would be difficult to imagine: radiantly clear, with thick ice
everywhere, as far as the eye could see; the lanes of water
between the floes gleamed in the sun, and the ice-crystals
glittered like thousands of diamonds. It was a pure delight to go
on deck and drink in the fresh air; one felt altogether a new
man. I believe everyone on board found this passage through the
pack the most interesting part of the whole voyage, and, of
course, it all had the charm of novelty. Those who had not been
in the ice before, myself among them, and who were hunting for
the first time, ran about after seals and penguins, and amused
themselves like children.</p>
<p>At 10 p.m. on the 6th we were already out of the ice after a
passage of exactly four days; we had been extremely lucky, and
the <i>Fram</i> went very easily through the ice.</p>
<p>After coming out of the pack, our course was continued through
the open Ross Sea to the Bay of Whales, which from the previous
description was to be found in about long. 164&deg; W. On the
afternoon of the 11th we had strong ice-blink ahead, by which is
meant the luminous stripe that is seen above a considerable
accumulation of ice; the nearest thing one can compare it to is
the glare that is always seen over a great city on approaching it
at night. We knew at once that this was the glare of the mighty
Ross Barrier, named after Sir James Clark Ross, who first saw it
in 1841. The Barrier is a wall of ice, several hundred miles
long, and about 100 feet high, which forms the southern boundary
of Ross Sea. We were, of course, very intent upon seeing what it
looked like, but to me it did not appear so imposing as I had
imagined it. Possibly this was because I had become familiar with
it, in a way, from the many descriptions of it. From these
descriptions we had expected to find a comparatively narrow
opening into Balloon Bight, as shown in the photographs we had
before us; but as we went along the Barrier, on the 12th, we
could find no opening. In long. 164&deg; W., on the other hand,
there was a great break in the wall, forming a cape (West Cape);
from here to the other side of the Barrier was about eight
geographical miles, and southward, as far as we could see, lay
loose bay ice. We held on to the east outside this drift-ice and
along the eastern Barrier till past midnight, but as Balloon
Bight was not to be found, we returned to the above-mentioned
break or cape, where we lay during the whole forenoon of the
13th, as the ice was too thick to allow us to make any progress.
After midday, however, the ice loosened, and began to drift out;
at the same time we went in, and having gone as far as possible,
the <i>Fram</i> was moored to the fast ice-foot on the western
side of the great bay we had entered. It proved that Balloon
Bight and another bight had merged to form a great bay, exactly
as described by Sir Ernest Shackleton, and named by him the Bay
of Whales.</p>
<p>After mooring here, the Chief and one or two others went on a
reconnoitring tour; but it began to snow pretty thickly, and, as
far as I am aware, nothing was accomplished beyond seeing that
the Barrier at the southernmost end of the bay sloped evenly down
to the sea-ice; but between the latter and the slope there was
open water, so that they could not go any farther. We lay all
night drifting in the ice, which was constantly breaking up, and
during this time several seals and penguins were shot. Towards
morning on the 14th it became quite clear, and we had a splendid
view of the surroundings. Right over on the eastern side of the
bay it looked as if there was more open water; we therefore went
along the fast ice-foot and moored off the eastern Barrier at
about three in the afternoon. The cape in the Barrier, under
which we lay, was given the name of "Man's Head," on account of
its resemblance to a human profile. All the time we were going
along the ice we were shooting seals, so that on arrival at our
final moorings we already had a good supply of meat.</p>
<p>For my part I was rather unlucky on one of these hunts: Four
seals were lying on the ice-foot, and I jumped down with rifle
and five cartridges; to take any cartridges in reserve did not
occur to me, as, of course, I regarded myself as a mighty hunter,
and thought that one shot per seal was quite enough. The three
first died without a groan; but the fourth took the alarm, and
made off as fast as it could. I fired my fourth cartridge, but it
did not hit as it ought to have done, and the seal was in full
flight, leaving a streak of blood behind it. I was not anxious to
let a wounded seal go, and as I had only one cartridge left, and
the seal had its tail turned towards me, I wanted to come to
close quarters to make sure of it. I therefore ran as hard as I
could, but the seal was quicker, and it determined the range.
After running half-way to the South Pole, I summoned my remaining
strength and fired the last shot. Whether the bullet went above
or below, I have no idea. All I know is, that on arriving on
board I was met by scornful smiles and had to stand a good deal
of chaff.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, we left Norway on August 9, 1910, and
arrived at our final moorings on January 14, 1911, in the course
of which time we had only called at Madeira. The Barrier is
16,000 geographical miles from Norway, a distance which we took
five months to cover. From Madeira we had had 127 days in open
sea, and therewith the first part of the voyage was brought to an
end.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>II.<br>
<small>OFF THE BARRIER.</small></h3>
<p><small>AS</small> soon as we had moored, the Chief, Prestrud,
Johansen and I went up on to the Barrier on a tour of
reconnaissance. The ascent from the sea-ice to the Barrier was
fine, a perfectly even slope. When no more than a mile from the
ship, we found a good site for the first dog-camp, and another
mile to the south it was decided that the house was to stand, on
the slope of a hill, where it would be least exposed to the
strong south-easterly gales which might be expected from previous
descriptions. Up on the Barrier all was absolutely still, and
there was not a sign of life; indeed, what should anything live
on? This delightful ski-run was extended a little farther to the
south, and after a couple of hours we returned on board. Here in
the meantime the slaughtering of seals had been going on, and
there were plenty to be had, as several hundreds of them lay
about on the ice.</p>
<p>After the rather long sea voyage, and the cramped quarters on
board, I must say it was a pleasure to have firm ground under
one's feet and to be able to move about a little. The dogs
evidently thought the same; when they came down on to the ice,
they rolled in the snow and ran about, wild with delight. During
our whole stay a great part of the time was spent in ski-runs and
seal-hunts, and an agreeable change it was.</p>
<p>Sunday the 15th was spent in setting up tents at the first
dog-camp and at Framheim, as the winter station was named. A team
of dogs was used, and, as they were unused to being driven, it is
not surprising that some lay down, others fought, a few wanted to
go on board, but hardly any of them appreciated the seriousness
of the situation or understood that their good time had come to
an end. On Monday all the dogs were landed, and on the following
day the supplies began to be put ashore.</p>
<p>The landing of the cases was done in this way: the sea-party
brought up on deck as many cases as the drivers could take in one
journey; as the sledges came down to the vessel, the cases were
sent down on to the ice on skids, so that it all went very
rapidly. We would not put the cases out on the ice before the
sledges came back, as, in case the ice should break up, we should
be obliged to heave them all on board again, or we might even
lose them. At night no one was ever allowed to stay on the
ice.</p>
<p>Before we reached the ice, we had counted on having 50 per
cent. of idle days&mdash;that is, from previous descriptions we
had reckoned on having such bad weather half the time that the
<i>Fram</i> would be obliged to leave her moorings. In this
respect we were far luckier than we expected, and only had to put
out twice. The first time was on the night of January 25, when we
had a stiff breeze from the north with some sea, so that the
vessel was bumping rather hard against the ice. Drifting floes
came down upon us, and so as not to be caught by any iceberg that
might suddenly come sailing in from the point of the Barrier we
called Man's Head, we took our moorings on board and went. When
the shore party next morning came down as usual at a swinging
pace, they saw to their astonishment that the <i>Fram</i> was
gone. In the course of the day the weather became fine, and we
tried to go back about noon; but the bay was so full of drift-ice
that we could not come in to the fast ice-foot. About nine in the
evening we saw from the crow's nest that the ice was loosening;
we made the attempt, and by midnight we were again moored.</p>
<p>But the day was not wasted by the shore party, for on the day
before Kristensen, L. Hansen and I had been out on ski and had
shot forty seals, which were taken up to the station while we
were away.</p>
<br>

<br>
<small>ON THE ICE-EDGE, JANUARY, 1911.</small></p>
<br>
<p>Only once or twice more did we have to leave our berth, until
on February 7, when almost all the ice had left the bay, we were
able to moor alongside the low, fast Barrier, where we lay in
peace until we went for good.</p>
<p>There was a great deal of animal life about us. A number of
whales came close in to the vessel, where they stayed still to
look at the uninvited guests. On the ice seals came right up to
the ship, as did large and small flocks of penguins, to have a
look at us. These latter were altogether extraordinarily
inquisitive creatures. Two Emperor penguins often came to our
last moorings to watch us laying out an ice-anchor or hauling on
a hawser, while they put their heads on one side and jabbered,
and they were given the names of "the Harbour-master and his
Missis."</p>
<p>A great number of birds, skua gulls, snowy petrels and
Antarctic petrels, flew round the ship and gave us many a good
"roast ptarmigan."</p>
<p>On the morning of February 4, about 1 a.m., the watchman,
Beck, came and called me with the news that a vessel was coming
in. I guessed at once, of course, that it was the <i>Terra
Nova</i>; but I must confess that I did not feel inclined to turn
out and look at her. We hoisted the colours, however.</p>
<p>As soon as she was moored, Beck told me, some of her party
went ashore, presumably to look for the house. They did not find
it, though, and at 3 a.m. Beck came below again, and said that
now they were coming on board. So then I turned out and received
them. They were Lieutenant Campbell, the leader of Captain
Scott's second shore party, and Lieutenant Pennell, the commander
of the <i>Terra Nova</i>. They naturally asked a number of
questions, and evidently had some difficulty in believing that it
was actually the <i>Fram</i> that was lying here. We had at first
been taken for a whaler. They offered to take our mail to New
Zealand; but we had no mail ready, and had to decline the offer
with thanks. Later in the day a number of the <i>Terra Nova</i>'s
officers went to breakfast at Framheim, and the Chief, Prestrud
and I lunched with them. At about two in the afternoon the
<i>Terra Nova</i> sailed again.</p>
<p>On Friday, February 16, a number of the shore party started on
the first trip to lay down depots. We cleared up, filled our
water-tanks with snow, and made the ship ready for sea. We had
finished this by the evening of the 14th.</p>

Gjertsen, A. Beck, M. R&ouml;nne, A. Kutschin and O. K. Sundbeck.
The first four formed one watch, from eight to two, and the last
five the other, from two to eight. Last, but not least, comes K.

<small>A HUNTING EXPEDITION AT THE FOOT OF THE
BARRIER.</small></p>
<br>
<p>Having made ready for sea, we let go our moorings on the Ice
Barrier at 9 a.m. on February 15, 1911. Hassel, Wisting,
Bjaaland, and Stubberud came down to see us off. As in the course
of the last few days the ice had broken up right to the end of
the bay, we went as far south as possible to take a sounding; the
shallowest we got was 155&frac34; fathoms (285 metres). The bay
ended in a ridge of ice on the east, which was continued in a
northerly direction, so that at the spot where we were stopped by
the Barrier, we reached the most southerly point that a vessel
can attain, so long as the Barrier remains as it is now. Highest
latitude 78&deg; 41' S. When the <i>Terra Nova</i> was here, her
latitude and ours was 78&deg; 38' S.</p>
<p>The last two days before our departure had been calm, and a
thick, dense sludge lay over the whole bay; so dense was it that
the <i>Fram</i> lost her way altogether, and we had to keep going
ahead and astern until we came out into a channel. Seals by the
hundred were lying on the floes, but as we had a quantity of
seal's flesh, we left them in peace for a change.</p>
<p>Before the Chief began the laying out of depots, I received
from him the following orders:</p>
<p align="center"><small>"TO FIRST-LIEUTENANT THORVALD
NILSEN.</small></p>
<p>"With the departure of the <i>Fram</i> from the Ice Barrier,
you will take over the command on board. In accordance with the
plan we have mutually agreed upon</p>
<p>"1. You will sail direct to Buenos Aires, where the necessary
repairs will be executed, provisions taken on board, and the crew
completed. When this has been done,</p>
<p>"2. You will sail from Buenos Aires to carry out
oceanographical observations in the South Atlantic Ocean. It
would be desirable if you could investigate the conditions
between South America and Africa in two sections. These
investigations must, however, be dependent on the prevailing
conditions, and on the time at your disposal. When the time
arrives you will return to Buenos Aires, where the final
preparations will be made for</p>
<p>"3. Your departure for the Ice Barrier to take off the shore
party. The sooner you can make your way in to the Barrier in
1912, the better. I mention no time, as everything depends on
circumstances, and I leave it to you to act according to your
judgment.</p>
<p>"In all else that concerns the interests of the Expedition, I
leave you entire freedom of action.</p>
<p>"If on your return to the Barrier you should find that I am
prevented by illness or death from taking over the leadership of
the Expedition, I place this in your hands, and beg you most
earnestly to endeavour to carry out the original plan of the
Expedition&mdash;the exploration of the North Polar basin.</p>
<p>"With thanks for the time we have spent together, and in the
hope that when we meet again we shall have reached our respective
goals,</p>
<p align="center">"I am,</p>

<br>
<p>When Sir James Ross was in these waters for the first time, in
1842, he marked "Appearance of land" in long. 160&deg; W., and
lat. about 78&deg; S. Afterwards, in 1902, Captain Scott named
this land "King Edward VII. Land." One of the <i>Terra Nova</i>'s
objects was to explore this land; but when we met the ship on
February 4, they told us on board that on account of the ice
conditions they had not been able to land. As no one had ever
been ashore there, I thought it might be interesting to go and
see what it looked like. Consequently our course was laid
north-eastward along the Barrier. During the night a thick
sea-fog came on, and it was only now and then that we could see
the Barrier over our heads. All of a sudden we were close upon a
lofty iceberg, so that we had to put the helm hard over to go
clear. The <i>Fram</i> steers splendidly, however, when she is in
proper trim, and turns as if on a pivot; besides which, it was
calm.</p>
<p>As the day advanced, the weather cleared more and more, and by
noon it was perfectly clear. The sight that then met us was the
lofty Barrier to starboard, and elsewhere all round about some
fifty icebergs, great and small. The Barrier rose from about 100
feet at its edge to something like 1,200 feet.</p>
<p>We followed the Barrier for some distance, but in the
neighbourhood of Cape Colbeck we met the drift-ice, and as I had
no wish to come between this and the Barrier, we stood out in a
north-westerly direction. There is, besides, the disadvantage
about a propeller like ours, that it is apt to wear out the
brasses, so that these have to be renewed from time to time. It
was imperative that this should be done before we came into the
pack-ice, and the sooner the better. When, therefore, we had gone
along the Barrier for about a day and a half without seeing any
bare land, we set our course north-west in open water, and after
we had come some way out we got a slant of easterly wind, so that
the sails could be set. We saw the snow-covered land and the
glare above it all night.</p>
<p>The date had not yet been changed, but as this had to be done,
it was changed on February 15.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* A vessel sailing continuously to the eastward
puts the clock on every day, one hour for every fifteen degrees
of longitude; one sailing westward puts it back in the same way.
In long. 180&deg; one of them has gone twelve hours forward, the
other twelve hours back; the difference is thus twenty-four
hours. In changing the longitude, therefore, one has to change
the date, so that, in passing from east to west longitude, one
will have the same day twice over, and in passing from west to
east longitude a day must be missed.]</p>
<p>At noon on the 16th the propeller was lifted, and by the
evening of the 17th the job was done&mdash;a record in spite of
the temperature. Capital fellows to work, our engineers.</p>
<p>On the night of the 15th we saw the midnight sun unfortunately
for the last time. The same night something dark was sighted on
the port bow; in that light it looked very like an islet. The
sounding apparatus was got ready, and we who were on watch of
course saw ourselves in our minds as great discoverers. I was
already wondering what would be the most appropriate name to give
it, but, alas! the "discovery" became clearer and the
name&mdash;well, it was a rather prosaic one: "Dead Whale Islet";
for it turned out to be a huge inflated whale, that was drifting,
covered with birds.</p>
<p>We went rather slowly north-westward under sail alone. On the
morning of the 17th we saw ice-blink on the starboard bow, and
about noon we were close to the pack itself; it was here quite
thick, and raised by pressure, so that an attempt to get through
it was out of the question. We were, therefore, obliged to follow
the ice to the west. Due aft we saw in the sky the same glare as
above the great Ice Barrier, which may possibly show that the
Barrier turns towards the north and north-west; besides which,
the masses of pressure-ice that collect here must go to show that
it encounters an obstruction, probably the Barrier. When we went
out in 1912 the ice lay in exactly the same place and in the same
way.</p>
<p>Our course was still to the west along the pack-ice, and it
was not till the 20th that we could turn her nose northward
again. For a change we now had a stiff breeze from the
south-east, with thick snow, so we got on very well. On the
whole, the <i>Fram</i> goes much more easily through the water
now than on the way south. Her bottom has probably been cleaned
by the cold water and all the scraping against the ice; besides
which, we have no more than a third of the load with which we
left Norway.</p>
<p>On the night of the 20th we had to light the binnacle-lamps
again, and now the days grew rapidly shorter. It may possibly be
a good thing to have dark nights on land, but at sea it ought
always to be light, especially in these waters, which are more or
less unknown, and full of drifting icebergs.</p>
<p>At 4 p.m. on the 22nd we entered the drift-ice in lat.
70.5&deg; S., long. 177.5&deg; E. The ice was much higher and
uglier than when we were going south, but as there was nothing
but ice as far as we could see both east and west, and it was
fairly loose, we had to make the attempt where there seemed to be
the best chance of getting through.</p>
<p>The seals, which to the south of the ice had been following us
in decreasing numbers, had now disappeared almost entirely, and
curiously enough we saw very few seals in the pack. Luckily,
however, Lieutenant Gjertsen's watch got three seals, and for a
week we were able to enjoy seal-beef, popularly known as
"crocodile beef," three times a day. Seal-beef and fresh
whortleberries&mdash;<i>delicioso!</i></p>
<p>We went comparatively well through the ice, though at
night&mdash;from eleven to one&mdash;we had to slacken speed, as
it was impossible to steer clear on account of the darkness, and
towards morning we had a heavy fall of snow, so that nothing
could be seen, and the engine had to be stopped. When it cleared,
at about 9 a.m., we had come into a dam, out of which we luckily
managed to turn fairly easily, coming out into a bay. This was
formed by over a hundred icebergs, many of which lay in contact
with each other and had packed the ice close together. On the
west was the outlet, which we steered for, and by 10 p.m. on
February 23 we were already out of the ice and in open water. Our
latitude was then 69&deg; S., longitude 175.5&deg; E.</p>
<p>It is very curious to find such calm weather in Ross Sea; in
the two months we have been here we have hardly had a strong
breeze. Thus, when I was relieved at 2 a.m. on the 25th, I wrote
in my diary ". . . It is calm, not a ripple on the water. The
three men forming the watch walk up and down the deck. Now and
then one hears the penguins' cry, <i>kva, kva</i>, but except
these there is no other sound than the <i>tuff, tuff</i> of the
motor, 220 times a minute. Ah, that motor! it goes unweariedly.
It has now gone for 1,000 hours without being cleaned, while on
our Atlantic cruise last year it stopped dead after going for
eighty hours. . . . Right over us we have the Southern Cross, all
round glow the splendid southern lights, and in the darkness can
be seen the gleaming outline of an iceberg. . . ."</p>
<p>On the 26th we crossed the Antarctic Circle, and the same day
the temperature both of air and water rose above 32&deg; F.</p>
<p>It was with sorrow in our hearts that we ate our last piece of
"crocodile beef," but I hoped we should get a good many
albatrosses, which we saw as soon as we came out of the ice. They
were mostly the sooty albatross, that tireless bird that
generally circles alone about the ship and is so difficult to
catch, as he seldom tries to bite at the pork that is used as
bait. When I saw these birds for the first time, as a deck boy, I
was told they were called parsons, because they were the souls of
ungodly clergymen, who had to wait down here till doomsday
without rest.</p>
<p>More or less in our course to Cape Horn there are supposed to
be two groups of islands, the Nimrod group in about long.
158&deg; W., and Dougherty Island in about long. 120&deg; W. They
are both marked "D" (Doubtful) on the English charts. Lieutenant
Shackleton's vessel, the <i>Nimrod</i>, Captain Davis, searched
for both, but found neither; Dougherty Island, however, is said
to have been twice sighted. The <i>Fram</i>'s course was
therefore laid for the Nimrod group. For a time things went very
well, but then we had a week of northerly winds&mdash;that is,
head winds&mdash;and when at last we had a fair wind again, we
were so far to the south-east of them that there was no sense in
sailing back to the north-west to look for doubtful islands; it
would certainly have taken us weeks. Consequently, our course was
laid for Dougherty Island. We had westerly winds for about two
weeks, and were only two or three days' sail from the island in
question, when suddenly we had a gale from the north-east, which
lasted for three days, and ended in a hurricane from the same
quarter. When this was over, we had come according to dead
reckoning about eighty nautical miles to the south-east of the
island; the heavy swell, which lasted for days, made it out of
the question to attempt to go against it with the motor. We
hardly had a glimpse of sun or stars, and weeks passed without
our being able to get an observation, so that for that matter we
might easily be a degree or two out in our reckoning. For the
present, therefore, we must continue to regard these islands as
doubtful.</p>
<p>Moral: Don't go on voyages of discovery, my friend; you're no
good at it!</p>
<p>As soon as we were out of Ross Sea and had entered the South
Pacific Ocean, the old circus started again&mdash;in other words,
the <i>Fram</i> began her everlasting rolling from one side to
the other. When this was at its worst, and cups and plates were
dancing the fandango in the galley, its occupant's only wish was,
"Oh, to be in Buenos Aires!" For that matter, it is not a very
easy job to be cook in such circumstances, but ours was always in
a good humour, singing and whistling all day long. How well the
<i>Fram</i> understands the art of rolling is shown by the
following little episode.</p>
<p>One afternoon a couple of us were sitting drinking coffee on a
tool-box that stood outside the galley. As ill-luck would have
it, during one of the lurches the lashing came loose, and the box
shot along the deck. Suddenly it was checked by an obstacle, and
one of those who were sitting on it flew into the air, through
the galley door, and dashed past the cook with a splendid tiger's
leap, until he landed face downwards at the other end of the
galley, still clinging like grim death to his cup, as though he
wanted something to hold on to. The face he presented after this
successful feat of aviation was extremely comical, and those who
saw it had a hearty fit of laughter.</p>

OUR COOK, CHEERFUL AND CONTENTED AS USUAL.</small></p>
<br>
<p>As has already been said, we went very well for a time after
reaching the Pacific, a fair wind for fourteen days together, and
I began to hope that we were once more in what are called the
"westerlies." However, nothing is perfect in this world, and we
found that out here, as we had icebergs every day, and were
constantly bothered by snow-squalls or fog; the former were, of
course, to be preferred, as it was at any rate clear between the
squalls; but fog is the worst thing of all. It sometimes happened
that all hands were on deck the whole night to work the ship at a
moment's notice, and there were never less than two men on the
lookout forward. The engine, too, was always ready to be started
instantly. A little example will show how ready the crew were at
any time.</p>
<p>One Sunday afternoon, when Hansen, Kristensen and I were on
watch, the wind began to draw ahead, so that we had to beat. It
was blowing quite freshly, but I did not want to call the watch
below, as they might need all the sleep they could get, and
Hansen and I were to put the ship about. Kristensen was steering,
but gave us a hand when he could leave the wheel. As the ship
luffed up into the wind and the sails began to flap pretty
violently, the whole of the watch below suddenly came rushing on
deck in nothing but their unmentionables and started to haul.
Chance willed it that at the same moment an iceberg came out of
the fog, right in front of our bows. It was not many minutes,
either, before we were on the other tack, and the watch below did
not linger long on deck. With so few clothes on it was no
pleasure to be out in that cold, foggy air. They slept so
lightly, then, that it took no more noise than that to wake them.
When I afterwards asked one of them&mdash;I think it was
Beck&mdash;what made them think of coming up, he replied that
they thought we were going to run into an iceberg and were trying
to get out of the way.</p>
<p>It has happened at night that I have seen the ice-blink as far
off as eight miles, and then there is nothing to fear; but
sometimes in the middle of the day we have sailed close to
icebergs that have only been seen a few minutes before we were
right on them. As the voyage was long, we sailed as fast as we
could, as a rule; but on two or three nights we had to reduce our
way to a minimum, as we could not see much farther than the end
of the bowsprit.</p>
<p>After two or three weeks' sailing the icebergs began gradually
to decrease, and I hoped we should soon come to the end of them;
but on Sunday, March 5, when it was fairly clear, we saw about
midday a whole lot of big bergs ahead. One of the watch below,
who had just come on deck, exclaimed: "What the devil is this
beastly mess you fellows have got into?" He might well ask, for
in the course of that afternoon we passed no less than about a
hundred bergs. They were big tabular bergs, all of the same
height, about 100 feet, or about as high as the crow's-nest of
the <i>Fram</i>. The bergs were not the least worn, but looked as
if they had calved quite recently. As I said, it was clear
enough, we even got an observation that day (lat. 61&deg; S.,
long. 150&deg; W.), and as we had a west wind, we twisted quite
elegantly past one iceberg after another. The sea, which during
the morning had been high enough for the spray to dash over the
tops of the bergs, gradually went down, and in the evening, when
we were well to leeward of them all, it was as smooth as if we
had been in harbour. In the course of the night we passed a good
many more bergs, and the next day we only saw about twenty.</p>
<p>In the various descriptions of voyages in these waters,
opinions are divided as to the temperature of the water falling
in the neighbourhood of icebergs. That it falls steadily as one
approaches the pack-ice is certain enough, but whether it falls
for one or a few scattered icebergs, no doubt depends on
circumstances.</p>
<p>One night at 12 o'clock we had a temperature in the water of
34.1&deg; F., at 4 a.m. 33.8&deg; F., and at 8 a.m. 33.6&deg; F.;
at 6 a.m. we passed an iceberg. At 12 noon the temperature had
risen to 33.9&deg; F. In this case one might say that the
temperature gave warning, but, as a rule, in high latitudes it
has been constant both before and after passing an iceberg.</p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, 1911, when on our second trip southward we
saw the first real iceberg, the temperature of the water fell in
four hours from 35.6&deg; F. to 32.7&deg; F., which was the
temperature when the bergs were passed, after which it rose
rather rapidly to 35&deg; F.</p>
<p>In the west wind belt I believe one can tell with some degree
of certainty when one is approaching ice. In the middle of
November, 1911, between Prince Edward Island and the Crozet
Islands (about lat. 47&deg; S.) the temperature fell. Towards
morning I remarked to someone: "The temperature of the water is
falling as if we were getting near the ice." On the forenoon of
the same day we sailed past a very small berg; the temperature
again rose to the normal, and we met no more ice until Christmas
Eve.</p>
<p>On Saturday, March 4, the day before we met that large
collection of bergs, the temperature fell pretty rapidly from
33.9&deg; F. to 32.5&deg; F. We had not then seen ice for nearly
twenty-four hours. At the same time the colour of the water
became unusually green, and it is possible that we had come into
a cold current. The temperature remained as low as this till
Sunday morning, when at 8 a. m. it rose to 32.7&deg; F.; at 12
noon, close to a berg, to 32.9&deg; F., and a mile to lee of it,
to 33&deg; F. It continued to rise, and at 4 p.m., when the bergs
were thickest, it was 33.4&deg; F.; at 8 p.m. 33.6&deg; F., and
at midnight 33.8&deg; F. If there had been a fog, we should
certainly have thought we were leaving the ice instead of
approaching it; it is very curious, too, that the temperature of
the water should not be more constant in the presence of such a
great quantity of ice; but, as I have said, it may have been a
current.</p>
<p>In the course of the week following March 5 the bergs became
rarer, but the same kind of weather prevailed. Our speed was
irreproachable, and in one day's work (from noon to noon) we
covered a distance of 200 nautical miles, or an average of about
82 knots an hour, which was the best day's work the <i>Fram</i>
had done up to that time. The wind; which had been westerly and
north-westerly, went by degrees to the north, and ended in a
hurricane from the north-east on Sunday, March 12. I shall quote
here what I wrote about this in my diary on the 13th:</p>
<p>"Well, now we have experienced the first hurricane on the
<i>Fram</i>. On Saturday afternoon, the 11th, the wind went to
the north-east, as an ordinary breeze with rain. The barometer
had been steady between 29.29 inches (744 millimetres) and 29.33
inches (745 millimetres). During the afternoon it began to fall,
and at 8 p.m. it was 29.25 inches (743 millimetres) without the
wind having freshened at all. The outer jib was taken in,
however. By midnight the barometer had fallen to 29.0 inches (737
millimetres), while the wind had increased to a stiff breeze. We
took in the foresail, mainsail, and inner jib, and had now only
the topsail and a storm-trysail left. The wind gradually
increased to a gale. At 4 a.m. on Sunday the barometer had fallen
again to 28.66 inches (728 millimetres), and at 6 a.m. the
topsail was made fast.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* For the benefit of those who know what a
buntline on a sail is, I may remark that besides the usual
topsail buntlines we had six extra buntlines round the whole
sail, so that when it was clewed up it was, so to speak, made
fast. We got the sail clewed up without its going to pieces, but
it took us over an hour. We had to take this precaution, of
having so many buntlines, as we were short-handed.]</p>
<p>"The wind increased and the seas ran higher, but we did not
ship much water. At 8 a.m. the barometer was 28.30 inches (719
millimetres), and at 9 a.m. 28.26 inches (718 millimetres), when
at last it stopped going down and remained steady till about
noon, during which time a furious hurricane was blowing. The
clouds were brown, the colour of chocolate; I cannot remember
ever having seen such an ugly sky. Little by little the wind went
to the north, and we sailed large under two storm-trysails.
Finally, we had the seas on our beam, and now the <i>Fram</i>
showed herself in all her glory as the best sea-boat in the
world. It was extraordinary to watch how she behaved. Enormous
seas came surging high to windward, and we, who were standing on
the bridge, turned our backs to receive them, with some such
remark as: 'Ugh, that's a nasty one coming.' But the sea never
came. A few yards from the ship it looked over the bulwarks and
got ready to hurl itself upon her. But at the last moment the
<i>Fram</i> gave a wriggle of her body and was instantly at the
top of the wave, which slipped under the vessel. Can anyone be
surprised if one gets fond of such a ship? Then she went down
with the speed of lightning from the top of the wave into the
trough, a fall of fourteen or fifteen yards. When we sank like
this, it gave one the same feeling as dropping from the twelfth
to the ground-floor in an American express elevator, 'as if
everything inside you was coming up.' It was so quick that we
seemed to be lifted off the deck. We went up and down like this
all the afternoon and evening, till during the night the wind
gradually dropped and it became calm. That the storm would not be
of long duration might almost be assumed from its suddenness, and
the English rule&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">"'Long foretold, long last;<br>
Short notice, soon past'&mdash;</p>
<p>may thus be said to have held good.</p>
<p>"When there is a strong wind on her beam, the <i>Fram</i> does
not roll so much as usual, except for an occasional leeward
lurch; nor was any excessive quantity of water shipped in this
boisterous sea. The watch went below as usual when they were
relieved, and, as somebody very truly remarked, all hands might
quite well have turned in, if we had not had to keep a lookout
for ice. And fortune willed it that the day of the hurricane was
the first since we had left the Barrier that we did not see
ice&mdash;whether this was because the spray was so high that it
hid our view, or because there really was none. Be that as it
may, the main thing was that we saw no ice. During the night we
had a glimpse of the full moon, which gave the man at the wheel
occasion to call out 'Hurrah!'&mdash;and with good reason, as we
had been waiting a long time for the moon to help us in looking
out for ice.</p>
<p>"In weather like this one notices nothing out of the ordinary
below deck. Here hardly anything is heard of the wind, and in the
after-saloon, which is below the water-line, it is perfectly
comfortable. The cook, who resides below, therefore reckons 'ugly
weather' according to the motion of the vessel, and not according
to storms, fog, or rain. On deck we do not mind much how it
blows, so long as it is only clear, and the wind is not against
us. How little one hears below deck may be understood from the
fact that yesterday morning, while it was blowing a hurricane,
the cook went about as usual, whistling his two verses of 'The
Whistling Bowery Boy.' While he was in the middle of the first, I
came by and told him that it was blowing a hurricane if he cared
to see what it looked like. 'Oh, yes,' he said, 'I could guess it
was blowing, for the galley fire has never drawn so well; the
bits of coal are flying up the chimney'; and then he whistled
through the second verse. All the same, he could not resist going
up to see. It was not long before he came down again, with a 'My
word, it <i>is</i> blowing, and waves up to the sky!' No; it was
warmer and more cosy below among his pots and pans.</p>
<p>"For dinner, which was eaten as usual amid cheerful
conversation, we had green-pea soup, roast sirloin, with a glass
of <i>aquavit</i>, and caramel pudding; so it may be seen that
the cook was not behindhand in opening tins, even in a hurricane.
After dinner we enjoyed our usual Sunday cigar, while the canary,
which has become Kristensen's pet, and hangs in his cabin, sang
at the top of its voice."</p>
<p>On March 14 we saw the last iceberg; during the whole trip we
had seen and passed between 500 and 600 bergs.</p>
<p>The wind held steady from the north-east for a week and a
half, and I was beginning to think we should be stuck down here
to play the Flying Dutchman. There was every possible sign of a
west wind, but it did not come. On the night of the 17th it
cleared; light cirrus clouds covered the sky, and there was a
ring about the moon. This, together with the heavy swell and the
pronounced fall of the barometer, showed that something might be
expected. And, sure enough, on Sunday, March 19, we were in a
cyclone. By manoeuvring according to the rules for avoiding a
cyclone in the southern hemisphere, we at any rate went well
clear of one semicircle. About 4 p.m. on Sunday afternoon the
barometer was down to 27.56 inches (700 millimetres), the lowest
barometer reading I have ever heard of. From noon to 4 p.m. there
was a calm, with heavy sea. Immediately after a gale sprang up
from the north-west, and in the course of a couple of days it
slowly moderated to a breeze from the same quarter.</p>
<p>Sunday, March 5, a hundred icebergs; Sunday March 12, a
hurricane; and Sunday, March 19, a cyclone: truly three pleasant
"days of rest."</p>
<p>The curves given on the next page, which show the course of
barometric pressure for a week, from Monday to Monday, are
interesting.</p>

<p>On this trip the fore-saloon was converted into a sail-loft,
where R&ouml;nne and Hansen carried on their work, each in his
watch. The after-saloon was used as a common mess-room, as it is
warmer, and the motion is far less felt than forward.</p>
<p>From the middle of March it looked as if the equinoctial gales
were over, for we had quite fine weather all the way to Buenos
Aires. Cape Horn was passed on March 31 in the most delightful
weather&mdash;a light westerly breeze, not a cloud in the sky,
and only a very slight swell from the west. Who would have
guessed that such splendid weather was to be found in these
parts?&mdash;and that in March, the most stormy month of the
year.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Gjertsen and Kutschin collected plankton all the
time; the latter smiled all over his face whenever he chanced to
get one or two "tadpoles" in his tow-net.</p>
<p>From the Falkland Islands onward the <i>Fram</i> was washed
and painted, so that we might not present too "Polar" an
appearance on arrival at Buenos Aires.</p>
<p>It may be mentioned as a curious fact that the snow with which
we filled our water-tanks on the Barrier did not melt till we
were in the River La Plata, which shows what an even temperature
is maintained in the <i>Fram</i>'s hold.</p>
<p>About midday on Easter Sunday we were at the mouth of the
River La Plata, without seeing land, however. During the night
the weather became perfect, a breeze from the south, moonlight
and starry, and we went up the river by soundings and
observations of the stars until at 1 a.m. on Monday, when we had
the Recalada light-ship right ahead. We had not seen any light
since we left Madeira on September 9. At 2.30 the same morning we
got a pilot aboard, and at seven in the evening we anchored in
the roads of Buenos Aires.</p>
<p>We had then been nearly once round the world, and for over
seven months the anchor had not been out.</p>
<p>We had reckoned on a two months' voyage from the ice, and it
had taken us sixty-two days.</p>

<h3>IV.<br>
<br>
<small>THE OCEANOGRAPHICAL CRUISE.</small></h3>
<p>According to the programme, the <i>Fram</i> was to go on an
oceanographical cruise in the South Atlantic, and my orders were
that this was to be arranged to suit the existing circumstances.
I had reckoned on a cruise of about three months. We should have
to leave Buenos Aires at the beginning of October to be down in
the ice at the right time (about the New Year).</p>
<p>As we were too short-handed to work the ship, take soundings,
etc., the following four seamen were engaged: H. Halvorsen, A.
Olsen, F. Steller, and J. Andersen.</p>
<p>At last we were more or less ready, and the <i>Fram</i> sailed
from Buenos Aires on June 8, 1911, the anniversary of our leaving
Horten on our first hydrographic cruise in the North Atlantic. I
suppose there was no one on board on June 8, 1910, who dreamed
that a year later we should go on a similar cruise in the
South.</p>
<p>We had a pilot on board as far as Montevideo, where we arrived
on the afternoon of the 9th; but on account of an increasing wind
(pampero) we had to lie at anchor here for a day and a half, as
the pilot could not be taken off. On Saturday afternoon, the
10th, he was fetched off by a big tug-boat, on board of which was
the Secretary of the Norwegian Consulate. This gentleman asked us
if we could not come into the harbour, as "people would like to
see the ship." I promised to come in on the way back, "if we had
time."</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, the 11th, we weighed anchor, and went out
in the most lovely weather that can be imagined. Gradually the
land disappeared, and in the course of the evening we lost the
lights; we were once more out in the Atlantic, and immediately
everything resumed its old course.</p>
<p>In order to save our supply of preserved provisions as much as
possible, we took with us a quantity of live poultry, and no
fewer than twenty live sheep, which were quartered in the
"farmyard" on the port side of the vessel's fore-deck. Sheep and
hens were all together, and there was always a most beautiful
scent of hay, so that we had not only sea air, but "country air."
In spite of all this delightful air, three or four of the crew
were down with influenza, and had to keep their berths for some
days.</p>
<p>I reckoned on being back at Buenos Aires by the beginning of
September, and on getting, if possible, one station a day. The
distance, according to a rough calculation, was about 8,000
nautical miles, and I laid down the following plan: To go about
east by north with the prevailing northerly and north-westerly
winds to the coast of Africa, and there get hold of the
south-east trade. If we could not reach Africa before that date,
then to turn on July 22 and lay our course with the south-east
trade for St. Helena, which we could reach before August 1; from
there again with the same wind to South Trinidad (August 11 or
12); on again with easterly and north-easterly winds on a
south-westerly course until about August 22, when the
observations were to be concluded, and we should try to make
Buenos Aires in the shortest time.</p>
<p>That was the plan that we attempted. On account of the fresh
water from the River La Plata, we did not begin at once to take
samples of water, and with a head-wind, north-east, we lay
close-hauled for some days. We also had a pretty stiff breeze,
which was another reason for delaying the soundings until the
17th.</p>
<p>For taking samples of water a winch is used, with a
sounding-line of, let us say, 5,000 metres (2,734 fathoms), on
which are hung one or more tubes for catching water; we used
three at once to save time. Now, supposing water and temperatures
are to be taken at depths of 300, 400, and 500 metres (164, 218,
and 273 fathoms), Apparatus III. (see diagram) is first hung on,
about 20 metres (10 fathoms) from the end of the line, where a
small weight (<i>a</i>) hangs; then it is lowered until the
indicator-wheel, over which the line passes, shows 100 metres (54
fathoms); Apparatus II. is then put on, and it is lowered again
for another 100 metres, when Apparatus I. is put on and the line
paid out for 300 metres (164 fathoms)&mdash;that is, until the
indicator-wheel shows 500 metres (273 fathoms). The upper
Apparatus (I.) is then at 300 metres (164 fathoms), No. II. at
400 metres (218 fathoms), and No. III. at 500 metres (273
fathoms). Under Apparatus I. and II. is hung a slipping sinker
(about 8 centimetres, or 3&frac14; inches, long, and 3
centimetres, or 1&frac14; inches, in diameter). To the
water-samplers are attached thermometers (<i>b</i>) in tubes
arranged for the purpose.</p>
<p>The water-samplers themselves consist of a brass cylinder
(<i>c</i>), about 38 centimetres (15 inches) long and 4
centimetres (1&frac12; inches) in diameter (about half a litre of
water), set in a frame (<i>d</i>). At about the middle of the
cylinder are pivots, which rest in bearings on the frame, so that
the cylinder can be swung 180 degrees (straight up and down).</p>
<p>The cylinder, while being lowered in an inverted position, is
open at both ends, so that the water can pass through. But at its
upper and lower ends are valves, working on hinges and provided
with packing. When the apparatus is released, the cylinder swings
round, and these valves then automatically close the ends of the
cylinder. The water that is thus caught in the cylinder at the
required depth remains in it while it is being heaved up, and is
collected in bottles. When the apparatus is released, the column
of mercury in the thermometer is broken, and the temperature of
the water is read at the same depth as the water is taken
from.</p>
<p>The release takes place in the following manner: when all the
cylinders have been lowered to the required depths, they are left
hanging for a few minutes, so that the thermometers may be set at
the right temperature before the column of mercury is broken.
Then a slipping sinker is sent down the line. When this sinker
strikes the first apparatus, a spring is pressed, a hook
(<i>e</i>) which has held the cylinder slips loose, and the
cylinder turns completely over (Apparatus I.). As it does this,
the valves, as already mentioned, close the ends of the cylinder,
which is fixed in its new position by a hook in the bottom of the
frame. At the same instant the slipping sinker that hangs under
Apparatus I. is released, and continues the journey to Apparatus
II., where the same thing happens. It is then repeated with
Apparatus III. When they are all ready, they are heaved in.</p>
<p>By holding one's finger on the line one can feel, at all
events in fairly calm weather, when the sinkers strike against
the cylinders; but I used to look at my watch, as it takes about
half a minute for the sinker to go down 100 metres.</p>
<p>The necessary data are entered in a book.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 17th, then, the sails were clewed up,
and the <i>Fram</i> began to roll even worse than with the sails
set. We first tried taking soundings with a sinker of 66 pounds,
and a tube for taking specimens of the sea-bed. At 2,000 metres
(1,093 fathoms) or more the line (piano wire) broke, so that
sinker, tube, and over 2,000 metres of line continued their way
unhindered to the bottom. I had thought of taking samples of
water at 4,000, 3,000, and 2,000 metres (2,187, 1,639, 1,093
fathoms), and so on, and water-cylinders were put on from 0 to
2,000 metres. This, however, took six hours. Next day, on account
of the heavy sea, only a few samples from 0 to 100 metres (54
fathoms) were taken. On the third day we made another attempt to
get the bottom. This time we got specimens of the sea-bed from
about 4,500 metres (about 2,500 fathoms); but the heaving in and
taking of water samples and temperatures occupied eight hours,
from 7 a.m. till 3 p.m., or a third part of the twenty-four
hours. In this way we should want at least nine months on the
route that had been laid down; but as, unfortunately, this time
was not at our disposal, we at once gave up taking specimens of
the bottom and samples of water at greater depths than 1,000
metres (546 fathoms). For the remainder of the trip we took
temperatures and samples of water at the following depths: 0, 5,
10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 750, and 1,000
metres (0, 2&frac34;, 5&frac12;, 13&frac12;, 27, 41, 54, 81, 108,
135, 164, 218, 273, 410, and 546 fathoms), in all, fifteen
samples from each station, and from this time forward we went on
regularly with one station every day. Finally, we managed to
heave up two water-cylinders on the same line by hand without
great difficulty. At first this was done with the motor and
sounding-machine, but this took too long, and we afterwards used
nothing but a light hand-winch. Before very long we were so
practised that the whole business only took two hours.</p>
<p>These two hours were those we liked best of the twenty-four.
All kinds of funny stories were told, especially about
experiences in Buenos Aires, and every day there was something
new. Here is a little yarn:</p>
<p>One of the members of the expedition had been knocked down by
a motor-car in one of the busiest streets; the car stopped and of
course a crowd collected at once. Our friend lay there, wondering
whether he ought not to be dead, or at least to have broken a
leg, so as to get compensation. While he lay thus, being prodded
and examined by the public, he suddenly remembered that he had
half a dollar in his pocket. With all that money it didn't matter
so much about the compensation; up jumped our friend like an
india-rubber ball, and in a second he had vanished in the crowd,
who stood open-mouthed, gazing after the "dead" man.</p>
<p>Our speed on this cruise was regulated as nearly as possible
so that there might be about 100 nautical miles between each
station, and I must say we were uncommonly lucky in the weather.
We made two fairly parallel sections with comparatively regular
intervals between the stations; as regular, in any case, as one
can hope to get with a vessel like the <i>Fram</i>, which really
has too little both of sail area and engine power. The number of
stations was 60 in all and 891 samples of water were taken. Of
plankton specimens 190 were sent home. The further examination of
these specimens in Norway will show whether the material
collected is of any value, and whether the cruise has yielded
satisfactory results.</p>
<p>As regards the weather on the trip, it was uniformly good the
whole time; we had a good deal of wind now and then, with seas
and rolling, but for the most part there was a fresh breeze. In
the south-east trade we sailed for four weeks at a stretch
without using the engine, which then had a thorough overhauling.
At the same time we had a good opportunity of smartening up the
ship, which she needed badly. All the iron was freed from rust,
and the whole vessel painted both below and above deck. The decks
themselves were smeared with a mixture of oil, tar and
turpentine, after being scoured. All the rigging was examined. At
the anchorage at Buenos Aires nearly the whole ship was painted
again, masts and yards, the outside of the vessel and everything
inboard, both deck-houses, the boats and the various winches,
pumps, etc. In the engine-room everything was either shining
bright or freshly painted, everything hung in its place and such
order and cleanliness reigned that it was a pleasure to go down
there. The result of all this renovating and smartening up was
that, when we fetched up by the quay at Buenos Aires, the
<i>Fram</i> looked brighter than I suppose she has ever done
since she was new.</p>
<p>During the trip the holds were also cleaned up, and all the
provisions re-stowed and an inventory made of them.</p>
<p>A whole suit of sails was completely worn out on this voyage;
but what can one expect when the ship is being worked every
single day, with clewing up, making fast and setting of sails
both in calms and winds? This work every day reminded me of the
corvette <i>Ellida</i>, when the order was "all hands aloft." As
a rule, though, it was only clewing up the sails that had to be
done, as we always had to take soundings on the weather side, so
that the sounding-line should not foul the bottom of the vessel
and smash the apparatus. And we did not lose more than one
thermometer in about nine hundred soundings.</p>
<p>On account of all this wear and tear of sails R&ouml;nne was
occupied the whole time, both at sea and in Buenos Aires, in
making and patching sails, as there was not much more than the
leeches left of those that had been used, and on the approaching
trip (to the Ice Barrier) we should have to have absolutely
first-class things in the "Roaring Forties."</p>
<p>June 30, 1911, is a red-letter day in the <i>Fram</i>'s
history, as on that day we intersected our course from Norway to
the Barrier, and the <i>Fram</i> thus completed her first
circumnavigation of the globe. Bravo, <i>Fram</i>! It was well
done, especially after the bad character you have been given as a
sailer and a sea-boat. In honour of the occasion we had a better
dinner than usual, and the <i>Fram</i> was congratulated by all
present on having done her work well.</p>
<p>On the evening of July 29 St. Helena was passed. It was the
first time I had seen this historic island. It was very strange
to think that "the greatest spirit of a hundred centuries," as
some author has called Napoleon, should have ending his restless
life on this lonely island of the South Atlantic.</p>
<p>On August 12, when daylight came, we sighted the little Martin
Vaz Islands ahead, and a little later South Trinidad (in 1910
this island was passed on October 16). We checked our
chronometers, which, however, proved to be correct. From noon
till 2 p.m., while we were lying still and taking our daily
hydrographic observations, a sailing ship appeared to the north
of us, lying close-hauled to the south. She bore down on us and
ran up her flag, and we exchanged the usual greetings; she was a
Norwegian barque bound for Australia. Otherwise we did not see
more than four or five ships on the whole voyage, and those were
pretty far off:</p>
<p>Never since leaving Madeira (September, 1910) had we been
troubled with animals or insects of any kind whatever; but when
we were in Buenos Aires for the first time, at least half a
million flies came aboard to look at the vessel. I hoped they
would go ashore when the <i>Fram</i> sailed; but no, they
followed us, until by degrees they passed peacefully away on
fly-paper.</p>
<p>Well, flies are one thing, but we had something else that was
worse&mdash;namely, rats&mdash;our horror and dread, and for the
future our deadly enemies. The first signs of them I found in my
bunk and on the table in the fore-saloon; they were certainly not
particular. What I said on that occasion had better not be
printed, though no expression could be strong enough to give vent
to one's annoyance at such a discovery. We set traps, but what
was the use of that, when the cargo consisted exclusively of
provisions?</p>
<p>One morning, as R&ouml;nne was sitting at work making sails,
he observed a "shadow" flying past his feet, and, according to
his account, into the fore-saloon. The cook came roaring:
"There's a rat in the fore-saloon!" Then there was a lively
scene; the door was shut, and all hands started hunting. All the
cabins were emptied and rummaged, the piano, too; everything was
turned upside down, but the rat had vanished into thin air.</p>
<p>About a fortnight later I noticed a corpse-like smell in
Hassel's cabin, which was empty. On closer sniffing and
examination it turned out to be the dead rat, a big black one,
unfortunately a male rat. The poor brute, that had starved to
death, had tried to keep itself alive by devouring a couple of
novels that lay in a locked drawer. How the rat got into that
drawer beats me.</p>
<p>On cleaning out the provision hold nests were found with
several rats in them: six were killed, but at least as many
escaped, so now no doubt we have a whole colony. A reward was
promised of ten cigars for each rat; traps were tried again, but
all this did very little good. When we were in Buenos Aires for
the second time we got a cat on board; it certainly kept the rats
down, but it was shot on the Barrier. At Hobart we provided a few
traps, which caught a good many; but we shall hardly get rid of
them altogether until we have landed most of the provisions, and
smoked them out.</p>
<p>We have also had a lot of moth; at present they have done
nothing beyond eating a couple of holes in my best trousers.</p>
<p>During the whole of this cruise we had a fishing-line hanging
out, but it hung for a whole month without there being a sign of
a fish, in spite of the most delicate little white rag that was
attached to the hook. One morning the keenest of our fishermen
came up as usual and felt the line. Yes, by Jove! at last there
was one, and a big one, too, as he could hardly haul in the line
by himself. There was a shout for assistance. "Hi, you beggar!
come and lend a hand; there's a big fish!" Help came in a second,
and they both hauled for all they were worth. "Ah! he's a fine,
glistening fish; it'll be grand to get fresh fish for dinner!" At
last the fish appeared over the rail; but, alas! it was seen to
have no head. It was an ordinary stockfish, about three-quarters
of a yard long, that some joker had hung on the line during the
night. That we all had a hearty laugh goes without saying, the
fishermen included, as they took it all in good part.</p>
<p>As a fishing-boat the <i>Fram</i> is on the whole not very
successful. The only fish we caught, besides the above-mentioned
stockfish, was a real live fish; but, unfortunately, it fell off
the hook as it was being hauled in. According to the account of
eye-witnesses, this fish was . . . six feet long and one
broad.</p>
<p>Now we don't fish any more.</p>
<p>On August 19 the hydrographic observations were brought to an
end, and a course was laid for Buenos Aires, where we anchored in
the roads at midnight on September 1.</p>

<h3>V.<br>
<br>
<small>AT BUENOS AIRES.</small></h3>
<p>To arrive at Buenos Aires in the early part of 1911 was not an
unmixed pleasure, especially when one had no money. The
<i>Fram</i> Expedition was apparently not very popular at that
time, and our cash balance amounted to about forty pesos (about
&pound;3 10s.), but that would not go very far; our supply of
provisions had shrunk to almost nothing, and we had not enough to
be able to leave the port. I had been told that a sum had been
placed to the credit of the <i>Fram</i> for our stay in Buenos
Aires, but I neither saw nor heard anything of it while we were
there, and it was no doubt somewhat imaginary.</p>
<p>If we were to be at all able to go down and take off the shore
party money must be found. We had come to the end of sail-cloth
and ropes, we had too little food and a minimum of oil; all this
would have to be provided. At the worst the oceanographical
cruise could be cut out, and we could lie still at Buenos Aires;
then, as our comrades could not very well be left to perish on
the ice, enough would have to be sent us from Norway to enable us
to go down there; but that would finish the whole expedition, as
in such a case the <i>Fram</i> had orders to go back to
Norway.</p>
<p>As usual, however, the <i>Fram</i>'s luck helped her again. A
few days before we left Norway our distinguished compatriot in
Buenos Aires, Don Pedro Christophersen, had cabled that he would
supply us with what provisions we might require, if, after
leaving Madeira, we would call at Buenos Aires. Of course, he did
not know at that time that the voyage would be extended to
include the South Pole, and that the <i>Fram</i> on arrival at
Buenos Aires would be almost empty instead of having a full
cargo, but that did not prevent his helping us. I immediately
called on him and his brother, the Norwegian Minister;
fortunately, they were both very enthusiastic about our Chief's
change of plan.</p>
<p>When, on a subsequent occasion, I expressed my astonishment at
not hearing from home, I was told that the funds of the
Expedition were exhausted, and Mr. Christophersen promised me, on
hearing what straits we were in, to pay all our expenses in
Buenos Aires, and to supply us with provisions and fuel. That
brought us out of our difficulties at a bound, and we had no more
need to take thought for the morrow.</p>
<p>Everyone on board received a sum of money for his personal
expenses from the Norwegian colony of the River Plate, and we
were invited to their dinner on Independence Day, May 17.</p>
<p>Our second stay at Buenos Aires was very pleasant; everyone
was amiability itself, and festivities were even got up for us.
We took on board provisions that had been sent out from Norway by
Mr. Christophersen's orders, about 50,000 litres (11,000 gallons)
of petroleum, ship's stores, and so on; enough for a year. But
this was not all. Just before we sailed Mr. Christophersen said
he would send a relief expedition, if the <i>Fram</i> did not
return to Australia by a certain date; but, as everyone knows,
this was happily unnecessary.</p>
<p>During the three weeks we were lying at the quay in Buenos
Aires we were occupied in getting everything on board, and making
the vessel ready for sea. We had finished this by the afternoon
of Wednesday, October 4, and next morning the Pram was ready to
continue her second circumnavigation of the globe.</p>
<p>In Buenos Aires we lay at the same quay as the
<i>Deutschland</i>, the German Antarctic Expedition's ship.</p>
<p>A. Kutschin and the second engineer, J. N&ouml;dtvedt, went
home, and seaman J. Andersen was discharged.</p>

<h3>VI.<br>
<br>
<small>FROM BUENOS AIRES TO THE ROSS BARRIER.</small></h3>
<p>On the trip from Buenos Aires to the Barrier the watches were
divided as follows: From eight to two: T. Nilsen, L. Hansen, H.
Halvorsen, and A. Olsen. From two to eight: H. Gjertsen, A. Beck,
M. R&ouml;nne, and F. Steller. In the engine-room: K. Sundbeck
and H. Kristensen. Lastly, K. Olsen, cook. In all eleven men.</p>
<p>It is said that "well begun is half done," and it almost seems
as if a bad beginning were likely to have a similar continuation.
When we left the northern basin on the morning of October 5,
there was a head wind, and it was not till twenty-four hours
later that we could drop the pilot at the Recalada lightship.
After a time it fell calm, and we made small progress down the
River La Plata, until, on the night of the 6th, we were clear of
the land, and the lights disappeared on the horizon.</p>
<p>Properly speaking, we ought to have been in the west wind belt
as soon as we came out, and the drift of the clouds and movement
of the barograph were examined at least twenty-four times a day,
but it still remained calm. At last, after the lapse of several
days, we had a little fresh south-westerly wind with hail
showers, and then, of course, I thought we had made a beginning;
but unfortunately it only lasted a night, so that our joy was
short-lived.</p>
<p>We took with us from Buenos Aires fifteen live sheep and
fifteen live little pigs, for which two houses were built on the
after-deck; as, however, one of the pigs was found dead on the
morning after the south-westerly breeze just mentioned, I assumed
that this was on account of the cold, and another house was at
once built for them between decks (in the work-room), where it
was very warm. They were down here the whole time; but as their
house was cleaned out twice a day and dry straw put on the floor,
they did not cause us much inconvenience; besides which, their
house was raised more than half a foot above the deck itself, so
that the space below could always be kept clean. The pigs thrived
so well down here that we could almost see them growing; on
arrival at the Barrier we had no fewer than nine alive.</p>
<p>The sheep had a weather-tight house with a tarpaulin over the
roof, and they grew fatter and fatter; we had every opportunity
of noticing this, as we killed one of them regularly every
Saturday until we came into the pack-ice and got seal-meat. We
had four sheep left on reaching the Barrier.</p>
<p>We did wretchedly in October&mdash;calms and east winds,
nothing but east winds; as regards distance it was the worst
month we had had since leaving Norway, notwithstanding that the
<i>Fram</i> had been in dry dock, had a clean bottom and a light
cargo. When close-hauled with any head sea, we scarcely move; a
stiff fair wind is what is wanted if we are to get on. Somebody
said we got on so badly because we had thirteen pigs on board;
another said it was because we caught so many birds, and I had
caught no less than fourteen albatrosses and four Cape pigeons.
Altogether there is quite enough of what I will call superstition
at sea. One particular bird brings fine weather, another storms;
it is very important to notice which way the whale swims or the
dolphin leaps; the success of seal-hunting depends on whether the
first seal is seen ahead or astern, and so on. Enough of
that.</p>
<p>October went out and November came in with a fresh breeze from
the south-south-west, so that we did nine and a half knots. This
promised well for November, but the promise was scarcely
fulfilled. We had northerly wind or southerly wind continually,
generally a little to the east of north or south, and I believe I
am not saying too much when I state that in the "west wind belt"
with an easterly course we lay close-hauled on one tack or the
other for about two-thirds of the way. For only three days out of
three months did we have a real west wind, a wind which, with
south-westerly and north-westerly winds, I had reckoned on having
for 75 per cent. of the trip from Buenos Aires to about the
longitude of Tasmania.</p>
<p>In my enthusiasm over the west wind in question, I went so far
as to write in my diary at 2 a.m. on November 11: "There is a
gale from the west, and we are making nine knots with foresail
and topsail. The sea is pretty high and breaking on both sides of
the vessel, so that everything about us is a mass of spray. In
spite of this, not a drop of water comes on deck, and it is so
dry that the watch are going about in clogs. For my part I am
wearing felt slippers, which will not stand wet. Sea-boots and
oilskins hang ready in the chart-house, in case it should rain.
On a watch like to-night, when the moon is kind enough to shine,
everyone on deck is in the best of humours, whistling,
chattering, and singing. Somebody comes up with the remark that
'She took that sea finely,' or 'Now she's flying properly.'
'Fine' is almost too feeble an expression; one ought to say
'lightly and elegantly' when speaking of the <i>Fram</i> . . . .
What more can one wish?" etc.</p>
<p>But whatever time Adam may have spent in Paradise, we were not
there more than three days, and then the same wretched state of
things began again. What I wrote when there was a head wind or
calm, I should be sorry to reproduce. Woe to him who then came
and said it was fine weather.</p>
<p>It was lucky for us that the <i>Fram</i> sails so much more
easily now than in 1910, otherwise we should have taken six
months to reach the Barrier. When we had wind, we used it to the
utmost; but we did not do this without the loss of one or two
things; the new jib-sheet broke a couple of times, and one night
we carried away the outer bobstay of the jib-boom. The foresail
and topsail were neither made fast nor reefed during the whole
trip.</p>
<p>The last time the jib-sheet broke there was a strong breeze
from the south-west with a heavy sea; all sail was set with the
exception of the spanker, as the ship would not steer with that.
There was an extra preventer on the double jib-sheet, but in
spite of that the sheets broke and the jib was split with a
fearful crack. Within a minute the mainsail and gaff-topsail were
hauled down, so that the ship might fall off, and the jib hauled
down. This was instantly unbent and a new one bent. The man at
the helm, of course, got the blame for this, and the first thing
he said to me was "I couldn't help it, she was twisting on the
top of a wave." We were then making ten knots, and more than that
we shall not do.</p>
<p>The <i>Fram</i> rolled well that day. A little earlier in the
afternoon, at two o'clock, when the watch had gone below to
dinner and were just eating the sweet, which on that occasion
consisted of preserved pears, we felt that there was an unusually
big lurch coming. Although, of course, we had fiddles on the
table, the plates, with meat, potatoes, etc., jumped over the
fiddles, which they didn't care a button for, into Beck's cabin.
I caught one of the pears in its flight, but the plate with the
rest of them went on its way. Of course there was a great shout
of laughter, which stopped dead as we heard a violent noise on
deck, over our heads; I guessed at once it was an empty
water-tank that had broken loose, and with my mouth full of pear
I yelled "Tank!" and flew on deck with the whole watch below at
my heels. A sea had come in over the after-deck, and had lifted
the tank up from its lashings. All hands threw themselves upon
the tank, and held on to it till the water had poured off the
deck, when it was again fixed in its place. When this was done,
my watch went below again and lit their pipes as if nothing had
happened.</p>
<p>On November 13 we passed the northernmost of the Prince Edward
Islands, and on the 18th close to Penguin Island, the most
south-westerly of the Crozets. In the neighbourhood of the latter
we saw a great quantity of birds, a number of seals and penguins,
and even a little iceberg. I went close to the land to check the
chronometers, which an observation and bearings of the islands
showed to be correct.</p>
<p>Our course was then laid for Kerguelen Island, but we went too
far north to see it, as for two weeks the wind was south-easterly
and southerly, and the leeway we made when sailing close-hauled
took us every day a little to the north of east. When we were in
the same waters in 1910, there was gale after gale; then we did
not put in at Kerguelen on account of the force of the wind; this
time we could not approach the island because of the wind's
direction. In no respect can the second trip be compared with the
first; I should never have dreamed that there could be so much
difference in the "Roaring Forties" in two different years at the
same season. In the "Foggy Fifties" the weather was calm and
fine, and we had no fog until lat. 58&deg; S.</p>
<p>As regards the distance sailed, November, 1911, is the best
month the <i>Fram</i> has had.</p>
<p>In December, which began with a speed of one and a half knots,
calm, swell against us, and the engine at full speed, we had a
fair wind for three days, all the rest calms and head winds; the
first part of the month from the north-east and east, so that we
came much too far south; even in long. 150 E. we were in lat.
60&deg; S. In Christmas week we had calms and light winds from
the south-east, so that we managed to steal eastward to long.
170&deg; E. and lat. 65&deg; S., where, on the edge of the
pack-ice, we had a stiff breeze from the north-north-east, that
is, straight on to the ice.</p>
<p>Between Buenos Aires and the pack-ice we caught, as I have
said, a good many birds, mostly albatrosses, and about thirty
skins were prepared by L. Hansen. The largest albatross we got
measured twelve feet between the tips of its wings, and the
smallest bird was of a land species, not much bigger than a
humming-bird.</p>
<p>Talking of albatrosses, it is both amusing and interesting to
watch their elegant flight in a high wind. Without a movement of
the wings they sail, now with, now against, the wind; at one
instant they touch the surface of the water with the points of
their wings, at the next they go straight into the air like an
arrow. An interesting and instructive study for an aviator.</p>
<p>In a wind, when there is generally a number of them hovering
about the vessel, they will dash down after anything that is
thrown overboard; but of course it is useless to try to catch
them when the ship has so much way. This must be done the next
day, when the wind is lighter.</p>
<p>The birds are caught with an iron triangle, which ought to be
enclosed in wood, so that it will float on the water. At the
apex, which is very acute, the iron is filed as sharp as a knife,
and pork is hung on each of the sides. When this is thrown in the
wake of the ship, the bird settles on the water to feed. The
upper part of its beak is hooked like that of a bird of prey, and
as the albatross opens its beak and bites at the pork, you give a
jerk, so that the triangle catches the upper part of the beak by
two small notches, and the bird is left hanging. If the line
should break, the whole thing simply falls off and the bird is
unharmed. In hauling in, therefore, you have to be very careful
to hold the line quite tight, even if the bird flies towards you,
otherwise it will easily fall off: A bird may be pulled half-way
in several times, and will immediately take the bait again.</p>
<p>On the night of December 11 an unusually beautiful aurora was
seen; it lasted over an hour, and moved in a direction from west
to east.</p>
<p>On the 14th all the white paint was washed; the temperature
was 43&deg; F., and we were in shirt-sleeves.</p>
<p>For a whole week before Christmas the cook was busy baking
Christmas cakes. I am bound to say he is industrious; and the day
before Christmas Eve one of the <i>little</i> pigs, named Tulla,
was killed. The swineherd, A. Olsen, whose special favourite this
pig was, had to keep away during the operation, that we might not
witness his emotion.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of Christmas Eve we saw the three first
icebergs; there was an absolute calm all day, with misty air.</p>
<p>To keep Christmas the engine was stopped at 5 p.m., and then
all hands came to dinner. Unfortunately we had no gramophone to
sing to us, as in 1910; as a substitute the "orchestra" played
"Glade Jul, hellige Jul," when all were seated. The orchestra was
composed of Beck on the violin, Sundbeck on the mandolin, and the
undersigned on the flute. I puffed out my cheeks as much as I
could, and that is not saying a little, so that the others might
see how proficient I was. I hardly think it was much of a musical
treat; but the public was neither critical nor ceremonious, and
the prevalent costume was jerseys. The dinner consisted of soup,
roast pork, with fresh potatoes and whortleberries, ten-years-old
<i>aquavit</i> and Norwegian bock beer, followed by wine-jelly
and "kransekake," with&mdash;champagne. The toasts of their
Majesties the King and Queen, Don Pedro Christophersen, Captain
Amundsen, and the <i>Fram</i> were drunk.</p>
<p>I had decorated the saloon in a small way with artificial
flowers, embroideries, and flags, to give a little colour. Dinner
was followed by cigars and the distribution of Christmas
presents. L. Hansen played the accordion, and Lieutenant Gjertsen
and R&ouml;nne danced "folk dances"; the latter was, as usual, so
amusing that he kept us in fits of laughter.</p>
<p>At ten o'clock it was all over, the engine was started again,
one watch went to bed and the other on deck; Olsen cleaned out
the pigsty, as usual at this time of night. That finished
Christmas for this year.</p>
<p>As has been said before, Sir James Ross was down here in the
1840's. Two years in succession he sailed from the Pacific into
Ross Sea with two ships that had no auxiliary steam-power. I
assumed, therefore, that if he could get through so easily, there
must be some place between South Victoria Land and the Barrier
(or land) on the other side, where there was little or no ice.
Following this assumption, I intended to go down to the western
pack-ice (that lying off South Victoria Land) and steer along it
till we were in Ross Sea, or, at all events, until we found a
place where we could easily get through. It is quite possible
that Ross was very lucky in the time at which he encountered the
ice, and that he only sailed in clear weather. We had no time to
spare, however, but had to make use of whatever wind there was,
even if we could not see very far.</p>
<p>As early as December 28, at 5 p.m., in lat. 65&deg; S. and
long. 171.5&deg; E., it was reported that we were off the pack. I
was a good deal surprised, as recent expeditions had not met the
pack until 66.5&deg; S., or about one hundred nautical miles
farther south, nor had there been any sign of our being so near
the ice. The wind for the last few days had been south-easterly,
but for the moment it was calm; we therefore held on to the east
along the edge of the pack, with the ice to starboard. About
midnight the wind freshened from the north, and we lay
close-hauled along the edge of the ice till midday on the 29th,
when the direction of the ice became more southerly. The
northerly wind, which gradually increased to a stiff breeze, was
good enough for getting us on, but it must inevitably bring fog
and snow in its train. These came, sure enough, as thick as a
wall, and for a couple of days we sailed perfectly blindly.</p>
<p>Outside the pack-ice proper lie long streams of floes and
loose scattered lumps, which become more frequent as one nears
the pack. For two days we sailed simply by the lumps of ice; the
more of them we saw, the more easterly was our course, until they
began to decrease, when we steered more to the south. In this way
we went in forty-eight hours from lat. 65&deg; S. and long.
174&deg; E. to lat. 69&deg; S. and long. 178&deg; E., a distance
of about two hundred and fifty nautical miles, without entering
the pack. Once we very nearly went into the trap, but fortunately
got out again. The wind was so fresh that we did as much as eight
and a half knots; when sailing at such a rate through a loose
stream of ice, we sometimes ran upon a floe, which went under the
ship's bottom, and came up alongside the other way up.</p>
<p>During the afternoon of the 31st the streams of ice became
closer and closer, and then I made the mistake of continuing to
sail to the eastward; instead of this, I ought to have stood off,
and steered due south or to the west of south, with this ice on
our <i>port</i> side. The farther we advanced, the more certain I
was that we had come into the eastern pack-ice. It must be
remembered, however, that owing to fog and thick snow we had seen
nothing for over two days. Observations there were none, of
course; our speed had varied between two and eight and a half
knots, and we had steered all manner of courses. That our dead
reckoning was not very correct in such circumstances goes without
saying, and an observation on January 2 showed us that we were
somewhat farther to the east than we had reckoned. On the evening
of December 31 the fog lifted for a while, and we saw nothing but
ice all round. Our course was then set due south. We had come
right down in lat. 69.5&deg; S., and I hoped soon to be clear
altogether; in 1910 we got out of the ice in 70&deg;S., and were
then in the same longitude as now.</p>
<p>Now, indeed, our progress began to be slow, and the old year
went out in a far from pleasant fashion. The fog was so thick
that I may safely say we did not see more than fifty yards from
the ship, whereas we ought to have had the midnight sun; ice and
snow-sludge were so thick that at times we lay still. The wind
had, unfortunately, fallen off, but we still had a little breeze
from the north, so that both sails and engine could be used. We
went simply at haphazard; now and then we were lucky enough to
come into great open channels and even lakes, but then the ice
closed again absolutely tight. It could hardly be called real
ice, however, but was rather a snow-sludge, about two feet thick,
and as tough as dough; it looked as if it had all just been
broken off a single thick mass. The floes lay close together, and
we could see how one floe fitted into the other. The ice remained
more or less close until we were right down in lat. 73&deg;S. and
long. 179&deg; W.; the last part of it was old drift-ice.</p>
<p>From here to the Bay of Whales we saw a few scattered streams
of floes and some icebergs.</p>
<p>A few seals were shot in the ice, so that we had fresh meat
enough, and could save the sheep and pigs until the shore party
came on board. I was sure they would appreciate fresh roast
pork.</p>
<p>The chart of Ross Sea has been drawn chiefly as a guide to
future expeditions. It may be taken as certain that the best
place to go through the ice is between long. 176&deg; E. and
180&deg;, and that the best time is about the beginning of
February.</p>
<p>Take, for instance, our southward route in 1911-1912: as has
been said, the ice was met with as early as in 65&deg; S., and we
were not clear of it till about 73&deg; S.; between 68&deg; S.
and 69&deg; S. the line is interrupted, and it was there that I
ought to have steered to the south.</p>
<p>Now follow the course from the Bay of Whales in 1912. Only in
about 75&deg; S. was ice seen (almost as in 1911), and we
followed it. After that time we saw absolutely no more ice, as
the chart shows; therefore in the course of about a month and a
half all the ice that we met when going south had drifted
out.</p>
<p>The stippled line shows how I <i>assume</i> the ice to have
lain; the heavy broken line shows what our course ought to have
been.</p>
<p>The midnight sun was not seen till the night of January 7,
1912, to the south of lat. 77&deg; S.; it was already 9.5&deg;
above the horizon.</p>

<small>CHART OF THE ROSS SEA.</small></p>
<br>
<p>On the night of January 8 we arrived off the Barrier in
extremely bitter weather. South-westerly and southerly winds had
held for a few days, with fair weather; but that night there was
thick snow, and the wind gradually fell calm, after which a fresh
breeze sprang up from the south-east, with biting snow, and at
the same time a lot of drift-ice. The engine went very slowly,
and the ship kept head to wind. About midnight the weather
cleared a little, and a dark line, which proved to be the
Barrier, came in sight. The engine went ahead at full speed, and
the sails were set, so that we might get under the lee of the
perpendicular wall. By degrees the ice-blink above the Barrier
became lighter and lighter, and before very long we were so close
under it that we only just had room to go about. The Barrier here
runs east and west, and with a south-easterly wind we went along
it to the east. The watch that had gone below at eight o'clock,
when we were still in open sea, came up again at two to find us
close to the long-desired wall of ice.</p>
<p>Some hours passed in the same way, but then, of course, the
wind became easterly&mdash;dead ahead&mdash;so that we had tack
after tack till 6 p.m. the same day, when we were at the western
point of the Bay of Whales.</p>
<p>The ice lay right out to West Cape, and we sailed across the
mouth of the bay and up under the lee of the eastern Barrier, in
order, if possible, to find slack ice or open water; but no, the
fast ice came just as far on that side. It turned out that we
could not get farther south than 78&deg;30'&mdash;that is, eleven
nautical miles farther north than the previous year, and no less
than fifteen nautical miles from Framheim, taking into
consideration the turn in the bay.</p>
<p>We were thus back at the same place we had left on February
14, 1911, and had since been round the world. The distance
covered on this voyage of circumnavigation was 25,000 nautical
miles, of which 8,000 belong to the oceanographical cruise in the
South Atlantic.</p>
<p>We did not lie under the lee of the eastern Barrier for more
than four hours; the wind, which had so often been against us,
was true to its principles to the last. Of course it went to the
north and blew right up the bay; the drift-ice from Ross Sea came
in, and at midnight (January 9&mdash;10) we stood out again.</p>
<p>I had thought of sending a man up to Framheim to report that
we had arrived, but the state of the weather did not allow it.
Besides, I had only one pair of private ski on board and should
therefore only have been able to send one man. It would have been
better if several had gone together.</p>
<p>During the forenoon of the l0th it gradually cleared, the wind
fell light and we stood inshore again. As at the same time the
barometer was rising steadily, Lieutenant Gjertsen went ashore on
ski about one o'clock.</p>
<p>Later in the afternoon a dog came running out across the
sea-ice, and I thought it had come down on Lieutenant Gjertsen's
track; but I was afterwards told it was one of the half-wild dogs
that ran about on the ice and did not show themselves up at the
hut.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the wind freshened again; we had to put out for
another twenty-four hours and lay first one way and then the
other with shortened sail; then there was fine weather again and
we came in. At 4 p.m. on the 11th Lieutenant Gjertsen returned
with Lieutenant Prestrud, Johansen and Stubberud. Of course we
were very glad to see one another again and all sorts of
questions were asked on both sides. The Chief and the southern
party were not yet back. They stayed on board till the 12th, got
their letters and a big pile of newspapers and went ashore again;
we followed them with the glasses as far as possible, so as to
take them on board again if they could not get across the cracks
in the ice.</p>
<p>During the days that followed we lay moored to the ice or went
out, according to the weather.</p>
<p>At 7 p.m. on the 16th we were somewhat surprised to see a
vessel bearing down. For my part, I guessed her to be the
<i>Aurora</i>, Dr. Mawson's ship. She came very slowly, but at
last what should we see but the Japanese flag! I had no idea that
expedition was out again. The ship came right in, went past us
twice and moored alongside the loose ice. Immediately afterwards
ten men armed with picks and shovels went up the Barrier, while
the rest rushed wildly about after penguins, and their shots were
heard all night. Next morning the commander of the <i>Kainan
Maru</i>, whose name was Homura, came on board. The same day a
tent was set up on the edge of the Barrier, and cases, sledges,
and so on, were put out on the ice. <i>Kainan Maru</i> means, I
have been told, "the ship that opens the South."</p>
<p>Prestrud and I went on board her later in the day, to see what
she was like, but we met neither the leader of the expedition nor
the captain of the ship. Prestrud had the cinematograph apparatus
with him, and a lot of photographs were also taken.</p>
<p>The leader of the Japanese expedition has written somewhere or
other that the reason of Shackleton's losing all his ponies was
that the ponies were not kept in tents at night, but had to lie
outside. He thought the ponies ought to be in the tents and the
men outside. From this one would think they were great lovers of
animals, but I must confess that was not the impression I
received. They had put penguins into little boxes to take them
alive to Japan! Round about the deck lay dead and half-dead skua
gulls in heaps. On the ice close to the vessel was a seal ripped
open, with part of its entrails on the ice; but the seal was
still alive. Neither Prestrud nor I had any sort of weapon that
we could kill the seal with, so we asked the Japanese to do it,
but they only grinned and laughed. A little way off two of them
were coming across the ice with a seal in front of them; they
drove it on with two long poles, with which they pricked it when
it would not go. If it fell into a crack, they dug it up again as
you would see men quarrying stone at home; it had not enough life
in it to be able to escape its tormentors. All this was
accompanied by laughter and jokes. On arrival at the ship the
animal was nearly dead, and it was left there till it
expired.</p>
<p>On the 19th we had a fresh south-westerly wind and a lot of
ice went out. The Japanese were occupied most of the night in
going round among the floes and picking up men, dogs, cases, and
so on, as they had put a good deal on to the ice in the course of
the day. As the ice came out, so the <i>Fram</i> went in, right
up to fat. 78&deg;35' S., while the <i>Kainan Maru</i> drifted
farther and farther out, till at last she disappeared. Nor did we
see the vessel again, but a couple of men with a tent stayed on
the Barrier as long as we were in the bay.</p>
<p>On the night of the 24th there was a stiff breeze from the
west, and we drifted so far out in the thick snow that it was
only on the afternoon of the 27th that we could make our way in
again through a mass of ice. In the course of these two days so
much ice had broken up that we came right in to fat. 78&deg;39'
S., or almost to Framheim, and that was very lucky. As we stood
in over the Bay of Whales, we caught sight of a big Norwegian
naval ensign flying on the Barrier at Cape Man's Head, and I then
knew that the southern party had arrived. We went therefore as
far south as possible and blew our powerful siren; nor was it
very long before eight men came tearing down. There was great
enthusiasm. The first man on board was the Chief; I was so
certain he had reached the goal that I never asked him. Not till
an hour later, when we had discussed all kinds of other things,
did I enquire "Well, of course you have been at the South
Pole?"</p>
<p>We lay there for a couple of days; on account of the short
distance from Framheim, provisions, outfit, etc., were brought on
board. If such great masses of ice had not drifted out in the
last few days, it would probably have taken us a week or two to
get the same quantity on board.</p>
<p>At 9.30 p.m. on January 30, 1912, in a thick fog, we took our
moorings on board and waved a last farewell to the mighty
Barrier.</p>

<h3>VII.<br>
<br>
<small>FROM THE BARRIER TO BUENOS AIRES, VIA HOBART.</small></h3>
<p>The first day after our departure from the Barrier everything
we had taken on board was stowed away, so that one would not have
thought our numbers were doubled, or that we had taken several
hundred cases and a lot of outfit on board. The change was only
noticed on deck, where thirty-nine powerful dogs made an uproar
all day long, and in the fore-saloon, which was entirely changed.
This saloon, after being deserted for a year, was now full of
men, and it was a pleasure to be there; especially as everyone
had something to tell&mdash;the Chief of his trip, Prestrud of
his, and Gjertsen and I of the <i>Fram</i>'s.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Image108" id="Image108"></a><img alt=
"" src="e00111b-images/Image108.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>CHART OF THE BAY OF WHALES.</small></p>
<br>
<p>However, there was not very much time for yarning. The Chief
at once began writing cablegrams and lectures, which Prestrud and
I translated into English, and the Chief then copied again on a
typewriter. In addition to this I was occupied the whole time in
drawing charts, so that on arrival at Hobart everything was
ready; the time passed quickly, though the voyage was fearfully
long.</p>
<p>As regards the pack-ice we were extremely lucky. It lay in
exactly the same spot where we had met with it in 1911&mdash;that
is, in about lat. 75&deg; S. We went along the edge of it for a
very short time, and then it was done with. To the north of
75&deg; we saw nothing but a few small icebergs.</p>
<p>We made terribly slow progress to the northward, how slow may
perhaps be understood if I quote my diary for February 27:</p>
<p>"This trip is slower than anything we have had before; now and
then we manage an average rate of two knots an hour in a day's
run. In the last four days we have covered a distance that before
would have been too little for a single day. We have been at it
now for nearly a month, and are still only between lat. 52&deg;
and 53&deg; S. Gales from the north are almost the order of the
day," etc. However, it is an ill wind that blows nobody any good,
and the time was well employed with all we had to do.</p>
<p>After a five weeks' struggle we at last reached Hobart and
anchored in the splendid harbour on March 7.</p>
<p>Our fresh provisions from Buenos Aires just lasted out; the
last of the fresh potatoes were finished a couple of days before
our arrival, and the last pig was killed when we had been at
Hobart two days.</p>
<p>The <i>Fram</i> remained here for thirteen days, which were
chiefly spent in repairing the propeller and cleaning the engine;
in addition to this the topsail-yard, which was nearly broken in
the middle, was spliced, as we had no opportunity of getting a
new one.</p>
<p>The first week was quiet on board, as, owing to the
circumstances, there was no communication with the shore; but
after that the ship was full of visitors, so that we were not
very sorry to get away again.</p>
<p>Twenty-one of our dogs were presented to Dr. Mawson, the
leader of the Australian expedition, and only those dogs that had
been to the South Pole and a few puppies, eighteen in all, were
left on board.</p>
<p>While we lay in Hobart, Dr. Mawson's ship, the <i>Aurora</i>,
came in. I went aboard her one day, and have thus been on board
the vessels of all the present Antarctic expeditions. On the
<i>Terra Nova</i>, the British, on February 4, 1911, in the Bay
of Whales; on the <i>Deutschland</i>, the German, in September
and October, 1911, in Buenos Aires; on the <i>Kainan Maru</i>,
the Japanese, on January 17, 1912, in the Bay of Whales; and
finally on the <i>Aurora</i> in Hobart. Not forgetting the
<i>Fram</i>, which, of course, I think best of all.</p>
<p>On March 20 the <i>Fram</i> weighed anchor and left
Tasmania.</p>
<p>We made very poor progress to begin with, as we had calms for
nearly three weeks, in spite of its being the month of March in
the west wind belt of the South Pacific. On the morning of Easter
Sunday, April 7, the wind first freshened from the north-west and
blew day after day, a stiff breeze and a gale alternately, so
that we went splendidly all the way to the Falkland Islands, in
spite of the fact that the topsail was reefed for nearly five
weeks on account of the fragile state of the yard. I believe most
of us wanted to get on fast; the trip was now over for the
present, and those who had families at home naturally wanted to
be with them as soon as they could; perhaps that was why we went
so well.</p>
<p>On April 1 Mrs. Snuppesen gave birth to eight pups; four of
these were killed, while the rest, two of each sex, were allowed
to live.</p>
<p>On Maundy Thursday, April 4, we were in long. 180&deg; and
changed the date, so that we had two Maundy Thursdays in one
week; this gave us a good many holidays running, and I cannot say
the effect is altogether cheerful; it was a good thing when
Easter Tuesday came round as an ordinary week-day.</p>
<p>On May 6 we passed Cape Horn in very fair weather; it is true
we, had a snow-squall of hurricane violence, but it did not last
much more than half an hour. For a few days the temperature was a
little below freezing-point, but it rose rapidly as soon as we
were out in the Atlantic.</p>
<p>From Hobart to Cape Horn we saw no ice.</p>
<p>After passing the Falkland Islands we had a head wind, so that
the last part of the trip was nothing to boast of.</p>
<p>On the night of May 21 we passed Montevideo, where the Chief
had arrived a few hours before. From here up the River La Plata
we went so slowly on account of head wind that we did not anchor
in the roads of Buenos Aires till the afternoon of the 23rd,
almost exactly at the same time as the Chief landed at Buenos
Aires. When I went ashore next morning and met Mr. P.
Christophersen, he was in great good-humour. "This is just like a
fairy tale," he said; and it could not be denied that it was an
amusing coincidence. The Chief, of course, was equally
pleased.</p>
<p>On the 25th, the Argentine National F&ecirc;te, the
<i>Fram</i> was moored at the same quay that we had left on
October 5, 1911. At our departure there were exactly seven people
on board to say good-bye, but, as far as I could see, there were
more than this when we arrived; and I was able to make out, from
newspapers and other sources, that in the course of a couple of
months the third <i>Fram</i> Expedition had grown considerably in
popularity.</p>
<p>In conclusion I will give one or two data. Since the
<i>Fram</i> left Christiania on June 7, 1910, we have been two
and a half times round the globe; the distance covered is about
54,400 nautical miles; the lowest reading of the barometer during
this time was 27.56 inches (700 millimetres) in March, 1911, in
the South Pacific, and the highest 30.82 inches (783 millimetres)
in October, 1911, in the South Atlantic.</p>
<p>On June 7, 1912, the second anniversary of our leaving
Christiania, all the members of the Expedition, except the Chief
and myself, left for Norway, and the first half of the Expedition
was thus brought to a fortunate conclusion.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX I<br>
<br>
<small>THE "FRAM"<br>
<br>
<small>BY COMMODORE CHRISTIAN BLOM</small></small></h3>
<p><small>COLIN ARCHER</small> says in his description of the
<i>Fram</i>, in Fridtjof Nansen's account of the Norwegian Arctic
Expedition, 1893&mdash;1896, that the successful result of an
expedition such as that planned and carried out by Dr. Nansen in
the years 1893&mdash;1896 must depend on the care with which all
possible contingencies are foreseen, and precautions taken to
meet them, and the choice of every detail of the equipment with
special regard to the use to which it will be put. To no part of
the equipment, he says, could this apply with greater force than
to the ship which was to carry Dr. Nansen and his companions on
their adventurous voyage.</p>
<p>Colin Archer then built the ship&mdash;<i>Fram</i> was her
name&mdash;and she showed&mdash;first on Fridtjof Nansen's famous
voyage, and afterwards on Sverdrup's long wintering expedition in
Ellesmere Land, that she answered her purpose completely, nay,
she greatly exceeded the boldest expectations.</p>
<p>Then Roald Amundsen decided to set out on a voyage not less
adventurous than the two former, and he looked about for a
suitable ship. It was natural that he should think of the
<i>Fram</i>, but she was old&mdash;about sixteen years&mdash;and
had been exposed to many a hard buffet; it was said that she was
a good deal damaged by decay.</p>
<p>Roald Amundsen, however, did not allow himself to be
discouraged by these misgivings, but wished to see for himself
what kind of a craft the <i>Fram</i> was after her two
commissions. He therefore came down to Horten with Colin Archer
on June 1, 1908, and made a thorough examination of the vessel.
He then, in the spring of 1909, requested the Naval Dockyard at
Horten to repair the ship and carry out the alterations he
considered necessary for his enterprise.</p>
<p>Before giving an account of the repairs and alterations to the
vessel in 1909&mdash;1910, we shall briefly recapitulate, with
the author's permission, a part of the description of the
<i>Fram</i> in Fridtjof Nansen's work, especially as regards the
constructive peculiarities of the vessel.</p>
<p>The problem which it was sought to solve in the construction
of the <i>Fram</i> was that of providing a ship which could
survive the crushing embrace of the Arctic drift-ice. To fit her
for this was the object before which all other considerations had
to give way.</p>
<p>But apart from the question of mere strength of construction,
there were problems of design and model which, it was thought,
would play an important part in the attainment of the chief
object. It is sometimes prudent in an encounter to avoid the full
force of a blow instead of resisting it, even if it could be met
without damage; and there was reason to think that by a judicious
choice of model something might be done to break the force of the
ice-pressure, and thus lessen its danger. Examples of this had
been seen in small Norwegian vessels that had been caught in the
ice near Spitzbergen and Novaya Zemlya. It often happens that
they are lifted right out of the water by the pressure of the ice
without sustaining serious damage; and these vessels are not
particularly strong, but have, like most small sailing-ships, a
considerable dead rising and sloping sides. The ice encounters
these sloping sides and presses in under the bilge on both sides,
until the ice-edges meet under the keel, and the ship is raised
up into the bed that is formed by the ice itself.</p>
<p>In order to turn this principle to account, it was decided to
depart entirely from the usual flat-bottomed frame-section, and
to adopt a form that would offer no vulnerable point on the
ship's side, but would cause the increasing horizontal pressure
of the ice to effect a raising of the ship, as described above.
In the construction of the <i>Fram</i> it was sought to solve
this problem by avoiding plane or concave surfaces, thus giving
the vessel as far as possible round and full lines. Besides
increasing the power of resistance to external pressure, this
form has the advantage of making it easy for the ice to glide
along the bottom in any direction.</p>
<p>The <i>Fram</i> was a three-masted fore-and-aft schooner with
an auxiliary engine of 200 indicated horse-power, which was
calculated to give her a speed of 6 knots, when moderately
loaded, with a coal consumption of 2.8 tons a day.</p>
<p>The vessel was designed to be only large enough to carry the
necessary coal-supply, provisions, and other equipment for a
period of five years, and to give room for the crew.</p>
<p>Her principal dimensions are:</p>

<br>
<p>Her displacement, with a draught of 15.6 feet, is 800 tons.
The measurements are taken to the outside of the planks, but do
not include the ice-skin. By Custom-house measurement she was
found to be 402 gross tons register, and 307 tons net.</p>
<p>The ship, with engines and boilers, was calculated to weigh
about 420 tons. With the draught above mentioned, which gives a
freeboard of 3 feet, there would thus be 380 tons available for
cargo. This weight was actually exceeded by 100 tons, which left
a freeboard of only 20 inches when the ship sailed on her first
voyage. This additional immersion could only have awkward effects
when the ship came into the ice, as its effect would then be to
retard the lifting by the ice, on which the safety of the ship
was believed to depend in a great measure. Not only was there a
greater weight to lift, but there was a considerably greater
danger of the walls of ice, that would pile themselves against
the ship's sides, falling over the bulwarks and covering the deck
before the ice began to raise her. The load would, however, be
lightened by the time the ship was frozen fast. Events showed
that she was readily lifted when the ice-pressure set in, and
that the danger of injury from falling blocks of ice was less
than had been expected. The <i>Fram</i>'s keel is of American elm
in two lengths, 14 inches square; the room and space is 2 feet.
The frame-timbers are almost all of oak obtained from the Naval
Dockyard at Horten, where they had lain for many years, thus
being perfectly seasoned. The timbers were all grown to shape.
The frames consist of two tiers of timbers everywhere, each
timber measuring 10 to 11 inches fore and aft; the two tiers of
timbers are fitted together and bolted, so that they form a solid
and compact whole. The joints of the frame-timbers are covered
with iron plates. The lining consists of pitch-pine in good
lengths and of varying thickness from 4 to 6 inches. The keelson
is also of pitch-pine, in two layers, one above the other; each
layer 15 inches square from the stem to the engine-room. Under
the boiler and engine there was only room for one keelson. There
are two decks. The beams of the main-deck are of American or
German oak, those of the lower deck and half-deck of pitch-pine
and Norwegian fir. All the deck planks are of Norwegian fir, 4
inches in the main-deck and 3 inches elsewhere. The beams are
fastened to the ship's sides by knees of Norwegian spruce, of
which about 450 were used. Wooden knees were, as a rule,
preferred to iron ones, as they are more elastic. A good many
iron knees were used, however, where wood was less suitable. In
the boiler and engine room the beams of the lower deck had to be
raised about 3 feet to give sufficient height for the engines.
The upper deck was similarly raised from the stern-post to the
mainmast, forming a half-deck, under which the cabins were
placed. On this half-deck, immediately forward of the funnel, a
deck-house was placed, arranged as a chart-house, from which two
companions (one on each side) led down to the cabins. Besides the
ice-skin, there is a double layer of outside planking of oak. The
two first strakes (garboard strakes), however, are single, 7
inches thick, and are bolted both to the keel and to the
frame-timbers. The first (inner) layer of planks is 8 inches
thick, and is only fastened with nails; outside this comes a
layer of 4-inch planks, fastened with oak trenails and through
bolts, as usual. The two top strakes are single again, and 6
inches thick. The ice-skin is of greenheart, and covers the whole
ship's side from the keel to 18 inches from the sheer strake. It
is only fastened with nails and jagged bolts. Each layer of
planks was caulked and pitched before the next one was laid. Thus
only about 3 or 4 inches of the keel projects below the planking,
and this part of the keel is rounded off so as not to hinder the
ice from passing under the ship's bottom. The intervals between
the timbers were filled with a mixture of coal-tar, pitch, and
sawdust, heated together and put in warm. The ship's side thus
forms a compact mass varying in thickness from 28 to 32 inches.
As a consequence of all the intervals between the timbers being
filled up, there is no room for bilge-water under the lining. A
loose bottom was therefore laid a few inches above the lining on
each side of the keelson. In order to strengthen the ship's sides
still more, and especially to prevent stretching, iron braces
were placed on the lining, running from the clamps of the top
deck down to well past the floor-timbers.</p>
<p>The stem consists of three massive oak beams, one inside the
other, forming together 4 feet of solid oak fore and aft, with a
breadth of 15 inches. The three external plankings as well as the
lining are all rabbeted into the stem. The propeller-post is in
two thicknesses, placed side by side, and measures 26 inches
athwart-ship and 14 inches fore and aft. It will be seen from the
plan that the overhang aft runs out into a point, and that there
is thus no transom. To each side of the stern-post is fitted a
stout stern-timber parallel to the longitudinal midship section,
forming, so to speak, a double stern-post, and the space between
them forms a well, which goes right up through the top deck. The
rudder-post is placed in the middle of this well, and divides it
into two parts, one for the propeller and one for the rudder. In
this way it is possible to lift both the rudder and the screw out
of the water. The rudder is so hung that the rudder-stock, which
is cylindrical, turns on its own axis, to prevent the rudder
being jammed if the well should be filled with ice. Aft of the
rudder-well the space between the stern-timbers is filled with
solid wood, and the whole is securely bolted together with bolts
running athwart-ship. The frame-timbers join the stern-timbers in
this part, and are fastened to them by means of knees. The stem
and stern-post are connected to the keelson and to the keel by
stout knees of timber, and both the ship's sides are bound
together with solid breasthooks and crutches of wood or iron.</p>
<p>Although the <i>Fram</i> was not specially built for ramming,
it was probable that now and then she would be obliged to force
her way through the ice. Her bow and stern were therefore shod in
the usual way. On the forward side of the stem a segment-shaped
iron was bolted from the bobstay-bolt to some way under the keel.
Outside this iron plates (3 x &frac34; inches) were fastened over
the stem, and for 6 feet on each side of it. These iron plates
were placed close together, and thus formed a continuous
armour-plating to a couple of feet from the keel. The sharp edge
of the stern was protected in the same way, and the lower sides
of the well were lined with thick iron plates. The rudder-post,
which owing to its exposed position may be said to form the
Achilles' heel of the ship, was strengthened with three heavy
pieces of iron, one in the opening for the screw and one on each
side of the two posts and the keel, and bolted together with
bolts running athwart-ship.</p>
<p>Extraordinary precautions were taken for strengthening the
ship's sides, which were particularly exposed to destruction by
ice-pressure, and which, on account of their form, compose the
weakest part of the hull. These precautions will best be seen in
the sections (Figs. 3 and 4). Under each beam in both decks were
placed diagonal stays of fir (6 x 10 inches), almost at right
angles to the ship's sides, and securely fastened to the sides
and to the beams by wooden knees. There are 68 of these stays
distributed over the ship. In addition, there are under the beams
three rows of vertical stanchions between decks, and one row in
the lower hold from the keelson. These are connected to the
keelson, to the beams, and to each other by iron bands. The whole
of the ship's interior is thus filled with a network of braces
and stays, arranged in such a way as to transfer and distribute
the pressure from without, and give rigidity to the whole
construction. In the engine and boiler room it was necessary to
modify the arrangement of stays, so as to give room for the
engines and boiler. All the iron, with the exception of the
heaviest forgings, is galvanized.</p>
<p>When Otto Sverdrup was to use the <i>Fram</i> for his Polar
expedition, he had a number of alterations carried out. The most
important of these consisted in laying a new deck in the fore
part of the ship, from the bulkhead forward of the engine-room to
the stem, at a height of 7 feet 4 inches (to the upper side of
the planks) above the old fore-deck. The space below the new deck
was fitted as a fore-cabin, with a number of state-rooms leading
out of it, a large workroom, etc. The old chart-house immediately
forward of the funnel was removed, and in its place a large
water-tank was fitted. The foremast was raised and stepped in the
lower deck. A false keel, 10 inches deep and 12 inches broad, was
placed below the keel. A number of minor alterations were also
carried out.</p>
<p>After the <i>Fram</i> returned in 1902 from her second
expedition under Captain Sverdrup, she was sent down to Horten to
be laid up in the Naval Dockyard.</p>
<p>Not long after the vessel had arrived at the dockyard, Captain
Sverdrup proposed various repairs and alterations. The repairs
were carried out in part, but the alterations were postponed
pending a decision as to the future employment of the vessel.</p>
<p>The <i>Fram</i> then lay idle in the naval harbour until 1905,
when she was used by the marine artillery as a floating magazine.
In the same year a good deal of the vessel's outfit (amongst
other things all her sails and most of her rigging) was lost in a
fire in one of the naval storehouses, where these things were
stored.</p>
<p>In 1903 the ship's keel and stem (which are of elm and oak)
were sheathed with zinc, while the outer sheathing (ice-skin),
which is of greenheart, was kept coated with coal-tar and copper
composition. In 1907 the whole outer sheathing below the
water-line was covered with zinc; this was removed in 1910 when
the ship was prepared for her third commission under Roald
Amundsen.</p>
<p>In 1907 a thorough examination of the vessel was made, as it
was suspected that the timber inside the thick cork insulation
that surrounded the cabins had begun to decay.</p>
<p>On previous expeditions the cabins, provision hold aft, and
workrooms forward of the fore-cabin, had been insulated with
several thicknesses of wooden panelling. The interstices were
filled with finely-divided cork, alternately with reindeer hair
and thick felt and linoleum. In the course of years damp had
penetrated into the non-conducting material, with the result that
fungus and decay had spread in the surrounding woodwork. Thus it
was seen during the examination in 1907 that the panelling and
ceiling of the cabins in question were to a great extent rotten
or attacked by fungus. In the same way the under side of the
upper deck over these cabins was partly attacked by fungus, as
were its beams, knees, and carlings. The lower deck, on the other
hand, was better preserved. The filling-in timbers of spruce or
fir between the frame-timbers in the cabins were damaged by
fungus, while the frame-timbers themselves, which were of oak,
were good. The outer lining outside the insulated parts was also
somewhat damaged by fungus.</p>
<p>In the coal-bunkers over the main-deck the spruce knees were
partly rotten, as were some of the beams, while the lining was
here fairly good.</p>
<p>The masts and main-topmast were somewhat attacked by decay,
while the rest of the spars were good.</p>
<p>During and after the examination all the panelling and
insulation was removed, the parts attacked by fungus or decay
were also removed, and the woodwork coated with carbolineum or
tar. The masts and various stores and fittings were taken ashore
at the same time.</p>
<p>It was found that the rest of the vessel&mdash;that is, the
whole of the lower part of the hull right up to the cabin
deck&mdash;was perfectly sound, and as good as new. Nor was there
any sign of strain anywhere. It is difficult to imagine any
better proof of the excellence of the vessel's construction;
after two protracted expeditions to the most northern regions to
which any ship has ever penetrated, where the vessel was often
exposed to the severest ice-pressure, and in spite of her being
(in 1907) fifteen years old, the examination showed that her
actual hull, the part of the ship that has to resist the heavy
strain of water and ice, was in just as good condition as when
she was new.</p>
<p>The vessel was then left in this state until, as already
mentioned, Roald Amundsen and her builder, Colin Archer, came
down to the dockyard on June 1, 1908, and with the necessary
assistance made an examination of her.</p>
<p>After some correspondence and verbal conferences between Roald
Amundsen and the dockyard, the latter, on March 9, 1909, made a
tender for the repairs and alterations to the <i>Fram</i>. The
repairs consisted of making good the damage to the topsides
referred to above.</p>
<p>The alterations were due in the first instance to the
circumstance that the steam-engine and boiler (the latter had had
its flues burnt out on Sverdrup's expedition) were to be replaced
by an oil-motor; as a consequence of this the coal-bunkers would
disappear, while, on the other hand, a large number of oil-tanks,
capable of containing about 90 tons of oil, were to be put in. It
was also considered desirable to rig square-sails on the foremast
in view of the great distances that were to be sailed on the
proposed expedition.</p>
<p>The present arrangement of the vessel will best be followed by
referring to the elevation and plan (Figs. 1 and 2).</p>
<p>In the extreme after-part of the lower hold is placed the 180
horse-power Diesel engine, surrounded by its auxiliary machinery
and air-reservoirs.</p>
<p>In addition, some of the tanks containing the fuel itself are
placed in the engine-room (marked O); the other tanks shown in
the engine-room (marked 9) serve for storing lubricating oil. The
existing engine-room was formerly the engine and boiler room,
with coal-bunkers on both sides in the forward part. Forward of
the watertight bulkhead of the engine-room we have, in the lower
hold, the main store of oil-fuel, contained in tanks (marked O)
of various sizes, on account of their having to be placed among
the numerous diagonal stays. The tanks are filled and emptied by
means of a pump and a petroleum hose through a manhole in the
top, over which, again, are hatches in the deck above; no
connecting pipes are fitted between the different tanks, for fear
they might be damaged by frost or shock, thus involving a risk of
losing oil. The main supply tank for fuel is placed over the
forward side of the engine-room, where it is supported on strong
steel girders; inside this tank, again, there are two smaller
ones&mdash;settling tanks&mdash;from which the oil is conveyed in
pipes to the engine-pumps. The main tank is of irregular
shape&mdash;as will be seen from the drawing&mdash;since a square
piece is taken out of its starboard after-corner for a way down
into the engine-room. Besides this way down, an emergency way
leads up from the engine-room, right aft, to one of the
after-cabins. The oil hold is closed forward by a watertight
bulkhead, which goes up to the main-deck. The hold forward of the
oil-supply is unaltered, and serves for stowing cargo (mainly
provisions), as does the hold above the oil-supply and below the
main-deck.</p>
<p>On the main-deck right aft we now find a space arranged on
each side of the well for the propeller and rudder; the lower
part of this space is occupied by two tanks for lamp-oil, and
above the tanks is a thin partition, which forms the floor of two
small sail-rooms, with hatches to the deck above. Around the
mizzenmast is the after-saloon, with eight cabins leading out of
it. From the forward end of the after-saloon two passages lead to
the large workroom amidships. These passages run past what were
formerly coal-bunkers, but are now arranged as cabins, intended
only to be used in milder climates, as they are not provided with
any special insulation. From the port passage a door leads to the
engine-room companion. In the after-part of the large workroom is
the galley. This room is entirely lined with zinc, both on walls
and ceiling (on account of the danger of fire), while the deck is
covered with lead, on which tiles are laid in cement. Forward of
the galley is the main hatch, and two large water-tanks are
fitted here, one on each side. The remainder of the workroom
affords space for carpenter's benches, turning-lathes, a forge,
vices, etc. From the workroom two doors lead into the fore-saloon
with its adjoining cabins. Amundsen's cabin is the farthest
forward on the starboard side, and communicates with an
instrument-room. From the fore-saloon a door leads out forward,
past a sixth cabin.</p>
<p>In the space forward on the main-deck we have the fore-hatch,
and by the side of this a room entirely lined with zinc plates,
which serves for storing furs. Forward of the fur store is fitted
a 15 horse-power one-cylinder Bolinder motor for working the
capstan; the main features of its working will be seen in the
drawing. There are two independent transmissions: by belt and by
chain. The former is usually employed. The chain transmission was
provided as a reserve, since it was feared that belt-driving
might prove unserviceable in a cold climate. This fear, however,
has hitherto been ungrounded.</p>
<p>Forward of the motor there is a large iron tank to supply
water for cooling it. In the same space are chain-pipes to the
locker below and the heel of the bowsprit. This space also serves
as cable-tier.</p>
<p>On the upper deck we find aft, the opening of the rudder-well
and that of the propeller-well, covered with gratings. A piece
was added to the lower part of the rudder to give more rudder
area.</p>
<p>Forward of the propeller-well comes the reserve steering-gear,
almost in the same position formerly occupied by the only
steering-gear; the ordinary steering-gear is now moved to the
bridge. The old engine-room companion aft is now removed, and
forward of the after-wheel is only the skylight of the
after-saloon. Up through the latter comes the exhaust-pipe of the
main engine. Forward of and round the mizzenmast is the bridge,
which is partly formed by the roofs of the large chart-house and
laboratory amidships and the two houses on each side. The
chart-house occupies the place of the old boiler-room ventilator,
and abuts on the fore-deck. (It is thus a little aft of the place
occupied by the chart-house on Nansen's expedition.) It is
strongly built of timbers standing upright, securely bolted to
the deck. On both sides of this timber work there are panels, 2
inches thick on the outside and 1 inch on the inside, and the
space between is filled with finely-divided cork. Floor and roof
are insulated in a similar way, as is also the door; the windows
are double, of thick plate-glass. Inside the chart-house, besides
the usual fittings for its use as such, there is a companion-way
to the engine-room, and a hatch over the manhole to the main
supply tank for oil-fuel. The opening in the deck has a hatch,
made like the rest of the deck (in two thicknesses, with cork
insulation between); the intention is to cut off the engine-room
altogether, and remove the entrance of this companion during the
drift in the ice through the Polar sea. The side houses are
constructed of iron, and are not panelled; they are intended for
w.c. and lamp-room. On the roof of the chart-house are the main
steering-gear and the engine-room telegraph. On the port side, on
the forward part of the after-deck, a Downton pump is fitted,
which can either be worked by hand or by a small motor, which
also serves to drive the sounding-machine, and is set up on the
after-deck. Forward of the starboard side house is the spare
rudder, securely lashed to deck and bulwarks. On each side of the
chart-house a bridge leads to the fore-deck, with ways down to
the workroom and fore-saloon. On the fore-deck, a little forward
of the mainmast, we find the two ship's pumps proper, constructed
of wood. The suction-pipe is of wood, covered on the outside with
lead, so as to ]prevent leakage through possible cracks in the
wood; the valves are of leather, and the piston of wood, with a
leather covering. The pump-action is the usual nickel action,
that was formerly general on our ships, and is still widely used
on smacks. These simple pumps have been shown by experience to
work better than any others in severe cold. The fore-deck also
has skylights over the fore-saloon, the main and fore hatches,
and finally the capstan. This is of the ordinary horizontal type,
from Pusnes Engineering Works; it is driven by the motor below,
as already mentioned. The capstan can also be used as a winch,
and it can be worked by hand-power.</p>
<p>The <i>Fram</i> carries six boats: one large decked boat (29 x
9 x 4 feet)&mdash;one of the two large boats carried on Nansen's
expedition&mdash;placed between the mainmast and the foremast,
over the skylight; three whale-boats (20 x 6 feet), and one large
and one small pram; the two last are carried on davits as shown
in the drawing. One of these whale-boats was left behind on the
Ice Barrier, where it was buried in snow when the ship left. It
was brought ashore that the wintering party might have a boat at
their disposal after the <i>Fram</i> had sailed.</p>
<p>For warming the vessel it is intended to use only petroleum.
For warming the laboratory (chart-house) there is an arrangement
by which hot air from the galley is brought up through its
forward wall.</p>
<p>The vessel was provided with iron chain plates bolted to the
timbers above the ice-skin. The mizzenmast is new. There was a
crack in the beam that forms the support for the mizzenmast; it
was therefore strengthened with two heavy iron plates, secured by
through-bolts. Two strong steel stanchions were also placed on
each side of the engine, carried down to the frame-timbers. The
old mizzenmast has been converted into a bowsprit and jib-boom in
one piece. There are now standing gaffs on all three masts. The
sail area is about 6,640 square feet.</p>
<p>All the cabins are insulated in the same way as before, though
it has been found possible to simplify this somewhat. In general
the insulation consists of:</p>
<p>1. In the cabins, against the ship's side and under the upper
deck, there is first a layer of cork, and over that a double
panelling of wood with tarred felt between.</p>
<p>2. Above the orlop deck aft there is a layer of cork, and
above this a floor of boards covered with linoleum.</p>
<p>3. Under the orlop deck forward there is wooden panelling,
with linoleum over the deck.</p>
<p>Bulkheads abutting on parts of the ship that are not warmed
consist of three thicknesses of boards or planks with various
non-conducting materials, such as cork or felt, between them.</p>
<p>When the vessel was docked before leaving Horten, the zinc
sheathing was removed, as already stated, since fears were
entertained that it would be torn by the ice, and would then
prevent the ice from slipping readily under the bottom during
pressure. The vessel has two anchors, but the former port anchor
has been replaced by a considerably heavier one (1 ton 1&frac12;
hundredweight), with a correspondingly heavier chain-cable. This
was done with a special view to the voyage round Cape Horn.</p>
<p>In order to trim the ship as much as possible by the stern,
which was desirable on account of her carrying a weather helm, a
number of heavy spare stores, such as the old port anchor and its
cable, were stowed aft, and the extreme after-peak was filled
with cement containing round pieces of iron punched out of
plates.</p>
<p>Along the railing round the fore-deck strong netting has been
placed to prevent the dogs falling overboard. For the upper deck
a loose wooden grating has been made, so that the dogs shall not
lie on the wet deck. Awnings are provided over the whole deck,
with only the necessary openings for working the ship. In this
way the dogs have been given dry and, as far as possible, cool
quarters for the voyage through the tropics. It is proposed to
use the ship's spars as supports for a roof of boards, to be put
up during the drift through the ice as a protection against
falling masses of ice.</p>
<p>The <i>Fram</i>'s new engine is a direct reversible
Marine-Polar-Motor, built by the Diesel Motor Co., of Stockholm.
It is a Diesel engine, with four working and two air-pump
cylinders, and develops normally at 280 revolutions per minute
180 effective horse-power, with a consumption of oil of about
7&frac34; ounces per effective horse-power per hour. With this
comparatively small consumption, the <i>Fram</i>'s fuel capacity
will carry her much farther than if she had a steam-engine, a
consideration of great importance in her forthcoming long voyage
in the Arctic Sea. With her oil capacity of about 90 tons, she
will thus be able to go uninterruptedly for about 2,273 hours, or
about 95 days. If we reckon her speed under engine power alone at
4&frac12; knots, she will be able to go about 10,000 nautical
miles without replenishing her oil-supply. It is a fault in the
new engine that its number of revolutions is very high, which
necessitates the use of a propeller of small diameter (5 feet 9
inches), and thus of low efficiency in the existing conditions.
This is the more marked on account of the unusual thickness of
the <i>Fram</i>'s propeller-post, which masks the propeller to a
great extent. The position of the engine will be seen in Fig. 1.
The exhaust gases from the engine are sent up by a pipe through
the after-saloon, through its skylight, and up to a large valve
on the bridge; from this valve two horizontal pipes run along the
after side of the bridge, one to each side: By means of the valve
the gases can be diverted to one side or the other, according to
the direction of the wind.</p>

<br>
<p>Besides the usual auxiliary engines, the main engine drives a
large centrifugal bilge-pump, an ordinary machine bilge-pump, and
a fan for use in the tropics.</p>
<p>When the <i>Fram</i> left Christiania in the spring of 1910,
after taking her cargo on board, she drew 17 feet forward and 19
feet 5 inches aft. This corresponds to a displacement (measured
outside the ice-skin) of about 1,100 tons. The ice-skin was then
12&frac12; inches above the waterline amidships.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX II<br>
<br>
<small>REMARKS ON THE METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS AT FRAMHEIM<br>
<br>
<small>BY B. J. BIRKELAND</small></small></h3>
<p><small>ON</small> account of the improvised character of the
South Polar Expedition, the meteorological department on the
<i>Fram</i> was not so complete as it ought to have been. It had
not been possible to provide the aerological outfit at the time
of sailing, and the meteorologist of the expedition was therefore
left behind in Norway. But certain things were wanting even to
complete the equipment of an ordinary meteorological station,
such as minimum thermometers and the necessary instructions that
should have accompanied one or two of the instruments.
Fortunately, among the veterans of the expedition there were
several practised observers, and, notwithstanding all drawbacks,
a fine series of observations was obtained during ten months'
stay in winter-quarters on the Antarctic continent. These
observations will provide a valuable supplement to the
simultaneous records of other expeditions, especially the British
in McMurdo Sound and the German in Weddell Sea, above all as
regards the hypsometer observations (for the determination of
altitude) on sledge journeys. It may be hoped, in any case, that
it will be possible to interpolate the atmospheric pressure at
sea-level in all parts of the Antarctic continent that were
traversed by the sledging expeditions. For this reason the
publication of a provisional working out of the observations is
of great importance at the present moment, although the general
public will, perhaps, look upon the long rows of figures as
tedious and superfluous. The complete working out of these
observations can only be published after a lapse of some
years.</p>
<p>As regards the accuracy of the figures here given, it must be
noted that at present we know nothing about possible alterations
in the errors of the different instruments, as it will not be
possible to have the instruments examined and compared until we
arrive at San Francisco next year. We have provisionally used the
errors that were determined at the Norwegian Meteorological
Institute before the expedition sailed; it does not appear,
however, that they have altered to any great extent.</p>
<p>The meteorological outfit on the <i>Fram</i> consisted of the
following instruments and apparatus:</p>
<p class="indent1">Three mercury barometers, namely:</p>
<p class="indent2">One normal barometer by Fuess, No. 361.<br>
One Kew standard barometer by Adie, No. 839.<br>
One Kew marine barometer by Adie, No. 764.</p>
<p class="indent1">Five aneroid barometers:</p>
<p class="indent2">One large instrument with thermometer
attached, without name or number.<br>
Two pocket aneroids by Knudsen, Copenhagen, one numbered
1,503.<br>
Two pocket aneroids by Cary, London, Nos. 1,367 and 1,368, for
altitudes up to 5,000 metres (16,350 feet).<br>
Two hypsometers by Casella, with several thermometers.</p>
<p class="indent1">Mercury thermometers:</p>
<p class="indent2">Twelve ordinary standard (psychrometer-)
thermometers, divided to fifths of a degree (Centigrade).<br>
Ten ordinary standard thermometers, divided to degrees.<br>
Four sling thermometers, divided to half degrees.<br>
Three maximum thermometers, divided to degrees.<br>
One normal thermometer by Mollenkopf, No. 25.</p>
<p class="indent1">Toluene thermometers:</p>
<p class="indent2">Eighteen sling thermometers, divided to
degrees.<br>
Three normal thermometers&mdash;by Tounelot, No. 4,993, and
Baudin, Nos. 14,803 and 14,804.</p>
<p class="indent1">Two torsion hair hygrometers of Russeltvedt's
construction, Nos. 12 and 14.</p>
<p class="indent1">One cup and cross anemometer of Professor
Mohn's construction, with spare cross.</p>
<p class="indent1">One complete set of precipitation gauges, with
Nipher's shield, gauges for snow density, etc.</p>
<p class="indent1">Registering instruments:</p>
<p class="indent2">Two barographs.<br>
Two thermographs.<br>
One hair hygrograph.<br>
A number of spare parts, and a supply of paper and ink for seven
years.</p>
<p>In addition, various books were taken, such as Mohn's
"Meteorology," the Meteorological Institute's "Guide,"
psychrometric tables, Wiebe's steam-pressure tables for
hypsometer observations, etc.</p>
<p>The marine barometer, the large aneroid, and one of the
barographs, the four mercury sling thermometers, and two
whole-degree standard thermometers, were kept on board the
<i>Fram</i>, where they were used for the regular observations
every four hours on the vessel's long voyages backwards and
forwards.</p>
<p>As will be seen, the shore party was thus left without mercury
sling thermometers, besides having no minimum thermometers; the
three maximum thermometers proved to be of little use. There were
also various defects in the clockwork of the registering
instruments. The barographs and thermographs have been used on
all the Norwegian Polar expeditions; the hygrograph is also an
old instrument, which, in the course of its career, has worked
for over ten years in Christiania, where the atmosphere is by no
means merciful to delicate instruments. Its clockwork had not
been cleaned before it was sent to the <i>Fram</i>, as was done
in the case of the other four instruments. The barographs worked
irreproachably the whole time, but one of the thermographs
refused absolutely to work in the open air, and unfortunately the
spindle pivot of the other broke as early as April 17. At first
the clockwork of the hygrograph would not go at all, as the oil
had become thick, and it was not until this had been removed by
prolonged severe heating (baking in the oven for several days)
that it could be set going; but then it had to be used for the
thermograph, the mechanism of which was broken, so that no
registration was obtained of the humidity of the air.</p>
<p>The resulting registrations are then as follows: from
Framheim, one set of barograms and two sets of thermograms, of
which one gives the temperature of the air and the other the
temperature inside the house, where the barometers and barograph
were placed; from the <i>Fram</i> we have barograms for the whole
period from her leaving Christiania, in 1910, to her arrival at
Buenos Aires for the third time, in 1912.</p>
<p>Of course, none of these registrations can be taken into
account in the provisional working out, as they will require many
months' work, which, moreover, cannot be carried out with
advantage until we have ascertained about possible changes of
error in the instruments. But occasional use has been made of
them for purposes of checking, and for supplying the only
observation missing in the ten months.</p>
<p>The meteorological station at Framheim was arranged in this
way: the barometers, barograph, and one thermograph hung inside
the house; they were placed in the kitchen, behind the door of
the living-room, which usually stood open, and thus protected
them from the radiant heat of the range. A thermometer, a
hygrometer, and the other thermograph were placed in a screen on
high posts, and with louvred sides, which stood at a distance of
fifteen yards to the south-west of the house. A little way beyond
the screen, again, stood the wind-vane and anemometer. At the end
of September the screen had to be moved a few yards to the east;
the snow had drifted about it until it was only 2&frac12; feet
above the surface, whereas it ought to stand at the height of a
man. At the same time the wind-vane was moved. The screen was
constructed by Lindstr&ouml;m from his recollection of the old
<i>Fram</i> screen.</p>
<p>The two mercury barometers, the Fuess normal, and the Adie
standard barometer, reached Framheim in good condition; as has
been said, they were hung in the kitchen, and the four pocket
aneroids were hung by the side of them. All six were read at the
daily observations at 8 a.m., 2 p.m., and 8 p.m. The normal
barometer, the instructions for which were missing, was used as a
siphon barometer, both the mercury levels being read, and the
bottom screw being locked fast; the usual mode of reading it, on
the other hand, is to set the lower level at zero on the scale by
turning the bottom screw at every observation, whereupon the
upper level only is set and read. The Adie standard barometer is
so arranged that it is only necessary to read the summit of the
mercury. It appears that there is some difference between the
atmospheric pressure values of the two instruments, but this is
chiefly due to the difficult and extremely variable conditions of
temperature. There may be a difference of as much as five degrees
(Centigrade) between the thermometers of the two barometers, in
spite of their hanging side by side at about the same height from
the floor. On the other hand, the normal barometer is not suited
to daily observations, especially in the Polar regions, and the
double reading entails greater liability of error. That the Adie
barometer is rather less sensitive than the other is of small
importance, as the variations of atmospheric pressure at Framheim
were not very great.</p>
<p>In the provisional working out, therefore, the readings of the
Adie barometer alone have been used; those of the normal
barometer, however, have been experimentally reduced for the
first and last months, April and January. The readings have been
corrected for the temperature of the mercury, the constant error
of the instrument, and the variation of the force of gravity from
the normal in latitude 45&deg;. The reduction to sea-level, on
the other hand, has not been made; it amounts to 1.1 millimetre
at an air temperature of -10&deg; Centigrade.</p>
<p>The observations show that the pressure of the atmosphere is
throughout low, the mean for the ten months being 29.07 inches
(738.6 millimetres). It is lower in winter than in summer, July
having 28.86 inches (733.1 millimetres), and December 29.65
inches (753.3 millimetres), as the mean for the month, a
difference of 20.2 millimetres. The highest observation was 30.14
inches (765.7 millimetres) on December 9, and the lowest 28.02
inches (711.7 millimetres) on May 24, 1911; difference, 54
millimetres.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>AIR TEMPERATURE AND
THERMOMETERS.</small></p>
<p>As has already been stated, minimum thermometers and mercury
sling thermometers were wanting. For the first six months only
toluene sling thermometers were used. Sling thermometers are
short, narrow glass thermometers, with a strong loop at the top;
before being read they are briskly swung round at the end of a
string about half a yard long, or in a special apparatus for the
purpose. The swinging brings the thermometer in contact with a
great volume of air, and it therefore gives the real temperature
of the air more readily than if it were hanging quietly in the
screen.</p>
<p>From October 1 a mercury thermometer was also placed in the
screen, though only one divided to whole degrees; those divided
to fifths of a degree would, of course, have given a surer
reading. But it is evident, nevertheless, that the toluene
thermometers used are correct to less than half a degree
(Centigrade), and even this difference may no doubt be explained
by one thermometer being slung while the other was fixed. The
observations are, therefore, given without any corrections. Only
at the end of December was exclusive use made of mercury
thermometers. The maximum thermometers taken proved of so little
use that they were soon discarded; the observations have not been
included here.</p>
<p>It was due to a misunderstanding that mercury thermometers
were not also used in the first half-year, during those periods
when the temperature did not go below the freezing-point of
mercury (-89&deg; C.). But the toluene thermometers in use were
old and good instruments, so that the observations for this
period may also be regarded as perfectly reliable. Of course, all
the thermometers had been carefully examined at the Norwegian
Meteorological Institute, and at Framheim the freezing-point was
regularly tested in melting snow.</p>
<p>The results show that the winter on the Barrier was about
19.&deg; C. (21.6&deg; F.) colder than it usually is in McMurdo
Sound, where the British expeditions winter. The coldest month is
August, with a mean temperature of -44.5&deg; C. (-48.1&deg; F.);
on fourteen days during this month the temperature was below
-50&deg; C. (-58&deg; F.). The lowest temperature occurred on
August 13: -58.5&deg; C. (-73.3&deg; F.); the warmest day in that
month had a temperature of -24&deg; C. (-11.2&deg; F.).</p>
<p>In October spring begins to approach, and in December the
temperature culminates with a mean for the month of -6.6&deg; C.
(+20.1&deg; F.), and a highest maximum temperature of -0.2&deg;
C. (+31.6&deg; F.). The temperature was thus never above
freezing-point, even in the warmest part of the summer.</p>
<p>The daily course of the temperature&mdash;warmest at noon and
coldest towards morning&mdash;is, of course, not noticeable in
winter, as the sun is always below the horizon. But in April
there is a sign of it, and from September onward it is fairly
marked, although the difference between 2 p.m. and the mean of 8
a.m. and 8 p.m. only amounts to 2&deg; C. in the monthly
mean.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>HUMIDITY OF THE AIR.</small></p>
<p>For determining the relative humidity of the air the
expedition had two of Russeltvedt's torsion hygrometers. This
instrument has been accurately described in the
<i>Meteorologische Zeitschrift</i>, 1908, p. 396. It has the
advantage that there are no axles or sockets to be rusted or
soiled, or filled with rime or drift-snow.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Image110" id="Image110"></a><img alt=
"" src="e00111b-images/Image110.jpg"><br>
<br></p>
<p>The two horsehairs (<i>h</i>, <i>h'</i>) that are used, are
stretched tight by a torsion clamp (Z, Z', and L), which also
carries the pointer; the position of the pointer varies with the
length of the hairs, which, again, is dependent on the degree of
humidity of the air. (See the diagrams.) These instruments have
been in use in Norway for several years, especially at inland
stations, where the winter is very cold, and they have shown
themselves superior to all others in accuracy and durability; but
there was no one on the <i>Fram</i> who knew anything about them,
and there is therefore a possibility that they were not always in
such good order as could be wished. On September 10, especially,
the variations are very remarkable; but on October 13 the second
instrument, No. 12, was hung out, and there can be no doubt of
the correctness of the subsequent observations.</p>
<p>It is seen that the relative humidity attains its maximum in
winter, in the months of July and August, with a mean of 90 per
cent. The driest air occurs in the spring month of November, with
a mean of 73 per cent. The remaining months vary between 79 and
86 per cent., and the mean of the whole ten months is 82 per
cent. The variations quoted must be regarded as very small. On
the other hand, the figures themselves are very high, when the
low temperatures are considered, and this is doubtless the result
of there being open water not very far away. The daily course of
humidity is contrary to the course of the temperature, and does
not show itself very markedly, except in January.</p>
<p>The absolute humidity, or partial pressure of aqueous vapour
in the air, expressed in millimetres in the height of the mercury
in the same way as the pressure of the atmosphere, follows in the
main the temperature of the air. The mean value for the whole
period is only 0.8 millimetre (0.031 inch); December has the
highest monthly mean with 2.5 millimetres (0.097 inch), August
the lowest with 0.1 millimetre (0.004 inch). The absolutely
highest observation occurred on December 5 with 4.4 millimetres
(0.173 inch), while the lowest of all is less than 0.05
millimetre, and can therefore only be expressed by 0.0; it
occurred frequently in the course of the winter.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>PRECIPITATION.</small></p>
<p>Any attempt to measure the quantity of
precipitation&mdash;even approximately&mdash;had to be abandoned.
Snowfall never occurred in still weather, and in a wind there was
always a drift that entirely filled the gauge. On June 1 and 7
actual snowfall was observed, but it was so insignificant that it
could not be measured; it was, however, composed of genuine
flakes of snow. It sometimes happened that precipitation of very
small particles of ice was noticed; these grains of ice can be
seen against the observation lantern, and heard on the observer's
headgear; but on returning to the house, nothing can be
discovered on the clothing. Where the sign for snow occurs in the
column for Remarks, it means drift; these days are included among
days of precipitation. Sleet was observed only once, in December.
Rain never.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>CLOUDINESS.</small></p>
<p>The figures indicate how many tenths of the visible heavens
are covered by clouds (or mist). No instrument is used in these
observations; they depend on personal estimate. They had to be
abandoned during the period of darkness, when it is difficult to
see the sky.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>WIND.</small></p>
<p>For measuring the velocity of the wind the expedition had a
cup and cross anemometer, which worked excellently the whole
time. It consists of a horizontal cross with a hollow hemisphere
on each of the four arms of the cross; the openings of the
hemispheres are all turned towards the same side of the
cross-arms, and the cross can revolve with a minimum of friction
on a vertical axis at the point of junction. The axis is
connected with a recording mechanism, which is set in motion at
each observation and stopped after a lapse of half a minute, when
the figure is read off. This figure denotes the velocity of the
wind in metres per second, and is directly transferred to the
tables (here converted into feet per second).</p>
<p>The monthly means vary between 1.9 metres (6.2 feet) in May,
and 5.5 metres (18 feet) in October; the mean for the whole ten
months is 3.4 metres (11.1 feet) per second. These velocities may
be characterized as surprisingly small; and the number of stormy
days agrees with this low velocity. Their number for the whole
period is only 11, fairly evenly divided between the months;
there are, however, five stormy days in succession in the spring
months October and November.</p>
<p>The frequency of the various directions of the wind has been
added up for each month, and gives the same characteristic
distribution throughout the whole period. As a mean we have the
following table, where the figures give the percentage of the
total number of wind observations:</p>
<!--table top page 382-->
<table align="center">

<td>N.   </td>
<td>N.E.   </td>

<td align="center">1.1</td>
<td align="center">21.3</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>
<p>Almost every third direction is E., next to which come S.W.
and S. Real S.E., on the other hand, occurs comparatively rarely.
Of N., N. W., and W. there is hardly anything. It may be
interesting to see what the distribution is when only high winds
are taken into account&mdash;that is, winds with a velocity of 10
metres (32.8 feet) per second or more. We then have the following
table of percentages:</p>
<!--table bottom page 382-->
<table align="center">
<tr>
<td>N.   </td>
<td>N.E.   </td>

<td align="center">2</td>
<td align="center">4</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>
<p>Here again, E. is predominant, as half the high winds come
from this quarter. W. and N.W. together have only 6 per cent.</p>
<p>The total number of high winds is 51, or 5.6 per cent. of the
total of wind observations.</p>
<p>The most frequent directions of storms are also E. and
N.E.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>THE AURORA AUSTRALIS.</small></p>
<p>During the winter months auroral displays were frequently
seen&mdash;altogether on sixty-five days in six months, or an
average of every third day&mdash;but for want of apparatus no
exhaustive observations could be attempted. The records are
confined to brief notes of the position of the aurora at the
times of the three daily observations.</p>
<p>The frequency of the different directions, reckoned in
percentages of the total number of directions given, as for the
wind, will be found in the following table:</p>
<!--table top page 383-->
<table align="center">
<tr>
<td>N.   </td>

<td align="center">8</td>
<td align="center">13</td>
<td align="center">8</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>
<p>N. and N.E. are the most frequent, and together make up
one-third of all the directions recorded; but the nearest points
on either side of this maximum&mdash;E. and N.W.&mdash;are also
very frequent, so that these four points together&mdash;N.W., N.,
N.E., E.&mdash;have 64 per cent. of the whole. The rarest
direction is S.W., with only 3 per cent. (From the position of
the Magnetic Pole in relation to Framheim, one would rather have
expected E. to be the most frequent, and W. the rarest,
direction.) Probably the material before us is somewhat scanty
for establishing these directions.</p>

<p class="negindent"><small>PROVISIONAL REMARKS ON THE
EXAMINATION OF THE GEOLOGICAL SPECIMENS BROUGHT BY ROALD
AMUNDSEN'S SOUTH POLAR EXPEDITION FROM THE ANTARCTIC CONTINENT
(SOUTH VICTORIA LAND AND KING EDWARD VII. LAND). BY J. SCHETELIG,
SECRETARY OF THE MINERALOGICAL INSTITUTE OF CHRISTIANIA
UNIVERSITY.</small></p>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> collection of specimens of rocks brought
back by Mr. Roald Amundsen from his South Polar expedition has
been sent by him to the Mineralogical Institute of the
University, the Director of which, Professor W. C. Br&ouml;gger,
has been good enough to entrust to me the work of examining this
rare and valuable material, which gives us information of the
structure of hitherto untrodden regions.</p>
<p>Roald Amundsen himself brought back altogether about twenty
specimens of various kinds of rock from <i>Mount Betty</i>, which
lies in lat. 85&deg; 8' S. Lieutenant Prestrud's expedition to
King Edward VII. Land collected in all about thirty specimens
from Scott's Nunatak, which was the only mountain bare of snow
that this expedition met with on its route. A number of the
stones from <i>Scott's Nunatak</i> were brought away because they
were thickly overgrown with lichens. These specimens of lichens
have been sent to the Botanical Museum of the University.</p>
<p>A first cursory examination of the material was enough to show
that the specimens from Mount Betty and Scott's Nunatak consist
exclusively of granitic rocks and crystalline schists. There were
no specimens of sedimentary rocks which, by possibly containing
fossils, might have contributed to the determination of the age
of these mountains. Another thing that was immediately apparent
was the striking agreement that exists between the rocks from
these two places, lying so far apart. The distance from Mount
Betty to Scott's Nunatak is between seven and eight degrees of
latitude.</p>
<p>I have examined the specimens microscopically.</p>
<p>From <i>Mount Betty</i> there are several specimens of
<i>white granite</i>, with dark and light mica; it has a great
resemblance to the white granites from Sogn, the Dovre district,
and Nordland, in Norway. There is one very beautiful specimen of
shining white, fine-grained <i>granite aplite</i>, with small,
pale red garnets. These granites show in their exterior no sign
of pressure structure. The remaining rocks from Mount Betty are
<i>gneissic granite</i>, partly very rich in dark mica, and
<i>gneiss</i> (granitic schist); besides <i>mica schist</i>, with
veins of quartz.</p>
<p>From <i>Scott's Nunatak</i> there are also several specimens
of <i>white granite</i>, very like those from Mount Betty. The
remaining rocks from here are richer in lime and iron, and show a
series of gradual transitions from <i>micacious granite</i>,
through <i>grano-diorite</i> to <i>quartz diorite</i>, with
considerable quantities of dark mica, and green hornblende. In
one of the specimens the quantity of free quartz is so small that
the rock is almost a quartz-free <i>diorite</i>. The quartz
diorites are: some medium-grained, some coarse-grained
(quartz-diorite-pegmatite), with streaks of black mica. The
schistose rocks from Scott's Nunatak are streaked, and, in part,
very fine-grained <i>quartz diorite schists</i>. Mica schists do
not occur among the specimens from this mountain.</p>
<p>Our knowledge of the geology of South Victoria Land is mainly
due to Scott's expedition of 1901&mdash;1904, with H. T. Ferrar
as geologist, and Shackleton's expedition of 1907&mdash;08, with
Professor David and R. Priestley as geologists. According to the
investigations of these expeditions, South Victoria Land consists
of a vast, ancient complex of crystalline schists and granitic
rocks, large extents of which are covered by a sandstone
formation ("Beacon Sandstone," Ferrar), on the whole horizontally
bedded, which is at least 1,500 feet thick, and in which
Shackleton found seams of coal and fossil wood (a coniferous
tree). This, as it belongs to the Upper Devonian or Lower
Carboniferous, determines a lower limit for the age of the
sandstone formation. Shackleton also found in lat. 85&deg; 15' S.
beds of limestone, which he regards as underlying and being older
than the sandstone. In the limestone, which is also on the whole
horizontally bedded, only radiolaria have been found. The
limestone is probably of older Pal&aelig;ozoic age (? Silurian).
It is, therefore, tolerably certain that the underlying older
formation of gneisses, crystalline schists and granites, etc., is
of Arch&aelig;an age, and belongs to the foundation rocks.</p>
<p>Volcanic rocks are only found along the coast of Ross Sea and
on a range of islands parallel to the coast. Shackleton did not
find volcanic rocks on his ascent from the Barrier on his route
towards the South Pole.</p>
<p>G. T. Prior, who has described the rocks collected by Scott's
expedition, gives the following as belonging to the complex of
foundation rocks: gneisses, granites, diorites, banatites, and
other eruptive rocks, as well as crystalline limestone, with
chondrodite. Professor David and R. Priestley, the geologists of
Shackleton's expedition, refer to Ferrar's and Prior's
description of the foundation rocks, and state that according to
their own investigations the foundation rocks consist of banded
gneiss, gneissic granite, grano-diorite, and diorite rich in
sphene, besides coarse crystalline limestone as enclosures in the
gneiss.</p>
<p>This list of the most important rocks belonging to the
foundation series of the parts of South Victoria Land already
explored agrees so closely with the rocks from Mount Betty and
Scott's Nunatak, that there can be no doubt that the latter also
belong to the foundation rocks.</p>
<p>From the exhaustive investigations carried out by Scott's and
Shackleton's expeditions it appears that South Victoria Land is a
plateau land, consisting of a foundation platform, of great
thickness and prominence, above which lie remains, of greater or
less extent, of Pal&aelig;ozoic formations, horizontally bedded.
From the specimens of rock brought home by Roald Amundsen's
expedition it is established that the plateau of foundation rocks
is continued eastward to Amundsen's route to the South Pole, and
that King Edward VII. Land is probably a northern continuation,
on the eastern side of Ross Sea, of the foundation rock plateau
of South Victoria Land.</p>

<small>THE ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS AT THE POLE<br>

<p align="right"><small><small>CHRISTIANIA,            <br>
<i>September</i> 16, 1912.</small></small>   </p>
<p>When requested this summer to receive the astronomical
observations from Roald Amundsen's South Pole Expedition, for the
purpose of working them out, I at once put myself in
communication with Mr. A. Alexander (a mathematical master) to
get him to undertake this work, while indicating the manner in
which the materials could be best dealt with. As Mr. Alexander
had in a very efficient manner participated in the working out of
the observations from Nansen's <i>Fram</i> Expedition, and since
then had calculated the astronomical observations from Amundsen's
<i>Gj&ouml;a</i> Expedition, and from Captain Isachsen's
expeditions to Spitzbergen, I knew by experience that he was not
only a reliable and painstaking calculator, but that he also has
so full an insight into the theoretical basis, that he is capable
of working without being bound down by instructions.</p>

<br>
<p align="center">MR. ALEXANDER'S REPORT.</p>
<br>
<p><small>CAPTAIN ROALD AMUNDSEN,</small></p>
<p>   At your request I shall here give briefly the result of my
examination of the observations from your South Pole Expedition.
My calculations are based on the longitude for Framheim given to
me by Lieutenant Prestrud, 163&deg; 37' W. of Greenwich. He
describes this longitude as provisional, but only to such an
extent that the final result cannot differ appreciably from it.
My own results may also be somewhat modified on a final treatment
of the material. But these modifications, again, will only be
immaterial, and, in any case, will not affect the result of the
investigations given below as to the position of the two Polar
stations.</p>
<p>At the first Polar station, on December 15, 1911, eighteen
altitudes of the sun were taken in all with each of the
expedition's sextants. The latitude calculated from these
altitudes is, on an average of both sextants, very near 89&deg;
54', with a mean error of &plusmn;2'. The longitude calculated
from the altitudes is about 7t (105&deg;) E.; but, as might be
expected in this high latitude, the aberrations are very
considerable. We may, however, assume with great certainty that
this station lies between lat. 89&deg; 52' and 89&deg; 56' S.,
and between long. 90&deg; and 120&deg; E.</p>
<p>The variation of the compass at the first Polar station was
determined by a series of bearings of the sun. This gives us the
absolute direction of the last day's line of route. The length of
this line was measured as five and a half geographical miles.
With the help of this we are able to construct for Polheim a
field of the same form and extent as that within which the first
Polar station must lie.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Image111" id="Image111"></a><img alt=
"" src="e00111b-images/Image111.jpg"><br>
<br></p>
<p>At Polheim, during a period of twenty-four hours (December
16-17), observations were taken every hour with one of the
sextants. The observations show an upper culmination altitude of
23&deg; 19.2', and a resulting lower culmination altitude of
23&deg; 17.4'. These combining the above two altitudes, an equal
error on the same side in each will have no influence on the
result. The combination gives a latitude of 89&deg; 58.6'. That
this result must be nearly correct is confirmed by the
considerable displacement of the periods of culmination which is
indicated by the series of observations, and which in the
immediate neighbourhood of the Pole is caused by the change in
the sun's declination. On the day of the observations this
displacement amounted to thirty minutes in 89&deg; 57', forty-six
minutes in 89&deg; 58', and over an hour and a half in 89&deg;
59'. The upper culmination occurred so much too late, and the
lower culmination so much too early. The interval between these
two periods was thus diminished by double the amount of the
displacements given. Now the series of observations shows that
the interval between the upper and the lower culmination amounted
at the most to eleven hours; the displacement of the periods of
culmination was thus at least half an hour. It results that
Polheim must lie south of 89&deg; 57', while at the same time we
may assume that it cannot lie south of 89&deg; 59'. The moments
of culmination could, of course, only be determined very
approximately, and in the same way the observations as a whole
are unserviceable for the determination of longitude. It may,
however, be stated with some certainty that the longitude must be
between 30&deg; and 75&deg; E. The latitude, as already
mentioned, is between 89&deg; 57' and 89&deg; 59', and the
probable position of Polheim may be given roughly as lat. 89&deg;
58.5' S., and long. 60&deg; E.</p>
<p>On the accompanying sketch-chart the letters <i>abcd</i>
indicate the field within which the first Polar station must lie;
<i>ABCD</i> is the field which is thereby assigned to Polheim;
<i>EFGH</i> the field within which Polheim must lie according to
the observations taken on the spot itself; P the probable
position of Polheim, and L the resulting position of the first
Polar station. The position thus assigned to the latter agrees as
well as could be expected with the average result of the
observations of December 15. According to this, Polheim would be
assumed to lie one and a half geographical miles, or barely three
kilometres, from the South Pole, and certainly not so much as six
kilometres from it.</p>
<p>From your verbal statement I learn that Helmer Hanssen and
Bjaaland walked four geographical miles from Polheim in the
direction taken to be south on the basis of the observations. On
the chart the letters <i>efgh</i> give the field within which the
termination of their line of route must lie. It will be seen from
this that they passed the South Pole at a distance which, on the
one hand, can hardly have been so great as two and a half
kilometres, and on the other, hardly so great as two kilometres;
that, if the assumed position of Polheim be correct, they passed
the actual Pole at a distance of between 400 and 600 metres; and
that it is very probable that they passed the actual Pole at a
distance of a few hundred metres, perhaps even less.</p>

<br>
<small>OCEANOGRAPHY</small></h3>
<p class="negindent"><small>REMARKS OF THE OCEANOGRAPHICAL
INVESTIGATION CARRIED OUT BY THE "FRAM" IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC IN
1910 AND IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC IN 1911. BY PROFESSOR BJ&Ouml;RN
HELLAND-HANSEN AND PROFESSOR FRIDTJOF NANSEN</small></p>
<br>
<p>In the earliest ages of the human race the sea formed an
absolute barrier. Men looked out upon its immense surface, now
calm and bright, now lashed by storms, and always mysteriously
attractive; but they could not grapple with it. Then they learned
to make boats; at first small, simple craft, which could only be
used when the sea was calm. But by degrees the boats were made
larger and more perfect, so that they could venture farther out
and weather a storm if it came. In antiquity the peoples of
Europe accomplished the navigation of the Mediterranean, and the
boldest maritime nation was able to sail round Africa and find
the way to India by sea. Then came voyages to the northern waters
of Europe, and far back in the Middle Ages enterprising seamen
crossed from Norway to Iceland and Greenland and the
north-eastern part of North America. They sailed straight across
the North Atlantic, and were thus the true discoverers of that
ocean.</p>
<p>Even in antiquity the Greek geographers had assumed that the
greater part of the globe was covered by sea, but it was not till
the beginning of the modern age that any at all accurate idea
arose of the extent of the earth's great masses of water. The
knowledge of the ocean advanced with more rapid steps than ever
before. At first this knowledge only extended to the surface, the
comparative area of oceans, their principal currents, and the
general distribution of temperature. In the middle of the last
century Maury collected all that was known, and drew charts of
the currents and winds for the assistance of navigation. This was
the beginning of the scientific study of the oceanic waters; at
that time the conditions below the surface were still little
known. A few investigations, some of them valuable, had been made
of the sea fauna, even at great depths, but very little had been
done towards investigating the physical conditions. It was seen,
however, that there was here a great field for research, and that
there were great and important problems to be solved; and then,
half a century ago, the great scientific expeditions began, which
have brought an entire new world to our knowledge.</p>
<p>It is only forty years since the <i>Challenger</i> sailed on
the first great exploration of the oceans. Although during these
forty years a quantity of oceanographical observations has been
collected with a constant improvement of methods, it is,
nevertheless, clear that our knowledge of the ocean is still only
in the preliminary stage. The ocean has an area twice as great as
that of the dry land, and it occupies a space thirteen times as
great as that occupied by the land above sea-level. Apart from
the great number of soundings for depth alone, the number of
oceanographical stations&mdash;with a series of physical and
biological observations at various depths&mdash;is very small in
proportion to the vast masses of water; and there are still
extensive regions of the ocean of the conditions of which we have
only a suspicion, but no certain knowledge. This applies also to
the Atlantic Ocean, and especially to the South Atlantic.</p>
<p>Scientific exploration of the ocean has several objects. It
seeks to explain the conditions governing a great and important
part of our earth, and to discover the laws that control the
immense masses of water in the ocean. It aims at acquiring a
knowledge of its varied fauna and flora, and of the relations
between this infinity of organisms and the medium in which they
live. These were the principal problems for the solution of which
the voyage of the <i>Challenger</i> and other scientific
expeditions were undertaken. Maury's leading object was to
explain the conditions that are of practical importance to
navigation; his investigations were, in the first instance,
applied to utilitarian needs.</p>
<p>But the physical investigation of the ocean has yet another
very important bearing. The difference between a sea climate and
a continental climate has long been understood; it has long been
known that the sea has an equalizing effect on the temperature of
the air, so that in countries lying near the sea there is not so
great a difference between the heat of summer and the cold of
winter as on continents far from the sea-coast. It has also long
been understood that the warm currents produce a comparatively
mild climate in high latitudes, and that the cold currents coming
from the Polar regions produce a low temperature. It has been
known for centuries that the northern arm of the Gulf Stream
makes Northern Europe as habitable as it is, and that the Polar
currents on the shores of Greenland and Labrador prevent any
richer development of civilization in these regions. But it is
only recently that modern investigation of the ocean has begun to
show the intimate interaction between sea and air; an interaction
which makes it probable that we shall be able to forecast the
main variations in climate from year to year, as soon as we have
a sufficiently large material in the shape of soundings.</p>
<p>In order to provide new oceanographical material by modern
methods, the plan of the <i>Fram</i> expedition included the
making of a number of investigations in the Atlantic Ocean. In
June, 1910, the <i>Fram</i> went on a trial cruise in the North
Atlantic to the west of the British Isles. Altogether twenty-five
stations were taken in this region during June and July before
the <i>Fram</i>'s final departure from Norway.</p>
<p>The expedition then went direct to the Antarctic and landed
the shore party on the Barrier. Neither on this trip nor on the
<i>Fram</i>'s subsequent voyage to Buenos Aires were any
investigations worth mentioning made, as time was too short; but
in June, 1911, Captain Nilsen took the <i>Fram</i> on a cruise in
the South Atlantic and made in all sixty valuable stations along
two lines between South America and Africa.</p>
<p>An exhaustive working out of the very considerable material
collected on these voyages has not yet been possible. We shall
here only attempt to set forth the most conspicuous results shown
by a preliminary examination.</p>
<p>Besides the meteorological observations and the collection of
plankton&mdash;in fine silk tow-nets&mdash;the investigations
consisted of taking temperatures and samples of water at
different depths The temperatures below the surface were
ascertained by the best modern reversing thermometers
(Richter's); these thermometers are capable of giving the
temperature to within a few hundredths of a degree at any depth.
Samples of water were taken for the most part with Ekman's
reversing water-sampler; it consists of a brass tube, with a
valve at each end. When it is lowered the valves are open, so
that the water passes freely through the tube. When the apparatus
has reached the depth from which a sample is to be taken, a small
slipping sinker is sent down along the line. When the sinker
strikes the sampler, it displaces a small pin, which holds the
brass tube in the position in which the valves remain open. The
tube then swings over, and this closes the valves, so that the
tube is filled with a hermetically enclosed sample of water.
These water samples were put into small bottles, which were
afterwards sent to Bergen, where the salinity of each sample was
determined. On the first cruise, in June and July, 1910, the
observations on board were carried out by Mr. Adolf Schr&ouml;er,
besides the permanent members of the expedition. The observations
in the South Atlantic in the following year were for the most
part carried out by Lieutenant Gjertsen and Kutschin.</p>
<p>The Atlantic Ocean is traversed by a series of main currents,
which are of great importance on account of their powerful
influence on the physical conditions of the surrounding regions
of sea and atmosphere. By its oceanographical investigations in
1910 and 1911 the <i>Fram</i> expedition has made important
contributions to our knowledge of many of these currents. We
shall first speak of the investigations in the North Atlantic in
1910, and afterwards of those in the South Atlantic in 1911.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>INVESTIGATIONS IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC IN
JUNE AND JULY, 1910.</small></p>
<p>The waters of the Northern Atlantic Ocean, to the north of
lats. 80&deg; and 40&deg; N., are to a great extent in drifting
motion north-eastward and eastward from the American to the
European side. This drift is what is popularly called the Gulf
Stream. To the west of the Bay of Biscay the eastward flow of
water divides into two branches, one going south-eastward and
southward, which is continued in the Canary Current, and the
other going north-eastward and northward outside the British
Isles, which sends comparatively warm streams of water both in
the direction of Iceland and past the Shetlands and Faroes into
the Norwegian Sea and north-eastward along the west coast of
Norway. This last arm of the Gulf Stream in the Norwegian Sea has
been well explored during the last ten or fifteen years; its
course and extent have been charted, and it has been shown to be
subject to great variations from year to year, which again appear
to be closely connected with variations in the development and
habitat of several important species of fish, such as cod,
coal-fish, haddock, etc., as well as with variations in the
winter climate of Norway, the crops, and other important
conditions. By closely following the changes in the Gulf Stream
from year to year, it looks as if we should be able to predict a
long time in advance any great changes in the cod and haddock
fisheries in the North Sea, as well as variations in the winter
climate of North-Western Europe.</p>
<p>But the cause or causes of these variations in the Gulf Stream
are at present unknown. In order to solve this difficult question
we must be acquainted with the conditions in those regions of the
Atlantic itself through which this mighty ocean current flows,
before it sends its waters into the Norwegian Sea. But here we
are met by the difficulty that the investigations that have been
made hitherto are extremely inadequate and deficient; indeed, we
have no accurate knowledge even of the course and extent of the
current in this ocean. A thorough investigation of it with the
improved methods of our time is therefore an inevitable
necessity.</p>

CURRENTS IN THE NORTHERN ATLANTIC IN APRIL.<br>
<br>
<small>After Nansen, in the <i>Internationale Revue der gesamten
Hydrobiologie and Hydrographie</i>, 1912.</small></small></p>
<br>
<p>As the Gulf Stream is of so great importance to Northern
Europe in general, but especially to us Norwegians, it was not a
mere accident that three separate expeditions left Norway in the
same year, 1910&mdash;Murray and Hjort's expedition in the
<i>Michael Sars</i>, Amundsen's trial trip in the <i>Fram</i>,
and Nansen's voyage in the gunboat <i>Frithjof</i>&mdash;all with
the object of investigating the conditions in the North Atlantic.
The fact that on these three voyages observations were made
approximately at the same time in different parts of the ocean
increases their value in a great degree, since they can thus be
directly compared; we are thus able to obtain, for instance, a
reliable survey of the distribution of temperature and salinity,
and to draw important conclusions as to the extent of the
currents and the motion of the masses of water.</p>
<p>Amundsen's trial trip in the <i>Fram</i> and Nansen's voyage
in the <i>Frithjof</i> were made with the special object of
studying the Gulf Stream in the ocean to the west of the British
Isles, and by the help of these investigations it is now possible
to chart the current and the extent of the various volumes of
water at different depths in this region at that time.</p>
<p>A series of stations taken within the same region during
Murray and Hjort's expedition completes the survey, and provides
valuable material for comparison.</p>
<p>After sailing from Norway over the North Sea, the <i>Fram</i>
passed through the English Channel in June, 1910, and the first
station was taken on June 20, to the south of Ireland, in lat.
50&deg; 50' N. and long. 10&deg; 15' W., after which thirteen
stations were taken to the westward, to lat. 58&deg; 16' N. and
long. 17&deg; 50' W., where the ship was on June 27. Her course
then went in a northerly direction to lat. 57&deg; 59' N. and
long. 15&deg; 8' W., from which point a section of eleven
stations (Nos. 15&mdash;25) was made straight across the Gulf
Stream to the bank on the north of Scotland, in lat. 59&deg; 88'
N. and long. 4&deg; 44' W. The voyage and the stations are
represented in Fig. 2. Temperatures and samples of water were
taken at all the twenty-four stations at the following depths:
surface, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, and
500 metres (2.7, 5.4, 10.9, 16.3, 21.8, 27.2, 40.8, 54.5, 81.7,
109, 163.5, 218, and 272.5 fathoms) &mdash; or less, where the
depth was not so great.</p>
<p>The <i>Fram</i>'s southerly section, from Station 1 to 13 (see
Fig. 3) is divided into two parts at Station 10, on the Porcupine
Bank, south-west of Ireland. The eastern part, between Stations 1
and 10, extends over to the bank south of Ireland, while the
three stations of the western part lie in the deep sea west of
the Porcupine Bank.</p>

<p>In both parts of this section there are, as shown in Fig. 3,
two great volumes of water, from the surface down to depths
greater than 500 metres, which have salinities between 35.4 and
35.5 per mille. They have also comparatively high temperatures;
the isotherm for 10&deg; C. goes down to a depth of about 500
metres in both these parts.</p>

<small>FIG. 3.&mdash;TEMPERATURE AND SALINITY IN THE "FRAM'S"
SOUTHERN SECTION, JUNE, 1910.</small></p>
<br>
<p>It is obvious that both these comparatively salt and warm
volumes of water belong to the Gulf Stream. The more westerly of
them, at Stations 11 and 12, and in part 13, in the deep sea to
the west of the Porcupine Bank, is probably in motion towards the
north-east along the outside of this bank and then into Rockall
Channel&mdash;between Rockall Bank and the bank to the west of
the British Isles&mdash;where a corresponding volume of water,
with a somewhat lower salinity, is found again in the section
which was taken a few weeks later by the <i>Frithjof</i> from
Ireland to the west-north-west across the Rockall Bank. This
volume of water has a special interest for us, since, as will be
mentioned later, it forms the main part of that arm of the Gulf
Stream which enters the Norwegian Sea, but which is gradually
cooled on its way and mixed with fresher water, so that its
salinity is constantly decreasing. This fresher water is
evidently derived in great measure directly from precipitation,
which is here in excess of the evaporation from the surface of
the sea.</p>
<p>The volume of Gulf Stream water that is seen in the eastern
part (east of Station 10) of the southern <i>Fram</i> section,
can only flow north-eastward to a much less extent, as the
Porcupine Bank is connected with the bank to the west of Ireland
by a submarine ridge (with depths up to about 300 metres), which
forms a great obstacle to such a movement.</p>
<p>The two volumes of Gulf Stream water in the <i>Fram</i>'s
southern section of 1910 are divided by a volume of water, which
lies over the Porcupine Bank, and has a lower salinity and also a
somewhat lower average temperature. On the bank to the south of
Ireland (Stations 1 and 2) the salinity and average temperature
are also comparatively low. The fact that the water on the banks
off the coast has lower salinities, and in part lower
temperatures, than the water outside in the deep sea, has usually
been explained by its being mixed with the coast water, which is
diluted with river water from the land. This explanation may be
correct in a great measure; but, of course, it will not apply to
the water over banks that lie out in the sea, far from any land.
It appears, nevertheless, on the Porcupine Bank, for instance,
and, as we shall see later, on the Rockall Bank, that the water
on these ocean banks is&mdash;in any case in early
summer&mdash;colder and less salt than the surrounding water of
the sea. It appears from the <i>Frithjof</i> section across the
Rockall Bank, as well as from the two <i>Fram</i> sections, that
this must be due to precipitation combined with the vertical
currents near the surface, which are produced by the cooling of
the surface of the sea in the course of the winter. For, as the
surface water cools, it becomes heavier than the water
immediately below, and must then sink, while it is replaced by
water from below. These vertical currents extend deeper and
deeper as the cooling proceeds in the course of the winter, and
bring about an almost equal temperature and salinity in the upper
waters of the sea during the winter, as far down as this vertical
circulation reaches. But as the precipitation in these regions is
constantly decreasing the salinity of the surface water, this
vertical circulation must bring about a diminution of salinity in
the underlying waters, with which the sinking surface water is
mixed into a homogeneous volume of water. The <i>Frithjof</i>
section in particular seems to show that the vertical circulation
in these regions reaches to a depth of 500 or 600 metres at the
close of the winter. If we consider, then, what must happen over
a bank in the ocean, where the depth is less than this, it is
obvious that the vertical circulation will here be prevented by
the bottom from reaching the depth it otherwise would, and there
will be a smaller volume of water to take part in this
circulation and to be mixed with the cooled and diluted surface
water. But as the cooling of the surface and the precipitation
are the same there as in the surrounding regions, the consequence
must be that the whole of this volume of water over the bank will
be colder and less salt than the surrounding waters. And as this
bank water, on account of its lower temperature, is heavier than
the water of the surrounding sea, it will have a tendency to
spread itself outwards along the bottom, and to sink down along
the slopes from the sides of the bank. This obviously contributes
to increase the opposition that such banks offer to the advance
of ocean currents, even when they lie fairly deep.</p>
<p>These conditions, which in many respects are of great
importance, are clearly shown in the two <i>Fram</i> sections and
the <i>Frithjof</i> section.</p>
<p>The Northern <i>Fram</i> section went from a point to the
north-west of the Rockall Bank (Station 15), across the northern
end of this bank (Station 16), and across the northern part of
the wide channel (Rockall Channel) between it and Scotland. As
might be expected, both temperature and salinity are lower in
this section than in the southern one, since in the course of
their slow northward movement the waters are cooled, especially
by the vertical circulation in winter already mentioned, and are
mixed with water containing less salt, especially precipitated
water. While in the southern section the isotherm for 10&deg; C.
went down to 500 metres, it here lies at a depth of between 50
and 25 metres. In the comparatively short distance between the
two sections, the whole volume of water has been cooled between
1&deg; and 2&deg; C. This represents a great quantity of warmth,
and it is chiefly given off to the air, which is thus warmed over
a great area. Water contains more than 3,000 times as much warmth
as the same volume of air at the same temperature. For example,
if 1 cubic metre of water is cooled 1&deg;, and the whole
quantity of warmth thus taken from the water is given to the air,
it is sufficient to warm more than 3,000 cubic metres of air
1&deg;, when subjected to the pressure of one atmosphere. In
other words, if the surface water of a region of the sea is
cooled 1&deg; to a depth of 1 metre, the quantity of warmth thus
taken from the sea is sufficient to warm the air of the same
region 1&deg; up to a height of much more than 3,000 metres,
since at high altitudes the air is subjected to less pressure,
and consequently a cubic metre there contains less air than at
the sea-level. But it is not a depth of 1 metre of the Gulf
Stream that has been cooled 1&deg; between these two sections; it
is a depth of about 500 metres or more, and it has been cooled
between 1&deg; and 2&deg; C. It will thus be easily understood
that this loss of warmth from the Gulf Stream must have a
profound influence on the temperature of the air over a wide
area; we see how it comes about that warm currents like this are
capable of rendering the climate of countries so much milder, as
is the case in Europe; and we see further how comparatively
slight variations in the temperature of the current from year to
year must bring about considerable variations in the climate; and
how we must be in a position to predict these latter changes when
the temperature of the currents becomes the object of extensive
and continuous investigation. It may be hoped that this is enough
to show that far-reaching problems are here in question.</p>

<br>
<small>FIG. 4.&mdash;TEMPERATURE AND SALINITY IN THE "FRAM'S"
NORTHERN SECTION, JULY 1910</small></p>
<br>
<p>The salinity of the Gulf Stream water decreases considerably
between the <i>Fram</i>'s southern and northern sections. While
in the former it was in great part between 35.4 and 35.5 per
mille, in the latter it is throughout not much more than 35.3 per
mille. In this section, also, the waters of the Gulf Stream are
divided by an accumulation of less salt and somewhat colder bank
water, which here lies over the Rockall Bank (Station 16). On the
west side of this bank there is again (Station 15) salter and
warmer Gulf Stream water, though not quite so warm as on the
east. From the <i>Frithjof</i> section, a little farther south,
it appears that this western volume of Gulf Stream water is
comparatively small. The investigations of the <i>Fram</i> and
the <i>Frithjof</i> show that the part of the Gulf Stream which
penetrates into the Norwegian Sea comes in the main through the
Rockall Channel, between the Rockall Bank and the bank to the
west of the British Isles; its width in this region is thus
considerably less than was usually supposed. Evidently this is
largely due to the influence of the earth's rotation, whereby
currents in the northern hemisphere are deflected to the right,
to a greater degree the farther north they run. In this way the
ocean currents, especially in northern latitudes, are forced
against banks and coasts lying to the right of them, and
frequently follow the edges, where the coast banks slope down to
the deep. The conclusion given above, that the Gulf Stream comes
through the Rockall Channel, is of importance to future
investigations; it shows that an annual investigation of the
water of this channel would certainly contribute in a valuable
way to the understanding of the variations of the climate of
Western Europe.</p>
<p>We shall not dwell at greater length here on the results of
the <i>Fram</i>'s oceanographical investigations in 1910. Only
when the observations then collected, as well as those of the
<i>Frithjof</i>'s and <i>Michael Sars</i>'s voyages, have been
fully worked out shall we be able to make a complete survey of
what has been accomplished.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>INVESTIGATIONS IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC,
JUNE TO AUGUST, 1911.</small></p>
<p>In the South Atlantic we have the southward Brazil Current on
the American side, and the northward Benguela Current on the
African side. In the southern part of the ocean there is a wide
current flowing from west to east in the west wind belt. And in
its northern part, immediately south of the Equator, the South
Equatorial Current flows from east to west. We have thus in the
South Atlantic a vast circle of currents, with a motion contrary
to that of the hands of a clock. The <i>Fram</i> expedition has
now made two full sections across the central part of the South
Atlantic; these sections take in both the Brazil Current and the
Benguela Current, and they lie between the eastward current on
the south and the westward current on the north. This is the
first time that such complete sections have been obtained between
South America and Africa in this part of the ocean. And no doubt
a larger number of stations were taken on the <i>Fram</i>'s
voyage than have been taken&mdash;with the same amount of
detail&mdash;in the whole South Atlantic by all previous
expeditions put together.</p>
<p>When the <i>Fram</i> left Buenos Aires in June, 1911, the
expedition went eastward through the Brazil Current. The first
station was taken in lat. 36&deg; 18' S. and long. 43&deg; 15'
W.; this was on June 17. Her course was then north-east or east
until Station 32 in lat. 20&deg; 30' S. and long. 8&deg; 10' E.;
this station lay in the Benguela Current, about 800 miles from
the coast of Africa, and it was taken on July 22. From there she
went in a gentle curve past St. Helena and Trinidad back to
America. The last station (No. 60) was taken on August 19 in the
Brazil Current in lat. 24&deg; 39' S. and about long. 40&deg; W.;
this station lay about 200 miles south-east of Rio de
Janeiro.</p>

<small>FIG. 5&mdash;THE "FRAM'S" STATIONS IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC
(JUNE-AUGUST, 1911.</small></p>
<br>
<p>There was an average distance of 100 nautical miles between
one station and the next. At nearly all the stations
investigations were made at the following depths: surface, 5, 10,
25, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 750, and 1,000 metres
(2.7, 5.4, 13.6, 27.2, 54.5, 81.7, 109, 136.2, 163.5, 218, 272.5,
and 545 fathoms). At one or two of the stations observations were
also taken at 1,500 and 2,000 metres (817.5 and 1,090
fathoms).</p>
<p>The investigations were thus carried out from about the middle
of July to the middle of August, in that part of the southern
winter which corresponds to the period between the middle of
December and the middle of February in the northern hemisphere We
must first see what the conditions were on the surface in those
regions in the middle of the winter of 1911.</p>

<small>FIG. 6.&mdash;CURRENTS IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC (JUNE-AUGUST,
1911).</small></p>
<br>
<p>It must be remembered that the currents on the two sides of
the ocean flow in opposite directions. Along the coast of Africa,
we have the Benguela Current, flowing from south to north; on the
American side the Brazil Current flows from the tropics
southward. The former current is therefore comparatively cold and
the latter comparatively warm. This is clearly seen on the chart,
which shows the distribution of temperatures and salinities on
the surface. In lat. 20&deg; S. it was only about 17&deg; C. off
the African coast, while it was about 23&deg; C. off the coast of
Brazil.</p>

<br>
<small>FIG. 7.&mdash;SALINITIES AND TEMPERATURES AT THE SURFACE
IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC (JUNE-AUGUST, 1911).</small></p>
<br>
<p>The salinity depends on the relation between evaporation and
the addition of fresh water. The Benguela Current comes from
regions where the salinity is comparatively low; this is due to
the acquisition of fresh water in the Antarctic Ocean, where the
evaporation from the surface is small and the precipitation
comparatively large. A part of this fresh water is also acquired
by the sea in the form of icebergs from the Antarctic Continent.
These icebergs melt as they drift about the sea.</p>
<p>Immediately off the African coast there is a belt where the
salinity is under 35 per mille on the surface; farther out in the
Benguela Current the salinity is for the most part between 35 and
36 per mille. As the water is carried northward by the current,
evaporation becomes greater and greater; the air becomes
comparatively warm and dry. Thereby the salinity is raised. The
Benguela Current is then continued westward in the South
Equatorial Current; a part of this afterwards turns to the
north-west, and crosses the Equator into the North Atlantic,
where it joins the North Equatorial Current. This part must thus
pass through the belt of calms in the tropics. In this region
falls of rain occur, heavy enough to decrease the surface
salinity again. But the other part of the South Equatorial
Current turns southward along the coast of Brazil, and is then
given the name of the Brazil Current. The volume of water that
passes this way receives at first only small additions of
precipitation; the air is so dry and warm in this region that the
salinity on the surface rises to over 37 per mille. This will be
clearly seen on the chart; the saltest water in the whole South
Atlantic is found in the northern part of the Brazil Current.
Farther to the south in this current the salinity decreases
again, as the water is there mixed with fresher water from the
South. The River La Plata sends out enormous quantities of fresh
water into the ocean. Most of this goes northward, on account of
the earth's rotation; the effect of this is, of course, to
deflect the currents of the southern hemisphere to the left, and
those of the northern hemisphere to the right. Besides the water
from the River La Plata, there is a current flowing northward
along the coast of Patagonia&mdash;namely, the Falkland Current.
Like the Benguela Current, it brings water with lower salinities
than those of the waters farther north; therefore, in proportion
as the salt water of the Brazil Current is mixed with the water
from the River La Plata and the Falkland Current, its salinity
decreases. These various conditions give the explanation of the
distribution of salinity and temperature that is seen in the
chart.</p>
<p>Between the two long lines of section there is a distance of
between ten and fifteen degrees of latitude. There is, therefore,
a considerable difference in temperature. In the southern section
the average surface temperature at Stations 1 to 26 (June 17 to
July 17) was 17.9&deg; C.; in the northern section at Stations 36
to 60 (July 26 to August 19) it was 21.6&deg; C. There was thus a
difference of 3.7&deg; C. If all the stations had been taken
simultaneously, the difference would have been somewhat greater;
the northern section was, of course, taken later in the winter,
and the temperatures were therefore proportionally lower than in
the southern section. The difference corresponds fairly
accurately with that which Kr&uuml;mmel has calculated from
previous observations.</p>
<p>We must now look at the conditions below the surface in that
part of the South Atlantic which was investigated by the
<i>Fram</i> Expedition.</p>
<p>The observations show in the first place that both
temperatures and salinities at every one of the stations give the
same values from the surface downward to somewhere between 75 and
150 metres (40.8 and 81.7 fathoms). This equalization of
temperature and salinity is due to the vertical currents produced
by cooling in winter; we shall return to it later. But below
these depths the temperatures and salinities decrease rather
rapidly for some distance.</p>
<p>The conditions of temperature at 400 metres (218 fathoms)
below the surface are shown in the next little chart. This chart
is based on the <i>Fram</i> Expedition, and, as regards the other
parts of the ocean, on Schott's comparison of the results of
previous expeditions. It will be seen that the <i>Fram</i>'s
observations agree very well with previous soundings, but are
much more detailed.</p>
<p>The chart shows clearly that it is much warmer at 400 metres
(218 fathoms) in the central part of the South Atlantic than
either farther north&mdash;nearer the Equator&mdash;or farther
south. On the Equator there is a fairly large area where the
temperature is only 7&deg; or 8&deg; C. at 400 metres, whereas in
lats. 20&deg; to 30&deg; S. there are large regions where it is
above 12&deg; C.; sometimes above 13&deg; C., or even 14&deg; C.
South of lat. 30&deg; S. the temperature decreases again rapidly;
in the chart no lines are drawn for temperatures below 8&deg; C.,
as we have not sufficient observations to show the course of
these lines properly. But we know that the temperature at 400
metres sinks to about 0&deg; C. in the Antarctic Ocean.</p>

<br>
<small>FIG. 8.&mdash;TEMPERATURES (CENTIGRADE) AT A DEPTH OF 400
METRES (218 FATHOMS).</small></p>
<br>
<p>At these depths, then, we find the warmest water within the
region investigated by the <i>Fram</i>. If we now compare the
distribution of temperature at 400 metres with the chart of
currents in the South Atlantic, we see that the warm region lies
in the centre of the great circulation of which mention was made
above. We see that there are high temperatures on the left-hand
side of the currents, and low on the right-hand side. This,
again, is an effect of the earth's rotation, for the high
temperatures mean as a rule that the water is comparatively
light, and the low that it is comparatively heavy. Now, the
effect of the earth's rotation in the southern hemisphere is that
the light (warm) water from above is forced somewhat down on the
left-hand side of the current, and that the heavy (cold) water
from below is raised somewhat. In the northern hemisphere the
contrary is the case. This explains the cold water at a depth of
400 metres on the Equator; it also explains the fact that the
water immediately off the coasts of Africa and South America is
considerably colder than farther out in the ocean. We now have
data for studying the relation between the currents and the
distribution of warmth in the volumes of water in a way which
affords valuable information as to the movements themselves. The
material collected by the <i>Fram</i> will doubtless be of
considerable importance in this way when it has been finally
worked out.</p>
<p>Below 400 metres (218 fathoms) the temperature further
decreases everywhere in the South Atlantic, at first rapidly to a
depth between 500 and 1,000 metres (272.5 and 545 fathoms),
afterwards very slowly. It is possible, however, that at the
greatest depths it rises a little again, but this will only be a
question of hundredths, or, in any case, very few tenths of a
degree.</p>
<p>It is known from previous investigations in the South
Atlantic, that the waters at the greatest depths, several
thousand metres below the surface, have a temperature of between
0&deg; and 3&deg; C. Along the whole Atlantic, from the extreme
north (near Iceland) to the extreme south, there runs a ridge
about half-way between Europe and Africa on the one side, and the
two American continents on the other. A little to the north of
the Equator there is a slight elevation across the ocean floor
between South America and Africa. Farther south (between lats.
25&deg; and 35&deg; S.) another irregular ridge runs across
between these continents. We therefore have four deep regions in
the South Atlantic, two on the west (the Brazilian Deep and the
Argentine Deep) and two on the east (the West African Deep and
the South African Deep). Now it has been found that the "bottom
water" in these great deeps&mdash;the bottom lies more than 5,000
metres (2,725 fathoms) below the surface&mdash;is not always the
same. In the two western deeps, off South America, the
temperature is only a little above 0&deg; C. We find about the
same temperatures in the South African Deep, and farther eastward
in a belt that is continued round the whole earth. To the south,
between this belt and Antarctica, the temperature of the great
deeps is much lower, below 0&deg; C. But in the West African Deep
the temperature is about 2&deg; C. higher; we find there the same
temperatures of between 2&deg; and 2.5&deg; C. as are found
everywhere in the deepest parts of the North Atlantic. The
explanation of this must be that the bottom water in the western
part of the South Atlantic comes from the south, while in the
north-eastern part it comes from the north. This is connected
with the earth's rotation, which has a tendency to deflect
currents to the left in the southern hemisphere. The bottom water
coming from the south goes to the left&mdash;that is, to the
South American side; that which comes from the north also goes to
the left&mdash;that is, to the African side.</p>
<p>The salinity also decreases from the surface downward to 600
to 800 metres (about 300 to 400 fathoms), where it is only a
little over 34 per mille, but under 34.5 per mille; lower down it
rises to about 34.7 per mille in the bottom water that comes from
the south, and to about 34.9 per mille in that which comes from
the North Atlantic.</p>
<p>We mentioned that the Benguela Current is colder and less salt
at the surface than the Brazil Current. The same thing is found
in those parts of the currents that lie below the surface. This
is clearly shown in Fig. 9, which gives the distribution of
temperature at Station 32 in the Benguela Current, and at Station
60 in the Brazil Current; at the various depths down to 500
metres (272.5 fathoms) it was between 5&deg; and 7&deg; C. colder
in the former than in the latter. Deeper down the difference
becomes less, and at 1,000 metres (545 fathoms) there was only a
difference of one or two tenths of a degree.</p>

<br>
<p>Fig. 10 shows a corresponding difference in salinities; in the
first 200 metres below the surface the water was about 1 per
mille more saline in the Brazil Current than in the Benguela
Current. Both these currents are confined to the upper waters;
the former probably goes down to a depth of about 1,000 metres
(545 fathoms), while the latter does not reach a depth of much
more than 500 metres. Below the two currents the conditions are
fairly homogeneous, and there is no difference worth mentioning
in the salinities.</p>
<p>The conditions between the surface and a depth of 1,000 metres
along the two main lines of course are clearly shown in the two
sections (Figs. 11 and l2). In these the isotherms for every
second degree are drawn in broken lines. Lines connecting points
with the same salinity (isohalins) are drawn unbroken, and, in
addition, salinities above 35 per mille are shown by shading.

To understand the sections rightly it must be borne in mind that
the vertical scale is 2,000 times greater than the

CURRENT, JULY 22, 1911), AND AT STATION 60 (IN THE BRAZIL
CURRENT, AUGUST 19, 1911).</small></p>
<br>
<p>Many of the conditions we have already mentioned are clearly
apparent in the sections: the small variations between the
surface and a depth of about 100 metres at each station; the
decrease of temperature and salinity as the depth increases; the
high values both of temperature and salinity in the western part
as compared with the eastern. We see from the sections how nearly
the isotherms and isohalins follow each other. Thus, where the
temperature is 12&deg; C., the water almost invariably has a
salinity very near 35 per mille. This water at 12&deg; C., with a
salinity of 35 per mille, is found in the western part of the
area (in the Brazil Current) at a depth of 500 to 600 metres, but
in the eastern part (in the Benguela Current) no deeper than 200
to 250 metres (109 to 136 fathoms).</p>
<p>We see further in both sections, and especially in the
southern one, that the isotherms and isohalins often have an
undulating course, since the conditions at one station may be
different from those at the neighbouring stations. To point to
one or two examples: at Station 19 the water a few hundred metres
down was comparatively warm; it was, for instance, 12&deg; C. at
about 470 metres (256 fathoms) at this station; while the same
temperature was found at about 340 metres (185 fathoms) at both
the neighbouring stations, 18 and 20. At Station 2 it was
relatively cold, as cold as it was a few hundred metres deeper
down at Stations 1 and 3.</p>
<p>These undulating curves of the isotherms and isohalins are
familiar to us in the Norwegian Sea, where they have been shown
in most sections taken in recent years. They may be explained in
more than one way. They may be due to actual waves, which are
transmitted through the central waters of the sea. Many things go
to show that such waves may actually occur far below the surface,
in which case they must attain great dimensions; they must,
indeed, be more than 100 metres high at times, and
yet&mdash;fortunately&mdash;they are not felt on the surface. In
the Norwegian Sea we have frequently found these wave-like rises
and falls. Or the curves may be due to differences in the
rapidity and direction of the currents. Here the earth's rotation
comes into play, since, as mentioned above, it causes zones of
water to be depressed on one side and raised on the other; and
the degree of force with which this takes place is dependent on
the rapidity of the current and on the geographical latitude. The
effect is slight in the tropics, but great in high latitudes.
This, so far as it goes, agrees with the fact that the curves of
the isotherms and isohalins are more marked in the more southerly

<br>
<p>But the probability is that the curves are due to the
formation of eddies in the currents. In an eddy the light and
warm water will be depressed to greater depths if the eddy goes
contrary to the hands of a clock and is situated in the southern
hemisphere. We appear to have such an eddy around Station 19, for
example. Around Station 2 an eddy appears to be going the other
way; that is, the same way as the hands of a clock. On the chart
of currents we have indicated some of these eddies from the
observations of the distribution of salinity and temperature made
by the <i>Fram</i> Expedition.</p>
<p>While this, then, is the probable explanation of the
irregularities shown by the lines of the sections, it is not
impossible that they may be due to other conditions, such as, for
instance, the submarine waves alluded to above. Another
possibility is that they may be a consequence of variations in
the rapidity of the current, produced, for instance, by wind. The
periodical variations caused by the tides will hardly be an
adequate explanation of what happens here, although during Murray
and Hjort's Atlantic Expedition in the <i>Michael Sars</i> (in
1910), and recently during Nansen's voyage to the Arctic Ocean in
the <i>Veslem&ouml;y</i> (in 1912), the existence of tidal
currents in the open ocean was proved. It may be hoped that the
further examination of the <i>Fram</i> material will make these
matters clearer. But however this may be, it is interesting to
establish the fact that in so great and deep an ocean as the
South Atlantic very considerable variations of this kind may
occur between points which lie near together and in the same
current.</p>
<p>As we have already mentioned in passing, the observations show
that the same temperatures and salinities as are found at the
surface are continued downward almost unchanged to a depth of
between 75 and 150 metres; on an average it is about 100 metres.
This is a typical winter condition, and is due to the vertical
circulation already mentioned, which is caused by the surface
water being cooled in winter, thus becoming heavier than the
water below, so that it must sink and give place to lighter water
which rises. In this way the upper zones of water become mixed,
and acquire almost equal temperatures and salinities. It thus
appears that the vertical currents reached a depth of about 100
metres in July, 1911, in the central part of the South Atlantic.
This cooling of the water is a gain to the air, and what happens
is that not only the <i>surface</i> gives off warmth to the air,
but also the <i>sub-surface waters</i>, to as great a depth as is
reached by the vertical circulation. This makes it a question of
enormous values.</p>
<p>This state of things is clearly apparent in the sections,
where the isotherms and isohalins run vertically for some way
below the surface. It is also clearly seen when we draw the
curves of distribution of salinity and temperature at the
different stations, as we have done in the two diagrams for
Stations 32 and 60 (Fig. 9). The temperatures had fallen several
degrees at the surface at the time the <i>Fram</i>'s
investigations were made. And if we are to judge from the general
appearance of the station curves, and from the form they usually
assume in summer in these regions, we shall arrive at the
conclusion that the whole volume of water from the surface down
to a depth of 100 metres must be cooled on an average about
2&deg; C.</p>
<p>As already pointed out, a simple calculation gives the
following: if a cubic metre of water is cooled 1&deg; C., and the
whole quantity of warmth thus taken from the water is given to
the air, it will be sufficient to warm more than 3,000 cubic
metres of air 1&deg; C. A few figures will give an impression of
what this means. The region lying between lats. 15&deg; and
35&deg; S. and between South America and Africa&mdash;roughly
speaking, the region investigated by the <i>Fram</i>
Expedition&mdash;has an area of 13,000,000 square kilometres. We
may now assume that this part of the ocean gave off so much
warmth to the air that a zone of water 100 metres in depth was
thereby cooled on an average 2&deg; C. This zone of water weighs
about 1.5 trillion kilogrammes, and the quantity of warmth given
off thus corresponds to about 2.5 trillion great calories.</p>
<p>It has been calculated that the whole atmosphere of the earth
weighs 5.27 trillion kilogrammes, and it will require something
over 1 trillion great calories to warm the whole of this mass of
air 1&deg; C. From this it follows that the quantity of warmth
which, according to our calculation, is given off to the air from
that part of the South Atlantic lying between lats. 15&deg; and
35&deg; S., will be sufficient to warm the whole atmosphere of
the earth about 2&deg; C., and this is only a comparatively small
part of the ocean. These figures give one a powerful impression
of the important part played by the sea in relation to the air.
The sea stores up warmth when it absorbs the rays of the sun; it
gives off warmth again when the cold season comes. We may compare
it with earthenware stoves, which continue to warm our rooms long
after the fire in them has gone out. In a similar way the sea
keeps the earth warm long after summer has gone and the sun's
rays have lost their power.</p>
<p>Now it is a familiar fact that the average temperature of the
air for the whole year is a little lower than that of the sea; in
winter it is, as a rule, considerably lower. The sea endeavours
to raise the temperature of the air; therefore, the warmer the
sea is, the higher the temperature of the air will rise. It is
not surprising, then, that after several years' investigations in
the Norwegian Sea we have found that the winter in Northern
Europe is milder than usual when the water of the Norwegian Sea
contains more than the average amount of warmth. This is
perfectly natural. But we ought now to be able to go a step
farther and say beforehand whether the winter air will be warmer
or colder than the normal after determining the amount of warmth
in the sea.</p>
<p>It has thus been shown that the amount of warmth in that part
of the ocean which we call the Norwegian Sea varies from year to
year. It was shown by the Atlantic Expedition of the <i>Michael
Sars</i> in 1910 that the central part of the North Atlantic was
considerably colder in 1910 than in 1873, when the
<i>Challenger</i> Expedition made investigations there; but the
temperatures in 1910 were about the same as those of 1876, when
the <i>Challenger</i> was on her way back to England.</p>

OF THE "CHALLENGER'S" STATIONS, TO THE SOUTH OF THE SOUTH
EQUATORIAL CURRENT.</small></p>
<br>
<p>We can now make similar comparisons as regards the South
Atlantic. In 1876 the <i>Challenger</i> took a number of stations
in about the same region as was investigated by the <i>Fram</i>.
The <i>Challenger</i>'s Station 339 at the end of March, 1876,
lies near the point where the <i>Fram</i>'s Station 44 was taken
at the beginning of August, 1911. Both these stations lay in
about lat. 17.5&deg; S., approximately half-way between Africa
and South America&mdash;that is, in the region where a relatively
slack current runs westward, to the south of the South Equatorial
Current. We can note the difference in Fig. 13, which shows the
distribution of temperature at the two stations. The
<i>Challenger</i>'s station was taken during the autumn and the
<i>Fram</i>'s during the winter. It was therefore over 3&deg; C.
warmer at the surface in March, 1876, than in August, 1911. The
curve for the <i>Challenger</i> station shows the usual
distribution of temperature immediately below the surface in
summer; the temperature falls constantly from the surface
downward. At the <i>Fram</i>'s station we see the typical winter
conditions; we there find the same temperature from the surface
to a depth of 100 metres, on account of cooling and vertical
circulation. In summer, at the beginning of the year 1911, the
temperature curve for the <i>Fram</i>'s station would have taken
about the same form as the other curve; but it would have shown
higher temperatures, as it does in the deeper zones, from 100
metres down to about 500 metres. For we see that in these zones
it was throughout 1&deg; C. or so warmer in 1911 than in 1876;
that is to say, there was a much greater store of warmth in this
part of the ocean in 1911 than in 1876. May not the result of
this have been that the air in this region, and also in the east
of South America and the west of Africa, was warmer during the
winter of 1911 than during that of 1876? We have not sufficient
data to be able to say with certainty whether this difference in
the amount of warmth in the two years applied generally to the
whole ocean, or only to that part which surrounds the position of
the station; but if it was general, we ought probably to be able
to find a corresponding difference in the climate of the
neighbouring regions. Between 500 and 800 metres (272 and 486
fathoms) the temperatures were exactly the same in both years,
and at 900 and 1,000 metres (490 and 545 fathoms) there was only
a difference of two or three tenths of a degree. In these deeper
parts of the ocean the conditions are probably very similar; we
have there no variations worth mentioning, because the warming of
the surface and sub-surface waters by the sun has no effect
there, unless, indeed, the currents at these depths may vary so
much that there may be a warm current one year and a cold one
another year. But this is improbable out in the middle of the
ocean.</p>

<small>FIG. 14.&mdash;TEMPERATURES AT ONE OF THE "FRAM'S" AND ONE
OF THE "VALDIVIA'S" STATIONS, IN THE BENGUELA
CURRENT.</small></p>
<br>
<p>In the neighbourhood of the African coast, on the other hand,
it looks as if there may be considerable variations even in the
deeper zones below 500 metres (272 fathoms). During the
<i>Valdivia</i> Expedition in 1898 a station (No. 82) was taken
in the Benguela Current in the middle of October, not far from
the point at which the <i>Fram</i>'s Station 31 lay. The
temperature curves from here show that it was much warmer (over
1.5&deg; C.) in 1898 than in 1911 in the zones between 500 and
800 metres (272 and 486 fathoms). Probably the currents may vary
considerably here. But in the upper waters of the Benguela
Current itself, from the surface down to 150 metres, it was
considerably warmer in 1911 than in 1898; this difference
corresponds to that which we found in the previous comparison of
the <i>Challenger</i>'s and <i>Fram</i>'s stations of 1876 and
1911. Between 200 and 400 metres (109 and 218 fathoms) there was
no difference between 1898 and 1911; nor was there at 1,000
metres (545 fathoms).</p>
<p>In 1906 some investigations of the eastern part of the South
Atlantic were conducted by the <i>Planet</i>. In the middle of
March a station was taken (No. 25) not far from St. Helena and in
the neighbourhood of the <i>Fram</i>'s Station 39, at the end of
July, 1911. Here, also, we find great variations; it was much
warmer in 1911 than in 1906, apart from the winter cooling by
vertical circulation of the sub-surface waters. At a depth of
only 100 metres (54.5 fathoms) it was 2&deg; C. warmer in 1911
than in 1906; at 400 metres (218 fathoms) the difference was over
1&deg;, and even at 800 metres (486 fathoms) it was about
0.75&deg; C. warmer in 1911 than in 1906. At 1,000 metres (545
fathoms) the difference was only 0.3&deg;.</p>
<p>From the <i>Planet</i>'s station we also have problems of
salinity, determined by modern methods. It appears that the
salinities at the <i>Planet</i> station, in any case to a depth
of 400 metres, were lower, and in part much lower, than those of
the <i>Fram</i> Expedition. At 100 metres the difference was even
greater than 0.5 per mille; this is a great deal in the same
region of open sea. Now, it must be remembered that the current
in the neighbourhood of St. Helena may be regarded as a
continuation of the Benguela Current, which comes from the south
and has relatively low salinities. It looks, therefore, as if
there were yearly variations of salinity in these regions. This
may either be due to corresponding variations in the Benguela
Current&mdash;partly because the relation between precipitation
and evaporation may vary in different years, and partly because
there may be variations in the acquisition of less saline water
from the Antarctic Ocean. Or it may be due to the Benguela
Current in the neighbourhood of St. Helena having a larger
admixture of the warm and salt water to the west of it in one
year than in another. In either case we may expect a relatively
low salinity (as in 1906 as compared with 1911) to be accompanied
by a relatively low temperature, such as we have found by a
comparison of the <i>Planet</i>'s observations with those of the
<i>Fram</i>.</p>

<br>
<p>We require a larger and more complete material for comparison;
but even that which is here referred to shows that there may be
considerable yearly variations both in the important, relatively
cold Benguela Current, and in the currents in other parts of the
South Atlantic. It is a substantial result of the observations
made on the <i>Fram</i>'s voyage that they give us an idea of
great annual variations in so important a region as the South
Atlantic Ocean. When the whole material has been further examined
it will be seen whether it may also contribute to an
understanding of the climatic conditions of the nearest
countries, where there is a large population, and where, in
consequence, a more accurate knowledge of the variations of
climate will have more than a mere scientific interest.</p>
