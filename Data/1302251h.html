  <h2><a id="pt1"
     name="pt1"></a>PART I. -- THE PROTECTING ANCESTORS</h2>

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I.<br>
  The Malignity of the Depraved Ming-shu Rears Its Offensive Head</h2>

  <p class="first">As Kai Lung turned off the dusty earth road and took the
  woodland path that led to his small but seemly cottage on the higher slope,
  his exultant heart rose up in song. His quest, indeed, had not been prolific
  of success, and he was returning with a sleeve as destitute of silver taels
  as when he had first set out, but the peach tree about his gate would greet
  him with a thousand perfumed messages of welcome, and standing expectant at
  the door he would perchance presently espy the gracefully outlined form of
  Hwa-mei, once called the Golden Mouse.</p>

  <p class="verse">"As I climb the precipitous hillside," [he chanted],<br>
  "My thoughts persistently dwell on the one who awaits my coming;<br>
  Though her image has never been wholly absent from my mind,<br>
  For our affections are as the two ends of a stretching cable-- united by what
  divides them;<br>
  And harmony prevails.<br>
  Each sunrise renews the pearly splendour of her delicate being;<br>
  And floating weed recalls her abundant hair.<br>
  In the slender willows of the Yengtse valley I see her silken eye-lashes,<br>
  And the faint tint of the waving moon-flower tells of her jade-rivalled
  cheek.<br>
  Where is the exactitude of her matchless perfection--"</p><br>

  <p>"There is a time to speak in hyperbole and a time to frame words to the
  limit of a narrow edge," interposed a contentious voice and Shen Hing, an
  elderly neighbour, appeared in the way. "What manner of man are you, Kai
  Lung, or does some alien Force possess you that you should reveal this
  instability of mind on the very threshold of misfortune?"</p>

  <p>"Greetings, estimable wood-cutter," replied Kai Lung, who knew the other's
  morose habit; "yet wherefore should despondency arise? It is true that the
  outcome of my venture has been concave in the extreme, but, whatever befall,
  the produce of a single field will serve our winter need; while now the air
  is filled with gladness and the song of insects, and, shortly, Hwa-mei will
  discern me on the homeward track and come hurriedly to meet me with a cup of
  water in her hand. How, then, can heaviness prevail?"</p>

  <p>At this, Shen Hing turned half aside, under the pretext that he required
  to spit, but he coughed twice before he could recompose his voice.</p>

  <p>"Whence are you, amiable Kai Lung?" he asked with unaccustomed mildness;
  "and have you of late had speech with none?"</p>

  <p>"I am, last of all, from Shun, which lies among the Seven Water-heads,"
  was the reply. "Thinking to shorten the path of my return, I chose the pass
  known as the Locust's Leap, and from this cause I have encountered few. Haply
  you have some gratifying tidings that you would impart--yet should not these
  await another's telling, when seated around our own domestic hearth?"</p>

  <p>"Haply," replied Shen Hing, with the same evasive bearing, "but there is a
  fall no less than a rise to every tide, and is it not further said that of
  three words that reach our ears two will be evil?"</p>

  <p>"Does famine then menace the province?" demanded Kai Lung uneasily.</p>

  <p>"There is every assurance of an abundant harvest, and already the sound of
  many blades being whetted is not unknown to us."</p>

  <p>"It can scarcely be that the wells are failing our community again? Fill
  in the essential detail of your shadowy warning, O dubious Shen Hing, for I
  am eager to resume my homeward way, whatever privation threatens."</p>

  <p>"It is better to come empty handed than to be the bearer of ill news,"
  answered the sombre woodman, "but since you lay the burden on my head, it is
  necessary that you should turn your impatient feet aside to ascend yonder
  slight incline," and he pointed to a rocky crag that rose above the trees.
  "From this height, minstrel, now bend your discriminating gaze a few li to
  the west and then declare what there attracts your notice."</p>

  <p>"That is the direction in which my meagre hut is placed," admitted Kai
  Lung, after he had searched the distance long and anxiously, "but, although
  the landmarks are familiar, that which I most look for eludes my mediocre
  eyes. It must be that the setting sun--"</p>

  <p>"Even a magician cannot see the thing that is not there," replied Shen
  Hing meaningly. "Doubtless your nimble-witted mind will now be suitably
  arranged for what is to follow."</p>

  <p>"Say on," adjured Kai Lung, taking a firmer hold upon the inner fibre of
  his self control. "If it should be more than an ordinary person can
  reasonably bear, I call upon the shades of all my virtuous ancestors to rally
  to my aid."</p>

  <p>"Had but one of them put in a appearance a week ago, it might have served
  you better, for, as it is truly written, 'A single humble friend with rice
  when you are hungry is better than fifteen influential kinsmen coming to a
  feast,' " retorted Shen Hing. "Hear my lamentable word, however. It has for
  some time been rumoured that the banners of insurrection were being trimmed
  and the spears of revolt made ready."</p>

  <p>"There was a whisper trickling through the land when I set forth,"
  murmured Kai Lung. "But in this sequestered region, surely--"</p>

  <p>"The trickle meanwhile grew into a swiftly moving stream, although the
  torrent seemed as though it would spare our peaceful valley. Like a faint
  echo from some far-off contest we heard that the standard of the Avenging
  Knife had been definitely raised and all men were being pressed into this
  scale or that of the contending causes. . . . High among the rebel council
  stood one who had, it is said, suffered an indignity at your requiting hand
  in the days gone by--Ming-shu his forbidding name."</p>

  <p>"Ming-shu!" exclaimed Kai Lung, falling back a step before the ill-omened
  menace of that malignant shadow. "Can it be that the enmity of the inscriber
  of the Mandarin's spoken word has pursued me to this retreat?"</p>

  <p>"It is, then, even as men told," declared Shen Hing, with no attempt to
  forego an overhanging bitterness, "and you, Kai Lung, whom we received in
  friendship, have brought this disaster to our doors. Could demons have done
  more?"</p>

  <p>"Speak freely," invoked Kai Lung, averting his face, "and do not seek to
  spare this one's excessive self-reproach. What next occurred?"</p>

  <p>"We of our settlement are a peaceful race, neither vainglorious nor
  trained to the use of arms, and the opposing camps of warriors had so far
  passed us by, going either on the Eastern or the Western Route and none
  turning aside. But in a misbegotten moment Ming-shu fell under a deep
  depression while in his tent at no great space away, and one newly of his
  band, thinking to disclose a fount of gladness, spoke of your admitted
  capacity as a narrator of imagined tales, with a special reference to the
  serviceable way in which the aptitude had extricated you from a variety of
  unpleasant transactions in the past."</p>

  <p>"That would undoubtedly refresh the wells of Ming-shu's memory," remarked
  Kai Lung. "How did he testify the fullness of his joy?"</p>

  <p>"It is related that, when those who stood outside heard the grinding of
  his ill assorted teeth, the rumour spread that the river banks were giving
  way. At a later period the clay-souled outlaw was seen to rub his offensive
  hands pleasurably together and heard to remark that there is undoubtedly a
  celestial influence that moulds our ultimate destinies even though we
  ourselves may appear to trim the edges somewhat. He then directed a chosen
  company of his repulsive guard to surprise and surround our dwellings and to
  bring you a bound captive to his feet."</p>

  <p>"Alas!" exclaimed Kai Lung. "It would have been more in keeping with the
  classical tradition that they should have taken me, rather than that others
  must suffer in my stead."</p>

  <p>"There can be no two opinions on that score," replied the scrupulous Shen
  Hing, "but a literary aphorism makes a poor defense against a suddenly
  propelled battle axe, and before mutual politeness was restored a score of
  our tribe had succumbed to the force of the opposing argument. Then, on the
  plea that a sincere reconciliation demanded the interchange of gifts, they
  took whatever we possessed, beat us heavily about the head and body with
  clubs in return, and departed, after cutting down your orchard and setting
  fire to your very inflammably constructed hut, in order, as their leader
  courteously expressed it, 'to lighten the path of your return.'"</p>

  <p>"But she--Hwa-mei," urged Kai Lung thickly. "Speak to a point now that the
  moment must be faced--the cord is at my heart."</p>

  <p>"In that you are well matched, for another was about her neck when she
  went forth," replied Shen Hing concisely. "Thus, Ming-shu may be said to
  possess a double hold upon your destiny."</p>

  <p>"And thereafter? She--?"</p>

  <p>"Why, as to that, the outlook is obscure. But a brigand with whom I
  conversed--albeit one-sidedly, he standing upon this person's prostrate form
  meanwhile--boasted of the exploit. Hwa-mei would seem to be a lure by which
  it is hoped to attract some high official's shifting allegiance to the rebel
  cause, she having held a certain sway upon him in the past."</p>

  <p>"The Mandarin Shan Tien--now a provincial governor!" exclaimed Kai Lung.
  "Thus our ancient strife asserts itself again, though the angles ever change.
  But she lives--at least that is assured."</p>

  <p>"She lives," agreed Shen Hing dispassionately, "but so likewise does
  Ming-shu. If he was your avowed enemy, minstrel, you did wrong to spare him
  in the past, for 'If you leave the stricken bull his horns, he will yet
  contrive to gore you.'"</p>

  <p>"It is no less written, 'The malice of the unworthy is more to be prized
  than an illuminated vellum,'" replied Kai Lung. "Furthermore, the ultimate
  account has not yet been cast. In which direction did Ming-shu's force
  proceed, and how long are they gone?"</p>

  <p>"One who overlooked their camp spoke of them as marching to the west, and
  for three days now have we been free of their corroding presence. That being
  so, the more valiant among us are venturing down from about the treetops, and
  tomorrow life will begin afresh, doubtless as before. Have no fear therefore,
  storyteller; Ming-shu will not return."</p>

  <p>"It is on that very issue that I am troubled," was Kai Lung's doubtful
  answer. "Ming-shu may still return."</p>

  <p>"Then at least do not show it, for we are all in the same plight," urged
  the woodman. "Tomorrow we assemble to repair the broken walls and fences, so
  that in the association of our numbers you may gain assurance."</p>

  <p>"The spirit you display is admittedly contagious," agreed Kai Lung. "In
  the meanwhile, I will seek my devastated ruin to see if haply anything
  remains. There was a trivial store of some few bars of silver hidden about
  the roof. Should that hope fail, I am no worse off than he who possesses
  nothing."</p>

  <p>"I will accompany and sustain you, neighbour," declared Shen Hing more
  cheerfully. "In sudden fortune, whether good or bad, men become as
  brothers."</p>

  <p>"Do so if you feel you must," replied Kai Lung, "though I would rather be
  alone. But, in any case, I will do the actual searching--it would be the
  reverse of hospitable to set you to a task."</p>

  <p>When they reached the ruin of his once befitting home, Kai Lung could not
  forbear an emotion of despair, but he indicated to Shen Hing how that one
  should stand a reasonable distance away while he himself sought among the
  ashes.</p>

  <p>"A steady five cash a day is better than the prospect of a fortune." Shen
  Hing busied himself looking for earth-nuts, but in spite of the apt proverb
  his sombre look returned.</p>

  <p>"Even this slender chance has faded," reported Kai Lung at length,
  approaching Shen Hing again. "Nothing remains, and I must now adventure forth
  on an untried way with necessity alone to be my guide. Farewell,
  compassionate Shen Hing."</p>

  <p>"But what new vagary is here?" exclaimed Shen Hing, desisting from his
  search. "Is it not your purpose to join in the toil of restoring our
  settlement, when we, in turn, will support you in the speedy raising of your
  fallen roof?"</p>

  <p>"There is a greater need that calls me, and every day Hwa-mei turns her
  expectant eyes toward the path of rescue," replied Kai Lung.</p>

  <p>"Hwa-mei! But she is surrounded by a rebel guard in Ming-shu's camp, a
  hundred li or more away by now. Consider well, storyteller. It is very easy
  on an unknown road to put your foot into a trap or your head into a noose,
  but by patient industry one can safely earn enough to replace a wife with a
  few successful harvests."</p>

  <p>"When this one lay captive in Ming-shu's power, she whom you would so
  readily forsake did not weigh the hazards of snare or rope with an appraising
  eye, but came hastening forward, offering life itself in two outstretched
  hands. Would a dog do less than follow now?"</p>

  <p>"That is as it may be, and I have certainly heard some account of the
  affair at various times," replied Shen Hing craftily, for he well knew that
  Kai Lung's reciting voice would lighten the task of each succeeding day. "But
  even a beggar will not cross a shaking bridge by night, and how are you, who
  have neither gold wherewith to purchase justice nor force by which to compel
  it, to out-do the truculent Ming-shu, armed at every point?"</p>

  <p>"I have sandals for my feet, a well-tried staff between my hands, a story
  on my lips, and the divine assurance that integrity will in the end prevail,"
  was Kai Lung's modest boast. "What, therefore, can I lack?"</p>

  <p>" 'In the end'?" repeated Shen Hing darkly. "Admittedly. But an ordinary
  person inclines to something less ambitious provided it can be relied upon
  more toward the middle. You are one who is prone to resort to analogies and
  signs, Kai Lung, to guide you in the emergencies of life. How can you then
  justify a journey entered upon so suddenly and without reference to the
  omens?"</p>

  <p>"He who moves toward the light has no need of the glow of joss-sticks,"
  replied Kai Lung, indicating the brightness that still lingered in the sky.
  "The portent will not fail."</p>

  <p>"It is certainly a point to be noted," confessed Shen Hing, "and I cannot
  altogether expect to dissuade you in the circumstances. But do not overlook
  the fact that the sun has already set and nothing but dark and forbidding
  clouds now fill the heavens."</p>

  <p>"We can see only the clouds, but the clouds can see the sun," was the
  confident reply. "Success is a matter of luck, but every man obeys his
  destiny."</p>

  <p>With this inspired pronouncement, Kai Lung turned his back upon the ruin
  of his unassuming home and set out again, alone and destitute, upon an
  unknown path. Shen Hing pressed into his sleeve the few inferior nuts that he
  had laboriously collected, but he did not offer to accompany the storyteller
  on his way. Indeed, as soon as he was reasonably sure that he was free from
  interruption, the discriminating wood-cutter began to search the ashes on his
  own account, to see if haply there was not something of value that Kai Lung
  had perchance overlooked.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II.<br>
  The Difficult Progression of the<br>
  Virtuous Kai Lung Assumes a Concrete Form</h2>

  <p class="first">It was Kai Lung's habit, as he approached any spot where it
  seemed as though his mat might be profitably unrolled, to beat upon a small
  wooden drum and even to discharge an occasional firework, so that the
  leisurely and indulgent should have no excuse for avoiding his entertainment.
  As darkness was fast approaching when he reached the village of Ching, it
  would have been prudent first of all to obtain shelter for the night and a
  little rice to restore his failing powers, for three days had passed since
  the parting from Shen Hing, and with scarcely a pause Kai Lung had pressed
  relentlessly on toward the west, journeying through a barren upland waste
  where nothing to sustain life offered beyond the roots of herbs and a scanty
  toll of honey. But the rocky path that he had followed was scarcely less
  harsh and forbidding than the faces of those to whom the storyteller now
  spoke of food and shelter, with an assumed payment at some future time, and
  however ill-fitted he felt his attributes to be, he had no alternative but to
  retrace his faltering steps to the deserted open space and there to spread
  his mat and lift up his voice in the hope of enticing together one or two who
  would contribute even a few brass pieces to his bowl.</p>

  <p>When Kai Lung had beat upon his drum for as long as it was prudent and had
  expended the last firecracker of his slender store, he looked around so that
  he might estimate what profit the enterprise held out and judge therefrom
  what variety of story would be adequate. To his gratified surprise, he now
  perceived that, so far from attracting only a meagre sprinkling of the idle
  and necessitous, about him stood a considerable throng, and persons of even
  so dignified a position as an official chair bearer and an assistant tax
  collector had not scrupled to draw near. At least two full strings of
  negotiable cash might be looked for, and Kai Lung brushed aside his hunger
  and fatigue as he resolved to justify so auspicious an occasion.</p>

  <p>"It is well said," he remarked with becoming humility, "that the more
  insignificant the flower the handsomer the bees that are attracted to it, and
  the truth of the observation is borne out by this distinguished gathering of
  influential noblemen all condescending to listen to the second rate elocution
  of so ill endowed a person as the one who is now speaking. Nevertheless, in
  order to start the matter on a satisfactory basis, attention is now drawn to
  this very inadequate collecting bowl. When even its lower depth is hidden
  beneath the impending shower of high-class currency, these deficient lips
  will be stimulated to recite the story of Ling Tso and the Golden Casket of
  the Lady Wu."</p>

  <p>For a few beats of time there was an impressive pause, which Kai Lung
  ascribed to a pleased anticipation of what was to follow, but no shower of
  coins ensued. Then a venerable person stood forth and raised a forbidding
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Refrain from this ineptitude and tell us the thing that we have come to
  hear," he remarked in an unappreciative voice. "Is it to be thought that
  persons of such importance as an official chair bearer and an assistant tax
  collector "--here he indicated the two, who assumed expressions of
  appropriate severity--"would bend their weighty ears to the painted
  insincerity of a fictitious tale?"</p>

  <p>"Yet wherein can offence be taken at the history of Ling Tso and the
  virtuous Lady Wu?" asked Kai Lung in pained surprise. "None the less, it is
  reasonably said that he who hires the carriage picks the road, and should
  another tale be indicated, this one will cheerfully endeavour to comply with
  the demand."</p>

  <p>"Alas," exclaimed the one who had constituted himself the leader of their
  voices, "can obliquity go further? Why should we who are assembled to hear
  what relief Ang-Liang can send us in our straits be withheld in this
  extraneous manner? Deliver your message competently, O townsman of Ang-Liang,
  so that we may quickly know."</p>

  <p>At this reversal of his hopes and all that it foreshadowed, Kai Lung
  suddenly felt the cords of his restraint give way, and for a discreditable
  moment he covered his face with his hands, lest his anguish should appear
  there.</p>

  <p>"It is very evident that an unfortunate misconception has arisen," he
  said, when he had recovered his inner possession. "The one before you has
  journeyed from the east, nor has he any part with the township of Ang-Liang,
  neither does he bear with him a message."</p>

  <p>"Then how arises it," demanded the foremost of the throng acrimoniously,
  "that you have come to this very spot, beating upon a wooden drum and bearing
  other signs of him whom we expect?"</p>

  <p>"I had sought this open space thinking to earn a narrow sufficiency of the
  means whereby to secure food and shelter before the darkness closes in,"
  replied Kai Lung freely. "My discreditable calling is that of a minstrel and
  a relater of imagined tales, my abject name being Lung, and Kai that of my
  offensive father's ill-conditioned Line. Being three days' journey from my
  bankrupt home, I have nothing but my own distressing voice and the charitable
  indulgence of your unsullied hearts to interpose between myself and various
  unpleasant ways of Passing Upward. To that end I admittedly beat upon this
  hollow drum and discharged an occasional cracker, as my harmless custom
  is."</p>

  <p>"Were it not possible to take a lenient view of the offence by reason of
  your being a stranger, it is difficult to say what crime you may not have
  committed," declared the spokesman with obtuse persistence. "As it is, it
  would be well that you should return to your own place without delay and
  avoid the boundaries of Ching in future. Justice may not close an eye twice
  in the same direction."</p>

  <p>"Nothing could be more agreeably expressed, and this one will not fail to
  profit by your broad-minded toleration," meekly replied Kai Lung. "Yet
  inexperienced wayfarers have been known to wander in a circle after nightfall
  and so to return to the point of their departure. To avoid this humiliating
  transgression, the one who is now striving to get away at the earliest
  possible moment will restrain his ardour until daybreak. In the meanwhile, to
  satisfy your natural demand that he should justify the claim to be as he
  asserts, he will now relate the story of Wan and the Remarkable Shrub--a
  narrative which, while useful to ordinary persons as indicative of what may
  be reasonably expected in a variety of circumstances, does not impose so
  severe a strain upon the imagination as does the history of Ling Tso and the
  Golden Casket."</p>

  <p>"Any strain upon the imagination is capable of sympathetic adjustment,"
  put forward one of the circle, evidently desirous of sharing in some form of
  entertainment. "As regards the claim of the collecting bowl to which
  reference has been made--"</p>

  <p>"Cease, witling," interposed the leader in a tone of no-encouragement.
  "Having been despoiled by Ming-shu's insatiable horde, are we now to be
  beguiled into contributing to a strolling musician's scarcely less voracious
  bowl? Understand, mountebank, that by flood, fire, and famine, culminating in
  this last iniquity at the hands of a rebel band, our village is not only
  cashless but is already destitute of food and fuel for itself, so that we
  have even sent imploring messages to less deficient neighbours."</p>

  <p>"In that case, the historical legend of Wan and the Remarkable Shrub is
  exceptionally appropriate, conveying as it does the inspiring maxim that
  misfortune may be turned to a final gain, and indicating--on broad lines--how
  this desirable result may be attained."</p>

  <p>"A recital of that nature cannot be deemed to be merely light and
  indulgent," contended the one who had favoured the amusement, "and, indeed,
  may be regarded as a definite commercial asset. It is true that among us we
  have not the wherewithal to line even the bottom of the accomodating Kai
  Lung's unassuming bowl, but if a mat upon my misshapen sleeping bench should
  be judged an equivalent share--"</p>

  <p>"In the matter of your evening rice this person chances to have a
  superfluous portion of meat upon a skewer," remarked the official chair
  bearer. "Lean and unappetizing as it will doubtless prove, it is freely
  offered as a proportionate bestowal."</p>

  <p>"Meat of itself requires the savour of mixed herbs," interposed the
  assistant tax collector, not desirous of being outdone by others, "and in
  that respect this one will not prove lacking."</p>

  <p>"When the tide turns, it carries all before it," grumbled the head-man of
  the community, with a supine glance at the many who were pressing forward.
  "As regards tea to any reasonable amount, the name of Thang stands to that
  detail."</p>

  <p>"An onion to refresh your supple throat," came from another.</p>

  <p>"A little snuff to bring out the flavor of each dish"; "Look to Wei Ho,
  for mien paste to form a staple"; "A small dried fish, well steeped in oil";
  "The gratuitous shaving of your noble footsore limbs"--these and a variety of
  inspiring cries were raised on every side.</p>

  <p>"It is necessary to test silver on a block, but hospitality proclaims
  itself," replied Kai Lung agreeably. "This brings in the legendary tale of
  Wan and what befell him."</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>The Story of Wan and the Remarkable Shrub</em></p>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">The story of Wan and the Remarkable Shrub is commendable in
  that it shows how, under a beneficent scheme of government, such as that of
  our unapproachably enlightened Empire admittedly is, impartial justice will
  sooner or later be accomplished. When a contrary state of things seems to
  prevail, and the objectionable appear to triumph while the worthy are reduced
  to undignified expedients, it will generally be found that powerful
  demoniacal influences are at work or else that the retributive forces have
  been counter-balanced by an unfortunate conjunction of omens acting on the
  lives of those concerned. If neither of these causes is responsible, it may
  be that a usurpatory and unauthorized dynasty has secured the sacred dragon
  throne (a not unusual occurrence in our distinguished history), and virtue is
  thereby for a time superseded from its function; or, possibly, a closer
  scrutiny will reveal that those whom we had hitherto regarded as tending
  toward one extreme were not in reality such as we deemed them to be, and that
  the destinies meted out to them were therefore both adequate and just. Thus,
  whatever happens, it is always more prudent to assume that the integrities
  have been suitably maintained all round and that the inspired system
  initiated by the Sages ten thousand years ago continues even today to
  enshrine the highest wisdom of mankind and is yet administered by the most
  scrupulous body of officials in what is still the best possible among the
  nations of the earth.</p>

  <p>For this reason the story of Wan and his associates, badly told and
  commonplace as it must inevitably sound when narrated by this incompetent
  person, is appropriate for the mental nourishment of the young and
  impressionable, while even the ill intentioned and austere may be discreetly
  influenced along a desired path by its opportune recital at convenient
  intervals.</p>

  <p>At a period so remote that it would be impious to doubt whatever happened
  then, a venerable and prosperous philosopher, Ah-shoo by name, dwelt at the
  foot of a mountain in a distant province. His outward life was simple but
  reserved, and although he spent large sums of money on fireworks and other
  forms of charity, he often professed his indifference to wealth and position.
  Yet it must not be supposed that Ah-shoo was unmindful of the essentials, for
  upon it being courteously pointed out to him, by a well disposed neighbour
  who had many daughters of his own, that in failing to provide a reliable
  posterity he was incurring a grave risk of starvation in the Upper World, he
  expressed a seemly regret for the oversight and at once arranged to marry an
  elderly person who chanced at the time to be returning his purified wearing
  apparel. It was to this incident that the one with whom this related story is
  chiefly concerned owned his existence, and when the philosopher's attention
  was diverted to the occurrence, he bestowed on him the name of Wan, thereby
  indicating that he was born toward the evening of his begetter's life, and
  also conveying the implication that the achievement was one that could
  scarcely be expected to be repeated. On this point he was undoubtedly
  inspired.</p>

  <p>When Wan reached the age of manhood, the philosopher abruptly Passed Above
  without any interval of preparation. It had been his custom to engage Wan in
  philosophical discussion at the close of each day, and on this occasion he
  was contrasting the system of Ka-ping, who maintained that the world has
  suspended from a powerful fibrous rope, with that of Ta-u, who contended that
  it was supported upon a substantial bamboo pole. With the clear insight of an
  original and discerning mind, Ah-shoo had already detected the fundamental
  weakness of both theories.</p>

  <p>"If the earth was indeed dependent on the flexible retention of an
  unstable cord, it is inevitable that, during the season of Much Wind, it must
  from time to time have been blown into a reversed position, with the
  distressing result that what was the east when we composed ourselves to sleep
  would be the west when we awoke from our slumber, to the confusion of all
  ordinary process of observation and the well-grounded annoyance of those who,
  being engaged upon a journey, found themselves compelled to return and set
  out again in the opposite direction. As there exists no tradition of this
  having ever happened, it is certain that the ingenious Ka-ping did not walk
  in step with the verities."</p>

  <p>"Then the system of the profound Ta-u is the one to be regarded?" inquired
  Wan respectfully.</p>

  <p>"'Because Hi is in the wrong, it does not automatically follow that Ho is
  necessarily right,'" quoted Ah-shoo, referring to the example of two
  celebrated astrologers who were equally involved in error. "The ill-conceived
  delusion of the obsolete Ta-u is no less open to logical disproval than the
  grotesque fallacy of the badly informed Ka-ping. If a rigid and unyielding
  staff of wood upheld the world it is obvious that when the ground became dry
  and crumbling the upper end of the pole would enlarge the socket in which it
  was embedded, and the earth, thus deprived of a firm and stable basis, would
  oscillate with every considerable movement upon its upper side. Even more
  disturbing would be the outcome of a season of continuous flood, such as our
  agreeable land frequently enjoys, for then, owing to the soft and pliant
  nature of the soil, and the ever increasing weight of the impending
  structure, the pole would continue to sink deeper and deeper into the mass,
  until at length it would protrude upon the upper side, when the earth,
  deprived of all support, would slide down the pole until it plunged into the
  impenetrable gloom of the Beneath-Parts."</p>

  <p>"Yet," suggested Wan with becoming deference, "if the point of the staff
  concerned should have been resourcefully embedded in a a formidable block of
  stone--?"</p>

  <p>"The system of the self-opinionated Ta-u contains no reference to any such
  block of stone," replied Ah-shoo coldly, for it was not wholly agreeable to
  his sense of the harmonies that the one who was his son should seek to supply
  Ta-u's deficiency. "Furthermore, the difficulty of hewing out the necessary
  incision for the head of the pole to fit into, in view of the hardness of the
  rock and the inverted position in which the workers must necessarily toil,
  would be insuperable. Consider well another time, O Wan, before you
  intervene. 'None but a nightingale should part his lips merely to emit
  sound.'"</p>

  <p>"Your indulgent censure will henceforth stimulate my powers of silence,"
  declared the dutiful Wan in a straightforward voice. "Otherwise it would have
  been my inopportune purpose to learn of your undoubted omniscience what
  actually does support the earth."</p>

  <p>"The inquiry is a natural one," replied Ah-shoo more genially, for it was
  a desire to set forth his own opinion on the subject that had led him to
  approach the problem, "and your instinct in referring it to me is judicious.
  The world is kept in its strict and inflexible position by--"</p>

  <p>Who having found a jewel lifts his voice to proclaim the fact, thereby
  inviting one and all to claim a share? Rather does he put an unassuming foot
  upon the spot and direct attention to the auspicious movements of a distant
  flock of birds or the like, until he can prudently stoop to secure what he
  has seen. Certainly, the analogy may not be exact at all its angles, but in
  any case Ah-shoo would have been well advised to speak with lowered voice. It
  is to be inferred that the philosopher did not make a paper boast when he
  spoke of possessing the fundamental secret of the earth's stability, but that
  the High Powers were unwilling, at that early stage of our civilization, for
  the device to become generally understood. Ah-shoo was therefore fated to
  suffer for his indiscretion, and this took the form of a general stagnation
  of the attributes, so that although he lingered for a further period before
  he Passed Above he was unable to express himself in a coherent form. Being
  deprived of the power of speech, he remembered, when too late, that he had
  neglected to initiate Wan into any way of applying his philosophical system
  to a remunerative end, while it so happened that his store of wealth was
  unusually low owing to an imprudently generous contribution to a scheme for
  permanently driving evil beings out of the neighbourhood by a serious of
  continuous explosions.</p>

  <p>It is no longer necessary to conceal the fact that throughout his life
  Ah-shoo had in reality played a somewhat two-faced part. In addition to being
  a profound philosopher and a polite observer of the forms he was, in secret,
  an experienced magician, and in that capacity he was able to transmute base
  matter into gold. For this purpose he kept a variety of coloured fluids in a
  shuttered recess of the wall, under a strict injunction. Having now a natural
  craving to assure Wan's future comfort, he endeavoured by a gesture to
  indicate this source of affluence, confident that the one in question would
  not fail to grasp the significance of anything brought to his notice at so
  precise a moment, and thus be led to test the properties of the liquids and
  in the end to discover their potency. Unfortunately, Ah-shoo's vigour was by
  this time unequal to the required strain and his inefficient hand could not
  raise itself higher than to point toward an inscribed tablet suspended at a
  lower level upon the wall. This chancing to be the delineation of the
  Virtues, warning the young against the pursuit of wealth, against trafficking
  with doubtful Forces, and so forth, Wan readily accepted the gesture as a
  final encouragement toward integrity on the part of an affectionate and
  pure-minded father, and dutifully prostrating himself, he specifically
  undertook to avoid the enticements described. It was in vain that the
  distracted Ah-shoo endeavoured to remove this impression and to indicate his
  meaning more exactly. His feeble limb was incapable of more highly sustained
  effort, and the more desperately he strove to point, the more persistently
  Wan kow-towed acquiescently and bound himself by an ever increasing array of
  oaths and penalties to shun the snare of riches and to avoid all connection
  with the forbidden. Finally, this inability to make himself understood
  engendered a fatal acridity within the magician's throat, so that, with an
  expression of scarcely veiled contempt on his usually benevolent features, he
  rolled from side to side several times in despair and then passed out into
  the Upper Region.</p>

  <p>It was not long before Wan began to experience an uncomfortable deficiency
  of taels. The more ordinary places of concealment were already familiar to
  his investigating thumb, but even the most detailed search failed to disclose
  Ah-shoo's expected hoard. When at length very little of the structural
  portion of the house remained intact, Wan was reluctantly compelled to admit
  that no such store existed.</p>

  <p>"It is certainly somewhat inconsiderate of the one to whom my very
  presence here is due, to have inculcated in me a contempt for riches and a
  fixed regard for the Virtues, and then to have Passed Away without making any
  adequate provision for maintaining the position," remarked Wan to the sharer
  of his inner chamber, as he abandoned his search as hopeless. "Tastes such as
  these are by no means easy to support."</p>

  <p>"Perchance," suggested Lan-yen, the one referred to, helpfully, "it was
  part of an ordered scheme, thereby to inspire a confidence in your own
  exertions."</p>

  <p>"The confidence inspired by the possession of a well-filled vault of
  silver will last an ordinary person a lifetime," replied Wan, with an entire
  absence of enthusiasm. "Further, the philosophical outfit, which so capably
  enables one to despise riches in the midst of affluence, seems to have
  overlooked any system of procuring them when destitution threatens."</p>

  <p>"Yet are there not other methods of enrichment?" persisted the
  well-meaning but not altogether gracefully animated one in question.</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," replied Wan, with a self-descriptive smile, "the processes
  are many and diffuse. There are, to example them, those who remove
  uncongenial teeth for the afflicted; others who advance the opposing claims
  of the litigiously inclined; and forecasters of the future. But in order to
  succeed in these various enterprises, it is desirable to be able to extract
  an indicated fang, to entice the confidence of the disputations, or to be
  able to make what has been predicted bear some recognizable semblance to what
  has come to pass. Then there are merchants in gems and precious stones,
  builders of palaces, and robbers in the Ways, but here again it is first
  advantageous to possess the costly traffic of a merchant's stall, to have
  some experience in erecting palaces, or to be able to divest wayfarers of
  their store in the face of their sustained resistance. Still endeavouring to
  extract the priceless honey from the garden of your inspired suggestion,
  there are those who collect the refuse of the public streets, but in order to
  be received into the band it is necessary to have been born one of the
  Hereditary Confederacy of Superfluity Removers and Abandoned Oddment
  Gatherers. Aspire to wisdom, O peerless one, but in the meanwhile emulate the
  pattern of the ruminative ox. This person will now proceed to frequent the
  society of those best acquainted with the less guarded moments of the revered
  ascended, and endeavour to learn perchance something more of his inner
  business methods."</p>

  <p>With this resolve, Wan sought out a body of successful merchants and the
  like whose custom it was to meet together beneath the Sign of Harmonious
  Ease, where they chiefly spoke in two breaths alternatively of their wealth
  and their poverty, and there strove to attach himself to the more leisurely
  inclined. In this he experienced no difficulty, it being for the most part
  their continual despair that none would give heed to their well-displayed
  views on things in general, but when he spoke of the one for whom he dressed
  in white and endeavoured to ascertain by what means he had earned his facile
  wealth, even the most sympathetic held out no encouraging hope.</p>

  <p>"The same problem has occasioned this person many sleepless nights,"
  admitted the one on whose testimony Wan had placed the most reliance. "In a
  spirit of disinterested friendship he strove, by every possible expedient
  that a fertile and necessity-driven imagination could devise, to inveigle
  your venerated sire into a disclosure of the facts but to the end he
  maintained a deluded and narrow-minded silence. The opinion of some here was
  that he secretly controlled a band of river pirates; others held that he
  associated with ghouls who despoiled the hidden treasure of the earth. My own
  opinion was that he had stumbled upon some discreditable fact connected with
  the past life of one now high in power. Properly developed, any of these
  three lines of suggestion should lead you to an honourable competence, but if
  the one whose foresight we are discussing has neglected to provide you with
  the essential clue before he Journeyed Hence, the line you incautiously chose
  might leave you suspended in quite another position. Your obvious policy
  would therefore tend toward neglecting to sacrifice for him the commodities
  of which he must now stand most in need. Under this humane pressure, his
  distinguished preoccupation may perhaps be brought to an enlightened end, and
  in the form of a dream or through the medium of an opportune vision he may
  find a means to remedy his omission."</p>

  <p>"It is easy to close a door that none is holding open," replied Wan
  freely, for the period had already come when it was difficult for him to
  provide for the maintenance of his own requirements, "and the course that you
  suggest is like Ho Chow's selection in the analogy that bears his name."</p>

  <p>"It is always a privilege to be able to counsel the young and
  inexperienced," observed the other, rising and shaking hands with himself
  benevolently as the beating of a gong announced that the evening rice was
  laid out near at hand. "Do not hesitate to bend your inquiring footsteps in
  the direction of my receptive ear whenever you stand in need of intellectual
  sustenance. In the meanwhile, may your capacious waist-cloth always be
  distended to repletion."</p>

  <p>"May the pearls of wisdom continue to germinate in the nutritious soil of
  your well-watered brain," replied Wan no less appropriately, as he set out on
  a homeward path.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">There can be little doubt that the Mandarin Hin Ching was an
  official of the most offensive type: rich, powerful, and in every way
  successful at this period of his career. Nevertheless, it is truly written,
  "Destroy the root and the branches wither of their own accord," and it will
  go hard with this obscure person's power of relating history, if toward the
  close, Hin Ching shall not be brought to a plight that will be both sharp and
  ignominious.</p>

  <p>Among the other degraded attributes of the concave Hin Ching was a
  disposition to direct his acquisitive glances toward objects with which he
  could have no legitimate concern, and in this way it had become a custom for
  him to loiter, on a variety of unworthy pretexts, in the region of Wan's not
  specially attractive home at such hours as those when Lan-yen might
  reasonably be encountered there alone. For her part, the one in question
  dutifully endeavoured to create the impression that she was unaware of his
  repulsively expressed admiration, and even of his presence, but owing to his
  obtuse persistence there were occasions when to have done this consistently
  would have become inept. Thus and thus Wan had more than once discovered him,
  but with his usual ill-conditioned guile Hin Ching had never yet failed to
  have his feet arranged in an appropriate position when they encountered.</p>

  <p>On his return from the Abode of Harmonious Ease, where the outcome of his
  quest has already been so insipidly described, Wan presently became aware
  that the chair of a person of some consequence lurked in the shadow of his
  decrepit door, the bearers, after the manner of their supine tribe, having
  composed themselves to sleep. Wan was thereby given the opportunity to enter
  unperceived, which he did in an attitude of introspective reverie, this
  enabling him to linger abstractedly for an appreciable moment at the curtain
  of the ceremonial hall before he disclosed his presence. In this speculative
  poise he was able to listen, without any loss of internal face, to the exact
  terms of the deplorable Hin Ching's obscene allurement, and, slightly later,
  to Lan-yen's virtuous and dignified rejoinder. Rightly assuming that there
  would be no further arisement likely to outweigh the disadvantages of being
  detected there, Wan then stepped forth.</p>

  <p>"O perverse and double-dealing Mandarin!" he exclaimed reproachfully; "is
  this the way that justice is displayed about the limits of the Ia-ling
  Mountains? Or how shall the shepherd that assails the flock by night control
  his voice to sentence those ravage it by day?"</p>

  <p>"It is well to be reminded of my exalted office," replied Hin Ching,
  recovering his composure and arrogantly displaying the insignia of his rank.
  "Knees such as yours were made to bend, presumptuous Wan, and the rebellious
  head that has grown too tall to do obeisance can be shortened," and he
  indicated by a gesture that the other should prostrate himself.</p>

  <p>"When the profound Ng-tai made the remark, 'Beneath an integritous roof
  all men are equal,' he was entertaining an imitator of official seals, three
  sorcerers, and a celebrated viceroy. Why then should this person depart from
  the high principle in favour of one merely of the crystal button?"</p>

  <p>"Four powerful reasons may be brought to bear upon the argument," replied
  Hin Ching, and he moved toward the door to summon his attendants.</p>

  <p>"They do not apply to the case as I present it," retorted Wan, drawing his
  self-reliant sword and intervening its persuasive edge between the other and
  his purpose. "Let us confine the issue to essential points, O crafty
  Mandarin."</p>

  <p>At this determined mien Hin Ching lost the usual appearance of his face
  somewhat, though he made a misbegotten attempt to gather reassurance by
  grinding his ill-arranged teeth aggressively. As Wan still persisted in an
  unshaken front, however, the half-stomached person facing him very soon began
  to retire behind himself and to raise a barrier of evasive subterfuge--first
  by the claim that as the undoubted thickness of his body afforded a double
  target he should be permitted to return two blows for each one aimed against
  him, and later with a demand that he should be allowed to stand upon a dais
  during the encounter by virtue of his high position. Whatever might have been
  the issue of his strategy, the conflict was definitely averted by a melodious
  wail of anguish from Lan-yen as she suddenly composed herself into a
  gracefully displayed rigidity at the impending scene of bloodshed. In the
  ensuement, the detestable Hin Ching imperceptibly faded out, the last
  indiciation of his contaminating presence being the apophthegm that were more
  ways of killing a dragon than that of holding its head under water.</p>

  <p>As the time went on, the deeper meaning of the contemptible Hin Ching's
  sinister remark gradually came up to the surface. Those who in the past had
  not scrupled to associate with Wan now began to alienate themselves from his
  society, and when closely pressed spoke from behind well-guarded lips of
  circumspection and the submission to authority that the necessities of an
  increased posterity entailed. Others raised a lukewarm finger as he passed
  where before there had been two insistent outstretched hands, and everywhere
  there was a disposition to remember neglected tasks on his approach.</p>

  <p>In other and more sombre shapes, the inauspicious shadow of this corrupt
  official darkened Wan's blameless path. Merchants with whom he had been wont
  to traffic on the general understanding that he would requite them in a more
  propitious hour now disclosed a concentration of adverse circumstances that
  obliged them to withhold their store, so that gradually the bare necessities
  of the least elaborate life ceased to be within his reach. From time to time
  heavy rocks, moved by no apparent cause, precipitated themselves around his
  footsteps, hitherto reliant bridges burst asunder at the exact moment when he
  might be expected to be crossing them, and immutable laws governing the
  recurrence of a stated hazard seemed for a time to be suspended from their
  function. "The egregious Hin Ching certainly does not intend to eat his
  words," remarked Wan impassively as a triumphant arch which lay beyond his
  gate crumbled for the fourth time as he passed through.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">Who has not proved the justice of the saying, "She who
  breaks the lid by noon will crack the dish ere nightfall?" Wan was already
  suffering from the inadequacy of a misguided father, the depravity of an
  unscrupulous official, and the flaccidity of a weak-kneed band of neighbours.
  To these must now be added a cessation of the ordinary source of nature and
  the intervention of the correcting gods. Under their avenging rule, a
  prolonged drought assailed the land, so that where fruitfulness and verdure
  had hitherto prevailed, there was soon nothing to be found but barrenness and
  dust. Wan and Lan-yen began to look into each other's eyes with a benumbing
  dread, and each in turn secretly replaced among their common store something
  from the allotted portion and strove unseen to dull the natural pangs of
  hunger by countless unstable wiles. The meagre strip of cultivated land they
  held, perforce their sole support, was ill-equipped against the universal
  famine, and it was with halting feet and downcast face that Wan returned each
  day to display his slender gain. "A few parched fruit I bring," it might be,
  or, "This cup of earth-nuts must suffice," perchance. Soon, "Naught remains
  now but bitter-tasting herbs," he was compelled to say, and Lan-yen waited
  for the time when there would come the presage of their fate, "There now is
  nothing more."</p>

  <p>In the most distant corner of the garden there stood two shrubs of a kind
  then unfamiliar to the land, not tall but very sturdy in their growth. Once
  when they walked together in that part, Lan-yen had drawn Wan aside, and
  being of a thrifty and sententious mind, had pointed to them, saying:</p>

  <p>"Here are two shrubs which neither bear fruit nor serve a useful purpose
  in some other way. Put out your hand, proficient one, and hew them down so
  that their wood may feed our scanty hearth and a more profitable herbage
  occupy their place."</p>

  <p>At this request Wan changed countenance, and although he cleared his
  throat repeatedly, it was some time before he could frame a suitable
  reply.</p>

  <p>"There is a tradition connected with this spot," he said at length, "which
  would make it extremely ill-advised to do as you suggest."</p>

  <p>"How then does it chance that the story has never yet reached my
  all-embracing ears?" inquired Lan-yen in some confusion. "What mystery is
  here?"</p>

  <p>"That," replied Wan tactfully, "is because your conversation is mainly
  with the ephemeral and slight. The legend was received from the lips of the
  most venerable dweller in this community, who had in turn acquired it from
  the mental storehouse of his predecessor."</p>

  <p>"The words of a patriarch, though generally diffuse and sometimes
  incoherent, are worth of regard," admitted Lan-yen gracefully. "Proceed to
  unfold your reminiscent mood."</p>

  <p>"Upon this spot in bygone years there lived a pious anchorite who sought
  to attain perfection by repeating the names of the Pure Ones an increasing
  number of times each day. Devoting himself wholly to this sacred undertaking,
  and being by nature generously equipped toward the task, he at length formed
  the meritorious project of continuing without intermission either by night or
  day, and, in this tenacious way outstripping all rival and competing
  anchorites, of being received finally into a higher state of total
  obliteration in the Ultimate Beyond than any recluse had hitherto attained.
  Every part of his being responded to the exalted call made on it, save only
  one, but in each case, just as the permanent achievement lay within his
  grasp, his rebellious eyelids fell from the high standard of perfection and
  betrayed him into sleep. All ordinary methods of correction having failed,
  the conscientious solitary took a knife of distinguishing sharpness, and
  resolutely slicing off the effete members of his house, he cast them from him
  out into the night. The watchful Powers approved, and to mark the sacrifice a
  tree sprang up where each lid fell and by the contour of its leaf proclaimed
  the symbol of its origin."</p>

  <p>This incident occurred to Lan-yen's mind when their extremity had passed
  all normal bounds and every kind of cultivated food had ceased. The time had
  now come when Wan returned an empty bowl into her waiting hands, and with
  mute gestures and uncertain steps had sought to go, rather than speak the
  message of despair. It was then that Lan-yen detained him by her gentle voice
  to urge a last resort.</p>

  <p>"There still remain the two mysterious trees, whose rich and glossy leaves
  suggest a certain juicy nourishment. Should they happen to prove deadly in
  effect, then our end will only be more sharply ruled than would otherwise be
  the case; if, on the contrary, they are of innocuous growth, they may sustain
  us until some other form of succour intervenes."</p>

  <p>"If you are willing to embark on so doubtful an adventure, it would cover
  me with secret humiliation to refrain," replied Wan acquiescently. "Give me
  the bowl again."</p>

  <p>When she heard his returning step, Lan-yen went out to meet him, and
  seeing his downcast look she hailed him from a distance.</p>

  <p>"Do not despond," she cried. "The sting of a whip indicates its end and
  your menial one is inspired to prophesy a very illustrious close to all our
  trials. Further, she has procured the flavour of an orange and a sprinkling
  of snuff wherewith to spice the dish."</p>

  <p>"In that case," replied Wan, displaying what he had brought, "the
  savouring will truly be the essence of our feast. The produce of the shrubs
  has at length shared the common fate," and he made to throw away the dry and
  withered leaves that the bowl contained.</p>

  <p>"Forbear!" exclaimed Lan-yen, restraining him. " 'It is no farther on than
  back again when the halfway house is reached.' Who knows what hidden virtues
  may diffuse from so miraculous a root?"</p>

  <p>In this agreeable spirit the accomodating person took up the task, and
  with such patient skill as if a banquet of ceremonial swallows had been
  involved, she prepared a dish of the withered leaves from the unknown shrubs.
  When all was ready, she set the alien fare before Wan and took her place
  beside the chair to serve his hand.</p>

  <p>"Eat," she exhorted, "and may the Compassionate Ones protect you."</p>

  <p>"I lean against their sympathetic understanding," responded Wan devoutly
  as he looked beneath the cover. "Nevertheless," he added graciously, "on so
  momentous an occasion priority shall be yours."</p>

  <p>"By no means," replied Lan-yen hastily, at the same time pressing him back
  into the seat he would vacate. "Not until you have slaked your noble appetite
  shall my second rate lips partake."</p>

  <p>"It is proverbial that from a hungry tiger and an affectionate woman there
  is no escape," murmured Wan, and taking up a portion of the food he swallowed
  it.</p>

  <p>"Your usually expressive eye has assumed a sudden glassy lustre,"
  exclaimed Lan-yen, who had not ceased to regard him anxiously. "What is the
  outstanding flavour of the dish?"</p>

  <p>"It has no discernible flavour of any kind," declared Wan, speaking with
  considerable emotion, "but the general effect it produces is
  undistinguishable from suffocation. A cup of water, adored, before it is too
  late!"</p>

  <p>"Alas," admitted Lan-yen, looking round in a high-minded access of refined
  dismay, "none now remains! There is nothing here but the dark and austere
  liquor in which the herb has boiled."</p>

  <p>"So long as it is liquid it suffices," replied Wan in an extremity, and
  seizing the proffered vessel from her misgiving hand he took a well-sustained
  grasp of its contents.</p>

  <p>"The remedy would appear to be a protracted one," remarked Lan-yen in some
  surprise, as Wan maintained the steady rhythm of his action. "Surely the
  obstruction is by now dispersed?"</p>

  <p>"Phoenix-eyed one," replied Wan, pausing with some reluctance; "not only
  is that obstruction now removed, but every other impediment is likewise
  brushed away. Observe this person's sudden rise of vigour, his unexpected
  store of energy, the almost alarming air of general proficiency radiating
  from his system. It becomes plain now that from the beginning of our
  oppression everything has been working in an ordered scheme to lead us to an
  end. This is no earthly liquid, such as you might brew, but a special nectar
  sent down by the gods to sustain mankind in every sort of trial. From this
  moment our future prosperity is assured."</p>

  <p>As he finished speaking, there was a sudden outcry from the Way beyond, a
  blending of heavy steps and upraised voices; the door was thrust widely open,
  and with a deplorable absence of seemly ostentation the sublime Emperor of
  the land, accompanied by a retinue of agitated nobles, pressed into the
  room.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">Let it be freely admitted that a really capable narrator of
  events would have led up to this badly arranged crisis more judiciously and
  in a manner less likely to distress the harmonious balance of his hearers'
  feelings. Yet there is a certain fitness in the stress, however ineptly
  reached, for that august sovereign now involved was so rapidly outlined in
  all his movements that between his conception of a course and the moment when
  he embarked upon it there was very little opportunity for those chiefly
  concerned to engage in preparation. Thus steps into the record Ming Wang,
  last of his royal line.</p>

  <p>When the famine had cankered the land for seven full moons, there appeared
  before the Palace gate a stranger clad in fur. Without deigning to reply to
  any man of those confronting him with words of this or that, he loftily took
  down the brazen trident from among the instruments that hung there and struck
  on it a loud, compelling note with the fingers of his open hand. At this
  defiant challenge, in compliance with the Ancient Usage, he was led into the
  presence of Ming Wang at once.</p>

  <p>"Speak without fear," said the sympathetic ruler affably, "for the iron
  law of Yu protects you."</p>

  <p>At the mention of this heroic name, the stranger's expression varied in
  its tenor, and he drew up the covering of his face a little, although the day
  was warm.</p>

  <p>"In the north and the south, on the east and the west, there is a famine
  in the land, for the resentful gods withhold their natural moisture," he
  proclaimed; and it was afterward agreed that the sound of his voice was like
  the whetting of a sickle on a marble hone. "For seven moons and seven more
  days has this affliction been, and you who stand regently between the Upper
  and the Lower Worlds have suffered it to be."</p>

  <p>"What you say is very surprising," replied Ming Wang, "and the more so as
  no appreciable scarcity has been apparent at our royal table for the time you
  name. Be assured that due inquiry shall be made however."</p>

  <p>"Let it be made forthwith and justice measured out," said the intruder
  sternly, and he turned away and stood so that none might see the working of
  his complicated thoughts.</p>

  <p>"When two minds are agreed, what matter which tongue speaks?" remarked the
  liberally endowed monarch to the scandalized officials hovering round, and
  with truly imperial large-handedness he ordered the immediate presence of the
  four chancellors of the regions named, despite the fact that they were then
  residing in their several distant capitals. No stronger proof of the
  efficiency of Ming Wang's vigorous rule need be sought, for no sooner was the
  command issued than four chancellors immediately appeared.</p>

  <p>"It is obligingly reported by an unnamed well-wisher that a scarcity
  exists in all the corners of our boundless realm," remarked the Illimitable,
  in so encouraging a voice that the four chancellors began to beat their heads
  upon the granite floor in an access of misgiving. "Doubtless each has a
  wholly adequate reply?"</p>

  <p>"Omnipotence," pleaded the first, "there has been a slight temporary
  derangement of transport in the Province of the North, with the unfortunate
  arisement that here and there a luxury is scarce."</p>

  <p>"All-seeing," replied the next, "certain grain in a restricted area of the
  Province of the South has been consumed by subterranean Beings. Yet what are
  southern men that they should not turn from rice to millet with a cheerful
  face?"</p>

  <p>"In the Province of the East, Benevolence," declared the third, "a fiery
  omen shot across the sky, corroding the earth to barrenness that lay within
  its sphere. To judgments such as this the faithful can but bend an
  acquiescent neck."</p>

  <p>"Father of all mercies," stammered the last, who being slow-witted had no
  palliation ready to his tongue, "that same blazing menace then passed onward
  to the Province of the West where it wrought a like disaster."</p>

  <p>"Nothing could be more convincing," agreed the Mouthpiece of Wisdom
  heartily. "We were sure that something of the sort would be at once
  forthcoming. It will certainly be a fountain of consolation to your sorrowing
  friends, even in the most poignant moments of their grief, that your
  crime--despite its regrettable consequence--was purely of a technical
  description."</p>

  <p>"High Majesty?" besought the four in harmony.</p>

  <p>"It would appear," explained the Supreme indulgently, "that by withholding
  all mention of this distressing state of things (doubtless to spare our too
  warmhearted ears) you have each inadvertently come within the Code of Yao-u
  and Shun, under the Section: 'Conduct in an official whereby disaffection of
  the Outer Lands may be engendered.' In that imperishable Statute every phase
  of misdoing is crystallized with unfailing legal skill into this shining
  principle of universal justice: one crime, one responsible official. That
  firmly grasped, the administration of an otherwise complex judicial system
  becomes purely a matter of elementary mathematics. In this case, as there are
  clearly four crimes to be atoned, four responsible officials suffer the usual
  fatal expiation."</p>

  <p>"Enough," exclaimed the stranger, emerging from his reverie and
  confronting Ming Wang again. "In that respect, no doubt, a fit example will
  be made. But what of the greatest need besetting you, or who will persuade
  the seasons to resume their normal courses?"</p>

  <p>"As to that," replied the Emperor agreeably, "we are waiting to tread in
  your illuminating footsteps in whatever direction you may indicate."</p>

  <p>"He who brings the word is not thereby required to go the way," replied
  the one who thus described himself. "You, Younger Brother, hold the Line of
  the Immortal Eight. See to it that you do not fail their now expectant
  eyes."</p>

  <p>"It is one thing to hold the line; it is quite another to obtain a message
  from the farther end," murmured the Sublime rebelliously, but when he would
  have again applied for more explicit guidance, it was discovered that the
  stranger had withdrawn, though none had marked the moment of his going.</p>

  <p>"All-knowing," urged a faithful slave who bore the Emperor's cup, "if you
  seek enlightenment, wherefore are The Books?"</p>

  <p>"It is well said," exclaimed the Monarch, casting off his gloom. "What
  more in keeping with the theme than that a vassal youth should recall what
  the trusted keepers of our Inner Council have forgot!"</p>

  <p>"Revered," returned the spokesman of the Elder Branch, by no means
  disposed to have their prescience questioned thus, "if we who guard the dark
  secrets of the Books forebore, it was not that our minds were tardy in your
  need, but rather because our passionate devotion shrank from the thought of
  finding what we may."</p>

  <p>The Divine made a gesture of reconciliation.</p>

  <p>"Your loyalty is clear and deep, Tso Paik, nor has its source yet been
  reached," he admitted freely. "But what does the somewhat heavily scored
  music of your genial voice forecast?"</p>

  <p>"That is as will presently appear," replied the other sombrely, "for since
  the day of your great progenitor Shan-ti (who chose self-ending in
  consequence of what he learned) the restraining cords have not been cut nor
  the wisdom of The Books displayed."</p>

  <p>"Certainly there are strong arguments against doing anything of the sort
  in an idle spirit," admitted Ming Wang hastily, at the same time spilling the
  larger portion of his wine upon the kneeling cupbearer. "Perhaps after
  all--"</p>

  <p>"The requirement has gone forth: the issue must be met," pronounced the
  custodian firmly. "Even the lower-class demons have their feelings in such
  matters." Then, raising his voice, as his especial office permitted him to
  do, he called for the attendance of all his satellites and for the bringing
  of The Books. At this unusual cry, general business of every sort was
  immediately suspended within the limits of the Palace walls and an
  interminable stream of augurs, sorcerers, diviners, astrologers, forecasters,
  necromancers, haruspices, magicians, incantators, soothsayers, charm-workers,
  illusionists, singers and dancers, thought-readers, contortionists, and the
  like rallied to his side, bringing with them birds, serpents, fruit, ashes,
  flat and rounded sticks, cords, fire, entrails, perfumed wax, salt, coloured
  earth, dung of the sacred apes, crystal spheres, and the other necessary
  utensils of their enlightened arts. So great was the press that very few
  ordinary persons gained admittance, and of these only the outspoken and
  robust. When order was restored, the splendid ceremony of Bringing in The
  Books was formally observed, the casket opened, and the cords released.</p>

  <p>"Ming Wang," pronounced the one who had made himself conspicuous
  throughout, "this is the Wisdom of The Books and thus stands the passage on
  the bamboo slip to which my necessarily inspired finger has been led:
  'Drought, excessive, to assuage. Should a pestilential drought continue
  unappeased, a palatable extract may be made of the fermented grain of rice--'
  "</p>

  <p>"Tso Paik," muttered another of the Inner Council, from about his sleeve,
  "what the Evil Dragon has assailed your mental balance?"</p>

  <p>"Imperishable," pleaded Tso Paik in servile confusion, "dazzled by the
  brilliance of your shining condescension, this illiterate person misread the
  initial sign and diverged to an inappropriate line. Yet his arresting finger
  was not deceived, for the jewelled passage that relates appears on the next
  slip."</p>

  <p>"Continue, discriminating Tso Paik," said the Emperor pleasantly. "Nor
  suffer your finger yet to lose that selfsame place."</p>

  <p>"Sublimity, the guidance sought is that entitled: 'Drought, caused by Good
  or Bad Spirits, to disperse,'" resumed Tso Paik in a less compelling voice.
  "Thus and thus the message is pronounced: 'He who stands between the Upper
  and the Lower Planes alone can intervene when the Immortals have so far
  declared their wrath'--there follows much of a circumlocutory nature
  connected wit the Inherent Principle of Equipoise, and so forth."</p>

  <p>"That can fittingly be served for our leisurely delectation at some future
  date," put in the Highest. "Insert your chop-stick in the solid meat, Tso
  Paik. What have we got to do?"</p>

  <p>"Putting aside these gems of philosophical profundity, Benign, the nature
  of your submission is neither palatable nor light." At these foreboding words
  a thrill of apprehension swayed the vast concourse, but it was widely noticed
  that the crude Tso Paik's lamentable voice took upon itself a pleasurable
  shade. "Decked to the likeness of a sacrificial ox, shorn both of hair and
  rank-denoting nails, and riding in a farmyard cart, it is your unpleasant lot
  to be taken to the highest point of the sacred Ia-ling range and there
  confess your sins to Heaven and undertake reform. When this humane sacrifice
  has been achieved (providing no untoward omen intervenes meanwhile) the
  healing rain will fall."</p>

  <p>At the full understanding of this direful penance, an awestruck silence
  fell upon the throng. The first to break it was the captain of the Emperor's
  chosen guard, and although he was incapable of producing more than an
  attenuated whisper, his words expressed the thoughts of every loyal subject
  there.</p>

  <p>"Sins! Who speaks of sins?" he murmured in a maze. "How can that which is
  not, be? The Ever-righteous has no sins!"</p>

  <p>Never was the profundity of the All-grasping more lucidly displayed than
  in that exacting pause when, whatever else happened, a popular rising, in one
  direction or another, seemed inevitable.</p>

  <p>"Peace, worthy Sung," he cried, in a voice that carried to the public
  square outside, where it was rapturously acclaimed, although at that distance
  it was, of course, impossible to distinguish a word he said; "restrain your
  generous zeal and whet your docile ears to an acuter edge. The obligation is
  to confess sins: not to possess them. Admittedly we have no sins, for, little
  as the censorious credit it, your Unapproachable is often denied what the
  meanest outcast in his realm can wallow in. Nothing that we may do is, or can
  be, wrong; but the welfare of the people is our chief concern, and to secure
  that end there is no catalogue of vice that we shall not cheerfully subscribe
  to."</p>

  <p>So unutterable was the effect produced by this truly regal magnaminity
  that all who heard its terms were rendered speechless. Those outside, on the
  contrary, hastily assuming that Ming Wang had said all that he had intended,
  testified their satisfaction more joyfully than before, and loud cries of "A
  thousand years!" filled the air.</p>

  <p>"In the detail of promising amendment, also, there is nothing to which the
  most arbitrary need take exception," continued the enlightened Monarch when
  his voice could once more be heard. "What, after all, is a promise of
  amendment but an affirmation that the one who makes it will be more worthy of
  homage tomorrow than today? There is nothing new about that in your
  Immaculate's career; every day finds him better than before."</p>

  <p>"Your words are like a string of hanging lanterns, when the way has
  hitherto been dark," fervently declared an aged counsellor. "But, Pre </p>

  <p>eminence, your polished nails, your cultivated hair--!"</p>

  <p>"It is better to lose two spans outward than one span inward," replied the
  practical-minded Sovereign, dropping his voice for that one's ear alone.
  "Yet," he continued, turning to Tso Paik again, "in one respect the limit of
  compliance has been reached, and he who opens a hand so freely on the right
  may close one as tightly on the left. 'The likeness of an ox,' is doubtless a
  picturesque analogy, and the similitude is not bereft of a certain massive
  dignity. But if at the extremity of your prolific mind, Tso Paik, you cherish
  the questionable ambition of displaying your confiding Ruler to a
  superstitious though by no means simpleminded populace, wearing horns--"</p>

  <p>"Mirror of felicity!" protested Tso Paik, as one who is maligned; "if my
  crude tongue offends, let it cease. You wear a sword and my head has but a
  single neck."</p>

  <p>"In our romantic land there should be room both for your tongue and my
  sword to move without any overlapping," reassured Ming Wang. "Proceed, in
  your sublime office, therefore, to the exactitude of detail, and let harmony
  prevail."</p>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p class="first">Thus in the third year of his short but glorious reign the
  well disposed Ming Wang set out to free his people from the evil that
  oppressed them, draped in the semblance of a sacrificial ox (the metaphor, it
  was found, did not demand more than a screen of rushes to enclose his lower
  half), shorn, and riding in a dung-cart through the land. With so
  liberal-minded a prince, in so ambiguous a guise, it was impossible that the
  journey should be devoid of incident, but this is the essential story of Wan,
  and he who, while gathering mast, suffers his mind to dwell on the thought of
  peaches, will return with an empty sack.</p>

  <p>In due course the company reached the lower slopes of the Ia-ling
  Mountains and thenceforward all progress was on foot. Tso Paik, who was gross
  by nature and very sluggish on his feet, would willingly have remained below
  to offer up (he said) an invocation to the gods, but Ming Wang would not
  suffer this, claiming that if he did their appetites might become satiate
  before his own chance came. Being of a slight and strenuous cast, this mode
  of progress was more congenial to the Emperor's taste than the restricted
  freedom of the dung-cart, and from time to time he inspired his train by
  pointing out to them that what they deemed to be the highest point was an
  imposition of the eye, and that yet another peak lay beyond. Finally, Tso
  Paik rolled bodily on the ground and declared that, as he could go no
  farther, where he lay in his official rank as Chief Custodian of The Books
  must constitute the limit, and this was then agreed to.</p>

  <p>No complete record of Ming Wang's confession now exists, all those who
  accompanied him having entered into a deep compact to preserve a stubborn
  silence. It is admitted, however, that it was of inordinate length, very
  explicit in its details, and that it implicated practically every courtier
  and official of any standing. In a final access of self reproach, the Emperor
  penitently admitted that he was the guilty head of a thoroughly decayed and
  criminal autocracy, that he weakly surrounded himself with greedy and
  incompetent officials, and that he had thoughtlessly permitted sycophantry,
  bribery, and peculation to abound.</p>

  <p>Almost before he had begun to speak, heavy clouds were seen to drift up
  from the west; with the final words of definite submission, a few drops fell,
  and the ceremony was concluded in a steady downpour. The conscientious
  Monarch did not allow the undoubted discomfort of all concerned to stem the
  flow of his inspired penitence, but when the last atrocity that he could lay
  to his own and, even more pointedly, to his ministers' charge had been
  revealed, he called up on Tso Paik.</p>

  <p>"You, Tso Paik, as Ceremonial Director of the Enterprise, have
  accomplished an end. Yet, no longer to maintain a poise, does not the copious
  promptness of the response astonish even you?"</p>

  <p>"Omnipotence," replied Tso Paik, looking steadily before him, "my faith
  was like an elephant tethered to a rock."</p>

  <p>"It is well," agreed the Greatest, endeavouring to shake his scanty outer
  garment free of moisture. "Bring forward now our largest state umbrella."</p>

  <p>At this sudden but in no way unreasonable command, a very concentrated
  silence engaged the company, and those who had not the opportunity to
  withdraw in unstudied abstraction sought to anticipate any call upon
  themselves by regarding the one involved expectantly.</p>

  <p>"Alas," confessed the dense Tso Paik, "it had not occurred to this one's
  bankrupt mind that there would be any likelihood--" But at that point,
  understanding the snare to which he had enticed himself, he stopped
  ineptly.</p>

  <p>A passing shiver disturbed the royal frame, though with high-born delicacy
  he endeavoured to conceal it. Only a faint elevation of the celestial
  eyebrows betrayed the generous emotion at the painful obligation laid upon
  him.</p>

  <p>"It wrings my tenderest parts with hooks of bitterness," he said, "that so
  loyal and trustworthy a subject should have brought himself within the Code
  of Yao-u and Shun, under the Section: 'Conduct in an official whereby the
  wellbeing of his Sovereign is directly or indirectly menaced.' Li Tung, you
  are a dignitary of high justice; receive the unfortunate Tso Paik into your
  charge until the Palace executioner shall require him at your hands. Let us
  now strive to avert, so far as we can, the ill consequences of this fatal
  indiscretion by seeking the nearest shelter."</p>

  <h3>VI</h3>

  <p class="first">In this remarkable manner, two of the most notable
  characters of any age, Wan the son of Ah-shoo, and Ming Wang (to whose memory
  posterity has dedicated as a title "The Knowing") at last encountered, for it
  was to the penurious home of the former person that destiny inclined the
  Emperor's footsteps. Recognizing the languished fortunes of the one whose
  roof he sought, the considerate Monarch forebore to stand on ceremony, merely
  requiring a reclining stool before the charcoal fire.</p>

  <p>"Beneficence," exclaimed Wan, falling on his face to the best of his
  ability as he offered a steaming cup, "admittedly the hearth will warm the
  muscles of your lordly body, but here is that which will invigorate the
  cockles of your noble heart."</p>

  <p>For a perceptible moment the Imperishable wavered--certainly the balance
  of the analogy might have been more classically maintained, or possibly he
  remembered the long succession of food-tasters who had fallen lifeless at his
  feet--but in that pause the exquisite aroma of the fragrant liquid assailed
  his auspicious nose. He took the cup and emptied it, returned it to Wan's
  hand with an appropriate gesture, and continued thus and thus until the
  latter person had to confess that his store was destitute. Not until then did
  Ming Wang devote his throat to speech.</p>

  <p>"What is this enchanted beverage?" he demanded, "and why has it been
  withheld from us until now?"</p>

  <p>"It is the produce of a sacred tree, high Majesty, and its use but lately
  revealed to me by special favour of the Powers. Never before, from the
  legendary days of the First Man until this hour, has it been brewed on earth,
  and save for the necessary tests, your own distinguished lips are the first
  to taste it."</p>

  <p>"It is certainly miraculous," agreed Ming Wang ecstatically, and unable to
  contain himself he began to cross and recross the room, to the embarassment
  of the assembled nobles who were thus also kept in a continual state of flux.
  "It has a perfection hitherto unknown among the liquids of the world. It
  cheers yet without any disconcerting effect upon the speech or movements. It
  warms where one is cold and cools where one is hot. Already every trace of
  fatigue and despondency has vanished, leaving us inspired for further deeds
  of public usefulness, eager to accomplish other acts of justice. It
  stimulates, invigorates, rejuvenates, animates, lubricates--"</p>

  <p>"Sublimest of Potentates," pleaded the recorder of his voice, "retard the
  torrent of your melodious soliloquy! How else shall this clay-fingered menial
  take down your priceless words which it is his design presently to set to
  appropriate music?"</p>

  <p>"It will be as acceptable at the earliest gong-stroke of the yet
  unawakened morn, as it will become the inevitable accompaniment to the
  afternoon rice. Into the inner office of the commercially inclined it will be
  brought to smooth the progress of each bargain, and in the dim recesses of
  our departmental activities it will produce harmony and discreet mirth among
  the abstemious yet sprightly of both sexes. In the chambers of our lesser
  ones its name is destined to rank as a synonym of all that is confidential
  and inexact. The weary student, endeavouring to banish sleep; the minor
  priest, striving to maintain enthusiasm amid an inadequacy of taels; the
  harassed and ill-requited inscriber of the spoken word--"</p>

  <p>"Proceed, O Taproot of Eloquence, proceed!" murmured the one who plied a
  hurrying brush. "To an accompaniment of drums, horns, and metallic
  serpents--"</p>

  <p>"To cope the final pinnacle, it is an entirely new thing; indeed it is the
  new thing, and unless our experience of an imitative and docile people is
  signally astray it will soon become 'the thing.'" It is hardly necessary to
  insist at this late date how noticeably the prescient Ming Wang's words have
  been literally fulfilled. Known for many centuries as "the new thing," the
  popular decoction passed by a natural stage into "the thing," and then, in
  affectionate abbreviation, to "the." By this appropriate designation it is
  recognized in every land to which our flowery civilization carries, though
  doubtless on barbaric tongues the melodious word is bent to many uncouth
  similarities.</p>

  <p>"It now only remains," continued the evenhanded lawgiver, "to reward
  virtue and to eradicate vice. The former is personified before us--the latter
  we shall doubtless very soon discover in some form or another. What, O
  benefactor of mankind, is your upright name?"</p>

  <p>"My low-class appellation is Wan, that of my mentally defective father
  being Ah-shoo, we springing from the lowly house of Lam," replied the other
  suitably. "The inconspicuous shadow lurking in the background is Lan-yen,
  whose name entwines with mine."</p>

  <p>"Yet how comes it that you, who are evidently under the direct protection
  of the higher Forces, are in so--as it may be expressed--?" and with
  commendable tact the humane Emperor merely indicated the threadbare walls and
  Wan's immemorial garb.</p>

  <p>"Formerly, Magnificence, my state was thus and thus, lacking nothing and
  having slaves to stand before my presence," admitted Wan. "But of late one in
  authority has oppressed me for no cause, save that the proverb aptly says,
  'Should you touch a rat upon the tail be assured that he will turn and bite
  you,' and in this latter end his malice has prevailed.</p>

  <p>"Ah," commented the Enlightened with a meaning nod at each of his suite in
  turn, to which they duly responded an apt glance of cognizance. "What is this
  corrupt official's name and the sign of his condition?"</p>

  <p>"He is of the crystal button, lord, and his forbidding name is Hin Ching.
  Furthermore, led on by an insatiable curiosity, he is at this moment standing
  about this person's crumbling gate, striving to peer through the prickly
  hedge toward us."</p>

  <p>"Let him be brought in at once," was the command, and with no opportunity
  to prepare an evasive tale Hin Ching was hurried forward.</p>

  <p>"Hin Ching," said the Emperor, who had meanwhile taken up an imposing
  station, "all your duplicity is known to us and no defense will serve you.
  How comes it that you have so pursued this meritorious youth who has our
  royal favor?"</p>

  <p>"Tolerance," pleaded the terror-stricken culprit, seeing no other course
  before him, and kow-towing so passionately that his words could scarcely be
  heard above the steady clashing of his head upon the sonorous floor, "be
  clement in your strength, for it has long been suspected that this person's
  heart is touched."</p>

  <p>"In that case," decided the Sun of Impartiality, "the marks should
  certainly be visible so that the innocent may be warned thereby." Then
  turning to his retinue he continued: "Procure a reasonable abundance of
  supple bamboo rods, and without disturbing the afflicted Mandarin from the
  position which he has so conveniently assumed, remove his lower robe."</p>

  <p>At this awful presage of the nature of the correction shortly to be laid
  upon Hin Ching, a shudder went up from the assembled host and even Wan
  vacillated in his strict resentment.</p>

  <p>"Brother of the peacock," he pleaded, "suffer justice this once to drowse.
  He is a man of middle years and obese beyond his age."</p>

  <p>"It has ever been the privilege of the wronged to condone the guilty,"
  replied Ming Wang, "and to that extent your plea must hold. Yet wherein shall
  Hin Ching's penance lie, in this case being outside the Code of Yao-u and
  Shun? What, Mandarin, is your strict equivalent?"</p>

  <p>"Your entirely humble ranks equal with a district prefect, High
  Excellence-- equal and above."</p>

  <p>"Henceforth you will rank equal and below, thus degrading you appreciably
  and at the same time enabling you to save a portion of your face. On the
  unbending line of pure romantic justice all your belongings should divert to
  Wan, but as this would probably result in your becoming a dangerous criminal,
  the special requirements will be met by allotting to him half. To prevent any
  mutual delusion, you will divide all you possess into two equal mounds--and
  Wan will make his choice."</p>

  <p>"May your life span ten thousand ages and your grandsons rule the world!"
  exclaimed Wan. "It is enough to have seen this day." And even Hin Ching
  contributed an appropriate, though a shorter, blessing from within his
  teeth.</p>

  <p>"It only remains to define your duties," continued the Ever-thoughtful,
  addressing himself to Wan. "Your style will be that of 'Protector of the
  Tree,' and the scroll confirming this will follow in due season. Your chief
  function will, of course, be that of assuring an unfailing supply of the
  beverage to your royal Palaces at all times. In your spare moments you can
  transmit offshoots of the trees to every point of our boundless Empire, so
  that the seed shall never fail. The office, which will be strictly
  hereditary, will naturally be quite honorary, what you receive from Hin Ching
  being sufficient to maintain your state. It will, however, carry with it a
  salute of three trumpets and the emblem of a steaming cup."</p>

  <p>"Majesty," reported an attending slave, entering at this pause, "a relay
  of swift horses from the Capital awaits your commanding voice without."</p>

  <p>The All-accomplishing rose and moved toward the door with the
  well-satisfied smile of a person who has achieved his worthy end.</p>

  <p>"Everything has been set right here," he remarked pleasantly, "and the
  usual edicts will follow within a moon." Then to his suite: "Come, let us
  press forward with all haste to scatter the germs of promiscuous justice
  elsewhere."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III.<br>
  The Further Continuance of Kai Lung's<br>
  Quest and His Opportune Encounter with<br>
  an Outcast Band, All Ignorant Of The<br>
  Classical Examples of the Past</h2>

  <p class="first">The next day, as soon as it was light, Kai Lung resumed his
  toilsome way, sustained by the cordial leave-takings of the villagers to whom
  his unassuming qualities as a relater of events had proved of interest, and
  no less encouraged by the tactful bestowal of such gifts as they had no
  further use for.</p>

  <p>"Even a meatless bone should be tendered with both hands," apologized one
  bereft of reason, as he indicated all that he could offer--a pipe containing
  only ashes, and in the same harmonious spirit Kai Lung placed the stem
  between his lips for a few moments with the equally polite assurance, "It is
  not necessary to pluck the fruit in order to admire the tree."</p>

  <p>At the parting of the roads a patriarchal figure was seated on the earth.
  As the one with whom this narration is essentially concerned approached, the
  inopportune person indicated that the other should retard his footsteps so
  that they might converse at leisure and with ease. Unwelcome as the delay
  would prove, Kai Lung had no alternative but to defer to the wishes of a
  venerable whose long white moustaches almost touched the ground. He stopped
  and saluted him with deference.</p>

  <p>"What is passing through your mind is by no means so hidden as you may
  think," remarked the stranger, with a penetrating glance; "nor, considering
  the mission upon which you are embarked, is your reluctance to be wondered
  at."</p>

  <p>"Your insight is both clear and deep," confessed Kai Lung. "What you infer
  is all the more surprising, as no word of this has so far escaped my docile
  tongue."</p>

  <p>The ancient smiled slightly in a self-approving manner and caressed the
  more accessible portions of his virtuous moustache.</p>

  <p>"It is not necessary for a philosopher to light a torch to catch
  glow-worms at midday," he replied profoundly. "The one before you, in spite
  of his admittedly quite ordinary appearance, is really an experienced wizard.
  Last night, in return for the gratifying entertainment afforded by your study
  of the vicissitudinous Wan, he spent the hours of darkness in drawing up the
  fundamentals of your lucky system. From these it would appear that the
  numbers 4 and 14 are inimical to your prospects, while 7 and 41 point
  directly to success. The mango is a tree to be avoided, but a golden bud set
  on a leafless stem leads to your achievement. Finally, should you encounter
  two hyenas and an infirm tiger disputing for the possession of a sick cow's
  bones, do not hesitate."</p>

  <p>"It is well expressed," replied Kai Lung gratefully. "Yet in what precise
  direction should the recommended lack of indecision tend?"</p>

  <p>The gifted necromancer raised his inspired eyebrows somewhat, as though
  this stress of detail did not altogether merit his approval.</p>

  <p>"It is one thing to forecast contingencies," was his reply; "it is another
  branch of the occupation to explain what takes place thereafter. If you have
  led a consistent life, doubtless some benignant Influence will be told off to
  direct you in the crisis."</p>

  <p>"I can make no particular claim to anything excessive," admitted Kai Lung
  with due humility. "My usual practice has been to avoid treading on bees,
  ants, silkworms, and industrious creatures generally, and there is a suitable
  hole cut in my outer door and a bowl of rice always set within so that any
  passing homeless ghost need not go hungry through the night. The care of
  ancestral spirits need not be specified."</p>

  <p>The aged made a gesture expressive of some doubt.</p>

  <p>"It may be deemed sufficient in your hour of trial," he conceded, "but a
  few authentic charms, written with perfumed ink and worn at the more
  vulnerable angles of the body, might well be added."</p>

  <p>With this warning in his ears, the storyteller passed forward on his way,
  for the pious anchorite had immediately fallen into a deep introspective haze
  from which it would have been unseemly to recall him. Profiting by the
  directions readily disclosed to him by dwellers in those parts, Kai Lung
  steadily followed in Ming-shu's offensive wake, not forming any very clear
  perception of how to act when the moment of their meeting should arrive, but
  content meanwhile to leave the matter to the all-directing wisdom of the
  forerunners of his Line.</p>

  <p>After enduring many hardships and suffering occasional inconvenience
  through the really flattering but too excessively persistent attentions of
  brigands, outlaws, underling officials, wild beasts of various kinds, snakes
  and scorpions, swollen rivers, broken paths, and thunder-stones, Kai Lung
  came on the seventh day at evening to the outskirt of a trackless morass that
  barred his further progress. The scanty dwellers in that sterile waste were
  persons of a low standard of intelligence whose sole means of livelihood
  consisted of the occasional wayfarer who sought their aid. These it was their
  custom, by immemorial use, to rob and then fatally dispose of, or to guide
  along the secret morass paths for an agreed reward--according to the
  arrangement which they found the more convenient. The appearance of Kai Lung
  was disconcerting to a tribe of so regular a habit.</p>

  <p>"For here is one who has nothing in his sleeve and whose apparel is
  inferior to the worst among ourselves," they said. "Thus he is secure from
  our extracting thumbs, and having no complaint to carry hence against us
  there is no reason why we should put ourselves to the trouble of disposing of
  him fatally," and they continued to look at one another askance.</p>

  <p>"That is a matter very easily arranged," interposed Kai Lung. "In
  accordance with a certain vow, it is necessary that I should cross these
  voracious swamps in pursuit of Ming-shu's host. By guiding me among the
  secret ways, you will fulfil one of your essential purposes, and by supplying
  me with such meagre food as will enable me to justify my oath, you will
  acquire merit of a very special kind."</p>

  <p>To this solution of their difficulty, the better-class murderers at once
  agreed, but some of the more sordid-minded, who by reason of their deficient
  literary attainments could not follow the balance of the synthesis, began to
  murmur from behind their fanlike hands.</p>

  <p>"It is all very well," they implied, "but Ming-shu, who began by putting
  us to death to exact our service, was forced in the end to succumb to our
  terms. Why, then, should we guide this alien wayfarer, who is plainly banded
  with Ming-shu, merely to gain some hypothetical distinction in a future
  state?"</p>

  <p>"The reply to that is easy and concise," was Kai Lung's ready answer.
  "This being the seventh day of my pursuit, it falls within my lucky zone, and
  thereby I cannot fail. Should you neglect to profit by my auspicious presence
  here, another will snatch this godsend from your grasp, for in the
  circumstances a powerful friend will certainly arise to foster me, even as
  that high official the Mandarin Wong Tsoi came to the aid of Keu Chun, the
  needy actor."</p>

  <p>"We who are men of the bog land of Ying-tze pay allegiance to the Mandarin
  Ho Hung alone," the ill-contents replied. "What is this new official with
  whom you threaten us?"</p>

  <p>"The word is inexact," maintained Kai Lung, "nor would a throat so
  obsequious as mine bend to the line of menace. The Mandarin Wong Tsoi is one
  who had no actual existence in this world, he being but a fictitious creation
  of an imagined tale."</p>

  <p>At this the tribesmen conferred together apart and it was plain that even
  the boldest were shaken. Then the spokesman stood forth again.</p>

  <p>"If the Mandarin Wong Tsoi was such as you affirm, how is it possible to
  say what words he used or the manner of his behaviour in any contingency of
  life?"</p>

  <p>"That constitutes the storyteller's art," replied the one before them,
  "and therein lie the essentials of this craft. But is it possible," he added,
  scarcely daring to voice so incredible a thought, "that you are unacquainted
  with the crystalline scintillation and many-petalled efflorescence of a
  well-related legendary occurrence?"</p>

  <p>"We are but the untutored brigands of this lonely waste, whose immature
  ideas have hitherto been bounded by the arrival of inoffensive travellers
  from the east and the manner of their passing out toward the west," confessed
  the tribe. "The form of entertainment to which you allude lies quite beyond
  our sphere."</p>

  <p>"Yet it would seem incredible," lamented Kai Lung sadly, "that within the
  furthest confines of our classic-loving Empire there should be tribes so
  barbarous and deficient in the rudiments of a literary veneer as not to be
  acquainted with the 'Romance of Three Kingdoms' or the more austere
  'Wilderness of Pearls,' and to whom the graceful apophthegm-spangled
  masterpieces of the sublime period of T'ang are a never-opened book."</p>

  <p>"We certainly begin to become conscious of a hitherto-unsuspected void,"
  agreed the leaders. "But how can a community living so remote aspire to
  correct our fault?"</p>

  <p>"As to that," replied Kai Lung modestly, "the one before you is himself a
  very third-rate relater of fabricated legends. On the understanding that you
  will guide him through the hidden byways of your prepossessing swamp and will
  supply his present need, he will, to the best of his quite unsatisfactory
  ability, endeavour to waste your priceless time with the narrative entitled
  'The Story of Wong Tsoi and the Merchant Teen King's Thumb.'"</p>

  <p>"Is that a noteworthy example of your inimitable style?" asked the
  chieftain of the band politely.</p>

  <p>"It is neither better nor worse than any other threadbare makeshift of my
  superannuated stock," replied Kai Lung no less reciprocally. "It maintains,
  however, a certain harmonious parallelity to our existing state in that a
  discreditable outcast finds a beneficent protector in his hour of need, and
  the one who thus upheld his cause is himself rewarded for his virtuous
  action."</p>

  <p>"If that is the case, we will constitute your circle," agreed the others,
  "and when you have honourable fulfilled your word you will find no
  disposition on our part to recede from ours." Kai Lung accordingly unrolled
  his well-worn mat and indicated that his simple preparation was
  complete.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>The Story of Wong Tsoi and the Merchant Teen King's
  Thumb</em></p>

  <p class="first">It was the custom of the Mandarin Wong Tsoi to move about
  the streets of Hoo-Yang at night unattended and by stealth. Sometimes he
  chanced upon an encounter of a kind that was not strictly within his province
  as a magistrate, at others he heard a whisper that enabled him to influence
  justice toward those whom he distrusted without the necessity of invoking the
  more elaborate forms of law, and upon one occasion-- But having thus brought
  to the notice of a select and proverbially open-handed band of listeners the
  most distinguished person of this very ordinary recital (according to the
  dictates of the refined models of the past), it is now permissible to begin
  in a more convenient manner.</p>

  <p>When Chun, the son of Keu, returning to his father's house from a lengthy
  absence, made his first inquiry, after the protestations of regard and filial
  devotion, it was of Fragrant Petal he spoke. Recalling little of what had
  gone before, they told him freely, with, perchance, an added jest that one so
  old and unwieldy in his bunk as Teen King, the rich produce merchant, should
  seek to possess a butterfly. When he knew all, Chun reached for his hat and
  staff and unlatched the door.</p>

  <p>"I would look again upon the Ways and well-remembered quarters of the
  city," he remarked evasively.</p>

  <p>"Yet it is now dark," they reminded him, "and you are but just restored to
  us. Tomorrow--"</p>

  <p>"There is still light enough to show me what I seek," was his reply.</p>

  <p>As Chun turned into a convenient byway that led down to one of the deep
  places of the river, he met two men running and heard a cry from the darkness
  of the water. The great sky lantern at that moment directing a propitious
  beam, he discovered one struggling vainly to regain the shore, and thrusting
  a long pole toward him, Keu Chun succeeded at length in bringing him to
  safety.</p>

  <p>"Your aid was timely," remarked the stranger when he was somewhat
  recovered, "and the measure of this one's gratitude will not be stinted. In
  what particular direction does your necessity lie?"</p>

  <p>"This is in the nature of things, seeing that the origin of our meeting is
  your desire to avoid drowning and my determination to encounter it," replied
  Keu Chun sombrely. "Thus the foreshore of the river on which we stand
  becomes, as it were, a common ground to both. If you will but continue your
  footsteps to the north and leave me equally to press forward to the south,
  our various purposes will thereby be effected."</p>

  <p>"What you say is sufficiently surprising, and I would gladly learn
  something more of your condition," exclaimed the other. "The dilapidated hut
  that shelters me stands but a short li distant from this spot. Even if your
  mind is set on drowning, courtesy demands that I who am concerned shall at
  least provide you with a change of dry apparel in which to do so more
  agreeably. Should you still be in the same mood after this slight civility,
  there will be nothing lost, for, as the proverb says, 'Felicity slips quickly
  by, but affliction walks side by side along our path.'"</p>

  <p>"If you feel that the omission would leave you under an intolerable
  obligation, I cannot reasonably deny you what you ask," admitted Chun with an
  emotion of no-enthusiasm toward any arisement. "Therefore, lead on."</p>

  <p>With this encouragement the stranger professed himself content, and
  together they sought the higher ground. Presently the more noisome district
  of the city, where beggars, criminals, and the literary classes had their
  quarter, was left behind, the better-reputed parts frequented by the
  industrious and sincere were likewise passed, and soon the spacious ways and
  well-spread gardens of successful merchants and officials marked their
  further progress.</p>

  <p>"Admittedly the path that seems long to a person when fleeing from justice
  appears incredibly short when he is led down to execution," remarked Keu Chun
  at length. "Nevertheless, this small li of yours--"</p>

  <p>"We are even now at the poverty-stricken gate," replied the guide,
  stopping before the largest and most lavishly ornamented of the mansions, and
  with a key that he drew from his inner sleeve he unlocked a door leading to
  the courtyard and stood aside. "Pass in, nobility."</p>

  <p>"Before one whose ancestors doubtless wore the peacock feather?" protested
  Chun no less agreeably. "These rebellious knees would refuse their sustenance
  should I attempt so impolite and act," and he also moved farther away.</p>

  <p>"The circumstances are not happily arranged for a really well-kept-up
  display of mutual refinement," remarked the other, speaking with some
  discomfort through his chattering teeth and at the same time stooping to
  wring an excess of moisture from his body-cloth. "In the name of the Viceroy
  of Hades let us go in together."</p>

  <p>On this understanding, they went forward side by side, though with some
  difficulty, the way being narrow and the one who led Chun a person of
  outstanding attitude.</p>

  <p>"This is evidently an underling in the service of some noble," thought
  Chun. "His easy manner proclaims that he is not altogether without
  influence." But the one concerned did not turn aside toward the living huts.
  He led the way up to the great house itself, and again drawing forth a key,
  he unlocked a door.</p>

  <p>"This is certainly a personal attendant upon a high official," next
  considered Chun, "and unless my memory is grossly is at fault, the ya-men of
  the district mandarin should he hereabout. If I have rendered this service to
  one who has the ear of Wong Tsoi, it may turn, if not actually to my
  advantage, at least to the disadvantage of Teen King."</p>

  <p>"Let us now rearrange ourselves more in comfort," said the stranger
  affably, and with the tone of authority, he struck an imperious gong. "Two
  changes of fine raiment here without delay," he cried to the slave who
  hurried at the call. "Later, let a repast be laid out in my inner room--a
  display suited to the entertainment of an honoured guest."</p>

  <p>"I hear and obey, high excellence," replied the slave, retiring.</p>

  <p>"Excellence!" repeated Keu Chen, falling back several paces from so august
  a presence. "Can it be that you are--?"</p>

  <p>The broad minded official made a gesture implying caution.</p>

  <p>"The wise duck keeps his mouth shut when he smells frogs," he remarked
  significantly. "Be discreet, and you may rely upon the advancement of your
  righteous cause. But should you be so shortsighted as to maintain a special
  claim on this one's succour it would be his duty, as an incorruptible
  upholder of the law, to sentence you to a variety of unpleasant exertions for
  attempted blackmail."</p>

  <p>"So presumptuous a thought never entered this ill-nourished mind," replied
  Keu Chun.</p>

  <p>"It is well said," agreed Wong Tsoi; "and among virtuous friends a slight
  inclination of the head is as efficacious as the more painful admonition from
  an iron-shod foot."</p>

  <p>With discriminating courtesy, the tolerantly inclined mandarin forebore to
  question Keu Chun more closely until a rich and varied abundance had restored
  their energies. Then, reclining with dignified ease among the cushions of his
  couch, Wong Tsoi indicated to his guest that he should seat himself upon the
  floor at a respectful distance away and disclose his past.</p>

  <p>"For," he added, "it concerns one who is responsible for the
  administration of the best-regulated city of our Celestial Empire to discover
  what flaw in an otherwise perfect judicial code prompted you to so
  distressing a remedy."</p>

  <p>"Yet, eminence," Chun ventured to remind him, "if your benevolent
  condescension is moved by so slight a matter as this obscure person's mere
  misfortune, with what refined anguish must you regard actual crime! The two
  unseemly outcasts who ventured to lay their sacrilegious hands upon your
  honored person--"</p>

  <p>"Cherish no apprehension on that score," replied the farseeing Wong Tsoi
  capably. "In cases of absolute wrongdoing, it is impossible for even the
  least experienced official to deviate from the iron rule of conduct. Cause
  and effect; effect and cause: these two facets of an integral system
  corollarate with absolute precision. Two persons having committed a Category
  One crime, two persons will automatically suffer a Category One punishment,
  and the Essential Equipoise of Justice will thereby be painlessly
  maintained."</p>

  <p>"It is what the scrupulous would look for," assented Chun.</p>

  <p>"It is what they will inevitably see," replied Wong Tsoi. "Should your
  leisurely footsteps chance to turn in the direction of the public execution
  ground on the occasion of the next general felicity, your discriminating eyes
  will receive assurance that the feet of the depraved find no resting-place on
  the upright soil of Hoo-yang."</p>

  <p>"It is indeed a matter for rejoicing that your penetrating gaze recognized
  the degraded miscreants who will thus be brought to an appropriate end."</p>

  <p>A faint absence of agreement for the moment obscured the well-balanced
  exactness of the lawgiver's expression.</p>

  <p>"If," he remarked profoundly, "so sublime a principle as Justice should
  depend on so fallible a thread as a single human attribute, all feeling of
  security would be gone forever. The two misbegotten harbingers of shame who
  submitted this hard-striving person to the indignity of thrusting him down
  into a polluted stream will sooner or later meet with a fate that will be
  both painful and grotesque. In the meanwhile, the wholesome moral of
  retribution will be inculcated in the throng by two others (doubtless quite
  as abandoned in their several ways) demonstrating that authority does not
  slumber."</p>

  <p>"It has been claimed that there is equally one law for the just and for
  the unjust," assented Chun, "and in a certain guise--"</p>

  <p>"Your loyal approbation nourishes the roots of our endeavour," interposed
  Wong Tsoi, rewarding the speaker with a handful of melon seeds cast in his
  direction. "Now disclose your own involvement."</p>

  <p>"Beneficence," replied Chun readily, "my obscure happening may be likened
  to a scorpion's tail, in that it is short but sharply pointed. My lowly name
  is Chun, that of my father's meagre house being Keu, and having ever been of
  a wayward bend, I earn my scanty rice as an inefficient Brother of the Peach
  Orchard."</p>

  <p>"An actor," exclaimed Wong Tsoi, regarding his guest with a special
  interest.</p>

  <p>"Alas, exalted," confessed Chun, "such is my offensive calling."</p>

  <p>The leniently inspired official made a gesture of dissent, after
  satisfying himself that no attendant lingered.</p>

  <p>"That which would brand you as an outcast in the eyes of the tightly
  buttoned, to me contains an added flavour," he admitted. "In the security of
  this inner chamber I will confide to your specific ear that I also am of a
  straggling and romantic nature, though the dignity of office makes it
  impossible for me to go very far in any impropriety. Nevertheless, half a
  cycle of years ago, when I had failed for the third time to attain the degree
  of Budding Genius in the competitions, I had all but decided to throw up an
  official career and go upon the wooden platform. . . . Does your refined gift
  lie in the portrayal of noble youths of exalted lineage who are for a time
  alienated from the path of happiness by the machination of an elderly
  vampire?"</p>

  <p>"At one time my ambition reached in that direction, but, as the saying has
  it, 'One learns to itch where one can scratch,' and my unworthy talents are
  considered most effective in the delineation of club-armed guardians of the
  street who slip heavily backward on over-ripe loquats, and similar devices of
  a gravity-removing nature."</p>

  <p>"Proceed with the recital of your story," commanded the Mandarin
  briefly.</p>

  <p>"Over against my lowborn father's bankrupt hovel there stands the home of
  Fragrant Petal, the graceful and entrancing offspring of the autumnal widow
  Le-she. From an early period it has been the habit of the sympathetic maiden
  and the calamitous earthworm now before you to meet unostentatiously in a
  convenient spot that was suitably screened from the windows of both houses.
  Here a binding arrangement was mutually exchanged, that each would remain
  faithful to the other. Fortified with this incentive, nothing seemed too
  excessive, and a score of moons ago the one who is now relating his sordid
  experience set forth to achieve distinction and to win an agreeable
  superfluity of taels. Today he returned--"</p>

  <p>"Doubtless to entrust a few bars of gold to a discreet friend's keeping?"
  suggested Wong Tsoi politely, as the other paused.</p>

  <p>"To recover a still serviceable pair of sandals that he remembered leaving
  in an outer shed, esteemed," replied Keu Chun with conscious diffidence.
  "Then only did he learn of the grossly unfit-to-live Le-she's perfidy. Taking
  advantage of this one's absence and of the obscene Teen King's infatuation,
  she had bartered Fragrant Petal to be that glutinous-eyed produce monger's
  possession at the price of a hundred taels of silver."</p>

  <p>"In these close-handed times, a hundred taels are not to be spat at,"
  remarked the Mandarin judicially.</p>

  <p>"Excellence!" cried Keu Chun springing to his feet, "it is not the
  equivalent of a single hair among the ten thousand glossy ones that go to
  crown her high perfection. When she smiles, her eyes throw out continuous
  beams of violet light-- even sideways. At every step her classically
  proportioned feet leave the impress of a golden lily. The Imperial treasury
  within the Purple City does not contain sufficient store to buy one glance of
  approbation--"</p>

  <p>"It was thus with this one also in the days of his own brightly coloured
  youth," sighed Wong Tsoi reminiscently, as he removed the outer skin of a
  choice apricot. "There was Che-Che who danced on pigeon's eggs at the
  'Melodious Resort of Virtue' in Chiang-foo, and another, whose attractive
  name has escaped my weed-grown memory, who was reputed to have invisible
  wings, for in no other way could her graceful unconcern, as she progressed
  upon one foot along a distended cord, be accounted for. But maidens are no
  longer what they were in the days before they gummed their hair. Doubtless
  this Fragrant Petal--"</p>

  <p>"If your own distinguished eyes could but see--"</p>

  <p>"Enough!" interposed Wong Tsoi decisively. "Shall one measure the bounty
  of the Yangtse-kiang by a teacup? But for your graceful versatility with a
  perverse-willed steering pole, the misshapen eyes to which you so fittingly
  allude would at this moment be unable to regard anything beyond the ill-made
  bed of an offensive watercourse."</p>

  <p>"Then, benevolence--?" begged Chun, stirred by new hope.</p>

  <p>"The engaging qualities you display--added to the fact that the
  low-conditioned Teen King recently deluded this confiding person in a matter
  affecting the quality of some reputed swallows' nests--establish the justice
  of your cause. How to proceed is another matter, for the contaminating
  refuse-blender has both wealth and legality on his side. Speaking strictly as
  one loyal subject to another, it may well be admitted that it is not
  infeasible to outstrip legal forms by means of a well-lined sleeve, nor yet
  to get the better of mere riches by a dexterous use of lawful methods. But to
  defeat both of these while possessing neither would melt the tenacity of
  demons."</p>

  <p>"Could you not," suggested Keu Chun helpfully, "in the exercise of your
  exalted office, denounce the unclean Teen King to vigilant authority as one
  worthy of immediate death, without disclosing too exactly the nature of his
  crime?"</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," agreed Wong Tsoi. "It is by no means as unusual course, and
  it has the merit of ruling out a mass of evidence which is wholly irrelevant
  when the result has already been decided. But by a most corrupt enactment, it
  is necessary for any official submitting a complaint to begin it with a full
  recital of the various times that he himself has been degraded."</p>

  <p>"Degraded!" exclaimed Keu Chun, incredulous of so harsh an infliction
  toward one so spotless. "Surely these blameworthy ears--"</p>

  <p>"On seven misjudged occasions--thrice charged with 'ordinariness of
  character' and on yet four times more for 'displaying originality of conduct
  unseemly in a high official.' " replied Wong Tsoi dispassionately. "Rearrange
  your composure, worthy Keu Chun; these are but formalities in the daily life
  of a zealous servant of the state and merely indicate that another would
  gladly wear his button."</p>

  <p>"Why, then, graciousness--?"</p>

  <p>"It nevertheless bars your well-meant plan. So inauspiciously sired a
  plaint would be consigned by the merest official pencil-moistener to the
  eternal oblivion of the dove's retreat," explained the Mandarin, with a
  meaning flicker of his wrist. "If you hope to look forward to a hundred
  strong sons to venerate your name, Keu Chun, something more apt must emerge
  from our mutual endeavour."</p>

  <p>"Benevolence," confessed Keu Chun with some dejection, "the one before you
  would cheerfully face the torments to achieve his quest, but in matters
  involving guile he is as devoid of wisdom as a new-laid egg is destitute of
  feathers."</p>

  <p>"Certainly the enterprise will need qualities of no common order," agreed
  Wong Tsoi ungrudgingly. "To your knowledge, did the maiden go unwillingly,
  and is she still allegiant to your cause?"</p>

  <p>Chun put a hand within his sleeve, and from a hidden fold he offered to
  the Mandarin a sheaf of polished bamboo slips tied together with a crimson
  thread. A score and five there would be in all, or even more.</p>

  <p>"This missive awaited my discovering thumb within a certain hollow cypress
  which often served our need," he said. "Read freely, excellence, of her
  gracefully expressed affection and of the high-minded repugnance with which
  she regards her detested lot."</p>

  <p>"Your meritorious word suffices," replied the Mandarin hastily, as he
  recognized the formidable proportion of the letter. "It is scarcely meet that
  another eye should rest upon the context of so privileged a message.
  Doubtless, after this avowal, you sought to approach beneath Teen King's
  inner window?"</p>

  <p>"That would have served no profitable end, esteemed. For a reason not yet
  clear, Fragrant Petal has been straightway conveyed to that corrupt spice
  adulterator's summer seat, a lonely tower lying off the northern earth-road,
  where she is strictly held."</p>

  <p>"Yet Teen King himself has not passed beyond the city gates during the
  present moon," observed Wong Tsoi shrewdly. "His ardour has a strangely tardy
  bend that it must loiter so."</p>

  <p>"Perchance the chief one of his inner chamber has raised a contentious
  voice--"</p>

  <p>"There you have struck the wooden skewer on its thicker end, Keu Chun!"
  exclaimed the other with conviction. "Her forbidding name is Tsoo, and
  hitherto she has allowed no secondary to share her place. Teen King, stricken
  with this corroding passion of his unsavoury old age, has acted thus and
  thus, hoping doubtless to sway Tsoo on one plea or another, or, perchance,
  failing that, to dispose of her inoffensively by some simple but well-tried
  method."</p>

  <p>"If that is indeed the case, then Fragrant Petal may still--"</p>

  <p>"May still be yours, you would say? Yet, should that come to pass, is
  there any secure retreat into which you and the ornamentally described one
  could imperceptibly fade? Assuredly, in so amiable a cause, some unnamed
  well-wisher would be forthcoming to contribute a double hand-count of taels
  to your virtuous success."</p>

  <p>"Munificence," replied Keu Chun, "to elude pursuit would then be easy. A
  propitious friend, lying at no great distance from this spot, trades a
  commodious junk far into the lower reaches of the river. Once there--"</p>

  <p>"Truly. As well look for an eel in a cartload of live adders. Forego
  despair, Keu Chun. I am by no means desirous that my care-word ghost should
  be under the burden of this obligation to your exacting ghost in the
  Hereafter. What a far from slow-witted official can do to readjust the
  balance now will be discreetly effected."</p>

  <p>"I am in your large and never-failing hand," replied Keu Chun
  submissively.</p>

  <p>Wong Tsoi waved a gesture of benevolent dismissal and closed his eyes to
  indicate tactfully that a concentrated reverie was necessary in which to
  mature his plans. So deep indeed became the profundity of his thoughts that
  neither Keu Chun's deferential leave-taking nor yet the various gong-strokes
  of the night were suffered to obtrude, and the early light of dawn found him
  with his eyes still closed in meditation and his body in the same pliant
  attitude of introspective calm.</p>

  <p>Let it be freely admitted that, when Wong Tsoi stepped forth from his
  ya-men on the following day, he had not the most shadowy idea of how to bring
  about Keu Chun's desire and thus fulfil the obligation that the saving of his
  life--at the risk of incurring the malignity of the presiding demon of the
  river--had imposed upon him.</p>

  <p>"Yet," he remarked self-reliantly as he set out, "I am pledged to the
  undertaking, and as the wise philosopher of Ts'i has so observantly remarked,
  'Where the head has already gone, the hind quarters are bound to
  follow.'"</p>

  <p>In pursuit of a guiding omen, the scrupulous official dismissed his chair
  and bearers presently and bent his not entirely reluctant feet in the
  direction of the "Abode of Harmony and Well-seasoned Dishes" at about the
  time of the evening rice. Beneath this auspicious sign might be found at that
  hour many of his more opulent and mentionable neighbours within Hoo-yang. The
  honour of an unceremonious visit from so high a dignitary was a conspicuous
  event, and the gratified Comptroller of the Table, meeting Wong Tsoi at the
  door, preceded him backward to his place, chanting meanwhile a happily
  arranged song in his honour, into which the versatile person gradually
  blended the names of the various delicacies available as they neared the
  highest seat. Wong Tsoi having made an appropriate choice, the one who had
  attended him retired in the same becoming order, extolling the guest's
  discernment in another set of verses, wherein he pronounced the selected
  viands in a louder key, thus to apprise the Custodian of the Grill of what
  was required of him. When the first dish duly arrived, following the dictates
  of ordinary courtesy, the latest guest stood up and pressed everyone around
  to join him in partaking of it.</p>

  <p>"The one before you is a thoroughly inadequate host," he announced, bowing
  graciously in the four directions; "a worse combination of courses than those
  that he has chosen could not well be hit upon, and, as is quite befitting,
  the most inferior portion of each dish has been specially reserved for him.
  How great, therefore, will be your amiable condescension if you will but
  leave your own attractively arranged tables and endure the unappetizing
  deficiencies of his."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," came from every side, "your nimble-minded wit makes you
  so desirable a guest that we must really implore your company here with us
  instead. As for the assorting of the dishes and the quality of the food, we
  can assure your high excellence that you are pleasurably mistaken in thinking
  that yours are worse than ours. Do, therefore--" The remainder of the
  graceful compliment was lost in the agreeable rattle of chopsticks as all
  resumed their interrupted occupation precisely as before.</p>

  <p>Now, although Wong Tsoi had evolved no definite plan, he had come to the
  "Abode of Harmony" in the full expectation of finding the unsightly produce
  merchant also there. Toward the outcome of that incident he had not neglected
  to burn a liberal supply of joss-sticks, so that, when his entirely
  expressionless gaze noted the gross outline of the objectionable Teen King
  seated at no great space away, he recognized that, so far as the Doubtful
  Forces were concerned, he was not ill-equipped for an encounter.</p>

  <p>Teen King, for his part, fancied that the dignified inclination sent in
  his direction was perceptibly warmer than the other three. Wong Tsoi
  recognized as the loudest voice raised in complimentary greeting that of Teen
  King. The omens pointed to the mutual recriminations in the matter of a few
  kin of debatable birds' nests being forgotten, but so far neither was
  committed beyond one side of his face.</p>

  <p>When Teen King rose to go, it was not inevitable that he should pass Wong
  Tsoi's table, but with absentminded detachment he took that course. Seeing
  this, the Mandarin's preoccupied foot thoughtlessly moved a vacant seat so
  that it barred the way.</p>

  <p>"Ten thousand sincere regrets that your honourable progress should be
  impeded in this manner," exclaimed Wong Tsoi, drawing the chair aside with
  his own obliging hand. "Have you appeased your virtuous stomach?"</p>

  <p>"Rather it is my own incommodious bulk that disturbs your well-intentioned
  chair," replied Teen King deferentially. "Are they gratifying your
  enlightened palate?"</p>

  <p>"Since an unlooked-for felicity has delayed you at this spot, will you not
  occupy the seat so auspiciously provided?" suggested the other. "After your
  laborious passage of this badly arranged room, doubtless a moment's rest--"
  and he pushed his snuff-bottle of priceless jade across the table for Teen
  King's use.</p>

  <p>"Excellence," began Teen King, after he had helped himself liberally from
  the snout of the recumbent pig that formed the bottle, "with the exception of
  ordinary business transactions, the one before you had led an integritous
  life. Why, then, should the path of his endeavour be edged with sharp
  afflictions?"</p>

  <p>"It is truly said that a rogue may sit under a scaffolding all day, but if
  a righteous man ventures to pass beneath a ladder, something offensive is
  sure to fall upon his meritorious head," remarked Wong Tsoi with ready
  sympathy. "Unload your overweighted mind, Teen King."</p>

  <p>"Your warm compassion melts the crust of my underbred reluctance,"
  confessed the merchant. "Furthermore, I desire to lean somewhat upon your
  official counsel."</p>

  <p>"Speak freely," replied Wong Tsoi, with but one thought, "for in matters
  affecting the relationship of the inner circle--"</p>

  <p>"That is a crow of quite another colour," interrupted Teen King, his face
  not entirely gladdened by the plain allusion. "Upon questions of that sort,
  it is seldom necessary for a really humane and affectionate head to raise the
  shutter of his domestic interior."</p>

  <p>"Yet," urged the exalted, "the one before you, as high official of the
  district, stands in the position of a benevolent father toward every family
  within his province."</p>

  <p>"Assuredly," agreed Teen King, "but the truly considerate son hides a
  great deal of what might be unnecessarily distressing from a venerated
  parent's eyes. In the direction to which you are obviously leading,
  excellence, be satisfied that by patience and the use of a stick no thicker
  than that which is legally permissible, the most opinionated of our lesser
  ones can ultimately be persuaded to bask in the light of reason."</p>

  <p>"This concerns Tsoo and the one called Fragrant Petal," reflected Wong
  Tsoi in the pause that followed, "and it clearly indicates that I was right
  in my conjecture. But with what other adversity is the misshapen thing before
  me harassed?" Aloud, however, he said:</p>

  <p>"With your usual crystalline logic, Teen King, you compass an entire
  social system to within the narrow limits of an acorn-shell. Yet you
  spoke--"</p>

  <p>"It is of it that I would speak further," replied the merchant, lowering
  his naturally repulsive voice and arranging his ill-balanced form so that
  they should not be overlooked. "Pass your esteemed judgment upon this
  obligation, highness."</p>

  <p>Wong Tsoi took the folded parchment that was offered him and submitted it
  to the test of a close scrutiny, even to the length of using an
  enlarging-glass to supplement his eyes.</p>

  <p>"There is no ambiguity at any point of this, Teen King," he said,
  courteously veiling his regret that it was not some tiding of disaster.
  "Herein you authorize your secondary to recompense ten taels of silver and a
  like amount of store to the one presenting this, he having already rendered
  its equivalent to you."</p>

  <p>"Do you find no questionable line about the thumb-sign?" almost implored
  the merchant.</p>

  <p>"I am as familiar with the signet of your pliant thumb as with the details
  of your prepossessing face," freely replied Wong Tsoi. "Should I fail to
  recognize you when we encounter in the Ways, or would I greet another by your
  ever-welcome name? Thus and thus. In every thread and indent is this your
  accepted impress."</p>

  <p>"Yet," protested Teen King, so overwrought because he dare not shout aloud
  his frenzy or kick any of the lavish arrangements of the room that his always
  unbecoming neck increased to several times its wonted thickness, "yet, high
  puissance, it is not the impression of my own authentic thumb, nor had I ever
  seen the thrice accursed draft until the mentally weak-kneed Chin discharged
  the obligation. What an infamy is here residing within Hoo-yang!"</p>

  <p>At this disclosure, Wong Tsoi achieved a sympathetic noise among his
  teeth, but he bent his face above the writing so that Teen King should not
  misread the signs of his compassion.</p>

  <p>"This is an unheard-of thing to come about," he remarked impartially.
  "Hitherto it has been assumed that by a benevolent dispensation for the
  safeguarding of commercial intercourse, no two thumbs would be created of
  identical design. It now becomes evident that something essential has been
  overlooked. Is there any more of this, as it were, questionable paper upon
  the market, merchant?"</p>

  <p>"It is that qualmous thought that is eroding the walls of my tranquility,"
  confessed the effete Teen King. "Three misprocured drafts have I so far
  honoured, and I tremble at the possibility of what may yet appear."</p>

  <p>"But," objected the Mandarin, "if you are the victim of a well-laid plot,
  why should you not proclaim the falsity, repudiate the impression of this
  alien thumb, and warn the merchants of our city to be alert?"</p>

  <p>"Therein you speak as an official and not as a man of commerce," replied
  Teen King with feeling. "Were I to do as you advise, I might as well throw
  open the doors of all my marts for the four winds to blow in and out. My
  thumb-sign is the evidence of an inviolable word. To proclaim openly that it
  is henceforth more than doubtful would be to put the profitable house of Teen
  into the 'formerly existed' class."</p>

  <p>"What then do you contemplate? To submit to this iniquity forever?"</p>

  <p>"That is the purpose of my confidence in you," replied Teen King. "As the
  ruler of the city, you will assuredly put forth your straightforward hand and
  the sacrilegious dog will cease to prosper."</p>

  <p>Wong Tsoi thought for a few moments under the pretext of having inhaled a
  superfluity of snuff. Then his face resumed its usual expression of
  inscrutable profundity, and he turned toward Teen King with a gesture of
  open-minded assent.</p>

  <p>"Agreeably so," he replied pleasantly. "Deliver the abandoned leper into
  my keeping, and your unblemishable name will be free from the shadow of this
  taint forever."</p>

  <p>"Therein lies the key of this one's hardship," exclaimed Teen King with
  some annoyance, for he began to describe Wong Tsoi to himself as a person of
  very stunted outlook. "Could I but discover and take the offender myself, one
  of my refining vats would very quickly adjust the difference between us. As
  it is, I rely on your authority to transact justice."</p>

  <p>"The one before you is a high official," returned Wong Tsoi with
  appreciable coldness. "Were he a dog, doubtless he could follow a trail from
  this paper in his hand to the lair of the aggressor. Or were he a demon in
  some barbarian fable he might, perchance, regard a little dust beneath an
  enlarging-glass and then, stretching out his hand into the void, withdraw it
  with the miscreant attached."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless," persisted the merchant stubbornly, "it behooves you for
  your own wellbeing not to suffer the rice to grow around your tardy ankles in
  the matter."</p>

  <p>"Teen King undoubtedly has something in his sleeve, or he would not press
  me to this limit," pondered Wong Tsoi. "Perhaps it would be as well to tempt
  the distressing mountebank into disclosing himself more fully. An apt saying
  should serve here." Accordingly he added: "Anything to do with your graceful
  personality admittedly has weight, Teen King, but in questions of authority
  mere bulk is not everything. It might be prudent to take to heart the adage,
  'A toad has to pass a very severe examination before he can become a
  dragon.'"</p>

  <p>At this allusion, Teen King changed colour several times and for a moment
  it seemed inevitable that the chair in which he sat must fail incapably under
  the weight of his displeasure. Seeing this, the one concerned rose abruptly
  to his feet.</p>

  <p>"It is also written, 'A pointed tongue, however keen a sword, makes an
  insufficient shield,' and you, O contemptible Wong Tsoi, will soon be putting
  the analogy to a desperate trial," he replied with vigour. "Learn now how
  that incorruptible official, Kao-tse of the Board of Censors, has been
  deputed to visit Hoo-yang before the next full moon. As he is somewhat
  heavily in this person's debt, the nature of his report, should you maintain
  your headstrong front, need not tax your imagination. It is one thing to be
  technically degraded seven times, Mandarin; it is quite another to be
  actually shortened at both ends, even once."</p>

  <p>With this illiberal forecast, the outrageous Teen King shook hands with
  himself in a disagreeable manner and withdrew his contaminating presence.</p>

  <p>"A person of true refinement would have expressed much of that very
  differently, but nothing will ever make up for the lack of a classical
  education," reflected Wong Tsoi when he was again alone. "However," he added
  self-capably, "though it will obviously become necessary to do something to
  counteract his malicious influence, there is no reason why the incident
  should be allowed to mar an otherwise well-arranged repast. This business
  clearly concerns Ho Hung, and he will doubtless be at home throughout the
  night."</p>

  <p>Ho Hung now steps into the narration, and in order to explain the
  unfolding of events, it is as well to describe his outline. He was of middle
  stature and not ill-cast, but with the essentials of an appearance spoiled
  somewhat by his face. His ears were loose and ragged, his teeth as large as
  those of a moderate horse but of several different colours, while his nose
  resembled a toucan's beak. One of his eyes was elsewhere; the other had a
  deceptive bend which enabled Ho Hung frequently to observe persons closely
  without their appreciation of the fact. At this period he was the admitted
  head and chief of all the thieves and assassins in Hoo-yang, but formerly he
  had conducted lotteries.</p>

  <p>When Wong Tsoi, late that same night, knocked in a special way upon a
  certain door in the least reputed quarter of the city, it was opened by Ho
  Hung himself. When he recognized the one who stood outside, the natural
  repugnance of his features changed to a look of welcome not unmixed with an
  arising lack of gravity.</p>

  <p>"You do well to greet me cordially, Ho Hung," remarked the official as he
  glanced cautiously about before he entered, "for if I should be recognized in
  this doubtful situation, it would certainly cost me my button."</p>

  <p>"As to that, Mandarin," replied Ho Hung with simple familiarity, "should
  you ever be put to it, there are half-a-dozen openings I could tell you of,
  in which dignity combines with ease, and in any capacity you would very soon
  excel us all. But will you not honour this one's bankrupt home by entering,
  and there--if you can but put up with its longstanding deficiency--partake of
  tea?"</p>

  <p>" 'For wine the top of the bottle; for tea the bottom of the pot,'" quoted
  Wong Tsoi pleasantly as he stepped within. "May worthiness never forsake your
  rooftree, valiant Hung."</p>

  <p>"May winning numbers come to you in dreams," responded Ho Hung heartily,
  standing aside in hospitable respect.</p>

  <p>As they sat together and drank, Ho Hung broached the subject that had
  shaken his dignity on the Mandarin's arrival.</p>

  <p>"Some word of the inept misadventure that involved your conscientious
  secretary last night has already reached my threadbare ears," he remarked
  discreetly, affecting to turn aside to catch a passing winged insect as he
  spoke. "Doubtless it is upon that quest that you are here at all?"</p>

  <p>"Up to a certain point the deduction is exact," replied Wong Tsoi,
  sprinkling a little snuff into Ho Hung's tea to mark his appreciation of that
  one's tact. "But, as the saying is, 'Although the T'ang road is long, it does
  not lead everywhere.' What is this that is being told of one whose thumb
  simulates the natural signature of Teen King, the produce merchant?"</p>

  <p>At this inquiry Ho Hung became so excessively disturbed in gravity that he
  could only with difficulty retain his seat, while his endeavour to imply the
  reason of his mirth by rapidly opening and closing his missing eye began to
  have a disquieting effect upon Wong Tsoi's imagination.</p>

  <p>"Thang-I the rogue's name is, and he has but lately come among us from the
  Waste Lands to the south," replied Ho Hung when he could speak with ease.
  "The witling has no ready parts beyond this facile thumb, he being of the
  mulish sort. But Tong, the fabricator of salt-due seals, who chanced upon
  this gift, has put the business through. Tong it is who does all Teen King's
  resealing when he mixes--your nobility will understand--so that he was well
  familiar with that aggressive merchant's thumb-sign."</p>

  <p>"This is likely enough," replied Wong Tsoi, "but wherein lurks the essence
  of the jest?"</p>

  <p>"It is not to be expected that a high official will have so gross an
  appetite for gravity removal as a mere sleeve-snatcher," pleaded Ho Hung.
  "The obese Teen King has ever been wont to press down an acrimonious thumb
  upon the feeble in Hoo-yang so that now the way that it has been turned
  against him has passed into a variety of questionable sayings. Indeed, it is
  become the matter of a most objectionable song that is being taken up by the
  river boatman to the rhythm of their task."</p>

  <p>"Even the humblest of the muses is to be encouraged," tolerantly observed
  Wong Tsoi. "Should a superfluous copy of that ballad come your way--"</p>

  <p>"It shall reach your discriminating hand without delay," promised the
  other, marking a sign upon his tablets.</p>

  <p>"There still remains the question of justice," continued the high
  official. "For the harmonious relation of our several interests, it is vital
  that the overstepping of certain limits should not be unredressed."</p>

  <p>"That is admitted," agreed Ho Hung, with a dutiful obeisance. "Your hand
  is that of a benevolent corrector, eminence, and this one will not, for his
  part, fail."</p>

  <p>"In assaulting, as you have so correctly been informed, the person of the
  one who takes down my spoken word, two unmentionable outcasts have been
  guilty of an attack--by deputy--on me, thereby--obliquely--against the State,
  and thus-- by analogy--have finally as it were submitted the venerated person
  of the Sublime Emperor himself to the extreme indignity of being projected
  into the tempestuous waters of an unclean stream. For this iniquity two
  malefactors must suffer the fullest penalty in order to appease the justly
  outraged feelings of a loyal people."</p>

  <p>"Authority must be maintained," replied the congenial Ho, "or whereon do
  we stand? The very foundation of the Joined-together Band of Superfluity
  Adjusters and Excrescence Removers of Hoo-yang, with this one at its head, is
  menaced."</p>

  <p>"We have always so far been able to arrange these necessary formalities in
  mutual concord," remarked Wong Tsoi. So amiable at these recollections became
  the condescension of this truly broad minded being that, after wiping the
  traces of tea from off his lips, he did not disdain to press the same cloth
  upon Ho Hung. "Nor," he continued, "is there any reason why we should not
  now. As regards this slow-witted Thang-I: has the lowly clown friends of any
  standing?"</p>

  <p>"He is a stranger among us here, and therefore not of our fraternity," was
  the reply. "Had this case not been thus and thus, he would have been driven
  forth ere this. Disclose your mind, exalted."</p>

  <p>"To earmark Thang-I for this needful expiation would effect a double turn.
  Have I your acquiescent word?"'</p>

  <p>"The dog has served an end, but the jest has all but run its course,"
  considered Ho Hung. "there is none to raise a voice against what you
  propose--save, perhaps, Tong, and he is of slight account."</p>

  <p>"Tong--would he so do? Then nothing could be better regulated. Two
  culprits are required: that being the case, why should not Tong be coupled
  with Thang-I and so still every murmur?"</p>

  <p>"Eminence," interposed Ho Hung, "even a goat and an ox must keep in step
  if they would plow together, and, as you have said, in matters of this sort
  we stand on a common footing. Let Thang-I fall to your deciding voice; for
  this one's share The-tang will serve."</p>

  <p>Wong Tsoi accorded a motion of dignified assent, for he had no concern in
  Tong, the seal counterfeiter, either one way or the other.</p>

  <p>"But The-tang?" he asked with polite interest. "Is not one of that name
  the prop of your right hand?"</p>

  <p>"He was, he is, but he will not henceforth be. Of late Teh-tang's eyes
  have been fixed on a point somewhat above his head. It is as well that he
  should be removed before his aspiring footsteps seek to follow."</p>

  <p>"That is a detail that concerns your own internal state, nor would this
  one seek to probe into the routine of your well-conducted band," declared the
  liberal-minded official.</p>

  <p>Then as he turned to go he gave the courteous farewell: "May your
  deserving path be smooth, even to the grave-side."</p>

  <p>"May your warmth and cold always be correctly balanced," replied Ho Hung,
  with no less feeling.</p>

  <p>It was at a later date that the keeper of the door of Teen King's
  summer-house was roused from a profound meditation by an insistent knocking
  at the grille. The night being dark and stormy, the menial did not hasten to
  comply, but a still more urgent summons brought him to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Should corrosion reward your acrimonious knuckles, this one will gladly
  attend your funeral rites," was the burden of his welcome.</p>

  <p>"Is this a time for mere verbal pleasantries?" demanded the one who stood
  there in the harrying rain. "Behold, the master whom you serve, stricken with
  an unlooked-for hurt, turns back home from your gate."</p>

  <p>"What is this that you say?" demanded the keeper sourly. "If there is a
  tale to be told, take hold at the beginning, friend, and not like the knife
  of some crafty juggler--haphazard as it comes."</p>

  <p>"My tongue and your ear stand on a different footing," replied the other
  in a superior tone, "I being employed about the counting house and you a mere
  bolt-slider. Your offensively honourable name is Wang, doorkeeper?"</p>

  <p>"That indeed is the mediocre style of my distinguished line."</p>

  <p>"Let it suffice then, Wang, that the merchant has received various scars
  by the instability of one of his bearers on this misconstructed earth-road.
  He would have remained here through the night but for this affliction. As it
  is, he requires the delivery now of the one you guard. Here is the discharge
  of your answerableness for her."</p>

  <p>The doglike Wang took the paper and held it to the light; then he compared
  the signature pressed on it with another that he had.</p>

  <p>"This is well enough as far as the matter goes, but his memory is here at
  fault," was the reply. "Only a while ago he sent an urgent message, saying
  'Accept no thumb-sign that is not made by me before your very eyes, for Dark
  Forces are about. This is my iron word.' Yet now you say he waits?"</p>

  <p>"This is beyond my office," declared the stranger frankly, "and you had
  better make fast your bolts and then come to the gate. It may well be that
  this is a snare on Teen King's part to try your firmness in his service."</p>

  <p>"If that is the case, he will find me grounded like a limpet," was Wang's
  crafty boast. "I make no pretence to any range of subtlety, but what is
  nailed into this head sticks there."</p>

  <p>"Bring your lantern," said the messenger. "Things hereabout are none too
  bright."</p>

  <p>When they reached the outer gate, two chairs were to be seen by the
  custodian's swinging candle. From the larger one a surfeit of groans and
  imprecations flowed, indicating, however crudely expressed, both pain and
  mental anguish. By the side of this a sombre-hearted carrier was still
  binding up his wounds.</p>

  <p>"Commander," pleaded the supine Wang, thrusting his head through the
  curtains of the chair, "there has come to me one who bears a certain message,
  this requiring--"</p>

  <p>The grossly outlined person dimly seen within did not cease to roll from
  side to side and to press a soothing cloth against his disfigured face. When
  he spoke, it was with difficulty, by reason of a swollen lip.</p>

  <p>"Why then does not compliance hasten, thou contumacious keeper of my
  door?" he demanded with rancour. "Is it not enough that I am to broken bodily
  within sight of the lucky symbols hung above my gate, but that my authority
  should also be denied? Where is she whom I require of you?"</p>

  <p>"Yet, master," entreated the abject Wang, "it may well be that this is but
  a snare to prove the tenacity of my allegiance. Was not your charge explicit:
  'Accept no sign that is not pressed before your very eyes?' How then--"</p>

  <p>"Enough," was the reply, and the one who spoke stretched out a requiring
  hand; "it is not ineptly claimed. After all, you have a sort of stultish
  justice to protect you, loyal Wang. Now submit the paper for the full
  requirement."</p>

  <p>With this demand the keeper of the door at once complied, exultant that
  his stubbornness had been upheld before the others. The one whose authority
  he owned turned away for a moment as he searched about his sleeve for his
  pigment box. Then he pressed the paper and gave it back to Wang who saw
  against the former signature another, identical in every line and still moist
  from the attesting thumb.</p>

  <p>"Nothing now remains but to execute your will," he freely admitted; "my
  own part in the matter being amply hedged. Say on, chieftain."</p>

  <p>"In that I cannot stay, with my deep cuts unseen-to, Fragrant Petal must
  accompany me back, the affair having taken a prosperous turn," replied the
  other. "Bring her out now, not staying for adornment, for my condition does
  not brook delay, but at the same time hastily put together all that she may
  have so that her face is not clouded among women."</p>

  <p>"It shall be done, O rewarder of great zeal," exclaimed Wang, preparing to
  comply. "How does this blossom among peach trees journey?"</p>

  <p>"There is a chair at hand"--indicating the second that stood ready. "My
  underling, who rode thus far, must make his way as may be."</p>

  <p>"Everything shall fall into place like a well-oiled mill at work," chanted
  the subservient Wang. "I hasten to merit your extremely liberal bounty,
  princelet."</p>

  <p>"And this one," murmured the underling, he who had first summoned the
  custodian to the grille, as he prepared to follow, "will meet the Embodiment
  of Beauty on the way and break to her ear the signification of the
  issue."</p>

  <p>"Unless," came a guarded voice from behind the curtains, "unless your
  father should have been an elderly baboon and your mother a standing reproach
  among she-asses, you will, on the contrary, withhold your egregious face
  until we are well clear of this stronghold of oppression."</p>

  <p>"Your strategy has been consummate throughout, great excellence," replied
  the other, "and this one bends an acquiescent knee to whatever you direct."
  So that he faded into the imperceptible, nor was there anything to reassure
  the grief of Fragrant Petal when she was presently led forth.</p>

  <p>"A thousand felicities, fountain of all largesse!" invoked the
  thirsty-handed Wang, as he stood at the opening of the first chair
  expectantly. "May the vigour of a leopard sustain your high endeavour."</p>

  <p>"Ten thousand echoes to your gracefully phrased parting," was courteously
  wafted back from between the curtains, as the bearers raised their burden.
  "The moment is not propitious, but when next we meet do not fail to recall to
  me that the extent of my indebtedness cannot honourably be put to less than a
  full-weight piece of silver."</p>

  <p>Nothing could have been more in keeping than the greetings of Wong Tsoi
  and the merchant Teen King when they again encountered beneath the burnished
  roof of the "Abode of Harmony." If the latter person had suffered a reverse
  in an unexpected quarter, he had the memorable satisfaction of having bent
  the mandarin to do his will in the matter of the unconscionable outlaw who
  had reproduced his thumb; if Wong Tsoi could not fail to recognize that in
  this affair the fullness of his countenance had suffered partial eclipse
  before the eyes of the superficial, he had the tangible offset that he had
  thereby been able to free his future of the Keu Chun obligation, and even yet
  he cherished an image that the one whose gravity would be the last to be
  removed might not prove to be Teen King.</p>

  <p>Without waiting for any gracious intimation that his uninviting presence
  would be suffered, the mentally ill-nurtured huckster on this occasion thrust
  himself into the forefront of Wong Tsoi's notice by sinking incapably into a
  chair at that one's table. To cover his grotesque behavior, the
  deficient-minded pedlar at once plunged into the subject of their late
  contention with the absence of refinement that stamped his uncouth footsteps
  whenever he appeared.</p>

  <p>"It nourished my heart to think that vice no longer triumphs about our
  city," he remarked with annoying freedom. "The two bodies now displayed in
  the Hoo-yang Public Relaxation Space prove that you have at length bowed your
  stubborn neck to the justice of this one's claim."</p>

  <p>"It is recorded of the enlightened Emperor Yu that on one occasion he rose
  from his bath and bound up his hair thrice uncomplainingly to listen to the
  doubtless unreasonable demands of quite negligible persons," duly replied
  Wong Tsoi. "Why then should not I, who am in every way so inferior to the
  imperishable Yu, inconvenience myself to that slight extent to satisfy one in
  whom the parallelism is brought to an apt conclusion?"</p>

  <p>At this well-guarded admission, the preposterous Teen King bowed several
  times, his wholly illiterate mind leading him to assume that he was being
  favorably compared to the great First Ruler.</p>

  <p>"In one detail an element of ambiguity prevails," resumed the aggressive
  merchant, unable even at that moment to subdue his natural canker.
  "Admittedly, the real offender in this case has suffered, for the thumb of
  one of the two bandits corresponds to the most rigid test against my own. Yet
  that extremity bears every sign of having been cut away and subsequently
  restored. Why--"</p>

  <p>"It is, as you, merchant, must surely be aware, an essential of our pure
  code of justice that the offending member of any convicted felon should be
  summarily struck off," replied Wong Tsoi dispassionately. "Later, to satisfy
  the ignoble curiosity of the vile--those who are notoriously drawn to gloat
  upon the accessories of low-class crimes--the parts were crudely united."</p>

  <p>"Be that as it may," persisted Teen King stubbornly, as he began to regard
  the mandarin's well-rounded form with an awakening interest; "someone has in
  the meanwhile counterfeited this person's exact figure--"</p>

  <p>"Forbear!" exclaimed Wong Tsoi, raising his face-cloth as though to shut
  out the vision of iniquity. "Such an atrocity is not possible among our
  chaste and grateful nation."</p>

  <p>"Yet, nevertheless, the fact exists," continued the obtuse-witted
  condiment-blender, "and it is this one's intention now that you, mandarin,
  shall obtain a swift redress. Not only was that which has been stated done,
  but under the cloak of this deception the sanctity of an inner chamber has
  been usurped, a trusty henchman baffled, an unopened bud torn from the
  protecting branch--"</p>

  <p>"Doubtless," interposed Wong Tsoi firmly, "but, as you would be the first
  to advance, merchant, in matters affecting purely domestic culture, it is
  hardly necessary for a really well-set and vigorous tree to disturb the soil
  that should conceal its roots."</p>

  <p>"Public action need not inevitably ensue," maintained Teen King feebly, as
  he recognized the snare that he had contrived for his own misshapen feet.
  "You, as high official of the district, stand in the position of a salutary
  despot who can administer justice in discreet obscurity."</p>

  <p>"Assuredly," agreed Wong Tsoi, "but the truly humane ruler turns a
  lethargic eye toward a great deal that might be actually pernicious in a
  cherished people's conduct. Should you be so ill-advised as to press your
  grievance further, it would be as well first to recall the special
  application of the proverb, 'It is better to lose nine changes of raiment
  than to win a lawsuit.'"</p>

  <p>"Yet what remains?" pleaded the ineffectual merchant. "Shall these
  poverty-stricken hands be idly folded while an unending vista of spurious
  Teen Kings draws away my substance?"</p>

  <p>"Suffer no apprehension on that score," replied Wong Tsoi with meaning.
  "Not again shall your notorious mould be counterparted in Hoo-yang."</p>

  <p>"Can that be definitely assured?" asked Teen King cautiously.</p>

  <p>"Subject to the usual clause against demoniac intervention, it can,"
  replied the mandarin. "For the rest, remember, 'Even dragons know better than
  to appear too often.'"</p>

  <p>"If this is actually the case, the prospect might have been worse,"
  admitted Teen King. "Indeed," he added, with an unworthy impulse to
  ingratiate himself in the other's regard without incurring the customary
  outlay, "had it been allowable, a substantial token of esteem would have been
  forthcoming to mark appreciation of your prolific efforts."</p>

  <p>"What is this barrier that stands in the way of so laudable a craving,
  amiable Teen King?" inquired Wong Tsoi in a very agreeable voice.</p>

  <p>"Surely it is not unknown to your pure excellence that in order to
  discourage venality an official of your degree is strictly forbidden to
  receive any gift whatever, save only--not to exclude mere courtesy--an
  offering of fruit. But as an earnest of this one's thwarted yearning, a
  basked of the choicest Hoo-yang hedge-berries shall reach your hand
  tomorrow."</p>

  <p>"Nothing could be more delicately flavoured than the compliment," murmured
  the engaging voice. "Yet had not a wise provision set a check upon your
  open-handed spirit, what form would the tribute to which an explicit
  reference has just been made, have taken?"</p>

  <p>"In that case," replied Teen King, seeing no reason why he should restrict
  himself in a matter that could involve him in no outlay, "there would have
  been no limit to this one's profusion. Throwing open the door of his needy
  hovel, he would have bidden you enter and accept what pleased you most,
  saying, 'Put forth your hand on the right and on the left, and whatsoever it
  closes on is yours.'"</p>

  <p>"It is no more than what would have been expected of your untarnishable
  father's nimble-minded son," replied Wong Tsoi, with a suitable display of
  appropriate emotion. "And now let your generous heart expand in gladness,
  Teen King. You would appear to have misread--though only slightly--a single
  character in the official prohibition. Not 'save fruit' but 'save in the
  shape of fruit' is the carefully thought-out exception."</p>

  <p>"Yet wherein does the variation lie?" asked the merchant, in a deeply
  agitated voice.</p>

  <p>"Embellishing your high-born serving board there stands a lordly silver
  dish, its cover in the likeness of a cluster of rich fruit, its base
  befittingly adorned with nuts," replied Wong Tsoi pleasantly. "Nothing could
  be more applicable or in severer keeping with the pronouncement of
  authority."</p>

  <p>At this disclosure Teen King rose up from his chair and then illogically
  sank down again until he was no longer capable of the exertion. His
  unbecoming mouth opened and closed repeatedly, but it was not until Wong Tsoi
  had charitably begun to fan him that he disclosed his power of speech.</p>

  <p>"What was spoken in the light of a graceful compliment is too delicate to
  be translated into the grosser terms of commercial equivalent," he stammered
  effetely. "The dish in question weighs not less than ten score standard
  taels, and its value in fine silver must be put at twice that indication.
  Why, then, should this almost bankrupt outcast tamely surrender it?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing but the untrammelled purity of your upright nature could suggest
  so great a sacrifice," replied Wong Tsoi.</p>

  <p>"If that were all," replied the other frankly, "I could sleep tonight in
  peace. But the extreme moderation of your manner prepares me for the worst.
  What remains behind, Wong Tsoi?"</p>

  <p>"Alas, merchant," admitted the compassionate official, "I had hoped to
  shield this latest menace from you. Know then how it is whispered in the Ways
  that the irredeemable Thang-I spent the last hours of his solitude
  thumb-signing countless sheets of unwritten parchment, which the dissolute
  hope to use from time to time as the occasions offer."</p>

  <p>"If," considered Teen King, after a length pause, "if one from my house
  should in due course appear about your door bearing a weighty gift and crave
  your acceptance of it, what would be the nature of his reception?"</p>

  <p>"That one so charitably employed should return empty handed would put a
  barbarian of the Outer Lands to shame," replied Wong Tsoi. "The least that
  this person could do would be to send out into the Ways and beseech his many
  criminal friends, as a personal kindness to himself, to bring in all the
  offensive Thang-I's fabrications."</p>

  <p>"Could a favorable response be relied on?" asked Teen King.</p>

  <p>"It has already been successfully accomplished, and the package now merely
  awaits your accommodating slave's arrival."</p>

  <p>"Would the third gong-stroke of the afternoon suit your distinguished
  leisure?" inquired Teen King, in very solicitous accents.</p>

  <p>"Nothing could be more in harmony," was the genial reply.</p>

  <p>"Thus and thus," remarked the merchant, rising. "The hour approaches when
  this one displays his shutters. Walk slowly."</p>

  <p>"May your profitable commerce spread like a banyan tree and take root on
  every side," pronounced Wong Tsoi courteously.</p>

  <p>"May swift promotion overtake your righteous footsteps and lead you to a
  more worthy sphere of usefulness," replied Teen King, in a voice equally
  devoid of added meaning.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br>
  At the Extremity of His Resource, the Continent Kai<br>
  Lung Encounters One Who Leads the Unaffected Life</h2>

  <p class="first">At a later period Kai Lung emerged safely from the waste
  marshes of Ying-tze and set his face hopefully toward the mountain range
  beyond, confident that somewhere about those barren heights he would overtake
  Ming-shu and (aided by the ever-protecting spirits of his approving
  ancestors) settle a final and exacting balance with that detested
  upstart.</p>

  <p>But in the meanwhile an arid and unproductive tract of country lay between
  him and the valleys of Ki-che, and the cake of dried paste that had nourished
  him so far had shrunk to a state of no-existence. For a lengthy day he had
  sustained a precarious life on a scanty cup of disconcerting water extracted
  from a laboriously-dug hole, when, at evening, he espied one who wandered to
  and fro with a burden on his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"This, doubtless," considered Kai Lung, "is the forerunner of others, who
  may, by an expedient, be assembled as a crowd, and surely to that, on one
  pretext or another, an applicable story should not prove fruitless."</p>

  <p>He looked anxiously for the gathering signs of habitation that would
  indicate a village street (for a feeling of inadequacy in all his attributes
  was beginning to assail him), but finding none and fearing to miss the
  settlement on the one foot or to increase his weary march upon the other, he
  turned aside, meaning to greet the loiterer whom he had already noted. When
  he had approached sufficiently near to observe the detail, he saw that what
  the stranger carried was a coffin.</p>

  <p>"Alas," exclaimed Kai Lung, "is this, then, so insalubrious a region that,
  when a man goes about his daily task, he takes with him the equipment for his
  obsequies? What scope is there for the storyteller's art in a spot so far
  removed from gravity-dispersal or the leisured amenities of life?" Yet, there
  being none else to question and no abode in sight, he continued on toward
  him. When the other perceived Kai Lung's approaching form, he laid down the
  burden off his shoulders and advanced to meet him.</p>

  <p>"Welcome to this unattractive wilderness," he remarked hospitably. "Your
  becoming name and the number of your blameless years would be an agreeable
  subject for conversation."</p>

  <p>"I am of the worthless house of Kai, my forbidding name being Lung," was
  the reply. "As regards my years--they have been few and quite devoid of
  interest, as this immature pigtail will readily disclose. Now, as regards
  your own distinguished self?"</p>

  <p>"Thang am I, my father's name being presumably illustrious but
  unfortunately misplaced," replied the other. "My ill-spent age exceeds
  two-score by one. By ceaseless toil, I wrest a feeble livelihood from this
  tenacious soil."</p>

  <p>"The occupation is a venerated one in our enlightened land, being only
  second, both as regards honour and inadequacy of reward, to the literary
  calling," replied Kai Lung. "And touching that same office--as between one
  necessitous person and another--is there within not too great a distance from
  this well-favoured spot a refined community who by some stratagem or other
  may be drawn together to listen to an epic from the masterpieces, with a
  reasonable outlook of the narrator being finally rewarded in one form or
  another?"</p>

  <p>"A community!" exclaimed the stranger, enlarging both his eyes. "Know,
  traveler, that the one before you and those beneath his crumbling roof live
  so remote that they do not see an outside face from one moon to another.
  Whence, therefore, could even a sprinkling of bystanders be obtained to
  listen to your pleasing voice?"</p>

  <p>"If this is so," observed Kai Lung dispassionately, "the voice to which
  you so flatteringly refer will very soon cease forever. Yet how comes it that
  you who are an alert and vigorous man have selected a region at once so
  desert and remote?"</p>

  <p>"That," replied the peasant, "is to conform to the integral fitness of
  things. In his milk days, the one before you listened with becoming deference
  to the conversation of persons of every rank of life and studied what they
  said. From what he heard, when they were speaking freely, it was at once
  plain that he himself was so beneath all others both as regards the virtues
  and attainments that it was only seemly for him to withdraw and live apart.
  Accordingly, selecting a lesser one as unworthy as himself, he retired
  unpretentiously to this forgotten spot; for it is related of it that after
  the First Celestial Emperor had formed the earth, he wiped his toil-stained
  hands upon his heaven-born thighs, and this is what fell from him. Being
  neither earth, heaven, nor the region Down Below, it was ignored by the
  deities and protective Forces, so that here there are no winds, dews,
  spontaneous growth, nor variable seasons."</p>

  <p>"Are there then no evilly disposed Beings either?" inquired Kai Lung with
  interest.</p>

  <p>"For some reason or other, they abound," admitted Thang. "Thus, in spite
  of what a fostering care could do, our only he-child-- one who seemed
  destined by his fearless and engaging nature to raise a squalid Line to
  something like an equality with others--came under the malign influence of a
  resentful Spectre that drew his breath away. . . . It is his coffined form
  that I am carrying from place to place to find, if possible, a spot immune
  from harmful spirits."</p>

  <p>"May the Many-eyed One guide your footsteps!" voiced Kai Lung with a look
  of wide compassion. "Your condition is a hapless one. For how, being thus
  bereft, will your weak and trembling shade, when you shall have yourself
  Passed Beyond, obtain either food or raiment?"</p>

  <p>"That is very true, but is it not tolerantly written, 'Even a mole can
  turn its eyes upward?' Within my stricken hut, two sadly deficient
  she-children still remain. If some lenient-minded youth can be persuaded to
  marry one of these, he may, when in a charitable vein, include my shivering
  ghost in the offerings he transmits. As I am well inured to privation here
  below, it is only reasonable to suppose that what is, after all, little more
  than an unsubstantial outline, will be satisfied with even less."</p>

  <p>"It is aptly said, 'The strongest tower is built of single bricks,' and
  your steadfast attitude justifies the saying," remarked Kai Lung. "Did I
  possess anything beyond a general feeling of concavity I would pleasurably
  contribute to your store. As it is, I endow you with the confident prediction
  that your upright House will flourish. Farewell, esteemed." With these words
  and a deferential bow, in which he contrived to indicate his sympathetic
  outlook toward the other's unenviable lot and a regret that the circumstances
  had not conspired toward their more enduring friendship, the weary
  storyteller turned to resume the hopeless struggle of his onward march. An
  unpretentious voice recalled him.</p>

  <p>"Hitherto, a sense of insufficiency restrained me," explained the lowly
  Thang; "for judging from the fullness of your garb and the freedom of your
  manner, I thought you to be a rich official, travelling at ease. If, however,
  as certainly your words may be taken to suggest, you are not really so
  well-equipped and can offer no reward for that which is really worthless, I
  am emboldened to beg your high-born acquaintance of the inadequate resources
  of my makeshift home. The more you can consume, the less will be this
  self-conscious person's shame at the insipidity of what he puts before you;
  the longer you can tolerate his worn-out roof, the greater will be the
  confidence with which he can henceforth continue to dwell beneath it."</p>

  <p>"Yet your humane task?" urged Kai Lung, in spite of the despair of his
  position. "Should so slight a thing as the extremity of a passing stranger
  interrupt your rites?"</p>

  <p>"About the city gate are many beggars, but on the plains all men meet as
  brothers," was Thang's reply. "Furthermore," he added prudently, "were you to
  die about this spot, the duty of providing you with a suitable bestowal would
  devolve upon me, and even then your annoyed and thirsty ghost might haunt my
  door."</p>

  <p>"But you spoke of destitution. If less than a sufficiency for your own
  stock exists, how should another--"</p>

  <p>"Where four can stand at all, five can just squeeze," replied the
  accommodating Thang. "Unless my repellent face displeases you beyond
  endurance, the last word of ceremonious denial has been uttered."</p>

  <p>When they were come to the peasant's hut, Thang excused himself on a
  simple plea for passing in before his guest. From the approaching path Kai
  Lung soon overheard the reason.</p>

  <p>"It had been our natural hope to spend the night in grief and lamentation,
  but chance has sent another--even more faint and needy than ourselves--to
  share our scanty hearth. Sorrow must therefore be banished to a more
  appropriate time, and in the meanwhile nothing should escape to dim the
  lustre of his welcome in this stranger's eyes."</p>

  <p>A lesser voice replied, graceful yet docile:</p>

  <p>"Where the ox clears a way, the sheep can surely follow. . . . There is a
  little cake which I had secretly prepared of fruit and sifted meal, put by
  against the joy-day of our two remaining dear ones. This will to some extent
  disguise the leanness of our ill-spread board, and toward it we can ourselves
  affect a cloyed repugnance."</p>

  <p>"We," said a still smaller voice, "will cheerfully forego our separate
  share to relieve the stranger's need. . . . Have I not spoken with your
  polished tongue, Chalcedony?"</p>

  <p>"Your fragrant words, O Musk, are my own feeble thoughts well set to
  music," was the equally melodious answer.</p>

  <p>"Then we are all agreed"--it was now Thang again. "Conduct the politely
  awaiting stranger to a seat beneath our ragged thatch, ye two uncouth
  afflictions, while I go hence to gather such decaying herbs as our stubborn
  ground affords."</p>

  <p>Kai Lung had moved to a more distant part--so that he should not seem to
  betray too gross an interest in the details of what was being prepared for
  his enjoyment--when the two sympathetic she-children approached together.
  Being dressed alike and so moulded that they varied in no single detail, it
  was beyond an ordinary person's skill to discriminate between them. Their
  years were somewhat short of half a score, and with a most engaging
  confidence each took the storyteller freely by the hand and drew him
  forward.</p>

  <p>"She who leads you by the right hand is Musk," said the one who was thus
  positioned, "the other being Chalcedony. To me no special gift has ever come
  beyond a high discordant voice. Chalcedony can accompany this harmoniously
  with music blown on reeds. What is your attractive name, wayfarer, and are
  you as old as your meritorious aspect would lead one to suppose?"</p>

  <p>When he had replied to these courteous inquiries in suitable terms, the
  one referred to added:</p>

  <p>"Since it is inevitable that we should spend some hours together, how is
  it possible to know one from the other among you when both are perceptibly
  alike?"</p>

  <p>"It is for that very reason that our sounds have been chosen so
  diversely," was the capable reply. "Being two alikes, born at a single birth,
  we have been named so that it is impossible to mistake one for the other, nor
  do either of our revereds ever now fall into so culpable an error. . . . That
  one, remember, is Chalcedony, your base slave here being Musk."</p>

  <p>As Kai Lung reached the door, Thang's lesser one came forth and with a
  look of gladness made him welcome. When he had been protestingly composed
  into the one chair that the meagre hut contained, Musk and Chalcedony again
  approached, and standing one on either side before him sought to beguile his
  weariness by the artless means within their simple power, Musk lifting up her
  resolute voice in a set chant--"The She-child's Invocation"--and Chalcedony
  by no means lagging in the sounds that she extracted from an arrangement of
  pierced reeds. Nor did either desist until the rice appeared and was
  enticingly set out.</p>

  <p>"It is less than would satisfy a family of midgets, and moderately
  self-respecting dogs would turn from it with loathing," remarked Thang,
  bowing before his guest. "It is quite possible, however, that your
  excessively politeness will compel you to make something of a meal. Approach,
  therefore."</p>

  <p>"One hears of the lavishness of rich country nobles," aptly replied Kai
  Lung, standing before the board. "But this--"</p>

  <p>Afterward a small pipe, charged with dried herbs, was passed from hand to
  hand, and tranquillity prevailed. When it was dark and a single paper lantern
  had been lit, they sat upon the floor, and the storyteller claimed that, as a
  circle had been formed, it was, by ancient privilege, incumbent on him to
  gratify their leisure.</p>

  <p>"So that," he added, "the history of Tong So and the story of his
  ingenious rise to honours will linger pleasurably within your minds long
  after all thought of the large-mouthed Kai Lung shall have come to be
  forgotten."</p>

  <p>The discriminating Thang, however, understood that the other wished to
  make some small return for the compassion shown to him, in the only way he
  had. He therefore indicated to Musk and Chalcedony (who were on the point of
  blending their energies in the exposition of a well-laboured ballad entitled
  "The More-desirable Locality") that they should restrain their acknowledged
  zeal, and admitted to Kai Lung that he has now favourable prepared for
  whatever might ensue.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>The Story of Tong So, the Averter of Calamities</em></p>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <h3>How There Fell to Him the Leadership of the Fraternity of Thieves within
  I-kang</h3>

  <p class="first">When Tcheng the Earless, the accepted head and authority of
  the company of thieves that dwelt about I-kang, suddenly Passed Above, all of
  that calling came together to appoint another who should take his place.
  Finally, by an equal choice, the matter lay between Tong So, because he was
  able and discreet above the rest, and Pe-hung, who, though gross and
  boastful, possessed the claim that he was of the House of Tcheng. Those who
  favoured the cause of Tong So dwelt on the need of skill and resource in the
  one who should direct their strategy, while the voices raised on behalf of
  Pe-hung extolled authority and a dutiful submission to the fixed order of
  events.</p>

  <p>"Illustrious brothers," exclaimed Tong So at length, for those who were to
  decide had by that time reached the pass of two wrestlers who are locked in
  an inextricable embrace where neither can prevail, "it is well said among us,
  'Although the door is locked the shutter may be pliant.' The honey of smooth
  speech and the salutary vinegar of abuse having likewise failed to convince,
  it may be judged that the time is to explore another way."</p>

  <p>"Say on," urged those around, for both sides were weary of the strife.
  "may the more integritous cause prevail."</p>

  <p>"What a thousand eloquent words cannot achieve, a single timely action may
  accomplish," continued Tong So. "Let a facile test be set. In the innermost
  secrecy of the Temple of Autumnal Winds there reposes the Green Eye of Nong,
  surrounded by a never-sleeping guard. Whichever of the two shall bear it off,
  let him be acclaimed our head."</p>

  <p>"It is well said," agreed the gathering. "He who performs that feat is
  worthy to be our leader. Furthermore, the value of the spoil will, when
  equally divided, add greatly to the dignity of all."</p>

  <p>Standing somewhat apart, the contumacious Pe-hung would have declined the
  test had that been possible, but to do so then would have involved a greater
  loss of face than even he could stomach, for in the past he had never failed
  to speak of his own skill approvingly. He accordingly sought to attain his
  unworthy end by a more devious line, and while seeming to agree he contrived
  a hidden snare.</p>

  <p>"The trial is a suitable one," he therefore said, " and its accomplishment
  is well within my own indifferent powers. For that reason, and also because
  the idea sprang from the enriched soil of his productive mind, the
  distinction of the first attempt lies clearly with Tong So. Thereafter I will
  speedily outshine whatever glory he may obtain."</p>

  <p>Pe-hung's words, however, were but as the sheaf wherein one holds a
  keen-edged blade, for his inner thoughts ran thus: Tong So will make the
  attempt and be slain by those who guard the jewel. Obviously, it is
  unsuitable for a dead person to be a leader, so that the choice will
  automatically revert to me. Or Tong So will fail in the attempt but escape
  alive. In that case, his ineptitude clearly unfits him to be our chief and
  there will no longer be any opposition to this one's cause. If, however, by
  an unforeseen perversity Tong So should succeed, it will manifestly be
  impossible for another, no matter how competent, to carry away what is no
  longer there, and so the contest fails in its essential. To this end it is
  aptly written, 'he who would feast with vampires must expect to provide the
  meat.'"</p>

  <p>In the darkness of a stormy night, the door-keepers of the Temple of
  Autumnal Winds were aroused by the clash of conflict beyond the outer gate.
  As the repeated cries for help indicated that violence of a very definite
  kind was in progress, they did not deem it courteous to interfere until the
  sound of retiring footsteps and a restored tranquillity announced that the
  virtuous might prudently emerge.</p>

  <p>Outside, they found Tong So bearing all the signs of a speedy departure
  Upward. His robe was torn and earth-stained, his eyes devoid of light, while
  the ground around had been lavishly arranged with bloodshed. To the ordinary
  passerby, finding him thus, only one question would present itself: had those
  who had gone before efficiently performed their sordid task, or was there,
  perchance, something of value still concealed about the unconscious body?</p>

  <p>"Danger lurks here, unless we move our feet with caution," observed the
  chief keeper of the door to the one who served his hand. "Should the
  inopportune wayfarer Pass Beyond in this distressing manner, his offended and
  vindictive ghost will continue to haunt the gate-house, regardless of our
  feelings and of the possible loss of custom to the temple itself which so
  forbidding a visitation may entail."</p>

  <p>"Alas, master," exclaimed the other, "as it is, the gate-house has become
  overcrowded somewhat since the less successful deities have been thrust into
  our keeping. Would it not be well to take this distinguished personage, the
  one by the head and the other by the feet, and unostentatiously convey him to
  the doorway of another before it is too late?"</p>

  <p>"If it could be prudently effected, such a safeguard would undoubtedly be
  wise; if, however, while in the act we encountered a company of his friends
  or the official watchers of the street, no excuse would serve us. Better
  endure the annoyance of another's ghost than incur the probability of
  yielding up our own."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, there is the saying 'He who fails to become a giant need
  not remain content with being a dwarf,' and a middle way may yet be found.
  Beneath the innermost sacrary of the temple there is an empty vault. Should
  this ever-welcome stranger honour us by Passing while reposing in its
  commodious depth, his nobly born apparition will occasion no alarm, for by
  closing the upper and the lower doors we can confine its discreditable
  activities to that secluded region."</p>

  <p>To this proposal the chief doorkeeper turned an assenting ear. Together
  they drew Tong So through the lower door and along a narrow passage, until
  they reached the cave hollowed beneath the walls. Here they left him, first
  securing his robe and whatever else of interest he possessed.</p>

  <p>When Tong So had thus penetrated beyond the outer limits of the temple, he
  allowed a sufficient interval to elapse, and then raised himself out through
  the upper door, using for this purpose a cord that had been wound concealed
  among his hair.</p>

  <p>In the sanctuary above, a band chosen for their vigilance kept guard by
  day and night. It was dark except for the pale lustre round about the jewel,
  for it would have been held disrespectful to the brilliance of the Sacred Eye
  to deem it necessary to require an added light. This favoured Tong So's
  strategy, but, as he crept forward, his benumbed foot struck against a
  column.</p>

  <p>"One moves among us," exclaimed the readiest of the band. "Let each man
  touch his brother's hand, so that nothing may escape between us, and thus go
  forward."</p>

  <p>Tong So pressed back into the wall, compelling his body to merge itself
  into the interstices of the sculptured surface. He closed his eyes, ceased to
  breathe, and composed his mind into an alert tranquility. A hand swept across
  his face as the line moved past, but the rigorous confinement of the cave had
  frozen his outer surface so that its touch in no way differed from that of
  the marble images on either side. The searchers passed on, and presently they
  stood before the farther wall.</p>

  <p>"Nothing can have escaped our discovering hands," declared the leader. "He
  who was here has certainly crept out. Disperse yourselves around the inner
  courts, if haply we may yet take him."</p>

  <p>When they were gone, Tong So came forth from his place of refuge and
  quickly forced the Green Eye from its setting. The jewel secured, he took his
  stand behind the open door and in a simulated voice raised a disturbing
  cry.</p>

  <p>"Ho, keepers of the Sacred Nong, to your stations all! That which we guard
  is assailed by treachery!"</p>

  <p>Like a wave of the flood-driven Whang Ho, back swept the band into the
  darkness of the sanctuary. When all had passed inside and were surging about
  the statue of the despoiled god, Tong So slipped out, drew close the door,
  and made fast the bolt. From that point the way of his escape was easy.</p>

  <p>Memorable in the annals of the heroic brotherhood of thieves within I-kang
  was the night when Tong So returned among them and displayed the great green
  jewel called the Sacred Eye of Nong. A feast was called for the next day, all
  cheerfully contributing from their own store, and when they were assembled,
  Tong So was installed upon a dais with flattering acclamation. Pe-hung alone
  maintained a secluded air, although his gluttonous instincts impelled him to
  push forward at the feast, to which, however, he had contributed less than a
  righteous share. "The larger the shadow grows, the nearer is the sun to
  setting," was his invariable reply to those who taunted him with Tong So's
  success, moreover adding, "And the lizard that essayed to become a crocodile
  burst at the moment of attainment," until presently they ceased to molest
  him.</p>

  <p>When the repast was over, the most elderly person among those present rose
  to express himself, at the same time pointing out the patriarchal length of
  his venerable pigtail in furtherance of his claim to lead their voices. As
  his remarks were chiefly concerned with the inscrutability of the gods, the
  uncertainty of the price and quality of rice-spirit, the insatiable depravity
  of the official watchers of the streets, and the unapproachable perfection of
  his own immediate ancestors, he was thrust somewhat impatiently aside and
  room made for another.</p>

  <p>"The time approaches when the more industrious and less garrulous members
  of our praiseworthy craft would seek the Ways," he reasonably declared, "nor
  is it necessary to procure a sack wherein to bear away a single coin. A
  searching test has been made, and Tong So has conformed to its requirements.
  Is it agreed that he should be our leader?"</p>

  <p>"Haply," interposed the foremost among those who had hitherto opposed Tong
  So's cause, "yet Pe-hung still remains."</p>

  <p>"Inevitably--so long as any food likewise remains," capably replied the
  other. "Does Pe-hung then raise a claim?"</p>

  <p>"The inference is inexact," retorted Pe-hung assertively, "nor is it
  necessary for this person to crave that which devolves by right. Out of a
  courteous regard for his youth and inexperience, Tong So was given the first
  essay, and by chance the jewel fell into his large open hand. Manifestly, it
  is contrary to our just rule that this person should now be set aside because
  through his benevolence the accomplishment of the test is no longer within
  man's power."</p>

  <p>"It is but seemly," declared Tong So, checking with a persuasive glance
  those who would have answered Pe-hung's craft with ridicule. "Yet were the
  possibility still present would you now maintain your former boast that you
  likewise could bear off the jewel?"</p>

  <p>"Assuredly," replied Pe-hung, his confidence enlarged by the impossibility
  of submitting him to the test, "and that by so daring and ingenious a scheme
  that the lustre of the deed would have brought undying honor to our
  fraternity within I-kang."</p>

  <p>"Then let your unassuming heart rejoice at the prospect of our
  well-sustained felicity!" exclaimed Tong So. "Learn now, O fortunate Pe-hung,
  that the Green Eye of Nong again adorns his sacred face and awaits thy supple
  thumb!"</p>

  <p>"It has been recovered?" cried those around. "You have suffered this
  ineptitude?"</p>

  <p>"By no means," replied Tong So, "but, foreseeing this entanglement, I
  caused it to be restored to its socket after displaying it to you, so that no
  ground for dissension should exist among our harmonious band."</p>

  <p>For a measurable space of time, all power of speech was denied even to the
  most fluent tongue. Then those who had favoured Pe-hung burst forth:</p>

  <p>"But the loss to each one of us which this expedient entails--therein you
  have done evilly, Tong So. The value was that of a camel-load of jade."</p>

  <p>"Loss!" exclaimed Tong So reprovingly. "Who speaks of loss while Pe-hung
  still remains? Not only will he duly fulfill his spoken word, but with the
  jewel he will bring back the lusty matter for an offensive song, which
  Chi-ching shall set to music for our winter fires."</p>

  <p>"A full-throated verse shall therein be retained for your pestilential
  virtues, O ill-disposed Tong So!" replied Pe-hung with heavy-laden breath, as
  he made ready to depart. "Lo, I go to efface the memory of your puny
  efforts."</p>

  <p>When he had gone and there remained only Tong So and those who were wholly
  favourable to his cause, that broad minded person further disclosed the
  reason of his course.</p>

  <p>"It is one thing to cast a noose about a tiger's neck," he remarked, "but
  it involves another attitude to conduct it to an awaiting cage. Had we
  retained the sacred relic, the undying enmity of the priests of Nong would
  have sought us out. That, perchance, we might have evaded had it not been
  that those who traffic in such stones one and all refused to face the risk of
  its disposal. Another outlet could doubtless have been found were it not that
  our spoil consisted of a worthless counterfeit, the real gem having been
  abstracted by an earlier one in the distant past. Thus the path of Pe-hung's
  success is fringed by many doubts and harassments, against which it would
  have been well to warn him had he been a person of sympathetic outlook."</p>

  <p>In such a manner Tong So became the chosen leader of the company of
  thieves about I-kang. In this he had their unanimous voice, for Pe-hung was
  never seen again among their haunts. The better-disposed toward him contended
  that he had fallen beneath the vengeance of the priests of Nong during a
  valiant attempt to repossess the jewel. Others, however, claimed that in a
  distant city there was one resembling him in the grossness of his outline who
  endeavoured to extort a meagre livelihood from the large-hearted by publicly
  beating his head and body with a brick. But this does not concern Tong
  So.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <h3>Showing How Slight a Matter Went Hand in Hand with Tong So's Destiny</h3>

  <p>At a convenient spot outside I-kang, where it was well protected from the
  attacks of passing demons by an intersecting gorge, stood the ornamental
  residence of Fan Chin, a retired ginseng merchant.</p>

  <p>In spite of this, Fan Chin did not enjoy an immunity from every kind of
  evil, for, as the proverb says, "however deep you dig a well, it affords no
  refuge in the time of flood," and the distant and solitary position of the
  house encouraged those who were desirous of sharing in Fan Chin's prosperity.
  No matter the fierceness of the hounds he procured or the vigilance of the
  watchers he employed, few moons ever passed without some industrious person
  penetrating beyond his outer walls. Indeed, the hounds frequently attached
  themselves to those who thus intruded, for the training of all creatures of
  this kind lay in the hands of Tong So's associates, while the hired watchers
  were generally those of his company who had for the time found it desirable
  to seek a less violent manner of living owing to some injury received in the
  course of their ordinary occupation.</p>

  <p>So convenient was it to despoil Fan Chin's possessions that Tong So
  himself charitably refrained, in order to encourage deserving but
  inexperienced members of his band or to leave a facile certainty for the aged
  and infirm. It was by such considerate acts that the affection of his
  followers was nourished, so that in time Tong came to be regarded as the
  Father and the Elder Brother of all good thieves.</p>

  <p>One night, toward the middle part of the darkness, Tong So was walking
  with the hunchback Chu when by chance they found themselves outside the walls
  of Fan Chin's garden.</p>

  <p>Up to that point, their discourse had been of a philosophical nature,
  concerned with the Essentials, the Ultimate Destinies, and the like, but
  discovering an iron implement within his sleeve Chu thereupon displayed it
  and began to speak to a more definite end.</p>

  <p>"Ill fortune has of late attended all my efforts, while a misbegotten blow
  from a wooden staff, carried by an officious watcher of the street, has
  corroded my left thumb with acrimony. You also, Tong So, are but sparsely
  clad. Let us therefore accompany one another into the secluded part of this
  well-stocked mansion and there replenish our necessities."</p>

  <p>"The project is a worthy one, and this person would gladly enter into it
  and perform an allotted part, were it not that for a specific reason he has
  hitherto refrained," replied Tong So candidly. "Nevertheless, without
  requiring any share of the expected profit, he will cheerfully remain here in
  an alert attitude and will at once fell to the ground any who should attempt
  to impede your intrepid progress."</p>

  <p>Upon this understanding, Chu went forward and quickly forced his way into
  the remoter portions of the house. The watchers whom he encountered greeted
  him familiarly and courteously indicated in which direction the path of
  safety lay. Thus guided, Chu had no difficulty in filling his sack with
  suitable merchandise, and was on the point of withdrawing when the avaricious
  Fan Chin, whom an unworthy suspicion had kept awake, suddenly appeared at an
  angle of the wall. He was heavily armed at every point of his attitude, while
  the hunchback's movements were involved with the burden under which he
  staggered. In this extremity, it would have gone doubtfully with Chu had he
  not already resourcefully filled his mouth from a flask of Fan Chin's raisin
  wine against such an emergency. The stream of this he now vigorously
  propelled into the other person's menace-laden face, compelling him to drop
  the weapons in order to clear his eyes of liquid bitterness.</p>

  <p>As Tong So and Chu again turned their steps toward I-kang, they resumed
  their former discourse, nor did either refer to the details of the
  undertaking until they reached the parting of their ways. There the latter
  person raised a detaining gesture.</p>

  <p>"Although you have not actually shared in the full flavour of the
  adventure, yet by remaining aggressively outside and by sustaining me with
  your virtuous encouragement, you have undoubtedly played an effective part.
  Accompany me, therefore, to my criminally acquired hovel and there select
  from this much distended sack whatever is deemed worthy of your tolerant
  acceptance."</p>

  <p>"The suggestion is a gracious one," replied Tong So, "and fittingly
  illustrates the high standard of benevolence which marks those of our band.
  Observe how the sordid-stomached Fan had been in possession of these goods
  for a score of years or more, but never during that period had he once
  invited this necessitous person to share the most attenuated fraction of his
  store; yet no sooner do they pass into your hands than you freely bestow on
  me the fullness of my choice."</p>

  <p>"Your indulgent words cover me with honourable confusion," stammered the
  gratified Chu. "How should I divide an egg with you, who are my father and my
  elder brother too?"</p>

  <p>Conversing in this mutually helpful manner, they reached the hunchback's
  home. Here they quickly made themselves secure and then proceeded to display
  the rewards of their industry. These included wares and utensils of many
  kinds, silks and fabrics from the walls and seats, suitable apparel as well
  as coverings for the head, the ears and feet, food of the richer sorts, and
  here and there a silver-mounted carving.</p>

  <p>"Beneath my decayed but hospitable roof all things are yours," declared
  Chu, indicating by a gesture that he pushed the entire contents of the sack
  away from him.</p>

  <p>"That which grows on the tree of enterprise should be eaten off the
  bough," replied Tong So no less generously, and he was indicating by means of
  a like gesture that he renounced all claim to any part thereof when the
  vigour of his action laid bare an object which an inadvertent movement on
  Chu's part had hitherto successfully concealed beneath the sack.</p>

  <p>"--Nevertheless," continued Tong So as he took it up and regarded it with
  deepening interest, "a solitary fruit may sometimes legitimately fall into
  the basket of another. Whence blows this fragrant peach?" and he held out the
  depicted image of a maiden of surpassing charm, traced with inspired skill
  upon a plate of ivory set in a golden frame.</p>

  <p>"Doubtless it was hidden away among the folds of a piece of silk and thus
  escaped our scrutiny," replied Chu freely. "Humiliating as the admission is,
  this person will not deny that he had until now no inkling of this
  distinguished prize."</p>

  <p>"There will then be no sense of loss in its withdrawal," observed Tong
  pleasantly. "Out of the bountiful flood of your opulent profusion, O worthy
  Chu, this one object alone will I accept. From this resolve do not attempt to
  move me."</p>

  <p>For an appreciable moment it seemed doubtful whether the hunchback would
  tamely submit to this decision, so deep and wide was the stream of his
  devotion, but at the sight of Tong So's impassive face he bent an acquiescent
  neck.</p>

  <p>"Truly it is written, 'It is better to keep silence than yield wisdom,' "
  was his discreet reply. "I bow, chieftain."</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <h3>His meeting with Fan Chin and the Manner of His Many-Sided Qualities</h3>

  <p>On the following day, Tong So again turned his footsteps in the direction
  of Fan Chin's mansion, but this time he went alone. At the outer gate he
  spoke little, but that to a pointed edge, and the one who held the bolt
  admitted him, so that very soon he stood face to face with Fan Chin
  himself.</p>

  <p>"Greeting," remarked Tong So affably. "Have you eaten your meritorious
  rice?"</p>-

  <p>"So much of it as an ill-nurtured outcast has generously left behind him,"
  replied Fan Chin, indicating the despoiled confusion of the room.
  "Nevertheless, you are cheerfully welcome if you have anything to reveal." He
  was a man of middle height, dispassionate in manner and evenly balanced in
  his speech. From time to time he caressed an eye with a cloth of some soft
  fabric.</p>

  <p>"Your moments are as pearls, while my worthless hours are only comparable
  with lumps of earth; therefore I will trim short my all-too-wordy tongue,"
  was the reply. "In the deeper solitude of the night, this person chanced upon
  two who strove over the division of their spoil. By a subtlety he possessed
  himself of that which they most esteemed. This he would now justly return to
  the one who can prove his undisputed right."</p>

  <p>"What you say is very surprising, especially as you yourself have all the
  outward attributes of a hired assassin," replied Fan Chin, after a moment's
  thought. "Can reliance be placed upon your mere assertion?"</p>

  <p>"There are four witnesses here to all that I declare; how then can
  anything but the truth be spoken?"</p>

  <p>"Four witnesses?" repeated Fan Chin, to whom this form of testimony was
  evidently unknown. "Disclose yourself."</p>

  <p>"The heavens above, the earth beneath, and the two who here converse
  together," explained Tong So.</p>

  <p>"That is undeniable," admitted Fan. "On the whole I am inclined to credit
  what you say."</p>

  <p>"Furthermore," continued Tong, "here is the painted plate of ivory held in
  a band of gold," and he displayed the painting that had been the mainspring
  of his actions. "Is not this a valued part of your possessions?"</p>

  <p>"There can no longer be any reasonable scruple as to your integrity,"
  exclaimed Fan Chin. "You have restored that which alone occasioned an emotion
  of regret."</p>

  <p>"Doubtless," assented Tong So; "yet there is an up and a down to every
  hill, and having convinced you of my virtuous sincerity it now devolves on
  you to satisfy me of yours."</p>

  <p>"The angle of your misgiving remains somewhat obtuse to my deficient
  mind," admitted Fan Chin. "Fill in the outline of your distrust."</p>

  <p>"On the back of the plate of ivory there are traced these words in
  characters of gold, 'Tsing Yung, of the righteous House of Fan.' Produce,
  therefore, the one thus described so that the similitude may stand revealed,
  and the essence of your claim is undisputable."</p>

  <p>At this bold challenge, the nature of Fan Chin's breathing changed and he
  walked round the room several times before he could frame his lips to a
  sufficiently discreet reply.</p>

  <p>"The requirement is unusual," he replied at length, "though the
  circumstances are admittedly out of the common. But, in any case, that which
  you ask is unattainable. The one depicted is the least of those of my inner
  chamber, and to add to the burden of this person's harassment she now lies
  suspended in the vapours of a malign distemper."</p>

  <p>"Then it is not unlikely that my intervention has been brought about by
  the protecting powers, desirous of our mutual happiness," declared Tong So
  with confidence. "In the past I rendered a certain service to a learned
  anchorite who in return disclosed to me many healing virtues of the hidden
  kind. What is the nature of the stricken one's malady?"</p>

  <p>"It takes the form of a dark stupor, whereby the natural forces of the
  mind and body are repressed. To counteract this, an expert healer from the
  Capital counselled a decoction prepared from tiger's bones."</p>

  <p>"The remedy is well enough, but there are subtler and more potent drugs
  than tigers' bones," said Tong with some impatience. "Moreover, you who have
  been a ginseng merchant doubtless know that every bin has two components.
  Were the bones submitted to a searching test?"</p>

  <p>"A lavish price was paid and a thumb-signed assurance of integrity was
  given. What added precaution could have been taken?"</p>

  <p>"Do any still remain?" demanded Tong.</p>

  <p>Fan Chin summoned an attendant and issued a command. This one quickly
  returned with some broken fragments, which at a sign he placed before Tong
  So. The latter blew shrilly from between his teeth, and the next moment the
  largest and fiercest of Fan Chin's watchdogs leaped among them in answer to
  the call and fawned upon Tong So.</p>

  <p>"Oiya!" cried the one in question and threw toward it the weightiest of
  the pieces; without a moment's hesitation the hound caught it between
  expectant jaws and fled in the direction of its lair, closely followed by the
  bewailing Fan, striving to recover his possession.</p>

  <p>"Restrain your ineffective zeal," exclaimed Tong So. "You are pursuing the
  wrong dog if you look for restitution."</p>

  <p>"Which dog is that?" asked Fan Chin, gazing round expectantly. "I see no
  other than the hound escaping."</p>

  <p>"The one from whom these goat ribs were procured. Where does the usurious
  mongrel dwell?"</p>

  <p>"He is Sheng, the son of Ho, carrying on his necessary traffic beneath the
  Sign of the Magnanimous Pestle, and spoken of as both upright and exact."</p>

  <p>Tong So drew a figured ring from off his thumb and gave it to the awaiting
  slave.</p>

  <p>"Hitherto," he remarked in an unsympathetic voice, "traffic with Ho Sheng
  has doubtless been on a somewhat mutual basis, thou equivocal bondman.
  Enlighten that obscene refuse chafferer as to what has taken place and
  displaying this very ordinary ring before his shortsighted eyes require of
  him a double measure in place of what he has fraudulently withheld. To this
  add that he who sends requires no thumb-signed bond, but should the fiercest
  hound not tremble and retreat before the bones he now provides, on the morrow
  the emblem of his sign will be changed from the Magnanimous Pestle to the
  Disconnected Hand. To this obsequious message append the name of Tong So, and
  let your sandals be in shreds on your return."</p>

  <p>"I listen and obey, high chieftain," replied the submissive slave.</p>

  <p>When they were alone again, Fan Chin turned toward his visitor and spoke
  with some reserve.</p>

  <p>"Your name and your general line of conduct remind me of what I have heard
  concerning one who haunts the secluded Ways. Is it unreasonable to conjecture
  that you cast the same shadow as that of So, of the line of Tong, who is the
  admitted leader to the thieves about I-kang?"</p>

  <p>"To deny it would be superfluous," replied Tong So. "My revered father was
  of that craft before me, and his venerated sire likewise in turn. How then
  should I, without being unfilial to a criminal degree, seem to disparage
  their hallowed memories by rejecting what was good enough for them?"</p>

  <p>"That certainly is a point of view which cannot lightly be dismissed,"
  confessed Fan Chin, who was a staunch upholder of tradition. "In the past
  this person himself had leanings toward the insidious craving of a literary
  career, until he saw, as in a vision, seven generations of ginseng-providing
  ancestors beckoning him to follow. Recognizing the brink on which he stood,
  the one who is now speaking immediately burned all that he had written,
  together with the varied utensils of the art, with the happy result that
  today he is able to command a congratulatory ode of any length whenever he
  feels the need of one, instead of merely having to compose them for the
  delectation of another."</p>

  <p>"It is well said that there are three of every man: that which he is, that
  which he only thinks he is, and that which he really had intended to become,"
  agreed Tong So. "In the meanwhile, this person would seek, by tracing the
  origin of the adorable Tsing Yun's disorder to its hidden source and there
  controlling its malignity, to establish a claim on your approval."</p>

  <p>"It would be inept to spread a fabric of evasion between our mutually
  straightforward minds," replied Fan Chin, as one who strives to be urbane and
  at the same time to disclose an unpalatable truth. "Already you have
  appreciably risen in my esteem since the first moment of our meeting, but
  your inopportune profession stands as an ever-present barrier against an
  alliance of a really definite kind. In any other direction, doubtless our
  congenial feet may continue side by side."</p>

  <p>"Yet," pleaded Tong, "by the exercise of a frugal industry I should soon
  be in a position to lay before you an adequate proposal. Hitherto I have
  regarded the pecuniary side of our venture with a perhaps undeserved
  contempt, but the business is one that is admittedly capable of a wide
  development under more vigorous methods, and if only inspired by a
  well-founded hope of the one whom I have named, very soon the puny records of
  the past will be obliterated--"</p>

  <p>"Forbear!" exclaimed Fan Chin in an access of dismay. "Already the
  insatiable rapacity of your never-tiring band is such that this careworn
  person would gladly submit to a yearly tribute of a hundred taels of silver
  to be preserved from their assault. If these activities should be increased,
  a flood deeper than the Yangtse will sweep over the awakening growth of our
  mutual esteem."</p>

  <p>"Yet if, on the other hand, you should be wholly freed from the exaction,
  would you then be impelled to regard this person in the light of a favoured
  suppliant for the lady Tsing Yun's lotus hand?"</p>

  <p>"That is a longer stride than one of my age can take forward at a single
  step," said Fan Chin guardedly. "The tree of reciprocal goodwill would
  certainly be cherished by such an act, but the obstacle of the means whereby
  your rice is earned remains."</p>

  <p>"To change that, even were it possible in this strenuously competitive
  era, would risk alienating the protective spirits of my ancestors," remarked
  Tong So. "Unless," he mused thoughtfully, "unless, indeed, by some adroit
  syncretism the conflicting elements could be harmoniously reconciled so as to
  appeal to all."</p>

  <p>"My moss-grown ears--?" interposed Fan Chin politely.</p>

  <p>"A passing invocation to the deities," apologized Tong So. "But touching a
  possible arrangement of our various interests. May the suggestion of
  five-score taels of silver be regarded as a concrete proposition?"</p>

  <p>"The remark was more in the nature of a flower of conversation than a
  specific offer," replied Fan Chin, somewhat annoyed that he had thus
  incautiously named so formidable an amount. "Even allowing for the most
  ruthless energy of your painstaking crew, the full annual tale of their
  depredation would not approach that sum."</p>

  <p>"Yet there are incidental contingencies from which an assured immunity
  cannot be weighed in a money-changer's scale even against fine gold,"
  suggested Tong, meeting Fan Chin's drooping eye sympathetically. "But among
  obliging friends a tael more or a tael less does not lead to strife. Assuming
  that five-score could be laid before my trustworthy gang as a basis for
  discussion--?"</p>

  <p>"You have spoken of your knowledge of the hidden qualities of healing
  things," remarked Fan Chin, turning abruptly from both the subject and the
  path that they had been treading; "let us approach the one who stands in need
  of such an art and put your subtlety to a deciding test. Afterward,
  perchance, a jar of almond wine may be unsealed and matters of a varied kind
  discussed."</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <h3>In Which He Becomes Both Virtuous and Esteemed</h3>

  <p>When it was passed from mouth to mouth among the thieves throughout I-kang
  that an assembly had been called of the full Brotherhood, to which all were
  summoned on pain of ejectment from the Order's protection and estate, it was
  understood that affairs of distinguished moment were involved. In the face of
  so emphatic a command none ventured to abstain, so that when Tong So entered
  he saw before him all who recognized his leadership, whatever their degree.
  His first act, after the ceremonious rite of greeting, was to require a
  written tablet of their names and attributes, and this being taken, it was
  thereupon declared to form a full and authentic record of the Guild, with all
  other thieves outside.</p>

  <p>"Let each one present now declare against his name the yearly sum of taels
  that his industry procures, judging it as he reasonably thinks fit, but with
  the full assurance that the sum once set down stands for good or ill
  unchangeable."</p>

  <p>"Imperishable chief," ventured one, whose calling it was to steal tribute
  rice on its passage to the north (voicing the dilemma of many of his
  fellows), "we be mostly men of stunted minds and alien to the subtleties that
  lurk in the casting of accounts. Could but an indication of the outcome of
  this affair be given, it would greatly assist our stolid wits."</p>

  <p>"One with enough wit to draw out an axle-pin while walking on his hands
  beside a cart, need not tremble at the task," replied Tong So, amid a general
  melting of their gravity. "Whether it be to reward you according to your
  proficiency or to tax you in the light of your success will presently
  appear."</p>

  <p>"Doubtless you, as our ever-cherished leader, will be the first one to
  attest?" suggested another hopefully.</p>

  <p>"Not first but last, according to my unconquerable regard for your
  superior virtues," politely declared Tong.</p>

  <p>Thus baffled, as it were, each one considered well and in the declared
  himself according to his exact knowledge, lest haply he might fall upon the
  wrong extreme. When this was done, Tong so stood up again.</p>

  <p>"In the past, we of this Brotherhood have laboured strenuously for an
  inadequate reward and have had, moreover, to endure the maledictory word of
  every rival. The powerful mandarin, holding toward each suppliant three
  expectant hands, the lesser official, pursuing the tribute-payer with three
  unrelenting feet, the merchant blending among that which is costly that which
  is similar but cheap, the stall-keeper propelling a secret jet of wind
  against the trembling balance of his scale, even the beggar in the Way,
  displaying that upon his body which is not really there--all these do not
  hesitate to extend toward us the venomed tongue of calumny. Who considers the
  perilous nature of our enterprise, its hidden dangers, its sudden alarms, its
  frequent disappointments where in much that appears solid and of good repute
  by the feeble rays of the great sky lantern proves to be hollow or of
  fictitious lustre when submitted to a corrosive test by the one to whom we
  offer it? Does any man ask us as we enter to remove our sandals and recline
  at ease, any maiden greet us with tea and a song of welcome? Plainly we are
  no longer wanted in I-kang. Thus positioned, we will toil no more. It is
  better to live in luxurious idleness than to labour for a meagre wage and
  salt our rice with broadcast words of scorn."</p>

  <p>"Assuredly," interposed one of some authority, as Tong So paused to take
  up a cup. "Your lips drop rubies, chieftain, but when picked up they
  transmute to points of fire. For if we toil not at our craft, whence comes
  the means to live in any state?"</p>

  <p>"You are plainly behind your era, worthy Li, and your deliberative type of
  mind is fast becoming obsolete," replied Tong So. "Henceforth, instead of
  being compelled to take what we desire by stealth or force, men will freely
  press it into our awaiting hands and greet us with regard and courtesy. The
  distinction hangs upon a subtle word: instead of working, we will covenant to
  abstain, and thus by our unanimity protect from loss those whom hitherto we
  have endeavoured to despoil."</p>

  <p>"The outlook is so attractive that it must inevitably conceal some hidden
  spring to take us unaware," said one. "Men will not consent thus to reward us
  to remain in idleness."</p>

  <p>"Bend then your ears," replied Tong So, "and listen to the scroll of those
  who are already pledged: Fan Chin, a retired ginseng merchant, in
  consideration of a hundred taels less five; Ling-hi, who keeps a den, for
  twenty-eight; Hi-eng, the dog-butcher, at two-score and a half; Tang-tso, of
  late reputed to possess a million taels, who offers twice what any other
  pays; Fung-san, at the Sign of the Upright Tooth Remover--but why drive home
  a wooden skewer with an iron mace? Be assured that already to each man will
  fall more than he earned by toil, and before a final count is made his
  portion will be double."</p>

  <p>"How then shall we contrive to pass our time?" inquired another
  rapturously. "We who shall henceforth be as mandarins walking the earth!"</p>

  <p>"Thus and thus," replied Tong, as this became a general cry. "In the
  morning you will doubtless remain undisturbed or smoke a fragrant pipe among
  your kind. After the middle-rice, attired in seemly robes and moving
  leisurely beneath a shading umbrella, you will approach those on our scroll
  whose dues have run their course, be graciously received, and give an
  official seal (the only form of evidence we shall recognize) for that which
  you receive. To each one will be apportioned a certain limit of the city, and
  as you make this dignified and pleasurable round, you will look from side to
  side and observe such houses as do not display our Company's protective sign.
  At each of these you will present yourself in turn, pointing out to the one
  whose ear you gain the peril of his case, warningly--but at the same time
  enlivening the argument by appropriate jests and instances. Of all the
  profits due to your persuasive threats, an added share falls to your sleeve,
  beyond your general portion."</p>

  <p>"This is the Golden Age of the Han dynasty returned," murmured one whose
  method was to enter into conversation with whom he could entice by
  confidence. "But assuredly we shall very soon awaken."</p>

  <p>"In the evening," continued Tong alluringly, "you will perhaps give
  yourself to homely mirth among those of your choice, to witnessing a play of
  a kind according to your mood, or, in season, to planting the earth around
  your flower-clad bower. Soon, in the fullness of your leisure and content,
  some may even become immersed in the art of attempting to ensnare fish upon a
  cord, in propelling a resilient core from point to point across a given space
  by means of weighted clubs, or in regulating the various necessary details of
  the city's management. And when, in the course of time, you Pass Beyond, you
  will lie in well-appointed tombs and your Tablets will be kept. If any should
  dissent from the prospect thus held out let him now speak freely."</p>

  <p>"Your vision is that of an above-man, chieftain, and a monument of many
  heights will certainly be erected to your immortal name," a voice at length
  declared. "Yet this one pitfall still remains. Men of dissolute and
  improvident habit from other cities will from time to time pass through
  I-kang, and by unscrupulously robbing those whom we are pledged to guard will
  bring us to disrepute."</p>

  <p>Tong So looked round on the company that wrought his will and raised his
  hand with a gesture of all-confidence.</p>

  <p>"It is foreseen," he replied in a level voice, "and the hazard will be
  met. We know the Ways by day and night; we know each other and those who are
  not of our confederacy; and we know the Means. Those who come will not
  return, and that which is had away will be restored in full, to the
  vindication of our unbending name. Aught else?"</p>

  <p>They made way for the next with laughter and applause: an aged man named
  Jin, who was proficient in only the simplest forms of crime.</p>

  <p>"Gracious commander," said the ancient diffidently, "I who speak am beyond
  the years of pliant change, having been a robber of the commoner sort outside
  the memory of most. Now touching this new-garbled plan whereby we are to lift
  fish on a noose, or armed with a heavy club to go openly by light of day into
  the houses of those who display a certain sign--"</p>

  <p>"Set your mind at rest, honest Jin," declared Tong reassuringly. "None
  shall depossess you from your timeworn way." He came down and took the
  venerable affectionately by the shoulder, adding in his ear, "There will
  always be those who would obstinately withstand our proffered help, to whom
  persuasion--in its various forms--must be administered. Do not despair."</p>

  <p>Thus in the eleventh of the Heaven-sent Emperor Yung, Tong So became the
  first who undertook to insure to those who bargained with him protection
  against loss. Being now rich and well-esteemed, Fan Chin no longer maintained
  a barrier before his hopes, nor, it is to be assumed, did the spirits of his
  discriminating ancestors regard him as having transgressed their honourable
  traditions in any essential detail, for they continued to uphold him in his
  virtuous career. So zealously inclined and sought-after did he soon become
  that on the occasion of his marriage with the enchanting Tsing Yun he caused
  to be erected a many-tiered place of commerce at the meeting of the four
  busiest streets within I-kang, and outside this he hung a sign of polished
  brass, embellished with these words:</p>

  <p class="smcap"
     style="text-align:center">Tong So<br>
  Averter of Calamities</p><br>

  <p>In time he added to the nature of his commerce protection from the peril
  of fire, of being drawn under the wheels of passing chariots, and the like.
  Yet in spite of his benevolent concern for the misfortunes of others, he was
  not wholly devoid of enemies, and these did not hesitate to declare that
  while Tong So could--and admittedly did--restrain his outrageous band from
  despoiling those who bought exemption, he was no demon to grant immunity from
  fire and the contingencies of life. To this narrow-minded taunt the really
  impartial would reply that if some among those who sought Tong's aid might
  occasionally experience fire or fatal injury, all those who stubbornly
  refused to do so inevitably did.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V.<br>
  The Meeting by the Way with the Warrior of Chi-U and What Emerged
  Therefrom</h2>

  <p class="first">At daybreak Kai Lung left the scanty hut of the hospitable
  Thang, and that obliging person accompanied him to the boundary of his
  knowledge.</p>

  <p>"Before you now," he declared significantly, as they passed at the point
  of his return, "there lies an unknown and therefore, presumably, a barbarous
  and immoral country, doubtless peopled by wild and unintellectual tribes. Few
  travellers have reached our clay-souled plain from the quagmires of Ying-tze,
  but out of these misty slopes that lead through interminable valleys to the
  very peaks of Teen no message has ever come. It would be well for you, Kai
  Lung, to consider again before you tempt the doubtful Forces lying in wait
  for you ahead. The demons here are bad enough, but those elsewhere may prove
  much worse."</p>

  <p>"That is a necessary evil to be faced," was the frank admission. "But I
  place very great reliance on the energetic influence of my ancestors Above. I
  do not despair of their invoking an even more potent band of worthy Powers to
  lend their aid, and my lucky ascendant has certainly so far triumphed."</p>

  <p>"The connection between your auspicious number and this one's misguided
  age is both conclusive and exact," acknowledged Thang, to whom the
  storyteller had disclosed the obliging soothsayer's prediction. "Still, it is
  as well not to push these auguries too far: there is generally a concealed
  spring in them that releases itself when least expected. May your virtuous
  Line prosper in the end, however. Keen eyes and quick-moving feet in the face
  of danger is the last wish of the abject Thang."</p>

  <p>"May all the felicities ultimately be yours," was Kai Lung's no less
  staunch rejoinder. "Were there no darkness, we should never see the stars,
  but by the light of your compassion the planets cease to be. Much happiness,
  esteemed."</p>

  <p>At a distance they raised their hands again, Thang waving a short woollen
  cap that he wore about his ears, and Kai Lung lifting his almost deficient
  scrip high upon his staff. Beyond, an intervening barrier of rock hid them
  from one another.</p>

  <p>As Kai Lung approached the border town of Chi-U, he could not fail to
  notice that a feeling of anticipation was in the air. Kites in the form of
  aggressive dragons floated above every point likely to incur assault, and
  other protective measures were not lacking, while the almost continuous
  discharge of propitiatory crackers could be heard even before the mud walls
  appeared in sight.</p>

  <p>"All this," argued Kai Lung, "may not unreasonably concern Ming-shu and
  his invading host. Thus ambiguously positioned, it would be well to enter
  into affable conversation with one of leisured habit before disclosing myself
  too fully."</p>

  <p>With this inoffensive object, the storyteller looked for some wayfarer
  whom he might casually approach with an unstudied request about the
  gong-stroke of the day, or to whom he might haply predict a continuance of
  heat. But all those whom he observed were at a distance and moving with
  extreme rapidity in one director or another--those from the east flying to
  the west as though in no other way could they preserve their lives, and those
  from the west pressing on to the east as if pursued by demons.</p>

  <p>"It is well said, 'Men fear the noise more than they dread the missile,' "
  considered Kai Lung. "Rumour is here at work."</p>

  <p>At length one who neither hastened nor glanced back approached, but so
  assured was the dignity of his bearing, and his attire so rich, that had the
  circumstances been less urgent than they were, Kai Lung would not have
  ventured to address him. The stranger had something of a martial poise,
  although he bore no weapon; instead, he carried in one hand a polished cane
  from which an eager bird, attached by a silken cord, sprang divertingly into
  the air from time to time and caught a fleeting seed cast in its direction;
  from about the other arm a substantial rope, with one end fashioned as a
  noose, depended. His nails were long and delicately sheathed, his skin like
  the outer surface of a well-grown peach, and as he moved his person diffused
  an attractive perfume even when several paces distant.</p>

  <p>"Greetings, high eminence," was Kai Lung's obsequious salutation. "Has
  your rice settled?"</p>

  <p>Without exactly replying in terms that would infer acceptance of this
  courtesy, the other made an indifferent gesture of assent and then began to
  regard Kai Lung more closely.</p>

  <p>"You have not the appearance of being a Chi-U man," he remarked with some
  display of interest. "Are you from the waste lands of the south?"</p>

  <p>"For such and such a length of days I have journeyed on a northward track,
  seeking a certain end," was the reply. "Say on, magnificence."</p>

  <p>"I am in this difficulty: If I am to Pass Upward and rejoin my celestial
  ancestors under the most propitious sign it is very necessary that I should
  find a suitable banyan tree, growing in a valley that affords protection
  against spirits drifting from the east and west," explained the stranger; "my
  lucky direction being north and south, and the banyan my adopted tree. Have
  you, in your passage, marked such a spot?"</p>

  <p>"Yet how comes it," ventured Kai Lung, "that you, who appear to possess
  all that an ordinary person could desire, should wish to self-end your being
  so unpleasantly?" and he indicated the cord that the other carried.</p>

  <p>"It is better to miss a few superfluous years here below than to go
  through all eternity in the form of a headless trunk," replied the one who
  thus forecast his own misshapen future. "Being over-captain of the
  Ever-Valiant Camp of Tiger-Eating Braves stationed about Chi-U this one is
  bidden to attack the impure Ming-shu's rebellious lair without delay and to
  send that corrupt leper's obscene head to the Capital as a badge of his
  submission. This being clearly impossible, my own head will be held forfeit
  and it is to avoid this distressing humiliation that it becomes necessary to
  act thus and thus."</p>

  <p>"Yet why, with so valorous a troop of death-deriders, headed by one whose
  mere appearance is calculated to strike despair into the hearts of the
  prudent and diffuse, should it be possible for the effete Ming-shu to defy
  your band?"</p>

  <p>"That," was the reply, "arises from the complexity of our military system.
  Three hundred braves are the avowed total of this one's company, but in order
  to foster a becoming spirit of thrift the monthly inadequacy of taels is
  computed for half that number."</p>

  <p>Kai Lung experienced a moment of regret that so many of those whom he had
  hoped to join in an attack on Ming-shu's fastness should be, as it were,
  struck down at the very outset. The emotion passed.</p>

  <p>"There is a saying in the books, 'Two willing men can cleave a passage
  through the rock while four pressed slaves are moistening their hands,' " he
  remarked. "Seven or eight score valiants would set Ming-shu at naught and so
  uphold your face."</p>

  <p>"Perchance," agreed the other, "but the path from the office of the Board
  of Warlike Deeds and Achievements, in the Capital, to the door of the
  military stronghold here in Chi-U, is both long and tortuous, and whoever
  travels it must receive the protection of many important officials on the
  way. There is the immaculate President of the Board itself, who checks the
  silver out on leaving, and the incorruptible civil overling here, who counts
  it on arriving, while between lurk the administrators of three districts, the
  chief mandarins of eight townships, and the head-men of seventeen villages.
  All these integritous persons are alert to see that the consignment has not
  suffered attrition in its passage through the previous zone, and each has a
  large and instinctively prehensile hand. Thus and thus--"</p>

  <p>"Excellence," besought Kai Lung, not without misgivings, "how many
  warriors, each having some actual existence, are there in your never-failing
  band?"</p>

  <p>"For all purposes save those of attack and defence, there are fifteen
  score of the best and bravest, as their pay-sheets well attest," was the
  confident response. "In a strictly literal sense, however, there are no more
  than can be seen on a mist-enshrouded day with a resolutely closed eye."</p>

  <p>"None, illustriousness! Not one with which to bring the unanswerable
  Ming-shu to justice?"</p>

  <p>In the ensuing pause the over-captain threw a dexterous succession of
  choice seeds to the expectant bird and applauded its unfailing effort.</p>

  <p>"Despite all that a sordid economy can accomplish, there remains only so
  much--after allowing barely enough to maintain the one essential officer in a
  state befitting his position--as will keep the three hundred uniforms and the
  flags and banners of the imperishable company in a seemly condition of
  repair," replied the other. "That, and something inevitable in the way of
  joy-making and esteem-promoting when the appointed red-knob journeys hither
  to survey the band."</p>

  <p>"Yet if the band is in a state of no-existence, does not disgrace ensue
  from that same one's report?"</p>

  <p>"Wherefore, if the necessary formalities have been becomingly observed and
  mutual politeness reigns? Fifteen-score hard-striving and necessitous persons
  are never lacking in Chi-U, who for the honourable distinction and a few
  assorted cash are willing through a passing hour or two to obey the simpler
  signals of command and to answer to a name."</p>

  <p>The sugared seed being no longer offered, the brilliant captive poised on
  the apex of the upraised rod and folded its tranquil wings. The stilling
  point of yellow took Kai Lung's eye with a deeper meaning. " 'A golden bud
  set on a leafless stem,' " leaped his immediate thought. "There is more than
  the outer husk herein."</p>

  <p>"In this affair of Ming-shu, however," he prompted, speaking at a hazard
  and merely to detain the stranger, "does not your meritorious service in the
  past call for official mildness?"</p>

  <p>"That which is only painted should not be washed too often," replied the
  over-captain with broad-minded resignation. "Therefore, if you can aid this
  person's search to what he now requires, do not refrain, and the obliged
  shade of Hai Shin will speak a good word for you in season."</p>

  <p>"Truly, importance," agreed Kai Lung, "yet this matter is not one that can
  be settled as between the drinking of a cup of tea and the filling of
  another. In your illustrious proximity this one now recognizes the
  fulfillment of an inspired portent. Have you, on your side, no indication of
  his menial presence?"</p>

  <p>"There certainly was a remark made by a priestly mendicant, to whom I
  threw a doubtful coin at the Camel Gate," replied Hai Shin. "This was to the
  effect that 'Even a paper leopard can put a hornless sheep to flight,' but
  the analogy is admittedly abstruse."</p>

  <p>"High prominence!" exclaimed Kai Lung joyfully. "Surely nothing could be
  more pellucid in its crystal depth. As a leopard is the symbol of indomitable
  valour, what could so explicitly proclaim your own consternating image? And
  inasmuch as this one is a minstrel and reciter of written tales, the
  reference to paper is exact. How apter could the invincible alliance of the
  two persons standing here be classically portrayed? The paper leopard: device
  and intrepidity."</p>

  <p>"The simile might strike the undiscerning as coming somewhat from a
  distance," conceded Hai Shin, not altogether unimpressed. "But who is to be
  sought in the allusion to a hornless sheep?"</p>

  <p>"Who, high commander? Who but the promiscuous Ming-shu, for what could be
  more truly said to counterfeit the goat than to forego an assured life for
  the uncertain fruit of insurrection?--but a goat whose horns are predestined
  to be very closely shorn by your all-conquering sword."</p>

  <p>"The prospect is not wholly devoid of glamour," the over-captain agreed,
  "but how are we, the one being an unspecified retailer of delusive fables and
  the other a fugitive devoid of followers, to overthrow Ming-shu-- camped in a
  mountain stronghold and surrounded by armed men?"</p>

  <p>"Is it not written, 'Every hedge has a rotten stake somewhere?' Ming-shu's
  defence will prove no exception to the rule. What cannot be pushed in by
  force may yet be drawn out by guile. This involves a stratagem."</p>

  <p>"If you have any definite plan, it might be worth considering," admitted
  the other, "but the prospect of a speedy and not inglorious end--especially
  at an hour when the very cracks of hell are voiding their vapour upward to
  consume us-- compares favourably with a long-drawn-out and speculative
  existence," and he continued to fan himself at leisure. "Disclose your
  artifice more fully."</p>

  <p>"That is best explained by a recital of the story of Lin Ho and the
  Treasure of Fang-tso," replied Kai Lung resourcefully. "If, therefore, you
  will but inconvenience your refined and well-trained ears to the extent of
  admitting such harsh and ill-chosen phrases as I have at my illiterate
  command, I will endeavour to impart the necessary moral as painlessly as
  possible."</p>

  <p>With this auspicious foreboding, Kai Lung arranged his mat so that it
  might offer an agreeable shade to both, and then, without permitting the more
  leisurely minded Hai Shin any real opportunity for dissent, he at once raised
  up his voice.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>The Story of Lin Ho and the Treasure of Fang-tso</em></p>

  <p class="first">In the days before the usurper Yung-che arose to destroy the
  land (may the daughters of his outcast Line slant their eyes in vain along
  the byways of our desecrated city!) a conscientious lacquerer, Li Chu by
  name, plied his inoffensive craft in the township of Kiting. He had an only
  son, Lin Ho, whom it was care to instruct on all occasions in the pursuit of
  excellence.</p>

  <p>"Yet how comes it, revered," inquired Lin Ho, when he was of an age to
  discriminate these things, "that I who am the outcome of your virtuous life
  should go in homely cloth and ofttimes gnaw the unappetizing husk while the
  sons of other lacquerers wear silk array and speak familiarly of meat?"</p>

  <p>"It is even as it is," replied Li Chu, applying a pigment of a special
  brilliance to the work beneath his hand. "Doubtless if this person hung out a
  flagrant sign, hired one to chant his praises in the marketplace, and used a
  base alloy to simulate pure gold, you also might wear rich attire and eat
  your fill."</p>

  <p>"Why, then, since others of your guild do this to their advancement,
  should you not act thus as well?"</p>

  <p>"It is not the Way," answered Li Chu simply. "Have you already forgotten
  the words of the upright official Thang to those who inquired of him an easy
  road to wealth: 'All roads are easy if you do not disdain the mud'?"</p>

  <p>"Nay," assented his son, "I had not forgotten. But to what does this Way
  you speak of ultimately lead?"</p>

  <p>"To this end: that among future races, even in far distant lands, men
  searching for that which is precious will take up perchance this very casket
  and, examining it, will say, 'Here is the thumb-mark and the sign of Li Chu,
  the obscure craftsman of Kiting in the ancient days--lo, we require no
  further guarantee.' "</p>

  <p>Thus inspired, it will occasion no surprise that Li Chu himself soon after
  Passed Beyond, stricken by a low distemper against which the natural forces
  of his ill-nourished frame could not contend. Lin Ho, still many years short
  of manhood, was left destitute and would doubtless have perished had not the
  fear of barbed whispers impelled his wealthy uncle Le-ung to succour him.</p>

  <p>When Le-ung took Lin Ho into his household, he did so reluctantly, partly
  forecasting his meagre wife's displeasure but no less by reason of his own
  prevailing greed. Although full brother to Li Chu, they resembled each other
  only to this degree: that where the one succeeded the other failed, and
  likewise in converse, so that he who amassed five cart-loads of taels as the
  fruit of a sordid usury was at once forgotten, while he who was buried in a
  hired coffin is extolled by a thousand lips today when they declare: "Behold,
  the colours are as bright as those of the unapproachable Li Chu."</p>

  <p>The smaller ones of Le-ung's house were not slow to bend toward this
  unworthy attitude, for, as the Verse proclaims, "When the dragon breathes out
  fire, the dragonets begin to blow forth smoke," and very soon Lin Ho found
  that extended hands were not to welcome him and that the feet turned in his
  direction, so far from accompanying him in friendship, propelled him forward
  with undisguised hostility. The most degrading and obscure of the household
  tasks were thrust upon him, so that ere long his state in no way differed
  from that of a purchased slave. Nevertheless, Lin Ho remained sincere and
  obsequious, and whatever he was bidden to do he did in a superior manner.</p>

  <p>"Even if it is but the scouring of a cracked utensil, my aim shall be to
  scour it so that anyone taking it up will say, 'This is the work of Lin Ho
  and none other,' " he was wont to remark, with well-sustained humility. This,
  indeed, actually occurred on several occasions, but it did not enlarge Lin Ho
  in the eyes of those around.</p>

  <p>When the years of Le-ung's hospitality had reached about a single
  hand-count that person was the victim of a severe and ill-arranged
  misfortune. An obsolete and heavily burdened junk--the outcome of his
  enterprise--in making a hazardous passage along an uncharted course, was not
  wrecked, and in spite of the distinguished efforts of the one in command--an
  adherent to Le-ung's cause--the undisciplined crew succeeded in bringing the
  superfluous vessel to its inopportune anchorage. Le-ung was obliged to take
  up his share of the merchandise (which he had already disposed of at an
  advantageous loss) and to extricate himself as best he could. The blow was an
  unbecoming one.</p>

  <p>"Henceforth," remarked the pioneer of commerce to the discreet beneath his
  roof, "henceforth, the rigid line of economy must be strenuously maintained
  until this person's credit is sufficiently robust again. Restrain the
  generous impulse to out-vie all others in the cost and dimensions of
  everything procurable. Cultivate originality of taste in the direction of the
  inexpensively severe. Forbear to provide your table with lotus shoots when it
  is difficult to walk without treading on rice worms, but when there are no
  lotus shoots within ten thousand li; and with rice worms when lotus shoots
  abound around your door but when rice worms have to be brought in tanks from
  distant provinces at vast expense. In the matter of fans and general attire,
  that which was entrancing when the moon was crescent need not inevitably be
  regarded as unendurably grotesque by the time it is at the full--"</p>

  <p>"Haply," interposed the leader of those chiefly concerned; "but he who is
  clumsy with his feet will be weak in his reasoning also. Turn your eyes
  inward, O thou financially concave Le-ung, and, as the adage counsels, eat
  what you have roasted. Henceforth, in place of the exclusive brands you
  habitually affect, learn to inhale the frugal 'Tame Chrysanthemum,' of which
  two brass cash procure five. For peach wine of the choicest sources
  substitute Ah-kong's Stimulating Orange-Joy at seven taels the gross. Avoid
  the robe marts of the Western Quarter, and about your lavishly proportioned
  form wrap the already-prepared garments--"</p>

  <p>"Desist," exclaimed Le-ung ungracefully; "you cannot mend things with a
  broken needle, and your words are quite destitute of point. These are but
  trifles, and, in any case, they constitute this person's commercial frontage.
  Meet his wishes in a thoroughly large-hearted manner, and he, for his part,
  will give up something really substantial."</p>

  <p>"In what direction will the promised economy tend?" inquired the speaker
  of the band, in a spirit of well-grounded mistrust.</p>

  <p>"For upward of four years, Lin Ho has consumed our rice, and beyond a
  little manual labour of the unskilled type, he has done nothing in return.
  Admittedly, the one who is speaking has carried family affection too far, and
  he must now deny himself in this respect. Lin Ho shall go."</p>

  <p>"That loss were an undivided gain," agreed the other. "But will not the
  ever-ready voice of censure assail our trembling prestige if we thrust him
  forth?"</p>

  <p>"Refrain from instructing your venerated ancestress in the art of
  extracting nutrition from a coconut," replied Le-ung concisely. "One whose
  ships are incapable of foundering on the perfidious Che-hai coast is scarcely
  likely to lose bearings in so simple a matter as the marooning of Lin
  Ho."</p>

  <p>It will thus be seen that already this mentally bankrupt speculator was
  deceiving himself by an illogical grasp of the ordained sequences. Can we
  deny the aptness of the saying, "He who has failed three times sets up as an
  instructor?"</p>

  <p>Early the following day, Le-ung took Lin Ho aside and proceeded to unfold
  his ignoble plan. He was (to set forth his misleading words, though the
  discriminating, who will by this time have taken his repulsive measure,
  should need no warning cough) on the eve of initiating a costly venture and
  would enlist the special protection of certain powerful spirits. To this end
  it was necessary to sacrifice and observe the ceremonies at a notorious
  shrine on an indicated mountain. For this service, Le-ung had chosen Lin Ho,
  and having provided him with all things necessary, he bade him set out at
  once.</p>

  <p>With no suspicion of treachery, the painstaking Lin Ho proceeded on his
  way, determined to conduct the enterprise in such a manner as would redound
  to the credit of his name. It was noon when he reached the foot of the
  mountain, the spot being a wild one and austere. Before ascending to the
  shrine, Lin Ho sat down upon a rock to partake of food and gather strength
  for the lengthy rite. He opened his wallet and found therein an adequacy of
  mien paste, a flask of water, and an onion. There was also a little spice to
  sprinkle on the food, and a few score melon seeds.</p>

  <p>"If he whom I serve is not so light as day, neither is he quite so black
  as night," observed Lin Ho, for the nature of the fare surpassed what he had
  expected.</p>

  <p>"To speak one's thoughts aloud, even in a desert, betrays a pure and
  dispassionate mind," exclaimed an appreciative voice from behind a crag. "I
  need have no hesitation in affecting the society of such a person."</p>

  <p>With this auspicious presage the one who spoke came into view and stood
  before Lin Ho. He was above the common height and wore a martial air, to
  which his fiercely bristling whiskers gave a sombre increase. His robe was
  faded by the long exposure of a rigorous life; where the colours could be
  seen, they were both harmonious and rich. Whatever arms he bore he had laid
  aside in deference to the reputation of those heights whose shadows lay upon
  them, but he retained his iron sandals and a metal covering for the head. His
  manner had in it both something of the menace of the mountain brigand and the
  subtlety of the wayside mendicant, so that Lin Ho was not wholly reassured.
  Nevertheless, he waved his hand in greeting and indicated a smooth rock at no
  great distance from the one he sat on.</p>

  <p>"You are two thousand times welcome," he declared hospitably. "If you are
  about to refresh yourself before you perform your rites there is no occasion
  why we should not eat together."</p>

  <p>"It would be churlish to refuse an invitation so delicately advanced,"
  replied the stranger. "Foreseeing the necessity of this halt, the one before
  you carried with him baked and steamed meats of various kinds, condiments of
  the rare flavours, rice and sweet herbs, fruit, wine, and a sufficiency of
  snuff. All of these--"</p>

  <p>"Beside your rich abundance, my own scanty fare is a shrivelled weed
  beneath a towering palm," confessed Lin Ho in deep humility. "Nevertheless,
  if you will but condescend to share--"</p>

  <p>"All of these were swept away at a perfidious and ill-conditioned ford a
  short li distant to the north," continued the other. "Of what does your
  welcome and appetizing store consist, O brother?"</p>

  <p>"Very little, and that quite unattractively prepared," replied Lin Ho, his
  face by no means gladdened at the direction in which the episode was tending.
  "Accept this cake of paste and a cup of water to refresh your weary throat
  when it is finished. More I cannot allot, for I have an exacting service to
  perform and shall need all the sustaining vigour that food bestows."</p>

  <p>"What is offered in friendship should not be weighed upon a balance,"
  assented the stranger pleasantly, but at the same time so arranging himself
  that he could closely overlook all Lin Ho's movements. "With what is your own
  meritorious meal supplied, in addition to this wholesome though undoubtedly
  prosaic foundation, comrade?"</p>

  <p>"The staple of it is a large but unsightly onion," replied Lin Ho, as he
  began to peel it. "Had there been two, I might have prevailed on you to
  overcome your high-born repugnance to such crude fare."</p>

  <p>"An onion!" exclaimed the one beside him, stretching out his hand to take
  it, so incredulous were his eyes of their service. "An onion at this
  momentous hour! Would you affront the deities on whom you call by carrying so
  impolite a taint into their sacred presence?"</p>

  <p>"That is very far from being my purpose," replied Lin Ho, colouring at the
  unbecoming imputation. "Not shall so gross a misdeed ever be set to my
  account."</p>

  <p>"Yet you do not hold that the breath of your petition will rise before the
  faces of the gods you supplicate?"</p>

  <p>"Such is the essence of the rite," Lin Ho admitted. "How else should they
  hear and concede my prayer?"</p>

  <p>"Then how can your breath ascend on high without conveying in its wake the
  pestilential reek of onion if you permit yourself this rash indulgence? It is
  well for you that we encountered, friend!"</p>

  <p>"That certainly presents the matter in a disconcerting light and one that
  I had never up to now been warned of," said Lin Ho in a very downcast spirit.
  "Must the better part of my sustenance then be wasted?"</p>

  <p>"By no means," replied his companion, beginning to eat; "it shall not be
  lost. My own business with the Venerable Ones is the mere formality of
  rendering thanks for an enterprise achieved, and at the moment I have nothing
  to solicit. It therefore matters very little whether they maintain a
  sympathetic front or turn their backs on me disdainfully. In this matter of
  the onion, neighbour, be content: Lam-kwong will requite you to the full at
  some appropriate time."</p>

  <p>"That may be," agreed Lin Ho, "but 'today is a blistered foot; tomorrow
  but an itching hand.' It is no easy thing to prostrate one's self
  continuously on a stomach sustained by mien paste alone."</p>

  <p>"You have suffered no great loss," said Lam-kwong in a voice that began to
  lose its truculent assurance. "Already I am experiencing certain grievous
  inward qualms. Whence came this dubious root that you have so noticeably
  pressed upon me?"</p>

  <p>"'Wan Tae, falling into the river while catching fish, accuses them of his
  misfortune,' " quoted Lin Ho, stung by the injustice of the taunt. "Touching
  the thing that you have eaten, I know no more than this: that it is from the
  hand of one who is not prone to bounty."</p>

  <p>"Is his enmity so great that he would conspire to your destruction if it
  could be prudently achieved?" inquired Lam-kwong faintly.</p>

  <p>"He is capable of any crime, from reviling the Classics to diverting
  water-courses," freely declared Lin Ho. "If you desire to speak openly of
  Le-ung, do not let the fact that he is closely related to the one before you
  impede the zealous fountain of your doubtless fluent tongue. Without
  question, he laid a dark spell upon the onion for it to contort your limbs so
  unnaturally."</p>

  <p>"It is a spell that writes Lam-kwong's untimely end," exclaimed the one
  who thus alluded to his own up-passing. "The device is an ancient one, the
  pungent juices of the herb cloaking the natural flavour of the poison until
  it is too late. Between you you have outdone me who have outdone all
  others--may the two of you grill at a never-slackening fire throughout
  eternity! Him, neither my resentful hand can reach nor my avenging ghost
  discover, but you at least shall suffer for your inept share in this one's
  humiliation. Take Lam-kwong's last message!" A weighty stone, propelled with
  all that one's expiring vigour, accompanied this shortsighted curse, and
  chancing to inflict itself upon Lin Ho at a vulnerable point of his outline,
  the well-meaning and really inoffensive person groaned twice and sank to the
  ground devoid of life.</p>

  <p>Lin Ho being dead, his spirit at once sped to the Upper World and passed
  the barriers successfully. An inferior Being received and questioned him and,
  setting a certain mark against his name, led him into the assembly of those
  who sat in judgment.</p>

  <p>"Lin Ho," said the presiding chief in some embarrassment, "the
  circumstances of your abrupt arrival here are rather out of the formal order
  of things, and the necessary records are not as yet available. For this
  irregularity, Lam-kwong shall answer sharply. As for you, in view of your
  frugal and abstemious life, and taking into consideration the mission on
  which you are now engaged, it has been decided to send you back again to
  earth. Regard the Virtues, sacrifice freely, and provide an adequate
  posterity."</p>

  <p>Lin Ho then had the sensation of being violently projected downward. When
  he recovered sufficiently from the exertion to be able to observe coherently,
  he found that he was floating in spirit above the spot on earth where he had
  lately been. Beneath him lay two lifeless bodies--those of Lam-kwong and of
  himself. For the first time he was inspired by an emotion of contempt toward
  his own placid and unassuming features.</p>

  <p>"It is one thing to lead a frugal and abstemious life," Lin Ho reflected;
  "it is another to partake of meat whenever the desire arises. Hitherto this
  person has accepted servitude and followed the integritous path because with
  so narrow-minded a face as that any other line of conduct was not
  practicable. Had he possessed fiercely bristling whiskers and a capricious
  eye, he would not have meekly accepted the outer husk of things, nor would
  the maidens of Kiting have greeted him with derisive cries, that he should
  not respond to them when they encountered about dusk in the waste spaces of
  the city."</p>

  <p>For a few short beats of time, the spirit of Lin Ho considered further.
  Then he looked this way and that and saw that there was none to observe him
  there, nor had any attending Being accompanied him to earth. He took a sudden
  resolution, and before a movement could be made to intercept him, he slipped
  into the body of Lam-kwong and animated it.</p>

  <p>When Lin Ho, wearing the body of Lam-kwong, rose up, he was conscious of
  possessing an entirely new arrangement of the senses. The thought of Le-ung
  no longer filled him with submission, and he laughed sonorously at a
  recollection of the labours he had lately been engaged in, though hitherto he
  had regarded all forms of gravity-removal as unworthy of his strenuous
  purpose. The sound of his iron shoes grinding the rocks he walked on raised
  his spirits, and he opened and closed his great hands to feel their horny
  strength. From time to time, he leaped into the air to test his powers, and
  he shouted a defiance to any unseen demons who might happen to be lurking in
  the caves around.</p>

  <p>So careless had Lin Ho grown that he had walked and leaped at least a li
  before he recalled his new position. To return to the house of Le-ung was now
  useless, for however passively disposed that one had formerly been toward a
  kinsman of his Line, it would be vain for a stranger of formidable hirsute
  guise and martial mien to appear and claim his bounty. In search of a
  deciding omen, Lin Ho turned to the inner sleeves of the one whom he now was,
  and he did not turn in vain. Among a varied profusion that he left for future
  use, he found a written message. It bore the name of Ku-ei and conveyed an
  affectionate greeting from one who dwelt beneath the sign of Righteousness
  Long Established, in the Street of the South Wind, within the city of
  Tsing-te. Toward Tsing-te Lin Ho now turned his adventuring feet.</p>

  <p>It was not until three days later that Lin Ho reached the gate of Tsing-te
  called the Leper's Gate and entered by it. He had not hastened, for the
  encounters of the way were not distasteful to his newly acquired temper.
  Those whom he had greeted with a single upraised finger and an unbending neck
  acknowledge him obsequiously in turn, and when he spoke to of the appetizing
  air, food was at once forthcoming. Some made a claim to know him and talked
  familiarly of things, but though Lin Ho would have welcomed whatever led him
  to a fuller understanding of himself, he could not pursue the arising
  conversation to any lucid end. From one it would appear as though he
  controlled a Hall of Melody; from another that he dealt extensively in yellow
  fat. A third spoke as if the public lotteries lay beneath his guiding thumb,
  and yet a fourth cautiously disclosed a secret sign which Lin Ho had some
  difficulty in ignoring.</p>

  <p>"The wealth of analogy possessed by our inimitable tongue admittedly lends
  itself to a classical purity of style, but it certainly tends toward a
  baffling ambiguity in the commonplace needs of life," reflected the one
  involved, and with a gesture of qualified agreement he passed on.</p>

  <p>Once in the city he had come to, Lin Ho recognized that his course would
  be no less devious there. He forebore to ask the way lest it should be of any
  who might know him, so that it was the time of between-light before he
  chanced upon the street he needed. It was a deserted part and sombre, and the
  house that showed the symbol of a golden bar disclosed no window to the
  passerby. Lin Ho struck the well-protected door, and as no answer came, at
  once he beat upon it with an iron shoe.</p>

  <p>"What errant lord stands there to wake the Seven Echoes with his
  unbecoming clamour?" growled a contentious voice within, and there came the
  creak of a shutter being more firmly wedged.</p>

  <p>"One who is not wont to be questioned either before or after," replied Lin
  Ho, stamping with his massive heel upon the door-sill. "Let that
  suffice."</p>

  <p>An iron plate slid open and an eye appeared. Then the defences of the door
  were drawn.</p>

  <p>"Why was the usual sign withheld, chiefling?" protested the one within.
  "Had I not identified that richly mellowed voice, you might have stamped in
  vain."</p>

  <p>"It was but to try thy wariness, reliant Ying," answered Lin Ho, with a
  confidence engendered by success. "I am newly returned from a lengthy journey
  and thought to test the watch you keep here."</p>

  <p>"Your mood was ever light and whimsical," retorted the keeper of the door
  tolerantly, as Lin Ho entered. " 'Ying' indeed! For threescore years plain
  Wong has served, but 'Ying' is well enough."</p>

  <p>"Do any await me now?" ventured Lin Ho, putting this lightness from him
  with an indulgent nod.</p>

  <p>"She of the inner chamber broods expectantly," replied the docile Wong,
  bending a meaning look. "Furthermore, she laid a charge on me to bid you
  hasten to her presence."</p>

  <p>"Then lead me there," Lin Ho commanded. "Her engaging interest fills me
  with a pleasurable confusion."</p>

  <p>"Lead, forsooth! Surely by this time you must know the way," began the one
  who sought thus to excuse himself, but:</p>

  <p>"I would have it so," replied Lin Ho, touching his efficacious whiskers
  significantly, and Wong obeyed.</p>

  <p>From the nature of her written greeting, Lin Ho did not doubt the depth
  and weight of Ku-ei's devotion, and he was reconciled to the necessity of
  reciprocating it to the full when he should have been discovered in what
  direction the requirement lay. In a chamber hung with bright silks of eight
  appropriate blends, she was seated on a dais covered with a leopard skin when
  he entered, and the colours and arrangements of her robes exceeded anything
  that he had yet encountered. At the same time he could not fail to recognize
  that her years somewhat overlapped those of the one whose obligations he had
  assumed, and as regards his natural self, the comparison was even more
  remote.</p>

  <p>"Ten thousand jewelled greetings!" she exclaimed with a dignified absence
  of restraint that convinced Lin Ho of their mutual affection. "Have you
  indeed returned?"</p>

  <p>"Admittedly," and to impart a fuller flavour to the assurance he added,
  "What could detain this person's hurrying footsteps from your virtuous and
  attractive side?"</p>

  <p>The one addressed rewarded him with a well-considered glance of approval
  from her expressive eyes and then indicated by a refined gesture that he
  should seat himself where they could converse without exertion.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, then, of the various adventures of your quest," she commanded
  graciously, "for these bankrupt ears droop to learn your tidings."</p>

  <p>"There is neither length nor width to the limits of that story," replied
  Lin Ho cautiously. "In which particular direction does your gratifying
  curiosity extend?"</p>

  <p>"That needs no trumpet to proclaim it," was the ready answer. "Have you
  accomplished this one's freedom?"</p>

  <p>"He who would deny it is malformed from birth, nor is father's Line
  unsullied," exclaimed Lin Ho, deeming his strategy to lie in a judicious
  evasion until he could satisfy himself more fully; and he would have raised a
  menacing hand to touch his responsive cheek, had he not doubted whether the
  gesture would be correct in Ku-ei's presence.</p>

  <p>"Your sublime assurance is a never-failing support to the weak-kneed
  scruples of my own embarassment," confessed the lady Ku-ei gracefully. "There
  is, however, a time to speak in the flowery terms of poetical allusion and a
  time to be distressingly explicit. Descending to the latter plane for one
  concise moment, O my dragon-hearted, state definitely whether you have or
  have not succeeded in slaying this long-enduring one's offensive and
  superfluous lord, and in attaching to yourself his personal belongings?"</p>

  <p>Alas, it has been truly said, "He who flies on an eagle's back must sooner
  or later drop off," and Lin Ho was experiencing the justice of the verse. But
  when it seemed as though he could no longer maintain an equivocal poise, an
  inspired recollection of Lam-kwong's boast--that he had achieved his
  enterprise--came back and decided him to accept the hazard.</p>

  <p>"With these unworthy hands have your unmentionable sufferings been ended,"
  he accordingly declared, "and here"--at this point he poured out before her
  feet the varied contents of Lam-kwong's inner sleeve--"here is the evidence
  that I do not lean on words."</p>

  <p>"Truly your little finger is more achieving than the whole of Fang-tso's
  two-faced body," exclaimed the one beside him exultantly. "Here are his keys
  and signet and his personal authority as well! Who can any longer doubt that
  the band will acclaim you its chief and ruler in Fang-tso's stead--and this
  person has ever gone with the band!"</p>

  <p>"It is more than enough to hear such gratuitously expressed words," said
  Lin Ho courteously; whereupon Ku-ei sang to him a melody expressing her deep
  emotions.</p>

  <p>The next morning, after they had refreshed themselves with food brought in
  on silver plates by richly attired slaves and had smoked from a single pipe,
  Ku-ei took up the ring of keys that Lin Ho had brought, and indicating by a
  suitable movement of her swanlike hand that two bearers should attend with
  lights, she called that one to accompany her.</p>

  <p>"Come," she remarked pleasantly, "it is fitting that you, who are shortly
  to be the chieftain of the place, should now learn the extent of the treasure
  that its vaults contain."</p>

  <p>"It is an agreeable mark of confidence on your part," replied Lin Ho with
  polished unconcern, but he followed her down the ladder closely, for there
  was his own strategy to consider, and he had a far from tranquil stomach
  about the one called Fang-tso, whom, in an outside manner, he had heard
  spoken of as comparable with gods in strength and with demons in
  resentment.</p>

  <p>"Doubtless in these remote beneath-parts there will be a store of gold and
  silver and precious stones which will smooth this person's path very
  appreciably should it become necessary for him to withdraw in unobtrusive
  haste," thought Lin Ho as he descended, full of hope and resolution.</p>

  <p>The first cave, from its earthen floor up to its arching roof, was filled
  with rags. There were shreds of every colour, variety, and usage, from the
  wrappings which the afflicted cast off in obscure byways to the unused scraps
  such as the charitable bestow on persistent mendicants about their door.</p>

  <p>"Nothing is too insignificant to have some use; nothing too ample to be
  beyond our power of assimilation," remarked the broad-minded Ku-ei with
  farseeing pride as she contemplated the mass, but Lin Ho was not disposed to
  linger.</p>

  <p>The next cave was filled in a like manner with bones, and it was no less
  spacious than the first. Again the one who led him spoke encouragingly of the
  profits of this obscure traffic, but here also Lin Ho pressed forward dumbly,
  so involved were his feelings.</p>

  <p>Jars, cruses, and receptacles in their several grades were the staple of
  the third enclosure; fragments of torn and rejected paper of the fourth. In
  immediate succession there were vaults of broken and abandoned umbrellas, of
  worn-out and cast-off sandals, of unserviceable fans and fabricated
  flowers.</p>

  <p>"This is the very dustbin and the ash-heap of the city's voidance,"
  reflected Lin Ho, as he passed a cave pressed to the full with driftwood,
  bungs, and halfburned joss-sticks. "What scope is there for one of my
  distinguished personality in this harbourage of refuse?" Twice or thrice he
  would have turned had not Ku-ei urged him on, and presently the nature of the
  commerce changed, and more in keeping with Lin Ho's mood, for here were
  cloaks and coverings for the head and face, the better sort of garments, and
  such things as could be worn with fitness. Weapons of all kinds there were
  and armour both for men and horses, ceremonial flags and wands of office,
  tablets, and even chairs.</p>

  <p>"Yet how comes it," he remarked, "that these things are comparatively few
  and sparse, while of the cruder stock an interminable line of caves
  extends?"</p>

  <p>"The answer to that requires no lantern to discover, seeing that the
  brigands of our band scare number now a dozen, and they old and infirm in
  service, while of the mendicants a stalwart and increasing tribe responds
  daily to the roll," explained Ku-ei readily. "But, speaking as one in
  authority to another, there is no great matter for regret in that. The
  rewards of mendicancy, if severally minute, are sure, and the market is a
  never-failing one. The fruits of brigandage are uncertain and difficult to
  garner; indeed, several of the band are scarcely worth their rice, and had it
  not been for the local distinction that the gang confers, even the
  vainglorious Fang-tso would ere this have dispersed them to their homes. But
  in the end he was always wont to say, 'What we scatter on the brigands we
  gather up by the mendicants,' and thus and thus it remains."</p>

  <p>"Her thoughts are forever set on gain and truckage, and her mind is
  ordinary in the extreme," reflected Lin Ho. "This one can have no lasting
  permanence for me."</p>

  <p>"And now," continued she whom he thus inwardly denounced, "I have freely
  shown you all. Will you not, in return, disclose to me the one thing that is
  lacking?"</p>

  <p>"When you open your golden lips, nothing is wanting to complete the circle
  of felicity," politely replied Lin Ho, his experience not being sufficient to
  enable him to detect the peril underlying Ku-ei's speech and judiciously to
  avert the impending sequence. "What pearl is missing from the rope of your
  desire?"</p>

  <p>"Somewhere about these caves is hidden Fang-tso's private store of gold
  and jewels. That secret you would have extorted from him before you suffered
  him to Pass Beyond. Let us together now draw them forth and put them to a
  more appropriate use."</p>

  <p>This request threw Lin Ho into a very complicated meditation. It disclosed
  that such a store did undoubtedly exist, but it led no further on a
  beneficial line. In the vastness of these caves, to dig at a hazard would be
  as profitable as to scoop for a grain of salt in a cask of water. And a
  moment might arise when Lin Ho would not be given the leisure to dig at all.
  Despite much that had cast a favourable shadow, the Destinies were not really
  well-arranged, so far.</p>

  <p>"Can it be that one on whom this person has lavished so much disinterested
  affection maintains an ambiguous pose toward her only expressed wish!"
  exclaimed the lady Ku-ei reproachfully as Lin Ho remained aloof, and despite
  the restriction of the spot she prepared to indulge in a very extensive
  display of many-sided agitation.</p>

  <p>"Defer your refined exhibition of virtuous annoyance to a more convenient
  gong-stroke," cautioned Lin Ho. "One in no way concerned approaches," and as
  he spoke, the sympathetic Wong discovered them.</p>

  <p>"Well chanced upon, O chieftain," exclaimed Wong, with obtuse
  self-satisfaction. "The company of beggars are about to take their stations
  in the Ways. Would you exchange the usual greeting with them in the
  courtyard?"</p>

  <p>"Let them disperse with an entire absence of ceremonial rite," replied Lin
  ho, in a tone of no-encouragement. "Dismiss them at their ease."</p>

  <p>"Things were very different in the upright days before the coming of the
  Competitions," muttered Wong supinely. "What next, perchance? Indeed," he
  added at the recollection, "there is a case in point. One stands about the
  outer door, protesting to all who pass that he, in spite of every outward
  sign, is no other than the bountiful Lam-kwong."</p>

  <p>"What is this one like?" demanded Lin Ho sharply. "Seeing that you have
  listened to his feeble pretensions."</p>

  <p>"Nay, but I did no more than question him, by warrant of my office,"
  replied Wong stubbornly. "If you indeed are our noble chief Lam-kwong,' I
  said, be it understood, 'there is a ready test,' and I held out my hand, palm
  uppermost, toward him. 'For,' I continued, this being the snare, 'that
  compassion and high-stepping leader suffers no single day to go without a
  piece of silver passing to my sleeve--and so far today the custom has escaped
  him.' To this the uncogenial dog made no adequate response and thereby stood
  exposed. 'Begone, witless,' I cried, justly annoyed, and I beat him about the
  head and shoulders with my staff. Then, as he put up no defence, I added,
  'Wert thou his very likeness and the wearer of his embossed ring, still,
  after this, thou couldst not be Lam-kwong.' "</p>

  <p>"There is more herein than hangs upon a wooden nail, as the saying is,"
  pondered Lin Ho. "Describe him whom you beat," he commanded aloud. "Haply he
  is some obscure member of my clan who bears a portion of the name."</p>

  <p>"He is small and undersized and his expression vile," declared the ready
  Wong. "His eyes are badly placed and have a complex bend, his forehead
  insincere, and the sound of his breathing unpleasant to the good-class ear.
  His dress is meagre and ill-fitting, his--"</p>

  <p>"Enough," interrupted the one who recognized himself, although he was
  little disposed to hear from another what he had spontaneously avowed; "I
  would sift the essence of this mixture to the dregs. Remove the impostor to a
  cell apart, and there I will confront him."</p>

  <p>"It is as good as done, commander," replied Wong with easy assurance; and
  he went.</p>

  <p>When Lin Ho and Lam-kwong, each in the semblance of the other,
  encountered, the moment was a concentrated one. The former person had
  required that all should withdraw to a distance from the cell so that there
  was none to overhear their words. Lam-kwong was the first actually to
  speak.</p>

  <p>"It is useless to curl your whiskers and blow out your cheeks in this
  one's direction," he remarked, and he spat familiarly and sat upon the
  ground.</p>

  <p>"Yet how comes it," demanded Lin Ho, "that you, who could not oppose the
  feeble-minded Wong, should remain unmoved by a display at which the boldest
  tremble?"</p>

  <p>"It is in the nature of things," replied Lam-kwong. "It must be already be
  known to you that, with so ineffectual a face as this, and all that it
  implies, subservience and a meek demeanour are foregone. Only one aspect
  fails to impress me, and that is the one you wear, for it having been my own
  so long, I cannot but know the hollowness behind. The contentious Wong may
  indeed be effete, but I am less familiar with his weakness."</p>

  <p>"What you say is very reasonable," admitted Lin Ho, "for, from my own
  angle of observation, I have already experienced something of the kind. Since
  there is nothing to be gained by acrimony, let us disclose our minds," and he
  related to the other what--up to a certain point--had taken place.</p>

  <p>"It is difficult to see that you are much to blame," admitted Lam-kwong
  courteously, "and in any case the involvement sprang from this one's
  shortsighted gluttony. Had he not coveted the onion that you would have
  eaten, everything might still be going on satisfactorily. were it not for the
  thought of you and the now unobtainable Ku-ei--" and he fell to pulling out
  much of his carefully arranged pigtail by the roots.</p>

  <p>"Beware of jealousy," advised Lin Ho. "Remember it is written, 'Not
  everyone who comes down your street enters by your door.' Rather, occupy your
  mind by disclosing in turn how the High Ones arraigned you before them."</p>

  <p>"That is easily explained," replied Lam-kwong, "and they doubtless acted
  for the best. I must have Passed Upward at a slightly later period than your
  own distinguished flight, for as I went up I encountered your high-born Shade
  descending. After having very properly been kept waiting for a lengthy
  interval, this one was at last called in for sentence. 'Lam-kwong,'
  pronounced an authoritative voice, 'you have over-riden the Edict and set the
  Principles at naught. Your instincts are largely criminal and your tastes
  obscene. By this last act of violence you have seriously inconvenienced those
  who keep the books, for it was not intended that Lin Ho should close his
  record yet. To reward him for the wrong that has been accomplished, he has
  been returned to an ordinary state of life and given the opportunity to
  inhabit your body; to punish you in the most offensive way that can be
  thought of, you also will be sent back to earth, and in place of your own
  attractive and courageous frame you will be condemned to take up his. In this
  manner your defiant and salacious nature will be quelled, whether you like it
  or not.' 'Omnipotence,' I craved, 'before the word goes forth, hear an
  inserted plea; let the judgment be extinction, the sulphur pit, or being
  transformed into the likeness of one of the lower insects, but not--'
  'Enough; it is too late,' interposed the voice. 'The sentence has been
  written and the ink is dry.' I then found myself lying among the rocks and
  suffering excruciating pain from the wound that I had inflicted upon
  you."</p>

  <p>"That is no doubt your angle of regarding what took place, but there is
  certainly another, more acute," said Lin Ho coldly. "However, being in that
  barren place alone and with nothing in your sleeve, by what means did you
  extricate yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Throughout the night I lay there and nourished my hurt on the dew that
  fell. Toward the dawn came one seeking, and presently, from his rancour and
  the familiar knowledge of his greeting, I recognized in him that
  ill-conditioned Le-ung of whom you spoke, come to see that his vengeance was
  complete. 'Much gladness!' exclaimed the misshapen outcast when he discovered
  me. 'Have you eaten your rice?' 'What little of it there was,' this one
  replied. 'Is it your humane purpose to supplement it with a further portion?'
  'Will another onion serve?' he inquired smoothly, thus to test the limits of
  what I knew, and to this, seeing no profit in concealment, I replied,
  'Assuredly. Being under the direct protection of the gods, its venom will
  pass from me.' At that, recognizing the frustration of his crafty plan, he
  disclosed himself without reserve. 'If you lie beneath the bosom of the gods,
  let them suckle you,' he scoffed. 'See to it that you cross my path no more,'
  and he drove me on with blows. Feeling incapable of raising a defence, this
  person fled as best he could, and thenceforward, begging diffidently from
  door to door, he made his laborious way."</p>

  <p>"Yet what can you hope to achieve by coming here?" demanded the one who
  had usurped him. "Nothing awaits you but a place among the band of
  mendicants."</p>

  <p>"A beggar in these Ways!" exclaimed Lam-kwong, changing colour. "Not even
  Lin Ho's face would countenance that. This one, before whom all others
  quailed, save Fang-tso only!"</p>

  <p>"Doubtless," was the reply, "but no one fears the bull when he has lost
  his horns. As regards the one who you have named, I would speak further, for
  I have cherished an uneasy feeling from the outset that Fang-tso was somewhat
  beyond our common measure. What passed between you at the last
  encounter?"</p>

  <p>"We two, being on a journey alone and in a desert place, I overcame him by
  a stratagem, and having securely bound his hands and feet, I sold him into
  slavery among a passing tribe of barbarian Khins."</p>

  <p>"That was shortsighted to the last degree," declared Lin Ho. "Why, he
  being in your power, did you not then destroy him?"</p>

  <p>Lam-kwong hesitated and would have turned the subject aside by a timely
  stress of coughing, but Lin Ho took him by the ears so that he could not
  avert his face and thus compelled the truth.</p>

  <p>"I would have done so for several reasons," admitted Lam-kwong, seeing
  evasion useless, "but necessity ordained it otherwise. Fang-tso possessed a
  certain secret--not of any outside moment, but essential to my plans--and
  this he would not disclose. In the end I bargained with him on a mutually
  inviolate oath, covenanting his life in exchange for what he told me."</p>

  <p>"This concerns the hidden wealth," thought Lin Ho instantly, "but
  Lam-kwong has now so little left in life that he will inevitably submit to
  death rather than disclose the spot. Adroitness alone will serve."</p>

  <p>"The private affairs of Fang-tso and of yourself do not engage my mind,"
  he accordingly remarked, with well-sustained no-interest-- for he had also
  acquired Lam-kwong's duplicity as well as that one's valour--"but I would
  gladly learn what form the wealth took that he must undoubtedly have
  gathered."</p>

  <p>"He has heard nothing so far of Fang-tso's buried hoard," considered
  Lam-kwong, more easily deceived than he was wont to be. "If I can but secure
  even a short time alone in the beneath-parts, all may yet be well." Aloud he
  said:</p>

  <p>"He spoke more than once in the past of conveying it for safety to the
  stronghold of Hsin Foo, a well-walled city in the tranquil south, of which
  his brother, Ho-ang, is the governor. If there is no evidence of luxury
  about, this has assuredly been done."</p>

  <p>"Assuredly," agreed Lin Ho; "for all this place holds would appear to be
  the wind-sweepings of the city byways."</p>

  <p>"Naturally, to a being of your superior tastes, such commerce would seem
  gross," ventured Lam-kwong. "Very soon, however, the one before you must turn
  his reluctant feet upon an outward path, nor has he any trade whereby to earn
  his rice. If out of the large-stomached forbearance that you must feel for
  his in every way secondhand condition you would suffer him to carry off in
  his pack a few poor remnants of unserviceable traffic, he would secure the
  nucleus of a sordid livelihood, the store would not appreciably be lessened,
  and your imperishable name would be written in letters of pure gold above the
  Temple of Munificence."</p>

  <p>"What was begun in friendship should not be wound up in malice," assented
  Lin Ho, taking out the keys that he had retained. "So much as you can bear
  away upon your shoulder shall be yours."</p>

  <p>"I must contrive to divert Lin Ho from accompanying me," argued Lam-kwong;
  "but to suggest it too abruptly were to raise suspicion." So he remained
  silent.</p>

  <p>"It is necessary to allow Lam-kwong to work in secret, so that he shall
  find the treasure," reasoned Lin Ho, "though to leave him for no good cause
  might defeat its end." And he also held his peace.</p>

  <p>Together, therefore, they reached the opening to the vaults, and Lin Ho
  having unlocked the strong door they would have entered, but at that moment
  the supple Wong appeared.</p>

  <p>"Fearless chieftain," exclaimed that officious person, "Tse, of the
  intrepid mountain band, has ridden in on an urgent rein and seeks your
  pressing ear."</p>

  <p>"It distresses me beyond measure to leave you so inhospitably at the very
  outset of your laborious undertaking," declared Lin Ho; "but--"</p>

  <p>"It grieves me inexpressibly to be deprived of your entertaining society
  just when I was looking forward to enjoying that felicity for a further
  period," retorted Lam-kwong; "however--" And with a mutually appropriate
  gesture of regret they parted, the latter person descending to his task, and
  Lin Ho unobtrusively locking the door upon him.</p>

  <p>The one described as Tse stood at the outer gate and caressed his weary
  horse. He was of repulsive outline, having one eye only and an ill-cast face,
  but he seemed upright, and he accorded the sign of deference as Lin Ho
  approached.</p>

  <p>"High commander," was his greeting, "when they should have buried alive
  this person's mother, in that she was an admitted witch, and your benevolence
  intervened and spared her, the one who speaks took an oath to discharge the
  obligation and bound himself thereby."</p>

  <p>"Proceed," encouraged Lin Ho, "the occasion may fulfil your pledge."</p>

  <p>"We have a saying, 'A word whispered in the ear can carry a thousand li,'
  and it would doubtless surprise you to know what details of the private
  doings of you upper ones reach us. Howbeit, that is neither caught on a hook
  nor shot by an arrow, as the motto goes, but herein lies the gist of it: As
  this one kept his station by the Gridiron Pass at daybreak, there came a
  wayfarer who pushed on his falling horse, and every time it stumbled he
  raised a curse of vengeance against one whom he did not name outright.
  Hearing this and seeing him, although no name was spoken, your menial hid
  among the rocks, and when that other one had gone he came past him by a
  secret way and has conveyed the warning."</p>

  <p>"Wisdom has guided your feet so far," acquiesced Lin Ho, well knowing by
  the indications that the one anathematized was that Lam-kwong whose form he
  himself wore. "Did the horsemen bear no sign by which he might be known?"</p>

  <p>"He showed such marks as disclosed that he was escaping out of bondage,"
  replied the other. "But to the robbers of our tribe his upraised whip-armed
  hand was a not-forgotten symbol."</p>

  <p>"Fang-tso returned!" uttered Lin Ho beneath his breath, and Tse bent his
  head in token, well content that he had done what he had and that no
  incriminating name had passed his lips.</p>

  <p>"This embodies something of a paradox, for it both complicates and
  simplifies the matter," remarked Lin Ho, after he had stood awhile in
  thought. "You spoke of encountering him at dawn and avoiding his passage by a
  hidden track. Thus and thus at what hour may we expect to greet him with our
  loyal devotion?"</p>

  <p>"According to the various influences, his ever-welcome feet should reach
  this gate at a gong-stroke before noon," replied the brigand.</p>

  <p>"You have done well throughout and have all but repaid your oath. One
  thing alone remains. Achieve that, and not only what you set out to effect
  will have been accomplished, but five ingots of the purest will reward your
  zeal."</p>

  <p>"Though one eye is useless, both ears are copiously alert," responded Tse.
  "Say on, most opportune."</p>

  <p>"In the first place, it is necessary that your accomplished and bewitching
  mother should be here, for my business lies with her."</p>

  <p>"That is easily done," was Tse's reply, and from a hidden fold of his
  ample garment he produced a lean gray rat and sat it upon his hand. "Since
  the incident referred to, she has generally accompanied me in one shape or
  another, to be out of harm's way."</p>

  <p>"Filial piety carried to such a length deserves to be set to music,"
  declared Lin Ho. "Nothing could be more propitious. Perhaps, in the
  circumstances, as we are unobserved, she would graciously revert to a
  condition in which mutual conversation will be on a more normal level."</p>

  <p>"That also presents no obstacle." Tse shook off the docile creature down
  on to the ground, sprinkled a little salt upon it as he pronounced a magic
  word, and instead of a rat an aged and unsightly hag appeared before
  them.</p>

  <p>"I have heard all that has been said, high excellence," remarked the
  ancient. "So that it only remains for you to disclose your need."</p>

  <p>"To one of your venerable charm it should not be a weighty matter,"
  suggested Lin Ho. "For a certain reason it is necessary that I should leave
  my ordinary body for a trifling moment and float in the Middle Air at will.
  Can you ensure me this?"</p>

  <p>"If that is all you require," declared the witch, "it will involve no
  eclipse to contrive it. You have seen that this one is in the habit of
  changing herself into the similitude of various creatures of the lower part
  as the necessity arises, and for this one way is as well as another. Drink
  but a single drop of the liquid in this phial and presently a languor will
  assail you. Under this influence your unfettered spirit will float away at
  its own volition, free to enter any untenanted shape that it encounters or to
  return to its own body as it may desire."</p>

  <p>"You have earned a full requital," admitted Lin Ho, counting the silver to
  the one who stood by expectant. "Yet what period spans the pause between the
  drinking of the potion and the lethargy descending?"</p>

  <p>"It can be rated as the time in which an agile man might walk a li," was
  the reply. "May a coronal of shining lights illuminate your hazardous path,
  esteemed."</p>

  <p>"May the immortal principles of equipoise be maintained within your
  venerable body," rejoined Lin Ho, no less agreeably, and they parted.</p>

  <p>Had his position been a less ambiguous one, Lin Ho would certainly have
  called upon the shadows of his immediate ancestors to rally to his aid in
  their strength at this crisis of his fate. In view of the two-sided nature of
  his being, however, he deemed this to be inexpedient, so that, instead, he
  devoted the time that he could spare to perfecting his arrangements. It then
  wanting about two gong-strokes to the hour of noon, he unlocked the strong
  door of the caves and found Lam-kwong below.</p>

  <p>"A few jars of one kind and another, an assortment of rusty iron, and a
  sundry profusion of rags wherewith to pack the whole," remarked the one in
  question, indicating the bale that he had bound with leather. "A scanty cash
  or two in the marketplace at most, but the limit for these degenerate
  shoulders."</p>

  <p>"The rewards of industry were ever ill-allotted," sympathized Lin Ho.
  "When you have refreshed yourself at my poverty-stricken board, perchance you
  will be able to sustain more."</p>

  <p>"Alas," replied Lam-kwong evasively, "the honour of sitting at the same
  table with your distinguished self would be so excessive that I should
  certainly sink under its weight alone. A crust as I go my uphill way--"</p>

  <p>"Should it become known that I allowed so illustrious a guest to depart
  fasting, the stones of Tsing-te would leap into indignant hands when next I
  passed," Lin Ho insisted firmly; and because he was unable to withstand,
  Lam-kwong yielded.</p>

  <p>When they were come to a suitable room, set at a distance from the rest,
  Lin Ho called for a repast of a generous sort, and he also indicated wine. At
  this Lam-kwong raised a protesting hand.</p>

  <p>"For," he said, "we have no certainty of what shall thence arise. Should
  you in consequence become too self-centered to accompany me, the acrimonious
  Wong may resist my going with this bale of stuff and delay me at the
  gate."</p>

  <p>"That is a point to be considered," admitted Lin Ho; "but because leprosy
  exists there is no reason why one should not enjoy the shelter of a tree. Let
  Wong attend."</p>

  <p>"I heard and obey, magnificence," said the voice of the one indicated, as
  he appeared from around the open door. "Understanding that a feast was being
  prepared--"</p>

  <p>"In due course a portion shall be assigned," interposed Lin Ho.
  "Meanwhile, feast your ears upon my words. This inoffensive youth will
  shortly be proceeding on his journey hence. See to it that nothing untoward
  occurs about our gate. Let neither hand nor foot be stretched in his
  direction, or I who speak will prune their overgrowth. Furthermore, all that
  he takes is his by special grace and free of any mulct or usage."</p>

  <p>"A line of bowmen shall be drawn up to do him honour," replied the
  outrageous Wong, unsettled by the thought of the approaching meat; "and muted
  trumpets sound an appropriate march."</p>

  <p>"Take heed lest their office is to play one who shall be nameless toward a
  hole made in the ground," remarked Lin Ho with sombre freedom. "An added
  duty, keeper of the latch: when our guest shall have departed, your charge is
  that none approaches or disturbs me here on any pretext, for I have deep
  matters to consider. Now let all withdraw so that we may eat
  negligently."</p>

  <p>Lam-kwong being eager to get away, and Lin Ho no less anxious not to delay
  the parting, their etiquette was neither ceremonious nor involved. The former
  person, indeed, did not scruple to convey the choicer morsels of each dish to
  his inner sleeve, and Lin ho, though he must have observed the movement,
  forebore to challenge him. Presently, turning aside, he filled two cups with
  a special wine.</p>

  <p>"Let us, as the custom is, pledge our mutual enterprises," and he pressed
  one of the cups upon Lam-kwong.</p>

  <p>"There is no reason why we should not do so," replied the other. "Nor
  would I stand churlishly aloof were it not that I observed your surreptitious
  hand to linger somewhat about the cup that you have passed to me."</p>

  <p>"That is a very one-sided view to take," exclaimed Lin Ho in some
  annoyance. "If I wished to effect your end, there hangs a trusty sword upon
  the wall and none to question how or why I use it; though where you
  unsophisticated death would profit me, the Great Serpent alone knows."</p>

  <p>"Be that as it may," argued Lam-kwong, " 'It is too late to learn to swim
  as the vessel sinks.' "</p>

  <p>"However," continued Lin Ho resourcefully, "in order to convince you of
  your error, I will drink the wine myself," and recovering the cup he did
  so.</p>

  <p>"In that case, there can be no harm in accepting yours," declared
  Lam-kwong, who was feeling thirsty, and taking Lin Ho's cup he drained
  it.</p>

  <p>"This only goes to show how our natures have become blended, neither
  maintaining a full share of any quality," remarked Lin Ho. "Thus, although I
  possess your strength I wholly lack your deftness. The skill with which you
  bound Fang-tso--"</p>

  <p>"That is a very simple matter," contended Lam-kwong, who plainly had not
  entirely lost his former self-assurance among the milder nature of Lin Ho;
  "nor, despite your theory, has this hand grown less proficient."</p>

  <p>"Such a boast is easily maintained across a peaceful table, and the method
  even traced in spilled wine on the board, but here are ropes and one who will
  submit his body to the trial. Bind this person so that his strength cannot
  surmount the bondage and he will forfeit a resolute-minded mule to bear your
  load, so that you yourself may walk in comfort."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing to be lost in this encounter," reflected Lam-kwong,
  "since-- like the fig tree at Ka-pi's boundary--the fruit is wholly on one
  side. It would be gratifying to humiliate the egregious Lin Ho, and the mule
  that he holds out is certainly worth having." He therefore took up the
  challenge with alacrity, and, Lin Ho submitting, he bound him hand and
  foot.</p>

  <p>"Now, braggart," he announced, "the test is in the balance. Do what
  Fang-tso failed to achieve and you will deserve a peacock feather in your
  hat."</p>

  <p>Lin Ho strained at the knows but failed to move them. He rolled his great
  form from side to side and threw his body into sudden jerks, but nothing
  would avail. Lam-kwong could not withhold derision.</p>

  <p>"Already I seem to hear the hoof-beats of the mule upon the outward
  earth-road," was his taunt. "But give one heave more, princely warrior, and
  the toils may fly asunder."</p>

  <p>"I must not be pressed for time," panted Lin Ho, "for that was not
  provided. Admittedly the bonds are capably arranged, but, more than that, a
  strange and sudden lethargy assails me."</p>

  <p>"There is certainly a deficient look about your eyes, and your face has
  gone a very inferior colour," declared Lam-kwong. "Perhaps some inward cord
  at least has yielded. Would it not be prudent to summon an attendant?"</p>

  <p>"Should you do so and I am found thus bound and helpless, your priceless
  body would be piecemeal-sliced before a word is spoken."</p>

  <p>"It is well to bear that in mind," Lam-kwong confessed. "However, I can
  release you," and he made a movement of advance.</p>

  <p>"In that case," came from Lin Ho very faintly, "the mule necessarily fades
  from the engagement."</p>

  <p>"The path of compassion," remarked Lam-kwong, "seems beset with
  sharp-edged borders." Even as he spoke the magic began to involve him also,
  and he abruptly lay down on the floor. "This is highly distressing," he
  contrived to say. "The languor of which you spoke is now sapping my forces.
  What is this spell that has descended suddenly upon us both?"</p>

  <p>Lin Ho made no reply. He was already in the Middle Air, watching his
  opportunity, and before the limit predicted by the witch had passed, the
  spirit of Lam-kwong had likewise left his body.</p>

  <p>When Lin Ho contrived, through the other person's incapable suspicion,
  that he should drink the potion first, he recognized that this would give him
  a sufficient pause of time in which to outwit Lam-kwong. But in this he
  judged the ill-developed outlaw by a larger helmet than he could ever fill.
  No sooner did the spirit of Lam-kwong see its own discarded body lying there
  than it uttered a shriek of triumph and, projecting itself through space,
  occupied the empty tenement without a thought beyond the present. At the same
  moment the spirit of Lin Ho came down and resumed its rightful cover.</p>

  <p>"Hai!" exclaimed Lam-kwong, displaying his teeth with all his former
  arrogance. "At last the day of vengeance dawns, and your downfall is
  achieved, O most treacherous Lin Ho!"</p>

  <p>"Doubtless," replied Lin Ho deferentially, as he tore a shred from the
  bundle by his side and then approached Lam-kwong. "How is it your enlightened
  purpose to set about it, omnipotence?"</p>

  <p>"When I have enjoyed your terrors to repletion, I shall raise my voice,
  and the guard, finding me thus bound and helpless, your offensive body will
  be piecemeal-sliced before a word is spoken."</p>

  <p>"Perchance," agreed Lin Ho, and with every indication of humility he
  pressed the pad of cloth into Lam-kwong's slow-witted mouth. "Do not distress
  your already overtaxed throat, unnecessarily, chieftain. Presently one will
  enter and release you. Though," he added thoughtfully, "who that one will be
  and the manner of the release which he effects, it would be hazardous to
  forecast."</p>

  <p>There being nothing now of a helpful nature to detain him, Lin Ho took up
  the bundle on his shoulder and turned to go, but in response to the message
  of Lam-kwong's outspoken eye he paused to add farewell.</p>

  <p>"Prosperity, mightiest," was his unpretentious message. "Here at last our
  ways diverge. You remain stretched out in luxury, with a stalwart band of
  trusty followers responsive to your call. This one sets forth on an unknown
  path, with nothing between him and penury but the traffic of these simple
  wares which your forethought has provided. May you live a hundred years and
  beget a thousand sons!"</p>

  <p>Lam-kwong would certainly have said something equally appropriate in
  reply, but he was unable to release the words that filled his throat, and the
  occasion faded.</p>

  <p>At the gate the covetous Wong eyed Lin Ho's load aslant, but the warning
  laid on him had been too explicit to be disregarded, and with a cheerful
  saying the well-intentioned guest passed out and on his way.</p>

  <p>At a crossing of the road he paused to listen. In the direction of the
  house of Righteousness Long Established silence hung like the untroubled
  surface of a tranquil dream, but from the opposite direction there was a
  sound that caused Lin Ho to press back into a secluded angle of the wall.
  Presently one came into sight riding upon a careworn horse which he beat with
  a naked sword. He was of the height and width of two ordinary persons, his
  teeth jutting forward, and his face like the rising sun when the day portends
  a storm. As he passed Lin Ho, he cleared his throat of a curse against one
  whom he would very soon encounter. It was Fang-tso returning.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br>
  The Ambiguous Face Upon the One Found in<br>
  a Wood and the Effete Ming-shu's Dilemma</h2>

  <p class="first">As Kai Lung told the story of the treasure of Fang-tso, the
  overpowering heat and stupor slowly faded from the day, and when he had made
  an end of Lin Ho's trials, Hai Shin looked up with a much more alertly
  sustained air than he had before disclosed.</p>

  <p>"Certainly the ingenuity of the diffident Lin Ho enabled him to triumph
  where less crafty means would have left him in subjection," he remarked.
  "Yet, this being a relation of the strategy by which you hope to outwit
  Ming-shu, explain to my deficient mind how the devices that were appropriate
  here can be shaped to that contumacious rebel's downfall."</p>

  <p>"Omniscience," replied Kai Lung frankly, "it would be bootless to
  interpose a verbal screen between my very threadbare wit and the piercing
  rays of your all-revealing vision. The strategy involved in the story of Lin
  Ho was not that by which Ming-shu may be circumvented but the more pressing
  detail of how to retain you alive to effect our common purpose."</p>

  <p>"Have you then," demanded Hai Shin, in a not wholly sympathetic voice, "no
  plan whereby to reduce Ming-shu, and is the plea on which you held this one
  from his pious errand merely and empty boast?"</p>

  <p>"Exalted," was Kai Lung's just reply, "let your agile mind become an
  upright balance and weigh this person's claim. The story of Lin Ho was told
  to a specific end. Up to the moment when he began it, the notoriously
  incompetent Kai Lung had not so much as heard of that obscure one's being,
  and each of his successive involvements with its appropriate extrication was
  contrived from word to word. If, therefore, the one before you can so easily
  direct the fortunes of a person in whom he has no real concern, is it to be
  thought that he will fail to involve in destruction the opprobrious Ming-shu
  against whom he has a very deepset grievance?"</p>

  <p>"There is certainly something to be said for that," admitted the over
  captain, in a more conciliatory manner. "How then will you set about
  beginning?"</p>

  <p>"That will doubtless be revealed to me at the proper moment by the
  powerful spirits that are interesting themselves on my behalf," replied Kai
  Lung, assured that he had gained his point. "Even a weed requires congenial
  soil if it is to fructify, and the one discoursing with you is noticeably
  short of moisture."</p>

  <p>"In any case it is now too late in the day for me to think about
  self-ending, my lucky hour being past," assented Hai Shin; "so we may as well
  return to Chi-U together."</p>

  <p>"Your favour will protect me as a mantle, and on the strength of our being
  seen together I shall doubtless be able to arrange for shelter through the
  night and an occasional bowl of rice without an actual payment in advance,"
  was the storyteller's hopeful forecast. "Tomorrow, at an early gong-stroke of
  the day, I will present myself before your charitable door with a scheme
  devised to meet the situation."</p>

  <p>"When he specified 'together,' this custom-regarding person did not
  presume to imply the honour of going hand in hand," remarked the other, with
  an unworthy note of coldness in his tone. "Here, however, is a piece of money
  that will support you no less capably," and at the same time he indicated
  that Kai Lung should follow at a more respectful distance. "Let your
  leisurely footsteps keep time with a well-digesting mind, Kai Lung."</p>

  <p>"Would that your ever-protecting shadow might cover a whole province," was
  the response, as Kai Lung shouldered his penurious burden.</p>

  <p>It was characteristic of Ming-shu's low-minded taste that he had chosen as
  his stronghold a mountain pass that was inaccessible to force. Although the
  sides of this retreat were high and precipitous, the gorge in which the
  repulsive outlaw had pitched his camp was too wide for rocks or offensive
  messages to be hurled upon him from above, while the only portals that the
  fastness offered--one to the north and the other to the south--were so narrow
  that two defenders standing there abreast could resist an army.</p>

  <p>"This calls for a more than special effort on the part of my sympathetic
  ancestors if they are not to see their menaced Line dwindle incapably away,"
  ran the burden of Kai Lung's thoughts when he grasped the position as it then
  existed, though to Hai Shin, who fanned himself leisurely near at hand, he
  maintained an unbending face. "Even if no official band exists, pre </p>

  <p>eminence," he remarked to the one who stood beside him, "there are
  doubtless many resolute-minded persons in Chi-U who would not scruple to lend
  their aid on the side of loyalty and justice once they were assured that it
  could be prudently achieved?"</p>

  <p>"Suffer no derangement of your confidence on that account," replied the
  over-captain definitely. "In this matter of the extermination of Ming-shu's
  discordant horde we stand on a common footing and each will play an effective
  part. If you will but involve these chicken-stomached rebels in headlong
  flight, I will lead out a sufficiency of trusty henchmen to desecrate their
  shrines, pillage their abandoned tents, and stab fatally between the
  shoulders any who tarry too long about the scene of their undoing."</p>

  <p>"A concrete plan is in the process of being revealed to me by inner
  sources, but I must have a substantial force behind, even though their
  tactics are a purely spectacular function," bargained Kai Lung. "That much is
  assured?"</p>

  <p>"Short of taking part in actual warfare, blood-thirst in its most
  intensive guise may be safely looked for," was the agreeable reply. "There
  are not a few among the habitually disinclined of Chi-U who have grown
  respected and obese in this form of belligerency, they being, indeed, the
  mainstay of this person and his forerunners in office on those occasions
  alluded to, when from time to time it has been desirable to anoint the eyes
  of those higher in authority. Say on, O fount of ingenuity."</p>

  <p>"It is no longer possible to doubt that inspiration decides my path,"
  exclaimed Kai Lung as his mind sought backward. "In Ming-shu and the
  treacherous Shan Tien, opposed as they are by the empty arraignment of
  authority, it would be inept not to recognize the two hyenas and an effete
  tiger so presciently foreshadowed by the soothsayer of Ching; while the
  hollow sovereignty of a devastated province may be fitly likened to a sick
  cow's bones. This is the very quintessence of prognostication, and all
  uncertainty must fade and hesitation vanish."</p>

  <p>"So long as you are fore-ordained to sweep the despicable rabble from our
  path, none will gainsay that inspiration gilds your palate," assented Hai
  Shin freely. "Indicate where we can the fittest lie concealed while you clear
  out this nest of pirates."</p>

  <p>"Thus and thus shall you act," began Kai Lung; and he then proceeded to
  unfold his plan. "Anything that is still elusive in the way of detail will
  certainly be communicated by the attendant spirits of my ancestors as the
  occasion rises."</p>

  <p>"It shall be as you ordain; for, 'Tranquillity will roof a house but
  discord can wear away the foundations of a city,' " was Hai Shin's notable
  admission. "Lo, minstrel, I go to instruct the apter of the hirelings in the
  simple parts they have to play."</p>

  <p>When, on the morning of the day that next ensued, certain of the rebels
  were searching the ground that lay between Chi-U and their own
  ill-conditioned lair, to see if perchance an ambush lurked there (or haply a
  misdirected duck had opportunely strayed in that direction), the upraised
  voice of one in torment drew them to a grove of cedars. There, nailed by the
  ears to a tree of suitable girth and standing, was he who claimed their pity.
  He had the appearance of being a stranger from one of the Outer-Lands near
  beyond, for his skin was darker than the wont, his hair unplaited but trimmed
  in a fantastic spread, and his speech mild though laboured. For covering he
  wore crude cloth of an unusual pattern, and his manner was sincere and
  profuse.</p>

  <p>"Here is a fitting target for our barbs," cried some of the more
  illiterate of the band, and they would have shot their arrows forth, but one
  who wore a mark of stentority upon his sleeve spoke out.</p>

  <p>"It is not thus that refined warfare should be waged among polite and
  civilized communities," he cried, "nor could such an action be logically
  upheld. Inasmuch as the one before us has been harassed by the foe, it is
  only reasonable to sustain him. If on inquiry we are dissatisfied with what
  ensues, he will still be available for the more gravity-removing spectacle of
  goading blindfold among pits of boiling water, or being pegged down naked on
  a stirred-up ant hill. In the meanwhile, to have taken him alive increases
  our repute for zeal."</p>

  <p>Accordingly they drew out the spikes that held the stranger to the tree
  and led him back in triumph to the camp where presently Ming-shu impeached
  him in his tent.</p>

  <p>"Every detail of your two-faced past and discreditable present is recorded
  on our unfailing systematic tablets," asserted the pock-browed outcast,
  displaying his aggressive teeth in his usual manner, "so that no defence is
  lawful," and he continued to throw about the various weapons that were hung
  around him so as to confuse the other. "Now confess your various crimes
  unflinchingly."</p>

  <p>"Magnificence," replied the supine captive, "your lowly thrall--"</p>

  <p>"Slave!" interposed the insatiable Ming-shu.</p>

  <p>"Your excrescence," amended he who stood there docilely, "Mang-hi my
  illsounding name is and I am of the Outer-Land of Kham."</p>

  <p>"When I have consumed Chi-U, it is my fixed purpose to reduce Kham to an
  evil-smelling cinder," vaunted Ming-shu.</p>

  <p>"It is as good as done--at the mere opening of your lordly fiery mouth,"
  was the confident admission. "Howbeit, hearing in Kham that the Banners of
  the Knife had been raised in this our OverState, we held a muster, and the
  lot fell upon me that I should secretly encroach and extricate the
  truth."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" exclaimed Ming-shu. "Then are you now an admitted spy. Yet herein
  lies the obvious falsity of what you say, for if they of Chi-U had caught you
  thus, not your ears but your narrow-minded life would have been forfeit."</p>

  <p>"Such was their warmhearted purpose, highest, and without doubt it would
  so have been done, but as they led my too unworthy steps toward the roasting
  vat, an eagle, a mole, and a tortoise crossed our path. At this manifestation
  the augurs dare not proceed until the Books had been opened and the Omens
  searched, whereupon it appeared that the cause of those who destroyed me
  would be fated from that moment to be ruined."</p>

  <p>"If this is as you say, how comes it, then, that the elders of Chi-U did
  not set you free, but, rather, insured that you should pass as a captive into
  our requiting hands?" demanded Ming-shu in slow-witted uncertainty.</p>

  <p>"Omnipotence," replied Mang-hi, not without an element of reprehension in
  his voice, "wherefore? Why, but in the hope that you would fall into the
  snare and yourself incur the doom?"</p>

  <p>At the disclosure of this pitfall, much of the assurance faded from
  Ming-shu's doglike features, and he caught several flies to gain time before
  he spoke again, but when he did so it is doubtful if his heart was
  single.</p>

  <p>"A person of your stunted outlook need not be expected to know the
  Classics," he remarked, "but it is no less truly written, 'One cannot live
  forever by ignoring the price of coffins,' and your case, Mang-hi, is clearly
  analogous. Sooner or later in the day that powerful thinker, the Mandarin
  Shan Tien, will wake from his virtuous slumber, and then your fate will be
  decided. Meanwhile"--here the insufferable rebel beat upon an iron gong to
  summon an attendant--"you are, except for the formality of being tried,
  provisionally sentenced to one of the more distressing forms of ending. You,
  Li-loe, take charge of the condemned, and your head shall answer for his
  keeping."</p>

  <p>"That, chieftain," grumbled the mulish Li-loe as he led the captive forth,
  "is the only part of me that can ever answer for the others."</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br>
  The Concave-Witted Li-Loe's Insatiable Craving Serves a Meritorious End and
  Two (Who Shall Be Nameless) Are Led Toward a Snare</h2>

  <p class="cp">When they were come to a convenient distance from Ming-shu's
  tent, Li-loe indicated to Mang-hi that they should sit down upon the ground
  and converse more at their leisure.</p>

  <p>"For," he explained, "it seldom occurs that nothing may be gained by the
  interchange of mutual ideas. Thus, for instance, it lies with me, as the one
  who holds the rope about your neck, to lead you along comparatively smooth
  paths, for the short time that you are destined to be here among us, or to
  bring you up sharply against the rock-strewn traverses of my disfavour, and
  this almost entirely depends upon how you treat me from the outset."</p>

  <p>"Yet, if I am to be confined meanwhile, awaiting this high lord's
  pleasure, how shall the merit of ways or rock-strewn barriers affect our
  intercourse?" inquired Mang-hi simply.</p>

  <p>"It is very evident that you are certainly a barbarian from an
  outer-land," replied Li-loe, with an air of superior culture. "The reference
  to the prudence of arranging for my priceless friendship was in the nature of
  a primitive analogy that would have been very well understood by a person
  having the least experience of refinement. As it is, the only path you seem
  likely to discover is that leading by very short stages to the public
  execution ground."</p>

  <p>"But surely it ought not to be beyond our united effort to discover a path
  leading to a discreet seclusion where for a suitable consideration a jar of
  wine might shortly be obtained to quench our common thirst."</p>

  <p>"It is scarcely credible," exclaimed Li-loe, pausing as he scrambled to
  his feet to regard Mang-hi with a look of wonder, "that one who is so obtuse
  at grasping a well-meant suggestion should be so alert in going to the very
  essence of the matter, as it were unaided. . . . What is the full extent of
  your negotiable worth, O brother?"</p>

  <p>"Those who so charitably released me from the tree have already roughly
  computed that," explained the prisoner, "but we of the outer-lands are not
  prone to wear our taels about our sleeves," and by a movement which the
  covetous Li-loe could not satisfactorily follow, he produced a piece of money
  from a hidden spot among his garments. "Lead on, thou lodestone of
  moisture."</p>

  <p>When the piece of money had been spent and Li-loe had consumed the greater
  part of what it purchased, that shameless bandit sought by dropping his voice
  to a sympathetic cadence to penetrate still further into Mang-hi's
  bounty.</p>

  <p>"Behold," he urged, "between now and the moment of your extinction a
  variety of things may happen for which you are unprepared but wherein a
  trusty friend standing by your elbow and furnished with a few negligible
  coins to expend on your behalf would be worth his weight in jasper. Reflect
  well that you cannot carry money with you to the Above, no matter how
  ingeniously it is concealed about your person, and if you delay too long you
  will certainly incur the fate that overtook the procrastinating
  minstrel."</p>

  <p>"It is good to profit by the afflictions of another," agreed Mang-hi. "Who
  was he to whom you so dubiously refer, and what was the nature of his
  failing?"</p>

  <p>"Kai Lung the dog's name was, and this person succoured him as though we
  had been brothers. Yet in the event he played a double part, for having found
  a cask of wine concealed among some rocks he shunned this one ever after, so
  that at the last he came to a friendless and a very thirsty end, and his
  secret perished with him."</p>

  <p>To this recital Mang-hi made no response at first, and his head was sunk
  in thought. Then he looked round with a slowly gathering sense of
  recognition.</p>

  <p>"What you tell me is very unaccountable," he remarked at length, "for in
  some ambiguous way it is woven into the fabric of a dream that has
  accompanied me about the Middle Air for three nights past. This concerned a
  barrel of the rarest grape-juice spirit, as large around as three men's arms
  could span and very old and fragrant. Furthermore, one whom I now recognize
  as you accompanied me."</p>

  <p>"Proceed, O eloquence, proceed," encouraged the dissolute Li-loe. "Even to
  talk about a dream like that is better than to exist in a state of ordinary
  repletion."</p>

  <p>"Together we searched for this keg of potent liquid which, be it
  understood, was hidden from our knowledge . . . until we at last came to a
  rocky valley which I now recognize as this."</p>

  <p>"This!" exclaimed Li-loe, leaping to his feet to regard the gorge with
  acquisitive eyes. "And you dreamed the dream three times? Come, O sharer of
  everything I have, let us explore its length and breadth until you recognize
  the very rock that guards this treasure. Employ bamboo upon your sluggish
  mind, O would-be grateful friend; quicken as with a mental goad each fleeting
  image, and by means of an intellectual crowbar raise the barrier that
  separates the dimly grasped from the half-forgotten."</p>

  <p>"None of these will, alas, avail--" demurred Mang-hi.</p>

  <p>"We will, if necessary, regard each point of the landscape from every
  variety of angle," pleaded Li-loe. "In a dream, remember, you would
  inevitably be observing what is below from above, whereas now you are
  regarding what is above from below. Adapt your supple neck to this requisite
  inversion, comrade. Are we to be duped in the matter of this cask of wine of
  ours--"</p>

  <p>"It fades," rejoined Mang-hi definitely, "in that the keystone of the arch
  is missing."</p>

  <p>"Disclose yourself more fully."</p>

  <p>"When, in the progress of the dream, we reached this valley, we were met
  here by a being of the inner room whose face was like the petal of a perfumed
  flower. 'Inasmuch as she before you is a mouse,' she said with some
  significance, 'she creeps through narrow ways and she alone can lead you to
  the threshold of what you seek.' The vision faded then, but in a camp of
  warlike men it ensues that no such being--"</p>

  <p>"Manlet!" exclaimed Li-loe, casting himself bodily upon Mang-hi's neck and
  embracing him moistly and repeatedly in the excess of his gladness, "your
  lips are honey and the ripple of your voice is like the music made by pouring
  nectar from a narrow-throated bottle. Such a being as the one you designate
  is here in our midst and this cask of wine of mine is as good as on the
  spigot."</p>

  <p>"Here in this martial valley!" doubted Mang-hi. "Who then is the one whose
  furtherance we need, and how may we approach her?"</p>

  <p>Before committing himself to speech, Li-loe looked round several times and
  made a displeasing sound among his teeth to imply the need of caution.</p>

  <p>"It is necessary to have a thin voice now to escape the risk of a thick
  ear in these questionable times," was his modulated warning. "She whom you
  describe fills an anomalous position among us, for though a prisoner here, by
  balancing Shan Tien's rashness against Ming-shu's caution and setting the
  infatuation of the one against the disinclination of the other, she not only
  contrives to sway more authority than the leader of five companies of archers
  but walks along a muddy road dryshod."</p>

  <p>"If she exercises so much rule among the high ones, how can we, being both
  men of the common sort, hope to engage her ear?"</p>

  <p>"Leave that to me," replied Li-loe vaingloriously. "Although I have said
  nothing so far about it--for, after all, what is it to me who has
  occasionally held an umbrella above the heads of nobles?--when she was known
  as the Golden Mouse (whence the analogy of her saying to you) this Hwa-mei
  relied very greatly on my counsel in all affairs and though she has
  deteriorated overmuch in the ensuing years she seldom fails, even now, to
  return my greeting when we encounter. . . . I will contrive to cross her path
  when no one else is by, but it may be another matter to persuade her to give
  ear to an Outland man."</p>

  <p>"As to that," replied Mang-hi, "I have thought out something of a plan. I
  will gather for this purpose a red flower growing on a thorny stem (as she
  was wearing in the Middle Air), and this you shall give to her saying that
  the one of whom she has dreamed of late has made his way here to rejoin her.
  Thus she will be somewhat prepared for what may follow."</p>

  <p>"It may serve," admitted the shortsighted Li-loe. "The one thing needful
  is that you and she should have an opportunity to put your wits together to
  determine where this cask of mine is hidden."</p>

  <p>"Under the fostering eye of your benevolent authority, that should not be
  beyond our united skill," was Mang-hi's pronouncement.</p>

  <p>As Hwa-mei, warned by the sign that Li-loe had been enticed into conveying
  to her, did not fail to recognize Kai Lung through his disguise it would be
  obtuse to maintain the figment of Mang-hi's existence any longer. Let it be
  understood, therefore, that when, later in the day, the summon came and the
  feeble Li-loe led his prisoner to the tent where Ming-shu and Shan Tien sat
  in judgment, a movement of the curtain disclosed to Kai Lung that one who was
  not unmindful of his welfare was there to play a part.</p>

  <p>"Before you, high Excellence," deposed the calumnious Ming-shu, "is the
  ferocious brigand chief, Mang-hi, whom a mere handful of our intrepid guard,
  while peacefully engaged in gathering wild flowers outside the camp,
  surprised in the act of lurking in a wood, and made captive."</p>

  <p>"They would appear to have picked a very untamed blossom," remarked the
  gifted Mandarin pleasantly. "Why does his misfitting head still disfigure his
  unbecoming body?"</p>

  <p>"Doubtless to afford your all-discerning brilliance the high-minded
  amusement of deriding the obscene thing," replied Ming-shu, with his usual
  lack of refinement. "To a less degree, it has been judged more profitable to
  hold the dissipated thug as hostage, rather than dispose of him offhand.
  Subject to that, he is at the will of your unquenchable sense of
  justice."</p>

  <p>"Let the perjured transgressor give his own fictitious account of himself
  then," commanded Shan Tien, closing his eyes judicially.</p>

  <p>"Greatness," replied Kai Lung with a submissive gesture, "my unassuming
  name and the pacific nature of my journey have already been declared. What
  more remains?"</p>

  <p>"Clearly something, or the contumacious rebel would not be so desirous to
  conceal it," interposed a melodious whisper from behind the hangings.</p>

  <p>"The difficulty obviously arises, criminal, that being a prisoner here
  before us it is essential that you should have committed something by which
  you become imprisonable or the whole of our well-thought-out judicatory
  system falls to pieces." Here the inspired lawgiver placed the ends of his
  fingers together in an attitude that never failed to convince even the most
  hardened of his rigorous impartiality. "If your naturally retiring mind is
  not equal to the strain of disclosing what the offence may be, it will
  automatically devolve upon this unworthy but incorruptible upholder of the
  peace to supply it."</p>

  <p>"Wellspring of authority," prompted the hidden voice, "in that the
  recalcitrant clown has no obvious business here, is not the inference that he
  is an unusually determined spy reasonable?"</p>

  <p>"The imputation that you are an alien intruder seeking to acquire military
  information occurs to us," continued the enlightened official tentatively,
  "and the crime, punishable as it is with every form of correction from
  ridiculing your immediate ancestry to extirpating your entire posterity,
  would serve as well as any. But--"</p>

  <p>"As the insensate buffoon has been moving about the district freely, does
  not the opportunity present itself of enticing him into revealing something
  of the intentions of our adversary, high intelligence?" came the low-voiced
  suggestion.</p>

  <p>"But in order to incriminate you on this head, felon, it is necessary that
  something of a definite nature should be allegeable against you. The details
  of our own impregnable position offer no scope for your admitted talent, but
  doubtless some interesting points in connection with the obvious weakness of
  the defences of Chi-U have come under your many-sided notice?"</p>

  <p>"All-grasping," was the meet reply, "the one before you is a man of Kham,
  and Chi-U is of our Over-State. Is it becoming that a vassal should disclose
  particular information to those in arms against his suzerain?"</p>

  <p>"There is marrow in this bone, sublime, if you will but probe it," was the
  sage monition. "The backward oaf has knowledge that he will not readily
  disclose."</p>

  <p>"That remains to be tested," muttered the credulous Shan Tien, while
  Ming-shu, ever insistive, cried aloud:</p>

  <p>"Who is this scrofulous Mang-hi that he should speak before a provincial
  governor and one who is destined to lead the all-conquering Knife to victory
  of what is or is not seemly? Words fade at nightfall, but a branded sign of
  guilt upon the forehead endures while life remains. Let the irons be made
  ready."</p>

  <p>"Benevolence," entreated the one thus threatened, holding out his hands
  suppliantly toward Shan Tien, "is it your august will also that the unwitting
  should endure so oppressive a correction?"</p>

  <p>"Maintain your autocratic upper lip, exalted, and you will yet wrest
  information of great value from the misgiving knave," was the whispered
  counsel.</p>

  <p>"The mortar must harden if the wall is to hold good," replied Shan Tien
  inexorably. "Look for no flaccidity in this direction, culprit," and from
  outside there came the sound of dry wood being kindled.</p>

  <p>In the ensuing pause the captive raised a fold of the garb he wore and
  drew it across his face, and for a space of time wherein a man might count a
  hundred nothing could be heard but the sound of preparation taking place
  beyond and the offensive beat of Ming-shu's low-class breathing. Then the one
  arraigned before them bared his face.</p>

  <p>"It is contrary to the rites and strict observance of our high rule that
  the son of a chief's son should submit to this misusage. In our remote upland
  we have an adage designed to meet most of the contingencies of an ordinary
  person's everyday experience, and among us it is said, 'If when escaping from
  a dragon you should meet an advancing demon, turn back again.' " He lowered
  his hands submissively and bent an appropriate neck. "On this understanding,
  high puissance, ask what you will."</p>

  <p>Shan Tien and Ming-shu exchanged glances of ill-hedged satisfaction and
  the latter person cleared his self-willed throat.</p>

  <p>"In what way is it possible for us to inflict a calamity upon those of
  Chi-U without incurring any danger to ourselves?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Kai Lung thought for a moment, while the others watched him narrowly to
  see by the changing phases of his emotion whether his disclosure would be
  sincere.</p>

  <p>"The weakness of Chi-U lies in the leanness of its stores, not in any
  effeteness of its walls or vacillation among its intrepid guard--"</p>

  <p>"There is no official band," interposed the stiff-necked Ming-shu.</p>

  <p>"Your knowledge is exact," replied Kai Lung, "but each man of the city is
  trained to bear a part, while at no far-off date a strong company of the
  Tiger-clad is promised in relief."</p>

  <p>"It would be well to make our presence felt before those weak-kneed
  miscreants impede our footsteps," remarked Shan Tien with well-arranged
  anxiety.</p>

  <p>"Thus and thus," explained Kai Lung. "Tomorrow, about noon, a convoy
  designed to replenish Chi-U's need will slip through the western gorge.
  Without knowledge, the chance that you would be there to intercept them is
  remoter than the clashing of two stars. For this reason there will be no
  armed guard--for the cities of the route have none to spare. None will be
  there but the bearers of the loads and drivers, and this you will verify from
  a distance off before you swoop upon them. Baffled in the hope of this
  relief, Chi-U will succumb and its gates will open to the summons of your
  lifted hand. Lo, I have spoken and a noose is round my neck."</p>

  <p>"It is well--or it may be," was Shan Tien's pronouncement. "Yet of what
  does this train consist that it should be worth our while to seize it?"</p>

  <p>Ming-shu could not forbear a gesture of despair at the ineptitude revealed
  by this disclosure, for even to his unbalanced mind it was plain that the
  essence of the strategy lay in the deprivation of their foe rather than in
  the replenishing of their own store. He was recalled from this funereal mood
  by the gross elation of Shan Tien, rejoicing at what Kai Lung unfolded.</p>

  <p>"Nothing could be more auspicious, for it is by the lack of these very
  things that we most suffer: had Chi-U sent a messenger to ask what we would
  have it could scarcely have been bettered." (From behind the screen a thread
  of silver laughter gladdened Shan Tien's fatuous heart.) "This project
  carries."</p>

  <p>"How many of our company will the enterprise require?" demanded the more
  practical Ming-shu.</p>

  <p>"Ten or fifteen score of your indomitable horde will baffle every chance
  of failure."</p>

  <p>"That is as the destinies ordain," was Ming-shu's guarded answer; "for
  although we may protect the fruit we cannot see the roots. But"--here he bent
  on Kai Lung a sudden look of menace--"they will go armed and alert for guile,
  and you, Mang-hi, will travel in their midst with a gag closing your mouth
  and your throat chafed by a rope."</p>

  <p>"Yet even then, esteemed, my unfettered mind will be free to dwell on the
  bright vision of your rising fortune," replied Kai Lung discreetly.</p>

  <p>"Ming-shu and Shan Tien were ever of a cast," pondered the Golden Mouse,
  "and, as with a crystal jar, whatever is poured in at the neck can be seen
  filling the body. Had one come to them, freely offering knowledge, they would
  have derided his pretension, but now that they have had the appearance of
  exacting it by force, demons could not dissuade them. Truly it is written,
  'It is easier to put an ox into an egg-cup than for a man full of conceit to
  receive wisdom.'"</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br>
  In Which the Position of the Estimable Kai Lung Is Such That He Must Either
  Go Up or Down</h2>

  <p class="first">At an arranged gong-stroke after daybreak, three hundred
  men--one half of Ming-shu's ill-clad force--marched from the rebel stronghold
  with Kai Lung in their midst, a gag filling his mouth, his arms bound, and a
  degrading cord (the noisome Li-loe controlling it) hung about his neck. From
  the opening of a spacious tent, Shan Tien and Ming-shu stood forth to see
  them pass.</p>

  <p>"At the first sign of treachery, pull the noose tight and drive a heavily
  projected knife well between the uncouth shoulders of the repellent outcast,"
  was Ming-shu's offensive order, and the supine Shan Tien concurred.</p>

  <p>"Is it not due to the dignity of your button to be informed how the affair
  proceeds, mightiness?" enjoined an insidiously alluring voice from the shadow
  of the tent, and the obtuse Shan Tien coughed several times and arranged his
  girdle clasp to indicate high-minded unconcern. "Li-loe would prove a speedy
  runner in any case, so that his absence would entail no loss if there should
  be a fray. Would it not be in keeping with your special office that he should
  hasten back, either with or without the repulsive-featured hostage as the
  outcome may require, when the issue has been cast? This one, at any rate,
  will know no rest until the success of your strategic-minded foray gladdens
  her yearning ears."</p>

  <p>"It was balanced on my finger-tips to make some such command," replied the
  egregious Shan Tien, and he beckoned to a lesser chief and spoke as had been
  said.</p>

  <p>When the band had proceeded a short march to the west, Li-loe, under a
  pretext, dropped behind the rest, and as soon as they were unobserved he
  removed the gag from the storyteller's mouth.</p>

  <p>"It is well enough to talk to you about this wine of mine that we are on
  the point of recovering," he said, "but it would be even more attractive to
  hear your assurance in reply. Now, as regards the exact size of the cask,
  whereof you spoke of three men's encircling arms? In this respect men vary,
  yet it would be manifestly unjust to take three of only meagre stature. Last
  night, on the feigning of a jest, I induced three sturdy fellows to join
  hands, and the full measure. . . ."</p>

  <p>In this strain the niggardly Li-loe filled himself with his own
  imagination until, about noon, the company reached the border of the rocky
  terraces that overlooked the plains. Here they lurked in hiding, not daring
  to emerge until the defenceless nature of the convoy was disclosed, and on
  this hung Kai Lung's fate. When, soon after the appointed time, a column of
  unarmed men was seen winding along the track that led toward Chi-U, the rebel
  host raised a loud cry of triumph and launched headlong forward in pursuit.
  At this display the assemblage of bearers cast down their loads in terror
  and, without staying to make any retort whatever, fled back to the safety of
  the intricate passes they had come by. At the same time the horsemen cut
  loose their charges and urged them incessantly on toward the safety of Chi-U.
  The effect of the surprise was immediate and complete, and Ming-shu's
  unbridled horde at once began to take possession of the spoil, for many of
  the bales had burst open in their fall, and the contents lay scattered.</p>

  <p>"There is no longer any doubt as to the success of the foray," declared
  the under-chief to whom Shan Tien had spoken. "Ordinary warriors Li-loe and
  Kong are instructed to return without delay and relate to the High One in
  Command the outcome of the venture. And should the name of the reticent Chan
  be favourably garnished in the telling," added the one who thus described
  himself, veiling his voice discreetly, "it will be mutually creative of
  profitable esteem."</p>

  <p>To this the sombre-mannered Kong made no reply beyond a servile flourish
  of his open hand, but Li-loe (distrustful for his share of what was taken)
  would have raised a dejected plea had not Kai Lung contrived to pluck him by
  the sleeve and whisper in his ear.</p>

  <p>"It is better to have the chance of netting a turbot than to have already
  caught a shrimp," was his admonition. "Now, with the camp more or less
  denuded, is our chance to search unseen." And the ever-craving Li-loe
  assented.</p>

  <p>With about half the distance still untravelled, they came to a cleft cut
  sharply through the rock, where each must pass alone. It was toward this spot
  that Kai Lung had shaped his preparation when he had stood in the open space
  within Chi-U and called for six intrepid men who should be the standard
  bearers of a righteous cause. "If there be any who have suffered the
  unforgettable offence at the unclean rebels' hands, now is the opportunity to
  exact a strict account," he cried, and twelve had answered to the call. "Your
  names will be extolled in characters of gold," had been his forecast as he
  made a choice, and to the remnant, "and yours no less than these, for to all
  a part will in due course be given." These chosen six now crouched beyond the
  rock and, as Kong and Li-loe passed through, their arms were seized and they
  were held securely.</p>

  <p>"The time for dissimulation has gone by," pronounced Kai Lung in his
  natural voice, "and this business will shortly assume another colour. Which
  rogue of the two has the more supple tongue?"</p>

  <p>The only reply Kong deigned was to spit in that direction, but the
  pusillanimous Li-loe fell upon his knees and beat the unyielding earth
  beneath his two-faced forehead.</p>

  <p>"All-conquering," he exclaimed, to the steady clash of his abasement,
  "there is no evasion to which I would not bend my pliant throat to retain my
  worthless life. Lay the weight of your authority upon my allegiant shoulders
  to practically any extent, for I am not yet fit to face the Records."</p>

  <p>"Not only will your life be spared, but enough wine will be allotted to
  float you in a state of bliss through three quarters of each moon--if you but
  play your part."</p>

  <p>"Omnipotence," declared the other freely, "on those terms I am with you in
  this world and the next."</p>

  <p>"Take heed lest you precede me very substantially in both," was Kai Lung's
  stern menace. "It is not befitting that the more abject is the one who must
  be spared, but yonder dog would maintain a stubborn end at any hazard.
  Howbeit, he has had the chance and made a becoming choice. . . . Now take the
  uncompromising outlaw to a little space apart, and there, with as slight an
  inconvenience to his distinguished self as possible, remove his attractive
  head."</p>

  <p>"May your perjured-hearted father grill in Hades to the end of all time
  and apes void upon the fallen Tablets of your race," was Kong's farewell
  parting, and he was led away by those who held him.</p>

  <p>"It is enough to recall the worthy Yen-tsu in a similar
  position--'Blessings will cause a strong town to flourish, but the curses of
  the vicious cannot destroy even a mud-built wall.' " Thus Kai Lung reassured
  his fellows, and he added, "Let each now move to his appointed task, and
  aptly."</p>

  <p>Leaving one of the band to guard Li-loe, the rest fell to their different
  parts, and very soon a transformation had been wrought. One brought Kai Lung
  a special kind of lye in which he washed off his stain, while another combed
  and drew out his matted hair and trimmed it as a tail. In place of his
  Outland garb and barbarian trappings, they robed him in everything that Kong
  had worn and in various ways changed him to that one's likeness. Without much
  hurt, an appearance of wounds was given to his face and body, and blood was
  splashed both on him and on Li-loe, though it was not deemed necessary to
  indicate actual violence toward the latter beyond a spear-thrust through the
  rear part of his trousers. In the meanwhile, Kong's severed head had been
  transformed no less completely, a stain deepening its tone, the hair spread
  out as Kai Lung's hair had been, and the gag forced between his rebellious
  teeth; nor was the knife withheld to disguise wherein they differed. Thus
  prepared, the two resumed their journey, Li-loe, at a command, bearing the
  burden.</p>

  <p>"Mightiness," ventured that feeble person when they were alone again, "so
  far a feeling of unworthiness has sealed these slow-witted lips. Yet have we
  not been as the two sons of one father, with all things shared in common? Now
  touching this ambiguous head I bear--"</p>

  <p>"Peace, dullard," replied Kai Lung with some dignity; "for you are as you
  are and it is very necessary that I should now instruct you. Dwell well on
  this: that when we approach the camp my wounded face will be all but
  concealed within this bandage, and, for support, my clinging arm will be
  about your shoulder."</p>

  <p>"So long as I am by your side, esteemed, you need fear no stumble."</p>

  <p>"So long as you are, I shall not," was the admission. "But should you
  attempt to disengage yourself or to vary what you are to say, I may,
  perchance, and in slipping this small but extremely pointed knife that I
  shall hold beneath my cloak and against your middle ribs will inevitably be
  thrust forward. . . ."</p>

  <p>"Revered," protested Li-loe very earnestly, "I clearly begin to foresee
  that in whatever tale we are to tell our words will blend together as
  harmoniously as the two parts of a preconcerted ballad--though between the
  madness that has assailed you on the one hand and the madness that will
  certainly assail the bloodthirsty Ming-shu shortly on the other, I see very
  little likelihood of our song reaching a happy ending."</p>

  <p>"That is because you have a weak, deficient mind, or you would have begun
  to deduce an ordered scheme emerging," explained Kai Lung more kindly. "What
  was in progress when we left the captured spoil, O witless?"</p>

  <p>"That is easily expressed," was the overcast reply. "The sordid-hearted
  crowd were seizing what they could. The greater part of this by some
  mischance consisted of the dress and insignia of a strong company of the
  Imperial guard, and the ragged barefoot crew were triumphantly
  re-fitting."</p>

  <p>"Thus," agreed Kai Lung. "And by a benevolent conjunction of the time and
  place they will return at nightfall waving the captured banners of authority
  and wearing the Tiger-garb. How regrettable will be the outcome if Ming-shu,
  having heard our tale of treachery and rout, should mistake them for the foe
  and fall upon them in the darkness unaware!"</p>

  <p>"Stripling," declared Li-loe with a gathering look of insight, "what I
  hitherto took to be an empty shell would seem to enshrine a solid kernel. Yet
  this scheme of yours must proceed along the razor edge of chance so that a
  single false step will undo it."</p>

  <p>"The same path confronts those who oppose us also," replied Kai Lung, "and
  Ming-shu and Shan Tien are notoriously uncertain on their feet. For the
  emergencies that may arise, remember that it is better to have an ingenious
  mind than a belt adorned with weapons."</p>

  <p>"In the circumstances, there is nothing unreasonable in disclosing that I
  too have long nourished a secret ill-bred grudge against the obtuse
  Ming-shu," declared Li-loe profusely. "We go therefore hand in hand."</p>

  <p>"Truly," agreed Kai Lung. "Yet it would be as well not to forget meanwhile
  that the unusually sharp-tempered knife to which this person has already
  reluctantly referred will still be grasped in the other.'</p>

  <p>When Ming-shu and Shan Tien learned of the crafty snare in which one half
  of their followers had perished, and had seen the offensive head of the
  profane Mang-hi, it is questionable which of the two expressed himself with
  less regard for the pellucid style of the Higher Classics. The former person
  indeed had become so involved in a complicated analogy based on Mang-hi's
  remoter ancestors, that Li-loe, urged on by something that he felt rather
  than saw, did not deem it unwise to interrupt him.</p>

  <p>"Thereafter, High Excellences," he continued, "lurking together in a cave
  we overheard their truculent war lords conferring. 'Let us,' proclaimed the
  highest in command, 'seek out this misbegotten nest of lepers, led by a
  weak-kneed upstart, and put them to the sword. The feeble-witted earthworm
  thus described' (so ran his veracious words, nobilities) 'can no longer have
  anything beyond a cringing remnant answering to his call. Added to this, we
  will so contrive that dusk shall mask our coming and the surprise will be
  complete.' To this they all agreed, rejoicing, and seeing that the assembly
  had begun, we crept away unseen."</p>

  <p>"Wisdom guided your feet," murmured the recreant Shan Tien, after he and
  his Chief of Military Arrangements had engaged each other in a somewhat
  lengthy silence. "To retire unobtrusively is often the most unspeakably
  galling form of contempt with which it is possible to treat a despised
  antagonist. . . . The Way is still open to the north, and clad as two
  wandering pilgrims--"</p>

  <p>"Mandarin," interposed Ming-shu, in a not entirely graceful voice, "when
  the path is slippery, it is safer to go two paces forward than one pace back.
  In the words of the not wholly felicitous apophthegm, we who stand here
  banded together are wedged in between the Head Evil Spirit and the
  illimitable Whang Hai. . . . Not even a sightless mendicant would take either
  of us for anything but a steady eater."</p>

  <p>"High presence," came a meek but very attractive voice from somewhere
  unseen, "is it permissible for so small and abject a person as myself to
  whisper in your weighty ears?"</p>

  <p>"Speak," was the grudging assent. "Even a gnat may disclose a hidden point
  somewhere."</p>

  <p>"What is this sudden misgiving that has for the moment eroded your usually
  large-hearted stomachs?" exclaimed Hwa-mei reliantly. "The valiant Ming-shu
  was undoubtedly correct when he spoke of the danger of going back, and the
  ever-prescient Shan Tien was no less inspired when he shrank from the
  repugnant thought of pressing forward."</p>

  <p>"Thus and thus," rose from Ming-shu's acrimonious throat. "That leaves us
  where we are."</p>

  <p>The Golden Mouse struck her symmetrically formed hands together with a
  refined gesture of well-expressed relief.</p>

  <p>"Ming-shu has gone to the very nucleus of the matter and plucked the
  ill-set words from my all-too-loquacious mouth," she exclaimed. "As he so
  epigramatically insists, this is the spot on which to meet the uninventive
  foeman and overreach him."</p>

  <p>"Haply," conceded Shan Tien, with a hasty assumption of one of his most
  telling magisterial bearings, "but the versatile Arranger of Martial Exploits
  did not carry the analogy to the extent of revealing how the suggested snare
  is to be effected."</p>

  <p>"Truly," agreed Hwa-mei; "your mind is like a crowded storehouse, and
  unheard-of wisdom drops from your ripe lips in masses. . . . As the
  Inscrutable was on the point of saying, the obvious way to baffle the
  frozen-witted interloper is to turn the looked-for surprise on his part into
  an even greater astonishment on ours."</p>

  <p>"Doubtless," was Ming-shu's sombre comment; "and having thus exposed the
  farseeing Mandarin's inner thoughts, would it be too excessive a labour to
  penetrate a little into the rich mine of strategy and disclose a specific
  detail?"</p>

  <p>"The deduction is inexorable," replied Hwa-mei, with a delicately balanced
  look of gratitude at both together. "When the loathsome marauders seek to
  creep up at the dusk of evening, they will find nothing interposed between
  them and success. The paths will be unwatched and the sentry of the gate
  engaged in the insidious charms of fan-tan elsewhere. Half, perchance, of the
  offensive crowd will have passed in and be assembled when our one heavily
  loaded but never so far discharged weapons of assault will be exploded in
  their direction. At the same preconcerted moment, a chosen band concealed in
  the heights outside will loosen an avalanche of rock down upon the throng
  lurking beyond the gate. When the confusion is at its zenith our intrepid
  host will launch itself against the unsightly rabble, and the distressing
  affair will be all but over. Was not that, Highest, the trend of your
  enlightened meaning?"</p>

  <p>"Crudely expressed, you have indeed struck the skewer on its business
  end," admitted Shan Tien, rising. "Where is this person's most
  terror-inspiring suit of armour laid?"</p>

  <p>Ming-shu made no remark, but he left the tent with a settled look, and
  presently his two-edged voice could be heard emitting orders.</p>

  <p>Kai Lung was meanwhile seated on a high place apart, with his arm still
  cherishing Li-loe's support. Hwa-mei went from point to point, speaking
  hopefully to the various defenders of the camp and inspiring them to put up a
  stubborn resistance to the end. Thus the afternoon was worn away and the time
  of middle light arrived.</p>

  <p>The battle of Running Mandarin Valley (as, for some reason, those who were
  there have designated it) has been so often described in terms of literary
  perfection that it would be almost profane for this attenuated brush to
  attempt its details. It is generally admitted that the mutual surprise of all
  concerned might have been less effective had not certain of Kai Lung's most
  intrepid followers imperceptibly joined the return throng under cover of the
  withdrawing light and at the first shock of attack raised the enlightened
  cry, "Treachery is here at work, and the camp has, in our absence, been
  carried by assault. Let us retake it at any hazard!" From that stage onward,
  every man on both sides fought with the tenacity of vampires, so that when
  Hai Shin, somewhat later, ventured to lead in a hastily collected bodyguard
  by the neglected northern gate, with the avowed intention of "obliterating as
  with a sponge the embers of rebellion," he found none to bar his passage. So
  evenly matched had been the two divisions of the force--the opening assault
  on the part of the defenders being exactly balanced by the superiority of the
  weapons with which the others had been refurnished--that from the outset a
  common extinction was the only logical and possible solution. So harmoniously
  was this accomplished that in practice every ordinary warrior slew every
  other ordinary warrior, every stripe-man every other stripe-man, every
  under-chief every other under-chief, and thus and thus, up to the two
  overlings of the two contesting sides whose bodies were found locked together
  in a tiger-like embrace. Ming-shu and Shan Tien alone survived (owing to both
  remaining), together with Kai Lung, Li-loe, and the Golden Mouse--these
  latter not being officially "in the vigour " as the melodious phrase of
  military usage has it. It is owing to this unshrinking demonstration of the
  Essential Principles of Poise and Equipoise, leading up by an inexorable
  chain of uncontroversial subordinates to the only rational and conceivable
  termination, that this otherwise commonplace encounter is so often given as a
  subject for antithetical treatment in the triennial competitions.</p>

  <p>When the last person had been killed on either side, Kai Lung made his way
  to Ming-shu's tent, confident of coming face to face with that opaque-eyed
  usurper and of wringing from him an admission of his ill-spent life before he
  Passed him Upward. For this purpose, the storyteller, who still wore the
  habiliments of Kong, had removed the covering from his face, and he had
  rearranged his hair as Mang-hi's had wont to be and resumed some of that
  warrior's trappings, so that he might the more readily convince Ming-shu of
  his knowledge of these matters. In this the Destinies intermingled to an
  unexpected close, for no sooner had the conscience-haunted rebel discovered
  the one who sought him, standing in the admittedly deceptive light of the
  great sky lantern outside the open door, than he threw up his abandoned hands
  effetely and sank down to the floor.</p>

  <p>"Behold," he exclaimed in an uncertain voice, "when an event of this sort
  happens, it is no longer profitable to deny that the one subsiding here has
  spent a thoroughly abandoned life and practised every sort of infamy. Kai
  Lung has been pursued relentlessly in the past, and is now doubtless Beyond;
  Kong has been struck down in this one's service, maintaining a disloyal
  cause, and he has obviously Gone Up, while Mang-hi's picturesque head is at
  this moment somewhere about the tent. That these three industriously disposed
  persons should spare their priceless time to appear in a composite Shape
  before me pithily indicates that I have nothing more to hope for." Ming-shu
  accordingly loosened the hold by which he maintained his Constituent Elements
  together, and his liberated Shadow at once set off toward the Upper Air.</p>

  <p>The agreeable-minded Mandarin Shan Tien was never exactly seen again by
  any actual person. On this account it has sometimes been claimed that he must
  have thrust himself into the most fiercely contested quarter of the battle
  and there been cut to pieces. Others, however, contend that, rather than
  suffer the indignity of so important an official being touched by the profane
  hands of those inferior to his button, the High Powers had invited him to
  Pass Above without going through the ordinary formalities of defunction. At a
  later period, an unworthy rumor was wafted about the province that an
  impressive personage, who was liable in any emergency to assume a richly
  magisterial manner, was in the habit of making a desultory livelihood in a
  distant city by picking up articles of apparent value before the eyes of
  wealthy strangers. But this can only be regarded as being in the nature of a
  craftily barbed shaft from the invidious lips of malice.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br>
  Wherein the Footsteps of the Two Who Have Induced<br>
  These Printed Leaves Assume a Homeward Bend</h2>

  <p class="first">Nothing could exceed the honourable distinction with which
  Kai Lung was greeted by all classes of those dwelling about Chi-U after the
  destruction of the rebel host. The lean and expectatious were never weary of
  professing their readiness to consume an unspecified abundance of rice spirit
  to the accompaniment of a hope that the storyteller's sinews would be thereby
  strengthened, and no matter how urgent might be the business on which he was
  engaged rich merchants did not disdain to stop him repeatedly as he went
  about the Ways to enjoy the gladness of shaking hands with themselves before
  him. Some of the actually charitable expressed a willingness, in view of the
  obviously threadbare state of the one with whom they conversed, to supply him
  with the needs of life at an appreciably lower rate than was usually imposed
  on strangers, and on Kai Lung displaying the empty folds of his deficient
  sleeve, a special edict of the Chi-U Confraternity of Impost Adjusters was
  issued, permitting him to pass round his collecting bowl at any time without
  being liable to any humiliating regulations.</p>

  <p>But among the marks of approval showered upon Kai Lung, that devised by
  Hai Shin was perhaps the most delicately arranged of all. In some obscure way
  unknown to the artless over-captain himself, the valour displayed by Hai
  Shin, so soon after the taking of the camp that it imperceptibly merged into
  the forefront of the battle, had reached the ears of his higher-lords in
  office, and to mark appreciation of the economical way in which he had
  conducted the affair throughout he had been raised to the position of
  under-overling, with authority to command six hundred warriors and permission
  to carry a green silk umbrella when on duty. Not to be outclassed,
  disinterested persons in Chi-U had suggested to others that to entice the
  unsuspecting Hai Shin into an assembly and there to weight his sleeve with a
  bag of silver would be a suitable return for their deliverance.</p>

  <p>"So that," explained Hai Shin, on the morning of the day in question,
  "after this person has recovered from his bereft-of-words surprise, and has
  suffered the one seated upon a chair to compel acceptance of the tribute,
  there will ensue a more or less unpleasant gap before dispersing, to be
  filled up as inoffensively as can be. If, therefore, you could be induced to
  lift up your always harmonious voice, it would relieve the admitted tension,
  and at the same time, without any actual outlay to yourself, you would be
  privileged to witness the interesting ceremony from one of the foremost
  benches. Nor should it be ignored that early rice, enhanced by a reasonable
  allowance of health-giving raisin wine, will be provided."</p>

  <p>"It suffices," replied Kai Lung gracefully; "and since a virtuous outcome
  could never have been reached without the miraculous protection of the
  watchful spirits of my ancestors, the mediocre story chosen for this
  seasonable occasion will be that which concerns Kin Weng."</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>The Story of Kin Weng and the Miraculous Tusk</em></p>

  <p class="first">In the golden days of the enlightened dynasty of Ming, a
  company of artificers who have remained illustrious throughout all later time
  dwelt about the Porcelain Tower in the city of Tai-chow. Their crafts were
  many and diverse, there being workers in gold and silver, in jade and
  precious stones, in wood, in lacquer and the various lustres, even in brass,
  leather, horn, and material of the cruder sorts on which the resource of
  their inspired art conferred an enchanting grace, but most highly esteemed
  among them all were those who carved ivory with patient skill and cunning
  lore, and of this favoured band Chan Chun was the admitted head.</p>

  <p>For many years Chan Chun had dwelt beneath the gilt sign of the
  Conscientious Elephant, gathering in honours with his right hand and more
  substantial profits with his left, until nothing that an ordinary person
  could desire lay outside his grasp; but whether this unvarying prosperity was
  due to the directing efforts of good Beings, or whether Chan Chun was in
  reality the sport and laughing stock of malignant Forces, who, after the
  too-frequent manner of their kind, were merely luring him on through a
  fancied security to an end which should be both sudden and inept, cannot yet
  be suitably revealed. Nevertheless, it is aptly written, "The reputation
  through a thousand years may depend on the conduct of a single moment," and
  Chan Chun was no magician to avoid the Destinies.</p>

  <p>As befitted his position, Chan Chun had an underling whose part it was to
  do the more menial service of his task. This youth, who bore the unassuming
  name of Kin and the added one of Weng, had thus long been accustomed to shape
  the blocks of ivory in their rougher state, to impart an attractive polish to
  the finished work, and to apply appropriate pigments in cases where the exact
  representation might otherwise have been in doubt. He also removed the
  evidence of toil and restored the work-room to a seemly state of order at the
  earliest beam of light on each succeeding day, sharpened the tools that had
  been in use and reassembled them on an appointed plan, bargained with tribes
  of beggars (when they were too numerous to be expelled by force) as to the
  price of an agreed immunity, intervened with reasonable excuses of Chan
  Chun's absence, infirmity, or, if necessary, death, before those who
  presented themselves inopportunely, and the like. Yet, in spite of the
  admittedly low-conditioned nature of his duties, Kin was of a sincere mind
  and a virtuous heart. Next to his own immediate ancestors he venerated the
  majestic carvers of the past, while to Chan Chun he gave an unstinted
  admiration, hoping that one day he might follow unostentatiously and at a
  sufficiently respectful distance in his master's well-established footsteps.
  Every moment that could be snatched from the rigorous execution of his
  unremunerative task he spent toward the attainment of this end, either in a
  contemplation of the Symmetrical or by making himself more proficient in the
  practice of the art, using for this purpose Chan Chun's discarded tools and
  such scraps of ivory as he himself might legitimately throw away and then
  pick up again. Thus the seasons passed, but Chan Chun saw in Kin only the one
  who served his hand.</p>

  <p>To the south of Tai-chow lay a dense and pathless forest wherein might be
  found every kind of wild growth which the soil of that province could
  sustain. Recognizing in the harmonious contrasts afforded by this profusion
  all the essentials to a style of classical purity, Kin was in the habit of
  resorting to these glades in order to imbibe the spirit of their influence.
  Too often the few hours which the parsimonious usage of the exacting Chan
  Chun allowed were only sufficient for a meagre contemplation of the outer
  fringe, but sometimes, on a sufficiently convincing plea or during that one's
  absence, he was able to secure a longer respite.</p>

  <p>It was on one of these occasions, when he had penetrated more deeply into
  the funereal recesses of the wood, that Kin (guided admittedly by the
  protecting shadows of his grateful ancestors) reached a grassy place,
  sufficient in extent to tax the skill of an expert bowman to shoot across. In
  the opening thus provided stood an ancient pagoda, its pinnacle merged among
  the branches of a spreading cypress tree, within whose shade a maiden of
  engaging personality sat in an attitude of graceful unconcern as she arranged
  her abundant tresses.</p>

  <p>"Plainly there are things of which I am yet ignorant, in spite of a
  lifelong contemplation of the Symmetrical," remarked the youth aloud. "Here
  are three objects as widely differing in their forms as a maiden, a venerable
  pagoda and an overhanging cypress tree, yet each fully conforms to the most
  rigid standard of a classical perfection, nor is any one less harmonious than
  another. In view of the frequently expressed apophthegm that all Art is a
  matter of selection, to find these three, among which it is impossible to
  distinguish any one as pre-eminent, within so narrow a limit as a woodland
  glade, introduces an element of doubt."</p>

  <p>"Such words would seem to indicate a student of the Higher Excellences,"
  remarked a sympathetic voice, and turning, Kin perceived, close at hand, one
  who had all the appearance of an elderly philosopher. "Doubtless you are a
  person of some literary attainment, qualifying for the Competitions?"</p>

  <p>"Far from that being the case, my occupation is wholly menial in its
  ignoble outlook, nor does the future stretch beyond tomorrow's toil," replied
  Kin freely. "If, therefore, your agreeable condescension sprang from a
  mistaken cause, do not hesitate to continue our discourse in your ordinary
  voice."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," replied the other affably. "I would willingly learn
  somewhat more of your condition. As you unsuspectingly approached this spot,
  I cast the outline of your destiny according to the various signs you bear.
  Although I possess certain supernatural powers, I am not really proficient in
  this branch of geomancy, and my only thought was to obtain a trifling
  practice, but to my surprise I found that in some unaccountable way the lines
  of our future destinies converge."</p>

  <p>"Even a snail can fly through space if it attaches itself to a dragon's
  tail," replied the unpretentious Kin, and thus encouraged he willingly laid
  bare the mediocre details of his threadbare life. When he had finished, the
  stranger continued to regard him narrowly.</p>

  <p>"A noticeable career of one kind or another certainly awaits you, although
  my meretricious skill is unfortunately not profound enough to indicate its
  nature," he remarked benignantly. "Rest satisfied, however, that henceforth I
  shall certainly be exerting my unnatural powers in your direction."</p>

  <p>"If the destiny is already assured, might it not more prudently be left
  wholly to the more experienced Forces?" suggested Kin cautiously. "You have
  spoken of your efforts in terms which indicate that the outcome of their use
  may prove somewhat disconcerting to the one on whose behalf they are
  invoked."</p>

  <p>"Do not nourish any misgiving on that account," replied the philosopher
  with a reassuring smile. "Certain things lie beyond my admitted power, it is
  true, but I could, without inconvenience, change you into an edible toad or
  cause a thick growth of fur to cover you from head to food by the exercise of
  a single magic word. If you doubt this--"</p>

  <p>"By no means!" exclaimed Kin hastily. "Your authoritative word puts me
  entirely at my ease. Yet, as the acrimonious Chan Chun will by this time have
  discovered an empty stool, I will, without further attrition of your precious
  moments, walk backward from your lordly presence."</p>

  <p>"You have been honourably welcome to my feeble entertainment, which
  henceforth you can associate with the obscure name of Che-ung," courteously
  replied the one who thus described himself. "In the meanwhile, frequent
  indications of my protecting hand will disclose themselves from time to time
  to preserve intact the silken thread of your remembrance."</p>

  <p>"If the suggestion should not be deemed too concise, a favourable occasion
  will present itself when the one upon whose bounty I depend stands at the
  gate to welcome my return."</p>

  <p>"The occasion is befitting," replied Che-ung graciously, "and a timely
  intervention shall arise. Furthermore, in order to guide you through the
  forest by an unknown path--one more suited to your present haste--Fa Ming,
  the sole remaining blossom of my attenuated tree, shall, in a suitable guise,
  precede you on your way."</p>

  <p>With these auspicious words, the venerable personage raised his
  necromantic staff and waved it toward the maiden who was still engrossed in
  the arrangement of her glossy hair before a shield of burnished copper.
  Immediately she disappeared, and in her place there stood a sleek white bird
  intent on preening its resplendent plumage. When Che-ung again made a magic
  sign, however, no further manifestation took place, the shapely creature
  remaining immersed in a gratified contemplation of its own attractions. A
  faint line of annoyance corroded the austere smoothness of the philosopher's
  brow.</p>

  <p>"It is one thing to turn ordinary persons into the semblance of
  apparitions of a different part, but it is quite another to induce them to
  preserve the unities in their new habit," he remarked, with engaging
  frankness, toward Kin's ear. Indeed, the graceful being continued to regard
  itself approvingly from one angle after another, despite the formidable magic
  projected against it by the persistent waving of Che-ung's all-powerful
  staff, nor was it until, in an access of engendered bitterness, the
  painstaking wizard cast the wand violently in its direction that the one whom
  he had referred to as both the Hand and the Foot of his declining years began
  to bend her acquiescence toward his wishes. Thenceforward, however, her
  amiable compliance did not falter, and she hovered continuously before the
  grateful Kin, guiding him along a secret track so that presently he came
  clear of the forest at a point much nearer to Tai-chow than the most skillful
  wood-farer might have found possible.</p>

  <p>It was not long before Kin encountered what might reasonably be accepted
  as a token of Che-ung's sustaining care. In the few hours that spanned his
  absence from its walls a great caravan of merchants had reached the city from
  the Outer Lands and filling the narrow Ways with laden beasts and hurrying
  slaves were even then vying with each other to extol the richness of their
  wares and to announce at what resort their commerce should be sought. Some,
  more zealous than their fellows, did not halt to shake out their sandals and
  partake of tea, but pressed forward without pause to offer the enticement of
  an early choice to those whose custom they esteemed. Thus it befell that, at
  the gate before the Conscientious Elephant, a laden camel stood while a
  sombre attendant, who restrained its impatience by means of a cord passed
  through its nose, from time to time spoke of his master in terms of
  unfavourable comparison with the Keeper of the Pit.</p>

  <p>"Prosperity attend your gracious footsteps," remarked Kin in polite
  greeting (and also because he wished to learn their purpose there) as he
  raised the latch. "The Street called Fragrant is honoured by your restful
  shadow."</p>

  <p>"It would not be, had not a misbegotten planet of the unluckier sort been
  in the ascendant at the moment of this person's ill-timed birth," replied the
  attendant darkly. "Is it not enough to have toiled across a self-opinionated
  desert, leading this perverse and retaliatory daughter of two she-devils by
  an utterly deficient cord, without being compelled to wait interminable
  gong-strokes in a parched and plague-infected byway of Tai-chow while the
  rest-house of the Garden of Musical Virtues spreads its moist allurement but
  a short span farther to the east?"</p>

  <p>"Your well-expressed offence causes the strings of my compassion to
  vibrate in harmony," replied Kin with genial sympathy. "Who is he who has
  thus misused your forbearance, and what is the nature of his errand
  here?"</p>

  <p>"Pun Kwan is his repulsive name--may the stomach of a Mongolian crow prove
  to be his tomb! From the Outer Land of Zam are we come with a varied commerce
  of the finer sort, so that, forestalling the less grasping of our band, he
  now seeks to make a traffic of six horns of ivory to the one within."</p>

  <p>"My ineffectual voice shall be raised on your behalf," said Kin, as he
  passed on. "Do not despair; the fiercest thunderstorm is composed of single
  drops." With this amiable pledge, however, he merely sought to end the
  conversation in a manner congenial to the other's feelings, for his own hopes
  did not extend beyond entering unperceived. In this (aided, doubtless, by the
  exercise of Che-ung's secret magic) he was successful; the upraised voices of
  two, each striving to outlast the other, revealed that the hazard of the
  bargain was still in progress in a farther room, and Kin reached his bench
  unchallenged. Then, as if a controlling influence had been lifted when this
  effect was gained, Pun Kwan and Chan Chun began slowly to approach, the
  former person endeavouring to create the illusion that he was hastening away,
  without in reality increasing his distance from the other, while the latter
  one was concerned in an attempt to present an attitude of unbending
  no-concern, while actuated by a fixed determination not to allow Pun Kwan to
  pass beyond recall. Thus they reached Kin's presence, where they paused, the
  sight of the outer door filling them both with apprehension.</p>

  <p>"It were better to have remained throughout eternity in the remote desert
  of Eta, leaving these six majestic tusks to form an imperishable monument
  above our bones, rather than suffer the corroding shame of agreeing to accept
  the obscene inadequacy of taels which you hold out," declared Pun Kwan with
  passionate sincerity. "Soften the rebellious wax within your ears, O
  obstinate Chan Chun! and listen to the insistent cries of those who call me
  hence with offers of a sack of rubies for six much matchless towers of
  ivory."</p>

  <p>"If," replied Chan Chun, with equal stubbornness, "I should indeed, in a
  moment of acute derangement, assent to your rapacious demand of a mountain of
  pure silver for each of these decaying fangs, the humiliated ghosts of an
  unbroken line of carving ancestors would descend to earth to paralyze their
  degenerate son's ignoble hand. Furthermore, the time for bargaining has
  passed, thou mercenary Pun Kwan! For pressing forward in the Ways behold a
  company of righteous merchants, each proferring a more attractive choice for
  less than half the price."</p>

  <p>Before Pun Kwan could make a suitable reply, there came from beyond the
  walls the sound of one who raised his voice at dusk. It was the evening chant
  of the cameleer, who, after the manner of his tribe, had begun to recite his
  innermost thoughts, in order to purify his mind before he slept. After
  listening to the various analogies in which his name was blended, Pun Kwan's
  expression gradually took upon itself a less austere cast.</p>

  <p>"It is not unaptly written, 'When the shield is bent the sword is also
  blunted,' and neither person can reproach the other with a lack of
  resolution," he remarked pacifically. "Added to this, we are but men of
  natural instincts and must shortly seek repose."</p>

  <p>"Say on," replied Chan Chun, as the other waited for his acquiescence.
  "Provided that a mutual tolerance is involved, this one will not oppose you
  with a brazen throat."</p>

  <p>"Let the price be thus and thus, so that my unattractive face shall suffer
  no compression, while your enlarged munificence will be extolled. Then, to
  the balance of my offer will I yet add another tusk, freely and devoid of
  charge. By this, each shall seem to have profited at the other's expense
  though neither is the loser."</p>

  <p>"Perchance," assented Chan Chun doubtfully. "But touching that same added
  tusk--?"</p>

  <p>"Admittedly the six cannot be matched, did one comb the forests of the
  land of Zam and pass all matter through a potter's sieve. Seen side by side
  with these, any other tusk deceives the eye and takes upon itself an
  unmerited imperfection. Is it not truly said that what is gold by
  night--?"</p>

  <p>"That which needs so much warming up may as well be eaten cold," observed
  Chan Chun in a flat-edged voice. "Behold the scales and an amplitude of
  silver bar. Let the promised tusk appear."</p>

  <p>Thus challenged, Pun Kwan withdrew and presently returned with an object
  which he bore and set before Chan Chun. For an elaborate moment, the ivory
  carver was too astonished even to become outwardly amused (a poise it had
  been his previous intention to assume) for the tusk was of an ill-shapen kind
  never before seen by him or any other of the craft. It was of stunted form,
  gnarly and unattractive to the eye, and riven by some mishap while yet in
  growth, so that it branched to half its length.</p>

  <p>"What infirmity contorts your worthy sight and deflects your natural
  vision from its normal line, O scrupulous Pun Kwan?" said Chan Chun
  indulgently. "This is not a tusk of ivory at all, but doubtless the horn of
  some unseemly buffalo, or of one of the fabled monsters of the barbarian
  Outer-World. This should be offered to those who fashion drinking cups from
  commonplace bone, who dwell about the Leafy Path, beyond the Water Gate."</p>

  <p>"Peace, brother," said Pun Kwan approvingly. "To revile my wares is in the
  legitimate way of fruitful bargaining, but to treat them as a jest assails
  the inner fibre of one's self-esteem. Is there not justice in the adage, 'Eat
  in the dark the bargain that you purchased in the dusk?' The tusk is as it
  is."</p>

  <p>Alas, it is truly said, "If two agree not to strive about the price,
  before the parcel is made up they will fall out upon the colour of the
  string," and assuredly Pun Kwan and Chan Chun would very soon have been
  involved as keenly as before had it not been for an unexpected happening.
  Ever concerned about the smallest details of his art, Kin had drawn near to
  mark the progress of the conflict and to lend a stalwart voice to his
  master's cause if Chan Chun's own throat should fail him. Judge, then, the
  measure of his wonder when in the seventh tusk he at once recognized the
  essential outline of the fair white bird as it hung poised above the path
  before him! Misshapen as the ivory seemed for the general purpose of the
  carver's art, it was as though it had been roughly cast for this one service,
  and Kin could no longer doubt the versatile grasp of Che-ung's fostering
  hand.</p>

  <p>"A word in your farseeing ear, instructor," he said, drawing Chan Chun
  aside. "If the six are worthy of your inspired use, do not maintain an upper
  lip rigid beyond release. This person has long sought to acquire a block
  sufficiently ill-formed to conceal his presumptuous lack of skill. This now
  offers, and in return for a tusk of admittedly uncouth proportions he will
  bind himself to serve your commanding voice for four hand-counts of further
  moons and ask no settled wage."</p>

  <p>"It suffices," replied Chan Chun readily, seeing a clear advantage to
  himself. "Yet," he continued, with a breath of slow-witted doubt, "wherein,
  at so formidable an obligation, can this profit you whose reputation does not
  reach any higher than the knee of a sitting duck?"</p>

  <p>"The loftiest mountain rises gradually at first," replied Kin evasively.
  Then, on the excuse that the auspices of Chan Chun's purchase required the
  propitiatory discharge of a string of crackers, he withdrew, to venerate his
  ancestors anew.</p>

  <p>As the days went on, it grew increasingly plain to Kin that he was indeed
  under the care of very potent Forces while the likelihood of Che-ung's
  benevolent interference from time to time could not be ignored. Despite the
  unworthy nature of the scanty tools he used and the meagre insufficiency of
  light remaining when Chan Chun's inexorable commands had been obeyed, the
  formless block of ivory gradually took upon itself the shining presentiment
  of a living bird. When any doubt assailed Kin's mind as to the correct
  portrayal of a detail, an unseen power would respectfully but firmly direct
  his hand, and on one occasion when, with somewhat narrow-minded obstinacy, he
  had sought to assert himself by making in inaccurate stroke too suddenly to
  be restrained, the detached fragment was imperceptibly restored while he
  slept.</p>

  <p>It was at this period of its history that Tai-chow reached the cloudy
  eminence which marked the pinnacle of attainment among the illustrious arts.
  The provincial governor, an official of such exalted rank that it entitled
  him to wear a hat with a yellow feather even when asleep, returned after a
  long absence to gladden the city with his presence. To indicate the general
  satisfaction and at the same time allow the prevailing excess of joy to
  evaporate in a natural and, if it might be, painless manner, mutual feasts
  were given at which those most proficient in the sonorous use of words were
  encouraged to express themselves at various lengths upon whatever subject
  most concerned their minds. When by these humane means the city had been
  reduced to a normal state of lethargy, the Mandarin Tseng Hung (the one
  referred to) testified his enduring interest in the welfare of the company of
  craftsmen by a proclamation and a printed sheet displayed on every wall.</p>

  <p>"He is a peacock among partridges, the one who rules our laws, and will
  doubtless become the founder of a promiscuous line of kings," exclaimed Chan
  Chun vaingloriously, on his return from the marketplace, where he had
  listened to the reading of the edict. "Has any rumour of the honour now
  foreshadowed to the tree of Chan already reached my usually deficient
  home?"</p>

  <p>"None save a resolute collector of the bygone water dues has crossed your
  polished step," replied the chief one of his inner room. "Is then your fame
  proclaimed again, thrice fortunate Chan Chun?"</p>

  <p>"Not in so many explicit words," admitted the unbecoming Chun, "but the
  intention cannot be obscured. Thus is the matter set forth at ample length:
  On a certain agreed day, any craftsman who dwells about Tai-chow, or even
  within the shadow of its outer wall, be he worker in the finer of the cruder
  sorts of merchandise, may send the most engaging product of his hand to the
  Palace of the Lustres, to be there beheld of all. Chief among these will come
  the enlightened Mandarin Tseng Hung himself, wearing his fullest robe of
  ceremonial state. After glancing perfunctorily at the less attractive objects
  ranged about the Hall he will stop with an expression of gratified admiration
  before the one bearing the sign of Chan Chun and the seal of the Reverential
  Company of Carvers in the Hard. Then, to an accompaniment of laudatory
  trumpets, he will announce this to be worthy of the chief reward--and
  doubtless soon after that retire, leaving the disposal of inferior honours to
  integritous but needy Younger Brethren of his suite."</p>

  <p>"Haply," remarked a shrewd maiden who was present, one who did not
  venerate Chan Chun, "yet the Wisdom has declared: 'It is easier to amass a
  fortune in a dream than to secure ten cash by the light of day.' By what
  inducement do you hope to sway the strict Tseng Hung, thou Conscientious
  Elephant?"</p>

  <p>"The necessity does not arise," coldly replied Chan Chun. "The craft of
  carving ivory being the most esteemed of all, and this superlative person the
  acclaimed leader of that band, it inevitably results that whatever he puts
  forth must be judged to transcend the rest. To decide otherwise would be to
  challenge the Essential Principles of stability and order."</p>

  <p>In an obscure corner of the room, Kin bent his energies upon a menial
  task.</p>

  <p>"You have spoken without limit of those who may compete, esteemed," he
  said diffidently. "Is it then permitted even to the unassuming and ill-clad
  to incur this presumption?"</p>

  <p>"Save only malefactors, slaves, barbers, official guardians of the
  streets, and play-actors-- who by an all-wise justice are debarred from
  holding any form of honour--even the outcast leper in the Way may urge his
  claim." Chan Chun restrained his voice to an unusual mildness, in order
  thereby to reprove the maiden who had challenged his pretension. "If," he
  continued benevolently, "it is your not unworthy purpose to strive for some
  slight distinction within the bounds set apart for the youthful and inept,
  any discarded trifle from my own misguided hand is freely at your call."</p>

  <p>"The compass points the way, but one's own laborious feet must make the
  journey," replied Kin tactfully. Then, to deflect the edge of his evasion and
  to recall Chan Chun's mind to a brighter image, he adroitly added: "What is
  the nature of the chief reward, so that we may prepare a worthy place,
  revered?"</p>

  <p>"That," replied Chan Chun, "is as the one who achieves it may himself
  decide. The large-hearted Mandarin binds himself by his father's sacred
  pigtail that on this unique occasion whatsoever shall be asked will be freely
  given."</p>

  <p>"That may aptly be related to the Ever-Victorious!" exclaimed the
  contumacious maiden with the conciseness of contempt. "Think you, O credulous
  bone-chipper, that if the one thus singled out should demand the life, the
  wealth, or even the favoured wife of the Mandarin himself--"</p>

  <p>"To do anything so outrageous would clearly proclaim a subverter of
  authority, and thereby a traitor to the State. A traitor is essentially a
  malefactor, and as all criminals are definitely excluded from competing it
  automatically follows that the triumph of this particular one is necessarily
  null and void and another--more prudent--must be chosen in his stead. Thus
  justice moves ever in a virtuous cycle, and the eternal proprieties are
  fittingly upheld. For myself," added the not undiscriminating Chan Chun
  reflectively, "I shall gladden the face of this remunerative patron by the
  suggestion of a striking but more or less honorary distinction."</p>

  <p>"To surmount above our sign the likeness of an official umbrella would
  cast a gratifying shadow of authority upon the Conscientious Elephant,"
  remarked the keeper of his hearth.</p>

  <p>"Accompanied by the legend: 'Under the magnanimous thumb of the auspicious
  Tseng Hung,' " amplified Chan Chun. "The hint is by no means concave."</p>

  <p>As the day of the great event drew near, the air above Tai-chow grew dark
  with the multitude of rumours that went up on every side. While many of these
  were of a gratuitous and inoffensive nature, it cannot be denied that others
  were deliberately cast abroad by thrifty persons whose business it was to
  make a profit from the fluctuating hopes and fears of those who staked upon
  the chances of competing craftsmen. Few were so lacking in respect toward the
  Omens as not to venture a string of cash in favour of the one who appeared
  before them in a lucky dream. Even the blind, the deaf and the dumb, and the
  mentally deficient, lying about the city gates, forecast portents at their
  leisure in the dust and esteemed from the passerby a predictive word
  whispered behind a screening hand more than they did the bestowal of a coin
  in silence.</p>

  <p>In the meanwhile, Chan Chun and Kin laboured at their respective tasks
  secretly and alone--Kin because the only leisure he obtained was in his own
  penurious room, the former person owing to his cold and suspicious nature.
  The task upon which he engaged was one wherein ingenuity combined with art to
  a very high degree. Selecting his purest and most massive block of ivory, he
  skillfully fashioned it into a measured counterpart of the great Palace of
  the Lustres as it stood. Then, to continue the similitude, within this outer
  shell he carved the core into a smaller likeness of the same, perfect in
  every detail, and thus and thus, down to the seventeenth image--a pygmy
  Palace no larger than the capacity of a cherry stone but equipped to the
  slenderest point. Yet despite the complex nature of the task, none of the
  sixteen smaller Palaces could be removed away from its encircling walls, all
  the cutting being achieved by Chan Chun through succeeding openings as he
  worked inward. When this truly elaborate piece should be placed within the
  walls of the Palace itself, the analogy would be complete, and the craftsman
  did not doubt that a universal shout of accord would greet his triumph.</p>

  <p>On the eve of the day of trial, Chan Chun crept out secretly at dusk and
  distrusting all hired assistance carried his work by unfrequented ways to the
  Palace of the Lustres and there deposited it. As he reached his own door
  again he encountered Kin, who would have avoided him, but Chan Chun was
  feeling very pleasantly arranged within himself at the thought of his success
  and would not be disclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Within the four walls of the arts, all men are brothers," he speciously
  declared. "Remove the cloth that covers your achievement, worthy Kin, and
  permit my failing eyes to be rewarded by a blaze of glory."</p>

  <p>"Even a sightless bat would recognize its grotesque imperfections,"
  deferentially replied Kin, and he disclosed what he had done.</p>

  <p>For a measured beat of time, Chan Chun continued to observe the ivory bird
  with outstretched wings that Kin had fashioned, and although the expression
  of his face slowly changed from one extreme to another he was incapable of
  speech, until the youth, deeming the matter sufficiently displayed, passed
  along and into the outer way. Then the master sought a solitary chamber, and
  having barred the door he sank upon a couch as he exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"Assuredly it breathes! I have carved with a chisel but Kin Weng has
  endowed with life itself."</p>

  <p>That same night, at the middle hour of the darkness, the keeper of the
  door of the Palace of the Lustres was roused from his sleep by a discreet but
  well-sustained knocking on the outer wall. For some time he did not attach
  any importance to the incident, but presently the unmistakable sound of a
  piece of silver being tested against another caused him to regard the matter
  as one which he should in duty probe. On the threshold he found Chan Chun,
  who greeted him with marked consideration.</p>

  <p>"You alone stand between me and humiliation on the morrow," said the
  craftsman with engaging freedom. "When the painstaking Mandarin who is to
  judge our efforts selects as the worthiest that which I have brought, how
  will his inspired decision be announced?"</p>

  <p>"Should your hopes be fruitful, a full-throated herald of the court will
  cry aloud your name, the sign beneath which you dwell, and the nature of your
  handicraft. On hearing these, a chosen band outside will repeat the details
  to the four corners of the earth, to symbolize the far-extending limit of
  your fame, their voices being assisted when necessary by a company of lusty
  horners. . . . And thereupon this necessitous person will seek out one with
  whom he has wagered on the strength of your renown and claim from him an
  indicated stake. May your valiant cause succeed!"</p>

  <p>"Doubtless it may in its essence, yet none of these things you speak of
  will ensue--particularly the last," replied Chan Chun. "By an incredible
  perversity, the written tablet of my name and the like required details has
  been omitted, so that when the choice is reached no announcement can be made.
  The vanquished, not slow to use this sordid weapon put within their reach,
  will claim the forfeit of my chance, urging that by this oversight I have not
  fulfilled the declared terms, nor can those who hold the balance resist the
  formal challenge. Not to further this act of iniquity, permit me to pass
  inside, gracious Pang, so that I may complete what is now lacking."</p>

  <p>"This is a somewhat knotty tangle, chieftain," said the keeper of the door
  uncertainly, "and one not over clear as to which end leads to wisdom. Thus it
  was laid upon me as a solemn charge, that at the sounding of the eighth gong
  all further traffic in this matter ceased--that which is within remaining so
  and all beyond excluded from the Hall. Should it come to the ears of high
  ones that in this I have failed incapably--"</p>

  <p>"It is foreseen," interposed Chan Chun; "nor is your complicity involved.
  As I awaited you, a piece of silver slipped down from my grasp and rolled
  some way apart. Should you seek this, your eyes will be upon the ground, and
  nothing else will come within their sight, while being at a little distance
  from the open door you will have no knowledge that anyone goes in or out.
  Thus, with well-chosen words, you can safely take the most convincing oath,
  nor will your phantom's future state be thereby held to bondage."</p>

  <p>"That which has an inlet has an outlet also," assented Pang, now fully
  reassured, "and your mind is stored with profitable wisdom. Yet," he added
  thoughtfully, "it is no less truly said, 'As the glove smells, so the hand.'
  Is the piece of silver which is the basis of this person's attitude lawful in
  weight and of the stipulated purity?"</p>

  <p>"If anything, it exceeds in both respects," affirmed Chan Chun. "Preserve
  a virtuous front in all contingencies and none can implicate you."</p>

  <p>It has already been discreetly indicated that, in a moment of emergency,
  Chan Chun's character might undergo a downward bend. So far he had been able
  to withstand all the ordinary allurements placed about his path by evil
  Forces, none of these being on a sufficiently large scale to make the hazard
  profitable. But in Kin's great achievement he plainly recognized the
  extinction of his own pre-eminence among the craftsmen of Tai-chow, for none
  could miss its matchless qualities nor fail to accord to it an excellence
  above his own. To this contemplation was added the acuter barb that the one
  who should supplant him thus publicly was the disregarded underling who
  served his bench. In this extremity Chan Chun sent forth a message of despair
  to any passing demon who would succour him and even yet assure his triumph.
  To his weak and superficial mind, the solution at once offered by one seemed
  both adequate and just, and he accordingly proceeded to that end. Having
  gained admission to the unguarded Hall by the stratagem set forth, he
  treacherously removed the tablet of Kin's name from off its owner's work and
  placed it on his own, and in like manner transferred his own name and
  description to the creation of his servant's hand, well knowing that Kin had
  none to support his claim, and that, if dissent arose, the word of an obscure
  hireling would not emerge above Chan Chun's outstanding voice. Then, after
  again exhorting Pang to maintain an unswerving denial in the face of any
  question, he returned to his own abode, quite satisfied that, in a very
  difficult manner, he had acted up to the requirements.</p>

  <p>On the following day, Chan Chun would have denied to Kin any respite from
  his task, the better to effect his crafty scheme, but as soon as it was
  light, a herald passed along the Ways announcing in the Mandarin's name that
  to mark so special an occasion no one should engage in any work that day, but
  should, instead, receive a double wage, and so great was the respect now paid
  to Tseng Hung's slightest wish that, among all those who laboured in or about
  Tai-chow, there was not one who did not instantly comply.</p>

  <p>At the appointed hour every person in the city and the boundaries round
  who was capable of movement was clustered about the Palace of the Lustres,
  Chan Chun and Kin among them. The former of the two had purchased a position
  upon an erected structure draped with red, which enabled him to maintain an
  attitude of ease and arrogance toward those who stood below, while Kin had
  been content to arrange himself among the feet of the foremost line. When the
  Mandarin Tseng Hung appeared, surrounded by his guard, so loud and continuous
  was the thunder of his welcome that several flashes of lightning are credibly
  asserted to have followed, owing to an excess of zeal on the part of the
  conscientious but inexperienced Being who had charge of it. Yet it is to be
  doubted if Kin heard a sound or saw any of the moving crowd, for at a single
  glance he plainly recognized in Tseng Hung the agreeable philosopher who had
  assured him of protection when they encountered in the wood.</p>

  <p>In order to avoid the possibly profanity of the Mandarin being actually
  touched by a person of no distinction the Hall of the competition had not
  been opened since the preceding night, nor were any allowed to pass within
  when Tseng Hung entered it, save only his chosen band. To those among the
  throng outside who were competing craftsmen the moments were as leisurely as
  the shadow of a branchless pine tree moving across a level sward.</p>

  <p>At length one in authority came forth, and at the sight of him, expecting
  this to be the herald who should proclaim the victor, speech and movement
  died away, so that the only sounds heard throughout the vast multitude were
  the indignant cries of those who enjoined silence on each other.</p>

  <p>"Let two approach and with downcast eyes prepare to be received into the
  very presence of the august Tseng Hung himself," announced the messenger, in
  an all-powerful voice. "These be Chan Chun, who carves ivory beneath the sign
  of a golden elephant, and Kin, the attendant of his hand. Hear and obey."</p>

  <p>"Your wholly abject servant hastens to comply," cried Chan Chun, almost
  casting himself bodily from the height of the barrier in a passion of
  servility, and still more in a praiseworthy determination to be there before
  the inopportune Kin should gain the Mandarin's ear. Kin, however, was no less
  speedy, although the obstruction of his passage was equally involved, so
  that, as a result, they reached Tseng Hung and prostrated themselves, each
  with his face pressed submissively into the dust, side by side."</p>

  <p>"Rise, unassuming ones," said the Mandarin, with a consideration almost
  unparalleled in an official of his illustrious button. "Your attitude, though
  complimentary in itself and eminently suited to a merely formal greeting, is
  frankly embarrassing to all in the light of well-extended conversation."</p>

  <p>"Your gracious words sink through the back of my threadbare head and
  reached even this ill-nurtured brain, so clear-cut is the penetration of
  their brilliance," replied Chan Chun, scarcely daring to obey so indulgent a
  command.</p>

  <p>"Doubtless," assented the Mandarin, with high-born tact, "But owing to the
  necessary inversion of our respective postures yours unfortunately do not
  possess a reciprocal capacity. Furthermore," he continued, in a voice from
  which the sympathetic modulation began imperceptibly to fade, "in order to
  avoid a very regrettable strain upon your neck, it will be necessary for you
  to use your eyes adroitly. Raise yourself to a position in keeping with your
  wide repute, upright Chan, and state deliberately wherein lies the pith of
  associating your ornate name with a merely shapeless block."</p>

  <p>The matter having thus become too intricately arranged to be parried by
  evasive flattery, Chan Chun raised so much of himself as was permissible and
  looked toward the indicated point, but at the benumbing sight he dropped back
  into his original abandonment, partly because his two-faced joints betrayed
  his flaccid limbs, but also to gain a precious moment in which to rearrange
  his mind. What he had seen was the foundation of Kin's work indeed, still
  bearing the tablet of his own name and sign, as he had unostentatiously
  contrived, but the bird itself was no longer there. So lifelike had been
  Kin's inspired touch that the sound of one of its own kind calling from
  outside had enticed the creature into flight.</p>

  <p>"In order to give your inventive mind an unfettered range we will pass for
  the moment from the question of punishing contumely to that of rewarding
  merit," continued the justice-loving Tseng Hung impartially. "This ingenious
  but by no means heroic device of concentric palaces, bearing the name and
  symbol of Kin Weng, the underling of the momentarily indisposed Chan Chun,
  must be selected to receive our highest commendation. Let the herald
  therefore proclaim--"</p>

  <p>"Imperishable!" exclaimed Chan Chun, unable any longer to retain between
  his teeth the bitterness of seeing his achievement surrendered to another,
  "before the decisive word is spoken, hear the ungilded truth of my misshapen
  lips. In the darkness of the night, having discovered an essential detail to
  be lacking from my task, I sought to remedy this. Deluded by the misguiding
  beams of the great sky lantern, my inept hand must have stumbled in the
  direction of its quest, and thus the tablet that I would have placed about my
  work found a resting place upon the immature effort of this inoffensive
  youth."</p>

  <p>"His in like manner?" inquired the painstaking Mandarin.</p>

  <p>"Possibly unseen Influences have therein been at work," Chan Chun ventured
  to suggest. "Or, perchance, one of those concerned about the Hall, seeing a
  deficiency, removed a tablet from the space where two appeared, and thus and
  thus--"</p>

  <p>"What fits the right foot does not necessarily fit the left," remarked the
  judicial-minded administrator, keeping a firm grasp upon the intricacies of
  the case. "Is there present anyone who can bear witness to your cause, Chan
  Chun?"</p>

  <p>"Pang, who guards the outer door of the Palace, will uphold what I have
  said," replied Chan Chun, endeavouring to convey by a veiled glance toward
  the one in question a knowledge of the changed necessity pursuing him. "He it
  was who, measuring the extremity of my need with a forbearing rod, admitted
  me by night."</p>

  <p>"High excellence," declared the inauspicious Pang, thrusting himself
  forward from among those who were stationed round, "may my lot through all
  futurity be a rigid arm and an itching sore if my discovering eye beheld the
  sight or if this forbidding hand was raised to suffer any man to pass," and
  the slow-witted person who had spoken closed one eye in the direction of Chan
  Chun in order to reassure him that he would, despite all enticement to the
  contrary, tenaciously follow his instruction.</p>

  <p>"We have heard it said, 'One may ride upon a tiger's back but it is fatal
  to dismount,' and you, Chan Chun, are experiencing the wisdom of the verse,"
  declared Tseng Hung. "Pang having bent within your hand, it behoves your
  expectant eyes to seek another prop. Is there, by chance, none who has seen
  you busied at your task?"</p>

  <p>"Alas, omnipotence, I wrought in secret lest another should forestall my
  plan."</p>

  <p>"Can you then implicate Kin Weng with this emblem of contempt and save
  your own repute by calling to your aid those who have marked it beneath his
  fashioning hand?"</p>

  <p>"I also strove unnoticed at my toil, benevolence, nor has any ever deigned
  to tarry as he passed my despised bench by," interposed Kin, not thinking it
  necessary to declare himself more fully until it became apparent on which
  side justice lay.</p>

  <p>"He whose sandals are in holes is seldom asked to ride," quoted Chan Chun,
  plainly recognizing that disgrace would attract few toward his need. "Having
  reached the end of my evasion, mightiness, I bend an acquiescent neck."</p>

  <p>"In that case your suspense should not be long," was the humane assurance,
  but before Chan Chun could frame a submissive line a disturbing tumult
  reached their ears.</p>

  <p>"Great Head," cried a captain of the guard which stood outside, entering
  with an absence of all seemly form, "there is an omen in the sky to justify
  my uncouth haste. A strange white bird has three times circled round the
  tower above and now remains suspended in an unnatural poise, high in the
  middle air."</p>

  <p>"All this is according to a definite line of augury and moves toward an
  end," remarked the Mandarin, leaving his ceremonial chair and indicating that
  those concerned should follow him. "If this celestial creature can be brought
  to earth and is found to fit a place upon the sculptured block, Chan Chun's
  contention need not be gainsaid, while distinction of a very special kind
  will appertain to Kin. Let the most skillful with his bow stand forth."</p>

  <p>"Wang, of the Crouching Leopard Band, display the opening attitude!"
  commanded an under-captain of the guard.</p>

  <p>"A weighty bar of silver for thy needy sleeve if the first shaft shall
  reach its destined mark," promised Chan Chun in a beseeching voice.</p>

  <p>"Begin to prepare to affix a trusty arrow to thy bow in accordance with
  the prescribed requirements of the distance to be attained," continued the
  one who led the movements. "Extending a propitious hand in the direction of
  the upper--"</p>

  <p>"All-powerful chief!" exclaimed Kin suddenly, casting himself before the
  Mandarin's feet. "Suffer the inoffensive bird to live in safety, and the
  penalty that Chan Chun has merited I will myself incur."</p>

  <p>"Rise, estimable Kin," replied Tseng Hung, raising a jewelled hand with a
  gesture indicating that if his position had been slightly less exalted he
  might even have extended it; "your orthodox way of behaving in this
  emergency, together with the low-class efforts of the usurpatory Chan Chun,
  make any display of judicial alertness on this one's part superfluous. Your
  humane wish is granted."</p>

  <p>"In any case," remarked the morose Wang, as one who forebodes oppression,
  "the discriminating bird has by this time passed out of the range of a merely
  human skill. Yet as a certain sum was specified--"</p>

  <p>"Revert to your original attitude of unalertness!" interposed the
  under-captain definitely.</p>

  <p>"There is still another page to be unrolled if the Destinies are to be
  fulfilled as the Omens would direct," declared Tseng Hung expectantly. "Turn
  your capable eyes toward the west, Kin Weng, and search the path that gives
  access to our weed-grown park."</p>

  <p>"None approaches from your well-kept grounds, esteemed," replied Kin,
  after a penetrating scrutiny.</p>

  <p>Tseng Hung leaned upon his staff and his lips moved, but so discreetly
  that none save Kin (who saw in this an added likeness to the one called
  Che-ung) detected the enchantment.</p>

  <p>"A vision of the inner chamber lifts your latch and makes as though an
  unseen power directs her steps this way," reported Kin.</p>

  <p>"Is she known to your remembrance?" asked the other, with a warning
  glance.</p>

  <p>"He who dreams by night may also dream by day, but who shall recall the
  colours of a rainbow that is past?" was the guarded answer.</p>

  <p>Tseng Hung signified his approval of this speech and moved his staff
  again.</p>

  <p>"Should any further auspice seem worthy of remark, do not hesitate to free
  your mind," he said protectingly.</p>

  <p>"She holds a white bird in her arms, which nestles there; but to presume a
  mutual bond from that would not be opportune," replied Kin with ingrained
  diffidence.</p>

  <p>"Do not hesitate; remember that it is better to be the forefront of a
  rabbit than the hind quarters of an ox; and should the portents be
  maintained, your pre But the moment for the final test is now at hand.</p>

  <p>eminence is well assured. Come." With this condescending familiarity of
  speech, the unworldly Mandarin led Kin aside and brought him back into the
  Hall where they had lately been. Here, without actually concealing
  themselves, they stooped behind an upright beam of sufficient size, and thus
  screened they watched the maiden enter. Straight to the spot where Kin's work
  had stood she bent her feet, then stopped, and there from her releasing hands
  the bird flew lightly down and, taking up again its exact place upon the
  sculptured block, passed at once into its former state of lifelike poise.</p>

  <p>"Fa Ming, daughter of my all-but-extinct Line, what aim has brought you to
  this spot?" mildly inquired Tseng Hung, discovering himself to her.</p>

  <p>"That is a matter which lies beyond my feeble lore, revered," was the
  suitable reply. "As I sat in my leafy bower, sewing pearls upon a golden
  ground, a white bird entered by an open lattice and flew into my heart,
  filling its empty void. Then with a message that I may not speak, it drew me
  on and on until, about this place, its purpose being fulfilled, it passed
  into another state, leaving me tranquil."</p>

  <p>"This is the end to which I have striven through many gloomy years, and it
  was with this in view that I finally applied myself, with varying results, to
  the questionable arts," remarked the gratified father, beckoning Kin Weng
  forward and addressing himself chiefly to that one's ear. "At an early age
  the last enduring offspring of my decrepit trunk came under the perfidious
  influence of the spirit of an uprooted banyan tree, who, to revenge itself
  for an imaginary slight in the choosing of her name, deprived her of the
  gentle and confiding habit which up to that time she had invariably displayed
  and in its stead imposed its own unbalanced and vainglorious nature. To
  neutralize this powerful influence was by no means so simple as an ordinary
  person might at first imagine, as it necessitated gaining a profound
  knowledge into the customs and circumstances of every kind of Being, Force,
  Spirit, Demon, Vampire, Shadow, Ghost, and other supernatural creature
  inhabiting earth, air, water, fire, and wood. The possible intervention of
  dragons, phoenixes, tortoises, and unicorns, both ill and well disposed, had
  also to be delicately balanced, and the contending influences of tides,
  planets, winds, inundations, eclipses, and dynastic changes accurately
  divined. In addition to these, no single omen, portent, augury, prediction,
  conjecture, foreboding, dream, or imprecation could safely be ignored. In the
  end, the movements of practically every living person in Tai-chow and its
  surroundings were more or less drawn into the scheme, so involved had the
  counter-charm become, while the discovery that only one short measure of time
  during the next ten thousand years was really auspicious for the test
  necessitated an immediate effort."</p>

  <p>"Your labours have been both wide and profound, esteemed," remarked Kin
  deferentially. "Yet," he added, with an admiring glance in the direction of
  Fa Ming, "were they multiplied by ten their troubles are repaid a
  hundredfold."</p>

  <p>"It will be gratifying if all concerned, Chan Chun specifically, prove as
  outspoken in their loyalty," replied Tseng Hung.</p>

  <p>"Omniscience," reported a privileged slave, entering hurriedly, "the
  populace has begun to assail the keepers of the routes with missiles of the
  riper sort, and the official few, fearing a popular rising, await your
  gracious word to announce that the promised entertainment is not yet
  commenced or has already reached its determined end."</p>

  <p>"Let all be freely admitted whatever their degree, and bid the several
  troupes of music-players to engage at once in harmony to the full extent of
  their capacity," commanded the Mandarin resourcefully. "We ourselves will
  display our interest in the animated scene from the seclusion of this
  conveniently arranged cupola."</p>

  <p>Yet, despite the attraction of his urbane presence, Kin Weng and Fa Ming
  neglected to accompany him, and when the Hall became thronged with persons of
  the usual kind, it was noticed by the more observant that the two referred to
  stood side by side apart, and that, although without having anything in the
  nature of spoken language to exchange, they did not appear to realize a
  deficiency.</p>

  <p>When Kai Lung had related the story of Kin Weng, there was no longer any
  reason for his presence, nor, with sincere courtesy, did the hospitable band
  around make an actual effort to detain him. For a moment he had the
  low-minded impulse to pass round his penurious bowl, but seeing that those
  about had become inextricably absorbed in conversing with each other, he
  judged that the movement would be deemed inept.</p>

  <p>Outside the door, Hwa-mei was waiting, an inconspicuous bundle at her feet
  and a trimmed lantern placed beside it.</p>

  <p>"The oppressive closeness of the day has gone, and presently the great sky
  light will rise to guide our footsteps," she remarked agreeably, after they
  had exchanged words of an appropriate nature. "Is there any reason why we
  should not at length return to the scene of our disturbed felicity?"</p>

  <p>"It had been somewhat to my purpose that the trivial Li-loe might journey
  by our side, he having in a measure contributed to our cause," was the
  rejoinder. "But the witling was ever of a stunted warp, and now he steadily
  declines to forsake the valley. He is even now there, digging--doubtless for
  the cask of wine, of which he cannot recognize the no-existence."</p>

  <p>"Doubtless," assented Hwa-mei abstractedly, and they set forth together,
  she still maintaining a grasp upon the slight burden she had brought while
  sustained the lantern. The lights of Chi-U grew fewer, less, and vanished,
  and soon even the melodious clamour of hollow wooden drums, resonant stones,
  bells, gongs, and cymbals that marked Hai Shin's exultant homeward progress
  sank to a faint tremor on the unruffled air . . . then, when sought for
  again, had faded.</p>

  <p>"Though it was but a small cottage it was seemly," remarked Kai Lung, with
  the first trace of sadness. "Alas, this time, cherished, there is nothing but
  a ruin."</p>

  <p>"He who can command four hands shall never lack a shelter," replied
  Hwa-mei, undaunted; "and that which is built on mutual affection has a very
  sure foundation. Furthermore, if the roof is low it will be the nearer to our
  thoughts. Is it not, O storyteller, written, 'When the wine is rich we
  overlook the gilding in the cup?' "</p>

  <p>"Yet the peach tree at the gate has been destroyed, the sown field wasted,
  and the scanty store put by against the day of drought has melted."</p>

  <p>"As to that," said Hwa-mei, with a certain gaiety in her manner, "an
  adequacy of, as it may be expressed, seed, has by the forethought of the
  Sustaining Ones been provided for the renewal of our harvest." Thus speaking
  she untied the knots that bound the cords and then disclosed her burden. It
  consisted chiefly of a nest of pearls, but there were also eleven other
  varieties of precious stones and a reasonable amount of both gold and silver.
  "Ming-shu and Shan Tien would each seem to have provided for the morrow, and
  since neither of them will have occasion to pass that way again, it would
  have been inopportune not to search beneath the ground whereon their tents
  had stood."</p>

  <p>"As you must clearly have been led by the guiding spirits of your--no less
  than my own--ever-to-be-reverenced ancestors, it would, perhaps, be impious
  not to accept their gift in the way it was intended, and to make use of the
  various possessions here, in a good sense, gradually," declared Kai Lung,
  after he had tested a chance selection of the gems and metals. "Inexorable is
  the saying, 'However much the river winds it finds the sea at last.'"</p>

  <h2><a id="pt2"
     name="pt2"></a>PART II. -- THE GREAT SKY LANTERN</h2>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X.<br>
  How Kai Lung Sought to Discourage One<br>
  Who Did Not Gain His Approbation</h2>

  <p class="first">To Kai Lung, reclining at ease within the lengthening shadow
  of his own mulberry tree, there came the sound of contest, as of one strong
  in his assurance, and the melodious laughter of another who derided what he
  claimed. Recognizing therein the voices of Chi Lin, the son of a rich
  neighbour, and Precious Jade, the matchless blossom of his own matured years,
  the discriminating relater of imagined tales slowly closed the scroll upon
  which he had been absorbed and imperceptibly composed himself into an
  attitude of wary unconcern--not with the ignoble purpose of listening to
  their words, but so that he might haply correct any inelegance of style in
  such stray phrases as should reach his ear.</p>

  <p>"Thus and thus, perchance, it has been in the past," came the boast of the
  vainglorious youth, "but this person will yet pluck a whisker from the tree
  of Fame, and even hang the silver buckle of his shoe upon the crescent of the
  great sky light itself."</p>

  <p>"Thus and thus indeed!" mocked the answering voice, and a laugh, musical
  as a stream of pearls falling into a crystal lake, stirred the perfumed air.
  "Beware of arousing the envy of the sleeping shades of Yao-u and Shun, O
  thrice-valiant one!"</p>

  <p>At the mention of these unapproachable heroes of the past, Chi Lin plainly
  realized the unseemly loudness of his challenge, for he moved yet closer to
  the maiden's side and began to express himself very ardently into her
  well-placed ear. Kai Lung, therefore, had no alternative but to leave the
  shelter of his arbour and to display himself openly before them.</p>

  <p>"Noble youth," he remarked with becoming mildness, "consider, if but for a
  breathing-space of time, the harmonious balance of the unisons. Trees put
  forth leaves, flowers, and fruit, each in due season; men--those who attain
  the honourable appendages of virtuous old age--wear whiskers or moustaches
  and the like. The analogy was ill-contrived."</p>

  <p>"Venerated master," replied the self-confident one whom he had thus
  arraigned, "in the unsophisticated days of your distinguished minstrelsy, it
  was doubtless well enough to speak of things as they really were. In our own
  more exacting times, however, in order to entice the approbation of the
  throng it is necessary to cultivate a studied obliquity of style. To pluck
  the natural verdure of a tree foreshadows no romance, but what imagination is
  not stirred by the bold conception of a doubtless retaliatory arboreal
  whisker being torn from its parent stock?"</p>

  <p>"Alas," admitted Kai Lung sadly, "it is well written, 'The shell must
  crumble when the young emerge,' and this obsolete person's literary manner is
  both thin and very fragile."</p>

  <p>"Yet," protested Precious Jade, rearranging his pigtail affectionately,
  "it has been freely said that no arising emergency has ever found you
  unprovided with an appropriate theme."</p>

  <p>"Who stoops to gather fallen leaves when the full fruit bends to meet his
  hand?" replied the one concerned. "Since your curiosity clearly tends that
  way, however, doubtless this opportune and intellectually replete young man
  will relate by what means the great sky lantern came to have that crescent
  point toward which the latter part of his painstaking ambition is
  directed."</p>

  <p>"The requirement finds me unprepared," stammered Chi Lin, by no means
  grasping how the exigency had arisen. "It is one thing to speak in terms of
  classical allusion, as of a 'peach'; it is quite another to have to declare
  who grafted the stem that bore the analogous fruit and where he performed his
  Rites. The words were but in the nature of an imagined feat."</p>

  <p>Kai Lung shook his head as one not wholly satisfied.</p>

  <p>"Before setting out for a distant and barbarian land, it is prudent to
  learn all that is available of the difficulties to be encountered by the
  way," he stubbornly contested. "Turn, accordingly, your highly connected
  footsteps in the direction of my very incommodious summer-house, O Chi Lin,
  and then, after this deformed and altogether unattractive she-thing of my
  decaying Line has brought fruit and wine wherewith to sustain you through the
  ordeal, I will endeavour to remove your lamentable want of historical polish
  as agreeably as possible."</p>

  <p>Chi Lin would have refrained, it having been his intention to pass the
  time pleasurably in Precious Jade's society without any reference to Kai Lung
  himself, but this no longer seemed feasible, and he began to recognize that
  he had conducted the enterprise in a manner unworthy of his all-embracing
  reputation. Nor did the engaging maiden return with the promised viands, her
  place being taken by a one-eyed hag of forbidding outline, but the
  self-opinionated storyteller behaved with all the narrow-minded obstinacy of
  his unsympathetic tribe, for ignoring his reluctant guest's well-displayed
  air of no-enthusiasm, he seated himself upon the floor and proceeded
  leisurely to unfold the story of the alluring Chou.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>The Story of the Philosopher Kuo Tsun<br>
  and of His Daughter, Peerless Chou</em></p>

  <p class="first">In the reign of the patriarchal Chun-kuh a venerable
  philosopher occupied a position of some distinction outside a small village
  in what is now the province of Shan Si. This versatile person, Kuo Tsun by
  name, had an only she-child, Chou, in whose welfare he was sincerely
  concerned. In view of what happens even within the limits of this badly told
  and ill-constructed story, it is hardly necessary to describe Chou's outward
  semblance, beyond stating generally that, for some time afterward, it was not
  unusual to meet quite elderly ascetics whose necks had become permanently
  bent from an inability to remove their eyes from her perfection after they
  had passed.</p>

  <p>At that remote cycle of time, matters had not become organized on stable
  and harmonious bases. A thick mist still obscured the land (for the canals
  were not yet dug), and under the cover of its malignant shade Forces of
  various kinds, both Good and Bad, were accustomed to frequent the earth and
  to reveal their conflicting energies more openly than they are prone to do
  today. Dragons of all the eleven sorts might be encountered anywhere. Winged
  snakes and phoenixes disturbed the air. Unicorns and celestial tortoises
  wrought the omens of their presence, and from numerous water-courses the
  voices of singing serpents--whose song is like the clashing of melodious
  rocks--tempted the passerby. The more ordinary manifestations of spectres,
  ghouls, vampires, demons, voices, presages, and homeless shadows excited no
  comment. For lengthy periods, sometimes exceeding years, the rain never
  ceased to fall, the lightning to be displayed, and the thunder to announce
  the labour of the High Ones, as the Immortal Principle strove to adjust the
  Eternal Equipoise. Owing to the absence of fixed barriers between the Upper
  and the Lower Airs many of the deities strayed down upon the earth and formed
  connections of the more intimate kind with ordinary beings. From this cause
  it came about that not a few people found themselves to possess qualities for
  which it was difficult to account, and it was widely admitted that, sooner or
  later, anything might be expected to come to pass.</p>

  <p>Besides being a discriminating sage, Kuo Tsun was also a powerful
  magician, and it was, indeed, chiefly due to his attainments in the latter
  capacity that he was able to procure the means of sustenance. While not
  failing to profit by the circumstance, the contrast was one that did not
  gladden his understanding.</p>

  <p>"It cannot cease to be an element of bitterness in this one's stomach," he
  was wont to remark, "that while he has no difficulty, as a mediocre wizard,
  in converting the baser metals into gold, as a farsighted philosopher the
  full extent of his laborious system has been to reduce Everything to
  Nothing."</p>

  <p>Chou, also, was not entirely devoid of unnatural gifts. She could, she had
  learned by chance, transform herself into the appearance of certain of the
  lower creatures, and in moments of concentrated emotion, when words became
  inadequate, she had the power of breathing out fire. But with a seemly regard
  for the proprieties she gradually relinquished both these practices, although
  a few sparks occasionally betrayed the sincerity of her feelings even in
  later years. Her own she-children enjoyed the same corrosive attribute to a
  less visible degree, while her he-children walked in the integritous
  footsteps of their accomplished grandsire. One became a high official, the
  second a fearless warrior, and yet a third a person of commercial eminence.
  All possessed the serviceable capacity of transmutation, but the process was
  rather more protracted and involved than it had been with the inspired
  founder of their Line, and it was not infrequently discovered that what
  looked like gold in its creator's hands had in some obscure way assumed
  another and inferior guise after it had been successfully disposed of.</p>

  <p>In the interval of his meditations, Kuo Tsun did not disdain to take Chou
  indulgently by the hand and to point out to her the properties of things and
  the inferences that his well-trained mind evolved.</p>

  <p>"We perceive," he thus explained, "that by a beneficent scheme of spells
  and counter-charms when the light goes darkness gradually appears, and when
  darkness has run its appointed span the light is ready again to take its
  place. What, however, would occur if by some celestial oversight this had not
  been foreseen, and both light and dark had been withdrawn together? The
  logical mind bends almost double beneath the weight of so dire a catastrophe,
  but it is inevitable that in place of creatures of the day and creatures of
  the night the Empire would have become the haunting-place of a race of pale
  and uncertain ghosts."</p>

  <p>"You are all-knowing," replied Chou with ingratiating candour, though it
  did not escape the philosopher's notice that she was gazing in several other
  directions as she spoke. "Your eyes see round the corners of the earth, and
  wisdom distends your waistband."</p>

  <p>"Say on," remarked Kuo Tsun dispassionately. "Yet should this appreciation
  forecast another robe of netted gold, or a greater sufficiency of honeyed
  figs, let it be cheerfully understood among us that this afflicted person's
  eyes are practically opaque and his outline concave."</p>

  <p>"Your large-handed bounty satisfies in every way," declared Chou openly.
  "The reference to your admitted powers was concrete and sincere. Something in
  the nature of an emergency confronts the one before you, and she would lean
  heavily upon your sympathetic lore."</p>

  <p>"In that case," said the magician, "it might be well to have all the
  support available," and he would have proceeded to trace the Symbols on the
  ground with his bamboo wand had not Chou's lotus hand restrained him.</p>

  <p>"It is by raising your eyes, rather, than bending them upon the earth,
  that enlightenment will come," she urged. "Behold, before us stretch the
  disputatious waters of the Ch'hang Ho."</p>

  <p>"Truly so," agreed Kuo Tsun; "yet by pronouncing a single word of magic I
  can, should you desire to cross, cause a solid shaft of malachite to span the
  torrent."</p>

  <p>"The difficulty is not so easily bridged as that," replied Chou, directing
  an evenly balanced glance of some significance. "What detail on the west bank
  of the river most attracts your never-failing gaze?"</p>

  <p>"Upon a convenient crag there rises the strong tower of Ah-mong, the
  robber chief," pronounced Kuo Tsun. "At the moment it is rendered doubly
  conspicuous by the fact that the revolting outlaw himself stands upon the
  highest pinnacle and waves a two-edged sword in this direction."</p>

  <p>"Such is his daily threat," declared Chou with a refined shudder of
  well-arranged despair, "it being his avowed intention to destroy all people
  by that means unless this one will consent to grace his inner chamber."</p>

  <p>Although Kuo Tsun could not repress an element of surprise that the matter
  had progressed to so definite a complication without a hint even of its
  inception warning him, he did not suffer the emergency to impair the
  broad-minded tolerance of his vision.</p>

  <p>"Thus positioned," he judicially remarked, "it might become more prudent
  to recall the far-reaching length of Ah-mong's sword rather than the
  distressing shortness of his finger nails, and to dwell on the well-lined
  depth of his treasure-store to the exclusion of his obvious shallowness of
  mind."</p>

  <p>"Perchance," assented Chou; "yet now direct your all-discerning glance to
  the east bank of the river and indicate what feature of the landscape most
  forcibly asserts itself."</p>

  <p>"The meagre hut of the insolvent scholar Yan is in itself a noticeable
  landmark," was the reply. "As the versatile student of the Classics is even
  now--by a process quite outside this inefficient person's antiquated
  wizardry--projecting a display of lightning flashes from a revolving wheel,
  the spot assumes an added prominence."</p>

  <p>"The perfection of that device is the assiduous Yan's continual aim,"
  expounded Chou. "This effected, it is his lamentable design to require the
  diffident one now conversing with you to share his penurious cell, and should
  this be withheld, to consume the world with fire."</p>

  <p>At this further disclosure of the well-spread range of Chou's allurement,
  Kuo Tsun did not deem it inept to clear his throat of acrimony.</p>

  <p>"Doubtless it is as it was designed from the beginning of time," he took
  occasion to remark, "for had the deities intended that men should control the
  movements of their lesser ones, instead of two eyes in front, they would have
  endowed us with sixteen, arranged all round."</p>

  <p>"Doubtless," assented Chou with commendable docility, "but pending the
  arrival of that Golden Age, by what agile display of deep-witted philosophy
  is it your humane purpose to avert these several ills?"</p>

  <p>"The province of philosophy," replied the one who thus described his
  office, "is not so much to prevent calamities befalling as to demonstrate
  that they are blessings when they have taken place. The only detail that need
  concern us here is to determine whether it is more unpleasant to be burned to
  death or to perish by the sword."</p>

  <p>"That is less than my conception of the issue," declared Chou with an
  indomitable air. "Is then mankind to become extinguished and the earth remain
  a void by reason of this one's inopportune perfection? Rather than suffer
  that extremity, she will resolutely set out to conform to the requirements of
  both positions."</p>

  <p>"Restrain your admitted reluctance to jeopardize the race for at least a
  few beats of time," counselled Kuo Tsun, withdrawing his mind from a deep
  inward contemplation. "There is an apt saying, 'What appear to be the horns
  of a bull by night stand revealed as the ears of a mule at daybreak,' and
  something in the nature of a verbal artifice occurs to me. Exactly what form
  this should take eludes the second-rate functioning of my misshapen brain at
  the moment but light will doubtless be vouchsafed. . . . Had the
  ill-dispositioned chieftain of an unsightly band of low-caste footpads
  possessed even the rudiments of a literary style, an eliminating test in the
  guise of an essay in antitheses might have been arranged between them."</p>

  <p>"With so unexacting a trial, the contingency of both succeeding should not
  be overlooked," interposed Chou decisively.</p>

  <p>"Leave that to one who in his youth composed an ode containing seven
  thousand conflicting parallels, so deftly interwoven that even at the end the
  meaning had to be sought in what was unexpressed," replied Kuo Tsun with
  inoffensive confidence. "Putting the same glove on the other hand, if the
  effete seeker after knowledge known to us as Yan had any acquaintance with
  the martial arts, a well-contested combat would seem to be the obvious
  solution."</p>

  <p>"Yet, with so formidable an encounter, the possibility of both succumbing
  must not be ignored," urged Chou with humane solicitude; but Kuo Tsun did not
  applaud her bias.</p>

  <p>"It is easier to get honey from the gullet of a she-bear than sincerity
  from between the lips of an upright woman," he declared with some annoyance.
  "If it is neither your will that both should fail nor yet that both should
  triumph, indicate plainly which of the two permeates your eye with the light
  of gladness?"</p>

  <p>"That," replied Chou modestly, "is as it will of itself appear hereafter;
  for if it is no part of the philosopher to avert misfortune, neither is it
  within the province of a maiden to hasten it."</p>

  <p>As she made this unpretentious reference to the one who should in the
  fullness of time possess her, the radiant being took from her sleeve a disc
  of polished brass to reassure herself that her pearl-like face would be
  worthy of the high occasion, and she also touched her lips with a pigment of
  a special tincture and enhanced the slanting attraction of her accomplished
  eyes. But when she would have fixed at a more becoming angle the jewelled
  comb of scented wood that restrained the abundance of her floating hair, it
  slipped from her graceful hand and was lost in the darkness of a crevice.</p>

  <p>"Alas," she exclaimed, in an access of magnanimous despair, "that is by no
  means the first which has escaped my unworthy grasp among these
  ill-constructed rocks. Would that I might have a comb fashioned of the
  substance of the great sky lantern hanging there, for then its shining lustre
  would always reveal its presence."</p>

  <p>"Even that shall be accorded if in return you will but share this degraded
  outcast's sordid lot," cried a harsh and forbidding voice from near at hand,
  and at the same moment the double-faced Ah-mong disclosed himself from behind
  a convenient boulder. At the first distant glimpse of Chou he had crept up
  unheard to gloat his repulsive eyes on her complicated beauty as his obscene
  habit was. "Entitle me to the low-minded felicitations of my questionable
  friends, and all the resources of a nimble-fingered band of many-footed
  mercenaries shall be pressed into your cause."</p>

  <p>At this proposal, an appropriate saying, in which a bullfrog sought to
  pursue an eagle, rose to Chou's lips, but before she had made the
  unflattering reference Kuo Tsun contrived a sign enjoining caution.</p>

  <p>"All this shapes itself to some appointed goal," he whispered sagely. "The
  actual end of Ah-mong will certainly be painful and obscure, but in the
  meanwhile it is as well to play an ambiguous role."</p>

  <p>"Disclose your mind," continued the obtuse chief robber (the philosopher
  having, by witchcraft, propelled his speech toward Chou's ear alone); "for
  the time has arrived when it is necessary to be explicit. On the one hand is
  raised this person's protective arm; on the other, his avenging sword.
  Partake of either freely."</p>

  <p>"Your amiable condescension retards for the moment the flow of my never
  really quick-witted offspring's gratitude," interposed Kuo Tsun tactfully. "I
  will therefore lift my discordant voice on her behalf. Your princely dignity
  requires that your lightest word be unbending as a wedge of iron, and in this
  matter my verbal feet are hastening to meet your more than halfway spoken
  gesture. Procure the slice of heavenly luminary to which allusion has been
  made, and the ceremonial interchange of binding rites will no longer be
  delayed."</p>

  <p>"The task is so purely a formality that, among broad-minded friends, the
  suggestion of delay would imply a distorting reflection," remarked Ah-mong,
  hoping to outwit Kuo Tsun among the higher obscurities. "Let mutual pledge be
  made on this auspicious spot."</p>

  <p>"Friendship," replied the philosopher no less ably, "has been aptly
  likened to two hands of equal size dipping into one bowl at the selfsame
  moment. How well-balanced must be the shadow cast by so harmonious a
  group!"</p>

  <p>"May two insatiable demons dip their rapacious claws into your misbegotten
  vitals!" exclaimed Ah-mong, throwing off all restraint as he recognized his
  impotence; and with ill-advised precipitancy he seized the alluring form of
  Chou in his unseemly arms, intending to possess her. In this, however, his
  feet moved beyond his mental balance, for as his offensive touch closed
  tenaciously upon her, Chou merged her volition inward and with maidenly
  reserve changed herself into the form and condition of a hedge-pig. With a
  full-throated roar of concentrated anguish, Ah-mong leaped back at any
  hazard, and escaping thus she found safety in a deep fissure of the earth.
  Not to be wholly deterred in his profane endeavour, Ah-mong then turned upon
  Kuo Tsun and advanced, waving his voracious sword and uttering cries of
  menace; but as soon as he was assured of Chou's security, the farseeing sage
  passed upward in the form of a thin wraith of smoke. Brought up against a
  stubborn wall, Ah-mong threw a little earth into the air and tried several of
  the simpler forms of magic, but so illiterate was his breeding that in no
  single instance could he pronounce the essential word aright, and the extent
  of his achievement was to call down a cloud of stinging scorpions through
  which he struggled back to his tower morosely, arraigning the deities and
  cherishing his scars.</p>

  <p>On the day following that of this encounter, Chou walked alone along the
  east bank of the river. Owing, doubtless, to the involved nature of her
  meditation, she was within sight of Yan's obscure abode before she realized
  the circumstance; nor did she at once turn back, partly because so abrupt a
  movement might have seemed discourteous if he had observed it, but also
  because she knew at that hour Kuo Tsun would be safely asleep within his
  inner chamber. As she advanced, slowly yet with graceful ease, the following
  inoffensive words, sung by one to the accompaniment of vibrating strings,
  indicated the nature of her welcome.</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"Seated on the east bank of the Ch'hang River,<br>
  I tuned my lute into accord with its dark and sombre waters;<br>
  But presently the sun appearing every ripple sparkled like a flashing
  jewel,<br>
  And my glad fingers swept the cords in unison.<br>
  So when this heaven-sent one approaches all sad and funeral thoughts are
  banished,<br>
  And my transported heart emits a song of gladness."</p><br>

  <p>"The time for such palatable expressions of opinion is, alas, withheld,"
  remarked Chou, as Yan stood hopefully before her. "The calamitous Ah-mong has
  brought things to a sharply pointed edge among our several destinies, and the
  future is obscure."</p>

  <p>"So long as our mutual affection thrives, no time can be otherwise than
  bright," replied the scholar.</p>

  <p>"From a poetical angle that cannot be gainsaid," admitted Chou. "None the
  less truly is it written, 'Even flowers turn their faces from the sun that
  sets', and my revered father is, after all, semi-human."</p>

  <p>"Are then the feet of the profound Kuo Tsun's regard still reversed in my
  direction?"</p>

  <p>"Detestable as the admission is, your imperishable Treatise on the
  Constituents of Voidness is his daily execration," acknowledged Chou. "From
  this cause a line of dissimulation has necessarily arisen, and the one whom
  we are now discussing regards you merely as a studious anchoret, instead of a
  rival philosopher of dangerously advanced views."</p>

  <p>"How then--?" began Yan, but Chou interposed her efficient voice.</p>

  <p>"The situation has slipped somewhat from its appointed base," she
  explained, "and the commonplace strategy by which I sought to entice his
  esteem in your direction has taken a devious bend." In a few well-arranged
  words, the versatile maiden disclosed the unrolling of events, adding,
  "Foiled in his besotted might, the intolerant Ah-mong now kow-tows to the
  requirement of a no-less-grasping strategy. He has sent a written message of
  contrition to the all-wise of my noble Line, admitting that his punishment
  was just, but holding him to the promise by which he may yet acquire me."</p>

  <p>At the mention of his low-conditioned rivals' name, Yan could not restrain
  a gesture of dignified contempt.</p>

  <p>"Admittedly Ah-mong's mouth is large," he declared, "but the seat of his
  intellect, if indeed it has not completely shrivelled up, must be stunted in
  the extreme and of less than average quality. Furthermore, so corrupt is his
  daily life that, even on the most lenient scale, it can have very little
  longer now to run, while the greater likelihood is that a large adverse
  balance will have to be expiated by his weak-kneed descendants and all those
  connected with his effete stock."</p>

  <p>"In what way is this--this doubtless just punishment incurred, and how
  will it affect the lesser persons of his household?" demanded Chou, with a
  manifest solicitude that Yan was too high-minded to impugn.</p>

  <p>"Besides his ordinary crimes," he replied, "Ah-mong is known to do things
  of which a strict account is kept. These are punished by shortening his span
  of life here on earth before he goes to the Upper Air, where he will atone
  for the more serious offences. Thus he has been seen to point repeatedly at
  rainbows, to tread on grain destined for food, to annoy working bees, and to
  cook his rice, when pressed for time, over unclean sticks. In the extremity
  of danger, he hisses noisily between his teeth and he has an offensive habit
  of spitting up at shooting stars. Taking one thing with another, his end may
  come at any moment."</p>

  <p>"Yet if in the meanwhile he conforms to the imposed condition and procures
  the comb of silver light, how regrettable would be this one's plight!"
  exclaimed Chou, restraining with some difficulty an impulse to breathe out
  her sentiments more forcibly.</p>

  <p>"Set your mind at rest on that score," replied Yan with ready confidence.
  "An obvious solution presents itself to one of philosophical detachment. This
  obscure person will himself bear off the stipulated spoil, anticipate the
  sluggish-hearted Ah-mong, and then, despite the shadow of his inimitable
  theme, hold your honourable unnamed to the performance of his iron word."</p>

  <p>"That would certainly smooth out the situation appreciably," agreed Chou
  with more composure. "But how shall you"--thus corroding doubts again
  assailed her--"being small and badly nurtured, as well as unskilled in the
  proficiency of arms, succeed where the redoubtable Ah-mong falters?"</p>

  <p>"It is a mistake to judge the contents from the size and fabric of the
  vessel," declared the one who made reply; "nor is the assurance of the
  branded label always above corruption."</p>

  <p>"Your whisper," admitted Chou with inoffensive tact, "is more far-reaching
  than the vindictive outlaw's loudest summons. Yet has it not been written,
  'Beggars point the way to fortune'?"</p>

  <p>"Not less aptly does the saying run, 'No stream is mighty at its source,'
  " Yan made rejoinder. "Let mere misgivings fade. One who has brought down to
  you a diadem of stars to set upon your brow"--in this expressive way he
  indicated the string of poems extolling Chou's perfection that hung about his
  stinted cell--"is scarcely prone to tremble at the thought of ravishing the
  moon to deck your floating hair."</p>

  <p>"It is enough to have reached this apex," confessed Chou as she listened
  to Yan's discriminating tribute; "for my unworthy name will shine by the pure
  light of your renown forever. I am a queen upon a golden throne, and the
  people of the earth will bow down before my glory."</p>

  <p>At an early gong-stroke of the following day, after performing his simple
  rites, Yan took up his staff and set forth on a journey. Distantly related to
  him by an obscure tie, there lived in a cave among the higher Quang-ling
  Mountains an elderly astronomer, Cheng his name and his house the reputable
  one of Chang, who had chosen that barren and austere retreat out of a
  painstaking resolve to miss no portent in the starry sphere. To consult this
  profound recluse was now Yan's object, for who could advise him better than
  one who had spent the fullness of his life in watching the movements of the
  Inner and the Outer Upper Paths and the ever-shifting flux of the Beyond? As
  he passed Ah-mong's stronghold that truculent leper himself appeared upon his
  rugged tower and began to whet his great two-handed sword meaningly upon a
  marble hone, purposely throwing the drip in Yan's direction. To this insult
  the scholar replied with a suitably barbed apophthegm, but beyond this they
  ignored each other's presence.</p>

  <p>Chang Cheng received his kinsman gladly and set out a choicer sufficiency
  of food and wine than was his own abstemious custom. For some time their
  conversation was restricted to a well-kept-up exchange of compliments, but
  gradually the visitor introduced the subject of his ambition. When he fully
  understood what was required of him, Cheng's face altered somewhat, but he
  betrayed no resentment.</p>

  <p>"In temporal matters involving force or strategy, it is this one's habit
  to be guided almost wholly by the wisdom of misshapen Mow, the dwarf who
  waits upon his person," he remarked. "Retire now to your inner recess of the
  cave, and when the pygmy alluded to returns from gathering herbs, some scheme
  advancing your felicity may be propounded. In the meanwhile--prosperity and
  an absence of dragon dreams from about your couch attend you!"</p>

  <p>"May the planets weave the lucky sign above your virtuous head!" replied
  Yan with equal aptness, as he lay down upon the floor. Weary as he was with
  the long exertion of the day, thoughts of Chou and of the great enterprise
  upon which his feet had entered kept him for many gong-strokes from floating
  off into the Middle Air, but as long as he remained awake, whenever he raised
  his head he could hear the distant murmur of thoughtful voices as Chang Cheng
  and the gnomish Mow discussed the means of his advancement.</p>

  <p>The next morning Yan would have questioned Chang Cheng as to the outcome
  of the discourse, but the astronomer parried the inquiry with a ready
  saying.</p>

  <p>" 'He who can predict winning numbers has no need to let off crackers,' "
  he made reply. "What we shall offer for your enlargement will be displayed at
  the proper moment."</p>

  <p>"If it is not inopportune, I should like to exchange greetings with one
  whose cunning stands so high in your esteem," said Yan. "Will the dwarf Mow
  presently appear?"</p>

  <p>"He has set out upon a distant journey," replied the other evasively. "Now
  that the light is here, let us go forth."</p>

  <p>He led the way across the mountains, avoiding the path by which Yan had
  come, and soon they were in a hidden valley, between two projecting
  crags.</p>

  <p>"These two rocks have been called Jin and Ne-u for a certain reason,"
  remarked the astronomer, stopping midway through the ravine and searching the
  stunted growth around his feet. "Formerly a learned sorcerer lived about this
  spot, but he was changed into a rivulet by an even stronger power whom he had
  rashly challenged."</p>

  <p>"Doubtless, in a modified way, he can still disclose his wisdom?"
  suggested Yan.</p>

  <p>"For a time he did so, and the spot had some renown, but during an
  excessive drought the wellspring of his being dried up and nothing now
  remains of him. He left a pair of magic iron sandals, however, with the
  message that whoever could wear them would get his heart's desire."</p>

  <p>"Was the accommodating prediction verified?" inquired Yan with heightened
  interest.</p>

  <p>"It has never yet been put to the corroding test. Of those who tried to
  profit by the charm, many were unable to don the gear at all, and of those
  who could, none were successful in moving from the spot. Therein the
  requirement failed."</p>

  <p>"If it is not taking up too much of your meritorious time, I would gladly
  make the essay," declared the student. "Priceless as your help will be, it is
  as well to remember the saying, 'Do not carry all your meat held on one
  skewer.' "</p>

  <p>"It is for that very reason that I have brought you to this forgotten
  place," replied Chang Cheng. "Here are the sandals lying among the brake; it
  only remains for you to justify your boldness."</p>

  <p>Yan knelt beside the iron shoes and, with some exertion, adapted his feet
  to their proportions. The astronomer meanwhile lent his aid, and at a certain
  point he bent down and pressed the fastenings of the sandals in a special
  manner. This done, he stood aside.</p>

  <p>"The omens of success are not wanting," exclaimed Yan, standing upright
  but remaining on the spot. "Yet so far my self-willed limbs betray my exalted
  spirit."</p>

  <p>"That is not to be wondered at, seeing that the iron rings, now
  inextricably fixed about your feet, are chained to the rocks Jin and Ne-u, on
  on either side," replied Chang Cheng, speaking in an altered voice. "The time
  has now arrived when sincerity may prevail and subterfuge be banished. This
  design to bind the planets to your purpose, O shortsighted Yan, is a menace
  to the orderly precision of the Paths and it cannot be endured. Desist you
  shall, either by force or by entering into a bond pledging your repose, and
  the repose of the one whom you most covet, throughout futurity."</p>

  <p>"That oath will never be exacted, thou detestable Chang Cheng!" cried Yan,
  straining at his chains. "Is this then the hospitality of the house of Chang,
  that was a kennel in the courtyard of my forbears' palace? Or do malignant
  changelings haunt the Quang-ling heights?"</p>

  <p>"It is better to destroy a shrub than to mutilate a tree," stubbornly
  maintained Chang Cheng, but he kept his face averted from that time onward.
  "However, as it is truly said, 'If there is meat at one end of a boar, there
  are sharp tusks at the other,' and so long as you reject the pacific course
  there still remains the coercive." With these insatiable words the perfidious
  astronomer took from beneath his cloak a cake of paste and a jar of water and
  placed them on an adjacent rock. "From time to time further sustenance will
  be provided, and when you are ready to bring your weak-eyed period of
  restraint to an accommodating close, a pacific sign will not find me hard
  stomached. May the All-knowing lead your feet to wisdom."</p>

  <p>"May the Destinies guide you even on the edge of a yawning chasm,"
  responded Yan with absentminded courtesy, though on recalling what had passed
  he added, "and also over."</p>

  <p>In such a manner, the inoffensive student Yan came to be abandoned in a
  narrow pass among the desolate Quang-ling Mountains, with the noontide sun
  sapping the inner source of his nutrition. Resolved never to relinquish the
  hope of procuring that which alone would enable him to claim Chou's
  fulfillment, the likelihood of remaining chained to two massive rocks to the
  end of all time did not seem to be a far-distant one. Presently, his thirst
  having become intolerable, he began to drag his reluctant fetters toward the
  place on which his food was spread when, for the first time, the deep-laid
  malice of the offensive plot revealed itself. Thrust how he would, the rock
  was a full half score of paces still beyond his reach.</p>

  <p>In setting forth the exploits of Yan toward the attainment of peerless
  Chou, later historians have relied on a variety of excuses, some even
  describing the exact Forces that lent him their aid. Yet this should be
  deemed superfluous, for putting aside the protecting spirits of his devoted
  ancestors (who would naturally assist in a matter affecting the continuance
  of their Line), the outcome was one of logical conclusion. Yan's
  determination to avail himself of the challenge ruling Chou's disposal was
  unbending and sincere; to do so it was necessary that he should remain in a
  condition of ordinary existence; and in order to sustain life, food and drink
  were essential to his being. . . . Toward sunset, Yan stretched out his hand
  and drank, and ate, for by the tenacity of his purpose he had plucked up Jin
  and Ne-u from their rooted fastness and drawn them at his need.</p>

  <p>The next morning he awoke, encouraged and sustained. A renewed adequacy of
  food and water had been placed there in the night but at a yet greater
  distance from him than the other. By the time that the heat of the day was at
  its full Yan had reached this also, nor was the exertion so strenuous as
  before.</p>

  <p>For a period of which no exact record has come down, Yan continued chained
  within the valley of the rocks, and during the whole of that time of
  inauspicious trial the false-hearted Cheng did not disclose his two-headed
  face. Yet no day passed without bringing its sufficiency of food, but each
  time with the labour of obtaining it increased, until Yan had to traverse the
  entire space of the ravine. This he could at length achieve with contemptuous
  ease.</p>

  <p>When there was no greater test of endurance to which Yan could be there
  submitted, Chang Cheng one day appeared suddenly before him. Already Yan had
  striven to escape out of the valley, to confront that most perfidious kinsman
  eye to eye, but the ill-arranged protrusion of his prison walls had thrown
  back his most stubborn efforts. Now, with the thwarter of his ambitions and
  the holder of the key of his release almost within his grasp, a more
  concentrated range of the emotions lent a goad to his already superhuman
  power and with a benumbing cry of triumph Yan gathered together his strength
  and launched himself in Chang Cheng's direction. But in this he was, as the
  proverb has it, dining off fish for which he had yet to dig the bait, for
  with a vigour astonishing in one of his patriarchal cast the astronomer
  easily out-distanced him and, by his knowledge of the passes, gained the
  upper peaks. Howbeit, Yan had thus reached a higher point along the outward
  path than he had ever before come to, and the noise of his progress, as he
  dragged Jin and Ne-u crashing from side to side and destroying in his wake,
  spread the rumor far and wide across the Province that the Ho-ang Ho had
  again burst through its banks in flood.</p>

  <p>After that, Chang Cheng frequently appeared at this or that spot of the
  valley, and Yan never failed to extend himself in further pursuit. Each he
  attained a higher level on the barren slopes enclosing him, but the last peak
  ever defied his power. Observing this, the astronomer one day cast back an
  unbecoming word. Under the lash of this contumely, Yan put forth a special
  effort and surmounted the final barrier. Outside he found Chang Cheng waiting
  for him no diminution of his former friendship.</p>

  <p>"The moment has arrived when it is possible to throw aside the mask
  forever," remarked the astronomer benignly. "The course of your preparation,
  Yan, has been intensive and compact, for in no other way was it possible for
  you to gain the necessary aptitude within a given time."</p>

  <p>"Revered!" exclaimed the student, recalling the many occasions on which
  the venerable must have suffered extremely in his dignity at the hands of the
  pursuit. "Can it be--?"</p>

  <p>" 'Our troubles are shallow; our felicities deepset,' " replied the other,
  tactfully reversing the adage for Yan's assurance, "and in contemplating your
  spreading band of sons I shall have my full reward. When I have removed your
  shackles, be guarded in what you do, for the least upward movement will
  certainly carry you out of sight into the above."</p>

  <p>"Has not the hour arrived when I may put my presumptuous boldness to the
  test?" inquired Yan.</p>

  <p>"It will do so at a certain instant of the night, for then only, out of
  the millenaries of time, all the conjunctions will be propitious. Should you
  fail then through instability of mind or tenuity of will, demons could not
  preserve you."</p>

  <p>"Should I fall short in so unflattering a manner," replied Yan capably, "I
  would not preserve myself, for all hope of possessing Chou would thereby have
  faded. Yet out of your complicated familiarity with the heavens would it not
  be possible to indicate some, as it were, sharp-pointed ends for
  guidance?"</p>

  <p>"There are no abbreviated ways across in the infinite," replied the
  profound, pointing. "There wheels the shifting target of your adventurous
  flight, and should you miss the mark your fall into the Lower Void will be
  definite and headlong. Now wrap your inner fibre round my words, for when you
  wing your upward track through space, the rush of wind and the shrieks of
  adverse Forces will be so marrow-freezing that all thoughts which are not
  being resolutely held will be blown out of your mind."</p>

  <p>"Proceed, esteemed," encouraged Yan. "My ears stand widely open."</p>

  <p>"When you take your skyward leap from off this plateau, my staff will
  guide your initial course. If your heart is sincere and your endurance fixed,
  the momentum will carry you into the Seventh Zonal Path, whence your drift
  will be ever upward. Speak to none whom you encounter there."</p>

  <p>"Yet should I be questioned by one who seems to have authority?"</p>

  <p>"In that case your reply will be, 'I bear the sword of Fung,' as you press
  on."</p>

  <p>"The reference to a sword being doubtless an allusive one," suggested Yan,
  with a diffident glance at his shortcoming side.</p>

  <p>Chang Cheng moved his shoulder somewhat, thought the gesture was too
  slight to convey actual impatience, and he raised a beckoning hand.</p>

  <p>"At a convenient break in the instruction, it was this ill-balanced one's
  purpose to disclose the point," he remarked concisely. "However, for strictly
  literary exigencies, yours is doubtless the better moment. Let the dwarf Mow
  appear."</p>

  <p>"I obey, high excellence," was the response. "Here is the sword,
  indomitable Yan."</p>

  <p>Yan took the weapon that the gnome had brought and balanced it upon his
  hand before he slung it. Of imperishable metal, it was three-and-thirty li in
  length and three across and had both an upper and an under edge for
  thrusting. The handle was of brass.</p>

  <p>"I have somewhere seen the dual of this before," thought Yan aloud. "Yet
  few warriors have come my way."</p>

  <p>"It was formerly the sword of that Ah-mong who lived in a strong tower
  above the Ch'hang River, being both the secret of his power and the reason of
  his confidence that he should achieve the test," explained Chang Cheng.</p>

  <p>"That accounts for much that was hitherto obscure," admitted Yan, and he
  would have inquired further, but the astronomer's poise did not entice
  discussion.</p>

  <p>"The instant presses on when you must make the cast," declared the latter
  person, closely watching the movements of the Paths through the medium of a
  hollow tube. "The Ram's Horn has now risen and lying off its sharper end
  there winks a yellow star. Mark that star well."</p>

  <p>"I have so observed it," declared the student.</p>

  <p>"That is the Eye of Hwang, the Evening Star, and on it your right foot
  must come to rest. For the grounding of your left you must take Pih, the
  Morning Star, for that conjunction alone will form the precise equilibrium on
  which success will hang. Now gird yourself well and free your mind of all
  retarding passions."</p>

  <p>"I call upon the revered shades of my imperishable ancestors to rally to
  my cause," exclaimed Yan boldly. "Let none refrain."</p>

  <p>Chang Cheng indicated that the moment had arrived and held his staff at
  the directing angle. Mow, who knew the secret of the clasp, cast off the
  shackles. Then Yan, gathering together the limits of his power, struck the
  ground a few essaying beats and fearlessly cleft upward. Freed of the clog of
  Jin and Ne-u there was no boundary to his aspiration, and he sang a defiant
  song as he spied the converging lines of spirits string out to meet his
  coming. When he looked back, the earth was a small pale star between his
  ankles.</p>

  <p>The details of Yan's passage through the Middle Space would fill seven
  unassuming books, written in the most laborious style, but wherein would Chou
  reside? One only spoke of her--Ning, who with a flaming faggot at his tail,
  as the Supreme had ordered, was threading his tormented path among the Outer
  Limits. Ning had the memory still of when he dropped to earth to become
  enamoured of the slave girl Hi-a, and as he shot past Yan he threw back a
  word of greeting and would have liked to have Chou's allurement described in
  each particular. Let it suffice that "Between He and Ho," as the proverb
  goes, Yan gained his celestial foothold and bending forward cut with the
  sword of Fung what he deemed a sufficiency out of the roundness of the moon.
  As he withdrew, a shutter was thrown open and a creature of that part looked
  forth.</p>

  <p>"What next!" exclaimed the Being rancorously when he saw what Yan had
  taken. "Truly does this transcend the outside confine! Is it not enough that
  for a wholly illusory crime this hard-striving demon is condemned to live
  upon an already inadequate sphere and burnish its unappetizing face for the
  guidance of a purblind race of misbegotten earthlings?"</p>

  <p>"There will be so much the less for you to keep polished, then," replied
  Yan competently. "Farewell, moon-calf. I bear the sword of Fung."</p>

  <p>"May it corrode the substance of the hand that holds it!" retorted the
  other with an extreme absence of the respectful awe which Yan had relied upon
  the charm producing. "Hear a last word, thou beetle-thing: that once in each
  period of measured time I will so turn this lantern which I serve that all
  may see the havoc you have wrought, and suffering the loss of light thereby
  will execrate your name forever."</p>

  <p>Yan would have framed an equally contumacious parting had the time at his
  disposal been sufficient, but remembering Chang Cheng's warning, and his
  design being now accomplished, he turned and set a downward course back again
  to earth.</p>

  <p>His purpose would have been to embrace the astronomer affectionately, but,
  owing to some deflection which lay outside his sphere of control, he found
  himself transported to the region of his own penurious dwelling. As he neared
  it, he saw Kuo Tsun, who led Chou by the hand, approaching.</p>

  <p>"To confess a former error is but a way of saying that exactness now
  prevails beneath one's housetop," remarked the philosopher auspiciously.
  "Owing to the misreading of an obscure symbol, this deficient person had
  hastily assumed that matter originally began as Everything and would
  ultimately resolve into Nothing. He now perceives, on a closer perusal of
  your inspired thesis, that its first principle was Voidity and that the
  determinate consummation will be a state of Allness. In addition to being a
  profound thinker, you have competently performed an exacting test." Here Kuo
  Tsun pushed Chou slightly forward. "Take, therefore, the agreed but wholly
  inadequate reward."</p>

  <p>"Yet, munificence," urged Yan diffidently, "this meagre hut--"</p>

  <p>"All that has been suitably provided for by the justice-loving System
  under which we live," replied Kuo Tsun. "During your absence the decayed
  Ah-mong has Passed Beyond, and as he was a person of notoriously corrupt
  views, I invoked my own authority as District Censor to depossess his band
  and to transfer your Ancestral Tablets to his tower."</p>

  <p>"It is well said,'The Destinies arrange, but under our benevolent
  government all must help themselves,' " commented Yan, after he had suitably
  referred to Kuo Tsun's undoubted service. "Yet what was the nature of
  Ah-mong's Out-passing?"</p>

  <p>"An element of vagueness shrouds the incident," confessed Kuo Tsun. "It is
  whispered that a mysterious Being appeared among the gang and, proving his
  authority by the precision of his knowledge, enticed Ah-mong with the promise
  of a certain way to gain his end. This consisted of a stupendous javelin,
  having bamboo cords attached, with which it was proposed to transfix the
  great sky light and draw it down to earth. In the end the contrivance proved
  so unwieldy that the cloven-footed outlaw fell upon its point from off his
  lofty tower, when there was none but the Being near. Thus and thus--"</p>

  <p>"This concerns Mow, the subtle dwarf," though Yan, but he said nothing
  then, being desirous of keeping the full recital until he could compose it as
  a song, to give Chou gladness at some winter fire. He had, indeed, arranged
  an opening antithesis when Kuo Tsun's voice recalled him.</p>

  <p>"By a complexity of circumstances, rare in this belated person's
  experience of the Province, very little appears to be wanting to create a
  scene of ideal felicity," the venerable sage was remarking. "The Ch'hang
  River, for probably the first time in history, is neither in flood nor
  completely evaporated; an almost poetical verdure has suddenly appeared where
  no vegetation was ever known before; several of the rare kinds of feathered
  creatures have raised their harmonious voices, and now and then it is quite
  possible to see the great-grandfather of the sky above the mists. If only a
  company of musicians could be inspired. . . "</p>

  <p>Even as he spoke, a band of village dwellers of the younger sort began to
  pass that way. The maidens carried ropes of flowers which they had gathered
  at some toil, but many of the most powerful of the other kind had iron gongs
  and hollow metal tubes, sonorous ducks and fish of wood or stone, and a
  variety of implements capable of producing sound, with which they beguiled
  the time. Chou's many-sided interest in the welfare of all had raised her in
  their esteem and Yan's unassuming virtuous life was a byword far and wide.
  When the leaders of the band grasped how the position stood, they covered the
  two with whose involvements this threadbare narrative has largely been
  concerned with sprays and garlands and set out with them upon a joyful path,
  the minstrels, urged to a more tenacious vigour, leading the way. Thus, at
  the conclusion of their exacting trial, Yan and peerless Chou were brought in
  some triumph to the strong tower of the turbulent Ah-mong that was henceforth
  to be their home.</p>

  <p>For several ons after these commonplace events, the comb was a venerated
  relic among the descendants of Yan and Chou, but during the insurrections of
  a later age it passed into undiscriminating hands, and being then much worn
  and broken, it was thrown aside as useless. It fell in the Province of Kan Su
  and became the Yue-kwang range. It is for this reason that the upper peaks
  and passes of those sacred heights are always clothed with brightness, while
  at certain periods of the year the lustre they reflect equals the splendour
  of the great sky light itself.</p>

  <p class="first">It was still the habit of Kai Lung to walk daily in his
  garden and to meditate among the shady walks of the orchard grove beyond; but
  in this exertion he was prone to rely increasingly on the support of a
  well-tried staff, and even with this assistance Hwa-mei was disinclined to
  encourage him to go unless Valiant Strength, Worthy Phoenix, or some other
  supple branch of his now spreading tree was at hand to sustain his elbow.</p>

  <p>"Revered," exclaimed Hoo Tee, who thus attended on the occasion with which
  this pointless relation is concerned; "behold, there approach along the stone
  path nine persons of distinction and with them one of official rank. Would it
  not be fitting that I, on whom their high-minded conversation would certainly
  be lost, should serve a useful end by bringing forth an assortment of choice
  food to refresh their weary throats?"</p>

  <p>"Restrain your admitted zeal in that direction," replied Kai Lung, "until
  they have declared themselves. Should they come with expectation in their
  step, whatever you could offer might fall short of their desire; should they
  have no such purpose it would equally prove too much. Your pigtail has still
  some length to grow, Hoo Tee."</p>

  <p>When the nine wayfarers drew near they disclosed themselves as three
  philosophers of the district round, three young men of literary tastes, and
  three who without any particular qualification or degree were in the habit of
  attaching themselves to whatever seemed to offer a prospect of reward. In
  their midst was the stranger who displayed a badge.</p>

  <p>"Greeting, venerable Kai Lung," remarked the leader of the band. "May your
  meritorious Line increase like the sprouting of a vigorous ear of corn in the
  season of Much Rain."</p>

  <p>"May all your virtuous tribe be no less favoured," replied Kai Lung, with
  a desire to be courteous but not yet convinced of the necessity for any
  special effort. "Are your constituents well balanced?"</p>

  <p>As they slowly passed along the conveniently arranged ways of Kai Lung's
  flower-strewn garden, with a due regard to the ceremonial precedence accorded
  to their age, the nature of the occasion was presently made clear.</p>

  <p>"He whom we have guided was in the out-paths seeking the house that bears
  your worthy sign," explained the chief of the philosophers. "Plainly the
  occasion would seem to merit our felicitations."</p>

  <p>"My superfluous task," enlarged the one thus pointed out, "is to be a
  Bringer of Good News, and in this pursuit I take my daily stand before the
  Official List-board of our provincial city. There your pleasant-sounding name
  is honourably displayed, Kai Lung, and in accordance with the immemorial
  right of our exclusive guild I have hastened hither to be the first to reach
  your grateful ear."</p>

  <p>At this agreeable announcement, the nine neighbours of Kai Lung shook
  hands with themselves effusively, and several admitted that it was what they
  had long foreseen, but the storyteller himself did not at once step into the
  full lustre of the moment.</p>

  <p>"What," he inquired, with a rather narrow-minded precision, "is the nature
  of the title, and are the initiatory expenses set forth in detail?"</p>

  <p>"The latter part of the subject would appear to have been overlooked,"
  replied the other, after glancing at his tablets. "The distinction carries
  with it the privilege of unrolling your mat and relating one of your
  inimitable tales before any member of the Imperial House who strays within
  three-and-thirty li of your Domestic Altar-- provided that you are able to
  reach his exalted presence and that he is not at the time engaged on serious
  public business. It also entitles the holder to style himself 'Literary
  Instructor to the Shades of Female Ancestors' in all official pleas."</p>

  <p>"It is doubtful if so exceptional an honour was ever bestowed before,"
  passed from lip to lip among them, though one of the less worthy added
  beneath his voice, "It is more profitable to step upon an orange skin before
  a cloyed official than to offer pearls of wisdom to a company of sages."</p>

  <p>The venerable storyteller, however, continued to shake his head with
  supine misgivings, nor did the added prospect of having two compose a
  deferential ode in answer tend to restore his spirits.</p>

  <p>"Tou-fou and Li-tai-pe were not distinguished in their lifetimes, nor was
  a crown of leaves ever offered to Han Yu," he demurred. "Why then should I,
  who only stumble in their well-made footsteps, be thus acclaimed? The
  ungainly name of 'Kai' is easily mistaken and 'Lungs' greet one on every
  side: the brush of some underling has, perchance, blundered to this
  arisement. . . . Yet, which of my negligible productions was singled out for
  mention?"</p>

  <p>"Munificence," replied the expectant messenger, "the quality to which you
  owe your distinctive popularity would not appear to have been specifically of
  a literary trend--"</p>

  <p>"The frustration of Ming-shu's detestable rebellion might certainly have
  been deemed a notorious public service, by a too-indulgent eye," continued
  Kai Lung more cheerfully. "The delay of some two-score years in extending
  recognition is not unusual in a State Department connected with--"</p>

  <p>"Truth adorns each word," interposed the Bringer of Good News, not in any
  way desirous of becoming involved in a speculative discourse, "but your
  flattering reputation does not stand on that foot either. Rest assured,
  benignity, that it is wiser not to test a coin found by the roadside but to
  spend it."</p>

  <p>"Speak frankly," urged the invidious voice that had already murmured. "We
  being all friends here, one among another," and he looked pleasurably forward
  to hearing something of an offensive nature.</p>

  <p>"A wet robe is more becoming than a borrowed umbrella," was Kai Lung's
  tolerant pronouncement as he signified assent that the stranger should
  proceed. "Withhold nothing."</p>

  <p>"However dubious the soil, the rice conveys no taint," aptly replied the
  other. "But, since you persist, the unexpressed part of the occasion is as
  follows. A rumour has of late sprung up, esteemed, that you have been
  miraculously endowed with the unusual gift of being able to walk on the side
  of a house, or in any other upright place, with the superior agility over our
  own race possessed by all winged insects. 'If,' the analogy has thence
  continued, 'the one in question (of whom we have never previously heard) is
  so remarkably conformed, it necessarily follows that his inspired productions
  must possess a very unusual blend.' Within a moon, benevolence, you have thus
  become what among those who put forth the printed leaves is termed a 'leading
  cash-enticer.' Seeing this, it behooved authority to move, 'For,' flowed the
  rhythm of their thoughts, 'inasmuch as flowers turn their faces to the sun
  and all men, when untrammelled, seek the highest, he who can claim the
  greatest number of adherents in any walk of life is necessarily the worthiest
  of his kind, and for our own repute we must profess acquaintance with his
  works and do him honour.' "</p>

  <p>"Alas," exclaimed Kai Lung, when he understood that he was thus indebted
  to a fallacious comparison with an illiterate insect, "how shall I meet the
  shades of Tou-fou and Han Yu hereafter? In our highly favoured land of
  unparalleled refinement is it essential to a just appreciation of his
  literary style that an unassuming relater of imagined tales must stand upon
  one foot for a record span of time, or be secretly conveyed to an unknown
  spot by a providential dragon, or consort with apes upon a trackless desert,
  or by some other barbarian wile appeal to the trite and superficial?"</p>

  <p>"Who shall ordain in what form the deities bestow their gifts or question
  the wording of the inscription upon the outer wrapper?" asked the philosopher
  Wan Fo--he who in earlier life had provided for a virtuous old age by
  arranging competitions. "The husk which in the case of the salubrious nut
  protects the desired food is, when we turn to the equally nutritious date,
  itself similarly surrounded--clearly with the humane intention both of
  warning mankind against hasty generalities and of exercising the teeth
  diversely. That which--as may demonstrated with a coin--is round when looked
  at from above, is flat when seen edgewise--"</p>

  <p>"Besides, O instructor," interposed one of the studious youths (less,
  perchance, with the desire of assuaging Kai Lung's umbrage than of deflecting
  the profuse Wan Fo), "have you ever yet attempted to progress upon an upright
  wall in the manner indicated?"</p>

  <p>"This one has never bent his commonplace feet to so grotesque an essay,"
  replied Kai Lung, with an appreciable distance in his manner.</p>

  <p>"Then for all that an ordinary person can declare you may be gifted to
  that extent, and as you are certainly now too patriarchal to put the
  contention to a test, it will never be possible to gainsay the achievement.
  How then," concluded the disciple, "can you logically reject a distinction
  which in addition to being founded on an admitted merit may even in its
  circuitous process be exact?"</p>

  <p>To this plea the others joined their voices, especially the Bringer of
  Good News, who foresaw no certain gain if the one whom he had come to apprise
  maintained a stubborn outline. Therefore, as they slowly trod the walks and
  admired the ingenious vistas--being prompted thereto by a whisper in his ear
  that he might thus induce Kai Lung to forget resentment--he approached the
  storyteller more directly.</p>

  <p>"Beguiler of men's leisure," he remarked astutely, "it is asserted out
  among the more trodden Ways that in your time you have framed stratagems, led
  armies, and fought battles. How is it possible for one who has thus
  controlled events to have passed his later life in a state of unbroken ease,
  plying his simple calling?"</p>

  <p>Before replying, Kai Lung led his guests among the remoter outskirts of
  his orchard where, on a few neglected trees, a shrivelled after-growth of
  fruit still lingered. These he laboriously sought out and pressed on each in
  turn, with hospitable insistence.</p>

  <p>"Had we been earlier here, the fare might have been more full-flavoured,"
  was his mild extenuation. "But who shall blame the tree that has already of
  its nature yielded crops when autumn finds it wanting?" Then turning to the
  Bringer of Good News he added, "Since you put it in that way, it will be
  necessary for me to explain matters by relating for you, to the best of my
  decayed proficiency, the Story of Ching-kwei."</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>The Story of Ching-kwei and the Destinies</em></p>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <h3>The Manner of His Setting Forth, His Encounter by the Way,<br>
  and the Nature of His Reception at Wang Tae's Hostile Door</h3>

  <p class="first">Not idly is the warning given, "Destiny writes with an iron
  spear upon a marble stele; how then shall a merely human hand presume to
  guide her pen?"</p>

  <p>This concerns Ching-kwei of the dwindling Line of Ying, Wang Tae the
  dauntless warrior, and the philosopher Ah-Yew no less also Shen Che, known
  later as the Poising Butterfly from the graceful lightness of her movements,
  and her sister Mei to whom no other name was ever given. It involves likewise
  the aged grandmother of Ching-kwei, the sorcerer who dwelt beneath the rugged
  tower of Ya, Shang king of the upstart power of Tsun, certain friends,
  associates and relatives of those chiefly engaged, warriors and captains of
  the various armies raised, usurpers and upholders of the dynasty, sages and
  historians, merchants and artificers, holy men, outlaws, and peasants, and a
  great variety of persons of the ordinary sort for whom no particular
  description here is necessary.</p>

  <p>Ching-kwei was of the age of manhood when he first beheld Shen Che.
  Thereafter he marked the day with a special sign (binding a knotted cord
  about his wrist), so that on it he might initiate any great enterprise on
  which his mind was fixed. It was the thirteenth of the Month of Peach
  Blossom, and on that day he united with Wang Tae in the Compact of the Cedar
  Grove, led the assault on the walled city of Hing-foo, and, last of all,
  turned home again.</p>

  <p>"Truly art thou thy father's very son!" exclaimed his grandmother one day,
  at a period before any of these things had come to pass. "Are we to starve by
  slow degrees? Here are but nineteen goats where yesterday a score responded
  to my call. Pursue the misshapen recreant with all speed before another shall
  have killed and eaten it. Take with you rice sufficient for a lengthy search,
  and if, in the course of your wanderings, you should fall in with a reputable
  magician sitting by the wayside, do not neglect to traffic a portion of it
  with him for a written charm against this person's pestilential cramps."</p>

  <p>"Venerable one," replied Ching-kwei dutifully, "your spoken word is my
  unwritten law. Yet how, encountering a recluse of this description, may it be
  assumed with confidence that he is all you would desire and not an
  unscrupulous imposter?"</p>

  <p>"Commiserate with him upon the malignity of his own afflictions. If he
  enlarges on the subject, pass him by."</p>

  <p>"Your words enshrine the essential germ of wisdom," agreed Ching-kwei.
  "Although," he added sombrely, "to one whose forefathers bore banners in the
  van of many famous wars, the pursuit of an erratic four-legged creature
  across a precipitous land is an enterprise neither dignified nor heroic."</p>

  <p>"Those who cover themselves with martial glory frequently go in need of
  any other garment," replied the ancient capably. "Be content that by peaceful
  industry you have goats to pursue."</p>

  <p>Being of a docile and obedient nature--and also because no adequate retort
  occurred to him--Ching-kwei respectfully withdrew and at once made his simple
  preparations for the search. In this he was assisted by the praiseworthy
  honesty of that region, for so humiliating was it felt to be that the animals
  of one family should ingratiate themselves into the herds and flocks of an
  unsuspecting neighbour and enjoy his confidence that to render this
  contingency as remote as possible it had become the time-honoured custom for
  each household to stain all its removable possessions with a distinctive dye.
  Thus Ching-kwei's inquiries tended to a definite end.</p>

  <p>"Has there by any chance a base-born interloper lately appeared among your
  lordly herd of distinguished-looking goats?" he might have vainly asked at
  every farmstead.</p>

  <p>"Is the one whom you address a hungry dog that the odour of one goat
  differs from that of another across his path?" would have been the
  discouraging reply. "Or have you counted the hairs of that which you claim to
  have lost, so that you shall describe it? Behold, within my flock are goats
  of every shape and kind, and by a meritorious fruitfulness their numbers
  increase from day to day. Begone then with this quail-and-dragon story of a
  wandering goat, the counterpart of one of mine, and seek a less wary
  victim."</p>

  <p>Truly; but what words of evasive contumely could be directed against one
  who should draw near remarking:</p>

  <p>"Greeting, opportune possessor of this majestic flock of vermilion goats
  which so decoratively sets off the fertile hillside."</p>

  <p>"Greeting," courtesy would demand in answer. "Yet the creatures are
  themselves evil in every bone, and the pasturage is meagre and full of
  bitterness."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, only one blemish mars the harmonious unity of the
  engaging scene. Have I your genial permission to disclose it?"</p>

  <p>"Say on--if you must," would be the morose reply, the one addressed seeing
  no other course before him. "But a virtuous life speaks louder than a brazen
  trumpet."</p>

  <p>"Your gracious encouragement moistens my laborious tongue. Among such
  perfection even these afflicted eyes at once recognize yonder ungainly
  outcast, whose ineradicable coat of blue is very thinly disguised beneath a
  recent dressing of red earth. Permit me, therefore, to attach this
  commonplace thing to its rebellious horns and to free your nobly descended
  herd of its distasteful presence."</p>

  <p>In this mutually inoffensive way, Ching-kwei had already on several
  occasions recovered defiant members of his flock, and had himself not
  infrequently suffered a similar loss at the hands of equally determined
  neighbours. But this time an unstinted measure of no-success marked all his
  efforts, and his persistent endeavour to implicate one after another of those
  whom he distrusted led to nothing but a spot ever increasingly distant from
  his own domestic hearth.</p>

  <p>It was toward evening on the second day of his quest that Ching-kwei
  encountered a brighter omen. He had then reached a barren and forbidding
  waste and was contemplating turning back from so cheerless a prospect when he
  noticed a little wizened mendicant seated upon a rock a few paces farther on.
  As even the rock had not been there the previous moment, Ching-kwei at once
  doubted the ordinariness of the occasion, and this emotion was added to when
  he perceived that the Being's teeth were composed each of a separate jewel of
  unusual size and brilliance, and that he had four eyes and held four books in
  either hand. A golden centipede was coiled about his feet, and from his
  escaping breath there was formed a river of clear water. Ching-kwei's first
  impulse was to render obeisance of the lowliest kind, but as he would have
  done so, it was put into his mind that the one before him, by invoking the
  threadbare garment of an aged beggar, wished to assume a part. He therefore
  approached the venerable one in an upright position, but saluted him
  obsequiously.</p>

  <p>"Ching-kwei," remarked the vision in some embarrassment, "the fact that
  you see me half as I really am, and half in the appearance that I have
  assumed, plainly shows that you yourself are not entirely normal. This
  foreshadows a life of chequered fortune, nor would it seem to be wholly
  settled yet to what end your destiny will tend. All this, however, is for
  your inner ear alone, for it would certainly involve me in humiliating
  censure if it became known in the Upper World that I had, in a moment of
  indiscretion, exceeded my imposed task. This is simply, in the guise of an
  aged native of these parts, to influence you from turning your dejected feet
  on a homeward bend by observing in your hearing,'Many hoof marks point inward
  at Wang Tae's gate but few lead out again,' adding,'To the deaf ox a meaning
  word is as efficacious as a detailed statement.' "</p>

  <p>"Your timely warning falls upon a nutritious soil," replied Ching-kwei
  gratefully, but without any especial reverence for one who was so
  inadvertent. "On your return, you can safely claim that your message has not
  failed."</p>

  <p>The venerable made a gesture of familiar understanding.</p>

  <p>"Anything that I have said beyond, regard strictly as between one
  semi-supernatural Being and another," he remarked diffidently. "At some
  future period in The After, doubtless an opportunity of doing no less for
  your accommodating Shadow will occur."</p>

  <p>Having thus discharged his mission, the one in question sought to vanish,
  but being still confused by the mischance of their meeting he failed to
  pronounce the charm efficiently, so that, while he and the rock disappeared
  entirely, the robes of the patriarchal mendicant remained in a seated
  attitude upon a void.</p>

  <p>"Clearly it would seem that you do not necessarily act like a deity merely
  by being one," thought Ching-kwei as he resumed his forward path. The
  intimation that he was himself of remote kinship with the Immortals did not
  gild his imagination, for he had often recognized that he was in some
  undetermined way superior to those around him, although the circumstance did
  not appear to have any direct pecuniary advantage.</p>

  <p>He had soon other things to engage his mind upon, for, as he advanced, he
  heard from the scanty peasants of that inhospitable tract that Wang Tae's
  dwelling was near at hand. It was spoken of as being strongly staked about,
  but when Ching-kwei would have learned something of the nature and attitudes
  of the one whom he was seeking, those he questioned ceased to speak and
  replied only by signs of such profound significance as to be wholly
  unintelligible.</p>

  <p>"It is truly said, 'A fly on the window may be taken for an eagle in the
  sky,' and Wang Tae is doubtless no more formidable than any other man upon
  two feet," reasoned Ching-kwei aloud, as he approached a stronghold of the
  kind described to him, and he would have continued in the strain when a
  defiant voice caused him to turn. One whom he had not observed in his
  eagerness to press on had stepped forward and now stood barring the path of
  his retreat.</p>

  <p>"Perchance," retorted this inopportune stranger, "but Wang Tae does not go
  upon two feet, and as he therein differs from the generality of men, so are
  the depth and lustre of his power not to be measured by a wooden rule," and
  the one who spoke indicated with a gesture of contempt the staff that
  Ching-kwei carried. "If our agreeable conversation is to continue in the same
  harmonious vein, let your persuasive tongue acquire a more businesslike
  point," and he struck the handle of the sword he wore.</p>

  <p>"It is certainly my intention to speak a few pacific words at Wang Tae's
  door, touching the movements of an erring goat I seek," replied Ching-kwei
  mildly. "Should his reception of what I have to say not be entirely thus and
  thus, however, it will then be time to shape my tongue to a more incisive
  edge."</p>

  <p>"Your well-chosen language fills me with the most joyous anticipation,"
  said Wang Tae, moistening his hands with gross elaboration. "Here is the gate
  of my neglected hovel. When you have seen all you want of the outside world,
  pass within."</p>

  <p>It is in this not entirely sympathetic manner that Wang Tae now comes into
  the narrative, and it is chiefly owing to that voracious person's large
  military appetite that the onward history of Ching-kwei moves to the measured
  clash of arms. At the time of this encounter, Wang Tae was of a middle age
  and very lusty in his strength. His hair was long and matted, his eyes open
  and sincere, and the expression of his face both bold and menacing. So bushy
  were his eyebrows as to give rise to the saying that phoenixes might build
  there, and with the closing of his hands he could crush a rock. In height he
  would have been above the ordinary had not both his feet been lacking; for
  having at an earlier period displeased the ruling lord of Tsun, that prince
  had caused them to be sawn off, to correct, he said, Wang Tae's rising
  ambition.</p>

  <p>"Henceforth," declared the conscientious ruler, when this act of justice
  was accomplished, "it can no longer be hinted that your aspiring footprints
  point toward a throne, Wang Tae."</p>

  <p>"Benevolence," replied Wang Tae unmoved, "by cutting back the branches of
  a tree, you do but increase the vigour of its fruit, and I will yet leave the
  impress of my thumb upon the age."</p>

  <p>Carrying with him the echo of this vainglorious boast, Wang Tae retired to
  a desert place apart and there built himself a strong retreat, guarding it
  with a trench and a palisade of teak. He lived by establishing a system of
  taxation for the benefit of travellers of the richer kind who passed that
  way, and gradually he found around him a company of necessitous persons who
  were of his own way of thinking. From time to time secret messengers went to
  and fro throughout the province, and as the land continued to grow more
  troubled, men's thoughts began to turn toward Wang Tae as to a leafy banyan
  tree when the rain threatens to fall.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <h3>The Influence of the Wise Philosopher Ah-Yew<br>
  and the Inspired Assurance of His Parting Forecast</h3>

  <p>When Wang Tae with a ceremonious welcome threw wide the gate of his outer
  yard, Ching-kwei did not hesitate, nor did the sound of the bolt being wedged
  against his escape cause him to stop. He found himself overlooking a
  considerable enclosure wherein every sort of beast displayed every variety of
  colour; a goat stained with his own distinctive shade of blue sported among
  its kind.</p>

  <p>"In the matter of the colour of my herd I am content to preserve the
  harmonious blend of nature," remarked Wang Tae, reaching his side again and
  speaking with polished insincerity. "What is good enough to arch the heavens
  is good enough to adorn my pastures."</p>

  <p>"It is well said," agreed Ching-kwei. "Furthermore, by the same analogy,
  both manifestations would appear to be of spontaneous origin."</p>

  <p>"The honey of your continual approbation is too rich for my weak mental
  appetite," said Wang Tae, by no means pleased at the insidious courtesy of
  Ching-kwei's replies. "Is there haply nothing here to displease your
  fastidious eye?"</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, there is that which amply rewards my inefficient sight,
  for at no great distance this person perceives the object of his footweary
  search. Permit him, therefore, to lead the truant home in triumph and your
  virtuous name shall ever remain a synonym for uprightness."</p>

  <p>"Put forth your self-reliant hand and take it, then," replied Wang Tae,
  leaping down into the yard to draw his impatient sword. "There is but one
  slender bar between."</p>

  <p>"No obstacle is both too high to get over and too low to get under,"
  retorted Ching-kwei no less resolutely, and he suddenly thrust his staff
  forward in a way that Wang Tae was not prepared for.</p>

  <p>In considering the various facets of the not altogether dignified
  encounter that ensued, it is necessary to hold an impartial balance.
  Admittedly Wang Tae was by repute one of the most skillful sword users of his
  day, while Ching-kwei was then wholly deficient in the simplest passes of
  that weapon. The latter person, however, was wont to rely in every emergency
  on the dexterous manipulation of his herdsman's pole, while Wang Tae in all
  his numerous encounters had never yet gained experience of so contemptible an
  arm. The inevitable outcome was that neither could subdue the other, for
  while the length of Ching-kwei's weapon kept Wang Tae at a humiliating
  distance, the thickness of the outlaw's leather armor saved him from the full
  impact of the blows propelled against him. Yet it is not to be denied that
  Ching-kwei, by concentrating his efforts upon a spot somewhat lower than his
  adversary's waistband, found a means to corrode the tempered surface of Wang
  Tae's self-confidence and the loud cries of defiance which that person had at
  first raised in the hope of sapping the other's valour began imperceptibly to
  assume a more personal tone. It was at this point, while they thus strove,
  that one of benign aspect and patriarchal cast drew near and held up a
  restraining hand before them.</p>

  <p>"It has been wisely said, 'If he is a stranger, do not give offence; if he
  is a friend, do not accept it,' " remarked the auspicious person judicially.
  "How then does strife arise between you?"</p>

  <p>At this interruption both lowered their weapons, Wang Tae because he was
  not desirous of adding to the pain he already felt, while Ching-kwei had not
  sought the encounter.</p>

  <p>"I have no wish to conceal my part in the arisement," replied the latter
  person unassumingly. "I am of the forgotten Line of Ying and the separate
  names conferred on me are Ching and Kwei. Touching the cause of this, I did
  but claim my due."</p>

  <p>"That is the essence of all dissension," remarked the philosopher, but he
  averted his face at the mention of the stranger's name lest the conflict of
  his thoughts should mirror there. Then he took Wang Tae aside.</p>

  <p>"Say what you will," declared the outlaw, forecasting the reproach
  awaiting him, "but suffer me at the same time to continue rubbing the seat of
  my affliction."</p>

  <p>"If Ching-kwei's blows remind you of the teeth of vampires, my words will
  associate themselves in your mind with the tails of dragons," continued the
  sage, who may now be disclosed as Ah-Yew, the crafty counsellor. "You have
  done ill, Wang Tae, and by the anger of a moment imperilled what the patience
  of a year may not restore."</p>

  <p>"Continue in the same entrancing strain, excellence," interrupted Wang Tae
  bitterly. "Already this person's bodily pangs begin to fade."</p>

  <p>"When the time is ripe for action, who is there that is most essential to
  our common hope?" continued the wise adviser with measured sternness. "Not
  you, Wang Tae of the lion heart, nor I, venerable Yew of the serpent tongue,
  nor yet any of the ten thousand nameless ones who, responding to our call,
  will sweep on like driven leaves in autumn and with as little compunction be
  crushed down into the earth. But with us we must have, at every hazard, one
  of the banished Line of Ying to give a semblance to our unstable cause and to
  proclaim a mission accepted of the gods. Such a one, inspired by his
  destinies and suitable in every attribute, came to your gate today with a
  supplication in his hand and you, with contumely, have flung him back again.
  Could demons do more to bring about your fall, Wang Tae, than you have done
  yourself? Let me hence, that I may cleanse my throat of the memory of this
  ineptitude!"</p>

  <p>"Press your correcting heel on my submissive neck, instructor," murmured
  Wang Tae penitently, "for my all-too-ready sword admittedly outruns your more
  effective tongue. But in this matter surely it is not yet too late to walk
  backward in our footsteps. Ching-kwei, despite his royal line, is but an
  inexperienced villager, and a few words of well-directed flattery--"</p>

  <p>"Mayhap," replied the prescient one, "but even the guileless turtle does
  not put his head out twice. However, proceed to unfold your verbal
  strategy."</p>

  <p>On this understanding they returned to where Ching-kwei was endeavouring
  to entice the goat into a noose, and at that moment, by a device, he
  succeeded in doing so. To Wang Tae this seemed a fitting opportunity.</p>

  <p>"Nimbly cast!" he cried effusively. "Never has this one seen it better
  done."</p>

  <p>Ching-kwei wound the loose excess of rope about his arm, and still
  grasping the staff he turned to go.</p>

  <p>"Your experience is both far-flung and all-embracing," he made reply; "nor
  would the confines of your landmark seem to be any barrier to your exploiting
  loop. Henceforth our goats must learn to become more nimble."</p>

  <p>"You have come on a bleak and irksome march," continued Wang Tae, ignoring
  the venom of the thrust. "At least honour my deficient hut by entering to
  recline at ease and to partake of tea. To do less is to brand this person far
  and near as a bankrupt outcast."</p>

  <p>"I have already tasted of the hospitality of Wang Tae's stockyard; that of
  his house will certainly be still more overwhelming. As it is, I have so far
  preserved my life. I go."</p>

  <p>In this extremity Ah-Yew came dispassionately forward and stood between
  the two.</p>

  <p>"May the Threefold Happiness be yours, Ching-kwei," he said benevolently,
  "but for a single pause of time listen to my voice, for I am old and very
  fragile and doubtless we shall never meet again."</p>

  <p>"The venerable length of your blameless pigtail compels my profound
  respect," replied Ching-kwei deferentially. "Proceed."</p>

  <p>"There is a ready saying of these parts, 'The Northern men ride horses,
  but the Southern men sail boats,' thereby indicating the various paths
  assigned to us by nature. Similarly, Wang Tae is rude and strenuous from the
  shock of continual warfare, while you, Ching-kwei, living in a sequestered
  valley, have a bland and pacific guise. Yet when you go into the street of
  potters, there to bargain for a jar, how do you proceed to make a
  choice?"</p>

  <p>"Selecting one that seemed to meet my need, I would strike it sharply,
  thus to detect its secret flaws," was the reply. "Should it fail beneath the
  test, I would pass it by."</p>

  <p>"Therein lies Wang Tae's policy and the enigma of your welcome," declared
  the subtle Yew. "From afar, Ching-kwei, you have been marked out for great
  honour of a very special kind and to that end were your steps attracted to
  this place. Should you prove diligent and apt, there is no ambition to which
  you may not rise. But first it was necessary to submit your valour,
  enterprise, and temper to the test of sudden action; had you in this
  disclosed some hidden flaw, the call would have passed you by."</p>

  <p>"What you say is certainly plausible," admitted Ching-kwei, "but the
  industrious bee is not attracted by the brightest flower," and remembering
  his grandmother's rebuke he added, "Those who cover themselves with martial
  glory frequently go in need of any other garment."</p>

  <p>This reply was far from meeting Ah-Yew's expectation, for he had hoped
  that so definite a prospect would not fail to entice one of a simple mind,
  and the refusal found him unprepared. Seeing this, Wang Tae interposed his
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Those who cover themselves with martial glory do not stand in need of any
  other garment," was his arrogant retort. "It is both food and raiment and an
  elder brother too, so that he who wears it feels neither heat nor cold,
  neither does he sleep alone by night."</p>

  <p>Whatever might have been the outcome under other auspices, this speech
  finally decided Ching-kwei's course. "Wang Tae is admittedly my superior with
  the sword," ran the current of his inner thoughts, "and when she who has
  authority over me put forth that argument, I was unable to disclose its
  weakness. Herein Wang Tae has also proved his mastery, and it is not
  agreeable to a person of even remotely divine origin to be both physically
  and mentally inferior to the one whose rice he eats." From this resolve,
  nothing occurred to move him, so that, now leading the recovered goat upon a
  cord, he presently set out again along a homeward course. The last words
  between them were those spoken by the age Yew as the closing of the gate
  marked their diverging ways.</p>

  <p>"Ching-kwei," he observed on parting, "it is well always to remember that
  men are not conquered by their enemies but by the decree of fate. This
  enables the wise to bear an unruffled front in all extremities. Sooner or
  later, ambition will lead your footsteps here again to seek Wang Tae's
  assistance, but who shall compel the flower to fruit out of its season by
  plucking off the petals?" To this, Ching-kwei would have waved an appropriate
  farewell had not the goat leaped forward and thus foiled his purpose. When he
  looked back again, later, the patriarch had withdrawn.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <h3>His Visit to the Soothsayer Who Dwelt Beneath the Tower of Ya, and<br>
  the Incoming of the Two Maidens Whereby the Destinies Become Involved</h3>

  <p>It was not until Ching-kwei had reached an intermediate village on the
  following day that a chance allusion to a holy man recalled the second detail
  of his journey. The gifted hermit referred to lived beneath a ruined tower on
  the wildness of a certain hill, at a convenient distance from the village. He
  was spoken of as being reliable and not exacting in his demands. To keep his
  mind from dwelling on merely worldly details, he unceasingly counted from one
  up to four when not engaged upon matters of divination and the like, and in
  this scrupulous manner he had succeeded in regaining a state of natural
  purity. At one time a rival soothsayer, encouraged by the repute of Ng-tung's
  sanctity and by the stream of pilgrims attracted to his shrine, sought to
  establish himself upon another hill, but presently it was discovered that
  this later one, in order to endure the monotony of his life, found it
  necessary to count up to ten, and the craving for variety in his mind thus
  being revealed, he became discredited in consequence.</p>

  <p>Bearing a gift of rice, Ching-kwei accordingly turned aside and sought out
  Ng-tung. The way led through an avenue of flowering trees where the sunlight
  came in shafts, it then being past the middle hour. As he proceeded, a
  distant sound of melody came down the aisle, and on its near approach
  Ching-kwei stood aside to watch. Soon two maidens came in sight, one dancing
  as she sang, the other more restrained but equally attractive. There being a
  sward about that place, they loitered there, the one displaying a variety of
  very graceful attitudes to the rhythm of her words while the other moved
  apart and sought for certain chosen flowers which she broke off between her
  shining teeth and held there. This one wore a cloak of plaited straw dyed an
  engaging shade, and having once seen her face, Ching-kwei watched her
  unceasingly, scarcely sparing a glance to regard the other.</p>

  <p>"She is certainly a high official's daughter," was his thought. "Were it
  otherwise, I might offer her the gift of rice, but it is extremely unlikely
  that she eats anything beyond the scent of flowers and possibly an occasional
  fruit of the more sumptuous kind." While he was debating with himself how he
  should inoffensively attract her notice an incautious sound betrayed him, and
  seeing one of another kind so near at hand, the maidens fled, the cloak
  wearer dropping the flowers she had gathered in her becoming haste but the
  other still continuing to sing and to dance along her path.</p>

  <p>"Plainly my fitness for the society of goats and outlaws is self-evident,"
  thought Ching-kwei in an access of despair. Nevertheless, he recovered what
  the one had dropped and secured them in an inner sleeve, remarking:</p>

  <p>"Today I have only occasioned her this loss; doubtless in future years I
  shall find an opportunity to restore them."</p>

  <p>It was but a short li farther on to Ng-tung's retreat, and the anchorite
  welcomed Ching-kwei affably when he understood what was required of him and
  had received the rice. The nature of the task occasioned him no concern, as
  with unfailing accuracy he at once detected, by a few well-chosen diagrams,
  the personality of the malign influence at work.</p>

  <p>"Should any of the indicated substances be difficult to procure, do not
  let that disturb the confidence of your venerable progenitor," he remarked
  considerately, as he inscribed certain words and symbols on a shred of
  parchment. "If she will inconvenience herself to the extent of swallowing the
  written directions in the suitable form of a pill, the result will be equally
  beneficent."</p>

  <p>"Your mere words carry conviction," replied Ching-kwei. "No wonder your
  harmonious name is sown broadcast through this land."</p>

  <p>"Agreeably so," admitted Ng-tung diffidently. "Yet there is necessarily a
  period between seed time and harvest. Thus today, until your noteworthy
  shadow obscured my prosaic meditations, I had only been called upon to
  forecast the destinies of two adventuring maidens at the recompense of an
  inadequately made pair of unfitting sandals," and the versatile recluse
  displayed his brightly adorned feet disparagingly.</p>

  <p>"Did they whom you mention proceed from your hospitable door toward the
  west, and was the more symmetrical of the two covered by a plaited cloak of
  straw dyed an attractive shade? If so, I would willingly devote two or three
  brass cash to learn toward what end your divinations led."</p>

  <p>"It is never my aim to frustrate a natural thirst for knowledge," agreed
  Ng-tung, passing across his wooden bowl. "The one cloaked as you specifically
  describe, Shen Che by name, is fore-ordained to become a queen and in the end
  to jeopardize the throne. In the case of the other, her sister Mei, nothing
  particular is indicated."</p>

  <p>"This is sufficiently surprising, although her mien admittedly suggests a
  royal destiny," said Ching-kwei, endeavouring to subdue his strong emotion.
  "Perhaps, though, their distinguished father is some high noble of the
  court?"</p>

  <p>"By no means," replied Ng-tung. "He is an indifferent maker of the least
  reliable variety of threadbare sandals, his name being Kang, and his dwelling
  place about the cattle pools, beyond the marsh expanse. So humble is his
  craft that in times of rigour he is glad to make straw coverings for the feet
  of swine."</p>

  <p>"While you are in the mood, perhaps you would be so obliging as to become
  inspired as to this one's ultimate future also," suggested the other. "There
  must surely be occasions in after life when such knowledge could be of
  practical value even to an ordinary person."</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," replied Ng-tung. "Thus, if one's prescribed end is to be
  drowned at sea, it is possible to ensure a favourable extent of life by never
  venturing away from land until the natural end approaches."</p>

  <p>"Yet in such a case," reflected Ching-kwei, "would it not be possible to
  remain here on earth forever by not venturing away from land at all?"</p>

  <p>"It is never well to carry such matters beyond a reasonable length,"
  explained the soothsayer with an experienced smile. "Without actually eating
  their words, the Destinies generally contrive some hidden outlet, by which,
  if unduly pressed, they are able to give an unexpected meaning to a stated
  fact. However, in your straightforward case, at an added expenditure of eight
  brass cash, I will prognosticate to the outside limit of my power."</p>

  <p>To this Ching-kwei assented and Ng-tung at once engaged himself upon the
  task, skillfully contriving a fabric of deduction upon the stable foundation
  of the inquirer's nativity and the outstanding features of his life. Yet from
  time to time he seemed to have occasion to begin anew, and even when he had
  sufficiently tested the precision of his chart, he had resource to the
  manipulation of the sacred sticks. Finally, he prepared a little tea and
  poured its leaves upon the ground.</p>

  <p>"There is no getting away from the fact," he at length admitted.
  "Long-armed as the coincidence will doubtless seem to later and less romantic
  generations, all the tests confirm that the drama of your life also will
  reach its zenith within the shadow of a royal palace. The indicated outcome
  of your destiny, Ching-kwei, is this: that at the call of some great passion
  you will end a sovereign's life and by the same act terminate a dynasty."</p>

  <p>This intimation threw Ching-kwei into a profound abstraction. If the
  beautiful Shen Che, who in so short a time had grown inseparable from his
  thoughts, was destined to become a queen, while his own fate was to destroy
  the existence of a king, it was difficult not to attribute some link of
  connection between their lives, and in any case a not unnatural desire to
  trace the progress of the involvement to a slightly later period arose within
  his mind. To this inquiry Ng-tung turned a not wholly warmhearted face.</p>

  <p>"It is one thing to forecast destinies," he said, "that being an integral
  part of this person's occupation. But it is quite another branch of the art
  to explain how these things arise and what occurs thereafter. Furthermore,
  Ching-kwei, in the matter of the eight brass cash agreed upon, it has not
  escaped my inauspicious eye that an unworthy deficiency still lurks within
  this unpretentious bowl."</p>

  <p>"The oversight might have been more tactfully referred to in the
  circumstances," declared Ching-kwei with dignity as he made up the full
  amount. "Between one who is the mouthpiece of the Destinies and another who
  is fore-ordained to overthrow a dynasty should two brass cash this way or
  that lead to discord?"</p>

  <p>"The amount may not in itself be formidable, but an essence is involved,"
  maintained the seer. "Even the gods must live."</p>

  <p>"It is equally true that no dust rises from an unstirred soil," replied
  Ching-kwei. "Clear your mind of acrimonious currents, O Ng-tung, and
  integrity will no longer be obscured."</p>

  <p>Upon this slight derangement of the harmonies, the visit ended, and
  although they exchanged appropriate quotations from the poets at their
  parting, Ching-kwei did not ever again contrive to pass that way, nor did
  Ng-tung allude to a hope that he would do so.</p>

  <p>In the days that followed, Ching-kwei found a new distaste toward his
  former occupations, and he who in the past had been content to lead a company
  of goats from one place to another, to open water-courses, and to secure the
  harvest as the seasons came, now took little pleasure save in listening to
  the recital of tales of bygone valour from the lips of passing minstrels or
  in strengthening himself by contests with the most expert whom he could meet.
  Under the plea of an advantageous bargain to be pursued, he made an early
  journey to seek the house of Kang, near the cattle pools beyond the marsh
  expanse, but he found it deserted. The sandal-maker, replied an
  argol-gatherer about the pools, had fled to avoid being seized to satisfy a
  debt, and his household was now scattered. Shen Che and Mei were spoken of as
  going north to crave a refuge at the hands of one who professed a kinship
  with their Line, but the seasons were lean and bitter and who should say?
  Fine argols, in particular, were hard to come by. . . . Ching-kwei returned
  in a headlong mood, and for a while he would contend with any but hold
  intercourse with none. Later, he sought out his grandmother and reproached
  her.</p>

  <p>"Where is the sword of finely tempered make that our devastating ancestors
  were wont to bear? In former times it had its place above the Tablets of our
  race, but now that honourable space is empty."</p>

  <p>"It now has its place above the board on which the goats' food is chopped,
  out in the farther shed," replied the one addressed. "Thus for the first time
  in the history of our race it serves a useful purpose. Should you need it
  elsewhere, see to its safe return."</p>

  <p>"Its only becoming use is to add further lustre to our diminished name,"
  declared Ching-kwei with feeling. Then, remembering Wang Tae's retort and
  being desirous that his grandmother should recognize the falsity of her
  argument, he added, "Those who cover themselves with martial glory do not
  stand in need of any other garments."</p>

  <p>"It is well that you should have reminded me of the gemlike truth in
  time," replied the other. "I was on the point of contriving for your use
  another pair of lower garments to hide the open deficiencies of those you
  wear. Henceforth, cover the outstanding portions of your lower limbs with
  martial glory and I will save my cloth."</p>

  <p>"Probably Wang Tae could have matched this saying with another still more
  pungent," thought Ching-kwei, "but I have yet something to learn from him in
  most respects," and having no seemly retort in view he silently withdrew.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he took down his father's sword, and, as the days went by,
  he began to bend his powers to its use. At first, among the peace-loving
  dwellers of that untroubled part, he could find none able to instruct him or
  even willing to stand up against assault, but eventually he discovered an
  aged gatherer of water weed, Hoo by name, who in more prosperous times had
  been a pirate. Inspired by the promise of an occasional horn of rice spirit,
  this accommodating person strove to recall the knowledge of his youth, and in
  the end he did indeed impart to Ching-kwei the outline of most of the
  positions both of defence and of attack. Let it, however, be confessed that,
  owing to his instructor's style having been formed at the capricious angle of
  a junk's unstable deck, where he was either being cast bodily upon his
  adversary or receiving that one's full weight upon himself, Ching-kwei's
  swordsmanship to the last conformed to the rigid canons of no existing school
  but disclosed surprises and benumbing subterfuges against which a classical
  perfection could accomplish little. To this day the saying lives, "Like
  Ching-kwei's swordplay--up, down, and sideways all in one," to testify to the
  baffling versatility of his thrust.</p>

  <p>When Ching-kwei had learned all that the well-intentioned Hoo was
  competent to teach him, and could parry each of that hard-striving person's
  fiercest blows and beat down his defence, he cast about again for a means
  whereby to extend his knowledge further. In this extremity he was visited one
  night by the shadow of a remote and warlike ancestor and a means disclosed to
  him under the figment of a dream. Profiting by this timely intervention, on
  the following day Ching-kwei made a shield of toughened hide and took it to
  the forest. There he bound it in an appropriate position on the sweeping
  branch of a giant cypress tree. To the relentless force and gyrating
  onslaught of this indomitable foe, Ching-kwei now fearlessly opposed himself.
  Whenever a storm of exceptional violence shook the earth, he hastened to take
  up the challenge, nor was the blackness of the wildest night any bar to his
  insatiable zeal. Often he was hurled reeling a full score of paces back,
  frequently struck, stunned and bleeding, to the ground. More than once, being
  missed, the one who sought him found him lying there insensible; but he
  carried at his heart the flowers dropped from the lips of the maiden in the
  glade, and after every overthrow he returned again with an unconquered look
  of cheerful acquiescence. It is even claimed by poets and history makers of a
  later time that in those dark encounters Beings, and those concerned with the
  outcome of the age, gathered about the spot and strove to various ends--some
  entering into the fibre of the tree and endowing with special qualities while
  others protected its antagonist through all and sustained his arm. In this
  painstaking way, Ching-kwei rose to a great mastery with the sword.</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <h3>The Offensive Behaviour of Shang, Usurpatory King of Tsun, and<br>
  the Various Influences under Which Ching-kwei Resolved to Menace Him</h3>

  <p>In the seventh year of his reign the usurper Shang exceeded all restraint,
  and by offering sacrifice in a forbidden place he alienated the goodwill of
  his own protecting gods. What was even more important at that moment, by this
  act of defiance he roused the just suspicion of the neighbouring power of
  Chung, and the potent ruler of that State withdrew the shelter of his
  indulgent face. From that inauspicious day, Shang's strength might be likened
  to a river on the summit of a hill.</p>

  <p>Nearly twelve moons had come and gone since the recovery of the wandering
  goat. Ching-kwei was drawing water from a pool when he looked up and saw a
  solitary wayfarer who leaned upon his staff as though the burden of the heat
  and dust were too great for him to carry. Remembering the many occasions when
  he himself had experienced a similar distress, the sympathetic one hastened
  forward with his jar and offered it, remarking:</p>

  <p>"It is too trivial an act to merit even thanks, to pass on to one that
  which heaven freely sends for the use of all. Drink to repletion, therefore,
  and what you do not need pour out upon your weary feet so as to strengthen
  you in each extremity."</p>

  <p>"May the All-providing reward you with a hundred sons and a thousand
  grandsons, to sustain your age," exclaimed the grateful stranger as he
  thirstily complied. Then he returned the vessel to Ching-kwei's hands, but as
  he moved away his rod touched it, seemingly by chance, so that it gave out a
  ringing note. This incident, and the exchange of looks accompanying it, at
  once recalled to Ching-kwei his encounter with the broad-minded Yew, and
  suspecting something deeper he would have questioned the wayfarer, but before
  he could frame the substance of his speech it was too late.</p>

  <p>"Had there been a spoken sign, I would willingly have met that upright man
  again," thought Ching-kwei, and he was stooping to refill the jar when a
  gleam within its depths arrested him. He turned it over, and there fell out a
  golden fruit growing on a silver stem. He could no longer doubt the message
  of the sage's beckoning hand.</p>

  <p>As Ching-kwei returned, he met his grandmother at some little distance
  from the door, for the passage with the stranger had delayed him beyond what
  he was wont, and she had grown to misgive his absence. Seeing him, she would
  have turned back, but he called to her to stay, and when they were come
  together he delivered the jar of water into her hands.</p>

  <p>"My sword is by my side," he said; "the only wear that I possess upon my
  back. In the first wood I can cut a staff; in the last village, earn a bowl
  of rice. Henceforth, I must follow the pursuit of my destiny."</p>

  <p>"If you will but tread this path far enough, it will bring you to what you
  seek at last," was her reply.</p>

  <p>"Were we on the great earth-road, a few li farther to the north, that
  might well be," assented Ching-kwei; "but you forget that this unfrequented
  track leads only to our door. Furthermore, there is a certain peerless
  maiden, now wholly necessary to my very life, whom I must find."</p>

  <p>"In that case you had better stay at home; for if you are equally
  necessary to hers, be well assured that she will infallibly find you."</p>

  <p>"Customs have perhaps changed since the days of your own venerable youth,
  esteemed," replied Ching-kwei tactfully. "Nor is the one whom I indicate to
  be computed by our earthen measure, inasmuch as she exists on the smell of
  flowers, wears a robe formed of floating light, and is fated to become a
  queen--whose king it is my destiny to slay. Her imposing father, being a
  merchant of the princely sort, has gone hence on business of the state and I
  would follow. Nothing delays my journey now but your ceremonial
  blessing."</p>

  <p>"May the concentrated blight of eighteen generations of concave-witted
  ancestors ride on your back!" exclaimed the one invoked. "Is she who
  cherished you in infancy to perish in her own old age like a toothless dog
  whose master's house is closed? Where is this person's future recompense for
  twenty years of disinterested care and self-denial if contending camps are
  now to swallow you?"</p>

  <p>"What you have done is assuredly recorded in a golden book," declared
  Ching-kwei with flattering conviction; "and for this the High Ones will one
  day reward you."</p>

  <p>"Doubtless," replied the other adequately, "but not in the exact way that
  I should myself select. However, as was truly said when this person left her
  father's palace, 'Pity leads to love; love leads to madness.' If it is to be,
  it will be, but first return with me for a purpose that I will inform you
  of."</p>

  <p>On this persuasion Ching-kwei accompanied her, and being now free of her
  dissuasion, stayed to partake of food. When this was finished, she led him to
  an inner room and there unlocked a box that had lain concealed beneath the
  floor. From this she took a complete suit of the finer sort together with a
  cloak richly trimmed with costly fur, a shield of polished steel inlaid with
  gold, and a lavishly embossed scabbard fitting to his sword. When these were
  arranged about his person, she drew five bars of silver from a secret place
  and, leading him to the door, put them into his hand.</p>

  <p>"Go, son of my own son, and fittingly uphold the imperishable glory of our
  noble race!" was her parting word, and behind him Ching-kwei heard the
  thrusting of the bolt.</p>

  <p>That night Ching-kwei slept in a ruined temple, and at a little after noon
  on the following day, he stood once more before the strong stockade of Wang
  Tae's fortress. He measured the width and depth of the ditch with an
  appraising eye and judged the stoutness of the palisade, deeming each one
  sufficient for its purpose. Then he examined the resources of the massive
  door and the tower protecting it and could find no weakness there. Afterward
  he beat upon the metal of the outer gate with a heavy stone and continue
  until a watchman appeared at the grille.</p>

  <p>"Greeting to the valiant Wang Tae," he called across the space. "Bear word
  to him that there stands one without who would disclose toward his private
  ear a weakness in the chain of his defence."</p>

  <p>"He sleeps upon that side; begone, O clown," scoffed the keeper of the
  gate, seeing no profit to his own sleeve from the encounter (for Ching-kwei
  now carried what he had received wrapped in a skin and stood there as a
  meagre goatherd), and he turned away.</p>

  <p>"Perchance a familiar sign may awaken him," came back Ching-kwei's retort,
  and with it his trustworthy staff winged past the menial's head, carrying
  with it the lattice from the door. "Give him that message, brother."</p>

  <p>With gratifying promptitude, the door swung open, an ample beam was thrust
  over the gulf, and Wang Tae passed across. When that large-stomached person
  recognized Ching-kwei, most of the fury with which he had set out upon the
  enterprise melted from his expression, and finally he shook hands with
  himself cordially.</p>

  <p>"Ching-kwei," was his open-hearted welcome, "whether you are now come to
  claim tithe of the ill-assorted offsprings of that prince of profligacy you
  sought, or whether you have come to hazard for a throne, my roof is equally
  above you."</p>

  <p>"These things must take their proper turn," was the discreet reply. "But
  first of all, Wang Tae, I would disclose to you a serious error in the scheme
  of your protection."</p>

  <p>"Some word of this affair has already reached my backward ears," said the
  warrior. "Bring me to the point at which the danger lies."</p>

  <p>"Willingly," replied Ching-kwei, and taking from the pack his sword he
  unsheathed it. "So long as there is a mightier one outside your walls than
  there is within, your security is menaced."</p>

  <p>"That is a matter which is very easily put right," said Wang Tae,
  suffering his gravity to become very grossly removed at the well-planned
  jest. "Join the felicity of our commonplace circle, and the inference will
  manifestly be reversed."</p>

  <p>"Before I can do that it is necessary to see what sort of entertainment
  your hand provides," declared Ching-kwei, fastening on his shield. "When last
  we met, you were somewhat lavish of receiving and sparse to give--perchance
  being a stranger then I kept you too much at a distance. Now we can mingle
  freely."</p>

  <p>"It is impossible to misunderstand the challenge of your two-edged meaning
  any longer," said Wang Tae, taking up an appropriate poise and unsheathing
  also. "Your genial invitation warms me like the glow of very old wine. If
  only you are able to speak at all when I have done, nothing will be wanting
  to complete my happiness."</p>

  <p>The nature of Wang Tae's appearance has already been described, so that it
  is only necessary to declare wherein he differed from it. His armour was more
  massive than before, being embossed on every plate with studs of shining
  brass, and in place of one sword of awe-inspiring size he now wore two. But
  his great height obscured all else, for having lately found his shortened
  limbs to thwart his reaching stroke he had contrived wooden pegs to replace
  the missing feet and these his domineering nature led him continually to
  lengthen until he towered above a world of dwarfs. When he spoke, his voice
  resembled a multitude of corncrakes, calling at variance.</p>

  <p>"Should you have any preference for retaining a right or a left ear, speak
  before it is too late," said Wang Tae as they engaged. "But do not plead for
  more than one."</p>

  <p>"Take both freely," replied Ching-kwei, offering them in turn, "for so far
  nothing favourable to Wang Tae has come near either. First, however, let me
  correct your ill-balanced outlook," and by a movement which the other person
  could never clearly understand he cut off at a single blow the lower part of
  one of Wang Tae's props.</p>

  <p>It has already been admitted that Wang Tae was an expert swordsman, and in
  an ordinary sense he was able to maintain his supremacy in a variety of
  attitudes, but the necessity of bending his mind to carry on the conflict
  with one side so materially lower than the other soon began to disturb the
  high level of his skill. Seeing this, Ching-kwei assumed a sympathetic
  voice.</p>

  <p>"What ails the great Wang Tae that his blade no longer slices where his
  hand directs?" he said. "Take out your other sword, chieftain, and see if
  haply you can accomplish something more with two. Or beg a moment's rest
  whereby to find your scanty breath. Or call one from your inner room to wipe
  the drip out of your smarting eyes. Or suck the juice up from a bitter fruit
  to ease your gasping throat. Or--"</p>

  <p>"May the nine bronze tripods of Yu fall upon your pest-infected tongue!"
  exclaimed Wang Tae with concentrated feeling, and he made an incautious
  stroke that laid his defences bare.</p>

  <p>"Plainly I took too much before and I must restore the balance," remarked
  Ching-kwei and with a blow similar to the former one he cut through the other
  of Wang Tae's supports. "Now that you are somewhat come down in the world,
  eminence, we can associate more on a level."</p>

  <p>At this fresh indignity Wang Tae cast away his sword and bent his neck in
  shame. Finding that it was not Ching-kwei's intention to triumph over him, he
  recognized the justice of that one's victory, and after embracing him
  affectionately he led him into the stronghold of his walls with every mark of
  ceremonious deference.</p>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <h3>Wang Tae's Just Tribute to the Prescience of Ah-Yew,<br>
  and the Conference of the Cedar Grove, Wherein Ching-Kwei<br>
  Learned How Shen Che Was Scheming toward a Throne</h3>

  <p>That night there was a feast given in Ching-kwei's honour, and at it he
  was the recipient of many flattering compliments, although it was not
  considered prudent by the more discreet to refer to the recent encounter
  within Wang Tae's hearing. When they were all come together, Ching-kwei
  looked round.</p>

  <p>"There are assembled here a hundred swords capable of putting me on a
  throne," he remarked, "but I have yet to hear one voice able to keep me
  there. Where is the farseeing Ah-Yew, whose counsel is a better safeguard
  than a towered wall of seven heights?"</p>

  <p>At this there was a sudden and profound silence, each man looking toward
  another who should speak. At last Wang Tae was forced to make reply.</p>

  <p>"He had finished his ordinary work among us here and he has now Passed
  Above," he said.</p>

  <p>"When did this take place?" inquired Ching-kwei sadly.</p>

  <p>"Yesterday, at such and such an hour," they told him.</p>

  <p>"If that is indeed the case, how can we gather here to feast together?" he
  demanded. "It would be more seemly to be eating dust rather than drinking
  wine. I, at any rate, will have no part in it," and he began to rise.</p>

  <p>"It is easier to judge than to administer justice," replied Wang Tae, "and
  in this matter your exactitude is much at fault, Ching-kwei. Learn now how
  this has come about. Foreseeing your return and being desirous that no
  untimely omen should arise to mar its complete success, the one whom we all
  venerate laid a most strict injunction on our band that not even his own
  up-passing should be allowed to interfere with the rites of hospitality
  whenever you arrived. Thus, in feasting we are really exalting his decree
  above mere custom, and by rejoicing we mourn an irreparable loss."</p>

  <p>"This admittedly puts another face on the affair," confessed Ching-kwei,
  permitting his cup to be refilled. "Yet it is aptly said, 'When the tree has
  gone only then do we appreciate its shade,' and before long the fierce rays
  of a retaliatory sun will certainly attempt to reach us."</p>

  <p>By most of those assembled, this speech was well received, but there was
  one present who in the past had been rebuked by Yew for the ordinariness of
  his character, and seeing now an opportunity to barb an insidious dart, he
  looked ingratiatingly toward their chief and spoke.</p>

  <p>"So long as we have in Wang Tae a well-lined silk umbrella, the fiercest
  sun will shoot its beams in vain, nor is the reference to a defensive wall
  wholly to be praised. Ah-Yew was well enough in his proper sphere, but the
  present need requires a warrior's voice, and this one has yet to learn that
  he who has been so servilely extolled had ever drawn a sword."</p>

  <p>Almost before he had finished speaking, a score were on their feet to
  express their indebtedness to Yew, but Wang Tae himself waved them all
  aside.</p>

  <p>"When we who are here shall all have passed away and our swords be
  corroded into rust, our names will then be utterly forgotten," he declared in
  a loud and compelling voice. "But to the end of time men will come together
  in moments of great stress and being perplexed will say, 'In such a case thus
  and thus enjoined the clear-sighted Yew, the wily counsellor of the ancient
  days in the State of Tsun, and his advice was good.' In that lies
  immortality."</p>

  <p>This testimony so pleased Ching-kwei that he rose up from his place, and
  taking Wang Tae by the elbow he exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"It is one thing to reach behind your sword, Wang Tae, but I can never
  hope to get level with your supple tongue. Yet I would rather have said that
  about Ah-Yew than have found a ballast-load of topaz."</p>

  <p>"If you have felt it, what need of further speech, and why then should
  there be a rivalry between us?" replied Wang Tae, and from that time they
  were close in friendship.</p>

  <p>When the repast was over, Ching-kwei and Wang Tae walked together in the
  cool fragrance of a cedar grove, beneath the full radiance of the great white
  daughter of the sky, and the warrior freely then disclosed his plans.</p>

  <p>"As yet," he said, "it would be unwise for us to aim at the throne direct,
  for by doing so we should alienate the weak and doubtful without attracting
  to our incipient cause those who have wealth or authority to lose. Nor have
  we a walled city on our side in which to raise our banner and to give
  protection to a sufficient host. For this reason, it will not be prudent to
  declare you publicly just now, but before those whom we trust your
  sovereignty shall be maintained."</p>

  <p>"I regard you as the living symbol of the profound Ah-Yew," replied
  Ching-kwei. "For that reason, I am wholly in your guiding hand."</p>

  <p>"I am not without hope that he will occasionally find time among his
  important duties elsewhere to return to counsel us. In the meanwhile, he left
  an explicit chart of how to act in every arising circumstance. For the next
  year, our course is one of wariness, sowing ferment like a flung mesh across
  the land and enrolling the dissentious to our cause, but moving ever with our
  faces to the ground. At the end of that period of repression, we must, by a
  single well-planned blow, seize and contain an influential town."</p>

  <p>"Where the Shay River bends far to the north and then bends south again,
  there lies the great walled city of Hing-foo, which once this person beheld,"
  remarked Ching-kwei.</p>

  <p>"Hing-foo is the target to which our arrow wings its devious flight.
  Thrust like the menace of a hostile elbow out into the plains, Hing-foo holds
  all the land south of the Shay and at the same time threatens irruption to
  the north. Already there are many worthy officials of the town who
  acknowledge our sign and give the countersign and when the time arrives the
  more intelligent of the defenders-- after a few examples have been
  made--should have no difficulty in recognizing on which side virtue
  lies."</p>

  <p>"What follows next?"</p>

  <p>"Turning over on his perfumed couch, the usurping Shang will languidly
  exclaim, 'Two armies to the south and stamp these contumacious beetles down
  into their native mire.' Yung and Wen-yi will rally to the call and begin to
  enrol their forces to that end. Wen-yi is incompetent and old, Yung vigorous
  and a commander by no means to be despised."</p>

  <p>"If that is the case," suggested Ching-kwei, "would it not be prudent, at
  the essential moment, to ignore the menace of Wen-yi's advance, but,
  concentrating all our resources upon Yung, to offer him a sufficient price to
  turn the scale of his allegiance?"</p>

  <p>"The arrangement has already reached completion, and the amount is fixed,"
  replied Wang Tae. "Yung will be delayed outside the Capital and suffer Wen-yi
  to proceed alone. This chance to achieve the greater glory to his single arm,
  and so discredit Yung, Wen-yi will greedily accept, and, regarding prudence
  less than speed, he will urge on his weary force beyond a judicious limit. At
  a convenient obstruction in his path, our troops will bar the way, and,
  checking his advance, without permitting him to hazard a decision, will crush
  him between that agile wall and Yung's arriving hosts. . . . It is almost
  inevitable that Wen-yi will also discover the justice of our cause when he
  realizes his position, but it is difficult to see in what capacity we could
  make use of one so senile and inept."</p>

  <p>"Yet Tsun must have other leaders besides these and other armies ready to
  be led, nor can Shang dare to remain acquiescent in the face of defeat."</p>

  <p>"There are other leaders without stint and doubtless other armies can be
  raised, but to keep them from falling down again their sustenance must be
  assured, and here another force among the intersecting lines of destiny
  appears to play a tortuous part. . . . In the seclusion of your native
  valley, has the rumour penetrated yet of</p>

  <p>the wonder of Shen Che--why do you pause?"</p>

  <p>"I heard something that held me," apologized Ching-kwei. "Pray
  continue."</p>

  <p>"A shout doubtless from the banquet hall; some still linger there. In any
  case,</p>

  <p>a reliant watch is kept."</p>

  <p>"It was nothing but a distant echo. You spoke of one--?"</p>

  <p>"Shen Che, to whom the fashion of the day has given the name of Poising
  Butterfly, from the winged balance of her grace. Her life recalls a passage
  from the missing epics of T'ai Chang, traced on bamboo slips and strung on
  cords of silk. A year ago she cooked her father rice in a meagre hut set in a
  barren place-- if haply there was any rice to cook, he being but an
  indifferent worker in some cruder staple. The household scattered by
  misfortune, Shen Che, together with her sister Mei, went forth into a larger
  sphere, and being seen dancing by an affluent merchant, she cast her spell so
  that he lavished the surplus of his gold upon her capriciousness. From the
  feet of the merchant Shen Che stepped into the ya-men of a powerful mandarin,
  from the knees of the mandarin into the inner chamber of a high official, and
  from the shoulders of the functionary into the palace of the king. Now the
  whisper grows that Shang's royal wife will shortly fall into an obscure
  decline and, being thus removed, that Shen Che will take her place."</p>

  <p>"She will then become a queen!" murmured Ching-kwei.</p>

  <p>"She will become a queen, but in the end her influence will jeopardize the
  throne," replied Wang Tae. "In her, all the attributes grow to a large
  excess, her matchless beauty being rivalled only by the resistless witching
  of her charm, and the sum of both equalled by the splendour of her wanton
  prodigality. Shang is besotted with desire, and beneath her scattering hand
  the hoarded wealth of Tsun is already gnawed by dogs. To chase a dark look
  from her face, a loyal counsellor will be disgraced today; to win a passing
  smile, ten thousand footsore men pressed to a futile task tomorrow. When that
  time of which we speak arrives, there will be nothing left to support another
  army on. Men may be procured by force, but the bare earth cannot be compelled
  to fructify by blows."</p>

  <h3>VI</h3>

  <h3>The Standard of the "Restoring Ying" Being Raised,<br>
  Ching-kwei Is Hailed as Rightful Lord of Tsun, the Capital<br>
  is Besieged and an Unworthy Dissension Thereat Engendered</h3>

  <p class="first">The history of Ching-kwei and the nature of his deeper
  thoughts, his spoken words, the omens cast about his path and the genealogy
  of each of those who rallied to his cause--these might perchance be fittingly
  set forth in nine-and-forty meritorious books, but though the finest paper
  and the smoothest ink were used, who should remain to read? Rather, in these
  later times of groundless stress, men would reach for their street attire,
  the one exclaiming as he went, "What befell this long-throated goatherd,
  storyteller?" and, "Impart a movement to thy tardy brush," another.</p>

  <p>Let it suffice, therefore, that for the space of moons Wang Tae had spoken
  of, the confederacy persisted in its righteous task, linking the members of
  its scattered force into a living bond, and sapping the power of Shang's
  detested rule by various means. Then, when the fruit was ripe, the gatherers
  appeared, for in a single night they fell upon Hing-foo from every side and
  carried all its gates. Ching-kwei, seeing in the significance of the day a
  portent of success, led the assault and acquired much renown. All the more
  worthy of the citizens at once recognized in him the fulfilling of an ancient
  prophecy, and the city keys were laid before his feet.</p>

  <p>"Not that their necessity exists in the case of one who wears a master key
  about his waist," declared the spokesman of the band, "but Hing-foo has been
  taken and restored threescore and eighteen times in the history of its walls,
  and the polite formality has ever been observed."</p>

  <p>After the lukewarm and contentious had been humanely dealt with, the
  remainder of the populace settled down to existence as before, the unchanging
  motto of their city being: "Above Hing-foo are the heavens, on three sides of
  it the Shay, and on the fourth a ruler."</p>

  <p>At a later period, Ching-kwei was publicly enthroned in the Temple of the
  King and greeted with the royal salutation of, "Ten thousand years!" The
  execrated name of Shang was removed from every seal and record amid an
  outburst of tumultuous joy, it being proclaimed that all documents and
  obligations in which it had appeared should thenceforth be held as void.
  Having by these acts definitely cut off the path of their retreat, every
  person in the city was set to the task of repairing the shattered walls and
  mounting a sufficient guard.</p>

  <p>Events in the meanwhile followed on Yew's prescient course. Yung and
  Wen-yi converged as specified, and the former person brought a pacific face
  into Hing-foo and with him the stores and furnishing of all his force
  together with the staunchest of his men. On this foundation Wang Tae and
  Ching-kwei began to build the wedge that should drive the usurper
  ignominiously from his throne, for until he lost that last vestige of
  authority Ching-kwei might hold the handle of the sceptre but Shang still
  grasped the head. Across the intervening land, trustworthy spies were ever on
  the watch in suitable disguise, and no day passed without a message of
  encouragement being brought. Sunk into a deeper lethargy, the effete Shang
  scarcely deigned to turn upon his marble couch to listen to each succeeding
  recital of disaster; by his side Shen Che rose to more unbridled heights of
  recklessness until, in despair at the inadequacy of her own desires, she
  caused slaves to shoot priceless jewels from hollow tubes against the stars;
  while at the palace gates men and women fought for the sweepings from the
  kennels, and in the Ways the changing prices of a he-child and of a she-child
  went from mouth to mouth. It was at this pass that Ching-kwei and Wang Tae
  launched their force against the Capital.</p>

  <p>At the northern water-gate of Hing-foo, flat-boats were drawn across by
  bamboo ropes, and in this way the army of the "Restoring Ying" moved out. As
  the different companies with their appointed chiefs passed across the river,
  a notched record of their strength was kept so that Wang Tae should have an
  exact knowledge of the various kinds of warriors under his control. Of
  iron-caps, armed with spears, there were as many thousand as could be counted
  upon the fingers of one hand; of bowmen, each with threescore crimson arrows
  in a sheath, the same; almost as many slingers with their gear; five chosen
  groups of fierce-voiced leapers clad in striped and spotted cloth to
  represent bloodthirsty creatures of the wild, and a suitable proportion of
  stalwart men equipped with horns and gongs. In addition, there were
  banner-men who waved insulting messages of scorn; firework throwers, of the
  kinds both loud and offensive to the smell; several stuffed animals propelled
  on wheels, and a full camp of diagram-men, whose secret craft it was to
  spread confusion by their mysterious artifice. Every warrior possessed a
  wooden bowl, a fan, and an umbrella, and many had also brought iron swords
  and leather shields. Stores and utensils of the necessary sort followed the
  army on two thousand wheel-barrows in charge of the elderly and weak. Many of
  the chief leaders rode small horses of a hardy build, and in front of all
  went a cloud of war-chariots filled with picked fighters of established
  valour. The omens had been duly sought, and nothing was wanting to assure
  success.</p>

  <p>When this great army--which despite its vast extent moved with such
  precision that no part of it at any time completely lost sight of all the
  other--arrived before the Capital, the craven defenders at once retired
  behind its gates, nor could the most offensive taunts or gestures of the
  keenest provocation induce them to emerge. On the other hand, with weak-kneed
  lack of originality they stood upon the well-protected walls and by remarks
  of an objectionable personal nature endeavoured to luring passing members of
  the "Restoring Ying" to come within their reach, but all Wang Tae's troops
  were too highly disciplined to fall into the snare. Finding the defences
  stronger than it was prudent to assail, and despairing of the garrison ever
  having the refinement to come out and face a decision on equal terms, Wang
  Tae disposed his forces round the city and proclaimed a siege.</p>

  <p>Had the matter simply been left to its proper and foreshadowed course, the
  speedy subjection of the enemy could never have been in doubt. But it is
  truly said, "Even black may become unclean," and the immediate conduct of the
  corrupt Wen-yi imparts a double-edge of penetration to the adage. This
  squalid-souled person has already been fittingly referred to, so that it is
  unnecessary to do more than record the actual happenings. Not being deemed
  worthy of the honour of pursuit, after his troops were scattered in dismay,
  it was assumed that he would be driven to the necessity of sustaining life by
  begging from door to door--an occupation logically suited to his low standard
  of attainment. It must be inferred that Wen-yi had always played an insidious
  part, for, instead of acquiescing to a defeat that was final and complete, he
  treacherously began to get together his ignoble followers again, and even to
  induce other credulous and slow-witted outcasts to rally to his offensive
  cause. Working with the most unbecoming secrecy, and assembling in distant
  and misleading spots, he brought on his illiterate and deluded rabble by a
  serious of one-sided marches until he was able suddenly to insert his
  contaminating presence between the army of the "Restoring Ying" and their
  essential city of Hing-foo.</p>

  <p>Owing to this degraded act of perfidy, after several months of
  conscientious effort on everybody's part, the position may thus be outlined:
  the defenders of the Capital were capable of resisting any onslaught but were
  powerless to emerge and free themselves from the encircling foe; the army of
  the "Restoring Ying" was safe within its camp but was not adequate to the
  task of entering the Capital or of reversing a position on which all its
  system had been based and turning round to engage the despised Wen-yi; the
  garrison of Hing-foo was sufficiently protected by the river from the menace
  of Wen-yi's invasion but was itself too weak to march out and assist Wang
  Tae; and, finally, the decayed Wen-yi, having now exposed his feeble effort,
  was unable to move in any direction whatever.</p>

  <p>But however badly arranged this unmentionable person's despicable strategy
  had been toward a martial end, it had an outcome which that superficial one
  had never even though of, and very few more days had passed before Wang Tae
  called an assembly of the inner chiefs together at the council tent.</p>

  <p>"When Yu, the pike, lay upon the river floor waiting for a bird to fall
  into the stream, and Yen, the kestrel, sat up in a tree waiting for a fish to
  leap on to the bank, both went supperless to bed," he began. "Hing-foo, from
  which we draw our daily sustenance, is now a thousand li beyond our reaching
  hand, and the case is thus and thus. Let any speak his mind."</p>

  <p>"Your words are ruled with accuracy," agreed Ching-kwei, "but let there be
  no fear on that account. It is decreed that I shall most certainly destroy
  the usurping Shang and by the same act end the sway of his ignoble Line."</p>

  <p>"The fear to which reference has been made, imperishable," interposed a
  discordant voice, "is not so much whether you kill the vindictive Shang but
  whether in the meanwhile hunger will not kill us. What store of food is there
  yet remaining, chief?"</p>

  <p>"Some threescore sacks of rice--sufficient beneath a frugal eye for three
  days more."</p>

  <p>"Here again destiny sets whatever qualms one has at rest, for the third
  day hence is the thirteenth of the month of Peach Blossom, and that is your
  imperishable's lucky day," declared Ching-kwei with confidence.</p>

  <p>"Yet between now and the digging of our graves, what miracle will come to
  pass, omnipotence, unless we lay our elbow to the pole forthwith?" inquired
  another murmurer.</p>

  <p>"What exact form our deliverance shall take will in due time appear, being
  doubtless revealed in the shape of a nocturnal vision," replied Ching-kwei.
  "To pray for rain and then give water to the drooping vine is to deride the
  faces of the willing gods."</p>

  <p>"The celestial air you breathe, supremest, is too refined for the gross
  nourishment of those whom I command," declared a third. "An empty bowl will
  come within their scope, but not the sustaining approbation of the unseen
  powers."</p>

  <p>"Peace--enough!" exclaimed Wang Tae, being in a double mind himself but
  fearing an open rift. "Words make a deeper scar than silence can always heal.
  Let all consider well our present state until we meet again at a like hour
  tomorrow. Then when each one has contributed the weight of his deliberate
  word unto the common cause, we will blend the accumulated wisdom into the
  weapon best suited to our need. In the interval, let mutual harmony prevail,
  for, remember: 'Fire spreads of its own accord, but every jar of water must
  be carried.'"</p>

  <h3>VII</h3>

  <h3>The Nature of the Stratagem Discovered to Ching-kwei, and<br>
  the Measure of its Success. His meeting with One Whom He Had<br>
  Thought to Be Queen of Tsun and the Rearrangement of the<br>
  Destinies That Then Ensued. His Return and the Greetings Passed</h3>

  <p class="first">That night Ching-kwei fasted and made sacrifice to the full
  extent of all he had, and having thereby purified his mind into harmony with
  the protecting influences around, he composed himself into a tranquil state
  to await their guidance. At dawn he sought out Wang Tae before that
  quick-moving person left his tent.</p>

  <p>"In the past, Wang Tae," he said, when they had greeted formally, "we have
  reposed an unshaken trust in one another, and in the clash of battle my
  defending sword has struck out from underneath your weary arm, and your
  protecting shield has been held before my bleeding face."</p>

  <p>"It is true," replied Wang Tae with dignified emotion, "and the confidence
  that I still maintain in you is that of two men who walk along a narrow plank
  together at some great and rocky height. With me, at least, speak the first
  words as they rise upon your lips."</p>

  <p>"You are the front and authority of all our force, while in me resides the
  Immortal Principle. What, therefore, we two cannot do, shall the discording
  voices of a score attain?"</p>

  <p>"I am with you in this also," replied Wang Tae. "Should you demand an
  attack upon the Capital, I will myself drive the first wedge into its
  gate."</p>

  <p>"Our united mind could split a granite rock!" cried Ching-kwei joyfully.
  "But a less hazardous way has been revealed to me, as I indeed proclaimed. Is
  the extremity of our strait known beyond the camp?"</p>

  <p>"Spies from both sides pass in and out as usual on one plea or another,
  nor, hitherto, has it been well to conceal our obvious strength. Now, this
  weakness also has inevitably been carried to the councils of both Wen-yi and
  Shang."</p>

  <p>"Let there be no uncertainty upon that head. Instruct a judicious captain
  of your own to conduct the spies all round our bankrupt store. At the same
  time, let every warrior in the camp begin openly to furbish up his arms, to
  sing of victory, and to create a general stir. This, to the spies, the
  various chiefs shall briefly indicate, with 'Thus,' and 'Haply,' or, 'I
  might, if yet I would--,' but nothing more."</p>

  <p>"It shall be done," replied Wang Tae. "Before another gong-stroke sounds,
  a tincture such as you desire shall colour their reports."</p>

  <p>"Once they have left the camp, there must be no return. Appoint a double
  line of sentinels and instruct them to use even force if necessary."</p>

  <p>"That, any rate, will convince the spies that something unusual in
  progress."</p>

  <p>"All shapes round that end. Tonight a letter must be sent toward
  Hing-foo.</p>

  <p>This is its purport:</p>

  <p>"Illustrious Wang Tae to the Ever-alert Martial Governor of Loyal
  Hing-foo, Greeting:</p>

  <p>Our need is great, our stock being now but two-score bags of mouldy rice.
  In the mists of tomorrow's dawn we attack the Capital, having learned of vast
  hoards of grain and richer food of every kind secretly stored within the
  palace there. If at the same time we can tempt out the ill-made Wen-yi,
  assail his rear with all your force. He is very credulous and may enter the
  snare."</p>

  <p>"The scheme might be well enough," remarked Wang Tae, "but it is doubtful
  if our messenger can pass through Wen-yi's line and reach Hing-foo."</p>

  <p>"To make sure of that miscarriage, send the worst we have--in fact, two
  had better go on separate ways: even the obese Wen-yi can scarcely miss both.
  How next shall a similar implication be contrived to fall into Shang's unruly
  hand?"</p>

  <p>"I begin to smell the gravy of your pig," exclaimed Wang Tae with
  deepening interest. "There was a discontented eunuch of the palace guard who
  at first conspired with us, and messages have passed, but now the rumour goes
  that, one being dropped incautiously out of his sleeve, he has been charged
  and strongly pressed to tell everything he knows."</p>

  <p>"His name will serve. In this case it will run:</p>

  <p>" 'To--?' "</p>

  <p>"Tsan, of the Third Green Banner displaying Righteous Truth," contributed
  Wang Tae.</p>

  <p>"--From one whom he has knowledge of, greeting," went on Ching-kwei,
  continuing to write:</p>

  <p>"Our need is great, our stock being now but two-score bags of mouldy rice.
  In the mists of tomorrow's dawn we attack Wen-yi, having learned that his
  camp contains vast stores of grain. Hing-foo will sally and assail his rear
  so that we shall have no lack of men. A snare has been contrived to take the
  ill-made Shang and all his force, if he can but be tempted out at the sound
  of conflict. Urge him to this, and you and your well-born descendants in
  perpetuity shall be entitled--"</p>

  <p>"Eminence!" interposed Wang Tae hastily, "the one in question is--"</p>

  <p>"True.</p>

  <p>"--you and your illustrious ancestors in retrogression shall be entitled
  to an open green silk umbrella with yellow tassels on all state occasions. He
  is very credulous and may enter the snare."</p>

  <p>"Seal it with your special sign, Wang Tae, and dispatch it by a thoroughly
  unworthy hand."</p>

  <p>"Whom, further, I will omit to recompense. It shall reach Shang's council
  without fail. This scheme of yours, Ching-kwei, whatever the final shape, has
  a meatiness about its bones that stirs my appetite."</p>

  <p>"When the camp is free of all whom we distrust, about the hour of dusk,
  about the hour of dusk, let two-score chariots be emptied of their gear and
  drawn in secret to a hidden dell. To each pair appoint a tent of trusty men,
  some carrying digging tools, the others bearing for each car a sack of rice.
  The rest will soon unfold itself before your eyes, Wang Tae, but of this be
  well assured: the grain that we throw upon the earth tonight will bear a
  speedy crop and that a hundredfold."</p>

  <p>Is there a single one, aspiring to a polished style today, who has not
  heard or even used the phrase: "Like Wang Tae's rice--a little on the top?"
  Yet he who has followed these commonplace words so far and put up with their
  painful lack of finish need not be told that the whole scheme and strategy
  devolved upon Ching-kwei. Who should then erect a public arch, or compose a
  written book, or even found a dynasty, if in a few thousand years his labour
  is thus to be accorded to another? Certainly it was not so in the glorious
  days of Yao-u and Shun.</p>

  <p>But in order to bring this badly told narration even to an unpretentious
  close it is necessary to uphold the sequence of events and to state what
  followed after. That is the present way, and, as the saying goes, "If you
  would dine with dragons you must not stay to chew the meat."</p>

  <p>On the succeeding day, before the hour of dawn, both the hosts of Shang
  and Wen-yi became aware of something very violent taking place elsewhere. In
  the obscure distance a noise composed of every variety of martial strain,
  shout, roar, boom, blast, shriek, firework, rattle, imprecation, thud,
  musical instrument, and explosion grew and died down as it came across the
  intervening space at intervals, while fires at different points began to show
  and a great cloak of pungent smoke darkened the rising sun and shut out all
  the further details of the inauspicious scene. It was plain to each that the
  other was being vigorously attacked, while a demonstration in the nature of a
  feint was carried out against himself, but having been warned by intercepted
  messages, neither fell into the snare but lay behind his own defensive walls
  and watched.</p>

  <p>When the battle had been in progress for a sufficiently convincing time, a
  combined shout of victory rent the air, and soon everywhere signs of
  rejoicing could be seen and heard. Shang and Wen-yi strove to pierce the veil
  of uncertainty surrounding them, to learn if haply any remnant of their ally
  stood, but the distance and the glow of fire and the drifting smoke conspired
  to baffle the most discerning eye, and presently each had a more convincing
  sign of the other's overthrow than all that went before. Winding through Wang
  Tae's camp, on its way to some secure place of storage, came a long and noble
  train of chariots, each one full and well heaped up with shining rice. Four
  well-trained horses went to the ropes of every car, with two henchmen at
  either wheel and four to follow after, so weighty was the load, and as they
  moved at certain parts more at their ease, the men laughed and frolicked and
  threw rice by the handful at each other in wanton joy to see so much. Forty
  such chariots there were in sight at once, and then, after a pause, a score
  more, and then another score, and a little later a second forty as before.
  Wen-yi first saw the offensive sight and knew the worst, and after him in
  turn the abject Shang and all his court, for Ching-kwei's rice-train wound in
  and out among the camp for half a day.</p>

  <p>"They have penetrated to the very heart and treasure of the citadel and
  taken what they would. Without doubt the garrison is all put to the sword and
  the ineffectual Shang now cast in chains or slain," exclaimed Wen-yi. "Get me
  four bearers and an emblem of surrender so that I may hasten to eat dust and
  make what terms I can with this new line of kings."</p>

  <p>"The flat-stomached Wen-yi has failed again--as usual," remarked the
  ill-starred Shang in an accent of refined despair, at about the same time and
  inspired by a like sequence of events; "and without doubt he has been taken
  in the snare. As our last hope is thereby brought to voidance, the hostile
  camp re-stocked, and their road to Hing-foo clear again, nothing remains for
  this much-depreciated sovereign but to put on an appropriate robe of
  sack-cloth and to suffer himself to be deposed without further ceremony by
  the morally deformed Wang Tae."</p>

  <p>"Chieftain," reported a lesser captain to Wang Tae, as Wen-yi and Shang
  set out, "two separate groups approach the camp, one from the north, the
  other from the south, with banners of submission. What is your iron word
  concerning them?"</p>

  <p>"At the peril of incurring each one of the seventy-five recognized ways of
  inflicting pain, let them be kept apart," replied Wang Tae.</p>

  <p>Thus it came about, Shang's band by this time being brought into camp,
  that a message reached Ching-kwei, who had stayed within his tent alone, of
  one who sought his ear.</p>

  <p>"Suffer the messenger to pass the guard," pronounced Ching-kwei, for the
  word brought in had seemed to speak, though darkly, of the time which he knew
  must now approach, and they led one in whose face was masked by a visor of
  worked steel.</p>

  <p>"Omnipotence," pronounced a low but very golden voice, "I have a name to
  speak that merits your private ear. Furthermore, I bear no weapon anywhere
  while you have a notorious sword beneath your ready hand."</p>

  <p>"If I disclose my ear to you," replied Ching-kwei, motioning to the
  attendants so that they withdrew, "it is no less fitting that you should
  reveal your face to me," and he indicated the covering which the other
  wore.</p>

  <p>"Your magnanimity is itself a better shield than any I could wear," was
  the gracious reply, and what he asked for being done, they stood there for a
  poise of time, facing each other.</p>

  <p>"Shen Che!" whispered Ching-kwei, falling back a step in wonder. "You who
  are now a queen!"</p>

  <p>"I recognize in you the one who loitered in the glade, that day the holy
  anchorite warned me that we should meet. But wherefore do you call me by my
  sister's name, and why greet me a queen?"</p>

  <p>"Your sister's name?" replied Ching-kwei, with a great and sudden
  happiness singing like a nest of radiant birds about his head. "Are you not
  then that Shen Che who should become a queen?"</p>

  <p>"I am Mei of the lowly house of Kang, and to me no other name was ever
  given. For her of whom you speak I come to plead, that being my errand here.
  Of your illusion that I was other than I am--doubtless it grew from this:
  that we encountered only once and that but for a single passing glance. Let
  it not weigh against my cause, high excellence."</p>

  <p>"Not once but many hundred times, O dazzling one, have we two met, for
  every day that meeting is renewed within my heart; and though it was a single
  glance, so deep the image cut that the stone of life itself must be destroyed
  to wear away a line."</p>

  <p>"Benevolence!" pleaded the maiden, who had not expected to be involved in
  so abrupt and emotional an arisement. "The one for whom I crave your
  countenance--"</p>

  <p>"The fault lay with that hoary soothsayer," continued Ching-kwei, who was
  by no means concerned about Shen Che now that he had learned that this one
  was no longer she. "I described you beyond the possibility of doubt, and he
  then played me false."</p>

  <p>"Great majesty," murmured the bright vision, advancing more than the
  single step that the other had gone back, and gazing into Ching-kwei's eyes
  beseechingly, "by what feeble attributes did you chance to depict this
  in-no-way-striking one?"</p>

  <p>"How else than by the glory of your matchless presence, by the pearly
  splendour of your lustrous being, which at every point outshines that of all
  other dwellers upon earth, by the constant wonder of your deigning to remain
  among mere mortal things at all--there could be no mistake. Further, as the
  venerable necromancer's polite attention seemed to begin to wander at this
  point, I added that you wore a high-born cloak, your sister having none."</p>

  <p>"In this then, not the hermit but the very fates themselves have conspired
  toward a surreptitious end," exclaimed the one henceforth to be described as
  Mei. "Know now, all-powerful chief, that until we left the pious Ng-tung's
  cell, it was the more-admired Shen Che who wore that distressing cloak of
  plaited straw, which presently, to dance for joy at what the seer foretold,
  she cast about my form."</p>

  <p>"Then you indeed are not a queen, nor married to a king?"</p>

  <p>"I am married to none," replied Mei, indicating by a refined gesture that
  a contingency had been reached when it would be more suitable if she replaced
  the concealing mask, but to this Ching-kwei did not accede. "Nor am I likely
  now to encounter so forlorn an end, for the divination ran that my destiny
  lay with a guileless one who herded goats and led a tranquil life. Thus I
  stand secure, for such a man could not be found in camps or capitals."</p>

  <p>"Yet I have herded goats and led a tranquil life," maintained Ching-kwei.
  "So that in me the prophecy takes root."</p>

  <p>"But can never come to fruit, esteemed, for from that life you have cut
  yourself irrevocably away, while to it I must straight return, like a homing
  swallow to its ingrained thatch."</p>

  <p>"Would you not instead become a queen, fair Mei, and found with me an
  undying line of kings?"</p>

  <p>"Against that I am sworn. One queen from the inglorious house of Kang
  exceeds the moral limit, and having marked that same one's upward flight, I
  trim my own wings now into a lowlier atmosphere."</p>

  <p>"Why, then, I also would not be a king," declared Ching-kwei, approaching
  her. "And yet," he added gloomily, "the iron line remains--to 'end a
  sovereign's life and by the same act terminate a dynasty,' was the unbending
  fate. How else than by setting up my own?"</p>

  <p>"Ching-kwei," exclaimed a stern voice from the door, as Wang Tae threw
  back the fold, "what note of doubt is this? The day is ours, gained by your
  stratagem. Shang and Wen-yi have both made full submission and recognized
  your claim. The army of the 'Restoring Ying' only awaits the sight of you to
  raise an overwhelming shout of triumph and to carry you upon the impulse of
  its valour to any misty height. This is the very apex of your destiny, but
  though the point is here for you to grasp, the sides are smooth and steep.
  Fail to assert your right at once and all may yet be lost. Miscarry now, and
  you end your sovereign life and by that act now and for all time terminate
  the dynasty of your imperishable Line."</p>

  <p>For such a space of time as wherein one might count a score the three
  chiefly concerned stood in their different moods. Then Ching-kwei answered
  back, and his voice rolled like a ceremonial drum.</p>

  <p>"There spoke the several voices that conjoin in me to piece my destiny and
  to reconcile all things! This is the kingship that I put an end to now and
  ours the dynasty which I thereby terminate. Wang Tae, your words have been
  inspired and you at last have cut the knot of all my difficulty."</p>

  <p>"Yet what remains?" demanded Wang Tae darkly. "Can the people be left to
  revert to savagery, and Tsun, deprived of every royal hand, become a vassal
  state?"</p>

  <p>"Still less so than before. Tomorrow, in the Temple of the King within the
  Capital, Ching-kwei will voluntarily abdicate, and turning to his right will
  crown Wang Tae first of a martial Line. That is what Tsun requires today-- a
  strong and vigorous ruler of natural force, not one whose kingdom is a dream
  and his chosen throne a chimney-seat."</p>

  <p>"This is what generally happens sooner or later when a capable general and
  a weak-minded sovereign are concerned," declared Wang Tae, not wholly
  reconciled, "but in our exceptional case I certainly did not expect it yet."
  Then, as he turned to leave the tent, Ching-kwei unsheathed his sword, and
  raising it before his face he very gladly cried: "Ten thousand years!"</p>

  <p>"Yet what remains?" repeated Mei, as they again stood there alone. "You
  have lost all, nobility, and for--for a vagarious thought renounced a
  jewelled crown."</p>

  <p>"Not all," replied Ching-kwei; "I still have what I value most," and from
  an inner sleeve he took some faded flowers. "These I have kept unharmed
  through the dust of weary marches and the shock of furious battle, hoping
  perchance that if I bore them worthily, when we should meet, you of your own
  free will might requite me for everything with one."</p>

  <p>"One is a very little to expect, high prince," said Mei, turning away her
  face as she received the flowers, "though certainly more might seem to be too
  much. Therefore the two I offer you are now but one, and the one that you
  receive has hitherto been two," and in a tumult Ching-kwei perceived that in
  the hand held out to him were two stems tightly bound together by the crimson
  thread of mutual betrothement. "What more," she continued with a still
  averted face, "what more can one to whom all initiative is rigidly denied
  say--or even do--Ching-kwei?"</p>

  <p>As Ching-kwei, leading Mei by the hand and at the same time controlling a
  wandering goat of his own flock that he had recovered by the way, neared his
  door, his grandmother came out to gather wood and, seeing them, awaited their
  approach.</p>

  <p>"What is the latest apophthegm from the front just now, Ching-kwei?" she
  asked. "And how does this new gear of martial glory fit about your
  limbs?"</p>

  <p>"Those who cover themselves with martial glory appreciate a homespun robe
  at last," was his reply; yet even as he spoke the thought went up: "Wang Tae
  would certainly have produced something more keen-edged than that."</p>

  <p>"At all events, the maiden whom you sought has found you, it appears,"
  remarked the ancient, nodding sagely. "Perhaps it was as well that you should
  have returned--another goat has cast off his allegiance and gone hence upon
  us."</p>

  <p>When Kai Lung, having thus successfully disposed of Ching-kwei, looked up,
  he discovered he was there alone, not even one of three whom he daily
  instructed in his art having lingered.</p>

  <p>"It is doubtful if circles were quite so destitute of true refinement in
  the golden days of Tou-fou and Li-tai-pe," he murmured; "though the
  comparison is admittedly vainglorious. What call is that?"</p>

  <p>It was the voice of Hwa-mei, seeking him in the darkness of the garden,
  and as Kai Lung went at once toward her, they very soon encountered.</p>

  <p>"There were nine of our neighbours here with me but now, to whom I owe
  some reparation," he explained. "In the nature of analogy I pressed sour
  fruit upon them, so that now I would offer them both food and wine. Are they,
  perchance, awaiting me within?"</p>

  <p>"There are none within, neither have there been any with thee here in the
  garden, save only Hoo Tee, who has already tasted bamboo for leaving thee
  alone, musing by the arbour. Hast thou slept again, O dragon-hearted one, and
  dreamed a dream of ancient valour?"</p>

  <p>"I may have mused somewhat," confessed Kai Lung, "as I sat there by the
  arbour. But I can hardly, as you say, have slept, for a Bringer of Good News
  has sought me with a message."</p>

  <p>"Truly so," replied Hwa-mei, with a ripple in her voice of both laughter
  and affection. "Your evening rice awaits you."</p>
