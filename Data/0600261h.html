  <h2><a id="pro"
     name="pro">PROLOGUE&mdash;DEALING IN DRAWERS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Before hoisting them over his sturdy, ecclesiastical shanks
  the Bishop contemplated his drawers with nonsectarian satisfaction. It was
  not the Bishop's wont thus to dally with his drawers. Far from it. As a rule
  the Bishop paid scant heed either to his own drawers or to those of his
  parishioners. He took it for granted they wore them.</p>

  <p>And although, during the course of a long and active career devoted to
  good works, the Bishop had been responsible for despoiling the dusky limbs of
  innumerable South Sea aristocrats with drawers of surpassing unloveliness, he
  did not look back on his success in terms of drawers alone. Not at all.</p>

  <p>To Bishop Waller drawers were merely the first move in a long, grim
  contest with the devil, a contest in which long, grim drawers served as the
  shock troops of righteousness. They were an important but unattractive
  gesture in the general direction of God&mdash;a grotesque but essential step
  in a complicated ritual of spiritual costuming.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was partly owing to the fact that none of the Bishop's so-
  called savage converts had ever turned to him and remarked in tones of mild
  complaint, 'This Adam chap of yours never wore a pair of drawers in his life.
  Why should I?' that the good Bishop had so far failed to give due
  consideration to the rights of the vast anti-drawers-wearing element still
  shamelessly thriving on this and probably other terrestrial globes. For
  Bishop Waller was above all things a fair man. It simply never occurred to
  him that a fellow creature could commune either with himself or his Maker
  with any degree of equanimity unless a great deal of his person was securely
  done into drawers.</p>

  <p>For women the Bishop's program was a little more elaborate. Women were
  quite different. It was difficult to decide which half of their bodies needed
  to be covered first and most. Both halves were dangerous, both to be greatly
  deplored. Either one of them made virtually impossible a constructive
  consideration of a life beyond. Repeatedly he had been pained to discover
  that in the presence of unconverted island girls, men were quite content to
  risk the somewhat nebulous joys of the life beyond for the assured ones
  closer at hand.</p>

  <p>Therefore it was the Bishop's conviction that all women should be covered
  at all times. It was safer&mdash;far, far wiser. Men found out about such
  things quickly enough as it was without having them dangled before their
  eyes. For this reason religion for men began with drawers and for women with
  shirt and drawers&mdash;preferably with the addition of a voluminous Mother
  Hubbard.</p>

  <p>This morning there was a special reason for the Bishop's rapt
  contemplation of his drawers&mdash;new, judiciously selected, upstanding
  garments. And if they could not be called things of beauty, these brave long
  jaegers of the Bishop's, they did without question represent the highest
  expression of the drawers-maker's craftsmanship. Not that the Bishop's
  jaegers were in any sense crafty. No franker or more uncompromising drawers
  could have been devised to protect the modesty of man. Once they had been
  decorously adjusted, they made absolutely no weak concession to the curiously
  roving eye.</p>

  <p>As Bishop Waller, forgetting for the moment his rather shocking condition,
  held his jaegers extended before him at arm's length, he presented a picture
  of innocently happy concentration. He was gratified by the chaste austerity
  of these drawers. They were the ideal drawers for a bishop. There was no
  monkey business about them. They pretended to be nothing more than what they
  were&mdash;simply and definitely drawers&mdash;long ones. Once a man had
  sought refuge behind or within their rugged embrace there was little
  likelihood that any woman, no matter how optimistic, would ask him to emerge
  from his unattractive concealment. The exterior view was far too depressing
  &mdash;too utterly discouraging to light dalliance and abandon. They had a
  numbing effect on the mind, those jaegers of the Bishop's. They reared
  themselves like a mighty tower of righteousness in a world of makeshift and
  evasive garments. No one could imagine their wearer leaping sportively in
  pursuit of a wanton nymph. The very beasts of the fields would have staggered
  off in horror to their lairs.</p>

  <p>As he proceeded to plunge his vast nakedness into the even vaster reaches
  of his jaegers, the exact structure of the Bishop's thoughts is, of course,
  not known. However, it is safe to assume that as he stood appreciatively
  before his mirror conscientiously adjusting them to the last strategically
  plotted button&mdash;a formality seldom if ever observed by the average run
  of laymen&mdash;Bishop Waller was saying to himself:</p>

  <p>'I might have my faults as a bishop, but no one can say a word against my
  drawers. Not a bishop in all these United States can produce a finer pair
  than these.'</p>

  <p>So much for the Bishop for the time being, now that he has at last got
  himself into his drawers and girded his loins with righteousness if not with
  romance.</p><br>

  <h3>2</h3>

  <p>The drawers of Josephine Duval were a different matter entirely.
  Accurately speaking, they were hardly drawers at all. They were more like a
  passing thought or an idle moment. Compared with the splendid new jaegers of
  the Bishop's&mdash;if one's chances of salvation will not be eternally damned
  by such a sacrilege&mdash;Jo's drawers were as nothing. Not even a flash in
  the pan.</p>

  <p>One is occasionally perplexed by the great quantity of different-looking
  dogs one meets in the course of a day or a week. One is given pause by the
  fact that such totally unrelated objects in appearance should be even loosely
  classified under the covering name of dog. Yet in spite of this, one seldom
  or rarely ever stops to consider how many different-looking drawers there are
  in the world either gracing or disgracing the limbs of humanity. Perhaps this
  is due to the fact that one gets more opportunity to look at dogs than at
  drawers, which is, no doubt, just as well for everybody concerned. However,
  the fact still remains that drawers can be so bewilderingly different and yet
  come under the general classification or family name of drawers.</p>

  <p>Between the Bishop's drawers and Jo's drawers lay all the difference in
  the world&mdash;different aims and aspirations, a different philosophy of
  life&mdash;a gulf, in fact, which could never be bridged except under the
  most incredible circumstances with which there is no occasion here to deal.
  No good end can be served by further prolonging this rather questionable
  comparison.</p>

  <p>Looking logically at Jo's drawers&mdash;an attitude exceedingly difficult
  to maintain when they were inhabited as only Jo could inhabit them &mdash;one
  could see no proper reason for their being in existence at all. To say that
  they were the direct antitheses of the medieval <i>ceinture de chasteté</i>
  is to state the case mildly. Not that this brief consideration of the young
  lady's even briefer garments is to be regarded as a plea for the return of
  the chastity belt. On the contrary. There are too many locks already in this
  world. As a matter of record the efficacy of the chastity belt has never been
  clearly established. Love has ever had the last laugh on the locksmith.
  Furthermore, the belief is now held by several eminent students of the
  question that the employment of the chastity belt was directly responsible
  for the rapid rise of a class of gentlemen extremely annoying to absent
  husbands because of their nimble and industrious fingers. As time passed and
  experience was passed along with it, respectable husbands found that not only
  were their women no longer secure but also neither were their treasure boxes
  and safe deposit vaults. This situation was just too bad. During foreign wars
  and crusades the activities of these notoriously home-loving pick-locks
  became so wide-spread, in fact so much in demand, that medieval lock-smiths
  grew quite inured to the sound of ironical laughter.</p>

  <p>But if conditions were loose in those days, they are running wild to day.
  The time when women selected their nether garments logically has long since
  passed into oblivion. It is the regrettable tendency of the times for women
  to regard this item of their apparel not in the light of logic but rather in
  that of allurement. And men are just low enough to regard this change with
  approval. Even the name itself has fallen into disrepute, as if it suggested
  some humorous connotation. Whereas men with the utmost indifference still
  struggle along quite cheerfully with the old-fashioned and time-honored name
  of drawers&mdash;drawers plain and unvarnished&mdash;women have far
  out-stripped them. Theirs must be known now by such frivolous and leading
  appellations as panties, scanties, briefs, fleshies, woolies, step-ins,
  dansettes, speedies, and other similar evocative terms. Bloomers, which at
  one time were considered no end daring, are to-day rarely if ever encountered
  in actual circulation, and then only after the most patient and exhaustive
  research for which the majority of men are constitutionally disqualified
  unless very carefully watched.</p>

  <p>However, although these new underthings give rise to all sorts of
  nonsense, it must be admitted they are nice.</p>

  <p>Jo's were, at any rate.</p>

  <p>This morning, at about the same time the excellent Bishop was
  contemplating his equally excellent jaegers, Miss Josephine Duval, whose
  paternal grandmother still sipped her wine in France, rolled a body of the
  most disconcerting loveliness out of its bed. It was Jo's own body, and she
  sat with it in lazy companionship on the bed's edge while she permitted
  several tremendous yawns to escape her recklessly red and rebellious lips.
  After this she stretched, and the effect was devastating. For a moment even
  the world must have paused in its revolutions. As the girl's small and not
  unbecoming feet sought with all their ten useless toes a pair of mules that
  were a sheer waste of time, her cool white arm automatically reached out and
  the hand on the end of it affixed itself to one of the garments under
  discussion. Whether they were briefs, scanties, or step-ins is an open
  question, but for the sake of this history they might just as well be called
  step-ins. Bending a dark red head of tousled hair over her trophy, she
  allowed her brown eyes to consider it none too favorably.</p>

  <p>They were far from being the step-ins of her choice. However, many a girl
  would have thought herself fortunate to have been caught in a gale in such a
  pair. In a nutshell, which would nearly have accommodated them, they were
  good, middle-class business-like looking step-ins without a great deal of
  foolishness about them, yet sufficiently attractive to do justice to their
  subject. Josephine's French blood cried for fairer step-ins, while her French
  sense of thrift assured her that for a hard-working secretary who spent most
  of her time sitting they were altogether adequate.</p>

  <p>'If I didn't have to work so darned hard and scrimp so much,' yawned Jo to
  herself, 'I'd buy me some bang-up underthings, wouldn't I just. Regular
  knockouts. Black and very, very bad.'</p>

  <p>With a supple flexing of her body which should have been prohibited by an
  act of Congress, she shook off her nightgown and snapped on her step-ins. The
  movement combined the speed of a fireman with the deftness of a
  contortionist. Catching a glimpse of herself in the mirror, she regarded her
  step-ins critically.</p>

  <p>'Good enough for day-in-and-day-out service,' she decided, 'but hardly
  suitable for occasions should they ever arise.'</p>

  <p>To what occasions Jo was alluding, it would be better to leave to
  individual preference. Jo had her own clearly defined ideas about almost
  everything. For the most part they were uniformly unedifying. However, they
  enjoyed the advantage of having been dragged out into the open, where they
  operated in a state of healthy activity, to say the least.</p>

  <p>'Pay day to-day,' she gloated as she continued with her dressing. 'A
  beggarly sum at that&mdash;a mere pittance. I'll spend it all on underthings
  as soon as the office closes, see if I don't. Even though a girl should be
  good, she doesn't have to feel that way. Funny thing, I always feel at my
  best when I'm feeling thoroughly depraved. There's no use of a girl trying to
  tell herself anything different, either. Women are born that way.'</p>

  <p>Accordingly her thoughts veered to Mr. Peter Duane Van Dyck, who at that
  moment was very busy doing things about his own drawers, as were thousands of
  other New Yorkers of high and low degree.</p>

  <p>Peter Van Dyck was of high. He scarcely realized the fact, and whenever it
  was forced upon him by his relatives he showed a decided lack of
  appreciation. His respect for the traditions of his ancestors, those early
  Dutch settlers, had been interred with their bones. He was Josephine's
  employer&mdash;her boss. She was his secretary, and it would not have
  required much enterprise on his part to make her even more. As it was, he
  admired the young lady for her efficiency, but was alarmed by her bold eyes,
  which to his way of thinking had a suspiciously bad look about them. They
  were not good for the coffee business, whose destiny he guided along
  well-established lines.</p>

  <p>'He's an old stick,' Jo decided as she tightened up her stockings so that
  they gleamed on her well-turned legs. 'Doesn't seem to know I have these. Not
  an eye in his stupid head. I'll make him know, doggone it.'</p>

  <p>And Jo deftly curbed her abundance within the delicate web of a brazen
  brassiere.</p><br>

  <h3>3</h3>

  <p>To Peter Duane Van Dyck drawers presented no difficulty. He never
  considered them at all. They were merely a part of the scheme of things. He
  disregarded drawers. Automatically he changed them. Not every day, like other
  nice men of his station, but whenever the idea occurred to him. Sometimes he
  lost his drawers; that is, misplaced them, forgot where he had seen them
  last.</p>

  <p>This morning he was in this quandary. With exasperated diligence he
  searched for his drawers, completely blind to the fact that he had lazily
  left them crumpled in his trousers upon retiring the previous night. It was
  not a Van Dyck trait, this leaving of his drawers in his trousers. It was a
  habit characteristic of Peter&mdash;one of his little labor-saving devices
  which would have been revolting to the long line of Van Dycks from which he
  had sprung without any great show of agility.</p>

  <p>Abandoning all hope of ever seeing his drawers again, Peter put on a new
  pair and dragged on his trousers after them. The fact that the old pair
  remained untidily wedged in his trousers caused him no discomfort at the
  moment. He ascribed the slight fullness on the right side&mdash;a tendency to
  bind, as it were&mdash;to some inexplicable caprice of his shirt tail. He
  would deal with his shirt tail later if in the meantime it did not adjust
  itself of its own accord. Shirt tails usually did in the course of a day, he
  had found. He hoped this one would, because he hated to trouble himself with
  such matters. It would have been wiser had he done so.</p>

  <p>He did things to his sandy-colored hair, decided after a quick scrutiny of
  his vaguely blue eyes that they had a peculiarly harassed appearance, wiped
  some dried soap off his right ear, and left the room wearing two pairs of
  drawers and carrying one towel. On the Van Dyck landing he became conscious
  of the towel still clutched in his hand. Draping it over the bare expanse of
  a statue of an Aphrodite seemingly seized with qualms or cramps in a near-by
  niche, Peter Van Dyck permitted his five feet ten inches of body to find its
  way downstairs unassisted by any mental effort.</p>

  <p>He entertained hopes of filling it with coffee and lots of breakfast.
  Peter was thirty-four. Also, he was hungry.</p><br>

  <h3>4</h3>

  <p>An hour or so later it was Miss Yolanda Bates Wilmont's turn to deal with
  her drawers. Rightly speaking, Yolanda Bates Wilmont seldom if ever dealt
  with her drawers in person. She had a maid to deal with them for her. And to
  continue rightly speaking, what the maid dealt with could not by the wildest
  stretch of the coarsest imagination be called drawers. They were creations
  &mdash;fragile poems done in gossamer and lace&mdash;real lace. In fact
  everything was real about them except the woman they adorned. She was too
  good to be true, but she did not realize this. She considered herself a young
  lady of the highest principles and the most unassailable morals. With the
  exception of herself and a few chosen members of her social standing she
  heartily disapproved of any unnecessary display of feminine blandishments.
  With herself it was quite different. Yolanda Bates Wilmont sincerely believed
  that she knew as no other woman exactly what she was doing, that she was by
  the divine right of birth the arbiter of good taste and refinement, that she
  had limbs whereas the general run of girls merely had legs and far too much
  of them.</p>

  <p>As she gazed at herself in the long pier mirror this morning, she was
  thinking quite unconsciously that it was a fortunate thing indeed so few
  girls could afford to wear such lovely step-ins as hers. The average woman
  could not be trusted in so expensively chic underthings. No telling what one
  of those lower-class girls might do if she suddenly found herself in
  possession of such a pair. Certainly she would not keep them to herself. No.
  The cheap, feminine display complex would get the better of what little
  scruples she had, if any. The modern girl was permitted to show too much of
  herself as it was. Take the beaches and the buses and the dance halls&mdash;
  disgusting. Such liberties should be enjoyed only by members of exclusive
  house parties and by girls who knew how to be careless without being common
  &mdash;girls whose reputation needed no protection. The same held for
  drinking and all the other amenities of life. Her one regret was that when
  she should marry Peter Van Dyck, as had been ordained from the beginning of
  time, she could not have her baby in a different and hitherto unattempted
  manner. In a fleece-lined capsule, for instance, or a handsomely tailored
  cowl. The usual way was far too popular.</p>

  <p>After the maid had done every possible thing for her except think and
  breathe, Yolanda allowed herself to be helped into a ravishing negligee. This
  was negligent to the point of aggressive indecency, but was perfectly all
  right on Yolanda because she was so utterly different from other women,
  although, from the various samples of herself she so generously displayed,
  the untutored eye would have gained the impression that she was made very
  much in accordance with the usual specifications.</p>

  <p>Also the eye&mdash;even the untutored one&mdash;would have gained the
  impression that these specifications had been most skillfully carried out.
  Yolanda was a good-looking girl, well built, attractively colored, and
  perfectly finished. There were deep blue eyes, fine golden hair, vivid lips,
  and a healthy outer layer of pink and white satin-smooth skin.</p>

  <p>Yet beneath the outer layer Yolanda was exactly like every other woman who
  had ever entertained the illusion that she was different from all of her
  sisters. Nor would Yolanda's highly refined reactions have been especially
  cordial had any one taken the trouble to supply her with this gratuitous
  piece of information.</p>

  <p>No one ever did.</p><br>

  <h3>5</h3>

  <p>In quite another quarter of the city Aspirin Liz heaved her generous bulk
  out of bed and wearily dragged a pair of tent-like bloomers over enough body
  to make two of Yolanda's.</p>

  <p>Grunting comfortably as she reached for the kettle sequestered in a dark
  closet, she proceeded to make herself some coffee. Also she found time to
  take a couple of aspirins, for which she was well named. These little duties
  being performed, and a shirt and flowered dressing-gown added to her
  toilette, she collapsed in a chair and gloomily considered a hole that had
  but recently appeared in her bloomers. True, they were old bloomers, but
  still that hole had no right to be where it was. And it was not the first
  time either.</p>

  <p>As Aspirin Liz regarded this new evidence of the bloomers' unworthiness,
  her heart was filled with bitterness and indignation against the low lives
  who had made the bloomers as well as the dirty dogs who had tricked her into
  buying them.</p>

  <p>'Never put enough reinforcement into the damn things,' she grumbled to
  herself, little realizing that hers was a figure that demanded more in the
  line of reinforcement than either the looms or sewing machines could
  profitably afford to supply. ' Always busting out in a fresh spot like one of
  those all-fired Holland dykes.'</p>

  <p>Idly her mind drifted back through the years until she saw again a small
  boy thrusting some part of his body through a hole in a dike. Just what part
  of his body it was remained a little vague to Aspirin Liz, but she was
  reasonably sure it was either an arm or a leg or a foot. It might even have
  been a finger to begin with, and later on an arm. She knew the little boy had
  not stuck his head through the hole, because her own common sense, of which
  she had a lot, convinced her that no little boy could have been as big a damn
  fool as all that.</p>

  <p>She had always liked that story as a child. Game little beggar, that boy.
  As she had progressed through life, she had kept her eyes peeled for such a
  youth but had never come across one, although she had met many who had played
  games, and not very nice games at that. Even then they had cheated.</p>

  <p>There was hardly anything Aspirin Liz did not know about men, and even
  less to their credit. They drank and cursed and treated women like hell and
  left the place all messed up. The more work you did for a man, the more
  things he could think up for you to do. If God had only made men more like
  animals, more like dogs, for instance, without any too much brains, things
  would be a great deal easier for women. But unfortunately men had brains,
  mean, bad-acting brains that kept interfering with the business of living.
  Women could handle their bodies all right, but the devil himself could not
  deal with a man's brains.</p>

  <p>Aspirin Liz picked up last night's newspaper and broodingly considered a
  salaciously illustrated underwear advertisement.</p>

  <p>'Wouldn't have lasted a minute in my day,' she told herself as she studied
  the delicate lines of a pair of step-ins. 'Yanked 'em clean off you, they
  would. Nowadays everything's so fancy. Didn't need all that nonsense when I
  was a girl. God knows nothing could have been more discouraging than those
  long, dangling, iron-clad, rock-girt flannels I grew up in, yet everybody
  seemed to do pretty well in spite of 'em. Drawers were drawers in those days.
  And when you took 'em off you knew you had 'em off. No two ways about it. Now
  take these makeshift bloomers...'</p>

  <p>It does not really matter where Aspirin Liz took her makeshift bloomers.
  She was always taking them some-where. This morning, as on every morning, she
  had a bit of a headache. Perhaps a spot of gin would help. She took one. If
  it did not help her head it did at least make her solitary existence a little
  more endurable. Another cup of coffee and a fag. Liz yawned and stretched her
  heavy frame.</p>

  <p>Once she had been an artist's model and very much in demand, very much in
  the front of things. Now...oh, hell, a woman couldn't keep her figure always.
  Use it while you have it and then forget it. So said Liz.</p>

  <p>But she could never quite forget the figure of her hey-day, for what it
  had once been was still hanging in several New York galleries she
  occasionally visited when all other comforts failed.</p>

  <p>'Got to find a needle and thread,' muttered Aspirin Liz, 'and do something
  about these bloomers before the whole damn dike pours through. Game little
  nipper, that kid was. Must have been his leg.'</p><br>

  <h3>6</h3>

  <p>When Little Arthur exhumed himself from a disorderly pile of bedclothing
  and stood up, one of New York's most astute pickpockets was once more on his
  feet. But unlike Mr. Peter Duane Van Dyck, Little Arthur did not have to look
  for his drawers. He already had them on. Little Arthur had slept in his
  drawers, as was his invariable rule.</p>

  <p>Gentlemen devoted to Little Arthur's profession frequently find it the
  wisest policy to sleep that way. Even a pickpocket has some qualms about
  making a surreptitious exit when clad only in nothing. The criminal classes
  are notoriously more modest, more observant of the little niceties of
  convention than those who remain smugly within the boundaries of the law.
  Little Arthur would have willingly faced arrest and long detention rather
  than to have presented an unadorned rear view to a callously jeering group of
  pursuing Irish minions of the law.</p>

  <p>Yet even though Little Arthur habitually slept in his drawers, he was not
  altogether unmindful of them. This morning as he moved round his room he was
  thinking in a dim way about the state and efficacy of the miserably shabby
  garments he was wearing. They were unpicturesque, to say the least. Little
  Arthur felt they did not do him justice. The things he had on had never been
  intended to do any man justice. However, they were amusing, assuming one
  recovered from the shock of seeing them in action.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless those drawers meant everything to their wearer. That is
  literally the truth. Yet, truthfully speaking, they were not drawers at all.
  They were a complete costume, a sort of overall arrangement that concealed
  the facts about Little Arthur from his scraggy neck to his pipe-stem ankles.
  A visitor from Mars would have found it difficult to believe that the body
  within was human.</p>

  <p>However, the parts of Little Arthur that one was permitted to see were not
  entirely unprepossessing. He had a brisk little face, hardly any hair to
  speak of, and a devouringly alert pair of mild blue eyes. Frequently Little
  Arthur took those eyes to the movies, where they wept copiously over the sad
  parts and sparkled with pleasure when virtue triumphed and won its own
  reward.</p>

  <p>Little Arthur's thoughts were now toying with the subject of drawers. He
  was discontented with his present ones. He felt that he deserved a new
  deal.</p>

  <p>'Can't very well snatch a pair of drawers off a customer's legs,' he
  regretfully observed to himself. 'Funny thing, that. Easier to steal a man's
  purse than his drawers.'</p>

  <p>Second-storey men were lucky. They could steal all the drawers they needed
  &mdash;more drawers, in fact, than a man could reasonably use, although
  second-storey work probably was exceedingly trying on drawers. Take a
  pickpocket now. A pickpocket was by the very nature of his calling entirely
  cut off from drawers as a source of loot. Oh, well, a dip should not expect
  to have everything. He was better off as he was. Climbing had always made him
  dizzy even as a boy. A man should stick to the job he was best fitted for
  instead of drifting from pillar to post. Never establish yourself that way.
  Little Arthur felt grieved over the fate of rolling stones. If he had a good
  day to-day, Little Arthur promised his legs a new pair of drawers.</p>

  <p>With this promise in mind the weird-looking little man retrieved a last
  night's edition of the morning's paper from the floor and ran a professional
  eye over the list of public events.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap1"
     name="chap1">1. AN EMBARRASSING SITUATION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Van Dyck coffee had been responsible for keeping more
  generations of New Yorkers awake than had the product of any other importer
  in lower Manhattan. In the early days of the company's activities the Van
  Dycks had endeavored to popularize the beverage among various tribes of the
  less homicidally inclined Indians. However, finding that these original
  Americans seemed to prefer gin almost as avidly as Americans do to-day, the
  cannily hospitable old Dutchmen promptly broke out the square bottles and
  prospered greatly thereby.</p>

  <p>With this phase of the business the current generation of Van Dycks
  habitually dealt with commendable vagueness. Inasmuch as the Van Dycks had
  been fairly respectable even before they took up the New World in a big way,
  it never occurred to their descendants that their present exalted state was
  established on the hang-overs of a great multitude of red men.</p>

  <p>Peter Van Dyck knew far less about coffee than had any of his
  predecessors. He was somewhat less backward where gin was concerned. Peter
  found it difficult to break himself of the habit of regarding coffee in the
  light of a personal indulgence rather than as a commercial asset. Some
  mornings it tasted better than others. That was about the extent of Peter's
  knowledge. This morning, he decided, it did not taste so good.</p>

  <p>As he left his house in the West Seventies he was wondering vaguely why
  his eyes had such a harassed expression and his coffee such a comfortless
  flavor. The season of the year was propitious&mdash;late spring with summer
  lounging among the buds. Business not too bad when compared with that of his
  competitors. As a matter of fact, the morning paper had announced the
  untimely end of one of his closest rivals, yet even this gratifying
  occurrence failed to lend zest to Peter's day. Something was radically wrong
  with him.</p>

  <p>Then, suddenly, a thought rose bleakly from his sub-conscious mind and
  flopped down heavily on his conscious one, where it lay like a dead weight.
  This afternoon his Aunt Sophie, his statuesque and painfully modern Aunt
  Sophie who presided over his household, was giving a cocktail party for
  Yolanda Bates Wilmont. And at this party the cat which had long since been
  out of the bag was obligingly going to crawl back into it again to permit
  itself to be officially released. After to-day he, Peter, would no longer be
  a free lance in the courts of light dalliance. He would be irrevocably
  engaged to Yolanda with all her beauty and wealth and firmly rooted
  convictions. This knowledge somehow failed even more lamentably than had the
  sudden departure of his business rival to add zest to Peter's day. Yes, there
  was no doubt about it. Something was radically wrong with him. His responsive
  faculties seemed to have become strangely atrophied by the thought of life
  and Yolanda Wilmont.</p>

  <p>For a few brief moments Peter's troubled blue eyes dwelt on the lines of a
  well-formed girl sitting opposite him in the downtown subway express. Little
  suspecting the highly improper trend of his thoughts, Peter felt that he
  would like to lie down quietly somewhere with that girl and talk the
  situation over. He felt the need of a female confessor as well as
  entertainer. There had been too few women in his life. With a sense of panic
  he began to realize this as the imminence of his official betrothal
  confronted him. Quickly he averted his eyes. The girl was chewing gum. This
  girl, in spite of her lines, was definitely out of the picture. Well, was not
  life exactly like that? At its most alluring moments it suddenly began to
  chew gum in one's face. Revolted, Peter shrank slightly and returned to his
  paper.</p>

  <p>It was not until he had reached the seclusion of his private office that
  the extra pair of drawers he was unconsciously wearing began to manifest
  themselves. Even then he was not aware of the exact nature of his
  difficulties. He experienced merely a sense of unwonted fullness&mdash;a
  growing sensation of insecurity. Suddenly, however, as the drawers gathered
  headway his alarm and discomfort became acute. In his anxiety forgetting that
  his office though private was not quite impenetrable, Peter allowed his
  trousers to descend several inches, the better to deal with the perplexing
  situation.</p>

  <p>Miss Josephine Duval, armed with the morning mail, entered the room
  quietly and closed the door behind her. For a moment she allowed her cool but
  curious gaze to dwell on the orange and black stripes decorating all that
  could be seen of the southern exposure of Mr. Peter Van Dyck's shorts.</p>

  <p>'Looks like summer awnings,' she observed more to herself than to her
  employer. 'And to think I never suspected!'</p>

  <p>With a low moan of distress Peter's body went into a huddle as only a body
  can when plunged into such a situation.</p>

  <p>'Haven't you got sense enough to get out!' he demanded, twisting a
  strained but indignant face over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>'I have the sense, but not the power,' Miss Duval retorted calmly. 'Your
  condition has robbed me of that.' 'For God's sake,' the man almost chattered,
  'hurry! suppose some one should come in and find you here?'</p>

  <p>'I'm all right,' said Miss Duval. 'It's you who would give rise to
  comment.'</p>

  <p>Something was slipping farther and farther down the right leg of Peter's
  trousers, slipping stealthily but relentlessly to the floor. And the trouble
  was that Peter, not suspecting the presence of a stowaway, visualized the
  worst. What a fearful picture he must be presenting from the rear, yet the
  front view would not improve matters any. How could such a demeaning thing
  happen to a man in this day and age?</p>

  <p>'Won't you please go way?' he asked in an agitated voice. 'What would
  people think?'</p>

  <p>'Well,' replied Jo with dispassionate deliberation, 'from the trouble you
  seem to be having with your trousers, people might get the impression you'd
  asked me in here to watch you do tricks with your shorts.'</p>

  <p>'What's that!' exclaimed Peter, more upset by the girl's attitude than by
  her words. 'Oh, you're fired. There's no doubt about that. This time you're
  through for good.'</p>

  <p>'Do you realize that I could play a decidedly dirty trick!' Jo inquired
  lightly.</p>

  <p>'What do you mean!' asked Peter, his fingers furtively fumbling with
  various buttons.</p>

  <p>'If I should scream now &mdash;' began Jo, but was interrupted by Peter's
  heartfelt, 'Oh, my God!'</p>

  <p>'If I should begin to shout and rush about,' she continued, as if savoring
  the idea, 'there's not a jury in the world that wouldn't convict you of at
  least breach of promise.'</p>

  <p>'Swear to God I never knew there was such a woman in the world,' Peter Van
  Dyck replied in an emotional voice as if appealing to some unseen audience.
  'If you'll only go away and let me finish what I'm doing you'll not be
  fired.'</p>

  <p>'How about all this mail?' she demanded.</p>

  <p>'Am I in a condition to go into that now?'</p>

  <p>'I should say not,' said the girl. 'You don't know how awful you are.'</p>

  <p>'Then don't trouble to tell me. I can very well imagine.'</p>

  <p>'Before I go,' Josephine continued, placing the letters on the desk,
  'would you mind explaining what was in your mind when you got yourself into
  this terrible condition?'</p>

  <p>'I don't know,' Peter answered. ' And I fail to see how it's any of your
  business.'</p>

  <p>'Well, it's a sight a young lady doesn't see every day of her life,'
  replied Jo. 'Especially in an office building and at this time of day.'</p>

  <p>'I don't make a practice of it,' Peter retorted, with an attempt at
  dignity.</p>

  <p>'I wouldn't,' Miss Duval assured him. 'There's an unpleasant suggestion of
  senility about it. And by the way, if you're looking for an extra pair of
  drawers you'll find them sticking out of the right leg of your trousers.
  Although why you want two pairs I can't for the life of me understand. The
  ones you have on are giddy enough.'</p>

  <p>As the door closed quietly on his tormentor, Peter Van Dyck reached down,
  and, seizing the offending drawers, hurled them furiously in the general
  direction of the waste basket, upon the edge of which they sprawled
  unbecomingly.</p>

  <p>'Damn my absent mind,' he muttered, 'and damn that woman's impudence. What
  a decidedly unpleasant occurrence! She actually seemed to enjoy it. These
  modern girls ...'</p>

  <p>A few minutes later Jo briskly followed her perfunctory knock into the
  room and found her employer wearily seated at his desk. He was gloomily
  scanning a letter.</p>

  <p>'Oh,' exclaimed Miss Duval amicably. 'Quite an improvement. All tucked in,
  I see.'</p>

  <p>Before Peter had time to think up a fitting retort, William, the office
  handy-man, entered the room and cast about for something on which to exercise
  his talents. Spying the drawers dangling over the waste-paper basket, he held
  them aloft admiringly.</p>

  <p>'Fine pair o' drawers, these,' he observed in a conversational tone of
  voice. ' A real fancy pair. Begging your pardon, sir, but are they yours, Mr.
  Peter?'</p>

  <p>Mr. Peter preferred not to notice William's polite inquiry. Jo saw fit to
  bring it to his attention.</p>

  <p>'William wants to know,' she said in level tones as she seated herself in
  a chair with her dictation pad open on her knee, 'William is anxious to find
  out if those&mdash;if that florid object belongs to you.'</p>

  <p>'Tell him they don't,' Peter mumbled unhappily.</p>

  <p>'It would be more manly if you spoke of such things yourself,' the girl
  replied. 'However&mdash;he says they're not his, William.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I'd like to know how they got here, then,' William continued
  stubbornly. 'All spread out like that. They must be his.'</p>

  <p>If William had not emptied many a waste-paper basket for Peter's departed
  father, the man would have been fired on the spot. As it was, a friendship of
  many years now stood in serious danger of an open break.</p>

  <p>'Is there any reason why you should doubt my word about those drawers?'
  Peter asked the man coldly. 'Some one might have left them here as a
  sample.'</p>

  <p>At this William shook the drawers playfully and chuckled his
  incredulity.</p>

  <p>'Not these, Mr. Peter,' he declared. 'We're in the coffee business.'</p>

  <p>'Well, even coffee merchants are supposed to have some self-respect,'
  replied Peter.</p>

  <p>'Not the coffee merchant who wore these,' asserted William, with a wise
  shake of his head. 'Couldn't keep much self-respect in them things. They'd
  suit my Alf to a tee. He'd go crazy about them drawers with their funny
  little pink dots.'</p>

  <p>'I'll damn well go crazy myself if you don't get them out of my sight,'
  Peter assured his handy-man.</p>

  <p>'Yes, William,' put in Jo Duval. 'Why not take them through the office and
  inquire of the gentlemen if they have lost a pair? We might be able to find a
  home for them that way.'</p>

  <p>'No need to do that,' said Peter hurriedly. ' Take 'em home to Alf with my
  compliments. Do anything with them you like so long as you let me hear no
  more upon the subject. I'm completely exhausted by drawers.'</p>

  <p>'Thanks, Mr. Peter,' the grateful man replied, giving the garment a
  possessive flirt as he made his way to the door. ' As neat a little pair o'
  drawers as ever I laid eyes on. All full of funny pink spots, they are.'</p>

  <p>'William is getting old,' observed Peter Van Dyck, to break the pause
  following the man's departure. 'I'll have to lay him off with a pension one
  of these days.'</p>

  <p>'Wouldn't mind a little bit of that sort of thing myself,' replied Jo,
  carelessly crossing her legs and fixing her employer with a level gaze. 'Why
  don't you pension yourself off, for a change? You're not interested in
  business.'</p>

  <p>'What makes you say a thing like that?'</p>

  <p>'Well, obviously a man who has such playful ideas in drawers can hardly be
  expected to keep his mind on work.'</p>

  <p>'Is that so?' grumbled Peter. ' You've been with this company altogether
  too long. Take a couple of letters.'</p>

  <p>Jo indulged in a short but ironical laugh.</p>

  <p>'What's wrong now?' he asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p>'I was only thinking that while you're dictating letters to me,' she
  replied easily, 'William is probably exhibiting your disinherited drawers to
  the entire office force.'</p>

  <p>'Take a couple of letters, nevertheless,' said Peter Van Dyck, with
  characteristically Dutch stubbornness. 'Just because an old fool chooses to
  make a public display of a private affair, I can't leave the coffee business
  flat.'</p>

  <p>'What a man!' remarked Joe in a low, admiring voice.</p>

  <p>Once more he regarded her suspiciously.</p>

  <p>'How long have you been with us?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'Much longer than I expected to remain in a purely professional capacity,'
  she told him.</p>

  <p>'I very much doubt if you could remain long purely in any capacity,' said
  Peter, feeling a little set up by his unexpected burst of repartee.</p>

  <p>'Some girls might take that amiss,' said Jo, 'but I consider it a
  compliment. I didn't think you knew.'</p>

  <p>'Knew what?'</p>

  <p>'My attitude&mdash;my moral outlook.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, I don't know that,' he said hastily. 'And I don't want to find out.
  You take too many liberties as it is. If you hadn't been here already when I
  took over the reins, I'd have fired you on sight.'</p>

  <p>'And driven the business into a ditch,' Jo replied complacently. ' You
  haven't the foggiest idea where anything is&mdash;not even the most personal
  of things such as your &mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Don't let's go into that again,' he interrupted.</p>

  <p>'I have no desire to,' she assured him.</p>

  <p>But Peter Van Dyck was destined to take up the matter of drawers once more
  before it was definitely dropped. There was a scrambling noise outside the
  door, a nervous scraping on the glass partition, then the door flew open and
  Freddie, the small but aggressive office boy, excitedly waving the erstwhile
  drawers of his employer, hurried into the room with William close at his
  heels.</p>

  <p>'Beg your pardon, sir,' said Freddie, waving the spotted garment in the
  indignant William's face, 'but ain't these drawers yours? He says they're
  his. I saw you with my own eyes&mdash;you had 'em on one day when you were in
  the &mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Stop! Stop!' cried Peter Van Dyck in a stricken voice. 'And please close
  the door.'</p>

  <p>'Here's a go,' murmured Jo Duval. 'Those drawers seem to have a mind of
  their own.'</p>

  <p>Peter Van Dyck looked hatefully at her, then drummed distractedly on his
  desk. Once his glance strayed in the direction of the drawers. With an effort
  he averted his fascinated eyes. Finally he spoke. His voice was low and
  cultured. In it was a note of despair.</p>

  <p>'Freddie,' he said, 'those drawers are the property of William. They are
  his without let or hindrance&mdash;his irrevocably. Do you understand that,
  Freddie? Then hand those drawers back to William who I hope to God will put
  them in his pocket and take them home to Alf. If he doesn't I'm going to fire
  you all, and that includes you.' His eves burned with bitterness as he
  studied the expression of bland enjoyment on his secretary's face. His voice
  gathered volume. 'And as for you, Freddie, if you kept your eyes more on your
  business and less on other people's drawers you might grow up to be a coffee
  broker yourself some day.' He paused to consider his words. Somehow this
  rebuke of Freddie seemed to lack in strength what it gained in dignity. Once
  more his eyes were attracted to the drawers; then his dignity and
  self-control departed. He rose, spluttering. ' William,' he thundered, 'if
  you don't take those miserable drawers away I'll drag yours off your
  baggy-looking legs.'</p>

  <p>'No need to get personal,' Jo reminded the aroused man.</p>

  <p>'What!' cried Peter. 'I'd like to drag yours off, too.'</p>

  <p>'Thanks,' she answered. 'Hadn't you better ask the gentlemen to withdraw
  first?'</p>

  <p>'Oh!' said Peter as if stung to the quick. 'Oh, my God!' He sank back in
  his chair and held his forehead in his hands. 'That will be all about drawers
  for this morning,' he said at last. 'Please leave the room quietly with
  &mdash;with them. Don't bring them back.'</p>

  <p>When Freddie and William and the drawers had departed, silence reigned in
  the room. Peter looked wearily out of the window. He was considering whether
  it would not be simpler to hurl himself through it. The door opened and
  William thrust in an apologetic head.</p>

  <p>'Sorry, Mr. Peter,' he said. ' I kept telling young Freddie that just
  because he happened to see you yanking 'em up once it didn't mean you were
  going to wear 'em all the time. He hasn't gumption enough to know that a
  gentleman changes his &mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Can't you explain to William?' Peter interrupted, turning appealingly to
  Josephine. 'He doesn't seem to understand.'</p>

  <p>'William,' said the girl quietly, 'Mr. Van Dyck is too upset to hear any
  more about his drawers to-day.'</p>

  <p>'Ever,' put in Peter.</p>

  <p>'Yes, William,' Jo continued. ' Don't ever talk to Mr. Peter about his
  drawers again. Talk about something else&mdash;his socks, for instance.'</p>

  <p>Peter winced. His eyes were filled with disgust.'</p>

  <p>Thank you, miss,' said William. ' I'll try to remember. You said his
  socks, didn't you?'</p>

  <p>'yes,' replied Jo. 'His socks, although from his expression he doesn't
  seem so fond of those either.'</p>

  <p>'The door&mdash;the door!' grated Peter. 'Close it on your horrid face,
  William.' The door was closed.</p>

  <p>'Did you want to dictate a couple of letters?' Jo asked imperturbably.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' replied Peter. ' Take a couple of letters.' For some time he sat in
  gloomy concentration, then abandoned the effort. 'Oh, hell,' he said, 'I
  can't think of one letter, much less two.'</p>

  <p>'I'll answer them for you,' Jo assured him soothingly. 'You need a long
  rest.' She looked him over appraisingly. 'Wonder how Alf's going to look in
  those &mdash;'</p>

  <p>A strangling sound from Peter cut short her sentence.</p>

  <p>'Go!' he whispered, pointing to the door with a trembling finger. 'Get
  out! I don't give a damn how Alf looks.'</p>

  <p>'You should consult a doctor,' she told him as she prepared to leave the
  room. 'There's something preying on your mind. Do you drug, perhaps?'</p>

  <p>'Do I what!' demanded Peter.</p>

  <p>'Do you drug?' she answered simply.</p>

  <p>'No,' he replied confronting her, 'but I can still drag, and that's what
  I'll damn well do to you if you don't get out of here.'</p>

  <p>With a glance of deep commiseration Josephine gracefully left the room.
  The provocative fragrance of her perfume lingered in the air. Peter Van Dyck
  wondered why he did not discharge the girl. Little did he realize that her
  perfume was one of the reasons.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap2"
     name="chap2">2. ON A PARK BENCH</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Several hours after these undignified happenings Peter Van
  Dyck emerged from a restaurant in which he had been lone-wolfing, being able
  to think of no language fit for decent conversation. In the crowd outside the
  door Josephine Duval caught sight of his slim and dejected-looking shoulders.
  Without a moment's hesitation the young lady abandoned her window-shopping
  and blithely set off to dog the footsteps of her employer. Having snatched a
  glimpse of the girl out of the tail of his eye, Peter immediately divined her
  intention. This stalking procedure had occurred more than once. Accordingly
  he quickened his pace. Emphatically he assured himself he had seen quite
  enough of his secretary for one day. She was a creature totally lacking in
  either pride or pity. Several times he glanced back to ascertain if his
  dodging tactics had succeeded in eluding pursuit. Each time he was
  disappointed. Josephine was still there&mdash;grimly there. A most annoying
  situation. Disgraceful. Why was she making no effort to cut down the
  distance? Was it torture? Peter was seized by a nervous impulse to take to
  his heels and run. However, he checked himself, feeling convinced that Jo
  would have no compunction in doing likewise. She might even find it amusing
  to shout his name through the streets. Hang it all, what did the girl want
  with him, anyway? The street was littered with unattached men. Why did she
  not confine her attentions to one or more of them? He was an engaged man.
  Within a few short hours he would be a doubly engaged man. Officially hooked
  if not spliced. Vaguely he wondered whether he was endeavoring to elude
  Josephine or the thought of that engagement. He crossed over to Battery Park
  and sat down on a bench close to the water-front. The fragrance of Jo's
  perfume still lingered in his nostrils. Presently it grew stronger. He
  stirred restlessly. She was there.</p>

  <p>'You'll be late at the office,' he announced, without turning his
  head.</p>

  <p>'I'll say I was out with you,' said a small voice beside him. 'And I'll
  say you deliberately followed me through the streets of New York,' he told
  her.</p>

  <p>Would you like the office to know that?' asked Jo.</p>

  <p>'No. I would not.'</p>

  <p>'Then why not be friendly?'</p>

  <p>'I'm quite friendly enough for a person who wants to commit murder. In
  fact, I'm damned patient. Don't let's talk, then people won't suspect we know
  each other.'</p>

  <p>'Why won't they suspect?'</p>

  <p>'They'd never think that a person like me would talk to a girl like
  you.'</p>

  <p>Jo considered this insult judicially while swinging her small feet.</p>

  <p>'Oh, I don't know,' she said at last. 'You don't look so awful.'</p>

  <p>'What?' exclaimed the man indignantly. 'You entirely misunderstood my
  meaning.'</p>

  <p>'Peter?' In a very small voice.</p>

  <p>'Yes.' Grudgingly. 'Mr. Van Dyck to you.'</p>

  <p>'Your father called you Peter.'</p>

  <p>'Well, you're not my father.'</p>

  <p>'But I helped to bring you up in the business. It's been three years
  now.'</p>

  <p>'Seems longer.'</p>

  <p>'Does it? Well, it hasn't been long enough to make a coffee man of
  you.'</p>

  <p>'Is that so?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, that's so. You're a hell of a coffee man.' Peter looked pained.</p>

  <p>'It doesn't speak well for your teaching,' he said.</p>

  <p>'You never give me a tumble. Don't even call me Jo. Everybody else in the
  office calls me Jo.'</p>

  <p>'What do I call you?'</p>

  <p>'You don't call me anything. It's "Please take a letter," or "How do you
  feel to-day?" or "Sorry to keep you late." Never any name. To you I'm a
  nameless woman. Might just as well be a&mdash;a&mdash;little bastard for all
  you care.'</p>

  <p>This time Peter was profoundly shocked. He actually looked at the girl
  beside him. His eyes held a mixture of alarm and disapproval.</p>

  <p>'Don't use bad language,' he said.</p>

  <p>'Why not use bad language?' she retorted. 'You flaunt your drawers in my
  face.'</p>

  <p>'Is that quite fair?' he asked her. 'You stormed into my private office.
  Didn't stop to knock. And there I was. That's all there is to it.'</p>

  <p>Jo laughed tragically.</p>

  <p>'So that's all there is to it,' she flung back with a mean sneer. 'I
  suppose you think I'm going to be satisfied with that&mdash;a mere matter of
  drawers.'</p>

  <p>When Peter looked at her this time, alarm had utterly routed
  disapproval.</p>

  <p>'My God!' he managed to get out. 'What do you mean about not being
  satisfied with that?'</p>

  <p>'Exactly what I said,' she replied. 'I want to see all. Everything! It's
  the whole hog or nothing&mdash;that's how I am.'</p>

  <p>Peter felt his reason slipping. He could not believe his ears.</p>

  <p>Well,' he said at last, 'all I can say is that it's not a very nice way to
  be. It must be your French blood.'</p>

  <p>'I don't care whose blood it is,' she replied stubbornly. ' I want to see
  all.'</p>

  <p>'Let me get this straight,' said Peter. ' Do you mean all of me?'</p>

  <p>Josephine looked him over from head to foot. Peter felt a little
  undressed. Then suddenly she began to laugh. ' You'd look awfully funny,' she
  said at last, as if actually seeing him that way. ' What a fright!
  Imagine!'</p>

  <p>'Don't trouble yourself,' said Peter acidulously. ' I'm not exactly
  deformed, you know.'</p>

  <p>Jo stopped laughing and regarded him through moist eyes.</p>

  <p>'I don't believe it,' she said. ' You're hiding something from me.'</p>

  <p>'Do you expect me to walk about my office naked?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'After this morning I don't know what to expect.'</p>

  <p>Peter Van Dyck shrugged his shoulders helplessly.</p>

  <p>'I'd prefer not to continue this conversation,' he remarked coldly. 'No
  good can come of it.'</p>

  <p>'Very well,' replied Jo. 'Let's sit like a couple of bumps on a log.'</p>

  <p>'You may sit as you jolly well please,' replied Peter. 'However, I don't
  see why you are sitting here at all.'</p>

  <p>'Why don't you push me off?'</p>

  <p>'Nothing would please me more, but I'm too much of a gentleman.'</p>

  <p>'You mean, you're afraid,' she taunted.</p>

  <p>'Please be quiet.'</p>

  <p>'I suppose you're afraid Mr. Morgan or some other international banker
  might come along and see us talking together?'</p>

  <p>I am,' replied Peter.</p>

  <p>Well, listen to me, Mr. Peter Duane Van Dyck. If one of those old bozos
  got an eyeful of me he'd give you money instead of lending it to you.'</p>

  <p>'You seem to fancy yourself.'</p>

  <p>'I know my own value, and that's more than you do,' she retorted. 'I've a
  good mind to sell my body to an international banker.'</p>

  <p>'I wish to God you'd sell it to an international vivisectionist and have
  done with it,' Peter asserted brutally.</p>

  <p>'Why?' she inquired. 'Does my body bother you?'</p>

  <p>'Not at all. It means nothing to me.'</p>

  <p>'You mean you can take it or leave it&mdash;just as you please?'</p>

  <p>'Will you kindly keep quiet? I've a lot of things to think about. If I
  could take it and leave it somewhere else I'd feel much better.'</p>

  <p>Several minutes of silence passed. Josephine's gaze was idly sweeping the
  harbor. Presently she spoke.</p>

  <p>'Peter,' she said.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' replied Peter. 'What is it now?'</p>

  <p>'Do you see that liner?'</p>

  <p>'Can't help seeing that liner. It's blocking up the whole harbor.'</p>

  <p>Jo snaked her supple young body close up beside her employer.</p>

  <p>'Would you like to be on that liner, Peter?' she asked him.</p>

  <p>'Listen,' protested Peter. 'Are you trying to sit on my knees? We're
  huddled up together on this bench like a couple of lost waifs. It's not a
  cold day.'</p>

  <p>'Sorry, Peter. Wasn't looking where I was going. But you haven't answered
  my question. Would you like to be on that liner?'</p>

  <p>Peter considered the girl briefly; then his gaze returned to the outbound
  ship now stepping delicately on her way to open water. The bay glinted with
  sunlight, and its blue was very blue indeed. Like a virgin murmuring
  indiscreetly in her dreams, the soft air spoke of summer, of summer and
  secret places remote from the haunts of man. There was a note of promise too
  in the voice of the old gentleman who owned the long telescope gleaming on
  its tripod.</p>

  <p>'Visit the harbor and its institutions without budging your feet an inch!
  The Statue of Liberty and Governor's Island&mdash;all points of interest like
  as if you was there in the flesh.'</p>

  <p>Moodily Peter watched a customer tentatively approach a self-conscious eye
  to the telescope and begin his visit to the harbor. Peter followed the
  movements of the man with some anxiety. He wondered what point of interest
  the fellow was visiting now. Was he seeing anything at all or just pretending
  to, as most people did when involved with the end of a telescope? Peter had
  peered through a telescope once. There had been certain things on the moon
  &mdash;mountains, craters, or warts, for all he had been able to discover. He
  had lied about that moon. Said he had seen everything. Dwelt on the wonder of
  it all. Inwardly he had suffered from a sneaking sense of guilt and
  frustration. This visitor to the harbor was doubtless experiencing similar
  difficulties. That dusty mop of a dog curled up under the instrument knew
  perfectly well that the visitor was seeing nothing&mdash;less than nothing.
  They never did. For a moment the dog leered cynically at Peter, then
  transferred his gaze to a sparrow. He would dearly love to chew on some of
  that sparrow.</p>

  <p>Now the liner was spreading her wake along the channel. Soon she would
  find the sea. What the hell was wrong with him, anyway? Mooning here on a
  park bench with an impudent chit of an office girl for a companion. Maybe it
  was spring fever. Then maybe it wasn't. Maybe it was the thought of that
  cocktail party. He rather more than suspected it was. After the party he was
  scheduled to take Yolanda to some stuffy house party in New Jersey over the
  week-end. Not much comfort in that. Peter objected to house parties. Bridge,
  booze, and boredom. Gay laughter as false as hell. Feeble wisecracks and
  smart talk&mdash;the smug assurance of one's daily bread whether school kept
  or not. Golf links, motor cars, tennis courts, and swimming pools &mdash;all
  the paraphernalia of good, clean sport. Healthy bodies and tanned hides.
  Thoughts and manners cast in the same mould, case-hardened with the same
  prejudices and polished with the same culture. And here this poor devil,
  having paid his ten cents, stood all straddled out vainly endeavoring to
  snatch a moment's enjoyment from the end of a telescope. The subtle
  invitation of Jo's perfume once more assaulted his nerves. Peter liked that
  perfume, and the fact that he suspected he also liked its owner a little more
  than was seemly made him deliberately hostile.</p>

  <p>'You haven't answered my question,' she said.</p>

  <p>'What question?' asked Peter uneasily.</p>

  <p>'About that liner. How would you like to be on her?'</p>

  <p>'I'd like it,' said Peter surprisingly.</p>

  <p>'You mean us?' put in Jo. 'Just you and I...outward bound...springtime in
  France...windows on the sea&mdash;think of it, Peter. Just you and I.
  Married, perhaps, or almost the same thing.'</p>

  <p>Peter gasped at the immoral conclusion to this lyrical outburst.</p>

  <p>'I'd jump off the ship,' he said.</p>

  <p>'Oh no, you wouldn't,' the girl replied with every show of confidence. 'If
  I had you alone for five minutes you'd jump in only one direction, and I'm
  too much of a lady to mention that.'</p>

  <p>'Are you just naturally plain bad through and through?' Peter asked her.
  He was really interested to know.</p>

  <p>'I'm what you've made me,' she answered humbly.</p>

  <p>'What!' exclaimed Peter. ' I haven't done a thing to you.'</p>

  <p>'I know. That's just the trouble. That's why I'm bad. Don't you realize a
  body has to be bad before it can plop down and be good?'</p>

  <p>'I don't care to discuss bodies. Much rather swim after that ship.'</p>

  <p>'Why don't you? I hope you drown.' Then with a sudden change in her voice,
  'What's on your mind, Peter? You haven't been so gay lately.'</p>

  <p>Her brown eyes studied the features of the man with their suggestion of
  gauntness. For a moment they rested on his expressive lips, broken by a
  faintly ironical twist. She moistened hers, then peered inquiringly into his
  eyes, unremarkable mild blue eyes, rather gentle and easily tired yet
  strangely capable of conveying a world of hidden meanings. He was not a
  good-looking man, yet Jo had always found him attractive. Especially his
  eyes, in which in spite of their apparent weariness he seemed to live most of
  his life. He was a kind of old young man to Jo, an old young man who had
  never been really young and who never would grow really old. He belonged to
  an unclassified type&mdash;no three-dimensional hero, Peter, yet very
  definitely himself. At present his eyes were haunted with all sorts of
  unexpressed difficulties.</p>

  <p>'What's on your mind?' she repeated.</p>

  <p>'Nothing definite,' said Peter, allowing his gaze to rest on the girl with
  a little less disapproval. 'You know. One of these cocktail teas&mdash;
  stupid things.'</p>

  <p>Jo did not know. She was deeply interested, as are all daughters of Eve,
  in social functions in which they are not included.</p>

  <p>'To-day?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'After office,' said Peter. 'My aunt's doing it for Yolanda Wilmont. We
  get engaged at it&mdash;officially engaged and all that.'</p>

  <p>All what?' she inquired suspiciously.</p>

  <p>'Oh, just all that.'</p>

  <p>'I hope you don't mean what I'm thinking,' said Jo.</p>

  <p>'At my lowest moments,' he replied, ' I never could mean what you're
  thinking.'</p>

  <p>'Thanks,' murmured Jo. 'What's she like? Of course, I've seen her pictures
  in the scandal sheets. They've given me many a good laugh.'</p>

  <p>'You're just envious,' retorted Peter, hardly spirited enough to be stung
  to a defence of his fiancée.</p>

  <p>'I might possibly be envious about all that,' she admitted, 'but certainly
  not about being engaged to you.'</p>

  <p>'Neither am I,' replied Peter cryptically.</p>

  <p>The girl cast him a swift look&mdash;a look of sparrow-like intelligence.
  She was snatching at crumbs of comfort now, yet at the same time finding room
  to feel a little bit sorry for Peter.</p>

  <p>'So that's why you'd like to swim after that ship,' she observed in a
  thoughtful voice.</p>

  <p>'After any ship,' said Peter.</p>

  <p>I understand,' she answered.</p>

  <p>'No, you don't,' replied Peter, suddenly getting up from the bench. 'As a
  matter of fact I'm very happy. I'm a decidedly lucky man.'</p>

  <p>Of course you are, Peter,' she assured him.</p>

  <p>This time he cast her a swift look.</p>

  <p>'An exceptionally lucky man,' he reiterated with quite unnecessary
  emphasis. 'Getting far more than I deserve, in fact.'</p>

  <p>'Now you're talking,' said Jo. 'Much more than you deserve, and you're
  pretty bad.'</p>

  <p>'What do you mean by that?'</p>

  <p>'I don't mean anything, Peter. I'm agreeing with you.'</p>

  <p>'Well, don't,' he snapped. 'I dislike the way you do it. Anyway, it's time
  to get back to the office. Can't remember ever spending a more trying
  luncheon hour.'</p>

  <p>'Would you believe it?' said Josephine. 'It's been much longer than that.
  Time passes so quickly for a young girl when she meets an interesting,
  middle-aged party'</p>

  <p>'Middle-aged hell. How old are you?'</p>

  <p>'Swear to God I'm twenty-four, mister.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I'm only ten years older.'</p>

  <p>'Just the right age, although you do look a wee bit faded.'</p>

  <p>'The right age for what?' Peter was unwise enough to want to know.</p>

  <p>'For fatherhood,' she told him, looking glowingly up into his face.</p>

  <p>Some hidden strain of old Dutch modesty forced Peter to lower his
  lids.</p>

  <p>'Come,' he said. 'We're going back to the office.'</p>

  <p>But before they left, their eyes sought the liner nosing far down the
  Narrows. Jo gave a little sigh, the wistful ghost of a great big wish. In
  Peter's eyes the harassed look had deepened. It was verging on the desperate
  now.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap3"
     name="chap3">3. REVELATION OF THE LEGS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The day was dragging on, and by now that liner must be far
  out at sea. Peter sat thinking about it. In his thoughts were mingled
  fleeting visions of Yolanda Wilmont and Josephine Duval. What was it all
  about, all this uneasy speculation, this sensation of approaching loss and
  separation? Separation from what, from whom? Obviously, he must be in love
  with Yolanda Wilmont &mdash;had been in love with her for years. That was all
  settled, one of the established facts of his life. She was beautiful, she was
  cultured, and she seemed to find nothing especially wrong with him. Of
  course, she had never allowed either herself nor him to become in any sense
  intimate on the strength of this engagement of theirs. She was not at all
  like that. Just the opposite of this Duval woman. That was something to be
  thankful for&mdash; but was it? Peter wondered. On the other hand, he
  seriously doubted if one man could last long with an oversexed creature like
  Josephine without calling in outside assistance, which did not make for a
  happy married life. Josephine was impossible. He failed to know why he was
  thinking about her at all. What business had that brazen vixen preening
  herself in his thoughts? She was merely his private secretary, an efficient
  one, but forward. She, too, had become a fixture in his life. His father had
  found her amusing, but then, the elder Van Dyck had been a loose liver after
  office hours. He had found any good-looking wench amusing. Peter was not like
  that. He had never had the chance. As he sat there thinking, he found himself
  rather envying his father's disregard of convention. Closer than had any
  other Van Dyck immortalized in the family record, the old gentleman had
  approached the open ground of disreputability. He had been keenly alert to
  every female leg in the office, and he had personally seen to it that every
  leg in the office was first-rate. Yet every one had been fond of old Peter
  Van Dyck, including his son. Young Peter had been too greatly occupied
  fearing the consequences of his father's ambitious but questionable
  experiments to embark on any of his own. Many a father has lost his morals in
  saving those of a son, although it is highly problematical that the elder Van
  Dyck had this idea in mind as he tidily tottered among his vices. His
  interest in Jo Duval, however, had been restrained to one of fatherly
  admiration mixed with a little fear and respect, emotions few women had ever
  inspired in him.</p>

  <p>Peter's thoughts were interrupted by the entrance of Josephine Duval.
  Without so much as favoring him with a glance, she marched up to his desk,
  smacked down on it an intra-office memorandum, then turned and retraced her
  steps. At the door she paused and fixed him with a pair of glittering eyes.
  Peter quailed before their malevolence. In the way she closed the door behind
  her there was a suggestion of a challenge.</p>

  <p>Why was this creature so disturbing? Peter wondered. At times, when it so
  pleased her mood, she acted exactly as if she were in a play. It wasn't
  natural. Imagine! This stalking into a man's office, then stalking out again
  with never a word. And what a look she had left behind&mdash;what a downright
  sinister look! What had she meant by that?</p>

  <p>With the least interest in the world in intra-office routine Peter picked
  up the memorandum and glanced at it. Quite suddenly his bored expression
  changed to one of consternation. He read :</p>

  <p class="letter">To PETER VAN DYCK, President:<br>
  <br>
  The moment you consummate your marriage with Yolanda Wilmont (what a name!) I
  want my resignation to take effect. However, until that moment it's still
  anybody's game, catch-as-catch-can, and you're It.<br>
  <br>
  Respectfully yours, JOSEPHINE DUVAL. <i>P.S.</i> &mdash; A carbon of this
  memorandum will be found in my files under 'Unfinished Business.'</p>

  <p>As if it were scorching his fingers, Peter hastily destroyed the
  compromising slip of paper. This was going too far. He rang for his
  secretary.</p>

  <p>'Haven't you got any better sense than to start in playing childish games
  with me?' he demanded.</p>

  <p>'The games I intend to play with you will be far from childish,' she
  assured him.</p>

  <p>Peter began to think this over, then decided it would be better to leave
  it alone.</p>

  <p>'Sit down,' he said in a reasonable voice, 'and let's try to get things
  straight.'</p>

  <p>Josephine flopped down and recklessly tossed one silken leg over the
  other.</p>

  <p>'In the first place,' began Peter, 'why have you selected to-day of all
  days to deport yourself in an especially hellish manner?'</p>

  <p>'I'm like this every day, only some days I let go,' she told him.</p>

  <p>Peter considered this for a moment.</p>

  <p>'Do you mean you're like this with everybody,' he inquired, 'or just with
  me?'</p>

  <p>'Just with you,' she confided. 'If I was like this with everybody I'd have
  a much nicer time.'</p>

  <p>'You don't mean nicer,' said Peter. 'You mean better, perhaps.'</p>

  <p>'It's too fine a distinction for me to understand,' she replied. 'But it's
  the truth just the same. I let go only with you.'</p>

  <p>'Why with me, may I ask? Do you regard me in the light of a small office
  boy&mdash;a person to tease?'</p>

  <p>'Hardly,' she said. 'I regard you as a weak but adult male.'</p>

  <p>'Apparently,' replied Peter. 'But would you mind not letting go with me,
  or try letting go with some one else, for a change?'</p>

  <p>She looked at him thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>'I'd rather not,' she said.</p>

  <p>'So would I,' replied Peter, not realizing what he was saying.</p>

  <p>'You mean you'd care if I let go with some one else?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'Certainly not,' replied Peter. 'I don't care if you let go with Mahatma
  Gandhi, with all due respect to that gentleman.'</p>

  <p>'It wouldn't be hard to let go with that one,' Jo observed. 'He has so
  very little to let go of.'</p>

  <p>'That's neither here nor there,' said Peter impatiently. 'You'll have to
  stop letting go with me or I'll let go with you.'</p>

  <p>'I'd like that,' replied the girl quite seriously.</p>

  <p>'I mean, I'll have to let you go,' he corrected himself.</p>

  <p>'You haven't even got me yet,' she answered.</p>

  <p>'And I don't even want you,' said Peter.</p>

  <p>'How do you know?' she demanded. 'You don't know anything about me. You
  don't know I live in New Jersey, that I support a drunken uncle, that I'm an
  orphan on both sides and sleep on the left. You don't know that I love salted
  almonds and that I don't earn enough money here to keep myself in nice
  underthings. You wear pure silk drawers. Don't tell me&mdash;I saw them with
  my own two eyes. What sort of drawers do you think I wear? Answer me that.
  What sort of drawers do you think I wear? Pure silk? Bah!'</p>

  <p>'I'm sure I don't care to know that,' Peter interrupted. 'And please don't
  keep repeating the question.'</p>

  <p>'No,' she sneered, 'you don't care to know. You're too much of a coward.
  Well, if you must know, I'll tell you. They're artificial silk&mdash;not all
  silk like yours&mdash;but the lace on 'em is real.'</p>

  <p>'Must I know all these things?' asked Peter weakly.</p>

  <p>'Certainly you must,' she snapped. 'You're dealing in human souls.'</p>

  <p>'I had hoped to deal in coffee,' he replied with a show of bitterness,
  'but you don't give me time to sell a bean.'</p>

  <p>'I wouldn't be found dead in those things you have on,' she continued.
  'Mine are better for less money.'</p>

  <p>'No doubt,' Peter said coldly. 'But did it ever occur to you that I have
  no desire to be found dead in yours?'</p>

  <p>'Of course you wouldn't,' she flung back. 'Not dead.'</p>

  <p>Here she laughed significantly&mdash;suggestively, in fact. Peter Van Dyck
  was most unpleasantly impressed by the insinuating look that followed.
  Helplessly he turned his eyes to the window.</p>

  <p>'I fail to see where all this is leading to,' he said at length. 'Hadn't
  you better take a couple of letters?'</p>

  <p>'All right,' she retorted. 'Give me a couple of letters. It's better than
  getting nothing. But while we're on the subject, there's another thing you
  don't know.'</p>

  <p>'I'm off the subject. Most definitely off it.'</p>

  <p>'Well, you've got to know this,' she continued. 'One of the last things
  your father asked me to do was to make a man of you.'</p>

  <p>'If you followed his ideas on that subject,' said Peter, you'd make a
  wreck of me instead of a man, I'm afraid.'</p>

  <p>'You're certainly not the man he was,' she admitted with uncomplimentary
  readiness, 'but I'm going to do my best with the little there is.'</p>

  <p>'That's very gracious of you, I'm sure. But let me get this straight. Do
  you intend to make a man of me or a wreck?'</p>

  <p>'I'm going to wreck you,' said the girl, 'and enjoy myself doing it.'</p>

  <p>'A nice young girl!' murmured Peter Van Dyck. 'An admirable character all
  round!'</p>

  <p>'And while you're talking of nice young girls,' said Jo, 'you might as
  well know your father wasn't any too fond of that nice young girl of yours
  with the name of a fairy princess. And as for an admirable character&mdash;
  pish! I'd rather have a swell shape.'</p>

  <p>'Couldn't you strive to develop both?'</p>

  <p>'I'm fully developed as it is,' she asserted. 'If anything, a little too
  much so in places, but you'd never know that.'</p>

  <p>'I have no desire to be further enlightened,' Peter hastened to assure
  her.</p>

  <p>'You have no ambition,' said Jo.</p>

  <p>'How about a couple of letters?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'All right. How about 'em? I'd almost given those letters up.'</p>

  <p>'And will you take the carbon of that memorandum out of your files?' he
  asked her.</p>

  <p>'If you don't hurry up with those letters,' Jo replied, 'I'll take it out
  of the files and tack it on the bulletin board.' This threat so upset Peter
  that he in turn upset a box of paper clips. As he bent over to pick them up,
  he came face to face with Josephine Duval's knee. Some artists claim that the
  knee of a woman is not an object of beauty. No such claim could be made
  against Josephine Duval's knee. If an artist lived who, upon seeing
  Josephine's knee, did not want to do something more than paint it, he was not
  worthy of his brush. And the wonder of it was that Josephine had two knees.
  Peter Van Dyck was gazing at them both. It was an experience he never forgot
  &mdash;a revelation. For the first time in his life he realized that a
  woman's knees and legs were capable of expressing personality. And with this
  realization came the explanation of his distaste for the cocktail party and
  what it represented. In the course of his life he had seen a lot of Yolanda's
  legs, but never once during the period of this long association with them had
  he been moved by a desire to do anything other than look at them, and not so
  strongly moved at that. As Peter sat half crouching in his chair, it came to
  him, with a sense of having been cheated, that Yolanda's legs had never meant
  anything more to him than something to separate her body from the ground,
  something to move her about on from place to place. They might as well have
  been a pair of stilts or a couple of wheels. In spite of their gracious
  proportions they were totally lacking in personality. They exercised no
  fascination, no irresistible appeal. They were cold but beautiful legs.
  Josephine's legs were different. The more Peter looked at them the more he
  wanted to see of them. He frankly admitted this. Not only were they beautiful
  but also extremely interesting&mdash;breath-taking legs, legs seen once in a
  lifetime. He wondered what had been wrong with him not to have noticed them
  before. Why had he made this startling discovery at this late date, virtually
  at the very moment when he was going to become officially engaged to an
  altogether different pair of legs&mdash;to legs he would have to live with
  for the remainder of his days?</p>

  <p>Josephine's voice cut in on his meditations.</p>

  <p>'Have you decided to conduct your business in that weird position?' she
  asked. 'Or have you been seized suddenly by a cramp?'</p>

  <p>'I'm not going to be like this long,' he answered, 'nor am I subject to
  cramp. I am merely thinking.'</p>

  <p>'Then I think you're overdoing it,' said the girl. 'First thing you know
  you'll be having a rush of blood to the head.'</p>

  <p>'I have one already,' replied Peter in an odd voice.</p>

  <p>Slowly he straightened up, then sank back in his chair. Almost immediately
  he fell into a brown study, and although he was looking directly at Josephine
  his gaze seemed to pass through and far beyond her. The girl eyed him
  curiously. What had come over this man? Little did she suspect that what she
  had so often wanted to happen actually had happened without her knowledge or
  contrivance.</p>

  <p>In the presence of this startling revelation Peter Van Dyck sat bemused.
  For the first time in his life he concentrated his mental forces on legs.
  How, he wondered, had a leg, a mere leg, the power to move a man so
  profoundly&mdash;to revolutionize his entire outlook on such matters? All
  legs were more or less alike, he argued, so much skin and so much bone. Take
  his own legs, for example. He had never derived any pleasure or satisfaction
  in contemplating their hungry contours, if they had any contours to
  contemplate. He supposed they had, yet he was not in any way moved when he
  cast his eyes on them unless it was by a feeling of distaste. As a matter of
  fact, he preferred not to look at his legs at all. He rather avoided them.
  Yet wherein were they so different from those of Josephine Duval? They were
  composed of the same elements, served the same purpose and reacted to the
  same external influences&mdash;heat, cold, kicks, and bites. Certainly
  mosquitoes did not differentiate between legs. About Jo's legs there was
  something impudent and piquant, a devil-may-care attitude. She had, morally
  speaking, a wicked pair of legs.</p>

  <p>'Take a couple of letters,' he began in a dull, pre-occupied voice.</p>

  <p>'That would be amusing for a change,' said Jo sweetly.</p>

  <p>'Almost anything would be amusing for a change,' he agreed. 'Get on with
  it. This is to Mr. Benjamin Clarke. You have his address. Dear Ben.' Peter's
  eyes strayed downward. 'Dear Ben,' he resumed.</p>

  <p>'Dear Ben twice?' asked Jo.</p>

  <p>'Once or twice,' replied Peter. 'It doesn't matter. He knows who he is.
  Dear Ben: Referring to our recent conversation about knees and legs
  &mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Pardon me,' smoothly interrupted the girl. 'Did I understand you to say
  knees and legs?'</p>

  <p>'Means and ways,' corrected Peter.</p>

  <p>'Were you and Ben discussing means and ways to knees and legs?' she asked
  him. 'You've got me all mixed up.'</p>

  <p>'That doesn't matter either,' said Peter. 'I never discuss such subjects.
  You should know that.'</p>

  <p>'It would do you a world of good,' she assured him. 'Please keep such
  advice to yourself.'</p>

  <p>It was at this moment that Jo became aware of the direction of her
  employer's intent gaze.</p>

  <p>'Are you, by any chance, looking at my legs?' she inquired in a pleased
  voice.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' he answered. 'One can scarcely look at anything else.'</p>

  <p>'You mean they're so attractive?'</p>

  <p>'No. I mean they're literally all over the place.'</p>

  <p>'If I'm not being too bold,' said the girl, 'would you mind giving me a
  rough idea of what you think of them?'</p>

  <p>'I don't think of them,' he answered coldly. 'I look at them the same as I
  would look at a chair or a desk or&mdash;or&mdash;the Pyramids.'</p>

  <p>'Go on,' she said in a dangerous voice. 'Why bring up the Pyramids?'</p>

  <p>'I am trying to explain to you the impersonal attitude I take to your
  legs.'</p>

  <p>Jo sprang from her chair. Her face was flaming, and from her eyes fire
  flashed through two angry tears.</p>

  <p>'And I'd like to explain to you,' she said in a low voice, 'the personal
  attitude I take to your words. You may criticize my typing as much as you
  please, but I won't allow you to say a word against my legs. Your Yolanda may
  be able to afford better stockings, but taking her leg for leg she's a
  hunchback compared to me.'</p>

  <p>'Aren't you getting your anatomy a trifle scrambled?' asked Peter in a
  collected voice.</p>

  <p>'I'd damn well like to scramble yours all over the map,' she retorted.
  'Hitting below the belt.'</p>

  <p>'Quite,' replied Peter, coolly measuring her figure with his eyes. 'I
  should say about twelve inches or more.'</p>

  <p>'I'm going to get out of this room,' she declared, 'and never come back
  into it again. If you want to hurl insults at me and talk in a low, lewd
  manner, you'll have to do it outside where every one can hear what a
  lecherous creature you are.'</p>

  <p>'On your way to your desk,' he called after her pleasantly, 'will you be
  so good as to ask Miss Bryant to step in?'</p>

  <p>'Sure,' she flung over her shoulder. 'I suppose you'll compare hers to
  Pike's Peak or the Empire State.'</p>

  <p>'I'll have to consider them first,' said Peter.</p>

  <p>The sound the door made when it closed had in it the quality of a
  curse.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap4"
     name="chap4">4. RIDING TO A FALL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Betty Bryant was not a bad-looking girl. Peter realized this
  when, a few minutes after Jo's impassioned exit, the young girl entered his
  office and stood waiting expectantly before his desk. Since the demoralizing
  revelation of his secretary's knees and legs Peter had begun to feel that he
  was looking at women through an entirely new and improved pair of eyes. Now,
  when it was almost too late to take advantage of his clearer vision, he was
  beginning to regret the opportunities he had missed in the past as well as
  those he would have to forego in the future. The situation was nothing less
  than tragic. Life owed him many unclaimed women. The reprehensible blood of
  the elder Van Dyck throbbed rebelliously in his veins.</p>

  <p>'Miss Bryant,' he said, protecting sections of his features behind a
  letter, 'I wish you would toss on your hat and buy half a dozen pairs of
  stockings at one of the smarter shops in the district. Would you mind?'</p>

  <p>Miss Bryant certainly would not mind. She would be glad to go to even
  greater lengths for Mr. Peter Van Dyck. She would, however, have been
  interested to know what clearly impure motives lay behind this unexpected
  request. From the little she could see of Peter's features she was convinced
  they did not belong to a thoroughly honest face.</p>

  <p>'Have you any particular shade in mind, sir?' she asked him.</p>

  <p>'Shade in mind?' repeated Peter. 'Er&mdash;oh yes, of course. Naturally.'
  He laughed for no reason. 'Flesh,' he announced, colouring slightly. 'I mean
  all shades. You know. All the fashionable shades. Youthful. They're for my
  Aunt Sophie. She has rather silly ideas&mdash;ambitions, one might say.'</p>

  <p>'Oh,' said Miss Bryant. 'So they're for your aunt.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' retorted Peter. 'I said they were for my aunt. Why? Is it
  funny?'</p>

  <p>'No. Oh no. Not at all. I was wondering what size stocking your Aunt
  Sophie wears, that's all.'</p>

  <p>'Any size I give her,' replied Peter, striving to maintain a casual note
  in his voice. 'I should say about the same size as that Josephine Duval or
  any other girl her size.'</p>

  <p>'I think I understand,' said Miss Bryant thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>'I was very much afraid you would,' remarked Peter as he handed the young
  lady several crisp notes. 'And while you're about it, treat your own legs to
  a pair on the house,' he added. 'Fine feathers make fine birds, you know. Ha,
  ha! Capital!'</p>

  <p>With her employer's false laughter ringing in her ears, Miss Bryant
  departed, wondering why she had never suspected him before of being mentally
  unsteady. These old families got that way in spots. Too bad.</p>

  <p>When she had successfully fulfilled her mission and delivered the
  stockings to Peter, he summoned his secretary. Although she had flatly
  announced her intention of never entering his office again, Josephine Duval
  appeared almost immediately.</p>

  <p>'What improper suggestions have you been making to that Bryant thing?' she
  demanded. 'She's gone light in the head all of a sudden.'</p>

  <p>'I know nothing about that,' said Peter. 'She struck me as being an
  uncommonly sensible and willing young lady.'</p>

  <p>'Willing, no doubt,' snapped Josephine, and laughed disagreeably.</p>

  <p>'I particularly dislike the sound of that laugh,' said Peter, 'as well as
  the coarse implications behind it. Here are half a dozen pairs of stockings
  &mdash;pure silk stockings&mdash;all silk stockings, in fact. Yank a couple
  of them over your legs and let's hear no more on the subject. This has been a
  fruitless day, and it's not going to get any better.'</p>

  <p>Josephine took the extended package and tore off its wrappings. For a
  moment there was silence in the office as she examined the contents with an
  experienced and rapidly calculating eye. Presently she turned and looked
  darkly at Peter Van Dyck.</p>

  <p>'And for this,' she said, 'I suppose you expect to own me, body and
  soul.'</p>

  <p>'I'm not interested in your soul,' Peter informed her curtly.</p>

  <p>'Oh,' said Josephine, momentarily nonplussed. 'All right. It's a bargain.
  We'll let it go at a body.'</p>

  <p>'I have no idea what you are planning on letting go,' Peter replied
  uneasily, 'but I strongly advise you to hold everything. And please get it
  into your head that I have no desire to own either your body or your
  soul.'</p>

  <p>'How about a little loan?' Josephine suggested.</p>

  <p>'Will you now go away and stop talking wildly,' said Peter. 'After all, I
  am your employer. You're supposed to be working here, you know, and not
  paying me little visits throughout the day.'</p>

  <p>Josephine looked at him furiously.</p>

  <p>'You're going to own my body,' she said between her teeth, 'if I have to
  ruin yours in the struggle.'</p>

  <p>'An edifying picture,' Peter dryly observed. 'However, I shall keep on the
  alert.'</p>

  <p>'If they weren't pure silk I'd cut these stockings to ribbons.'</p>

  <p>'Glad you like them,' said Peter mildly. 'If I were you, I wouldn't carry
  them about with me in the office. People might talk.'</p>

  <p>'I'll stick 'em down here,' she declared, thrusting the six pairs of
  stockings down the front of her dress, where they produced an interesting,
  not to say scandalous effect.</p>

  <p>'If you go out there in that condition,' observed Peter, 'people will do
  more than talk. They'll swoon in your face. Even I, in full possession of all
  the facts, cannot suppress a pang of uneasiness.'</p>

  <p>'You're responsible for my condition,' she flung back.</p>

  <p>'Granted,' replied Peter reasonably. 'But I'm not responsible for what
  others might erroneously conclude was your condition.'</p>

  <p>'Anyway, here I go,' said Josephine. 'We have a secret between us
  now.'</p>

  <p>'It looks as if we have a great deal more than that,' Peter replied.</p>

  <p>'Nobody will notice anything if I go like this,' the girl explained,
  placing her hands across her stomach.</p>

  <p>'Oh no,' agreed Peter. 'They'll merely think I kicked you in a moment of
  playfulness, that's all. Please hurry. It upsets me to look at you the way
  you are.'</p>

  <p>At the door Jo turned and glanced back at him.</p>

  <p>'You can't tell me,' she said, 'you didn't have something else in your
  mind when you gave me these.'</p>

  <p>The door closed behind her, and Peter leaned back in his chair. He was
  wondering himself exactly what he had in his mind in regard to Jo Duval. Time
  passed while Peter sat thus steadily accomplishing nothing. He had
  contributed very little to the success of the Van Dyck coffee business that
  day. Presently he stirred and reached for his watch. After thoughtfully
  considering the time of day it announced, he compared it with the clock on
  his desk.</p>

  <p>To make assurance doubly sure, he rose, and, opening the door, glanced at
  the office clock. As he closed the door he got the impression that Betty
  Bryant was studying him with new interest. Perhaps there were others, he
  unhappily decided. Crossing the room to the window, he stood looking down on
  the narrow street. People were already turning their released expressions
  homeward. They were looking forward to a few hours of personal living, a few
  hours of individual freedom. Five p.m. was for them a daily declaration of
  temporary independence. Not so for him. He had to go home presently and let
  that damn cat out of the bag. He would much rather wring its neck. Was he not
  voluntarily thrusting his own neck into a noose for life? It was still not
  too late. Why not take a ferry-boat to Staten Island and live among the trees
  somewhere? Why not cross a bridge and lose himself in a swarm of unfamiliar
  streets? Why not scuttle through a tube and seek oblivion in a water-front
  speakeasy? There were any number of things he could do. As he stood there by
  the window, he became uneasily aware of the fog drifting through the street.
  Figures of men and women were cutting through it, zigzagging past one
  another, going north, going south, ducking down the side streets. Boys were
  whistling. Boys always were. Why? Why were they always whistling? From two
  rivers came the haunting voices of ships&mdash;tugs, liners, ferry-boats,
  yachts going up to pleasant moorings. Foggy as hell somewhere. What sort of
  mooring was he going up to? An anchorage for life. Maybe something would
  happen. Lots of things could happen in a fog. He turned from the window,
  walked slowly to the hat rack, and collected his hat and stick. As he bade
  his office staff good night, he felt he was saying good-bye. Josephine Duval
  had already gone.</p>

  <p>The subway crowd was familiar, but not friendly. It was composed of
  individuals, each having tenaciously held ideas about his or her place on the
  platform. They knew where they wanted to go and how they wanted to go there,
  and nothing was going to stop them or change them or soften them. Looking
  slightly pained, Peter Van Dyck, with a delicate but nevertheless protesting
  arc in his back, allowed himself to be catapulted into a train in which he
  stood tightly wedged, suffering from a loss of both dignity and breath. He
  decided he was lucky to lose no more than that in such a frenzied
  stampede.</p>

  <p>'If you don't stop doing that to me,' said a woman's voice somewhere in
  the neighborhood of his chest, 'I'll slap you in the face.'</p>

  <p>Peter's first reaction was to glance nervously about him to ascertain if
  the entire car had overheard the woman's intentions. Then he spoke in a low,
  reassuring voice in which was a note of appeal.</p>

  <p>'I'm not doing it,' he whispered.</p>

  <p>'Don't tell me that,' said the woman. 'Can't I feel? There you go, doing
  it again. You're getting a lot for a nickel ride, mister.'</p>

  <p>'My God,' thought Peter, striving unsuccessfully to remove himself from
  the woman, 'what a thing for her to say!' Crouching over, he muttered to the
  top of a small hat, 'Madam, I can't help it. I'm &mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Do you mean you've lost control of yourself?' the woman's voice cut
  in.</p>

  <p>'No,' he protested. 'I can't think of what I'm doing.'</p>

  <p>'I don't like to think of what you are doing,' the woman continued. 'Lay
  off, that's all. Do you want me to scream for help?'</p>

  <p>Straining his neck down and to the side, Peter succeeded in getting a
  glimpse of his accuser. It was as he had been suspecting for the past few
  moments. She was there&mdash;Jo.</p>

  <p>Peter did not know whether to be relieved by this or alarmed.</p>

  <p>'Don't go on like that,' he pleaded.</p>

  <p>'Don't you go on like that,' she told him. 'Should be ashamed of yourself.
  Of all the things to do.'</p>

  <p>'But what in God's name am I doing?' he asked in desperation.</p>

  <p>'To explain what you're doing would be even more embarrassing than to
  submit to it,' she told him with elaborate dignity.</p>

  <p>'It can't be as bad as all that,' he said.</p>

  <p>'I'd hate it to get any worse,' she replied, 'at least with so much public
  about, I would.'</p>

  <p>'It is too close for decency,' agreed Peter.</p>

  <p>'You seem to find it so,' she retorted. 'Suppose they knew at the
  office?'</p>

  <p>'Knew what?'</p>

  <p>'Never mind about what. You know perfectly well. I hate that sort of thing
  &mdash;that type of man.'</p>

  <p>'So do I,' replied Peter earnestly. 'The very idea is revolting to
  me.'</p>

  <p>'Then obviously, you don't believe in letting your left hand know what
  your right hand is doing,' she retorted. 'Both of my hands are busy,' he
  declared.</p>

  <p>'Don't I know that?' said Jo. 'I'd call them frantic. Only married couples
  should be allowed to travel in the subway during rush hours.'</p>

  <p>'What did you do with the stockings?' he asked her, hoping to change the
  subject.</p>

  <p>'You couldn't get closer to them unless you put them on,' she assured
  him.</p>

  <p>'Then they're still in the same place?'</p>

  <p>'Either there or hanging on my backbone.'</p>

  <p>'How ghastly!'</p>

  <p>'It's your fault if they are,' she replied. 'Do you still intend to go
  through that mock engagement announcement?'</p>

  <p>'Why not?' demanded Peter.</p>

  <p>'Shouldn't think you'd have the nerve after this ride.'</p>

  <p>'Don't be silly.'</p>

  <p>'I'm not being silly when I tell you,' she replied quite seriously, 'that
  I doubt very much if you get yourself engaged to-day.'</p>

  <p>Peter glanced quickly down into her upturned face. In her eyes he read an
  expression of grim determination. For some reason her portentous threat or
  warning did not strike the disagreeable note one might have expected. Peter
  received it almost with a feeling of relief. In fact, he found in her words a
  fragile straw of salvation. If it would have served to delay the formal
  betrothal announcement, Peter would have welcomed a localized earthquake. So
  far as his engagement to Yolanda was concerned, he found himself strictly
  neutral. He was on the fence. It was not as if he wanted to call the
  engagement off definitely and for ever. Peter simply did not know. Why had
  they not gone through with it several years ago, instead of waiting until the
  idea had grown stale? No. Yolanda had wanted to travel on the Continent
  unattached. She had wanted to develop her art. She had wanted to enjoy her
  position as a much sought after debutante. She was one of those young ladies
  who wanted Life with a capital L, yet who would not know what to do with it
  should it come to her. She had wanted ever so many things and she had got all
  of them. And in the background she had also wanted Peter, Peter in a waiting
  capacity safely packed in ice. She was such a glittering, assured sort of
  person, so certain to be right, so well versed in all the social amenities.
  She would be quite a comfort when people called, as they inevitably would
  call, in droves&mdash;dumb, well-dressed, well-nourished, chatty little
  droves of really nice people. Peter wondered unhappily in his increasing
  morbidness what they were going to do with all the people who called. Where
  were they going to put them? How deal with them? The years ahead presented
  themselves to Peter as pillars in an endless hall lined with nice people who
  shook hands and chatted delightfully about non-essentials.</p>

  <p>And all the while he was puzzling over these things, Jo was looking up
  into his troubled, rather sensitive face from beneath the heavy lashes of her
  amused but devoted eyes.</p>

  <p>'Hang it all,' he said at last, 'why do you like me, anyway? I should
  think you'd fall for a truck driver or a professional wrestler or a strong
  man, or for one of those great big silent chaps who make the maximum amount
  of empire on the minimum amount of words. The movies are full of them. Look
  at me&mdash;I'm virtually a physical and mental wreck. Might just as well be
  an idiot. I catch cold almost always, my nose gets red in the winter and even
  worse in the summer&mdash;frost and sunburn vie for honors&mdash;I probably
  snore enormously and, as you know for yourself, I don't even know how many
  pairs of drawers I'm wearing half the time, whereas during the other half I
  dare say I'm not wearing any drawers at all. I'm quite impossible any way you
  look at it.'</p>

  <p>'I realize all that,' she said, 'but I bet you know a lot of dirty
  stories, and I fairly wallow in those.'</p>

  <p>Peter groaned spiritually. This creature was beyond belief&mdash;
  literally incredible. And to think that he had been in the same office with
  her for three whole years, and before that his father had been subjected to
  the same demoralizing influence. Perhaps that accounted for the old
  gentleman's perennial bloomings.</p>

  <p>'Furthermore,' the girl's voice continued, 'professional wrestlers and
  strong men and those silent birds you mentioned are notoriously moral. They
  hold deep-rooted convictions and have exceedingly piggish ways. Now you
  &mdash;you're quite another proposition. Without realizing it you are so
  morally flexible that you must have been born corrupted. I'd much rather live
  amid physical ruins than stagnate amid moral perfection.'</p>

  <p>'Your sentiments and opinions do us both credit, I'm sure,' observed Peter
  Van Dyck. 'What sort of life are you planning for me to live with you&mdash;
  one of pillage, rape, and arson?'</p>

  <p>'Pillage and arson, perhaps,' she said briefly. 'The other will not be
  necessary.'</p>

  <p>'Aren't you getting off soon?' asked Peter.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' she replied as the train lurched into Times Square. 'Right here.
  Good-bye, for the moment, and don't be surprised at anything that happens.
  Remember, I'm on your side.'</p>

  <p>Peter's gaze followed her through the door of the train and out on to the
  platform. As she looked back at him Josephine decided she had never seen a
  more lost and miserable expression in any man's eyes. Being of a primitive
  nature, she still had room for pity. Her scheme for helping this man and at
  the same time helping herself crystallized there in her mind as Peter's train
  drew out. Tossing her shopping expedition to the winds, she boarded the next
  up-town express.</p>

  <p>On her way to 72nd Street she revolved many desperate remedies in her
  mind. At the same time she found occasion to congratulate herself for having
  come to a decision while still in the subway, for thus she had saved the
  price of another fare. Jo was passionate about everything&mdash;even
  thrift.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap5"
     name="chap5">5. LITTLE ARTHUR IN QUEST OF DRAWERS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Little Arthur's aggrieved meditations on the greater
  advantages enjoyed by second-storey men in providing themselves with the
  drawers of others had led him far afield. As a result of these meditations he
  had momentarily yielded to the temptation to stray adventurously a little
  outside the professional limits of his calling. Having established the fact
  that Central Park was virtually barren of loot of the smaller species, he
  found himself this afternoon wandering watchfully through the streets of the
  West 70's, his disarmingly mild blue eyes constantly on the alert for a
  convenient house to second-storey. Once he had selected a suitable subject
  for his nefarious project, he had certain ideas of his own in regard to
  carrying it to a successful conclusion.</p>

  <p>After tentatively weighing the pros and cons of an area-way that impressed
  his sensitive nature with its unmistakable air of good breeding, Little
  Arthur proceeded down it until it eventually terminated in Martha, one of the
  trimmest of the Van Dyck maids. The kitchen being unchaperoned at the moment,
  Little Arthur with his usual subtleness prevailed upon Martha to invite him
  in for a cup of tea. He achieved this by convincing the guileless maid that
  in him she was beholding not merely one of the offshoots but absolutely the
  very flower itself of depression.</p>

  <p>Presently, seated at the kitchen table and made confidential by a cup of
  tea, the two of them were bending their heads prettily over the tepidly
  glowing allurements of a spurious ruby ring.</p>

  <p>'Wouldn't be a bit surprised,' Little Arthur admitted softly, 'if that gem
  hasn't belonged in its time to one of them far-Indian potentates.'</p>

  <p>'No!' exclaimed young Martha. 'You don't mean ter say? One of them
  redskins like?'</p>

  <p>'How should I know,' put in Little Arthur, 'not ever rightly having seen
  the color of this here potentate's skin? May have been red. May have been
  brown. May have been as white as the back of me hand.'</p>

  <p>The back of Little Arthur's hand somewhat spoiled the effect of this ill-
  chosen comparison.</p>

  <p>'That far-Indian potentate wouldn't have been so white, at that,' remarked
  the maid, Martha, prompted no doubt by that nasty streak which lies ever
  close to the surface in all members of her sex.</p>

  <p>Little Arthur delicately removed his hand from the critical examination of
  the girl's frankly skeptical eyes.</p>

  <p>'It's the hand of an honest man, at any rate,' said he with a note of
  bitterness.</p>

  <p>'Mean ter say this old potentate's hands weren't strictly honest?'
  Martha's large grey eyes grew larger and a little frightened.</p>

  <p>'I keep telling you I never met this here far-Indian potentate,' Little
  Arthur protested, amazed by the hopeless irrelevance of the feminine mind.
  'But you know how them potentates are.'</p>

  <p>'No,' the girl admitted quite frankly. 'I don't know much about
  potentates. How are they, now?'</p>

  <p>'Well,' replied Little Arthur, heartily wishing he had never brought up
  the subject, 'you can't quite say how they are. They sort of take things when
  they fancy 'em&mdash;like women and gold and jewels.'</p>

  <p>'Maybe this jewel belonged to one of this potentate's women,' said Martha
  in an awed voice. 'Think of it! This jewel being on the hand of one of his
  favorite slaves! Guess she didn't need to wear much more than that.'</p>

  <p>Little Arthur embodied his disapproval of the trend of the girl's remarks
  in a slightly offended cough.</p>

  <p>'I hope,' he replied, 'that the lady who wore that ring was a step above a
  harem hussy.'</p>

  <p>'What's a harem really like, mister?' Martha asked him wistfully. 'I've
  often wanted ter know.'</p>

  <p>A gentle pink was finding its way into Little Arthur's ears. The
  conversation was becoming increasingly more difficult to maintain. Once more
  he endeavored to signify his disapproval through the medium of an especially
  refined cough.</p>

  <p>'Shouldn't think you'd want to fill your head with a lot of truck like
  that,' he observed with some severity.</p>

  <p>'But I do, mister,' pleaded the maid. 'Go on and tell me. The movies make
  'em fine.'</p>

  <p>Fearing lest refusal might endanger the outcome of his enterprise, Little
  Arthur compromised with his scruples as have many an artist before him. He
  made a brave attempt.</p>

  <p>'Well,' he began, 'a harem, properly speaking, is sort of like a nursery
  only for grown-ups, yer understand. It's a place where you sort of have fun
  in and lark about.'</p>

  <p>'I knew you had fun,' admitted Martha innocently, 'but I'd never heard
  about that nursery part before. Sounds kinda dull.'</p>

  <p>From beneath eyebrows arched in pain, Little Arthur distastefully regarded
  the girl.</p>

  <p>It's like that,' he said shortly. 'Dull. Now about this here jewel. I
  &mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Always thought I'd like to join one of them harem places,' Martha
  interrupted dreamily. 'Dancing all day and resting on piles of
  pillars...eating fruit and drinking wine and telling great big naked slaves
  to get a move on with them fans. Flies tickle something fierce when you ain't
  dressed for 'em.'</p>

  <p>Little Arthur's eyes were almost bulging from his head.</p>

  <p>'Just a minute,' he put in hastily to prevent further disgraceful
  admissions on the part of his alarming companion. 'Let's get back to this
  here potentate's jewel.'</p>

  <p>He had no intention of allowing the situation to develop any further along
  its present lines. He had insinuated himself into the good graces of this
  girl with a definite object in view. He had staked his professional
  reputation to procure what he firmly believed to be the most personal article
  of a gentleman's attire. It was far beyond the scope of his operations to
  jeopardize the integrity of his own in so doing. To victimize the maid was
  one thing. To become her victim was quite another. He would leave that sort
  of conduct to his betters.</p>

  <p>'All right, mister,' said the girl. 'What about that jewel?'</p>

  <p>'Now you're talking,' replied the little man, allowing a note of approval
  to rob his voice of its former austerity. 'I'll let this jewel go for less
  than nothing because of the tea and all.'</p>

  <p>'And how much is that in money?' the girl inquired nervously.</p>

  <p>'About two dollars,' he confided. 'And I should be shot for doing it.'</p>

  <p>Not for a moment suspecting how thoroughly the artful little man deserved
  to be shot, Martha rose from the table.</p>

  <p>'All right, mister,' she announced. 'I'll run upstairs and get my
  purse.'</p>

  <p>'Where's that?' he demanded.</p>

  <p>'Servants' quarters,' she told him. 'Top floor.' This suited Arthur's
  plans to perfection.</p>

  <p>'Don't be long,' he warned her as she turned to the service stairway.</p>

  <p>The moment the sound of her tripping feet had died away in the upper
  regions of the house, Little Arthur deposited the ring on the table and
  silently hastened up the stairs. Attaining the second floor with a thrill of
  elation, he crept up to the nearest door and listened. Then, like a half-
  starved shadow, he faded noiselessly into the room. It was a large, pleasant
  room&mdash;a man's room, he was quick to note&mdash;and heavy portières were
  hanging from the windows. Crossing swiftly to one of these, he looked out to
  ascertain the easiest means of exit. There was no easiest means of exit. It
  was a sheer drop to the street from every window. At that moment he heard the
  knob of the door turning. Little Arthur could not recall ever having listened
  to a more unwanted sound. Ducking round a table laden with bottles and a
  siphon, he secreted his small person with the deftness of desperation behind
  one of the portières. To have been released from his present predicament, not
  only would he have willingly sacrificed his prospects of ever obtaining the
  drawers of others but also tossed his own into the bargain as a gesture of
  goodwill.</p>

  <p>Peter Van Dyck, ruffled by the world in general and the subway in
  particular, slowly entered the room. Little Arthur, catching a furtive
  glimpse of his expression, decided that here indeed was a man who would
  regard none too favorably any slight familiarity from a member of the
  criminal class. Why had he, Little Arthur, not been satisfied with the
  drawers that had served him so long and well? Why had he allowed shallow
  frivolity to cloud and confound his discretion? All the drawers in all the
  world were not worth the anxiety he was experiencing there behind that
  curtain.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the small, unhappy man caught his breath. Good God! What next?
  The owner of the room was actually undressing. Could he be going to bed at
  this hour? What a glutton for sleep! But some men were like that, only they
  seldom stopped to undress. It was shoes and all with them. Suppose this chap
  took it into his head to sit up and read? He himself was given to that small
  relaxation after a difficult day. He might be forced to remain concealed
  until he fainted from sheer exhaustion. Little Arthur was becoming
  panic-stricken.</p>

  <p>While this scene was working up to its inevitable climax, Josephine Duval
  was resolutely ascending the front step of the Van Dyck residence. Just what
  she intended to do when she got inside, she had not the slightest idea.
  However, Jo was one of the world's most successful opportunists. Something
  would be sure to turn up. Something always did. But what turned up at first
  was not any too reassuring. This was no less a personage than Sanders, the
  Van Dyck butler.</p>

  <p>'Would you mind telling your mistress,' said Jo, neatly slipping past the
  great man, 'that there's a lady calling on her who is in an interesting
  condition?'</p>

  <p>Now this form of announcing herself, especially in view of the fact that
  it was entirely misleading if not worse, might strike some as being
  particularly ill-advised. However, Jo found herself in the position of one
  suddenly called upon to speak when there is absolutely nothing to say, and so
  she very wisely decided that it really did not matter much what she said so
  long as she said something&mdash;anything. Furthermore, it cannot be denied
  that her opening speech was not without an element of surprise. Even the
  impeccable Sanders found the information difficult to take in his stately
  stride.</p>

  <p>'Thank you, madam,' he replied, his suavity jarred a note off key. 'Has my
  mistress any special reason to be interested in your interesting condition,
  may I ask?'</p>

  <p>'No,' snapped Jo, 'but her nephew has. And while we're on the subject you
  might as well know that I'm not a madam yet. I'm still a miss, if in name
  only. And you'd better carry on with a click. My condition grows more
  interesting by leaps and bounds. Soon it may become engrossing.'</p>

  <p>Sanders had encountered many extraordinary young women in the course of a
  long and inactive career, but never one quite so buoyantly extraordinary as
  Josephine. She impressed the astonished butler as being actually exuberant
  over a situation which any properly constituted girl would have considered,
  if not desperate, at least disturbing.</p>

  <p>'I quite understand, miss,' he replied soothingly. 'If you'll pardon me a
  moment I'll withdraw to consult &mdash;'</p>

  <p>'And if I'm not here when you get back,' Jo broke in, 'you can look for my
  body in the nearest river&mdash;which one is that?'</p>

  <p>'The Hudson, miss,' said Sanders hopefully. 'About three blocks over to
  your left as you go out.'</p>

  <p>'You're almost too eagerly explicit,' Josephine observed as the butler
  turned a dignified back and departed.</p>

  <p>As soon as he had gone, Josephine looked quickly about her. From a room
  opening off the hall about ten feet away came the hum of conversation. Also
  the sound of clinking glasses. The cocktail tea-party was already getting
  under way. Josephine was greatly interested. She yearned to see everything
  &mdash;how these people lived and what they intended to do to Peter, who by
  now had become in her illogical mind irrevocably her man. Regardless of the
  laws of decency and self-respect, she must prevent this engagement. The door
  to what appeared to be a clothes closet presented itself as the most obvious
  means to this end. As she slipped into this closet and closed the door behind
  her, she was still assuring herself that something would turn up to delay the
  formal announcement of Peter's betrothal to that snake-hipped Yolanda
  Wilmont. The closet was fairly commodious, but without light. Innumerable
  unseen coats were hanging on all sides of the girl&mdash;fur coats, storm
  coats, top coats, motor robes, and dusters. Thinking how grandly the rich
  lived, she disappeared behind the coats and temporarily withdrew from active
  participation in the destiny of the Van Dycks.</p>

  <p>Above stairs, in his room, Peter was wondering if the shower-bath he fully
  intended to take was going to improve matters any. Did condemned men take
  showers before they faced the firing squad or marched to the chair? The only
  condemned man he knew anything about was himself, and what little he knew
  about him was hardly interesting enough to be told. However, things might be
  worse. He was not actually getting married to-day. There was always poison as
  a last resort. He wondered whether he should take it himself or give it to
  Yolanda.</p>

  <p>And while these speculations were passing through Peter's mind, equally
  perplexing ones were engaging the mind of Sanders as he stood in the hall
  below and looked round for signs of the vanished Jo. Presently he shrugged
  his shoulders as if to dismiss the incident. Evidently the young lady had
  decided in favor of the river. Under the circumstances that was probably the
  most tactful arrangement for all concerned. In spite of her bold manner the
  young woman must have had some sense of the fitness of things. Had he said
  the river was three or four blocks over? He did not quite recall. Too many
  things to think about. By now she should be quite definitely drowned if she
  had not changed her mind. She had seemed like a determined character, if a
  little callous. There were other things to be done. Cocktails to serve.
  Sanders moved away, leaving the hall deserted.</p>

  <p>Several times while undressing, Peter had approached dangerously close to
  the curtain behind which Little Arthur stood concealed. Altogether too close
  for the peace of mind of that small pickpocket. Now that his uninvited host
  was completely naked, there was the possibility he might be prompted by
  modesty to draw the curtains entirely. That was what Little Arthur would have
  done had he been in the same condition. Maybe the rich were different. Maybe
  they did not care. If he could only create some diversion, thought the man
  behind the curtain, some little distraction sufficient to occupy the other's
  attention long enough to enable one to get out of that fateful room.</p>

  <p>What could he do? Peter had turned and was looking intently at the
  portière. Had he noticed anything, any slight, betraying movement? Little
  Arthur broke out into a gentle sweat. Those eyes&mdash;those probing eyes. As
  soon as Peter looked away, the pickpocket's arm slid from behind the portière
  and withdrew with the siphon. Little Arthur had not the vaguest idea what he
  intended to do with the bottle, but at least it was better than having
  nothing at all, better than facing with bare hands an infuriated and naked
  property owner. Once more Peter's eyes strayed towards the portières. Why did
  he look at that one portière always instead of some other? Surely he
  suspected something. Yes. He did suspect something. He actually knew
  something. Once more he was approaching the portière. He was half way across
  the room, and naked as a primitive man. Little Arthur was as much unnerved by
  what he saw as by what he feared. His grip tightened on the object in his
  hand. Two-thirds across the room Peter stopped and, turning his bare back,
  reached down and meditatively scratched his leg as men will. This was a
  trick, Little Arthur decided. No man, unless fired by some sinister
  determination, would permit himself to appear in such an unfavorable light.
  Furthermore, the rich, if they took advantage of their opportunities, should
  have no occasion thus to scratch themselves. Little Arthur was not to be
  deceived. This was a trick. If Peter Van Dyck had been hoping to rattle the
  small criminal, he had virtually succeeded. To witness these preparations was
  even worse than facing the attack itself.</p>

  <p>It was at this moment that Little Arthur was seized by a mad impulse, an
  uncontrollable desire to squirt the contents of the siphon on the exposed
  back of the busily scratching man. It was an impulse not difficult to
  understand. Virtually every one is visited by it at least once in the course
  of his life. Some persons never outgrow it. To them a siphon and a naked back
  mean only one thing&mdash;immediate contact. At the moment Little Arthur had
  not sufficient mental stamina to resist any impulse. He raised the siphon,
  drew an accurate bead on the exposed surface, then pressed the lever. The
  liquid missile splashed smartly against Peter Van Dyck's back and broke into
  little cascades along the ridges of his spine. The effect was instantaneous.
  Peter snapped erect and looked wildly about him. Astonishment, shock, and
  indignation fought for ascendancy in his eyes. But his gaze encountered
  nothing enlightening. For a moment he feared for his reason. Was it possible
  that in his spiritual turmoil he had imagined himself under the shower? The
  water trickling down his flanks annoyed but reassured him. Then anger mounted
  within his breast. A Van Dyck would stand for no nonsense, especially a nude
  Van Dyck. The perpetrator of this outrage against his privacy and person must
  be concealed somewhere within the room. Probably behind one of those
  portières. Almost slithering with excitement, Peter warily advanced upon one
  of the hangings. That he had selected the wrong one did not rob his
  activities of interest. Little Arthur was interested and also a bit relieved.
  As a matter of fact he was even faintly amused. The idea of a naked man
  stalking an empty portière had its lighter side.</p>

  <p>As Peter, quivering with purpose, sprang upon his portière, Little Arthur,
  quivering with no less purpose, sprang from behind his and sprinted to the
  door. Reaching this before Peter had time to turn, the flying pickpocket
  dashed out into the hall and slammed the door behind him. The sound of the
  door brought Peter back to action. Passionately cursing the portière, he sped
  across the room and threw open the door. The intruder was gone, obviously
  having succeeded in putting the front flight of stairs between himself and
  pursuit. This time Peter was right. Little Arthur, tossing discretion to the
  winds, had nipped down the first flight of stairs that offered itself to his
  frantic feet. For a brief moment Peter hesitated in the doorway, then, adding
  decency to discretion, he tossed them both to the winds and took up the
  chase.</p>

  <p>On the landing he ran into Martha.</p>

  <p>'Gord, Mr. Peter!' She gasped 'Whacha doing?'</p>

  <p>'Running,' said Peter briefly. He had no time for explanations</p>

  <p>'I should say,' murmured the maid after his bare back. 'Running wild like
  Adam hisself.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap6"
     name="chap6">6. THE LOQUACIOUS CLOSET</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Peter's descent into the front hall fortunately went
  unnoticed. More guests had arrived, and more guests were due to arrive. It
  was this latter possibility that brought Peter to a full and blinding
  realization of his position. For the first time he saw himself as indubitably
  he would appear in the eyes of others. He saw himself not as an innocent man
  seeking justice, but simply as a stark naked coffee importer, dazzlingly
  greeting his guests at the doors of his ancestral home. The picture was
  somewhat too vivid for his nerves. He delivered the soul of his craven
  attacker into the arms of divine retribution and flung himself into the
  clothes closet a split second before Sanders appeared to answer the summons
  of the doorbell.</p>

  <p>Reaching out in the darkness, Peter's hand groped horrifyingly over a
  face. Now this is a decidedly disagreeable experience, perhaps one of the
  most disagreeable in the world. It is especially so when one is under the
  impression that there are no faces about. Even married people, after long
  years of propinquity, are frequently revolted when in the still hours of the
  night they inadvertently extend a hand and find themselves fumbling drowsily
  with the face of a mate. The same holds true even of one's mistress. One
  receives quite an unpleasant shock. With other parts of the body it is not so
  bad, but with the face, yes. It was certainly so with Peter. Had it not been
  for his nakedness, he would have emitted scream upon scream. Little Arthur,
  too, was far from well.</p>

  <p>'Who are you?' demanded Peter, his voice hoarse with consternation.</p>

  <p>'I'm Little Arthur,' chattered a voice in the darkness. 'You know, mister,
  the guy you was chasing.'</p>

  <p>If it had not been for the fact that every instinct in Peter's being cried
  out against further association with any part of Little Arthur, the man would
  have been strangled there and then in the blackness of the closet.</p>

  <p>'Sorry I squirted the water on you, mister,' the little dip began in
  mollifying accents.</p>

  <p>'It doesn't matter really,' said Peter with false politeness. 'I was going
  to take a shower, anyway. May I ask, though, what you were doing in my
  room?'</p>

  <p>'I'm a burglar,' replied Little Arthur, too depressed to be other than
  truthful. 'But I wasn't looking for anything valuable. Only a pair of
  drawers.'</p>

  <p>'If only I had a pair myself!' muttered Peter. 'And to think that just
  this morning I had more drawers than I needed&mdash;more than I could
  comfortably wear. What are you doing in here, Little Arthur?'</p>

  <p>'The same thing as you, sir. Keeping out of the public eye.'</p>

  <p>A moment's silence, then Peter's voice, nervously: 'You seem to be in
  front of me, and yet I distinctly feel you breathing heavily on my back. How
  do you manage that?'</p>

  <p>'I'm not doing it, mister,' said Little Arthur. 'I ain't got strength
  enough left to do any breathing at all.'</p>

  <p>'No?' replied Peter, turning. 'That's funny. Oh, my God! I'm
  surrounded.'</p>

  <p>He had thrust one of his fingers into Josephine's mouth, and she had
  instinctively bitten it for lack of anything better to do.</p>

  <p>'Remove your finger from my mouth this instant,' she gabbled
  furiously.</p>

  <p>Peter's hand was quicker than the eye.</p>

  <p>'What are you doing in here with Little Arthur?' he demanded, nursing his
  damaged finger.</p>

  <p>'I hadn't thought of doing anything with Little Arthur,' Jo retorted.
  'Don't even know what to do with myself, much less with any one else. He must
  have come in here after me.'</p>

  <p>'The dirty little crook!' said Peter. 'I'll strangle him with these two
  bare hands right here in cold blood.'</p>

  <p>Little Arthur closed his eyes, yet still saw two bare hands floating
  through the darkness.</p>

  <p>'Go on and do it,' urged Josephine. 'There are too many of us in this
  closet already.'</p>

  <p>'I don't want to be in here alone with you,' Peter told her. 'And the dead
  body of a criminal, perhaps.'</p>

  <p>'It won't make any difference so long as the body is good and dead,' Jo
  explained.</p>

  <p>'Oh, what a terrible woman!' Little Arthur chattered from his corner.
  'Where did she come from?'</p>

  <p>'Don't know why you followed her in the first place,' said Peter.</p>

  <p>'I won't ever again,' vowed the little man. 'Didn't even know she was
  here.'</p>

  <p>'He's a nasty little liar,' whispered Josephine. 'He deliberately came in
  after me.'</p>

  <p>'Don't you believe her, mister,' Little Arthur pleaded. 'She's trying to
  turn you against me just as we were getting along, like. I know her
  game.'</p>

  <p>'Shut up, you rat!' the girl flung at him. 'I'll claw your wicked tongue
  out.'</p>

  <p>'Don't let her at me, please, mister,' Little Arthur put in. 'She wants to
  get us both in trouble.'</p>

  <p>'We are in trouble,' Peter reminded him. 'Terrible trouble. Suppose some
  one should come barging into this closet?'</p>

  <p>'I'll swear I was lured in,' said Jo.</p>

  <p>'On what pretext?' Peter demanded.</p>

  <p>'A fur coat,' she answered readily.</p>

  <p>'Wouldn't speak well for your morals,' he snapped.</p>

  <p>'Nor any better for yours,' she replied. 'But if you don't like that, I'll
  say that the two of you dragged me in.'</p>

  <p>'Wouldn't put it past her, mister,' warned Little Arthur. 'She's a bad
  one, she is. Glad I can't see her.'</p>

  <p>'You horrid little crook!' shrilled Jo. 'Where do you get off?'</p>

  <p>I'll have to ask you both to shut up,' said Peter. 'You'll be having the
  whole damn house in.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, dear,' murmured Jo. 'Here I am cooped up in a closet with a naked man
  and a thief. I don't know which way to turn.'</p>

  <p>'Well, don't turn this way,' said Peter. 'And how do you know I'm naked?
  Oh, for God's own sake, is that your hand? I've been thinking it was mine all
  the time. I'm so upset. No wonder you know how I am.'</p>

  <p>In the darkness Jo laughed evilly.</p>

  <p>'I saw your impassioned entrance,' she gloated.</p>

  <p>'If you don't keep your hands off, you'll see my impassioned exit,' he
  retorted.</p>

  <p>'All women seem ter be loose,' muttered Little Arthur moodily, his
  thoughts reverting to Martha and the harem. 'Weren't like that when I was a
  boy.'</p>

  <p>'You're no bigger than a nipper now,' retorted Jo.</p>

  <p>'Perhaps not,' said the pickpocket, 'but I got more sense. Why don't you
  keep your bold hands off the gentleman? He don't understand your common
  ways.'</p>

  <p>'I'll make them unmistakable,' said the girl.</p>

  <p>'What are we going ter do, mister?' Little Arthur asked hopelessly. 'There
  ain't no good in her.'</p>

  <p>'Why don't you do something?' demanded Peter. 'You got me into this.'</p>

  <p>'No, I didn't,' the pickpocket protested. 'I was trying to get away and
  you insisted on following me.'</p>

  <p>'Naturally,' replied Peter.</p>

  <p>'Must have wanted me mighty bad,' observed Little Arthur, 'to have
  followed me in your condition.'</p>

  <p>'I wanted to kill you,' admitted Peter, 'and I'm not at all sure I
  won't.'</p>

  <p>'Don't think about it any more,' said Little Arthur soothingly.</p>

  <p>'My, you're thin,' said Jo in a surprised voice.</p>

  <p>'Take your hand from my ribs,' Peter commanded. 'Haven't you any
  shame?'</p>

  <p>'No,' answered Jo promptly. 'Not since you started in. This morning in the
  office you try to take off your drawers. On the way home you practically
  assaulted me in the subway. And now to cap the damn climax you follow me
  nakedly into a dark closet. How do you expect a girl to have any shame left
  when you act like that?'</p>

  <p>'Is that right, lady?' asked Little Arthur, thinking that indeed he had
  got himself into bad company. 'Did he do all them things, taking off his
  drawers and all?'</p>

  <p>'Sure, I'm right,' said Jo. 'It was just his drawers this morning. That
  seemed to satisfy him. Now it's all or nothing. Don't know what he'll think
  of doing next.'</p>

  <p>'Hope he stops thinking altogether if he's going ter carry on like that,'
  said Little Arthur, making no attempt to disguise his disappointment in
  Peter.</p>

  <p>'Some one will have to do some inspired brainwork to think us out of this
  place,' Peter announced to his unseen companions.</p>

  <p>'Does your spine begin there?' Josephine suddenly asked in an interested
  voice.</p>

  <p>'No,' replied Peter passionately. 'That's where it ends.'</p>

  <p>'Oh,' said the girl rather hurriedly. 'I'm sorry.'</p>

  <p>'Then why don't you keep your hands to yourself?' demanded Peter.</p>

  <p>'Thank Gord it's dark in here,' murmured Little Arthur. 'I wouldn't know
  where to look if it wasn't.'</p>

  <p>'Throw the little beggar out on his ear,' urged Jo.</p>

  <p>'Think I'll get out myself, naked as I am,' declared Peter. 'It's better
  than staying in here and being explored like a map.'</p>

  <p>For some minutes Sanders had been evincing an unusual interest in the
  closet. Aunt Sophie, sailing from the drawing-room with a group of guests at
  her elbows, chief among whom was Yolanda, actually saw the man with his ear
  almost if not quite pressed to the door.</p>

  <p>'What on earth are you doing there, Sanders?' she inquired fussily. 'You
  look as if you had seen a ghost.'</p>

  <p>Sanders nodded his sleek head wisely.</p>

  <p>'I believe I'm hearing them, madam,' he vouchsafed in a low voice. 'This
  closet suddenly seems to be endowed with the gift of speech.'</p>

  <p>'Nonsense!' the splendid lady tossed out. 'You're running down, Sanders.
  Closets don't talk.'</p>

  <p>'This one does,' Sanders assured her. 'It carries on a three-cornered
  conversation in as many different voices, madam. One sounds strangely like a
  woman's.'</p>

  <p>'What?' exclaimed Aunt Sophie. 'A woman in that closet? That is
  queer.'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps Sanders had better look,' Yolanda Wilmont suggested. 'Sneak
  thieves, you know.'</p>

  <p>'Sneak thieves are not given to holding animated conversations in
  closets,' objected Mr. Prescott Gates, who, because of his remote connection
  with a law firm, felt that his knowledge of sneak thieves was more extensive
  than the others.</p>

  <p>'We're not acquainted with the habits of sneak thieves,' Yolanda
  contributed coldly. 'However, I do believe that closet should be
  investigated. There are several valuable furs inside.'</p>

  <p>'By all means,' agreed Miss Sophie Van Dyck. 'Open the door immediately,
  Sanders.'</p>

  <p>But the door, when Sanders endeavored to carry out this order, seemed
  inclined to argue the point. For several moments it quivered elastically like
  a thing of life and purpose in the hands of the butler; then, with a groan of
  utter despair which sounded hollowly in the hall, it flew partly open.
  Sanders recoiled as if from the pit of hell itself. Instantly the door closed
  of its own volition with a bang of remonstrance. Inarticulate sounds issued
  from the closet, sounds of whining protest.</p>

  <p>'What on earth is it, Sanders?' Aunt Sophie demanded in a strained voice.
  'Sounds like an animal.'</p>

  <p>'Must I say, Miss Van Dyck?' asked Sanders in a cornered voice.</p>

  <p>'Certainly you must,' she retorted. 'What would Mr. Peter think if he came
  home and found his closet full of strangers? He dislikes things like
  that.'</p>

  <p>Wondering in a dazed sort of way what things could be even remotely like
  the things he had momentarily glimpsed, Sanders looked speculatively at the
  door.</p>

  <p>'Hurry, Sanders. What's inside?' Yolanda Wilmont asked insistently.</p>

  <p>'Well, madam,' said Sanders reluctantly, 'there seems to be more in there
  than valuable furs at the moment. Looked like quite a gathering to me.'</p>

  <p>'Tell them to come out this instant,' Miss Van Dyck commanded.</p>

  <p>'I'd hardly suggest that, madam,' said Sanders in a shocked voice.</p>

  <p>'Here, Sanders,' put in Prescott Gates. 'I'll handle this situation. I'll
  jolly well make them come out, whoever they are.'</p>

  <p>I strongly advise against it, sir,' said Sanders. 'Not with the ladies
  present, if I may say so.'</p>

  <p>'What on earth, Sanders?' exclaimed a young and rather swagger-looking
  maiden whose eyes gave the impression of having seen about all there was to
  be seen in life. 'Just for that I'll never leave until that closet has given
  up its dead.'</p>

  <p>'Why not tell us, Sanders,' remarked a stout lady in cascades of lace,
  'exactly what you saw, and then let us decide?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' agreed Aunt Sophie. 'We're growing decidedly impatient with all
  this beating about the bush. Speak up, man!'</p>

  <p>'Well,' began the butler in a voice of academic detachment, 'you see,
  there seems to be an entirely naked gentleman in that closet &mdash;'</p>

  <p>Impossible!' exclaimed Miss Van Dyck.</p>

  <p>'I very much wish it were, madam,' Sanders continued piously. 'But that's
  not all. This gentleman has either been undressed by a lady or, having
  undressed himself, is about to undress her.'</p>

  <p>'Need you be so graphic?' inquired Yolanda.</p>

  <p>'The picture was remarkably vivid,' explained the butler.</p>

  <p>'I wonder where they think they are?' Aunt Sophie wondered aloud.</p>

  <p>'Certainly not at a private reception,' observed the lacy lady, regarding
  the door with thoughtful eyes. 'That is, not at a nice reception.'</p>

  <p>'What can they be doing in that closet?' Aunt Sophie continued,
  bemused.</p>

  <p>'Practically anything by now,' said the girl with the worldly eyes.
  'Especially if the gentleman has succeeded in carrying out his
  intentions.'</p>

  <p>'You mean in that closet?' Yolanda demanded incredulously.</p>

  <p>'What's wrong with the closet?' demanded the other girl philosophically.
  'Many have managed with less.'</p>

  <p>'What a shocking situation!' murmured the lace-bedecked lady. 'Shouldn't
  something be done? Can't you speak to them, Sanders&mdash;admonish them?'</p>

  <p>'Certainly, madam,' replied Sanders, his suavity re-gained. 'How would you
  suggest wording it?'</p>

  <p>'Why, tell them to stop, of course,' Aunt Sophie snapped irritably.</p>

  <p>'Stop what, madam,' the butler inquired.</p>

  <p>'You can be most exasperating at times for a man of your age, Sanders,'
  Miss Van Dyck complained. 'Tell them to stop whatever they're doing.'</p>

  <p>'But, madam,' the butler patiently explained, 'we're not sure just what
  they are doing. It would be pure speculation.'</p>

  <p>'Not so pure at that,' put in the girl, 'but it does seem logical, doesn't
  it, Sanders?'</p>

  <p>'I must confess, Miss Sedgwick,' said Sanders, with becoming modesty, 'I
  have never been in the same situation.'</p>

  <p>'No more have I,' the girl retorted, 'but I can use my imagination.'</p>

  <p>'I wish you wouldn't,' Yolanda remarked frigidly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Prescott Gates now felt called upon once more to display his greater
  knowledge of the seamy side of life.</p>

  <p>'If they are professional sneak thieves,' he advanced weightily, 'I hardly
  think they'd endanger their chances by that sort of nonsense.'</p>

  <p>'What sort of nonsense?' Miss Sedgwick inquired with disarming innocence.
  'And what makes you call it nonsense?'</p>

  <p>'Don't answer her, Prescott,' said Yolanda.</p>

  <p>'And all this time we're talking here,' Aunt Sophie burst forth in a
  tragic voice, 'God only knows what is going on inside that closet.'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps only God should know,' replied the stout lady, with the
  resignation of a true believer.</p>

  <p>'I have an idea,' Miss Sedgwick offered. 'Perhaps a man and wife wandered
  into that closet and not being able to find their way out became so exhausted
  &mdash;you know, so discouraged about it all&mdash;they just decided to go to
  bed.'</p>

  <p>'Don't be childish, Madge Sedgwick,' Aunt Sophie scolded.</p>

  <p>'Well, at least, I've got 'em married,' said the girl. 'That's more than
  any of you have done.'</p>

  <p>'You said a "gentleman," Sanders,' Aunt Sophie went on in a worried voice
  to the butler. 'Are you sure he was a gentleman?'</p>

  <p>'That's difficult to tell, madam,' said Sanders. 'He didn't have a stitch
  on.'</p>

  <p>'I can well understand that,' Madge Sedgwick agreed sympathetically.
  'Without any clothes on there's not a scrap of difference between a sneak
  thief and a gentleman.'</p>

  <p>'I should think all naked men would look a little sneaky,' the lady in
  lace unhelpfully contributed.</p>

  <p>"There should be some distinction,' Miss Van Dyck protested
  indignantly.</p>

  <p>'Yes. It would be convenient on occasions to be able to tell at a glance,'
  Madge Sedgwick remarked as if to herself.</p>

  <p>'What did he look like, Sanders?' Yolanda Wilmont demanded. 'Did you
  recognize his face?'</p>

  <p>'I didn't see his face, Miss Yolanda,' the butler explained. 'What did you
  see?' asked Madge with lively interest.</p>

  <p>'His back, miss,' said Sanders. 'He turned it rather briskly, I
  thought.'</p>

  <p>'At least he had the instincts of a gentleman,' remarked the stout
  lady.</p>

  <p>'Oh, I don't know,' Madge Sedgwick countered. 'Even a sneak thief might
  have his little qualms.'</p>

  <p>'Did you recognize the woman?' Prescott Gates inquired.</p>

  <p>'I got the impression I'd seen her before, sir,' admitted the butler.
  'Looked very much like a young woman who was here a little earlier announcing
  she was in an interesting condition.'</p>

  <p>'Sanders, you keep the most extraordinary things to yourself,' Aunt Sophie
  said with severity. 'Do you mean to say you put this person in that closet to
  bear her child?'</p>

  <p>'No, madam,' Sanders smoothly replied. 'I rather concluded she'd left to
  commit suicide. She was inquiring about the rivers. I gave her adequate
  directions.'</p>

  <p>'Maybe she came back to find out which was the deepest,' Madge Sedgwick
  suggested.</p>

  <p>'Heavens on earth!' exclaimed Aunt Sophie distractedly. 'What are we going
  to do? Here we have a naked man in the closet and a woman going to have a
  baby or commit suicide or something even worse. Prescott, you're a man. Why
  don't you suggest something?'</p>

  <p>'I'm going for a policeman,' Mr. Gates replied with surprising decision as
  he hurried to the door.</p>

  <p>'Should think a preacher or a doctor would do better according to the
  circumstances,' Madge flung after him, but Mr. Gates was already gone.</p>

  <p>'That tears it,' whispered Peter Van Dyck to his companions in the closet.
  'That unweaned ass has gone to get a cop.'</p>

  <p>'Gord!' breathed Little Arthur. 'There ain't a pair of drawers made that's
  worth a pinch.'</p>

  <p>'Ah,' came the voice of Josephine, 'how about mine, Little Arthur?'</p>

  <p>'Make her stop talking like that, mister,' the small thief asked in an
  injured voice. 'We're in a very bad spot.'</p>

  <p>'Don't tell me,' said Peter. 'I know it already, and I'm going to get out
  of my section at once.'</p>

  <p>'Don't mean ter say you're going out there in front of all them people the
  way you are?' the man inquired in an awed voice.</p>

  <p>'Almost,' Peter told him. 'With the addition of this coat.'</p>

  <p>Fumbling in the darkness, he seized the first coat his hands encountered
  and squeezed himself into it. Fortunately for Peter's self-assurance he was
  unable to see how he looked. He was wearing a fur coat belonging to his Aunt
  Sophie. It was short but luckily full.</p>

  <p>'Wait a second,' said Josephine. 'You're not going to leave me alone in
  here with that dip. I'm going to disguise myself, too.'</p>

  <p>'No fear,' shot back Little Arthur. 'I don't associate with the likes of
  you.'</p>

  <p>'Oh!' cried Josephine, enraged. 'I'll strip him to the buff.'</p>

  <p>'What's that?' asked Arthur anxiously.</p>

  <p>'I don't know,' the girl replied, 'but it must be awful.'</p>

  <p>'Will you two please stop bickering?' cut in Peter. 'Or wait until I've
  gone.'</p>

  <p>'I'm ready,' said Jo. 'Go right ahead. I defy recognition.'</p>

  <p>'What have you got on?' Peter was interested enough to inquire.</p>

  <p>'Goggles and a long duster,' the girl said briefly.</p>

  <p>'Let's change?' Peter suggested.</p>

  <p>'Too late now,' she told him. 'We've got to hurry right along.'</p>

  <p>'Don't leave me here alone,' Little Arthur pleaded.</p>

  <p>'I'd like to leave you lifeless,' Jo informed him.</p>

  <p>'Almost wish you would,' bleakly Arthur replied.</p>

  <p>The policeman, followed importantly by Prescott Gates, arrived just in
  time to witness the emergence of Peter Van Dyck. What struck the officer as
  being especially remarkable about this odd affair was the length and bareness
  of Peter's legs. In real life Peter's legs were not really so bad. Though
  long and slim they were at least not distorted. They were just ordinary male
  legs, which are never much to get excited about. Now, however, protruding as
  they were from a woman's fur coat, they fairly screamed for attention. The
  officer's eyes responded. He could not recall ever having seen such
  peculiar-looking legs on either man or beast. In spite of this they seemed to
  carry their owner along busily enough as he made for the front staircase.
  Behind him trailed a strange object which at first glance did not appear to
  be entirely human. Josephine in goggles and duster hurried to the front door,
  where she was stopped by the officer, who told her, 'Oh, no, you don't!' in
  what can only be described as a nasty voice. Little Arthur, apparently
  preferring arrest to being left alone with his thoughts, brought up a
  shrinking rear. Walking nervously on tiptoe, he started to follow Peter. Aunt
  Sophie's voice stopped him. Aunt Sophie's voice stopped every one, in
  fact.</p>

  <p>'Peter!' she cried. 'Peter!'</p>

  <p>'Yes, Aunt Sophie,' Peter replied in a natural tone which contrasted
  strangely with his attire and which almost stupefied the policeman, who had
  expected something entirely different from such an object. 'Yes, Aunt Sophie.
  Were you calling me?'</p>

  <p>'Peter,' continued the outraged lady, 'what in the world have you been up
  to?'</p>

  <p>'Nothing at all, Auntie,' he assured her, growing more uncomfortably aware
  of a sea of upturned faces. 'Merely getting ready, you know. Making little
  arrangements.'</p>

  <p>'Is that person following you?' Miss Van Dyck demanded, pointing a
  quivering finger at Little Arthur, shaking as unobtrusively as possible on
  the stairs.</p>

  <p>Peter stared visibly. He found himself extremely nervous.</p>

  <p>'What person?' he gasped; then, glancing back and encountering the mute
  appeal in the miserable little creature's eyes, his heart melted. 'Oh, that
  person,' he said hastily. 'Yes. He's following me&mdash;how do you do,
  everybody.' Here Peter thought it best to bow carelessly to those below him.
  'Yes, Aunt Sophie,' he hurried on. 'He's following me. I asked him to. He's
  helping me to get ready. My new valet. Do you like him?'</p>

  <p>'Decidedly not!' exploded Aunt Sophie. 'He has the face of a born
  criminal.'</p>

  <p>'Say,' put in the policeman, 'how many more of you are there in that
  closet?'</p>

  <p>'What, officer?' said Peter. 'How many more of me are there in that
  closet? No more at all. I'm the only one.'</p>

  <p>'Does your nephew happen to be nuts, lady?' the policeman asked Miss Van
  Dyck.</p>

  <p>'No,' Yolanda answered for the stunned woman, 'but I fear he's suffering a
  little from overwork.'</p>

  <p>'Thank you, Yolanda,' called Peter, with a fearful smile.' But if you want
  to know, I'm suffering hideously from over-exposure.'</p>

  <p>'The coat! The coat!' shouted Madge. 'It's slipping, Peter. Look out!'</p>

  <p>Peter snatched at the coat in the nick of time, then waved lightly to the
  girl, who of all the group had not averted her eyes.</p>

  <p>'Thanks, Madge,' he called. 'Wouldn't want that to happen.'</p>

  <p>'I wasn't anxious about it for myself,' she replied. 'I was thinking of
  your aunt and Yolanda.'</p>

  <p>'Thanks,' Yolanda told her. 'We are quite able to think for
  ourselves.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, very well,' said Miss Sedgwick. 'I don't care if he takes it off
  altogether and dances like a savage.'</p>

  <p>'No doubt,' said the other sweetly.</p>

  <p>'If it's all the same to you ladies,' called Peter, 'I'd prefer to keep it
  on. And I don't feel like dancing.'</p>

  <p>'My stockings! My stockings! They're gone!' burst suddenly from the object
  behind the goggles, making a frantic dash for the closet, only to be brought
  up in mid-flight at the end of the officer's arm.</p>

  <p>'None of that,' he said rudely. 'You're staying here.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, am I?' Jo replied, dealing him a clever Gallic kick. 'I want my
  stockings.'</p>

  <p>'Ah-ha,' observed Madge Sedgwick triumphantly. 'Then he did undress
  her.'</p>

  <p>Probably because they assumed it to be a part of a policeman's duty, no
  one seemed to pay the slightest attention to the officer doubled up in
  anguish. That is, no one save Little Arthur, who, for the moment forgetting
  his own troubles in the presence of those of the law, was laughing weakly
  upon the stairs.</p>

  <p>'Did it hurt much?' solicitously asked Peter, who from his Olympian
  heights had witnessed the incident.</p>

  <p>'Hurt?' gasped the policeman, stung by the inadequacy of the word. 'It's
  ruined I am to the grave.'</p>

  <p>'See what you've done to our police force,' said Peter, looking down on
  Josephine clawing in the closet.</p>

  <p>'Can't help that,' she answered. 'No low cop can come between me and my
  stockings.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, this is too disgraceful,' Sophie Van Dyck informed all present. 'Too
  disgraceful for words.'</p>

  <p>'Not disgraceful enough for my words,' muttered Josephine. 'Ah! Here they
  are&mdash;my stockings!'</p>

  <p>As the girl rose with a wad of stockings in her hand, Sophie Van Dyck
  directed on her the full force of her attack.</p>

  <p>'Young woman,' she demanded, 'did you tell my butler you were going to
  have a baby?'</p>

  <p>'After being cooped up in that closet with your naked nephew,' Jo replied
  indignantly as she stuffed the stockings back in their tender concealment,
  allowing one of them to dangle untidily down the front of the duster, 'after
  being in there like that, I wouldn't be a bit surprised if I had a male
  quartet. Would you?'</p>

  <p>Miss Van Dyck saw no good in being dragged into this discussion.</p>

  <p>'May I ask if you have anything on beneath that duster?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'What do you think?' replied Josephine. 'What has he got on beneath that
  fur coat?'</p>

  <p>As she pointed to the odd figure on the stairs, every one looked up and
  decided it did not have much. Before the direct fire of so many calculating
  glances Peter shrank a little. By this time the injured officer had
  discovered he could stand erect.</p>

  <p>'What are you laughing at?' he demanded reproachfully of Little
  Arthur.</p>

  <p>'At them,' said Little Arthur, pointing to the legs above him.</p>

  <p>'What!' cried Peter, turning fiercely upon the pick-pocket. 'You lying
  little &mdash;'</p>

  <p>Don't say it, mister,' Arthur pleaded. 'I wasn't laughing at all.'</p>

  <p>'You'll be hysterical when I get you up before the boys,' the assaulted
  policeman promised him.</p>

  <p>'Aunt Sophie,' Yolanda said in a low voice, 'there can be no announcement
  to-day. This has spoiled everything.'</p>

  <p>'I agree with that,' Aunt Sophie replied. 'But just the same we'll carry
  on as if nothing had occurred. Take our dear guests back to the reception
  room.'</p>

  <p>'Hurrah!' cried Jo, tossing up her arms, the hands of which lay concealed
  well down in the sleeves of the duster. 'You're saved, Peter. You're
  saved.'</p>

  <p>'Saved for what?' he asked her. 'Another day?'</p>

  <p>'For us, of course,' she replied. 'For me!'</p>

  <p>'A living death,' he answered.</p>

  <p>'Gord spare you, sir, from that one,' put in Little Arthur piously. 'No
  matter what you've done.'</p>

  <p>The bell rang, and Sanders, as if arising from a long illness, admitted
  several guests. With startled eyes they regarded the group on the stairs,
  then transferred their gaze to the enigmatic figure lurking within the
  voluminous folds of the duster. It was peering at them like a strange bird
  from behind a pair of goggles.</p>

  <p>'What's that?' asked a tall gentleman, his face growing pale beneath a
  fresh massage.</p>

  <p>'Don't know,' gasped a lady with him. 'It's awful. And Peter Van Dyck is
  almost...' Her voice trailed away.</p>

  <p>'It's charades, my dear,' Aunt Sophie smoothly explained. 'It's been such
  a lark, Yolanda, take them directly to the drawing-room. Cocktails.'</p>

  <p>Yolanda did.</p>

  <p>'Now, young lady,' Aunt Sophie continued severely, 'your conduct has been
  most disgraceful. I don't know what to do with you. Obviously you are a thief
  &mdash;perhaps even worse. You must leave this house at once, quietly and
  without further violence. You will, of course, leave the stolen articles
  behind.'</p>

  <p>'They're not so hot, anyway,' said Jo.</p>

  <p>'And they're not stolen,' called Peter momentarily feeling sorry for the
  small, defiant creature looking a little lonely in the great hall. 'I'll
  explain everything, Auntie. You see, I'm sending those things over to one of
  my friends. He's going on a trip. Wanted to borrow them. Sent one of the
  maids&mdash;a fresh piece. I admit&mdash;but that's how she got here.'</p>

  <p>'But why is she wearing them in that ridiculous fashion?' Aunt Sophie
  persisted, her curiosity overcoming her eagerness to believe in any
  comfortable explanation.</p>

  <p>'Oh, that,' replied Peter, thinking quickly. 'More convenient, you know.
  Doesn't nave to carry them. Perhaps it even amuses her.'</p>

  <p>'Well, it doesn't amuse me,' declared Aunt Sophie with conviction.</p>

  <p>'Come, Little Arthur,' said Peter. 'Get me ready.'</p>

  <p>He paused and looked back at Jo, who had snatched off the goggles and was
  standing gazing up at him like a child about to be sent to bed: a child,
  Peter decided, who certainly should not be allowed to sleep alone.</p>

  <p>'Good-bye, mister,' she said. 'And thanks for all the things you've done
  &mdash;even though you shouldn't have.'</p>

  <p>Jo made sure that Yolanda, emerging from the drawing-room, overheard her
  parting remark.</p>

  <p>'Hold on!' cried the officer. 'Don't I make no pinch?'</p>

  <p>'Pinch yourself, brother,' said Jo. 'You're sleeping on your feet.'</p>

  <p>The front door closed behind her.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap7"
     name="chap7">7. SIX CHARACTERS EMBARK IN A FOG</a></h2>

  <p class="first">When Peter Van Dyck closed the door to his room his action
  was accompanied by such violence that Little Arthur, doglike at his heels,
  barely escaped bisection. Unlike a dog, however, the small, dishonest man
  emitted no yelp of protest. He merely stood looking at the door and thought
  of the policeman whose indignant voice still sounded discordantly in the hall
  below.</p>

  <p>'Sanders,' he heard Aunt Sophie saying, 'take the officer to the kitchen
  and provide for him properly. Perhaps a bottle or so of that Canadian ale
  might help to relieve his pain.'</p>

  <p>Little Arthur's heart sank. Retreat was cut off in the rear. Ahead of him
  lay a decidedly delicate, not to say dangerous, interview. Squaring his thin
  shoulders, he raised a timid hand and knocked.</p>

  <p>'Come in, you criminal!' a hoarse voice shouted. 'Since when have you
  troubled to knock on doors?'</p>

  <p>Automatically the shoulders resumed their former droop of nervous
  exhaustion as the criminal entered the room.</p>

  <p>'Since when have you troubled to knock?' the voice repeated disagreeably.
  'Answer me that.'</p>

  <p>Arthur noticed with increasing dread that the owner of the voice was
  drinking whisky straight in great gulps.</p>

  <p>'Always knock, mister,' he muttered. 'Outa hours, that is.'</p>

  <p>'When not calling in a professional capacity,' Peter added
  sarcastically.</p>

  <p>'That would be silly,' said Little Arthur on the defensive.</p>

  <p>'You malignant germ!' replied Peter, his throat working horribly, Arthur
  thought, as whisky splashed down its bobbing length. 'You less than louse
  &mdash;worse than louse!'</p>

  <p>'Mister,' protested Little Arthur, for some strange reason feeling more
  hurt for the other's lack of refinement than for any reflection cast on
  either himself or his habits, 'is that a nice way ter talk?'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps not,' said Peter after a moment's reflection. 'There isn't any
  nice way to talk&mdash;not to you.'</p>

  <p>'But I'm only a pickpocket,' the man modestly explained. 'This was my
  first second-storey.'</p>

  <p>Peter gulped down some more whisky while considering this statement.</p>

  <p>'How do you mean,' he asked, 'your first second-storey? Are you trying to
  confuse me?'</p>

  <p>'No, mister,' said the little dip, 'I'm giving it to you straight. This is
  the first time I ever done a second-storey. I was only after some drawers
  &mdash;an old pair or so.'</p>

  <p>'You lie,' Peter told him. 'You know as well as I do you couldn't wear my
  drawers. They'd hang all over your little wizened legs.'</p>

  <p>'I ain't perticular,' Little Arthur said stoutly. 'Scrunch 'em on somehow,
  what with a pin or a string or an old nail, for that matter.'</p>

  <p>Peter thought this possibility over while absently re-donning his recently
  shed raiment.</p>

  <p>'You must be mad about drawers,' he admitted at last, 'and I don't care a
  damn if you are. Might be much worse. As a matter of fact, some nice, clean
  persons might even consider it creditable, Little Arthur, for a man to risk
  losing his shirt for the sake of a pair of drawers. But I, who don't care a
  snap of my fingers about either shirt or drawers, can't see it in that
  light.'</p>

  <p>'That's a powerful queer-looking pair you got on now,' vouchsafed Little
  Arthur. 'Orange stripes, no less! Can't say as I'd care a lot for them
  drawers myself.'</p>

  <p>'Critical, eh?' Peter remarked coldly. 'Well, I'd like to know what sat
  you up in judgment on my drawers? You never had a pair of silk drawers on
  your mean little shanks in your life. Not real silk,' he added, his thoughts
  reverting to Josephine Duval.</p>

  <p>'No, mister,' Little Arthur agreed. 'I wear regular drawers&mdash;men's
  drawers. After taking a pike at them things, I can see that all my trouble
  has been a sheer waste of time.'</p>

  <p>'Just for that,' said Peter, with a whisky glitter in his eye, 'I'm going
  to make you wear a pair of my drawers, the funniest pair I've got, and
  believe me, I've got some funny ones. Much funnier than these,' his voice
  trailed on as he rummaged busily in a bureau. 'Ha! This pair's a humdinger. A
  regular scream. You'll go well in these. Wonder how I was ever so mad as to
  buy them myself. Red and purple grapes&mdash;bunches of 'em. A cute idea.' He
  turned with the garment to confront the stricken eyes of the petty felon.
  'Down with those trousers,' he grated. 'Yank 'em off with a snap.'</p>

  <p>'But, mister,' objected the shocked man, 'I'd have to undress naked to put
  them things on. You see, I wear allovers like&mdash;long legs and all.'</p>

  <p>'Eh?' said Peter. 'Oh, all right. That doesn't matter a bit. You can drag
  'em up over your long ones. Make it snappy now.'</p>

  <p>'That wouldn't look right, mister.' Arthur's voice was eloquent with
  reproach.</p>

  <p>'You're going to wear these drawers,' Peter told the pitiful object, 'if I
  have to disjoint you to get 'em on. Hurry up, man. Don't make me lose my
  temper.'</p>

  <p>'If you make me put them dreadful drawers on,' said the other, 'I think
  I'll lose my mind.'</p>

  <p>'You'll lose more than that if you don't,' Peter snapped, taking a step
  towards the man.</p>

  <p>'Oh, Gord,' whined the unfortunate creature, hastily removing his outer
  garments, 'all this terror and disgrace just because I got a yen ter feel
  clean!'</p>

  <p>'You don't look so hot, yourself,' Peter assured him as he contemplated
  the homely lines of the battered union suit. 'From the back you look simply
  shocking&mdash;worse than I ever thought a man could get.'</p>

  <p>Little Arthur spun round as if stung.</p>

  <p>'Cut it out,' he said in some confusion.</p>

  <p>'Now yank these on right over them,' commanded Peter. 'Anything to blot
  out that awful sight. The back especially.'</p>

  <p>Little Arthur yanked them on, and Peter was vividly reminded of a medieval
  court chamberlain who had fallen upon evil days.</p>

  <p>A knock sounded obsequiously on the door. Sanders entered on silent feet.
  Even his iron self-control was taxed to its utmost to restrain a slight
  outcry. All the human side of the butler cried out to inquire what
  inconceivable events were taking place in this room. However, his
  professional ethics forced him to present a passive face. In his eyes alone
  could be detected a faint gleam of revulsion. The expression in Little
  Arthur's eyes as he stood like a shamed maiden in a slave market, as well he
  might in his weird attire, defied all description. This was because Little
  Arthur, realizing the delicacy of his position, had bashfully lowered his
  gaze. Sanders cleared his throat behind a large fat hand.</p>

  <p>'Beg pardon, Mr. Peter,' he murmured. 'Is this the new valet?'</p>

  <p>'The very newest, Sanders,' replied Peter. 'I've been trying to get some
  conception of how I look in my own drawers. Never had the opportunity before.
  What do you think of them, Sanders?'</p>

  <p>'Very nice, sir, I am sure,' said Sanders, who prided himself on his
  esthetic reactions. 'The background is a trifle dingy.'</p>

  <p>Oh, that's all right,' remarked Peter airily. 'We can remove the
  background and have them washed.'</p>

  <p>'Burned,' suggested Sanders.</p>

  <p>That ain't nice,' broke in Little Arthur with a sob in his voice. 'Call
  that there copper and let him take me away.'</p>

  <p>'I was instructed to inform you, Mr. Peter,' went on the butler,
  disdainfully disregarding the little crook, 'that Miss Yolanda and your aunt
  await your presence below, sir. It is almost time to call the motor if you
  intend to cross by ferry.'</p>

  <p>'Why the ferry?' demanded Peter.</p>

  <p>'Miss Yolanda finds the tube rather common, sir,' said Sanders, and God
  only knew what the man was thinking. 'She has decided objections to the
  ventilation.'</p>

  <p>Peter took another drink.</p>

  <p>'Little Arthur,' snapped Peter, suddenly brisk, 'pack a suitcase for me
  &mdash;not for yourself, mind you, but for me.'</p>

  <p>'Me, mister!' protested the pickpocket. 'Pack it like I am?'</p>

  <p>'Certainly,' replied Peter. 'It will amuse me while I'm dressing. And
  listen to me, Sanders. Tell Miss Yolanda with my compliments that if she
  doesn't like the tubes she'll have to bear with the subway downtown. I won't
  drive or be driven in traffic on a night like this.'</p>

  <p>'I quite understand, Mr. Peter,' said Sanders, and with a lingering glance
  at Little Arthur quietly withdrew.</p>

  <p>'You oughten ter have let him see me like this,' complained the little man
  in the large drawers. 'It's more than flesh can bear.'</p>

  <p>'I think Sanders took it admirably, taking you all in all,' asserted
  Peter, 'which is the only way to take you. Step lively with that
  packing.'</p>

  <p>Half an hour later Peter and Yolanda left the Van Dyck residence on foot
  for a week-end in New Jersey. Behind them came Little Arthur. He was bearing
  up as well as he could under the weight of two suitcases. Peter was a little
  drunk and Yolanda a little peeved. Peter's explanations of his conduct had
  been almost incoherent. He had expected her to take too many things for
  granted. Still, until the country had recovered somewhat from its protracted
  attack of melancholia she saw no advantage to herself in precipitating an
  open break with her fiancé, who was indubitably more than enough mad. As long
  as coffee remained in popular favor, she would put up with his
  eccentricities&mdash;humor them, in fact.</p>

  <p>'The rest will do you good,' she told him as they walked to the
  subway.</p>

  <p>'I never find these house parties in the least way restful,' replied Peter
  complainingly. 'They wear me down a lot.'</p>

  <p>'I know, my dear,' she said tolerantly, 'but one must be seen. Especially
  persons in our position. Can't afford to stagnate, you know. Must carry on.
  In these bad times it is expected of us.'</p>

  <p>'You mean going to house parties, dinners, dances, and all?' incredulously
  Peter asked her.</p>

  <p>'Obviously,' she replied with the superior patience of a higher being.</p>

  <p>'What good does that do?' the man wanted to know.</p>

  <p>'Keeps society on an even keel. Offsets the influences of radicalism
  &mdash;communism,' she assured him without batting an eye. 'Shows the nation
  at large that the real people are not taking seriously all this talk about
  depression.'</p>

  <p>'Strikes me as being a bad excuse for doing even worse,' observed Peter.
  'And as for stagnation, that's all you do at these house parties&mdash;
  stagnate. Not that I object to that, but I prefer to do it in my own
  home.'</p>

  <p>'You're such a child,' said Yolanda, tapping him lightly on the arm.</p>

  <p>Peter's reply to this was rotten but inaudible.</p>

  <p>From the shadows of a building a small figure in a ridiculous duster
  watched Peter's progress with wicked but devoted eyes. When Little Arthur had
  lurched by with his burden, the figure discarded the duster and became an
  exceedingly well-built young woman. With a set face and a determined eye
  Josephine Duval proceeded to stalk her prey. She was bound for New Jersey
  herself. She might just as well kill two birds with one stone. And if she did
  not succeed in killing them, she could at least make them quite
  uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>Josephine had a lovely body, but her mind was altogether bad. An ideal
  combination.</p>

  <p>Ahead of her Little Arthur stumbled through the fog blowing in from the
  river. He was wishing he had the courage to drop the bags and run, realizing
  with a pang of regret that he could not make his escape with them.</p>

  <p>That same evening Bishop Waller was gratified to discover that both God
  and his own inclinations coincided in calling him and his newly acquired
  jaegers to the state of New Jersey. Accordingly he decided to answer this
  call in person as well as in jaegers. Furthermore, it was his ecclesiastical
  preference to approach this friendly state through the instrumentality of a
  ferry-boat, which he earnestly hoped would be less crowded than the
  tubes.</p>

  <p>'And Blakely,' he told his man, at the same time striving to tune out of
  his voice an overtone of mundane pride, 'be sure you put in an extra pair of
  those new jaegers&mdash;the spring-weight ones.'</p>

  <p>Blakely had hoped to be permitted to pack a pair of these new jaegers. He
  admired them tremendously. In fact, in his quiet humble heart of hearts he
  almost found the hardihood to wish that he too were a bishop so that he might
  be able to wear drawers similar to the man he served.</p>

  <p>'They're an excellent pair, sir,' he observed as he reverentially carried
  the new jaegers to the suitcase. 'An excellent pair, if I may say so.'</p>

  <p>'Certainly, Blakely,' beamed the Bishop. 'By all means admire the
  drawers.' He found himself greatly pleased. Crossing the room, he stood for a
  moment by his man and admired the drawers with him. 'They are excellent in
  every respect,' he continued pontifically. 'Honestly made and generously
  fashioned. I find then exceedingly comfortable.'</p>

  <p>'I'm sure you must, sir,' agreed Blakely, his eyes involuntarily straying
  to the lower half of the Bishop as if endeavoring to visualize the ineffable
  comfort enjoyed by this man of God.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later Bishop Waller departed. Stepping into a taxi, he
  instructed the driver to proceed with judicious perseverance to a downtown
  ferry slip. Then, with a clean conscience and a contented mind, he settled
  back in the cab and awaited future developments.</p>

  <p>Bishop Waller had not long to wait. The future developed almost too
  soon.</p>

  <p>At about this time Aspirin Liz, after a dust-mottled sort of day, felt
  herself deeply stirred by a craving for beer&mdash;beer and a little
  companionship over a table unspoiled by a cloth. She desired to relax for a
  while with the knowledge that a bar was within easy call, that she had merely
  to press her finger lazily on a bell to have her modest and essentially
  reasonable wishes filled to the brim, nay to overflowing.</p>

  <p>In her youth, when she derived both pleasure and profit from her figure,
  she had sedulously eschewed beer. Now, when her once lovely body had become
  an expense without compensation, she indulged it affectionately for the sake
  of what it had been. She gave it beer up to and sometimes past the limits of
  its ample capacity. With grim satisfaction she plunged into it great sides of
  corned beef rising like rocks of Gibraltar from choppy seas of cabbage. She
  talked to middle-aged ladies of similar tastes, and discovered that, no
  matter how dissimilar their lives may have been, their interests in life were
  basically the same, a little rest, a little peace and quiet, food, drink, an
  audience, and a room of one's own where one could remove in comfort one's
  stays and shoes.</p>

  <p>For Aspirin Liz the most satisfactory escape from the solitude of her four
  walls lay on the opposite bank of the Hudson. It was her custom occasionally
  to take a ferry headed for this bank and, arrived there, to seek out one of
  several water-front cafes in which she was both known and admired for her
  true worth&mdash;a good, solid, level-headed woman with a sincere fondness
  for beer and a capacity to hold it.</p>

  <p>After a day devoted to aspirin, the retired model felt she owed herself
  beer. And this is an excellent way to feel&mdash;one of the most satisfactory
  feelings extant. Many persons want beer, and almost as many drink beer, but
  it is given to few&mdash;and then very rarely&mdash;to be convinced that not
  only do they want beer but that they actually deserve beer, need it, in
  fact.</p>

  <p>Therefore, it was with a feeling of rectitude almost approaching the self-
  sacrificial that Aspirin Liz prepared her face, adjusted her hat, shrugged
  her hips into proper working relations with her corset and, after looking
  both for and into her pocket-book, departed in the direction of the
  river.</p>

  <p>Thus it came about that the same ferry-boat was enabled to set at naught
  the various plans and prospects of a diversity of characters. Even more. It
  was given to this ferry-boat to mingle the interests and alter the destinies
  of persons whose lives had hitherto developed along seldom intersecting
  paths.</p>

  <p>And as these several characters converged upon this ferry-boat, the fog
  blew in their faces and blanketed their lungs. Figures swift with purpose
  lived jerkily for an instant in the eyes of others, then faded out. Trucks
  tunneled through wet fluff and dragged a hole behind them. Sound and light
  were muffled. Distance ceased to be. Each man carried with him the boundaries
  of his universe. Out there on the river a little hell of whistles dwelt in
  the heart of the fog.</p>

  <p>The ferry-boat drew out. Mist rolled down on its exit. A sharp report and
  a spit of fire. Then fog where a figure had stood&mdash;a half-crouched shape
  peering in the direction of the ferry-boat now unseen.</p>

  <p>There were very few passengers who ascribed the report of the gun to a
  cause other than the back-firing of an automobile.</p>

  <p>Little Arthur was not one of these.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap8"
     name="chap8">8. A SHOT IN THE ARM</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It really does not matter who fired the shot or at whom it
  was fired, save for the fact that it caused Little Arthur to fall promptly to
  the afterdeck of the outgoing ferry-boat and to remain there, to all intents
  and purposes a dead pickpocket. And let it be added that no one was more
  convinced of this fact than was Little Arthur himself. To begin with, the day
  had proved too much for his delicately organized nervous structure. Add to
  this a frail body and two suitcases, and it immediately becomes evident that
  Little Arthur was in no condition to stand a great deal more of anything. In
  short, this pocket edition of petty larceny was through&mdash;a broken
  reed.</p>

  <p>At the same moment that his newly acquired valet fell to the deck, Peter
  Van Dyck lurched a little as a stinging sensation manifested itself in his
  left upper arm. This he promptly dismissed in favor of peering down into the
  face of the stricken man. It was not much of a face to peer down into&mdash;
  in truth, it was a face he would much rather not have seen at all. From the
  unprepossessing expression Little Arthur turned to the world, it was obvious
  he had been mortally wounded.</p>

  <p>But what creature in the world was so lacking in aspiration as to want to
  wound Little Arthur? At his most vigorous moments the small felon was only
  half alive. This did not mean that the man responsible for his death would be
  regarded by law as only half a murderer. Not at all. Peter in his heart swore
  that if he ever discovered who had fired the shot he, Peter Van Dyck, would
  make it his business to see that the wretch was regarded as being something
  more than a murderer. In the short time Little Arthur had been with him,
  Peter had formed a sort of watchful yet commiserating attachment for this
  unreliable visitant from the underworld. It was one of those inexplicable
  affections that defy all natural laws, because it was far from natural to be
  fond of Little Arthur. Most people found it impossible. But Peter was not
  like most people. He was a great deal worse than those who knew him
  suspected, and at the same time much better. They had been through a lot
  together in a few crowded hours, he and Little Arthur. They had suffered
  much. Side by side they had passed through humiliation and public
  disgrace.</p>

  <p>With a sudden pang Peter thought of the drawers he had forced upon the now
  lifeless legs. Then came another thought&mdash;a worse one. What would the
  undertaker think about those drawers? Would the man be able to survive the
  shock? Would he be able to approach those drawers in a purely professional
  capacity or would he consider them in the light of a personal affront? No
  undertaker, no matter how case-hardened, would be able to regard them with
  indifference. No, those drawers presented a problem. Peter felt a little
  responsible. Life was funny&mdash;always letting one in for things.</p>

  <p>While these thoughts were flashing through his mind, a small but keenly
  interested crowd had collected round Peter and the fallen man. Peter knelt
  down and began to examine him. There was no mark of a bullet wound. No sign
  of blood.</p>

  <p>'Who pipped him, mister?' asked a man's hoarse voice.</p>

  <p>'Who did what?' Peter inquired.</p>

  <p>'Pipped,' replied the voice. 'You know&mdash;gave the little bloke an
  airing.'</p>

  <p>'If you mean who murdered this poor devil,' said Peter, strongly objecting
  to the speaker's language, 'I wouldn't be surprised if it were you. Gave him
  an airing! Is that any way to speak of a man shot down in cold blood?'</p>

  <p>'Where's the cold blood?' another spectator morbidly wanted to know.</p>

  <p>'There ain't a speck on him,' announced still another spectator
  disappointedly. 'Not a speck. And blood ain't cold to begin with, even a
  silly-looking geezer's like that.'</p>

  <p>Peter was moved to reply.</p>

  <p>'Don't let's go into the temperature of his blood right now,' he observed
  with what he hoped was withering sarcasm. 'You'd look silly yourself if you
  were murdered, and I'd feel greatly pleased.'</p>

  <p>'No, mister,' answered the other. 'I'd look plain scared.'</p>

  <p>Dismissing this person as unimportant, Peter endeavored to turn Little
  Arthur over to ascertain if he had been shot from behind. Once more he felt a
  stinging sensation in his left arm.</p>

  <p>'Yolanda,' he called, for the first time remembering his fiancée. 'Would
  you very much mind giving me a hand with Little Arthur? He's been shot.'</p>

  <p>'I wouldn't touch Little Arthur with a pair of tongs,' Yolanda coldly
  replied from the outer fringe of the crowd. 'I am waiting for you to take me
  to my seat.'</p>

  <p>'I'll help you,' said a familiar voice, as Jo knelt down beside him.
  'Aren't you strong enough to turn the little blighter over yourself?'</p>

  <p>Peter tried without success to conceal his relief when his worried blue
  eyes looked into the warmly brown ones of Josephine.</p>

  <p>'I'm strong enough,' he muttered. 'Merely a little nervous.'</p>

  <p>'I get you, mister,' the girl replied in a voice that denoted long years
  of close companionship. 'Let's go.'</p>

  <p>'This isn't a sporting event,' said Peter. 'Don't be so snappy about it.
  You'll roll him off the boat.'</p>

  <p>Together they turned the still figure over. Peter was unable to find any
  sign of bullet marks. He had been cowardly enough to leave the trousers for
  Jo to examine. This did not appear to gag her in the least. Several heads
  were peering down interestedly over her shoulder.</p>

  <p>'From the holes in them pants,' said an awed voice, 'it looks like he'd
  fairly been riddled with bullets.'</p>

  <p>'Must have been a machine gun that pinged him in the pants,' another
  observer declared.</p>

  <p>Peter also objected to the use of the term 'ping.' However, he refrained
  from protesting, realizing that these callous persons must have cut their
  teeth on lethal weapons and played tag with machine-gun bullets.</p>

  <p>'If he was hit by a machine gun,' said Jo in a brisk voice, 'the bullets
  must have balked at his drawers. From the little I can see, I don't much
  blame them at all.'</p>

  <p>'These are my drawers,' objected Peter.</p>

  <p>'What are your drawers doing on him, mister?' a deeply interested voice
  inquired.</p>

  <p>Peter looked pained.</p>

  <p>'Does it matter,' he asked, 'what my drawers are doing on this man? He's
  been mortally wounded. That's what matters now. Whether my drawers are off or
  on him makes absolutely no difference. In fact,' he added, with a touch of
  bitterness, 'it doesn't very much matter if he's wearing any drawers at
  all.'</p>

  <p>'Well, a guy's got to wear some sort of drawers,' retorted the rebuked
  spectator in an injured voice.</p>

  <p>'Not the sort I see bits of,' objected another. Josephine's calm voice cut
  short Peter's reply to this fresh insult.</p>

  <p>'Why do you let yourself become involved in these futile discussions?' she
  asked. 'There might be some life left in the little crook yet.'</p>

  <p>They returned the body to its former position and looked at it with
  baffled eyes. Peter's left hand brushed against the pale face. Instinctively
  he drew his hand back. Little Arthur's face presented a red smear.</p>

  <p>Gord,' a voice whispered, 'the little feller's just beginning to bleed.
  How do you make that out?'</p>

  <p>'Ain't bleedin' from no hole,' said another member of the helpful
  gathering. 'Must be bleedin' through his pores.'</p>

  <p>'How do you mean,' a third voice inquired, 'bleedin' through his paws? He
  ain't no dog.'</p>

  <p>Didn't say he was a dog,' the second voice snapped back. 'Don't have to be
  a dog to bleed through your pores.'</p>

  <p>'But you got to be an animal,' the other announced triumphantly. 'I ain't
  as dumb as all that.'</p>

  <p>'I mean the pores of his skin,' the second speaker replied somewhat
  wearily.</p>

  <p>'Never knew skin had no paws,' said his stubborn opponent.</p>

  <p>'You keep thinking of dogs' paws,' the second man replied almost
  pleadingly, 'while all the time I'm talking about skin pores&mdash;tiny
  little holes.'</p>

  <p>Well, why don't you say little holes,' the persistent party demanded,
  'instead of using a lot of foreign language?'</p>

  <p>'Would you believe it possible?' Peter asked Josephine in a low voice.
  'And in the presence of death, at that.'</p>

  <p>'The trouble with you,' said the girl, 'is that you let yourself get
  dragged in. You're just as dumb as they are. Help me &mdash;</p>

  <p>She stopped suddenly and looked at a dark stain on the left sleeve of
  Peter's coat; then her eyes sought his hand. Blood was dripping slowly from
  his knuckles. For a moment her hand flew to her mouth, stifling a little cry.
  Then she said quite calmly, trying to keep her feelings from flooding
  through:</p>

  <p>'You've been shot in the arm, Mr. Van Dyck.'</p>

  <p>'Me?' inquired Peter. 'That's odd. My arm does feel a bit funny now that I
  come to think of it.'</p>

  <p>'What I want to know,' put in a fresh voice, a rough argumentative voice,
  'how can this guy bleed when the other feller's shot?'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps the bullet went clean through the little feller,' a spectator
  explained, 'stopping on its way first to kill him, and then bunged into this
  other bloke.'</p>

  <p>'Knew it wasn't his paws,' an all too familiar voice put in. 'He ain't
  shot at all. Them holes in his pants are just natural holes, worn out,
  like.'</p>

  <p>'Mean to tell me,' another man demanded, 'this big guy gets shot and the
  little one falls down for him? It ain't reasonable.'</p>

  <p>'I don't mean to tell you nothing,' the first voice cried excitedly.
  'Wasn't talking to you anyway. Just making a harmless suggestion.'</p>

  <p>'You mean useless,' sneered the other.</p>

  <p>By this time it was Peter's turn to become indignant. He looked darkly
  upon the recumbent form of Little Arthur while Josephine did things to his
  arm.</p>

  <p>'Then that dirty dog of a thief,' he said as if to himself, 'has been
  having a nice long rest while all the time I've been shot in the arm and
  feeling sorry as hell for him.'</p>

  <p>'If you will select your valets from the scum of the underworld,'
  Josephine told him, looking closely at Little Arthur, 'you must expect things
  like this to happen.'</p>

  <p>'Nobody could have expected this,' said Peter.</p>

  <p>'Say, mister,' put in a voice admiringly, 'you must be pretty used to
  bullets if you don't know when you're shot.'</p>

  <p>'Either that or he's just plain dumb,' another passenger explained. 'I'd
  damn well know if I was shot.'</p>

  <p>'I damn well wish you were,' grated Peter; then, turning to the girl
  beside him : 'I've a good mind to pull down his trousers and see if he hasn't
  been shot. Something's surely wrong with him.'</p>

  <p>'Go on,' replied Jo. 'Pull his trousers off for all I care.'</p>

  <p>Whatever the part of Little Arthur it was that remained alive must have
  been the modest part, for at the mention of his trousers his hands clutched
  them firmly and his eyes snapped open.</p>

  <p>'None of that,' he got out weakly but distinctly. 'Them pants are up for
  good.'</p>

  <p>'Ain't you even shot, buddy?' a voice called out.</p>

  <p>'How do I know?' Little Arthur answered. 'I heard a shot and felt its
  breath.'</p>

  <p>The interrogator laughed ironically.</p>

  <p>'I guess you're O.K.,' he said. 'To hear a shot is one thing, and to feel
  a shot's another. You just fainted from fright.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, yeah retorted the small man, sitting up with an indignant snap.
  'Well, this shot didn't sound like no lullaby to me. It didn't exactly croon
  in my ear, if yer get what I mean. You'd of fainted, too.'</p>

  <p>Little Arthur turned a pair of injured eyes on Peter, whom he regarded in
  the light of a patron and protector, but he found scant comfort in that
  quarter.</p>

  <p>'If you've settled your discussion entirely to your own satisfaction,
  Little Arthur &mdash;' Peter began coldly.</p>

  <p>'Oh, I don't mind the likes of him,' the recovered crook assured
  Peter.</p>

  <p>'That's good,' continued Peter with false solicitude. 'But as I was
  saying, do you think it would inconvenience you too much if you got yourself
  to hell off that deck and looked for those two bags?'</p>

  <p>'Can't you hunt 'em up yourself while I'm getting my breath?' was the
  pickpocket's reasonable suggestion.</p>

  <p>'Little Arthur,' replied Peter, a feverish glitter burning in his eyes,
  'I'm afraid you don't quite understand the position. By rights I should be
  lying down where you are and you should be where I am. In other words, while
  you have been taking it easy on the flat of your back I've been slowly
  bleeding to death looking for your wound, you craven-spirited, low-down,
  grubby little snatch-purse. Is everything quite clear? Get up, damn your
  eyes.'</p>

  <p>Little Arthur rose hastily from the deck.</p>

  <p>'Mean ter say you're shot, mister?' he asked nervously.</p>

  <p>'Sure, I'm shot,' growled Peter, 'and have been shot ever since this
  ferry-boat shoved off a couple of days ago.'</p>

  <p>'Then why are you standing up on your feet?' the small thief incredulously
  inquired.</p>

  <p>'We all can't lie down on our backs,' Peter told him with due bitterness.
  'You got there first. Find those suitcases and come inside. I'm getting
  weak.'</p>

  <p>Before they moved away, Josephine found an opportunity to add to the
  pickpocket's mental unrest.</p>

  <p>'And if anything happens to Mr. Peter,' she assured the small man,
  'anything serious, that is, you're going to spend the rest of your life flat
  on your back in jail, and I'm going to put you there.'</p>

  <p>'Gord, lady!' said Arthur. 'Don't feel that way. I ain't done a
  thing.'</p>

  <p>'No,' she replied coldly, leading Peter away. 'And you look as if your
  never will, you dip.'</p>

  <p>Yolanda met them at the entrance of the women's section of the cabin.</p>

  <p>'It's taking terribly long to get across,' she complained; then coolly
  surveying Josephine&mdash;You have met a friend, I see, Peter.'</p>

  <p>'Don't you remember me?' Jo asked her sweetly. 'I was the young lady
  behind the goggles. Your fiancé was nude with me in the closet.'</p>

  <p>'Heavens!' exclaimed Yolanda. 'I should think you'd be ashamed to admit
  it. Are you really going to have a baby?'</p>

  <p>'Several, I hope, some day, but not to-day,' said Jo. 'You see, Miss
  Wilmont, your quondam fiancé has been wounded.'</p>

  <p>'Why do you say quondam?' asked Yolanda.&mdash;Mr. Van Dyck is still my
  fiancé.'</p>

  <p>'You mean&mdash;after all that went on in that closet?'</p>

  <p>'Would one of you mind taking a look at this arm?' Peter edged in
  weakly.</p>

  <p>'Just a minute,' retorted Yolanda. 'What did happen in that closet, now
  that this woman has brought up the subject? I insist on knowing.'</p>

  <p>'In detail?' Jo inquired.</p>

  <p>'Don't be common,' snapped Yolanda. 'I demand a plain statement from Mr.
  Van Dyck.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' said Josephine with a shrug of her charming shoulders, 'we might
  as well confess, Peter.' She turned to the waiting girl and extended her
  outspread hands in a help-less gesture. 'The usual thing,' she said. 'You
  know&mdash;the usual thing.'</p>

  <p>'I think I do know,' replied the other, 'but I certainly did not know it
  was the usual thing. Is she speaking the truth, Peter?'</p>

  <p>'Well, didn't you see for yourself?' Jo cried in exasperation. 'He was as
  naked as a coot, wasn't he? What else but the usual thing?'</p>

  <p>'It might be usual with you,' said Yolanda, 'but I didn't think it was
  with Mr. Van Dyck&mdash;especially in a closet. Is it, Peter?'</p>

  <p>'Eh?' asked Peter. 'What's that? Oh, no. Certainly not. Most unusual in a
  closet&mdash;almost unthinkable.'</p>

  <p>'There you are,' said Josephine with finality. 'He admits it. Says it's
  unusual, but only in a closet, mind you.'</p>

  <p>'I want to sit down,' said Peter. 'Aren't either one of you going to do a
  thing about this arm?'</p>

  <p>'I'll look after you in a minute, Peter,' Yolanda told him.</p>

  <p>'No, you won't,' said Josephine. 'After all that has passed between us,
  that is my privilege.'</p>

  <p>'My dear young woman,' replied Yolanda, 'you have no official
  standing.'</p>

  <p>'I can hardly stand at all,' said Peter. 'I'm going to sit down before I
  fall down.'</p>

  <p>Finding a place on the long seat, he sank wearily down beside a stout,
  neatly arrayed woman with an anticipatory expression in her eyes. Although
  Peter did not know it at the moment, this woman was thinking entirely in
  terms of beer. So engrossed had she been in her thoughts, so spiritually
  steeped in beer, as it were, she had failed to notice how long it was taking
  for the ferry-boat to nose its way across the fog-piled river. Beneath her
  breath the woman had been humming 'California, Here I Come'&mdash;an old
  favorite with Aspirin Liz. Peter's near collapse on the bench beside her drew
  the thoughts of the bemused woman back to her present surroundings, which
  were not nearly so congenial as those of a water-front cafes. She gave the
  wounded man a quick survey, then turned halfway round on the bench and faced
  him. Her eyes were fixed on the dark, moist stain on his sleeve. Liz promptly
  drew the logical inference. Here was a wounded gunman who with the invariable
  delicacy of his kind refrained from drawing attention to his little
  contretemps. From the appearance of this gunman, racketeer, gangster, or
  whatever his class or creed, Aspirin Liz concluded that his present
  contretemps was something more than a little. The man looked downright bad.
  Aspirin Liz, with the quick camaraderie of her training, was worried about
  him.</p>

  <p>'In trouble?' she asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>Peter started nervously. Liz attributed the movement to guilt.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' he muttered. 'Terrible trouble. Shot in the arm.'</p>

  <p>'Are you asking for a shot in the arm?' Liz asked him. 'Or have you been
  shot in the arm?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Peter. 'I've been. Never take dope.'</p>

  <p>'Good,' replied Liz. 'That's one thing you've missed, anyway.'</p>

  <p>'What do you mean?' demanded Peter. 'Did you take me for a dope
  fiend?'</p>

  <p>'Never can tell,' said Liz. 'Ought to do something about that arm.'</p>

  <p>'What should I do about it?' asked Peter.</p>

  <p>'Take it out of its coat sleeve and shirt, for one thing, then take a look
  at it.'</p>

  <p>'In front of all these people?'</p>

  <p>'Why not? Never been in your shirt-sleeves before?'</p>

  <p>'Much less than that,' said Peter, thinking back over the past few hours.
  'You might not believe me, madam, but I've been dashing about naked.'</p>

  <p>Liz's opinion of the man underwent a quick change.</p>

  <p>'Oh, I see,' she said. 'That explains it. Then you're not a gangster?'</p>

  <p>'Certainly not!' indignantly.</p>

  <p>'Sort of shot in the line of nobody's business,' said Liz. 'In the pursuit
  of pleasure, so to speak. Are all husbands born with gats? Come on. Off with
  that coat.'</p>

  <p>'It wasn't that,' complained Peter as she helped him to slip out of his
  coat. 'Not what you mean at all.'</p>

  <p>Josephine and Yolanda, having succeeded in giving each other thoroughly
  bad tempers, presented themselves before Peter at this moment.</p>

  <p>'What did I tell you?' demanded Jo, pointing a finger at Peter. 'There he
  goes again. Getting undressed already, and I bet he hadn't known the woman
  five minutes.'</p>

  <p>'You viper!' said Peter. 'You'd rather let me bleed to death than stop
  telling lies.'</p>

  <p>'I see you brought your trouble with you,' observed Liz in level tones.
  'Those two your molls?'</p>

  <p>'Not both of us,' said Jo promptly, with a nod indicating Yolanda. 'She
  is. I'm just his fancy lady.'</p>

  <p>'What am I?' Yolanda demanded.</p>

  <p>'It doesn't matter,' replied Aspirin Liz with an amused smile. 'I don't
  care if you're a couple of nuns. This man's been wounded. You can wash your
  dirty linen later.'</p>

  <p>'Dirty linen!' put in Yolanda disdainfully. 'Peter, am I to be insulted in
  your presence?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Peter, disgusted. 'You are. I'd like to do it myself.'</p>

  <p>'You have,' replied Yolanda.</p>

  <p>'And speaking about linen,' Jo tossed in, 'I know the color of his
  drawers.' Peter groaned aloud at this. 'That,' continued the girl, 'should be
  enough to convince you of the irregularity of our relations. They're not
  linen, his drawers. They're silk&mdash;all silk with orange stripes. Look for
  yourself, if you don't believe me.'</p>

  <p>'Is that true, Peter?' Yolanda demanded.</p>

  <p>'Oh, I don't know,' he answered distractedly, flinching beneath the
  investigating hands of Liz. 'Maybe she does and maybe she doesn't. I forgot
  myself. Why don't you drag my trousers off and get my damned drawers
  witnessed by a notary public?'</p>

  <p>'Apparently,' remarked Yolanda, 'you don't care what woman undresses you
  so long as you get undressed.' 'No,' gritted Peter. 'I like myself that
  way.'</p>

  <p>At this moment an impressive gentleman in clerical attire introduced
  himself to the contentious group.</p>

  <p>'I was told a passenger had been shot,' he began, as if passengers were
  always being shot. 'Can I be of any help?'</p>

  <p>'Well,' Jo replied, favoring the Bishop with a glowing smile, 'he's not
  quite ready to be buried yet, but if this boat doesn't land somewhere soon
  you may have the pleasure of chucking him out to sea.'</p>

  <p>Bishop Waller permitted himself a faint smile, then stooped over and
  examined Peter's arm while Aspirin Liz looked at him with respect bred of the
  awareness of a slightly dappled past. Soon the two of them were working in
  complete accord to staunch the wound and bandage it, Liz acting in the
  capacity of water carrier to the man of God. When it came to procuring a
  bandage she promptly solved the difficulty with a coy look at the Bishop.</p>

  <p>'I can see those two ladies don't wear them,' she said reprovingly, 'but I
  do and always have and always will. Here goes.'</p>

  <p>Turning her back on the Bishop, who in justice to his exalted spirit was
  not at all interested, she did some considerable ripping. Her face flushed
  from exertion rather than from the inquiring scrutiny of several dozen
  passengers who sat patiently following her movements with the dull curiosity
  of the mentally vacant, she turned back to the Bishop and offered him a strip
  of cloth. This he accepted with a word of dignified commendation, then bound
  Peter's arm.</p>

  <p>'Under the circumstances,' he said when his task was finished, 'this is
  about the best we can do, but the moment you get ashore, sir, I strongly
  advise you to see a physician to guard against infection. May I ask how the
  unfortunate accident occurred?'</p>

  <p>'Merely one of the commoner risks of contemporary life in America,' said
  Peter. 'A stray shot, you know.'</p>

  <p>'Exactly,' replied the Bishop. 'To-day one can hardly telephone without
  having the booth shot from around one.'</p>

  <p>He seated himself beside Peter with the air of a man both able and willing
  to watch the whole night through.</p>

  <p>'Most people in telephone booths deserve to be shot,' Josephine declared.
  'It's the only way you can get 'em to come out.'</p>

  <p>Bishop Waller received this bloodthirsty sentiment with unexpected
  approval. He had frequently felt that way himself about people in telephone
  booths, but had never gone so far as to put his feelings into words.</p>

  <p>'Of course,' he said judicially, 'one's attitude may change considerably
  according to whether one is doing the telephoning or the shooting.'</p>

  <p>'That's so,' replied Jo. 'Hadn't thought of that.' The Bishop's smile
  embraced her.</p>

  <p>'Of course, my dear,' he said. 'Such minor considerations escape us all at
  times.'</p>

  <p>Hardly had the Bishop rounded off his sentence as such gentlemen will and
  must, when the ferry-boat fairly tore its heart out in a protesting blast
  against fate in the guise of fog. As the engines sent chills along its
  timbers the reversed propellers bit back into the hidden water. From dead
  ahead came the answering scream of a half-crazed whistle. Danger ten feet
  off. Passengers ran to look at it, faces pressed against the windows. Eyes
  too filled with the wonder of ignorance to know they should look frightened.
  Waiting...drifting smoothly...then a soft, silly bump, a mere touch in the
  fog.</p>

  <p>'Well, your reverence,' said Aspirin Liz, 'there's one of those minor
  considerations we didn't quite escape.'</p>

  <p>'Bishop Waller, madam,' the excellent man informed her calmly. 'Episcopal
  bishop of the Eastern States. And should this present consideration prove a
  little less minor than we would like it, let us face it with the fortitude
  and courage of true Christians-civilized Christians, that is.'</p>

  <p>Even at this serious moment Bishop Waller insisted on stressing that nice
  distinction existing between civilized Christians and savage ones&mdash;
  those who always wore drawers and those who gleefully discarded them after
  the closing hymn.</p>

  <p>A small figure between two suitcases was taking up a great deal of room as
  it staggered across the cabin towards Peter Van Dyck.</p>

  <p>'Here's your bags, mister,' gasped the pickpocket, supporting himself
  between them.</p>

  <p>'Thank you, Little Arthur,' said Peter. 'But we have neither the time nor
  privacy to dress before sinking, I fear.'</p>

  <p>'Are we doing that?' the small man asked in an even smaller voice.</p>

  <p>'You had best prepare yourself to meet your God either now or a little
  later,' Bishop Waller told the pick-pocket in a gentle voice.</p>

  <p>'If you don't mind, your honor,' Little Arthur chattered, 'I'm going to
  pray to God to meet Him much later&mdash;with all due respect to Heaven and
  Himself.'</p>

  <p>'You'll never meet Him at all, you thing!' Josephine assured him.</p>

  <p>'Peter, please do something,' Yolanda burst out. 'My nerves are on an
  edge.'</p>

  <p>'Don't worry,' said Liz brightly. 'They might be all wet, you know.'</p>

  <p>'Ugh!' gasped Little Arthur. 'What are we going to do?'</p>

  <p>Then a great voice drilling down through the fog told Little Arthur in no
  uncertain language exactly what to do.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap9"
     name="chap9">9. BAD TALK AND WORSE WEATHER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">'Get the hell out of here, you booby!' boomed out the great
  voice, making an unpleasant evening even more unpleasant.</p>

  <p>'Seafaring men have such unbridled tempers,' mildly observed the
  Bishop.</p>

  <p>'I'd hate to be called a booby even in a fog,' Peter declared. 'It's a
  word to which I strongly object. Seems to strike at the very roots of one's
  being.'</p>

  <p>Apparently the skipper felt the same way about it.</p>

  <p>'Who the hell are you calling booby?' he cried from the hidden aloofness
  of his little pilot house.</p>

  <p>'I'm calling you a booby,' answered the other skipper across the milling
  fog.</p>

  <p>'You're a booby yourself,' retorted the defender of the ferry-boat, seeing
  no reason to improve on the word. 'A blundering booby at that.'</p>

  <p>'Call me a booby!' almost screamed the other voice. 'I'd like to cut you
  in two. What do you mean running into an ocean liner, endangering the lives
  of my passengers?'</p>

  <p>'What do you mean by picking on a ferry-boat carrying American citizens?'
  demanded the local skipper, introducing an international flavor to the
  dispute.</p>

  <p>'Your passengers don't count for a damn,' he was informed. 'They're dirty
  commuters. They aren't even human.'</p>

  <p>'Is that so? Well, so are yours. You're all boobies&mdash;the lot of
  you.'</p>

  <p>A clatter of protesting voices burst through the fog. One shrill, ironical
  voice made itself disagreeably articulate.</p>

  <p>'You can drown commuters by the handful,' announced this voice, 'and the
  world would be better off&mdash;much better off.'</p>

  <p>This time the commuters' voices shattered the fog with indignant
  discord.</p>

  <p>'Your passengers are a lot of pleasure-loving swine,' screamed the skipper
  of the ferry, his voice rising above the disgraceful din.</p>

  <p>'Will you keep that rabble quiet?' came the voice of the liner's skipper.
  'Can't hear a word you say.'</p>

  <p>'Keep your own immigrants quiet,' retorted the small craft's skipper. 'Why
  don't you fumigate 'em?'</p>

  <p>The reception of this crude suggestion by the passengers of the liner was
  deafening. Obviously they were infuriated far beyond the bounds of good
  taste. The ferry-boat jeered triumphantly, and the word 'immigrants' found
  immediate favor, also such terms of endearment as wops, kikes, bolshies,
  anarchists, reds, and a few others that will not bear repetition. In the
  midst of this hubbub the voices of the two skippers could be distinguished
  passionately cursing the passengers they had so recently been defending.
  Gradually the voices died exhaustedly away so that the respective
  representatives of the opposing ships were enabled to continue insulting each
  other in comparative peace and quiet.</p>

  <p>'An edifying way for ships to act,' observed Peter, 'when fogbound far at
  sea.'</p>

  <p>'If you don't take that waterlogged louse of yours away from my ship I'm
  going to run you down,' the voice from the liner shouted. 'I've got a peace
  delegation aboard.'</p>

  <p>'Sounds more like a mob from hell,' the ferry-boat replied.</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, the peace delegation apparently became so warlike it
  had to be roundly cursed back into silence. Aspirin Liz, with the light of
  battle in her eyes and closely supported by a quivering Josephine, made for
  the head of the ferry. The others followed the two women.</p>

  <p>'Go to hell, you!' shouted Aspirin Liz as soon as she had taken up her
  station. 'We've got a bishop of the Episcopal Church on our boat, and if you
  don't believe that, his name's Waller.'</p>

  <p>'My dear! My dear!' protested the Bishop. 'Don't use my name in all this
  fog.'</p>

  <p>'What's wrong with your name?' snapped Jo, then shrieked through her hands
  at the opposing ship. 'His name is Waller&mdash;Bishop Waller. Never heard of
  Bishop Waller, you big stiff?'</p>

  <p>'I'm doing the shouting, lady,' the ferry-boat's captain called down to
  Jo.</p>

  <p>'Don't give a damn if he's the twelve apostles,' the seafaring skipper
  blasphemously retorted. 'Go tell him to waller in the waves. That's where
  he'll soon be and you, too, you Jersey broad.'</p>

  <p>'My God! He called me a broad!' cried Josephine, white with rage, then
  furiously to the fog, 'Shut up, you lily.'</p>

  <p>'What!' screamed back the fog. 'Me, a lily! I'd like to come down there
  and punch you on the nose.'</p>

  <p>'A most violent character,' objected the Bishop; then, suddenly losing his
  ecclesiastical calm: 'Take your vile craft out of the way, you zany, and let
  God-fearing people proceed in peace.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' yelled Aspirin Liz. 'Get a move on. I want some beer.'</p>

  <p>'Who the hell cares about you and your beer?' the liner flung back
  coarsely. 'All you'll get is salt water and lots of that, you dizzy Jersey
  broad.'</p>

  <p>'Lily! Lily!' sang out Jo. 'Think up another name.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, my God,' came the voice of the distracted skipper, and Peter in his
  mind's eye caught a glimpse of weather-beaten features distorted with
  impotent rage. 'Oh, my God,' came the strangled voice. 'If I could only come
  down there and pull your nose.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, my dear, how vicious!' Josephine tossed back girlishly. 'We're
  thumbing our noses at you, in case you can't see us.'</p>

  <p>'Make that woman stop,' called the liner's captain, appealing directly to
  the commander of the ferry-boat. 'By rights she should be put in irons for
  calling me such names.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, you lily!' yodeled a chorus of voices through the fog, a group of
  truck drivers seeming to be especially gifted at this form of derision.</p>

  <p>'You're forgetting to sound your whistle, sir,' the local skipper
  pleasantly reminded the other. 'It ain't sounded for seven minutes. I'll
  report that little neglect of duty.'</p>

  <p>'I'm forgetting I'm a human being,' the voice came back wildly from the
  liner. 'I'm forgetting I'm an officer and a gentleman. I'm forgetting I've
  got a soul.' The last word rose in a howl. 'I'm mad. I'm going mad, I tell
  you,' it resumed. 'Going mad alone in the fog.' A burst of maniacal laughter
  followed, then a snatch of demented song. 'All alone on the telephone,'
  quavered the voice of the liner's skipper. 'Sleep, sailor, sleep, all alone
  on the telephone&mdash;ha, ha, ha!' The climax was a volley of incoherent
  obscenities, which ceased suddenly as a new voice was heard, a quiet,
  reasonable, cultured voice.</p>

  <p>'Sorry,' this voice sang out, 'but our skipper has just lost his reason or
  had a stroke or something. Do you happen to know where we are?'</p>

  <p>'Too bad about your old man,' answered the ferry-boat captain. 'Merely
  having a bit of a jaw-back. I swear to God I don't know where we can be.'</p>

  <p>'Might be off the old Rock herself for all I know,' the other replied
  hopelessly. 'Sounds like open water to me.'</p>

  <p>'Are you anchored?' asked the ferry captain.</p>

  <p>'Been anchored for hours,' he was told.</p>

  <p>'Well, I haven't got any anchors,' declared the skipper of the ferry.</p>

  <p>'Wish you had one round your neck,' a vulgar voice observed weightily,
  'an' that you was right with it forty fathoms deep.'</p>

  <p>'Pipe down, there!' cried the cultured voice. 'I say, Captain, would you
  care to tie up 'longside of me?'</p>

  <p>'No, thanks,' replied the other. 'I'll go mousing round for a bit yet.
  Might find something. Hope the old man gets well.'</p>

  <p>'And tell him for me,' Little Arthur surprisingly shouted, 'a ocean-going
  liner shouldn't have a weak-minded skipper.'</p>

  <p>'Shut up, you worm!' snapped Jo. 'You would pull a wisecrack just when we
  were getting nice and friendly. Don't you realize you aren't good enough to
  insult even a body-snatcher?'</p>

  <p>If the skipper of the liner had been incapacitated, his passengers still
  remained loyal. As the two ships parted company in the fog their insults fell
  thick and fast. The ferry-boat did not remain silent. Foul words and frantic
  filled the air.</p>

  <p>'If an angel should appear now,' remarked the Bishop with a sigh of
  regret, 'I very much fear he would mistake the earth for a region far below.
  These maddened voices in the fog sound like spirits in torment.'</p>

  <p>'How long have we been afloat?' Peter asked a little wearily.</p>

  <p>'Nearly two and a half hours,' replied the Bishop, glancing at his
  watch.</p>

  <p>'I'm hungry,' complained Little Arthur.</p>

  <p>'We're not interested,' Jo retorted, then considered him with sudden
  interest. 'Come here, Little Arthur,' she said at last in a dangerously
  honeyed voice. 'I want to have a friendly talk with you.'</p>

  <p>'Are you sure it's friendly?' he asked with justifiable suspicion. 'I've
  had more than enough trouble for one day.'</p>

  <p>'There's not going to be any trouble,' Josephine assured him. 'You're
  going to like this.'</p>

  <p>For a few moments they conversed earnestly together; then, with a backward
  glance at the others, wandered innocently off in the direction of several
  trucks hunched in the gloom of the traffic alleys filled with fog and the
  fumes of gas. Peter and his companions returned to the relative comfort of
  the cabin. A trifle depressed after the excitement caused by the recent
  encounters, they sat down and confronted the faces of their fellow
  passengers. Those faces were a study in conflicting emotions. They furnished
  ample food for thought if one felt inclined to think under such exasperating
  conditions. Peter's brain was working dreamily on the borderland of sleep.
  His head felt hot and heavy. There was a throbbing pain in his arm.</p>

  <p>So many interrupted lives, he mused. So many routines broken. Wives
  waiting all over New Jersey. Dinners getting cold. Children staying up for
  Daddy, then going to bed without him. Mothers glancing out of windows and
  running to front doors. Little speeches of greeting being rehearsed. Furious
  little speeches&mdash;perfect gems of sarcasm and sweet recrimination.</p>

  <p>'No, dear. Little junior couldn't wait up until dawn. Sorry, but if you
  must step off at a speakeasy, you'll have to do without your son. Of course,
  it doesn't matter about me. I haven't counted for years. Do you fund it close
  in here, dear? I'll open up all the windows so the neighbors can enjoy your
  breath, too. No. Don't try to get around me. Keep your horrid hands off. Save
  them for one of your flash stenographers. You seem to prefer their company to
  mine.'</p>

  <p>Peter's thoughts veered off at another tangent. He was convinced that the
  little chap with the pinched face across the way was making up a lie already.
  Years of experience had taught the man that his wife would never believe the
  truth. He must perjure his soul to keep peace in the family. He must tell a
  lie to give her the pleasure of catching him in it. If he told the truth and
  stuck to it, the lady would feel herself injured. She always felt injured.
  She was born with an axe to grind with life in general, and he had been
  feeling its blade for years until he was chipped away to his spiritless
  soul.</p>

  <p>That quiet-looking fellow a few seats away seemed actually to be enjoying
  the situation. He was probably welcoming this fogbound interlude in his
  unadventurous days. Doubtless wished the ferry-boat would never find its
  rightful slip. Peter felt that the man hated that ferry slip, had been hating
  it night after night, week after week, for many years. No wonder war was
  popular when life was unable to dig up anything better than a couple of ferry
  slips with uncongenial destinations at either end.</p>

  <p>But there was a person eager to get home. Newly married, Peter placed him.
  Probably a baby on the way. No word from his wife for twelve whole hours. The
  poor devil was too nervous to sit down. Kept walking about and doing silly
  things with his hands. Aimless things&mdash;futile gestures. And all because
  some unremarkable girl in some equally unremarkable town in New Jersey was
  about to add her even more unremarkable contribution to an already
  overcrowded world. But none of it seemed unremarkable to this young fellow.
  Neither the town nor the girl nor the baby. Life for him was touched with
  wonder. For him there was a zest in things. Peter decided that if he had the
  chap in his office, he would give him a worth-while raise.</p>

  <p>There was a pretty girl who had had about enough of fog horns for one
  night. Probably worked in some office near the river. Had been hearing them
  all day long. Some day she would probably contribute to the world's
  population. Funny thing, that. She would grow old and change and look
  different, and years from now another girl looking not unlike her would come
  there and sit in that same seat. And the whole thing would begin over again.
  Just like a picture with the same picture in it and the same one in that,
  only a little smaller, going on for ever.</p>

  <p>Peter wondered drowsily if he were growing a little delirious. Snatches of
  conversation kept getting mixed up in his mind. Why was he leading these
  people's lives for them, hearing the things they said, imagining their
  thoughts? The world was being eaten up by fog and driven mad by fog horns. A
  detective story would go well now. Somebody should be murdered. Somebody
  almost had been murdered. A few inches to the right with that bullet, and he
  would not have cared whether the boat made land or not. Where would he be
  now? Out there in the fog somewhere, lending his voice to the whistles?</p>

  <p>That girl down the line&mdash;what was her trouble? Why that bitter
  expression? She was getting along in years now. Already that deadly look of
  efficiency, that expression of command, was stealing into her face. Perhaps
  she had passed up a date to spend the week-end somewhere with her boss. Maybe
  her last chance&mdash;her last chance to find out about a lot of things, to
  experience a lot of things. When she reached home to-night&mdash;if she ever
  did&mdash;two old people would be waiting there for her. A little worried
  perhaps. Always a little fearful. Something might happen to this girl of
  theirs, this girl growing old like themselves, yet still almost as
  inexperienced as the day when she was born. Family loyalty and self-sacrifice
  could be carried too far. Always was. This girl would never add to the
  world's population, and she damn well should. Some-one should seduce her
  &mdash;make a mother out of her, give her a break in life. Peter wouldn't
  want to do it, but then there was always some one.</p>

  <p>Peter's brain was once more snatching conversations from the air&mdash;
  Hello, J. B. How's tricks? Reached your quota yet? He's a
  ten-thousand-dollar-a-year man. Must be a nice guy. Thought you always rode
  up with another party&mdash;tall, dark feller. Usually do. He's a
  fifteen-thousand-dollar-a-year man. Must be a wonderful guy. The little lady
  all right? Nervous&mdash;this depression. Have to send her to Lakewood. Mine,
  too. Got to pack her off. Women can't stand depression. Nobody can.
  Depression's bad for the country. That's what I say. See that guy over there?
  He's a five-thousand-dollar-a-year man. Must be a wash-out. Where does he get
  off to carry a cane? There's a pip&mdash;what a leg! Know her? Oh, you do
  &mdash;any good? I should tell you. Hoover's a gentleman, at any rate, not a
  goddam red. Get your ticket ready. Here comes Pete. Getting old, Pete. Been
  punching my ticket for the past seventeen years. Got a piece I want to read.
  Bedtime stories? Right. Tell 'em to the kiddies. Nothing like kiddies. She
  has got a swell leg.</p>

  <p>The synthetic snatches faded away. Peter's head sank lower and lower.
  Aspirin Liz collected it and propped her well-padded shoulder against his
  cheek. Close to the surface of consciousness Peter slid along through the
  fog.</p>

  <p>In the meantime Jo and Little Arthur were lurking round the trucks like
  wolves round a wagon train. They were inspecting the trucks with careless-
  seeming yet calculating eyes. Each truck was wondered about, each truck
  peeped into, poked and felt. Their hands were furtively caressing. Little
  Arthur's favorite truck gave promise of fancy groceries. He opened a knife in
  his pocket, looked quickly about him, then operated on the truck with the
  skill of a surgeon on a mere appendix. Jo's hands were darting into another
  truck. Jo believed in bread. She succeeded in snatching cake, also a thermos
  bottle, the personal property of the driver. Little did Jo care whose
  personal property it was. She had to provide for her own.</p>

  <p>'This is the first time I ever stole a chicken,' Little Arthur whispered,
  pointing to a bulge in his coat.</p>

  <p>'Put it back!' said Jo. 'Put it back. The damn thing will squawk all over
  the ferry.'</p>

  <p>'It ain't that kind of a chicken.'</p>

  <p>'Mean it's a dumb chicken?'</p>

  <p>'No, it's a dead chicken.'</p>

  <p>'But raw?' asked Jo.</p>

  <p>'Very,' admitted the crook. 'Cold and raw.'</p>

  <p>Jo thought rapidly but effectively.</p>

  <p>'Come,' she said at last. 'There must be a fire in the engine room. We'll
  borrow a chunk of the ship's fire, but listen, Little Arthur, let me do the
  talking.'</p>

  <p>'Don't I know!' the little chap replied. 'I'd never try to can your
  chatter.'</p>

  <p>'Follow me, little thief,' said Jo almost tenderly.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later some passengers were slightly interested in seeing two
  figures, crouched as if in pain, move swiftly to the small door of the engine
  room and neatly disappear behind it. Jo descended a short steep metal ladder,
  regretting the while the absence of an audience below. She felt sure that had
  the engineer been present he would have granted her every wish. Men were like
  that&mdash;foolish. A blackened face seated on a box rolled two white eyes at
  her from behind a stanchion.</p>

  <p>'Hello!' said the face. 'What's up?'</p>

  <p>'Nothing much,' replied Jo easily. 'I'm the daughter of a ship's captain
  myself.'</p>

  <p>'I'm not a ship's captain, lady,' the face replied, 'much less his
  daughter.'</p>

  <p>'Don't be silly,' said Jo. 'I want to cook a chicken.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, yeah?' the face grinned back. 'I'd like to run races. Is that the
  bird you want to cook?'</p>

  <p>The face pointed at Little Arthur.</p>

  <p>'No,' said Jo. 'Hell isn't hot enough for that one.'</p>

  <p>'It's too noisy here,' the dip complained.</p>

  <p>'What do you want to do?' asked Jo. 'Sing?'</p>

  <p>'No. It hurts my ears.'</p>

  <p>Jo turned away from Little Arthur and considered a small black door,
  through the edges of which gleamed a frame of fire.</p>

  <p>'Might cook it in there,' she remarked.</p>

  <p>'To a cinder,' grinned the man.</p>

  <p>'Might fix something up.'</p>

  <p>'Sure, lady. What do you think this is, the Ritz?'</p>

  <p>'Slip me that chicken,' said Jo.</p>

  <p>Arthur produced the chicken as a magician produces a rabbit and handed it
  to Jo, who in turn passed it to the man with the black face.</p>

  <p>'Pretty slick chicken, that,' allowed Jo.</p>

  <p>When the man had finished his examination the chicken looked pretty
  black.</p>

  <p>'It's a good chicken,' he agreed, holding it out to Jo.</p>

  <p>'I don't want it,' she told him. 'Put it on some fire.'</p>

  <p>'Listen, lady, are you nuts?' the man asked.</p>

  <p>'Certainly not,' the girl replied. 'Why?'</p>

  <p>'Nothing,' said the man. 'Only I was afraid you figured yourself home in
  your own kitchen and had mistaken me for your cook.'</p>

  <p>'You don't look a bit like my cook,' said Jo. 'You're much nicer.'</p>

  <p>'Come on, quit your kidding!' The man looked pleased.</p>

  <p>'Can't you cram it into some fire?' asked Jo.</p>

  <p>The man looked at her and grinned. Then he spat copiously. After that he
  got up.</p>

  <p>'You're a funny sketch,' he said at last. 'This chicken all ready?'</p>

  <p>'Don't know,' replied Jo. 'Let me look at it. No. You look at it.'</p>

  <p>The man thereupon elevated the chicken and sighted through it, one white
  eye professionally closed. It was not a nice scene to witness under the most
  favorable conditions, but in that engine room and done by a man with a black
  face it was almost more than Little Arthur could bear. He closed both his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>'What do you see?' the girl asked breathlessly.</p>

  <p>'Wish I could see land,' said the man. 'We seem to have lost that. Even
  the fog horns are getting scarcer, but I'll cook your chicken for you,
  lady.'</p>

  <p>'That's swell,' said Jo. 'You're a good egg, chief. I've a sick man up
  there. He's been shot.'</p>

  <p>'Heard about that guy,' the chief replied as he moved searchingly about
  the confined area. 'Sort of queer thing, that. And all the time there's some
  man sitting quietly on this boat who was intended to stop that bullet. It
  just shows. You never can tell. Who'd ever thought I'd be cooking a chicken
  in a fog?'</p>

  <p>'Ain't he even going ter wash it?' asked Little Arthur.</p>

  <p>'What for?' asked Jo. 'We'll burn the dirt off.'</p>

  <p>Little Arthur shrank even smaller.</p>

  <p>'Always like my chickens washed,' he muttered.</p>

  <p>The black-faced man had found what he wanted. It as a pan&mdash;a large
  pan. This he filled with glowing coals upon which he placed another and
  smaller pan.</p>

  <p>'Ask him to dust the ashes out,' urged Little Arthur.</p>

  <p>'Will you be quiet!' said Jo, who was by now greatly interested.</p>

  <p>From a suspicious-looking can the chief poured some water into the smaller
  pan, plopped the chicken in it, then covered the whole affair with a
  galvanized washtub.</p>

  <p>'Wouldn't want no better oven than that,' he remarked, surveying his rude
  creation.</p>

  <p>'Who wouldn't?' muttered Little Arthur.</p>

  <p>'You're a genius,' said Jo admiringly. 'Have a hunk of cake.'</p>

  <p>She produced a box of cake from beneath the duster she had managed to
  retain and tore off the cover.</p>

  <p>'Just a little,' said the chief.</p>

  <p>'Go on. Take a lot.'</p>

  <p>He accepted the cake and munched.</p>

  <p>'Good cake,' he observed. 'I like cake. You know&mdash;good cake.'</p>

  <p>Little Arthur decided that here was a man who would be at home in any
  surroundings. He was the same as a dog or any other animal. His reactions
  were the simple ones of the brute. The girl was like him. Little Arthur, to
  show how much nicer he was than his companions, produced his knife and cut
  himself a slice of cake.</p>

  <p>'Nice, ain't it?' said the chief, rolling his eyes at the little man.
  'Orange icing's good.'</p>

  <p>Little Arthur waited until his mouth was clear, then spoke with marked
  distinctness.</p>

  <p>'Not bad for store cake,' he replied. 'It's sticking on your chin.'</p>

  <p>'What?' asked the black-faced man.</p>

  <p>'The crumbs,' said Little Arthur.</p>

  <p>The man once more laughed coarsely.</p>

  <p>'If that's all,' he got out. 'Bah!'</p>

  <p>'That's not all,' replied Little Arthur meticulously. "There's bits of
  waste and coal dust and oil.'</p>

  <p>'I guess that chin can stand it,' the man remarked, not even taking the
  trouble to wipe his chin.</p>

  <p>'No doubt,' agreed the pickpocket, 'but I almost can't.'</p>

  <p>'What do you mean?' the other demanded truculently.</p>

  <p>'Oh, nothing,' said Little Arthur, 'only there's a lady present and you
  ain't doing yourself justice with that chin. Looks like an ashcan, it
  does.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, all right,' the chief grumbled, looking furtively at Josephine, now
  seated on the box by the chicken. 'All right. Here goes.'</p>

  <p>He produced a wad of waste from his pocket and drew it across his
  chin.</p>

  <p>'That makes your chin look better,' said Arthur, 'and the rest of your
  face worse.'</p>

  <p>'Don't mind him,' Jo put in. 'I like your face as it is. Let's take a look
  at the chicken.'</p>

  <p>With a steel rod the man raised the washtub. Three pairs of eyes were
  fastened on the chicken.</p>

  <p>'Smells good,' said the man. 'She'll be done pretty soon now&mdash; sooner
  than in a regular oven.'</p>

  <p>She was. The chicken was done, or partly done, in a surprisingly short
  time. The man with the face refused.</p>

  <p>'No, thank you, lady,' he protested. 'I put on the feed bag before we
  shoved off. Take her up to your young man with the compliments of the
  chef.'</p>

  <p>For some reason Jo blushed. She realized she was blushing, and that made
  her blush all the more. The girl was amazed. She had never thought of herself
  as having a young man. With her it had always been grabbing off a guy or
  being grabbed herself. She had never had a real, acknowledged young man for
  herself. Hers had been the easy-come, easy-go type. For a moment she caught a
  mental image of Peter's pale, bony face, with its sardonically set mouth and
  mild blue eyes full of vagrant fancies. God knows what he actually thought of
  her. She had not tried to show herself in an any too favorable light. Making
  herself impudent and more than plenty tough. True, he wasn't quite a young
  man, but then she did not care much for that sort. There and then amid the
  smells and grime of the ship's clanking bowels she knew that Peter meant much
  to her and that she was going to make herself mean even more to Peter in
  spite of all the Yolanda Wilmonts in the world. But perhaps he was dead by
  now. She had forgotten about his wound.</p>

  <p>'Thanks, chief,' she said, holding out a hand to his. 'Got to hurry. Grab
  that bird, Little Arthur, and come right along.'</p>

  <p>'Here,' said the man with the black face, producing a thick cup, and
  tipping the gravy from the pan into it. 'Here. Might as well take this along.
  It'll strengthen the young feller up.'</p>

  <p>'God bless your black face, chief,' said the girl as she turned to the
  ladder. 'You're white, clean white inside.'</p>

  <p>'I know that poem, too,' cried the man, as if some one had touched a
  button somewhere concealed about him. 'I can say it all by heart.'</p>

  <p>'Wish he hadn't said that,' thought Josephine as she toiled up the ladder.
  'If Peter knows that poem I'll eat this chicken myself and throw the bones in
  his face.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap10"
     name="chap10">10. DINNER IS SERVED</a></h2>

  <p class="first">'Listen, Peter,' said Jo a few minutes later. 'Do you know
  any poetry?'</p>

  <p>Peter skidded back to consciousness with a wince. His arm was bad. Little
  flames of pain licking stiff flesh.</p>

  <p>'What's that?' he asked, blinking at the girl. 'Do I know any what?'</p>

  <p>'Poetry,' said Jo. 'You know. Like Milton or Ogden Nash?'</p>

  <p>'I can't quote a line written by either gentleman,' Peter told her. 'Did
  you wake me up with the weird hope that I'd say little pieces for you?'</p>

  <p>'No,' went on Jo, 'but if you're sure you don't know any poetry and you
  swear never to learn any, I'll give you a cup of chicken soup and a chunk of
  the chicken from which it oozed.'</p>

  <p>'I don't know any poetry and I never will,' said Peter in a disgusted
  voice. 'I don't feel at all like poetry unless it's composed entirely of bad
  words.'</p>

  <p>'Good!' exclaimed Jo, then hesitated. It could not be true. 'Sure you
  don't know anything about the mighty God that made you and you're white,
  clean white, inside?' She asked, watching his face anxiously.</p>

  <p>'No,' said Peter, 'and I doubt very much if I am. Got a lot of different
  colors inside. So have you.'</p>

  <p>'Let's not go into that,' Jo hastily put in. 'Here, take this soup and get
  that inside. Little Arthur, break out your magic knife and carve that ruddy
  chicken. I've got some cake and a small ration of coffee.'</p>

  <p>She produced the cake and thermos bottle. Little Arthur placed the chicken
  between Aspirin Liz and the Bishop, then attacked it with his invaluable
  knife. Peter sat drinking an exceedingly pungent liquid which was nearer to
  chicken grease than chicken soup. However, it was hot and had food value in
  it. The other passengers looked on with expressions ranging from greed and
  envy to revulsion bordering on nausea. The little group, through lack of even
  the most primitive implements, was forced to be rough in its dealings with
  the chicken. Even Bishop Waller went at his section with tooth and nail.
  Yolanda strove to be dainty about it and nearly lost her share as a
  consequence. Soon she was gnawing away as cheerfully as the rest of them.</p>

  <p>'My dear,' said Bishop Waller after his portion had disappeared into the
  pontifical belly, 'my dear young lady, how did you manage the chicken, may I
  ask?'</p>

  <p>'We stole him or her,' Josephine replied. 'Little Arthur and I.'</p>

  <p>The good Bishop thought this over, with a slight frown on his fine face.
  At last his expression cleared, and he favored Jo with a smile.</p>

  <p>'I am glad I asked that question after rather than before eating,' he
  admitted with happy sophistry. 'It was a delicious chicken in spite of the
  irregular circumstances surrounding its getting. But perhaps the less said
  the easier digested.'</p>

  <p>'Was it already cooked?' asked Aspirin Liz.</p>

  <p>'No,' replied Josephine. 'Just dead. We cooked it down in the engine room.
  There's the sweetest man there with a dirty black face and grimy hands. He
  helped us cook it.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, dear!' murmured Yolanda, looking as if she had been poisoned. 'A
  dirty black man!'</p>

  <p>'Only his hands and face,' Jo protested. 'Don't know about the rest of his
  body. May have been as white as yours, if that's saying anything.'</p>

  <p>'It's saying too much,' Yolanda retorted. 'What did you cook it in?'</p>

  <p>'A couple of old ashpans,' Jo informed her.</p>

  <p>'My word!' said Yolanda, looking at the others with round eyes. 'Think
  what we have inside us besides chicken!'</p>

  <p>'A lot of satisfaction,' Peter put in, 'where before there was nothing but
  craving. Good work, Jo! Our tame thief is a credit to his profession.'</p>

  <p>'May I ask,' began the Bishop, 'why you occasionally refer to this
  seemingly harmless little chap as being a thief and a criminal?'</p>

  <p>'Because he is,' Jo answered proudly. 'A regular thief.'</p>

  <p>'Only a pickpocket, yer honor,' Little Arthur protested. 'Just pockets,
  yer know. Little pockets. Never much in 'em.'</p>

  <p>'But you take what little there is, don't you, Little Arthur?' Jo
  insisted.</p>

  <p>'Nobody ever minds much,' he answered.</p>

  <p>'Nobody has much these days to mind,' Aspirin Liz observed. 'You'll have
  better and bigger pockets to pick before you die, Little Arthur.'</p>

  <p>'I'm thinking of giving it up,' he declared. 'Now that I've met a holy man
  &mdash;a real, live bishop, that is.'</p>

  <p>'Splendid, Little Arthur! Splendid!' cried the Bishop. 'I'm gratified my
  presence has done some good. You might celebrate your career of regeneration
  by returning to me the watch you borrowed when Mr. Van Dyck asked for the
  time out there on deck. I've been wondering which of you had it.'</p>

  <p>'Honest,' said Little Arthur, producing the watch from a side pocket,
  'that watch had just gone clean out of my mind.'</p>

  <p>'Very little can go clean out of your mind,' Aspirin Liz assured him.</p>

  <p>'Honest, now,' the small crook repeated. 'Honest. I mean it. The Bishop
  shouldn't take out a valuable watch like that in a lot of wet fog. It's
  fairly criminal, it is. He'll spoil it.'</p>

  <p>'It was most unwise, I'll admit, with you around,' said the Bishop with a
  benevolent smile as he courteously accepted the watch. 'However, all's well
  that ends well. We'll say no more about it.'</p>

  <p>'Thank you, yer honor,' said Little Arthur gratefully.</p>

  <p>'Your extensive acquaintance with judges, I imagine, has led you into
  error,' the Bishop continued. 'I do not judge men professionally, Little
  Arthur. Rather, I endeavor to save them. Privately, I have my own opinions
  which, I am sorry to say, are not high&mdash;far, far from high. I am not
  "your honor." If you insist on a title I might bear up beneath the weight of
  "your reverence."'</p>

  <p>'Thank you, yer reverence,' said Little Arthur. 'Nice-sounding name, that
  &mdash;yer reverence. Never liked "yer honor" much. Always meant worry and
  trouble and a lot of &mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Lying,' Jo helpfully supplied.</p>

  <p>A large, rough-looking person wearing a strangely ingratiating smile had
  been standing for some minutes gazing down from his impressive height upon
  the remains of the chicken. It speaks well for Josephine Duval's character
  that she never suspected any one of being really bad at heart save herself,
  and she rarely if ever thought much about that. A few other passengers had
  gathered unobtrusively round the outskirts of the large rough-looking
  man.</p>

  <p>'Young lady,' he now inquired, addressing Jo, in tones of respectful
  admiration, 'that was a mighty slick trick you did with that chicken. How did
  you manage to work it, if I may be so bold?'</p>

  <p>Flushed with triumph, Jo turned to one whom she fondly believed to be her
  latest conquest.</p>

  <p>'You're right it was a slick trick,' she told him. 'When it comes to the
  survival of the fittest you can't afford to stand on ceremony.'</p>

  <p>'I should say not,' the man replied, a little over-enthusiastically. 'What
  did you do, miss? Let me in on it.'</p>

  <p>'What did I do? Why, I helped myself, of course,' she asserted. 'And this
  little beggar helped me.'</p>

  <p>'I found it,' Little Arthur proudly declared.</p>

  <p>'Oh,' said the man, beaming so energetically he looked as if he were going
  to explode. 'So you found it. Now, that is good.' His voice dropped to a
  confidential whisper. 'And where did you find it, miss?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'That would be telling,' Josephine hedged.</p>

  <p>'Go on, miss,' the great man almost whined. 'Why not tell us? We're all
  hungry, too&mdash;like yourselves.'</p>

  <p>'I suspect the integrity of that large individual's motives,' Bishop
  Waller murmured to Peter.</p>

  <p>'There's an air about him,' agreed Peter. 'A faint suggestion of
  menace.'</p>

  <p>Jo looked undecidedly at the man for a moment, then her impressionable
  French heart melted. Besides, it would cost her nothing. Furthermore, she
  decided, when a man as big as this one got hungry all over he was a danger to
  his fellow men until glutted with food.</p>

  <p>'Well, I'll tell you,' she began. 'There's a boob of a truck-driver aboard
  this ferry &mdash;'</p>

  <p>A spasm of terrific emotion passed over the great man's face.</p>

  <p>'Yes, miss,' he broke in, his voice trembling with what Jo fully believed
  to be eagerness. 'You said a boob of a truckman. Hear that, everybody. Ha,
  ha! A boob of a truck-driver! That's good! Oh, that's very good!'</p>

  <p>Pleased by the reception of her words, Josephine endeavored to better
  them.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' she continued, 'a regular boob of a truck-driver. Must be a poor
  fish &mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Ha!' cried the great man. 'A poor fish, eh? So he's a poor fish no less
  than a boob?'</p>

  <p>Jo nodded quite seriously.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' she said. 'Do you know what he did, the saphead?'</p>

  <p>'What did he do, lady?' the man whispered, as if he were having trouble
  with his throat. 'Tell us what the saphead did.'</p>

  <p>'Why, he left his truck unguarded,' replied Jo. 'That's what the saphead
  did just strolled off and left his truck flat.'</p>

  <p>'And what did you do?' asked the great man.</p>

  <p>'My dear,' broke in Bishop Waller, 'I strongly advise against any further
  exchange of confidences.'</p>

  <p>But the Bishop's cautious admonition came too late. Jo was in full
  cry.</p>

  <p>'What did we do?' replied the girl. 'Why, naturally, we helped ourselves.
  Little Arthur there yanked out his knife, cut a hole through the canvas
  covering, and reached out a chicken just as easy as taking a rabbit from a
  hat. And the funny part of it is the half-wit who's driving the truck isn't
  any the wiser yet. When he discovers that hole I'd like to take a look at his
  face.'</p>

  <p>An amazing transformation had taken place in the great man's features.
  They were congealed now in an expression of superhuman malevolence in which a
  smile of tremendous bitterness cracked about his bared teeth. Outside of the
  movies Jo had never seen such a face, such an evil, sadistic mask. The man
  was wheezing as if some one had kicked him in the stomach.</p>

  <p>'You'd like to see his face?' he gasped; then, squatting with surprising
  agility, he flung out : 'Then take a good look at it. This is his face, see
  &mdash;the boob's face, the face of the poor fish&mdash;the&mdash;the
  &mdash;the &mdash;' his voice broke in a sob of rage&mdash;'the face of the
  saphead. Take a good look at it,'</p>

  <p>But Jo had looked at the man's face once, and it was the last thing in the
  world she wanted to do again. It was nothing to see, that face. As a matter
  of fact, it was too much to see. The girl closed her eyes, but that awful
  face still hung suspended in her memory. Then the face moved and brought its
  baleful influence directly to bear on Little Arthur, who recoiled in mortal
  terror. Still squatting and with hands extended, their fingers suggestively
  working, the owner of the face drew near to Little Arthur. In a surprisingly
  short space of time he was dangling in mid-air and then approaching both his
  mortal as well as rear end at a high rate of speed. With an effect of
  complete finality the small man made a large noise as he hit the deck and
  remained very much there.</p>

  <p>Then, as if what had already occurred had not been sufficiently
  surprising, an even more surprising element literally mingled itself with the
  situation. Before the great face had time to pick up Little Arthur and do
  some more things with him, Bishop Waller, with a roar of righteous
  indignation, launched himself in defence of his so recently acquired convert.
  It was a magnificent and inspiring spectacle. It became even more stupendous
  when the bared ecclesiastical head established resounding contact with the
  ungodly abdomen of the truck-driver and sent him crashing to the planks.
  Outside, the fog horn told the fog what the ferry-boat thought of it, waves
  splashed against the sides, and ghostly voices drifted past, but within the
  cosy cabin the truck-driver lay stunned while Josephine and Aspirin Liz took
  up positions and stood waiting for the kill.</p>

  <p>In the meantime the highly edifying passengers, feeling sure the truck-
  driver would never survive to drive his truck to its destination, made a
  general movement in its direction. One can gain no true conception of the
  rugged determination of commuters, of their resource and clever teamwork,
  until one has witnessed them in concerted action. Respectable husbands and
  fathers&mdash;not to mention business executives, clerks and stenographers
  &mdash;literally swarmed all over the truck. Men accustomed to the feel of
  golf clubs now swung chickens aloft with equal dexterity. The backbone of the
  nation was looking for its grub and finding it in lavish quantities.
  Presently other lorries were attacked by fresh detachments of commuters
  unable to find standing room on the original one. Every one seemed to have
  entered into the spirit of the occasion. Every one was alert and eager, ready
  to do his or her bit. Outcries of gratification could be heard as new
  discoveries were made. In vain did the drivers of the lorries protest. They
  were borne down and walked over by the sheer weight of numbers.</p>

  <p>It was upon this scene of pillage and confusion that the originator of the
  outbreak opened his shocked and amazed eyes. With dawning comprehension he
  saw several figures, each provided with one of his chickens, dart through the
  small door leading to the engine room. It was enough to drive the past from
  his memory. The present was all-important. With a wild cry he sprang to his
  feet and staggered to the defence of his truck which, by the time he reached
  it, contained little to defend.</p>

  <p>Bishop Waller with a sigh of relief sank back on the seat and received the
  congratulations of the party. Loudest among these were those of Little
  Arthur, now partially recovered from his cataclysmic contact with the
  deck.</p>

  <p>'I don't know what has come over me,' the good Bishop observed rather
  sadly. 'It must be this fog. First I lend my voice to an already sufficiently
  undignified and acrimonious dispute with an unseen ship, then calmly enter
  this cabin and assault one of our fellow creatures after having devoured his
  property. I have forsaken God, I fear.'</p>

  <p>'But what that monster was doing to me was something fearful, yer
  reverence,' Little Arthur advanced consolingly. 'You arrived in the nick of
  time. I was nearly jarred out, I was.'</p>

  <p>'Granted,' responded the Bishop, 'I had some slight provocation, but,
  Little Arthur, for all of that, it would gall me immeasurably to lose my
  chance of salvation through saving your wicked life, as invaluable as it may
  be to you.'</p>

  <p>Not knowing which end of this observation to accept, Little Arthur
  maintained a discreet silence.</p>

  <p>In the meantime the situation was developing in the engine room. The man
  with the black face was telephoning passionately to the captain.</p>

  <p>'Yes, sir,' he was telling him. 'They're stealing all my fire, every
  blessed damn coal.'</p>

  <p>'What do they want with your fire?' the captain wanted to know. 'It ain't
  as cold as all that.'</p>

  <p>'They're trying to cook some chickens,' the black face roared.</p>

  <p>'Where did they find the chickens?' came back the skipper's voice.</p>

  <p>'How should I know that?' screamed the engineer. 'And does it really
  matter? Maybe they flew aboard.'</p>

  <p>'Did you say chickens?' asked the skipper. 'Sure they're not
  seagulls?'</p>

  <p>'Think I don't know the difference between a seagull and a chicken?' the
  other end of the wire inquired none too pleasantly.</p>

  <p>'Not saying you don't,' said the captain. 'But a seagull and a chicken
  might look a lot alike when they're skinned or unfrocked or whatever they are
  when all their feathers are off.'</p>

  <p>'They look altogether different,' said the engineer with cold dignity.
  'And the word is "plucked" in case you want to use it some time.'</p>

  <p>'How do they intend to cook these chickens?' asked the captain, a note of
  real interest creeping into his voice.</p>

  <p>'Fricassee,' howled the engineer, his black face becoming swollen with
  anger.</p>

  <p>'Not a bad way,' said the skipper thoughtfully. 'Very fond of chicken
  fricassee. You know, Charlie,'&mdash;and here his voice took on a persuasive
  note &mdash;' you see, Charlie, I've been thinking. We've been a long time
  without food. The way things stand I don't know where the hell we are and
  where the hell we're going, and as long as that fire ain't doing us any good
  we might as well be using it for something. What do you say, Charlie?'</p>

  <p>For a few moments Charlie was unfit to say anything.</p>

  <p>'I say,' he managed to get out at last, 'that my engine room ain't no
  damned galley for a flock of commuters with their goddam chickens. That's
  what I say.'</p>

  <p>'But listen, Charlie,' said the skipper, trying to reason with the man,
  'fricasseed chicken's mighty nice eating when it's properly done.'</p>

  <p>'Should we be worrying about fricasseed chicken,' demanded Charlie, 'when
  it looks like the fishes will be gnawing on our bones?'</p>

  <p>'Might as well gnaw on the chicken's bones first,' came the philosophic
  voice of the skipper. 'Gnaw and let gnaw, say I. How about it, Charlie?'</p>

  <p>For reply the telephone broke into an incoherent babble. The skipper hung
  up the receiver, called a weary-looking deckhand, and went below to deal in
  person with the situation.</p>

  <p>It was a strange scene indeed that greeted the skipper's gaze. Had it been
  not quite so small, the engine room or stokehold of the ship would have
  called to mind a prairie dotted by the fires of early American settlers
  engaged in cooking their rude evening meal. Perhaps it was because the place
  was entirely treeless that the captain gained this impression. One glance was
  sufficient to convince him it would be difficult to find a more unusual
  situation on any ferry-boat anywhere. Commuters, squatting in all positions,
  were holding chickens or various parts of chickens above piles of glowing
  coals. So frequently were such figures encountered that the captain found it
  difficult to walk without stepping on one of his passengers. The room was
  pervaded with an appetizing aroma of sizzling fowl. It was enough to make his
  eyes as well as his mouth water. In a corner of the compartment the engineer
  was standing with a newspaper raised between himself and his uninvited
  guests. After his conversation with his superior officer he had apparently
  lost all interest in what was going on in his engine room.</p>

  <p>'Hello, Charlie,' said the skipper smoothly. 'Catching up with the news, I
  see.'</p>

  <p>'Why not?' replied Charlie over the rim of his paper. 'You seem to care
  more about chicken than running this here ship. I'm interested in racing,
  myself. Picking to-morrow's winners.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' observed the skipper, 'from the way it looks now you'll have to
  cable in your selection from mid-Atlantic. I don't even smell land about, but
  I do smell chicken.' He smiled engagingly down upon his passengers. 'You've
  taken things into your own hands, I see,' he continued in a not unfriendly
  voice. 'Well, I'll tell you what we'll do. If you provide us with a brace of
  chickens, we'll let you continue cooking yours.'</p>

  <p>Several chickens were immediately produced and offered for the inspection
  of the skipper. Selecting two promising specimens of looted fowl, he turned
  to the newspaper.</p>

  <p>'Charlie,' he began, 'what do you know about cooking chickens? Here are
  two beautiful birds.'</p>

  <p>'Everything,' replied Charlie surprisingly. 'Slip me these chickens and
  I'll show these home-loving-trainsnatchers how to cook. I don't care what
  happens to this engine room any more.'</p>

  <p>He rigged up his odd-looking oven and put the chickens through their
  paces. As he watched the expressions of envy on the faces of the pioneers
  gathered round him, his annoyance died away and he felt himself a little
  consoled.</p>

  <p>'Can't you cram just one more in that contraption?' a voice asked
  wistfully. 'My fingers are better done than my chicken.'</p>

  <p>Good-naturedly the black-faced man complied with the request. Some time
  later when the skipper emerged from the stokehold on his way to the pilot
  house, he was gnawing an a chicken's leg and carrying various carefully
  selected ports in his other hand. The driver of the assaulted truck followed
  the happy man's progress with gloomy, misanthropic eyes.</p>

  <p>'Gord,' he muttered, 'what a trip this turned out to be. Even the captain
  himself is no better than a thief.'</p>

  <p>Quiet water and moonlight and a world lost in fog. Hardly any one awake
  now. A few shadows by the rail. Sleep had overcome the commuters, their
  stomachs no longer empty. Back in the cabin they, the commuters, were draped
  and crumpled about in fantastic shapes as if a spell had been laid upon the
  ferry, its passengers turned to inanimate objects, inanimate save for the
  noises they made in their sleep. These are never attractive.</p>

  <p>Moonbeams strained through fog&mdash;an eerie effect. It was like living
  inside a huge halo, its edges washed by black infinity. The ferry glided
  smoothly on, ever maintaining its position in the center of a white circle.
  It was as if New York had been packed in cotton and magically removed. There
  was no New York, no Jersey shore, no open bay slashed by the prows of ships.
  Only fog horns sounded remotely in the darkness, and the occasional warning
  clang of a bell.</p>

  <p>'Sounds like a cow out there in the fog,' said Peter to the girl leaning
  on the rail beside him. 'A lonely cow with a bell on grazing among the
  waves.'</p>

  <p>'The old girl will get all foggy inside,' said Josephine poetically.
  'Maybe we're scaling a Swiss Alp and are coming to a pasture.'</p>

  <p>'Wouldn't mind that in the least,' said Peter.</p>

  <p>'But wouldn't I be a drawback?' she asked. 'A sort of depraved lady fly
  reclining brazenly in the ointment?'</p>

  <p>Peter looked down into the face upturned to his. Full lips a little moist,
  and shadows round the eyes. Somehow she contrived to make herself every inch
  a woman. And she made every inch felt.</p>

  <p>'You're more like a wicked spider,' he told her thoughtfully. 'A
  dangerously attractive spideress.'</p>

  <p>He heard her laugh softly and did not dislike the sound.</p>

  <p>'I cling to the words "attractive," "wicked," and "dangerous," 'she said.
  'They are more than I usually get from you. How about going inside and lying
  down?'</p>

  <p>'A dangerous spideress would make a suggestion like that,' he
  observed.</p>

  <p>'I mean on opposite sides of the ship,' she assured him. 'Under the
  circumstances your interpretation would be madness.'</p>

  <p>'Then I say, no go,' he said. 'My head feels too giddy to park itself
  anywhere at present, and this damn arm keeps on throbbing. I like it out here
  with you.'</p>

  <p>'Mean that?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, strange as that may seem.'</p>

  <p>'I don't think it's so strange. After all, I'm sort of nice.'</p>

  <p>'Can't quite see you as being nice, Jo. You're not at all that way. You're
  really a very bad girl.'</p>

  <p>'That's how I mean,' she agreed. 'I'm nice and bad.'</p>

  <p>'Just plain bad,' he said. 'Why did you tell Aunt Sophie and Sanders and
  all those people that you were going to have a baby by me?'</p>

  <p>'Well, aren't I, some time, maybe?' she asked. 'I thought I could read the
  writing on the wall.'</p>

  <p>'To begin with you're not,' said Peter, 'and in the second place if you
  were going to have one of my babies there'd be no writing on the wall about
  it.'</p>

  <p>'All right, mister,' she answered with a little shrug. 'Perhaps the wish
  was father to the thought.'</p>

  <p>'Your prospective babies are none of my business.'</p>

  <p>'You're a hard man, Peter Van Dyck.'</p>

  <p>'But a just one,' said Peter.</p>

  <p>'Can't you find a little moral weakness somewhere about you?'</p>

  <p>Silence. Jo moved her tireless young body closer to the man's good arm.
  She liked being there. He was such a clean man. Daring little dreams came to
  her across the water&mdash;half-formed hopes swaddled in fog. But deep in her
  heart Josephine did not have any too much hope. Her confidence was all on the
  surface.</p>

  <p>'Peter.'</p>

  <p>'Well?</p>

  <p>'You're letting me stay mighty close to you.'</p>

  <p>'Why bring the matter to my attention?'</p>

  <p>'Do you like us this way, Peter, all scrunched up?'</p>

  <p>'The way you phrase it hardly presents an idyllic picture to my eyes.
  Scrunched up&mdash;no. Make it better.'</p>

  <p>'I suppose you're such an old stick you just can't help being a stickler.
  Scrunched up is a fine way. It's so cosy.'</p>

  <p>'Sounds almost immoral.'</p>

  <p>'Your mind is much worse than mine, Peter.'</p>

  <p>'Wouldn't be a bit surprised, young lady.'</p>

  <p>'I'm glad you told me, Peter. I like your mind that way.'</p>

  <p>'You deliberately make it that way. I think I'll call you a troll.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, what a word to call me! I rather like it, too. I'd have done well in
  the days of Falstaff.'</p>

  <p>'You'd have run the fat knight ragged.'</p>

  <p>'Sir John was ragged most of the time&mdash;spiritually as well as
  sartorially.'</p>

  <p>'You and Sir John have much in common,' said Peter, considering her
  thoughtfully. 'Do you read books ever?'</p>

  <p>'Mostly pornography,' she told him. 'I read until I come to the nasty
  parts, then I stop to think of you.'</p>

  <p>'Please spare me your thoughts.'</p>

  <p>Silence again. The slow indolent churning of propellers and the crinkling
  splash of waves gossiping sleepily under the bow.</p>

  <p>'Peter.'</p>

  <p>'All right. What now?'</p>

  <p>'Isn't it funny about being in love and all?'</p>

  <p>'I don't know. What are you trying to drag me into?'</p>

  <p>'I mean about being in love,' the girl went on in a small reflective
  voice. 'When you are in love, I mean. It's so swell if everything's okay. Not
  quite so lonely any more, and everything takes on a fresh meaning&mdash;
  because much more interesting. Even dull things. Happy days waiting just
  round the corner. And all the time you're kind of quiet and still inside.
  It's like waiting for the curtain to go up or just after it's gone down. And
  you have private thoughts about God, and wonder if you're all right with Him
  and if He's going to see you through. Whenever you pass a furniture store you
  stop to look at the beds. I like a nice bed, Peter. Don't you?'</p>

  <p>'I feared you would end up on some lewd note,' he remarked, secretly
  feeling the mood behind her words. 'What have we in common with a bed?'</p>

  <p>'I don't mean right now, Peter. Not this very minute. But some day we
  might own a bed between us, don't you think?'</p>

  <p>'How should I know? We might own a flock of beds.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, you mean the babies. About how many babies would you like?'</p>

  <p>Peter grinned at the fog.</p>

  <p>'Oh, anywhere between five and ten,' he told her.</p>

  <p>'I might manage five,' she said, 'but ten&mdash;oh, why bother about that
  now? We'll see how we stack up after the first five.'</p>

  <p>'Sure,' replied Peter. We'll take stock of ourselves then, but in the
  meantime, has it occurred to you that we're not even married yet?'</p>

  <p>'It has,' Jo said regretfully. &mdash;' And what about Yolanda?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Peter in a flat voice. &mdash;' What about Yolanda?'</p>

  <p>'Is it all fixed about our loving each other?'</p>

  <p>'You seem to have arranged it quite nicely,' said Peter. He was more in
  earnest than he cared to admit even to himself.</p>

  <p>'Go on, then,' she urged in a low voice. 'Say it just once. You can lie a
  little if you have to.'</p>

  <p>'You mean tell you in cold blood&mdash;in so many words&mdash;that I love
  you?'</p>

  <p>'I don't care how many words you use, but I would like you to do a little
  something about your blood. Can't you warm it up a bit? I've been like that
  about you for a long time.'</p>

  <p>'How do you mean like that about me?' he asked. 'Go on and say it
  yourself.'</p>

  <p>'I love you, Peter,' she said in a small voice.</p>

  <p>Jo was no longer a bold girl. Rather crushed and subdued, if anything. A
  little timid. She had thought a lot about love, talked a lot about love, and
  practiced it a little, but never before had she told a real live man she
  loved him and meant it as she did now. And Peter, looking down at her,
  whether it was because he was becoming a trifle delirious or just beginning
  to realize what previously he had vaguely suspected, decided it would not be
  at all difficult to tell Jo he loved her, provided he said it very quickly
  and slurred a little on the edges.</p>

  <p>'IloveyouJo,' he said at full speed ahead. 'Damned if I don't.'</p>

  <p>'God, how quick!' gasped Jo. 'Where did it get to? Never mind. It sounded
  swell while it lasted. And now?'</p>

  <p>She held her face up to his. Peter complied. He was at it quite a while.
  Long enough to let the freshly risen Yolanda witness more than enough.</p>

  <p>'Peter!' she cried. 'Are you mad?'</p>

  <p>'Through and through,' he muttered, removing his lips from Jo's slightly
  parted ones.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap11"
     name="chap11">11. SIX CHARACTERS EMBARK IN MORE FOG</a></h2>

  <p class="first">For a brief moment Peter stood confronting Yolanda, his face
  shocked expressionless; then, remembering her question, he actually feigned
  madness. Waving his hands about as if leading a multitude in song, he burst
  out in a high, quavering voice with:</p>

  <p>My country 'tis of thee, Sweet land of liberty&mdash;God help the
  king.</p>

  <p>'Stop that awful noise,' Yolanda commanded imperiously. 'It's bad enough
  to be caught doing what you were doing without singing about it.'</p>

  <p>'He's a little light in his head,' Jo said in a quiet voice. 'And he's not
  singing about it.'</p>

  <p>'He's crazy in the head if he thinks he's fooling me,' ripped out Yolanda.
  'He acts more like a drunken man than a delirious one.'</p>

  <p>To force conviction home on Yolanda, the quavering voice redoubled its
  efforts, this time running short of words:</p>

  <p>I love your rocks and brooks Gangsters and dirty crooks&mdash;Who's got
  the king? I &mdash;</p>

  <p>'Peter Van Dyck, if you don't stop making those sounds you'll wake the
  whole ship up,' said Yolanda.</p>

  <p>'Spangles,' said Peter inanely. 'Pretty spangles and banners by the
  score.'</p>

  <p>'Do you think he's really gone?' Yolanda asked doubtfully.</p>

  <p>'Must be,' Jo replied. 'He mistook me for you. Didn't you notice how he
  was acting?'</p>

  <p>'I hope you don't imagine I let him carry on like that?'</p>

  <p>'I sincerely hope not,' said Jo. 'But just the same, it was pretty nice.
  Hadn't you better get him inside? He might suddenly take it into his head to
  go in swimming.'</p>

  <p>'Heavens!' exclaimed Yolanda. 'He appears to think he's a seagull
  now.'</p>

  <p>Josephine considered the man seriously.</p>

  <p>'Either that or a dog,' she said at last. 'Come here, Fido.'</p>

  <p>'There's not much similarity between a seagull and a dog,' Yolanda
  remarked in a superior voice.</p>

  <p>'Not much,' replied Jo, 'but a little&mdash;just enough to make it
  interesting. <i>Couchez-là,</i> Fido.'</p>

  <p><i>'Avec vous,'</i> snapped Peter. 'I know French. Ha, ha!
  Thistledown!'</p>

  <p>Yolanda took the fluttering man by the arm and led him babbling cheerfully
  into the cabin. Jo turned back to the fog. There was a happy mist in her
  eyes. If that kiss had lasted thirty more seconds she would have been sure of
  the man for life. As it was, she felt reasonably safe. She had even room
  enough in her heart to feel pleasurably sorry for Yolanda.</p>

  <p>Dawn, instead of dispersing the fog, drew it closer together. From the air
  above her the voice of the fog horn sounded wearily. Josephine did not mind.
  The fog could solidify for all she cared. She felt herself authentically in
  love, and she was ready and willing to fight it out along those lines. She
  tossed all scruples into the face of the soggy day.</p>

  <p>Morning became evening and evening became night and the commuters became
  bored. Beer seemed so far away to Aspirin Liz that she found it almost
  impossible to think of it in the abstract. Whatever good works the Bishop had
  set out to perform in New Jersey&mdash;a state which can stand a lot
  &mdash;remained unaccomplished. Drawers no longer played an important part in
  Little Arthur's life. Even Yolanda had forgotten about the house party. She
  was in the presence of grim reality. Having slept in public, an object of
  desirous scrutiny from God knows how many pairs of vulgar eyes, the
  fastidious young woman felt herself slightly deflowered. As for Peter Van
  Dyck, he was far from well. Unlike the others he had been unable to get any
  real sleep. His arm was swollen and feverish. The Bishop feared infection,
  but kept his fears to himself. Alone of the little party Josephine seemed
  unperturbed. Yolanda gained the impression that her fiancé's secretary was
  actually deriving no little ill-bred enjoyment from the situation. Yolanda
  was not far wrong. Jo had decided that so long as she could be near Peter it
  did not make much difference what the ferry did on the surface of the sea.
  Her only anxiety was that the boat might take it into its head to do things
  beneath. The way the situation stood between herself and Peter gave her a
  strong desire to live. So she contented herself with bathing the man's arm
  and enjoying the assaulted truck-driver's attempts haughtily to disregard her
  hateful presence. She even grinned at him.</p>

  <p>Commuters were spread out all over the place. The decks were littered with
  bodies in action or repose. Several packs of cards had mysteriously appeared,
  and little groups of gentlemen were playing pinochle as happily and as
  stolidly as if they had been seated opposite one another on the 5.15 or the
  5.32.</p>

  <p>Fresh water was running low, and faces were growing dingy. Yet it may be
  surprising to learn that many of the passengers on that long-lost ferry were
  not so distressed as it might seem. Men and women with serious obligations to
  meet, debts to pay, dull engagements to keep, too familiar faces to look at
  and voices to hear, stockings to wash, furnaces to stoke, dogs to walk, and
  even letters to write, found in the fogbound ferry a good excuse ready to
  hand.</p>

  <p>In one quarter of the cabin a harmonica had broken out in spasms of lippy
  rhythm to which several stenographers danced from time to time. Jo finally
  succeeded in dancing with the assaulted truck-driver, a development which
  surprised the man as much as it pleased Bishop Waller, who enjoyed seeing
  people happy and on amicable terms.</p>

  <p>The few encounters they had with passing but unseen ships led only to
  further unpleasantness and deepened the captain's misanthropic attitude
  towards life in general and seafaring men in particular.</p>

  <p>'What sort of ship are you?' he was once so ill advised as to inquire of a
  wandering vessel.</p>

  <p>'Oh, I'm just the loveliest sort of ship,' came back the derisive reply,
  and the captain almost swooned from humiliation in the privacy of his pilot
  house.</p>

  <p>'Go to hell!' he shrieked through the fog as soon as he had collected his
  scattered faculties.</p>

  <p>'Can't even find that,' the fog retorted in tones of deep dejection.</p>

  <p>'Have you no idea where you are?' asked the skipper a little mollified by
  the other's obvious discouragement.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' came the ready reply. 'I have no idea where I are. How about
  yourself?'</p>

  <p>'1 have no idea, too,' yelled the ferry captain.</p>

  <p>A moment of brooding silence.</p>

  <p>'Well,' came the voice from the unseen ship, 'this conversation doesn't
  seem to be helping either one of us. You have no idea and I have no idea.
  That makes two no ideas. Wonder who's cornered them all?'</p>

  <p>'God knows,' retorted the skipper.</p>

  <p>'I guess He'd have a high old time putting His finger on me at this
  moment,' observed the other. 'It's a hell of a helpless feeling for a great
  big ship.'</p>

  <p>'Think of me!' exclaimed the skipper. 'I'm only a little ferry.'</p>

  <p>Silence, then muted laughter.</p>

  <p>'You're only a little what?' asked the fog.</p>

  <p>'I'm only a little ferry,' declared the skipper in a voice soft with self-
  pity.</p>

  <p>'Fancy that!' came back the other voice in most insipid tones. 'I thought
  you sounded queer all alone out there in the fog. You poor dear! Just a
  little ferry&mdash;a pansy, as it were.'</p>

  <p>The next minute a deckhand had caught the maddened skipper just as he was
  on the point of hurling himself from the rail of his ship. The man was blue
  in the face, and the fringes of the fog round him were curling up beneath the
  violence of his obscenities.</p>

  <p>'Tell 'em you're an ocean liner next time,' the deckhand said soothingly
  to his captain. 'Don't let on you're a ferry.'</p>

  <p>The captain turned on him a face in which remained only the remotest
  suggestion that it had once been human, then staggered to his pilot
  house.</p>

  <p>'And so are you,' he mouthed as he slammed the door behind him.</p>

  <p>Wondering so was he what, the deckhand sat down on a packing-box and
  breathed heavily into the fog.</p>

  <p>Josephine in the wet darkness was leaning over the rail of the slowly
  drifting ferry. Her ears and eyes were strained to the point of exhaustion in
  their efforts to tear from the fog the secrets that lay behind. Her eyes
  failed utterly, but her ears gave food for hope. From somewhere far away in
  that mysterious chaos of night and fog, sounding vaguely like rustling leaves
  in a fast receding dream, came the faint, rhythmical cadence of water washing
  against rocks. From what great distance the sound came, the girl was unable
  to estimate, but that it came from land she was convinced. To Jo at that
  moment land was all-important. Peter was getting no better. If anything he
  was worse. She disliked the feverish glitter in his eyes and the tight
  discolored skin round the wound. Exhausted as he was, he had been unable to
  go to sleep. The realization of Peter's condition had forced Josephine to
  revise her opinion of the ferry-boat. It was no place for a wounded man. She
  wanted him safe on dry land, and in some desperate way, unknown at the time
  to herself, she intended to get him there. For a few seconds longer she
  listened. That distant murmur still crept to her through the fog. Rapidly she
  made her way to the pilot house.</p>

  <p>'Captain,' she began without preamble, 'there's land somewhere about.'</p>

  <p>'Yes?' grunted the brooding man. 'About what&mdash;the North Pole?'</p>

  <p>'Maybe,' said Jo. 'But there's land nearer than that. Listen.'</p>

  <p>The captain thrust his head out of his door and listened. Several times he
  nodded, then closed the door and returned to his brooding.</p>

  <p>'Well,' asked Jo. 'What are you going to do about it?'</p>

  <p>'Nothing,' replied the skipper. 'It ain't near enough yet to do us any
  harm.'</p>

  <p>'Harm!' cried Jo. 'What do you mean, harm? Aren't you going to land this
  ferry?'</p>

  <p>'You mean run my ship aground on an unknown shore&mdash;maybe a reef or a
  mud flat? Don't be silly, lady.'</p>

  <p>'But if you don't land somewhere,' Jo protested, 'we may end up in Cape
  Town.'</p>

  <p>'What's wrong with Cape Town?' inquired the captain.</p>

  <p>'Who said anything was wrong with Cape Town?'</p>

  <p>'You don't appear to want to go to Cape Town.'</p>

  <p>'Would you want to go to Cape Town?' Jo flung back.</p>

  <p>'If what?' asked the captain.</p>

  <p>'If what?' she demanded. 'How do you mean, if what?'</p>

  <p>'I don't understand the question,' the captain replied hopelessly.</p>

  <p>'I didn't understand yours,' she told him.</p>

  <p>'Then let's begin again,' he suggested. 'You asked me would I like to go
  to Cape Town, and it seemed to me you hadn't finished what you wanted to ask
  and that you meant to say, would you like to go to Cape Town if something or
  other happened, or words to that effect. Anyway, I'm tired of Cape Town now
  and I don't want to go there any more.'</p>

  <p>'Neither do I,' Jo agreed. 'But that place we hear might be Atlantic City
  for all you know.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I certainly don't want to go to Atlantic City,' replied the skipper
  in exasperation. 'Of all places to land up in!'</p>

  <p>'Will you tell me, in God's name, what's wrong with Atlantic City?' she
  asked in a tired voice.</p>

  <p>'Will you tell me what isn't wrong with Atlantic City?' he retorted.</p>

  <p>'I don't know,' she said.</p>

  <p>'It's nice we agree about something,' he replied bitterly. 'Some little
  thing.'</p>

  <p>Jo felt inclined to ask him how he would like to go to hell, but instead
  she tried to find out where he did want to go.</p>

  <p>'I want to get back to my slip,' the captain told her. I'm not an
  excursion boat, lady. I'm a &mdash;' He stopped suddenly, remembering his
  recent encounter with that tormenting voice in the fog.</p>

  <p>Jo felt stumped and discouraged. It was not that she and the skipper spoke
  two entirely different languages. They spoke too much alike. That was the
  trouble. Probably the fog had driven both of their minds off on a spur line.
  Glancing through one of the pilot-house windows, her eyes encountered a small
  boat lashed to the deck. And whether or not her mind was off the main line,
  it still continued to function.</p>

  <p>'If you don't want to go to Cape Town or Atlantic City,' she said in a
  stipulating voice, 'or any other nice, reasonable seaside resort, will you
  let me borrow that little boat?'</p>

  <p>'Anything to get you out of this pilot house, lady,' the captain replied
  with sincere dislike. 'I'll get her into the water for you and bid you
  good-bye with the best of feelings. As soon as the fog gets you out of my
  sight I'll try to get you out of my mind.'</p>

  <p>'You don't have to go as far as that,' said Jo. 'What's to become of the
  rest of the passengers?'</p>

  <p>'You can take every damn one of 'em with you if you want,' he assured her.
  'If not, they can stay here until somebody comes and drags me home.'</p>

  <p>'I suppose you expect the grand fleet to escort your damn scow to its
  slip?' said the girl annoyingly.</p>

  <p>But the captain was past being annoyed.</p>

  <p>'I don't care if it's a grand duke,' he replied. 'I ain't going to
  endanger my ship for a handful of commuters.'</p>

  <p>A few minutes later Jo addressed herself to Little Arthur. 'Can you row,
  shrimp?' she asked him.</p>

  <p>'No,' replied Little Arthur. 'I never learned how.'</p>

  <p>'Only how to pick pockets, eh?'</p>

  <p>'I'm trying to forget that,' he said.</p>

  <p>'I used to row,' put in Bishop Waller. 'Very fond of the exercise at one
  time.'</p>

  <p>'You never will be again,' said Jo. 'Not after to-night.' She turned back
  to Little Arthur. 'Little man,' she continued, 'if a man of God and honest
  ways is willing to row, you can at least try. And that's just what you're
  going to do if you want to come along with us. You're going to row us to land
  if you have to get out and push.'</p>

  <p>'I can bear a hand with one arm,' said Peter.</p>

  <p>'It's a silly-sounding sentence,' she told him, 'but I guess your heart's
  in the right place.'</p>

  <p>'A sailor once rowed me round Central Park,' Aspirin Liz contributed
  reminiscently.</p>

  <p>'Yeah, and after that treat what did he do&mdash;collapse?' Little Arthur
  inquired.</p>

  <p>'Are you looking for trouble?' the lady asked with terrifying
  quietness.</p>

  <p>'No,' said Little Arthur quickly. 'We've got trouble. I was just thinking
  &mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Don't,' Aspirin Liz admonished him. 'That is, don't think about me.'</p>

  <p>Up to the moment of departure Yolanda Wilmont protested against this new
  and dangerous venture. She could see no good resulting from going rowing at
  night in a fog. However, as the others gave every indication of abandoning
  the ship as well as herself and the luggage unless she altered her attitude,
  Yolanda reluctantly tagged along with the strangely assorted party.</p>

  <p>'If you hadn't insisted on bringing that dangerous criminal along,' she
  told Peter, 'you never would have been shot. Obviously the murderer was
  aiming at him.'</p>

  <p>'Can't say as I blame the murderer,' said Aspirin Liz, heaving herself
  over the side of the ferry to the small boat below her.</p>

  <p>'I blame him for missing,' put in Jo, following the ex-model down into
  what impressed her as being illimitable space turned uncompromisingly
  black.</p>

  <p>'Ain't you all ever going ter stop nagging at me?' asked Little Arthur.
  'Everybody should be friendly and all at a dreadful time like this.'</p>

  <p>It required the close co-operation of both the Bishop and Peter, wounded
  as he was, to lower the small crook into the bobbing boat. Passengers shouted
  advice while from the upper deck the captain peered down at them
  sardonically.</p>

  <p>'For a worthless thing, Little Arthur,' grunted Peter, 'you place too high
  a value on that damned life of yours. Pardon the word, Bishop.'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps it would make us all feel better if we called a temporary
  armistice on the niceties of speech,' observed the Bishop as his foot
  searched thoughtfully for something or anything in the darkness below him.
  'At the moment I feel like expressing myself in terms employed by only the
  most recondite students of obscene language.'</p>

  <p>'So long, chief,' called Jo from the boat to the black-faced man who was
  looking gloomily over the side. 'Next time I steal a chicken I'll let you
  cook it for me.'</p>

  <p>'Hope I never see a chicken again,' said the chief. 'Good luck, lady.'</p>

  <p>'Hope you never see one of mine,' put in the truck-driver. 'Here, little
  miss,' he called down to Jo, and stooping, passed her several packages. 'You
  forgot to take these when you and the rest of this ship's company were
  robbing my truck. Thanks for the dance.'</p>

  <p>'Thank you,' replied Jo. 'How did you know I liked cheese and
  crackers?'</p>

  <p>'I sort of hoped you didn't,' said the man, grinning down at her.</p>

  <p>'Shove off,' Peter sang out to the Bishop, who was resolutely manning the
  oars. 'And, ladies, please stop milling about so blithely. The boat might
  lose its patience.'</p>

  <p>As the little boat shoved off into the fog and darkness, a cheer broke
  from the passengers lining the rails of the ferry. Individual voices quickly
  became indistinct and merged with the general babble. Suddenly a parting
  impulse of malice warmed Little Arthur's chilled breast.</p>

  <p>'What did you say you were, Captain?' he called in a high-pitched voice.
  'Only a little what?'</p>

  <p>Immediately the fog was made hideously vocal by the voice of the now
  invisible skipper. Jeers and catcalls broke from the passengers. They seemed
  to be directed against their own ship's officer. The Bishop increased his
  stroke.</p>

  <p>'If you're trying to row us out of the way of all that bad language,' said
  Josephine, 'you might just as well save your strength, Bishop. We don't mind
  it in the least.'</p>

  <p>'It's odd, but neither do I,' Bishop Waller got out between strokes. 'It
  gives me a kind of vicarious kick&mdash;I think that is the word.'</p>

  <p>'Listen,' Jo commanded. 'It would never do to lose that offshore sound or
  whatever it is.' For a moment the voluntary castaways held their breath in
  anxious silence. 'All right,' said Jo at last. 'It's coming from dead
  ahead.'</p>

  <p>'Can't you say straight ahead?' asked Little Arthur. 'We're too close ter
  being the other.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap12"
     name="chap12">12. FROM THE NOWHERE INTO THE UNKNOWN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">'Things are not so desperate,' said Jo, breaking a heavy
  silence made a little less awe-inspiring by the heaving of the indomitable
  Bishop. 'Here we all are, the six of us. Three men and three women&mdash;just
  as it should be. There's Peter and myself, Yolanda and Little Arthur, and
  &mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Just call me Liz,' supplied the retired model. 'Everybody does. Aspirin
  Liz&mdash;the former being one of my vices.'</p>

  <p>'A name in a million,' said Jo. 'I like it. Well, then, there's Aspirin
  Liz and the Bishop. All cosy in a little boat.'</p>

  <p>'With more than enough water under our feet,' put in Little Arthur
  miserably, 'to swaller us all in the blink of an eye.'</p>

  <p>'Are you by any chance bracketing my name with that unwashed mite of a
  criminal?' Yolanda demanded arrogantly.</p>

  <p>'I knew he was a criminal,' replied Jo, 'but I didn't know he was an
  unwashed one. How did you find that out?'</p>

  <p>'I am accustomed to clean men,' Yolanda asserted coldly. 'Clean men with
  fresh linen.'</p>

  <p>'Have you gone as far as that with Little Arthur already?' inquired Jo.
  'You must have worked fast and deftly.'</p>

  <p>'One needs only to look at the man to get an unpleasant conception of what
  lies beneath,' vouchsafed Yolanda.</p>

  <p>'Is that any way to talk?' Little Arthur was on the verge of tears. 'Call
  yourselves ladies, do yer? If you'd like to know it, I am washed, and if I
  hadn't been looking for a&mdash;-a &mdash;'</p>

  <p>'For clean linen,' said Jo helpfully.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Little Arthur. 'If I hadn't been looking for a fresh pair of
  those I'd of been taking the old ones off right now in the privacy of my own
  kip.'</p>

  <p>'Do you?' inquired Jo.</p>

  <p>'Do I what?' asked the pickpocket.</p>

  <p>'Take 'em off?' the girl replied.</p>

  <p>'Of course I do,' the small man lying stated.</p>

  <p>'I didn't know,' Jo told him. 'Some men don't. You impressed me as being
  such a type.'</p>

  <p>'Don't see why you should be discussing my habits at all right out loud in
  this fog and weather,' Little Arthur complained. 'Ain't we got no private
  lives?'</p>

  <p>'Thus far,' observed the red-headed girl, 'my life has been much too
  private. I have decided to take steps.'</p>

  <p>'We won't have any lives at all,' Peter put in, 'if you two charming young
  things don't abandon Little Arthur's drawers as well as what's in them, and
  listen like hell for the shore.'</p>

  <p>'Well meant but indelicately expressed,' replied Jo. 'In moments of great
  danger the mind has a way of fixing itself on trifles. Should we sing,
  perhaps? People always do in little boats.'</p>

  <p>'Not a bad idea, that,' Bishop Waller pronounced. Singing lightens the
  spirits. Why not try a snatch of a song while I row?'</p>

  <p>'I know a song,' said Aspirin Liz.</p>

  <p>'Let's have it,' suggested Peter.' Any one got a pill?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'Might have one in my bag,' said Jo. 'I'll look.'</p>

  <p>The girl succeeded in finding a rather soiled aspirin tablet and passed it
  to Liz.</p>

  <p>'What are you going to use for water?' Little Arthur asked.</p>

  <p>'Never use water,' she said. 'Keep it under my tongue. It's better that
  way.'</p>

  <p>Little Arthur shook his head in the darkness. This woman was hard
  indeed.</p>

  <p>When the tablet had been satisfactorily adjusted under Aspirin Liz's
  tongue, she broke suddenly into violent song, her voice floating mournfully
  across the water:</p>

  <p>O bury me not on the lone prairie-e-e Where the wild coyotes will howl
  o'er me, But lay me out in a quiet churchyard In a grave dug six by
  three.</p>

  <p>So sang Aspirin Liz as a depressed silence fell upon the occupants of the
  little boat. Their spirits were not lightened.</p>

  <p>'Golly,' said Little Arthur with a slight shiver. 'That's an awfully sad
  song. Them howling coyotes. I can hear 'em now.'</p>

  <p>'Wish I could,' replied Jo. 'I'd let a chorus of wild coyotes howl o'er me
  if they'd give me a prairie to park on. There must be something solid behind
  all this fog and darkness.'</p>

  <p>'Wonder what it is,' said Yolanda in a subdued voice.</p>

  <p>'Africa, maybe,' Jo answered.</p>

  <p>'Wish it were the Riviera,' observed Peter.</p>

  <p>'Ain't we got enough water already without adding some foreign river to
  it?' the ignorant little felon demanded.</p>

  <p>No one paid any attention to him, each being occupied with his or her
  thoughts.</p>

  <p>'It's a miscellaneous cargo we have aboard,' observed Aspirin Liz at last.
  'A bishop and a crook and a lady of fashion&mdash;what are you, Mr. Van Dyck?
  I'm a model, myself&mdash;that is, I was one before I lost my shape.'</p>

  <p>'Don't know what I am exactly,' Peter replied, somewhat in doubt himself.
  'What am I, Jo?'</p>

  <p>'An indifferent coffee importer,' answered Jo. 'And I'm his invaluable
  secretary.'</p>

  <p>'He's the only surviving male of one of New York's oldest families,'
  Yolanda Wilmont proclaimed, not without pride.</p>

  <p>'Go on! Is he, now?' said Little Arthur. 'Well, I'm proud to be wearing
  his drawers, but if we don't find a scrap of dry land soon it looks like that
  old family is about due to lose its last male survivor.'</p>

  <p>'Right, Little Arthur,' Jo maliciously agreed. 'Instead, they can lay
  claim to having the soggiest non-surviving male of any old family
  anywhere.'</p>

  <p>'That, at least,' remarked Peter, 'would lend me a little
  distinction.'</p>

  <p>'I like you better dry,' said Jo, 'and very much alive&mdash;pulsating, in
  fact.'</p>

  <p>'What do you mean by that?' asked Peter.</p>

  <p>'My dear,' Jo replied. 'Spare the Bishop's feelings.'</p>

  <p>'You're a wicked lady,' declared Little Arthur. 'And you use horrid words
  &mdash;pulsating.'</p>

  <p>'I'll use horrid words on you,' Jo told him. 'Change places with the
  Bishop or this skiff will ride higher from the loss of one feather-weight
  crook.'</p>

  <p>'Which end of these sticks do you pull?' gasped Little Arthur after the
  perilous exchange of seats had been made, not without endangering the safety
  of all hands. 'Just to hold 'em still is hard enough, much less waggling 'em
  about.'</p>

  <p>'Don't make yourself out any dumber than you are,'replied Jo. 'Put the wet
  ends of these sticks in the water and pull your small but black heart
  out.'</p>

  <p>'Sure, sonny,' said Aspirin Liz encouragingly. 'Find a pocket in the fog
  and pick your way through it.'</p>

  <p>'I can't stand wisecracking women,' Little Arthur remarked to misty chaos.
  'Bad taste and worse manners.'</p>

  <p>Slowly the rowboat moved ahead, but very slowly&mdash;too slowly. Peter
  critically watched his valet.</p>

  <p>'Little man,' he said, 'you're not pulling these oars. They're pulling
  you. Put your shoulders into it.'</p>

  <p>'Put my shoulders into what?' groaned Little Arthur. 'Wish I could put
  them into a bed.'</p>

  <p>'Use your back, man,' the Bishop commanded somewhat impatiently.</p>

  <p>Little Arthur laughed hysterically.</p>

  <p>'Use my back,' he sneered. 'Can't even use the mere end of my back. Every
  time I try to put it down on the seat these here oars deliberately flip it
  off as if it was a moth. First thing you know I'll be flying. And you ask me
  to use my back.'</p>

  <p>'If you don't use your back I'll kick it,' said Jo.</p>

  <p>'Want me to sit on your lap&mdash;asked Aspirin Liz. 'That would hold it
  down.'</p>

  <p>'That would break it down,' he told her. 'Let me alone for a minute. I'll
  get the hang of it soon. What do you expect a pickpocket to be&mdash;a motor
  boat all of a sudden?'</p>

  <p>'I expect you'll be a sinking body if you don't get a move on,' Josephine
  declared.</p>

  <p>'Have a heart, lady,' he pleaded. 'This was your idea, having me row. I
  didn't ask for the job.'</p>

  <p>'I think he talks too much,' said Peter. 'Let's gag the little
  blighter.'</p>

  <p>'I'm gagging already,' the little blighter complained. 'No need to help
  me. Fair sick I am, what with all this brutality and bobbing about.'</p>

  <p>'Pipe down, everybody,' Jo commanded. 'I hear something.'</p>

  <p>Something was wallowing close by in the fog.</p>

  <p>'Who's there?' called Peter.</p>

  <p>'Only us,' replied a familiar voice ironically.</p>

  <p>'You mean the ferry?' Peter almost screamed.</p>

  <p>'Yoohoo!' called the voice. 'That's who we are.' For God's sake go away,'
  yelled Peter.</p>

  <p>'What for?' said the voice. 'We like it here. Want to come back home?'</p>

  <p>'No!' shouted four voices from the rowboat, Little Arthur being too
  discouraged to answer and Yolanda too disgusted.</p>

  <p>All sorts of unpleasant noises were launched from the ferry. Personal
  insults fell thick around them. Even Little Arthur was stung to life and
  action.</p>

  <p>'How's our dear sweet captain?' he inquired, with an astounding vocal
  inflection.</p>

  <p>Immediately the captain told them not only how be was, but also how he
  hoped they were and where he hoped they would go. He referred individually
  and collectively to the characters, antecedents, and habits of every one in
  the rowboat, and finished up by threatening to run the small craft down. It
  was too much for Little Arthur. He stood up suddenly, and like Ajax defying
  the lightning, impotently thumbed his nose at the fog in the direction of the
  ferry. There was a loud cry and a small splash. Little Arthur was no more
  with them.</p>

  <p>It required some minutes to drag the wet snatch-purse back over the side.
  He was delicate about it. His fear of rough handling was equal to his fear of
  cold water. He was a small, soggy mass of moist lamentation, the utter
  futility of ever changing one's undergarments being his chief source of
  complaint. At last he lay panting in a puddle in the bottom of the boat.</p>

  <p>'Bruised, body and soul,' he muttered. 'A nervous breakdown, no less. A
  mangled man.'</p>

  <p>'If you ever try to give us the slip again,' Jo gritted at him between her
  small white teeth, 'you'll be a mutilated man.'</p>

  <p>'What he choked. 'Do you think I tried to do it?'</p>

  <p>'Of course you tried to do it. Wanted to run away,' said Jo.</p>

  <p>'Across the bottom of the sea, I suppose?' he retorted. 'I ain't no
  blarsted mermaid.'</p>

  <p>'Well, if you're not a mermaid,' she continued, 'I'd like to know what you
  are. Certainly, you're not human.'</p>

  <p>'Might not be human,' the man admitted, beginning to doubt it himself.
  'Don't feel like it right now. But I ain't no mermaid, at any rate, and I
  ain't no trained seal, either, like you think I am, making me do boat-racing
  all over the fog.'</p>

  <p>'Little valet,' put in Peter with calm conviction, 'if you don't get up
  quietly and quickly and stop all that yapping, I'm going to put you beyond
  the reach of the law for ever, and that with this one hand.'</p>

  <p>Little Arthur took a look at the one claw-like hand extended over him and
  thanked his God it was not two.</p>

  <p>'Yes, sir,' he muttered. 'Can I sit down by you?'</p>

  <p>'I'm going to row,' said Peter. 'Rested up, Bishop? I'll take the
  starboard oar.'</p>

  <p>When this arrangement had been worked out, the row-boat once more got
  under way. The gratuitous but hardly constructive suggestions of the ferry-
  boat's passengers followed them through the fog, then gradually died away.
  Silence settled down on the occupants of the rowboat.</p>

  <p>Peter and the Bishop were too deeply occupied to speak. Little Arthur was
  too miserable, Yolanda too aloof. Josephine listened for offshore sounds, and
  Aspirin Liz seemed content to sit and do nothing. The minutes piled up and
  drifted by until time became as nebulous as the fog. Still the two rowers
  stuck to their oars. Peter was cracking under the strain. His face had grown
  a little more haggard, his cheeks flushed. Josephine quietly removed the oar
  from his hand and seated herself by the Bishop.</p>

  <p>'Give way,' she said. 'I hear waves washing on something more substantial
  than fog.'</p>

  <p>Peter sank down by Aspirin Liz and again the boat moved forward, tunneling
  its way mole-like through the fog. Sounds of a chugging motor came from the
  port side.</p>

  <p>'Who are you?' called the Bishop, resting on his oar.</p>

  <p>'A group of American citizens, sir, running rum into their native land,'
  came the prompt reply.</p>

  <p>'You're frank about it,' Bishop Waller declared.</p>

  <p>'We can afford to be in this fog,' the voice answered cheerfully. 'We're
  more than frank&mdash;we're abandoned.'</p>

  <p>'We're abandoned, too, but without any rum,' Josephine informed the
  American citizens.</p>

  <p>'That's bad,' came the sympathetic reply. 'Perhaps you would care for a
  bottle?'</p>

  <p>'We'd devote our lives to it,' yelled Peter. 'Dedicate them to the
  bottle.'</p>

  <p>'Have you a corkscrew?' called Jo.</p>

  <p>'You all can't be American citizens,' came back the voice, 'if you haven't
  one of those things. Stand by to break the Eighteenth Amendment, and keep on
  shouting.'</p>

  <p>The chugging of the motor drew nearer, and presently a hand holding a
  quart bottle, and reminding Peter of a picture of Excalibur in some long-
  forgotten book, was thrust through the fog.</p>

  <p>'It is open,' said the hand cryptically. 'Remove the cork and drink.'</p>

  <p>'Awfully good of you,' said Peter, plucking the bottle from the fog.</p>

  <p>'Don't mention it,' replied the voice, equally courteous.</p>

  <p>At this moment a stealthy breath of wind blew the fog aside. The moon swam
  through the mist. The night became vivid.</p>

  <p>'Why, you're all naked,' said Peter, too stunned to be surprised.</p>

  <p>'Yes, quite,' said the man in the motor boat. 'We all are.' A synchronous
  gasp broke from the rowboat.</p>

  <p>'God send back the fog,' prayed the Bishop, in a fervid voice; then added,
  with a note of prudence 'Temporarily, at least.'</p>

  <p>Although there were only five naked figures in the motor boat, they were
  quite enough for those in the smaller craft. To them the motor boat was
  fairly swarming with naked figures. It was by no means difficult to
  distinguish between three men and two women. It is a singular thing yet
  nevertheless true that there seems to be a lot more to five naked persons
  than to five persons either fully or partially clad. There was certainly more
  than enough to those five naked bodies.</p>

  <p>'Gord,' breathed Little Arthur. 'How come you lost all yer clothes?'</p>

  <p>'We didn't lose them,' the naked spokesman replied. 'We took them
  off.'</p>

  <p>'Whatever for?' the crook asked incredulously.</p>

  <p>'Don't ask such silly questions of the gentleman,' Josephine primly told
  the pickpocket.</p>

  <p>'I see no good reason for asking him any questions at all, silly or
  otherwise,' put in Yolanda, her eyes averted but not closed.</p>

  <p>'Oh, don't mind us,' said the man easily. 'This is our way of doing
  things, that's all.'</p>

  <p>'It's a poor way, indeed,' said Bishop Waller. 'Wouldn't it be more
  thoughtful to do such things elsewhere?'</p>

  <p>'We don't mind where we are,' declared the man.</p>

  <p>'You seem to think we're considering your plight,' replied the Bishop,
  'whereas in reality we're considering only ours. It's distressing enough to
  be investigating an unknown body of water without the enforced companionship
  of five naked ones.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, you'll get used to all that,' said the man prophetically.</p>

  <p>'Do you mean by that,' inquired the Bishop, 'that you plan to continue
  this close association?'</p>

  <p>'If that great big strapping woman with the mole on don't stop grinning at
  me,' chimed in Little Arthur, 'I'm going to jump clean back in the
  ocean.'</p>

  <p>'Where's the mole?' demanded Jo.</p>

  <p>'What a thing to ask,' the valet retorted indignantly. 'It's where nobody
  should see it, that's where it is.'</p>

  <p>'Then why look?' asked Bishop Waller.</p>

  <p>'Nonsense,' Aspirin Liz observed with the utmost calm. 'She's a fine
  figure of a woman. I was very much like her myself in my day.'</p>

  <p>'What do yer mean?' cried Arthur. 'Mean ter say you ran about naked?'</p>

  <p>'I usually stood or lay,' replied the imperturbable Liz.</p>

  <p>'And you openly admit it in public?' the small crook got out in a scared
  voice. 'Oh, you are a one, you are. A regular broad and no mistake.'</p>

  <p>'Fiddlesticks!' snapped the retired model. 'I made my living that
  way.'</p>

  <p>'It ain't a thing to dig up out of the past,' Little Arthur told her,
  'much less to brag about when we're all in danger.'</p>

  <p>The naked man and his companions had been enjoying this conversation. One
  of the women now spoke.</p>

  <p>'Why don't you get naked like us, midget?' she asked Little Arthur with a
  touch of malice. 'Or are you afraid you'd fall apart?'</p>

  <p>'Mind your own business,' the small man answered stoutly. 'Should be
  ashamed of yourself.'</p>

  <p>'I've lost all shame,' said the woman.</p>

  <p>'Madam,' pronounced the Bishop, 'if you'll pardon me, you've lost a lot
  more than that, and if you don't do something about yourself rather soon I'm
  afraid I'll lose the training of years and go a little bit mad.'</p>

  <p>What the woman could have done about herself will never be learned,
  because the fog intervened at that moment and devoured her nakedness.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Van Dyck,' resumed the Bishop when the unique group had faded from
  view, 'I think it would be just as well if some one else tried that bottle
  other than yourself.'</p>

  <p>'Pardon me,' said Peter, passing the bottle to the Bishop. 'The incident
  rather unnerved me.'</p>

  <p>'I'm hardly tranquil myself,' replied the Bishop. 'And then, of course,
  there's the fog. That is equally, or rather almost, as dangerous.'</p>

  <p>He raised the bottle and drank, then passed it to Jo, his rowing
  partner.</p>

  <p>'My child,' he said in a hoarse voice, 'this will strengthen your
  arms.'</p>

  <p>It must have had that effect, for no sooner had the girl polished off her
  drink and passed the bottle to Aspirin Liz than she and the Bishop began to
  row with surprising speed and irregularity. The boat darted capriciously
  through the fog. Once it pivoted crazily round, then started off at its mad
  pace. Evidently Josephine and the Bishop were intent on seeing which side of
  the boat would get anywhere first.</p>

  <p>'How far is the nearest land?' called Peter after the motor boat.</p>

  <p>'That depends on which way you're heading,' came the rather disturbing
  reply. 'Not far in one direction, but thousands of miles in the other.'</p>

  <p>'Which way are we going?'</p>

  <p>'Just about the middle,' the voice drifted back.</p>

  <p>'A lot of help that is,' grumbled Little Arthur. 'Can I have some of
  what's in that bottle?'</p>

  <p>'Give the little convert a dram or so,' puffed the Bishop. It will do him
  a world of good.'</p>

  <p>'I don't want to do him any,' said Aspirin Liz. 'Here you are, crime
  wavelet, choke yourself to God while you're still redeemed.'</p>

  <p>'No need ter get nasty about it,' objected Little Arthur, accepting the
  bottle with an eager hand. 'If a bishop can keep this stuff down I ought ter
  be able ter <i>get</i> it down, at least.'</p>

  <p>With a feeling of fascinated revulsion Yolanda watched the Adam's apple as
  it bobbed and quivered, paused, then bobbed again in Little Arthur's
  throat.</p>

  <p>'There seems to be even less sex distinction in this boat than in the
  other,' she observed bitterly.</p>

  <p>Little Arthur took the bottle away from his lips and eyed the young lady
  reprovingly.</p>

  <p>'Shouldn't talk about sex,' he rebuked her. 'We've seen too much of that
  already. Have some of this?'</p>

  <p>'After watching you,' she informed him, 'I find it easy to refuse.'</p>

  <p>'Ain't nobody civil in this here boat?' the small man asked
  hopelessly.</p>

  <p>'I'm just sufficiently civil to accept a drink from you, Little Arthur,'
  Peter told him, reaching for the bottle.</p>

  <p>'Even though I am trying,' remarked the Bishop,resting a moment on his
  oar, 'still I can't quite forget that singular encounter of a few minutes
  ago.'</p>

  <p>'Wouldn't have been more surprised,' remarked Aspirin Liz, 'if that boat
  had been chock-full of bounding lions.'</p>

  <p>'No doubt we'll never learn the beginning or end of that story,' Josephine
  said. 'This whole business has a dreamlike quality.'</p>

  <p>'I don't mind it,' replied Peter drowsily. Fatigue, grog, and fever were
  assaulting him with sleep. Soon he was well off, half drunk and half in
  dreams.</p>

  <p>'It certainly wasn't no way for American citizens to act,' put in Little
  Arthur with an air of one who had always done a little more than his duty to
  his country.</p>

  <p>'Look! What's that?' cried Aspirin Liz in a startled voice, pointing to a
  white strip lying pallid beneath the altered light of a moon swinging high
  above the fog.</p>

  <p>'That's dry land,' Josephine informed her. 'Ever hear of it before?'</p>

  <p>'It seems to have been connected with my far-distant past,' said Aspirin
  Liz, her eyes devouring the smooth beach. 'That and beer.'</p>

  <p>A few minutes later the rowboat scratched its nose on the sand, but Peter
  Van Dyck never knew it. He was unconscious of what lay behind him as well as
  of what lay ahead. Had he not been so, he might have put back to sea.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap13"
     name="chap13">13. THE NAKED PHYSICIAN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Peter Van Dyck awoke to find a naked figure standing by his
  bed. This hardly placed the figure in Peter's mind. To him almost any naked
  figure would have been a considerable shock. This one was. In the course of
  his thirty-four years Peter had scarcely associated at all with naked
  figures. From what he saw of this one, he had no desire to take up the
  practice at this late date. Therefore it was with a feeling of mingled
  constraint and alarm that he swiftly cast his eyes over this unclad body
  before resolutely looking at something else. The man was carrying a small
  black bag. This added to the shock, this bag. Its owner was standing in an
  attitude of negligent but well-bred repose which struck Peter as being rather
  incongruous in view of his appalling condition.</p>

  <p>Could this stranger be, by any remote chance, the telephone man gone a
  little mad, Peter wondered, or a skilled artisan subject to one of those
  embarrassing mental aberrations popularized by Freud? Could he possibly have
  called to do things to a typewriter or a drain pipe or to perform some other
  highly specialized operation involving the removal of his clothes? Far
  simpler it was to assume that the man had been on his way to take a bath when
  he had suddenly been seized by a desire to look on another human face. But
  why the black bag? Peter decided to ask rather than to wonder.</p>

  <p>'Hello,' he said. 'Who are you?'</p>

  <p>The man smiled much more naturally than Peter had believed a naked man
  with a black bag could smile.</p>

  <p>'I am the doctor,' he said in a well-dressed, cultured voice. 'The doctor
  of the house.'</p>

  <p>Peter gagged a little at this.</p>

  <p>'What,' he began rather fearfully, 'what sort of a house is it?'</p>

  <p>'A delightful one, my dear sir,' said the doctor.</p>

  <p>'In what sense?' asked Peter.</p>

  <p>'In every sense,' the man assured him.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Peter remembered. His arm. He must have grown worse during the
  night.</p>

  <p>'Listen, Doctor,' he said anxiously, 'I must be sick as hell if you didn't
  stop to put on your clothes.'</p>

  <p>'Nonsense,' replied the doctor shortly. 'Your arm is perfectly safe. I
  call on all my patients like this.' Peter shrank back among the pillows.</p>

  <p>'Oh,' he said faintly. 'You do?'</p>

  <p>'Why not?' snapped the doctor.</p>

  <p>'Why not, indeed?' repeated Peter, with a sick smile. 'Being a doctor and
  being used to naked bodies and all, I suppose you don't mind...much.'</p>

  <p>'Much!' exclaimed the doctor, laughing scornfully. 'Why, my dear chap, I
  don't mind at all. Like it, in fact.'</p>

  <p>'And your patients?' inquired Peter.</p>

  <p>'They like it, too,' said the doctor complacently. 'They do?' asked the
  incredulous Peter.</p>

  <p>'Certainly,' replied the doctor. 'Why not?'</p>

  <p>'I wish you would stop asking me why not,' Peter complained, once more
  running his eyes rapidly over the naked man. 'From where I am I can see any
  number of reasons why not.'</p>

  <p>'What's wrong with me?' demanded the doctor. 'Tell me that.'</p>

  <p>'What's wrong with me?' demanded the doctor.</p>

  <p>'Merely that you're as naked as the palm of my hand," Peter observed.
  'Apart from that small item, you look perfectly natural.'</p>

  <p>'My patients don't seem to mind,' retorted the doctor.</p>

  <p>'I can't understand that,' said Peter. 'I should think they'd all pass out
  from sheer panic.'</p>

  <p>'My dear young man,' said the doctor, striding over to the window with his
  little black bag, 'don't be childish.'</p>

  <p>'Come away from that window,' cried Peter. 'Don't make this a public
  scandal.'</p>

  <p>'Why worry about that?' said the doctor carelessly.</p>

  <p>'Somebody has to worry about it,' replied Peter. 'I have no desire to have
  you seen in my room. It's not at all nice, Doc. Wouldn't be quite so
  degrading if you happened to be a woman, although that would be bad
  enough.'</p>

  <p>'Naked women,' answered the doctor, flexing his limbs by squatting
  suddenly. 'You'll have more than you want of those in here.'</p>

  <p>Peter was too alarmed by the man's words to be revolted by his
  actions.</p>

  <p>'What!' he exclaimed. 'Naked women in here?'</p>

  <p>'Why not?' asked the doctor, turning from the window.</p>

  <p>'Let's be reasonable,' said Peter. 'You know why not without asking me.
  You're a bit of a joker, aren't you, Doc?'</p>

  <p>'Not at all,' the doctor answered coolly. 'Some of my favorite patients
  are women, if you'd like to know.'</p>

  <p>'You mustn't get much work done,' Peter remarked thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>'Just what do you mean by that, young man?' asked the doctor.</p>

  <p>'Everything,' said Peter. 'All.'</p>

  <p>'You're vulgar,' replied the doctor severely. 'Lots of my patients are
  ladies, and all of them are naked.'</p>

  <p>'I know,' said Peter, 'but at least they have bed-clothes over them.'</p>

  <p>'I pull those off,' snapped the doctor.</p>

  <p>'Good God!' said Peter. 'What a doctor!'</p>

  <p>'As a matter of fact,' the doctor went on meditatively, 'the ladies seem
  to take to it quicker than the men.'</p>

  <p>'Take to what?' asked Peter fearfully.</p>

  <p>'Being naked,' replied the doctor.</p>

  <p>'Do you mean to your being naked or to their being naked?' Peter wanted to
  know.</p>

  <p>'To our being naked together,' said the doctor, neatly dislodging with his
  left foot a spring fly from his right shin.</p>

  <p>'Well, that seems natural, at least,' went on Peter, 'although I rather
  boggle at the term "ladies."'</p>

  <p>'That's what they are,' said the doctor. 'Perfect ladies.'</p>

  <p>'Perfect in what sense, may I ask?'</p>

  <p>'In the right sense, of course.'</p>

  <p>'You seem to have a rather distorted conception of just what is right,'
  observed Peter. 'For example, I don't think it's at all right for you to call
  naked on equally naked ladies.'</p>

  <p>'Why not?' demanded the doctor. 'I cure them, don't I?'</p>

  <p>'I know,' went on Peter reasonably, 'but curing them of one complaint
  might easily give rise to another.'</p>

  <p>'There are never any such complications, I assure you,' said the doctor
  with great dignity.</p>

  <p>'Then there must be something funny about the whole business,' muttered
  Peter, thinking of Josephine's legs. 'Or else you're a little more than human
  or 'way below par. I don't understand it at all.'</p>

  <p>'No,' replied the doctor. You're too much a creature of the flesh.'</p>

  <p>Peter laughed sarcastically.</p>

  <p>'You're entirely a creature of the flesh,' he retorted. 'I, at least, am
  part bed.'</p>

  <p>At that moment, his troubled gaze straying through the door carelessly
  left open by this mad or abandoned doctor, Peter witnessed a little incident
  not given to every man to behold. A naked man, blithely carrying a ladder
  under one arm and swinging a pail of paint in his free hand, was footing it
  silently along the hall from one direction. From the other came a woman,
  equally innocent of clothing. She was bearing a breakfast tray. Peter's
  natural assumption was that the woman upon seeing the man would drop her tray
  and run like hell while the man would do likewise. Instead, he was shocked to
  see them dexterously pass each other with an agreeable nod and continue
  calmly about their business. The man in the bed drew a deep breath, then his
  eyes sought the doctor's.</p>

  <p>'Do all the servants in this place go about like that?' he asked. 'And for
  God's sake don't say "Why not?"'</p>

  <p>'I feel like it,' said the doctor. 'How else would you have them go
  about?'</p>

  <p>Peter momentarily thought of the Bishop, then a small grin relieved the
  tenseness of his lips.</p>

  <p>'Couldn't you dig up a couple of towels for them?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'And what, pray, would they do with the towels?'</p>

  <p>'Hang them about themselves somewhere,' said Peter. 'Even you should see a
  little sense in that, Doc.'</p>

  <p>''Fraid I'm a trifle dense,' remarked the doctor, now busy with Peter's
  arm. 'Can't see it at all. Exactly where you would want them to hang the
  towels is beyond my comprehension. However &mdash;'</p>

  <p>'You are sadly lacking in imagination,' said Peter, a little bitterly.</p>

  <p>He said no more for the reason that he had suddenly disappeared beneath
  the bedclothing. A naked woman, bearing bandages and a basin of warm water,
  had come briskly into the room.</p>

  <p>'Here you are, Doctor,' he heard her say. 'Sorry I was a little late.
  There's a gentleman in Seventeen who refuses to give me his drawers.'</p>

  <p>'Sit it down, sit it down,' replied the doctor testily, and Peter wondered
  under the blankets how a naked man was able to talk like that to a naked
  woman.</p>

  <p>The doctor was struggling with the coverings. He was trying to pull them
  off.</p>

  <p>'No, you don't,' grunted Peter. 'You didn't give me any pajamas.'</p>

  <p>'Have we any pajamas on?' cried the doctor, panting a little from
  exertion.</p>

  <p>'No,' replied Peter. 'You have not. You're both naked as hell and you're
  trying to make me like you.'</p>

  <p>He heard the girl laugh horridly, then fresh hands were laid on the
  coverings. It was an unequal struggle. What with Peter's wounded arm there
  were four hands against one.</p>

  <p>'How far are you going to pull those coverings down?' he gasped.</p>

  <p>'All the way,' gritted the doctor. 'Clean off.' And he did.</p>

  <p>Peter, wide-eyed, gazed helplessly up at the two bodies bending over his.
  The girl's eyes were merry while those of the doctor were mad.</p>

  <p>'No more of this larking,' the man snapped, skillfully bathing Peter's
  arm.</p>

  <p>'Larking,' said Peter, amazed. 'Did you think I was doing that?'</p>

  <p>'Either that or making a lot of fuss over nothing.'</p>

  <p>'Nothing!' cried Peter in a frenzied voice as he ran his eyes down over
  his body. 'Oh, God, he calls it nothing.'</p>

  <p>'Stop trying to attract attention to yourself,' rasped the doctor. 'You're
  not so hot.'</p>

  <p>Peter was almost speechless with indignation.</p>

  <p>'Call attention to myself?' he repeated. 'I ask you&mdash;could I be any
  more conspicuous than I am?'</p>

  <p>'Certainly,' replied the girl, her blue eyes dancing with unholy
  merriment. 'In evening clothes you might pique my curiosity. Even in a pair
  of drawers you might give me a little thrill.'</p>

  <p>'Aren't you ashamed of yourself?' he asked her in a wounded and wondering
  voice.</p>

  <p>'Not a bit,' she replied. 'It's all in the day's work.'</p>

  <p>'Then God knows what you must do at night,' he answered. 'There's no use
  for me to try to look somewhere else, because wherever my eyes turn one of
  your naked bodies manages to get in the way.'</p>

  <p>'Why not look at yourself?' suggested the doctor.</p>

  <p>'That sight is even harder to bear,' said Peter.</p>

  <p>'Funny,' remarked the girl. 'I don't seem to mind you at all.'</p>

  <p>'Why don't you both crawl in bed with me and make it a clean sweep while
  you're at it?' Peter asked sarcastically. 'You don't seem to mind
  anything.'</p>

  <p>'I'd hate to do that,' said the doctor fastidiously.</p>

  <p>'Is that so?' said Peter. 'May I ask what is wrong with me?'</p>

  <p>'I believe you're a thoroughly evil-minded man,' replied the doctor.
  'You'll have to watch your p's and q's round here.'</p>

  <p>'Strikes me I'll have to watch a damn sight more than that,' muttered
  Peter.</p>

  <p>'Don't fret,' put in the girl soothingly. 'We'll keep an eye on you.'</p>

  <p>'That's just what I'm worrying about,' said Peter. 'There'll be too many
  eyes on me.'</p>

  <p>'You'll have quite a lot to do with your own eyes,' said the girl. 'Don't
  forget that.'</p>

  <p>'Not for a minute,' Peter answered.</p>

  <p>There was a scuffling sound at the door as Little Arthur, armed with a mop
  and pail, scrambled nakedly into the room.</p>

  <p>'Boss!" he cried wildly, running up to the bed. 'They've taken away all my
  clothes and I'm as naked as a babe.'</p>

  <p>'Naked as a what?' asked Peter.</p>

  <p>'A babe,' replied Little Arthur, a strange and awful sight. 'A small
  child.'</p>

  <p>'You impress me as being much nakeder than even the smallest child,' said
  Peter. 'You're simply epic.'</p>

  <p>'Don't know what that is, but how about yourself?' asked Little Arthur.
  'And look at that brazen hussy."</p>

  <p>'At least I've a bandage on,' replied Peter. 'And don't ask me to look at
  anything. Never thought I'd see so much in all my life.'</p>

  <p>'What the hell good is a pickpocket in a nudist colony, I ask you?' the
  little man tragically demanded.</p>

  <p>'That is something to ponder on,' observed Peter. 'I should imagine you'd
  have to be far cleverer with your hands than you've ever been before.'</p>

  <p>'Might just as well have no hands at all,' Little Arthur answered
  bleakly.</p>

  <p>'So far as pockets are concerned,' added Peter. 'However, I should imagine
  that many men in a nudist colony would find one pair of hands hardly enough.
  By the way, are we in a nudist colony?'</p>

  <p>'Either that or among the white-slavers,' breathed the little crook. 'It
  all comes to the same thing.'</p>

  <p>'Which is?' inquired Peter.</p>

  <p>Little Arthur blushed.</p>

  <p>'Don't ask that,' he stammered, 'in front of this here woman.'</p>

  <p>'Oh,' said Peter. 'Have you met these nudes already?'</p>

  <p>'If not them, I've met a dozen just as bare,' Little Arthur lamented.
  'Can't keep my eyes in one place long enough to tell one of 'em from the
  other. Don't know which way to turn.'</p>

  <p>'Why not crawl into your pail?' asked Peter.</p>

  <p>'Wish I could,' the naked felon replied. 'If it wasn't full of water I'd
  stick my head in it.'</p>

  <p>'Do it anyway,' snapped the doctor, speaking for the first time since
  Arthur's arrival, 'and hold it there awhile.'</p>

  <p>'Nice way for a doctor to talk,' said Little Arthur, offended. 'It's a
  murder house, that's what it is, and worse.'</p>

  <p>'I was speaking personally rather than professionally,' the doctor told
  him. 'Speaking professionally, I'll have to ask you to get about your
  business, whatever it may be.'</p>

  <p>'They want me to swab up the bathroom,' the under-nourished snatch-purse
  complained with a sob in his voice. 'Think of it. Me swabbing up a bathroom
  the way I am.'</p>

  <p>'I should think the way you are would be ideal for bathroom swabbing,'
  allowed Peter.</p>

  <p>'You're almost as bad as they are, boss,' the little man replied. 'Don't
  you feel sort of funny lying there naked and all?'</p>

  <p>'Sure,' said Peter. 'I feel so funny I think I'm going to cry.'</p>

  <p>'Hurry,' commanded the doctor. 'If you don't want to get into any trouble,
  do exactly as you're told. Otherwise, things will go hard with you, let me
  assure you of that. We stand for no nonsense.'</p>

  <p>'If you ask me, that's all it is,' said Little Arthur, moving slowly
  towards the door. 'Too damn much nonsense. Running around naked and carrying
  on. I suppose you think that's sensible? Well, it isn't. It's just plain
  childish, I calls it. It's worse than that&mdash;it's nasty, that's what it
  is. It ain't even human.'</p>

  <p>The doctor pointed a sharp instrument at the scolding crook.</p>

  <p>'Want me to operate on you?' he asked.</p>

  <p>Little Arthur instinctively glanced at himself.</p>

  <p>'Oh, no,' he breathed. 'No, indeed.'</p>

  <p>Peter chuckled in spite of his own unprotected state. He had never seen
  this mite of a man so utterly sincere.</p>

  <p>'Then be gone!' thundered the doctor.</p>

  <p>'See here,' protested Peter. 'You can't talk to my man like that.'</p>

  <p>The doctor looked darkly at Peter, then suddenly snipped the gleaming
  blade at him.</p>

  <p>'How would you like that?' he asked in a gloating voice. 'Or this?' Here
  the doctor made an even more excruciating snip at Peter as if visualizing the
  horrid deed.</p>

  <p>Peter shrank visibly in every fiber of his body.</p>

  <p>'There's no need to be so vivid about it,' he muttered. 'So garishly
  dramatic. I'd do exactly as he says, Little Arthur, if you want to remain
  intact. This man is sort of crazy.'</p>

  <p>'Can't I stay here with him?' pleaded the little man. 'Naked as he is, I
  can at least recognize his voice.'</p>

  <p>'Go,' said the doctor, and Little Arthur, mop and pail, disappeared from
  the room.</p>

  <p>'Listen, Doctor,' began Peter when his valet had gone nakedly to whatever
  lay ahead. 'I've been hesitating over this question for some time. Tell me
  honestly&mdash;am I in a madhouse or a socially prominent brothel, or in the
  shrine of some fanatical cult, or just where am I?'</p>

  <p>'I am not in a position to satisfy your puzzling curiosity,' replied the
  doctor, repacking his little black bag.</p>

  <p>'Then it certainly must be terrible,' observed Peter, 'because you
  apparently stop at nothing.'</p>

  <p>'Come,' said the doctor to the girl. 'We must be skipping.'</p>

  <p>'Don't skip before me,' put in Peter. 'I don't think I could bear the
  sight and still retain my reason.'</p>

  <p>'Your wound, which luckily is slight,' continued the doctor, ignoring
  Peter's remark, 'will be dressed again this evening.'</p>

  <p>'Couldn't you leave me a little extra dressing?' Peter asked. 'Just a
  bandage or so? I've got an idea.'</p>

  <p>'That would be cheating,' said the girl, following the doctor from the
  room. 'Besides, it would look extremely silly.'</p>

  <p>'I feel extremely silly,' Peter called after her as she left the room
  without closing the door.</p>

  <p>No sooner were his two visitors gone than Peter sprang from the bed and
  tiptoed to the window. Protected by a curtain he discreetly peered out upon a
  green, rolling lawn splashed with sunlight and early flowers nodding up
  encouragingly at him in a breeze blowing fresh from the sea. And there was
  the sea itself, the sea looking a little unfamiliar now that it was clear of
  fog. For ever and for ever it seemed to run, that flat, streaming surface,
  into a cool blue solitude untroubled by voice or wing. In his present naked
  predicament Peter very much wished he could enjoy a reasonable quantity of
  that solitude himself. Shifting his fascinating eyes from this ever-reaching
  expanse, he turned them on the dense, deep green of trees sweeping round the
  house in a half-moon of leafy protection. Branches waving in the wind, white
  clouds above, and white bodies on the dawn, white and gleamingly naked. An
  appalling sight, this, and yet not unpicturesque. Peter drew a deep breath. A
  little of his profound belief in the established order of things began to
  drop away from him. In the face of so much nudity he found himself doubting
  the reality of such terrifically reiterated facts as the Empire State
  Building, Tammany Hall, and crooning. Had the bodies been black instead of
  white, he would have felt a little better about it. Black bodies and brown
  ones had a way of getting naked. But, then, the black races were not
  essentially interested in things of the flesh like the white race. No. Black
  people took the flesh at a stride and passed on to the supernatural and other
  things of the spirit with only an occasional fleshly picnic&mdash;a good
  rough-and-tumble sort of orgy that cleared up a lot of nonsense and left
  their thoughts free for other and more important considerations.</p>

  <p>A period was put to his confused mediations by a furtive sound in the room
  behind him. Turning, he beheld still another naked body. But this naked body
  was by all odds more disconcerting than those he had previously encountered,
  and this in spite of the fact that it was the most alluringly fashioned body
  it had ever been his good fortune to behold.</p>

  <p>For a moment there was a tense, watchful silence in the room as wave upon
  wave of emotion dashed over Peter, but before he went down for the third time
  a bright little idea came to what he hoped would be his salvation. With
  nerveless limbs he staggered to the bed and disappeared beneath its
  coverings. However, the same bright idea seemed to have found an opening in
  Josephine's demoralized mind. Stopping only to close and lock the door, she
  rushed across the room to the bed, and, dragging the clothes off Peter,
  promptly emulated the example he had so brilliantly set.</p>

  <p>'Give me those bedclothes,' grated the gentleman, laying frantic hands on
  the coverings, 'and get out of my room and bed.'</p>

  <p>Josephine hung on grimly.</p>

  <p>'I won't!' she gasped. 'I won't!'</p>

  <p>'But you've left me naked as a coot,' cried Peter.</p>

  <p>'That's your worry,' she said. 'Better you that way than me.'</p>

  <p>'I don't know,' replied Peter distractedly. 'I can't say. Both ways are
  pretty awful. I do know, however, I'm not going to lie here like this and
  argue about it with you.'</p>

  <p>So saying, he gave the coverings a brutal tug, and Josephine's naked body
  appeared as Peter's burrowed under. It was a scene of desperate activity and
  concentration. Chivalry and gentleness were sacrificed to meet the demands of
  modesty.</p>

  <p>'A nice man,' Josephine panted. 'A lecherous little mole of a man. Snatch
  all the clothes from a naked woman, will you? Well, we'll see about that.
  I'll have you stripped in the shake of a lamb's tail.'</p>

  <p>'Mine's shaking enough for a whole flock,' came Peter's muffled voice. 'Go
  away and stop all this talking.'</p>

  <p>'I should worry how much it shakes.' Jo flung herself at the coverings and
  neatly twisted them from Peter, wrapping them round herself.</p>

  <p>'This can keep up for ever,' muttered Peter, 'until we're so exhausted we
  won't be able to cover ourselves at all.'</p>

  <p>'If you hope that's going to happen you're very much mistaken,' said Jo.
  'I'm under these coverings for good.'</p>

  <p>'Don't see why you're under them at all,' he protested,churning the air
  with his hands. 'An astonishing thing to do&mdash;crawling nakedly into bed
  with a man.'</p>

  <p>'You crawled nakedly into a closet with me.'</p>

  <p>'I know, but a closet's different.'</p>

  <p>'Why, may I ask?'</p>

  <p>'Obviously a closet is not arranged.'</p>

  <p>'What in the world do you mean?'</p>

  <p>'I mean that a bed is always associated with vice and carrying on,' he
  told her. 'You should know that yourself.'</p>

  <p>'I sleep in my bed,' she replied.</p>

  <p>'Well, you're not going to sleep in mine, and that's flat.'</p>

  <p>'I'm not going to do anything else.'</p>

  <p>'Who wants you to do anything else? Go on. Go back to your own bed and
  sleep.'</p>

  <p>'I can't,' she protested. 'Perfect strangers keep coming in. I was looking
  for Aspirin Liz when I saw you. Then I said to myself, "Any port in a storm,"
  and here I am.'</p>

  <p>'Let me assure you, my girl,' said Peter, hoping to frighten her, 'you
  picked far from a safe anchorage for your body. I'm drifting into danger
  myself.'</p>

  <p>'With you, Peter,' she replied in a voice he both feared and suspected, 'I
  can face any danger.'</p>

  <p>'Sure,' said Peter, 'you might even think up a few. No fooling now. Give
  me back those bedclothes. It's your turn to be naked for a while.'</p>

  <p>'Let's compromise,' suggested Jo.</p>

  <p>'We are compromised,' he retorted. 'If this gets out we'll be ostracized
  for life.'</p>

  <p>'If what gets out?' asked the girl, popping up her head interestedly.</p>

  <p>'This situation,' chattered Peter, flipping over on his stomach like a
  netted fish without having the comfort of knowing whether he had improved
  himself any. 'Please throw some coverings on me.'</p>

  <p>'He wants me to cover him, no less,' she said with nasty derision. 'Cover
  your own vast nudity. I'm too busy with mine.'</p>

  <p>By a miracle of contortion Peter succeeded in worming his body beneath the
  bitterly contested bedclothes only to find himself face to face with his
  disconcerting bedfellow.</p>

  <p>'Aren't we in a terrible fix?' he asked her in an awed voice.</p>

  <p>'I don't know,' said Jo. 'Some persons might not think it so bad.'</p>

  <p>'You're awful,' he breathed, looking at her almost with admiration. 'I
  can't stand things like this. Actually, I'm nearly exhausted from excitement.
  Might swoon at any moment.'</p>

  <p>'You're far from complimentary,' she told him, her red head thrust out of
  the clothing within three inches of his. 'What did you think of my one-piece,
  Peter?'</p>

  <p>'From the glance I got,' he said, 'you weren't wearing any.'</p>

  <p>'I certainly was,' she declared. 'One piece of skin.' Peter shivered at
  this.</p>

  <p>'How you put it!' he muttered. 'Would you ever have believed two days ago
  that we'd be like this in the same bed?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' she said without batting an eye.</p>

  <p>'What!' exclaimed Peter.</p>

  <p>'Certainly,' she replied quite calmly. 'Why not? Other people have.'</p>

  <p>'Not nice people,' he argued.</p>

  <p>'Very nice people,' she told him. 'Some of the best.'</p>

  <p>'You mean married, of course.'</p>

  <p>'Well, that would tidy up the situation a bit,' she replied thoughtfully,
  'but in view of the extraordinary circumstances in which we find ourselves
  through no fault of our own, I, for one, am willing to waive certain little
  formalities, or at least to delay them.'</p>

  <p>'You talk too much,' he answered, 'altogether too much, and you don't mean
  one eighth you say&mdash;that is, I hope not.'</p>

  <p>'I'm not so sure,' said Jo. 'Anyway, I know I love you.'</p>

  <p>'Is this a nice place to tell me that?'</p>

  <p>'If I didn't tell you that,' she retorted, 'the situation would be just
  plain wicked.'</p>

  <p>'I've never been in a wickeder,' he confessed.</p>

  <p>'Well, I've been a shade more remote myself,' she admitted. 'When one's in
  Rome, however, I suppose one might just as well make hay while the sun
  shines.'</p>

  <p>'I'm under the impression these particular Romans don't,' said Peter. 'The
  doctor seemed very snooty.'</p>

  <p>'Don't what?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'You're always so damn blunt,' he complained. 'I mean they don't make
  hay.'</p>

  <p>'Then they don't sound like Romans to me,' said the girl. 'Those old
  devils were always making hay.'</p>

  <p>'You carry logic to the point of depravity,' he objected. 'I don't
  understand,' said Jo.</p>

  <p>'Well,' he began with an effort, 'I don't quite understand myself, but
  it's like this: Logically speaking, this situation calls for a certain line
  of conduct, whereas &mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Almost demands it,' said Jo.</p>

  <p>'Don't interrupt. Whereas, morally speaking, if you were a lady you'd get
  the hell out of here and go back to your own bed.'</p>

  <p>'But, morally speaking, suppose I wasn't a lady?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'Then naturally we couldn't continue to speak morally,' he replied.</p>

  <p>'I'm glad of that,' said Jo, running her fingers through her hair.</p>

  <p>'Don't do that,' he told her. 'Don't make the slightest move.'</p>

  <p>'Shouldn't I do this?' she asked, a white arm slipping snakelike round his
  neck.</p>

  <p>'No,' he replied. 'Not that nor anything like it.'</p>

  <p>'What will you give me if I don't?'</p>

  <p>'I haven't a damn thing to give,' gloomed Peter. 'They didn't even lease
  me a check book. If they had I'd tear out the checks and rig up a girdle for
  myself.'</p>

  <p>'You'd look sweet,' said Jo.</p>

  <p>'Might not look so well,' he told her, 'but I'd feel a lot less
  public.'</p>

  <p>'You know those women?' Jo asked in a conversational voice.</p>

  <p>'No,' Peter replied. 'I don't. What women?'</p>

  <p>'Those women,' Jo went on, 'who claim that if their husbands came home
  unexpectedly and found them in bed with some man, the husbands would show how
  evil-minded they were if they thought anything wrong about it&mdash;do you
  know those women, Peter?'</p>

  <p>'There may be longer and less ably stated hypothetical questions,' replied
  Peter, 'but I never answered one. No. I don't know those women, thank
  God.'</p>

  <p>'Well, what I was trying to say,' she continued, her arm tightening round
  his neck, 'is that I'm not at all like those women.'</p>

  <p>'And if I happened to be your husband,' said Peter, 'I wouldn't believe
  you if you were.'</p>

  <p>'Then that clears away a lot of obstructions,' she observed.</p>

  <p>'May I ask what all this is leading up to?' asked Peter.</p>

  <p>"To this,' said Jo.</p>

  <p>She kissed the man and forgot to stop.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap14"
     name="chap14">14. IN PURSUIT OF PRIVACY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">'You have the most evil-looking head of red hair I ever
  saw,' Peter vouchsafed lazily some time later. 'Just like some of the smaller
  flames of hell or those snake-like locks of Medusa. And your face is baleful,
  too, in a beautiful sort of way.'</p>

  <p>He was lying on his right side, critically surveying the girl's face,
  touching it here and there with an inquiring finger-tip.</p>

  <p>'I don't know how I can lie here in bed and look at yours,' she told him,
  with a small companionable yawn. 'God must have run out of color or lost
  interest when He came to your hair and eyes. You're merely tinted. To me you
  are singularly rabbit-like.'</p>

  <p>'In what sense, may I ask?'</p>

  <p>'In appearance,' she said. 'I daresay you consider yourself the Casanova
  of the coffee world now.'</p>

  <p>'No,' he replied. 'I have no such exalted aspirations. I am merely a man
  who will stand for so much and no more.'</p>

  <p>'It's too bad you're not the kind who will go just so far and no further,'
  Jo retorted.</p>

  <p>'One can hardly do that with you,' he said easily. 'You'd drag them the
  rest of the way.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, so I'm the responsible party,' she observed, gouging him in the
  cheek, 'while you, you poor dear, are the wronged one.'</p>

  <p>'Exactly,' was the complacent reply. 'I look upon myself, thank God, in
  the most detached light. Only in a remote way, like an extra on a crowded
  stage, am I connected with the drama of your inevitable downfall.'</p>

  <p>'I don't like that crowded-stage crack,' the girl replied sombrely. 'You
  were the first player in my young life. And as for that downfall stuff, don't
  confuse life with fiction. There're more ruined women in the world to-day
  eating three square meals with an easy conscience than there are homes for
  wayward girls.'</p>

  <p>'You're hard,' said Peter.</p>

  <p>'No, I'm not,' she retorted. 'I'm reasonable. And I'm not at all
  unromantic. For instance, I think it's quite beautiful being here with you
  like this. Won't forget it for some time.'</p>

  <p>'When you feel that you're beginning to, just drop round when you're not
  busy and I'll try to refresh your memory,' said Peter.</p>

  <p>'You see,' asserted Jo triumphantly, 'you're really the hard-boiled member
  of this team. Men usually pretend to make quite a fuss over the women they've
  ruined. You strike me as being a little proud, a little strutty.'</p>

  <p>'I confess I don't know,' he admitted. 'No man ever attempted to ruin me,
  but as you say, I do suspect myself of a slight feeling of elation.'</p>

  <p>'As much as I hate to take the wind out of your sails,' she said, 'in
  justice to myself I must remind you that far from being your victim you're
  jolly well mine.'</p>

  <p>'Stuff and nonsense,' scoffed Peter. 'You're merely a butterfly on the
  wheel, crushed and broken&mdash;another conquest, no more and no less.'</p>

  <p>'You'll be crushed and broken, you little coffee bean,' she retorted
  hotly, 'if you don't watch your step. I ruined you, my lad. You didn't ruin
  me.'</p>

  <p>'It hardly seems sensible to be lying here disputing over which of us
  ruined the other,' he remarked. 'It's a highly technical question.'</p>

  <p>'My eye, it is,' exclaimed Jo. 'You're damn well seduced and I did
  it.'</p>

  <p>'Have it your way,' he said amiably. 'Just so long as one of us was
  seduced, I don't care much who it is.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, you don't,' she snapped. 'Just like a man. Ruination means nothing to
  you.'</p>

  <p>'Inasmuch as you insist on me being the ruined party,' he mildly
  protested, 'I'm doing my best to be as cheerful as possible among all the
  debris.'</p>

  <p>'And succeeding almost too well,' she retorted. 'One would think you
  actually enjoyed it.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' confessed Peter ruminatively, 'you must admit it has its lighter
  side.'</p>

  <p>'I admit nothing,' she said.</p>

  <p>'Under the circumstances that would perhaps be best,' he agreed. 'In fact,
  I'd deny everything, if you don't mind an impersonal suggestion.'</p>

  <p>'I'm telling Yolanda right off,' she told the man with malicious
  enjoyment. 'Then I'm going to tell the Bishop, and after that I'm going to
  get him to marry you to me.'</p>

  <p>'How are you going to manage that? Seduce him, too?'</p>

  <p>'If necessary.'</p>

  <p>'Rather than that should happen, I'll marry you, if not of my own free
  will, at least without public lamentation.'</p>

  <p>'Then you do care!' cried Jo, impulsively flinging herself upon him. 'How
  sweet!'</p>

  <p>'I was thinking of the Bishop,' he protested, making a poor showing of
  warding off her flashing arms.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for this record Josephine's hoydenish activities were
  interrupted by a peremptory knocking on the door which was followed by the
  command of a stern voice. The sound of the knocking returned to Peter a
  terrible realization of the situation in which he found himself. And with the
  arrival of this realization his presence of mind departed. In a naked panic
  he sprang from the bed.</p>

  <p>Open the door!' cried the voice. 'This is strictly against the rules. Open
  the door immediately.'</p>

  <p>I don't know the rules,' chattered Peter.</p>

  <p>'You should know enough not to do a thing like that,' the voice replied in
  high reproof.</p>

  <p>My God,' muttered Peter, his face blanching. 'The whole world seems to
  know already. Like what?' he asked aloud.</p>

  <p>'Don't quibble with me, young man,' said the voice. 'If you don't open
  this door I'll have it broken down. Is there a woman in there with you?'</p>

  <p>'What made you get that quaint idea?' asked Peter, motioning Jo to
  silence.</p>

  <p>'There's a girl missing,' came the answer. 'And sometimes new arrivals
  carry on.'</p>

  <p>'Carry on how?' called Peter, sparring desperately for time.</p>

  <p>'When were you born?' queried the voice.</p>

  <p>'This is hardly the proper moment for vital statistics,' retorted Peter.
  'Go away and leave that door alone.'</p>

  <p>Fresh voices could be heard in the hall&mdash;the patter of bare feet.
  There were sounds of suppressed laughter and giggling&mdash;frolicsome slaps
  on bare flesh. Peter closed his eyes and shuddered. He pictured a mass of
  naked bodies waiting outside the door to witness his disgrace. The pounding
  was resumed. In his desperation he forgot his wounded arm and began to tear a
  sheet in strips, thoughtfully putting one aside.</p>

  <p>'What are you doing that for?' Jo asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>'Through the window,' he told her. 'Tie the blankets together.'</p>

  <p>'I mean the sheet you put aside,' said the girl. 'I'm going to wear that,'
  he replied briefly.</p>

  <p>'What about me?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'Haven't time to think of that now,' he muttered. 'I'm much too busy.'</p>

  <p>'Sir Galahad in the flesh,' she said in an awful whisper as she sprang
  from the bed. 'A little nude coward.'</p>

  <p>Busily she began to tie the blankets together as the pounding was
  redoubled on the door.</p>

  <p>'Open this door, I tell you!' cried the voice. 'What are you doing now?
  What can you be doing?'</p>

  <p>'Use your imagination,' snapped Peter.</p>

  <p>'It seems fairly obvious,' shouted the voice on a note of bitterness.
  'Here goes the door.'</p>

  <p>A resounding thud shook the door as Peter grabbed the blankets from Jo,
  added his strip to them, and, securing one end of the rude line to a leg of
  the bed, tossed the other end out of the window. Twisting the remaining sheet
  round his body in bizarre tufts and slashes, he hurried to the window.</p>

  <p>'One moment, my small Mahatma,' said Jo in a low, unpleasant voice. 'Are
  you planning on leaving me behind?'</p>

  <p>'Not making any plans for you,' he replied. 'I'm simply taking care of
  myself.'</p>

  <p>Without even glancing down to see what fate lay below him, Peter seized
  the knotted bedclothing and disappeared through the window, his wounded arm
  paining unnoticed beneath its bandage.</p>

  <p>'Damned if I'll let him get away with that,' Jo muttered, her eyes
  searching in vain for some garment to wear in her flight. 'Honor is lost, but
  pride dies hard.'</p>

  <p>She ran to the window, and with a prayer in her heart to the god of
  impulsive maidens, lowered herself on the strip. Peter, glancing up with a
  strained face, almost lost his grip. More stunned by what he saw above than
  by what he feared below, he continued on his way, grimly wondering the while
  if the world had ever witnessed so indecent an escape staged in any
  language.</p>

  <p>Jo speedily overtook the queer-looking object below her. Soon she was
  ready to pass him, but hardly in a position to do so.</p>

  <p>'Can't you find some place to sit on, other than my head?' Peter inquired
  wanly.</p>

  <p>'How can I?' she called down.</p>

  <p>'I don't know,' he replied. 'That's what I'm asking you.'</p>

  <p>'I'm doing my best,' she assured him.</p>

  <p>'You're doing too damn well,' he grunted. 'If you want to know, you're
  doing your best to crush me to earth.'</p>

  <p>For answer Jo reached down with a momentarily freed hand and snatched the
  sheet from his body. Peter emitted a small shriek of dismay.</p>

  <p>'There are too many people on the lawn,' she told him. 'I need this.'</p>

  <p>'Can't see a thing for your feet,' he got out. 'They're dangling in my
  eyes.'</p>

  <p>'You must look pretty from down there,' she retorted. 'From here you're
  nothing to sneeze at, yourself,' he retorted.</p>

  <p>'A lot of people are looking down at me,' said Jo. 'A lot of faces from
  your window. They're furious.'</p>

  <p>'They'd be frozen from this end,' he assured her. 'Wish I were back in the
  fog.'</p>

  <p>His wish was almost granted, for Jo, twisting the ends of the sheet round
  her neck, allowed the covering to flow down over her body and continue on
  over part of Peter's. The effect was astounding. It was that of a creature or
  thing that had started out in life as a red-headed woman and who at some time
  during the stages of a strangely attenuated evolution had decided to finish
  off her already sufficiently bewildering body with the long and skinnily
  dangling legs and feet of a man. The great expanse of mysteries that lay
  between the flaming head and shrinking feet was luckily more or less hidden
  from view by the frantically fluttering sheet. As this weird, synthetic
  figure crawled lumpily down the strip of bedclothing, new arrivals on the
  lawn were almost too frightened to ask what it was. They seemed to prefer to
  remain in ignorance rather than to face what could not be otherwise than a
  decidedly unpleasant fact.</p>

  <p>'How much farther do we have to go?' asked Josephine, her strength rapidly
  failing.</p>

  <p>'By this method not much farther, I fear,' Peter drearily communicated
  through the sheet. 'I'm about ready to fall to my death at any moment now.
  And, by the way, before I go I'd like to say how greatly I've enjoyed your
  comfortable rest on my head. You seem to think I'm an elevator.'</p>

  <p>'Hurry up!' cried Jo. 'If I start to fall I'm going to take you with
  me.'</p>

  <p>'There is a sea of faces below,' he informed her. 'I'd like to fall on all
  of them, but their mouths are shockingly filled with teeth.'</p>

  <p>'You mean dogs?' asked Jo.</p>

  <p>'Worse than dogs,' said Peter. 'Naked bodies that once were human.'</p>

  <p>As if by special arrangement the sheet parted a moment, and Peter found
  himself gazing in through a window on a scene of domestic activity. A lady
  was drying herself with a towel while her husband, or rather, one whom Peter
  piously hoped was her husband, was busily combining the worst features of a
  setting-up exercise with those of an interpretive dance. Upon seeing Peter,
  they both nodded casually. Then as he seemed to continue on indefinitely they
  decided this manifestation was sufficiently interesting to justify closer
  examination. They hurried to the window.</p>

  <p>'I thought you were one,' the man called down to Peter.</p>

  <p>'Oh, no,' replied Peter, halting his descent. 'I'm at least two.'</p>

  <p>'I mean,' said the man, 'there's something above in a sheet.'</p>

  <p>'There is, indeed,' answered Peter. 'You don't know what all there is in
  that sheet.'</p>

  <p>'Are you exercising?' asked the dripping woman. 'Is this some new
  wrinkle?'</p>

  <p>'I'm wrinkled all over, lady,' came the voice of Jo, 'and every wrinkle
  hurts.'</p>

  <p>'If you really want to know,' called Peter, 'we're trying to escape.'</p>

  <p>'From what on earth?' asked the man.</p>

  <p>'Oh, everything,' said Peter. 'All things on earth.'</p>

  <p>'From our thoughts,' put in Jo.</p>

  <p>'Just mentally run down,' said the wet woman to her husband. 'This place
  will do them a world of good.'</p>

  <p>Peter laughed wildly. 'It's helped us a lot already,' he said. 'Morally as
  well as physically we feel like giants refreshed&mdash;like a couple of
  shooting stars, in fact.' Suddenly his voice took on a note of anguish. 'I'm
  going, Jo,' he called. 'Here drops nothing. My arm's gone bad.'</p>

  <p>As Jo reached down to grab him, she felt herself being dragged from the
  line, and even as she fell through space she managed to find some comfort in
  the thought of what a low hound Peter Duane Van Dyck was to have pulled her
  with him.</p>

  <p>They landed amid a lot of naked bodies, bearing some of them with them to
  the ground, upon which they lay for one startled moment; then, springing up,
  dashed across the grass in the direction of the nearest trees. The naked
  bodies capered after them, laughing and shouting to one another like sportive
  maniacs. And that was more or less what Peter judged them to be, only he was
  not so sure how long they would remain in a state of amiable hilarity. The
  pack of them might undergo a sudden change of mood and rend him limb from
  limb. There was no room in his thoughts at the moment for the safety of
  Josephine's limbs. Embarrassment added to fear forms a sufficiently strong
  combination to demoralize the stoutest souls. Dressed, Peter might have been
  willing to turn and face the world. Naked, he had only one idea, and that was
  to let the world and all its works very much alone.</p>

  <p>Peter might have achieved his burning ambition&mdash;the blessed
  protection of those trees&mdash;and so might Josephine, his nearest rival;
  this temporary relief might have been vouchsafed them had it not been for the
  intervention of an unkind fate in the guise of ebullient flesh and lots of
  it. It so happened that as Peter was passing a large, formal flower bed, a
  large but informal-looking gentleman materialized from it and with amazing
  agility set himself in motion to spoil Peter's plans.</p>

  <p>'A chase!' cried the man, dancing delightedly after Peter. 'Watch me catch
  you.'</p>

  <p>'Not for a moment,' Peter jerked out. 'Go chase yourself.'</p>

  <p>'This,' replied the man, leaving the ground and landing on Peter's back,
  'is much more fun.'</p>

  <p>'Damned if I see it,' muttered Peter as he fell earthward on his nose.</p>

  <p>'Caught!' cried his excited antagonist. 'Now you chase me.'</p>

  <p>So saying, he sprang up, and, taking a return pursuit for granted,
  sprinted busily across the lawn. Peter followed the man's example but not his
  direction.</p>

  <p>'If he's foolish enough to think I'm going to chase him,' Peter reflected,
  'he's due for a bitter disappointment.'</p>

  <p>At this moment his speed was checked by the sound of a desperate cry.</p>

  <p>'Help, Peter&mdash;screamed Josephine. 'If you don't come back I'll tell
  them what you did.'</p>

  <p>Peter came back. In fact, he hurried back. Although he could not see
  Josephine, he had, from the noise she was making, a general idea of her
  whereabouts. She was under the large body of an exceedingly active woman. The
  mere thought of laying violent hands on so much bare flesh to which he had
  never been properly introduced somewhat retarded Peter's celerity of
  decision. Tentatively he grabbed the twisting woman, then quickly withdrew
  his hand. The physical contact had been too much for his nerve centers.</p>

  <p>'Come on,' panted the woman, seizing his ankles. 'I'll get you down,
  too.'</p>

  <p>And get him down she did. She got him down and literally incorporated him
  into the gyrating mass of bodies, arms and legs. He had never realized before
  that there could be so much unclad flesh in any given quarter of the
  universe. Even then in this primitive struggle Peter strove to conduct
  himself as he thought a gentleman should under the circumstances, although
  exactly how a gentleman should accomplish this was beyond his conception.
  However, as the woman's grabs and thrusts became more careless and at the
  same time more telling, Peter began to realize that if the last surviving
  male of one of New York's oldest families desired to acquit himself with
  honors he must abandon the restraint of a lifetime and do his level best. He
  must fight fire with fire, which in this situation meant to seize upon
  whatever part of the woman lay most convenient to his hand. Comforting
  himself with the reflection that she had exercised little restraint in the
  handling of his body, he rose, and, taking hold of the woman, threw her
  several feet away. She landed with a gurgle of laughter and promises of
  further endeavor.</p>

  <p>'Listen, lady,' said Jo, hoisting herself up wearily from the grass by
  means of Peter's leg, an action which in other surroundings would have filled
  him with consternation, but which in these he scarcely noticed. 'Please,
  lady,' she continued, 'we're not playing. Honest, we're not.'</p>

  <p>'You give in?' cried the woman, gathering herself for a fresh assault.</p>

  <p>Then the Van Dyck blood rose rebelliously in Peter's veins. Naked or fully
  clad, a Van Dyck would never give in. Either naked or clad, it was a rare Van
  Dyck indeed who had ever given anything. Van Dycks always took. So would this
  one. He took to his heels without further parley, and Josephine took right
  after him.</p>

  <p>'They're trying to play with us, Peter,' she explained, a shade above her
  labored breathing. 'It's all a game to them.'</p>

  <p>'It may be a game to them,' he flung back, 'but it's serious as hell to
  me. Hurry up. Get a move on. That woman was simply awful. She was all
  everything.'</p>

  <p>'Wasn't she lots?' agreed Jo. 'Where're we going, Peter?'</p>

  <p>'How should I know?' he asked her. 'By rights we should be dashing gaily
  from the wings of the Follies.'</p>

  <p>'The seduction scene in this drama,' said Jo, 'was enjoyable if not
  edifying. I can see some sense in a thing like that, but this naked chase is
  beyond me.'</p>

  <p>'If you hadn't sneaked into my room,' complained Peter, 'this would not
  have happened.'</p>

  <p>'Then do you admit you were seduced?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'Is this a time to argue about that?' Peter demanded, glancing over his
  shoulder at their pursuers, now close at their heels. 'It's no go,' he
  continued, pausing to let the girl overtake him. 'Those naked fanatics can
  run like hell. We'll never make the woods.'</p>

  <p>'I don't see what good it would do if we did,' Josephine asserted.</p>

  <p>'We could climb trees,' Peter suggested dubiously, 'or dodge about behind
  them.'</p>

  <p>'Playing Adam and Eve among the trees is about as comfortable as making
  love on a beach,' Josephine assured him crisply. 'Both are exploded
  theories.'</p>

  <p>'My education along certain lines is less extensive than yours, it seems,'
  was Peter's tart rejoinder.</p>

  <p>'Well,' replied Jo, 'be that as it may, but if any one had told me a few
  days ago I'd be spending the week-end arguing about such matters with a naked
  gentleman in the face of an onrushing multitude of naked lunatics, I'd have
  said that only the first part was either possible or desirable.'</p>

  <p>'Occasionally I've dreamed about situations just like this,' said
  Peter.</p>

  <p>'Was I alone in those dreams?' Jo asked. 'Don't let's run any more.'</p>

  <p>'Those dreams were bad enough,' he replied, 'without you making them any
  worse. And we're not running, if you care to know. My arm hurts like
  hell.'</p>

  <p>'It's bleeding,' said Jo, a spark of concern in her eyes.</p>

  <p>'And the bandage is coming off. If I wasn't so worried about my own
  condition I'd be worried about yours.'</p>

  <p>'I'd like to wind the bandage around me,' said Peter.</p>

  <p>'It's not doing any good where it is,' replied Jo. 'Want me to do it for
  you?'</p>

  <p>'God, no!' exclaimed Peter, bending on her a pair of agitated eyes. 'What
  a suggestion to make.'</p>

  <p>'Why don't they come and get us?' asked the girl. 'Look! They've gone into
  a huddle.'</p>

  <p>'A pretty sight,' mused Peter, gazing upon the nude grouping. 'Wonder what
  they're cooking up?'</p>

  <p>He was not long in learning. Suddenly the intimate little mass of bodies
  resolved itself into individual nudes who galloped towards Jo and Peter. In a
  moment the two of them were surrounded by a dancing garland of men and women,
  all singing lustily a song which even in his own embarrassment made Peter
  feel a little embarrassed for the singers.</p>

  <p>'I am coming, I am coming, for the dew is on my feet,' the singers
  informed the semi-crouching couple in the center of the whirling circle of
  arms and legs and everything else.</p>

  <p>'I don't give a damn what's on your feet,' Peter yelled back, 'if you'd
  only let me stagger away on mine.'</p>

  <p>'I am coming, I am coming, where the little birdies tweet,' the naked
  dancers went on melodiously to explain.</p>

  <p>'Aren't they silly?' Peter asked, turning to the girl beside him.
  'Honestly, they almost make me forget the figure I cut.'</p>

  <p>'The trouble with this arrangement,' Jo complained, 'is that when you turn
  your back on some of them you turn your front to the others. It's the
  viciousest damn circle I've ever been in.'</p>

  <p>'Then why not stand still?' said Peter.' I'd like to lie down,' she told
  him.</p>

  <p>'All right, let's,' he replied. 'Flat on our stomachs.'</p>

  <p>'I think I'll curl,' said Jo.</p>

  <p>'I'd like to wither,' said Peter.</p>

  <p>And to the surprise of their prancing entertainers, Jo and Peter thereupon
  lay down on the grass and arranged their respective bodies according to their
  conception of what the occasion demanded and what was best to conceal.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap15"
     name="chap15">15. THE BISHOP INSISTS ON HIS DRAWERS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The naked people, when they saw their quarry go to earth,
  promptly lost interest in dancing and stood gazing down at the two strangely
  twisted figures with friendly concern.</p>

  <p>'What's the matter?' one of them asked. 'Resting?' Peter groaned aloud at
  this, and Josephine, a small white ball, giggled to herself at the
  questioner's simplicity.</p>

  <p>'No,' she replied. 'We're looking for edelweiss.'</p>

  <p>'Edelweiss grows in the Alps,' the man informed her.</p>

  <p>'Does it?' Jo said innocently. 'Then if you'll go your way we'll go
  ours.'</p>

  <p>'There must be something wrong,' another voice declared.</p>

  <p>'I suppose it would be quite hopeless,' said Peter, bitterly addressing
  his words to a cluster of bare feet. 'I daresay it would be positively
  ridiculous to try to make you understand even the most obvious things that
  are wrong with the situation.'</p>

  <p>'Not at all,' a pair of feet replied. 'We're an exceptionally intelligent
  group.'</p>

  <p>'I don't see how that can be,' protested Peter. 'Tearing about all exposed
  isn't especially intelligent.'</p>

  <p>'In pairs it might be, Peter,' said Jo, 'but not in large, impersonal
  masses.'</p>

  <p>'So that's it!' cried a voice. 'You don't like being naked, eh?
  Embarrasses you?'</p>

  <p>'Worse than that,' said Peter. 'It paralyzes me.'</p>

  <p>'If you can't guess what's wrong with us,' Josephine offered, 'I'll tell
  you under three separate and distinct headings so you won't get confused. A:
  We're naked. B: You're naked. C: We're all naked together. And if that
  doesn't make it clear, I'll toss in another letter. D: There isn't so much as
  a doll's handkerchief to cover a dozen adult members of the male, female, and
  indeterminate sexes.'</p>

  <p>'There's more of us than that,' some one remarked.</p>

  <p>'Well, after you've reached a dozen naked bodies,' replied Jo, 'it takes a
  cooler brain than mine to keep an accurate count.'</p>

  <p>'Tell 'em to go away, Jo,' said Peter. 'I don't like it here.'</p>

  <p>'Go away,' Jo told the naked people. 'He doesn't like it here. The grass
  tickles.'</p>

  <p>'I didn't say that,' said Peter. 'However, it does.'</p>

  <p>'What's wrong with him now?' asked a female member of the party. 'Has he
  lost his voice?'</p>

  <p>'I've lost everything but an audience,' Peter retorted. 'And I don't want
  that. Honor, hope, and decency are gone, all gone. I wish you would go,
  too.'</p>

  <p>'If you don't like being naked,' inquired a hitherto silent member of the
  group, 'why did you come here?'</p>

  <p>'Didn't know anything about it,' declared Peter. 'I was partly drunk and
  partly delirious, and I wish to God I was in that happy state right now.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' supplied Josephine. 'We were lured into this fix. A fully clad
  gentleman met us on the beach and offered us the hospitality of his home
  overnight. When I woke up, my clothes were gone. Immediately, I suspected a
  bad house. I still do, a little.'</p>

  <p>'Mine were gone, too,' proclaimed Peter dramatically, 'and in their place
  was a man&mdash;a naked man with a funny little black bag. What a pretty
  sight that was, first thing in the morning! A naked man with a black bag. My
  word!' 'That would be our doctor,' a voice said proudly.</p>

  <p>'He pretty nearly make a wreck of me,' snapped Peter.</p>

  <p>'Yes. That was Dr. Wolf,' another voice declared.</p>

  <p>'He looked like one,' replied Peter, 'without the sheep's clothing.'</p>

  <p>'He's a very nice doctor,' cried a girlish voice. 'He believes in
  nuts.'</p>

  <p>'So do I,' said Peter, 'after this morning.'</p>

  <p>'You're actually brilliant, Peter,' Josephine told him. 'If they'd provide
  us with a pair of blankets we could talk like this indefinitely.'</p>

  <p>'Then you are not voluntary nudists, we take it?' a lady inquired.</p>

  <p>'That's right, lady,' put in Jo. 'You can take it or leave it. Lying here
  naked like this is one of the most involuntary acts in my life. It's almost
  instinctive.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' announced a new voice authoritatively, 'you'll have to come along
  now voluntarily or otherwise. The leader wants to see you.'</p>

  <p>'The leader?' laughed Jo sarcastically. 'Do you mean that smooth little
  snake in the grass who lured us into his establishment? If so, I'm anxious to
  see him, too. I'll claw the clothes from his body.'</p>

  <p>'He doesn't wear any,' continued the man.</p>

  <p>'He did last night,' said Jo.</p>

  <p>'I know,' continued the other impatiently. 'He had just returned from a
  trip to town. Now he's like the rest of us.'</p>

  <p>'He won't be long,' cried Jo, thoughtlessly springing up in her eagerness
  for action. 'His skin will be in shreds when I get through with him&mdash; in
  tatters.'</p>

  <p>'I won't get up,' groaned Peter. 'I can't get up. It's against every
  instinct in my being. Can't we call on this procurer alone?'</p>

  <p>'You seem to have got used to the little lady,' said an insinuating
  voice.</p>

  <p>'She's an old friend,' explained Peter. 'She knew my father.'</p>

  <p>'And I fancy he would approve of your conduct?' the voice continued. 'You
  were in the same room together behind a locked door.'</p>

  <p>'Sure,' retorted Peter. 'My father used to do that himself.'</p>

  <p>'How do you mean? He used to do what?'</p>

  <p>'Why go into details?' cried Peter. 'He was a man who craved privacy
  &mdash;liked naked bodies and everything behind locked doors.'</p>

  <p>'We go in for naked bodies here,' the man replied, 'and leave everything
  else alone.'</p>

  <p>'That hardly seems logical,' said Jo. 'If true, why the naked bodies?
  Strikes me as living in the lap of an anticlimax.'</p>

  <p>'We dance and exercise as God intended us,' the man explained.</p>

  <p>'Don't tell me that,' declared Jo, warming to the argument. 'When God made
  a man and woman He had a lot more in His mind than dancing and silly
  exercises. He might not have said it in so many words, being quite content to
  leave a few things to the imagination.'</p>

  <p>'I won't attempt to explain,' replied the man with offended dignity. 'I
  fear it would be quite useless.' Here he paused and turned to two companions.
  'If you two,' he resumed, 'will be good enough to drag that body up from the
  grass we will bring it along with us.'</p>

  <p>'Keep your hands off of me,' cried Peter. 'If I must get up I'll do so
  under my own steam.'</p>

  <p>Painfully Peter rose from the grass and stood huddled up beside Josephine,
  his eyes ruefully fixed on his feet. A realization of the ordered madness of
  life was growing in his mind. He had started this naked business himself by
  dashing unclad down his own stairs in pursuit of a siphon-squirting
  pickpocket. Destiny, seeing in him a willing subject, had since that
  unconsidered moment done with him as it pleased. What, exactly, would Aunt
  Sophie or Sanders do under similar conditions? It stultified his imagination
  to think of them standing naked on a lawn in the presence of a group of
  equally naked strangers. How was Yolanda taking it? Not at all well, he felt
  sure. Not nearly so well as Josephine, but then the latter was of different
  clay&mdash;much coarser and nicer.</p>

  <p>The naked people gathered companionably round him&mdash;too companionably
  for Peter's comfort. In spite of his morning's introduction to the flesh he
  still shrank from promiscuous contact with it, still objected to being bumped
  and jostled by naked bodies. Such alarming experiences were occurring with
  increasing frequency as the party approached the long white house. Deep
  verandas flared from its sides upon the cool green of the lawn &mdash;deep
  verandas with well-tailored awnings picked out in stripes of white and
  orange.</p>

  <p>'Not unlike your drawers,' observed Josephine, pointing to the
  awnings.</p>

  <p>'Wish I had a pair right now,' was Peter's wistful answer. 'They would
  give me a slight shade of moral ascendency at least.'</p>

  <p>'If you can't maintain your morals naked,' a tall, scholarly individual
  cut in, 'you will lose them entirely when dressed,'</p>

  <p>'That,' said Peter, 'would disturb me very little. I don't care how many
  morals I lose so long as I retrieve my clothes.'</p>

  <p>'Not an edifying attitude,' replied the man. 'Why don't you stand erect
  like the rest of us? Why not throw out your chest and shoulders? You walk
  like a man with knots in his bowels.'</p>

  <p>'What!' Peter almost screamed, recoiling from the speaker's side. 'A man
  with knots in his what? No. Don't speak. I'd rather you wouldn't.'</p>

  <p>'My friend finds your words even less comforting than your body,'
  Josephine informed the man. 'And so do I.'</p>

  <p>'It's disgraceful,' muttered Peter, 'the way these men and women strut
  along just as if nothing was wrong with them. They throw everything out
  &mdash;chests and all. Wherever I turn my eyes some horrid section of anatomy
  fairly leaps into view.'</p>

  <p>'But you really are walking like a camel in labor,' Josephine reminded
  him.</p>

  <p>'If I could walk with my head between my legs I'd feel all dressed up,'
  said Peter.</p>

  <p>'That sight would be even more memorable than the present one,' his red-
  headed companion replied.</p>

  <p>By this time they had reached the house, which they entered, only to find
  themselves in the presence of a fresh burst of nudity. Naked people were
  sitting, squatting, and reclining wherever Peter tried to rest his eyes from
  the sight of flesh. Had he been able to discover the Bishop bereft of
  garments he might have found some comfort there. Even an unclad Aspirin Liz
  would have provided a slight kick, but the only member of the party who was
  present was his valet-pickpocket, Little Arthur. This small individual was
  standing miserably behind a high-back chair, and Peter could not but envy the
  felon's tactical position.</p>

  <p>The room was long, low, and raftered. It was luxuriously furnished and
  decorated with quite good taste. There was nothing mad about the room, a fact
  which rather than comforting Peter increased his sense of alarm. Perhaps
  these people instead of being crazy were merely depraved. A stout bronzed
  gentleman, Peter noticed, was reading the financial section of the morning
  paper with as much absorption as if he had been fully clad. Peter could not
  understand it. At a small table a huge grey-haired lady whose seemingly
  endless expanses of flesh should have been covered by yards of black brocaded
  satin was diligently cheating her way through some involved game of
  solitaire. True to form, reflected Peter, if not to convention. Still another
  figure&mdash;a sharp-cornered gentleman dressed only in a pencil&mdash; was
  engrossed in a cross-word puzzle. He was entirely unconscious of his
  surroundings.</p>

  <p>Scattered here and there on pillows, young women were combing each other's
  hair and twisting it in odd fashions. A man wearing only a pink beret was
  making a sketch from which Peter promptly turned his eyes. Several men were
  standing in a group by a large buffet. They were engaged in drinking coffee,
  and one of them was asserting that Al Smith might still have a chance to be
  President if he would discard his brown derby. In view of the fact that the
  speaker had discarded everything himself, Peter decided he was exercising
  admirable restraint in regard to the ex-governor's wearing apparel. Peter
  would not have been at all surprised had the man stated that if Al Smith
  discarded all his clothes he could walk into the White House, the unanimous
  choice of all parties. Through a long window he could see a number of naked
  children wandering about the lawn. They did not seem elated. Some of the
  older ones, Peter thought, looked far more self-conscious than their elders.
  Evidently they had not yet been entirely claimed by the general depravity.
  This was quite natural, children being instinctively conservative like all
  other self-respecting animals.</p>

  <p>But by far the most arresting figure in the room was that of a young man
  reclining a little apart from the others on a large divan. Even in his unclad
  state there was a sense of satanic polish about this person. In his eyes
  dwelt a dangerously amused light, and his agreeable-looking mouth seemed
  capable of uttering quite acceptably the most objectionable blasphemies. Dark
  hair and dark eyes, remarkably fine, white teeth. The only suggestion of
  degeneracy about him, Peter concluded, was a duck, a large,
  self-possessed-looking bird squatting by its master, its long purple neck
  extended snake-like across the man's flanks. This duck had a pair of the most
  disconcertingly probing eyes Peter had ever seen in the head of man or beast.
  These bright beady eyes were now turned on Peter, who felt with an uneasy
  pang that they were reading him through and through and not altogether
  approving of the subject-matter. Nor was there anything degenerate in either
  the duck's manner or appearance. It was the bond of perfect understanding
  that seemingly existed between master and fowl that impressed Peter
  unpleasantly. About both of them there was something severely sinister. For
  some reason the man's naked body suggested a perfectly fitting dress suit,
  while the duck brought to mind visions of some especially discreditable form
  of witchcraft.</p>

  <p>'My name is Jones,' said the suave-looking individual on the divan in a
  detached yet decently cultivated voice. 'You are perhaps wondering, my dear
  sir, and also you, my red-headed young lady, how a person as naked as myself
  could bear such a simple name as Jones. However, as you grow to know me
  better you will understand that simplicity is the keynote of my character. My
  duck waddles through her days quite cheerfully with the name of Havelock
  Ellis. A pardonable whim of mine. Her attitude is so opposed to the Dance of
  Life.'</p>

  <p>'All this information may seem important to you,' Peter replied in the
  true Van Dyck manner, 'but to us it is ponderously superfluous. What is
  important to us is the whereabouts of our clothes and our friends.'</p>

  <p>Jones made a smooth gesture in the direction of Little Arthur, while the
  duck, slightly elevating her sleek head, looked directly at the partly
  concealed criminal as if he were one bug too many.</p>

  <p>'Is that one of your friends?' asked Jones. 'Don't hesitate to admit it if
  he is. Almost any peculiarity passes uncriticized here.'</p>

  <p>'That's just as well,' Josephine spoke up. 'Otherwise you'd be too
  busy.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' agreed the gentleman called Jones. 'We would. But to return to that
  strange, almost human object &mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Cut out yer wisecracking,' retorted Little Arthur. 'You're no better than
  a naked lounge lizard yourself.'</p>

  <p>'If as good,' replied Jones easily; then, turning once more to Peter:
  'Your other three friends seem disinclined to leave their rooms. You two, I
  understand, succeeded in visiting each other. For your sakes as well as ours
  we won't go into that. We will try not even to think about it. However, I see
  no reason why we should longer deprive ourselves of the company of your
  friends. We shall send for them.'</p>

  <p>Jones clapped his hands, and two oppressively large-looking individuals
  appeared at his summons. They were innocent of garments but not unconscious
  of their absence. At that they were more fully clad than the others, being
  decorated with light blue armbands, the uniform dress of attendants.</p>

  <p>'Drag 'em down, boys,' Jones told them briefly.</p>

  <p>The boys paddled heavily up a long flight of stairs, and presently sounds
  of vituperation were heard in the hall above.</p>

  <p>'Keep your nasty talons off me,' came the voice of Aspirin Liz. 'I've been
  naked in front of real gentlemen, I'll have you to understand, and they never
  laid a hand on me unless &mdash;' At this point in Liz's narrative there was
  a momentary pause, then she resumed: 'It's none of your filthy business. I've
  learned some mighty dirty tricks in my time, you pot-bellied bucks, and
  unless you take your hands off me I'll play them all at once.'</p>

  <p>Apparently the boys must have doubted the extent of the model's learning,
  for the next few moments were devoted to deep-throated cries of anguish and
  indignation.</p>

  <p>'I wonder what she could have done to them?' Jones mused aloud to his
  duck, who significantly lowered the lids over two yellow eyes.</p>

  <p>At this moment Aspirin Liz, shaking with coarse laughter, appeared at the
  head of the staircase. Holding with one hand to the banister, she slapped
  with the other enough thigh to make at least three of the average large
  woman, which, it must be admitted, is a stupefying amount of thigh.</p>

  <p>'For once I don't need an aspirin,' she announced mirthfully to the
  company below. 'That did me a world of good.'</p>

  <p>'May I ask what you did to my men?' Jones asked, considering the figure
  with respectful eyes.</p>

  <p>This question produced in Liz another spasm of mirth.</p>

  <p>'Better ask them,' she said at last, 'but believe me, mister, I did
  plenty. And I'll do the same to you if you lay a hand on me.'</p>

  <p>Even the imperturbable Jones appeared to be momentarily disconcerted by
  this possibility.</p>

  <p>'I shall endeavor to restrain my eager hands,' he assured her as the
  mountain of a woman moved down the stairs.</p>

  <p>'Oh, dear,' she exclaimed, catching sight of Josephine and surveying her
  with critical approval. 'What a glorious figure you have, child. Why, you
  should go naked all the time. And if it isn't Mr. Van Dyck himself all
  undressed and no place to go.'</p>

  <p>'That's just the trouble, Liz,' said Peter. 'There's no place to go
  &mdash;nowhere to turn.'</p>

  <p>'Cheer up,' Aspirin Liz replied in her hearty voice as she joined them
  before the divan. 'Look at me. I'm three times as naked as you are&mdash;
  that is, I'm showing three times as much&mdash;and I don't mind at all.'</p>

  <p>'You're fortunate,' Peter told her. 'The relatively small amount I am
  showing bothers me a lot.'</p>

  <p>'That's because you never posed in the nude,' Liz assured him. 'You'll
  quickly get used to all this. It doesn't matter at all. And who may this
  naked reptile be? Did he send those heels after me?'</p>

  <p>'I realize my mistake too late,' murmured Jones. 'I'm sorry, madam.'</p>

  <p>'It's too late for them,' Liz retorted. 'They'll never be the same.'</p>

  <p>Looking as if Liz had spoken nothing but the truth, the two attendants
  weakly appeared on the stairs and stood looking down with pain-ravaged eyes
  upon the room below. The two men were in turn subjected to the interested
  scrutiny of many pairs of eyes intent on ascertaining the full extent of the
  calamity that had befallen them.</p>

  <p>'The lady is locked in her room,' said one of the men in a hoarse voice,
  'and we're too weak at present to drag her out, Mr. Jones. The other party
  who calls himself a bishop says he won't come down unless we give him back
  his drawers.'</p>

  <p>A lean, sun-tanned person bearing the head of a Greek philosopher now
  spoke.</p>

  <p>'If the gentleman is a bishop,' he observed in a deep musical voice, 'I
  think he should be allowed his drawers if only out of respect for his
  cloth.'</p>

  <p>'It does seem as if the situation justifies a slight deviation from our
  usual custom,' Jones replied. 'We have never had a bishop with us before, and
  I say better a bishop in drawers than no bishop at all.'</p>

  <p>'Give the Bishop back his drawers,' several voices readily responded. 'We
  want to see him.'</p>

  <p>'It seems agreed,' continued Jones, 'that the Bishop should retain his
  drawers. Very well, boys. Give him back his drawers and leave the lady alone
  until you feel a little stronger. Sorry about that other business. Women have
  rather&mdash;er&mdash;let us say, painfully primitive methods of
  retaliation.'</p>

  <p>A short time thereafter the Bishop, clothed in jaegers and righteous
  wrath, stood at the head of the stairs and like Moses from the mountain
  looked scornfully down on his naked audience.</p>

  <p>'Although they are only drawers,' Mr. Jones observed coolly, 'there seems
  to be no end to them.'</p>

  <p>'My dear Bishop,' exclaimed a lady volubly, 'what a remarkable pair of
  drawers you are wearing. Tell me. Don't they tickle?'</p>

  <p>'Probably the Bishop is thick-skinned,' put in Jones, thoughtfully
  scratching his duck's head. 'Bishops usually get that way.'</p>

  <p>'There is nearly enough material in these drawers,' drawled a voice, 'to
  make all of us in this room feel almost overdressed.'</p>

  <p>'There's not enough material in all the world to make me feel
  overdressed,' said Peter. 'As silly-looking as these drawers may be, I long
  to have them on.'</p>

  <p>'If I ever found you in drawers like these,' Josephine declared, 'there'd
  be no room for you in my life.'</p>

  <p>'I'm not usually found in my drawers,' replied Peter.</p>

  <p>'No,' Jo admitted with confounding simplicity. 'I never found you in a
  pair except once in the office.'</p>

  <p>'Don't let them kid you, Bishop,' Aspirin Liz called encouragingly. 'I've
  seen more peculiar-looking drawers than these in my day.'</p>

  <p>'Thank you, madam,' said the Bishop icily.</p>

  <p>'It must have been a mirthful day,' the philosophical gentleman
  observed.</p>

  <p>'There ain't a thing funny about them drawers,' Little Arthur suddenly and
  sincerely proclaimed from behind his chair. 'If any one gave me my choice of
  drawers, I'd pick a pair exactly like them&mdash;only lots smaller!'</p>

  <p>'Of course,' murmured Mr. Jones politely. 'The mere sight of them makes me
  feel like panting.'</p>

  <p>Bishop Waller cleared his throat and raised an admonitory hand. It was a
  gesture that had silenced many a godless congregation before as it now
  silenced this one spread out nakedly at his feet.</p>

  <p>'It is a sad commentary indeed,' he said in a voice vibrant with emotion,
  'on your good taste as well as moral character that of you all only a
  recently converted criminal has sufficient discernment to recognize an honest
  pair of drawers when he sees one.'</p>

  <p>'What did I tell yer?' put in Little Arthur complacently.' You said it,
  Bishop. Them are good, honest drawers, yer reverence.'</p>

  <p>'Even better than that, Little Arthur,' amended Bishop Waller, his voice
  rich with pride and approval. 'They are quality drawers, my man. No finer
  jaegers made.'</p>

  <p>'And certainly no funnier,' a brazen voice put in.</p>

  <p>'Don't listen to them, yer honor&mdash;I mean yer reverence,' the small
  crook continued heavily on the side of righteousness. 'They ain't got a pair
  of drawers between 'em. Why, there ain't even a blessed pocket in the whole
  horrid outfit.'</p>

  <p>'Ah!' exclaimed the Bishop, beaming brightly upon his disreputable little
  convert. 'No pockets at all. What a relief that must be for you, my fine
  fellow. No pockets at all&mdash;a blessing in disguise.'</p>

  <p>'This lot don't even trouble to disguise,' Little Arthur muttered as his
  glance drifted disgustedly about the room.</p>

  <p>'Nevertheless,' went on the good Bishop, 'God moves in a mysterious way
  His wonders to perform.'</p>

  <p>Little Arthur looked a trifle shocked. He hated to think of God as having
  had anything to do with this stark naked household.</p>

  <p>'Perhaps,' he agreed rather gloomily. 'He's certainly made it impossible
  for me to perform any of my wonders. Yards and yards of naked flesh where
  pockets ought to be. What a place for a dip!'</p>

  <p>'An ex-dip, Little Arthur,' heartily replied the Bishop. 'Never forget
  that, my fine fellow. An ex-dip.'</p>

  <p>At this point in the conversation Mr. Jones rose gracefully from the divan
  and, carrying Havelock Ellis carelessly under one arm, advanced to the foot
  of the stairs, where he stood looking courteously up at the Bishop, who in
  turn had descended a few steps.</p>

  <p>'Bishop Waller,' said Mr. Jones in a voice of the most convincing
  sincerity, 'believe me, sir, we consider ourselves greatly honored to add one
  of your exalted station to our little group.'</p>

  <p>'Your naked rout,' the Bishop corrected. 'I refuse to be added to it.'</p>

  <p>'I hope you will later revise your judgment,' said Mr. Jones. 'And I trust
  you will also believe me when I say that it was not our intention to imply
  that your drawers were not strictly honest.'</p>

  <p>'Of course they're honest,' exploded the Bishop. 'But why waste time
  discussing my drawers when you are not wearing so much as a glove?'</p>

  <p>'Quite,' continued the smooth nude known as Jones. 'Naturally your drawers
  would be unusually honest. As you say, there is really no need to discuss
  them.'</p>

  <p>'I don't hold with you there,' broke in the man with the philosopher's
  head. 'To advance as a premise that, because a man is honest himself, the
  drawers he is wearing are equally honest, is entirely false and indefensible.
  In actual fact the wearer of the drawers may have a character of the highest
  integrity, whereas the drawers themselves may be utterly vile.'</p>

  <p>'I beg your pardon,' expostulated the Bishop.</p>

  <p>'By that I mean, my dear sir,' the philosopher continued, 'the drawers may
  be the product of non-union labor, of intolerable factory conditions, of
  unfair price competition, sweat-shop methods, horrid industrial slavery
  &mdash;who knows? There are more ways of making drawers dishonest than
  one.'</p>

  <p>'There's only one really diverting way,' Josephine vouchsafed.</p>

  <p>Aspirin Liz looked at the girl for a moment, then shattered the
  uncomfortable silence with her laughter. Peter sank down on the divan the
  impeccable Jones had abandoned and covered his face with his hands. He was
  too much of a coward to show in public his appreciation of Jo's unconscious
  revelation. The duck was looking at Aspirin Liz with glassily staring eyes.
  As accustomed as the bird was to flesh, she found it objectionable to
  contemplate so much of it in one body, one huge, swaying, cascading
  figure.</p>

  <p>'That last remark may be stricken from the records,' Mr. Jones resumed
  imperturbably, 'if not from our minds. Let me go on to state, Bishop Waller,
  that the subject of your drawers would not have been brought up at all had it
  not been for our realization that to ignore totally a manifestation so
  peculiar&mdash;perhaps unique would be a better word&mdash;would have been so
  unnatural a suppression of emotion as to become in itself noticeable. You
  yourself, sir, might have experienced a sense of having been cheated, and
  that would have been too bad. Will you join our little gathering?'</p>

  <p>Bishop Waller, not at all sure in what spirit to accept the invitation of
  the polished speaker, was about to comply rather than to stand isolated any
  longer on the stairs, when further independent action was taken out of his
  hands.</p>

  <p>The wild cry of a desperate woman suddenly rang through the house.
  Turning, he was electrified to see Yolanda Wilmont, in a disheveled
  condition, appear waveringly at the head of the stairs hardly a foot in
  advance of an extremely active and naked man. After this the good Bishop saw
  nothing save a swiftly revolving universe composed entirely of stairs and
  contorted members of the human body. He was brought back to an unpleasant
  awareness of his surroundings by a sensation of insecurity round his
  waistline and a violent tugging at the back. Havelock Ellis, the duck,
  excited beyond endurance by the turmoil of the triple descent, had launched
  herself into action which centered itself on the rear part of the excellent
  Bishop's jaegers. Also, in the course of his swift passage down the stairs
  the Bishop had sustained the loss of his most invaluable button. Unable to
  rise for fear of losing his only protection, yet disinclined to remain
  prostrated and endure the envenomed assaults of the duck, Bishop Waller found
  himself in the unique position of one being torn on the horns of a dilemma
  about midway between Scylla and Charybdis. It is a position that even a
  bishop can scarcely face with an overabundance of fortitude. Bishop Waller
  feared that his supply was being rapidly exhausted.</p>

  <p>'Will some one give me a safety pin,' he asked in a weak voice, 'and at
  the same time remove this infuriated duck?'</p>

  <p>'Why, Havelock Ellis is actually pecking at the Bishop,' a voice
  exclaimed.</p>

  <p>'Both actually and viciously,' gasped the Bishop. 'And in an exceedingly
  mortifying spot, let me assure you.'</p>

  <p>'There could be worse,' the philosopher observed.</p>

  <p>'Let's not become involved in a long academic discussion as to what part
  of one's body is the most mortifying to have pecked by a duck,' protested the
  Bishop, becoming slightly involved himself. 'Suffice it to say that the spot
  this duck is at present pecking with the utmost determination is both
  mortifying and painful enough to convince even the most skeptical observer
  that something should be done about it. And,' added the Bishop, 'done without
  delay.'</p>

  <p>'You have convinced me,' said the philosopher.</p>

  <p>'Thank God for that,' murmured the Bishop. 'And the pin? The pin is most
  essential.'</p>

  <p>Now, to find a safety pin in a nudist colony is a task that would baffle
  the best minds of Scotland Yard. So hopeless was it that no one present made
  any attempt to look for one. Instead, Peter removed what remained of the
  bandage from his wounded arm and passed it to the red-headed girl who in turn
  conveyed it to the Bishop.</p>

  <p>'Thanks, my dear,' said the Bishop, eagerly snatching, the bandage from
  her hand. 'God will forgive you much for this.'</p>

  <p>'There will still remain plenty to be forgiven,' said Jo, with a pretty
  show of humility.</p>

  <p>'No doubt,' replied the Bishop, securing his jaegers with the bandage. 'We
  will deal with that later if someone will collect this bird whose egg was
  indubitably hatched in hell.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Jones thereupon collected the squawking Havelock Ellis and at the same
  time assisted the Bishop to stagger to his feet.</p>

  <p>'There are holes in the back, perhaps?' the Bishop delicately suggested in
  a low voice.</p>

  <p>Mr. Jones, cocking his head at an angle, took a quick survey of the recent
  scene of action.</p>

  <p>'No holes,' he murmured to the Bishop.</p>

  <p>'I find that difficult to believe,' said the reverend gentleman. 'There
  would have been soon&mdash;a great many, I feel assured. These jaegers, my
  dear Mr. Jones, are but recently purchased.'</p>

  <p>'They are exquisite,' replied Mr. Jones.</p>

  <p>Yolanda furiously confronted the speaker. She had been too long
  neglected.</p>

  <p>'Does it matter to you if I'm assaulted beneath your own roof?' she
  demanded.</p>

  <p>'Not at all, my dear lady,' Mr. Jones replied with admirable urbanity,
  considering the nature of the question. Make yourself entirely at home.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap16"
     name="chap16">16. THE ADVANTAGES OF NUDITY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">'Sir!' cried Yolanda. 'Are you trying to insult me?'</p>

  <p>'Far from it,' replied Mr. Jones, striving to bring his mind to grapple
  with the situation. 'So many things are going on. Too many things. Aren't you
  the young woman who wanted to be assaulted?'</p>

  <p>'Certainly not,' retorted Yolanda. 'This is too much. I was nearly
  assaulted.'</p>

  <p>'And some one interrupted you,' exclaimed Jones, as if suddenly seeing a
  light. 'How extremely trying! Who was the boorish party?'</p>

  <p>'That man!' cried Yolanda, pointing to an excited-looking gentleman now
  being firmly held in check by two attendants.</p>

  <p>Mr. Jones looked quickly at the man, smiled ever so faintly, then elevated
  his eyes.</p>

  <p>'No,' he said. 'You misunderstand. I mean the, interrupter.'</p>

  <p>'Heavens!' exclaimed Yolanda. 'Have you taken leave of your senses? There
  was nothing to interrupt.'</p>

  <p>'But my dear young lady,' protested Mr. Jones rather wearily, 'I thought
  you said "nearly"?'</p>

  <p>'Listen,' explained Yolanda, her own voice taking on a note of weariness.
  'That naked creature&mdash;that chattering baboon&mdash;climbed through my
  window and attempted to attack me. I fled down here. That's all there was to
  it."</p>

  <p>'Not much, I'll admit,' murmured Mr. Jones. 'Scarcely anything at all.' He
  paused, then looked startled. 'Is it possible,' he asked, 'that you did not
  want to be assaulted?'</p>

  <p>'Of course I didn't,' replied Yolanda, too frustrated to be offended.</p>

  <p>'Then why are you dressed?' asked Jones, elevating his upturned palms.
  'Don't you realize that the presence of clothes here is an open invitation to
  assault?'</p>

  <p>'Do you mean that to protect her honor a woman here must first abandon her
  modesty?' the girl inquired bitterly.</p>

  <p>'From your point of view,' replied Jones, 'you have stated the case
  concisely. Even those extraordinary garments the Bishop has on would make him
  subject to assault were it not for his high calling. Of course, in the case
  of the Bishop the assaultress would have to be a woman of great
  determination.'</p>

  <p>'I don't understand it at all,' Yolanda uttered helplessly.</p>

  <p>'Then let me explain,' said Jones, leading her to the divan where they
  seated themselves beside Peter.</p>

  <p>'Hello, Yolanda,' muttered that individual huskily.</p>

  <p>'Don't speak to me,' snapped Yolanda, 'you naked little nitwit. Should be
  ashamed of yourself.'</p>

  <p>'He's not subject to assault like you,' retorted Jo, sitting down on a
  pillow at Peter's feet and resting her red head against one of his shrinking
  legs.</p>

  <p>'I'm not so sure of that with you around,' replied Yolanda.</p>

  <p>'Well, just to add to your happiness,' Jo answered, 'I'm not so sure of it
  myself.'</p>

  <p>'Ladies,' Mr. Jones interrupted. 'Please let me explain.'</p>

  <p>'Go on, Mr. Bones,' said Josephine. 'That's about all you are&mdash;Mr.
  Skin and Bones.'</p>

  <p>Jones looked at her for a moment with pensively elevated eyebrows, then
  cleared his throat as if to rid himself of some disturbing impression.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Jones,' asked Peter, 'can't you do a little something about this arm?
  It's had a hard morning considering it's been shot full of holes, or
  practically.'</p>

  <p>'Certainly, Mr. Van Dyck,' replied Mr. Jones in great concern. 'Call Dr.
  Wolf,' he cried.</p>

  <p>'Wolfie! Wolfie! Wolfie!' sang out a chorus of voices, and presently the
  naked physician, looking strangely out of place what with his professional
  air and incongruous little black bag, appeared, and with the help of a pretty
  assistant did things to Peter's arm.</p>

  <p>'Well, you see,' began Mr. Jones at length, 'this little endeavor of ours,
  this small gathering of nudes, so to speak, is the result of too much
  reading, although the germ of the idea sprang from an age when books were not
  even printed.'</p>

  <p>'I can well understand that,' rumbled Bishop Waller. 'The history of the
  world is littered with examples of the most reprehensible attempts to imitate
  the more shady side of the Garden of Eden.'</p>

  <p>'No doubt,' continued Jones smoothly. 'All planets have had their pasts
  &mdash;their giddy moments in time. Yet, my dear Bishop, had it not been for
  such moments this world would not he populated to-day.'</p>

  <p>'Is it the aim of this small gathering of nudes, as you put it, to add to
  the world's population?' Peter inquired.</p>

  <p>'Not its chief aim,' replied Mr. Jones. 'We would rather raise the
  standard, but of course we haven't got going in earnest yet. We have only
  been established a short time.'</p>

  <p>'For a short time you've done pretty well,' interposed Little Arthur with
  a slight sniff. 'There ain't any more left to take off unless we skin
  ourselves alive.'</p>

  <p>'Jean Jacques Rousseau, Havelock Ellis, Craft Ebbing, and even that
  indefatigable humanitarian, Mr. H. G. Wells, not to mention innumerable other
  great thinkers,' resumed Mr. Jones, ignoring Little Arthur's interruption,
  'have all at one time or another been preoccupied with the idea of
  nudity.'</p>

  <p>'If them guys you mentioned spent their time thinking about naked bodies,'
  Little Arthur declared, 'they weren't great thinkers at all. Just plain
  nasty.'</p>

  <p>'It was not their desire, Little Arthur,' Jones explained patiently, 'to
  think about nude bodies. Nude bodies meant nothing to them. They &mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Yeah,' scoffed Little Arthur. 'They must of been old hands at it&mdash;
  all worn out. Why, I'm just as great as they are. Don't even want to see nude
  bodies, much less think of 'em.'</p>

  <p>'Sex is entirely forgotten here,' said Mr. Jones with crushing
  simplicity.</p>

  <p>'With all the reminders on every hand,' observed Josephine, 'you must have
  exceptionally short memories.'</p>

  <p>'Sure,' agreed Little Arthur. 'Ain't we supposed ter use our eyes?'</p>

  <p>'If you use no more than your eyes,' replied Mr. Jones with a significant
  look at the little crook, 'everything will be quite all right.'</p>

  <p>'Ain't we supposed ter be even human?' protested Little Arthur.</p>

  <p>'We are supposed to be,' said Mr. Jones coldly, 'but I find it hard to
  believe that you are.'</p>

  <p>'If you ask me,' put in Aspirin Liz, 'when I look at some of the samples
  hanging about here I don't want to remember sex at all. If I had my figure
  back for five minutes there'd be a riot in this room.'</p>

  <p>'It ain't patriotic,' the little thief asserted. 'A lot of American
  citizens going around without even a pair of drawers.'</p>

  <p>'Look at it philosophically, my man,' said the gentleman with the fine
  head.</p>

  <p>'Look at what that way?' asked Arthur.</p>

  <p>'At everything,' replied the philosopher. 'Everything.'</p>

  <p>'Well, if you can extract one grain of constructive philosophy from some
  of the things I'm looking at,' declared Josephine as she glanced round the
  room, 'you've got a more godlike mind than I.'</p>

  <p>'I have,' said the philosopher.</p>

  <p>'Please, mister, give me a pair of drawers?' the snatch-purse pleaded.</p>

  <p>'If a bishop rates only a pair of drawers in this outfit,' Mr. Jones
  replied, 'where do you think you get off, you small unpleasant knave? Did you
  bathe this morning?'</p>

  <p>What could be seen of Little Arthur was turning delicately pink. The small
  unpleasant figure was evidently engaged in blushing all over itself.</p>

  <p>'What a question ter ask,' muttered the unhappy man.</p>

  <p>'It was unnecessary, I'll admit,' replied Mr. Jones. 'Will a couple of you
  girls take him away and bathe him?'</p>

  <p>Little Arthur's jaw fell, then disappeared with the rest of his head
  behind the chair. Sounds of merriment were heard in the room as several girls
  and a male attendant dragged the struggling figure up the stairs. Little
  Arthur did not contribute to these sounds. He was all for having the law on
  the sleek head of Mr. Jones. He went even so far as to assert that he would
  never rest easy until the police had raided the place. At last his threats
  became incoherent, and when finally seen he was babbling like an idiot and
  endeavoring to prostrate himself on the floor of the upper landing.</p>

  <p>'Perhaps we may be able to talk now,' remarked Mr.Jones with one of his
  faint smiles when Little Arthur and his fair bath attendants had disappeared.
  'You see, Yolanda&mdash;I trust you will forgive me, but I cannot resist
  using such a pretty name&mdash;you see, my very charming young lady, I
  misunderstood the situation altogether. I assumed because you were dressed
  you naturally had certain ideas in your mind. So many women have, you
  know.'</p>

  <p>'No,' replied Yolanda. 'I don't know. I don't care to hear.'</p>

  <p>'But you must,' persisted Mr. Jones. 'It will do you a world of good.'
  Here he held out the duck to an attendant standing near by. 'Will you kindly
  take Havelock upstairs and toss him in with the person being bathed?' he said
  to the man. 'The poor bird dearly loves a little romp in the tub.'</p>

  <p>A short time after the departure of the duck, screams of anguish drifted
  down to those in the room below. From the sounds Little Arthur was making,
  Havelock Ellis was having more than a romp in the tub. He was having a
  regular tussle.</p>

  <p>'A lovable duck,' observed Mr. Jones with a smile of rare sweetness. 'So
  fond of snapping about in a tub catching things under water.'</p>

  <p>With an expression of horror Peter gazed at the speaker, then looked down
  into Josephine's amused eyes.</p>

  <p>'Oh,' said Peter in a low voice. 'Oh, for goodness sake! Poor, poor Little
  Arthur.'</p>

  <p>'Don't worry about that crook,' she said reassuringly. 'He's picked enough
  pockets in his time to be picked on a little himself.'</p>

  <p>'The fact is,' Jones broke in, fixing the group with his enigmatic black
  eyes, 'in this colony nudity leaves us emotionally cold, or should leave us
  cold. Of course there are occasional localized rises in temperature which are
  due, we hope, entirely to lack of training. On the other hand, the average
  well-built woman&mdash;and you are far, far above the average, my dear
  Yolanda&mdash;the average well-built woman, dressed as women dress to-day,
  which is a little more than demi-nude, arouse our gentlemen nudes to
  outbursts of simply amazing ferocity. To look at them now you would be
  surprised.'</p>

  <p>'I would not,' Yolanda told him. 'You forget I was the subject of such an
  outburst already.'</p>

  <p>'To be sure,' exclaimed Mr. Jones. 'It was fortunate indeed you managed to
  save as much of your honor as you did.'</p>

  <p>'First time I ever knew a woman's honor could be partially saved,'
  Josephine remarked. 'I always thought it was something you either lost
  outright or just couldn't give away.'</p>

  <p>'Not only are your thoughts painfully crude,' Jones replied, 'but also
  crudely expressed.'</p>

  <p>'Listen here, naked,' Aspirin Liz asked from a pile of pillows upon which
  she was ponderously wallowing. 'What's so wrong about a man and a woman
  having a little fun when they feel like it?'</p>

  <p>'Nothing at all,' Jones hastily replied. 'I think it's both commendable
  and diverting&mdash;essential, in fact. What we do object to here is the
  undue emphasis placed on sex. Sex preoccupation day in and day out. Sex
  consciousness morning, noon, and night. What is the dress of woman but an
  invitation and a challenge to the eye, to the senses? Do women dress to keep
  warm? Certainly not. Do they dress to cover their nakedness? Certainly not.
  They dress to reveal it, to suggest it, to enhance it. A pair of high-
  stockinged legs against a background of frills is a far more provocative
  sight, with a few exceptions, than the same pair of legs nude, hairy, and
  garter-stripped.'</p>

  <p>'Say, young feller,' Liz put in, a shade of respect in her voice. 'You've
  been round a lot.'</p>

  <p>'And I hope to go round a lot more,' he assured her, 'but I have no
  intention of forgetting the fact that there are ever so many other things to
  do. Nor do I wish to be constantly reminded by fresh relays of sex-dominated
  women that there is only one inevitable end to social mingling of the
  sexes.'</p>

  <p>'A guy like you doesn't have to be reminded,' Aspirin Liz declared.</p>

  <p>'That's just the point,' agreed Mr. Jones. 'I need no reminders of sex to
  be brought to my attention. Very few men do. What we do need is something to
  get our minds on other things.'</p>

  <p>'How about drink?' asked Jo.</p>

  <p>'Drink is a stimulant,' Jones replied. 'and would therefore defeat its
  purpose.'</p>

  <p>'I never expected to hear a naked man preaching to a naked audience words
  laden with so much practical morality,' observed Bishop Waller. 'I almost
  feel like taking off my drawers and leading you all in prayer.'</p>

  <p>'Let me ask you a question, sir,' continued Jones, turning directly to
  Peter. 'What is the good of a woman spending hours and hours in scenting,
  anointing, and dressing her body only to undress it again in from three to
  five minutes&mdash;in some cases even less&mdash;for the sake of some damn
  fool man who probably never knew what she had on to begin with and who would
  have reacted the same no matter what she was wearing?'</p>

  <p>'You said from three to five minutes,' Peter observed musingly. 'In some
  cases less.'</p>

  <p>'Exactly,' said Mr. Jones. 'Sometimes even less.'</p>

  <p>'Have you gone round timing women at it?' asked Peter.</p>

  <p>'That is neither here nor there,' Mr. Jones replied impatiently. 'I make
  five minutes the maximum because I don't think the average man will wait any
  longer than that.'</p>

  <p>'I know,' agreed Josephine wisely. 'Just great big, grown-up babies. After
  five minutes I suppose they begin to cry.'</p>

  <p>'Should we continue this conversation?' interposed the Bishop. 'Should
  we?'</p>

  <p>'Why not?' replied Josephine innocently. 'Didn't you say he was speaking
  words of practical morality, Bishop Waller?'</p>

  <p>'His words were safe,' said the Bishop, 'but I very much suspect
  yours.'</p>

  <p>'We order things better here,' Mr. Jones resumed. 'By taking off our
  clothes we forget about our bodies.'</p>

  <p>'What's the fun in that?' asked Jo.</p>

  <p>'I'm afraid you'd find it difficult to understand,' Mr. Jones replied, and
  this time his smile was a trifle too pleasant.</p>

  <p>'I don't want to understand,' said Jo. 'Frankly, I'm very fond of my body.
  So much so, in fact, that if I did not have it I think I'd lose my mind.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Jones restrained the impulse to inform the red-headed girl that her
  total disappearance would not be so great a loss that he personally would be
  unable to survive it. Perhaps, upon considering her delicate yet not
  reluctant proportions, as he did now, he decided he would not be speaking the
  exact truth. Few men could look on Jo and wish her absent.</p>

  <p>'Here,' he continued, 'we endeavor to retain both mind and body. However,
  we are making an attempt to give the mind for once an even break. In the old
  days when people went naked they were too busy either fighting things or each
  other to notice the absence of clothes. To-day, when so many things are done
  for us, we have much more opportunity to take advantage of any sudden burst
  of nudity. Therefore, it is my belief that any attempt to introduce sustained
  nudity is as impractical as it is undesirable. In view of this we have made
  arrangements to enjoy at our little colony certain seasons and occasions. We
  have thought up names for them. They are to be called Seasons of
  Forgetfulness and Civilized Occasions.'</p>

  <p>'Go on,' murmured Jo. 'You interest me strangely, Mr. Skin and Bones.'</p>

  <p>Now, strange as it may seem, Yolanda, upon hearing Josephine's remark,
  allowed her eves to pass swiftly over the tanned, youthful figure of Mr.
  Jones. Instinctively she felt inclined to take issue with the girl. There was
  something about Mr. Jones that pleased and attracted Yolanda almost too much.
  Perhaps it was because she was fully clad, or it might possibly have been
  because he was not clad at all. Whatever it was, the fact remained that
  Yolanda felt herself slipping, and for the first time in her life admitted to
  herself a sensation of healthy depravity.</p>

  <p>'During Seasons of Forgetfulness,' Mr. Jones explained, 'it is our
  intention to get all dressed up and to conduct ourselves as men and women
  ordinarily do now under this régime of prohibition. In other words, we intend
  to drink bad gin in garish and cleverly faked up surroundings. Women will
  dress as provocatively as possible and men will pursue them without stay or
  hindrance. The cost of destroyed garments during these seasons will be
  extremely high. Husbands and wives will fight with each other in the old
  traditional way and promptly console themselves with husbands and wives to
  which they are not entitled. And because I have noticed that at all rough
  parties pulled by nice people there is always a certain percentage of women
  who are not thoroughly happy unless they have attracted the eyes of all men
  by an exhibition of orgiastic dancing, a stage will be provided for this
  special purpose. Ladies suffering from exhibitionism which cannot be
  satisfied by one man alone can use this stage to their hearts' content and be
  sure of an appreciative audience. During these little seasons, which should
  be limited to a week's duration, we will all of us become highly civilized
  human beings such as exist in the world to-day. There will be very little
  reading except from delightfully illustrated pornographic books, no thinking
  whatsoever, no really constructive or artistic effort, no loyalties nor
  friendship. In place there will be a tremendous amount of smart talk and
  wise-cracking in the accepted manner. Ladies will display their wit by saying
  brilliant things at the expense of each other and everything else. Men and
  women will make screamingly funny speeches and tell each other all about the
  plays they were unable to sit through. In short, every little cankerous
  growth will have its day, and when it's all over and the attendants, somewhat
  wearied themselves, have dragged the exhausted bodies away, we hope to be
  able to settle down to a period of calm, uneventful living in which the mind
  will have a chance as well as the body. When, after careful observation, I
  discover that the majority of colonists are becoming a trifle nervous and
  repressed from this sort of existence, we will declare another Season of
  Forgetfulness and return to civilized conditions.'</p>

  <p>'You're a bit of a wisecracker yourself, Mr. Jones,' Josephine remarked
  after a thoughtful silence, 'but I don't mind saying I'd feel a lot more at
  home if we had arrived during one of your Seasons of Forgetfulness than
  during this present one of embarrassment.'</p>

  <p>'You don't appear to be so desperately embarrassed,' Mr. Jones told
  her.</p>

  <p>'No,' the girl answered. 'I get used to things quickly.'</p>

  <p>'As bad as this is,' said Bishop Waller, 'I am heartily thankful we
  escaped arriving at a period such as has been described.'</p>

  <p>'I am inclined to believe,' remarked Mr. Jones, looking with significant
  appreciation at Yolanda, 'that a Period of Forgetfulness is rapidly
  approaching, or perhaps it may be merely a Civilized Occasion.'</p>

  <p>'And what is a Civilized Occasion?' Yolanda asked under her breath.</p>

  <p>'The same thing on a smaller scale,' Mr. Jones confided to her. 'It's more
  like an individual tour and is usually confined to two persons who find
  themselves unable to stand the strain of continuing under present conditions.
  You see, we have taken really every eventuality into consideration.'</p>

  <p>'I think,' Yolanda murmured, the lids dropping demurely over her beautiful
  eyes, 'that I might be able to understand a Civilized Occasion. The present
  one is extremely trying and I do so hate publicity.'</p>

  <p>'Arrangements can be easily made,' replied Mr. Jones, in a low and
  hypocritical voice. 'It is one of my duties to conduct ladies through such
  occasions when their companions do not feel up to it.'</p>

  <p>What Yolanda would have said to this will never be known, for at this
  moment Little Arthur, pursued by a duck and a flock of women, leaped nimbly
  down the stairs.</p>

  <p>'What do yer mean,' he cried out to Mr. Jones, 'by having your nasty duck
  chucked inter my tub? It fair gave me gooseflesh, it did!'</p>

  <p>'How can a duck give one gooseflesh?' the philosopher wanted to be
  told.</p>

  <p>'Why did God give you brains?' Little Arthur tossed back.</p>

  <p>'Certainly not to credit the ridiculous assertion that a duck can give one
  gooseflesh,' the philosopher replied impassively.</p>

  <p>'What's the difference between 'em?' demanded Arthur.</p>

  <p>'I don't know,' admitted the philosopher. 'I have never compared the flesh
  of duck with that of goose. They don't taste very much alike.'</p>

  <p>'Well, drag the feathers offa this duck and take a taste of it,' Little
  Arthur retorted. 'Gnaw its black heart out, for all I care. What's it doing
  with feathers on, anyway? Ain't we all naked?'</p>

  <p>'Little Arthur,' put in Jones in his quiet way, 'I urge you not to suggest
  liberties being taken with my duck.'</p>

  <p>'The old hooker took liberties with me,' the little crook protested. 'Just
  look at all them welts.'</p>

  <p>Here Little Arthur turned and dramatically displayed the place of the
  welts. Even Mr. Jones was moved.</p>

  <p>'There are some exhibitions,' he observed, 'that are difficult to bear
  with even in a nudist colony. Take your welts away, Little Arthur. You are
  dripping all over the place.'</p>

  <p>Little Arthur, looking as if knots had been tied in all parts of his body,
  moved painfully towards the door and God's open spaces.</p>

  <p>'Talk about being put on the spot,' he muttered. 'Why, a machine gun's a
  mere massage compared ter the bill of that duck.'</p>

     name="chap17">17. REACTIONS AND ROUTINE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Life in a newly established nudist colony is not so restful
  as one might suppose, especially when punctuated by various little
  infringements of nudist ethics such as those which it is only natural for
  ladies and gentlemen to make who have not become quite accustomed to the big
  idea. These infringements were at times sufficiently serious to cause
  nice-mannered spectators to hurry away from the scene of action. The sound of
  a great deal of unnecessary slapping was heard, usually followed by cries of
  indignation or gasps of sheer astonishment. Some men found pinching a playful
  habit very difficult to break. There was more or less unseemly giggling among
  the women. Innumerable tentatively advanced suggestions by enterprising males
  were being steadily rejected by the more conservative females. Man is an
  animal in which the most extravagant hopes die extremely hard. He is
  difficult to convince on certain points. He always tries.</p>

  <p>The little party of involuntary nudes was more or less disconcerted all of
  the time. Even after the passage of several days Bishop Waller and Little
  Arthur seemed still inclined to keep their eyes steadfastly fixed on the
  relatively innocent reaches of the sea. Peter and Josephine were much
  together&mdash;too much together. Inseparable, in fact. Mr. Jones, who was
  liberal to a fault in such matters, and especially so where new arrivals were
  concerned, was forced to ask Josephine to be a little quieter about it when
  she called on Peter at night. Peter himself objected to the way the
  red-haired girl came thumping into his room. Of all the party she seemed to
  be enjoying herself the most. There was something either innocently pagan or
  healthily unmoral in the way she accepted the situation and contrived to take
  advantage of it. Jo was outrageously forthright. She seemed to consider this
  little interlude in the drabness of her circumscribed existence as a sort of
  virgin's holiday&mdash;an escape from the conventions and inhibitions which
  to her way of thinking would never have been imposed on men and women in any
  normally constituted world. Her conception of a nudist colony and that of Mr.
  Jones were greatly at variance, for the simple reason that the colony had
  been established for the benefit of sex slaves instead of executives.
  Josephine was a past master at sex. That is, she was so frankly and honestly
  a creature of sex that its freedom of expression appeared to her as being
  neither especially wild nor wicked. To her it was merely a fact which, once
  accepted, did not require a lot of hypocritical trimmings and tortuous
  divagations to make it socially presentable. For this reason she was able to
  think of other things, which she did quite frequently. Life to Josephine was
  divertingly improper and more than a little grotesque. It was always amusing
  even at its worst moments, many of which she had experienced without too much
  self-pity during the brief period she had beautified the world.</p>

  <p>While the ladies and gentlemen of the colony were engaged in performing
  aesthetic dances on the lawn, Josephine would imitate their movements with
  contortions that caused them to pause in wonderment and disgust. Knowing she
  was already sufficiently beautiful, it was her desire to pass on to higher
  things and to make herself also funny. Women found this attitude difficult to
  understand, and the more the men were amused the less the ladies appreciated
  the object of their mirth. Mr. Jones was forced to withdraw Josephine from
  participation in the community dancing.</p>

  <p>To the children of the colony Josephine was the most acceptable adult
  nude. It was strange to hear these small naked creatures trying to persuade
  their mothers and fathers to go back to the house and put on some clothing.
  The conservative attitude of children is strongly marked in a budding nudist
  colony. Here the disastrous results of endeavoring to inculcate the youthful
  mind with a sense of decency before a knowledge of indecency has been
  acquired became accusingly apparent. For the first few days the lives of the
  little people were quite miserable. They spent much of the time in
  hiding.</p>

  <p>Josephine, however, they accepted at her flesh value. In her company they
  began to thaw out a little, to forget the shame of it all, and to take an
  interest in their naked world. And although the dances she created for them
  were far from being the seriously ludicrous affairs their elders fondly
  believed to be aesthetic, they were danced with a great deal more enjoyment
  and a lot more noise. After telling them the story of Pandora as told by Mr.
  Eustace Bright in Hawthorne's <i>Wonder Book</i> she eventually succeeded in
  reconciling the children to their own nudity if not to their parents.</p>

  <p>In short, Josephine was both busy and contented. And one of the reasons
  for this was that she was considerably in love with Peter Van Dyck and
  growing daily more confident of keeping what she had taken. That she had used
  shock-troop methods to achieve her ends did not trouble her in the least.
  Yolanda had enjoyed even better opportunities and had failed to take
  advantage of them.</p>

  <p>In the nudist colony, Yolanda had become the major exception to the rule,
  and the Bishop the minor. Mr. Jones, for reasons known only to himself, had
  allowed her to retain everything while Bishop Waller moved through his paces
  nattily attired only in his drawers. Whether Yolanda was deliberately
  inviting assault will never be known. It was a subject of open comment that
  both she and the suave leader of the colony appeared to find much in common.
  The degree or amount of commonness was also a matter of considerable
  speculation.</p>

  <p>Aspirin Liz had settled comfortably into her niche, as that lady would
  have settled in either heaven or hell, or in any way station between those
  two points. And she had found certain cronies, as ladies of the disposition
  of Liz inevitably do&mdash;cronies who played cards and talked about little
  things having to do with this and that and mostly about food and drink. In
  spite of the vast expanse of flesh she presented to the world, when one saw
  Aspirin Liz engaged in a game of cards with her friends it was difficult to
  think of her as being naked, so casually had she accepted the situation. Mr.
  Jones, who seemed fond of exceptions&mdash;stimulants being prohibited save
  during Seasons of Forgetfulness&mdash;had managed some beer for Liz and
  supplied her with a quantity of aspirin. In view of these little attentions
  and because of the absence of her corsets life seemed good to Aspirin Liz.
  She was the only woman in the colony with whom the Bishop conversed with any
  degree of comfort or feeling of security. She was essentially a home body,
  even though a naked one.</p>

  <p>Peter spent most of his time fluctuating between a sense of guilt and a
  mood of dark rebellion. Van Dyck bodies had been concealed beneath silk,
  satin, and furs for so many generations that sunlight and fresh air had
  become almost alien elements to them. He disliked exceedingly the idea of
  being peered at and scrutinized. His modesty was far less outraged than his
  personal dignity. He had soon discovered to his profound relief that he
  possessed no really decent scruples which could not be easily overcome. In
  this he was a true Van Dyck. But he did strongly object to being a naked unit
  in a seething mass of flesh&mdash;in a colony of what he stoutly maintained
  was composed of weak or simple-minded cranks. Pictures of himself in the
  paper surrounded by a flock of naked men and women kept re-appearing before
  his mental gaze. He wondered what the captions beneath these pictures would
  be. 'Head of Old New York Family Enjoying a Short but Naked Holiday With His
  Friends,' unreeled itself before his eyes. Or: 'Peter Van Dyck Abandons Silk
  Hat for Simple Life and Naked Dancing.' Or&mdash;and from this from the
  tabloids: 'Mad Van in Naked Dance.'</p>

  <p>'Pretty,' he muttered to himself. 'They'd probably strike out "dance" and
  put in "orgy."'</p>

  <p>He was especially annoyed with Mr. Jones because that gentleman would
  neither allow him his clothes nor appoint a definite date of departure. Nor
  would the naked leader permit any of the party to communicate with the outer
  world. For all Peter's office or Aunt Sophie knew, he might be in China with
  Yolanda or at the bottom of the sea. Whenever he brought up with the
  unfailing attentive Jones the subject of departure, that gentleman looked
  hurt and then asked him with disconcerting significance if he was not having
  a good time.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, had Peter been honest with himself he would have
  admitted he was having the time of his life. But he did not like Mr. Jones at
  all when the leader slapped him too low down on the back and assured him that
  he, Peter, was holding out splendidly under the circumstances and that many a
  man would envy him his good fortune. No. Such remarks were most decidedly in
  bad taste, especially when one was too alertly conscious of the thoughts
  passing through the other's mind.</p>

  <p>'The red-headed girl isn't doing any complaining,' Mr. Jones once went so
  far as to remark, looking Peter in the eye with a subdued leer. 'I should
  think you would find some comfort, not to mention cause for a little pride,
  in that. Now, from my experience with red-headed women...'</p>

  <p>Peter did not stay to listen to what he had every reason to believe would
  be a highly objectionable recital of the leader's amorous adventures with
  red-headed women. He had a red-headed woman of his own on his hands, and she
  was quite enough.</p>

  <p>Of all the members of the band of castaways Little Arthur, surprisingly
  enough, was the most popular with the nudists. He was perhaps the noblest
  nude of them all&mdash;the most unimpeachable, the most impenetrably clad in
  the armour of righteousness. Although the object of no little jest and levity
  he was nevertheless held in considerable affection by his fellow nudes. He
  was always so ready and willing to explain to them just how depraved they all
  were and how especially depraved Mr. Jones was because he would not give
  Little Arthur back either one of the pairs of drawers he had been wearing
  when lured into this sinkhole or iniquity. If a bishop was allowed a pair of
  long drawers, Little Arthur argued, a retired pickpocket should be allowed at
  the very least a pair of short ones. As a matter of fact, a naked bishop most
  likely would stand more fully clad in the eyes of God than a pickpocket in a
  fur coat. The strength of Little Arthur's claim on drawers was fully and
  freely discussed. Much sympathy was extended him, but no drawers. The small
  crook, because of his social triumph, grew to enjoy the very indignities
  against which he levelled his artless tirades. Also, for the simple reason
  that the ladies and gentlemen whose morals and manners he so severely
  criticised invariably&mdash;almost callously&mdash;agreed with him, Little
  Arthur, after a few days, actually became quite fond of them. Without a naked
  body knocking about somewhere on the horizon to become moral about, Little
  Arthur would have found his life a dull thing indeed.</p>

  <p>When the colony foregathered at the long tables in the dining-hall, it was
  a sight to make the most daring producers of Broadway Glorifications think
  several times more than twice to pause and rub their jaded eyes and wonder if
  they had ever before witnessed life in the nude. Yet nothing more exciting
  happened than a tremendous consumption of food.</p>

  <p>When Peter had first been induced to attend one of these communal meals he
  had cagily asked for a napkin, hoping to be able to cover some part of his
  body at least. His almost pleading request had been scornfully rejected.</p>

  <p>'Napkin,' sniffed the maid. 'They don't even let us girls wear aprons, the
  nasty naked things. If it wasn't for this depression...'</p>

  <p>The rest of the maid's lament was drowned in a babble of hungry
  voices.</p>

  <p>Peter, surveying the multitude, found it impossible to understand how all
  these people were able to sit thigh to thigh, rib to rib, and consume huge
  quantities of food without being convulsed by the severest pangs of
  indigestion. Seated between two blandly naked ladies, he was continually
  being forced to shrink fastidiously into himself to keep from being
  overpowered by their swaying torsos and gesticulating arms.</p>

  <p>At that first meal Peter ate very little. He had accustomed himself in
  business to seeing a number of people use their jaws, temples, eyebrows,
  necks&mdash;in fact, their entire faces&mdash;when engaged in the horrid
  business of mastication. It had been not easy, but he had brought himself
  grimly to bear with this, realizing that time was short in a business day.
  But to see a gathering of naked individuals eating not only with their faces
  but also with their bodies was too vivid a demonstration of greed for him. He
  found his fascinated eyes dwelling on various parts of these bodies&mdash; on
  necks, diaphragms and stomachs&mdash;as if they were endeavoring to ascertain
  the exact location of the last mouthful of food the person under observation
  had swallowed.</p>

  <p>The routine observed at the nudist colony was simple to the point of
  idiocy. At least it seemed so to Peter. In the morning the household was
  awakened by the tinkling of many bells which announced that every one was
  supposed to spring out of bed, rush downstairs, and dash around the lawn in
  mad pursuit of Mr. Jones, who usually, because of pressing business,
  delegated the task to the philosopher, who seemed to extract from it a
  certain amount of sardonic amusement. Going downstairs late one morning,
  Peter discovered that Mr. Jones's pressing business consisted of dashing from
  his own room to another's. Peter put the man down as a thorough-going
  hypocrite. He would have put him down as even worse had he realized that the
  room into which Mr. Jones had so eagerly disappeared was none other than
  Yolanda's. That unassailable young lady, under the direction of the leader,
  was beginning to take more and more interest in his Civilized Occasions.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, had Peter been aware of the extra service Mr. Jones was
  performing to make Yolanda a thoroughly contented guest, he, Peter, might
  have felt grateful to the diligent young leader. Realizing how the situation
  stood between himself and Josephine, it was with a sensation of profound
  uneasiness that Peter considered Yolanda and the future. This sensation alone
  would have reconciled him to the nakedness of his life had not certain little
  indications warned him that the Season of Forgetfulness was rapidly
  approaching. Peter had no intention of being one of the colony during the
  festivities of this season. He had collected enough moral turpitude already
  to last him for a lifetime. He had no desire to join in a public
  demonstration.</p>

  <p>Bishop Waller was equally determined to escape from the colony. Josephine,
  much to Peter's surprise, showed no disposition to remain. It was her
  conviction that once a good man had fallen, one never could tell where he was
  likely to bounce. She did not intend to let Peter bounce into some other
  woman's lap. He had in his composition all of the potential vices engendered
  by a clean past. It was well enough&mdash;in fact, it was a commendable
  thing&mdash;to share these vices with Peter, but it was not at all desirable
  to place them at the disposal of the temporarily dressed and drunken ladies
  of a nudist colony. Therefore Josephine had good and sufficient reasons to
  join with the Bishop in his determination to escape from the nudists no
  matter how difficult or embarrassing such an endeavor might prove to be.
  Little Arthur was of a similar disposition. So was Aspirin Liz, who in spite
  of her contentment still maintained that, of all the pleasant places in the
  world in which to drink beer, the Hoboken water-front was by far the
  pleasantest. Yolanda alone seemed a trifle vague when approached on the
  subject of escaping. And this was exceedingly strange in view of the fact
  that she was the only member of the party who had been allowed to retain her
  garments and who therefore had nothing to fear from a flight back to the
  world of covered flesh. True, she was careful enough not to give the
  impression that she was anxious to remain where she was, yet even Bishop
  Waller suspected her of being more than a little on the fence.</p>

  <p>And the exact location of the colony was also a subject of no little
  speculation among the members of the party.</p>

  <p>Mr. Jones had mentioned so many different places when questioned that even
  the most gullible person would have been forced to conclude that the man was
  a well-meaning but absent-minded liar.</p>

  <p>'I feel we're safe in figuring we're somewhere on the sea-coast of the
  North American continent,' Peter remarked to his fellow castaways.</p>

  <p>'Wherever we are,' allowed the good Bishop, 'somewhere else couldn't be so
  much worse. We must get away at all costs.'</p>

  <p>At this moment Yolanda, accompanied by Mr. Jones, strolled up to the
  group.</p>

  <p>'Setting-up exercises in five minutes,' the naked leader announced with a
  bright smile in which Peter detected a glint of vicious amusement.</p>

  <p>'I can't join in to-day,' Yolanda murmured. 'I'm too utterly weary. It
  must be the ocean.'</p>

  <p>Josephine's large brown eyes were fixed on the girl.</p>

  <p>'I'm beginning to admire you, Yolanda,' she said amicably. 'And that shows
  how bad I am.'</p>

  <p>Even Peter wondered why Yolanda did not ask Jo exactly what she meant by
  that.</p>

  <p>With a sigh Little Arthur uncoiled his thin body.</p>

  <p>'Always setting up,' he complained. 'Always exposing something or other.
  Why can't you let a guy crouch in peace by hisself?'</p>

  <p>The naked party trailed across the lawn in the direction of even more
  nakedness&mdash;a multitude of prancing nakedness singing loudly about dew
  being on its feet.</p>

  <p>'Look at 'em,' muttered Little Arthur. 'All bare and all crazy as hell in
  the head&mdash;begging your pardon, Bishop. Singing about dew and their great
  feet. Who cares, I ask you? Who cares? I'm tired of naked bodies. They hurt
  my eyes.'</p>

  <p>'Well spoken, Little Arthur,' said Bishop Waller, 'in spite of your choice
  of words. If those bodies were only black or brown, I might at least succeed
  in getting drawers on them as I have in the past. With white bodies it is
  sadly different. Once they have abandoned their drawers, they seem also to
  have abandoned their reason.'</p>

  <p>'You forget, my dear Bishop,' observed Peter, 'that drawers are a bit of a
  novelty to your dark-skinned converts, whereas no drawers are equally novel
  to these deluded people.'</p>

  <p>'No drawers aren't novel to me,' remarked Aspirin Liz. 'It's an old, old
  story.'</p>

  <p>'Well, no drawers ter me,' said Little Arthur earnestly, 'is simply
  frantic.'</p>

  <p>'Without my jaegers,' remarked the Bishop a trifle complacently, 'I fear I
  would find it difficult to turn even to God in my distress.'</p>

  <p>'I want my step-ins,' said Jo with devastating frankness, 'more because I
  like their looks than because I feel their loss.'</p>

  <p>Bishop Waller looked sadly at the red-headed girl, opened his mouth to
  speak, closed it again, then hopelessly shook his head.</p>

  <p>His God was too greatly handicapped in the presence of so much beauty
  unadorned.</p>

  <p>Peter and Jo on the sand dunes. Havelock Ellis had accompanied them for a
  little sunshine and salt air. The duck was actually trying to sleep on its
  side like a dog. It was not a pleasing sight. Nor was Havelock Ellis
  comfortable. No duck should be seen that way. She was clucking clucking bad
  duck language deep down in her throat. Peter, taking advantage of the sand,
  had dug himself in. For the moment he felt almost well dressed. At the
  water's edge the Bishop was conversing with the philosopher. The Bishop was
  dressed in his jaegers, which by now were looking sorely tried. The
  philosopher wore simply a pipe. Havelock Ellis flipped her wing disgustedly,
  sending a spray of sand across Peter's face. Peter submitted patiently. He
  had grown fond of Ellis.</p>

  <p>'It's too bad you're not married, Peter,' said the girl, kicking her legs
  up behind her, thus sending more sand in Peter's face.</p>

  <p>'Why?' asked Peter, still patient because he had also grown fond of
  Jo.</p>

  <p>'Because,' she answered, 'the situation would then be more desperate
  &mdash;more dramatic. You might even leave me with an unnamed child for which
  I would have to slave in silence while treasuring your memory deep in my
  heart.'</p>

  <p>'You're breaking mine,' Peter told her. 'I've decided to marry you even
  though such a step is entirely unnecessary.'</p>

  <p>'It would be far cheaper than keeping me,' the girl replied calmly. 'I'd
  work for you for nothing and we could spend my pay.'</p>

  <p>Peter thought this over.</p>

  <p>'It's too involved,' he said at last. 'Yet I sense something in it
  somewhere.'</p>

  <p>The Bishop strolled up with the philosopher. Both stood moodily looking
  down upon the couple in the sand. Then the philosopher turned to the
  Bishop.</p>

  <p>'You, I contend, my dear Bishop,' he stated deliberately, 'look more
  ridiculous in those weird pantaloons of yours than I do in my pipe."</p>

  <p>'But you look far more naked,' replied the Bishop. 'Even though I cut a
  sorry figure in the eyes of man and God alike, I have the comfort of knowing
  I am not childishly exposed.'</p>

  <p>'Do you consider me childish, Bishop?' the philosopher inquired.</p>

  <p>'I endeavor not to consider you at all,' replied the Bishop, 'although I
  know full well that the memory of your gaunt figure will haunt my dreams for
  years. I think it's the addition of the pipe that makes you look extra
  naked.'</p>

  <p>The philosopher smiled appreciatively.</p>

  <p>'Not a bad point, Bishop Waller,' he said. 'No doubt the pipe is an
  incongruous touch. However, I'd rather have my pipe than your drawers.'</p>

  <p>'I wouldn't relinquish these jaegers for all the pipes in the world,' the
  Bishop told him.</p>

  <p>'Don't you feel at all funny,' Peter asked the philosopher, 'being naked
  like that before everybody?'</p>

  <p>'How do you feel, my dear sir?' the tall man inquired.</p>

  <p>'Like a suddenly evicted Turkish bath,' said Peter. 'Even worse than
  that.'</p>

  <p>'And the young lady?' the philosopher pursued.</p>

  <p>'I feel great,' said Jo, 'but I still find grounds for complaint. They're
  not moral. Sorry, Bishop. I miss my nice things&mdash;silk stockings and all.
  You should know, Mr. Pipe, that all pretty women like to show their bodies,
  but most of them prefer to select their audiences. Uniform nudity does not
  appeal to our sex.'</p>

  <p>'A good point, too,' observed the philosopher. 'Even the most primitive
  members of your sex instinctively decorate their bodies.'</p>

  <p>'Also the men,' said Peter.</p>

  <p>'Come,' said the Bishop hastily. 'We must continue our stroll.'</p>

  <p>The two strange figures walked off across the dunes. Suddenly the
  philosopher turned hack.</p>

  <p>'I forgot to answer your question,' he called. 'I think this show is a lot
  of bunk, if you want to know my frank opinion. And if it wasn't for a
  disciplined and inquiring mind, I'd feel simply awful. Good-day, sir.'</p>

  <p>Peter waved a hand, and the two gentlemen continued on their way.</p>

  <p>'I suspected that,' said Peter. 'All the time I knew he wasn't an honest
  nude.'</p>

  <p>'Listen, sweetie,' replied Josephine. 'Taking off your clothes doesn't
  make you honest any more than putting them back on again makes you
  respectable.'</p>

  <p>'Taking them off certainly did things to us,' he observed. 'Are you
  complaining because I ruined you?' Jo demanded scornfully.</p>

  <p>My dear girl,' said Peter wearily, 'must we go into that again? You were
  putty in my hands. Putty.'</p>

  <p>'You poor fish,' she answered angrily. 'You haven't nerve enough to seduce
  an alligator.'</p>

  <p>'Not one man in a hundred has,' he assured her. 'Not one man in a
  thousand. Even less have the inclination.'</p>

  <p>'You are very fond of me, Peter&mdash;love me, in fact?' asked Jo.</p>

  <p>'Oh, very fond indeed. I dote on you, Jo. Love you as much as a coffee
  importer can. I've a dull background, though.'</p>

  <p>'But an aromatic one,' she said. 'I'm deeply in love with you, too, but I
  feel quite ashamed of my lack of discrimination. You're awful, Peter.'</p>

  <p>'You're not, Jo. You're beautiful. When I think of these brown eyes and
  all that red hair and all &mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I suppose you're quite overcome by the sheer quantity of things.'</p>

  <p>'More or less. I just can't see how you can care for me&mdash;don't
  understand how you can do it, that's all.'</p>

  <p>'I don't see how I can do it myself,' she told him. 'When I see you lying
  there in that cowardly sand-draped position with your unlovely feet sticking
  out, all my finer instincts tell me to get up and walk right away, but just
  the same I stick around. Love must be able to stand for 'most anything, and
  I'm that way about you.'</p>

  <p>'Does it come over you in waves?' he asked her. 'You know, in&mdash;in
  waves. A lot of waves coming over you?'</p>

  <p>'Do you mean do I feel as if I were drowning?' she wanted to know.</p>

  <p>Peter shrugged his shoulders hopelessly. Romance did not seem to be in his
  line.</p>

  <p>'Just waves,' he muttered moodily, wishing he had never attempted analogy.
  'Coming over one in waves, you know.'</p>

  <p>Jo looked him steadily in the eyes. There was a strange glint in hers.
  Suddenly she grabbed his head in her arms and hugged it roughly against her
  breast.</p>

  <p>'What a fool,' she said. 'Inarticulate&mdash;driveling. No sort of a lover
  at all, but don't worry about those waves of yours. I feel them, too.' She
  gave a sudden start and flung Peter's head away. 'You reptile,' she
  gasped.</p>

  <p>'What's up now?' he asked her.</p>

  <p>'Why, look what you did,' and she proceeded to show him. 'You pinched me
  with all your might&mdash;a regular nasty pinch, it was.'</p>

  <p>'Nonsense,' he retorted. 'I don't do things like that&mdash;not in
  public.'</p>

  <p>Jo regarded him intently, then unleashed a wild whoop.</p>

  <p>'There you go again,' she cried.</p>

  <p>From behind her came the exultant squawk of the duck, Ellis.</p>

  <p>'Why, you old bitch,' exclaimed Josephine. 'Let's leave her flat. She's
  pecking me.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, let her tag along,' said Peter. 'She's a good duck in her quaint
  way.'</p>

  <p>'Very well, then,' replied Jo, springing up from the sand. 'But not if she
  bites my&mdash;me there every time I hug your head. That's going from the
  sublime to the ridiculous.'</p>

  <p>'Snap to it, Ellis,' said Peter, reluctantly removing the sand from his
  body. 'Get a waddle on.'</p>

  <h2><a id="chap18"
     name="chap18">18. AN UNASSAULTED LADY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Facts were the only clouds that troubled Yolanda's
  unextensive spiritual horizon. She was upstage about facts&mdash;arrogant.
  And this was just too bad for Yolanda, because these small wings of reality,
  even when far out- stripped, have a nasty habit of overtaking the most
  evasive feet.</p>

  <p>She was one of those imperious creatures, was Yolanda, who can face
  anything&mdash;and outface most things&mdash;except facts of the unpleasant
  variety. To her way of thinking, they did not belong. And naturally. All her
  years of maturity had been devoted either to distorting or side-stepping the
  less agreeable facts motivating her self-indulgent conduct. In this she had
  been ably assisted by fond parents and flattering friends. She alone was not
  to blame.</p>

  <p>For example, Yolanda could never be wrong, and all the facts in creation
  were never going to make her wrong. They might make her angry, of course
  &mdash;shockingly and shrilly angry for a girl of Yolanda's breeding&mdash;
  but certainly not wrong. Had she been confronted with the facts of her
  relations with Mr. Jones, rather than admitting them quite cheerfully she
  would have done an intellectual tailspin and laid the blame on Peter or God
  or her high-strung nature or on any other convenient person or cause. She had
  one of those twisty minds that find no difficulty in sublimating their
  meanest little impulses to almost dizzily ethical heights. So much for her
  mental equipment.</p>

  <p>As she stood now a little apart from the others on the beach, following
  with clouded eyes the antics of the bathers, she found herself confronted by
  several facts she would much rather have avoided. However, even the
  slipperiest mind cannot easily get around the various glaring facts
  associated with a lot of naked bathers, especially when, as in this case, the
  men insisted in striking terrifically heroic attitudes as they leaped high in
  the air from the sand and the women kept dancing round jouncilly in almost
  human garlands, while a number of small children stood about and regarded the
  antics of their naked elders in bewildered disapproval.</p>

  <p>If the truth must be known, it was not the fact of nakedness that
  disquieted Yolanda's reflections as she stood there fully dressed on the sun-
  bright beach. It was the acceptance of the fact of nakedness that did things
  to her vanity&mdash;the incredible disregard of sex distinction all these
  naked men and women were displaying before her outraged eyes. The thing just
  could not be true. These people were pretending. Yolanda would not believe
  that a man could so far forget his place in life as to look on a naked woman
  with anything other than covetous eyes. Not that women desired this reaction
  &mdash;far from it&mdash;but men were that way about women. It was very
  annoying, but women had learned to expect it, some even endured it with a
  splendid display of fortitude. As a matter of fact, she herself had learned
  to endure the lascivious glances of men. Let the poor beasts ogle if it did
  them any good.</p>

  <p>At this moment, confronted by factual evidence of her own eyes, Yolanda
  still refused to believe that these men would remain insensible to her fair
  body should she remove the clothes from it and display it along the beach.
  She did not go so far as to say to herself that a riot would break out, but
  she did admit the possibility of a series of serious assaults not to mention
  innumerable insulting invitations. How could it be otherwise? And the women.
  How annoyed they would be&mdash;how enviously sympathetic. It was a
  fascinating idea. It crept inside Yolanda and gradually took possession of
  her.</p>

  <p>And in this the girl showed herself to be a little less than clever not to
  have realized the horrid fact that men, when engaged in striking heroic
  postures, cannot be induced to assume any others no matter how entertaining
  they promise to be. It is only after they have convinced all admiring females
  of their virility and physical perfection, of their masculine grace,
  fleetness, strength, and agility, that they will deign to consider the
  ultimate object of their peculiar behavior. Certain types of men when
  confronted by a beach suddenly become the silliest of God's creatures, also
  the most annoying. Show them a ball of any size, and what was a moment ago a
  paradise of sun-warmed contentment becomes a living hell. Contemplation and
  repose are shattered, bodies are endangered, eyes, mouths, and ears filled
  with sand. One can only rise wearily and stagger away. Boyishness in man is a
  much overrated attraction. It is even less endurable than manliness. Both
  deserve capital punishment.</p>

  <p>For the first time since she had become an involuntary guest of the nudist
  colony, Yolanda was moved by an impulse to emulate in public the example set
  by its members. She was more than moved by this daring impulse. She was
  actually impelled by it. As her dress fell to the sand and she stood in her
  low-cut slip for all the world to see, she felt herself on the threshold of a
  revolutionary experience. With the slip gone, little remained of Yolanda's
  clothing, but what little there was, that went, too, falling like foam round
  her feet on the yellow sand. For a moment she experienced the sensation of
  being blind. The pores of her skin were startled by the light. She gasped.
  She shrank a little.</p>

  <p>Then, for a moment, before self-consciousness shut down on her, she raised
  her arms to the sunlight and gave herself to its warmth&mdash;one of the few
  honest, unstudied gestures she had made since she had last been unaware of
  her naked body some twenty-odd years ago.</p>

  <p>This sudden, spontaneous gesture ended in a startled crouch as Yolanda
  realized her condition. Half frightened, half expectant, she glanced about
  her. As the warm air bathed her body and the shouts of the bathers drifted to
  her from down the beach, her thoughts were spinning dizzily. This was an even
  more difficult experience than any she had passed through under the skillful
  tutelage of Mr. Jones. Now she was so much alone, so definitely her own
  woman. Only her stockings remained between herself and complete nudity.
  Glancing down, she noticed that these sheer, well-filled sheaths of silk had
  become wrinkled since being detached from the garters. This would never do.
  Fastidiously she seated herself on her abandoned clothing and slipped off the
  stockings. Now she had done it, irretrievably committed herself to the
  official costume of the colony&mdash;bare flesh. Slowly she stood up, and as
  she did so the air and sunlight flooded round her body like the soft, clear
  waters of a pool. Dimly she felt all this, felt herself a living part of the
  beach, a little more intimate with the ocean and less remote from the gulls
  in the air. But dominating her consciousness was the thought of how she must
  look in the eyes of men, the effect she would have upon them. She knew she
  was fair to behold, a creature altogether lovely. Then another thought
  crossed her mind. Should she walk or run in her present nude state? Should
  she move along in maidenly aloofness, modest, subdued, and enticing? It was
  too bad they were all playing those silly games. All those men. All those
  naked men. Really, they were ridiculous. She would take their minds off their
  occupations. She would arouse them to an awareness of themselves. And the
  women? She would show the women that the feminine form was nothing to be
  taken lightly, to be accepted and dismissed by a flock of prancing males. For
  the life of her she could not understand why these women allowed themselves
  to be regarded as so many bits of landscape, why they seemed content to make
  garlands of themselves as indifferently as if there was not a man in sight.
  Surely this was depravity&mdash;this total lack of recognition of the
  difference existing between the sexes.</p>

  <p>Haltingly the girl moved along the beach in the direction of the bodies.
  Each step cost her an effort. Mental readjustment was coming in fits and
  starts. At times she found herself timid, at others bold and challenging.
  Once or twice she was tempted to turn back and put on her clothes. So far no
  one had looked her way. She had not been spied. But had she? That was a
  nagging question. Suppose she had been seen and taken for granted?
  Impossible. At least out of mere politeness a new naked body in their midst
  should give rise to a little display of interest. A fresh nude female figure
  among all these men should occasion some slight comment, cause eyes to peer
  and heads to turn. She would see about that.</p>

  <p>When she had approached still closer to the bathers, Yolanda decided she
  would feel somewhat more assured if she ran a little. Accordingly she
  gathered her courage and ran lightly and with heroically assumed casualness
  through the naked group, her eyes apparently fixed on space. Her first
  passage through failed to arouse the comment she had expected. She was still
  unassaulted as well as uninsulted. Had she imagined herself bathed in daring
  glances, or had her presence really passed unnoticed? She would try
  again.</p>

  <p>This time as she ran back she unfortunately tripped over a gentleman's leg
  and found herself sprawling in the sand. It was not a position in which she
  was anxious to he found. Certainly it failed to do her justice. Rather
  grotesque, she thought with a little shiver of revulsion. She was not doing
  well by herself. Before she could rise of her own accord, two huge arms
  picked her up and plopped her down again on the sand. The contact had been so
  forcible it made her teeth click. For a moment she sat there stunned. Was the
  assault about to begin? If so the aroused male was going about it in a
  surprisingly leisurely manner. She waited a few moments, then looked up over
  her shoulder. No one was paying the slightest attention to her. Strange
  &mdash;unbelievable. She rose and hurried through the group.</p>

  <p>As much disgusted as she was disturbed, Yolanda braced herself and
  returned to the battle. This time her passage was interrupted by the arrival
  of a basket-ball in the pit of her stomach. It bounced off with surprising
  speed, and Yolanda found herself on her back, getting a crab's-eye view of
  seemingly endless nakedness.</p>

  <p>'Lucky it wasn't the medicine ball,' said a man's voice above her. 'That
  would have taken the wind out of your sails.'</p>

  <p>Yolanda regarded the man hatefully even though she agreed with him. Lucky,
  indeed, it had not been the medicine ball. Its smaller and less weighty
  edition had been quite enough. Yolanda thought of the involuntary grunt it
  had surprised out of her. She found no pleasure in this thought. How horrid!
  Then, suddenly, it came to her that this was no way for a prominent young
  member of that high social circle, the Junior Daughters, to be found lying on
  a beach. She was altogether too prominent.</p>

  <p>Once more she picked herself up and scurried to the outskirts of the
  nudists. She was on the point of abandoning the experiment. She was beginning
  to feel that the proof of her point might involve too much wear and tear on
  the flesh as well as spirit. Still she was not convinced. Her failure so far
  had been due to accidents and not to any fault of her own. She would try
  again. This time, rather grimly, she launched her body into the naked mass of
  humanity. An old gentleman pushed her rudely.</p>

  <p>'There you go!' he exclaimed with the petulance of the aged. 'Spoiling my
  One Old Cat.'</p>

  <p>Vaguely Yolanda wondered what part of him he meant by his One Old Cat;
  then, as a tennis ball came flying through the air, she realized the old man
  was referring to some childish game.</p>

  <p>'Why don't you take your One Old Cat and play it somewhere else?' she
  inquired bitterly.</p>

  <p>'Beach free,' grunted the old man. 'Play One Old Cat where I like. You
  butted in.'</p>

  <p>Obviously there was no danger of assault from this infirm direction,
  decided Yolanda. All that aged creature's life seemed to consist of was his
  One Old Cat. She turned away and experienced the electrifying sensation of
  putting her foot down on a living being who had somehow managed to get itself
  tangled up with her legs. A yell of pain smote the air.</p>

  <p>'For God's sake, lady,' said the living being, 'be more careful where you
  put your feet. That might have been very serious. As it is &mdash;'</p>

  <p>Yolanda turned away from the investigating creature beneath her feet, but
  his voice still pursued her.</p>

  <p>'You've got to watch your step in a nudist colony,' he called after her.
  'If you think it's any fun &mdash;'</p>

  <p>A sudden resounding and extremely smart slap from the rear made Yolanda
  freeze in her tracks. Perhaps at last this was the prelude to an assault.
  Rather a common way of going about it, but she understood men were that way.
  In spite of her pain and indignation Yolanda kept her poise. Assuredly that
  slap&mdash;such a familiar, whole-hearted slap&mdash;must have denoted some
  slight show of interest on the part of the slapper. She turned and looked. A
  large, splendidly proportioned gentleman was confronting her.</p>

  <p>'Sir,' she said, 'did you slap me?'</p>

  <p>'Where?' he asked good-naturedly.</p>

  <p>'Need we go into that?' she inquired coldly.</p>

  <p>'Oh, there,' replied the man with a friendly smile. 'Perhaps I did. I
  slapped some one a moment ago. Might have been you.'</p>

  <p>'It was me,' said Yolanda.</p>

  <p>'Do you mind?' he asked. 'It's a habit of mine. Sort of playful. I see
  something and I slap it. That's all.'</p>

  <p>'That's all?' said Yolanda, greatly surprised. 'Isn't that enough&mdash;
  too much, in fact?'</p>

  <p>'Sure,' agreed the man pleasantly. 'If you want to get even I'll let you
  slap me back.'</p>

  <p>Here he turned round and waited expectantly. Yolanda, as she looked, felt
  strongly tempted to kick. In a sudden burst of exasperation she did kick. And
  this was her second honest and natural gesture in years. It was a terrific
  kick. Every toe on her foot was crumpled. Also it hurt the man, or at least
  surprised him mightily.</p>

  <p>'That's not fair,' he declared, turning round sharply. I wasn't expecting
  that.'</p>

  <p>'Neither was I,' said Yolanda. 'I wasn't expecting what you did. I forgot
  myself for a moment.'</p>

  <p>Upon hearing this, the man reached out and unceremoniously spun Yolanda
  about.</p>

  <p>'Well, here's one you won't forget in years,' he assured her, and he gave
  her a smart kick with his foot.</p>

  <p>Yolanda, whether she liked it or not, buckled outward and shot through
  space. She caromed off several naked bodies, barely kept her feet, and
  continued on to the outer fringe of the circle.</p>

  <p>As she stood looking back at her assailant she was surprised to find that
  the incident had passed unnoticed. Apparently these men and women were
  accustomed to indiscriminate kicking. She wondered how they could be. To her
  way of thinking, it was far worse than being assaulted, far more of a blow to
  one's self-respect. Yolanda's was completely gone. With a mad light in her
  eyes she hurried right back, and when the man was not looking she pounced
  like a cat into his flesh with her long, sharp finger-nails. This was one of
  the most satisfying experiences in Yolanda's life. The man uttered a scream
  of anguish and struck out instinctively. Unfortunately&mdash;that is,
  unfortunately for a small, thin lady, who chanced to be passing at that
  moment&mdash;the man's arm caught her under the chin and catapulted her
  through the air into and upon the stomach of a reclining body which
  immediately became passionately active. It seized upon the thin woman and
  threw her in the general direction of the sea. She failed to attain her
  objective, however, because of a forest of legs into which she plunged
  forthwith, only to find herself being sat upon from several different
  directions.</p>

  <p>From this moment on, the beach became the scene of the most irresponsible
  activity. It was nude against nude irrespective of sex or size. Yolanda felt
  herself rapidly being smothered by the dead weight of flesh bearing down upon
  her face. The girl was forced literally to bite her way to freedom and fresh
  air. As she rose weakly to her feet, her speed was accelerated by the feet of
  others pushing her violently from behind. As a result of this gratuitous
  boost she continued on in a graceful arc and landed on her face.</p>

  <p>'Pardon me, madam,' said a courteous voice. 'I intended that for some one
  else.'</p>

  <p>'That's no comfort to me,' replied Yolanda, grabbing the voice by its leg
  and giving it a vicious tug.</p>

  <p>The leg straightened and a body followed it out of the struggling mass of
  humanity.</p>

  <p>'Be careful of my scar,' said the small creature she was pulling over the
  sand. 'My operation is scarcely ten weeks old.'</p>

  <p>Wishing the operation had been performed on his throat instead of his
  appendix, Yolanda dropped the leg where it was and walked disgustedly away.
  She returned to her abandoned garments and wearily dragged them on her
  bruised and battered body. They could tear one another limb from limb for all
  she cared, those wild, infuriated nudes. Entirely disregarding the fact that
  she alone was responsible for making the nudes wild and infuriated, she hoped
  that the contest would spend itself in a homicidal draw, that it would end
  only because of a lack of live bodies. She was a bitterly disillusioned girl.
  Her experiment in public nudity had turned out miserably. She had discovered
  that there could be assaults and assaults. She had been subjected to the
  worst kind, the most unsociable and least flattering type. There had been no
  intent to please, but merely to maim. She would never attempt the experiment
  again, she decided, as she snapped the garters of her girdle to her
  stockings, flipped herself irritably into her brassiere, yanked on her
  step-ins, dropped her slip over her head, and covered all with a dress.</p>

  <p>Once more she was clothed and in her right mind. Her thoughts turned to
  Mr. Jones. She would return to the house and look for him.</p>

  <p>When she entered the long, low lounging room she found herself plunged
  into a scene that rivalled the beach in indignation, if not in action. Little
  Arthur appeared to be occupying none too happily the center of the stage. At
  least five excited nudes were pointing at him accusingly. Mr. Jones was
  endeavoring to bring the vociferating members to order while Peter,
  Josephine, Aspirin Liz, and Bishop Waller were lending attentive ears. As
  Peter regarded Little Arthur, Yolanda read in his expression a mixture of
  admiration and pride. What had the little man done thus to gain the approval
  of his master and the enmity of this small but earnest group of bodies?</p>

  <p>One of the first things Yolanda noticed was that Little Arthur's accusers
  seemed to be finding difficulty in putting their thoughts into intelligibly
  articulate words. It was as if they had found a bottle somewhere and punished
  it severely. An amazing amount of slurring and mouthing was going on. Several
  of these angry people were almost whistling. Some words never managed to get
  themselves pronounced at all, others only partially, imperfectly, much as if
  they were swimming under water.</p>

  <p>Her interest in this little scene made Yolanda forget for the moment her
  own distress and indignation. That she was an unassaulted lady no longer
  seemed to matter. Here was real anguish. Here was the stuff of authentic
  drama. Mr. Jones was speaking.</p>

  <p>'Little Arthur,' he was saying in a voice which strove to express
  patience, 'because members of a nudist colony are required to remove their
  clothes it does not follow that they must also remove their teeth if they
  chance to be wearing the removable type.'</p>

  <p>So this was the explanation of the mouthing. Yolanda shuddered a little.
  The five indignant nudes by sound and gesture made it clear that they were in
  complete agreement with their leader.</p>

  <p>'Then why do they go sleeping about the place with their mouths open?'
  demanded Little Arthur.</p>

  <p>'Little Arthur,' continued Jones, 'you don't seem to realize that a person
  has a right to sleep with his or her mouth in any desired position. Shut, of
  course, is more acceptable to the public, but the fact remains that an
  individual can sleep with his mouth set grim or gay, swinging like a gate or
  closed like a trap.'</p>

  <p>'According to his theory,' put in a large gentleman indistinctly, 'no open
  mouth in the colony would be safe.'</p>

  <p>'Some of 'em weren't open,' Little Arthur said, not without pride. 'They
  was almost gritted. That's where I showed my craft.'</p>

  <p>Cries of rage greeted this bragging statement.</p>

  <p>'No doubt you were deft,' agreed Mr. Jones equably. 'I cannot help
  admiring your technique myself, but it was used in a very low, a very
  degrading manner. You should leave other persons' mouths alone as well as
  what is in them, Little Arthur.'</p>

  <p>'In Gord's name, Mr. Jones,' exclaimed the exasperated little felon,
  'what's a high-class pickpocket going to do with a lot of naked thighs? He's
  gotter have some outlet.'</p>

  <p>'As regards the naked thighs,' observed Mr. Jones, 'your question rather
  embarrasses me. I would suggest that you consult the owner of the thighs.
  Mouths, however, are different. Once more I say, leave them entirely alone. I
  must protect my guests and their teeth.'</p>

  <p>'I had ter keep my hand in, didn't I?' demanded Little Arthur.</p>

  <p>'You didn't have to keep it in my mouth,' lisped a lady with artificially
  flaming hair.</p>

  <p>'Nor in mine,' cried the large gentleman.</p>

  <p>'Why don't you keep your hand in your own mouth?' asked a third nude.</p>

  <p>'What would be the fun in that?' retorted the small crook.</p>

  <p>'You might snap your tongue out,' suggested Jo.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' put in Peter, 'or bite off your pilfering fingers. Like Mr. Jones
  here, I admire your craftsmanship, Little Arthur, but I'd hate to let it be
  noised abroad that I employed a tooth-snatching valet. A pickpocket is bad
  enough, but a pick-mouth is just too much.'</p>

  <p>'You're all against me,' Little Arthur replied sorrowfully.</p>

  <p>'I'm not,' announced Aspirin Liz surprisingly. 'Although I don't hold with
  mouth-picking or tooth-snatching, I do know that a habit of years can't be
  dropped in a day.'</p>

  <p>'But teeth, my dear lady!' protested Mr. Jones. 'Of all things teeth! Let
  him steal anything in God's world but them. I'll tuck coins about the place
  for him to snatch if he'll only leave teeth alone.'</p>

  <p>'I'll give him five dollars if he'll give me mine back,' said the large
  man.</p>

  <p>'Don't want money,' Little Arthur replied. 'Don't want teeth. Just a
  little sport.'</p>

  <p>'It's about the lowest form of sport ever indulged in by man,' commented
  Mr. Jones to the group. 'In my mind it's worse than body-snatching. He leaves
  his victims bereft of pride and self-respect. Listen to the inhuman sounds
  the poor things are making.'</p>

  <p>'I wish we didn't have to,' replied Jo.</p>

  <p>'So do I,' agreed Mr. Jones, 'but this question of teeth has to be settled
  for once and all.'</p>

  <p>Bishop Waller spoke for the first time. It was clear to see he was deeply
  moved.</p>

  <p>'Not only is the theft of the teeth a crime in the eyes of God,' he said,
  'but also it is in shockingly bad taste. Of the two, bad taste is the harder
  to forgive. Little Arthur, I thought you had resolved to mend your ways.'</p>

  <p>'Bishop,' replied the little man contritely, 'you don't understand. You
  can no more keep from trying to save my soul than I can from picking your
  pockets while you're doing it. Here's one of your buttons.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, miserable sinner!' cried the Bishop, snatching the button from the
  extended hand. 'Now where does this belong?'</p>

  <p>Jo promptly started to look.</p>

  <p>'There, perhaps,' she said, pointing.</p>

  <p>With a startled exclamation Bishop Waller turned sharply away.</p>

  <p>'I will find the spot myself,' he said. 'You take my question too
  literally.'</p>

  <p>'It was merely a suggestion,' replied Jo.</p>

  <p>'A most improper one,' muttered the Bishop.</p>

  <p>From where I was standing,' said Jo, 'it was the most helpful one to
  make.'</p>

  <p>'As bad as that?' murmured Bishop Waller, his eyes darting over his
  jaegers. 'I must go in search of a pin. Perhaps I might even find a needle
  and a bit of thread. Pardon me.'</p>

  <p>Stepping cautiously, the Bishop ascended the stairs to interview the
  housekeeper.</p>

  <p>'To return to these teeth &mdash;' began Mr. Jones.</p>

  <p>'Must we?' inquired Jo.</p>

  <p>'I wish somehow,' said Peter, 'we could manage to drop the entire
  subject.'</p>

  <p>'I say return the teeth to their various mouths,' suggested Jo, 'and hang
  up an old pair of trousers for Little Arthur to play with. Put things in the
  pockets.'</p>

  <p>'He might try to wear them,' said Mr. Jones doubtfully.</p>

  <p>'Swear I won't, mister,' Little Arthur pleaded. 'I'll just creep up on
  them, like. It will give a guy something to do. My eyes are fair tired of
  human flesh.'</p>

  <p>'Will you restore the teeth to their rightful owners?'</p>

  <p>'I'll even put 'em back in their mouths,' replied the small dip
  eagerly.</p>

  <p>Howls of indignation from the wronged nudes.</p>

  <p>'I'll click my own teeth back, if you please,' said the large gentleman
  with great dignity.</p>

  <p>'Click,' observed Mr. Jones. 'My God, how descriptive!' He approached the
  silent Yolanda. 'Come,' he continued. 'I promised to show you the hot-
  houses.'</p>

  <p>As they strolled across the lawn, Yolanda made her protest.</p>

  <p>'I undressed on the beach,' she told him, 'and not a man made the
  slightest advance. They were very rough.'</p>

  <p>'Don't let that worry you at all,' said Mr. Jones smoothly. 'I'll see that
  something is done about it if I have to do it myself.'</p>

  <p>Yolanda's wounded vanity seemed somewhat appeased.</p>

  <p>The breeze was warm that night. A moist breeze drifting in from the sea.
  It trailed scarves of mist behind it and was faintly edged with the tang of
  salt. The water breathed quietly against the beach. It felt cool to Jo's feet
  as it stirred round them.</p>

  <p>'So you still insist on making me an honest woman?' she said to Peter who
  was dawdling by her side.</p>

  <p>'I wouldn't go so far as to attempt that,' he told her, 'but I am going to
  marry you good and proper the first damn chance I get.'</p>

  <p>'In spite of my depravity?'</p>

  <p>'Because of it, Jo.'</p>

  <p>'But suppose you discover I'm not really bad?'</p>

  <p>'By that time we'll be too old for it to make any difference, my
  girl.'</p>

  <p>'I really believe you're a man of low moral worth, Peter. A wicked man
  &mdash;not good at all.'</p>

  <p>'Maybe we're both good and don't know it.'</p>

  <p>'Wonder how one ever finds out?'</p>

  <p>'I don't quite know, Jo. You just muddle along together. No divided
  loyalties. No cheap evasions. And when you're through, you quit clean and
  cold if and when necessary.'</p>

  <p>'But, Peter, a man and a woman never feel that way about things at the
  same time.'</p>

  <p>'Then one of them has to stand the rap. It's better than ducking down
  alleys&mdash;happier in the long run. Habit and self-interest are often
  mistaken for kindness, Josephine.'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps we'll last for ever, Peter. It does happen, you know...at rare
  intervals.'</p>

  <p>Peter looked thoughtfully at the girl, then turned his eyes to the dark
  water. They were a little sad, those eyes, and touched with premature wisdom.
  Love did not last like that&mdash;or rarely ever. Most men were on the prowl
  and so many women felt the need of the prowler. It was the old army game.
  Quite as it should be. Of course, some couples sat at home at night and hated
  each other and listened to the radio and went to bed quietly but bitterly,
  each wanting to be wanted, yet concealing their frozen longings behind
  commonplace remarks. This business of romance&mdash;Peter was unable to
  figure it out. It was like a moth in the house, only it made holes in human
  emotions instead of clothes and things. He turned back to the small white
  figure and dropped two hands on the cool shoulders.</p>

  <p>Then quite suddenly Jo found herself sobbing quietly all over Peter's
  shoulder. Perhaps he had communicated to her something of his feeling of the
  impermanence of things. Perhaps she felt, too, that desire itself had a
  longer life than passion between individuals&mdash;it was a ruggeder product,
  far harder to tame and forget. And somehow it made such a mess of things.</p>

  <p>'I love you now, Peter,' she murmured. 'That's all I know.'</p>

  <p>'That's about all any one can say, little chap,' Peter answered as he
  gently shook her. 'I'm very much obliged.'</p>

  <p>'You should be,' she retorted. 'Haven't I given you the best years of my
  life?'</p>

  <p>'Those years are still to be lived, thank God,' said Peter. 'We'll wangle
  the best out of them&mdash;what say you?'</p>

  <p>'I say, you're almost pushing me out to sea,' complained Jo. 'Drag me back
  to shore or drown me and get it over with.'</p>

  <p>As they walked back across the lawn, Jo asked a disconcerting question:
  'What about Yolanda?' Involuntarily Peter glanced up at her window, then
  stopped.</p>

  <p>'Why, there's a man in her room,' he said. 'Look, Jo.'</p>

  <p>Jo looked. Outlined against the drawn shade were the figures of a man and
  a woman. They seemed to know each other quite well. Jo smiled cheerfully in
  the darkness.</p>

  <p>'She seems to have solved your problem for you,' she said.</p>

  <p>'Think I should do anything about it?' asked Peter.</p>

  <p>'This is more of a surprise than a blow, I confess.'</p>

  <p>'What can you do about it?' asked Jo in return. 'They seem to know what to
  do about it without your help.'</p>

  <p>'Shouldn't I at least shout?' said Peter. 'Or ask them to move?'</p>

  <p>'Forget it,' replied Jo briefly. 'The leader of a nudist colony has his
  hands full.'</p>

  <p>'Not to mention arms,' said Peter. 'Just the same, Jo, I'm one hell of a
  chaperon.'</p>

  <p>'Stupid,' she replied, 'if you knew women as a woman does, you'd know that
  each one cuddles within her the sparks of her own ruination.'</p>

  <p>Slowly they moved across the lawn.</p>

  <p>'Is the dew upon your feet?' asked Peter presently.</p>

  <p>'Great chunks of it,' said Jo.</p>

  <p>'Sleepy?' asked Peter.</p>

  <p>'Not a bit,' said Jo.</p>

  <p>'Good,' the man replied. 'Let's turn in.'</p>

  <p>'Why, Mr. Van Dyck, you say such things.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' replied Peter, 'I am quite a card.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap19"
     name="chap19">19. SOUND AND FURY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">At breakfast the following morning Mr. Jones made an
  announcement. The nudists greeted it with cheers. Not so Peter and his party.
  They were considerably alarmed, especially Little Arthur and Bishop
  Waller.</p>

  <p>'Ladies and gentlemen,' began Mr. Jones, rising and standing with one
  brown, slim hand resting lightly on the table. 'Fellow nudists. It is high
  time we interrupted our nakedness and returned to the animalism of the
  conventional life we have abandoned.'</p>

  <p>By this time a majority of the nudists in their spontaneous enthusiasm
  were stamping on the floor and tinkling their glasses with their knives. Mr.
  Jones waited modestly until the noise subsided.</p>

  <p>'Spring is now well advanced,' he continued, 'and in this connection it is
  generally agreed among poets that spring is the most immoral of the four
  seasons. Personally I have never found any great difference between them.
  However, there might be something in it.'</p>

  <p>'Mr. Jones,' called out the philosopher, whose name happened to be Horace
  Sampson, 'spring is perhaps the most suggestive of seasons. It is not as
  immoral as summer. Summer is notoriously immoral. In the short course of a
  northern summer the Eskimos go mad with love, I am told.'</p>

  <p>'If I had to love an Eskimo,' a slight blonde lady remarked, 'I think I'd
  go mad myself.'</p>

  <p>'The season's so short up there,' stated a lean-looking gentleman, 'I
  shouldn't think they'd have time to get out of their furs.'</p>

  <p>'They manage, nevertheless,' replied Mr. Sampson.</p>

  <p>'Perhaps they start to undress somewhere towards the breaking up of
  winter,' some one suggested.</p>

  <p>'I confess,' said Mr. Jones, 'that I do not know the technique of the
  Eskimo in such matters.'</p>

  <p>'You surprise me,' observed Peter. 'It is difficult to believe that the
  women of any race or clime have quite escaped the liberating influence of
  your Civilized Occasions.'</p>

  <p>'I can't be everywhere at once,' replied Mr. Jones.</p>

  <p>Color was mounting to Yolanda's cheeks. She looked a little
  frightened.</p>

  <p>'Well,' put in Jo, 'when this place is pinched, as eventually it will be,
  you can hurry right up to Alaska and go mad with the Eskimos.'</p>

  <p>'I shall bear that in mind,' replied the leader. 'Thanks for the
  suggestion.'</p>

  <p>'Not at all,' Josephine replied. 'You probably had it in mind
  already.'</p>

  <p>'Spring was always my most difficult season,' announced a still pretty
  woman with large dark eyes. 'I never did succeed in getting through a spring
  season without saying yes to some one.'</p>

  <p>'It was your generous nature, my dear,' said a lady sitting opposite her.
  'I always found summer almost unavoidable.'</p>

  <p>'This is scarcely the time for tender confessions,' remarked Mr. Jones.
  'If there are no further suggestions, I'll continue.'</p>

  <p>'By all means,' rumbled Mr. Sampson. 'Sorry I started the discussion.'</p>

  <p>'I have noticed,' resumed Mr. Jones, 'a growing tendency to nervousness
  and strain and an almost flagrant infraction of the regulations governing the
  conduct of our members.'</p>

  <p>'I just couldn't help it, Mr. Jones,' a young lady called out. 'That man
  kept on pestering me until &mdash;'</p>

  <p>'No specific reference was implied, Miss Joyce,' Mr. Jones interrupted
  hastily. 'But to continue. Quarrels breaking out between the male and female
  members of the colony have a way of ending up altogether too amicably. Of
  course, there are a number of you who could still hold out for several
  months.'</p>

  <p>'Indefinitely, sir,' said an elderly gentleman.</p>

  <p>'Splendid,' said Mr. Jones. 'However, all things considered, I feel that
  it would be best to declare a one-week Season of Forgetfulness almost
  immediately. It will open to-morrow night at dinner and close, for those who
  have been able to stick it out, just one week later.'</p>

  <p>More cheers and thumping. The elderly gentleman who could hold out
  indefinitely did not join in the applause.</p>

  <p>'For those of you who don't know,' continued Mr. Jones, 'everything is
  tolerated&mdash;nay, encouraged&mdash;during the Season of Forgetfulness
  &mdash;everything save murder. It is, of course, understood that husbands and
  wives cannot base divorce proceedings on the grounds of each other's conduct
  during this season. Nor can any member withdraw from the colony as a result
  of it. It is hoped, on the other hand, that all members will lend their
  willing support and do everything in their power to make this orgy a success.
  If each one of us does his or her bit, if each one of us gives the worst that
  is in him, if we all band together in a spirit of libidinous abandon, I feel
  that we cannot fail. Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Jones, his eyes flashing with the consciousness of duty well done, sat
  down amid wild applause. Already men and women were beginning to size one
  another up.</p>

  <p>'My dear sir,' said Bishop Waller in a low voice to Peter, 'I never heard
  anything like it. Why, one would think he was addressing a meeting of
  Rotarians or the members of a college football team instead of a group of
  eternally damned souls. Jaegers or no jaegers, accompanied or single-handed,
  I intend to make my escape to-night. I am determined to shake from my feet
  the dust of this terrible place.'</p>

  <p>The excellent bishop was not alone in this determination. When the small
  band of castaways foregathered some time later in a secluded part of the
  lawn, they were joined by the philosopher, who frankly stated his case and
  asked to be admitted to their number.</p>

  <p>'I have finished my investigations here,' he said with a shrug of his fine
  shoulders. 'All this forgetfulness stuff is an old story to me. And the way
  they go about it is far too collegiate for one of my temperament. Some still
  seem to enjoy it, but frankly I don't. I am by nature an unmoral
  nonconformist. I can't stand mob righteousness any more than mob depravity. I
  suggest we finish with them before they finish us. I say, clear out naked as
  we are and take a chance on finding something to drape over our bodies.'</p>

  <p>'Listen,' put in Little Arthur. 'I gotter pick up the lawn to-day, and
  that means sticking trash and papers in a bag. When they're all down at the
  beach prancing, or in eating dinner, I'll sneak some sheets inter the bag and
  drag 'em out to the woods. What do you say about that?'</p>

  <p>'Merely this,' replied Bishop Waller. 'It strikes me that we must all be
  saved from Sodom through the stealth of a converted pickpocket. In the light
  of this I feel that it would be difficult to accuse God of being altogether
  lacking in a slightly ironical vein of humor.'</p>

  <p>'I trust you will use your influence,' remarked Mr. Horace Sampson, 'to
  see that the situation does not become too funny.'</p>

  <p>'If I ever get a sheet over my nakedness,' said Peter, 'you can laugh
  yourself sick for all I care.'</p>

  <p>'No doubt we will,' declared Jo. 'I'm going to make a hole in mine and
  stick my head through.'</p>

  <p>I think I will swathe mine round the upper half of my body,' said the good
  Bishop reflectively. 'The lower half still seems able to hold its own.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, quite,' replied Peter, looking sharply at the Bishop.</p>

  <p>'If we ever get back to civilization, Bishop Waller,' Aspirin Liz put in,
  'you should send those drawers to the Smithsonian Institution.'</p>

  <p>'I wish you would give them their proper name,' Bishop Waller protested.
  'This garment is known as jaegers.'</p>

  <p>'Don't care whether they're jaegers, jumpers, or jiggers,' the ex-model
  replied. 'You're wearing whatever they are where most men wear their
  drawers.'</p>

  <p>Of all the party Yolanda alone remained silent. Why should she accompany a
  number of sheet-clad figures back to civilization? There would surely be a
  scandal.</p>

  <p>'At nine o'clock in the woods,' said Horace Sampson. 'Come singly or in
  pairs.'</p>

  <p>The party then broke up, and for the remainder of the day its members went
  innocently about their separate ways. At dusk Little Arthur could have been
  seen, had any one cared to look at Little Arthur, dragging an old potato sack
  disconsolately in the direction of the woods.</p>

  <p>But from a distance the observer would not have known that petty thief was
  sweating from his efforts to look as if he were not there at all.</p>

  <p>At nine o'clock that night Yolanda was a greatly worried young lady. The
  spirit of the approaching festivities had entered into her blood. She felt
  that she deserved one Season of Forgetfulness. All her life she had been
  remembering herself. Now for once she would like to forget and to find out
  what happened. Yet she hated to admit this fact to the members of the party.
  She was standing deep in the woods with Peter and Josephine. The others had
  not yet arrived.</p>

  <p>'Listen, Peter,' she began in an agitated voice. 'I can get out at any
  time I want. Don't you think it would be a good idea for me to return and
  cover your retreat in case you should be missed?'</p>

  <p>'Do you want to go back?' he asked her.</p>

  <p>Yolanda nodded her head in the darkness. She could not say it in so many
  words. When she spoke, her voice no longer carried its old imperious
  note.</p>

  <p>'He comes of a fine old family, Peter,' she said.</p>

  <p>'Would you like to increase it?' asked Peter.</p>

  <p>'Don't be common,' she retorted with a small show of spirit.</p>

  <p>Josephine put her arm round the girl.</p>

  <p>'Do you care for the suave Mr. Jones?' asked Jo.</p>

  <p>For a moment Yolanda was suspicious, then she capitulated to the red-
  haired girl.</p>

  <p>'You know how it is,' she murmured. 'I&mdash;I think so now.'</p>

  <p>'Then go back and land him,' said Jo, 'but for the love of Mike keep your
  head.'</p>

  <p>Yolanda squeezed Jo's hand.</p>

  <p>'I never knew life was so different,' she offered rather timidly. 'So much
  better and so much worse. Good-bye, Peter. Do you mind?'</p>

  <p>For answer, Peter tilted up her chin and kissed her lightly on the
  lips.</p>

  <p>'It was a nice long engagement,' he said. 'You deserve some compensation.
  Good luck, Yolanda.'</p>

  <p>The next moment his one-time fiancée was slipping among the trees on her
  way back to Mr. Jones and the Season of Forgetfulness.</p>

  <p>On the outer edge of the woods a high wall confronted the escaping party,
  all members of which were present with the exception of Yolanda, whose
  absence remained tactfully unobserved. As the six sheet-draped figures stood
  considering this obstruction, the scolding voice of a duck churning up last
  year's leaves with its wings fired them into sudden action.</p>

  <p>'My God,' said Peter. 'Havelock Ellis is with us.'</p>

  <p>'But not for long,' said Horace Sampson, scooping the bird from the
  leaves. 'I'm going to wring her neck.'</p>

  <p>Jo snatched the duck from the philosopher and thrust its jeering head
  under a wing.</p>

  <p>'No bloodshed,' she whispered. 'Get me over the wall, Peter. I'll take
  care of Ellis.'</p>

  <p>'Are there glass or spikes?' asked the Bishop when Jo had reached the
  top.</p>

  <p>'The former,' replied Jo. 'I am trying to sit as lightly as a
  feather.'</p>

  <p>Little Arthur looked at Liz and tittered behind his hand. 'What a break,'
  he said, 'for a fat lady.'</p>

  <p>'If any glass gets into me,' she muttered, 'you're going to pick it
  out.'</p>

  <p>'May my fingers wither first,' Little Arthur said in an awed voice.
  'They've picked a lot in their day, but they'll never pick that.'</p>

  <p>Aspirin Liz's difficulty was obviated by the employment of a sheet as a
  buffer between herself and the glass. Soon the party was standing, a trifle
  torn and disheveled, on the other side of the wall.</p>

  <p>'There is no doubt now,' said the Bishop, 'about there being holes in my
  jaegers. I can feel them quite distinctly.'</p>

  <p>'I wish you wouldn't,' said Mr. Sampson.</p>

  <p>'Pardon an old man's curiosity,' replied the Bishop. 'These jaegers have
  served me well.'</p>

  <p>A winding tree-fringed road lay in front of them. An occasional light
  shining through the branches marked the habitations of man. The moon was not
  yet risen, and the way was dark. From time to time a sleepy clucking issued
  from Havelock Ellis resting comfortably in Jo's left arm. She had refused to
  abandon the duck. In this Peter had supported her.</p>

  <p>'I suggest,' said the tall philosopher, 'that we set off at a brisk trot.
  Mr. Jones's attendants are many, and they are strong, rough men. At any
  moment we might be yanked back over that wall by a dozen or more ruthless
  hands.'</p>

  <p>Accordingly the party set itself in motion, the philosopher setting the
  pace. Aspirin Liz and Bishop Waller brought up the rear, the Bishop being
  slightly in advance. He seemed to be experiencing considerable difficulty
  with his jaegers. His efforts to keep them from falling off impeded his own
  as well as his companion's progress. The suspense was beginning to wear on
  the fat lady's nerves.</p>

  <p>'Bishop,' she panted at last, 'you'll have to do something about those
  drawers. Either take them off or keep them on. I can't stand the strain.'</p>

  <p>'After all the turmoil they've been through,' retorted the Bishop, 'these
  jaegers stay on. It is the will of God.'</p>

  <p>'He doesn't seem to have quite made up His mind,' said Liz, 'from the way
  those drawers are behaving.'</p>

  <p>'Nevertheless,' replied the Bishop, giving the garment a violent tug, 'at
  this late date you cannot expect me to abandon them.'</p>

  <p>'From several views I got,' said Liz, 'they seemed to be abandoning
  you.'</p>

  <p>'Madam,' admonished the Bishop, 'we're in an extremely tough spot, as the
  saying goes. We have no time to discuss whether I am abandoning my jaegers or
  they are abandoning me.'</p>

  <p>Liz heaved a vast sigh and paddled after the Bishop through the night.
  Suddenly the headlights of an approaching automobile threw the party into
  sharp relief. Without a moment's hesitation the philosopher, Sampson, turned
  off the road and led his followers behind a billboard.</p>

  <p>'This is the first time,' he told them, 'I ever saw any good reason for a
  billboard. Usually I consider them the most insulting form of
  advertising.'</p>

  <p>'It would be pretty,' observed the Bishop, 'if those motorists happened to
  be among my parishioners. The headlights caught my jaegers at a rather daring
  angle.'</p>

  <p>'One moment,' whispered Peter, holding up an arresting hand. 'Those
  motorists have stopped to investigate.'</p>

  <p>Silence behind the billboard. Voices from the road.</p>

  <p>'But if you do find a lot of naked bodies,' the party heard a woman say,
  'what on earth are you going to do with them? Can't ask them to take a
  ride.'</p>

  <p>'I can ask them to go home,' came the voice of the woman's companion.
  'Don't know what this part of the world is coming to if a man can't go
  driving without running into a flock of nudes.'</p>

  <p>'You're not so upset as you'd have me believe,' sniffed the lady. 'You're
  looking for that girl.'</p>

  <p>'Nonsense,' retorted the man. 'She was nearly wearing a sheet. All of them
  were, in fact.'</p>

  <p>'Sure,' scoffed the lady. 'Nearly but not quite.'</p>

  <p>The man disappeared behind the billboard, and in a surprisingly short time
  reappeared totally naked save for his shoes and socks. The philosopher was a
  fast worker. With the assistance of Bishop Waller they rapidly stripped the
  man and distributed his garments among them. To Peter's lot fell a shirt and
  vest. The philosopher got the trousers, which first had been unsuccessfully
  attempted by Aspirin Liz. Little Arthur fell heir to a pair of shorts, and Jo
  to the man's coat. Bishop Waller dragged a sleeveless under-shirt over the
  upper half of his body. The frail garment came to about his fifth rib before
  it split up the middle. The Bishop looked disappointed.</p>

  <p>'If we had to strip a fellow-creature,' he observed, 'and send him back
  naked into the world, I wish God had seen fit to make him several sizes
  larger.'</p>

  <p>'He must be quite the smallest man in the world,' replied Mr. Sampson.
  'These trousers haven't the slightest intention of meeting in the front. Just
  take a look at them.'</p>

  <p>'If you please,' protested Bishop Waller, 'my eyes have seen enough. The
  attempts of Liz to squeeze into them took ten years off my life.'</p>

  <p>'The seat of those pants is no bigger than a dime,' Aspirin Liz put in.
  'Never knew they came so small. Let's take a look at the little shaver.'</p>

  <p>The assaulted motorist could not stand for this. He tore off the sheet
  which had been wrapped round his head by the astute Sampson, and dashed back
  to the car. A slight scream greeted his appearance.</p>

  <p>'Give me the lap robe, quick!' cried the man. 'They've taken all my
  clothes.'</p>

  <p>'You don't have to tell me that,' said the lady. 'If you get in this car,
  I get out.'</p>

  <p>'But I can't stand here naked in the middle of the road,' he
  protested.</p>

  <p>'Neither can I go driving on a public highway with a stark naked man,'
  came the reasonable reply.</p>

  <p>'But aren't we engaged?' the naked man pleaded.</p>

  <p>'I wouldn't even do it,' he was firmly assured, 'if we were married by the
  Pope.'</p>

  <p>'Catholics,' reflected the Bishop, finding comfort in the thought. 'Just
  the same, I hope God in His wisdom will be able to find some slight
  justification for my ruthless conduct to-night.'</p>

  <p>It will never be known how the naked motorist and his fiancée settled
  their little difficulty. He may be standing there yet trying to persuade her
  to let him get into the car. The fugitives did not linger to listen to the
  discussion. Down the road they swarmed in the wake of the sprinting
  philosopher.</p>

  <p>'The way that shirt flares out from your little vest,' observed Jo, 'is a
  sight to behold. You should be jumping through hoops.'</p>

  <p>'Glad you find it amusing,' said Peter. 'You are protruding in various
  spots yourself, my sweet.'</p>

  <p>'Bishop,' remarked Aspirin Liz, 'I'm afraid you are not improved. That
  shirt does no earthly good.' Little Arthur dropped back behind them.</p>

  <p>'What do you think of the drawers, Liz?' he panted.</p>

  <p>'Too athletic for words,' said the lady. 'How did you manage to get inside
  them?'</p>

  <p>At that moment they caught up with the grotesque figures ahead of them.
  Jo, Peter and the philosopher were peering into the back of an empty truck.
  Peter climbed quickly in and helped Jo to follow him. Darkness swallowed
  them. The philosopher sprang aboard. Rather than be left behind, the Bishop,
  Liz, and Little Arthur scrambled into the truck. Two men tramped from the
  woods and, mounting to the front seat, set the truck in motion.</p>

  <p>'This will give us a breathing spell,' Horace Sampson whispered.</p>

  <p>'We will need it,' replied the Bishop, 'when those gentlemen ahead
  discover what they have behind.'</p>

  <p>'I have nothing behind,' muttered Peter. 'Forgot my sheet.'</p>

  <p>For a quarter of an hour they bumped along in silence. Suddenly and to
  their great consternation the truck shot through a high gate and they found
  themselves looking out on a brightly lighted street. The transition was so
  startling that even the duck awoke and began to squawk a volley of evil
  language.</p>

  <p>'What's wrong with your horn, Bill?' asked the man sitting beside the
  driver. 'Sounds sort of strange to me.'</p>

  <p>'That ain't my horn,' said Bill. 'Must be some guy behind us.'</p>

  <p>The squawking continued in a hoarse but muffled voice.</p>

  <p>'Damned if that ain't the queerest horn I ever did hear,' remarked Bill's
  companion.</p>

  <p>'I'm going to get out and knock the block off whoever's blowing the thing
  at me,' declared Bill with determination.</p>

  <p>The truck drew up, and the two gentlemen descended to the street. No other
  car was following. Bill's friend listened intently.</p>

  <p>'It's coming from inside,' he said in a low voice.</p>

  <p>'From inside who?' asked Bill, somewhat startled.</p>

  <p>'From inside us,' replied the other.</p>

  <p>'Not from inside me,' declared Bill. 'I couldn't make sounds like that
  even if I did my best.'</p>

  <p>'I mean inside the truck,' said the other man.</p>

  <p>'Oh,' replied Bill. 'That won't be hard to find out.' They approached the
  back of the truck, and Bill thrust in a grasping hand.</p>

  <p>'I've got hold of a leg,' he cried in a shocked voice.</p>

  <p>'You've got hold of mine,' came the voice of Aspirin Liz. 'Is that any way
  to act?'</p>

  <p>'Golly,' said the friend. 'The whole truck is full of them&mdash;a lot of
  funny people.'</p>

  <p>'&mdash;Get out of there,' roared Bill, who at heart was not a kind man.
  'Get out or I'll call a cop.'</p>

  <p>'&mdash;If we get out you won't have to call a cop,' said Peter bitterly.
  'Any number of cops will come of their own accord.'</p>

  <p>'Let us depart in peace,' said the Bishop in a hollow voice, 'and put our
  trust in God.'</p>

  <p>'&mdash;I'll never put my trust in a duck again,' Josephine told the world
  as she followed the others into the light of the street from the comfortable
  darkness of the truck.</p>

  <p>Bill and his friend stood speechless. This moment was one of the really
  few high spots in their lives, one which they realized at the time would
  never grow stale or lose its wonder.</p>

  <p>'Shouldn't we call the cops anyway?' the friend at length found words to
  ask.</p>

  <p>Bill shook his head.</p>

  <p>'That guy without the pants said it,' he replied. 'They'll get plenty of
  cops without our help.'</p>

  <p>As the fugitives, now a compact mass, trotted fearfully down the street,
  several policemen were already following them unbelievingly. As accustomed as
  they were to the strange sights of Coney Island, they were nevertheless
  shocked by this one. Some sideshow had gone mad or was openly defying the
  law. Whistles sounded, and pedestrians stopped in their tracks. Traffic
  became snarled, and two automobiles collided owing to the preoccupation of
  their drivers.</p>

  <p>'We are being followed,' gasped the Bishop.</p>

  <p>'I'd be amazed if we weren't,' Josephine replied.</p>

  <p>'Turn in here,' commanded Mr. Horace Sampson. 'And stick together. We
  might find some place of concealment.'</p>

  <p>But the amusement park into which the party dashed over the prostrate body
  of the ticket collector offered no place of concealment, although for a
  moment several of its members disappeared from view down the smooth, steeply
  slanting sides of a wooden bowl.</p>

  <p>'I have never been able to see the fun in this sort of thing,' observed
  Mr. Horace Sampson as he painfully collected his scattered limbs.</p>

  <p>'What sort of thing is it?' groaned the Bishop. 'And how does one ever get
  out of it?'</p>

  <p>'One claws one's way up the sides,' Jo remarked, 'only to be hurled back
  by some sportive reveler, several of whom are already peering down at us and
  waiting for the kill. Any one seen a duck, and where might Peter be?'</p>

  <p>A long arm with a torn shirt-sleeve reached down as the girl spoke, and
  pulled her up the side of the pit.</p>

  <p>'I was just asking about you,' Jo said coolly to Peter. 'Where's our
  duck?'</p>

  <p>'She's knocking about somewhere,' Peter answered. 'Do you realize we're in
  one of the most fiendishly playful amusement parks in the world? It's not
  officially open yet according to the signs.'</p>

  <p>'Well, it is now,' said Jo, glancing about her. 'We've opened it
  officially, although I am not amused. I don't want to play with this
  park.'</p>

  <p>The Bishop looked miserably up at them.</p>

  <p>'I very much fear God has withdrawn His protection,' he called to Peter.
  'Maybe you could help.'</p>

  <p>As Peter drew the Bishop up the side, the philosopher almost bounded out.
  He had figured out the theory of the thing, then put it to the test.
  Unfortunately he overshot his mark and was carried by his terrific speed on
  to a flat surface composed of innumerable large discs spinning in opposite
  directions. For a moment sheer surprise overcame his philosophical
  resignation as his feet went up in the air and he found himself revolving in
  what he felt convinced could be nothing less than five different directions
  at the same time. Bishop Waller, blindly following the leader, promptly found
  himself in similar circumstances and breathed an urgent but dizzy prayer for
  divine intervention.</p>

  <p>'This one is even less diverting,' shouted Mr. Sampson as he was whirled
  into the orbit of the Bishop.</p>

  <p>'How does one get off?' called that good man.</p>

  <p>'I suppose one eventually gets flung off,' Mr. Sampson called back.
  'Either that or one keeps on spinning hither and yon until the park closes
  for the night or season.'</p>

  <p>Bishop Waller did not hear the end of this speech, but he heard enough to
  remove all doubt concerning God's indifference to his lot. He closed his
  eyes, and when he opened them again he saw a policeman standing at the border
  of the spinning plane, and this policeman, to the Bishop's horror, had his
  cynically amused eyes fixed on the lower half of his, the Bishop's, person.
  Too late he realized that he and his long-suffering jaegers had come to the
  parting of the ways. Other policemen collected and stood watching the
  twirling bodies.</p>

  <p>'I've seen some strange sights down here,' said one of them, 'but this
  takes the cake. Naked they are, no less. What Judge Wagger won't do to
  them!'</p>

  <p>As Peter and Jo stood clinging to a rustic bridge gone violently mad in
  every plank, they had the pleasure of seeing Little Arthur dangling in the
  air from the crossbar of a flying trolley. Elevated as he was from the
  ground, the small creature presented neither a picturesque nor modest figure
  to those below, especially now that he was wearing the stolen shorts upon his
  feet. As he sped through the night on the trolley, two large uniformed
  officers sped beneath him. They were waiting for him literally to drop into
  their hands, which inevitably he would be forced to do.</p>

  <p>'Wouldn't like to be in his shoes,' Peter chattered.</p>

  <p>'We're not occupying a bed of roses,' Josephine told him. 'There is more
  than one policeman waiting for us at either end of this infuriated
  bridge.'</p>

  <p>'I suppose we're through,' said Peter.</p>

  <p>'I've been through for quite some time,' came Jo's broken words. 'Life
  goes on inside, but it is a purely mechanical arrangement.'</p>

  <p>'I wonder if I could manage a kiss on this bucking span?' said Peter.</p>

  <p>'Come over here on my side,' she told him, 'and we'll swing in the same
  direction. I'd hate to have my teeth knocked out from too violent a
  contact.'</p>

  <p>Peter moved over and took the jouncing figure of Jo in his arms and in so
  doing succeeded in pulling her with him to the floor of the bridge.</p>

  <p>'We're going, Jo!' he cried.</p>

  <p>'Then go ahead and kiss me,' she called out in jumping accents as she
  pressed her lips to his.</p>

  <p>'Be God if they're not love-making on that dangerous contraption,' said an
  officer in an awed voice. 'And in their terrible condition and all.'</p>

  <p>Still clinging desperately together, the two bodies rolled and jostled
  into the arms of the law. A policeman tossed a raincoat over Jo and helped
  her to arise. For a moment she leaned dizzily against him, and during that
  moment he became a trifle dizzy himself. Peter rose more slowly and
  fastidiously readjusted the tails of his flaring shirt.</p>

  <p>'Will you look at that, I ask you,' breathed a policeman.</p>

  <p>They all did.</p>

  <p>The philosopher and the Bishop, having been tossed out of the officers'
  reach by some caprice of the flying discs, were now doing their utmost to
  make good their escape. The philosopher was bounding up a high flight of
  spiral stairs, and the Bishop, clinging to his jaegers, was doing his best to
  bound after his friend. For a moment they stood poised on the summit of the
  stairs; then, with two hoarse cries of defiance, they launched themselves
  down the slide that snaked away from their feet. It was a short slide but an
  impressive one. Several policemen picked them up, then stood looking at them
  curiously.</p>

  <p>'Well, you're a couple of rare birds,' one of the officers said at
  last.</p>

  <p>'You're wrong there, my man,' replied the Bishop.</p>

  <p>'We're a couple of raw birds. Have you by chance a pin?'</p>

  <p>'You know, my dear Bishop,' said the philosopher as the policeman hustled
  them along, 'I could almost grow to like that last thing we did.'</p>

  <p>'I very much fear,' said the Bishop, 'that it's the last thing we will
  ever do of our own free will.'</p>

  <p>On their way to the patrol wagon they were joined by the captors of Jo and
  Peter. At the same moment another diversion claimed the attention of the
  consolidated party. From the bowels of a frantically revolving barrel came
  the agonized voice of Aspirin Liz.</p>

  <p>'Will one of you cops for God's sake come in here and arrest me?' the ex-
  model managed to get out between twirls and bounces. 'I'd rather stay in jail
  for life than in here for another minute.'</p>

  <p>An officer reached in the barrel and dragged the lady to safety. She still
  had her sheet, but it was serving no practical purpose, being wrapped round
  her head. Another raincoat was called for and tossed over Liz.</p>

  <p>'One solid mass of bruises,' she muttered. 'I wonder what black-hearted
  torturer ever thought out this place.'</p>

  <p>While the officers were concentrating on Aspirin Liz, a familiar drowsy
  clucking issued from a near-by trash receptacle. Swiftly Jo reached down,
  seized the nodding duck, and concealed it under her coat.</p>

  <p>'She's a very adaptable duck, isn't she, Peter?' Jo said with a smile to
  the man at her side.</p>

  <p>'If she'd kept her damn mouth shut,' he replied, 'we wouldn't be where we
  are now.'</p>

  <p>'We might have been in even a worse place,' she answered, 'though I can't
  think of one at the moment.'</p>

  <p>Through two solid walls of humanity they were ushered into the patrol
  wagon, where Little Arthur sat huddled in the gloom. He brightened up
  considerably at the appearance of his friends.</p>

  <p>'Some night,' was his inclusive greeting. 'What do yer say, folks? Hasn't
  it been some night?'</p>

  <p>'It has indeed been some night,' agreed the Bishop, 'and unfortunately,
  Little Arthur, it is not at an end.'</p>

  <p>'We'll have to come back some time,' said Jo, 'and do it all over
  again.'</p>

  <p>'I'd rather be hung,' put in Aspirin Liz, 'than give that barrel another
  chance at me.'</p>

  <p>'One end at least we've achieved,' declared Horace Sampson, a philosopher
  to the last. 'By getting ourselves in the clutches of the law we are safe
  from those of the over-hospitable Mr. Jones and his minions.'</p>

  <p>'It looks like a Season of Total Obscurity to me,' observed Peter, pressed
  closely against Jo.</p>

  <p>'We're far better off where we are,' said the Bishop. 'Far better off, my
  boy, and that is none too good.'</p>

  <p>As the patrol wagon clanged down the street between blaring and brightly
  lighted show places, Josephine felt around her more than the arms of the Law.
  With a happy sigh she settled back. She was both loved and in love. The Law
  did not matter.</p>

  <p>'May I kiss my young man?' she asked one of the officers seated near the
  door.</p>

  <p>'Might as well, baby,' he told her. 'You won't be seeing much of each
  other for a long, long time.'</p>

  <p>'Little Arthur,' said Aspirin Liz sadly, 'I think I could almost like you,
  I feel so sorry for myself.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap20"
     name="chap20">20. MAGISTRATE WAGGER HEARS A LOT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Magistrate Wagger suffered from insomnia, so he occasionally
  held court at night. On these occasions the delinquents brought before him
  did considerable suffering on their own account. Whenever the good magistrate
  found himself unable to sleep, he began to think of his prisoners. It galled
  him exceedingly to visualize them peacefully slumbering in their various
  cells. Why should Guilt wallow in smug repose while Justice lay haggard and
  stared into the darkness? Wagger could see no logical reason for this. He
  would give those sleep-sodden malefactors something to keep them awake for a
  long, long time. He would share his insomnia with them.</p>

  <p>Of course, it may be argued that a man poisoned by the venom of Magistrate
  Wagger's mental outlook at these moments was in no condition to dispense
  justice&mdash;to hold in his hands, as it were, the fate of erring humanity.
  But when a judge or a magistrate has already decided to send some one to
  jail, the method of procedure really does not matter. Whether it is done with
  a cheerful smile or a dark frown makes very little difference to the
  prisoner. Three months are three months, regardless of how one is given
  them.</p>

  <p>Withal, Magistrate Wagger's manner on the bench was not as sinister as one
  might expect. It was not nearly so sinister as was the man himself. Inasmuch
  as the night meant nothing to him, he did not care how long he sat up in
  court himself or others sat up with him. Here there were lights and company
  &mdash;conversational opportunities to bring relief to the weary mind. After
  he had put half a dozen offenders definitely behind the bars, Magistrate
  Wagger usually was able to sleep like a top.</p>

  <p>He was a small, thin, wiry individual with a mop of grey hair that gave
  the impression of having been unpleasantly startled. His face was small, too,
  and looked like a mahogany-colored mask of enigmatic expression. If one
  decided that the black eyes that snapped and burned beneath the grey bars of
  his eyebrows were a trifle mad, one would not have been far from wrong. They
  were mad usually and could easily become furious.</p>

  <p>To-night as the six bruised and battered, not to mention almost naked,
  fugitives from the nudist colony were ushered into his presence, he failed to
  witness their demoralizing entrance, being engaged at the moment in studying
  some court records. When he did look up, his mind filled with other things,
  he did not at first appreciate the magnitude of the scene he was
  beholding.</p>

  <p>'What have we here?' he began in a preoccupied voice. 'What have we here?'
  Gradually his eyes widened and his mask of a face twisted itself into a spasm
  of sudden anguish. 'I should have asked,' he continued in a voice barely
  under control, 'what haven't we here?' He looked about him sharply. 'Who
  brought me all these horrible objects?' he demanded. 'I want to know
  that.'</p>

  <p>'We did,' said several policemen proudly. 'There was a lot of us in
  it.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, there were,' resumed the magistrate, insanity simmering behind his
  words. 'Well, I see where I'll have to get me a new police force. The
  officers responsible for showing these obscenities to me might just as well
  turn in their badges and snip off their buttons.' He paused; then, leaning
  far over his desk, addressed himself bitterly to the unhappy policemen.
  'Why,' he exploded, 'the mere sight of them has driven all thought of sleep
  for ever from my mind. Was it your intention to kill me? Did you deliberately
  set out to break my health and shatter my reason? I sense a conspiracy here.
  You must have made them like that and then dragged them in to torture my
  eyes. Don't say a word. I'll find this out for myself.' He scanned the group
  of prisoners with his mad eyes. Suddenly his hand shot out, and he pointed a
  finger at Peter. 'You, there, in the shirt and vest. Don't lie to me now. How
  many degrees did these men put you through before they made you like that
  &mdash;or did they bribe you to do it?'</p>

  <p>'Can't I lie?' asked Peter.</p>

  <p>'Of course you can't lie,' said the magistrate. 'Did you intend to
  lie?'</p>

  <p>'I had thought of lying a little,' Peter admitted.</p>

  <p>'You had?' reflected Wagger. 'That's bad. But you're not going to lie now?
  Why not?'</p>

  <p>'I'm too darned scared,' said Peter. 'My brain isn't working.'</p>

  <p>'Mine is absolutely atrophied,' confided the grey-haired justice. 'Come,
  speak up&mdash;how did you get all naked?'</p>

  <p>'We ran away naked,' Peter told him.</p>

  <p>'What!' gasped the magistrate. 'What hideous crime had you committed to
  make you run away in the condition you are&mdash;you and your
  companions?'</p>

  <p>'They were playing all over an amusement park,' an officer put in here.
  'Steeplechase, it was.'</p>

  <p>'That's a lie,' snapped the red-headed girl in the raincoat. 'We were
  suffering all over an amusement park, your honor. Almost dying.'</p>

  <p>The magistrate looked for a long time at Jo. She had never encountered
  such concentrated vindictiveness.</p>

  <p>'When the conversation becomes general,' he said in a bitterly polite
  voice, 'we'll let you in, too. Maybe we'll all talk at once.' Suddenly his
  jaws snapped. 'Until then, hold your tongue.' Once more he turned to Peter.
  'What were you running away from?' he demanded.</p>

  <p>'From a lot of naked people,' said Peter.</p>

  <p>'Why should a person in your condition run away from others who, so far as
  I can see&mdash;and I can see much farther than I ever thought I'd be called
  upon to do from this bench&mdash;were no whit worse?'</p>

  <p>'If you were naked yourself,' asked Peter, 'wouldn't you run away from a
  lot of other naked people of mixed sexes?'</p>

  <p>The magistrate gulped, then placed a firm check on his indignation.</p>

  <p>'I'd crawl away,' he answered in a low voice, 'even as I would like to
  crawl away from you. But I don't care for the turn this talk is taking. Ask
  me no more nasty questions like that last one. Why, if you were running away,
  as you state&mdash;why, may I ask, did you and your friends stop to play on a
  lot of slides and things? Have you no concentration?'</p>

  <p>'We were looking for a place of concealment,' said Peter, only too keenly
  aware of the utter inadequacy of his statement.</p>

  <p>'And so you picked out one of the most popular amusement parks in the
  world,' the magistrate observed with a sneer in his voice, 'in which to hide
  your nakedness. Listen to me, young man. Even if I ask you questions in a
  moment of abstraction, don't answer them. I am trying to keep quite calm
  about all this, and you upset me.' He paused, cast his eyes over the group,
  and let them finally rest on the abashed pickpocket.</p>

  <p>'I don't want to talk to you,' the magistrate began, 'but I have to talk
  to some one. Please refrain from being trying, and do a little something
  about those drawers while I am forced to look at you.'</p>

  <p>Arthur picked up a corner of the raincoat that stood between Aspirin Liz
  and decency, and draped it over his shorts. The result was that much of Liz
  became exposed&mdash;too much. The magistrate closed his eyes and looked as
  if he were going to faint.</p>

  <p>'Make him put it back,' he muttered. 'My eyes are destroying my
  brain.'</p>

  <p>When the raincoat had been properly rearranged on Aspirin Liz, and the
  magistrate had gulped down a glass of water, he once more addressed himself
  to the cowering prisoner before him.</p>

  <p>Don't ever do that again,' scolded Magistrate Wagger. 'Not even if you
  think it amuses me. It doesn't. Now tell me who you are.'</p>

  <p>'I'm Little Arthur,' faltered the small crook.</p>

  <p>The magistrate blinked his surprise.</p>

  <p>'Little Arthur,' he repeated. 'Is that a proper name for a fully grown
  man? Do you hope to soften me by baby talk? Little Arthur!&mdash;just how
  much does that mean? Nothing! Suppose I should refer to myself as Little
  Wagger, or Little Alfred, which happens to be my first name&mdash;would you
  like it?'</p>

  <p>'I wouldn't mind,' replied Little Arthur.</p>

  <p>'You wouldn't, perhaps,' snapped the magistrate, 'but think of my friends
  and associates. Would they like it?'</p>

  <p>'I don't know none of yer friends, yer honor,' Little Arthur
  stammered.</p>

  <p>'Thank God for that, at any rate,' muttered Wagger, mopping his forehead
  with a large white handkerchief. 'Answer the question,' he roared suddenly.
  'Little Arthur what?'</p>

  <p>'Little Arthur Springtime,' answered the crook.</p>

  <p>'Springtime,' grated the magistrate. 'Why Little Arthur Springtime? Was
  that when you were born?'</p>

  <p>The other members of the detained party looked upon their companion with
  reawakened interest. They had never stopped to consider that he might have
  another name, especially such a lyrical one.</p>

  <p>'No, yer honor,' replied Arthur. 'I was born in the wintertime.'</p>

  <p>'Then why in God's good name did your mother call you Springtime?'
  demanded Wagger. 'All this is a sheer waste of energy and breath.'</p>

  <p>At this point Mr. Horace Sampson felt himself called upon to clear up the
  confusion.</p>

  <p>'Perhaps, Magistrate Wagger,' he said in his deep voice, 'perhaps the
  illiterate little beggar means that certain things happened in the springtime
  that made it possible for him to be born in the winter.'</p>

  <p>The magistrate eyed the philosopher darkly.</p>

  <p>'How do you mean?' he demanded. 'What things?'</p>

  <p>'The usual ones,' said Sampson.</p>

  <p>'Oh, that,' murmured the justice. 'My brain is quite addled. That would be
  it.'</p>

  <p>'You see, yer honor,' volunteered Little Arthur, 'the firehouse moved away
  and Mom never could tell which, although she knew it was one of 'em.'</p>

  <p>'What has a firehouse got to do with it,' asked the magistrate, 'and where
  did it move to?'</p>

  <p>'Don't know,' replied Arthur sadly. 'I wasn't born then.'</p>

  <p>'I wish you never had been,' rasped the magistrate, 'Do you mean to imply
  you're the results of an assault?' Little Arthur dropped his eyes.</p>

  <p>'I have been since, yer honor,' he said, 'but not then. The boys just used
  ter drop in social, like.'</p>

  <p>'Why, this is the most disgraceful story I ever heard,' exclaimed Wagger.
  'Why are you telling it to me?'</p>

  <p>'You kept asking me questions,' the crook answered simply.</p>

  <p>'Well, I won't ask you any more,' declared the magistrate. 'Decidedly not.
  I should think I'd go quite mad listening to all this. Can't see why I'm
  not.'</p>

  <p>'Not what?' asked Jo.</p>

  <p>'Not mad,' said the magistrate, not thinking.</p>

  <p>'Not mad at who?' asked Jo.</p>

  <p>'I'm not mad at anybody,' he retorted.</p>

  <p>'Aren't you mad at Little Arthur?' she continued.</p>

  <p>'Stop asking me questions,' he suddenly roared at the girl. 'I hate the
  very sight of Little Arthur. My God, I'm nervous. Any of you boys got an
  aspirin?'</p>

  <p>A clerk passed a box of aspirin tablets up to the magistrate. He tried to
  open the tin container, but somehow failed to manage it.</p>

  <p>'Can't do it,' he said hopelessly. 'Never can. Never have been able to.
  Why do they make them that way?'</p>

  <p>'Let me try,' offered Liz. 'I know how.'</p>

  <p>'It's irregular,' said the nervous man, 'but I must have a pill.'</p>

  <p>Deftly Liz opened the small tin container, removed a tablet, and passed
  the open box back to the magistrate. The tablet she placed under her tongue.
  Magistrate Wagger was following her movements with fascinated eyes.</p>

  <p>'Don't you take any water?' he asked her.</p>

  <p>'I like 'em better dry,' said Liz. 'Under my tongue.' Wagger looked
  slightly shocked.</p>

  <p>'I should think it would be uncomfortable,' he ventured. 'Can you talk all
  right? No impediment at all?'</p>

  <p>'You get sort of used to it,' she told him.</p>

  <p>'Well, I won't try now,' said the magistrate. 'But I will later.' He
  popped the tablet into his mouth, drained another glass of water, then glared
  hatefully at the Bishop.</p>

  <p>'You're old enough to know better than to be going round like that,' he
  said. 'Just drawers and a split shirt, and the drawers are coming down in my
  face. Yank 'em up!' The Bishop complied promptly, and the magistrate
  continued. 'That's better,' he said. 'And remember, if you don't care what
  you show, I care about what I look at. I'm very nervous now, and I want you
  to tell me exactly who you are. Don't try to say you're Little This or That,
  because I won't be able to stand it.'</p>

  <p>'My name is Waller,' replied the Bishop in his most impressive voice.
  'Bishop Waller.'</p>

  <p>'Is the first part a name or a title?' asked the magistrate. 'It
  designates the office I hold in the Episcopal Church,' said the Bishop
  calmly.</p>

  <p>Magistrate Wagger never knew how he overcame the confused, distorted
  impulses that beset him at that moment. From mahogany his face turned purple.
  His eyes grew and grew until they ached in his head. Several times he
  swallowed. Finally he spoke.</p>

  <p>'I don't believe you,' he said in a cracked voice. 'And you can't say I
  didn't give you a fair warning.' He turned to his clerk. 'When I come to
  sentencing this mob,' he said, 'remind me to tack on some extra time to this
  ruffian's term for attempting to hide behind the skirts of the Church.' He
  rested a pair of weary eyes on Liz.</p>

  <p>'Will you please show me what you are concealing beneath that raincoat?'
  he asked.</p>

  <p>'Not on your life,' said Liz. 'I knew the legal mind was accurate, but I
  didn't know it was nasty.'</p>

  <p>'Are you calling me nasty?' Wagger asked in a voice hushed by
  incredulity.</p>

  <p>'I was referring to the legal mind,' hedged Liz. 'Well, my mind is legal,'
  snapped the baited jurist. 'So is mine,' replied Liz. 'It's perfectly legal
  to have a mind, isn't it?'</p>

  <p>'It all depends on how you use it,' he told her. 'How did we get on this
  subject?'</p>

  <p>'I don't know,' said Liz.</p>

  <p>'Neither do I,' admitted the magistrate. 'I'm feeling terribly baffled by
  all these digressions. Will you tell what you have concealed under that
  raincoat if you won't let me see?'</p>

  <p>'Everything I've got,' said Liz, 'is underneath this raincoat.'</p>

  <p>'And what have you got?' asked the magistrate, not to be outwitted.</p>

  <p>'What would you expect?' the lady demanded. 'Fish scales, or
  feathers?'</p>

  <p>'How do you mean, feathers?' the magistrate stubbornly persisted. 'Or fish
  scales, for instance?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, God,' breathed Liz, casting her eyes to heaven. 'Take a look for
  yourself.'</p>

  <p>With this she threw open the raincoat, and the magistrate, after one dazed
  look, uttered a wild cry and collapsed on his desk. For a few moments there
  was confusion in the court, but Wagger did not care. At last he raised a
  stricken face and looked severely at Liz.</p>

  <p>'That was a terrible thing to do,' he told her. 'You nearly gave me a
  stroke.'</p>

  <p>'You were asking for it,' said Liz.</p>

  <p>'Perhaps,' he admitted fairly. 'But I never thought it was possible for a
  woman to be so&mdash;so much, if you get what I mean.'</p>

  <p>'Without any trouble at all,' she replied. 'You'd be surprised to know
  that once I had a very lovely figure.'</p>

  <p>'May I ask,' put in Horace Sampson, 'is this a trial or an informal
  gathering?'</p>

  <p>'You may not,' retorted the magistrate. 'Keep a civil tongue in your head.
  I've got enough on my hands.'</p>

  <p>'Enough what on your hands?' asked Jo.</p>

  <p>'I don't know,' said Wagger.</p>

  <p>'I understood you to say you had enough tongue on your hands,' persisted
  Jo.</p>

  <p>'My dear young woman,' the magistrate almost pleaded, 'how could I
  possibly have enough tongue on my hands?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, so you like tongue?'</p>

  <p>'I didn't say so.'</p>

  <p>'But,' protested the girl, 'you just asked me how you could ever possibly
  get enough tongue on your hands.'</p>

  <p>'I meant just tongue,' he explained. 'Not enough tongue. As a matter of
  fact, I'd hate to have tongue on my hands. Don't fancy the idea at all.'</p>

  <p>'How about a dog's tongue?' she asked him.</p>

  <p>'Whose dog?' he wanted to know. 'I have no dog.'</p>

  <p>'That's too bad,' said Jo. 'Well, then, the tongue of any dog you
  name.'</p>

  <p>'Good God!' cried the magistrate, suddenly realizing the lengths to which
  this girl had led him. 'Is this tongue discussion going to continue on
  indefinitely? I don't care if it's a dog's tongue or an elephant's tongue.
  Keep them off my hands.'</p>

  <p>'I'm not going to put tongue on your hands,' Josephine replied
  defensively. 'I was just asking.'</p>

  <p>'All right. All right,' Wagger said in a weary voice. Now let me ask you
  some questions. To begin with, how did you get that way?'</p>

  <p>'Well, your honor,' began Jo easily, 'it was like this. You see, there was
  a fog and &mdash;'</p>

  <p>'What fog?' interrupted the magistrate.</p>

  <p>Jo looked puzzled.</p>

  <p>'How do you mean, what fog?' she asked. 'You can't name a fog or bring
  along a sample.'</p>

  <p>'Where and when was this fog?' he demanded. 'All over,' said Jo. 'I forget
  just when.'</p>

  <p>Magistrate Wagger looked thoroughly disheartened.</p>

  <p>'Tell it your way,' he muttered. 'I won't believe you anyhow.'</p>

  <p>'And there were a lot of naked people, your honor,' the girl
  continued.</p>

  <p>'There still are,' he said moodily.</p>

  <p>'And these naked people,' went on the girl, 'took off all our
  clothes.'</p>

  <p>'Just where is the fog at this point?' asked Wagger, not caring whether
  she told him or not.</p>

  <p>'There isn't any fog any more,' she replied.</p>

  <p>'Then I don't see why you introduced the fog in the first place,' he
  answered. 'Are you trying to interest me in a dirty story, young lady?'</p>

  <p>'It isn't so dirty,' protested Jo. 'Just in spots, your honor.'</p>

  <p>Suddenly the magistrate's eyes dilated. He leaned far over his desk and
  fixed his wild bloodshot eyes on the middle section of Jo's raincoat.</p>

  <p>'Why are you doing that?' he asked in a hushed voice.</p>

  <p>'Doing what?' demanded Jo.</p>

  <p>'You must know what you're doing,' he replied.</p>

  <p>'Occasionally I don't,' she told him.</p>

  <p>'Why does your coat go like that?' demanded the magistrate. 'I insist on
  knowing.'</p>

  <p>Glancing down, Jo was interested to observe that from the appearance of
  her raincoat she had suddenly grown very fat. Jumping to conclusions, she
  looked reproachfully at Peter.</p>

  <p>'Peter,' she said, 'we'll have to make that wedding snappy. This looks
  like a rush order.'</p>

  <p>'It's not that,' he assured her. 'Your stomach is a little upset.'</p>

  <p>'Your coat,' said the judge, almost whispering. 'It thrusts itself out,
  then suddenly collapses. Are you doing it?'</p>

  <p>'No, sir,' replied Jo. 'I mean, yes.'</p>

  <p>'Then don't,' pleaded the magistrate.</p>

  <p>Jo gave Havelock Ellis a vicious squeeze, and the duck gave an equally
  vicious squawk. Magistrate Wagger looked startled, then peered searchingly at
  the prisoners before him.</p>

  <p>'Who made that offensive noise?' he wanted to know. 'It constitutes
  contempt of court. Come! Speak up!'</p>

  <p>'I'll readily agree,' rumbled the long silent philosopher, that the noise
  was both offensive and contemptible, but I assure you, sir, I wouldn't have
  made it if I could, which I greatly doubt.'</p>

  <p>'How you go on!' the magistrate complained. 'Who made that unusual noise?
  I want to know.' At this moment the squawk was repeated and Josephine's
  stomach gave a brisk outward lunge. Wagger's eyes were popping. He had partly
  risen from his chair. 'There it goes again,' he breathed. 'It went 'way out
  this time.' He sank back in his chair and once more mopped his forehead.
  'Young lady,' he resumed, 'are you deliberately making stomachs at me?'</p>

  <p>'Not deliberately,' answered Jo, finding it increasingly difficult to
  restrain the aroused Ellis. 'My stomach is just on its own. I have no control
  over it.'</p>

  <p>'I'll have no control over mine if this keeps up,' he assured her. 'That
  aspirin didn't do a bit of good. I ...' His voice died away in his chair.
  'For the love of God, what's that?' he cried, pointing at Josephine's
  stomach.</p>

  <p>Jo looked at her stomach, as did every one else within peering distance.
  Officers and court attendants moved a little away. Under the circumstances
  they were not to be blamed. Braver men than they have been unnerved by lesser
  sights. Protruding from the raincoat at Josephine's stomach was a long,
  purple, snake-like head which was looking fixedly at Magistrate Wagger out of
  two yellow, malevolent eyes. With her free hand Jo thrust the head of the
  duck back beneath the coat. The air was filled with squawks. Ellis was
  protesting in the worst language she knew how to use.</p>

  <p>'That,' said Jo at last feebly, somewhat confused herself,&mdash;'that was
  merely my handbag.'</p>

  <p>'Merely,' wheezed the haggard Wagger. 'Just a simple little handbag, eh
  &mdash;a mere trifle?' Then his indignation got the upper hand. 'Does a
  handbag hurl maledictions in a foreign tongue?' he thundered. 'Does a handbag
  peer at one out of fierce yellow eyes that look as if they had brooded on the
  flames of hell itself? Does a handbag have a long, death-dealing beak?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, sir,' cut in Jo. 'It's a novelty handbag&mdash;a funny one. I open
  the beak and put things in&mdash;small change and lipstick and all sorts of
  things.'</p>

  <p>'Do you mean to tell me,' demanded Wagger, 'that you actually open that
  beak?'</p>

  <p>'Why not?' Jo replied with a shrug.</p>

  <p>'Well, I wouldn't do it if they made me a justice of the Supreme Court,'
  he said decisively. For a moment or so he tapped nervously on his desk with
  his skinny fingers. 'Young lady,' he resumed, 'I don't believe that handbag
  story at all. I can't believe it. There was too much life and animation in
  what I saw&mdash;too much noise. Are you by any chance an unfortunate freak?
  That head seemed almost a part of you to me.'</p>

  <p>Not at all,' replied the girl. 'We are quite independent, I assure
  you.'</p>

  <p>It was at this point that Havelock Ellis took it into her head to prove
  the accuracy of Jo's words. She had been missing things too long, had the
  duck, Ellis. She would find out for herself what all this was about. With a
  vicious tug and a beating of wings, she burst Jo's coat asunder and with a
  wild cry of triumph fluttered to the magistrate's desk. But her cry was not
  nearly so wild as the one that tore itself from Wagger's throat as he
  abandoned the dignity of his office and sought safety behind his chair. Ellis
  made a vicious snap at the rear part of the departing man. Contact was
  established and Wagger's speed increased. After this gesture of contempt the
  duck settled down on the desk and remained perfectly still.</p>

  <p>It bit me,' chattered the magistrate. 'I'm poisoned, perhaps! What's it
  going to do next?'</p>

  <p>Maybe she'll lay an egg,' was Jo's calm reply. 'She'd done about
  everything else.'</p>

  <p>'Do you mean that duck would have the temerity to lay an egg on the desk
  of a city magistrate?' quavered the little man behind the chair.</p>

  <p>'She never has yet,' said Jo, 'but when that duck makes up her mind to lay
  an egg, I feel convinced she'd produce it on the desk of the mayor
  himself.'</p>

  <p>'Oh!' lamented the magistrate. 'Oh, dear, oh, dear! What a way for a girl
  to talk! What are we going to do? I won't touch that duck.' Suddenly he was
  stung by a new and fearful consideration. 'Lock all the doors,' he cried.
  'Don't let a reporter out. If this gets into the paper I'll never hear the
  end of it. "Duck Lays Egg on Magistrate Wagger's Desk"&mdash;I can see it
  already in headlines.' He looked at the demoralized policemen. 'If you boys
  will take that duck away, back go your badges and buttons,' he promised
  them.</p>

  <p>'That's my duck,' said Jo, sweeping the squatting bird from the desk.
  'I've had a lot of trouble with that duck. If she lays an egg, that's going
  to be mine, too.'</p>

  <p>'Keep both the duck and her egg,' screamed Wagger. 'Do you think I want
  them? I wish I could tell you what to do with the damn duck.'</p>

  <p>'I'm afraid you'd be asking too much, your honor,' Jo replied
  demurely.</p>

  <p>At this moment a reporter approached the magistrate and spoke rapidly to
  him in an undertone. Slowly the little man's face cleared.</p>

  <p>'You won't mention the duck?' he asked the reporter.</p>

  <p>'Not a word,' the other declared. 'We'll stick to the straight story.'</p>

  <p>'And how did you get the story?' Wagger wanted to know.</p>

  <p>'Why, if that gentleman in the drawers is Bishop Waller,' the reporter
  said, 'then naturally the people with him must be those who left the ferry in
  the fog.'</p>

  <p>'I wish they'd never been found,' Magistrate Wagger replied. 'I wish
  they'd been lost at sea for ever and for ever.'</p>

  <p>'I recognized Peter Van Dyck myself,' the reporter went on, 'in spite of
  his informal appearance.'</p>

  <p>'If you write a funny story about us,' Peter spoke up promptly, 'I'll call
  in a flock of reporters and tell about the duck and what the magistrate
  wanted the young lady to do with it.'</p>

  <p>'I didn't say it,' shouted Wagger. 'I only wished it.'</p>

  <p>'Then I'll tell the world what you wished she would do with the duck,'
  said Peter.</p>

  <p>'Don't do it, Mr. Van Dyck, I beg you,' the magistrate pleaded. 'This
  reporter is going to be nice. You be nice, too. That's a good chap.' For a
  moment the court-room was still as Wagger sat at his desk and brooded upon
  the many wrongs that had been done him. His indignation rose. He could
  contain it no longer. He spoke.</p>

  <p>'Are you Bishop Waller?' he asked in a voice of velvet gentleness.</p>

  <p>'I assured you I was,' said the Bishop.</p>

  <p>'A bishop of the Episcopal Church?' continued the magistrate.</p>

  <p>'I am, sir,' the Bishop replied.</p>

  <p>'Then I have made a slight mistake,' said Wagger, his voice still soft and
  sweet, 'and I hope you won't mind if I ask you to take your naked gang and
  get the hell out of my courtroom.'</p>

  <p>His voice ended in a snarl, and he sank back in his chair, his eyes
  tightly closed.</p>

  <p>'Have they gone?' he asked at length, pressing a hand to each temple.</p>

  <p>'They have, sir,' answered an officer.</p>

  <p>'Thank God for that,' muttered Wagger.</p>

  <p>They had gone. They were in a taxicab with the reporter headed for the
  Half-Moon Hotel. As they drove away from the court, an expensive-looking car
  of foreign make followed them down the street. The philosopher glanced
  through the window and studied the imposing tower of the hotel they were
  approaching. It was capped by a replica of the adventurous ship from which
  the hotel derived its name. Many windows looked out upon the sea from the
  mounting structure standing out picturesquely against the blue.</p>

  <p>'An altogether charming seaside caravansary,' murmured Mr. Sampson. 'I
  think we should do well there. It does justice to Hendrik Hudson.'</p>

  <p>'Who did he ever lick?' asked Little Arthur from his seat on the floor of
  the cab.</p>

  <p>'Oh, he just knocked about the river in a boat,' said Josephine.</p>

  <p>'A ferry captain,' concluded the hopeless dip. 'I don't want ter hear
  another word.'</p>

  <p>'He was a Dutchman,' put in Peter proudly.</p>

  <p>'I'd try to keep that quiet,' said Jo.</p>

  <p>Arrived at the 'Half-Moon,' the reporter considerately led them through
  the street entrance, which fortunately for the guests as well as themselves
  was a large secluded hall cut off from the lounge and lobby above. Here they
  were met by the manager, who, although warned over the telephone by the
  reporter, could not repress a look of astonishment when he gazed at his
  prospective guests.</p>

  <p>'We need a flock of rooms,' said Peter.</p>

  <p>'You need much more than that,' the manager replied with a gracious smile.
  'If you meet any of my guests in the hallways, I hope you won't mind if I ask
  you in a loud voice if you enjoyed the masquerade.'</p>

  <p>'My dear sir,' replied the Bishop, 'if you get us to our rooms you can ask
  us if we enjoyed the murder for all I care. Have you a pin, perhaps?'</p>

  <p>The manager had no pin, but promptly obtained one from the near-by beauty
  salon. The Bishop accepted it gratefully and did things to his jaegers. At
  this moment the lift door opened and several passengers stepped out.</p>

  <p>When they gazed upon the huddled party they almost stepped back again.</p>

  <p>'Did you enjoy the masquerade?' asked the manager in a loud false
  voice.</p>

  <p>'No!' cried Little Arthur. 'It was punk.'</p>

  <p>'Why, you low thief,' boomed the philosopher, 'you had the time of your
  life.'</p>

  <p>The people hurried on and the party hurried in. The dusky, good-looking
  girl responsible for the lift was responsible for it no longer. She uttered a
  frightened cry and turned her back on the worse than naked throng.</p>

  <p>'I should have warned her,' said the manager of the 'Half-Moon,'</p>

  <p>'She probably thinks you are ghosts.'</p>

  <p>'I feel like one,' declared Aspirin Liz.</p>

  <p>'You don't look like one,' said the manager.</p>

  <p>A chauffeur in splendid livery was hurrying towards the party. When he
  reached the elevator, he offered a large bundle to Peter.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Jones sends his compliments,' he said in a smooth voice. 'He hopes
  you enjoyed yourself in court as much as he did. He further hopes that you
  put on these clothes as speedily as possible. He himself will bring Miss
  Yolanda back to town shortly. He desires to meet her parents, and suggests
  great discretion be used on all sides.'</p>

  <p>The chauffeur paused and winked. Peter almost dropped the bundle. Quickly
  the uniformed man turned away.</p>

  <p>'You can tell Mr. Jones for me,' Little Arthur called after the rapidly
  retreating figure, 'that if I ever catch him wearing pockets I'll pick 'em
  clean as a hound's tooth.'</p>

  <p>'You missed your chance,' said Peter as the elevator shot skyward under
  the hand of the recovered operator. 'That was Mr. Jones.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="epi"
     name="epi">EPILOGUE&mdash;A FAREWELL TO DRAWERS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Bishop Waller, clad only in a towel, stood in the center of
  his newly acquired room at the 'Half-Moon.' A majestic figure, the Bishop,
  now that at last his jaegers were off. Bishop Waller was waiting for the
  hotel valet. On the bed lay an orderly row of garments but recently returned
  to him by the considerate but reprehensible Mr. Jones. In his heart the
  Bishop could not thoroughly disapprove of the man. Mr. Jones had his
  points.</p>

  <p>However, before the Bishop could don his rightful attire and mingle once
  more with his kind, he felt it essential to procure at all costs a new pair
  of jaegers, the extra pair having been left behind in his suitcase on the
  abandoned ferry. The old ones had served their purpose. They had outworn
  their usefulness. Yet Bishop Waller did not despise the abandoned jaegers.
  Far from it. He regarded them in the light of a religious relic. They
  deserved to be framed tastefully and hung in a church.</p>

  <p>'Jaegers Worn by Bishop Waller in Defiance of the Nudes,' or some other
  such terse, dignified explanation would do quite nicely, for, of course, the
  presence of those jaegers in a church would have to be explained.</p>

  <p>A knock sounded on the door.</p>

  <p>'Come in,' said Bishop Waller, an invitation he would not have extended in
  his present condition ten days ago. 'Can I be of any service?' the valet
  inquired.</p>

  <p>'Of invaluable service,' replied the Bishop, tossing the jaegers over the
  man's extended arm. 'Go out into the marts and highways of this city and see
  if you can match those.'</p>

  <p>The valet raised his eyebrows and considered the garment dangling from his
  arm a little more distastefully than the Bishop would have liked.</p>

  <p>'It will be difficult at this hour,' said the man, 'to match these er
  &mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Jaegers,' supplied the Bishop.</p>

  <p>'Exactly,' agreed the valet. 'But I think it can be done, sir. I know of
  one store that sells almost anything at any time of night. It's such an odd
  store, I'm sure they must have things like this.'</p>

  <p>'Excellent,' said the Bishop, 'save for the last sentence."</p>

  <p>Half an hour later the valet returned with a neatly tied package. Eagerly
  the Bishop opened it and extracted the garment within. The valet produced the
  odd pair from another package not nearly so neatly tied. In fact, it was in
  an old bag that the battered jaegers had been returned. Evidently the
  shopkeeper regarded them even more distastefully than did the valet. Bishop
  Waller let this pass.</p>

  <p>The valet held up the old pair while the Bishop held up the new. Together
  they compared the garments.</p>

  <p>'To a buttonhole,' cried the Bishop at last, beaming upon the valet.
  'Splendid work, my fine fellow. A perfect match to the last, least
  buttonhole. I would have said button, only there aren't any buttons on the
  old ones. I must have been a sight.'</p>

  <p>Aspirin Liz and Little Arthur had shifted into their respective drawers
  with precision and despatch. Little Arthur, as he got into his ancient pair,
  mutely promised the patron saint of all good pickpockets that he would never
  take them off again nor desire those of any other man. With Liz he had dined
  in regal splendor&mdash;far better than he had ever dined before&mdash;in the
  long, restful dining-room of the hotel. Soft music, together with a knowledge
  of his companion's alert scrutiny, had so conquered his spirit that he left
  the silver intact. After dinner they had strolled along the boardwalk for the
  sheer pleasure of experiencing the sensation of being fully clad in
  public.</p>

  <p>At the moment Liz was engaged in utterly demolishing Little Arthur. Seated
  in a tiny but apparently indestructible self-propelling vehicle, known as a
  Dodge-'em, she was pursuing him&mdash;likewise ensconced&mdash;round an
  enclosed surface presided over by a tolerantly benign Japanese. Every time
  she drove her midget motor into that of her light-fingered playfellow, her
  titanic laughter drifted far into the night. It tickled something savage and
  destructive in her soul to crash into Little Arthur and to shatter virtually
  every bone in his frail body.</p>

  <p>'It ain't fair,' screamed the small crook, purple in the face. 'You're
  carrying too much fat.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, dear,' sighed Liz weakly, tears streaming down her cheeks, 'this is
  more fun than a kettle of fish.'</p>

  <p>She pressed her foot on the pedal and launched herself into Arthur as if
  she would totally destroy him. There was the sound of a mighty impact, her
  victim's head jerked crazily backwards, his car twirled impotently across the
  floor, and Liz's wild laughter drew fresh spectators from the boardwalk.</p>

  <p>Never, decided the Japanese, had he had such a wholly satisfactory nest
  egg as Liz. She overflowed her car and gave the almost deserted floor the
  appearance of being crowded&mdash;of literally throbbing with gaiety and
  life. The lookers-on regarded her with wonderment and respect and Little
  Arthur with deep commiseration.</p>

  <p>Crashing, dodging, and steadily insulting each other, Aspirin Liz and
  Little Arthur spin dizzily from the page.</p>

  <p>In the quiet, gracious lounge of the hotel filled with comfortable divans
  and armchairs and generously supplied with ashtrays&mdash;a stroke of sheer
  genius&mdash;Mr. Horace Sampson was sitting with the reporter. Sampson was in
  the philosophical pink. He was wondering idly what the guests of the hotel
  would do if suddenly deprived of their drawers&mdash;everything, in fact. He
  was endeavoring to imagine the reactions of the various ladies and gentlemen
  under his observation. That old lady with the pearls round a high stiff
  collar would never survive the shock, whereas there were a couple of girls
  over there who after a little parleying might take to it like ducks to water.
  It was difficult to tell at a glance. He turned to the reporter seated in a
  chair beside him.</p>

  <p>'What do you think of drawers?' asked the philosopher.</p>

  <p>'Personally,' replied the reporter, 'I admire them less than any garment I
  wear&mdash;even less than my undershirt.'</p>

  <p>'Yet,' pursued the philosopher, 'if you had to choose between them, the
  drawers would win the day.'</p>

  <p>'Naturally,' retorted the reporter. 'An undershirt merely keeps one warm,
  whereas drawers keep one decent. A man looks less ridiculous in a pair of
  drawers than when he is clad only in an undershirt.'</p>

  <p>'I'm not convinced,' the philosopher replied thought-fully. 'Some drawers
  can be singularly ridiculous. For example, those worn by the good Bishop
  still amuse me even in retrospect.'</p>

  <p>'After your experience, Mr. Sampson,' inquired the reporter, 'what is your
  opinion of the nudist colony from which you escaped?'</p>

  <p>'Not high,' replied Sampson, 'but of this I am convinced; to endeavor to
  conquer the flesh is a profitless undertaking. Before a man or a woman can
  arrive at any degree of spiritual tranquillity, he or she must give flesh the
  rein. Whether one is clad in bare flesh or fur makes very little
  difference.'</p>

  <p>'How about the health angle?' asked the philosopher's companion.</p>

  <p>'Fiddlesticks!' he snapped. 'The benefits derived from mixed nudity are
  far offset by the mental agitation it entails. When men and women
  deliberately set out to attain a state of purity and so-called innocence,
  they are endeavoring to capture something that never existed. And if they did
  succeed, they would be greatly disappointed people. Purity, my friend, is
  simply an escape from the obligations one owes to one's own body as well as
  to others much more attractively fashioned.' The philosopher turned and
  considered the radio darkly. It was a splendid radio. A lonely little
  grey-haired man was clinging to it like a drowning man to a straw. 'Tell me,'
  resumed Mr. Sampson, 'what is that sick sound issuing from that box?'</p>

  <p>'That sound,' replied the reporter, 'is made nightly by one of the
  nation's most popular crooners.'</p>

  <p>For a moment the philosopher considered this in silence.</p>

  <p>'You see,' he said at last, 'how difficult it is for a man of my views to
  live in harmony with his fellow-men. To me that noise is more degrading to
  humanity, more destructive to the morale, more morally and spiritually
  enervating than strong drink and weak women&mdash;I mean by that,
  accommodating women.' He stretched his long legs and knocked the ashes from
  his pipe. 'The chap making that noise deserves no drawers at all,' he said,
  reflectively. 'He should be clad in scanties.'</p>

  <p>A full moon over the 'Half-Moon.' Its ship-crested tower mounted high
  above the boardwalk and looked far out to sea. Lights on the dark ocean
  moving along to Europe, to the tropics and distant ports. High up in this
  tower Jo and Peter were standing in the moonlight. And remarkable as it may
  seem, both of them were dressed. Probably not for long.</p>

  <p>'Are you going to keep this up indefinitely?' asked Peter. 'You have a
  room of your own.'</p>

  <p>She disregarded his question, knowing he did not mean it.</p>

  <p>'I had hoped,' she said, 'that Bishop Waller would marry us in his
  jaegers.'</p>

  <p>'And what would we be wearing?' he inquired.</p>

  <p>'Simply ourselves,' said Jo.</p>

  <p>'All marriages should be made that way,' Peter observed surprisingly. 'It
  would save a lot of time.'</p>

  <p>'I'm afraid there'd be fewer marriages,' said Jo, 'if couples undressed
  first.'</p>

  <p>'Not at all,' retorted Peter. 'Many a plain face surmounts a lovely body.
  And you must remember, Jo, the latter is very important.'</p>

  <p>'I never forget,' breathed Jo.</p>

  <p>'To-morrow the Bishop will marry us,' he continued. 'Aspirin Liz and
  Little Arthur will be the worst man and woman. I have decided to take them
  into my employment. You will be engaged in the capacity of wife.'</p>

  <p>'No longer your concubine,' Jo said somewhat sadly. 'I'll sort of miss
  that. It's been so good being bad.'</p>

  <p>She turned away from the window and went into her room. It adjoined
  Peter's, and the door to it had been locked when they had first arrived. Not
  wishing to disturb any one, Peter had bribed Little Arthur to pick it.</p>

  <p>'It's the most shameful thing I've ever done,' the little crook had
  protested. 'I feel like a white-slaver.'</p>

  <p>A ten-dollar bill had done much to make him forget this unpleasant
  feeling. Before he had left the room he had convinced his dishonest little
  mind that he was a public benefactor.</p>

  <p>'I guess it's better this way after all,' he had admitted as he pocketed
  the money. 'It will keep you from running up and down the halls, so people
  can get some sleep and you can keep yer shame to yourselves.'</p>

  <p>'Peter,' Jo called from the next room, 'do you like my body?'</p>

  <p>'Sure,' replied Peter. 'I think it's just great.'</p>

  <p>'Then I'll tell you what let's do,' she went on. 'You take off your
  clothes and I'll take off mine and we'll play matching bruises. I got a lot
  in that park.'</p>

  <p>'I have so many they're merging,' Peter informed her, turning from the
  window. 'How is Ellis?'</p>

  <p>'She's gone to sleep in the bathtub as happy as a lark.'</p>

  <p>'If Sampson were present he'd want to know how a duck can be as happy as a
  totally different make of bird,' observed Peter.</p>

  <p>'I'm glad he's not here,' said Jo. 'Wonder if Ellis is the first duck ever
  to have occupied a bathtub at the "Half-Moon."'</p>

  <p>'I guess we will never know that,' said Peter, taking off his shoes.</p>

  <p>And in a little while Josephine and Peter were matching the various
  bruises they had collected during the sound and fury of their flight. They
  were almost like little children about it, but...not quite.</p>
