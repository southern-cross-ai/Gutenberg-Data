  <h2><a name="ch-00a"
     id="ch-00a"></a>FOREWORD</h2>

  <p class="first">CIRCUMSTANCES, the nature of which I am not at liberty to
  disclose, have recently released me from a promise to keep the following
  curious documents secret until the death of certain individuals named
  therein.</p>

  <p>I nevertheless give them to the world with a great deal of hesitation
  since their publication will be certain to cast upon their authors doubt of
  their veracity, or their sanity. With this in mind, I have endeavored to
  substantiate the narratives, in so far as possible, by affidavits of
  disinterested witnesses, which I transmit herewith.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately the greater part of the report of Hugh Lambert cannot
  <i>ipso facto</i> be thus supported, and I can only rest his case for
  credence on his reputation as a paleontologist and archaeologist of eminence,
  and on my own simple statement that I believe utterly and absolutely in the
  truth of his statements.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-00b"
     id="ch-00b"></a>PROLOGUE</h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="cp"><em>Extract from the diary of Ann Doring, screen actress,
  August 15, 1934</em></p><br>

  <p class="first">IT is really the morning of the sixteenth, but this is the
  first chance I have had to get my diary up to date. Though it's going to take
  simply hours to write down everything, I'm going to do it, because I don't
  want to forget the least little bit of what has happened.</p>

  <p>Was yesterday a day!</p>

  <p>It began, calmly enough, with my driving alone from New York to visit Dick
  at Camp Wanooka, high in the Helderbergs. It ended with me in a doctor's
  waiting room, somewhere in the outskirts of Albany, biting my nails and
  wondering whether the man I love would live through the night.</p>

  <p>The man I love. It still seems queer to write that. Yesterday afternoon
  Hugh Lambert was only a name to me, and not an important one at that. By
  midnight I knew that if he died life would have no meaning for me any
  more.</p>

  <p>It was Dick's fault in the first place. That kid brother of mine wasn't
  satisfied with my paying a thousand dollars for his summer at the ritziest
  boys camp in the East; he insisted on my coming up here for him to show me
  off. The brat knew how to wangle me into it, too. About his second or third
  letter he started raving about the camp director. This Hugh Lambert had
  everything. Looks. Strength. Personality. Not only had he been all-American
  halfback in '26, but he'd explored half the blank spaces on the map since
  graduating from Dartmouth. He was managing the camp this summer only to get
  funds for another expedition to Cambodia or Patagonia or some place like
  that.</p>

  <p>The camp, Dick wrote, was overrun every weekend with the year's most
  glamorous debs, but Lambert didn't give any sign he knew they existed, though
  he was the cause of their sudden access of sisterly and cousinly
  affection.</p>

  <p>Leave it to these sophisticated youngsters to get on to that. And they did
  more than gossip about it. When Dick learned I was making a flying trip to
  New York between pictures he wired me that he was on the long end of a bet
  Lambert would break down before the end of the summer, and that he had as
  good as lost. He begged me as a pal to rush up and save him from going about
  in rags and tatters all winter.</p>

  <p>Now I ask you.</p>

  <p>Well, I got to camp just about supper-time. I found Dick brown as a berry,
  and grown till he was half a head taller than I. I don't think I would have
  known him if he hadn't pounced on me, yelling like a Comanche.</p>

  <p>After the family greeting was over, the young nut didn't even give me a
  chance to fix up my face but dragged me into the mess hall and right up to
  the head table where that paragon of his was waiting for the kids to settle
  down.</p>

  <p>I'll swear Hugh Lambert never knew whether the boys ever did get to their
  places. He took one look at me and he was sunk. Maybe I didn't think that was
  a compliment, too. Not because of the brother's build-up, either.</p>

  <p>That chap knows his women, or I don't know my men. He hasn't got that
  cleft in his chin, and that slow, crinkly smile around his grey quiet eyes
  for nothing. I knew, right away, that the reason he hadn't fallen for the
  society girls was because they just didn't stack up against the other women
  in his life, the exotic ones on the other side of nowhere.</p>

  <p>I was rather in a daze myself, which was something new for me. The tops
  among the Hollywood glamour boys have made a play for me without raising my
  blood pressure two points but Hugh Lambert is different.</p>

  <p>He's big. I don't mean physically, though he's that,
  too&mdash;wide-shouldered and narrow-waisted; his skin a slinky bronze sheath
  for flat, slithery muscles. But there's the bigness of all outdoors in him,
  and a deep, deep strength that comes from matching oneself against savage
  nature and overcoming it.</p>

  <p>Against savage men, too. His blunt chin and one bony cheek are creased by
  a white scar, Dick tells me was made by a Galla <i>assegai</i>.</p><br>

  <p class="first">WELL, it was Ann and Hugh right away, as if we'd known each
  other forever, but what we said didn't mean anything, because there were
  others at the table. The head councillor, Ed Hard; a couple of other men
  whose names I didn't catch; and the freckle faced, pug-nosed camp nurse,
  Edith Horne.</p>

  <p>After supper Hugh excused himself. Dick begged me to go to some kind of
  entertainment in the recreation hall, but I made him carry my bags to my room
  in the guest house, where he chattered till I chased him out so I could wash
  up and change to that blue knitted sport suit I had Schiaparelli send over on
  the <i>Normandie</i>. I had a date, you see, to meet Hugh down by the lake
  after the kids were tucked away for the night.</p>

  <p>He was there before me. A bugle sobbed taps behind us, and then the quiet
  settled around us. Not silence. There was the lapping of the water at our
  feet, the trees whispering to a gentle breeze, the almost rhythmic shrill of
  a million crickets, but it was all hushed and dreamy, and somehow
  melancholy.</p>

  <p>Lake Wanooka lies deep in a cup of high, wooded hills whose dark bulk shut
  it in last night, so that although Albany is only an hour away, civilization
  seemed as distant as the stars that dusted the soft glow of the sky.</p>

  <p>The moon was a great golden half-globe, hammocked in a black fold on the
  mountains crest. The shimmering silver film spread over the quiet waters was
  like limpid music magically visible, and all that nostalgic beauty was just
  for the two of us. There was no one else in the world.</p>

  <p>Hugh's voice, when at last he spoke, was a deep, throaty murmur. "They've
  waited for us since the beginning of Time, the Old Mountains and the ancient
  lake!"</p>

  <p>"The Old Mountains. The Helderbergs." Some imp of the perverse made me
  matter-of-fact. "Why did the Dutch call them that?"</p>

  <p>"Because they are old, the oldest mountains in America next to the
  Laurentides."</p>

  <p>"And the lake?"</p>

  <p>"The lake is almost as ancient. It has neither inlet nor outlet, and its
  bottom has never been plumbed. The geologists say that as the Great Glacier
  melted, its waters filled an immensely deep valley here. Fifty thousand years
  ago, that was."</p>

  <p>"Fifty thousand years," I repeated, feeling creepy and insignificant as I
  matched that against the sixty or seventy years I might expect to exist.</p>

  <p>"It's a long time Lake Wanooka has been waiting for us to come together on
  her shore." Hugh's arm crept around my waist. "Five hundred centuries, Ann
  dear."</p>

  <p>He was a fast worker, I thought. Too fast. I'd better put the brakes
  on.</p>

  <p>"Who lived here before the ice melted," I said, laughing. "The
  Eskimos?"</p>

  <p>"No one," he answered. "No human existed in this region until long after
  the Ice Age."*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Editor's note: Mr. Lambert's statement agrees with the
  findings published in <i>Bulletin 33</i>, Smithsonian Institute, bureau of
  Ethnology, q.v. But cf. <i>Races of Man</i>, J. Deniker, pp, 510, 511, where
  are mentioned certain eoliths and early paleoliths as dating back before the
  end of the Pleistocene.]</p>

  <p>Just then the echo of my laugh came back from across the glimmering lake.
  It must have been an echo, but I had an eerie feeling that it was the
  mountain itself that laughed.</p>

  <p>Hugh must have noticed the little shudder that ran through me, because he
  shrugged me closer to him and asked, very tenderly, "Cold, Ann?"</p>

  <p>"Not any more," I managed, my heart beating against my ribs wildly.
  "Not..."</p>

  <p>His body was suddenly rigid against mine, and I knew he wasn't listening
  to me. He was staring at the lake, his brow furrowing.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;" I gasped. "What's the matter?"</p>

  <p>"It's there again." Hugh wasn't answering me; he was thinking aloud.
  "Queer. Damn queer."</p>

  <p>I followed the direction of his eyes. About a hundred feet from the lake's
  far end there was a disk of greater luminosity on the water; for all the
  world as if a searchlight were shining up through it from far below. Within
  the circumference of that pale glow, the surface was strangely smooth,
  glistening like silk stretched tight over an embroidery hoop.</p>

  <p>"It is queer," I whispered, not knowing why I whispered. "I never saw
  anything like it before."</p>

  <p>Just then a tiny black spot marred the silver shimmer, not <i>in</i> but
  right next to the strange radiance. From where it had been (it was gone at
  once) something darted toward the shore, an invisible something one was aware
  of only by the long narrow triangle of its wake creasing the water.</p>

  <p>Hugh gulped, swallowed.</p>

  <p>I whispered. "What makes that light?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he said slowly. He shook himself; and then he was looking
  down at me, and his tender smile was crinkling the corners of his eyes,
  making me warm again, warm all over.</p>

  <p>"What does it matter what it is? We're together, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A twig snapped, in the woods behind us! Hugh whirled around to stare into
  the shadows where the moonlight was shut out by the thick foliage. I was
  terribly frightened. Then I wasn't frightened any more but mad. I'd heard a
  boyish giggle in there, and the hiss of a whisper, quickly hushed.</p>

  <p>"Some of those darn kids, prowling around," Hugh growled. "If I get hold
  of them..."</p>

  <p>"Oh, what's the difference?" My hand on his arm kept him from diving into
  the brush, as he was about to do. "Let them have their fun. Come on, we'll go
  for a ride in my car." I had to stop him. I didn't want him to catch Dickie,
  though my brother'd hear plenty from me tomorrow.</p>

  <p>Of course it was Dick&mdash;I'd know that giggle anywhere&mdash;and
  probably the kid with whom he had bet. The merry brats had been spying on us
  to see who'd win.</p>

  <p>"Fine." Hugh responded to my suggestion. "Come on."</p>

  <p>Then he had my arm and we were running up the long campus hill to the
  little plateau where the camp buildings clustered.</p><br>

  <p class="first">AS WE were getting near the gate where I had parked my
  roadster, I asked him a question, the reply to which still has me
  wondering.</p>

  <p>"Why should a fish breaking water and swimming towards shore startle you,
  Hugh?"</p>

  <p>"It shouldn't," he replied. "Except that there <i>are</i> no fish in Lake
  Wanooka."</p>

  <p>Hugh insisted on driving. I got in alongside, him and we started off. The
  little clearing around the camp entrance was bright under the moon, but when
  we had crossed that the road dived into the woods, and we were in
  darkness.</p>

  <p>I heard Hugh's hand fumble at the dashboard, and a click. The headlights
  didn't come on.</p>

  <p>"Oh," I exclaimed. "The bulbs both went last night. I meant to buy new
  ones on the way up here but I forgot. Now we won't be able to have our ride."
  I was almost crying with disappointment.</p>

  <p>He must have noticed that, for he said, "Yes, we will. I know this trail
  so well I can drive it blindfolded, and when we get to the main highway we'll
  get some bulbs."</p>

  <p>The road was so narrow the tree boughs met overhead and the underbrush
  scraped along both sides of the car. After it got around the spur of the hill
  it pitched steeply downward. I realized how confidently Hugh drove, and then
  I was rather glad it was so dark. It brought back that feeling of there being
  just the two of us, and no-one and nothing else in all the world.</p>

  <p>After a while the road was smoother. Hugh started going faster. I saw,
  just ahead, the paleness of the concrete highway. It came swiftly toward
  us&mdash;and was blotched out by the black shape of a man who lurched out of
  the brush right in front of the roadster.</p>

  <p>There was a deep ditch on our left, a telegraph pole on our right. Hugh
  shouted. His right arm shoved me down in the seat as his left twisted the
  wheel. There was an awful crash, the smash of splintering glass, a scream. I
  just had time to think, "We've hit the pole; but we've hit the man too," when
  the roadster careened over, flinging me out of it.</p>

  <p>Half stunned, I shoved my hands against dirt, pushing myself up. I saw
  Hugh lying terribly still in the road. I saw his leg plainly in the
  moonlight. A dark pool was spreading around it, and a stream was feeding that
  pool, a stream of blood that spurted from his leg, where glass from the
  windshield had gashed it!</p>

  <p class="footnote">[Editor's note: In dealing with this material I shall take no
  liberties with the actual text but will cut and arrange it so as to present
  its narrative in a coherent, chronological order. In pursuance of this policy
  I here omit the balance of Miss Doring's entry and present the following
  letter. &mdash; A. L. Z.]</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="cp"><em>Letter from Jethro Parker, farmer</em></p><br>

  <p class="letter">Dear Mr. Zagat:</p>

  <p class="letter">I have just come home from the Grange meeting and Martha
  had told me you'd been here and she promised you I would write down what
  happened the night of August 15th two years ago. I would rather plow fifty
  acres than do this chore, but Martha will not let me send back the ten
  ($10) you left to pay me for my trouble so I guess I will have to.</p>

  <p class="letter">Nurse Horne from Camp Wanooka was here that night to
  massage Martha's leg for the rheumatics and we were in the kitchen having a
  snack when all of a sudden there was a thundering big crash from way up the
  road. Miss Horne and I jumped up and ran across my corn lot to where the
  noise came from.</p>

  <p class="letter">We got near where the camp road comes out on the highway
  and I saw a car on its side, crumpled up against the telegraph pole that's
  there. I heard a kind of moan and then I saw a girl in the dirt.</p>

  <p class="letter">She was on her knees and she was holding on to a man's leg
  with both hands. Blood, was spraying up between her fingers like it was a
  busted water pipe she was holding on to. I could not figure out to this day
  how she had the gumption to do that, specially shaken up as she was and maybe
  bad hurt for all she knew.</p>

  <p class="letter">Well, Miss Horne got right down on her knees alongside the
  girl and first thing I knew she was tearing a piece from her dress and tied
  it around the man's leg.</p>

  <p class="letter">I helped the girl stand up and I see that she is not hurt
  bad. Her dress is all torn and bloody; but she was the prettiest female I
  ever saw.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Get a car," she said. "Quick. We've got to get them to a
  hospital."</p>

  <p class="letter">I had not seen no one else. "Them?" I asks, puzzled
  like.</p>

  <p class="letter">She pointed into the dark farther back. I made out what I
  thought was a big bundle of rags. It heaved a little and I saw it was a tramp
  lying there. Except for his arm moving just a little bit I would have thought
  he was dead, the rest of him was so still.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Hurry, Jethro," Nurse Horne said.</p>

  <p class="letter">I ran back through the corn lot to my barn, cranked up my
  flivver and drove back to the crossroads. When I got there the girl was
  helping the man with the hurt leg to sit up, and I saw it was Mr. Lambert
  from Camp Wanooka. Miss Horne was busy over the tramp. I could not see what
  she was doing because the thick trees made it so dark back there.</p>

  <p class="letter">Well, sir, between the three of us we made out to get both
  the hurt men in the back of the flivver. The nurse got in back with them and
  the other girl got in alongside of me and I started off down the mountain. I
  heard Mr. Lambert say, "Where are we going?" and I heard Miss Horne answer
  him, "To the Albany Hospital."</p>

  <p class="letter">Mr. Lambert said, "If you take me there they will keep me
  for weeks and I must get back to camp. How about Doc Stone? You used to work
  for him. Don't you think he can take care of us at his house?"</p>

  <p class="letter">"I guess so," Nurse Horne answered. "He has all the
  equipment and it is lots nearer too. Jethro, it is the big white house on New

  <p class="cp"><em>Account of Courtney Stone, M.D., Surg.D., F.A.C.S.:<br>
  Chief Surgeon Albany Post-Graduate Hospital, etc., etc.:</em></p><br>

  <p class="first">AT about eleven P.M. on August 15, 1934, I was in my study,
  too tired to retire. I had that afternoon performed nine operations at the
  hospital, including the excision of a cerebral carcinoma of which I was a
  little proud; and had attended a joint consultation by the medical and
  surgical staffs that had gone on and on, endlessly.</p>

  <p>Two days before, a patient in coma had been brought in from the Helderberg
  region. The routine tests had revealed no pathologic malfunction, no trauma
  sufficient to explain his condition; nor did his symptoms correspond to any
  known disease. In a manner of speaking there were no symptoms except the
  stupor and, so gradual that it was almost imperceptible, a fading away of
  vitality that unless checked must inevitably result fatally.</p>

  <p>Although surgical intervention was by no means indicated I had been
  intrigued by the puzzle this case presented and was pondering it when my
  meditations were interrupted by the furious tingling of my doorbell. I waited
  an instant for Mrs. Small, my housekeeper, to answer it, recalled that I had
  given her the night off and shoved myself unwillingly out of my chair.</p>

  <p>A nervous, hysterical quality in the bell's pealing told me that the late
  caller was in search of my professional services. My practice has long ago
  reached the point where night calls are merely a matter for resentment, and I
  was prepared to send the fellow to young Adams, down the road, with a flea in
  his ear.</p>

  <p>I changed my mind however when, opening the door with one hand as I
  clicked on the hall light with the other, I looked straight into Hugh
  Lambert's face, pallid and dirt-streaked. He was palpably in a state of
  collapse and would have fallen if he had not been supported on one side by
  Edith Horne, the nurse I had recommended for his camp, and on the other by a
  second girl whom I perceived only vaguely.</p>

  <p>It was she who had been ringing. "We've had an awful accident," she
  blurted. "Hugh's terribly hurt."</p>

  <p>"Slashed artery, Doctor Stone," Edith interposed, "in the left leg. He's
  lost a lot of blood."</p>

  <p>"Get him into surgery and I'll get right to work. I'm glad you brought him
  to me instead of the hospital." That was quite true. Anthony Wagner,
  Wanooka's millionaire owner, is also a financial mainstay of the hospital and
  so the medical supervision of the camp has devolved upon me. I visit it
  frequently. Despite the disparity of our ages I have grown extremely fond of
  Hugh and I should not have wanted some half-baked intern messing around with
  him. "Here, let me help you."</p>

  <p>"I can...hop...along," Hugh muttered between set teeth. "Help...
  other&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's all right," a nasal twang came from the porch. "I carried him this
  far an' I can manage to get him the rest of the way." As the others shuffled
  past me, a gangling gaunt-visaged man in overalls shoved in through the door,
  his arms cradling a dark form whose limbs dangled flaccidly. I realized that
  I had another patient.</p>

  <p>"Come on in. You know the way."</p>

  <p>I had recognized Jethro Parker, a farmer who the winter before had once or
  twice accompanied a friend here. He grunted acquiescence and I turned to go
  through the entrance hall to the rear of the house.</p>

  <p>"Get Hugh on the examining table, Edith," I called. The nurse elbowed a
  tumbler switch beside the surgery door and the white blaze of the white-tiled
  room silhouetted the slowly moving trio. Hugh's legs caved in. I saw that at
  the last minute he'd lost consciousness and I sprang to aid the girls.</p>

  <p>Parker choked out an exclamation behind me, but I paid no attention other
  than to throw over my shoulder a direction for him to lay his charge on a
  leather-covered couch nearby...Lambert's left trouser leg was a gory sponge.
  The cloth was slashed and the flesh beneath it deeply gashed, so that the
  anterior tibial artery was laid open for two inches as neatly as though it
  had been done with a scalpel.</p>

  <p>The lacerated vessel should have been literally fountaining blood, but
  there was only a slight seepage. I looked for the explanation, disentangled
  from the sopping jumble of cloth above it a tight bandage of once white
  fabric, that had been knotted over the gastrocnemius to make a crude
  tourniquet, so expertly applied I knew it was Edith's work.</p>

  <p>"Will he be all right, doctor?" the other girl asked, behind me. "Will he
  live?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," I answered with the gruff curtness I have found to be more
  reassuring to jittery relatives and friends than a gentler manner. "You can't
  kill a bull like this with a scratch." But I wasn't as confident as I made
  myself sound. His exsanguinated pallor told me that Hugh had spilled a devil
  of a lot of blood. "Just go out in the waiting room, please, and make
  yourself comfortable while we take care of him." I felt Hugh's pulse. It was
  damned feeble and twice too rapid.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Parker," I continued, "you've been here before. Please show the
  lady." <i>Sotto voce</i> to Edith I murmured, "First thing is to sterilize
  and suture that artery. Prepare what I'll need while I take a look at the
  other one. You know where everything is, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, doctor," she answered, crisply; though she was whiter around the
  gills than a nurse of her experience should be even with her patient as bad a
  mess as Lambert. "I haven't forgotten."</p><br>

  <p class="first">SHE moved away and I straightened to examine the other case.
  Parker was between us. He had slumped into a chair, his head buried in his
  knotted hands. "Now, now, man," I rebuked him. "You ought to be able to stand
  the sight of a little blood."</p>

  <p>He looked at me, his weather-beaten face greenish under its stubble. "It
  ain't that." His pupils were dilated, his tone a half-whisper of almost
  religious awe. "It's not the blood." He swallowed with perceptible effort.
  "It&mdash;Doc! do you&mdash;Could a man come to life after being drowned six
  months? Changed, maybe?"</p>

  <p>"Nonsense," I snorted. "What on earth gave you such an idea as that?"</p>

  <p>His head turned, slowly, reluctantly, to the figure on the couch. "When I
  came into the light I saw his face and&mdash;" A sigh as if of relief, cut
  his sentence short. "No," he resumed. "I guess I was wrong. He's just a
  tramp. I guess I was just kind of kerflumoxed with all the excitement."</p>

  <p>"I guess you were;" I said dryly. "Look. The third bottle on the bottom
  shelf over there is whisky. Pour yourself a jolt. That's the best medicine
  for what ails you." I had no time for the vagaries of superstitious
  rustics.</p>

  <p>"May I have some too?" a clear bell-like voice asked wistfully. "I rather
  imagine I could use it."</p>

  <p>"Of course." I really saw the other girl then for the first time.
  Disheveled and disarrayed as she was, she was something worth seeing.</p>

  <p>She was tall, but she carried that tallness with a singularly graceful
  poise, and there was singing rhythm to every line of her body. Ordinarily the
  harsh glare of my floodlight is cruel to feminine charm, but it merely
  emphasized the pearly sheen of her skin, the delicate modeling of her
  features. I found myself pensively wishing that I was not short and rotund,
  that there were no gray hairs in my Vandyke.</p>

  <p>"You were in that accident, too. Are you hurt?"</p>

  <p>"Just shaken up a little." She smiled briefly. "And bruised. Nothing to
  take you away from poor Hugh."</p>

  <p>"Don't be too sure, Ann Doring." I knew her at once. "I'll look you over
  later. Meantime, if you'd like to clean up you'll find everything you need at
  the head of the stairs."</p>

  <p>"Thank you. I'll take advantage of your kindness. But first, my
  drink."</p>

  <p>"It's all poured out, miss," Parker said from across the room. "I've
  hidden mine an' I'll be running along. Marthy will be worrying about what
  become of me."</p>

  <p>Miss Doring downed her drink and followed him out of the room. I turned to
  look at the tramp.</p>

  <p>"I've cut his shirt and coat away," Edith Horne said as I came around. "So
  you won't have to bother with that." Competent as all get-out, that young
  lady. I don't know a better nurse. I had hated to send her up to the lake,
  but she'd earned a vacation through a busy winter, and besides she was just
  right for the job. Strictly business and no feminine nonsense. "His clothes
  are so old they're moldy and rotted."</p>

  <p>"Third and fourth ventral, ribs caved in," I diagnosed aloud as I stepped
  toward the couch. "Look like they're driven into the lungs." But they
  couldn't be&mdash;I frowned. The fellow would be dead or writhing in agony if
  they were. He wouldn't be watching me with a curious detachment out of eyes
  as expressionless and blackly glinting as camera lenses.</p>

  <p>His torso was of that distinctive gray whiteness one associates with long
  defunct corpses, and entirely aside from the costal depression on which I
  based my superficial diagnosis there was something grotesque about it. The
  word is rather melodramatic, but it fits the gross, lumpy malformation of
  that body.</p>

  <p>Perhaps I may more clearly convey his appearance by saying he looked as if
  some child had thumbed out of putty an inept, three-dimensional caricature of
  a human form.</p>

  <p>His flesh was clammy under my probing hands, and peculiarly soggy, evoking
  from the mists of the long years a recollection of student days and my first
  formaldehyde-pickled cadaver; I had been right! The bones beneath were
  free-floating, torn from their anchorage. The man's stoicism was remarkable.
  He should have shrieked under the pressure I applied, but he did not make a
  sound. I glanced at his face, wondering if he had fainted.</p>

  <p>I knew that face. Or rather, I knew the one it had been ineptly molded to
  resemble.</p>

  <p>The card file in my mind presented the appropriate memo:</p><br>

  <p class="note">NAME: Elijah Fenton.<br>
  DIAGNOSIS: Fibrous tumor, right side of neck.<br>
  TREATMENT: Excision of growth.<br>
  RESULT: Successful.<br>
  POST-OPERATIVE CARE: Weekly dressings, discontinued because patient drowned,
  12/11/33.</p><br>

  <p>I laughed shortly. Was I as credulous as Jethro Parker, letting a chance
  resemblance suggest impossible things? This could not be Fenton. Fenton had
  been drowned last winter in the tragedy at which all Albany shuddered.</p>

  <p>A feathery chill brushed my spine. There, from clavicle to point of the
  right mandible, <i>was the healed scar of the incision my own scalpel had
  made</i>!</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="cp"><em>Dr. Courtney Stone's account, continued:</em></p><br>

  <p class="first">I CONFESS that for a brief moment I was jolted out of the
  scientific attitude and almost believed that lying before me was a
  <i>revenant</i>, somehow returned to life after being nine months dead. Then
  I saw that what I had taken for a scar was merely a groove across the tramp's
  neck. To continue the simile I have used before, if the fellow had been
  sculptured from putty the awkward artist might have used Elijah Fenton as a
  model and attempted to reproduce the result of his operation along with the
  rest.</p>

  <p>It was coincidence pure and simple, of course. If the investigators of
  so-called psychic phenomena would remember the frequency of such accidental
  duplications they would not make such fools of themselves.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless I was grateful for the interruption of Miss Horne's steady,
  "Mr. Lambert's wound is still seeping and I'm ready for you. Would you want
  to take care of him first?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I'd better. He can't stand the loss of much more blood." She was
  waiting for me with operating gown and sterile gloves as I turned. "Think you
  can take an X-ray of this fellow's chest without help?" Artery clamps,
  sterile sponges, cat-gut-threaded needles were laid out on a towel-covered
  instrument stand next to the examining table. "I'll have to see what's inside
  him before I can do any thing."</p>

  <p>"Of course." There was no hesitation in her reply. "I'll wheel in the
  portable machine and have the picture ready for you by the time you're
  through with Mr. Lambert."</p>

  <p>The artery wall was cleanly cut, the tissue firm, holding the suture
  without tearing.</p>

  <p>The care with which Hugh Lambert always kept himself in condition paid him
  dividends now. Sewing him up, I heard the rumble of the portable X-ray
  machine behind me, the <i>click-click</i> of the exposure and, as I finished,
  Nurse Horne was beside me, handing me the bandage and tape I required.</p>

  <p>"The plate's in the developing bath, doctor," she said. "Are you going to
  give Mr. Lambert a shot of tetanus antitoxin?"</p>

  <p>I felt Hugh's pulse again. It was dangerously feeble. "No. I don't think
  he could take it without the shock putting him out. He seems pretty weak. Get
  me a blood-count on him. On the tramp, too, while you're about it. I'll get
  to the darkroom meanwhile and take a squint at the Roentgenograph."</p>

  <p>I lifted the film out of the hypo, washed it, adjusted it against the
  ground glass of the viewing frame and switched on the light behind.</p>

  <p>The outline of the torso was clearly visible. I made out the bony
  structures, the fractured costal cage and the vertebral column, traces of
  musculature and circulatory system. But that was all. Where the shadowy
  outlines of the soft organs&mdash;the heart and lungs and the membranous sacs
  enveloping them&mdash;should be there was only a dark, amorphous blur!</p>

  <p>If that plate was to be believed, my patient was nothing but a bag of skin
  and flesh stiffened by an amateurishly articulated skeleton and stuffed with
  something like a thick jelly. But the picture lied, of course. We'd have to
  take another.</p>

  <p>A second later the glare of the surgery blinded me as I stepped out into
  it. Then I saw Edith Horne emerging from the laboratory. Her lips were
  colorless. "Doctor Stone! Hugh's&mdash;Mr. Lambert's count is under two
  million."</p>

  <p>"Phew!" I whistled. "That's bad. I'll look up the list of professional
  donors while you type his blood."</p>

  <p>"I've already done that. And&mdash;and it doesn't fit into any of the four
  groups. Its serum agglutinates the corpuscles of Type Four, and none of the
  standard sera agglutinates it."</p>

  <p>"You must have made a mistake. If you were right about that, Lambert's
  would be the only case of that kind ever found."</p>

  <p>"Not the only case;" She said. I was disturbed by the husky quaver that
  had crept into her tones. The atmosphere of the camp seemed to have badly
  impaired her professional impersonality. "The other sample, that from the
  tramp, reacts the same way. I've cross-typed the two bloods too, and they
  match."</p>

  <p>"There's your answer," I pointed out. "You must have made the same mistake
  with both. I'll soon find out."</p>

  <p>But what I found out when I repeated the simple technique in the
  laboratory was that she had made no mistake. Only a scientist will understand
  the elation I felt as I racked the four test tubes that confirmed her report.
  In my mind I was already drafting the paper I would write for <i>The Journal
  of the Medical Association...</i></p>

  <p>Then I realized that the result of the tests I had just made was a virtual
  sentence of death on my friend. Being the sole possessor on earth, as far as
  science knew, of this unheard of blood type doomed him assuredly as a noose
  around his neck. If he did not receive transfusion within a half hour at the
  outside there was no chance to save him, and there was no possibility of
  finding a donor for him.</p>

  <p>There <i>was</i> one. There was, by a weird, impossible
  coincidence&mdash;a sheer, lunatic fluke, the tramp. How badly injured he
  was, I did not know, but there was no doubt in my mind that any drain on his
  vitality would lessen his chances of recovery to the vanishing point.</p>

  <p>No. That was out. Every principle of medical ethics forbade my taking the
  chance of tapping his veins. Every principle of the law, too. If he died
  under the operation I would be guilty of murder.</p>

  <p>Back in the surgery, Edith Horne lifted from Hugh's recumbent form. "Low,"
  she whispered. Her face was drawn, the sprinkling of freckles across the
  bridge of her pert nose vivid against a white pallor. The eyes she raised
  questioningly to mine were no longer a golden brown but dark with distress.
  She was far different, in that moment, from a nurse to whom the conflict
  against disease and death is a matter of emotionless routine.</p>

  <p>"You were correct," I told her. "It will be impossible to find anyone
  whose blood will match Hugh Lambert's."</p>

  <p>Her hands closed, slowly, on the edge of the table. She said tonelessly,
  "The tramp."</p>

  <p>I shook my head. "No. I have no right to choose between them."</p>

  <p>"<i>Right!</i>" The corners of her mouth twitched in a smile more bitter
  than tears.</p>

  <p>"Have you a right to do otherwise? Look at them."</p>

  <p>My gaze went from Lambert, clean-limbed, strong-jawed, to the miserable
  derelict on the couch.</p>

  <p>"Think what they mean to the world. And then tell me have you no right to
  make a choice."</p>

  <p>The one is a sodden hulk, I thought, useless to humanity and to himself.
  The other has already brought back from civilization's frontiers outstanding
  contributions to science, will accomplish far more&mdash;<i>if he
  lives</i>.</p>

  <p>My eyes came back to her and read a fierce challenge to be for once a man
  and not a scientific machine.</p>

  <p>"The Medical Board," I temporized, weakly. "The law. If the tramp
  dies..."</p>

  <p>"If he dies, only the two of us will know why."</p>

  <p>I made my decision. Not in words, but in an almost involuntary gesture of
  assent. Only afterward did it occur to me to wonder why the tramp had said
  not a word through all this, and by that time I had something far more
  amazing to wonder about.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Edith Horne gave me no time for a change of heart. In almost
  less time than it takes to write it, she had the Unger transfusion apparatus
  set up between the table and the couch, had laid out antiseptic and hemostats
  and ligatures, had handed me a scalpel and was waiting for me to begin.</p>

  <p>I did, God help me!</p>

  <p>I shall not go into details. Medical men know the procedure, others will
  not be interested. Suffice it to say that I connected the tramp's artery to
  Hugh Lambert's vein and permitted the blood of one to flow into the
  other.</p>

  <p>I saw the ruddiness of health again tincture Hugh's cheeks. Edith watched
  him with an intentness that excluded all else. I turned, then, to check on
  the tramp's condition.</p>

  <p>My jaw dropped. My hands shook on the stopcocks I was so carefully
  manipulating. Ice molded my body, tightening it.</p>

  <p><i>The tramp way shrinking</i>! Visibly and with increasing rapidity he
  was growing smaller! Every part of him was diminishing, at once and in
  proportion, as if he were a motion picture image from which the camera was
  being withdrawn at express speed. As if he were a pricked balloon out of
  which the gas was rapidly emptying.</p>

  <p>He was the size of a child, then of a doll, and in no time at all of one
  of those bangles that women wear on their wrists...He was gone! The tube that
  had ended in his arm dangled loosely in mid-air.</p>

  <p>The table on which he had lain was empty. Absolutely, impossibly
  empty!</p>

  <p>I swear by Hippocrates, of whom I am a humble follower, that I saw that
  man shrink and vanish, there before me, and leave no trace whatever, that he
  had ever existed.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>Affidavit of Edith Horne, R.N.</em></p>

  <p class="letter">State of New York,<br>
  County of Albany,<br>
  City of Albany</p>

  <p class="letter">Edith Horne, being duly sworn, deposes and says:</p>

  <p class="letter">I have read the account of Dr. Courtney Stone as to the
  events occurring at his home at about midnight on the morning of August 16,
  1934, and aver that as to such matters that I could have seen or heard the
  said statement is true.</p>

  <p class="letter">I did not actually see the disappearance of the man we
  called the tramp. My attention was wholly concentrated on watching the
  condition of the patient, Hugh Lambert, to whom the said tramp's blood was
  being transfused, but I affirm that said tramp was on the operating table in
  the surgery when the transfusion started, and that when I looked up at a sort
  of strangled cry from Dr. Stone, he was no longer either there or anywhere
  else in the room. I further depose that I was in such a position that even if
  the tramp had been in condition to move he could not have gone out through
  the door into the entrance hall without pushing me aside, and that the only
  other exit from the room is through Dr. Stone's office, which was locked.</p>

  <p class="letter">There is no question in my mind that the said tramp
  actually vanished in the manner described by Dr. Stone.</p>

  office and may be examined there by any one presenting credentials from a
  recognized scientific society. A.L.Z.]</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>Dr. Courtney Stone's account, resumed:</em></p><br>

  <p class="first">I MUST automatically have, shut off the stopcocks of the
  transfusion apparatus, for that is how they were when I was recalled to
  myself by Nurse Horne's startled demand, "Where is the tramp? What's become
  of him?"</p>

  <p>I didn't reply. What could I have said if I had tried to? I sought sanity
  in ligating Hugh's vein, in suturing the wound I had made. Edith helped
  me.</p>

  <p>By the time the task was completed I had got more nearly back to normal.
  "He must have managed somehow to get off the table while I was watching the
  gauges," I said. "He must be somewhere around. We'll look for him."</p>

  <p>We did, in the laboratory, in the X-ray dark room. Even in my office,
  though the door to that was locked. It was impossible for the tramp to have
  gotten in there, but not as impossible as the other thing I thought I had
  seen. We didn't find him.</p>

  <p>Edith turned to me finally, her face inscrutable, and said, "Well, that
  solves our problem, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>"How about Jethro Parker and Miss Doring? They will be asking for the
  tramp."</p>

  <p>"That's easy. He wasn't as badly hurt as he seemed, refused treatment and
  went away. He refused even to give his name and there is no way to trace him.
  And that's what we'll tell Hugh Lambert, too. We won't even tell him about
  the transfusion. Glass cut his arm as well as his leg, and in the excitement
  he didn't notice it." There was everything in favor of the course she
  proposed, nothing against it. We returned to the surgery and, I examined
  Hugh.</p>

  <p>"He's coming back strong. We'll fix up a bed for him in my study and he'll
  be good as new in ten days or so, with proper nursing."</p>

  <p>"You can be sure I'll give him that. I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, Edith. Your job is back at the camp. There are half a hundred kids
  there to be watched over and I wanted you there because I wouldn't trust them
  to any of the other available nurses. I'll have the Registry send someone
  over for Hugh."</p>

  <p>"That won't be necessary, doctor." The opening door admitted Miss Doring.
  "I was pacing the hall," she explained, "and couldn't help overhearing you.
  I'm coming to stay here and take care of Hugh."</p>

  <p>"Very commendable, my dear," I met her proposal. "I'm sure you're anxious
  to do something for him. There really will not be anything to do requiring
  training, but helping at the dressing of wounds such as his requires courage
  from one who is not used to the sight of blood. I can't have you fainting
  just when I need you."</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't be afraid of that, doctor," it was Edith who replied, "if
  you had seen Miss Doring grasping Hugh's leg to stop that artery. She saved
  him, when she couldn't have been sure that she was not herself badly hurt or
  so badly cut that her career was ended."</p>

  <p>"I wasn't doing him much good. It was the bandage you put on that really
  saved him. I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute, you two," I growled. "Stop throwing bouquets at each
  other, and let's get this matter settled. I'll take you as Hugh's practical
  nurse on Miss Horne's say-so, but aren't you being somewhat impulsive? It
  seems, to me I read somewhere that you were flying back to Hollywood to start
  a new picture at once."</p>

  <p>"Hang the picture!" Despite her earnestness there was a twinkle of elfin
  mischief in Ann Doring's eyes. "Let Ratskoff do a little worrying about me
  for once."</p>

  <p>And that ended the discussion. I forebore to ask Mrs. Small what she
  thought on her return to find that she was being called upon to chaperon a
  glamorous motion picture actress, but I confess I found myself hurrying
  through my day's work to get home a half-hour earlier. Somehow my bachelor
  domicile had taken on a new allure.</p>

  <p>But it was not to last long. Hugh gained strength rapidly, and the third
  day after these events insisted on being taken back to camp to finish his
  convalescence there. Ann Doring went with him.</p>

  <p class="cp"><em>Narrative of Hugh Lambert, B.S., M.Sc., F.A.G.S., F.R.G.S.,
  etc.</em></p><br>

  <p class="first">COURT STONE is the salt of the earth and a wizard with the
  scalpel, but he's a damnable fussbudget about his patients. I had a devil of
  a time getting it into his head that I had a job to attend to and couldn't be
  bothered nursing a couple of scratches.</p>

  <p>Perhaps I'm being unfair to him. Whom has he treated, after all, but a
  pack of soft and flabby city dwellers emasculated by the countless comforts
  of civilization? Could he understand how little the loss of a quart or so of
  blood meant to a man who'd fought a hundred and fifty miles of Chaco Arica
  jungle with his arm and side shredded to rags by a jaguar's claws; who,
  deafened and blinded and maddened by fever, had driven by curses across ten
  days of burning desert a caravan of Touaregs while they meditated his murder
  as an act of devotion to their deity?</p>

  <p>I was sorely tempted, I'll confess, to let the argument slide. I've had a
  pretty tough time of it, working my way through Dartmouth and batting around
  the world's waste spaces ever since. Lying around, relaxed and catered to and
  pampered, made that study of Doc's a little bit of Heaven.</p>

  <p>It had its angel too. Ann Doring.</p>

  <p>All my life I'd been searching for something. Not the ruins and fossils
  and artifacts of peoples who were already civilized when my own ancestors
  still gnawed raw meat from the bones of mastadons, but something more
  personal, the fulfillment of some lack in me, some indefinable, but poignant
  hunger.</p>

  <p>I had never known what it was, however, till I saw Dick Doring, grinning
  all over himself, dragging his sister up to my table in the mess hall. Then I
  knew that I'd found it. Ann Doring did something to me, in the few seconds
  Dick blurted out an introduction I didn't hear, that no woman had ever done
  before.</p>

  <p>It was nothing I could put words to, but it had tingled in my palm when
  Ann's palm met it, and it throbbed between us, there in that room.</p>

  <p>I had her all day to look at and dream about. I had Court Stone in the
  evening to engage me in man talk, his clipped Vandyke bristling, his eyes
  growing bright as he told me of the daily battles against death, battles as
  bitterly waged, and often with as much peril, as any of my own fights against
  ravening savages. But I was restless and uneasy, and the walls of the house
  seemed like the walls of a prison.</p>

  <p>I had on my mind, of course, that we were in the last two weeks of the
  season, when the staff goes quietly mad with the need for keeping routine
  going, while preparations for breaking up become more and more febrile. If
  anything went wrong now it might wreck my hopes of wangling Tony Wagner into
  financing the diggings at Peth Ankor in Mesopotamia where the fate of certain
  theories of mine as to prehistory lies buried under some hundred yards of
  detritus. But I was also vaguely aware of an urgent necessity for me to go
  back to Wanooka, a demand for my presence there that inexplicably seemed to
  have nothing to do with my responsibilities.</p>

  <p>Peculiarly enough this feeling was not nearly as powerful while I was
  fully awake as it became when, as a result of my weakness I suppose, I would
  drift into a dreamy half-doze. It bothered me a lot, because I couldn't
  understand it.</p>

  <p>I have always slept dreamlessly, but now I would come awake at night, and
  lie wide-eyed, desperately endeavoring to recall some nightmare that had
  slipped into oblivion at the instant of consciousness' return.</p>

  <p>I stood two days of that. On Saturday morning I announced to Court that he
  and all Albany's police force together couldn't make me stay put any
  longer.</p>

  <p>He spread his pudgy arms, at whose end those slim surgeon's fingers of his
  seemed so incongruous, and yielded with the physician's invariable formula.
  "All right, Hugh. I can't keep you here against your will but I won't be
  responsible for the results." None of my protests would avail to keep Ann
  from accompanying me. At that they were perhaps none too vigorous.</p>

  <p>Doc evidently had phoned ahead, for Nurse Horne met our car at the gate
  and packed me right off to the infirmary shack. Lord! I'd rather try to get
  my own way from ten Cairo dragomen, indubitably the most mulish males in this
  large world, than one red-headed gal with a conscience and me the
  subject matter of that conscience.</p>

  <p>Show Edith a patient and the devil himself won't stop her from taking care
  of him. She'd laid down the law to us before she'd been in camp two hours,
  and made us like it. Made us like her too, man to man, because she did her
  job without fuss and feathers, and because she asked for nothing in the way
  of special privilege on account of her being a woman.</p>

  <p>Yes, that gal was a good soldier. The kind you could take along on a trek
  into the wilds and never have to worry about her going soft or, which is more
  important when there's business to attend to, flirtatious. All of which is to
  explain why, after all the mischief I'd raised to get here, I meekly, let her
  bundle me up in bed and as meekly swallowed the sedative she handed me.</p>

  <p>That potion was a mistake. It put me to sleep, all right, but it didn't
  keep me from dreaming. I don't recall much of what I dreamed, but for the
  first time bits of it stayed with me.</p>

  <p>The sense of something drawing me was in it somewhere, not satisfied with
  my being at Wanooka but still dragging at me, wanting me to do something I
  could not understand. There was a crystal wall, metal bars and levers screwed
  to it in an orderly sort of jumble, much like one of those switchboard panels
  of gray slate one sees in electric power houses. Hands, white and slender and
  definitely feminine moved along those levers, but they seemed puzzled,
  uncertain.</p>

  <p>Remembering those hands afterward, I realized that I had accepted as
  natural, like one does in a dream, something quite unnatural about them.
  Between each finger there had been a translucent membrane, expanding and
  contracting as the web of a frog's feet do.</p>

  <p>I recall one thing else out of that dream. A face that made it a
  nightmare!</p>

  <p>It was a little blurred as though it were looking at me from the other
  side of a window of slightly impure glass. I had the impression that the
  glass was more of a barrier to its vision than to mine, so that it could not
  quite make one out, and that the rage that darkened its eyes was due to this
  fact.</p>

  <p>It was a narrow face, sharp-featured as a falcon's and as soullessly
  cruel. The eyes were fierce black lights within slitted, lashless lids. The
  mouth was a tight gash in its swarthy, leather-textured skin, yet something
  about their shape made me feel that behind those compressed lips were not
  teeth but sharp fangs. There was rage in that face, as I've said, but there
  was also ineffable threat. Confronted by it, I knew the meaning of terror, I
  who can say without boasting that never before had I really known what fear
  is.</p>

  <p>I awoke from that dream trembling and bathed in cold sweat.</p>

  <p>I stared at the darkness till it grayed with the dawn, and when Edith came
  in to see how I was, I demanded my clothing, telling her I was through with
  being a pampered invalid once and for all. I must have spoken to her pretty
  sharply, for she flung them at me and went out of the room without a word of
  objection.</p>

  <p>I was at once sorry for that. I had been angry at myself for a blithering
  sap and I had taken it out on the first person I saw. Which, again, was
  utterly unlike my usual self.</p><br>

  <p class="first">I OVERTOOK her on the way down to breakfast, apologized to
  her, and felt better. The clean, sharp tang of the pines was pulling into my
  lungs, the needle-carpeted earth was springy underfoot and the chill morning
  wind was grateful on my cheeks. This was what I needed to make me whole
  again; I'd been cooped up in a house too long.</p>

  <p>Edith put her hand on my sweater sleeve. "It's all right, Hugh. We'll
  forget it. But take care of yourself. Please."</p>

  <p>I laughed. "I've been doing that for a long time," I said, "and I think I
  can manage it without help for a little while longer. Quit worrying about my
  few lacerations, will you?"</p>

  <p>"It isn't that." She wasn't laughing with me, as she ordinarily did.</p>

  <p>"What is it, then? What's got you looking so washed out? I'll be blessed
  if there aren't dark circles under your eyes. Look here!" A thought struck
  me. "There hasn't been a measles or whooping cough case out in the junior
  bunks while I've been laid up? Or something like that?"</p>

  <p>"No." She pulled away from me. "No, you fool." And then she was running
  away from me, down the path to the mess house.</p>

  <p>I might have gone after her, tried to find out what was jangling her, if
  Ed Hard hadn't barged out of the councillor's bunk just then, roaring a
  welcome at me in his gentle way. After that, mess call blew and I forgot all
  about the incident.</p>

  <p>I got a thrill out of the way the kids cheered when they saw me at the
  head table. It was the real thing, no mistake, and it meant a lot. I'd been a
  strict disciplinarian, and once or twice I'd wondered whether those brats out
  of rich homes didn't hate me for it. The way they yelled told me.</p>

  <p>Ann got it, too. I knew that by the way she looked at me, starry-eyed.
  "You can't fool boys," she whispered to me as I sat down after getting a
  little thank you speech past the lump in my throat. "I've got a brother and I
  know."</p>

  <p>I got into harness right after that meal was over. It was Sunday and
  outside of their swim the campers were free to entertain their relatives, who
  started flocking in about ten, but I had plenty of work cut out for me.
  Besides an accumulation of mail only I could attend to that had piled up on
  my desk, there was the schedule of activities for the final fortnight to work
  out with Ed, arrangements for baggage packing and transportation to the city
  to get underway, the last Saturday entertainment and the break-up banquet to
  be planned, and the Lord alone knows what else.</p>

  <p>I drove my assistants and my office staff hard, but I drove myself harder.
  There were a hundred interruptions, of course. Fond papas came in with checks
  (the more money a man has the longer he likes to hold on to it) and had to be
  chatted with. Fonder mamas came in with complaints (the better satisfied a
  kid is the more his mother finds to kick about) and had to be mollified.
  Giggling sisters and cousins came in for no good reason at all and had to be
  combed out of my hair. Just before lunch Dick Doring showed up and got me
  aside in a corner.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Uncle Hugh," he whispered. "Sis don't want to be bothered with
  autograph signing and such, so she's keeping out of sight till this mob of
  visitors beats it. She don't even want them to know she's here, so will you
  please ask the staff not to say anything? I've already tipped off the
  fellows, and they've clammed up."</p>

  <p>"Oke," I grinned, knuckling his cheek. "Mum's the word." He's a well
  set-up lad, the tallest of our youngsters, clean-limbed and frank-eyed. "Now
  run along and have fun." I passed the word around, decided to have my lunch
  in the office so that I should have at least one hour's work in
  peace.</p><br>

  <p class="first">WE GOT back to normal at camp Monday morning, and I had the
  office work going well enough so that I decided I could be spared for a swim
  with Ann during the boys afternoon rest hour. I warned her to keep inside the
  line of buoys that marks off a space sufficiently large for even the
  strongest swimmer.</p>

  <p>"The sun warms the water enough," I told her, "in this end of the lake
  where it's fairly shallow, but the rest is icy. It can be negotiated, but
  it's no fun, and it's dangerous, so we just don't swim beyond the markers,
  and even keep our canoes within reach of them."</p>

  <p>Her dive cut into the lake without the hint of a splash. I contrived to
  match it. We raced for the big raft. She was a marvel of graceful speed and I
  beat her only by five feet. I was a little miffed at that. My face must have
  shown it, because her clear, merry laugh rang out as she clutched the raft
  ropes.</p>

  <p>"If I had my health," I grinned, "It would be different."</p>

  <p>The echo of Ann's laugh came back from the mountain, coarsened so that it
  did not seem her laugh at all.</p>

  <p>Someone indistinguishable called from a canoe farther out. I shoved the
  soles of my feet against the side of the raft, straightened, rolled over,
  filled my lungs and dove to swim back under water.</p>

  <p>It seemed colder than usual as my arms pumped. The imprisoned air tore at
  my chest. I have always made the distance easily, and an idea glimmered in my
  mind that perhaps I had been foolhardy to go in so early in my convalescence.
  I plunged up to the surface, whooshed the air from my lungs, glanced up to
  see how near I was to the float.</p>

  <p>I wasn't anywhere near it! I had veered, somehow, under water and had been
  swimming up the lake, parallel with the shore, and was already well beyond
  the buoys. No wonder the water was so cold! I'd have to get back, and
  quickly, too.</p>

  <p>I started swimming again. But I did not turn. I wanted to. I sent the
  message to my muscles, or thought I did, but I kept right on pumping toward
  the far end of Wanooka. The icy water seethed along my sides, and the cold
  seeped deep into me. I was numbed, lost all sense of feeling. I thought: stop
  it, turn around, make for the shore; and swam straight on, not even slowing,
  though I should have with my muscles freezing.</p>

  <p>The cold got to my brain and I did not think any longer. I was conscious
  of nothing but the urge, the terrible urge to get to the north end of the
  lake. Yes. Somewhere deep inside of me there was still a kernel of awareness
  that I was swimming to my death. It seemed some other person who knew
  that.</p>

  <p>My arms beat, my legs threshed, my body cut through the water. Faster.
  Faster...My hand hit something hard! My head bumped it.</p>

  <p>A voice screamed at me. For a moment it was just shrill sound, then it
  made words: "Hugh! What are you trying to do?" It was Edith Horne's voice.
  "You fool. You unutterable fool. Are you trying to kill yourself?"</p>

  <p>My head cleared a bit. I became aware that it was a canoe into which I had
  bumped. Edith was in it and she was yelling at me. She had been out on the
  lake and she had cut across my suicidal course.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I don't know..." I gasped. "Cold."</p>

  <p>"I should say you must be cold. Get in here, quick."</p>

  <p>I was so numbed that it was almost an impossible job, but I managed it
  somehow with Edith helping me. Her paddle slashed down, driving the canoe to
  shore.</p>

  <p>Her face was sultry, her eyes blazing. "You've got yourself a case of
  pneumonia now," she stormed, "you unmitigated ass. What made you do it?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't mean to. A current had hold of me and I couldn't fight it," I
  lied. There had been no current. There had been nothing palpable about the
  thing that had drawn me to inevitable disaster.</p>

  <p>I suspect that Edith knew I lied, but the canoe's bow crunched on ground
  and saved me from further lies.</p>

  <p>"Jump out and run up to the infirmary as fast as you can go," she
  commanded. "We've got to get your blood circulating."</p>

  <p>I jumped, and ran. Her voice was like a whip, lashing me.</p>

  <p>"Faster! Run faster!" I couldn't go very quickly, I was so frozen, and she
  kept right behind me. "Faster!" It irritated me, but I obeyed. It would have
  been senseless to do otherwise.</p>

  <p>I glimpsed Ann standing on the raft, watching us, her hand to her mouth as
  if she had just realized the implication of what she had thought a bit of
  bravado. I waved her in signal that I was all right, but Edith wouldn't let
  me stop. Anger flared in my skull.</p>

  <p>In the infirmary she flung an armful of towels at me.</p>

  <p>"Get into that room, strip and rub yourself down. Hard. Tear the skin off.
  Then get into bed."</p>

  <p>I did as I was told. Then Edith piled heated blankets over me, raged at me
  till I downed a tumbler of hot whiskey, and went out, slamming the door. The
  heated liquor knocked me out, so that I was in a dreamless sleep almost at
  once.</p><br>

  <p class="first">WHEN I awoke I knew it was very late. The infirmary is set a
  little away from the camp. From my window I could see only the woods, and
  through their trunks the north end of Lake Wanooka, but from the position of
  the stars I could tell it was well on toward dawn.</p>

  <p>The moonglow glimmered on the water, silvery except where that queer
  circular path of light showed, about which I had often wondered. Was I
  mistaken, or had it moved nearer the bank? Much nearer?</p>

  <p>I had always meant to investigate the thing, but the routine of the camp
  had kept me too busy. Now I was sorry I had not, for, from nowhere, I got the
  idea that it was the source of the strange attraction that had bothered me
  ever since my return from Court Stone's and that was stronger than ever
  tonight.</p>

  <p>A strange thing, that vague, intangible drag at me. Hard to describe. It
  was something like the Whisper in Kipling's <i>Explorer</i>.
  Remember?</p><br>

  <p class="verse">Something hidden. Go and find it. Go and look behind the
  Ranges&mdash;<br>
  Something lost behind the Ranges. Lost and waiting for you. Go!</p><br>

  <p>Yes, it was like that, except that it was I that was lost, and the hidden
  <i>Something</i> was calling me back to it.</p>

  <p>And that instead of a promise there was an element&mdash;of dread is that
  call.</p>

  <p>Suddenly I stopped pondering it and shoved up on my elbow. The high, rank
  weeds down near the lake edge were rustling in a straight line, as though
  something were threading through them. Then they were quiet. But there was
  movement under the trees through which the moonlight was sifting. The
  movement of shadows.</p>

  <p>There were shadows, but there was nothing to cast them. Not even a rabbit.
  A little muscle twitched in my cheek.</p>

  <p>There was something eerie about those drifting shadows, something
  nape-prickling...Lord, I was getting jittery! They could be nothing but the
  shadows of branches stirred by some vagrant breeze in the treetops. I made
  myself lie down, and closed my eyes.</p>

  <p>And I was dreaming once more. Of a city of strange, squat buildings on
  which a weird light lay though there was no sun in a sky I could not see. Of
  a topless crystal shaft within which, although it was solid, rainbow-hued
  clouds swirled and billowed, so that it seemed informed with an awesome other
  life divested of all mortality. Of the terrifying dark face again, more
  vulpine than before, shrewder, somehow, with a reptilian shrewdness.</p>

  <p>I saw another face, too, this one small and winsome, tight black curls
  capping it, fathomless gray eyes wide-pupiled and puzzled and afraid. The
  face of a maid over whom some brooding fear hovered.</p>

  <p>I knew, in my dream; that her name was Leeahlee.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>Clipping from the Albany Gazette, August 23, 1934:</em></p>

  <p class="newspaper">The authorities at the Postgraduate Hospital are puzzled
  by two cases of a hitherto unknown malady that have been brought to them for
  treatment during the past week. The first, Adath Jenks, 48, of Four Corners,
  was admitted, August 13th; the second, Job Grant, 57, a farmer living some
  five miles northeast of Lake Wanooka, on Tuesday, August the 21st.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">These cases resemble <i>encephalitis lethargica</i>,
  sleeping sickness, in that both men have been continually unconscious since
  they first became ill, but the germs of that disease have not been found in
  their cerebral fluid. Their strength is being steadily sapped, however and
  Jenks is at the point of death.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">Dr. Courtney Stone, of the hospital staff, said when
  interviewed that progress is being made in diagnosing these two cases, and
  that there is no cause for alarm as no indication has been found that the
  illness from which they are suffering is contagious. He suggests, however,
  that the inhabitants of the Helderberg Mountain region boil all their
  drinking water as a precaution.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>Hugh Lambert's Narrative, resumed:</em></p>

  <p class="first">RATHER grudgingly I shall have to admit that Edith Horne's
  treatment was efficacious, for I suffered no ill effects from my adventure. I
  was hard at work again at once and the countless demands upon me gave no time
  for sickly maundering. No time even for Ann, except in the evenings. We spent
  those in the rec hall. Edith must have talked to our visitor, for Ann
  insisted on our remaining indoors, despite my persistent suggestions that we
  stroll along the lake in the moonlight. That redhead was making a pest of
  herself, taking my temperature morning and night, giving me the devil when I
  forgot my sweater on a cloudy day, and behaving altogether like a hen with
  one chick. I found myself wishing that a couple of mild cases of grippe or
  something would show up among the boys, to take her mind off me, but they
  remained disgustingly healthy.</p>

  <p>Ann was a trump. She kept out from underfoot during the day, and took one
  big load off my shoulders and that of the dramatic councillor.</p>

  <p>To make Wanooka different from other, cheaper camps, I had organized it
  along the lines of a nation of primitive men instead of an Indian tribe. Our
  different age groups were called clans, the office was the Kave of the King;
  and so on. Pretty childish stuff, but the brats ate it up. For the last
  Saturday night I had devised a Tribal Council Dance, drawing both on memory
  and imagination for its details. I had the arts and crafts councillor
  building a big hide-headed drum, the nature councilor cutting out fur
  costumes from some hairy hides I'd purchased, and everybody busy with
  something or other.</p>

  <p>Ann took over rehearsing the kids in the dance that was to be the grand
  finals and did they hop to it for her! The free period wasn't enough for
  them; they begged me to let them go at it again between supper and taps, and
  I consented.</p>

  <p>That meant I had only about an hour alone with her, and it wasn't enough.
  Something had come between us. I don't know whether it was my own
  irascibility or what. We'd fuss around wordlessly in the dim, vast reaches of
  the big social hall, and often as not I would jump up, stride to the window
  and stand staring out at the lake.</p>

  <p>She'd put a record on the phonograph when I did that. The first time it
  was some crashing jazz tune, and I whirled around, snarling at her to take it
  off. Which was queer too, because that was the only kind of music I
  liked.</p>

  <p>"What do you want then?" she came back at me. "Wagner?"</p>

  <p>"Go ahead," I answered, ashamed of the way I was behaving but perversely
  continuing. "It couldn't be worse than that blare. There are some Wagner
  records in the corner."</p>

  <p>I could just see the luminous disk at the end of the lake. It was very
  close to the shore now. Curse these women anyway, I thought. If it wasn't for
  them I could go down there right now and figure out what made the light come
  up through the water like that.</p>

  <p>Then I heard the <i>Ride of the Valkyries</i> begin behind me. The first
  sonorous notes took hold of me and lifted me up, and I soared away on the
  tumbling, fierce rush of its wild stream. For the first time I appreciated
  the breadth and the depth and the swift impetuosity of that master music.
  When it was finished I demanded more.</p>

  <p>After that there was no more jazz in the rec hall after taps, but Wagner.
  All of it was soothing magic to me, but it was the <i>Song of the Rhine
  Maidens</i> I demanded most, the sirens chanting from beneath the waters of
  the treasure they guarded, of the mysteries beneath the blue depths.
  Listening to it, the pounding in my wrists would subside, and the ache behind
  my brow fade away.</p>

  <p>The record would come to an end. Ann would say, "That's enough for
  tonight, Hugh. It's ten o'clock, and Edith says you must get your
  rest."</p><br>

  <p class="first">REST. There was no more rest for me. I wasn't sleeping. I
  didn't tell Edith that or she would have thrown a conniption fit, but that
  was the crux of what ailed me. I'd climb the hill to my room behind the
  office, so exhausted that I stumbled as I walked; get undressed and get into
  bed; and then lie there wide awake, wondering if I was going crazy.</p>

  <p>I had cause enough for thinking that. I was seeing things! At first they
  were no more than the shadows of Monday night. As the week wore on, however,
  they became more distinct until every now and then, peering from behind a
  tree, dodging behind a rock, I would glimpse a little man. A man not more
  than a foot tall!</p>

  <p>I saw them only at night, and only fleetingly, so I knew nothing about
  them except that they were so incredibly small. But I shouldn't have known
  that much about them. I shouldn't have seen them at all. They could not be
  real. They could exist only in my mind.</p>

  <p>I dared to speak to no one about them. I dared not test out whether they
  were visible to me alone. I knew what the answer would be, and I knew what it
  would mean.</p>

  <p>There was the call of the lake, too, clamorous now in the long dark hours.
  Tugging at me, tearing at me to come to it. It was part of my madness, of
  course. Part of this thing that had happened to me.</p>

  <p>I tell you, I was glad when morning would come and the numberless petty
  details calling for my attention would help me to forget the night; I
  welcomed every paper thrust at me, every question the councillors had to ask,
  every one of the thousand and one problems that would come up for me to
  solve. It was hard work; and ordinarily I should have hated it with every
  atom of my being, but it kept me from thinking. I resented the smoothness
  with which matters were going. I should have liked it better if the railroad
  had wired that cars wouldn't be available to take us to the city, or the
  expressman that baggage trucks could not be obtained. That would have given
  me an excuse to get away from camp.</p>

  <p>That was what I wanted most of all. I had a notion, reasonable enough,
  that as soon as I got away from camp I should be back to normal. As soon as I
  got away from the lake.</p>

  <p>But nothing like that happened. There was one incident, though, that was
  disquieting enough. Saturday morning Ed Hard came to tell me that Jim Symes,
  on night patrol, had seen a rather rough-looking man prowling about in the
  woods back of camp. Jim had called to him and he'd run away.</p>

  <p>There isn't much about Wanooka worth anyone's stealing, except what's
  locked in the safe in my room, but one doesn't overlook a report like that
  when one is responsible for the welfare of a bunch of youthful heirs to
  fortunes aggregating billions. I told Ed to see that the councillors kept all
  the kids in sight at all times, and to have them take shifts patrolling the
  camp borders by day as well as by night.</p>

  <p>We had the canoe and swimming regatta that afternoon. I had to go down to
  judge it and distribute prizes, though I had shunned the cribs since Monday.
  I was rather glad I did so. Cribs and floats were gay with bunting, the sun
  was bright as midsummer and there was certainly nothing ominous about the
  lake. Edith, crisp in a new white uniform, forgot to pester me and Ann grew
  hoarse with cheering, especially when Dick won both his Senior Life Saving
  Badge and the canoe tourney.</p>

  <p>Dick was proud as Punch, and Ann was pleased and gay.</p>

  <p>Right after that there was a fifteen minute intermission, and I took the
  opportunity to walk up to the end of the lake with Bob Falk, who was to
  relieve Hen Corbin on the patrol we were maintaining even through the gala.
  Hen looked a little perturbed as we approached. Close to the shore when he
  saw us coming, he bent and picked something up.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Mr. Lambert!" he exclaimed as we reached him. "Look at
  this!"</p>

  <p>He shoved his hand at me. There was something on his palm, a brown-furred
  little animal, not two inches long. It was, alive, as I could see by, its
  heaving flanks, but its legs were tied together by bits of string.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" I asked, wondering at Hen's none-too-well repressed
  excitement. "A field mouse?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. It's a muskrat."</p>

  <p>"A muskrat? Maybe you're nature councillor, but you're way off this time.
  No muskrats are this small, even new-born, and whatever this is, it's
  adult."</p>

  <p>"It's a muskrat," he insisted. "What's more, I think I saw it get as small
  as that, though I still can't believe it. I was in the bushes here, heard it
  splashing out in the water and watched it. It was full size then and it was
  swimming toward shore. Just as I saw it, it got into that&mdash;that kind of
  slick place there, and it got small, all of a sudden. I caught it as it
  scrambled out on the land and tied it up."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense," I grunted. "The muskrat you saw dived, and this pigmy one came
  up just at the same time." But I was looking it the "slick place" he had
  mentioned and my throat was dry. Tangent to the bank, it was circular in
  outline, and I knew that by night it would glow with a peculiar violet light.
  "Come on back to the cribs and forget about it."</p>

  <p>Maybe he would forget about it, but I would not.</p><br>

  <p class="first">IT WAS dusk by the time the regatta was over. I plodded up
  the hill between Ann and Edith, trying my best to comprehend their chatter.
  Abruptly two blasts of a councillor's whistle shrilled from the north end of
  the camp grounds. In our code that meant trouble. I muttered some excuse to
  the girls, started away. Ed Hard angled to meet me. We held ourselves to a
  fast walk until shrubbery screened us from the youngsters and then broke into
  a run.</p>

  <p>Bob Falk had hold of the arms of a lean, blue-jeaned man. "Found this
  fellow sneaking through the woods, Mr. Lambert," the councillor gasped, "and
  copped him."</p>

  <p>"Good work," I panted. And then I demanded from his prisoner, "What are
  you up to here? Can't you read those signs? Can't you see these grounds are
  posted?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah," he grunted. He wasn't struggling. He was standing quite still,
  with his arms pinioned behind him and his eyes on the ground. "I know it's
  posted, but you ain't never kept us farmers around here from berrying and
  fishing on it."</p>

  <p>"You have no pail and no rod, so you were neither berrying nor fishing,
  and I have my doubts about your being a farmer."</p>

  <p>"I farmed on Waley Road when you wasn't dry yet behind the ears. You can
  ask anybody about who Jeremiah Fenton is."</p>

  <p>I had hard work understanding him. His voice was a thick-tongued mumble
  oddly taut with&mdash;was it pain? Desperation? But what was once Waley Road
  is now the numbered highway into which the camp road descends and only an old
  resident would know its former name. I moderated the harshness of my
  tone.</p>

  <p>"All right," I said. "You're a farmer then. What were you doing here?" His
  shoulders hunched, as a balky mule's will, but he remained silent.</p>

  <p>"Come on," I growled. "Spit it out."</p>

  <p>Fenton's head came up. Tiny muscles crawled under the wind-seamed leather
  of his countenance and hysteria jittered in his eyes. His grimly defiant face
  seemed vaguely familiar.</p>

  <p>"Rats!" Ed Hard grunted, behind me. "There's only one thing to do with the
  guy. Turn him over to the cops."</p>

  <p>"That's right, Mr. Lambert," Bob acquiesced. "They'll make him talk."</p>

  <p>"No!" the farmer yelled and wrenched out of Falk's grip. His lanky length
  fairly hurtled away from us, up the hill. Bob whirled to go after him; Ed
  plunged past me. And then both halted. Fenton had snatched up a fist-sized
  stone from the ground, was crouched, an animal at bay, his lips snarling back
  from discolored teeth, his nostrils flaring.</p>

  <p>"Let him go, boys," I called. "No use getting your skulls cracked." But I
  was wondering why he had stopped. There was no one between him and the road
  and that unexpected leap of his had taken him far enough away to make it
  improbable that we could overtake him. "Go on, Fenton. Get off the camp
  grounds and stay off."</p>

  <p>The farmer gave no sign of having heard me. He wasn't looking at me. He
  wasn't looking at Ed or Bob. He looked past us, at the lake.</p>

  <p>And startlingly he hurled himself through the narrow space between the two
  councillors, pelted down the hill, straight for those frigid waters!
  Realization blazed through me that he was going to throw himself into
  Wanooka's bottomless depths. My muscles exploded. I ran. I caught his
  shoulder barely in time.</p>

  <p>"You fool!" His arm swung back, the rock clenched in his gnarled fingers.
  My own free hand spatted open-palmed, against his cheek.</p>

  <p>The stone dropped to the ground. I felt a long shudder run through the
  farmer, saw sense come back into his eyes. His mouth twisted.</p>

  <p>"It almost got me. The hankering. It almost pulled me into the lake. I
  couldn't stand it no more."</p>

  <p>My palms went moist, suddenly, and a pulse pounded in my temples.</p>

  <p>Ed came up. "He tried to conk you."</p>

  <p>Ed's fist closed on Fenton's one arm, Bob's on the other. "It's the police
  for him, all right."</p>

  <p>"No," I said, very quietly. "Let go of him, Bob. Let go, Ed. Please get my
  car from the garage and run it up into the woods so that we can get to it
  without the whole camp seeing us. I'm taking Mr. Fenton home."</p>

  <p>Hard looked at me queerly, but his hand dropped away.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said, "I'll tell Jim to take charge of camp till I get
  back."</p>

  <p>"That won't be necessary," I told him. "I'm going alone."</p>

  <p>He started to protest.</p>

  <p>"I said <i>I'm going alone</i>."</p><br>

  <p class="first">MAYBE I was sick. Maybe I was crazy. But I still could get
  out that top sergeant's roar that makes them jump. Ed went off without
  another word.</p>

  <p>"You'll say nothing about what happened here," I told Bob Falk, and then I
  was moving away from him, climbing up through the woods toward the road.
  Fenton went with me, quiet again, docile, all the hysteria, all the ferocity,
  gone from him.</p>

  <p>Here was someone else to whom the lake called, I was thinking. He had
  fought its mysterious spell till he could fight no longer. I had to talk to
  him. I had to question him, alone.</p>

  <p>But, driving him home, I could get nothing much out of Jeremiah Fenton,
  except that the "hankering" had come on him only recently, about the day Ad
  Jenks was took sick, and that it had been getting "worse and worse" ever
  since. I hinted about the Little Men without result, but my efforts in that
  direction brought from the farmer a strange tale.</p>

  <p>I may have given the incident of which he told me, and his own
  interpretation of it, too much importance. If so, that is because of a rather
  heretical theory to which I incline that the advance of civilization and
  science has obscured almost as much from the knowledge of mankind as it has
  revealed. Is it not possible that those who live close to the soil, who work
  with Nature and commune with her, may be aware of eternal truths we have lost
  the capacity to even comprehend? Once, in the Haitian hills...</p>

  <p>But I digress. The story Jeremiah Fenton told me then, haltingly,
  gropingly, was this:</p>

  <p>He was a bachelor and lived alone in the ramshackle, sprawling farmhouse
  where I left him eventually, since his twin brother Elijah, also unmarried,
  had been drowned in Lake Wanooka the preceding winter. Jeremiah told me the
  two had been engaged in their nightly game of chess when the sleighs that
  were carrying a gay party to undreamed of tragedy drew up at their gate and
  called them out.</p>

  <p>"I had the Black," Fenton recalled, "and all I had left was my King, on
  his Queen's Bishop's two. Elijah's King were on his Queen's fourth, his Queen
  on King's eighth, his Bishop on King Bishop's five, and it were White's move.
  I seen I was licked. 'You'll get me in six, ten more moves,' I said. 'I
  resign.'"</p>

  <p>"'Six moves nothing,' Elijah says, 'I'll mate you in two moves.'"</p>

  <p>"Well, I thought he was talking through his hat, and dared him to do it.
  He ponders a minute, lays his pipe on the table and stretches out his hand to
  his Queen. Just then Jethro Parker bust in, hollering for us to hurry up.</p>

  <p>"Elijah didn't make his move. 'We'll finish when we get back,' he said.
  Jethro was making so much noise Elijah even left his pipe lyin' there. Well,
  he never come back to finish pipe or game. The lake ice broke and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I broke in. "I know what happened."</p>

  <p>"I left the board lie just the way it was, pieces and pipe and all. Taking
  them away would of been kind of like&mdash;like pulling down the shade on my
  recollection of him. Like&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I understand," I murmured, wondering what all this was leading up to.</p>

  <p>"It was just like that a week ago tonight. I finished my supper and went
  out in the front yard to pump a pail of water for washing the dishes. I was
  gone maybe five, ten minutes. When I got back there was a smell of tobacco in
  the kitchen. I don't ever smoke till after the dishes is done. I looked over
  to the little table where the chessboard sets, half expecting to see Elijah
  waiting for me to come and start our game.</p>

  <p>"He wasn't there of course. But I saw right away that one of the pieces
  had been moved. It was the White Queen and it was resting on White Queen's
  Knight's fifth now."</p>

  <p>I know a little about chess, enough to understand what that meant.</p>

  <p>"Black King has to go to his Queen's square, and White Queen mates in the
  next move. Clever!"</p>

  <p>"Clever's right. But who had moved that Queen? There wasn't no one in the
  kitchen."</p>

  <p>"You had done it yourself, without thinking. You had been milling the
  problem over and did it mechanically."</p>

  <p>"Maybe," Fenton said slowly. "Maybe. But I saw by marks in dust that
  Elijah's pipe had been moved too, and when I touched it, it was hot. I didn't
  light it and not even no tramp would of touched that black old corncob. Nor
  they ain't nobody around here good enough at chess to figure out that move.
  No. I get a notion that Elijah, not being buried in consecrated ground, can't
  rest; and that his hankering for me brought him back to where I was, just
  like my hankering for him is drawing me to Lake Wanooka. We was like as two
  peas, and that close..."</p>

  <p>I didn't hear the rest. I didn't listen to it. Fenton's mention of a tramp
  had given me the clue to the resemblance that bothered me. It was the tramp I
  had run down of whom he reminded me.</p>

  <p>Was there any connection between my injuries that night and what had been
  happening to me ever since? Doc Stone had been evasive about just what they
  were. <i>Edith would, know</i>. I dropped Fenton yards from his gate, wheeled
  the car around and went back to camp as fast as I dared drive.</p>

  <p>A shout to one of the boys brought the information that Edith was in the
  infirmary. I pounded in there, stiff-legged, saw her checking a shelf of
  supplies, grabbed her arm and twisted her around to me.</p>

  <p>"What did that accident do to me beside cutting my leg and arm?" I
  demanded. "What are you and Court keeping from me? Was I hit on the
  head?"</p>

  <p>Her eyes went wide, and her face gray.</p>

  <p>"You're hurting me, Hugh."</p>

  <p>"All right, I'm hurting you," I growled, but relaxed my hold slightly.
  "Now tell me about it. Hurry up. Tell me what happened. I've got to know. Do
  you understand? I've got to."</p>

  <p>She told me&mdash;about the transfusion and about the tramp's
  disappearance. It didn't make sense. But then nothing since had made sense. I
  was as much in the dark as ever.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE rest of that afternoon, supper that evening, went by
  with me in a daze. But I pulled myself together afterwards, because the
  Tribal Council was beginning and I wasn't going to have the boys' big night
  ruined. The contests, the games, went off slickly. Then came the moment when
  I climbed the platform that had been erected a little back from the shore and
  draped to simulate a high boulder. This was the Medicine Rock, and I was the
  medicine man who was to drum for the dance.</p>

  <p>The boys, faces grotesquely painted, furred skins thrown over their
  shoulders, took their places below me. In the wavering, red light of a huge
  bonfire they seemed indeed a gathering of cave men.</p>

  <p>I picked up the padded drum stick, started to beat on the tomtom. The
  shuffling, shambling dance Ann had rehearsed began. The mountains took the
  hollow <i>boom, boom</i> of the drum and multiplied it, so that the whole
  bowl within which Lake Wanooka lies was filled with measured thunder.</p>

  <p>It beat back at me, beat into my blood. My blood was beating in tune with
  it, in a runic rhythm that went faster and faster, in a thumping, cadenced
  frenzy that was the ancient pulse of the world, the systole and diastole of
  the world's hot core. This measure I beat was not the one I had rehearsed.
  This dance, this prancing, savage interlacing of skin-clad primordial brutes
  below me, was not the dance they had been taught. Something spoke to us,
  something older than antiquity, of the death of summer. It spoke to us of the
  cold death from which <i>this time, this time, this time</i> the trees in
  which we hid, and the grasses upon which we fed, might never come alive
  again.</p>

  <p>It wasn't I who beat upon that drum. It was something within me, some
  ancient memory within me, that beat the booming rhythm these mountains had
  not heard for uncounted centuries. It was fear that <i>pound, pound,
  pound</i> fought; fear of the gigantic beasts that roved the forest; fear of
  the flying things that darkened the sky and pounced upon us to devour us. But
  above all fear of the Little Men who brought to us a terror the more awful
  because we could not understand wherein it lay.</p>

  <p><i>There they are</i>, the Little Men, coming up out of the lake, coming
  on to the land on either side, just beyond the fire's red glare. They do not
  see them, my dancing tribesmen, but I see them; I, the Medicine Man; I, the
  one to whom the dread night has whispered its secrets. But they will all see
  them soon, they all will know the terror the Little Men bring, unless I drive
  them back, drive them back by the furious boom the magic <i>boom, boom,
  boom</i> of my drum.</p>

  <p>They are retreating, step by step, inch by inch. They are fading into the
  trees, into the lake, unable to withstand my power, the power of my furiously
  beaten drum. There is only one left, their leader, hawk-faced, vulture-eyed.
  He stands there just without the circle of light and defies me. Him too I am
  driving back, by the power of my arm and my primitive drum.</p>

  <p>No! It is not I who drive him back. He has sensed that one among us has
  wandered off into the night beyond the fire and the protecting sound of my
  drum. He has darted after her...</p>

  <p>A scream comes to me, almost drowned by the thunder of that drum! <i>Ann's
  scream</i>!</p>

  <p>"Take it, Ed!" I shouted, remembering even then, even in that instant of
  my recovery from the strange spell that had seized me, that the boys must not
  be alarmed.</p>

  <p>Then I leaped from the back of the platform and was racing up the
  hill.</p>

  <p>Afterward I realized that I alone had heard it because I was higher than
  the rest and so the hill had not blanketed it from me. But now it did not
  occur to me to wonder why no one went with me as I raced to Ann's rescue. I
  was aware only that she had screamed to me and that I was going to her.</p>

  <p>I saw figures in front of the deserted rec hall; two men, one with his
  hand on Ann's arm, the other's head hunched forward, fists knuckling at his
  sides. I shouted, and left the ground in a flying leap that ended with the
  smack of my knuckles on a hard jaw, and the pound of a sodden body on the
  ground. I whirled to the second man.</p>

  <p>"Hugh!" Ann shrilled. "Hugh! It's all right. I'm all right. Stop, Hugh.
  Don't hit him."</p>

  <p>"No, it ain't all right, lady," the fellow on the ground groaned. "He's
  broke my jaw."</p>

  <p>Ann clung to me, holding my arms, half-laughing, half-crying.</p>

  <p>"What is this?" I panted. "What's going on here?"</p>

  <p>"They're from the company," she jabbered. "From World Pictures. The man
  you hit is a private detective who traced me here, and this is Frank
  Jennings, vice president in charge of the Eastern office."</p>

  <p>"But you screamed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I did. Irving Ball, who's on patrol tonight, came down and told me
  they were waiting for me at the gate. They had wandered into camp, and popped
  out at me unexpectedly from behind this house, and I did scream. But it was
  just because I was overwrought by your drumming and was startled."</p>

  <p>"Listen, Miss Doring," Jennings intervened. "We haven't got any time for
  all this talk. If we start out right away we'll just about have time to make
  the first plane out of Newark in the morning."</p>

  <p>"But I'm not going," Ann replied. "I'm staying right here."</p>

  <p>"Do you realize it's costing the company ten grand a day to keep that
  stage waiting for you?"</p>

  <p>"World Pictures can afford it. I've made enough for them."</p>

  <p>"All right. But how about the fifty or a hundred extras you'll do out of a
  couple of weeks work if the picture's cancelled? How about the other leads,
  and the technical people?"</p>

  <p>Ann's expression changed at that from obduracy to indecision.</p>

  <p>She looked at me.</p>

  <p>"What shall I do, Hugh?"</p>

  <p>I didn't want her to go. Lord, how I wanted her to stay! She had been my
  only hold on sanity, with her alone I had found a little peace. If she went
  now&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It's your job, Ann," I said quietly. "You have to go."</p>

  <p>She winced at that, and the light died out of her eyes.</p>

  <p>"All right. I'll go." Then her hands flung out. "But you'll come to me,
  Hugh. You'll come as soon as you can."</p>

  <p>"As soon as I can," I promised. But I knew that it would not be soon. I
  also had a job to do. It would take me half around the world and keep me
  there for two years at least, two years I knew would be a hell of
  longing.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-02"
     id="ch-02"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p class="cp"><em>Hugh Lambert's narrative continued</em></p><br>

  <p class="first">TIME blurred after that. All I did was a blur, though I must
  have done properly what I had to do, for there were no complaints. All I can
  remember of those days are flashes of the bustling camp and always, somewhere
  around, Edith Horne, watching me, always watching me, trouble growing in her
  anxious eyes.</p>

  <p>But I can recall the nights, too distinctly. I can recall the leader of
  the Little Men stalking me, following me along the night-shrouded paths of
  the woods, peering through my window at my sleepless tossing. He hid no
  longer. He was no longer furtive. I had full opportunity now to study the
  vulpine features of his visage, that seemed to be carved out of a fist size
  knot of dark mahogany. I knew what that miniature, foot-tall body of his
  looked like, how it was clothed in some skin-tight, shimmering fabric that
  seemed to be woven out of metal lustrous and flexible as silk.</p>

  <p>I knew now that he was visible only to me. He had stood right in front of
  Ed Hard and me, one night, and Ed had not seen him. I almost pointed him out,
  checked myself just in time, remembering the Little Man was a figment of my
  imagination.</p>

  <p>I must get away from him. I must get away from camp. When distance lay
  between me and Lake Wanooka I should be healed. But I had to stay. I had to
  finish my job.</p>

  <p>Wednesday came at last. The boys trunks were a high pile on the campus,
  waiting for the trucks. The Break-up Banquet, a long nightmare of speeches
  and songs and cheers, was over. I almost ran to my room behind the office to
  pack. This was the last night, the knowledge pounded in my brain, the last
  night. Tomorrow morning I would be driving down to Albany, and Lake Wanooka
  would be a thing of the past.</p>

  <p>My hands shook as I dragged my flat stateroom trunk from against the wall,
  as I opened the door of my closet and started to take the neat piles from it
  and lay them in the trunk. With release at hand I could think of just how I
  would talk to Tony Wagner after we were through with the final affairs of the
  camp, how I would sell the Mesopotamian expedition to him.</p>

  <p>I'd say&mdash;what was this? I was at the closet but I wasn't taking
  anything from it. I was putting something into it. I was piling my khaki
  trousers on the shelf where they belonged. But these trousers were the first
  thing I had put into the trunk! The trunk&mdash;I turned&mdash;was empty!</p>

  <p>I had had it half packed, and now I had emptied it! I wasn't going
  tomorrow. The lake would not let me go!</p>

  <p>That lake was an obsession with me. And I knew how to cure it. Suddenly I
  knew how to cure it. I had been shunning it, shunning the thought of it. That
  had been my mistake. If I went down to it, if I stood on its bank and looked
  straight at the weird light that came up through it, fought the infernal pull
  of it and defeated it, I should once and for all be free of it.</p>

  <p>I flung around and went out of the office door, went down through the
  woods toward the north end of Lake Wanooka. Someone spoke to me. Bob Falk,
  once more on parole. I answered him, almost gaily, that I was going down to
  say goodbye to the lake. Then I was past him, and on the shore, and I was
  staring at the glowing circle of luminance that was now right against the
  bank.</p>

  <p>"Here I am," I said to it. "Now do your worst."</p>

  <p>It leaped out at me. Right out of the water it leaped and enveloped me in
  a blinding, violet blaze!</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>Affidavit of Robert Falk,<br>
  graduate student, Columbia School of Engineering:</em></p><br>

  <p class="letter">State of New York<br>
  County of New York<br>
  City of New York</p>

  <p class="letter">Robert Falk, being duly sworn, deposes and says:</p>

  <p class="letter">I was, on August 29th, 1934, a senior councillor at Camp
  Wanooka for Boys, and was on night patrol. At approximately twelve-fifteen I
  saw and spoke to Mr. Hugh Lambert, director of said camp. He was walking down
  the hill toward the lake, and said something rather queer about saying
  goodbye to it.</p>

  <p class="letter">My beat was along the northern border of the camp grounds.
  Since there had been some reports of prowlers about the camp I was vigilant.
  The trees there are set quite far apart, it was bright moonlight, and I am
  certain that I should not have missed seeing Mr. Lambert had he returned.</p>

  <p class="letter">At approximately eleven-twenty I went down to the shore to
  speak to him. He was not there.</p>

  <p class="letter">I found his clothing in the rank, tall grass that comes
  almost to the bank there. The garments had not been taken off in the ordinary
  manner. They could not possibly have been. For they were one inside the
  other, as they are worn, and every button, every buckle, was still
  fastened.</p>

  <p class="letter">In witness whereof I set hereunto my hand and seal this
  10th day of December, 1936.</p>

  <p class="letter">(signed) Robert Falk.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>Hugh Lambert's Narrative, resumed:</em></p>

  <p class="first">THE violet glare was gone almost at once, and I was in pitch
  darkness, struggling with a swathing of coarse cloth that had been thrown
  over me. As I fought it my head found an opening. I pulled out through it,
  came to my feet.</p>

  <p>Fist size rocks bruised them. I was nowhere I had ever been before. I was
  in a forest. A jungle rather, but such a jungle as no man has ever set eyes
  upon. Stalks curved gracefully up from the oddly coarse-grained earth to
  heights varying from barely greater than my own to fifty feet. They were not
  tree trunks, but great veined sheaths of plant fiber that curled in on
  themselves. The shorter ones flattened out near their dipping upper ends and
  narrowed gradually to pointed tips. From within the taller, stems issued
  three-quarters of the way up.</p>

  <p>Some of these branched, others thickened into club-like rods long as a
  tall man. There were no leaves, but each bore such fruit as may grow on some
  distant planet but never on earth.</p>

  <p>One type was teardrop-shaped, furred with short hairs, a barbed spike
  protruding from the sharper end. Another was an elongated cup of leafstuff
  studded with leprous blisters and stiff hairs. Still another...</p>

  <p>But there is no profit in describing them all. Enough that this nightmare
  display was flooded by a nightmare, violet luminance. Enough that I shivered
  as much with the impact of the delirium setting into which I had emerged as
  with the cold that lay like ice against my skin.</p>

  <p>My skin! <i>I was stark nude</i>! Not a single garment, not even the
  bandages on my arm and leg, remained to cover me!</p>

  <p>I perceived all this; the incredible jungle, my nakedness; not
  <i>seriatim</i> as I am forced to set them forth but in a single sledgehammer
  blow upon my brain. Then movement glimpsed out of the corner of my eye
  whirled me around to the left.</p>

  <p>I crouched, my jaw hardening, my hand snatching up a stone with the
  instinctive clutch for a weapon which the wilds breed into a man's very
  bone.</p>

  <p>Five paces away, a serpent was outstretched, inches thick and long as a
  man is tall. Its blunt, eyeless head was lifted a bit, as though it had
  located me by smell alone and was making up its slow mind whether to dismiss
  me as not worth its attention, or go after me.</p>

  <p>Experience has taught me that few savage things, mammal or reptile, will
  attack a motionless creature unless they are hunting food. I tautened my
  muscles to immobility, cramped as they were, and waited with pent-up breath
  for the monster's decision.</p>

  <p>If the toss went against me, I would throw the stone and leap aside. Yes.
  But that would be a thousand-to-one chance at best. I have good reason to
  know a great snake's appalling invulnerability to anything but a blast from
  an elephant gun; and the lightning-like speed with which it can move.</p>

  <p>I waited&mdash;The nape of my neck bristled with warning of a malign gaze
  upon me, of a threat to which that of the serpent was insignificant.</p>

  <p>Some sixth sense made me look upward. Hovering over me, apparently
  unsupported in mid-air, was a creature into whose gargantuan body all terror
  a man can know was crammed.</p>

  <p>That body, two feet in diameter, was globular, purple-furred. It had eight
  double-jointed legs, longer than the repulsive torso from which they angled.
  But the acme of the beast's horror was in its head, its sharp fangs
  protruding from diamond-shaped, cruel jaws; its tremendous eyes from which
  glared the black fires of Hades.</p><br>

  <p class="first">IN THE instant I glimpsed it, it crouched and hurled itself
  down upon me. My leg muscles exploded, hurled me out from under it at the
  last possible instant of escape, hurled out of the forest and into a clearing
  floored with tumbled, jagged boulders. A wave rolled up on them, splashed me
  with its spray.</p>

  <p>The monster had not followed me, and I'd lost sight of the serpent. I
  stared wildly around.</p>

  <p>Only the brush of a Dor could limn that scene. I was a lonely midge in
  the heart of an inconceivable immensity steeped, saturated in a violet
  radiance that was not light bathing it from some outside source but luminance
  exuding from the very texture of all it made visible. Before me stretched a
  shoreless infinitude of billowing waves.</p>

  <p>Behind me was the outr jungle and behind it, sweeping away from me on
  either side and curving so I sensed that somewhere, worlds away, it closed
  upon itself, a darkly purple barrier rose.</p>

  <p>It piled aloft, mile upon mile, league upon immeasurable league, till my
  mind reeled with very inability to comprehend its vastness. High, high it
  loomed, so that the sky was not above it but pinned to its bastion; the
  vaulted sky that alone was black save where bright violet dots were patterned
  into&mdash;a familiar constellation of a familiar world.</p>

  <p>I saw Cygnus, the Swan, and just beneath its lowermost star the Great
  Barrier shaped itself into a peak I knew, a peak that I had gazed at, many
  times, from the campus of Camp Wanooka. Somehow, incredibly, this weird,
  other-worldly landscape was situated on the very spot, the very location, of
  the camp!</p>

  <p>"Hughlambert!" I whirled to a deep voice that had spoken my name, making
  one word of it. I saw a man, straddle-legged on the shore, watching me. A man
  whose misproportioned frame was clad in a skin-tight garment of some metallic
  cloth that had the lustre and sheen of silk. A man whose dark face was lean,
  hawk-nosed and vulture-eyed. That face was the face of my dreams. And it was
  the face of the Little Man who had stalked me, night after night, about the
  camp.</p>

  <p>But he was as tall as I!</p>

  <p>"Who&mdash;who are you?" I gasped inanely, while the fingers of fear
  closed on my throat.</p>

  <p>"Vanark," the deep voice replied. Then his left arm swung out,
  horizontally before him, his fingers spread so that I could see the webs
  joining them, and he said something I was to hear many times. "<i>Gor
  Surah</i>."</p>

  <p>Strangely without will, I threw my own arm out, and answered, "<i>>Gor Surah.</i>"
  That was mechanical. My brain was not on my act or my words. It was reeling,
  dazed, with a sudden discovery.</p>

  <p>The Little Man was not as tall as I. I was as small as he. Somehow,
  through some unbelievable chiromancy, I had shrunk to the height of twelve
  inches. Everything clicked into place. The vast barrier was the mountain
  rampart encircling Lake Wanooka. The giant jungle was the patch of rank weeds
  along the shore. The serpent was an earthworm, the monster I had barely
  escaped a spider. This limitless, billowing sea was the lake itself.</p>

  <p>"Come, Hughlambert," Vanark said as his arm dropped to his side. "Don this
  and come." I took a dark bundle from him, mechanically as I had given the
  strange salute, mechanically obedient to his command, to some inner command
  that was like, but stronger than, the pull of the lake against which I had
  fought so long and so unavailingly. I had in that moment no will of my own. I
  had only some strange outside will in response to which I moved.</p>

  <p>Its folds fell apart as I took the bundle, and I saw that it was another
  such garment as his. I squatted and struggled into it, feet first through the
  neck opening, knowing with queer surety that was the way to put it on. The
  stuff tingled, as if it were alive and consciously shaping itself to my
  body.</p>

  <p>It was on, and I stood up, and in imitation of Vanark I pulled over my
  head a hood that was fastened at the back of my neck. It enveloped my head
  completely and melted into the neck hem of the garment to make a seamless
  joining.</p>

  <p>And then, obedient still to that strange power that had supplanted my own
  will, I followed Vanark into the sea.</p>

  <p>I could see through the fabric, and breathe through it. I could breathe
  through it even when a wave rolled over my head, swamping me. The curious
  textile seemed to possess the ability of a fish's gills to strain oxygen out
  of water!</p>

  <p>A second wave took me off my feet. I started to swim&mdash;halted the
  motion in mid-stroke as I saw Vanark lay motionless on the surface,
  motionless as far as his limbs were concerned. He was gliding, with no effort
  at all, through the water.</p>

  <p>I kept close behind him, realized that I was being towed by some force I
  could not sense otherwise than by its effect. Faster and faster it pulled
  me.</p>

  <p>I was beneath the surface! I was going down, straight down into Lake
  Wanooka's unfathomable depths! Not sinking. Being drawn down at ever
  increasing speed, while ahead of me, below me, was the blurred, foreshortened
  form of Vanark.</p>

  <p>I have dived, pearling in the South Seas, to a depth of twenty fathoms,
  which is the deepest an unprotected man can go and live. This was not diving,
  it was a plummet-like descent, a hurtling fall into an immeasurable water
  abyss endless and awful.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THAT stupendous descent continued endlessly. I was aware
  that I dropped, at a rate too rapid to be called sinking, straight down into
  a water-drowned valley whose floor was miles beneath. By the eerie violet
  light that permeated those infernal depths to which the brightest sunlight
  never had penetrated, I could see Vanark's blurred form below me, always
  below me. I was even conscious that, instant by instant, the distance between
  me and all that was familiar tremendously increased.</p>

  <p>Yet, incredible as it may seem, I felt neither amazement nor fear. Not,
  understand, because of any courage or any super-human stoicism of mine. The
  fact is that, for an unmeasured period, my mind was literally numbed by the
  enormity of the experience, my brain unable to apprehend it.</p>

  <p>That suspension of thought, that stasis of emotion, must have blocked off
  the mental chaos in which I had been lost since the auto accident, for when I
  recovered the power to think, I knew, definitely and beyond question, that I
  was and always had been wholly sane. I knew that nothing, the tramp's
  vanishment of which Edith had told me, the tug of the lake, the Little Men
  visible only to me; had been other than actuality. I was not, I never had
  been, mad. I wanted to shout it: "I'm sane! I'm sane!"</p>

  <p>Strange reaction of one who minutes before had dwindled to a sixth his
  normal size; of one who even then was gripped by some occult force that
  dragged him at appalling speed down into an awesome void of liquid light!</p>

  <p>I had lost all sense of elapsed time. Of distance. There was only myself,
  and the limitless lavender light all about me, and the darker shape of the
  Little Man beneath me.</p>

  <p>Outr as the week's occurrences had been. I now began to realize there was
  a weird inner consistency among them, a macabre pattern fitting them each to
  each.</p>

  <p>The nexus of that design seemed to be the tramp. I had been wholly normal
  till his blood had been mingled with mine, then Lake Wanooka's strange
  attraction had begun to manifest itself. Jeremiah Fenton had felt it,
  too&mdash;and was there not his vague yet definite resemblance to the tramp
  to tie Fenton into the pattern?</p>

  <p>Edith had described the tramp as shrinking to nothingness. I also had
  shrunk, except that the process had been halted when I was a foot high. The
  violet light...</p>

  <p>My speculations were halted, abruptly, by a subtle, but ominous change in
  my surroundings.</p>

  <p>It was at first merely an intangible adumbration of bounds to a space that
  hitherto had been boundless; insubstantial as that which might bring to a
  blind man awareness that he was within, say, Madison Square Garden; but
  almost at once I descried walls sloping in under me to make a roughly
  elliptical funnel still so vast I could not discern its lower limits.</p>

  <p>I now had something by which to gauge the speed of my descent, and it was
  breathtaking. Those slanting sides of rock fairly leaped up at me!</p>

  <p>Vanark was suddenly beside me, instead of below. Our course had changed.
  We were moving horizontally now. We were shooting toward one precipitous
  faade, the fanged rock now so immense its concavity was no longer
  perceptible. We were hurtling toward that jagged cliff at a speed that would
  smash us to a pulp!</p>

    <p class="caption">We were hurtling toward that jagged cliff at a speed
    that would smash us to pulp!</p>
  </div>

  <p>I flailed the water with frantic arms and legs, in a frenzy to brake that
  suicidal swoop, to swerve it. The effort was as futile as an aviator's
  catapulting parachuteless from his plane and attempting to halt his fall. In
  a final terrible moment every detail of that cruel wall etched itself on my
  retina, the last thing I was to see in life...</p>

  <p>We darted through an opening where no opening had been. There was a flash
  of solid rock slitting, gulping Vanark and me, and then there was only the
  water again and the sickening feel of the fluid compressing me, cushioning
  me, robbing me of motion!</p>

  <p>My feet found some solid footing, but I still swayed with the eddying of
  the currents set up by our sudden halt and Vanark was a blurred shadow
  swaying beside me. I made out rock ahead of me, on either side of me, a yard
  or two above me. I turned to gape at the sudden aperture through which we had
  been swept.</p>

  <p>There was no opening. It had closed again, swiftly and silently as it had
  appeared. Intelligence had chiseled the smooth rocky walls out of the
  submarine mountain. Intelligence had constructed the gateway in the
  cliffside, had opened it to receive us and had shut it behind us.</p>

  <p>Vanark moved. I saw his arm reach out to touch the wall nearest him. It
  must have been a switch that he touched, for at once the flooring on which I
  stood and the liquid mass that engulfed me were pulsing with the slow,
  ponderous throb-throb of some gigantic machine.</p>

  <p>The water tugged at me, pressed against me. I braced myself against its
  force, realizing that it was seething to some drain I could not perceive, was
  rushing out through it. Rapidly, for there was distance at once between the
  water's surface and the inwardly luminous roof of the carved-out cave,
  distance that grew from the moment I was aware of it.</p>

  <p>The surface of the water came down to my head, to my chest, swirled down
  along my sides. The machine was emptying the enclosure. I realized that it
  was a water-lock permitting communication between the lake and&mdash;and
  <i>what</i>?</p>

  <p>There must be another, greater hollow within the mountains. A cavern? A
  labyrinth? Some open space, at any rate that needs must be protected from the
  incursion of the lake, some space inhabited by living beings.</p>

  <p>This much I reasoned out while the water seethed away. I was right, as
  events proved. But my wildest imaginings could not have predicted what lay
  within the bowels of the Helderbergs!</p><br>

  <p class="first">A SUCKING noise proclaimed the rock floor almost dry.
  "Hughlambert!" Vanark's voice said sharply. I turned, saw his gnomelike head,
  too large for his body, uncovered and projecting from his skintight garment.
  It leered at me its thin lips twisted in a mocking smile. "Doff your
  hood!"</p>

  <p>"What is this?" I demanded. "Where is this?"</p>

  <p>"Obey!" His tone an inflection such as is used only to members of a
  subject race, ridged my jaw with sudden anger. I had used it myself to
  coolies in Suiyuan, to bearers on the slopes of the Mountains of the Moon.
  "At once!" It was the impersonal contempt, the gloating triumph, in his beady
  eyes that seared me.</p>

  <p>I snarled back at him, an iron band constricting my forehead, my thigh
  muscles cording.</p>

  <p>He made some slight movement. Perhaps I thought he was about to attack me.
  Perhaps my latent wrath at what had been done to me, at myself for the
  meekness with which I had responded to Vanark's earlier commands needed only
  the tiniest of sparks to bring it to full flame. I launched forward, clutched
  his shoulder and slammed him against the wall.</p>

  <p>"Answer me!"</p>

  <p>Vanark's countenance darkened with malign fury.</p>

  <p>"You dare touch a Surahnit," he said whitely angry. "<i>Taphet!</i>"*</p>

  <p class="footonte">[* Note: Some time after this incident I realized that from
  the moment I had been reduced in size I had understood, and spoken a language
  utterly new to me, comprehending it as though it were my mother tongue except
  for terms such as these, that have no counterpart in our lexicon. Sometimes,
  in what follows, I shall substitute for the names of objects, functionaries,
  their nearest English equivalent translating for the reader of these lines
  (if they ever have a reader).]</p>

  <p>I didn't know what the epithet was he spat at me, but I knew its intent.
  He had called me, "Pariah!" It put the final touch to my blind wrath. My arm
  jerked back, my fist knotted to smash that hateful face...</p>

  <p><i>And stayed that way!</i> I couldn't deliver the blow. I could not move
  at all for one nightmare moment of paralysis!</p>

  <p>In the next instant I did move, and what I did was infinitely more
  terrifying than doing nothing. The fingers I had on Vanark's shoulder
  loosened and dropped away. I stepped back, my shoulders bowed. My left arm,
  the one that jerked back to hurl hard knuckles at the swarthy man, threw
  itself horizontally before me fingers spread.</p>

  <p>"<i>Gor Surah</i>!" The syllables came from my lips, but I swear they were
  not formed in my mind. Nor those with which my voice followed Vanark's brief
  acknowledgment of the strange salute. "Your pardon, master."
  <i>Master!</i></p>

  <p>I lifted my hands to my head and stripped back the hood that had covered
  it. I detested myself for the humble gesture, the spineless apology, the
  gesture of obedience to the glowering Vanark's command. I, the real Hugh
  Lambert, had nothing to do with them. Some substanceless compulsion had hold
  of me; a will not my own had begun to replace my will up there on the borders
  of Lake Wanooka. My rage had momentarily released me from it, but now it had
  regained possession of me. I came now to the full realization of its
  strength, because now for the first time I had come into direct conflict with
  it.</p>

  <p>Conflict? There was no more conflict than there is between marionette and
  the puppeteer who pulls its strings. Save only this: Whoever, whatever, it
  was that dominated me had stolen my body from me; my muscles, even my tongue;
  but it had not vanquished my brain.</p>

  <p>Nor my soul. Appalled, I might be, filled with dread of this strange thing
  that had come to me. But not conquered. Not conquered yet, not till reason
  itself should be blotted out. I swore that to myself, standing there
  powerless to defy another's will.</p><br>

  <p class="first">MY FINGERS were still stripping off the metallic fabric that
  had acted as gills through that terrific dive, when the scrape of rock on
  rock jerked my head around to the cave-wall opposite to that through which we
  had been swept. A vertical gash appeared, rapidly widening until the lock
  chamber was open on the side away from the lake.</p>

  <p>"<i>Gor Surah</i>!" A figure, poised where the vanished wall had been,
  flung out a horizontal arm in salute, its webbed fingers close together.</p>

  <p>"<i>Gor Surah</i>!" We responded, imitating his gesture in unison. Vanark
  added a name, "Talim!"</p>

  <p>This second of the Surahnit with whom I came in contact was young, a mere
  lad. Except for the strange misproportion of his head and limbs, he might
  have been one of my own senior campers. He had about him the same air of
  lithe eagerness, the same joy in a life just taking on meaning. There was a
  quick dart of his dark eyes to me; curiosity and some obscure excitement
  glinted in them. Then they were cast down, and Talim was backing away from
  before us as we wordlessly advanced.</p>

  <p>But there was a more fundamental difference between Talim and my lads than
  mere appearance. Not even the youngest of them would ever have manifested
  quite the subservience that subtly cloaked Talim as he backed into a niche in
  the wall of a long tunnel while we continued past him.</p>

  <p>I forgot Talim, I forgot even my resentment at the stolid submission with
  which I followed Vanark, as the tunnel ended and we came out on a narrow,
  shell-like ledge that clung to the side of a colossal cliff.</p>

  <p>High as the towering rampart of the Helderbergs had appeared, it shrank to
  insignificance in contrast with the vertiginous fall of this mighty
  escarpment. How far above me the precipice towered I did not immediately
  observe for I gazed down over the brink before me and my senses reeled with
  awed wonder.</p>

  <p>A landscape stretched below, mile upon distance-dwarfed mile, to another
  tremendous wall hazily remote. I saw hills and valleys and ruler-straight
  roads. I saw isolated dwellings, structures clumped into mill clusters that
  might be villages, and two larger groupings one of which might well be the
  city of my dream.</p>

  <p>I was too far above all this to discern the detail of even the largest
  building. But I did have an impression of <i>difference</i> from the world
  above.</p>

  <p>That difference was not alone a matter of shapes and contours. For an
  eye-blink of time I sensed only a dream-like, eerie quality suffusing the
  scene, a weird wrongness that was infinitely, ominous. Then I saw what the
  difference was.</p>

  <p><i>There were no shadows</i>. Nowhere, not where a sharp-sided mesa jutted
  from the ground nor where, to my left, a tremendous tumulus of splintered,
  rectangular boulders was piled against the distant wall of this hollow within
  the earth was there a single shadow.</p>

  <p>I glanced down. There was no shadow on the stony shelf where I stood. I
  myself cast no shadow. Vanark cast none...</p>

  <p>"Come!" Vanark said, and was striding away along the ledge. I followed
  him, impelled by the alien will to which I was subject. My gaze returned to
  that vast stretch of terrain below. Everywhere upon it tiny specks crawled.
  Though I could make out nothing of their form, they moved too purposefully to
  be anything but animate, intelligent creatures.</p>

  <p>This was no cave, no mere subterranean cavern. Here was a nation, a world
  within a world, inhabited by thousands, perhaps by millions of the Little
  Folk whose messenger was Vanark.</p>

  <p>And I was their captive.</p><br>

  <p class="first">IT IS difficult to select out of the welter of thoughts and
  speculations and fears that seethed in my brain at this time the ones which
  are most, significant. Perhaps, since its nature was then becoming a little
  clearer to me, I should discuss the spell that dragged me so helplessly in
  Vanark's wake.</p>

  <p>I obeyed it, willy nilly, as one obeys some post-hypnotic suggestion,
  unconscious of its source. Yet it did not continuously control me. The jerk
  of my head toward the sound of the lock's opening inner portal had been my
  impulse, as had been my pause just now at the edge of the ledge. My command
  over the movements of my body was not obliterated, but superseded.</p>

  <p>I resolved to remember that. Some time I might have a chance to use
  it.</p>

  <p>There was more. The fact that Vanark had <i>spoken</i> his order to me,
  just now, seemed to indicate it was not he to whom I was enslaved. But when I
  had been halted in the very act of striking him there had been no one else in
  the chamber, and we had been enclosed by solid rock. Even now I could locate
  no one near enough to make me out as anything but an almost microscopic
  animalcule crawling along the looming cliff. Were there invisible eyes upon
  me, watching me every step? How could that be?</p>

  <p>I decided-upon an experiment. I would whirl, run off in the other
  direction. Vanark was ahead of me, could not see me. I would take good care
  he did not hear me.</p>

  <p>Now I would do It. <i>Now!</i></p>

  <p>I kept right on going, a half dozen paces behind my leader. There had not
  been even a twitch of my smallest muscle in response to the fierce effort I
  had made, or tried to make.</p>

  <p><i>Quod erat demonstrandum</i>! I was master of myself only when what I
  wanted to do did not contradict the Other's commands.</p>

  <p>I was not, you see, beaten yet. I was testing the forces arrayed against
  me. I was preparing myself for rebellion against my captors. I had no plan.
  To make one I must know what it was I schemed against. I must know my own
  weaknesses, my enemies' strength.</p>

  <p>I must also gather every iota of information I could about my
  surroundings. The weird world below was a map without detail from this
  height. I turned my attention to the face of the looming cliff.</p>

  <p>There were other openings in it, intermittently along the ledge. Some of
  them were roughly framed, the exits of natural caves. Others were manifestly
  hewn, as the lock had been, out of the perdurable rock. I tried to glance
  into one of these as I passed it. I saw nothing. My sight was blocked by a
  screen of <i>living light</i>!</p>

  <p>It was a curtain of radiance, an impenetrable sheet of coruscant purple
  fire, so shimmering that it seemed endowed with some other-worldly sort of
  sentience. It was made up of sparks, of tiny-explosions, of darting violet
  infinitesimal stars, and all of them streamed incessantly, endlessly, out of
  the very substance of the cliff.</p>

  <p>The rock itself, the towering precipice was aglow with light. And not only
  the rock. Vanark himself, hurrying ahead of me, was visible by the same
  intrinsic radiance that glowed from within his very flesh.</p>

  <p>My own hand, too, was softly lambent. To its qualities of form and color
  another had been added, as inherent as these. Light!</p>

  <p>That was why there were no shadows in this amazing terrestrial hollow!
  There was no sun, no mode, no external source for its pervading illumination.
  Everything here, living and inorganic matter alike, shone with its own
  brilliance. Light casts no shadow.</p>

  <p>There was infinite beauty in that omnipresent luminance,
  and&mdash;infinite threat.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THAT threat was vague, a product simply of strangeness. But
  there was nothing vague about the terror that struck at me seconds after my
  attempt to peer within the opening had failed.</p>

  <p>We had gone by a half dozen of such light-screened portals when the ledge
  curved around a jutting fold in the cliff face. The protuberance hid Vanark.
  I went around it.</p>

  <p>There was no one on the ledge. It ended abruptly, a scant three yards in
  front of me, and beyond was nothing but a sheer dizzy drop, without hand- or
  foot-hold, to the base of that incredible precipice.</p>

  <p>Utterly impossible for a man to take more than three strides more and
  live. I gasped&mdash;<i>and paced on, utterly unable to halt</i>!</p>

  <p>One step I took. Two. All of me, every shuddering nerve and cell, recoiled
  from the fearful plunge. The third-stride brought me to the very brink. A
  scream formed in my throat as my foot lifted for the step that must be my
  last...</p>

  <p>I turned, <i>was turned</i>, toward the cliff!</p>

  <p>My foot came down on solidity! I was within the arch of an opening the
  sparkling motes of whose curtain parted to let me through. I was in a tunnel
  once more, and Vanark was a dozen feet ahead of me, and the sound of our
  footfalls reverberated hollowly in my ears.</p>

  <p>The passage pitched downward for a space, twisted sharply to the right. I
  reached the turn, went around it, came out on a gallery running along one
  smooth concave wall of a huge cavern.</p>

  <p>Still moving swiftly, I contrived to look down to the floor of this great
  cave, fifty feet below me. It swarmed with the tiny creatures of this outr
  world.</p>

  <p>The <i>tiny</i> creatures. Though they were no smaller than myself, my
  perspective was restored! For, lying there below me, row upon ghastly row,
  were the corpses of humans, human-size; the cadavers of men and women and of
  little children, gigantic by contrast to the ghouls bustling about
  them&mdash;busily, purposefully.</p>

  <p>They were human beyond question, and by unmistakable, gruesome signs I
  knew them to be long dead. Then they were screened from me by hulking
  machines that whirred and clashed violet-gleaming rods, that spun cogged
  wheels and hid the grisly morgue. But far at the other end of the vaulted
  space there was a raised platform, and this I could see over the tops of the
  machines as I was hurried along, unable to stop, unable to cry out, unable to
  do anything but gape at what was happening on that dais.</p>

  <p>A half-dozen Little Men were clustered about a naked human corpse lying
  there. There was something grotesque about the recumbent shape, something
  clumsy in its formation. It was too far away for me to be sure of what there
  was about it that troubled me, but it was not too far away for me to see that
  a foot-high creature lay beside it, and that there was some connection
  between the opposed arms of each, something that dimly resembled a
  transfusion apparatus I once had seen Courtney Stone use.</p>

  <p>The group of Little Men swirled with some obscure excitement. And
  then&mdash;and then...</p>

  <p>The dead human quivered! His free arm rose, moved across his chest and
  fumbled at the other, as though his first sensation were discomfort of which
  he must be rid.</p>

    <p class="caption">The dead human quivered...his free arm rose.</p>
  </div>

  <p>A wall cut off my view, the wall of another tunnel, into which my swift
  course had taken me. I tried to convince myself I had been mistaken. The
  human had not been dead. He had not come to life again as I watched him, life
  pumped into his veins from the veins of a Little Man.</p>

  <p>Why should I have thought, just then, of a tale I had heard, was it days
  or eons ago? A tale of a drowned farmer returning to his home and moving a
  piece on a dusty chess board? Why should the fingers of a gelid dread have
  tightened on my heart?</p>

  <p>Was it only because I had seen, screwed to a dead lad's moldering;
  green-scummed shoe, a rusted ice skate? Or did there already glimmer in my
  mind some inkling of the fearful truth, some suspicion of the ghastly scheme

  <p class="cp"><em>Letter from Richard Doring, Senior Bunk, Camp. Wanooka,<br>
  Cadet Major U.S. Grant Military Academy, to Ann Doring,<br>
  c/o World Pictures, Hollywood, Cal.</em></p><br>

  <p class="letter">Camp Wanooka, Thursday,<br>
  Aug. 30, 1934 Dear Sis:</p>

  <p class="letter">I guess you're surprised to see that I'm still at camp.
  Well, you're no more surprised than I am.</p>

  <p class="letter">I woke up in the dark, last night, which was queer in the
  first place, because it's usually hard enough to wake me in the morning. I
  thought it was just because of all the skylarking on account of the Break-Up,
  and I lay there thinking about all I was going to do in New York the three
  weeks before I had to leave for school.</p>

  <p class="letter">Pretty soon I began to see, through the open window over my
  cot, lights flashing in the treetops. There was a lot of whispering too, and
  it was all very mysterious.</p>

  <p class="letter">The night seemed full of a hushed sort of excitement. I
  looked at my luminous watch. It was almost one o'clock, which is awfully late
  for here. I knew, then, that something was up.</p>

  <p class="letter">Well, it couldn't be like me to have anything going on and
  not stick my nose in it. I slid out of bed, slipped into my bathrobe and
  sneakers and tiptoed out.</p>

  <p class="letter">Cat-footing out of the door, which was open, I stumbled on
  something and had to grab the jamb to keep from falling. Funny thing was,
  when I looked to see what had tripped me there wasn't anything there. Nothing
  at all.</p>

  <p class="letter">I was real scared for a second. Creepy scared. Then I
  decided I must have tangled my leg in the skirt of my robe. It hadn't felt
  like that, though it had felt as if my shin had been bumped by something
  solid&mdash;and alive.</p>

  <p class="letter">The flashlights were flicking around up at the north end of
  camp. I went toward them, keeping in the dark as much as I could, got past
  the office shack and stopped dead in the edge of the woods just beyond it. Ed
  Hard and Bob Falk were prowling through the brush, their flashlight shining
  on the ground.</p>

  <p class="letter">"It's funny," Bob was saying, "that we can't find his
  tracks anywhere."</p>

  <p class="letter">Then Ed said that somebody'd been acting upset lately and
  maybe he'd jumped in the lake.</p>

  <p class="letter">I saw Bob's torch shake a little. They were talking about
  Mr. Lambert, and Bob said that he'd never do a thing like that, and look at
  the way his clothes are piled on the ground.</p>

  <p class="letter">Then I heard Nurse Horne yelling at me, and Ed and Bob came
  running, and before I could answer they started to bawl me out.</p>

  <p class="letter">But Miss Horne told them to let me alone. She said as long
  as I was there they'd have to tell me what'd happened and depend on me to
  keep my mouth shut. Her face was tight, kind of, and awful pale.</p>

  <p class="letter">I know I can trust you not to repeat a word of what
  follows. So here goes.</p>

  <p class="letter">Mr. Lambert had disappeared. He'd gone down to the lake
  about an hour before and then had vanished clean off the face of the
  earth!</p>

  <p class="letter">We looked for him awhile longer, but it was no use. Bob
  Falk had been on patrol at that side of camp, Ed Hard on the side along the
  road, and Miss Horne had been awake, packing all the medicines and stuff in
  the infirmary. Mr. Lambert couldn't have got out of camp without one of them
  seeing him, but he wasn't in it. We gave up at last, and they started to talk
  about what they should do.</p>

  <p class="letter">The councillors wanted to notify the police, but Miss Horne
  wouldn't let them. She said they mustn't get the boys excited. They'd go home
  and tell their folks and that would ruin the camp next year. There really was
  nothing to worry about. Mr. Lambert must have his own reasons for going away
  like he had, and if he'd been able to take care of himself in the wilderness
  he certainly could in America.</p>

  <p class="letter">That's the way she talked but I had a funny hunch she had
  more on her mind than she was saying and that she was frightened to
  death.</p>

  <p class="letter">Well, I went back to the bunk and I was so tired I fell
  right asleep. When the get-up bugle blew I dressed in a jiffy and rushed out
  but Mr. Lambert wasn't anywheres around.</p>

  <p class="letter">The bus that came, right after breakfast, wasn't big enough
  to take all the bunch, so it was decided that the four seniors in my bunk
  were to be run down to Albany in the camp sedan. That's why it wasn't till
  the bus left that anyone noticed Charley Dorsey hadn't showed up.</p>

  <p class="letter">Ed Hard went to get him. Charley was still asleep, and Ed
  couldn't wake him up!</p>

  <p class="letter">Dr. Stone, whom they phoned for right away, said that
  Charley has a queer disease, something like sleeping sickness only it isn't.
  There's two cases like it in the Albany Hospital, both from around here so it
  may be contagious and Doc has quarantined our bunk.</p>

  <p class="letter">Charley is in the infirmary here and the rest of us; me,
  Roger Norton and Percy White; have to stick around. Besides us fellows
  there's just Miss Horne. Ed, Bob, and Morphy the cook, left in camp.</p>

  <p class="letter">Morphy's a queer duck. He's an old Irishman, with a face
  like the ones we saw cutout of toast in that store on Lexington Avenue. We
  all ate lunch in the kitchen, except Charley of course. By that time Roger and
  Perce had started asking questions about Mr. Lambert and Ed decided it was
  best to tell them what had happened, swearing them to secrecy.</p>

  <p class="letter">"It's the leprechauns has got him." Morphy said. "We won't
  see him no more."</p>

  <p class="letter">"Leprechauns!" Roger asked. "What's that?"</p>

  <p class="letter">"Them's the little people that's older than the hills
  themselves," Morphy said. "The little people that owned the Earth when it was
  young and we wasn't yet thought of." He had a frying pan in his hand. There
  was a queer, faraway look in his eyes just then that made me shiver a little.
  "They never die, and some day they're going to take the Earth back for
  themselves."</p>

  <p class="letter">Roger laughed. It seemed to make Morphy angry.</p>

  <p class="letter">"You can laugh, young fellow," he said. "But I seen them
  myself, coming out of Lough Neagh. They was a queer purple light on the water
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p class="letter">"That will be enough of that," Ed interrupted. "We've got
  enough on our minds without your Irish fairy tales."</p>

  <p class="letter">"Fairy tales, is it? Irish, is it? What about the trolls
  the Germans tell about? What about the black pigmies of Africa no explorer
  has ever seen? What about the gnomes that carried Rip Van Winkle away right
  in these here very mountains, the ones the Dutchmen used to say-made the
  thunder? And what about the fairies and the elves themselves? There's good
  and evil among the little people, just like there is among us."</p>

  <p class="letter">"I said that we'll have no more of that sort of talk," Ed,
  growled, and that shut Morphy up. Perce said something to me but I didn't
  hear him. I was watching Nurse Horne. She just sat there, staring at the
  cook, and her face was like it had been the night before, pale and tight and
  awful scared.</p>

  <p class="letter">This is a long letter but I didn't have anything to do
  except write it. Camp is awful empty with almost everybody gone, and those
  who aren't worried sick and trying not to show it. I'll have to close now,
  though, because Doc Stone's going to town and he's going to air mail this for
  me. He's coming back later. He's going to spend his nights here. He says
  that's on account of Charley but I'm pretty sure it's on account of Mr.
  Lambert.</p>

  <p class="letter">I've asked Doc to bring back some games, like Mr. Ree and
  Pick Up Sticks. Will you be a good sis and wire him the money to pay for
  them? My balance in the camp bank is all used up.</p>

  <p class="letter">Your affectionate brother,<br>
  Dick.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>Hugh Lambert's Narrative, resumed:</em></p>

  <p class="first">THE tunnel that led from the great cavern where I had seen,
  or thought I had seen, a human corpse weirdly revived, ended abruptly in a
  circular, dome-ceilinged room some ten feet in diameter. I came to a halt
  beside Vanark.</p>

  <p>This cubicle was entirely bare, and there was no exit from it. <i>There
  was no entrance</i>! Following the rounded walls with my eyes, I was aware
  that they had made a complete circuit and had encountered no break in the
  gleaming rock. Startled, sure that this must be illusion, I put out my hand
  to feel for the opening through which I had just come.</p>

  <p>A sharp cry of warning from Vanark was drowned by a whistle that leaped
  high in the scale to a tremendous, humming roar. The wall rasped the skin
  from my fingertips, flung my hand up and away from it, so violently that I
  was thrown off balance!</p>

  <p>I did not fall. I was poised on one foot, my body canted at an impossible
  angle, but I did not fall!</p>

  <p>I stared, bewildered, at the wall. It was not speckled with light-points
  as the face of the cliff or the tunnel sides had been. It was striated by
  multitudinous vertical lines of brilliance that wavered and were never
  still.</p>

  <p>No! The walls were motionless. It was we who were flashing downward, so
  fast that we were weightless; so fast that I gasped with sudden fear lest the
  floor drop away from beneath me and I crash against the ceiling. I cowered
  beneath that threat, looked upward.</p>

  <p>There was no ceiling! There was only a tight-lined cone, coming to a point
  immensely far above me.</p>

  <p>I was in no enclosed car. I was on a platform and the cone up into which I
  stared was the shaft down which it shot.</p>

  <p>Somewhere in that shaft there had to be a vent for the air beneath the
  close-fitting stone disc that carried us downward, and that was the source of
  the unbearable roar that beat in my ears.</p>

  <p>The shaft, the platform, vibrated with the fearful sound. It took hold of
  me and shook me, so that every separate atom of my body was in its grip. In
  the next instant, or the next, they must disintegrate. The pain of it was
  excruciating. I was all pain, all agony. I could hear, see, nothing.</p>

  <p>I threw out my arms, wildly, actuated only by some instinct of
  self-preservation, some brainless impulse to combat the terrific vibration
  that was tearing me to pieces. My hand struck something soft, warm. Flesh,
  Vanark's flesh. Vanark's throat.</p>

  <p>My fingers closed on that throat. Somehow the fingers of the other hand
  joined them.</p>

  <p>I was stripped of sight, feeling. I was stripped of reason. I was
  suffering torture. But I knew, my hands were on the throat of my enemy. For
  this one moment he was at my mercy.</p>

  <p>Mercy! A savage laugh ripped from me and my fingers closed on the neck
  they clutched. I felt flesh squash beneath them. I felt windpipe-gristle
  crumple.</p>

  <p>Hands seized my arms, my waist, dragged me from my victim. Silence
  throbbed in my skull, silence that was like thunder after the roar that had
  accompanied that awful descent. The fall was ended. There was a door again in
  the wall of the great shaft, and men were crowding in through it. Men had
  taken hold of me, had dragged me erect, their froglike fingers digging into
  my flesh. One knelt to Vanark, whose face was blue with strangulation, the
  bruises my fingers had made livid on his throat.</p>

  <p>I wrenched an arm free from the clutch on it...and then I was rigid. I
  stood meekly, abandoning the struggle. Not because of resignation. Because
  once more the Other had seized control of me.</p><br>

  <p class="first">"ANOTHER Taphet bustin' out," a low voice muttered, behind
  me. "They're sure looking for trouble these times."</p>

  <p>"Yeah," another responded. "If I was the Council I'd quit tryin' to bring
  em to their senses in the labor squadrons. I'd line em up and <i>coret</i>
  the whole crowd." He touched a short-barreled device at his belt, fashioned
  from some dull red metal, beyond doubt a weapon of some sort.</p>

  <p>"Well, this one won't get to no labor squadron if I know Vanark. Not after
  what he done to him."*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Editor's Note: Mr. Lambert here evidently attempts to
  convey by elisions and ungrammatical construction some difference in the
  speech of these men from that of the more cultured
  Surahnit.&mdash;A.L.Z.]</p>

  <p>There must have been a dozen of these men crowding around me, youths like
  Talim. They were all dressed alike, in queerly cut costumes of what appeared
  to be a dark green, pliable leather, evidently a uniform. The one massaging
  Vanark's throat was probably their officer. He was older, his uniform better
  fitting. Some insignia decorated its sleeve and his belt supported, instead
  of a <i>coret</i>, a short-handled, flint-headed ax. An ax of the Stone
  Age!</p>

  <p>"Silence!" he commanded, not turning his head. "There's too much
  chatter."</p>

  <p>Vanark spluttered. He thrust a hand against the floor, shoved himself up
  to a sitting posture. The officer helped him to his feet; stepped back and
  saluted him with horizontal arm, spread fingers, and the inevitable: "<i>Gor
  Surah</i>."</p>

  <p>Vanark responded perfunctorily, turned to me. His countenance was a
  frozen, expressionless mask, but his eyes were red balls; worms of rage
  crawled within their lurid depths.</p>

  <p>"<i>Coret</i> this man," he blurted out, thick-tongued.</p>

  <p>The officer straightened. I think he clicked his heels. "There has been no
  court," he protested. "The decree&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"May at all times be superseded by a member of the Council," Vanark
  interrupted. "You know that, Subaltern Hafna. I will cover you. Obey my
  command."</p>

  <p>"Very well." Hafna wheeled crisply to face me, jerking the ax from his
  belt.</p>

  <p>"Attention, men!" he snapped. Feet shuffled. The green-uniformed men were
  ramrod-stiff. "The execution detail will be Fator, Latta, Kut. March the
  prisoner out."</p>

  <p>"No," Vanark countermanded. "I want him slain at once!" His urgency seemed
  not to be wholly due to his desire for immediate vengeance. I caught a
  flicker of his glance to the entrance. "Here!"</p>

  <p>"The concussion may injure the shaft mechanism, Councilman Vanark," Hafna
  objected. I rather resented his temporizing. I had no chance of escape, no
  chance even to die fighting. The quicker it was over and done with the
  better.</p>

  <p>"Have him taken to your guardroom," Vanark yielded. "But no further."</p>

  <p>The subaltern gave the command. I was marched off the platform through the
  doorway. This side of the guardroom was the lambent rock of the cliff, the
  others were of a whiter, softer appearing stone. The room was sparsely
  furnished with appointments queerly shaped out of the same alloy as the
  guards weapons and the handle of Hafna's ax. A rack of <i>corets</i> hung on
  one wall. A tool of that strange, red metal hung in an embrasure of the one
  opposite the shaft entrance.</p>

  <p>I was paraded to the third wall, and stood against it. The detail Hafna
  had named lined up, facing me. The officer strode stiff-kneed to the end of
  the line. "<i>Corets!</i>" he barked. Three hands snapped to three belts.
  "Draw!" Three hands jerked in unison. Three dull red barrels snouted at
  me.</p>

  <p>"Wait, Subaltern Hafna!" I exclaimed. "Nal Surah has need of me and even
  Vanark cannot save you from his wrath if you destroy me."</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE words came from my lips, but I swear I did not say them.
  How could it? I had not then yet heard the name, Nal Surah, was unaware of
  its transcendant power. It was the Other who had spoken with my tongue. The
  Other invisible, intangible, but aware of what was happening here.</p>

  <p>Hafna hesitated, his head turning to Vanark, his eyes questioning. I could
  not read the latter's expression, but what he said was clear. Too clear. "He
  lies."</p>

  <p>"But," the subaltern began, "would it not be wise to make certain. I
  think..."</p>

  <p>"Your duty is to obey, not to think. Am I not of the Ratanit? Do I not
  know Nal Surah's mind? Give the command!"</p>

  <p>Hafna shrugged. His fleshless lips parted. Now, I thought. This is it.
  This is the end...</p>

  <p>"Who is it that knows Nal Surah's mind?" It was a woman's voice, indolent,
  low, almost intonationless. "What passes here?" But there was something in
  its timbre that spoke of an assured power.</p>

  <p>Hafna spun to it, his arm flinging out parallel with the floor. "<i>Gor
  Surah!</i>" Vanark's gesture was this time no mechanical acknowledgment of an
  inferior's salute. It was a greeting to an equal. Or a superior? I could not
  be quite sure. "Nalinah!" one of the guards muttered.</p>

  <p>She leaned against the jamb of the outer doorway, open now, flicking a
  lithe thigh with a thin silvery rod that was tipped by a filigree
  representation of the same insignia that was on Hafna's sleeve. There was a
  pantherine grace to her small body. A short-skirted, rainbow-hued frock was
  kirtled at her waist but tight about her bosom so that it did not conceal the
  soft curves it covered. Her head, crowned by an aureole of flaxen hair, was
  canted slightly to one side, like a curious bird's. The curl of her lips, the
  color of old rose, hinted at a smile but there was no smile in her blue
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"What goes on here?" she repeated. "Answer me, Subaltern Hafna."</p>

  <p>Against the sun-brightness of her hair her complexion was oddly dusky. Her
  features had the racial sharpness of these Folk, yet in some evasive way they
  brought to mind not the vulture Vanark's resembled but the parakeet. There
  was the same pastel beauty there, the same fragile loveliness.</p>

  <p>"We execute this Taphet, Ra Nalinah," the officer spoke up. "He attacked
  Rata Vanark and would have slain him had the elevator been but an instant
  slower in its descent."</p>

  <p>Nalinah's face hardened. "Why is he not delivered over to a court, as the
  Council has decreed, that the execution may be a public warning to others of
  his ilk?"</p>

  <p>"Rata Vanark commanded to the contrary."</p>

  <p>"Ah, Vanark. That was why you claimed to know Nal Surah's mind. But I
  recall that in Council you cast the deciding vote for the public punishment
  of rebel Taphetnit, when I opposed it. Strange you should forget the
  decree."</p>

  <p>"I did not forget it," Vanark responded. "Nor did I forget that at my
  suggestion authority was reserved to us of the Council to order instant
  execution at our will. I am exercising that authority now."</p>

  <p>I listened to all this with a curious detachment. There seemed no question
  but that one way or another I was to be executed. It made little difference
  to me whether I died at once, or a little later.</p>

  <p>Nalinah smacked the rod against her skirt. "You have the right! Get it
  over with. I have been informed of a new experiment, the most successful thus
  far, and am in haste to inspect it."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Nalinah," Vanark said, and I thought there was a mocking
  undertone to his voice. He turned away from her. "Subaltern Hafna!" he said.
  "<i>Coret</i> this Taphet!"</p>

  <p>The officer saluted, wheeled smartly. Well, I thought, that's that. I
  should have preferred to have seen the sun once more before I died.</p>

  <p>Facing those strange weapons of the green-clad guards, watching them lift
  to blast me with whatever lethal charge they held, an old speculation drifted
  across my mind. Could they kill me, these macabre little Folk? Or was I not
  so different in structure from them, so definitely from another plane of
  existence that the effort would merely result in returning me to the world
  from whence I had come, the world of green, growing things of limpid,
  rippling waters?</p>

  <p>In that moment of final threat, my only emotion was a nostalgia for all
  that was my own, my birthright!</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>Account of Courtney Stone, M.D. resumed:</em></p><br>

  <p class="first">THERE could be no doubt that the boy, Charles Dorsey, was
  affected by the inexplicable malady that had struck down the two natives in
  the hospital, Adath Jenks and Job Grant. Driving down from Camp Wanooka, I
  tried to force myself to concentrate on that problem, tried to review once
  more the little we had learned about the wasting disease of which there was
  now a third victim. I found it impossible, however, to keep my mind from
  straying to other problems, that were hardly therapeutic but no less
  pressing.</p>

  <p>There was, for one, the question of the quarantine I had imposed on the
  few left at the camp. There would be no trouble about the Dorsey lad. He was
  an orphan and the ward of a trust company. A wire to the proper officer would
  forestall inquiries. I carried letters from the other three youngsters to
  their relatives which I hoped would delay an incursion of these for at least
  a week.</p>

  <p>What bothered me in this respect was whether I had been right in
  permitting the other campers to scatter to their homes, when a phone call
  could have caught them at the station. Were they carrying some epidemic
  broadcast?</p>

  <p>The three cases of that coma during which the vitality of its victims
  seeped slowly away were definitely endemic to Lake Wanooka. That spoke of a
  focus of infection in that locale. We had isolated no germs, no filterable
  virus by which we could transmit the affection to any of our test animals.
  This, I concluded, justified me, in my course of action.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was a bit of sophistry. I wondered what I should have done had
  I not been aware that an investment of several hundred thousand dollars
  depended on my decision. Big Money is scary, and irascible. Not five per cent
  of Wanooka's clientele would return next year if I insisted on a general
  quarantine.</p>

  <p>I persuaded myself that this aspect of the situation had not influenced me
  but I could not deny that I had agreed to keeping Hugh Lambert's
  disappearance secret for any but personal motives.</p>

  <p>The reputation of the camp had entered also into this equation. The fear
  of kidnapers is a peculiar affliction of the wealthy, and certainly Wanooka's
  patrons would be justified in arguing that if it's director could vanish
  mysteriously from its precincts, their sons would not be safe there. This was
  not, however, the clinching argument for silence.</p>

  <p>Edith Home had put it like this: "Whatever's happened to Hugh is tied up
  with what we did the night of the accident. It's useless to bring the police
  in on this unless we tell them about that. And we dare not."</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;that tramp?"</p>

  <p>"I mean that they won't believe us if we tell them what happened to the
  tramp. Nobody would. They'll think that he died as a result of the
  transfusion and that we&mdash;we&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Disposed of his body somehow. To hide&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"<i>Murder</i>."</p>

  <p>I knew a moment of terror as she said that word, quietly, without
  perceptible emotion. Then I rallied. "But Edith," I protested. "We can't let
  that stop us. We've got to do everything we can to find Hugh. If it means
  trouble for us we'll have to stand the gaff. I'll try to cover you up
  somehow, but he's my friend and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"<i>Your</i> friend!" she broke in. "What do you think he is to me?"</p>

  <p>Her hands were at her breast. Her eyes held mine. I looked into their
  agonized depths, and read her secret there.</p>

  <p>"Do you think there's anything, in the world or beyond it," she asked, "I
  would not do to help him? But we can't help."</p>

  <p>I didn't understand. I said so.</p>

  <p>"Doesn't the way his clothes were found mean anything to you?"</p>

  <p>I perceived her drift. "You think that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The same thing happened to him as happened to the tramp, or something
  very like it. What else can I think?"</p>

  <p>"Then he's gone," I groaned. "Hugh Lambert's gone. We'll never see him
  again!"</p>

  <p>Thinking it over as I drove down the road, I realized what utter nonsense
  it all was, but with Edith's eyes upon me, I had believed it. Strange how a
  man trained in science could have been swung so far off his base by a
  superstitious woman!</p>

  <p>"No," Edith had responded to that hopeless exclamation of mine. "I have a
  strange feeling that he is alive, somewhere. And a strange faith that he will
  win through and come back to us. But we can only wait; and hope that
  sometime, somehow, we shall find a way to help him. If we're to be ready for
  that, we must be free to act. That is why we must act like criminals, with a
  secret that would put us in the chair if it were found out."</p>

  <p>A criminal with a secret that would put me in the chair. That was what I
  felt like as I reached New Scotland Road at last and saw my home ahead of me,
  at the end of a long block. Waiting for a red light to turn, I actually
  cringed inwardly at the sight of the blue-uniformed traffic cop who
  manipulated it, gasped with relief when he released my car.</p>

  <p>A man stood looking at a pile of dbris on the edge of the sidewalk in
  front of my gate. I recalled that Mrs. Small had started one of her periodic
  convulsions of housecleaning that morning, remembered that, the phone from
  camp had caused me to forget to call the rubbish cart.</p>

  <p>It was Jethro Parker who looked at the heap of papers, broken curtain
  poles, pots that had outlived their usefulness. I braked the car.</p>

  <p>"What brings you here?" I asked. "You look pretty healthy."</p>

  <p>"I am," he answered. "I come to Albany to see Marthy, my wife, off on the
  train. She's goin to Providence to visit her brother for a fortnight. I was
  kind of at loose ends and I thought I'd drop by and ask you how that tramp
  made out, that had the accident up near my corn lot."</p>

  <p>"The tramp?" I hoped nothing in my face showed the sudden panic that
  leaped within me. "Oh, yes, I remember now." To hide my confusion I fumbled
  with the car door, stepped out on the sidewalk. "He&mdash;wasn't hurt badly
  at all. He was suffering from shock. Surly chap. He refused to let me do
  anything for him. Got up and went out without even telling me his name. I've
  a notion he was afraid to. Maybe the police were after him."</p>

  <p>"Got right up an went out," Parker drawled in his nasal twang. "Just like
  he was?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"That's funny."</p>

  <p>"What's funny about it?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I could swear that them rags&mdash;" he pointed at the heap of my
  housekeeper's off-scouring&mdash;"is the very clothes he wore when I picked
  him off the road."</p>

  <p>They were! When Ann Doring had come into the surgery I had stuffed the
  filthy moldering garments behind an instrument cabinet, and forgotten them. I
  stared at them now, wadded on the very top of that mound of dbris, tattered,
  mud-slimed, and accusing!</p>

  <p class="cp"><em>Hugh Lambert's narrative, resumed:</em></p>

  <p>TIME has a way of slowing up at moments of stress. I saw the little
  muscles at the corners of Subaltern Hafna's mouth gather themselves to open
  for the command that would blot me out. I saw the trio of green-uniformed
  guards waiting for that command. I saw the girl in the doorway, her look bent
  on Vanark, studying him. I had time, even, to recall that not once, while
  they had discussed my fate, had she glanced at me.</p>

  <p>"Ra Nalinah," I was surprised to find myself saying. "I am no Taphet. I am
  the one who has so long been sought in the Upper World. I am the one whom Nal
  Surah awaits."</p>

  <p>The words were gibberish to me, but they brought a sharp, "Hold it,
  Hafna!" from her. She sprang erect, stepped into the room to stare at me. Her
  eyes widened. Her lips parted, showing a white gleam.</p>

  <p>"He is fair-skinned," she murmured, thinking aloud. "But he has not the
  look of a Taphet. It may be. It may well be."</p>

  <p>"It not only may be, but is." Weird sensation, that, to hear my own voice
  saying things I not only did not think, but did not comprehend. "Ra Vanark is
  no subaltern of the labor squadron guard. Ask him how he came to be alone on
  the platform with me, if I am a Taphet. Ask him why I am clad in this suit of
  <i>sibral</i>, as he is. Ask him."</p>

  <p>Nalinah did not take her gaze from my face. "What say you to that," she
  purred, "Rata Vanark?"</p>

  <p>Realization flashed upon me that the unseen wielder of that ineluctable
  control over my acts and my speech was fighting for my life, had been
  fighting for it from the moment the guards had seized me. With the
  omniscience of which he had proven himself possessed, he had known Nalinah to
  be on her way here; had spoken, through me, exactly at the proper instant
  that would delay my execution sufficiently long for her arrival to interfere
  with it.</p>

  <p>"What concern is it of yours?" the man responded to Ra Nalinah's demand.
  "For what I do I am answerable to the Nal alone."</p>

  <p>"And to the Folk!" She turned to him, her brooding eyes upon him. "The
  Creed seems to have faded from your mind. The Folk is all," she chanted. "'I
  am nothing. The Folk will is my will, the Folk weal my weal. I die, the Folk
  exists forever.'" There was a religious, almost fanatic fervor in her tones.
  "The Folk is the master, Vanark, the Ratanit but its voice. Even the Nal.
  Even Nal Surah."</p>

  <p>Vanark's swart lip trembled, as if it would lift in a sneer, but dared
  not. There was a long minute of silence, electric with tension, with
  bristling antagonism.</p>

  <p>I sensed, from the amazed look on Hafna's face, from the startled glances
  among his men, that this strife was new in the relations of these two, or if
  not new then newly manifest. Was it to bring this about that the Other had
  delayed speaking through me again till Vanark had committed himself to a
  lie?</p>

  <p>Had even my attack on him been directed and not, as I had thought, a
  voluntary act of my own, freed from control by the swiftness of that
  descent?</p><br>

  <p class="first">IT WAS Vanark who broke the silence. "This is he for whom I
  searched in the Upper World," he admitted. "But I have found him imperfectly
  controlled, more likely to defeat our purpose than serve it." He was
  desperately trying to convey the impression that he was explaining his act,
  not apologizing for it. "I decided it were best to destroy him and return to
  our first design."</p>

  <p>"You decided!"</p>

  <p>He spread his arms wide. "Perhaps I was too hasty. Perhaps it were better
  to place the matter before the full council. I shall conduct him..."</p>

  <p>"I shall conduct him to my own quarters," Nalinah cut in, "and hold him
  till the Ratanit convene. You consent, Vanark? Or shall we refer the matter
  to the Nal, repeating to him all that has passed here?"</p>

  <p>Vanark didn't like that. I could see he didn't like it at all. He
  hesitated.</p>

  <p>Nalinah lifted her silvery rod. A low hum came from it. The device at its
  tip seemed to glow more brightly. With some surprise I perceived that its
  pierced pattern showed a central orb and nine others, smaller and of various
  sizes, circling about it. It looked amazingly like a representation of the
  Solar System. But how could that...</p>

  <p>"There is no need to disturb the Nal!" I was almost sure Vanark's
  exclamation was edged with a quiver of fear. "No need for him to know there
  has been any dispute between us. It is a matter of small moment. You may do
  as you wish."</p>

  <p>The humming stopped. "Thank you, Rata Vanark." Nalinah said it gravely,
  but as she turned to me, I surprised a dancing light in her eyes, of impish
  amusement. With somewhat of a shock I realized that she was little more than
  a girl. She had been so dignified, so almost regal, until then.</p>

  <p>"What are you called?" she asked me.</p>

  <p>"Hugh Lambert."</p>

  <p>"Hughlambert." She ran the syllables together, as Vanark had done.
  Evidently there were only single names here, terms such as Nal, Ra, Rata,
  being titles. "It is too difficult to say and to remember. I shall call you
  Hula. Come then, Hula."</p>

  <p>She turned and went out through the doorway.</p>

  <p>I strode across the floor. As I followed Nalinah out into the open I felt
  Vanark's eyes on my back. They seemed to bore into me. I knew that whatever
  the attitude of the others here might be to me, I had one implacable,
  malignant enemy...</p>

  <p>If I seem to have related these events in too great detail, I have this
  excuse. From every word that had been spoken, almost from every shadow
  flitting across the countenances of the swart speakers, I had gleaned some
  bit of information to add to my pitiful store. I was commencing to apprehend
  the weird web in which I was entangled, the nature of the strange internecine
  strifes.</p>

  <p>Most of this was still tantalizingly vague, but one fact stood out
  clearly. There was nothing accidental about my being brought here for some
  definite purpose. Though that purpose was as yet hidden from me, I knew
  somehow that it affected not me alone but the world from which I had been
  snatched. Somehow dread crept sluggishly through my veins, seeped blackly
  into my brain.</p>

  <p>How terribly justified that dread was, what the amazing intent of the
  Surahnit was, and how&mdash;desperately, hopelessly&mdash;I strove to defeat
  it, will appear as my narrative proceeds to its astounding climax, the issue
  of which I do not yet know.</p>

  <p><i>Will</i> appear, I write. I smile, wanly, bitterly, as I set those two
  words down. No human, no man or woman of the Upper World, will read this
  narrative if the die I have cast rolls against me and <i>them</i>.</p><br>

  <p class="first">I STRODE out of that guardroom where I had so nearly met
  my end. Somewhere over me there was a roof upon which great mountains rested
  but I was aware of it only as a murky, clouded sky. I was more immediately
  conscious of the loom of rock towering just behind me, yet even this was so
  incredibly altitudinous and ran to such sightless distances on either side
  that I could no longer conceive of it as a precipice. It was, rather, a limit
  to space, a boundary to reality itself. To all intents and purposes I was in
  the open.</p>

  <p>The ground across which I was being Impelled was not earth but stone. It
  was imbued with the eerie glow that permeated all things here, but here the
  luminance was dark and secretive, and the uneven surface within which that
  glow seemed imperceptibly to pulsate was the surface of a frozen flow.</p>

  <p>This was rock that once had been molten, rock that was rigid now in
  whatever queer twisting of shape the fading of its heat had left it. It was
  igneous rock. It was the naked primal matter of our whirling planet.</p>

  <p>I knew now how very deep this land must be, how close to Earth's heart I
  had penetrated, and how remote I was from the world I had known.</p>

  <p>It rolled away from me, this plain of congealed stone, and it lifted as it
  rolled so that its cresting ridges circumscribed my vision within a radius of
  perhaps a hundred yards. Motionless now, some twenty feet ahead, Nalinah
  awaited me, her dusky lips curved in a half smile, and beside her was
  something new to my experience.</p>

  <p>I guessed this thing to be a vehicle of sorts, because, and only because,
  it was poised in the center of a wide swathe of rock evidently artificially
  smoothened to make a road running off, straightaway to some unguessable
  destination.</p>

  <p>At its highest the contrivance rose barely above the golden glory of
  Nalinah's hair. From there it curved forward to a bulbous nose and pitched
  backward to a pointed tail. Its sides and its bottom duplicated the curve of
  its roof so that, albeit with an amazing appearance of rigidity, it was
  balanced on a single point of its under structure.</p>

  <p>Puzzling me almost as much as how this could possibly be accomplished,
  there was no aperture visible anywhere in the dull red walls of the device;
  no door, no window.</p>

  <p>"Have you then, Hula, no <i>lusan</i> in that Upper World of yours,"
  Nalinah purred as I came up to her, "that you appear so bemused?"</p>

  <p>"Is that what you call it?" I asked, inanely. "How do you get into
  it?"</p>

  <p>"See." She twisted to it. Her heel caught in some inequality of her
  footing and she stumbled against me. I threw an arm around her, to save her
  from falling.</p>

  <p>A pulse pounded in my wrists. She was crushed against me, soft, and
  yielding, and ineffably feminine. The fragrance of her was in my nostrils.
  Her hair brushed my cheek and her warmth enfolded me, an aura of exquisite
  allure. My arm tightened...</p>

  <p>I heard&mdash;I distinctly heard, I tell you&mdash;a strain of music,
  <i>within me</i>! The blast of a warning horn. Full-throated arpeggios, like
  the blast of a soaring wind. The rush of wings, of the wings of the
  Valkyries. The twittering calls of the harpies, beautiful as heaven&mdash;and
  evil as hell itself.</p>

  <p>Abruptly I was back in Wanooka's rec hall, poignantly conscious of Ann
  Doring's nearness...I set Nalinah firmly on her feet, releasing her.</p>

  <p>"See," she said again, and it seemed to me there was a quiver in her
  voice. She touched the <i>lusan's</i> side with her wand. A circular hole
  appeared in the metal wall, widened from the point of its first appearance as
  a camera shutter's iris diaphragm opens to uncover its lens. At once there
  was an aperture large enough to admit a man. Within I glimpsed a cushioned
  seat, a brightly gleaming lever.</p>

  <p>Queerly I still heard the rush of wings, the twittering, faint now, and
  trifling sweetly. But it was no longer music and it was no longer within my
  skull. I looked up to whence the sounds seemed now to come.</p>

  <p>The sheer, unearthly beauty of what I saw caught me by the throat. High
  above, a covey of white birds paralleled the cliff in graceful flight. Their
  bodies were chastely white, but their outspread great wings were a shimmer of
  iridescent color, frail webs woven from light that had splintered into all
  the infinite hues of the spectrum. They filled the air with multihued facets
  of jeweled motes. Each was a glittering glory in itself, the whole was a
  sparkling rainbow, a congeries of a million rainbows, sweeping across the
  sky.</p>

  <p>Over them arched the drab vault of a gloomy sky. Backgrounding them was
  the ominous gray of that gigantic wall.</p>

  <p>A single bird veered, abruptly, out of the flock and darted for that wall.
  The twitterings rose to a chorus of alarm. A pencil-thin, scarlet beam
  streaked up from the ground.</p>

  <p>The bird's shriek was a scream of human agony! One of its marvelous wings
  had vanished! Its companions shot away, too evidently abandoning it to its
  fate. It sideslipped, plummeted downward.</p>

  <p>The remaining wing caught it, held it suspended for one heart-breaking
  instant.</p>

  <p>"That's no bird!" I gasped. "It's a woman!"</p>

  <p>The slender, delicately formed body, contorted now in agony, was a
  white-clad human shape. Long hair, lustrously black, cascaded about a
  staring, tortured face.</p>

    <p class="caption">The slender, delicately-formed body was contorted now in
    agony...</p>
  </div>

  <p>The wing's momentary hold was gone. She went down, was hidden by a jutting
  vertical fold of the precipice. I heard a sickening thud.</p>

  <p>A moment later, a green-uniformed man left the guardroom entrance, his
  <i>coret</i> in his hand. He strolled leisurely along the base of the cliff,
  toward the spur that hid his victim from me.</p>

  <p>"Kut's aim was poor," Nalinah said behind me. "I must have Hafna
  instructed to send him back to the ranges."</p>

  <p>I whirled to her. "That was a girl!"</p>

  <p>She seemed mildly surprised at my perturbation. "A Taphet, Hula," she
  shrugged. "Their women are the worst." Then, as if that was explanation
  enough for the murder, she said, "Come. Nal Surah awaits us."</p>

  <p>Her hand gestured to the <i>lusan</i>. I had to enter it.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>Account of Courtney Stone, M.D., resumed:</em></p><br>

  <p class="first">I WAS uncertain whether Jethro Parker's questions had been
  as casual as they seemed, or whether he had deliberately trapped me.
  Whichever it was, I knew that I could not now deceive him by any hastily
  contrived tale of having given the tramp one of my old suits before he left.
  Parker would have known instantly that I lied, if only because, in that case,
  I should have at once gotten rid of disease-breeding rags he discarded and
  not kept them around for two weeks.</p>

  <p>They may be uncouth, these farmer folk of the Helderbergs, and
  ungrammatical in their speech, but they have a native shrewdness most
  scientists might well envy.</p>

  <p>They have also insatiable curiosity and a straight-lined honesty with
  which it is impossible to tamper.</p>

  <p>Parker, I was certain, would not stop now until he had unearthed exactly
  what had happened to the tramp, and he could not be kept from reporting the
  occurrence to the police.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said. "There isn't any doubt those are the tramp's clothes. Come
  inside and I'll tell you about him."</p>

  <p>I took the farmer into my office and shut the door. "Sit down," I said. "I
  always take a snifter about this time in the afternoon. Will you join
  me?"</p>

  <p>Parker rubbed his great, bony hands on his knees. He was perched on the
  edge of the chair I had indicated and he was looking about him uncomfortably.
  Laymen are always ill at ease in the purlieus of a physician's office.</p>

  <p>"That was grand liquor you give me the other day," he said. "Sure, I'll
  have a drink."</p>

  <p>I went into the surgery and brought back two medicine glasses filled with
  the dark amber liquid. I gave him one. He downed it at a gulp.</p>

  <p>I thumped my own emptied glass on the desk, and said, "All right, now,
  Parker, I'm ready to confess."</p>

  <p>"Confess!"</p>

  <p>He was so startled his glass fell from his fingers.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" I leaned over him, my palms on the desk. "Remember, you thought
  there was something strange about the tramp, that night, and I laughed at
  you? You were right and I was wrong. He was a strange bird."</p>

  <p>The man's eyes widened. "Strange," he said huskily. His eyes widened; but
  the irises did not. My gaze shifted to his forehead, where the throbbing of
  the sinistral temporal artery, was quite visible. "As how?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know how," I whispered. "I don't know. But wouldn't you call it
  strange if a man vanished right in front of your eyes, if he got smaller and
  smaller while you watched him, till he wasn't there at all?"</p>

  <p>"The tramp did that?" He mumbled the words, thick-tongued. "Got
  smaller..." The pulse in his temple slowed perceptibly, his pupils were
  shrinking to pinpoints.</p>

  <p>"And vanished. You believe me don't you?" I whispered. "You believe what I
  am telling you?"</p>

  <p>"No." I had expected that reaction. "No."</p>

  <p>He shoved himself up out of his chair.</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;you're foolin' me. You're lyin' to me. You did somethin to him
  and now you're tryin' to lie out of it."</p>

  <p>I threw my arms wide. "All right, Parker," I murmured. "You can't blame me
  for trying."</p>

  <p>"I'm&mdash;I'm goin to&mdash;the cops and tell em." He started for the
  door. "Let them figure out what to do."</p>

  <p>"Wait," I called quietly. "I'm going with you. I thought I would try the
  story out on you. If you believed it maybe everybody would believe it. But I
  see it's no use. I might as well go with you and give myself up."</p>

  <p>I had my hat and coat on and I was going out through the hall with Parker.
  He stumbled a little and I caught hold of his arm just as I saw my
  housekeeper's face peering over the upper railing of the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Parker is ill," I called to her. "I'm taking him home. Please phone
  the hospital I will not make rounds today, and mail the letters I've left on
  my desk." To the farmer I said, low-toned, "No use telling her yet. She will
  know soon enough."</p>

  <p>I had to support him as he went down the path, had to almost lift him into
  the car. I got around to the left, got in behind the wheel, and he slumped
  against me.</p>

  <p>"Straighten up," I snapped at him, savagely, as I let in the gears. His
  obedience to that command was almost purely reflex, but he sat erect enough
  to attract no attention from neighboring cars, from the traffic officer at
  that light on the corner. When he finally slumped down in the seat and went
  frankly asleep it did not matter any longer. We were on the open road and I
  was driving, as fast as I dared, toward Camp Wanooka.</p>

  <p>The dose of chloral I had measured into his glass had been exactly right.
  I had distracted his attention from its distinctive taste by startling him.
  With exact timing, guided by my ocular taking of his pulse, I had contrived
  to have him walk out to my sedan under his own power before the sedative took
  full effect.</p>

  <p>I would satisfy the men at the camp, when I drove him up to the infirmary,
  by saying I had stopped at his home on the way down and finding him in coma
  had decided to bring him there so that I could give him more of my personal
  attention than he would receive at the hospital. After that. Edith and I
  could keep him asleep until&mdash;</p>

  <p>Until when? That was as far as my plan had formed. The rest was in the lap
  of the gods.</p>

  <p>I had done all this, I, Courtney Stone, M.D. In the parlance of the
  underworld I had doped a man and shanghaied him. It wasn't pretty. But, given
  all that had gone before, what else was there for me to do?</p>

  <p>Edith Horne had convinced me, you see, that for Hugh Lambert's sake we
  must both be at liberty, free to help him when he should call for our help.
  If I had not silenced Jethro Parker we should both have been in prison by
  night.</p>

  <p>It needed no imagination now to make me out a criminal. I was one in very
  truth. Curiously enough, I rather liked the idea. My life till now had been
  so much a matter of stodgy, deadening routine.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-04"
     id="ch-04"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p class="cp"><em>Narrative of Hugh Lambert, resumed:</em></p><br>

  <p class="first">NALINAH came into the <i>lusan</i> and took her place beside me.
  The opening shut itself. I have said the strange shell had no window. That is
  true. Yet enclosed within it, I still saw the smoothed road ahead.</p>

  <p>No, the metal was not transparent. A screen was suspended vertically
  before us, and on this the road was pictured, vividly and in its natural
  colors, as though on the eyepiece of a periscope; except that this image was
  right side up and not reversed.</p>

  <p>I wondered why the builders of the vehicle had gone to the trouble of
  contriving what must be an intricate optical device when a pane of glass
  would have been so much simpler. Nalinah touched the lever, and then I
  knew.</p>

  <p>The ridge at which I was gazing flashed down and out of the screen. The
  long, straight road seethed toward us out of a vast, dreary plain. On either
  side of us there was only a rushing, featureless gray blur. No glass thin
  enough to be transparent could have withstood that incredible speed.</p>

  <p><a id="pic4"

         title="Illustration">

    <p class="caption">The fingers of a gelid dread tightened on my heart as I
    looked upon him who had been dead.</p>
  </div>

  <p>There was just room enough for the two of us between the <i>lusan's</i>
  curving walls. I was clothed only in that single; tight garment of
  <i>sibral</i>; and it was evident that under the girl's rainbow-hued frock
  there was not much more.</p>

  <p>Recalling Nalinah's shrug, her unfeeling comment on the death of that
  gorgeous creature of the air a steel plate might as well have intervened for
  all the effect her closeness had upon me.</p>

  <p>"Why did she have to be killed?"</p>

  <p>"It is forbidden for a Taphet to approach the wall," Nalinah replied,
  "except under orders and closely guarded."</p>

  <p>"Was her crime so great that she had to be killed?"</p>

  <p>"There is only one crime in Mernia, disobedience of the Law. There is only
  one punishment, death." The harsh statement seemed utterly incongruous coming
  from those tender, girlish lips: "The Folk cannot tolerate unsocial conduct,
  no matter how slight."</p>

  <p>I asked, "Is life then so cheap in your Mernia?"</p>

  <p>"Only the life of the Folk matters, only its weal. The guard who flashed
  her with his <i>coret</i> did not slay that Taphet. She slew herself. From
  the moment she violated an edict of the Law, she was dead. Kut merely
  disposed of a body that had forfeited its right to existence."</p>

  <p>I shook my head in bewilderment. "I don't understand."</p>

  <p>Nalinah's brow wrinkled. "Look you, Hula," she said, speaking slowly and
  distinctly, as if explaining something to a child. "Do not some cells in the
  body of one of your kind, having been injured or altered by some disease,
  sometimes cease to perform the function for which they are designed?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Of course."</p>

  <p>"And do they not then become a danger to the body of which they are a
  part, at first latent and then actively as their nature changes and they
  become maleficent? Diseased?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Do you permit these cells to corrupt other cells, till the whole body
  rots and is destroyed?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally not. We get rid of them, cut them out or burn them out, or
  destroy them with some&mdash;some antiseptic."</p>

  <p>"Is not the Folk, the state, a living organism composed of a multitude of
  smaller living organisms, just as your body is composed of cells?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>The small oval of Nalinah's face lit up with triumph. "They why is it not
  right, that when some of these smaller organisms; these individuals, fail to
  function properly for the welfare of the whole body; the whole Folk&mdash;why
  is it not right that they too should be destroyed, mercilessly, lest
  remaining they corrupt other individuals till the whole state is rotten and
  is destroyed?"</p><br>

  <p class="first">IT WAS a ruthless philosophy, I thought, gazing into the
  screen. My eye followed the streaking ribbon of road till, infinitely
  distant, it narrowed to a point. The landscape there was too far off to be
  veiled by our speed, and I was able to make out some of its details. There
  were nowhere any trees, any greensward. There was only the dead rock; barren,
  infertile, Desolate.</p>

  <p>"Your argument is specious," I said slowly. "But the analogy on which it
  is founded is a false one. The important thing in the conglomerate of cells
  that compose a human body is the body itself and the soul it houses. The
  important thing in a nation is the individuals that compose it. Cells exist
  to serve the body. The state, the social organization, exists to provide for
  the well-being of its citizens."</p>

  <p>A gray mass appeared on the horizon. It grew rapidly as we neared it,
  became a high-piled, frowning wall. We topped a rise higher than most and for
  an instant I saw over that wall. There were buildings within it, streets
  swarming with traffic.</p>

  <p>"Calinore," Nalinah said, answering the question in my eyes. "Home of the
  Taphetnit." She returned to our discourse. "You have no laws, then?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Of course we have laws, but they are made and administered for the
  greatest good of the greatest number. I heard you repeat what you called your
  Creed, a little while ago. We too have our fundamental Law, and it states its
  object thus: To establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity...promote the
  general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our
  posterity..."</p>

  <p>There was a wistful quality to Nalinah's smile.</p>

  <p>"'Insure domestic tranquillity, promote the general welfare, secure the
  blessings of liberty....'" I repeated. "How beautiful it sounds. Does your
  Law do all these things, Hula?"</p>

  <p>"It was so intended."</p>

  <p>"I asked if it <i>did</i> them."</p>

  <p>I thought of two lines of men I had seen on the docks of San Francisco,
  grimly facing one another; those composing one gaunt-faced, pinch-bellied,
  and bitter eyed; the others blue-jowled, stalwart shouldered, their gnarled
  fists grasping tear-gas bombs, waiting for the word to throw them. I thought
  of hollow-eyed, dull-faced little children bent over the treadles of a
  spinning mill, the sun not risen yet; and I thought of a court that had said
  the law of which I boasted forbade the stopping of this crime.</p>

  <p>I thought of all this, and far more, and I said: "The Law would do all
  these things if we lived according to the spirit of the Law. It does not
  wholly succeed because, of the men we choose to interpret and administer it,
  some are selfish, some venial, some merely fools."</p>

  <p>"Selfish. Venial. Fools. Are there none among you who are unselfish,
  unbribable and wise?"</p>

  <p>"A great many."</p>

  <p>"But why permit the others to carry out this wonderful Law of yours?"</p>

  <p>How nave that question was! And yet...</p>

  <p>I kept silent, the changing images in the screen my excuse. We had flashed
  past Calinore, and now there was a change in the plain. It seemed softer,
  warmer somehow in hue. There were crops of some kind growing upon it.</p>

  <p>What those crops were or how they were induced to grow out of the rock, I
  could not make even a guess, for when they were near enough for me to have
  examined them closely they were swallowed up in the streaking gray blur of
  our speed. Nevertheless their being there at all was yet a scientific
  miracle.</p>

  <p>"I am convinced." I realized that Nalinah was no longer speaking to me, but
  thinking aloud. "Nal Surah is right. We have tarried here too long, in this
  barren and desolate land. Our place is in the sun."</p>

  <p>"You will be welcome," I said. It was for this, then, that I had been
  brought to Mernia. I was to be an ambassador from the Little Folk to the
  Upper World. My forebodings had been unwarranted. "I am sure I can arrange
  permission for you to come among us." My mind was already busy with plans.
  Although the fertile regions of Earth's surface were overcrowded, a people
  who made livable a land of bare rock would find in our deserts, our tundras,
  a veritable Paradise.</p>

  <p>"Permission?" Nalinah seemed surprised. "We shall take what we wish."</p>

  <p>I didn't get it, at first. "Take!" I chuckled. "Maybe we'll have something
  to say about <i>that</i>."</p>

  <p>"Your people will have as little to say about it as you, have had about
  coming here, my Hula, and what you have done since you came here." There was
  nothing grim, nothing threatening about the way she said it. Her tone was
  quite matter-of-fact. "When we are ready to bring the blessings of Mernian
  civilization and science to your barbarian race, your benighted race who do
  not know even how to govern themselves, we shall do it, and you shall be
  helpless against us."</p>

  <p>She is talking nonsense, I thought. What can they do against us, these
  tiny people against the giants that we were to them, these few against our
  hordes?</p>

  <p>And then I recalled what I knew already of their powers. I recalled how
  the tramp had vanished. I recalled how utterly unable I had been to struggle
  against the grip they had upon me. I remembered the corpse I had seen brought
  back to life...</p>

  <p>"We need only to learn a little more about those whom we shall conquer,"
  Nalinah was saying. "It is you, Hula, who shall tell us what we need to
  know."</p>

  <p>"I'll be damned if I will!"</p>

  <p>She laughed at me. The <i>lusan</i> was filled with the trill of her
  girlish, merry laughter.</p>

  <p>There was something horribly sinister about that laugh.</p><br>

  <p class="first">RA NALINAH'S laugh was sinister with its implication of my
  utter helplessness against the forces of which she and her people were
  masters. Yet curiously enough, it warmed me to her, calming in the moment it
  was born, the rage her astounding statement had aroused in me!</p>

  <p>There was in that silvery trill and in the glorious countenance she turned
  to me, a soft caress, almost as if she brushed my lips with the dusky velvet
  of her own.</p>

  <p>More than any other of the strange folk who people this adventure of mine,
  which is too fantastically unreal to be a dream. I shall carry the thought of
  Nalinah with me into the oblivion that is death. Since first she had appeared
  in the doorway of what so narrowly had missed being my execution chamber. I
  had seen her imperious and regal as an affronted empress; wide-eyed and
  fluttered as a sub-deb at the sight of a new male; artfully seductive as a
  courtesan of the <i>Petit Trianon</i>; callously cruel as, a Borgia. She had
  been, only a moment ago; a keen-minded analyst of politico-economic systems;
  as the representative of a super-race she had announced their intention of a
  world-conquest that would brook no opposition and conceived no possibility of
  defeat.</p>

  <p>Now Nalinah, wise with the ageless, instinctive wisdom of her sex, covered
  with a laugh her heartache over the man child who strutted brash defiance of
  a doom she knew must overwhelm him.</p>

  <p>Yes, there was mocking gaiety in her laugh; but there was also pity!</p>

  <p>Because of that, the interior of the rushing <i>lusan</i> was chilly with
  a fear that struck into my very bones. But I said quite calmly, quite
  steadily:</p>

  <p>"If you and your people, Ra Nalinah will come among mine as friends; I
  shall be happy to do everything in my power to help you. If you come as
  enemies, Satan himself could not compel me to stir so much as my little
  finger to aid&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A screaming hell of sound battered at me. Nalinah jerked the
  <i>lusan's</i> control lever toward her, her pupils abruptly widened to dark
  pits, her face lined and suddenly pallid! I catapulted out of my seat,
  crashed agonizingly against the visual screen!</p>

  <p>My legs, arms, skull burst with the surge of blood forced to them by the
  sudden checking of our tremendous speed. Half stunned, I heard Nalinah's
  scream, managed to twist.</p>

  <p>The girl's clutch tore loose from the lever. In the flashing split second
  before she would strike it, I thrust myself sidewise along the wall to which
  I was pinned, took the impact of her soft form on my own, cushioning the blow
  that certainly would have maimed her.</p>

  <p>What little breath I had left was smashed out of me. I pounded with
  Nalinah down into the narrow space between screen and seat-base. Then we were
  tailing again.</p>

  <p>Jackknifing in mid-air, I contrived to get between the girl and the metal
  just as we struck. I folded her in my arms. I saw the lever spearing down to
  impale us. I jammed a foot into a corner, crooked a knee over that
  threatening handle, and clung like that while the crazy, bounding, roll
  continued.</p>

  <p>It slackened, stopped...</p>

  <p>The floor of the vehicle pitched steeply forward. Nalinah was a limp,
  unconscious bundle in my arms. I shifted her, and twisted to get my knee free
  of the lever. The screen came across my vision and, oddly canted in its
  depths, I saw a field through whose stand of some vividly orange crop
  ploughed the wide furrow of the <i>lusan's</i> mad plunge. Across this field
  a score of white-faced Taphetnit, their outspread wings a rainbow shimmer
  about them, streamed toward us with high, awkward bounds.</p>

  <p>Dazedly lifting Nalinah to the seat, I wondered why our rescuers were not
  flying.</p>

  <p>The image of their leader expanded to fill the screen like a movie
  close-up. I saw that those glorious wings of his were cruelly cropped, and
  knew why they did not fly.</p>

  <p>He went past. Behind them I glimpsed a green-uniformed soldier on the
  ground, contorted and very still. I saw another guard; his belly ripped open.
  I caught sight of the road from which the tusan had been flung.</p>

  <p>Grating metal whirled me to the side wall. It was pierced by a circle of
  light that opened out from its own center. The Taphet was right outside,
  waiting for the aperture to grow wide enough to admit him.</p>

  <p>I crouched. The murdered guards; my flashing glimpse of a pit in the road
  that had been skilfully masked to trap the <i>lusan</i>, had warned me that
  the wreck was no accident, but a trap.</p>

  <p>The Taphet leaned in, reaching for Nalinah's recumbent form. I leaped,
  smashed a fist into his face. Bones crushed under my knuckles. My momentum
  hurled me out of the <i>lusan</i>. The Taphet went down, but I snatched, at
  the edge of the entrance, managed to hold to my feet.</p>

  <p>Another of the winged men sprang at me, flailing something that looked
  like a hoe at my head. I ducked under it, buried a one-two in his
  midriff.</p>

  <p>Hands grabbed my ankles, living weight pounced on my back. I stumbled
  flailing out, and was swamped under a heaving, tossing mass of the Taphetnit.
  I was on the ground, my face being pressed into rock, my arms, my legs
  pinioned and useless.</p>

  <p>Blows battered me, stinging but ineffectual because the attackers were in
  each other's way. That gave me a moment to realize that I was overwhelmed,
  that they would finish me off first, then...</p>

  <p>Their twitterings, shrill, excited, told me they were getting organized.
  One by one they extricated themselves from the pile.</p><br>

  <p class="first">WHEN I judged only one or two Taphetnit remained on my back
  I heaved upward, came up easily. Too easily! I whirled to face the
  marauders.</p>

  <p>One sprawled headlong where he had been flung by my leap. Another
  staggered, fighting to catch his footing.</p>

  <p>There were only two of them! Where were the others?</p>

  <p>The standing Taphet was suddenly rigid. Then&mdash;I pulled a hand across
  my eyes&mdash;he was <i>blurring!</i></p>

  <p>The surfaces of the winged figure at which I stared were wavering and
  losing definition. Details merged into one another as though he were a waxen
  statue exposed to the blasting heat of a furnace. Just like that he was
  melting, was running together!</p>

  <p>There was agony in the Taphet's face, such agony as I hope never to look
  upon again, and then there was no face at all. There was no Taphet, only an
  irregularly shaped pillar whose outlines changed constantly as it shrank.
  Runnels of viscid liquid dripped from it. It toppled, splashed in a great
  pool that glistened yellow on the ground, dissolved.</p>

  <p>The beat of frantic wings tore my gaze from that horror. The last Taphet
  was fighting to get to his feet. A flash of light flicked to him, and he was
  immobile, his frozen pinions shining with splendor. At once he too began to
  melt.</p>

  <p>The flash seemed to have come from the direction of the <i>lusan</i>. I
  looked there. Nalinah was tensed just outside its entrance. She held her
  curious wand high before her and the tiny sun at the center of the device
  blazed hot and dazzling as if it were veritably a miniature sun.</p>

  <p>The glare was fading, its lethal task accomplished. Of the score of
  Taphetnit who had attacked us, nothing but that glistening pool was left. The
  grisly fluid lapped around a half dozen metallic implements whose use I could
  not make out; then settled to a gruesome stillness.</p>

  <p>At the very edge of the pond a single iridescent feather floated.</p>

  <p>"They <i>planned</i> to kill me, Hula." Nalinah brought me back to
  realization that we were both alive who, were it not for the awful power of
  her wand, would be corpses now. "See there," she pointed, "behind that
  tumbled stack of harvested <i>fortlik</i>, the opening of the tunnel they
  bored to undermine the road. When they saw my <i>lusan</i> approaching they
  killed their guards and sought to slay me."</p>

  <p>There was in her tones only a kind of uncomprehending wonderment. Just so
  had a small boy I once overheard in Gramercy Park sounded as he said to the
  nurse from whose side he had strayed to become embroiled with an urchin of
  the slums, "He hit me, Nana. I only said hello and he hit me."</p>

  <p>I went gingerly around the yellow pool to the girl's side. I forced my
  lips to grin, wryly. "It was a good thing you came to so quickly."</p>

  <p>I tried not to think of why it was a good thing. I tried not to think of
  that slip of a maid deliberately, coldly, efficiently, extinguishing twenty
  living beings.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she agreed, and turned to gaze at the <i>lusan</i>. "It is
  staunch," she pondered. "It is injured not at all. If it could be gotten back
  to the road it would function as well as before."</p>

  <p>I was bruised, battered, aching with pain and exhaustion. Twice in the
  cataclysmic moments just past I had saved her from injury, from death, and
  she knew it. If she had thanked me I should have disclaimed her gratitude.
  But this calm acceptance of what I had done, this matter-of-fact ignoring of
  it, angered me.</p>

  <p>"Look here," I burst out, hotly. "Do you realize&mdash;<i>Look out!</i>
  There are more of them coming!" I grabbed her arm. "Get into the
  <i>lusan</i>! We'll be able to defend ourselves better from inside."</p>

  <p>She twitched out of my grasp, swung around.</p>

  <p>"Where?" she gasped.</p>

  <p>I flung a pointing finger to the dots I had glimpsed speeding toward us
  across the flaming terrain. "There. Don't you see them?"</p>

  <p>She was laughing once more, laughing at me! "Those are not Taphetnit, my
  Hula. They are an emergency troop of the labor squadron guard. It has taken
  them long enough to appear."</p>

  <p>I saw then that though only one small group was in motion, other figures
  speckled the horizon, completely circumscribing us. Silent silhouettes
  against the drab sky, they watched us from afar, and it came to me that,
  wing-cropped as the Taphetnit had been, they could not possibly have hoped to
  escape that ominous ring.</p>

  <p>I said something to that effect. "Yes," Nalinah agreed. "They knew that in
  attacking me they condemned themselves to certain death...Just think that
  such devotion would be worth to the Folk, were the Taphetnit willing to
  serve Mernia as they serve their own fantastic philosophy."</p>

  <p>I recalled that futile sacrifice later, when I learned what philosophy it
  was she called fantastic; but now I had no time to respond. The foremost of
  the oncoming guard had reached us.</p><br>

  <p class="first">HE CLICKED heels, saluted.
  
  <p>"<i>Gor-Surah</i>, Ra Nalinah," he greeted her crisply.
  
  <p>"<i>Gor Surah</i>, Colonel Skoolteh." She went
  through one of her amazing metamorphoses, and was once more a figure of
  imperious hauteur. "How is it that this outrage could occur in your
  district?"</p>

  <p>"Outrage?"</p>

  <p>She told him what had happened.
  
  <p>"You reported this region completely under control," she ended angrily.</p>

  <p>"I did," Skoolteh was taller than Vanark or Hafna, older, the tight black,
  cap of his hair graying at the temples. Every line of his erect form spoke
  of, the habit of military dignity long ingrained. "The Taphetnit laboring
  here had been altogether amenable. We were short-handed and I had every
  reason to believe it would be safe to leave only a skeleton guard here,
  transferring the men thus released to the fields nearer Calinore where
  there have been so many outbreaks of late."</p>

  <p>"It is evident that was part of their scheme," Nalinah retorted. "They had
  observed that I always followed this route on my visit to Gateway Wall during
  the past few <i>steena</i> [periods of approximately a week]. Apparently the
  conspiracy is widespread. They contrived that the Taphetnit working here
  should be as scantily guarded as possible, so that they might carry out their
  attack on me with little risk of discovery or interference."</p>

  <p>"Not <i>their</i> plan, Ra Nalinah," Skoolteh glanced around. His men were
  drawn up in rank, well beyond earshot. "No Taphet has the capacity to plan so
  well. They carried out the plot but it could only have been formed in the
  brain of a Surahnit."</p>

  <p>Nalinah's nostrils twitched once. "You but seek to minimize your shame,
  that you should have been so deceived by the flutter-minded Taphetnit," she
  said coldly. "You know as well as I that no Surahnit could be so recreant to
  the Folk weal."</p>

  <p>"No?" The officer's smile was as frosty as the girl's voice. "Has the Ra
  forgotten the Surahnit Battalion that formed the spearpoint of the Taphetnit
  attack upon our city of Tashma seventeen <i>sloonit</i> [years] ago?"</p>

  <p>"What Mernian tot has not been taught that tale? It is you, Colonel
  Skoolteh, who seem to have forgotten how the wrath of Nal Surah went out
  against the traitors, and how they were extirpated root and branch."</p>

  <p>Nalinah gestured to the pool at our feet, drying already and
  green-scummed. The small motion made plain how the renegades had been
  punished.</p>

  <p>"The wings of the rebel Taphetnit were Cropped, and from them the labor
  squadrons were formed, so that through the rest of their life they might
  expiate their crime," she went on. "But of the Surahnit who led them not a
  drop of blood was left in all Mernia. From Wall to Wall they and their
  families were hunted down, and they were herded in the Central Plaza.</p>

  <p>"I was there, Colonel Skoolteh. It is my earliest memory, how my mother
  held me high, a tot of two <i>sloonit</i>, so that I could see over the heads of
  the throng and watch them perish&mdash;old men and young, Mothers, wives and
  sisters, sons and daughters&mdash;in the glorious purge."</p>

  <p>Something of a long ago horror, never obliterated, crawled in the cerulean
  depths of her eyes, belying the adjective with which she had described that
  holocaust. "None escaped. None at all."</p>

  <p>"<i>One</i> did escape." Skoolteh was a graven image, staring straight
  ahead of him, only his lips moving. "A baby boy. A subaltern then, I had
  become separated from the squad of troops I commanded. I saw him borne off
  between the wings of a fleeing Taphet. I could have brought both down with my
  <i>coret</i>, but I did not."</p>

  <p>"That boy, if he still lives, would be eighteen now. Ra Nalinah! Some
  <i>roha</i> [hours] ago it was reported that our search rays have spied out a
  Surahnit in Calinore, where by the Law no Surahnit may dwell. A lad of about
  eighteen. The Nal has already made demand for his delivery. There has been no
  reply as yet. If that reply should be negative, it will be my duty to lead a
  force against Calinore and take the boy from the Taphetnit who shelter
  him."</p>

  <p>The girl appeared not to have heard the latter part of Skoolteh's
  statement. "You permitted the offspring of a traitor to escape the
  purge?"</p>

  <p>"His mother was the wife of my dearest friend."</p>

  <p>"He ceased to be your friend when he turned renegade."</p>

  <p>"I had ceased to be <i>his</i> friend long since. The boy&mdash;was my
  son."</p>

  <p>"Your son!" Nalinah paled with fury. She took a step toward the colonel,
  her wand rising. "You violated the strictest law of Mernia, committed a
  second and more loathsome crime because of your offense. You, most trusted of
  the Nal's officers!"</p>

  <p>Skoolteh's hand darted to his belt, flashed away again, a <i>coret</i>
  clenched in his webbed fingers. Before either of us could move, a scarlet ray
  streaked from the weapon's splayed muzzle.</p>

  <p>The smell of burned flesh stung my nostrils. The body that crumpled to the
  ground in front of me had no head. I saw the charred place where it had set
  so proudly. I saw the edge of a green uniform-collar smoulder briefly and
  black out.</p>

  <p>Colonel Skoolteh had resigned his command.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>Hugh Lambert's Narrative, resumed:</em></p><br>

  <p class="first">"HE'S killed himself," I exclaimed. "He&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Nalinah's somber look came away from Colonel Skoolteh's beheaded
  corpse. "He has cheated the Law."</p>

  <p>She fingered that silvery wand of hers. Recalling the agony that had been
  on the Taphet's face in the moment before it was a face no longer, I knew
  very clearly why the man had chosen the <i>coret's</i> death.</p>

  <p>"But the evil he spawned still lives. I must get to Tashna at once." She
  turned toward Skoolteh's squad, beckoned.</p>

  <p>They had remained at attention, so rigid their discipline that they had
  not stirred even when they saw their commander drop. Now, at Nalinah's
  signal, one stalked stiffly toward us. He halted two paces from the Ra and
  saluted her. His toes almost touched the colonel's body, but for all the
  expression on his swarthy countenance the ground might have been bare.</p>

  <p>Nalinah's arm dropped from her answering salute. "Sergeant," she snapped,
  "have my <i>lusan</i> replaced on the road, on the Tashna side of where it
  was undermined."</p>

  <p>"Very well!" the non-com responded. He saluted, spun on his heels. His
  left arm shot above his head, jerked in swift, crisp movements to either side
  of the vertical.</p>

  <p>From the point on the horizon he faced, some of the watching forms
  vanished. I understood that he had semaphored an order, was being obeyed.</p>

  <p>"Let us move aside," Nalinah said to me. "We shall be in their way
  here."</p>

  <p>I was glad she made the suggestion. The stench from the puddle over which
  we stood was unpleasant to say the least. We walked a little way off; the
  girl very silent and thoughtful at my side.</p>

  <p>The tall orange grass she had called <i>fortlik</i> rustled against our
  knees. The luminous stalks were about the diameter of my forefinger. They
  rose almost straight from the ground. The broad, pointed leaves sheathed the
  stems with their bases, and then curved gracefully outward. Here and there
  along the plant's height, oval clumps, the thickness and length of my thumb,
  were tipped by tiny, tassels of a silken, lighter colored fiber.</p>

  <p>I plucked one of these, stripped off its covering. I was holding a wee ear
  of corn, its kernels just about the size of grains of wheat.</p>

  <p>But if this were corn already ripe, I thought, the stalks should be well
  above our heads. Then for the first time since I had passed through the
  grisly morgue high within what the girl had called the Gateway Wall, I
  remembered the diminished scale I must apply to everything I saw in Mernia.
  By the measurements of my own world, this corn was four inches tall.</p>

  <p>There was no soil. There was only lava-like, darkly glowing rock. It was
  deeply scored by lines too straight to be anything but the handiwork of man.
  Within those almost thread-narrow ruts, running water glistened, washing the
  <i>fortlik's</i> roots!</p>

  <p>This great field, the whole vast expanse of growing things I had glimpsed
  on the <i>lusan's</i> rushing journey, was artificially Irrigated! The Little
  Folk had with infinite labor scratched into hard rock a myriad of tiny
  channels to make its barrenness fertile!</p>

  <p>"Where does the water come from?" I voiced the next question that came to
  me. "I've seen no streams anywhere."</p>

  <p>Nalinah came out of her reverie. "It seeps out of the Western Wall."</p>

  <p>"I can imagine that some porosity in the rock there might permit
  sufficient water to seep through from some subterranean stream to give you
  enough for your needs while not threatening to overwhelm you as long as its
  use keeps pace with its inflow. But plants need more than water to grow. Is
  that seepage also imbued with the food they require?"</p>

  <p>"No. That which flows out of the Wall is water only. It is led to certain
  great basins there in the West, to which also are conveyed all the dbris
  from our living and the bodies of our dead. Our scientists process these
  things and impregnate with the result the water out of which the <i>fortlik</i>
  grows."</p>

  <p>"<i>The bodies of your dead!</i>" My voice was thin with shock. "You eat
  the grain that grows out of the bodies of your dead!"</p><br>

  <p class="first">MY FACE mast have portrayed the revulsion, the horror, that
  crawled within me, for Nalinah stared at it with a curious mixture of
  non-comprehension and surprise.</p>

  <p>"Now, what is strange in that?" she asked. "We know something of the life
  of your people. You slay living beasts and feed upon their burned flesh. This
  we do not do."</p>

  <p>"But those are animals of a different species," I protested. "They are not
  our own kind. Our human kind we bury in consecrated ground and make certain
  that they lie undisturbed forever. We tend their graves, make them beautiful
  with grass and flowers that clothe forever the good fertile soil. They sleep
  forever&mdash;" I stopped suddenly. A query had sprung unbidden to my mind.
  Whence came the elements that mixed with what in the beginning was nothing
  but rock pulverized by wind and weather&mdash;rock that could support no
  life&mdash;to make it good and fertile?</p>

  <p>Aeons of time raced through my thoughts. Out of a warm, salt sea, bits of
  living protoplasm crawled upon a sandy and barren beach, died, and decayed.
  Green things, as tiny, grew out of the silt. Once more the sea gave up a
  froth of, microscopic life. This fed upon the green, and it was a little
  longer before dissolution claimed it.</p>

  <p>Epochs wheeled by, uncountable tens of centuries. Now shaggy, brute-faced
  men prowled a steaming jungle. They killed for food, it is true, the
  monstrous beasts that shared their haunts; but they stuffed also into their
  fanged maws the tender fronds of the ferns, and the now forgotten fruits of a
  primordial verdure. The apemen died, and their corpses lay moldering in the
  jungle, and from what the chemistry of decay made of these corpses new
  verdure grew; whose fronds, whose fruits the children of the apemen stuffed
  into their fanged maws...</p>

  <p>I thought of grass and flowers upon carefully tended graves, their roots
  drinking from fertile loam the life elements washed out of cracked coffins,
  washed out of that which lies within these coffins. The grass and flowers die
  at last, are mowed down and carted off, perhaps to fertilize some field so
  that it may become golden with waving wheat. Perhaps some child, spooning his
  breakfast cereal, will nurture his chubby little body with an atom or two
  that once lived in the body of his great-grandfather.</p>

  <p>Not horrible, this. Somehow beautiful. Somehow, it lent a new dignity to
  death, a new and glorious symbolism to every gardened graveyard. "<i>Dust
  thou art, to dust returnest, was not spoken of the soul</i>," indeed. But
  neither does the dust of the soul's brief shelter remain mere dust. "<i>In
  Flanders fields the poppies grow...</i>"</p>

  <p>"Forever!" Nalinah was exclaiming. "They lie forever undisturbed. How
  profligate that is! How rich your Upper World must be if it can afford such
  waste! Here in Mernia we dare not waste anything, dare not lose anything.
  Look you, Hula. Since Skoolteh's traitorous corpse is not worthy of the honor
  of serving the Folk again, it will not go to the Basins. Because of this,
  because the scientists will not change it and so the crop of <i>fortlik</i>
  must be reduced by just so much, some Surahnit child must be denied the right
  to birth."</p>

  <p>"Denied?" I was still dazed by the revelation, the new understanding, that
  had flashed upon me in a split second of insight. "Birth?" I repeated. And
  then I comprehended the full implication of her statement. "Your state does
  that? It grants or denies even the right to be born?"</p>

  <p>"But yes, Hula. It is necessary." She spoke to me with the same patience,
  the same effort to understand that what to her was matter-of-fact must be
  explained to me, as that with which I have justified to some Arab of the
  trackless desert our law that one may move on a highway only when a green
  traffic light signals us permission to move. "Within the four Walls of Mernia
  there is sustenance for just so many. The balance between the needs of the
  Folk and the things that satisfy those needs is so delicate, the margin
  between race-life and race-death, so minute, that only by utmost care can the
  Folk hope to survive."</p>

  <p>I saw her point. "Yours is a meticulously planned economy," I exclaimed.
  "Not by choice, but forced upon you by the conditions, the poverty of your
  environment." I understand now the reason for their Creed, for the rigorous,
  ruthless discipline of their Law. "Your totalitarian state&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I was halted by the drum tattoo of many hoofs, rushing upon us. I wheeled.
  Horses were stampeding across the <i>fortlik</i> field&mdash;a band of horses
  herded by riders in the uniform of the labor guard. The cavalcade poured
  headlong through the swishing grain and my pulses thudded with the
  blood-tingling sight.</p>

  <p>They were almost upon us. The riders shouted. The animals forelegs braked
  them to a halt, a troop beautifully trained. High-spirited, they curvetted in
  their places. The guards leaped to the ground. Some were busy at once
  buckling the harness straps together, hitching the beasts into a team. Others
  snatched coils of leather strapping from their saddles, and commenced rigging
  it about the <i>lusan</i>.</p>

  <p>Something odd about the beasts clamored for my attention. I moved nearer
  for more careful scrutiny. Its head was chunky, its jaws heavier than those
  of any horse I'd ever come across. It batted its great, lustrous eyes at me,
  shied away, neighing and pawing the ground. The luxuriant fetlocks of its
  legs made shaggy stockings completely veiling the pasterns. The hoofs beneath
  them&mdash;</p>

  <p>Those were not hoofs! Not horses hoofs. They were cloven into three
  indurated toes. Three toes!</p>

  <p>My fist smacked into my palm.</p>

  <p>If I were of Upper World height these horses would appear to be the size
  of St. Bernard dogs. Their hoofs were three-toed. They were not horses. They
  were the remote ancestors of our horses. They were <i>Eohippi</i>, the horses
  of Evolution's infancy. They were dawn-horses, the like of which have not
  roamed Earth's surface for fifty thousand years!</p>

  <p class="cp"><em>Statement of Edith Horne, R.N., dictated to the
  author:</em></p>

  <p class="first">MEN are such fools! Any woman would have known by Dr.
  Stone's face that he was lying when he drove up to the gate Thursday night;
  Jethro Parker lolling all over the seat beside him; and stammered out a story
  full of holes. But Ed Hard and Bob Falk swallowed it whole cloth, and of
  course the three boys did.</p>

  <p>Morphy, the cook, did look a little puzzled, as nearly as one can make out
  any expression on his walnut shell of a face. I decided that was nothing to
  worry about. Even if Shean suspected something, he was an unreconstructed
  Sinn Feiner, aversion to constituted authority a fetish with him. He might do
  a lot of thinking, but he would do no talking.</p>

  <p>The four men carried Parker into the infirmary. We shooed out the cook and
  the councillors. While I undressed the farmer and made him comfortable, I
  learned what really had happened.</p>

  <p>"There wasn't anything else to do," Doctor Stone finished. "We ought to be
  safe enough for the two weeks till his wife, Martha, returns from her visit,
  and if we've heard nothing from Hugh by then there will be no point in
  keeping up the deception."</p>

  <p>"You intend to keep him under chloral for two weeks, doctor?" I let no
  surprise, no protest, sound in my voice. "Hadn't you better review exactly
  what I should do when he collapses?"</p>

  <p>"Collapses!" He stared at me. "I&mdash;I hadn't thought of that." I knew
  that. One of the first things a nurse in training learns is how to remind a
  physician of his lapses without appearing to have noticed them. "It won't
  work. We can't take a chance on killing him."</p>

  <p>"We can't tie him up, either, but we must not let him go."</p>

  <p>"If we talk to him, if we explain everything," the doctor faltered,
  "perhaps we can persuade him to keep silent, at least for a while."</p>

  <p>I have seen Courtney Stone in the operating room, confronted by more than
  one emergency that would have appalled another surgeon, and he was always
  completely unperturbed, brilliantly efficient. Now out of his element, he was
  a bewildered man, utterly at a loss.</p>

  <p>"No," I answered him. "You know as well as I, we'd never succeed in that,
  if he is normal. But there must be some way we can make him do exactly as we
  want him. Some drug, maybe, not as dangerous as chloral or an opiate. Didn't
  you say once, lecturing to the probationers, that a man thoroughly acquainted
  with the <i>materia medica</i> can play on the human body and mind as a
  master musician plays on his violin?"</p>

  <p>"Some drug&mdash;" He snapped his fingers. "Of course. Hyoscine
  hydrobromide! An injection of that paralyzes the centers of voluntary action
  in the cerebellum, renders the subject amenable to any suggestion. I was
  reading only yesterday about Dr. Calvin Goddard's use of it in criminal
  investigation. Given one-hundredth of a grain of it, the suspect cannot
  refuse to tell the truth when so directed. We can inject it while Parker's
  still under the influence of the chloral. When he comes to he'll obey us as
  though he were a will-less cretin."</p>

  <p>"I <i>knew</i> you would think of something," I exclaimed, admiringly.</p>

  <p>"Boil up a needle while I go out to my car and see if I have any hyoscine
  in my kit."</p>

  <p>"Your kit's here. I brought it in, and I am almost sure you have a tube of
  the tablets in it."</p>

  <p>I knew he had. I'd looked, while they were carrying Parker in.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>Affidavit of Edward Hard,<br>
  Instructor at West End School for physical culture:</em></p><br>

  <p class="letter">State of New York<br>
  County of New York<br>
  City of New York</p>

  <p class="letter">Edward Hard, being duly sworn, deposes and says:<br></p>

  <p class="letter">I was, during the summer of 1934, head councillor of Camp
  Wanooka for Boys, situated near Albany, New York. The camp officially closed
  on the morning of August 30, 1934, but because of a possible contagion that
  had been discovered after the greater part of its members had left, there
  were quarantined within it the following myself and Councillor Robert Falk,
  Nurse Edith Horne, Cook Shean Morphy, Campers Roger Norton, Percy White,
  Richard Loring and Charles Dorsey, and a neighborhood farmer named Jethro
  Parker.</p>

  <p class="letter">Charles Dorsey end Jethro Parker were ill and confined to
  the infirmary. The rest of us were free to come and go about the camp as long
  as we kept within its borders. Dr. Courtney Stone, Chief Surgeon of the
  Albany Post-Graduate Hospital, was medically in charge and was spending as
  much time with us as he could spare from his practice.</p>

  <p class="letter">At about eight p.m. on the evening of the said August 30th,
  1934, Robert Falk and I were with the three well boys in the recreation hall.
  I was refereeing a doubles table-tennis game the others were playing. Doctor
  Stone and Nurse Horne were in the infirmary with their patients.</p>

  <p class="letter">The players were absorbed in a spirited rally when I heard
  a soft tap on a window behind me. I turned. Shean Morphy's face was pressed
  against the pane. He beckoned to me, furtively. I nodded and he slid
  away.</p>

  <p class="letter">I made some excuse and went outside. After the glare within
  the rec hall, I was blinded for a moment. I heard a rustle in the underbrush,
  started toward it, calling softly to Morphy. Fingers gripped my arm. They
  were trembling with palsy.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Ed! I seen them. The leprechauns. They're all about."</p>

  <p class="letter">His breath smelled to high heaven of alcohol, which was
  unusual. Morphy had been honest about this failing of his when Mr. Lambert,
  the director, had employed him, but during the season he had confined his
  sprees to hike days, when the camp was empty and they would not interfere
  with his citifies.</p>

  <p class="letter">His free hand pointed in the direction of the rustle I had
  heard. By this time my pupils had accommodated themselves to the dimness, but
  I saw nothing except the tree trunks.</p>

  <p class="letter">I say I saw nothing. Remembering that I am under oath I
  must admit that for a moment I thought there was something there. The nearest
  I can come to describing it is that the air itself seemed to have thickened,
  to outline a human form scarcely, a foot high.</p>

  <p class="letter">It was imagination, of course, and the blinking of my
  eyelids dispelled the illusion. "You're seeing things, Shean," I said
  quietly.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Seeing things, am I? Maybe it's the same way I'm hearing
  someone walking through the woods, way down at the end of the lake. But hush
  and you'll hear him too."</p>

  <p class="letter">I listened. The muffled click click of the ball behind the
  rec hall's closed door made no impression on the close stillness of the
  mountain night. For some reason even the all-pervading shrill of the
  nocturnal insects was silenced, so that the sounds Morphy meant were quite
  distinct, despite their distance&mdash;the scrape of fabric against tree
  bark, a stealthy footfall, the snap of a dried twig under a heavy heel.</p>

  <p class="letter">There was no doubt of it, someone was prowling through the
  camp grounds, there to the north. That called for an investigation.</p>

  <p class="letter">"I'm going to take a look," I whispered. "Be quiet, I don't
  want the others to hear."</p>

  <p class="letter">I had two reasons for that. In the first place, the
  youngsters had been greatly overexcited by the disappearance of Hugh Lambert,
  the camp director, and I didn't want to set them off again.</p>

  <p class="letter">I hate to confess that my second reason for not calling out
  Bob Falk was my sneaking suspicion that he might have had something to do
  with what had happened to Mr. Lambert. The only reasonable explanation I
  could evolve for the way the vanished director's clothing had been found was
  that Bob had arranged the garments. The prowler might be connected with that,
  might be trying to get in touch with Falk.</p>

  <p class="letter">There was nothing I could do about Morphy except let him
  come along, but he was surprisingly quiet for a man in his condition. The
  skulker hadn't heard us, even when we reached the edge of the bushes at the
  lake front, and, halting, saw him standing at the very edge of the shore,
  stark naked.</p>

  <p class="letter">An odd violet glow from the water silhouetted him. I
  recognized the farmer, Jeremiah Fenton.</p>

  <p class="letter">He bent, picked up some objects from the ground. I made out
  a chessboard, a handful of chessmen, and a battered pipe. Then he was wading
  out into the lake.</p>

  <p class="letter">"He's going to drown himself!" I exclaimed, and started out
  to stop him. Morphy caught my arm. His callused palm flattened over my
  mouth.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Wait," he breathed. "Let's see what queer thing it is he's
  up to."</p>

  <p class="letter">So absorbed Fenton was that he was unaware of us. He
  halted, knee-deep in the violet shimmer, held the things he had with him out
  over the water.</p>

  <p class="letter">"It's our birthday, Elijah!" His tone was as
  matter-of-fact as if the non-existent person to whom he spoke were right there in
  front of him. "And I know you want these presents more than anything I could
  buy."</p>

  <p class="letter">He opened his hands and their contents dropped.</p>

  <p class="letter">The violet light exploded to meet them, enveloped Fenton!
  Shean screamed, dragged me backwards into the bushes. We floundered there,
  the cook yelling, myself trying to bat him away and get to my feet.</p>

  <p class="letter">When I succeeded, Fenton was gone, although his clothes
  were still on the shore. I looked down at Morphy, gibbering on his knees.
  "You scared him away, you damned drunk," I growled.</p>

  <p class="letter">"The leprechauns took him. Did you not see him get small
  in the midst of the light and the little men pulling a shining cloak over
  him? Did you not see them drag him into the lake, and themselves vanish under
  the surface with him?"</p>

  <p class="letter">"No, I didn't," I snarled. "I haven't got the d.t.'s."</p>

  <p class="letter">Falk and the boys were rushing up just then. We sent the
  kids packing and Bob helped me manhandle Morphy to his bunk, where we tied
  him down. We got Dr. Stone to come down to give him a shot of apomorphine,
  and after a while the camp quieted down.</p>

  <p class="letter">Both men agreed with me that Morphy was half-crazed by the
  bootleg applejack he had, assimilated. Doctor Stone told me that Fenton's
  twin brother had been drowned in Wanooka the winter before, which explained
  his actions nicely. Those Helderberg farmers are pretty sentimental, but they
  don't like to be caught at it.</p>

  <p class="letter">Nobody tried to explain the way the light had flashed out
  of the water. Nobody thought it needed any explanation.</p>

  <p class="letter">In witness whereof I set hereunto nay hand and seal this
  12th day of December, 1936. (Signed) Edward Hard.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>Hugh Lambert's Narrative resumed:</em></p><br>

  <p class="first">RA NALINAH and I were once more in the <i>lusan</i>, and it
  was again traversing the road. She had not been altogether right about the
  vehicle's being uninjured by the accident. It had started, true enough, when
  she pulled the control lever toward her, but it did not attain the blurring
  speed it had before.</p>

  <p>The girl bit her lip, pettishly jerked the gleaming rod; but she could not
  get the <i>lusan</i> to move faster than what I reckoned to be somewhere
  around a hundred miles an hour. At this comparatively slow rate I had a
  chance to examine the shifting images in the visual screen.</p>

  <p>At first, though, there was only the undulating expanse of the
  <i>fortlik</i> fields on either side, a great sea of orange luminance, and
  scattered buildings too far off for me to make out their nature. I began to
  lose interest.</p>

  <p>"Hula," Nalinah murmured; nestling close to me, "from what you said, back
  there in, the <i>fortlik</i>. I gather that in the world, from which you come
  there is no such, balance between life and death as here in Mernia."</p>

  <p>It was a question, and I answered it. "Yes. Of course there is a balance
  of existence in the Upper World, not so very different from what you have
  here. Every living entity contributes to the welfare of every other, and
  depends on every other for its own well-being. Plants and animals, for
  instance, complement one another; what is poison to the one is the other's
  food. I have just thought of the reason why your scientists go to so much
  trouble to grow this orange grain"&mdash;I waved at it in the
  screen&mdash;"when apparently, they are advanced enough to synthesize what
  food you need. It furnishes a perfect, and at the same time simple, example
  of that interlocking of function of which I speak."</p>

  <p>"Your people, your animals&mdash;and ours&mdash;breathe in oxygen and
  exhale carbon dioxide. Your <i>fortlik</i> alike our vegetation of every
  kind&mdash;inhales the carbon dioxide and breaks it down into carbon, which
  it, uses to build its substance, and oxygen, which it breathes out as useless
  to it. Without this supply of oxygen people and animals would perish. So it
  is with every other life process, with us as well as with you. Do you
  understand that, Nalinah?"</p>

  <p>"Hula." She was looking into my eyes, her own suddenly agleam with elfin
  laughter. "When you are absorbed, like this, your face is palely handsome as
  a Taphet's and at the same time darkly strong as one of our Surahnit. The
  combination thrills me."</p>

  <p>I felt like spanking her for that but I ignored it. "We, too, walk upon a
  narrow, unrailed bridge over a bottomless abyss that is black with the
  oblivion of our race's death. Till lately the bridge was a way so broad we
  could not descry its borders. Even then our safety depended upon that balance
  between our needs and their satisfaction, but we did not think about it or
  trouble to maintain it. Nature did that for us, and we thought Nature would
  do it forever."</p>

  <p>Nalinah's high brow grew pensive, and she became wholly attentive. I was
  all at once tinglingly conscious again of her otherworldly beauty.</p>

  <p>"Nature," I went on, my jaw ridging with my effort of self-control,
  "having started us off with her lush abundance, still watched over us. Kindly
  cruel and very wise, when either plants or animals outstripped each other in
  numbers, upsetting the balance she had set up, Nature restored it by drought
  or floods, by catastrophe or pestilence, by the extinction even, of one
  species or the creation of another."</p>

  <p>"Why do you speak in the past?" the girl demanded.</p>

  <p>I did not reply at once. As the <i>lusan</i> mounted one of the great,
  smooth waves into which the bed of the Mernian cavern was folded, I caught
  sight, in the distance, of a clearing in the spread of grain. It seemed to be
  walled in by a gray palisade of stone, except where on one side a long, low
  building paralleled the road, and within that fence there seemed to be some
  sort of bustling activity.</p>

  <p>"Why, Hula," Nalinah asked again, "do you say these things have been?"</p>

  <p>"Because, like half-grown children, we have come to think ourselves wiser
  than she who fostered us. Over the whole face of the globe we have interfered
  with Nature's plans. We have drawn upon the stores which she laid up for us
  against a time of scarcity, and have wasted them. We have taken far more from
  the other forms of life upon the surface of our planet than we have given to
  them. We have even altered the span of life Nature decreed for us; even
  altered the ratio, between our own births and deaths&mdash;not for the good
  of the race but for our pleasure. We have weighed down the scales against us
  almost too far for a chance of retrieval, and Nature has given up the task of
  holding the beam level."</p><br>

  <p class="first">WE WERE now close to the enclosure whose appearance had
  intrigued me. Animals within the fence milled to escape some Taphetnit who
  worked among them. I saw one of the little beasts caught and dragged off into
  the windowless building. We flicked past.</p>

  <p>"What are they?" I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"<i>Tivra</i>," Nalinah gave me their Mernian name. "From their skins come
  the leather from which all our clothing is fashioned, and all our
  cordage."</p>

  <p>She called them <i>tivra</i>, but I knew them by another name. Most laymen
  think of prehistoric creatures as the incredibly gigantic reptiles of the
  Mesozoic, <i>Dinosaurus, Triceratops</i>, and king of all,
  <i>Tyranosauraus</i>. True, these did stalk old Terra fourteen million years
  ago, but the Glacial Ages, beginning five thousand centuries before the birth
  of Christ and ending some five hundred B.C., are quite as prehistoric. As we
  know by the fossil record of the rocks the fauna of those times were
  diminutive rather than enormous. They were the tiny ancestors of the mammals
  we know today, like the <i>Eohippi</i>, like the <i>tivra</i>. Deer scarcely
  larger than our present-day fawns, their full-grown horns mere knobs behind
  their ears, our unimaginative paleontologists have named them
  <i>Dicroreri</i>.</p>

  <p>The people of Mernia were diminutive humans, the wings of the Taphetnit
  notwithstanding. The two specimens of their animal life I had seen (I
  suspected then and know now the only two) were miniature mammals known to
  Earth's surface as recently as the end of the Pleistocene Era, but vanished
  since.</p>

  <p>My slitted gaze strayed to Nalinah's wand, where she had thrust it into
  her belt. The device at its tip was, beyond dispute, a representation of the
  sun and its nine attendant planets. What could these dwellers in the
  subterranean world know of our solar system? True enough, they had made some
  excursions to the surface, yet it seemed utterly incongruous that the tenants
  of our skies should be important enough, to them to inspire what was
  evidently the symbol of their autarchy.</p>

  <p>There was some clue, in all this, to their origin. The answer hovered
  tantalizingly at the threshold of my mind, slipped away from me as Nalinah
  brought me back to our discourse.</p>

  <p>"Hula! You seem dismayed as you speak of the situation in your Upper
  World, yet to me it seems still a very Paradise, compared to Mernia."</p>

  <p>"I don't wonder," I grunted, my mind still busy with the problem suggested
  by the <i>Dicroreri</i>. "No, I don't wonder."</p>

  <p>"You started with a lavish abundance and much of that remains. Our
  universe is a closed one, limited by the four wails, the ceiling and the
  door, of this great cavern. Nothing can come into it save the water that
  feeds the <i>fortlik</i>. Nothing can go out of it. Yet the Folk have
  survived here, for thousands of <i>sloonit</i>."</p>

  <p>"That is about all you have done," I responded. "Survive. Because you know
  nothing better, you are content to be ruled in all your thoughts, and all
  your actions, for every minute of your waking and sleeping lives by laws so
  rigorous that the punishment for their violation is a horrible death. You are
  content to be not individuals but mere creatures of your commonwealth, mere
  cells in a social organism, not free to live or love or even hate as you
  desire. You cannot comprehend how abhorrent such a life seems to me, how
  abhorrent it must be to any who has known the Upper World."</p>

  <p>"We are slaves, Hula, it is true. Yet we go on. You are free, and your
  race rushes to its own extinction."</p>

  <p>"Not yet," I snapped. "We can still save ourselves."</p>

  <p>"How, Hula? How?"</p>

  <p>"By turning from our reckless course. By conserving wisely that which is
  left to us of Nature's bounty. By restoring, in our relation to our
  environment and our relations with One another, that balance of which I have
  spoken. By remembering, as a race and as individuals, that we must contribute
  to the common welfare as much as we take from it. By planning our existence,
  and living according to that plan."</p>

  <p>"Your people, every one of them, are so wise then, so altruistic that you
  can do this, Hula, without rulers to promulgate it as a Law, without dire
  punishments to enforce the Law? Are they, Hula?"</p>

  <p>"Well..." I hesitated, then honestly compelled the answer. "No."</p>

  <p>The hint of a triumphant smile shadowed her lips, warning me of the trap
  into which she insidiously had led me.</p>

  <p>What I had proposed was exactly the planned economy of Mernia that I so
  pitied the Folk for having to endure; that the negative I had just spoken
  made inevitable was exactly the despotism of a ruler caste, the absolute
  subjection of each individual to the state, that I stigmatized as
  revolting!</p>

  <p>I recovered myself. "But we shall learn to be, so that we may work our
  destiny as free, masterless individuals, and not as slaves. The alternative
  is already too clear to us. Some territories upon Earth's surface, isolated
  by the artificial boundaries we call national borders, have already gone the
  way you imply we all must go. We have our horrible examples, our totalitarian
  states built upon one fanatic doctrine or another, and we see what sacrifice
  of happiness, what misery, they entail.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps all humanity is mortgaged to that doom by the race's instinct to
  perpetuate itself, accepting any fate rather than extinction; but that
  mortgage is not yet foreclosed."</p>

  <p>"No, my Hula?"</p>

  <p>"No," I flung at her. "We are not yet in the situation of your Folk. Our
  resources are not yet drained. We still have a margin of safety. We still can
  save ourselves from the dire necessity that afflicts you, not by imposed Law
  but by our own enlightened choice. I still have faith, Ra Nalinah, that
  joining hands in a great unselfish, democratic band, we shall yet march on to
  greater heights of happiness and wellbeing than we have ever known."</p>

  <p>Her smile was gone. She seemed troubled.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" she sighed, "but if this is more than just your dream, perhaps we
  Mernlans have no right to&mdash;"</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE <i>lusan</i> lifted, abruptly. Nalinah cut herself
  off, fell into a dark absorption. I turned to the screen, saw that the
  ground, bare and dark once more, was dropping away from beneath us. The road
  was now a ramp stalking across the land on tremendous stilts, and climbing.
  The pitch of the incline slowed the limping <i>lusan</i> even more, so that
  it was crawling.</p>

  <p>I peered downward at the airy network of the trestle members, a little
  dizzy with the height to which we were attaining, troubled a little by a
  sense of insecurity. The girders of that scaffolding seemed far too slender,
  far too fragile to support itself, let alone the weight of the <i>lusan</i>.
  They seemed to sway perilously in the dead air.</p>

  <p>Quite suddenly the lacy structure was no longer a scaffolding springing
  from solid rock but a flying arch, a feathery bridge over an awesome chasm. I
  looked down into that terrible abyss, down till my eyes ached with the
  strain, and I could not probe its depths. Bottomless it seemed, its black
  mystery plumbing Earth even perhaps to the eternal fires bubbling at its
  core.</p>

  <p>We were no longer over that fearsome gulf. The trestle ramp had curved
  suddenly, had become an ascending spiral, a mile across. Within the embrace
  of its arc encircled by that incredible chasm, I saw the Surahnit city, of
  Tashna.</p>

  <p>I saw Tashna, but not for the first time.</p>

  <p>I had seen all this; the strange buildings that spread beneath me, the
  great Central Plaza out of which soared a topless crystal shaft within which
  rainbow-hued clouds swirled and billowed while the whole city pulsed with a
  weird, unwholesome light&mdash;in my dreams!</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>Statement of Edith Horne, R.N., resumed:</em></p>

  <p class="first">THE drug administered to Jethro Parker did all that we hoped
  it would. Friday morning he woke up and asked me where he was, what had
  happened to him. I told him, bluntly, not to bother me with questions. I fed
  him his breakfast, ordered him back to sleep. He obeyed like a babe. When Ed
  Hard came in to inquire after my patients only a practised eye could have
  made out any difference between poor Charley Dorsey and the farmer.</p>

  <p>The healthy youngsters, Roger Norton, Dick Doring, Ann's brother, and
  Percy White, were much more of a problem. Restless, full of life, they were
  continually getting into mischief. I had suggested to the councillors that
  they work out a schedule of activities, as near the ordinary routine of the
  camp as possible, and they had done so. I thought the water was getting too
  cold for swimming and forbade it. There had been quite a little argument
  about this, but I managed to win my point.</p>

  <p>After I was through with feeding Parker at noon, and with the task of
  giving young Charley such nourishment as possible, there was nothing for me
  to do. Dr. Stone had run back to Albany to attend to his practice; Ed and Bob
  were giving the boys lessons in boxing; Shean Morphy, recovered from his
  indisposition of the night before, was busy in his kitchen. The thought of
  Hugh broke through the barriers I had contrived to erect against it. It was
  the uncertainty as to his fate that was so dreadful. I could have borne it
  better if I knew him to be dead.</p>

  <p>With a queer idea that it might make him seem nearer, I went into the room
  where Hugh had slept the night after he returned from Dr. Stone's and again
  the night after he almost drowned. I stood at the window and looked out into
  the woods. It was down there, I recalled, that we found Hugh's clothing, each
  garment in its proper place. But he was not dead. I should have known it if
  he were.</p>

  <p>And then I heard a scream from within the house, a man's hoarse scream
  that could come only from Jethro Parker!</p><br>

  <p class="first">I WHIRLED, dashed through the door into his room. He was out
  of his bed. His eyes bulged with terror and his great hands were pawing at
  his chest.</p>

  <p>"Jethro!" I cried, halting in the doorway.</p>

  <p>He tore something away from him. Those hands of his were spread apart, as
  though they held something between them. Their fingers were curled, as though
  they clutched something. Hands, arms, were shaking as though something were
  alive, were fighting frenziedly to get loose. But I saw nothing. Nothing at
  all, except the farmer, the familiar furnishings of the little room.</p>

  <p>Parker's arms swept over his head, slashed down, as if he were hurling
  from him the imagined Thing he fought. Glass crashed. The window pane had
  broken, just as if he had thrown some object.</p>

  <p>"<i>Jethro!</i>"</p>

  <p>He turned and stared at me, glassy-eyed. "Sucking my chest," he gasped,
  his hands back at his hairy breast but fumbling there now uncertainly. "It
  was sucking my blood."</p>

  <p>Delirium, I thought. Hyoscine sometimes acts like that "Get back into
  bed;" I snapped.</p>

  <p>I crossed to him, felt of his brow. It was damp with cold sweat, but not
  feverish.</p>

  <p>It could not have been delirium unless I, too, was delirious. Parker had
  had nothing between his hands. He had flung nothing at the window, that was
  four feet from where he stood&mdash;but someone had!</p>

  <p>When I looked at Jethro Parker I saw, where his hairy chest was exposed by
  the open V of his night-shirt, a reddened spot on the skin&mdash;as though
  his blood had been drawn close to the surface by a tiny, sucking
  mouth.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>Hugh Lambert's Narrative, continued:</em></p><br>

  <p>In that dream of mine I had seen the stone-built houses of Tashna from the
  ground level. That way, they had appeared odd enough&mdash;hexagonal,
  windowless, their doors rectangular plates of the dull red metal I have
  learned is an allotrope of copper, called by the Mernians <i>lural</i>. Now,
  from the vantage of the slowly mounting <i>lusan</i>, I saw their real
  difference, from any terrestrial structure. They were roofless! I could look
  down into them, as they were imaged on the vehicle's visual screen, and could
  see every detail of their internal economy.</p>

  <p>This was, come to think of it, quite to be expected. There is no rain in
  Mernia, no snow, no wind. The temperature is unvarying.</p>

  <p>The Mernians did not build their homes for shelter, but for privacy.</p>

  <p>For privacy? Numerous small, railed platforms were bracketed to the legs
  of the trestles supporting the ramp-spiral that encircled the city, and the
  roads coming radially in to merge with it. On each platform a man stood,
  leaning over, the rail, staring down. I pointed them out to Nalinah.</p>

  <p>"They are the Watchers," she told me. "Their duty is to observe any
  infraction of the Law and report it to the Ratanit for punishment. They
  seldom have a report to give."</p>

  <p>"I don't wonder," I remarked; thinking of those never-sleeping eyes
  watching the city. "Have you got some way of spying on the people's thoughts,
  too?"</p>

  <p>My sarcasm failed. "Yes," was the girl's amazing reply. "See there." She
  pointed to a corner of the screen, to a building larger than most. "That is
  the Listeners Post."</p>

  <p>I leaned forward. The houses of Tashna are divided within into six-sided
  compartments or rooms, some of their partitions double-walled to allow for
  interconnecting passages. The entire City is laid out on this hexagonal plan,
  its resemblance to a vast honeycomb corresponding so well to the Surahnit's
  beelike sociology that I think I might have been surprised had it been
  otherwise.</p>

  <p>There seemed to be less of a bustle of activity within the structure
  Nalinah had indicated than inside the others, but it was distinguished by a
  sparkling glitter, as though it contained much polished metal.</p>

  <p>"You listen to their very thoughts," I repeated, wonderingly. "I said that
  because I deemed it impossible."</p>

  <p>"Impossible? Thought is electrical in nature,* every brain continually
  sending out etheric waves. All that is needed to pick these up is the proper
  apparatus. Look."</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Author's Note: A recent newspaper report (New York
  Times; Dec. 12, 1936) deals with the experiments of Drs. Lee Travis and
  Abraham Gottlober of the University of Iowa along this line. Their results
  while not complete yet only tend to confirmation of the electrical nature of
  thought but of course the Mernian scientists are far in advance of ours in
  this field as in almost everything else.&mdash;A.L.Z.]</p>

  <p>Nalinah's hand touched the edge of the screen.</p>

  <p>The interior of the Listeners Post leaped at me. I seemed to be right on
  top of it as it revolved slowly, with our slow circling about the city.</p>

  <p>The walls of the hexagonal rooms were of crystal. Fastened to them was an
  orderly jumble of metal bars and levers, of angling bus-wires. Seated along
  these walls were hundreds of Surahnit girls, wires coiling from the
  electrical apparatus on the walls to disc-like contrivances clamped to their
  ears. Every now and then one of the girls would stretch out a white-webbed
  hand to make some adjustment; otherwise they were immovable, visibly tense
  with concentration.</p>

  <p>"The Listeners," Nalinah murmured in my ear. "Vanark has them well
  trained, has he not? Even in his Absence they attend strictly to their duty.
  They are forbidden only to scan the thoughts of us on the Ratanit, and of the
  higher officers of the labor guard."</p>

  <p>This, too, I had dreamed about. I had seen one of these walls, a white
  hand moving...</p><br>

  <p class="first">NOT QUITE. The wall in my dream had been somewhat different
  from these. The connections had been different, the levers. I noticed, at the
  very center of the honeycomb, a small cell that was covered over.
  "That&mdash;why is it hidden? Is there something special there?"</p>

  <p>"Special? Yes. An invention of Vanark's not yet perfected." Nalinah's
  voice halted abruptly. When she spoke again, almost at once, there was a
  curious mixture of, speculation and excitement in her tone. "Or so he claims.
  But&mdash;curious&mdash;He seemed to have no doubt that you&mdash;Can that be
  the real reason for his eagerness to destroy you? To hide his mistake?"</p>

  <p>"What are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>"His experiment for which he promised so much." I realized she was so
  caught up by her train of thought that she did not realize I had spoken to
  her or that she was answering me. "Far beyond mere eavesdropping on thought,
  though based on the same principle. Control of the will itself. Remote
  control! He reported that it had temporarily failed with the first emissary
  we sent Into the Upper World. But are you not subject to it? I did not
  realize...Hula! You did not come here willingly, did you?"</p>

  <p>"No. I could not help myself. Something made me follow Vanark, obey him,
  in spite of myself."</p>

  <p>"In spite&mdash;Wait..." She broke off, thought for an instant, was
  speaking again. "Hula! You are a human, are you not, reduced only to our
  size, but otherwise wholly a human? Yet&mdash;were you ever dead?"</p>

  <p>"Dead?" I laughed. "Why, no! I'm living, breathing. Once dead, a man stays
  dead."</p>

  <p>"Not always, Hula. The emissary&mdash;the one Vanark reported as
  lost&mdash;was dead once. Then he was alive again&mdash;the blood of a
  Surahnit in his veins, the blood through which, only, Vanark's invention
  could act on a human. It was not perfected. It could not reach efficiently
  through the mountains above us, and the emissary was lost."</p>

  <p>She was thinking aloud again, again oblivious of me. "I see it! I
  understand! Vanark searched for the emissary while the other parts of the
  Great Plan moved forward. He reported that he had found him again and was
  returning with him to Mernia. It was you with whom he returned. But you are
  not the lost emissary. You are not like those who lie in the cave in the
  Gateway Wall. You were never dead. Yet your will is not your own. You spoke,
  back there, of matters you could not know. How can that be when there is no
  Surahnit blood in your veins?"</p>

  <p>My pulse pounded. I had been thinking too, fitting into the weird
  occurrences of the past few weeks the weird things she was saying. Seeing the
  pattern almost plain now.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps there is, Nalinah. There is another's blood in my veins, not my
  own. Perhaps the other was the emissary of whom you speak." The blood of the
  tramp had been transfused into my veins&mdash;of the tramp who gruesomely
  resembled the man, Elijah Fenton, who had been drowned! "If that was
  Surahnit's blood, then within me there surely courses blood of the
  Surahnit."</p>

  <p>"That's it!" No doubt of Nalinah's excitement now. Her eyes were gleaming
  with it; her face was flushed. "When Vanark lost control of the emissary he
  lived for a while, blundering aimlessly about like a machine with its
  controls jangled."</p>

  <p>Into the path of my car he had blundered, I thought.</p>

  <p>She went on, "He no longer had a mind, but his muscles might have retained
  some memory of the time when they were alive on earth, might have reacted in
  response to motor impulses not yet faded from the ganglia that are
  independent of the central nervous system."</p>

  <p>A hand now dead, I thought, having blundered into old familiar
  surroundings, might have completed a chess move it had started months before.
  As Elijah Fenton had done.</p>

  <p>Sooner or later, Nalinah ran on, the life loaned his dead body would be
  exhausted and it would dwindle, vanish to nothingness, as had been provided
  for should it be captured.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THERE it was! The incredible thing that had happened in
  Court Stone's surgery was explained. Why I had been so irresistibly drawn to
  Lake Wanooka was also clear. That attraction had grown as the Surahnit blood
  that had been added to my own had invested mine with its peculiar chemistry.
  With that gradual change I had progressively gained the ability to see the
  Little Men who, invisible to anyone else, had been searching for the vanished
  tramp. When the change was completed, Vanark had obtained complete control of
  me, had carried me off...</p>

  <p>"You are not the emissary, as Vanark pretended. If he deceived by that
  much us others of the Ratanit," Nalinah mused aloud, "he may be hiding more
  in his secret room. He may not have yet returned to it. Before he
  does&mdash;the search ray!"</p>

  <p>She reached once more to the screen, pushed one of a series of disc-like
  buttons flush in its frame, so exactly the color of the metal that I had not
  noticed them before. The image of the house she had called the Listeners
  Post was again enlarged so that practically the whole field of our vision
  was occupied by the lid over Vanark's secret room!</p>

  <p>Nalinah thumbed another button.</p>

  <p>The roof was abruptly transparent! I could now see into the chamber
  beneath it.</p>

  <p>I saw more crystal walls, more gleaming metal bus-bars screwed to them. I
  saw gauges and levers, and a screen much like the one before me. There was
  only one girl in the cell. She was seated before the screen, was watching it
  intently. I gasped.</p>

  <p>That which she watched was my own countenance, staring out at her!
  Nalinah's was beside it, the interior of the <i>lusan</i> backgrounding
  us!</p>

  <p>The girl down there turned, and I saw her face.</p>

  <p>It was small, winsome. Black curls capped it. Its fathomless gray eyes
  were not puzzled now, but terrified!</p>

  <p>It was Leeahlee!</p>

  <p>I was not surprised. If I had found the city of my dream, what was there
  astonishing in the fact that the girl who I thought existed only in that
  fevered dream dwelt within it?</p>

  <p><i>The screen was blank</i>! I realized that it was blank because I had
  reached out and jabbed the uppermost button of the series on its frame.
  Nalinah snatched at my wrist, tried to drag my hand away. I fended her off
  with my shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Hula," she cried. "What are you doing? I thought I saw another there, a
  stranger. I must&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The <i>lusan</i> jolted to a stop. There was the grate of metal on metal
  and the vehicle's side was opening. Just before anyone outside could have
  seen what I was doing, I had released Nalinah, had settled back in my seat as
  if I had never left it.</p>

  <p>I had intended to do none of all this. I did not know why I pressed the
  button, nor that my pressing would blank the screen. I did not know why I
  fought Nalinah to keep it blank. Once more the Other had taken control of
  me.</p>

  <p>I knew that other's name now. Leeahlee. I had seen her white fingers flash
  among the keys before her as I had acted as I did.</p>

  <p>A labor guard subaltern appeared in the <i>lusan's</i> entrance. "Seal the
  covered cell in the Listeners' Post," Nalinah cried, whirling to him. "At
  once! Before anyone within it can escape."</p>

  <p>"<i>Gor Surah</i>, Nalinah," the officer saluted; And then he clipped; "I
  cannot obey your commands. By order of Nal Surah you are suspended from your
  powers as Ra, and directed to consider yourself under close arrest."</p>

  <p>"Arrest!" the girl exclaimed. Her wand jerked up. A film of green spread
  under the subaltern's dark skin, but there was no tremor in his voice. "You
  are to report to the Nal immediately," he continued, "and I am to take charge
  of your prisoner."</p>

  <p>Prisoner! I didn't like the sound of that. I liked still less what I
  glimpsed over the shoulder of the man who had said it.</p>

  <p>It was the hook-nosed, swarthy visage of Vanark I saw&mdash;expressionless
  save for the sneering triumph that leered out of his malign little eyes!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-06"
     id="ch-06"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <p class="cp"><em>Hugh Lambert's Narrative, continued:</em></p><br>

  <p class="first">NALINAH sprang out of the <i>lusan</i>, twisted to the Rata.
  "Vanark," she cried. "I saw in your cell&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stop." He cut her off. "You forget that, an arrest order forbids
  communication between its subject and anyone but her judges. Surrender your
  <i>kitor</i> to me and obey the order to report to the Na!"</p>

  <p>Nalinah stared at him, the luminance emanating from her excited little
  face fading to a grayish pallor. For a long moment she stood so, her lovely
  body tensed, Frantic appeal in her wide-pupiled eyes. Then she held out her
  wand to him, he took it; and she went past him, stumbling as if she were
  half-blinded by tears.</p>

  <p>"Out!" the officer snapped. I shoved along the seat, emerged on a circular
  platform, some hundred yards in diameter, to which the end of, the great
  spiral had broadened, here high above the city. At its further edge a
  half-dozen or so <i>lusans</i> were being serviced by Taphetnit under the
  watchful eyes of <i>coret</i>-armed guards. Between them and the three of us
  the wide expanse of darkly rubescent lural was untenanted, broken only by a
  small, six-sided penthouse at its center into which the flutter of Nalinah's
  robes was just disappearing.</p>

  <p>"What are your orders, Rata?" the subaltern inquired.</p>

  <p>"Fetch the prisoner along with me. Riskal." Vanark responded, his evil
  countenance an impassive mask. "He is to be brought before the Ratanit for
  questioning."</p>

  <p>"Very well."</p>

  <p>Vanark wheeled and stalked off toward the small structure into which
  Nalinah had gone. Riskal indicated by a gesture that I was to follow.</p>

  <p>Vanark had not even glanced at me but an alarm bell was ringing within me,
  warning me of peril. I was now fully aware, from Nalinah's broken sentences,
  that it had not been simply because of my attack upon him that he had
  attempted to have me killed at the Gateway guardhouse. His purpose had been
  to cover up my substitution for the tramp who had vanished from Doc Stone's
  leather couch, apparently for no other reason that that I was living proof of
  his blunder.</p>

  <p>Nalinah had saved me then, but I was in Vanark's power once more. I needed
  no other evidence than that he had accomplished this by somehow bringing
  about her arrest, to tell me that he did not intend me ever to come before
  the Mernian Council.</p>

  <p>The girl had at least given me the choice of aiding the Mernians in their
  intended invasion of the Upper World. I had reckoned myself fairly safe as
  long as there was a possibility of my being of use to the Little Folk. Now,
  trotting after Vanark to the little hexagonal penthouse, I was tensely aware
  of immediate and, deadly peril.</p>

  <p>I glanced wildly around, searching for some means of escape. Other than
  Vanark and the officer, no one was near enough to make me out clearly, let
  alone interfere with me, but I saw at once the idea was hopeless. I might by
  some miracle overcome the two Surahnit, but a <i>lusan</i> would overtake me
  at once if I made for the ramp by which the platform was reached. There was
  no other visible exit, no way I could go except over the edge, to plunge
  headlong down to the ground, a half mile below.</p>

  <p>Even if the Other, Leeahlee, permitted me to act, there was nothing I
  could do. Nothing at all.</p><br>

  <p class="first">REACHING the penthouse, Vanark touched the wand he called a
  <i>kitor</i> to its <i>lural</i> wall. It slitted vertically, opened out.
  Within, an absolutely bare ceilingless chamber was disclosed. Startlingly
  though it took up the entire interior and only seconds before I had seen
  Nalinah enter it, she was not there.</p>

  <p>The Rata went into the room. Wondering, what had become of Nalinah, I
  imitated him. I felt relieved as the subaltern joined us. Vanark had told him
  that they were taking me to the Ratanit. He would not have permitted the
  youth to come along if he had other plans. Perhaps my apprehension was
  reasonless.</p>

  <p>The chamber wall shut&mdash;leaped upward. A familiar, whistling roar
  assailed my ears. The mystery of Nalinah's disappearance was solved. We had
  entered an elevator like the one in the cliff at the Eastern boundary of
  Mernia, were descending to Tashna's street level. The girl had preceded us,
  that was all.</p>

  <p>Fast enough in all conscience, the speed of this drop was not nearly as
  stupendous as the first. It did not daze me as that had, did not rob me of my
  senses. I could see my companions, could see Riskal start suddenly and twist
  to the Rata-surprise, inquiry, written large on his swarthy, sensitive young
  face.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Vanark answered that look, a thin smile licking his sadistic mouth.
  "We are now below the ground level. We descend to a secret passage beneath
  the city, known only to the Ratanit. You&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A pile driver blow against the soles of my feet jarred the breath out of
  me. The chamber wall was no longer rushing upward. Vanark's gesture created
  an aperture in it, and we went out into a passageway.</p>

  <p>Its roof just cleared our heads. It was just wide enough to permit us to
  proceed single file, Vanark ahead, Riskal behind me. The darkly glistening
  walls were glass-smooth, as though the same terrific heat that had shaped
  Mernia's rocks had been applied to pierce the foundations of Tashna.</p>

  <p>I was oppressed by a sense of immense weight piled above me, by an
  illogical notion that any instant these walls would narrow and crush me. The
  whisper of our padded footfalls hissed away from us, pent in by the
  interminable burrow. The tunnel's sides ribboned past us far more swiftly
  than we could possibly be walking.</p>

  <p>It was as if the floor were moving with us, utterly without sound or
  vibration, yet when I looked down I could descry no appreciable separation
  between it and the side walls, no visible motion of the rock beneath us.</p>

  <p>There <i>was</i> no motion. We were being swept forward as I had seen
  surfboards swept, forward on the breast of a wave that was not water but a
  form rushing at breathless speed toward Waikiki beach. But here there was no
  wave, no change in the smooth surface of our footing, unless that change were
  so minute that its measurement was in the realm of the microscopic.</p>

  <p>It occurred to me that the <i>lusan</i> might have been propelled in the
  same manner. I wondered...My startled speculations were interrupted by the
  abrupt appearance of a fork in the tunnel ahead. Vanark took its left-hand
  branch.</p>

  <p>Riskal called out to him. "Are you not going wrong, Rata? Is not the other
  the direction of the Council House?"</p>

  <p>"Follow," the man ahead responded. His voice resounded, hollow in the
  tunnel's sightless reaches, seeming never to die out. I was again
  afraid...</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE passage bent sharply. Vanark did not turn with it. He
  went straight at the solid rock ahead of him, went straight <i>into it</i>.
  For an instant his form shimmered within the stone, then it was gone.</p>

  <p>The tunnel floor hurtled me straight ahead, my frantic efforts to stop or
  turn unavailing. I struck the wall.</p>

  <p>There was no impact. I blanked out into a vertiginous darkness. It was not
  around me but within me; within every cell, every atom, of my being&mdash;and
  as suddenly was gone.</p>

  <p>Falling forward, I twisted to a choked half cry, half scream behind me. I
  saw the other side of the wall; Riskal flinging out of it, out of its very
  substance, as though he were being formed from it. There was on his face the
  same shock, the same mixture of amazement and retching nausea as must have
  been on my own.</p>

  <p>The subaltern reeled, straightened. Stark terror struck his countenance
  livid!</p>

  <p>He was pinned to the wall by the brilliant, white glare of sunlight! His
  arm lifted. By a visibly tremendous effort it reached the horizontal. His
  contorted lips formed the words, "<i>Gor Surah</i>!" its syllables only a
  shadow of sound. Then he was blurring, agony shrieking from every melting
  line of his body.</p>

  <p>The hands with which I had held myself to my knees shoved against the
  floor, pivoted me from that dreadful treachery. From Vanark's upraised grasp,
  the <i>kitor</i> blazed the lethal rays that were utterly destroying the
  subaltern who had obeyed and trusted him, the officer on whose presence I had
  relied for my safety!</p>

  <p>How right I had been to be afraid!</p>

  <p>The scene photographed itself on my brain. Vanark was half a dozen feet
  from me. Behind and to either side of him was a clutter of wires, bus-bars,
  fantastic metallic fabrications, apparatus whose purpose and nature I could
  not even guess at. The room, its very walls and ceiling, exuded an atmosphere
  of murky stealth, of buried secrecy. A screen, like that in the <i>lusan</i>,
  except for greater size, occupied the rearmost wall.</p>

  <p>Before that screen stood the "tramp" who had strangely vanished from
  Stone's surgery.</p>

  <p>I started to, throw myself to my feet, aware that there was no possibility
  of escape from the murderous Mernian, aware that he could transfix and
  obliterate me with the <i>kitor's</i> deadly beam before I could reach him,
  but determined to attempt the impossible. I started to rise, but froze rigid,
  paralyzed by, the sound of my own name, cried out by the tramp.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Lambert. Have they got you, too?"</p>

  <p>Staring at him across the murk of that lair, only my bulging eyes alive,
  it dawned on me that he was <i>not</i> the tramp. He was Jeremiah Fenton, the
  farmer whose tale of a chess game mysteriously ended I had listened to.</p>

  <p>He was Elijah Fenton's twin!</p>

  <p>Vanark's scheme was clear now, in all its ingenuity. While Nalinah and I
  had been delayed in the <i>fortlik</i> field, he had somehow gotten hold of
  Fenton. He had beaten us to Tashna and provided for the girl's arrest.
  Murdering the guard, the only other Surahnit who could bear witness against
  him, he would destroy me next and then present the farmer as the emissary he
  had sent to spy on the Upper World.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that the deception would succeed. The resemblance
  between Fenton and the tramp was no accidental coincidence. The emissary
  was&mdash;had been&mdash;Elijah, Jeremiah Fenton's twin.</p>

  <p>"Hughlambert!" Vanark's voice pulled my eyes to his saturnine countenance.
  "This is your end." The <i>kitor</i> swung around. Its blaze struck deep into
  my brain. I saw nothing but that white glare, felt nothing but the
  excruciating torture of those brilliant darts...</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>Continuation of statement of Edith Horne, R.N.:</em></p>

  <p class="first">THE mark on Jethro Parker's chest faded. Until it was
  entirely gone from the skin under his black mat of hair, I did not move.</p>

  <p>I could not have moved if I wanted to. I was held rigid within a tight
  shell of dread, all the more fearsome because I did not know, did not
  understand, what it was I had to dread. I might still be standing like that,
  if there had not been a sudden rush of light footfalls in the hall outside
  the room and a boyish voice crying, "Miss Horne! Miss Horne!" I turned in
  time to see a butterfly net come across the door opening, and Percy White
  appear behind it. The undersized youngster peered at me through the thick
  lenses without which he was blind as a bat.</p>

  <p>"Anything wrong, Miss Horne?" he panted. "I heard you scream and then I
  heard the window smash, and I came running from the woods."</p>

  <p>"No, Perce." I managed to smile. "There isn't anything wrong. I&mdash;I
  tripped and cried out, and my elbow went through the window. I'm sorry. I
  startled you."</p>

  <p>"Aw gee!" The excitement died out of his face. "And I was just sneaking up
  on a Gold-banded Skipper. The books say they don't come as far North as this,
  but I'm sure this was one. It was perched on top of a goldenrod
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Maybe it's still there, Percy. Better run and see."</p>

  <p>"Do you think so? Golly!" He scampered away, the killing-box hung by a
  strap from his neck thumping against the wall as he went.</p>

  <p>The interruption brought me back to normal. It hadn't happened, I told my
  self. I hadn't seen Parker pluck an invisible something from his chest and
  throw it through the window.</p>

  <p>But the window <i>was</i> broken. There was no getting around that. And
  there was no reasonable explanation of how it came to be so. Or if there
  were, only Jethro Parker could give it to me.</p>

  <p>I recalled what I knew about scopolamine, how though one under its
  influence retains no conscious recollection of what occurs to him, his
  subconscious memory will respond to questioning more truthfully than the
  waking one could.</p>

  <p>I closed the door, and drew a chair up to the bedside. I took the farmer's
  gnarled, work-worn hand in mine. It closed on my fingers, confidingly, and I
  was abruptly ashamed of what I had done, to him, of what I was about to do.
  But I had to know what had happened here in this room.</p>

  <p>"Don't wake up," I said, clearly, distinctly. "Don't wake up, Jethro, but
  listen to me and answer me. Do you hear me, Jethro?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Deep-toned, husky, the voice that came from him was unfamiliar.</p>

  <p>"What made you scream, Jethro?"</p>

  <p>"Heavy&mdash;on my chest." It was as if someone else, some utter stranger,
  were speaking to me <i>through</i> him. "Lips, wet lips, mumbling my skin.
  Sucking." His stubbled, gaunt countenance was relaxed. "Woke me because I
  was&mdash;not really&mdash;asleep."</p>

  <p>"What did you do?"</p>

  <p>"Grabbed him. He fought&mdash;little hands fought me."</p>

  <p>I was cold, quivering cold. "Paws, you mean." I could not help the
  interruption. "Paws, Jethro," I begged him to say.</p>

  <p>"No. Hands. Baby hands. But no baby. Too&mdash;strong. No&mdash;baby. I
  jumped up&mdash;tore him away. Threw him..."</p>

  <p>"What was it?" It was my own voice that was unfamiliar now, thin, edged
  with shrillness. "What was it you saw?"</p>

  <p>"Saw nothing. Felt. Only felt."</p>

  <p>"What was it you felt? Jethro! What was it you felt?"</p>

  <p>Intonationless, mechanical, the weird, hoarse tones answered me. "Man.
  Little man. Wee man of Wanooka. Come back&mdash;out of the lake&mdash;like
  Injun Joe&mdash;told me they would&mdash;told me&mdash;long ago..."</p>

  <p>The voice faded. Jethro Parker tossed restlessly in his sleep, turned
  over. The whisper that came from his lips was more nearly his own voice. It
  breathed, "No, mother. I won't go round with Injun Joe&mdash;no more."</p>

  <p>I asked no more questions. I sat there, my eyes on the sleeping man, not
  seeing him. I was thinking of what Shean Morphy had cried out, last night in
  his drink-madness. "The leprechauns are all about. The Wee Folk!" I was
  thinking of the wraiths I had seen, or thought I had seen, creeping through
  the woods.</p>

  <p>But more than all else I was thinking of the red blotch that had been,
  that morning, on Charlie Dorsey's sun-bronzed chest. The redness that had
  faded, before I was through bathing him, from his skin and from my
  thoughts.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>Continuation of Hugh Lambert's narrative:</em></p><br>

  <p class="first">I COULD see nothing but, the white, dazzling blaze of the
  <i>kitor</i>. I could feel nothing but its terrific heat. But I could hear
  out of the heart of that glare, Vanark's voice.</p>

  <p>"Your end, Hughlambert." And then again, but more slowly, somehow puzzled.
  "I'm rid of you." Puzzled and uncertain.</p>

  <p>I, too, was puzzled. That white brilliance stabbed my eyes though their
  lids were tight shut against it, yet otherwise I was merely hot. Sweat bathed
  me, crawling between the <i>sibral</i> that still clad me and my skin. I was
  parched. But I had endured scarcely less discomfort on the unshaded salt-sands
  of Death Valley one mid-August day. Surely,&mdash;if I were
  melting&mdash;</p>

  <p>The light was gone!</p>

  <p>My eyelids flew open. I saw great fuzzy rings; green, orange; continually
  expanding from a scarlet center vivid against throbbing blackness. I was
  blinded, dazed, but I was still whole. Still alive!</p>

  <p>Somewhere within the phantasmagoria into which I stared there was
  movement.</p>

  <p>"<i>Watch it</i>!" Fenton screamed. "He's going to shoot!"</p>

  <p>I leaped at that adumbration of movement, came against a body. My hand
  caught a skinny wrist; slipped over clenched fingers; caught cold metal, the
  flaring barrel of a <i>coret</i>; twisted it sideward. Sight beginning to
  return showed me the dim outline of a head. My free hand lashed to the throat
  just beneath it. Gripped!</p>

  <p>Vanark wrenched at his <i>coret</i>, trying to get it loose. He lurched
  against me, fighting my hold. Despair, terror, must have doubled his
  strength, for he forced me back. Rage doubled mine, I braced a leg behind me,
  held him...</p>

  <p>My foot slipped in the wetness on the floor&mdash;wetness that once had been a
  youthful subaltern of the guard. I went down. My holds wrenched loose and I
  was on my knees. Seeing more clearly now, I saw Vanark reel backward, catch
  himself, slice his weapon down to pointblank aim.</p>

  <p>His evil countenance, aflame with hate, seared itself on my brain. Triumph
  flared in his malevolent eyes. The <i>kitor</i> had failed, they said, but
  the <i>coret</i> would not fail.</p>

  <p>The red-glowing tube ended its arc, in line with my head. Its scarlet beam
  shot out&mdash;harmlessly past me.</p>

  <p>In the ultimate instant a form had catapulted from above, onto Vanark's
  shoulders! It had pounded him to the floor, and the two were battling, Vanark
  and the other who had saved me.</p>

  <p>He was a Surahnit! This much I saw as I came to my feet, eager to help,
  but more than that I could not make out as the combatants whirled over and
  over, clawing furiously at one another, silent save for the furious small
  sounds they made despite themselves; the tiny snarling sounds.</p>

  <p>There was a dull thud before I could spring in, the impact of bone against
  the massive <i>lural</i> support of some machine my rescuer's skull had
  struck. It stunned him, momentarily at least. Vanark tore free, leaped erect.
  He still clung to the <i>coret</i>. It flailed down to annihilate his
  opponent.</p>

  <p>I shouted incoherently. My thigh muscles exploded, hurled me at the
  enraged Rata in a low flying tackle. Seeing and reacting instantaneously,
  Vanark sprang sidewise to avoid me. Not quite far enough. My reaching arms
  missed him but my shoulder struck his thigh, sent him sprawling into the
  gray, solid-seeming stone.</p>

  <p>Wrath robbing me of reason, I surged up, plunged in pursuit. Blue light
  flashed across the wall's surface in the instant before I crashed into it.
  <i>Crashed!</i> It bruised, battered me, as solid now as it had seemed. An
  impenetrable barrier!</p>

  <p>Pinned to it by the momentum of my leap, my breath jolted out of my lungs,
  I was aware of a blue shimmer flowing over that wall, an electric vibrancy it
  had not before possessed. Something had transformed it, in the eye blink of
  time between when Vanark had reeled out through it and when I reached it, to
  impenetrable rock.</p>

  <p>"Antil!" The exclamation, behind me, throbbed with the mellowness of a
  golden-stringed harp. "Antil. You&mdash;you are not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Dead." Other tones, shaken, gasping, but oddly-insouciant with it all,
  responded. "Not even hurt&mdash;much."</p>

  <p>"Jeehoshaphat!" Fenton's voice was harsh, crude, in contrast to those
  others. "Jeerusalem. What&mdash;how&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Fenton was a stride away from where I had last seen him; amazement was
  written large on his big-boned countenance. Behind him to one side of the
  great screen, was Leeahlee.</p>

  <p>Her slim white hand clung to a silvery switch handle in the wall as if she
  had just thrown it, but her lissome body was twisted away from it and her
  gray eyes were wide with anxiety.</p>

  <p>"You come through the wall." The farmer's accents were a dull monotone his
  astonishment flattening all expression out of them as a typhoon's onset
  flattens the Indian Ocean. "They come through the ceiling. But there ain't no
  doors in wall <i>nor</i> ceiling."</p>

  <p>It was the Surahnit at whom Leeahlee stared, her soul in her eyes. He was
  dragging himself up by the <i>lural</i> machine-base that had almost done for
  him. Now he was on his feet, facing Leeahlee.</p>

  <p>"Good girl," he gasped. "You've sealed this chamber against Vanark. He
  dares not reveal its existence to have it blasted to dust and us with it. We
  are safe here."</p>

  <p>"Safe, Antil," Leeahlee responded. "From Vanark. He cannot reach us to
  harm us as long as we keep the chamber sealed. But as long as we keep it
  sealed neither can we leave it. Quick death by Vanark's <i>coret</i> outside,
  slow death by thirst and starvation within, either way we are doomed."</p>

  <p>"Doomed," Jeremiah Fenton breathed, echoing her.</p><br>

  <p class="first">ANTIL was swarthy as the Surahnit I had seen,
  sharp-featured, as they, but he was subtly different from the other men of
  Mernia's dominant race.</p>

  <p>"We are safe for the moment, Leeahlee," he said. "Let us be content with
  that."</p>

  <p>His difference from the others of his race did not lie alone in that he
  was clad in the chastely white, close-fitting garment of the Taphetnit, its
  wing slits sewn together. He was straight and slender as a sturdy birch and
  there was a shining quality of youth about him. He was poised lightly on the
  balls of his feet, the pose of his fine head jaunty, confident.</p>

  <p>He faced Leeahlee, the hint of a smile on his thin, wistful lips, a hint
  of sadness edging his profile.</p>

  <p>The girl said something more. I was aware that she spoke, but I did not
  hear what she said. A sudden realization had flashed on me.</p>

  <p>Not long ago I had seen another profile, older, the ebony hair topping it
  graying at the temples, but otherwise a replica of this one. That face
  existed no longer, self-blasted into extinction by its own <i>coret</i>. That
  face was Colonel Skoolteh's. Antil's could be only the face of the son the
  subaltern of long ago had watched vanish in the arms of a Taphet.</p>

  <p>Nothing could be more certain. Antil was the Surahnit who dwelt in
  Calinore. He was the leader of the brewing revolt of the Taphetnit, and he
  was here, in the Listeners Post, as a spy on his own race against whom that
  revolt was brewing.</p>

  <p>"Maybe Vanark won't dare report your presence," I said. "But Nalinah will.
  She saw you in the room with Leeahlee and she tried to tell Vanark about
  it."</p>

  <p>Antil swung to me. "We were not quick enough then, in having you cut off
  the search-ray?" His smile was gone, his expression bleak, his eyes
  thoughtful.</p>

  <p>"Evidently not. Look here, mister. You tried to kill a defenseless woman,
  but I owe you something for saving my life. That's why I am telling you this.
  Vanark wouldn't let Nalinah talk, but by this time she must have told her
  story to Nal Surah, whoever he is, and the Nal must already be after you. If
  you have anyway of escaping you'd better get busy."</p>

  <p>"No," Antil answered, speaking softly. "Nalinah has not told her story to
  the Nal. He is too busy to give her audience. We were watching&mdash;but see
  for yourself." He bounded lithely across the room, touched a switch alongside
  the one Leeahlee had thrown to isolate this chamber.</p>

  <p>His slender, vibrant frame was silhouetted, not against, the screen to
  which an instant ago it had leaped, but against a far-flung vista of
  six-sided, squat buildings that ran smoothly toward us, fanning out and
  sliding past the frame of the huge paneless window out of which we seemed to
  look. So realistic was the illusion that the wall had vanished, that before I
  could catch myself I made an involuntary forward movement to grab Antil's arm
  lest he fall out.</p>

  <p>"Gee Whittakers!" the farmer ejaculated. "We're moving! Fast!"</p>

  <p>I felt it, too&mdash;that sensation of swift, vibrationless gliding
  through Tashna's alien streets. "Shhh," I hissed. "They'll hear&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They cannot hear us," Antil interrupted, "but if we wish we can hear
  them." There was an audible click, and there was in my ears the murmur of a
  vast crowd.</p>

  <p>It was low at first, but it grew momentarily louder as we neared its
  sources; grew louder still until it was the roar of the sea on a lonely
  beach, until it was the growl of a hurricane sweeping the jungle. The
  buildings lining a last street slid past the sides of the screen, and ended.
  Motion ended, too.</p>

  <p>Tashna's great Plaza lay before us. Their roar now tremendous about us; an
  uncountable throng of Surahnit ringed the concourse's central space where a
  squadron of the L.S.G. were drawn up in rigid, ruler-straight ranks. This
  squared, emerald phalanx faced the topless pillar at the Plaza's hub.</p>

  <p>They were stiffly at attention, those green-dressed Mernian soldiers, and
  statuesque, but each chiseled face was marked by awe, by a veneration almost
  transcending piety.</p>

  <p>I heard Fenton murmur, half to himself, half aloud. "They look like they
  was in church." That was true. The light on those dark countenances was that
  which glorifies the visages of the congregation in some cathedral at the
  moment the Host is unveiled.</p>

  <p>In my dream, and when I had seen it from the spiraling, <i>lusan</i> ramp
  whose distant trestle was a sharp-lined tracery against Mernia's brooding
  sky, the crystal pillar had been alive with a roil of spectrum-tinted vapors.
  Its variegated hues had deepened now, so that the shaft blazed with the red
  and purple and orange of a sunrise over the Sahara and was a nearly
  unendurable splendor.</p>

  <p>They were not still, those hues, but flowed upward unendingly within the
  very substance of the immense column, streaming out of a wide, flat plinth
  iron which the pillar soared. On this platform Surahnit men and women,
  perhaps a dozen, stood facing the soldiers. They were in two groups, silent,
  expectant, and across the platform in the gap dividing them lay a carpet of
  ruby light.</p>

  <p>"Antil," Leeahlee murmured. "There is one missing among the Ratanit.
  Who?"</p>

  <p>The scene leaped forward. We seemed to be at the very edge of the dais,
  seemed to be within arm's reach of its occupants.</p>

  <p>Each held a <i>kitor</i> and each was clothed in an iridescent robe like
  that which Nalinah had worn, the only difference between the men's and the
  women's that the former were shorter kirtled. I leaned forward, scanning the
  dusky, vulturine faces.</p>

  <p>Vanark was there, clad like the others. His lids were drooped, veiling
  what must have been a very hell of frustration and rage in his beady eyes.
  Vanark had gotten there somehow. But&mdash;but Nalinah had not.</p>

  <p>She did not fit among them, I thought. Other than Vanark, these Ratanit
  were ancient, their masklike countenances seamed and sere. Among them her
  fragile laughing beauty would be out of place as a blossom-mantled apple tree
  in a dead orchard. But her absence was ominous. What had happened to her?
  Where was she?</p>

  <p>I glared at the vari-hued pillar behind the Ratanit, as much of it as was
  now visible, as if it could give me the answer.</p><br>

  <p class="first">ABRUPTLY the column's base flashed wholly scarlet, so that
  it seemed one with the riband of light that streamed across the platform, and
  in that instant there welled out of the shaft a single, deep-toned bell
  stroke.</p>

  <p>The crowd-roar surged upward in volume, a Niagara of appalling
  sound...</p>

  <p>And cut off! The sudden silence was like a thunderclap.</p>

  <p>Leeahlee's breath, catching in her throat, made a littler whimper. Out of
  the corner of my eye I saw that she had come close to Antil, the tiny oval of
  her face pallid and strained, and that his arm was protectingly about
  her.</p>

  <p>"Look, Mr. Lambert!" Fenton's horny clutch gripped my elbow. "Look
  there!"</p>

  <p>His forefinger jabbed at the pediment of Tashna's great shaft,
  backgrounding the waiting Ratanit. Within the crimson depths there was a
  swirl of shadow, shapeless, textured like the phantom of a dream.</p>

  <p>They were turning, those upon the platform; to the pillar. The silence was
  brittle now, like a bubble of glass strained to the shattering point. The
  tension of the great, crowd I could not see caught me up, an electric tremor
  almost unendurable.</p>

  <p>The shadow within the pillar was at its surface; was breaking through. The
  silence splintered into a gasp from twenty thousand throats.</p>

  <p>A man stood before the scarlet flame of the pylon, where the scarlet
  light-ribbon joined it!</p>

  <p>"<i>Gor Sarah!</i>" crashed out of the screen. "<i>Gor, Nal
  Surah!</i>"</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>Statement of Edith Horne, R.N., continued:</em></p><br>

  <p class="first">I DON'T know where the rest of that last day of August went
  to. I lived it through mechanically. I didn't think any more about what
  Jethro Parker had done or said. I didn't think about Charlie Dorsey. I tried
  not to think at all. I was simply waiting for Dr. Stone to return to
  camp.</p>

  <p>It was not until long after sunset that I heard the squeal of his brakes
  at the camp gate. Even then I waited, inside the infirmary. I heard his car
  door slam. After a little while I heard the gravel crunch under his feet. He was
  coming slowly, wearier than I had ever known him to be.</p>

  <p>I opened the door for him before he knocked, and only then realized that I
  had been sitting in the dark, that I had not turned on the light because I
  was afraid of what I might see.</p>

  <p>Queerly enough Doctor Stone said nothing about its being dark. He stumbled
  across the little office room that makes a sort of entrance foyer to the
  infirmary. The smell of formaldehyde came in with him I saw him only as a
  dark bulk in the darkness, but I heard his long, slow breathing. The chair at
  the desk creaked as he settled into it.</p>

  <p>I fumbled for the switch tumbler beside the door, pushed it up. The
  darkness vanished, Dr. Stone was looking at me and his face was the gray of
  weathered wood. His Vandyke was a trim black triangle on his chin, but there
  were deep lines radiating from the corners of his eyes, and his cheeks seemed
  to have sunk in. He looked old.</p>

  <p>"You're very tired, doctor," I said, moving to him. "Let me take your hat
  and help you off with your coat. I'll make some tea for you on my little
  electric stove and you'll feel better after you've had some." I had been
  waiting years, it seemed, to talk to him, and I could not. Not in the
  condition he was in.</p>

  <p>"Edith," he said, not making a move. "Adath Jenks died today."</p>

  <p>I stopped, puzzled. "Adath Jenks?"</p>

  <p>"The first of the two cases of this strange coma that was brought to the
  hospital. He died sometime today, we don't know just when because he's-been
  so nearly dead for a week. I've just come from the post mortem in the morgue.
  I performed the necroscopy myself, the first time in years."</p>

  <p>That accounted for the odor of formaldehyde that clung to, him "Well?" I
  asked. "What did you find?"</p>

  <p>"It is not an encephalitis. The brain and the nervous system-were
  perfectly normal. It is not a glandular malfunction. There is no aberration
  of the endocrines. It is not a disorder of the digestive system or of the
  respiratory tract. There is scar tissue in the left lobe of the lung, healed
  traces of an arrested pulmonary tuberculosis the man never knew he had, but
  otherwise these organs show no lesions of any kind."</p>

  <p>He stopped there. He'd forgotten some thing. Or had he forgotten it? "The
  circulatory system?" I could not get my voice above a whisper. "The heart and
  arteries and veins?"</p>

  <p>The surgeon's fingers closed on a paper on which his hand had happened to
  fall, crushed it. "What makes you ask that?" he demanded, his eyes abruptly
  veiled.</p>

  <p>"You did find something wrong with them!" I exclaimed. "What?"</p>

  <p>"No. Not with the heart or arteries or veins. With the capillaries in the
  superficial tissues of the cadaver's chest. I noticed a vague discoloration
  there, incised, found&mdash;found&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What? In God's name <i>what?</i>" I knew. As if I had been there I knew
  what its probing scalpel had laid bare in Adath Jenks chest.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE capillaries, the network of hair-like blood vessels,
  were hypertrophied, enlarged, and their walls split. As if&mdash;as if the
  mouth of a suction pump had been applied there for a long time, drawing out
  blood plasma.</p>

  <p>"Sucking it out, doctor?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"But how is it that this was not suspected? How is it that with all the
  trained watchers in the hospital a progressive anemia was not detected?"</p>

  <p>"There was no anemia. I had the blood drained from the corpse, its
  quantity measured. There was no deficiency."</p>

  <p>Was I wrong? "Then in spite of appearances no blood was really drained
  from Jenks. Perhaps it was a blow on the chest."</p>

  <p>"Have you ever seen a bruise in which the capillaries were enlarged? No,
  Edith, it was not a blow that caused the condition. Blood had been sucked
  from Adath Jenks, all the blood he had&mdash;and other blood was substituted
  for it!"</p>

  <p>It was my hand that reached for the desk now, clung to it for support.
  "That&mdash;that sounds utterly insane. How could there have been a complete
  transfusion before the farmer was admitted without some evidence of it? Or
  afterward, in the ward, without the knowledge of the attendants?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I don't know! But it happened, somehow, while Jenks was
  lying there in the ward, never a moment alone."</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;what makes you so sure?"</p>

  <p>"Just this. When the farmer was admitted we thought a transfusion might be
  indicated and typed his blood. It was Type II, agglutinated by I and III,
  agglutinating III and IV. I took a sample of the blood drawn from his corpse
  to my own laboratory, typed it myself. And&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It was not the same?"</p>

  <p>"It was not the same. Edith! It now agglutinates the corpuscles of Type IV
  and none of the sera of the other standard types agglutinates it!"</p>

  <p>I understood now why the surgeon's face was filmed with gray. I understood
  why deep within his keen eyes a glimmer of horror crawled. My own face must
  also have been colorless, gray.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but that was what the blood of the tramp was like," I
  whispered, "who vanished from your surgery."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Edith. The blood of the tramp, and the blood of&mdash;Hugh
  Lambert."</p>

  <p>We stared at each other, stared into each other's eyes. For a long moment
  there was a pregnant, significant silence. Then Doctor Stone was talking
  again.</p>

  <p>"I went back to the hospital and I took a sample of the blood of the other
  patient, Job Gant, and I returned to my laboratory and tested that. I checked
  and rechecked, and I am certain that my results are correct.</p>

  <p>"Unheard of as it may be, the blood of Job Grant is a mixture of two
  types. One is Type IV. The other is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The same as Jenks and Lambert's and the tramp's." I don't know how I
  contrived to speak, with the fingers of hysteria-closing on my throat. "Of
  course. It is changing. When it has all changed Job Gant will die. When they
  are through with him, when the little invisible men are through sucking
  Gant's blood, he will die."</p>

  <p>"The little, invisible&mdash;" The doctor came up out of his chair then.
  "Edith! What are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>He listened to me. His look never left my face as I told him of the
  nightmare through which I had lived that day, and because of the strength
  that look gave me, I could tell him about it in a low, even tone-that never
  once broke.</p>

  <p>While I talked I heard the rustle of a sleepy breeze through the
  needle-laden boughs of the pine trees, the shrill piping of the crickets and
  the quiet lap, lap of the waters of Lake Wanooka. It was so quiet, there in
  the lap of the ancient hills. So peaceful.</p>

  <p>Somewhere far off I heard Dickie Doring's gay laugh ring out. From an
  almost immeasurable distance came the long, melancholy hoot of a locomotive
  rushing through the autumn night. That would be the Twentieth Century, I
  thought, even as I went on with my breathless tale, rushing toward New York
  with its load of human happiness and human griefs and human hopes.</p>

  <p class="first">I GAZED at the Master of Mernia, brought so near to me by
  the magic of that screen that it seemed I need but to take a step forward to
  touch him; and Homeric laughter rumbled in my breast.</p>

  <p>He stood there in the pulsing heart of that living, crimson flame. The
  kitos of the Ratanit were flung toward him in salute, and I knew that every
  left arm in the vast assemblage lay outstretched in humble salutation to
  their Nal, their Overlord.</p>

    <p class="caption">He stood there in the pulsing heart of that living,
    crimson flame.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This was their Emperor. This was their god, or if not god, then his vicar
  in the subterranean cavern that is their world. This&mdash;creature!</p>

  <p>The ruby light that bathed him could not conceal the yeasty gray-whiteness
  of his skin, pallid and flabby as the substance of a slug. The Intricate
  adornment of his jeweled robe, his spired headgear from which blazed; limned
  in diamonds and topazes and rubies, the design of the sun and its circling
  planets, could not lend to his grossly corpulent form the least trace of
  majesty. The brooding scowl drawn upon his pendulous-chinned,
  quivering-cheeked countenance, with its small mouth and its fat-drowned, tiny
  eyes, invested it with no force whatever and no dignity.</p>

  <p>He was just a fat man, slightly vulgar in the display of his trappings,
  slightly comic in, the divinity he assumed.</p>

  <p>"So that's your Nal Surah," I gibed. "That's the great man you fear and
  worship."</p>

  <p>"Wait." I think it was Antil who said that. "Wait, Hula."</p>

  <p>The scene was retreating. I saw the soldiers again, their arms dropping to
  their sides after that salute. I saw the crowd ringing the Plaza, motionless
  now, rapt, breathless with attention.</p>

  <p>He was holding them. The fat man was holding them; by what magic of
  tradition, by what necromancy of personality, I had not yet fathomed.</p>

  <p>There was, of course, the dramatic entrance he had made out of the
  tremendous pylon that once more dominated the panorama; lifting to some
  unguessable height against the drab sky in whose middle distance the
  ramifications of the <i>lusan</i> highway's spiral strode Tashna's encircling
  chasm. But that <i>was</i> a trick, and they were too intelligent, these
  Surahnit, to believe that it was anything but a trick.</p>

  <p>Unless (and there was basis for this reservation in certain&mdash;may I
  call them superstitions?&mdash;of my own people) the Mernians <i>wished</i>
  to believe that it was not a trick but a miracle.</p>

  <p>"Surahnit!"</p>

  <p>The voice of Nal Surah was not loud. Hearing it as I knew I was, from the
  very edge of the Plaza that was a full two hundred feet from the pylon whence
  he spoke, its every syllable was distinct as though it were spoken in my
  ear.</p>

  <p>"Heritors of the Ancient Truths," he went on, "I have called you together,
  this leisure evening hour, from your well earned leisure, to witness a
  ceremony of which there his been no need for seventeen <i>sloonit</i>."</p>

  <p>He paused briefly. "The Taphetnit&mdash;debased race that bows not to the
  suzerainty of the Ratanit who rule the destiny of the Mernian Folk&mdash;have
  forgotten the lesson that was dealt them when last I blessed from this holy
  spot the warriors of Tashna. Once more they threaten the Folk Weal, once more
  defy the edicts of the Law.</p>

  <p>"Nay, more. Lost to all sense of honor, ungrateful for the mercy with
  which we forebore the extinction that they richly merited when they rebelled
  against us, they violated the generous treaty we extended to them even, in
  the very moment they subscribed to it. False and traitorous to the last atom
  of their hideous beings, they concealed from us the existence of the babe of
  a proscribed Surahnit in their midst, and despicably have nurtured him to
  this very day. Not content to wallow in the night of ignorance that blackens
  their city of Calinore, they plot now against the Surahnit, against Tashna,
  seeking to drag you down to their own bestial level."</p><br>

  <p class="first">A MURMUR ran through the throng, a low and ominous growl.
  Nal Surah's tone began to deepen, to rise in volume. A practiced orator, he
  was playing upon the emotions of his listeners as a skilled organist plays
  upon his console, and they were responding to him as the pipes respond to the
  touch on the organ's keys.</p>

  <p>"We have been patient with the Taphetnit. Through the long ages we have
  held our wrath in check, believing that some time they would grow to know the
  enlightenment to which we of the Surahnit have attained.</p>

  <p>"And what is our reward? What, I ask you?"</p>

  <p>There was a pause. It lengthened. There was the beginning of a stir in the
  crowd, checked at the very instant of its inception by the Nal's pealing cry:
  "Surahnit!"</p>

  <p>"The wheel of our fate has turned almost full circle," Nal Surah went on.
  "Yet a little, only a little, and the Folk return to that Elysium from which
  in ages past we were banished for our sins. Yet only a little and this drab
  sky that arches over us shall, be replaced by another sky ablaze with the
  colors whose memory has been kept alive for us by this Shaft of the Eternal
  Truth before which I stand. The moment of our delivery from exile is at hand
  and nothing can defeat it."</p>

  <p>There was a light on the faces of the people, the light of a dawning hope
  in their eyes. Nal Surah dropped to a whisper, a hiss of penetrating
  sound.</p>

  <p>"Nothing? Aye. <i>They</i> can alter our destiny if we permit it.
  They&mdash;the barbarians of Calinore, with their sly schemes; their
  insidious treacheries, their open rebellion." That voice was rising in a slow
  crescendo of fury. "They, our mortal enemies, would cheerfully destroy
  themselves if by so doing they can drag us down to destruction. Shall we
  permit it?"</p>

  <p>"No!" the answer blared. "No!"</p>

  <p>"You answer no, and I say to you, no! I say to you, they must be
  destroyed. There must be left not a single Taphet, not a single feather of
  that base and ignoble race in all the land of Mernia. Surahnit! Calinore must
  be destroyed!"</p>

  <p>"Calinore must be destroyed!" He had lashed them to fury at last. They
  roared, as in a distant time, in a distant place another mob once roared:
  "<i>Carthago delenda est</i>!"</p>

  <p>No, Nal Surah was no longer ridiculous. He was still a fat man, standing
  there on the pylon, his triple chins quivering on his bosom, his naked face
  utterly expressionless, but he was not ridiculous.</p>

  <p>I should have remembered that it is the internal quality of a man that
  places in his hands the reins of power over a people and not his appearance.
  I should have recalled a certain strutting, square-jawed, pompous shouter; a
  certain individual whose clipped mustache is a black dribble from his pinched
  nostrils, and a certain round-faced, brush-mustached, suavely smiling leader
  whose word is life or death to a hundred and fifty million humans.</p>

  <p>Nal Surah did not raise his hand. Remade no gesture that I could detect.
  But suddenly the shouting crowd was silent; and he was speaking again;
  quietly, to the squadron of soldiers drawn up in rigid ranks before him.</p>

  <p>"You have heard the voice of the Folk, men of the L.S.G. You have heard,
  not my command, nor that of the Ratanit, but the command of the Folk. Go now
  and obey it. Go now and assure the fulfilment of our destiny. Go! <i>Destroy
  Calinore</i>!"</p>

  <p>"We're in for it now." It was Antil who spoke. I had forgotten his
  presence, forgotten that I was not a Surahnit, watching my fellows being
  dedicated to a holy crusade. "You accused me of trying to kill Ra Nalinah,
  awhile ago. I did not try to kill her, but I did plan to take her hostage,
  hoping in that way to forestall what you have just seen."</p>

  <p>"You would not have stopped it," I answered him. "Nothing can stop that
  man, once he has determined on a course of action."</p>

  <p>"We can still try," he responded. "Hula, you and I can still try to save
  our peoples. I can still try to save the Taphetnit and you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused. He was leaning forward again to the screen, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"And I?"</p>

  <p>"And you," Antil finished his sentence, his tone far-away, "can try to
  save your human kind. For, Hula my friend, if the Taphetnit are destroyed
  then there is no longer any hope for the Upper World. No hope at all."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" I exclaimed. "What connection is there between your
  Taphetnit and my human kind? What have we to do with anything that's going on
  here?"</p>

  <p>Antil looked at me queerly. "Would you want to know, my friend?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Yes, of course." I grasped the youth's arm. "Tell me!"</p>

  <p>"Tell him, Antil," Leeahlee breathed. "Tell him what it is the Taphetnit
  struggle against."</p>

  <p>"No!" A strange quiver was running through the Surahnit, I felt it under
  my grip, I heard it in his voice. He was watching the imaged proceedings on
  the Plaza with a queer tensity, the L.S.G. squadron filing before the
  platform while the Nal gestured over their heads in some outr ritual of
  blessing. "No. I'll show him," he said.</p>

  <p>The Plaza flicked the screen. I was gazing at another scene, a huge cave;
  its walls smooth, darkly shining; a gallery running along one of them, fifty
  feet above a floor cluttered with machinery. I recognized it, the cavern
  within the great Eastern Wall of Mernia, where I had seen dead humans.</p>

  <p>They were no longer dead, those humans. They were upon their feet, dozens
  upon dozens of them, towering above the tiny Surahnit who had been tending
  them. Humans, did I call them? They had human form, but they were living
  cadavers, animate corpses of men and women who had been long-drowned, their
  bodies gross and lumpy and putty-gray, their countenances vacuous, their eyes
  not glazed, not blind, but seeing not what was before them, but the memory of
  that which it is eternally forbidden to know.</p>

  <p>"You heard the Nal, Hula," Antil murmured in my ear. "Do you know now what
  it is he named the destiny of the Folk?"</p>

  <p>And then, half dazed with sickness and horror, I was gazing at the Plaza
  again. In those few moments there had been an abrupt change out there. The
  crowd was a sea of upturned faces. The soldiers were wheeling eastward, their
  hands tugging at the <i>corets</i> in their belts, jerking the splay-muzzled
  weapons from their holsters. The Nal, the Ratanit, were swinging toward the
  East. From somewhere a long-drawn siren note wailed an alarm.</p>

  <p>"Yes; Antil," I groaned, "I know now. They mean to invade the Upper World.
  Those&mdash;those Things, are going out before them, to lead them; and it is
  only the Taphetnit who stay that dreadful invasion. But why?"</p>

  <p>He did not answer. He was crouched, his whole soul concentrated on the
  scene in the screen. It was not at the Plaza he was looking. His eyes were
  staring into the eastern sky.</p>

  <p>Undertoning the howling siren I was aware of a distant swish, like that of
  a hurricane's forerunning wind through palm fronds. But there were no palms
  in Mernia, no trees...</p>

  <p>"Antil," Leeahlee throbbed. "Antil! What is it? What is that sound?"</p>

  <p>I don't know if he answered or not. Still sick with what I had seen in the
  cavern, I was watching a peculiar pearly iridescence glimmer along the
  distant horizon like the first glint of dawn on the edge of a watery plain. A
  cloud lifted out of that faraway mystery, its whiteness a-sparkle with the
  million variegated hues of diamond-shattered sunlight. It scudded toward
  Tashna on the breast of the typhoon's whirring whistle that now blanketed the
  siren's warning wail.</p>

  <p>And there was sound a-plenty in the city's Central Plaza. The trample of
  panic-stricken feet as the crowd burst apart and rushed to seek shelter where
  no shelter could be found from a storm above. Shrill cries of terror. Hoarse,
  crisp shouts of the L.S.G. subalterns, and the rasp of leather as their
  underlings knelt in the open space, <i>corets</i> lifted and ready. Other
  shouts from the Watchers in the crow's nest on the trestle of the
  <i>lusan</i> ramp. Quavering cries from the senile Ratanit stuttering to the
  edges of their dais; waving their <i>kitors</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Corets</i> and <i>kitors</i> against a storm cloud! Had panic robbed
  them of their reason?</p>

  <p>But it was no cloud. Nearer now with incredible speed, the threat in the
  sky was resolved into thousands of flashing white forms, thousands of great
  multicolored wings. No wind, but the beat of those wings, made that
  whistling, ominous roar. No storm, but a horde of Taphetnit, drove swift upon
  terrified Tashna.</p>

  <p>"Hold your fire!" a command cracked from the Plaza. "Hold your fire till
  they are overhead."</p>

  <p>It was Vanark who had barked that order. Straddle-legged in the scarlet
  glow from, which Nal Surah had vanished as mysteriously as he had appeared;
  the Rata appeared far more fit for that station of honor than he whose right
  it was to occupy it. The open space was empty now save for the grimly
  kneeling soldiers and the aged but indomitable Ratanit lining the platform.
  <i>Corets</i> and <i>kitors</i> upraised and ready, they awaited the
  Taphetnit.</p>

  <p>That swift, jeweled flock came on, a handful of opals flung across the
  sullen sky by some unseen giant. High, high they flew, but each glorious
  figure was distinct, tiny, doll-small.</p>

  <p>"Fairies!" Jeremiah Fenton exclaimed. "Jinganeddy, they're
  fairies&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Unarmed," Leeahlee breathed. "Antil! Your Taphetnit have no weapons at
  all. What can they hope&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Watch!" The Surahnit youth's injunction fell flatly from his gray lips.
  "Watch Leeahlee."</p><br>

  <p class="first">THEY had almost reached the city. They were, indeed,
  directly above its encircling chasm. A white and splendid man-bird was
  dropping headlong out of the covey, a whistling, wing-folded arrow of
  light.</p>

  <p>A scarlet flash spat upward from the trestle beneath, and a blazing ember
  tumbled downwards toward the unseen gulf, trailing a black and greasy
  smoke.</p>

  <p>"Oh," the girl moaned. "Oh..."</p>

  <p>"Damn them!" It was I who cursed, the syllables wrung from me.</p>

  <p>"Now!" Antil exclaimed. "<i>Now</i> my children."</p>

  <p>As if they heard, the flock split. Opening in two darting arcs still
  tremendously high above Tashna, they embraced the city in a glittering
  ring.</p>

  <p>And then the whole vast, splendid circle plummeted downward!</p>

  <p>Swift, it seemed to me, as light they dove; but swifter the lurid rays
  from the Watchers' <i>corets</i> flashed to meet them.</p>

  <p>As if some inverted bonfire in the sky rained downward its steamers of
  sparks the flaming victims of the Surahnit weapons fell, but past them
  swooped the Taphetnit who were as yet untouched, past them, down and down,
  and down.</p>

  <p>Scores spun, living torches aflame, down past the airy arcs of the
  bridges, but hundreds alighted on those arches, hundreds clinging to the lacy
  spiral, a buzzing swarm, and suddenly there were no longer any red flashes
  from the crow's nests whence the Nal's Watchers had spied upon the city.</p>

  <p>"Get them!" Vanark shouted from the base of the soaring pylon at Tashna's
  hub. "Destroy them."</p>

  <p>The Plaza vomited a crimson fountain of death, the air was lurid with
  lethal spray. Along the topmost, curves of the trestled spiral the fiery
  destruction ran like larvae scorched from tree limbs by a gardener's blow
  torch, countless winged ones flared briefly and dropped from the girders
  where they had clustered.</p>

  <p>"Your <i>kitors</i>, Ratanit!"</p>

  <p>A white hell burst forth, a hell of sun-bright flame from wands of the
  ancient ones. I could not see&mdash;the denuded girders through that blinding
  blaze. The screen blinked blank&mdash;blinked alive again!</p>

  <p>We were beneath the canopy of the <i>kitors</i> dazzling beams, beneath
  the interlacing curtain of the <i>coret's</i> crimson spray. At our feet
  gaped the black and awful maw of Tashna's bottomless moat and into it poured
  a continual, terrible hail of charred and shapeless lumps that once had been
  gloriously pinioned beings soaring the ambient air.</p>

  <p>A rain drizzled into that chasm too, a rain of yellow and viscid
  droplets.</p>

  <p>From above us, but from beneath the brilliant death-cloud out of which
  sifted that drip of horror, there came a wide spread excited twittering.</p>

  <p>"Jeerusalem the golden!" my one human companion husked. "They're still
  sticking."</p>

  <p>Yes, they were still sticking, those devoted Taphetnit! They were still
  clinging to the lower girders of the spans that arched the abyss, to the
  lower verticles of the viaduct's supports, where they were barely shielded
  from the angling aim of the Surahnit weapons by the city's intervening
  buildings. They were clinging there and they were busy at some frenzied
  activity whose nature I did not at once make out.</p>

  <p>Nor did Leeahlee. "What are they doing, Antil? What have they risked so
  much to do?"</p>

  <p>"Watch." Grief in his tone, and pride. "Watch, Leeahlee. Ah, there it is!
  The first&mdash;"</p>

  <p>That which whizzed down past us and vanished into the abyss was not a
  corpse. It was a long rod of <i>lural</i>, a girder.</p>

  <p>"They're tearing the bridges apart!" I exclaimed hoarsely. "With their
  bare hands!"</p>

  <p>Once that first member of the structure came free, the others were easier.
  Rapidly, now, the web disintegrated, melting swiftly almost as that horde who
  had dared hell itself to destroy the radiating plexus of high-carried roads
  that gave Tashna access to the rest of Mernia. And then the girdered arcs
  were gone and a pitiful remnant of Taphetnit were fluttering away out of that
  inferno, their task accomplished.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE screen went blank on an unspanned chasm, on a city
  isolated by a raid consummated with incredible courage against high
  insuperable odds.</p>

  <p>"There will be no attack on Calinore this night," Antil's voice was flat
  now, unresonant, and all the jauntiness was gone out of him as he turned
  away. "But the cost was more terrible than I had counted it, and it yet
  remains to be seen whether we have gained anything at all."</p>

  <p>"What was it you expected to gain?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Time, Hula, time for you to help me plan how we can defeat the Surahnit,
  and time for us to work out that plan."</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute." I pulled the edge of my hand across my forehead behind
  which mingled in chaos that which I had just witnessed and the terrible scene
  in the Gateway Cavern. "For us&mdash;You haven't been in communication with
  Calinore since you saved me from Vanark. Did you know about me&mdash;before
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. A little. I knew that Vanark had lost track of the emissary he sent
  forth to the Upper World and that he had found him again and was returning
  with him. I knew that when the Ratanit had examined the emissary they would
  be possessed of the information they needed for their invasion of the lands
  above, and that it was most essential to prevent that."</p>

  <p>"Then the trap in the <i>fortlik</i> field was for me, and not for
  Nalinah."</p>

  <p>"No. That was for the Ra, to capture her and hold her as hostage, as I
  said. When the trap was sprung I was above here, in Vanark's cell in the
  Listeners Post, and had been there almost since you entered Mernia." Antil
  was scanning the floor as he answered me. He was looking for something, and I
  wondered what. "Since you began the descent within the Gateway Wall, in fact.
  It was I who controlled your attack on Vanark, I who made you speak and act
  as you did in the guardhouse there."</p>

  <p>"While I lay bound in a corner of the cell," Leeahlee put in, "hating you,
  Antil, for the spy you are and the traitor that I thought you."</p>

  <p>He straightened and looked around at her. "Do you still hate me as a
  traitor, Leeahlee?" he asked softly.</p>

  <p>Her eyes would have told me the answer if her words had not. "No. Not
  since you told of your life among the Taphetnit, of your dreams for them and
  their dreams for Mernia. Not since I listened with you to Hula's talk with Ra
  Nalinah and learned what wrong it is the Nal is determined to
  perpetrate."</p>

  <p>I thought I understood. "This strife between Taphetnit and Surahnit is
  over the latter's desire to conquer the Upper World?"</p>

  <p>"It has been so for, more years than you can count." Antil was searching
  again, more actively now, peering under the various pieces of apparatus that
  cluttered the floor, getting on hands and knees to do so. "The Winged Ones
  have known through the ages that the Mernians only real happiness lies in
  Mernia. The Dark Ones&mdash;" He stopped suddenly, dived under a sloping
  cabinet. "Here it is!" He squirmed out, held up Nalinah's <i>kitor</i>. "I
  saw it drop from Vanark's hand and I knew it must be somewhere here. This,
  Hula, is in part proof of the Taphetnit's holdings."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"This orb"&mdash;he pointed to the central ball&mdash;"can blaze with a
  light that is not of Mernia but somehow was brought, with them by the
  Ancients who first sought refuge here. That light, Hula, as you have seen,
  will utterly destroy a Mernian, yet full in its blaze you were not harmed.
  Why do you think this was?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't the least idea."</p>

  <p>"Because it is the light of your Sun. Because in its spectrum there are
  vibrations that to you are life, to us agony and death. Similar we are, Hula,
  humans and Mernians, because we stem from a common root, but because for
  aeons we have dwelt amidst vibration at opposite ends of the scale of that
  form of energy that is matter, the very essence of our beings have become
  different. We cannot live at all in your daylight. In your night we can exist
  a <i>roha</i> or two, and then must flee or we die."</p>

  <p>"Wait. That sounds almost reasonable, but the evidence is against you.
  Neither I nor Fenton have felt any discomfort here."</p>

  <p>"Because the wave lengths of our spectrum, beginning at the violet end of
  yours, and going beyond it are not as deadly to you as to us are the red and
  infrared with which your very atmosphere is saturated, and which here are
  unknown."</p>

  <p>I recalled how before my eyes had become accustomed to the colors of this
  cavern everything had appeared to me a different shade of violet or purple.
  "But how is it then that the Surahnit dare even think of living in our
  world?"</p>

  <p>"They have learned how to change themselves. They&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Antil!" Leeahlee had adjusted something very like a set of earphones to
  her pretty head. "Antil! I've tuned to Vanark's thoughts. He is hastening to
  the Nal. In his rage at what the Taphetnit have done he has cast discretion
  to the winds and he is determined to tell of this chamber, of your presence
  here. He is concocting some explanation for its existence that he hopes will
  save him from the Nal's wrath, but he is determined to chance even that, for
  his revenge on you and Hula."</p>

  <p>"That's swell." I grinned, without humor. "That's lovely. We can make a
  lot of plans now, Antil, but they won't do us much good. The Surahnit can't
  get out of Tashna till they repair the bridges, but we can't even get out of
  this room. You didn't think of that, my friend."</p>

  <p>"No?" Antil's calmness seemed to me the quiet of a strong man's despair.
  "Did I not think of that, Hula?"</p>

  <p>"What's it all about?" Jeremiah Fenton's voice was plaintive. "Won't
  somebody please tell me what this is all about? Fairies and gnomes, and
  people going through walls like they wasn't there, I don't believe it. It
  just ain't so."</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>Account of Courtney Stone, M.D., resumed:</em></p><br>

  <p class="first">IF anyone beside Edith Horne had told me her story. I would
  have dismissed it as so much nonsense, but I knew too well how level-headed
  she was; how keenly observant. If any woman can be said to possess scientific
  objectivity she has it.</p>

  <p>I could not, therefore, dismiss her narrative as pure hysteria, much as I
  was tempted to do so. I was compelled to analyze the things she had seen in
  the same manner as I should have had I observed them myself.</p>

  <p>I realized, however, that I was at the moment in no fit state to do so. I
  had allowed myself to be quite too much upset by the discoveries I had made
  during the afternoon of circumstances which however peculiar must have some
  logical explanation. Before I can think normally I must get myself back to
  normal.</p>

  <p>"How about that tea you offered me?" I asked, and I think I managed a
  smile. "Fix it for me while I examine our patients. After we've drunk it
  we'll talk things over."</p>

  <p>She answered my smile with a wistful one of her own. "You don't believe
  me, doctor," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Nonsense, child," I snorted. "Of course I believe you. Get busy, now I'll
  bet you can't boil water without burning it."</p>

  <p>She bristled at that. "Doctor Stone! If I can't cook up a better meal than
  your Mrs. Small, with my eyes closed, I'll eat my hat. Just for that I'm
  going to make some buttered cinnamon toast that will melt in your mouth."</p>

  <p>"Go ahead." I chuckled. "I dare you." I suddenly realized that I had eaten
  neither lunch nor dinner, and was famished. "I can go about six slices." I
  slid off my coat and went out.</p>

  <p>Jethro Parker was sleeping normally, I noticed a couple of boards fastened
  across the broken window. The twisted nails showed that no matter how good a
  nurse Edith was, she was no better a carpenter than any other of her sex.
  Evidently she had not told any of the men in the camp about the accident,
  probably because she did not wish to be questioned about its details.</p>

  <p>My hand on the doorknob of the next room, I hesitated. It seemed to me
  that I had heard movement on the other side of the panel, a faint scrape as
  of sheets rubbing together. Could the Dorsey boy be, coming out of his
  coma?</p>

  <p>A night-light floated in a bowl of oil, the dim luminance of its tiny
  flame filling the room.</p>

  <p>Something seemed to flit from the bed as I entered. It must have been the
  shadow of the night light, flickering with my disturbance of the air, though
  when I glanced at it, it burned again straight and unwavering.</p>

  <p>I realized the extent of Edith's perturbation when I found that the
  blanket had folded down from the youngster's chest and that his pajama coat
  had flapped open. It was the first time I had known her to be even by that
  much neglectful of her duties as a nurse. As I adjusted the covers I looked
  for a discoloration, but in that unsatisfactory illumination, there was none
  apparent.</p>

  <p>His pulse, well-nigh imperceptible, was no stronger than it had been on my
  previous examination. I stood looking down at him. He was a handsome child.
  Against the whiteness of the pillow his absolutely motionless head was like
  some bas-relief cameo of a sleeping Adonis, except for the down of
  adolescence fuzzing his pale, almost transparent cheeks.</p><br>

  <p class="first">I SIGHED, feeling old and useless. Here was this splendid
  lad drifting slowly into death, and with all my training, all my skill, there
  was nothing I could do to save him.</p>

  <p>I was strangely uneasy. I had a distinct sensation that there was someone
  else in the room, watching me, waiting for me to leave it. So strong it was
  that I turned abruptly to catch the intruder unaware. There was, of course,
  no one there.</p>

  <p>My nerves were certainly shot. I toyed with the idea of taking a bromide
  tablet from the tube in my kit, put the thought from me. What I needed was
  some food to fill my stomach, some tea to warm me. I went softly out.</p>

  <p>The tea was ready for me in the infirmary office, and the toast, as
  delicious as Edith had promised. I insisted on her having some, against her
  protest that she could not eat, and refused to talk till we were through.</p>

  <p>I wiped the crumbs from my lips with a piper napkin she had produced from
  somewhere, leaned back in my chair.</p>

  <p>"Now my dear," I said, "we can think clearly. I've taught you how to give
  a case history, noting only the essential facts but not omitting any of
  these. Suppose you apply that method to the events of this afternoon, giving
  them to me item by item as they happened, objectively, leaving out your
  reactions and your interpretations."</p>

  <p>"Yes, doctor," she replied meekly, her eyes on my face. "I'll do that.
  Item one." She checked it on a finger. "Jethro Parker screamed. I found him
  on his feet, acting as if he held something small and alive in his hands. I
  could see nothing there. He made a throwing motion and, item two, the window
  smashed."</p>

  <p>"Did you see the glass, at the moment it broke?"</p>

  <p>"No. I heard it. I was looking at Jethro."</p>

  <p>"Go on."</p>

  <p>"All right. Item three: I questioned Parker under the influence of the
  scopolamine. He said that he had been awakened by a weight on his chest, had
  felt something sucking there, had fought it, tearing it from his breast. He
  insisted that it was a little man. Item four: There was a red mark on his
  chest that faded very quickly. I&mdash;I think that is all."</p>

  <p>"No," I said quietly, "that is not all. You've forgotten to mention the
  fact that just before Jethro Parker's cries startled you, you were looking at
  swirls of ground vapor in the woods and seeing them as little men creeping up
  to attack you. And you've forgotten Shean Morphy's delirium last night, his
  ravings about the leprechauns that were all about."</p>

  <p>Edith looked puzzled. "But what has Shean's d.t.'s got to do with the
  case?"</p>

  <p>"Everything. The scientific method, my girl, demands an evaluation of the
  circumstances of an observation as well as of the observation itself. Of the
  observer. Note please, that you have been in a highly emotional condition for
  the last day or two, due to Hugh's mysterious disappearance. Note further,
  that rather distressing scene with Morphy could not but have upset you
  further, and that your illusions about the wraiths in the woods undoubtedly
  were suggested by his superstitious mouthings. You were beyond doubt
  conditioned to accept without proper evaluation any further outr suggestions
  that might be presented to you when the incident we are discussing occurred,
  initiated by the farmer's startling outcry.</p>

  <p>"But now let us examine what you saw and heard as you would ordinarily
  examine similar circumstances, rejecting any supernatural explanation as long
  as a realistic one can be offered. You have no objection?"</p>

  <p>"Objection! It's what I want most, a reasonable explanation."</p><br>

  <p class="first">THEN here it is. Parker's sleep, under the influence of the
  drug we have administered to him, must necessarily have been a light one, and
  therefore his subconscious more than ordinarily active. The weight of the
  blankets on his chest induced a nightmare, a real experience to his
  subconscious. Even when out of bed he was not actually awake but acting
  somnambulistically; It, was his subconscious self that replied to your
  questioning, and it honestly described to you circumstances which to it were
  real, but which were merely a dream-fantasy.</p>

  <p>"It was no fantasy that something broke the window."</p>

  <p>"No. But you did not see it break. This structure is not any too sturdily
  built. Parker is a heavy man and his jumping around must have shaken the
  house considerably. There was something on the sill, something you have
  forgotten about. It toppled over and went through the glass."</p>

  <p>"The red mark&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He told you he tore at his chest when he first awakened. He irritated his
  skin. And that's all there is to your terror. There's your realistic
  explanation of all that has so terrified you. A nightmare, a flimsy house
  shaking. There are no invisible little men to be afraid of, are there,
  my&mdash;dear?"</p>

  <p>"No. I suppose not. I suppose I have been a silly fool." She smiled
  wearily. "Thank you, Doctor Stone. I'm not afraid any more." She sighed,
  and then she said; "There's one thing more I wish you would explain. The mark
  on Charley's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The mark on Dorsey's skin may have been due to your rubbing it more
  vigorously than you realized, or&mdash;" I paused.</p>

  <p>"Or what?" the nurse asked softly.</p>

  <p>"Or it may be a hitherto unnoticed symptom of the disease that afflicts
  him." I fell into a brown study. "Let me see," I mused. "An intermittent
  flush, on the sinistral side of the dorsal integument&mdash;That is just
  about where I found Jenks capillaries hypertrophied&mdash;Can the infection
  be localized there? But the change in the blood structure&mdash;unheard
  of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Look, doctor." The girl leaned forward, her, eyes bright now, her cheeks
  flushed. "My knowledge of medicine is that of an infant's compared to yours,
  but I have an idea. You won't laugh at me if it's silly?"</p>

  <p>"No. I won't laugh at you."</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;then isn't it possible that that's just what the disease is, a
  progressive change in the blood structure? Isn't it possible that some people
  may have a greater resistance to it than others; that Hugh and the&mdash;the
  tramp&mdash;may both have had it without going into the coma?"</p>

  <p>My palm smacked-the desk top. "<i>You've got it</i>! By the great horn
  spoon, girl, you've got it. Lambert had the disease without knowing anything
  about it, and recovered with no ill effects except the alteration in his
  blood type. His splendid condition would account for that. The tramp had it,
  and also recovered, but was left with his mentality undermined and his
  physical appearance grotesquely changed. That means the malady is curable. If
  there is a natural resistance to it, we can induce it artificially. There's
  hope for the boy in there. There's hope for Gant!"</p>

  <p>"Hope for them! Wonderful! How&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There must be antibodies in the blood of these who have recovered from
  the infection, that injected into its victims will cure them. Why didn't I
  think of it before? By gad, Edith, this will make me famous! All we've got to
  do is find Hugh or the tramp, and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She voiced the thought that had halted my exuberance. "How? How are we to
  find Hugh? How are we to find the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The telephone rang, cutting across her voice.</p>

  <p>"Damn!" I blurted. "That must be for me. I left this number with Mrs.
  Small, but it's after midnight and&mdash;Hello!" I had the receiver to my
  ear.</p>

  <p>"All right," I answered the voice in the phone. "I'll be there in twenty
  minutes." I hung up, pushed to my feet.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Small, all right. She got a telegram this evening, didn't bother
  calling me about it. Just now Ann Doring phoned from the airport. She's just
  landed and she wants me to bring her up here."</p>

  <p>Edith jumped up.</p>

  <p>"<i>Ann!</i> Don't bring her here, Doctor! Don't let her come here. She's
  too glorious, too beautiful, for the little men to&mdash;to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And I thought I had found one female with as scientific mind!</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>Continuation of Hugh Lambert's Narrative:</em></p><br>

  <p class="first">"VANARK has reached the throne room." Leeahlee's quiet voice
  flowed into that underground chamber, reading aloud the Rata's thoughts on
  which she eaves-dropped. "He is not being permitted to enter as yet. A guard
  is telling Vanark that the Nal cannot be disturbed, that he is planning the
  reconstruction of the bridges, that he is ordering every Surahnit Tashna to
  the gulf to take part in the work. All other services are suspended, even
  the watching, if there are any Watchers left. Even the Listeners. Vanark's
  brain is a shriek of rage at the news that his beloved Listeners Post is
  being denuded of its workers. He&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah," Antil sighed. "I hoped for that." He was crossing to the screen.
  "Now if Seela has but obeyed his instructions."</p>

  <p>"Vanark is wild with impatience," the girl droned on. "Now he is calming.
  He is considering whether there might not be a way to destroy you here
  without betraying himself. He recalls the blast projector, mounted on a
  <i>lusan</i> for the attack on Calinore and waiting on the terminal stage. If
  only it has not been damaged, he thinks, he will use it on the Listeners
  Post, destroy the Post but destroy you, too. Taphetnit sabotage will be
  blamed. He, is hastening out."</p>

  <p>The screen was alive again. I glimpsed the destroyed trestle over the
  chasm, the abyss lips already crowded with Surahnit. Antil manipulated
  something and only a glowering murk was mirrored for me, the murk of Mernia's
  strange sky, directly overhead.</p>

  <p>Leeahlee's voice never hesitated. "Vanark is out in the streets. He is
  being buffeted by the crowds hastening to the outer boundaries of Tashna in
  obedience to Nal Surah's command. He is going counter to their stream and he
  is getting through only by the display of his <i>kitor</i>. His rage is
  mounting again. He is about to turn on its light, to melt a way for himself.
  No he dares not. Even his position as Rata will not save him from punishment
  for such wanton killing. He comes within view of the terminal stage and he
  sees the blast&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A white fleck appeared at the center of the imaged sky dome. Breath gusted
  from between Antil's lips.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;the blast projector. It is undamaged and Vanark is jubilant
  because of that and because there is no one on the terminal stage. The
  elevator must be working. His luck must hold. His luck...He thinks fleetingly
  of Nalinah. If he succeeds in destroying the Listeners Post he will not be
  able to produce against her the forged records purporting to show her
  seditious thoughts, her plotting with Hughlambert and the Taphetnit against
  the Folk Weal. No matter. The Nal..."</p>

  <p>There was not one but four white dots at the screen's center. Not dots.
  Winged mannikins! Plummeting&mdash;straight at me, it appeared, but I was
  looking upward&mdash;plummeting down like planes in a vertical power dive. So
  fast that only because I was exactly in a line with that stupendous drop
  could I see them. From any other angle they must seem only a white blurred
  line&mdash;if there were any in Tashna who looked in this direction at all.
  My veins tingled, watching that magnificent dive, and in the room from which
  I watched there was no sound but my breathing, the breathing of Fenton and
  Antil, and Leeahlee's monotone.</p>

  <p>"The Nal will release Nalinah from arrest, the case against her not
  proved, but he will be suspicious of her and her influence with him will be
  gone. That will leave only Vanark with his full confidence. Vanark will be
  the real ruler of Merniathis is better. This street has emptied. Around this
  corner is the elevator entrance. Dismay squeezes Vanark's brain. Rage flares
  into it. Wreckage lies across the lift door, blocking it."</p>

  <p>The Taphetnit were plain now, dropping. What a tremendous height it must
  be where they had hovered out of sight while their fellows destroyed the
  bridges, hovered invisible till the time for their thunderbolt descent, that
  still they were dropping!</p>

  <p>"Vanark tears at the wreckage but his strength cannot move it. Is there
  anyone to help? The street is deserted. No! Six youths, dashing into view,
  rushing, belated. Come here! Come here you!...The Nal's order? Cannot you see
  that I am a Rata and need your help? Clear that door. Clear it!'</p>

  <p>"The girders move. The door is clear. But they know Vanark will report
  this incident when the destruction of the Listeners Post is investigated. No
  they won't. They will report nothing, ever. The blast of the <i>kitor</i>
  caught them full, all of them at once. The door opens. The lift&mdash;is
  here&mdash;is working.&mdash;Antil! Vanark is shooting up to the blast
  projector. Hurry! <i>Hurry!</i>"</p>

  <p>"All right, Leeahlee." Swift stabs of Antil's hands had blanked the
  screen, had stopped the blue shimmer over the chambers walls and ceiling. And
  the ceiling. Down through it seethed four white-robed forms. The room was
  suddenly a shimmer of sparkling wings.</p>

  <p>"<i>Seela!</i>" Antil's greeting was a shout of joy. Then he was
  twittering, and in the quick flurry of his birdlike notes there was sharp
  command. "Take them all, brethren. Quickly!"</p>

  <p>"<i>Hurry</i>, Antil!" Leeahlee was tearing the phones from her head, her
  face a mask of terror. "Hurry!"</p>

  <p>A Taphet leaped at me, his countenance like a god's. I was in his arms and
  I was being lifted, feather-light.</p>

  <p>An instant of gray oblivion, an instant of gleaming metal; the cell where
  twice I had seen Leeahlee; then the swift rush of open air downward past me
  and the beat, beat of strong wings in my ears. All happened in a flash, so
  that not till then was I quite aware that I was being borne upward in the
  arms of a man-bird, that either side of us were Leeahlee and Fenton,
  similarly carried, and Antil in the arms of the one he had called Seela,
  clinging still to the <i>kitor</i>.</p>

  <p>We leaped upward as though catapulted from a spring. Lucky, I thought,
  that the roof of that cell had been opened, and then I thought, "But of
  course Antil cleared it to admit the Taphetnit. It was part of his plan."</p>

  <p>The honeycomb of the Listeners' Post dropped from beneath us. Beneath us
  spread the honeycomb that is Tashna.</p>

  <p>And then there was a blast beneath us, the ground spurting blue fire,
  spurting the shreds of the Listeners Post into the air. Two hundred yards
  above that holocaust we were, but the heat of it surged up to us, and it
  threw us in a single second to twice the height we had attained in ten.</p>

  <p>When the shreds had settled there was a crater in the floor of Tashna into
  which fifty <i>lusans</i> might have been driven, a pitted shellhole where
  the Listeners Post had been. But we for whom the blast had been intended were
  high, so high that the city was a child's toy there below us, and we were
  leveling in flight toward the horizon over which the frowning fortress wall
  of Calinore was already lifting.</p>

  <p>The last glimpse I had of Tashna and its people was of Vanark's mannikin
  figure on the <i>lusan</i> terminal stage. Beside some giant device whose
  outlines I could not discern, that tiny form jiggled in impotent rage.</p>

  <p>I would have given much to have had the listening disks of his
  thought-trapping contrivance clamped to my ears in that moment. As it was, I
  could only imagine his emotions, realizing that if only he had not melted to
  nothingness those six Surahnit lads, if only he had not set off the
  projector's futile blast, he would have brought us down, victims, to the
  lancing, scarlet rays of the L.S.G.'s <i>corets</i>.</p><br>

  <p class="first">A ride such as no human ever had before! Cradled in powerful
  but gentle arms, hearing the beat, beat, beat of the Taphet's wings, and then
  we were slanting down on a long line to wall-bound Calinore, and it was
  over.</p>

  <p>There is a white and shining temple in Calinore, where the glowing
  Taphetnit worship a god very like the God of abiding love a Man once preached
  in Galilee. In that temple there is an altar clothed by the flames of myriad
  candles* so that it shines like star-dust in the dim, cathedral quiet of that
  close.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* These altar lights are different from our candles in
  their chemistry, although like them in appearance. Notably, they do not
  consume oxygen in their burning, this life supporting gas being so limited in
  the cavern. H.L.]</p>

  <p>It was to this temple that Antil brought us, Leeahlee and Fenton and me,
  at once upon our landing. After he had knelt awhile, giving thanks for his
  delivery, I asked the youth about the candled altar.</p>

  <p>"It is the Shrine of Remembrance," he said. "When a Taphet dies we light a
  white candle therein token of our grief at his passing."</p>

  <p>"A <i>white</i> candle. What about those two green tapers, half burned
  down? What about those scores of green ones that are just being lit?"</p>

  <p>"Those," replied the youth, "those are for the two Surahnit we were
  compelled to kill in our attempt to capture Ra Nalinah as a hostage and for
  the others who died in our attack on Tashna."</p>

  <p>After, that I was not at all surprised to learn that there is no Law in
  Calinore, but that each of its people acts to his neighbors as he would wish
  them to act toward him. The doors of every dwelling here stand always open,
  shelter and food free to any one who chooses to enter. They must be careful
  of their resources as the Surahnit are, because they too are subject to the
  close economy of Mernia, but there is none but his own conscience to limit a
  Taphet's greed.</p>

  <p>These are the people whose destruction Nal Surah has proclaimed. These are
  the people who man their fortress walls even as I write, waiting for that
  destruction to come upon them. They man their Wall, but they have no weapons
  with which to defend it, for they are a people of peace.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-08"
     id="ch-08"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <p class="cp"><em>Hugh Lambert's narrative continued:</em><br></p>

  <p class="first">I COULD continue for page after page recounting the marvels
  of Calinore and the wonderful people who dwell here. But I must get on with
  my tale. The time I have to write&mdash;it grows very short, and Death may stay my
  hand.</p>

  <p>After his act of devotion in the temple, Antil took us to the mansion of
  shining white that was his home and Seela's. There at once we met in a
  council of war.</p>

  <p>I wanted to ask more about the troop of Dead-alive Antil had shown me on
  the screen, but there was no time. "Our scouts bring word that the Surahnit
  are repairing their bridges with incredible rapidity." Seela plunged at once
  to the heart of things. "Before this night is over they will be flocking
  across them to the attack."</p>

  <p>There was about this Taphet the same <i>shining</i> quality I had noted in
  his foster son, but it was somehow more mellow, somehow more fragile. "To
  cope with their <i>corets</i> and <i>kitors</i>," he continued, "we have no
  weapons. We have only the Wall of Calinore, and that will not stand long
  against their blast projector. I have carried out your schemes faithfully, my
  son, but I cannot see what has been accomplished by your adventure into
  Tashna and the raid that has put so many candles on the altar of
  remembrance."</p>

  <p>"Accomplished nothing?" Antil's eyes strayed for a fleeing moment to
  Leeahlee, and by the way hers clung to them, I knew that to those two a
  transcendent something had come out of his expedition. "You are wrong, Father
  Seela. I am well satisfied. I have brought from Tashna two things that may
  save us."</p>

  <p>"And what are those?"</p>

  <p>"Hula, first and most important. Something tells me that if we are to be
  victorious it will depend on him.</p>

  <p>"These two are both from the Upper World, father," Antil twittered. There
  was only that birdlike flutter to differentiate the language of the Taphetnit
  from that of the dark race of Tashna and I understood it quite as well. "The
  other one is similar to our cropped-winged brethren who have labored with the
  soil so long that their sluggish thoughts are of the earth, earthy. But I
  have read Hula's mind and it is like that of the Wise Ones of the Surahnit
  who have made it possible for them to hold our Taphetnit so long in subjection.
  You know that this had been our lack. Hula will remedy it. Also from Tashua I
  have brought that which will fill our next greatest need. A weapon, father. A
  <i>kitor</i>, the destroying sun-wand of the Ratanit."</p>

  <p>"<i>One kitor</i>, Antil? I saw you carrying it, but what will one
  <i>kitor</i> avail against the host that will shortly descend on us?"</p>

  <p>"Very little. But with one to examine, Lura, the scientist, poor in
  knowledge as he is, may be able to learn its secret and fashion others. We'll
  have a chance&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A whir at the open door interrupted him. A flash of white darted in
  through it. A white form hovered above the table, a diminutive Taphet. His
  small face, framed by blond curls and abeam, was the countenance of a della
  Robbia cherub carved from pure light; his naked little body a crystal Tanagra
  statuette. For an instant he poised there, suspended by a blur of wings
  vibrating so fast that they were invisible, then he darted to one side of
  Antil and alighted.</p>

  <p>"A message from Lura," he piped. "He has solved the secret of the
  <i>kitor</i>."</p>

  <p>Antil whirled to Seela, "You hear, father? Lura has solved the
  <i>kitor's</i> secret, thus quickly, thus easily." He was fairly shaking with
  youthful excitement. "We shall have a surprise for Nal Surah's hordes when
  they swarm upon us. Before they are aware of their fate we shall destroy them
  with the light of that sun we have never seen. We shall&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait, son," the Taphet, grave and unsmiling, cut him off. "The messenger
  has more to say."</p>

  <p>"He has? I know! Already Lura has found the way to make more of the orbs.
  Is that not it, youngster?"</p>

  <p>The boy was flushed with his temporary importance. "No. He said to tell
  you that you, are still possessed of only one <i>kitor</i>. He said to tell
  you there is not in all Mernia the elements needed to make another."</p>

  <p>The animation went out of Antil. He dropped onto the cushioned divan from
  which he had sprung, and groaned.</p>

  <p>"Any reply, Antil?" the boy demanded.</p>

  <p>"No," Seela told him. "No reply." The Surahnit's face was buried in his
  hands. "You have done well. You may go!"</p>

  <p>The cherub flashed out and away. "Only one <i>kitor</i>," Antil muttered,
  "against so many. And I was sure, so sure, there would be a way to multiply
  its beams&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wait!" I exclaimed, "To multiply its beams, you said, Antil! You said it
  was the light, the sunlight from the <i>kitor</i> that does the damage."</p>

  <p>He looked up at me, a tremor of hope on his face. "Yes. You have an idea,
  Hula? You..."</p>

  <p>"I think I have. It may work. It must work. Come on. Take me to Lura. It
  is something to try, at any rate."</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE past few hours have been ones of feverish, sweating
  labor. Speeding to Lura's laboratory I had explained my scheme to Antil and
  Seela and by the time we reached it the great domed room was already filled
  with a crowd of Taphetnit ready to do anything I asked them.</p>

  <p>All about me was the whir of the Taphetnits' <i>pintons</i>, the clangor
  of hammer on metal, the heat of forges. All about me was the twitter of the
  Winged Ones. Their only raw material is metal mined from somewhere in the
  cavern, remember, and so they are trained at least to its manipulation. But
  willing as they were, they were yet slow in coordinating themselves to
  fashioning anything but their traditional fabrications, and I had cause to
  bless Jeremiah Fenton's skill with tools. The farmer worked like a Trojan,
  not asking an unnecessary question.</p>

  <p>There had been no time for that. We were working against Time, against
  Death.</p>

  <p>I had cause, also, to bless Leeahlee for her quick-witted anticipation of
  my needs, her interpretation of them to the Taphetnit Antil and I could not
  reach with our voices. And then, at the end it was Leeahlee who found a way
  to polish the metal device we had made.</p>

  <p>All the time we worked, there came in to us a low mutter of fear from the
  city outside. Scouts were arriving at decreasing intervals, telling of the
  speed with which Tashna's chasm was being bridged, telling of the army that
  was being formed to come against us.</p>

  <p>Here is what we have done.</p>

  <p>The roof of the temple of which I have written rises in a conelike spire
  whose truncated apex forms a platform high above the other buildings of
  Calinore and even above the level of the Wall.</p>

  <p>At the center of this platform we have stepped a shaft to whose top we
  have fixed Nalinah's <i>kitor</i>.</p>

  <p>In a circle around this shaft we have laid a single-railed track on which
  runs a two-wheeled trolley. Mounted on gimbals on this trolley is a sheet of
  tural polished till it makes a perfect mirror, and bent to a paraboloid
  form.</p>

  <p>The <i>kitor's</i> sun orb is exactly at the focus of this parabola. There
  was a shield behind the ball to protect its user, and this I have
  removed.</p>

  <p>Yes, it is a searchlight we have fashioned, a sort of searchlight that
  will concentrate the white rays of the <i>kitor</i> and project them as a
  tight beam out over the Wall and to the plain surrounding Calinore. I can
  direct this beam to any point of that plain, within certain limits, and I can
  only hope that its lethal qualities will not be diminished by the
  distance.</p>

  <p>Fenton has been reading this account as fast as I write it. We two are
  alone up here. You see, we are the only ones who dare be so close to the
  <i>kitor</i> when it is turned on. The Taphetnit would melt like wax in its
  rays. We have erected a screen around the Wall, high enough to shadow from it
  the Winged Ones who crowd the rampart to defend it to the last if I fail. But
  anything they can do would be futile, if magnificent gesture, and so the
  destiny of Mernia rests in my hands, and in Fenton's, two Earth-dwellers
  descended to fight in a civil war whose principles were as real to us as
  those of our own Civil War.</p>

  <p>The destiny of Mernia and of the green, sunlit world that is not aware of
  Mernia's existence.</p>

  <p>I shall have to stop writing in a moment. Antil has signaled from down
  below that the Surahnit have crossed the chasm and that their <i>lusans</i>
  have reached the points on the roads where Seela has destroyed the paths.
  They are debarking.</p>

  <p>They are Marching through the <i>fortlik</i> fields. I can see them, a
  great green cloud coming over the horizon. They will shortly be within reach
  of my searchlight beam. I must check this thing I have built in the few
  minutes I have left, and so I must stop writing.</p>

  <p>Strange. I find that I am saying good-by in my mind to three women. Three,
  of all the women I have known.</p>

  <p>Ann Doring, of course. And, not surprisingly, Nalinah, though she is an
  enemy.</p>

  <p>I think it is the calm efficiency with which Leeahlee has helped me in
  these last feverish hours that has recalled the third girl to me.</p>

  <p>She is&mdash;of all people&mdash;Edith Horne!</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>Extract from the diary of Ann Doring, Sept. 1,
  1934:</em></p><br>

  <p class="first">HERE I am, back at Camp Wanooka, but how different
  everything is! Instead of the happy chatter of a half-hundred boisterous
  youngsters, a brooding quiet overlies it, an empty hush that seems
  underscored with fear.</p>

  <p>Everyone seems to be trying to put a smiling face on an uneasy situation.
  Doctor Stone smiled, last night, when he tried to persuade me to go to a
  hotel in Albany, or to his home there, instead of to the camp. He kept
  smiling even when I blazed up at him, telling him that I was certain he was
  hiding from me the fact that Dickie was sick, and threatened to go to the
  authorities if he refused to take me to my brother. There is some advantage
  in being an actress; I am certain that he does not suspect the real reason
  for my hurried flight across the continent.</p>

  <p>Edith Horne smiled when she met us at the gate. Like the doctor; she
  smiled with her lips, not with her eyes. She took me to her own infirmary,
  insisting that I must sleep with her instead of in the guest house. She
  wasn't fooled by my pretended anxiety over Dick. It was of Hugh Lambert we
  talked, lying beside each other in the dark.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Editor's Note: Miss Doring here retells what little Miss
  Horne knew of the circumstances of Lambert's disappearance, a story already
  herein set forth and therefore omitted. The nurse did not of course reveal
  the real nature of Jethro Parker's illness nor did she say anything of the
  strange and disturbing events of the previous twenty-four hours.]</p>

  <p>When Edith had finished, I peculiarly enough shared with her her
  inexplicable certainty that Hugh is alive somewhere, and that somehow he will
  fight his way back to us. I shared something else with her, the knowledge
  that we are both desperately in love with him, although we neither of us had
  put that into words.</p>

  <p>She is quite too grand a person for there to be any jealousy between us.
  On the contrary we were drawn together by our common distress, so that when
  sleep finally came to us, toward dawn, it found us the best of friends.</p>

  <p>I am writing this in her room. Edith is tending to her patients and after
  she is through we shall go down to the mess hall for breakfast. The sun is
  streaming in through the window, and there is a bird on the sill, a brave
  little fellow with gray head, gray wings and yellow, black striped breast.
  His little throat swells as he peers impertinently in at me with his bright
  little black eyes, and he is telling me to "Cheerup, cheerup, cheerup." But I
  can't. I can't throw off the feeling that something dreadful has happened,
  something that I shall learn about when, with Edith, I go down the path
  between the empty bungalows.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">I WAS right. Dick did not wake up this morning. They brought
  him to the infirmary a few minutes ago. I have just been looking at him. He
  seems only to be asleep, but he didn't answer when I called his name. His
  slow, even breathing didn't even quiver.</p>

  <p>Can it be that the lie I told Doctor Stone last night has brought this on
  my little brother?</p>

  <p>Silly to think so, I know, but...</p>

  <p>Edith tells me there is only one way Dick can be saved. If Hugh returns in
  time. <i>If Hugh returns</i>!</p>

  <p>Please, God, bring Hugh back.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>Appendix to Hugh Lambert's Narrative, written by Jeremiah
  Fenton:</em></p><br>

  <p class="first">THE last words Mr. Lambert said to me was, "Fenton! You keep
  on writing what's going on here, as long as you last. Maybe sometime,
  somehow, these papers will get to our people, and I'd like them to know how
  we fought for them, down here in this strange place." Then he took my hand
  and we said good-by.</p>

  <p>Well, I'll try my best, though I know I'll make an awful bum job of
  it.</p>

  <p>There we was, up on top of that church. I was feeling terrible after
  reading what Mr. Lambert had written, because now I knew how close my brother
  Elijah had been to me that night when the chess piece was moved, and what had
  become of him, of his body. It was like hearing that he had died over again,
  only it was worse.</p>

  <p>I can't explain things like that in the grand way Mr. Lambert can, but I
  can feel them. Look. Even the lowest-down savages take care of the corpses of
  them they have loved. There's something in us that makes us feel a little
  better, no matter how deep our sorrow, to know where the bodies of those who
  have been near and dear to us are; to know that for a little time longer, at
  any rate, that much of them still exists. The nations recognized this need of
  ours after the World War, that's why each one has its grave of an Unknown
  Soldier so that everyone who lost someone in battle can feel that maybe,
  maybe, it is him that lies in that honored grave.</p>

  <p>Well, I couldn't have that feeling. I knew now that Elijah's body didn't
  exist at all, anywhere. That it was gone, like no body was ever gone before.
  That this other part of me didn't exist any more, that it wasn't even dust,
  not even slime at the bottom of the Lake...</p>

  <p>But that ain't telling my story. Like I said, there we was up top of the
  church, watching that green army coming toward Calinore. Mr. Lambert had
  tried out how far the light from the dingus he'd rigged up would reach,
  slanting it down so it just missed the top of the curtains we'd put up around
  the wall to keep it from hitting the Winged People we were trying to help.
  There was a kind of wave in the ground where the end of the beam would first
  hit, and there was another one further back beyond which it would go off into
  the air. It was only between those two folds that it would be any good, and
  we had to wait till the army reached it.</p>

  <p>That waiting was the hardest thing I ever did.</p>

  <p>They kept coming, maybe a couple of thousands of them. They came very
  slow, and either they didn't make any noise or they was too far off for us to
  hear them. But we could see them, spread out along the field, marching
  forward; slow and very sure.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THERE was something terrible about the sureness of them, and
  about the quiet. There wasn't any sound out there, and there wasn't any sound
  below us, in the City. The Taphetnit were hidden from us by the curtains on
  the wall, and they might not have been there for all the noise they made. The
  women and children were huddled inside the houses, so that when we looked
  down into Calinore we saw only empty streets with nothing and nobody at all
  moving. We were two humans all alone up there in the sky, watching that
  silent army coming, coming; slow as death and sure as death; and knowing that
  the fate of a race, that the fate of the world, depended on us alone.</p>

  <p>I was standing by the pole to which we had fastened the thing they call a
  <i>kitor</i>, and my hand was on the kind of ring on its handle that we'd
  found out you moved a little to make the ball at its top shine. Mr. Lambert
  was back of me, at the reflector, ready to aim it.</p>

  <p>The Surahnit came nearer and nearer. I started shaking with the buck ague.
  I wanted to yell something, anything to smash that awful silence.</p>

  <p>"Steady," I heard Mr. Lambert's voice, quiet like. "Steady, Fenton. Calm
  and easy does it."</p>

  <p>"Don't you worry about me," I said back, watching those green ranks come
  on. "I'm all right." I was, when I said it. It was like as if I had got some
  of his strength from his voice, some of the kind of strength that had made it
  possible for him to sit there and write page after page, when all the time he
  knew he might be dead before he could finish writing.</p>

  <p>It can't be that he is dead now. It can't be that no one will ever again
  see the brown skin crinkle at the corners of his eyes and be warmed by his
  friendly grin.</p>

  <p>The soldiers from Tashna kept coming on, coming on. Now I could make out
  two little figures out in front of them who were not in uniform, and behind
  those two leaders there were the others, rank after rank of them spread
  across the field and getting nearer and nearer.</p>

  <p>I could hear the <i>thud, thud</i> of their marching feet now. Far away
  yet, but each thud a little bit louder than the one before. It put me in mind
  of the song we used to sing on Decoration Day:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath
  are stored.<br>
  He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword...</p><br>

  <p>Only this wasn't His host that trampled the grapes of wrath but the legion
  of His enemy, and the fateful lightning that would soon be loosed wasn't the
  thunderbolts of His anger but the terrible red darts of Antichrist's
  <i>corets</i>.</p>

  <p>The two leaders went down into the hollow of a ground wave, and were
  hidden by the ridge that was our marker for where our light could first reach
  them. The front line of the soldiers from Tashna went down into that hollow,
  and the next, and the next, till we couldn't see any of the Surahnit any
  more.</p>

  <p>For a minute it was an almighty peaceful scene I was looking at, but my
  hand was <i>tight</i> on the <i>kitor</i> ring and my palm was sweating.</p>

  <p>"They'll get a surprise," Mr. Lambert said, "when they come up over the
  next crest. Get set, Fenton, but don't switch on the light till I say so."
  Then the line of rock&mdash;dark and shining-like, as if some black light was
  inside of it&mdash;was broken by two moving knobs. Two heads came up over the
  ridge, and then two bodies. I could see them plain.</p>

  <p>One of the Surahnit Mr. Lambert and Antil had called Vanark. The other one
  was a Surahnit girl.</p>

  <p>They came down the slope, right into the range of our searchlight of
  death. The first rank of the soldiers came over the crest behind them like
  the ground wave was breaking into a spume of green foam, but Mr. Lambert
  didn't say, "Turn it on."</p>

  <p>He groaned instead, groaned a name. The name was "Nalinah."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">VANARK turned around. The sound of his voice came clear
  across the rolling, dark field, though I could not make out what he said. I
  knew though, at once, that it was an order because the arms of all the
  soldiers moved like they was on a single string and their hands came up with
  the little rods of <i>corets</i> in them. I knew that they were coming within
  range of Calinore's Wall and that in another second the red rays would lash
  out to sweep the parapet clean of its defenders.</p>

  <p>"Turn it on," Mr. Lambert said hoarsely. "Turn the <i>kitor</i> on."</p>

  <p>My hand twisted the ring, and all of a sudden I could see nothing because
  of the blaze that blinded me and the heat that burned me. I closed my eyes,
  as we had planned, and dropped to the platform and crawled toward where I
  knew the reflector was.</p>

  <p>My groping hand found the track we'd made for the reflector to move on. I
  pulled myself over it, got up to my knees, to my feet. The light didn't shine
  so strong through my lids any more and I opened them.</p>

  <p>I was behind the reflector, like I'd figured; and I was alongside Mr.
  Lambert. His two hands were on the handles we'd fixed to the back of the
  metal that was like the top of an umbrella laying edgewise and he moving
  it.</p>

  <p>I looked past the edge of the thing. My eye followed the blazing white
  beam it sent out over Calinore and over the Wall, and over the plain.</p>

  <p>The beam slanted down over the Wall and across the plain. Its end moved
  slowly along the line of Surahnit soldiers. It was like a great white finger
  stroking a design of green chalk someone had drawn on the wavy rock out
  there, stroking the design and rubbing it out. For where the finger had
  passed there was no longer any military rank, there was no longer anything
  living. There was only a splash of wet yellow on the rock, some of which
  started dribbling in thick streamers down the slope.</p>

  <p>A quarter of the left side of the line was already gone when I looked, and
  that dreadful finger of light was moving steadily to the right, but the
  soldiers of Tashna who remained were still coming on, marching as if nothing
  was happening, and from their <i>corets'</i> scarlet rays were streaking to
  the Wall of Calinore.</p>

  <p>Screams from the Wall, screams of agony, killed the silence. Little bursts
  of flame spurted above the curtain that hid the Taphetnit there, and plumes
  of black, greasy smoke waved above the Wall. But the scythe of blazing death
  steadily mowed the Surahnit rank. Half of it was gone, and more than half;
  and in the next second the beam was going to hit Vanark and Nalinah. I
  remembered what Mr. Lambert had written about Nalinah and I felt cold fingers
  close on my throat.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE white light-finger jumped upward! It went over the head
  of those two and flashed downward to melt away the last of that oncoming rank
  of Surahnit. "I couldn't do it," Mr. Lambert groaned. "Heaven help me, I
  couldn't do it."</p>

  <p>A second later the two Ratanit stood stock-still, because the blazing disk
  that was the tip of our death-beam lay on the ground right in front of them,
  and if they took another step they would walk into it. Then it started to
  creep toward them, slow as a cat creeping up on a bird. They stared at it for
  two beats of my heart. Then their nerve broke and they turned and ran back
  over the ridge.</p>

  <p>There were no more Surahnit to be seen on the plain. There was only that
  dreadful yellow wetness. For a minute I was sick, looking at that, ands then
  there was a great burst of twittering from the Wall, like cheers, and I was
  banging Mr. Lambert on the back.</p>

  <p>"We got them licked," I was yelling; "We've&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A cry from behind whirled me around to the Wall on the eastern side of
  Calinore, so I didn't hear the rest of what Mr. Lambert said. I saw that a
  Taphet was pulling open the curtain there and was yelling to us, waving his
  arm excited-like.</p>

  <p>I looked over the curtain and out on the plain on that side to see what he
  was so excited about, and then I grabbed Mr. Lambert's arm. "Look!" I
  yelled. "Look there. They ain't licked yet. They're sneaking up and trying
  something else."</p>

  <p>I pointed to the thing I had seen. It was coming over the top of a ridge
  like the one on the other side and just about as faraway. It was a great big
  thing of shining metal, with a barrel sticking out of it so that it was as
  much like a big cannon as the <i>corets</i> were like pistols. There were
  about a dozen Surahnit pulling at it. Then it was on the gentle downward
  slope of the rock-wave, and the dozen soldiers were shoving back against it,
  braking it.</p>

  <p>"That's a blast projector," Mr. Lambert exclaimed, "like the one with
  which Vanark wrecked the Listeners Post." He started pushing at the trolley
  on which the reflector was mounted, was wheeling it around behind the other
  side of the <i>kitor</i>. "They must have brought it up on a <i>lusan</i>
  from the Gateway. They've got an idea they can beat us with that, but we'll
  take care of them right now. Help me here, Fenton."</p>

  <p>The Surahnit got the projector stopped, swarmed over it, working to slow
  it around in position to fire at the Wall. We had our reflector set first.
  Mr. Lambert grabbed the handles, slashed the beam across the ground out
  there. The light hit the green-uniformed men and blazed all about them.</p>

  <p>Nothing happened.</p>

  <p>They didn't melt. They didn't even stop working with the thing. They
  didn't pay any more attention to the blaze that had whiffed other beings just
  like them into a few drops of yellow liquid than I would have done if someone
  was flashing sunlight on me with a mirror!</p>

  <p>Mr. Lambert made a kind of funny sound in his throat.</p>

  <p>"What's happened?" I asked him. "Why don't it work any more?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he said low-toned. "I haven't the least idea. I don't, see
  how they could have figured out a way to combat its effect so quickly. And
  why are there only a few of them out there? Why, if they're no longer afraid
  of the light, aren't they coming over in force?"</p>

  <p>"They are!" I popped back. "On this side." I'd looked back, and I'd seen
  the green wave coming over the first ridge again. "But that guy Vanark ain't
  leading them. I wonder&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He isn't?" Mr. Lambert exclaimed. "Maybe&mdash;" He was wheeling the
  reflector around once more. "Maybe..."</p>

  <p>They were firing off their <i>corets</i> again when the white flash hit
  them. Then they weren't firing any longer. They weren't there!</p>

  <p>"Something screwy," Mr. Lambert grunted. "These fellows aren't immune to
  it but the others are. Just the few of them. Watch them, Fenton, while I keep
  the main force back. Watch them and tell me what they're up to."</p><br>

  <p class="first">I DIDN'T have to tell him. A crash told him, the crash of
  the Wall falling in. A blue flame had flared across the plain from the blast
  projector. It had hit the great rampart, and the looming rock had exploded
  upward.</p>

  <p>A great cloud of dust rose to the sky from where a gaping and terrible
  hole was torn in the Wall. Out of that cloud rained black stones, and white
  pieces of cloth, bits of flesh, and feathers, a many-colored snowfall of
  feathers.</p>

  <p>"They've blown up the Wall, Mr. Lambert," I gasped when I could talk
  again. "They've killed Lord knows how many Taphetnit."</p>

  <p>"Keep watching, Fenton," he answered, cool and steady. "Keep telling me
  what, they do. I don't dare turn around. Vanark is sending another wave of
  his L.S.G., over the ridge. They're going to get us, but I'll do for as many
  of them as I can before that happens."</p>

  <p>"They're working with the blast projector. They&mdash;I think they're
  trying to swing it up so as to hit this tower. Now they've stopped. They
  couldn't do it. I guess it isn't made so as it can shoot up. They're lowering
  it again."</p>

  <p>"Lord, Fenton," Mr. Lambert exclaimed, "those boys have guts. They keep
  coming over the ridge, keep trying to get across the zone I can reach with
  the beam. None of them has got past yet. That whole belt is running
  ankle-deep in the liquid I'm melting them down into. But still they
  come."</p>

  <p>"The ones on this side just fired another blast." I went back to him. "It
  smashed a row of houses to smithereens. I wonder why they did that instead of
  blowing up some more of the Wall."</p>

  <p>"Because it isn't the Taphetnit on the Wall that's bothering them. It's
  us, up here. Don't you get it, Fenton? They're clearing a way for their
  blasts to reach this temple, and then they'll blow it out from under us.
  Smart people, the Surahnit."</p>

  <p>"We're done for, then&mdash;Lord! There goes another row of houses!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Fenton, they've beaten us, but they know they've been in a fight. If
  we have to go out, this is the best way to do it. Scrapping!"</p>

  <p>"What about what they're going to do to the Upper World, Mr. Lambert? What
  about them dead humans in the Gateway Wall they're ready to send up where our
  people are, and the rest of them that's going to follow?"</p>

  <p>"Don't think of it, Fenton. Don't dare to think of what it's going to mean
  to the human race when that blast projector blows this temple out from under
  us. Just fight. Just keep on fighting. We've done our best, and humanity is
  licked."</p>

  <p>He sounded almost happy. He was flashing that terrible white sword of his
  up and down the field out there, melting the Surahnit soldiers down to a
  trickle of yellow liquid. I was watching the terrible blue flame of the blast
  projector smash nearer and nearer to us; and he sounded like he was having
  the time of his life.</p>

  <p>Then he started singing.</p>

  <p class="verse">The sons of the prophet are hardy and bold!</p>

  <p class="first">And his deep-chested baritone sounded above the screams of
  terrified Taphetnit and the thunder of exploded stones.</p>

  <p class="verse">And quite unaccustomed to fear.</p>

  <p>He was singing while he fought, while he wiped out score after score of
  the helpless Surahnit with his blazing shaft of death.</p>

  <p class="verse">But of all the most reckless of life or of limb...</p>

  <p>While another blinding flash burst from the projector and another slice of
  houses went smashing down to ruin.</p>

  <p class="verse">...was Abdul the Bulbul Ameer.</p>

  <p>"Oh, oh, one of them got through, Fenton! One of them's past where I can't
  catch him. He's <i>coreting</i> the Wall and I can't do anything about
  it."</p>

  <p>I whipped around, shaking from the terror I was watching. I saw a
  green-uniformed young fellow, maybe he was about eighteen, running toward the
  wall, red flashes spitting from his outstretched hand, spitting at the Wall.
  And then I saw a flash of shining feathers dart up from the Wall, and out
  over the plain, three Taphetnit flying fast as flushed partridges. I saw one
  go down in a blaze, a second.</p>

  <p>But the third one swooped down on the soldier, knocked the <i>coret</i>
  from his hand, and now he was flying up in the air again, carrying the
  boy.</p>

  <p>HE WENT up a hundred feet, two hundred and then he dropped the screaming
  youth. I saw green-clad arms and legs jerking frantically in mid-air. I saw
  the youngster hit the rock, and I heard a squelching sound, as if a rotten
  pumpkin had smashed out there.</p>

  <p>Behind me there was a crash! The blast projector had fired again. Mr.
  Lambert never turned a hair. He was bent over the reflector, and he was
  working it very steady. His jaw was sticking out, square and hard, but his
  hair was streaming back from his high brow, and his eyes were shining.</p>

  <p>He was singing.</p>

  <p class="verse">There are heroes in plenty and well known to fame<br>
  In the ranks that are led by the Czar...</p>

  <p>Another crash behind me was like a peal of thunder, and the tower rocked
  under my feet, like this was the time it was going to come down. I spun
  around. Half the City lay in ruins, from where a great pile of rubble showed
  where the Wall had been to a hundred yards away from the base of the
  temple.</p>

  <p>"They're close, Mr. Lambert. Another two shots and they'll have us."</p>

  <p class="verse">But among the most reckless of fame or of name<br>
  Was Ivan Skovinsky Skivar.</p>

  <p>That was all the answer I got. What Mr. Lambert sounded like was a man who
  had worried a long time, trying to find a way to stave off something
  terrible, and now it had happened and it was no use to worry, any more about
  nothing.</p>

  <p class="verse">He could swing the trapeze, play euchre or pool<br>
  And perform on the Spanish guitar...</p>

  <p>"They're not coming any more, Fenton. Either I've got them all or they've
  given up hope. Here, help me slew this thing around. I'll try another shot at
  those artillerymen."</p>

  <p>I jumped to help him. He went on with his song as we pushed at some
  contraption and the tower rocked with the detonation of another blast.</p>

  <p class="verse">In fact quite the cream of the Muscovite team<br>
  Was Ivan Skovinshy Skivar...</p>

  <p>Just as we got the reflector around there was a tremendous swoosh of
  wings, and a crowd of the Taphetnit sailed straight up from the City. They
  went higher and higher.</p>

  <p>"The yellow curs," I growled. "They know we're licked and they're running
  away."</p>

  <p>"Never mind them, my frolicsome farmer." The light-beam was shooting out
  to that blast projector again, was playing on it, with no more result than
  before. "What I want to know is what magic those damned Surahnit have worked,
  to make those few sunuvaguns immune to sunlight. And why only that handful is
  immune."</p>

  <p>Another bolt of blue lightning flashed from the projector. The street just
  below us blew up. The air was dark with dust, with falling stones.</p>

  <p>"There's another one of them," I said, "just coming over the ridge. It's
  that guy Vanark." I could see him through the veil of dust, standing
  straddle-legged on that ridge. "He's laughing at us."</p>

  <p>"Yeah, he's laughing at us, but he's not coming down to where I can reach
  him. He isn't immune. He's just gone around there to watch the next blast,
  the one that will finish us. So long, Fenton, it's all over. You better climb
  down with those papers and hide somewhere. Vanark seems to have some use for
  you; maybe he won't kill you." He held out his hand.</p>

  <p>But I didn't shake it. A stone had come down out of the sky, plunk on one
  of the Surahnit out there. He went down, and another rock dropped, hit
  another soldier. They were coming down fast now, those stones, raining out of
  the sky, too fast for the cannon to be shot again.</p>

  <p>"Look!" Mr. Lambert yelled.</p>

  <p>He was pointing up into the sky. I looked where he pointed. Far, far, up
  against the muddy dome that was Mernia's sky, there was a little flash of
  white and the hail of rocks was streaming down from that.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;what&mdash;" I gasped.</p>

  <p>"The Taphetnit, Fenton! The ones we called yellow. They've carried pieces
  of their ruined city up there and they're raining them down on the Surahnit
  we couldn't kill. They've saved the battle. They've saved us!"</p>

  <p>I looked back to the projector. There wasn't any living being moving
  around it. It was covered by a pile of stones, and the pile was spreading out
  around it. I saw one green-sleeved arm twitch, and then that too was
  buried.</p>

  <p>The white started drifting down. It was a fleecy cloud, and then it was a
  covey of Taphetnit, slanting fast toward the City. One great white figure
  flashed down ahead of the main body and I saw that it was Seeta. If ever I
  see one of God's Angels I know he will look just like that Taphet looked to
  me just then.</p>

  <p>Mr. Lambert turned off the <i>kitor</i> light. I turned to him, and he
  didn't look as happy as I thought he should.</p>

  <p>"They didn't get Vanark," he said. "The Rata ducked back over the ridge
  when the first stone fell, and got away." His hands closed slowly at his
  sides, into knuckled fists. "As long as that fellow's alive, we can still
  expect trouble."</p>

  <p>He was right, but he didn't know how right he was.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-09"
     id="ch-09"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <p class="cp"><em>Account of Courtney Stone, M.D., continued:</em></p>

  <p class="first">THERE was nothing I could do for Dick Loring. How could
  there be, when I had been able to do nothing for Charles Dorsey, or for the
  two farmers in the hospital,. one of whose bodies I had dissected the day
  before?</p>

  <p>I knew now that there was only one hope of saving the boys and Job Gant.
  There was only one hope of stopping the slow spread of the mysterious disease
  from which they suffered. If I could find someone who had resisted the
  inroads of the disease, and make from his blood an antitoxic serum, I might
  be able to work out a successful treatment.</p>

  <p>It would be entirely useless to start a search for the tramp. He must be
  miles away from Albany by now. Almost as futile to hope for Hugh Lambert's
  return. This was September first. He had been gone three days now, and there
  was no justification for Edith Horne's sturdy faith that he was still alive,
  that he would still return.</p>

  <p>But I could not sit idly by and watch my patients die. I must try
  something. A possibility occurred to me, a million to one chance of my
  finding what I so desperately needed.</p>

  <p>I had already decided that the focus of infection was in this Helderberg
  region. I knew of two cases of recovery from it, who were not aware even that
  they had been affected. There might be others. There might be one among the
  patients in the hospital, particularly in the surgical wards, or among the
  members of the staff.</p>

  <p>If I ordered the blood of everyone in the institution typed, one among the
  two hundred might show up with the peculiar qualities of Lambert's and the
  tramp's. That was all I needed, just one.</p>

  <p>Nurse Horne was like a quietly burning white flame moving about the
  infirmary. I called her out from Parker's room, and I told her my idea. I was
  no longer sure of myself, you see. I was no longer sure of anything.</p>

  <p>There was something abnormal about the atmosphere of the camp, and I was
  abnormal as long as I was in it.</p>

  <p>Edith smiled wanly when I got through talking.</p>

  <p>"You can try it," she said. "It can't do any harm, and it will be
  something to do."</p>

  <p>It was something to do. I went out to my car and I drove down to, Albany.
  They were waiting for me at the hospital. They knew how interested I was in
  the syndrome and they were waiting to tell me that three more patients
  suffering from it had been brought in during the night.</p>

  <p>One was a woman, Hepzibah Foster, wife of the owner of a general store at
  Four Corners, on the highway that used to be called Waley Road. The other two
  were little children; a boy of four and a girl of five. I knew Jimmie Crane.
  Doctor Deutsch, our pediatrician, had presented him at a clinic as an
  outstanding example of what a course of treatment with vitamins could
  accomplish in curing rickets. He should have presented tiny Frances Hall as a
  control specimen. She was pigeon-breasted, bow-legged, emaciated. She came
  from the same sort of land-poor farmer family as Jimmie, but she had not had
  the benefit of modern scientific care.</p>

  <p>It didn't make any difference now.</p>

  <p>They were both deep in the coma of which I had seen too much in the past
  month, the sturdy, straight-boned lad and the twisted, pinch-faced little
  lass alike.</p>

  <p>Unless I could find, somewhere in the hospital, an individual the serum of
  whose blood would agglutinate the corpuscles of Type IV and whose corpuscles
  would agglutinate the serum of no known type, those two infants were
  doomed.</p>

  <p>The technicians looked askance at me when I gave the orders for a general
  typing, but they did, not question me.</p>

  <p>Perhaps there was something in my face that forbade any
  questioning.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>Jeremiah Fenton's story, resumed:</em></p>

  <p class="first">SEELA was still about fifty yards above us. He stopped,
  sudden-like, hanging on his wings like a hawk would. He pointed off to the
  west and his head went back like, he was hollering to the other Taphetnit
  above him. Four of them swooped off in that direction, and slid down, behind
  the ridge. Then Seela came on down to us.</p>

  <p>"We have much to thank you two for," he said, low-toned, "but so many,
  many Mernians, have gone from among us. I shall declare a <i>fusran</i> [holy
  day] at once, so that all that are left in Calinore may, light white tapers
  and green upon the altar below."</p>

  <p>"They're gone then, Seela?" Mr. Lambert asked. "The Surahnit?"</p>

  <p>"A pitiful, remnant are retreating. Curiously enough, they go not towards
  Tashna but are making a great circle which will take them to the Gateway
  Wall. All but one, after whom I have sent my brethren."</p>

  <p>"A wounded one? I didn't think any whom the light touched escaped
  alive."</p>

  <p>"Not wounded, Hula. She was coming toward Calinore, staggering and weary,
  but whole."</p>

  <p>"She! Who?"</p>

  <p>"The Ra Nalinah, she whom Antil wished to take as hostage. She is our
  prisoner now, but after what has happened this night I have no illusion that
  she will avail us aught as a hostage. Our only protection is this that you
  have devised"&mdash;he laid a hand on the reflector&mdash;"and I misgive me
  that the Nal Surah and the Surahnit scientists may not yet find a way to
  shield themselves from it."</p>

  <p>"They did just that," I put in. "Those guys that were working the blast
  projector didn't feel it any more than I would have."</p>

  <p>Seela started to say something but Mr. Lambert butted in.</p>

  <p>"What are they doing with her? Where are they going to take her?"</p>

  <p>The Taphet smiled, kind of sad.</p>

  <p>"To my dwelling. I wish to question her and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What are we waiting for?" We'd passed through a lot together but I never
  saw Mr. Lambert get so excited. "Let's go."</p>

  <p>That Seela sure is strong. He scooped me up under one arm and Mr. Lambert
  under the other and he took off from that platform like he wasn't carrying no
  weight at all.</p>

  <p>I wasn't scared this time. I went up in an airplane once, at the County
  Fair, and I was so tarnation frightened I swore I would never go up in one
  again. Flying with Seela was different.</p>

  <p>I just looked down at that city below. Half of it was as beautiful as
  before, all shining white houses and big open circles where you could see
  grooves worn where the Taphetnit used to dance, and the other half of it was
  a terrible jumble of broken stones smeared with glistening red.</p>

  <p>I wasn't scared, but I was awful sick, thinking of what that red was.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">THERE wasn't anyone in Seela's house when we got there
  except Leeahlee. She'd fixed up some kind of food and she made us eat it. It
  was kind of like corn mush except that it was orange color, and tasted a lot
  better, and we drunk wine with it that was better than Martha Parker's
  dandelion wine that she always sent around to Elijah and me in the fall.</p>

  <p>Seela and I ate pretty hearty; but the two others kept looking out through
  the door. When we was about half through Antil came in. He was all ruffled
  up, and there was an angry weal across his cheek where it had got burned by a
  <i>coret</i> flash.</p>

  <p>Leeahlee run to him; and she touched the mark on his cheek, and there was
  tears in her eyes. It wasn't much to make her take on so, but I guess women
  are the same all over the world and underneath it when the man they love gets
  hurt. In the middle of that fuss, Mr. Lambert jumps up all of a sudden, his
  face lighting up.</p>

  <p>I turned around to see who it was he was so glad was coming. There was two
  Taphetnit in the door-way, and between them was Nalinah, all sagged out.</p>

  <p>Her dress was half torn from one shoulder, and her hair was all mussed up,
  but her little face was kind of smiling and peaceful, for all its being
  deathly tired. It put me in mind of someone that's been lost in the woods,
  and worried stiff, and now was on a path he knew would lead him home.</p>

  <p>She kind of pulled away from the Taphetnit that were holding her and took
  a step into the house, and I knew she only saw Mr. Lambert. He came past me,
  taking big strides, and he took the hands she held out to him, and they stood
  there like that, looking into each other's eyes for a long minute. They made
  a grand looking couple, he tall and, brown and strong; she little and frail
  and beautiful.</p>

  <p>She kind of sighed, and then she said, "I had to come, Hula. I had to come
  to you."</p>

  <p>"I know," he answered.</p>

  <p>After a while he said, "Tell me about it, Nalinah." I can hear everything
  they said right now, in my ears, so can put it down just the way they said
  it.</p>

  <p>"Vanark had reported to the Nal," Nalinah began, "that you had swayed me
  against the Folk Weal, and that I was plotting with you to defeat the
  invasion of the Upper World. That was why my arrest was ordered. Vanark lied,
  Hula, but waiting the long road for a chance to defend myself, I thought over
  all we had spoken together and Vanark's lie became the truth. I saw that you
  were right and the Taphetnit were right, and that the weal of our Folk lies
  here in Mernia, just as the weal of yours lies among the green fields and the
  blue seas above."</p>

  <p>"Yes, Nalinah," he murmured. "We each have our own sphere to which we are
  born and to which we are fitted."</p><br>

  <p class="first">VANARK accused me before the Nal, while the bridges were
  being rebuilt, of being a traitor to the Folk. I denied that, for no traitor
  to them I am but more loyal than he who has lied and deceived the Ratanit and
  Nal Surah and is plotting to seize the Nalship for himself when once the
  invasion he has planned and urged shall be successful. I swore to my denial
  by the sun-shaft that rises from the Central Plaza of Tashna and the shaft
  turned white in token that I swore truly.</p>

  <p>"You convinced the Nal and by some trick he turned the shaft white.'</p>

  <p>"Nay, Hula, the shaft is the heart and the brain of the Folk, and the
  shaft turned white. Therefore was the Nal convinced that I am no traitor, and
  I too was convinced that for their true happiness the Folk must remain in
  Mernia. But Vanark is very shrewd. He proposed that I lead with him the
  attack on Calinore, and I could not refuse. Could I, Hula?</p>

  <p>"No, Nalinah."</p>

  <p>"So I led the attack beside Vanark, and though my heart bled for the
  gallant Surahnit as they died in your ray, yet was I also glad that Vanark
  and his host were being defeated, for that defeat, I thought, meant that the
  Folk would remain forever in Mernia, and too, I was so proud of you that you
  had found a way to defeat us.</p>

  <p>"But Vanark, leaving orders for the attack to continue, took me far to one
  side of Calinore, chuckling with some secret mirth. From there he showed me
  the blast projector that had been dispatched on a <i>lusan</i> from the
  Gateway Wall, and he showed me that the Surahnit who served it were
  untouched by the white, destroying blaze of the Ray. I pretended joy at the
  sight, but within me I was desolate, till from the very sky began that rocky
  rain.</p>

  <p>"Your Taphetnit smashed them, Hula, so that for a while you are safe. But
  only for a while. That is why I have come to you; openly a renegade now to
  the Nal and to Vanark, but not to the Folk; to warn you that you have won not
  a victory but only respite. They will be back, Hula and Seela and Antil!"
  Nalinah turned around to face us all; now for the first time showing she knew
  there was anyone there but Mr. Lambert. "The Surahnit will return to the
  attack in a day or less, and this time their hordes will be as little
  affected by your Ray as the twelve who lie out there. Vanark is not defeated
  yet!"</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" Mr. Lambert took a step back from her, another, and his face
  was white as a sheet. "You mean that he can make more of them immune to the
  <i>kitor's</i> light!"</p>

  <p>"All of them, my Hula, given time. Unless before they come again you can
  devise a new defense against them, Calinore is doomed, and the Taphetnit, and
  your World Above is doomed to fall before the conquering hosts of
  Mernia."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;how can we figure out a new defense when we don't
  even know how they are protecting themselves against this one?"</p>

  <p>"That last I can tell you, Hula, and with what I can tell you, perhaps you
  can meet this new threat. You are so very wise, so very wise."</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Nalinah. Tell me all you know."</p>

  <p>"I will tell you as much as I know, as much as I understand."</p>

  <p>Well, Leeahlee got Nalinah to sit down, and Mr. Lambert sat down, and we
  all sat down, and we all sat around and listened while she told us about it.
  This is the part that's going to be hard, for me to write down, because I
  didn't understand it any too well. But I'll try to make out as best as I
  can.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>Account of Jeremiah Fenton, continued:</em></p><br>

  <p class="first">WHAT Nalinah told us was something like this. She began with
  very much the same thing Antil had told Mr. Lambert back there in that room
  under the Listeners' Post, when he was telling him why Vanark hadn't been
  able to kill him with the <i>kitor</i>.</p>

  <p>The people down here, the Taphetnit, and the Surahnit both look a whole
  lot like humans, but the tiny building blocks their bodies is made up of (Mr.
  Lambert said the words she used meant the same as ions and protons and
  neutrons in English) are hitched together in a different sort of way, so that
  while they stay together all right in the kind of light there is in this
  cavern, they fall apart in the sunlight up above.</p>

  <p>That was why they had never tried to capture the world before, because
  they could only live up there for a little while in the night, and never at
  all in the day. But when last winter the skating party from the Four Corners
  Church got drowned, they got hold of the bodies and some scientist or other
  among them got a bright idea.</p>

  <p>There was one of the drowned people that wasn't all dead when they got him
  inside the Gateway Wall and this scientist took a little blood out of him and
  injected it into the veins of a Surahnit, and then sent him up to the surface
  in a <i>sibral</i> suit. Well, it seems that this Surahnit could stand it up
  there longer than any of them had ever been able to before, and he even stood
  about five minutes of sunlight. He came down then, but a week (Nalinah said a
  <i>steen</i>) later he went up again, and this time he stood the sun for all
  of fifteen minutes.</p>

  <p>That seemed to prove that a little bit of human blood in the veins of a
  Mernian would fix him after a while so that he could live on the surface, but
  when they tried again with blood from one of the other bodies, it didn't
  work. That set them back for a while, till somebody got the bright idea of
  taking blood from the first Surahnit and then putting it into the veins of
  another.</p>

  <p>That worked better, although not as well as the first transfusion, but it
  gave them the clue to what they had to do. The blood they needed had to come
  from living humans.</p>

  <p>Well, they worked and worked, and finally they worked out a scheme for
  making corpses they had hold of come alive. They tried it on one, and he did
  come alive, but the blood from him wasn't any good.</p>

  <p>So that put them up against the proposition that they had to get the blood
  from humans that had never been dead. They sent the first Surahnit up again,
  and he sneaked into someone's house, and sucked out a little blood, putting
  some of his own in its place. When he came down they tried out the
  <i>kitor</i> ray on him, that was the same as sunlight, and he stood it
  perfectly well.</p>

  <p>They gave another Surahnit the blood from him, and after awhile the second
  guy got so that he could stand a little sunlight. They sent the two of them
  up for more. These two found that the human that the blood had been sucked
  from was lying in bed, not moving, and they thought he was dead but they saw
  his pulse beating in his neck and then they knew he wasn't. They both sucked
  blood from him and went down again, and gave the blood to others.</p>

  <p>The next time they went up the first human was gone, so they tried another
  one. But somehow they found out where the first one was, too. He was quite a
  distance away, in a place where there were a lot of beds in a row.</p>

  <p>"The hospital," I bust out. "That first human was Adath Jenks, and the
  second must've been Job Gant. That sleep they're in is caused by these
  Surahnit sucking their blood out of them. Drinking the life out of them."</p>

  <p>Mr. Lambert's eyes were like slits. "You're right, Fenton," he said. "But
  keep quiet, and let Nalinah finish."</p><br>

  <p class="first">WELL, there wasn't much more. It seems the Surahnit can't be
  seen by humans so they could keep right on drinking the life out of their
  victims even though they was both in the hospital. After Mr. Lambert got took
  down to Mernia they started on another victim, that was in a little house
  near the lake.</p>

  <p>"The camp!" It was Mr. Lambert who did the exclaiming this time. "One of
  the boys. Which one?"</p>

  <p>Nalinah shook her head. "I don't know. But his blood is stronger than
  those of the first two, and the process is going on faster. There were twelve
  of the L.S.G. who were altogether fitted for life in the sun, and it was those
  twelve whom Vanark detailed to serve the blast projector.</p>

  <p>"When he saw that this experiment was successful he gave orders for an
  acceleration of the stealing of human blood. Even while the battle was going
  on, four more victims were attacked by the living test tubes he is
  dispatching to carry human life down to Mernia. Just now the sun is bright in
  your Upper World, and the drinking of life is perforce halted but in the
  laboratory there in the East that life is being pumped into the veins of many
  other Surahnit. As soon as it is again dark above, which will be in ten of
  our <i>roha</i> all these will flock up through the waters to seek out more
  and more victims. Thus multiplying the immune ones as fast as he can, Vanark
  figures that in a <i>ranhaltin</i> [a day] a thousand or more Surahnit will
  be immune to your ray. Then he will lead them once more against Calinore, and
  there can be no doubt of the result. Calinore will be wiped out."</p>

  <p>"No doubt at all," Mr. Lambert groaned, his brown fist closing on the edge
  of the table. "No doubt that Calinore will be wiped out and no doubt that a
  hundred humans will be lying at the point of death above there."</p>

  <p>"Maybe they're the lucky ones," I said. "I don't like to think of what's
  going to happen when this bunch of Vanark's gets ready to take over Albany
  County, with their <i>corets</i> and their blast projectors. You've got to
  stop it, Mr. Lambert. You've got to find a way to stop it."</p>

  <p>He gave me a look, then&mdash;and if I ever saw hell staring out of a
  man's eyes, it was in that minute.</p>

  <p>"How can I, Fenton? There isn't a single thing in what she has told me
  that gives me the glimmer of an idea. It's all black, blacker than the pit of
  hell."</p>

  <p>"Look!" I answered him. "You're a million times smarter than I am, but
  sometimes even a fool can get a notion. If they're drinking the blood of the
  humans, maybe if the blood was poisoned that would poison the Surahnit,
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If we could get word to the people above and if we knew how to poison the
  Surahnit without killing the human beings first. No, Fenton, that
  won't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hula!" Nalinah broke in. "Perhaps there is something in what your friend
  says. While I was standing with Vanark a messenger came from the Gateway. He
  reported that something ailed the drinkers from one of the humans. They could
  not bear the test-flash of the <i>kitor</i> upon them. It was as if instead
  of being blunted, the power of the white blaze was redoubled by the blood
  they had drunk. One hundredth of a <i>neks</i> [minutes] they were exposed to
  it, and they melted as if they had been in its light a full five
  <i>neks</i>."</p>

  <p>Mr. Lambert shouted out loud.</p>

  <p>"Now we're getting somewhere! Was there any difference between this human
  do you know, and the others?"</p>

  <p>"It was a small one, a tiny child. But that cannot mean anything; for
  others had drunk from another child and the blood of that one was effective
  as all the rest. Vanark thought it strange; too, that the second child was
  described to him weak and weazened, its bones all awry, while the first was
  perfectly formed."</p><br>

  <p class="first">MR. LAMBERT screwed up his face, thinking hard. "The one
  whose blood works is&mdash;rickety, huh, the other one isn't? Rickety.
  There's something&mdash;Wait! I've got it! Nalinah, I've got it. There aren't
  many rickety children now; they give them viosterol and cure them. And what's
  violteroi, but a solution of vitamin D in oil, of the vitamin that's
  manufactured in the body by what? By sunlight! <i>By sunlight</i>, Nalinah!
  That's why your Surahnit who've drunk that blood burn up when just a little
  more sunlight hits them. It's like taking too strong a dose of
  something&mdash;a little's medicine but a lot's poison. <i>That's</i> what
  we've got to do, pump a lot of viosterol into the veins of all the Life
  Drinkers' victims, a lot of the sunshine vitamin. Then it will be death they
  bring down to Mernia. They and the others with whom they'll share that blood
  will be sensitized to the sunlight instead of being immunized. That's
  what...."</p>

  <p>He stopped, all of a sudden, and the light went out of his face. "But
  that's all nonsense. How am I going to inject viosterol into any human's
  blood when I'm down here, miles underground, and they're up there, and
  there's no way for me to get up there?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Lambert started pacing up and down. Like a wild animal in a cage he
  was; like something shut up and going crazy. I knew how he felt too. It must
  have been awful for him; knowing how he could save us all and knowing at the
  same time that there was no way to do it.</p>

  <p>"There is a way." It was Seela who said that. He'd been listening
  silently, sitting way back in a corner, but now he pushed forward. "If you
  have the courage; Hula, there is a way of reaching the Gateway lock without
  being spied by the Surahnit. Yon are still clad in the <i>sibral</i> suit,
  Hula, and once through the lock you can ascend through the waters. Failure
  means death, Hula, and the chance of failure is very great. Have you the
  courage to try it, friend Hula?"</p>

  <p>"Have I?" Mr. Lambert pushed down on the table with both his hands,
  shoving himself to his feet. "What are we waiting for?"</p>

  <p>It was then that he asked me to finish writing out what was happening in
  Mernia, and said good-by to me. He said good-by to Antil and Leeahlee. To
  Nalinah, too, he said good-by, but we left those two alone together for
  that.</p>

  <p>I don't know what more I can say. They've, been gone almost a whole
  <i>ranhaltin</i> now, Mr. Lambert and Seela and the two picked Taphetnit that
  went with them. None of them has come back and we haven't heard a word from
  them. We're waiting in Seela's house, the four of us and we aren't saying a
  word to each other. We're just waiting.</p>

  <p>That little messenger boy just came in to say that scouts report that the
  Surahnit are massing again, east of here, between Calinore and the Gateway
  Wall. They have three blast projectors with them, all mounted on
  <i>lusans</i>. I guess it's all over.</p>

  <p>The Taphetnit are flocking to the Wall, and I'm going up to the top of the
  tower to work the reflector. It won't do no good, but I might as well die
  fighting as not.</p>

  <p>What was that song Mr. Lambert was singing?</p>

  <p class="verse">In fact quite the cream of the Muscovite team<br>
  Was Ivan Skovinsky Skivar.</p>

  <p>I hope I'll be singing it when the tower is blown out from under me and I
  tumble with it into the ruins of Calinore.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-10"
     id="ch-10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

  <p class="cp"><em>Interpolation by Arthur Leo Zagat, B.S., L.L.B.,<br>
  Compiler of these documents:</em></p><br>

  <p class="first">THE story of Hugh Lambert's attempt to escape from Mernia
  and communicate with humanity is an epic that now has never been written. How
  I learned its details will appear later, but this is, as nearly as I can
  determine, what occurred.</p>

  <p>Seela's plan was simplicity itself. He proposed to carry Lambert straight
  upward from Calinore to the very roof of the monstrous cavern. At that
  immense height they would be well out of sight of any Surahnit between the
  Taphetnit's city and the Gateway Wall, and could fly to it unmolested.</p>

  <p>There was, he assured Lambert, a shelf of rock near the summit of the
  great facade that kept Lake Wanooka from engulfing Mernia, and here they
  could land. Thus far their route would be devoid of danger, but from this
  point on it would be encompassed with peril.</p>

  <p>As the reader is already aware, a constant watch was maintained by the
  Surahnit to hold the Taphetnit bottled up in their besieged city of Calinore.
  Lambert knew how slim were his chances for escape&mdash;how almost impossible
  it would be for Seela's white robes to go unnoticed as he attempted to fly
  with his burden to the ledge where the lock separated Mernia from Earth. No,
  the last stages of the flight would have to be negotiated by climbing down
  some sort of rope from the sheer crags above. The Surahnit would be guarding
  that lock&mdash;perhaps with one man, perhaps with a whole squad of L.S.G.,
  armed with the deadly <i>corets</i>.</p>

  <p>Lambert squared his shoulders and gazed at the young Taphetnit's radiant,
  troubled face. "Come on," he said. "All we can do is try."</p>

  <p>Seela nodded. "It means so&mdash;much..."</p>

  <p>The rope that Hugh would need in the last final climb was made ready, and
  Lambert began to take leave of those he might never see again. There were a
  few precious moments alone with Nalinah, and then Hugh Lambert took Antil's
  hand and shook it warmly. Once more he joined Seela and the two Taphetnit who
  were to accompany them.</p>

  <p>During that long first part of their flight through the strange Mernian,
  sky, few words were uttered. Lambert was too filled with conflicting emotions
  to put them into words. His whole body was keyed up with a stinging tension
  that is sometimes mistakenly named fear&mdash;but there was real dread in
  his heart, too. Not for himself, but for all those he knew and loved upon
  the earth&mdash;all of those he was making this final desperate attempt to
  save. If he failed, what would happen to them? No man could safely say.</p>

  <p>Then another, more terrible dread assailed him&mdash;sharper because it
  was, in a sense, more personal. Suppose he was mad? Suppose everything that
  had occurred&mdash;this strange, unworldly Odyssey&mdash;since those nights,
  on the shores of the Lake, was a nightmare&mdash;a lunatic's fantastic
  dream.</p>

  <p>Tormented, Lambert found comfort in words. He began to question
  Seela&mdash;asking about the origins of the Taphetnit and the Surahnit.</p>

  <p>"We come from the upper world, Hula. But it was so long ago that there is
  no memory of it&mdash;nor any trace, except our memory of the sun which we
  worship in the column of light."</p>

  <p>But even Seela's words seemed to have a strange ring&mdash;the half-poetry
  of their utterance seemed the lilting cadences of a madman's song. They did,
  at least, until Hugh Lambert began to remember the strange things he had seen
  in Mernia the <i>fortlik</i> from which our corn might well have evolved, the
  <i>Eohippi</i> the <i>Dicroreri</i>. He recalled the <i>Kitor</i>, that bore
  a representation of the Solar System. He knew he was not mad.</p>

  <p>"The tale was told me," Seela went on, his voice flowing as the air flowed
  past them in his tireless flight, "by a wise one of the Surahnit who was
  trying to persuade us to join them in their intention to return. He told me
  how our ancestors lived once on the warm surface of the earth, under a sky of
  blue light in which the sun hung, a great white ball, or a sky that sparkled
  with golden lights as the dark rock of the Eastern Wall sparkles. They lived
  in houses thin, very like the present houses of Calinore save that they were
  fashioned from the substance of great plants that grew on the hills. They had
  crude <i>lusans</i>, and primitive <i>corets</i>, and many other such
  things."</p>

  <p>He went on for a while describing a civilization that has been quite
  forgotten. And then the steaming climate began to change.</p>

  <p>"The air, grew steadily colder, and one day some Taphetnit flying far to
  the north returned with an affrighting tale of a great wall of frozen water
  that was moving slowly but surely down upon our land. Mile upon-mile high it
  towered they said, and the crash of the masses falling from it was like
  thunder multiplied a hundred fold."</p>

  <p>"The Glacier," Lambert exclaimed. "The Great Glacier!"</p>

  <p>"Our ancient ones could not believe at first that this doom was marching
  down upon them, but month by month and year by year the ice came nearer, till
  at last there was no doubt that the towering hills whereon they dwelt must be
  engulfed.</p>

  <p>"Some, more cautious than the rest, had searched far and found this great
  bubble within the mountain, and now they proposed that the people seek
  shelter therein till the frozen water should retreat. Others wished to move
  south and ever southward before its face, believing that it would cover the
  land forever. Long and strenuously the dispute was waged, but it was the
  first party that prevailed.</p>

  <p>"And so all the Mernian folk entered this great cavern through a small
  cave mouth where now is the lock to which we fly, bringing with them as much
  of the appurtenances of their lives as they could and their tame beasts, and
  they plugged up the aperture through which they came. The only light here was
  that which flowed from a shining pillar rising far to the west from floor to the
  very roof of the cavern, encircled by a bottomless chasm."</p><br>

  <p class="first">LAMBERT interrupted the recital. "That pillar must be of
  fused quartz. It must go clear up through the mountain to its surface and it
  leads daylight down into this cavern. I've seen rods of fused quartz carry
  light around corners, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps so," Seela broke in, "but the Surahnit worship it as the concrete
  representation of their deity. At any rate, it was about this shaft of light
  that the refugees first clustered and began their life anew.</p>

  <p>"Years passed, uncountable years, and still the water lay frozen against
  the Gateway Wall. Those first ancient ones lived, and gave life to their
  progeny, and died, and their descendants lived and multiplied and died, and
  still were we prisoners here. Little by little, with each generation, there
  grew to be more light in the cavern, till after an unthinkable space the
  rocks, the beasts that had been brought from Outside, and the very bodies of
  Surahnit and Taphetnit, shone with some strange luminance of their own."</p>

  <p>Lambert could not resist offering an explanation of this phenomenon also.
  "The rock and everything else always was emitting that light. It is an
  etheric vibration, a radiant emanation that is just beyond the threshold of
  perception of the visual organs of those who dwell in the light of the sun. A
  gradual evolution took place in the Mernians a change in their very atomic
  structure so long exposed to these emanations; till at last they were able to
  perceive it. Fenton and I can see it too, though the change in us was sudden,
  and I think I know why.</p>

  <p>"We were reduced in size by a reduction of the distances between the
  neutrons and protons in each electron of our constitution. That change
  affected our retinas in a single moment the same way all those centuries of
  evolution affected yours, but we still retain enough of our human attributes
  to be immune to the devastating effect on you of the sun's actinic rays."</p>

  <p>"You may be right, Hula," Seela sighed. "We Taphetnit are not skilled in
  such lore and I shall not attempt to discuss it with you.</p>

  <p>"As time wore on disputes arose between the two races so strangely
  dissimilar. The Surahnit found a way to bridge the chasm about the shining
  shaft and erected their city of Tashna upon the island plateau it bounded. We
  Taphetnit withdrew eastward and constructed our own Calinore. It would take
  too long to narrate all that occurred here through the ages, and I shall not
  attempt it.</p>

  <p>"Came a day when those who were appointed to keep watch on the Gateway
  Wall and that which lay beyond it brought word that there was no longer
  ice on the Outside. But the fierce joy that swept Mernia was quickly stemmed.
  The ice had melted, it was true, yet the great valley where we had roamed the
  hills was filled now with a waste of waters, and we were as surely prisoners
  as before, save that no longer had we any hope of release.</p>

  <p>"The Taphetnit were, resigned to this fate, but the Surahnit would not
  accept it. They devised the lock through which you were brought into Mernia,
  and the garment of <i>sibral</i> that would permit them to pass up through the
  waters and reach its surface. The first daring one who made the ascent never
  returned. But the Nal Surah of that time was not content, and he dispatched
  one after another of his, subjects to the Upper World till at last it was
  discovered that only when, a moonless darkness covered the hills could a
  Mernian exist there for some short space. Not by the waters but by some
  inscrutable change in the very elements of our beings were we now condemned
  forever to dwell in this cavern.</p>

  <p>"So thoroughly, however, was the longing for the open ingrained in us,
  that we, Taphetnit as well as Surahnit, chanced the dangers of forays above
  for even the short space that it was safe for us to remain there. We found a
  race of gigantic beings there, who had sprung from somewhere to populate the
  hills out of which we had been driven. Most times they could not see us at
  all, but some among them, their children, a few of their adults, could
  glimpse us. How is it, Hula, that those who did see us never told the others
  about us?"</p>

  <p>"They did," was the simple response. "They told of what they had seen,
  calling you Taphetnit fairies and the Surahnit gnomes, but those who had not
  the power to see you did not believe them. They were called dreamers,
  superstitious, or, more rudely, drunk or insane. But look here, Seela. The
  little people have been seen not only here in the Helderbergs but all over
  the world. From what you say, you Mernians could not have wandered far. Is it
  possible that very much the same thing as you have told me about happened
  elsewhere on Earth, that this old glob of ours is honeycombed everywhere by
  caverns like this, in which dwell the small folk of a pre-Glacial
  civilization we archaeologists have never dreamed existed?"</p>

  <p>One of the other Taphetnit called out to Seela, just at that moment,
  forestalling whatever answer he might have made. They had reached the eastern
  boundary of the cavern.</p><br>

  <p class="first">HUGH LAMBERT was somewhat dazed with the strange narrative,
  that his knowledge of Earth's geologic history told him had covered in a few
  short sentences the events of far more than fifty thousand years. That long
  it was since the Fourth Glacier loosened its grip on the
  Helderbergs&mdash;how much longer since it fastened it there no one could be
  certain.</p>

  <p>The human knew now that two great streams of evolution, following, their
  own bent for five hundred centuries, were at this very moment confluent, and
  that upon him, upon the events of the next few minutes, depended whether one
  should swamp and obliterate it, or whether they would part again and go on
  their separate courses for another five hundred centuries.</p>

  <p>The thought, the burden of his responsibility, was too appalling to
  contemplate. He shut it from his mind. He had to get down to the ledge below.
  That was the next move. That was the only thing he would think about, the
  next move.</p>

  <p>He waited quietly while Seela wound the end of the leather rope over his
  shoulders and around his chest in a sort of harness and fastened it with a
  slip knot that would hold against a downward pull till doomsday, but would
  yield to a jerk of his hand.</p>

  <p>"Pull once on the rope and we'll stop lowering you," Seela said. "Pull
  twice and we'll swing you in towards the cliff."</p>

  <p>The two Taphetnit stepped behind Lambert and grasped the cable in their
  powerful fingers. Seela and Lambert stood facing each other. Then Lambert
  stepped off.</p>

  <p>Little by little, little by little, that ludicrously inadequate thread
  lengthened. With infinite slowness Lambert moved down past the dark-glowing
  precipice that was first inches, then feet, then a yard from him. He grasped
  the rope above his head with his fingers, and he stared at the slowly
  mounting wall.</p>

  <p>Lambert's fingers were tight on the free end of the slip-knot&mdash;and
  stayed there. Stayed there while the precipice slid steadily upward, stayed
  there till abruptly he saw the long ledge scarring the face of the cliff, saw
  the fire-curtained mouth of the tunnel, and came level with it.</p>

  <p>His left hand pulled once on the rope above his head. The infinitely long
  descent checked.</p>

  <p>A shadow darkened the sparkling curtain in front of him, and then a figure
  came through it, the figure of Talim. The youth stared at the man dangling in
  midair before him, his pupils widening.</p>

  <p>Lambert pulled twice on the rope.</p>

  <p>He started to pendulum in toward the ledge. Talim crouched, his webbed
  fingers darting to his belt, to the handle of a <i>coret</i>. The swing of
  the rope was too slow; before it could carry Lambert to the ledge that
  <i>coret</i> would be out, would be spitting its scarlet death.</p>

  <p>Too slow! Hugh Lambert arched backward, threw that magnificent torso of
  his forward&mdash;and jerked the rope&mdash;and that freed him from the
  suspending cable!'</p>

  <p>The impetus of that desperate effort of his carried his heels to the very
  edge of the ledge, and spent itself. For a split second he swayed there,
  which way he would fall in the lap of the gods. Time stood still.</p>

  <p>Something, the luck of the greatly daring, the prayer that winged itself
  from his tortured brain, some effort of which he was unconscious, sent him
  forward. A scream shrilled from Talim's throat and Lambert's fist knocked the
  <i>coret</i> spinning from the Surahnit's hand.</p>

  <p>It struck the wall, stayed there. Lambert's hands were on Talim's throat
  squeezing. The youth's fists battered the human's chest but the blows were
  fly-flicks to Lambert's perception. Talim went to his knees.</p>

  <p>Other figures burst out of the tunnel's month, soldiers of the L.S.G.,
  their weapons fisted. They looked about them for a confused instant, glimpsed
  the struggling pair. Their <i>corets</i> jabbed point-blank on Hugh
  Lambert.</p>

  <p class="footnote">Editor's note: It is remarkable that in the midst of the
  appalling experiences through which Hugh Lambert was passing, with death
  always imminent and the fate of a race dependent on his lonely struggle, he
  should have contrived to maintain as complete a record of events, as detailed
  a commentary upon them, as he did.<br>
  <br>
  With the exception of the hiatus filled in
  by Jeremiah Fenton's story and my own interpolation, there is no break in the
  narrative I have transcribed by the aid of a magnifying glass from the bundle
  of bleached tiny leather sheets, charred at the edges and water-stained, that
  came into my possession in the spring of 1935. It is with a great deal of
  satisfaction therefore that I am enabled to head the closing scenes of the
  strange and stirring drama we have followed so long with the caption:</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>Hugh Lambert's narrative, continued:</em></p><br>

  <p class="first">I HAD no time to dodge, had no place to dodge to if I could
  have. This was the end.</p>

  <p>Well, I'd done my&mdash;Something white a flash of iridescent colors,
  swept between me and the soldiers! The Taphet received the full force of both
  lancing rays.</p>

  <p>The <i>corets</i> whipped back to bear on me. Seela and the third Taphet
  swooped in, darted desperately at the Surahnit. Their flailing, frantic
  fingers clutched the soldiers arms, their wrists, before the weapons could
  be fired again. But they <i>were</i> fired.</p>

  <p>The Taphetnit spurted into flame, reeled backward. Their great pinions
  incandescent, they reeled back over the brink, plunged downward out of
  sight.</p>

  <p>They did not go alone. They took with them in their blazing arms the two
  L.S.G. guards who had so nearly done for me. A plume of black and greasy
  smoke was all I could see of them, all I could see of those brave and gallant
  beings who had swooped downward out of perfect safety to come to my aid.</p>

  <p>Perhaps they had sensed something wrong because the rope had been freed of
  my weight an instant too quickly. Perhaps, and knowing how great-souled they
  were I believe this to be the truth, it had always been part of their plan to
  follow me down and make certain I should win through to the lock
  unhampered.</p>

  <p>At any rate, their sacrifice ensured the success of my enterprise. No
  other Surahnit came out of the tunnel mouth to interfere with me, and I knew
  that there would be no alarm spread below for a long time. That which would
  soon smash on the cavern floor would be a mass of black-charred carbon
  indistinguishable in shape or form, and the watchers there would think that a
  quartet of fleeing Taphetnit had been rayed by their comrades here.</p>

  <p>I had only Talim to contend with now. The youth, was choked
  half-unconscious; was terrified.</p>

  <p>I let go with one hand, snatched up his <i>coret</i>. "Tell me how to work
  the lock," I said, "if you don't want a dose of this."</p>

  <p>He was, after all, a youngster, and the desire for life was strong within
  him. "I&mdash;I'll tell you," he gasped, terror bulging his eyes. "Don't
  shoot."</p>

  <p>He kept his word. The method of manipulating the lock mechanism was
  simple, almost ridiculously simple. It could be done single-handed with some
  small effort, and so I was enabled to tie up Talim with his own belt, gag him
  with a piece torn from his own uniform, and leave him behind me, well hidden
  in a niche in the tunnel slide.</p>

  <p>Only brief minutes later, I was shooting up through Lake Wanooka's
  unfathomable depths, the hood of the <i>sibral</i> drawn once more over my
  head. I was following the long straight path of the violet ray that made a
  ladder to the world I had long ago given up hope of ever seeing again.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>I reached the surface into a gray dusk that brooded ominously over a
  shoreless sea. Panic gripped me for a poignant moment, terror that I was
  lost, that somehow I had come up out of some distant, unbounded ocean. Then
  I recalled how the familiar beaches of Lake Wanooka had appeared to me when I
  had dwindled to the mannikin I now was, and curving about in the water, saw
  the boulder-strewn slope where that transformation had occurred. I was home!
  Home!</p>

  <p>In an instant I was clambering over the rocks upon that shore making my
  painful way toward the lush jungle out of which I had run, terrified, from a
  two yard earthworm and an enormous spider.</p>

  <p>Three-foot green spears that were blades of timothy threatened to impale
  me; I twisted an ankle in a deep depression that might have been the
  footprint of a field mouse. Outr and exotic my surroundings were, but they
  were on the surface of the earth. They were home! A great pulse of elation
  throbbed within me that almost drove from my mind recollection of what lay
  miles beneath me, of the desperate mission in which I was engaged.</p>

  <p>Almost, but not quite. I remembered I must get to the camp somehow. I
  remembered that I must somehow find a human being, to whom to give my
  message.</p>

  <p>A fist-size stone&mdash;a pebble smaller than a marble, it would be, if I
  were my proper size&mdash;turned, under my foot and threw me to my knees. The
  fall jarred me to the very core, and I did not have the strength to get
  up.</p>

  <p>Tired! Suddenly fatigue had swept down upon me, the fatigue of a day and a
  night through which, without rest, without sleep, almost without food, I had
  been harrowed by such experiences as no man had ever encountered, had
  agonized and fought and agonized and fought again. Tired! Man only can stand
  so much.</p>

  <p>I shook my head, trying to clear it of weariness, trying to think. I dared
  not rest. I had no right to rest. I must get to the office. No, to the
  infirmary. Edith was there. Edith was a nurse and she would be quickest to
  understand my message. It wasn't far. It was only two hundred yards from this
  point on the shore.</p>

  <p>Two hundred yards? To me, as I was now those two hundred yards were twelve
  hundred, were, almost a mile. I couldn't do it. I couldn't.</p>

  <p>But I must. I must! I would rest a little, only a little, and then I would
  go on.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE mists closed in on me again. A Taphet swooped out of the
  sullen sky. Not a Taphet, but a small winged thing that swerved and alighted
  on a bending stalk above me. Its brown wings, nine inches across, fluttered a
  moment and folded.</p>

  <p>This was a creature of my world, of my time. It was no <i>Eohippus</i>, no
  <i>Dicrorerus</i>, but a butterfly. A Gold-banded Skipper. The recognition
  did something to me, gave me strength to stand erect.</p>

  <p>The ground shook beneath me, and I whirled in sudden terror. A looming,
  giant moved toward me, his tremendous knees level with my head.</p>

  <p>His gargantuan body loomed high as he came on. A white, filmy cloud
  wavered over me and behind it his face was a great round moon; grotesquely
  masked by lenses like crystal dinner plates, through which bulging,
  gargoylesque eyeballs peered balefully.</p>

  <p>That face was weirdly familiar. Of course! Once more I had forgotten my
  size. This was no giant! it was a human boy.</p>

  <p>It was Percy White. The cloud was a net and he was stalking the
  butterfly.</p>

  <p>I choked, unable to speak for an instant.</p>

  <p>What luck! What glorious&mdash;</p>

  <p>I was still unable to make a sound, but it was horror that clutched my
  throat now. Percy was looking down at me, straight down at me&mdash;<i>and he
  didn't see me</i>! He saw only the Skipper, directly over my head. I was
  invisible to him, invisible as the Little Men had been to me till the change
  in my blood.</p>

  <p>Was my voice inaudible to him too? I shouted.</p>

  <p>Just in that instant his net swept forward. It missed the butterfly. The
  insect leaped into the air, darted away&mdash;and Percy darted after it!
  Before I could shout again he was hidden by white, stupendous columns of a
  line of birch-saplings that edged the woods here.</p>

  <p>I sobbed with disappointment. With rage. Fury exploded a red flare within
  my skull. It burned away the fatigue. It burned away everything but my
  purpose to get to the infirmary against all odds. The jungle could not stop
  me now. Nothing could stop me. I plunged onward, panting and furious,
  battling the grass and the leaves; battling lashing tendrils of that
  incredibly magnified vegetation.</p>

  <p>Time blurred. The jungle blurred. I was aware only of a gray haze through
  which I struggled interminably, of a haze that at first was gray and then
  darkened as I fought onward through the night.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>Account of Courtney Stone, M.D., continued:</em></p><br>

  <p class="first">I TIMED my return to Camp Saturday night so as to arrive
  thereat suppertime. Not because I wanted to eat with those who were there,
  but quite to the contrary, I didn't want to face them at once. I didn't want
  to face Ann Doring or Edith Horne and answer the question I knew would be in
  their eyes till I had pulled myself together.</p>

  <p>I was a tired and despairing man, that night, as I coasted my car to the
  Camp gate so that its arrival would not be noticed, and stumbled through the
  darkness of the infirmary.</p>

  <p>I was thankful that I had left instructions with Edith that she was to
  insist on Miss Doring's going down to the mess hall with her for all meals.
  There was no point in remaining with the three patients continually; there
  would be no change in them, no sudden emergency, and unless Dick's sister was
  diverted a little from her anxiety she would collapse.</p>

  <p>These artists are high-strung, hyperthyroidic for the most part. They
  cannot bear strains as well as people with ordinary, unemotional
  temperaments.</p>

  <p>The infirmary was quiet, as a result, quiet and peaceful. I went into
  Edith's little office and let myself down heavily into the chair, at her
  desk. I did not bother to turn on the light.</p>

  <p>The result of the tests I had ordered had been negative. Perhaps somewhere
  in Albany or in the Helderbergs there was someone with blood of the nature I
  sought, but he was not in the hospital, either as patient or intern or
  nurse.</p>

  <p>The tests had failed, and my last hope had failed. Job Grant had died
  during the day. Charlie Dorsey would die, and Dick Doring. Hepzibah Foster,
  little Fanny Hall, tiny Jimmie Crane, would linger for a while, sinking,
  sinking, life slowly draining from them till they too would lie white and
  inanimate corpses, on their hospital beds.</p>

  <p>And the disease would go on spreading. Tomorrow morning there would be
  more of its victims in the hospital, tomorrow morning, and the day after and
  the day after. Eventually some way to stop its spread would be found, but
  meantime how many lives would it finally claim? How many?</p>

  <p>My dreary thoughts were interrupted by a sound from the threshold of the
  door that I had forgotten to close.</p><br>

  <p class="first">IT WAS a strange small sound. A dead leaf blown from a tree,
  I thought, but it came again, seemingly nearer. And again.
  <i>Pit&mdash;pit&mdash;pit</i>. Across the floor towards me. Like tiny
  footfalls stumbling, slow and weary across the wooden floor.
  <i>Pit&mdash;pit&mdash;pit</i>. Like the footfalls of some little man, tired
  unto death.</p>

  <p>I smiled at myself, realizing the notion had been suggested by Edith's
  quaint apprehensions of the evening before. If there was anything there, if I
  was not imagining that <i>pit&mdash;pit&mdash;pit</i>, it was some hurt bird,
  that had hopped blindly into the place.</p>

  <p>The idea intrigued me, of a wounded bird coming to the infirmary for
  treatment. Well, I thought, if it's as smart as that it shall be taken care
  of. But I couldn't see it in the darkness. I switched on Edith's desk lamp.
  The yellow light filled the room.</p>

  <p>There was nothing on the floor. Nothing at all. <i>Pit&mdash;pit</i>...the
  sounds came from where there was nothing to be seen, and stopped.</p>

  <p>A prickling chill rippled my vertebral column. <i>I was not alone</i>! The
  room was empty, except for me, but I knew that I was not alone.</p>

  <p>"Court! Courtney Stone!"</p>

  <p>The voice, tiny, shrill, came from where the last <i>pit</i> had sounded;
  from the absolute vacancy at which I stared.</p>

  <p>"Court! Can you hear me? Tell me if you can hear me. Say something if you
  can hear me."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I hear you." My own voice was a croak.</p>

  <p>"Thank God! Court! This is Hugh. Hugh Lambert."</p>

  <p>"Hugh!" I whispered. "You're not&mdash;not dead?" I asked, whispering to
  the nothingness out of which that tenuous, high-pitched voice spoke to me.
  I, Courtney Stone, to whom the very word "ghost" always had been a cause for
  Homeric laughter.</p>

  <p>"Not dead, Court. Changed. You can't see me, but thank God you can hear
  me. I haven't time to explain. They're coming. They're coming from the lake;
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who's coming?"</p>

  <p>"The&mdash;" I lost the word, or did not understand it. But I understood
  the next. "The <i>Little Men</i>! I've got to tell you something before the
  Life-Drinkers get here, before they see me. Listen. Are you listening,
  Court?"</p>

  <p>"The little men! What&mdash;I am listening, Hugh."</p>

  <p>"You've got to do as I say, exactly as I say. Tonight, right away, inject
  as much viosterol, as much Vitamin D as they can stand, into the veins of all
  your coma patients. All of them, Court, at once, and into their veins, into
  their blood. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"I understand, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They're coming, Court. They mustn't see me. They mustn't know." The
  <i>pit&mdash;pit&mdash;pit</i> was commencing again faster now, retreating
  towards the door, and the voice was retreating with it, fading. "Hurry,
  Court, inject Vitamin D at once or nothing can save humanity. Good-by.
  Court."</p>

  <p>"Hugh," a pulsing cry throbbed in my ears. "Don't go, Hugh." I whirled to
  it, to Edith Horne in the doorway from the corridor. She must have come in
  the back way, been standing there and listening. "Don't go, Hugh," she
  sobbed, her hands outstretched and pleading to the empty floor, the empty
  outer door from which no voice, no <i>pit&mdash;pit</i> of tiny feet,
  responded.</p>

  <p>"You heard?" I croaked, staring at her. "I didn't imagine it? You heard
  it, and I'm not insane?"</p>

  <p>"I heard. It was Hugh. Hugh, doctor, come back from where he has been to
  tell us what to do. I knew he would come, when we needed him. We must do what
  Hugh said, doctor. He said to hurry, doctor. We must hurry."</p>

  <p>"Vitamin D, he said," I gulped. "Viosterol. But that's utterly ridiculous.
  No warrant in physiology, in any branch of science, for thinking of that as a
  treatment for coma&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll call the hospital and you can give them the orders," she interrupted
  me. "To inject viosterol into all the patients they have there and send us a
  supply for our two by motorcycle." Coming into the room she stumbled. I saw
  the lax form slumped on the floor over which she had stumbled, Ann Doring on
  the floor in a dead faint. They had come to the door together, and Ann had
  fainted at the sound of that spectral voice.</p>

  <p>The rattle of the telephone dial beside me brought me around to, it. I
  caught Edith's hand.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" I exclaimed. "Wait a second. Let me think. It's an outrageous
  proposition. It's contrary to all medical knowledge. It may kill the
  patients. My reputation&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hang your reputation," she flared out. "Hugh said we were to do it.
  Hugh..."</p>

  <p>Ann Doring moaned, on the floor.</p>

  <p>"All right," I said weakly. "We'll do it."</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><em>Continuation of Hugh Lambert's narrative:</em></p>

  <p class="first">I SAW the two girls come in as I stood in the center of an
  immense expanse of wooden floor and shouted my message at Courtney Stone,
  towering above me. I saw them come in and I saw Ann drop in at the sound of
  my voice, and I saw a fierce joy flare into Edith's face.</p>

  <p>But I could not speak to her because I had to get my message over to Court
  and I had only seconds in which to do it.</p>

  <p>Jumping the six-foot step from the infirmary threshold to the rocky desert
  of the path that led to it, I heard Edith's booming words. "We must do what
  Hugh said," and then I was running across that stretch of rocks and into the
  covert of the jungle that crowded it close. I gained that concealment just in
  time.</p>

  <p>Past me, out therein the open, trotted one, two, a score of the
  <i>sibral</i>-garmented Surahnit I had heard following me up from the lake,
  just as I had collided with the great vertical cliff of the infirmary wall
  and came out of the daze through which I had somehow fought to my goal.</p>

  <p>So close, after all I had endured, had I been to failure. For if they had
  come upon me talking to Court they would have sent back word of it to Vanark,
  and the Rata would have suspected at once that I had discovered a way to
  checkmate him and devised a countermove.</p>

  <p>I watched four of the Surahnit climb the infirmary threshold and vanish
  within. I watched the rest skirt the infirmary corner and disappear into a
  looming dark thicket I knew to be the thick hemlock edge bordering the road
  to Albany.</p>

  <p>Almost at once they appeared again, heaving out between them a teardrop
  <i>lusan</i>.</p>

  <p>They tugged and heaved it to the road, climbed into it, and were off.</p>

  <p>Then my weariness struck an almost physical blow, and oblivion claimed
  me.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-11"
     id="ch-11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <p class="cp"><em>Continuation of Hugh Lambert's narrative:</em></p><br>

  <p class="first">I WAS awakened by a hand on my shoulder; shaking me.
  "Blazes," I muttered. "This is the first time I didn't hear the bugle blow. A
  nightmare I was having must have dogged me, Ed. Wait till I tell&mdash;"</p>

  <p>My drowsy mutter choked off. My eyes had opened and I was peering at a
  sharp-featured vulturine countenance just visible in the misty luminance of
  before dawn.</p>

  <p>"What ails you?" the Surahnit demanded. "Lying here asleep? Good thing I
  got off the clear road and came upon you, or&mdash;" He broke off, and then:
  "By the shaft of the eternal, you are not a Mernian! You are&mdash;"</p>

  <p>My hands flashed up. My thumbs clamped on his windpipe, tightened. I felt
  flesh crawl greasily under their pressure. I felt gristle crumple.</p>

  <p>After a while the <i>sibral</i>-clothed body was flaccid, lifeless.</p>

  <p>I thrust it from me, rose to my feet, pulling the head of my garment over
  my head to hide the face that had betrayed me. Through, a leafy screen I saw
  a wraithlike procession of Surahnit gliding past. They were returning to the
  lake, to Mernia, satiated with the blood they had sucked from the Lord alone
  knew how many humans.</p>

  <p>What sort of blood was it? They were carrying with them death in their
  veins, but was it their death and that of their kind, or death to the gallant
  Taphetnit and to my own people?</p>

  <p>Had Courtney Stone done as I had bidden him?</p>

  <p>Even if he had, would the viosterol act in the manner I hoped? Well, I
  would know in a week, a month. If I had failed some time soon the lake would
  vomit forth a shambling troop of dead-alive, and after them a horde of
  Surahnit, and this pleasant countryside would become a harried hell as those
  who had been exiled from it five hundred centuries ago retook it.</p>

  <p>Meantime; for a little space at least, I should see the sun again and feel
  it upon me. I should talk again with my own kind, and hold a girl of my own
  human race in my arms.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter, Edith?" a great voice said. "Can't you sleep,
  either?"</p>

  <p>"Sleep? I'm too tired to sleep after last, night. And besides, I have a
  feeling that Hugh Lambert is somewhere near, very near."</p>

  <p>Near. I was not more than sixty feet from her! I started out of the
  jungle, got to the pathway. I halted, seeing them, Edith Horne and Courtney
  Stone, standing gigantic in the gigantic doorway of the infirmary.</p>

  <p>"I've just been in to see Ann," Court said. "She's quietly asleep. She'll
  suffer no ill effects from her faint."</p>

  <p>Edith was wan, pale, tired-looking. She must have been working hard, too
  hard for her strength. I started to call out to her...</p>

  <p>I caught myself just in time. There were more Surahnit coming, in through
  the camp gateway, coming toward me along the path. If they'd heard me!</p>

  <p>"Look, doctor; see that swirl of ground mist there." Edith was pointing
  straight at me. "Doesn't it look almost like a little mannikin, standing
  there?"</p>

  <p>"Why are you dallying here?" the foremost Surahnit said gruffly as he came
  up to me. "Get going." It was Hafna, the subaltern who had come so near
  <i>coretting</i> me at Vanark's command at the very moment of my reaching
  Mernia. "There is more of the mist on the path now," Edith was saying. "When
  the sun comes up it will vanish, like Hugh vanished, into nothingness."</p>

  <p>She was looking straight at me and all she saw was a little drifting vapor
  that the sun would dry in an instant. That was all any human would ever
  see.</p>

  <p>I turned and went down to the lake with Hafna, down to the lake, and into
  it, and down, down; down through those stupendous depths to Mernia.</p>

  <p>To Mernia, and the Taphetnit. To Fenton and Antil, and Leeahlee...</p>

  <p>And Nalinah.</p><br>

  <p class="first">INDISTINGUISHABLE from the Surahnit because, clad in the
  <i>sibral</i>-suit and hooded by it, there was nothing to set me apart from
  them, it was easy to reach the lock and go through it, and out to the ledge
  from which I first viewed Mernia.</p>

  <p>There, however; my troubles began. The procession marched along the lofty
  shelf in the direction Vanark had led me, and I guessed that they were
  proceeding to the great cave that had been set aside as a laboratory. Here,
  undoubtedly, they would be stripped of their clothing and subjected to the
  transfusions Nalinah had described. Here my masquerade would be
  discovered.</p>

  <p>I must never reach that cave. How could I avoid it? The first of the
  openings in the cliff wall whose curtains of living-light has so astonished
  me suggested a stratagem. I began limping, muttered something about having
  injured my foot. This enabled me to drift gradually to the end of the line of
  returning Mernians, and to duck unnoticed into a cave whose irregular opening
  marked it as a natural hollow.</p>

  <p>It was a mere niche in the face of the cliff, so shallow that there was
  scarcely room for me, but it sufficed. Another group of Life-Drinkers
  shuffled by&mdash;beyond the veil of darting sparks which concealed me, and then a
  long silence let me know that I need fear encountering no more of them.</p>

  <p>So far, so good, but how was I to reach the cavern-floor, how make my way
  to distant Calinore?</p>

  <p>Well, I had gotten as far as I had, not by planning, but by proceeding
  step by step, meeting each emergency as it arose, not thinking, not knowing,
  what the next one might be. I had only two choices, to go right along the
  ledge or to the left. To the right was toward detection and death. I
  cautiously emerged from my hiding place and darted left.</p>

  <p>I went past the exit from the lock, went past a great fold in the Cliff's
  parapet. The ledge started to slant upward, and the faint hope I had nursed
  that I might come to some less impossible way of descent, died.</p>

  <p>I kept on because there was nothing else to do, squeezed past another
  bulge in the face of the precipice, where for a terrible moment I clung to
  safety only by toe and fingerholds, my heels projecting over those awful
  depths. The rocky shelf widened, just beyond there, and I went to my knees,
  trembling with belated fear, blind with a dizzy vertigo.</p>

  <p>Arms went around me from behind, clamping my arms! I was helpless in a
  terrible grip! The whir of powerful pinions was in my ears and I felt myself
  lifted. A hand, stripped the <i>sibral</i> hood, from my head, and I heard a
  chorus of twitters all about me, a chorus of birdlike Taphetnit.</p>

  <p>"It is he. It is Hula! He has returned to us."</p>

  <p>I was in the arms of a Taphet. A covey of his fellows were about me and we
  were darting in a swift, steep slant for the obscurity of the cavern
  roof!</p>

  <p>They were scouts sent out from Calinore to watch the movements of the
  Surahnit concentration here in the east. Seeing me making my perilous way
  along the ledge, they had suspected who I was. The wide place where vertigo
  had overcome me was a bulge in the cliff side that had somewhat screened them
  from observation below and they had taken advantage of that to pluck me from
  it.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">I AM once more at the platform high over Calinore, and
  Jeremiah Fenton is beside me. I am still warm with the greeting with which
  Antil and Leeahlee received me. I am still tingling with recollection of the
  look in Nalinah's eyes when she saw me return, and a few whispered words that
  passed between us. But I am cold, too, with apprehension. I am quivering with
  the tenseness of hope and fear and dread.</p>

  <p>In minutes now, in a few short minutes, I shall know whether that
  tremendous journey of mine has been in vain. The scouts have flown in with
  word that Vanark's legions are advancing, and now I can see them on the far
  eastern horizon. The dark line limiting the desolate, barren desert of rock
  that is Mernia's soil has come suddenly alive.</p>

  <p>They are coming now, a thousand Surahnit with human blood in their veins,
  a thousand Surahnit armed with the dreadful <i>corets</i> against which no
  human army will be able to stand if ever they are confronted with that dark
  green host, and they are dragging with them three blast-projectors whose blue
  flares can level Calinore to a chaos of jumbled rock in ten of the Mernian
  <i>neska</i> [minute].</p>

  <p>"Come on, Mr. Lambert," Jeremiah Fenton says to me, quietly. "You better
  quit writing. Time for us to get busy."</p><br>

  <p class="first">IT IS over. That Surahnit post came steadily onward, a
  fearful green wave engulfing the brooding plain till it reached the landmarks
  I had picked out as bounding the farthest range of reflector-magnified beam
  of our captured <i>kitor</i>.</p>

  <p>I snapped a command to Fenton and the white ray shot blazing out. It
  reached to meet those advancing squadrons and fingered their serried front
  line tentatively, as if the light itself were doubtful of its own power.</p>

  <p>Those green-clad forms melted to nothingness!</p>

  <p>Strangely, I felt no elation, no such burst of jubilation as surged up
  from the breathless city, surged up in a great roar of sound from the
  Taphetnit watching upon the Wall. I played that destroying spray of
  artificial sunlight up and down the gallant ranks. I watched them dribble and
  melt down and film the rock with a glistening yellow pool and knew the
  victory was mine, and the taste of it was as ashes.</p>

  <p>The world above was safe from the ancient race that had planned to
  reconquer it, but I knew I should never see it again.</p>

  <p>I was thinking, in that moment, of an auburn-haired, pert-faced girl who
  had stood in the dim grayness of before-dawn and pointed to a winding gravel
  path. I was hearing her voice tremendous in my ears.</p>

  <p>"Look, doctor," she was saying, "see that swirl of ground mist there.
  Doesn't it look almost like a little mannikin?"</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">THERE remained, after the light-beam flashed, a few Surahnit
  that it had not destroyed&mdash;fortunate Mernians who had been completely
  immunized before Court Stone had injected the viosterol into the veins of the
  Life-Drinkers victims. Luckily none of these had been near the
  blast-projectors and though they fought gallantly they were overwhelmed by
  the swarms of Taphetnit who darkened the sky as soon as I shut off the beam
  Jeremiah Fenton dubbed, "the flaming sword."</p>

  <p>True to their gentle nature, the Winged Ones attempted to capture rather
  than kill their ancient enemies, and they brought in a number of prisoners.
  Among these was Vanark.</p>

  <p>The dark faced Rata, still snarling and defiant despite his defeat,
  threatened. Antil and the Taphetnit with a dreadful vengeance, but in the
  midst of his tirade a messenger arrived from the Nal Surah proposing a truce
  and a conference between the two Mernian races to formulate a treaty to
  govern their future relations in the cavern.</p>

  <p>The Winged Ones honored me by insisting upon my acting as one of their
  representatives, with Antil and Lura and a half-dozen others of their own
  people. I knew that the rest of my life would be spent among them, and I
  accepted.</p>

  <p>The conference was held at once. I shall never forget Antil's speech in
  answer to the Nal's request for the Taphetnit's terms.</p>

  <p>"We have no terms," he said. "We grieve that there has been this strife
  between us, and we desire nothing more than that our two races shall dwell
  henceforth in peace and friendship within this cavern. Different in certain
  respects as we are, we are yet brethren and as brethren we should work
  together for the common happiness of all Mernia.</p>

  <p>"Tashna is yours and Calinore is ours and in each city we shall continue
  to dwell as we have been accustomed. For the rest, we propose that an equal
  number of Taphetnit be admitted to the Ratanit, and that this council govern
  Mernia for the peace and happiness of all Mernia. That is all."</p>

  <p>So it was agreed. We returned to Calinore a very happy delegation feeling
  that despite all its limitations the great cavern within the earth will
  henceforth be a very pleasant place in which to live.</p><br>

  <p class="first">WE GATHERED at last in the house that had been Seela's and
  now was Antil's, the group, small but oddly assorted, that had endured so
  much together. There were Antil and Leeahlee, Felton and myself, and Nalinah.
  So much had happened that I found it hard to realize it was only the end of
  the second <i>ranhaltin</i> since Vanark had brought me to this strange,
  subterranean world that henceforth would be my home.</p>

  <p>The girls had prepared a meal of <i>fortlik</i> and the wine they called
  <i>zingbar</i>. We sat down at the table, but before we began to eat, Antil
  rose. He stood there, a shining, handsome youth still vibrant still jaunty
  despite the weariness that must have crept sluggishly in his veins as it
  crept in mine.</p>

  <p>"My friends," he commenced. "We have come to the end of an arduous journey
  and at last we have a little time to think of ourselves. You all know, I am
  sure, how very happy I am with the issue of our long struggle with the peace
  that was ratified this day and will reign henceforth in this beloved Mernia
  of mine. You all share the happiness with me, and I wish to share with you
  another more personal happiness."</p>

  <p>His glowing eyes strayed along the table and found Leeahlee's gray ones,
  and I knew what it was he meant. "I have dwelt all my life in Calinore," he
  continued, "and though I grew to know the Taphetnit as my people, as my very
  dear people, yet was I lonely always for my own kind. I am lonely no longer,
  my friends. I shall never be lonely again. I&mdash;I&mdash;" he stuttered
  suddenly. His face broke into a boyish smile. "Friends&mdash;Leeahlee has
  promised to be my wife. Leeahlee&mdash;I can't believe it yet but she says it
  is so."</p>

  <p>I jumped to my feet, raising a goblet of <i>zingbar</i> in my hand.
  "Drink! To Antil and Leeahlee and their happiness! Drink! And no heel
  taps."</p>

  <p>When we had drunk that toast, I remained standing. "Friends," I said, and
  there was a quiver in my voice. "Friends, I too have something to say to you.
  Or rather, to say to one of you, before the others."</p>

  <p>I half turned so that I was facing Nalinah, so that I was looking into the
  blue depths of her eyes. "Nalinah," I said, slowly, distinctly. "In a certain
  book that had lived for many centuries among us of the Upper World, that
  lives still and will forever, there is a tale of two people of stranger races
  who met, and loved. In that book it tells how one of these said to the other,
  I will go with thee and be thy spouse. Thy people will be my people, and thy
  race my race.</p>

  <p>"Nalinah, my dear, I say that to you now. Will you go with me and be my
  bride?"</p>

  <p>I saw a great joy, a great happiness, flare into the sweet face I had
  learned to love. And then I saw it fade beneath a film of gray. I saw the warm
  lips of old rose move in a wistful smile.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, my Hula," I heard them say. "You offer me as great an honor as
  ever man can to maid. But have you thought, really thought of what it would
  mean were I to accept that which you tender? You have heard Antil, just now.
  <i>The Taphetnit were my people, my very dear people, yet was I lonely always
  for my own kind.</i> If you wed me and remain here always, always you will be
  lonely."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I murmured. "Yes. But&mdash;" I threw my arms wide in a hopeless
  gesture. "But whether or not you take me, I must still remain here."</p>

  <p>She smiled again, that tender, pathetic smile. "Hula. While you were gone
  in Tashna, I went to Vanark. What I said to him matters not, but he told me
  finally that which I wanted to know of him. Hula, you can return, and very
  simply too. All you need do is lie bathed in its full bright rays for a
  single hour."</p>

  <p>"Nalinah! Vanark hates me, and he hates you. What was it you told him,
  what was it you promised him in exchange for that secret?"</p>

  <p>The tiny oval of her countenance was a pallid mask, and her eyes were
  glazed, expressionless. "Vanark does not hate me," she said in dead monotone
  "Or rather that virulent hate of his was born of a love that once I spurned.
  I told him that now, seeing him weak and defeated, I had learned that I loved
  him. I&mdash;I was wedded to him, Hula, in that cell of his, just before you
  returned from Tashna."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-12"
     id="ch-12"></a>EPILOGUE</h2>

  <p class="cp"><em>Letter from Hugh Lambert, B.S., M.Sc., F.A.G.S., F.R.G.S.,
  etc.:</em></p><br>

  <p class="letter">Dear Zagat</p>

  <p class="letter">You have asked me to finish up the tale of that
  unbelievable adventure of mine.</p>

  <p class="letter">Let me skip to the moment when Fenton and I awoke on the
  shore of Lake Wanooka.</p>

  <p class="letter">We were stark naked, and our bodies were wet with the
  perspiration brought out on them by the sun, still pretty hot even though we
  were well into autumn.</p>

  <p class="letter">I ached all over, every muscle, every sinew of me. I felt
  as though someone had been going over me with a padded bludgeon, pounding me
  to insensibility. But I didn't mind that. I didn't mind anything. For as I
  looked about me, I saw grass and bushes. I saw the old lake glimmering in the
  bright, early morning sunlight, and I could see the opposite bank, the hill
  rising from it, the old familiar hill I had looked at all summer. I was lying
  on a pebbly beach, and a grasshopper that leaped on my thigh and leaped off
  was half the size of my little finger.</p>

  <p class="letter">From somewhere came the distant, deep tolling of a bell. It
  came again, welling slowly and lazily through the morning hush.</p>

  <p class="letter">"It's Sunday," Fenton said. "That's the bell of the Four
  Corners Methodist Church and it only rings on Sunday."</p>

  <p class="letter">"Sunday," I repeated, staring at him. "But it can't be. It
  was Thursday night when this thing began, and I was down there only
  two&mdash;two <i>ranhaltin</i>. Two&mdash;" Then the amazing truth struck me.
  "Good Lord!" I groaned. "I should have realized it from the war the day and
  night didn't match up when I made that visit here. Time runs differently up
  here and down below. Time in one place is entirely different from that in the
  other."</p>

  <p class="letter">"Everything is different there and here," the farmer
  replied. "But me, I'm glad I'm back. I want to see some people, some humans.
  That's what I want now. But we can't go prospecting around, naked like
  this."</p>

  <p class="letter">I replied, jumping up, "I don't care whether I'm seen nude
  or not. But if you're so blooming modest we'll duck through the woods to the
  guest house. There's always a couple of bathing suits lying around there that
  people leave from year to year."</p>

  <p class="letter">We did exactly that. I left the sheets there with Fenton,
  on which I'd written what had happened, and stole up through the woods to the
  infirmary I heard girls voices.</p>

  <p class="letter">Then I stepped out into the pathway.</p>

  <p class="letter">The two girls, standing in their bathrobes just outside the
  infirmary door, didn't see me at once. I looked at them, at the two of them,
  eating them with my eyes.</p>

  <p class="letter">I thought of them as I had seen them last, giants coming
  into the infirmary office. I remembered the look on Edith's face, and I
  remembered Ann dropping in a faint.</p>

  <p class="letter">I thought of how Edith had leaped at once to carry out the
  behest of my message, so tremendously important.</p>

  <p class="letter">I looked at Ann, so glamorous, and so very beautiful.</p>

  <p class="letter">I called to them. I called a name.</p>

  <p class="letter">The name was "Edith!"</p>

  <p class="letter">She looked up, and saw me. She came to me, came into the
  arms I held out to receive her.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[Editor's note: Hugh Lambert here tells of the jubilation
  with which his return was received, and how after a while it was decided that
  the real story of what had happened should be kept secret for a time at
  least. Mr. Lambert then goes back to fill the blank I have already noted,
  between the end of Jeremiah Fenton's story and his own fight with Talim on
  the ledge.<br>
<br>
  Jethro Parker never knew that he was not really a victim of
  the same disease from which the others suffered. His Martha was so grateful
  to Doctor Stone for the care the physician had lavished on her husband that
  she forbade Parker to even mention the matter of the vanished tramp
  again.<br>
<br>
  Edith Horne and Hugh Lambert were married in the Four
  Corners Church the following Sunday. Ann Doring acted as bridesmaid and
  Jeremiah Fenton as best man. The happy couple for some inexplicable reason,
  decided to spend their honeymoon at the Camp, now deserted. It is with an
  incident there that Hugh Lambert closes his letter to me.&mdash;A.L.Z.]</p>

  <p class="letter">It was only two weeks since I had come back from that weird
  adventure of mine and already it seemed as though it had never happened,
  never could have happened. One night, however, the moon streaming in through
  the window of the little infirmary room woke me. I listened to Edith's quiet
  breathing. I stared at the tangled, snakelike shadows of stripped tree-limbs
  on the ceiling, and there was no sleep in me. Gradually, so imperceptibly
  that I did not notice when it began, a feeling that I had forgotten stole
  over me.</p>

  <p class="letter">It was the lake. The lake was calling me again. Calling me
  down to its shore.</p>

  <p class="letter">I slid stealthily out of bed, hardly knowing, what I was
  doing. Barefoot as I was, I tiptoed out of the room, out of the infirmary
  door, down through the woods to the bank of the waters.</p>

  <p class="letter">The moonlight laid a shimmering, silver film over the quiet
  waters. Yards from shore that film deepened in color became almost
  violet.</p>

  <p class="letter">A black bubble broke the glimmering surface just there. A
  tiny form lifted out of the waves. Dripping arms rose to its head, stripped
  back a hood that covered it.</p>

  <p class="letter">I saw an aureole of flaxen hair. I saw a tiny doll's face,
  oval and sharp-chinned and sad, one miniature arms extend to me, gemmed by
  flashing droplets.</p>

  <p class="letter">The water was suddenly cold on my feet. I was wading out
  into the lake wading out toward that tiny, pathetic form.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Good-by!" I don't know whether I heard that voice,
  tinkling like a silver bell, or whether I imagined it. "Good-by, my
  Hula!"</p>

  <p class="letter">She was gone. Nalinah was gone. There was nothing out there
  but the rippling shimmer of moonlight upon the lake. There was nothing there
  at all.</p>
