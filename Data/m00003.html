<h2>The Sea-Hawk<br>
<br>
by<br>

Rafael Sabatini</h2>

<hr>

<h2>NOTE</h2>

<p>Lord Henry Goade, who had, as we shall see, some personal
acquaintance with Sir Oliver Tressilian, tells us quite bluntly
that he was ill-favoured. But then his lordship is addicted to
harsh judgments and his perceptions are not always normal. He says,
for instance, of Anne of Cleves, that she was the "ugliest woman
that ever I saw." As far as we can glean from his own voluminous
writings it would seem to be extremely doubtful whether he ever saw
Anne of Cleves at all, and we suspect him here of being no more
than a slavish echo of the common voice, which attributed
Cromwell's downfall to the ugliness of this bride he procured for
his Bluebeard master. To the common voice from the brush of
Holbein, which permits us to form our own opinions and shows us a
lady who is certainly very far from deserving his lordship's harsh
stricture. Similarly, I like to believe that Lord Henry was wrong
in his pronouncement upon Sir Oliver, and I am encouraged in this
belief by the pen-portrait which he himself appends to it. "He
was," he says, "a tall, powerful fellow of a good shape, if we
except that his arms were too long and that his feet and hands were
of an uncomely bigness. In face he was swarthy, with black hair and
a black forked beard; his nose was big and very high in the bridge,
and his eyes sunk deep under beetling eyebrows were very
pale-coloured and very cruel and sinister. He had&mdash;and this I
have ever remarked to be the sign of great virility in a
man&mdash;a big, deep, rough voice, better suited to, and no doubt
oftener employed in, quarter-deck oaths and foulnesses than the
worship of his Maker."</p>

<p>Thus my Lord Henry Goade, and you observe how he permits his
lingering disapproval of the man to intrude upon his description of
him. The truth is that&mdash;as there is ample testimony in his
prolific writings&mdash;his lordship was something of a
misanthropist. It was, in fact, his misanthropy which drove him, as
it has driven many another, to authorship. He takes up the pen, not
so much that he may carry out his professed object of writing a
chronicle of his own time, but to the end that he may vent the
bitterness engendered in him by his fall from favour. As a
consequence he has little that is good to say of anyone, and rarely
mentions one of his contemporaries but to tap the sources of a
picturesque invective. After all, it is possible to make excuses
for him. He was at once a man of thought and a man of
action&mdash;a combination as rare as it is usually deplorable. The
man of action in him might have gone far had he not been ruined at
the outset by the man of thought. A magnificent seaman, he might
have become Lord High Admiral of England but for a certain
proneness to intrigue. Fortunately for him&mdash;since otherwise he
could hardly have kept his head where nature had placed it&mdash;he
came betimes under a cloud of suspicion. His career suffered a
check; but it was necessary to afford him some compensation since,
after all, the suspicions could not be substantiated.</p>

<p>Consequently he was removed from his command and appointed by
the Queen's Grace her Lieutenant of Cornwall, a position in which
it was judged that he could do little mischief. There, soured by
this blighting of his ambitions, and living a life of comparative
seclusion, he turned, as so many other men similarly placed have
turned, to seek consolation in his pen. He wrote his singularly
crabbed, narrow and superficial History of Lord Henry Goade: his
own Times&mdash;which is a miracle of injuvenations, distortions,
misrepresentations, and eccentric spelling. In the eighteen
enormous folio volumes, which he filled with his minute and gothic
characters, he gives his own version of the story of what he terms
his downfall, and, having, notwithstanding his prolixity, exhausted
this subject in the first five of the eighteen tomes, he proceeds
to deal with so much of the history of his own day as came
immediately under his notice in his Cornish retirement.</p>

<p>For the purposes of English history his chronicles are entirely
negligible, which is the reason why they have been allowed to
remain unpublished and in oblivion. But to the student who attempts
to follow the history of that extraordinary man, Sir Oliver
Tressilian, they are entirely invaluable. And, since I have made
this history my present task, it is fitting that I should here at
the outset acknowledge my extreme indebtedness to those chronicles.
Without them, indeed, it were impossible to reconstruct the life of
that Cornish gentleman who became a renegade and a Barbary Corsair
and might have become Basha of Algiers&mdash;or Argire, as his
lordship terms it&mdash;but for certain matters which are to be set
forth.</p>

<p>Lord Henry wrote with knowledge and authority, and the tale he
has to tell is very complete and full of precious detail. He was,
himself, an eyewitness of much that happened; he pursued a personal
acquaintance with many of those who were connected with Sir
Oliver's affairs that he might amplify his chronicles, and he
considered no scrap of gossip that was to be gleaned along the
countryside too trivial to be recorded. I suspect him also of
having received no little assistance from Jasper Leigh in the
matter of those events that happened out of England, which seem to
me to constitute by far the most interesting portion of his
narrative.</p>

<h2>PART I &mdash; SIR OLIVER TRESSILIAN</h2>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I &mdash; THE HUCKSTER</h2>

<p>Sir Oliver Tressilian sat at his ease in the lofty dining-room
of the handsome house of Penarrow, which he owed to the enterprise
of his father of lamented and lamentable memory and to the skill
and invention of an Italian engineer named Bagnolo who had come to
England half a century ago as one of the assistants of the famous
Torrigiani.</p>

<p>This house of such a startlingly singular and Italianate grace
for so remote a corner of Cornwall deserves, together with the
story of its construction, a word in passing.</p>

<p>The Italian Bagnolo who combined with his salient artistic
talents a quarrelsome, volcanic humour had the mischance to kill a
man in a brawl in a Southwark tavern. As a result he fled the town,
nor paused in his headlong flight from the consequences of that
murderous deed until he had all but reached the very ends of
England. Under what circumstances he became acquainted with
Tressilian the elder I do not know. But certain it is that the
meeting was a very timely one for both of them. To the fugitive,
Ralph Tressilian&mdash;who appears to have been inveterately
partial to the company of rascals of all
denominations&mdash;afforded shelter; and Bagnolo repaid the
service by offering to rebuild the decaying half-timbered house of
Penarrow. Having taken the task in hand he went about it with all
the enthusiasm of your true artist, and achieved for his protector
a residence that was a marvel of grace in that crude age and
outlandish district. There arose under the supervision of the
gifted engineer, worthy associate of Messer Torrigiani, a noble
two-storied mansion of mellow red brick, flooded with light and
sunshine by the enormously tall mullioned windows that rose almost
from base to summit of each pilastered facade. The main doorway was
set in a projecting wing and was overhung by a massive balcony, the
whole surmounted by a pillared pediment of extraordinary grace, now
partly clad in a green mantle of creepers. Above the burnt red
tiles of the roof soared massive twisted chimneys in lofty
majesty.</p>

<p>But the glory of Penarrow&mdash;that is, of the new Penarrow
begotten of the fertile brain of Bagnolo&mdash;was the garden
fashioned out of the tangled wilderness about the old house that
had crowned the heights above Penarrow point. To the labours of
Bagnolo, Time and Nature had added their own. Bagnolo had cut those
handsome esplanades, had built those noble balustrades bordering
the three terraces with their fine connecting flights of steps;
himself he had planned the fountain, and with his own hands had
carved the granite faun presiding over it and the dozen other
statues of nymphs and sylvan gods in a marble that gleamed in white
brilliance amid the dusky green. But Time and Nature had smoothed
the lawns to a velvet surface, had thickened the handsome boxwood
hedges, and thrust up those black spear-like poplars that completed
the very Italianate appearance of that Cornish demesne.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver took his ease in his dining-room considering all this
as it was displayed before him in the mellowing September sunshine,
and found it all very good to see, and life very good to live. Now
no man has ever been known so to find life without some immediate
cause, other than that of his environment, for his optimism. Sir
Oliver had several causes. The first of these&mdash;although it was
one which he may have been far from suspecting&mdash;was his
equipment of youth, wealth, and good digestion; the second was that
he had achieved honour and renown both upon the Spanish Main and in
the late harrying of the Invincible Armada&mdash;or, more aptly
perhaps might it be said, in the harrying of the late Invincible
Armada&mdash;and that he had received in that the twenty-fifth year
of his life the honour of knighthood from the Virgin Queen; the
third and last contributor to his pleasant mood&mdash;and I have
reserved it for the end as I account this to be the proper place
for the most important factor&mdash;was Dan Cupid who for once
seemed compounded entirely of benignity and who had so contrived
matters that Sir Oliver's wooing Of Mistress Rosamund Godolphin ran
an entirely smooth and happy course.</p>

<p>So, then, Sir Oliver sat at his ease in his tall, carved chair,
his doublet untrussed, his long legs stretched before him, a
pensive smile about the firm lips that as yet were darkened by no
more than a small black line of moustachios. (Lord Henry's portrait
of him was drawn at a much later period.) It was noon, and our
gentleman had just dined, as the platters, the broken meats and the
half-empty flagon on the board beside him testified. He pulled
thoughtfully at a long pipe&mdash;for he had acquired this newly
imported habit of tobacco-drinking&mdash;and dreamed of his
mistress, and was properly and gallantly grateful that fortune had
used him so handsomely as to enable him to toss a title and some
measure of renown into his Rosamund's lap.</p>

<p>By nature Sir Oliver was a shrewd fellow ("cunning as twenty
devils," is my Lord Henry's phrase) and he was also a man of some
not inconsiderable learning. Yet neither his natural wit nor his
acquired endowments appear to have taught him that of all the gods
that rule the destinies of mankind there is none more ironic and
malicious than that same Dan Cupid in whose honour, as it were, he
was now burning the incense of that pipe of his. The ancients knew
that innocent-seeming boy for a cruel, impish knave, and they
mistrusted him. Sir Oliver either did not know or did not heed that
sound piece of ancient wisdom. It was to be borne in upon him by
grim experience, and even as his light pensive eyes smiled upon the
sunshine that flooded the terrace beyond the long mullioned window,
a shadow fell athwart it which he little dreamed to be symbolic of
the shadow that was even falling across the sunshine of his
life.</p>

<p>After that shadow came the substance&mdash;tall and gay of
raiment under a broad black Spanish hat decked with blood-red
plumes. Swinging a long beribboned cane the figure passed the
windows, stalking deliberately as Fate.</p>

<p>The smile perished on Sir Oliver's lips. His swarthy face grew
thoughtful, his black brows contracted until no more than a single
deep furrow stood between them. Then slowly the smile came forth
again, but no longer that erstwhile gentle pensive smile. It was
transformed into a smile of resolve and determination, a smile that
tightened his lips even as his brows relaxed, and invested his
brooding eyes with a gleam that was mocking, crafty and almost
wicked.</p>

<p>Came Nicholas his servant to announce Master Peter Godolphin,
and close upon the lackey's heels came Master Godolphin himself,
leaning upon his beribboned cane and carrying his broad Spanish
hat. He was a tall, slender gentleman, with a shaven, handsome
countenance, stamped with an air of haughtiness; like Sir Oliver,
he had a high-bridged, intrepid nose, and in age he was the younger
by some two or three years. He wore his auburn hair rather longer
than was the mode just then, but in his apparel there was no more
foppishness than is tolerable in a gentleman of his years.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver rose and bowed from his great height in welcome. But
a wave of tobacco-smoke took his graceful visitor in the throat and
set him coughing and grimacing.</p>

<p>"I see," he choked, "that ye have acquired that filthy
habit."</p>

<p>"I have known filthier," said Sir Oliver composedly.</p>

<p>"I nothing doubt it," rejoined Master Godolphin, thus early
giving indications of his humour and the object of his visit.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver checked an answer that must have helped his visitor
to his ends, which was no part of the knight's intent.</p>

<p>"Therefore," said he ironically, "I hope you will be patient
with my shortcomings. Nick, a chair for Master Godolphin and
another cup. I bid you welcome to Penarrow."</p>

<p>A sneer flickered over the younger man's white face. "You pay me
a compliment, sir, which I fear me 'tis not mine to return to
you."</p>

<p>"Time enough for that when I come to seek it," said Sir Oliver,
with easy, if assumed, good humour.</p>

<p>"When you come to seek it?"</p>

<p>"The hospitality of your house," Sir Oliver explained.</p>

<p>"It is on that very matter I am come to talk with you."</p>

<p>"Will you sit?" Sir Oliver invited him, and spread a hand
towards the chair which Nicholas had set. In the same gesture he
waved the servant away.</p>

<p>Master Godolphin ignored the invitation. "You were," he said,
"at Godolphin Court but yesterday, I hear." He paused, and as Sir
Oliver offered no denial, he added stiffly: "I am come, sir, to
inform you that the honour of your visits is one we shall be happy
to forgo."</p>

<p>In the effort he made to preserve his self-control before so
direct an affront Sir Oliver paled a little under his tan.</p>

<p>"You will understand, Peter," he replied slowly, "that you have
said too much unless you add something more." He paused,
considering his visitor a moment. "I do not know whether Rosamund
has told you that yesterday she did me the honour to consent to
become my wife..."</p>

<p>"She is a child that does not know her mind," broke in the
other.</p>

<p>"Do you know of any good reason why she should come to change
it?" asked Sir Oliver, with a slight air of challenge.</p>

<p>Master Godolphin sat down, crossed his legs and placed his hat
on his knee.</p>

<p>"I know a dozen," he answered. "But I need not urge them.
Sufficient should it be to remind you that Rosamund is but
seventeen and that she is under my guardianship and that of Sir
John Killigrew. Neither Sir John nor I can sanction this
betrothal."</p>

<p>"Good lack!" broke out Sir Oliver. "Who asks your sanction or
Sir John's? By God's grace your sister will grow to be a woman soon
and mistress of herself. I am in no desperate haste to get me wed,
and by nature&mdash;as you may be observing&mdash;I am a wondrous
patient man. I'll even wait," And he pulled at his pipe.</p>

<p>"Waiting cannot avail you in this, Sir Oliver. 'Tis best you
should understand. We are resolved, Sir John and I."</p>

<p>"Are you so? God's light. Send Sir John to me to tell me of his
resolves and I'll tell him something of mine. Tell him from me,
Master Godolphin, that if he will trouble to come as far as
Penarrow I'll do by him what the hangman should have done long
since. I'll crop his pimpish ears for him, by this hand!"</p>

<p>"Meanwhile," said Master Godolphin whettingly, "will you not
essay your rover's prowess upon me?"</p>

<p>"You?" quoth Sir Oliver, and looked him over with good-humoured
contempt. "I'm no butcher of fledgelings, my lad. Besides, you are
your sister's brother, and 'tis no aim of mine to increase the
obstacles already in my path." Then his tone changed. He leaned
across the table. "Come, now, Peter. What is at the root of all
this matter? Can we not compose such differences as you conceive
exist? Out with them. 'Tis no matter for Sir John. He's a
curmudgeon who signifies not a finger's snap. But you, 'tis
different. You are her brother. Out with your plaints, then. Let us
be frank and friendly."</p>

<p>"Friendly?" The other sneered again. "Our fathers set us an
example in that."</p>

<p>"Does it matter what our fathers did? More shame to them if,
being neighbours, they could not be friends. Shall we follow so
deplorable an example?"</p>

<p>"You'll not impute that the fault lay with my father," cried the
other, with a show of ready anger.</p>

<p>"I impute nothing, lad. I cry shame upon them both."</p>

<p>"'Swounds!" swore Master Peter. "Do you malign the dead?"</p>

<p>"If I do, I malign them both. But I do not. I no more than
condemn a fault that both must acknowledge could they return to
life."</p>

<p>"Then, Sir, confine your condemnings to your own father with
whom no man of honour could have lived at peace..."</p>

<p>"Softly, softly, good Sir..."</p>

<p>"There's no call to go softly. Ralph Tressilian was a dishonour,
a scandal to the countryside. Not a hamlet between here and Truro,
or between here and Helston, but swarms with big Tressilian noses
like your own, in memory of your debauched parent."</p>

<p>Sir Oliver's eyes grew narrower: he smiled. "I wonder how you
came by your own nose?" he wondered.</p>

<p>Master Godolphin got to his feet in a passion, and his chair
crashed over behind him. "Sir," he blazed, "you insult my mother's
memory!"</p>

<p>Sir Oliver laughed. "I make a little free with it, perhaps, in
return for your pleasantries on the score of my father."</p>

<p>Master Godolphin pondered him in speechless anger, then swayed
by his passion he leaned across the board, raised his long cane and
struck Sir Oliver sharply on the shoulder.</p>

<p>That done, he strode off magnificently towards the door.
Half-way thither he paused.</p>

<p>"I shall expect your friends and the length of your sword," said
he.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver laughed again. "I don't think I shall trouble to send
them," said he.</p>

<p>Master Godolphin wheeled, fully to face him again. "How? You
will take a blow?"</p>

<p>Sir Oliver shrugged. "None saw it given," said he.</p>

<p>"But I shall publish it abroad that I have caned you."</p>

<p>"You'll publish yourself a liar if you do; for none will believe
you." Then he changed his tone yet again. "Come, Peter, we are
behaving unworthily. As for the blow, I confess that I deserved it.
A man's mother is more sacred than his father. So we may cry quits
on that score. Can we not cry quits on all else? What can it profit
us to perpetuate a foolish quarrel that sprang up between our
fathers?"</p>

<p>"There is more than that between us," answered Master Godolphin.
"I'll not have my sister wed a pirate."</p>

<p>"A pirate? God's light! I am glad there's none to hear you for
since her grace has knighted me for my doings upon the seas, your
words go very near to treason. Surely, lad, what the Queen
approves, Master Peter Godolphin may approve and even your mentor
Sir John Killigrew. You've been listening to him. 'Twas he sent you
hither."</p>

<p>"I am no man's lackey," answered the other hotly, resenting the
imputation&mdash;and resenting it the more because of the truth in
it.</p>

<p>"To call me a pirate is to say a foolish thing. Hawkins with
whom I sailed has also received the accolade, and who dubs us
pirates insults the Queen herself. Apart from that, which, as you
see, is a very empty charge, what else have you against me? I am, I
hope, as good as any other here in Cornwall; Rosamund honours me
with her affection and I am rich and shall be richer still ere the
wedding bells are heard."</p>

<p>"Rich with the fruit of thieving upon the seas, rich with the
treasures of scuttled ships and the price of slaves captured in
Africa and sold to the plantations, rich as the vampire is
glutted&mdash;with the blood of dead men."</p>

<p>"Does Sir John say that?" asked Sir Oliver, in a soft deadly
voice.</p>

<p>"I say it."</p>

<p>"I heard you; but I am asking where you learnt that pretty
lesson. Is Sir John your preceptor? He is, he is. No need to tell
me. I'll deal with him. Meanwhile let me disclose to you the pure
and disinterested source of Sir John's rancour. You shall see what
an upright and honest gentleman is Sir John, who was your father's
friend and has been your guardian."</p>

<p>"I'll not listen to what you say of him."</p>

<p>"Nay, but you shall, in return for having made me listen to what
he says of me. Sir John desires to obtain a licence to build at the
mouth of the Fal. He hopes to see a town spring up above the haven
there under the shadow of his own Manor of Arwenack. He represents
himself as nobly disinterested and all concerned for the prosperity
of the country, and he neglects to mention that the land is his own
and that it is his own prosperity and that of his family which he
is concerned to foster. We met in London by a fortunate chance
whilst Sir John was about this business at the Court. Now it
happens that I, too, have interests in Truro and Penryn; but,
unlike Sir John, I am honest in the matter, and proclaim it. If any
growth should take place about Smithick it follows from its more
advantageous situation that Truro and Penryn must suffer, and that
suits me as little as the other matter would suit Sir John. I told
him so, for I can be blunt, and I told the Queen in the form of a
counter-petition to Sir John's." He shrugged. "The moment was
propitious to me. I was one of the seamen who had helped to conquer
the unconquerable Armada of King Philip. I was therefore not to be
denied, and Sir John was sent home as empty-handed as he went to
Court. D'ye marvel that he hates me? Knowing him for what he is,
d'ye marvel that he dubs me pirate and worse? 'Tis natural enough
so to misrepresent my doings upon the sea, since it is those doings
have afforded me the power to hurt his profit. He has chosen the
weapons of calumny for this combat, but those weapons are not mine,
as I shall show him this very day. If you do not credit what I say,
come with me and be present at the little talk I hope to have with
that curmudgeon."</p>

<p>"You forget," said Master Godolphin, "that I, too, have
interests in the neighbourhood of Smithick, and that you are
hurting those."</p>

<p>"Soho!" crowed Sir Oliver. "Now at last the sun of truth peeps
forth from all this cloud of righteous indignation at my bad
Tressilian blood and pirate's ways! You, too, are but a trafficker.
Now see what a fool I am to have believed you sincere, and to have
stood here in talk with you as with an honest man." His voice
swelled and his lip curled in a contempt that struck the other like
a blow. "I swear I had not wasted breath with you had I known you
for so mean and pitiful a fellow."</p>

<p>"These words..." began Master Godolphin, drawing himself up very
stiffly.</p>

<p>"Are a deal less than your deserts," cut in the other, and he
raised his voice to call&mdash;"Nick."</p>

<p>"You shall answer to them," snapped his visitor.</p>

<p>"I am answering now," was the stern answer. "To come here and
prate to me of my dead father's dissoluteness and of an ancient
quarrel between him and yours, to bleat of my trumped-up course of
piracy and my own ways of life as a just cause why I may not wed
your sister whilst the real consideration in your mind, the real
spur to your hostility is not more than the matter of some few
paltry pounds a year that I hinder you from pocketing. A God's name
get you gone."</p>

<p>Nick entered at that moment.</p>

<p>"You shall hear from me again, Sir Oliver," said the other,
white with anger. "You shall account to me for these words."</p>

<p>"I do not fight with...with hucksters," flashed Sir Oliver.</p>

<p>"D'ye dare call me that?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, 'tis to discredit an honourable class, I confess it.
Nick, the door for Master Godolphin."</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II &mdash; ROSAMUND</h2>

<p>Anon, after his visitor had departed, Sir Oliver grew calm
again. Then being able in his calm to consider his position, he
became angry anew at the very thought of the rage in which he had
been, a rage which had so mastered him that he had erected
additional obstacles to the already considerable ones that stood
between Rosamund and himself. In full blast, his anger swung round
and took Sir John Killigrew for its objective. He would settle with
him at once. He would so, by Heaven's light!</p>

<p>He bellowed for Nick and his boots.</p>

<p>"Where is Master Lionel?" he asked when the boots had been
fetched.</p>

<p>"He be just ridden in, Sir Oliver."</p>

<p>"Bid him hither."</p>

<p>Promptly, in answer to that summons, came Sir Oliver's
half-brother&mdash;a slender lad favouring his mother, the
dissolute Ralph Tressilian's second wife. He was as unlike Sir
Oliver in body as in soul. He was comely in a very gentle, almost
womanish way; his complexion was fair and delicate, his hair
golden, and his eyes of a deep blue. He had a very charming
stripling grace&mdash;for he was but in his twenty-first
year&mdash;and he dressed with all the care of a Court-gallant.</p>

<p>"Has that whelp Godolphin been to visit you?" he asked as he
entered.</p>

<p>"Aye," growled Sir Oliver. "He came to tell me some things and
to hear some others in return."</p>

<p>"Ha. I passed him just beyond the gates, and he was deaf to my
greeting. 'Tis a most cursed insufferable pup."</p>

<p>"Art a judge of men, Lal." Sir Oliver stood up booted. "I am for
Arwenack to exchange a compliment or two with Sir John."</p>

<p>His tight-pressed lips and resolute air supplemented his words
so well that Lionel clutched his arm.</p>

<p>"You're not...you're not...?"</p>

<p>"I am." And affectionately, as if to soothe the lad's obvious
alarm, he patted his brother's shoulder. "Sir John," he explained,
"talks too much. 'Tis a fault that wants correcting. I go to teach
him the virtue of silence."</p>

<p>"There will be trouble, Oliver."</p>

<p>"So there will&mdash;for him. If a man must be saying of me that
I am a pirate, a slave-dealer, a murderer, and Heaven knows what
else, he must be ready for the consequences. But you are late, Lal.
Where have you been?"</p>

<p>"I rode as far as Malpas."</p>

<p>"As far as Malpas?" Sir Oliver's eyes narrowed, as was the trick
with him. "I hear it whispered what magnet draws you thither," he
said. "Be wary, boy. You go too much to Malpas."</p>

<p>"How?" quoth Lionel a trifle coldly.</p>

<p>"I mean that you are your father's son. Remember it, and strive
not to follow in his ways lest they bring you to his own end. I
have just been reminded of these predilections of his by good
Master Peter. Go not over often to Malpas, I say. No more." But the
arm which he flung about his younger brother's shoulders and the
warmth of his embrace made resentment of his warning quite
impossible.</p>

<p>When he was gone, Lionel sat him down to dine, with Nick to wait
on him. He ate but little, and never addressed the old servant in
the course of that brief repast. He was very pensive. In thought he
followed his brother on that avenging visit of his to Arwenack.
Killigrew was no babe, but man of his hands, a soldier and a
seaman. If any harm should come to Oliver...He trembled at the
thought; and then almost despite him his mind ran on to calculate
the consequences to himself. His fortune would be in a very
different case, he refected. In a sort of horror, he sought to put
so detestable a reflection from his mind; but it returned
insistently. It would not be denied. It forced him to a
consideration of his own circumstances.</p>

<p>All that he had he owed to his brother's bounty. That dissolute
father of theirs had died as such men commonly die, leaving behind
him heavily encumbered estates and many debts; the very house of
Penarrow was mortgaged, and the moneys raised on it had been drunk,
or gambled, or spent on one or another of Ralph Tressilian's many
lights o' love. Then Oliver had sold some little property near
Helston, inherited from his mother; he had sunk the money into a
venture upon the Spanish Main. He had fitted out and manned a ship,
and had sailed with Hawkins upon one of those ventures, which Sir
John Killigrew was perfectly entitled to account pirate raids. He
had returned with enough plunder in specie and gems to disencumber
the Tressilian patrimony. He had sailed again and returned still
wealthier. And meanwhile, Lionel had remained at home taking his
ease. He loved his ease. His nature was inherently indolent, and he
had the wasteful extravagant tastes that usually go with indolence.
He was not born to toil and struggle, and none had sought to
correct the shortcomings of his character in that respect.
Sometimes he wondered what the future might hold for him should
Oliver come to marry. He feared his life might not be as easy as it
was at present. But he did not seriously fear. It was not in his
nature&mdash;it never is in the natures of such men&mdash;to give
any excess of consideration to the future. When his thoughts did
turn to it in momentary uneasiness, he would abruptly dismiss them
with the reflection that when all was said Oliver loved him, and
Oliver would never fail to provide adequately for all his
wants.</p>

<p>In this undoubtedly he was fully justified. Oliver was more
parent than brother to him. When their father had been brought home
to die from the wound dealt him by an outraged husband&mdash;and a
shocking spectacle that sinner's death had been with its hasty
terrified repentance&mdash;he had entrusted Lionel to his elder
brother's care. At the time Oliver was seventeen and Lionel twelve.
But Oliver had seemed by so many years older than his age, that the
twice-widowed Ralph Tressilian had come to depend upon this steady,
resolute, and masterful child of his first marriage. It was into
his ear that the dying man had poured the wretched tale of his
repentance for the life he had lived and the state in which he was
leaving his affairs with such scant provision for his sons. For
Oliver he had no fear. It was as if with the prescience that comes
to men in his pass he had perceived that Oliver was of those who
must prevail, a man born to make the world his oyster. His
anxieties were all for Lionel, whom he also judged with that same
penetrating insight vouchsafed a man in his last hours. Hence his
piteous recommendation of him to Oliver, and Oliver's ready promise
to be father, mother, and brother to the youngster.</p>

<p>All this was in Lionel's mind as he sat musing there, and again
he struggled with that hideous insistent thought that if things
should go ill with his brother at Arwenack, there would be great
profit to himself; that these things he now enjoyed upon another's
bounty he would then enjoy in his own right. A devil seemed to mock
him with the whispered sneer that were Oliver to die his own grief
would not be long-lived. Then in revolt against that voice of an
egoism so loathsome that in his better moments it inspired even
himself with horror, he bethought him of Oliver's unvarying,
unwavering affection; he pondered all the loving care and kindness
that through these years past Oliver had ever showered upon him;
and he cursed the rottenness of a mind that could even admit such
thoughts as those which he had been entertaining. So wrought upon
was he by the welter of his emotions, by that fierce strife between
his conscience and his egotism, that he came abruptly to his feet,
a cry upon his lips.</p>

<p>"Vade retro, Sathanas!"</p>

<p>Old Nicholas, looking up abruptly, saw the lad's face, waxen,
his brow bedewed with sweat.</p>

<p>"Master Lionel! Master Lionel!" he cried, his small bright eyes
concernedly scanning his young master's face. "What be amiss?"</p>

<p>Lionel mopped his brow. "Sir Oliver has gone to Arwenack upon a
punitive business," said he.</p>

<p>"An' what be that, zur?" quoth Nicholas.</p>

<p>"He has gone to punish Sir John for having maligned him."</p>

<p>A grin spread upon the weather-beaten countenance of
Nicholas.</p>

<p>"Be that so? Marry, 'twere time. Sir John he be over long i' th'
tongue."</p>

<p>Lionel stood amazed at the man's easy confidence and supreme
assurance of how his master must acquit himself.</p>

<p>"You...you have no fear, Nicholas..." He did not add of what.
But the servant understood, and his grin grew broader still.</p>

<p>"Fear? Lackaday! I bain't afeeard for Sir Oliver, and doan't ee
be afeeard. Sir Oliver'll be home to sup with a sharp-set
appetite&mdash;'tis the only difference fighting ever made to
he."</p>

<p>The servant was justified of his confidence by the events,
though through a slight error of judgment Sir Oliver did not quite
accomplish all that promised and intended. In anger, and when he
deemed that he had been affronted, he was&mdash;as his chronicler
never wearies of insisting, and as you shall judge before the end
of this tale is reached&mdash;of a tigerish ruthlessness. He rode
to Arwenack fully resolved to kill his calumniator. Nothing less
would satisfy him. Arrived at that fine embattled castle of the
Killigrews which commanded the entrance to the estuary of the Fal,
and from whose crenels the country might be surveyed as far as the
Lizard, fifteen miles away, he found Peter Godolphin there before
him; and because of Peter's presence Sir Oliver was more deliberate
and formal in his accusation of Sir John than he had intended. He
desired, in accusing Sir John, also to clear himself in the eyes of
Rosamund's brother, to make the latter realize how entirely odious
were the calumnies which Sir John had permitted himself, and how
basely prompted.</p>

<p>Sir John, however, came halfway to meet the quarrel. His rancour
against the Pirate of Penarrow&mdash;as he had come to dub Sir
Oliver&mdash;rendered him almost as eager to engage as was his
visitor.</p>

<p>They found a secluded corner of the deer-park for their
business, and there Sir John&mdash;a slim, sallow gentleman of some
thirty years of age&mdash;made an onslaught with sword and dagger
upon Sir Oliver, full worthy of the onslaught he had made earlier
with his tongue. But his impetuosity availed him less than nothing.
Sir Oliver was come there with a certain purpose, and it was his
way that he never failed to carry through a thing to which he set
his hand.</p>

<p>In three minutes it was all over and Sir Oliver was carefully
wiping his blade, whilst Sir John lay coughing upon the turf tended
by white-faced Peter Godolphin and a scared groom who had been
bidden thither to make up the necessary tale of witnesses.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver sheathed his weapons and resumed his coat, then came
to stand over his fallen foe, considering him critically.</p>

<p>"I think I have silenced him for a little time only," he said.
"And I confess that I intended to do better. I hope, however, that
the lesson will suffice and that he will lie no more&mdash;at least
concerning me."</p>

<p>"Do you mock a fallen man?" was Master Godolphin's angry
protest.</p>

<p>"God forbid!" said Sir Oliver soberly. "There is no mockery in
my heart. There is, believe me, nothing but regret&mdash;regret
that I should not have done the thing more thoroughly. I will send
assistance from the house as I go. Give you good day, Master
Peter."</p>

<p>From Arwenack he rode round by Penryn on his homeward way. But
he did not go straight home. He paused at the Gates of Godolphin
Court, which stood above Trefusis Point commanding the view of
Carrick Roads. He turned in under the old gateway and drew up in
the courtyard. Leaping to the kidney-stones that paved it, he
announced himself a visitor to Mistress Rosamund.</p>

<p>He found her in her bower&mdash;a light, turreted chamber on the
mansion's eastern side, with windows that looked out upon that
lovely sheet of water and the wooded slopes beyond. She was sitting
with a book in her lap in the deep of that tall window when he
entered, preceded and announced by Sally Pentreath, who, now her
tire-woman, had once been her nurse.</p>

<p>She rose with a little exclamation of gladness when he appeared
under the lintel&mdash;scarce high enough to admit him without
stooping&mdash;and stood regarding him across the room with
brightened eyes and flushing cheeks.</p>

<p>What need is there to describe her? In the blaze of notoriety
into which she was anon to be thrust by Sir Oliver Tressilian there
was scarce a poet in England who did not sing the grace and
loveliness of Rosamund Godolphin, and in all conscience enough of
those fragments have survived. Like her brother she was tawny
headed and she was divinely tall, though as yet her figure in its
girlishness was almost too slender for her height.</p>

<p>"I had not looked for you so early..." she was beginning, when
she observed that his countenance was oddly stern. "Why...what has
happened?" she cried, her intuitions clamouring loudly of some
mischance.</p>

<p>"Naught to alarm you, sweet; yet something that may vex you." He
set an arm about that lissom waist of hers above the swelling
farthingale, and gently led her back to her chair, then flung
himself upon the window-seat beside her. "You hold Sir John
Killigrew in some affection?" he said between statement and
inquiry.</p>

<p>"Why, yes. He was our guardian until my brother came of full
age."</p>

<p>Sir Oliver made a wry face. "Aye, there's the rub. Well, I've
all but killed him."</p>

<p>She drew back into her chair, recoiling before him, and he saw
horror leap to her eyes and blench her face. He made haste to
explain the causes that had led to this; he told her briefly of the
calumnies concerning him that Sir John had put about to vent his
spite at having been thwarted in a matter of his coveted licence to
build at Smithick.</p>

<p>"That mattered little," he concluded. "I knew these tales
concerning me were abroad, and I held them in the same contempt as
I hold their utterer. But he went further, Rose: he poisoned your
brother's mind against me, and he stirred up in him the slumbering
rancour that in my father's time was wont to lie between our
houses. To-day Peter came to me with the clear intent to make a
quarrel. He affronted me as no man has ever dared."</p>

<p>She cried out at that, her already great alarm redoubled. He
smiled.</p>

<p>"Do not suppose that I could harm him. He is your brother, and,
so, sacred to me. He came to tell me that no betrothal was possible
between us, forbade me ever again to visit Godolphin Court, dubbed
me pirate and vampire to my face and reviled my father's memory. I
tracked the evil of all this to its source in Killigrew, and rode
straight to Arwenack to dam that source of falsehood for all time.
I did not accomplish quite so much as I intended. You see, I am
frank, my Rose. It may be that Sir John will live; if so I hope
that he may profit by this lesson. I have come straight to you," he
concluded, "that you may hear the tale from me before another comes
to malign me with false stories of this happening."</p>

<p>"You...you mean Peter?" she cried.</p>

<p>"Alas!" he sighed.</p>

<p>She sat very still and white, looking straight before her and
not at all at Sir Oliver. At length she spoke.</p>

<p>"I am not skilled in reading men," she said in a sad, small
voice. "How should I be, that am but a maid who has led a
cloistered life. I was told of you that you were violent and
passionate, a man of bitter enmities, easily stirred to hatreds,
cruel and ruthless in the persecution of them."</p>

<p>"You, too, have been listening to Sir John," he muttered, and
laughed shortly.</p>

<p>"All this was I told," she pursued as if he had not spoken, "and
all did I refuse to believe because my heart was given to you.
Yet...yet of what have you made proof to-day?"</p>

<p>"Of forbearance," said he shortly.</p>

<p>"Forbearance?" she echoed, and her lips writhed in a smile of
weary irony. "Surely you mock me!"</p>

<p>He set himself to explain.</p>

<p>"I have told you what Sir John had done. I have told you that
the greater part of it&mdash;and matter all that touched my
honour&mdash;I know Sir John to have done long since. Yet I
suffered it in silence and contempt. Was that to show myself easily
stirred to ruthlessness? What was it but forbearance? When,
however, he carries his petty huckster's rancour so far as to seek
to choke for me my source of happiness in life and sends your
brother to affront me, I am still so forbearing that I recognize
your brother to be no more than a tool and go straight to the hand
that wielded him. Because I know of your affection for Sir John I
gave him such latitude as no man of honour in England would have
given him."</p>

<p>Then seeing that she still avoided his regard, still sat in that
frozen attitude of horror at learning that the man she loved had
imbrued his hands with the blood of another whom she also loved,
his pleading quickened to a warmer note. He flung himself upon his
knees beside her chair, and took in his great sinewy hands the
slender fingers which she listlessly surrendered. "Rose," he cried,
and his deep voice quivered with intercession, "dismiss all that
you have heard from out your mind. Consider only this thing that
has befallen. Suppose that Lionel my brother came to you, and that,
having some measure of power and authority to support him, he swore
to you that you should never wed me, swore to prevent this marriage
because he deemed you such a woman as could not bear my name with
honour to myself; and suppose that to all this he added insult to
the memory of your dead father, what answer would you return him?
Speak, Rose! Be honest with thyself and me. Deem yourself in my
place, and say in honesty if you can still condemn me for what I
have done. Say if it differs much from what you would wish to do in
such a case as I have named."</p>

<p>Her eyes scanned now his upturned face, every line of which was
pleading to her and calling for impartial judgment. Her face grew
troubled, and then almost fierce. She set her hands upon his
shoulders, and looked deep into his eyes.</p>

<p>"You swear to me, Noll, that all is as you have told it
me&mdash;you have added naught, you have altered naught to make the
tale more favourable to yourself?"</p>

<p>"You need such oaths from me?" he asked, and she saw sorrow
spread upon his countenance.</p>

<p>"If I did I should not love thee, Noll. But in such an hour I
need your own assurance. Will you not be generous and bear with me,
strengthen me to withstand anything that may be said
hereafter?"</p>

<p>"As God's my witness, I have told you true in all," he answered
solemnly.</p>

<p>She sank her head to his shoulder. She was weeping softly,
overwrought by this climax to all that in silence and in secret she
had suffered since he had come a-wooing her.</p>

<p>"Then," she said, "I believe you acted rightly. I believe with
you that no man of honour could have acted otherwise. I must
believe you, Noll, for did I not, then I could believe in naught
and hope for naught. You are as a fire that has seized upon the
better part of me and consumed it all to ashes that you may hold it
in your heart. I am content so you be true."</p>

<p>"True I shall ever be, sweetheart," he whispered fervently.
"Could I be less since you are sent to make me so?"</p>

<p>She looked at him again, and now she was smiling wistfully
through her tears.</p>

<p>"And you will bear with Peter?" she implored him.</p>

<p>"He shall have no power to anger me," he answered. "I swear that
too. Do you know that but to-day he struck me?"</p>

<p>"Struck you? You did not tell me that!"</p>

<p>"My quarrel was not with him but with the rogue that sent him. I
laughed at the blow. Was he not sacred to me?"</p>

<p>"He is good at heart, Noll," she pursued. "In time he will come
to love you as you deserve, and you will come to know that he, too,
deserves your love."</p>

<p>"He deserves it now for the love he bears to you."</p>

<p>"And you will think ever thus during the little while of waiting
that perforce must lie before us?"</p>

<p>"I shall never think otherwise, sweet. Meanwhile I shall avoid
him, and that no harm may come should he forbid me Godolphin Court
I'll even stay away. In less than a year you will be of full age,
and none may hinder you to come and go. What is a year, with such
hope as mine to still impatience?"</p>

<p>She stroked his face. "Art very gentle with me ever, Noll," she
murmured fondly. "I cannot credit you are ever harsh to any, as
they say."</p>

<p>"Heed them not," he answered her. "I may have been something of
all that, but you have purified me, Rose. What man that loved you
could be aught but gentle." He kissed her, and stood up. "I had
best be going now," he said. "I shall walk along the shore towards
Trefusis Point to-morrow morning. If you should chance to be
similarly disposed..."</p>

<p>She laughed, and rose in her turn. "I shall be there, dear
Noll."</p>

<p>"'Twere best so hereafter," he assured her, smiling, and so took
his leave.</p>

<p>She followed him to the stair-head, and watched him as he
descended with eyes that took pride in the fine upright carriage of
that stalwart, masterful lover.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III &mdash; THE FORGE</h2>

<p>Sir Oliver's wisdom in being the first to bear Rosamund the
story of that day's happenings was established anon when Master
Godolphin returned home. He went straight in quest of his sister;
and in a frame of mind oppressed by fear and sorrow for Sir John,
by his general sense of discomfiture at the hands of Sir Oliver,
and by the anger begotten of all this, he was harsh in manner and
disposed to hector.</p>

<p>"Madam," he announced abruptly, "Sir John is like to die."</p>

<p>The astounding answer she returned him&mdash;that is, astounding
to him&mdash;did not tend to soothe his sorely ruffled spirit.</p>

<p>"I know," she said. "And I believe him to deserve no less. Who
deals in calumny should be prepared for the wages of it."</p>

<p>He stared at her in a long, furious silence, then exploded into
oaths, and finally inveighed against her unnaturalness and
pronounced her bewitched by that foul dog Tressilian.</p>

<p>"It is fortunate for me," she answered him composedly, "that he
was here before you to give me the truth of this affair." Then her
assumed calm and the anger with which she had met his own all fell
away from her. "Oh, Peter, Peter," she cried in anguish, "I hope
that Sir John will recover. I am distraught by this event. But be
just, I implore you. Sir Oliver has told me how hard-driven he had
been."</p>

<p>"He shall be driven harder yet, as God's my life! If you think
this deed shall go unpunished..."</p>

<p>She flung herself upon his breast and implored him to carry this
quarrel no further. She spoke of her love for Sir Oliver and
announced her firm resolve to marry him in despite of all
opposition that could be made, all of which did not tend to soften
her brother's humour. Yet because of the love that ever had held
these two in closest bonds he went so far in the end as to say that
should Sir John recover he would not himself pursue the matter
further. But if Sir John should die&mdash;as was very
likely&mdash;honour compelled him to seek vengeance of a deed to
which he had himself so very largely contributed.</p>

<p>"I read that man as if he were an open book," the boy announced,
with callow boastfulness. "He has the subtlety of Satan, yet he
does not delude me. It was at me he struck through Killigrew.
Because he desires you, Rosamund, he could not&mdash;as he bluntly
told me&mdash;deal with me however I provoked him, not even though
I went the length of striking him. He might have killed me for't;
but he knew that to do so would place a barrier 'twixt him and you.
Oh! he is calculating as all the fiends of Hell. So, to wipe out
the dishonour which I did him, he shifts the blame of it upon
Killigrew and goes out to kill him, which he further thinks may act
as a warning to me. But if Killigrew dies..." And thus he rambled
on, filling her gentle heart with anguish to see this feud
increasing between the two men she loved best in all the world. If
the outcome of it should be that either were to kill the other, she
knew that she could never again look upon the survivor.</p>

<p>She took heart at last in the memory of Sir Oliver's sworn
promise that her brother's life should be inviolate to him, betide
what might. She trusted him; she depended upon his word and that
rare strength of his which rendered possible to him a course that
no weaker man would dare pursue. And in this reflection her pride
in him increased, and she thanked God for a lover who in all things
was a giant among men.</p>

<p>But Sir John Killigrew did not die. He hovered between this
world and a better one for some seven days, at the end of which he
began to recover. By October he was abroad again, gaunt and pale,
reduced to half the bulk that had been his before, a mere shadow of
a man.</p>

<p>One of his first visits was to Godolphin Court. He went to
remonstrate with Rosamund upon her betrothal, and he did so at the
request of her brother. But his remonstrances were strangely
lacking in the force that she had looked for.</p>

<p>The odd fact is that in his near approach to death, and with his
earthly interest dwindling, Sir John had looked matters frankly in
the face, and had been driven to the conclusion&mdash;a conclusion
impossible to him in normal health&mdash;that he had got no more
than he deserved. He realized that he had acted unworthily, if
unconscious at the time of the unworthiness of what he did; that
the weapons with which he had fought Sir Oliver were not the
weapons that become a Gentleman or in which there is credit to be
won. He perceived that he had permitted his old enmity for the
house of Tressilian, swollen by a sense of injury lately suffered
in the matter of the licence to build at Smithick, to warp his
judgment and to persuade him that Sir Oliver was all he had dubbed
him. He realized that jealousy, too, had taken a hand in the
matter. Sir Oliver's exploits upon the seas had brought him wealth,
and with this wealth he was building up once more the Tressilian
sway in those parts, which Ralph Tressilian had so outrageously
diminished, so that he threatened to eclipse the importance of the
Killigrews of Arwenack.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in the hour of reaction he did not go so far as to
admit that Sir Oliver Tressilian was a fit mate for Rosamund
Godolphin. She and her brother had been placed in his care by their
late father, and he had nobly discharged his tutelage until such
time as Peter had come to full age. His affection for Rosamund was
tender as that of a lover, but tempered by a feeling entirely
paternal. He went very near to worshipping her, and when all was
said, when he had cleared his mind of all dishonest bias, he still
found overmuch to dislike in Oliver Tressilian, and the notion of
his becoming Rosamund's husband was repellent.</p>

<p>First of all there was that bad Tressilian
blood&mdash;notoriously bad, and never more flagrantly displayed
than in the case of the late Ralph Tressilian. It was impossible
that Oliver should have escaped the taint of it; nor could Sir John
perceive any signs that he had done so. He displayed the
traditional Tressilian turbulence. He was passionate and brutal,
and the pirate's trade to which he had now set his hand was of all
trades the one for which he was by nature best equipped. He was
harsh and overbearing, impatient of correction and prone to trample
other men's feelings underfoot. Was this, he asked himself in all
honesty, a mate for Rosamund? Could he entrust her happiness to the
care of such a man? Assuredly he could not.</p>

<p>Therefore, being whole again, he went to remonstrate with her as
he accounted it his duty and as Master Peter had besought him. Yet
knowing the bias that had been his he was careful to understate
rather than to overstate his reasons.</p>

<p>"But, Sir John," she protested, "if every man is to be condemned
for the sins of his forbears, but few could escape condemnation,
and wherever shall you find me a husband deserving your
approval?"</p>

<p>"His father..." began Sir John.</p>

<p>"Tell me not of his father, but of himself," she
interrupted.</p>

<p>He frowned impatiently&mdash;they were sitting in that bower of
hers above the river.</p>

<p>"I was coming to 't," he answered, a thought testily, for these
interruptions which made him keep to the point robbed him of his
best arguments. "However, suffice it that many of his father's
vicious qualities he has inherited, as we see in his ways of life;
that he has not inherited others only the future can assure
us."</p>

<p>"In other words," she mocked him, yet very seriously, "I am to
wait until he dies of old age to make quite sure that he has no
such sins as must render him an unfitting husband?"</p>

<p>"No, no," he cried. "Good lack! what a perverseness is
thine!"</p>

<p>"The perverseness is your own, Sir John. I am but the mirror of
it."</p>

<p>He shifted in his chair and grunted. "Be it so, then," he
snapped. "We will deal with the qualities that already he
displays." And Sir John enumerated them.</p>

<p>"But this is no more than your judgment of him&mdash;no more
than what you think him."</p>

<p>"'Tis what all the world thinks him."</p>

<p>"But I shall not marry a man for what others think of him, but
for what I think of him myself. And in my view you cruelly malign
him. I discover no such qualities in Sir Oliver."</p>

<p>"'Tis that you should be spared such a discovery that I am
beseeching you not to wed him."</p>

<p>"Yet unless I wed him I shall never make such a discovery; and
until I make it I shall ever continue to love him and to desire to
wed him. Is all my life to be spent so?" She laughed outright, and
came to stand beside him. She put an arm about his neck as she
might have put it about the neck of her father, as she had been in
the habit of doing any day in these past ten years&mdash;and
thereby made him feel himself to have reached an unconscionable
age. With her hand she rubbed his brow.</p>

<p>"Why, here are wicked wrinkles of ill-humour," she cried to him.
"You are all undone, and by a woman's wit, and you do not like
it."</p>

<p>"I am undone by a woman's wilfulness, by a woman's headstrong
resolve not to see."</p>

<p>"You have naught to show me, Sir John."</p>

<p>"Naught? Is all that I have said naught?"</p>

<p>"Words are not things; judgments are not facts. You say that he
is so, and so and so. But when I ask you upon what facts you judge
him, your only answer is that you think him to be what you say he
is. Your thoughts may be honest, Sir John, but your logic is
contemptible." And she laughed again at his gaping discomfiture.
"Come, now, deal like an honest upright judge, and tell me one act
of his&mdash;one thing that he has ever done and of which you have
sure knowledge&mdash;that will bear him out to be what you say he
is. Now, Sir John!"</p>

<p>He looked up at her impatiently. Then, at last he smiled.</p>

<p>"Rogue!" he cried&mdash;and upon a distant day he was to bethink
him of those words. "If ever he be brought to judgment I can desire
him no better advocate than thou."</p>

<p>Thereupon following up her advantage swiftly, she kissed him.
"Nor could I desire him a more honest judge than you."</p>

<p>What was the poor man to do thereafter? What he did. Live up to
her pronouncement, and go forthwith to visit Sir Oliver and compose
their quarrel.</p>

<p>The acknowledgment of his fault was handsomely made, and Sir
Oliver received it in a spirit no less handsome. But when Sir John
came to the matter of Mistress Rosamund he was, out of his sense of
duty to her, less generous. He announced that since he could not
bring himself to look upon Sir Oliver as a suitable husband for
her, nothing that he had now said must mislead Sir Oliver into
supposing him a consenting party to any such union.</p>

<p>"But that," he added, "is not to say that I oppose it. I
disapprove, but I stand aside. Until she is of full age her brother
will refuse his sanction. After that, the matter will concern
neither him nor myself."</p>

<p>"I hope," said Sir Oliver, "he will take as wise a view. But
whatever view he takes will be no matter. For the rest, Sir John, I
thank you for your frankness, and I rejoice to know that if I may
not count you for my friend, at least I need not reckon you among
my enemies."</p>

<p>But if Sir John was thus won round to a neutral attitude, Master
Peter's rancour abated nothing; rather it increased each day, and
presently there came another matter to feed it, a matter of which
Sir Oliver had no suspicion.</p>

<p>He knew that his brother Lionel rode almost daily to Malpas, and
he knew the object of those daily rides. He knew of the lady who
kept a sort of court there for the rustic bucks of Truro, Penryn,
and Helston, and he knew something of the ill-repute that had
attached to her in town&mdash;a repute, in fact, which had been the
cause of her withdrawal into the country. He told his brother some
frank and ugly truths, concerning her, by way of warning him, and
therein, for the first time, the twain went very near to
quarrelling.</p>

<p>After that he mentioned her no more. He knew that in his
indolent way Lionel could be headstrong, and he knew human nature
well enough to be convinced that interference here would but set up
a breach between himself and his brother without in the least
achieving its real object. So Oliver shrugged resignedly, and held
his peace.</p>

<p>There he left the affair, nor ever spoke again of Malpas and the
siren who presided there. And meanwhile the autumn faded into
winter, and with the coming of stormy weather Sir Oliver and
Rosamund had fewer opportunities of meeting. To Godolphin Court he
would not go since she did not desire it; and himself he deemed it
best to remain away since otherwise he must risk a quarrel with its
master, who had forbidden him the place. In those days he saw Peter
Godolphin but little, and on the rare occasions when they did meet
they passed each other with a very meagre salute.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver was entirely happy, and men noticed how gentler were
his accents, how sunnier had become a countenance that they had
known for haughty and forbidding. He waited for his coming
happiness with the confidence of an immortal in the future.
Patience was all the service Fate asked of him, and he gave that
service blithely, depending upon the reward that soon now would be
his own. Indeed, the year drew near its close; and ere another
winter should come round Penarrow House would own a mistress. That
to him seemed as inevitable as the season itself. And yet for all
his supreme confidence, for all his patience and the happiness he
culled from it, there were moments when he seemed oppressed by some
elusive sense of overhanging doom, by some subconsciousness of an
evil in the womb of Destiny. Did he challenge his oppression, did
he seek to translate it into terms of reason, he found nothing upon
which his wits could fasten&mdash;and he came ever to conclude that
it was his very happiness by its excessiveness that was oppressing
him, giving him at times that sense of premonitory weight about the
heart as if to check its joyous soarings.</p>

<p>One day, a week from Christmas, he had occasion to ride to
Helston on some trifling affair. For half a week a blizzard had
whirled about the coast, and he had been kept chafing indoors what
time layer upon layer of snow was spread upon the countryside. On
the fourth day, the storm being spent, the sun came forth, the
skies were swept clear of clouds and all the countryside lay robed
in a sun-drenched, dazzling whiteness. Sir Oliver called for his
horse and rode forth alone through the crisp snow. He turned
homeward very early in the afternoon, but when a couple of miles
from Helston he found that his horse had cast a shoe. He
dismounted, and bridle over arm tramped on through the sunlit vale
between the heights of Pendennis and Arwenack, singing as he went.
He came thus to Smithick and the door of the forge. About it stood
a group of fishermen and rustics, for, in the absence of any inn
just there, this forge was ever a point of congregation. In
addition to the rustics and an itinerant merchant with his
pack-horses, there were present Sir Andrew Flack, the parson from
Penryn, and Master Gregory Baine, one of the Justices from the
neighbourhood of Truro. Both were well known to Sir Oliver, and he
stood in friendly gossip with them what time he waited for his
horse.</p>

<p>It was all very unfortunate, from the casting of that shoe to
the meeting with those gentlemen; for as Sir Oliver stood there,
down the gentle slope from Arwenack rode Master Peter
Godolphin.</p>

<p>It was said afterwards by Sir Andrew and Master Baine that
Master Peter appeared to have been carousing, so flushed was his
face, so unnatural the brightness of his eye, so thick his speech
and so extravagant and foolish what he said. There can be little
doubt that it was so. He was addicted to Canary, and so indeed was
Sir John Killigrew, and he had been dining with Sir John. He was of
those who turn quarrelsome in wine&mdash;which is but another way
of saying that when the wine was in and the restraint out, his
natural humour came uppermost untrammelled. The sight of Sir Oliver
standing there gave the lad precisely what he needed to indulge
that evil humour of his, and he may have been quickened in his
purpose by the presence of those other gentlemen. In his
half-fuddled state of mind he may have recalled that once he had
struck Sir Oliver and Sir Oliver had laughed and told him that none
would believe it.</p>

<p>He drew rein suddenly as he came abreast of the group, so
suddenly that he pulled his horse until it almost sat down like a
cat; yet he retained his saddle. Then he came through the snow that
was all squelched and mudded just about the forge, and leered at
Sir Oliver.</p>

<p>"I am from Arwenack," he announced unnecessarily. "We have been
talking of you."</p>

<p>"You could have had no better subject of discourse," said Sir
Oliver, smiling, for all that his eyes were hard and something
scared&mdash;though his fears did not concern himself.</p>

<p>"Marry, you are right; you make an engrossing topic&mdash;you
and your debauched father."</p>

<p>"Sir," replied Sir Oliver, "once already have I deplored your
mother's utter want of discretion."</p>

<p>The words were out of him in a flash under the spur of the gross
insult flung at him, uttered in the momentary blind rage aroused by
that inflamed and taunting face above him. No sooner were they sped
than he repented them, the more bitterly because they were greeted
by a guffaw from the rustics. He would have given half his fortune
in that moment to have recalled them.</p>

<p>Master Godolphin's face had changed as utterly as if he had
removed a mask. From flushed that it had been it was livid now and
the eyes were blazing, the mouth twitching. Thus a moment he
glowered upon his enemy. Then standing in his stirrups he swung
aloft his whip.</p>

<p>"You dog!" he cried, in a snarling sob. "You dog!" And his lash
came down and cut a long red wheal across Sir Oliver's dark
face.</p>

<p>With cries of dismay and anger the others, the parson, the
Justice and the rustics got between the pair, for Sir Oliver was
looking very wicked, and all the world knew him for a man to be
feared.</p>

<p>"Master Godolphin, I cry shame upon you," exclaimed the parson.
"If evil comes of this I shall testify to the grossness of your
aggression. Get you gone from here!"</p>

<p>"Go to the devil, sir," said Master Godolphin thickly. "Is my
mother's name to be upon the lips of that bastard? By God, man, the
matter rests not here. He shall send his friends to me, or I will
horse-whip him every time we meet. You hear, Sir Oliver?"</p>

<p>Sir Oliver made him no reply.</p>

<p>"You hear?" he roared. "There is no Sir John Killigrew this time
upon whom you can shift the quarrel. Come you to me and get the
punishment of which that whiplash is but an earnest." Then with a
thick laugh he drove spurs into his horse's flanks, so furiously
that he all but sent the parson and another sprawling.</p>

<p>"Stay but a little while for me," roared Sir Oliver after him.
"You'll ride no more, my drunken fool!"</p>

<p>And in a rage he bellowed for his horse, flinging off the parson
and Master Baine, who endeavoured to detain and calm him. He
vaulted to the saddle when the nag was brought him, and whirled
away in furious pursuit.</p>

<p>The parson looked at the Justice and the Justice shrugged, his
lips tight-pressed.</p>

<p>"The young fool is drunk," said Sir Andrew, shaking his white
head. "He's in no case to meet his Maker."</p>

<p>"Yet he seems very eager," quoth Master Justice Baine. "I doubt
I shall hear more of the matter." He turned and looked into the
forge where the bellows now stood idle, the smith himself grimy and
aproned in leather in the doorway, listening to the rustics account
of the happening. Master Baine it seems had a taste for analogies.
"Faith," he said, "the place was excellently well chosen. They have
forged here to-day a sword which it will need blood to temper."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV &mdash; THE
INTERVENER</h2>

<p>The parson had notions of riding after Sir Oliver, and begged
Master Baine to join him. But the Justice looked down his long nose
and opined that no good purpose was to be served; that Tressilians
were ever wild and bloody men; and that an angry Tressilian was a
thing to be avoided. Sir Andrew, who was far from valorous, thought
there might be wisdom in the Justice's words, and remembered that
he had troubles enough of his own with a froward wife without
taking up the burdens of others. Master Godolphin and Sir Oliver
between them, quoth the justice, had got up this storm of theirs. A
God's name let them settle it, and if in the settling they should
cut each other's throats haply the countryside would be well rid of
a brace of turbulent fellows. The pedlar deemed them a couple of
madmen, whose ways were beyond the understanding of a sober
citizen. The others&mdash;the fishermen and the rustics&mdash;had
not the means to follow even had they had the will.</p>

<p>They dispersed to put abroad the news of that short furious
quarrel and to prophesy that blood would be let in the adjusting of
it. This prognostication they based entirely upon their knowledge
of the short Tressilian way. But it was a matter in which they were
entirely wrong. It is true that Sir Oliver went galloping along
that road that follows the Penryn river and that he pounded over
the bridge in the town of Penryn in Master Godolphin's wake with
murder in his heart. Men who saw him riding wildly thus with the
red wheal across his white furious face said that he looked a very
devil.</p>

<p>He crossed the bridge at Penryn a half-hour after sunset, as
dusk was closing into night, and it may be that the sharp, frosty
air had a hand in the cooling of his blood. For as he reached the
river's eastern bank he slackened his breakneck pace, even as he
slackened the angry galloping of his thoughts. The memory of that
oath he had sworn three months ago to Rosamund smote him like a
physical blow. It checked his purpose, and, reflecting this, his
pace fell to an amble. He shivered to think how near he had gone to
wrecking all the happiness that lay ahead of him. What was a boy's
whiplash, that his resentment of it should set all his future life
in jeopardy? Even though men should call him a coward for
submitting to it and leaving the insult unavenged, what should that
matter? Moreover, upon the body of him who did so proclaim him he
could brand the lie of a charge so foolish. Sir Oliver raised his
eyes to the deep sapphire dome of heaven where an odd star was
glittering frostily, and thanked God from a swelling heart that he
had not overtaken Peter Godolphin whilst his madness was upon
him.</p>

<p>A mile or so below Penryn, he turned up the road that ran down
to the ferry there, and took his way home over the shoulder of the
hill with a slack rein. It was not his usual way. He was wont ever
to go round by Trefusis Point that he might take a glimpse at the
walls of the house that harboured Rosamund and a glance at the
window of her bower. But to-night he thought the shorter road over
the hill would be the safer way. If he went by Godolphin Court he
might chance to meet Peter again, and his past anger warned him
against courting such a meeting, warned him to avoid it lest evil
should betide. Indeed, so imperious was the warning, and such were
his fears of himself after what had just passed, that he resolved
to leave Penarrow on the next day. Whither he would go he did not
then determine. He might repair to London, and he might even go
upon another cruise&mdash;an idea which he had lately dismissed
under Rosamund's earnest intercession. But it was imperative that
he should quit the neighbourhood, and place a distance between
Peter Godolphin and himself until such time as he might take
Rosamund to wife. Eight months or so of exile; but what matter?
Better so than that he should be driven into some deed that would
compel him to spend his whole lifetime apart from her. He would
write, and she would understand and approve when he told her what
had passed that day.</p>

<p>The resolve was firmly implanted in him by the time he reached
Penarrow, and he felt himself uplifted by it and by the promise it
afforded him that thus his future happiness would be assured.</p>

<p>Himself he stabled his horse; for of the two grooms he kept, one
had by his leave set out yesterday to spend Christmas in Devon with
his parents, the other had taken a chill and had been ordered to
bed that very day by Sir Oliver, who was considerate with those
that served him. In the dining-room he found supper spread, and a
great log fire blazed in the enormous cowled fire-place, diffusing
a pleasant warmth through the vast room and flickering ruddily upon
the trophies of weapons that adorned the walls, upon the tapestries
and the portraits of dead Tressilians. Hearing his step, old
Nicholas entered bearing a great candle-branch which he set upon
the table.</p>

<p>"You'm late, Sir Oliver," said the servant, "and Master Lionel
bain't home yet neither."</p>

<p>Sir Oliver grunted and scowled as he crunched a log and set it
sizzling under his wet heel. He thought of Malpas and cursed
Lionel's folly, as, without a word, he loosed his cloak and flung
it on an oaken coffer by the wall where already he had cast his
hat. Then he sat down, and Nicholas came forward to draw off his
boots.</p>

<p>When that was done and the old servant stood up again, Sir
Oliver shortly bade him to serve supper.</p>

<p>"Master Lionel cannot be long now," said he. "And give me to
drink, Nick. 'Tis what I most require."</p>

<p>"I've brewed ee a posset o' canary sack," announced Nicholas;
"there'm no better supping o' a frosty winter's night, Sir
Oliver."</p>

<p>He departed to return presently with a black jack that was
steaming fragrantly. He found his master still in the same
attitude, staring at the fire, and frowning darkly. Sir Oliver's
thoughts were still of his brother and Malpas, and so insistent
were they that his own concerns were for the moment quite
neglected; he was considering whether it was not his duty, after
all, to attempt a word of remonstrance. At length he rose with a
sigh and got to table. There he bethought him of his sick groom,
and asked Nicholas for news of him. Nicholas reported the fellow to
be much as he had been, whereupon Sir Oliver took up a cup and
brimmed it with the steaming posset.</p>

<p>"Take him that," he said. "There's no better medicine for such
an ailment."</p>

<p>Outside fell a clatter of hooves.</p>

<p>"Here be Master Lionel at last," said the servant.</p>

<p>"No doubt," agreed Sir Oliver. "No need to stay for him. Here is
all he needs. Carry that to Tom ere it cools."</p>

<p>It was his object to procure the servant's absence when Lionel
should arrive, resolved as he was to greet him with a sound rating
for his folly. Reflection had brought him the assurance that this
was become his duty in view of his projected absence from Penarrow;
and in his brother's interest he was determined not to spare
him.</p>

<p>He took a deep draught of the posset, and as he set it down he
heard Lionel's step without. Then the door was flung open, and his
brother stood on the threshold a moment at gaze.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver looked round with a scowl, the well-considered
reproof already on his lips.</p>

<p>"So..." he began, and got no further. The sight that met his
eyes drove the ready words from his lips and mind; instead it was
with a sharp gasp of dismay that he came immediately to his feet.
"Lionel!"</p>

<p>Lionel lurched in, closed the door, and shot home one of its
bolts. Then he leaned against it, facing his brother again. He was
deathly pale, with great dark stains under his eyes; his ungloved
right hand was pressed to his side, and the fingers of it were all
smeared with blood that was still oozing and dripping from between
them. Over his yellow doublet on the right side there was a
spreading dark stain whose nature did not intrigue Sir Oliver a
moment.</p>

<p>"My God!" he cried, and ran to his brother. "What's happened,
Lal? Who has done this?"</p>

<p>"Peter Godolphin," came the answer from lips that writhed in a
curious smile.</p>

<p>Never a word said Sir Oliver, but he set his teeth and clenched
his hands until the nails cut into his palms. Then he put an arm
about this lad he loved above all save one in the whole world, and
with anguish in his mind he supported him forward to the fire.
There Lionel dropped to the chair that Sir Oliver had lately
occupied.</p>

<p>"What is your hurt, lad? Has it gone deep?" he asked, in terror
almost.</p>

<p>"'Tis naught&mdash;a flesh wound; but I have lost a mort of
blood. I thought I should have been drained or ever I got me
home."</p>

<p>With fearful speed Sir Oliver drew his dagger and ripped away
doublet, vest, and shirt, laying bare the lad's white flesh. A
moment's examination, and he breathed more freely.</p>

<p>"Art a very babe, Lal," he cried in his relief. "To ride without
thought to stanch so simple a wound, and so lose all this
blood&mdash;bad Tressilian blood though it be." He laughed in the
immensity of his reaction from that momentary terror. "Stay thou
there whilst I call Nick to help us dress this scratch."</p>

<p>"No, no!" There was note of sudden fear in the lad's voice, and
his hand clutched at his brother's sleeve. "Nick must not know.
None must know, or I am undone else."</p>

<p>Sir Oliver stared, bewildered. Lionel smiled again that curious
twisted, rather frightened smile.</p>

<p>"I gave better than I took, Noll," said he. "Master Godolphin is
as cold by now as the snow on which I left him."</p>

<p>His brother's sudden start and the fixed stare from out of his
slowly paling face scared Lionel a little. He observed, almost
subconsciously, the dull red wheal that came into prominence as the
colour faded out of Sir Oliver's face, yet never thought to ask how
it came there. His own affairs possessed him too completely.</p>

<p>"What's this?" quoth Oliver at last, hoarsely.</p>

<p>Lionel dropped his eyes, unable longer to meet a glance that was
becoming terrible.</p>

<p>"He would have it," he growled almost sullenly, answering the
reproach that was written in every line of his brother's taut body.
"I had warned him not to cross my path. But to-night I think some
madness had seized upon him. He affronted me, Noll; he said things
which it was beyond human power to endure, and..." He shrugged to
complete his sentence.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Oliver in a small voice. "First let us tend
this wound of yours."</p>

<p>"Do not call Nick," was the other's swift admonition. "Don't you
see, Noll?" he explained in answer to the inquiry of his brother's
stare, "don't you see that we fought there almost in the dark and
without witnesses. It..." he swallowed, "it will be called murder,
fair fight though it was; and should it be discovered that it was
I..." He shivered and his glance grew wild; his lips twitched.</p>

<p>"I see," said Oliver, who understood at last, and he added
bitterly: "You fool!"</p>

<p>"I had no choice," protested Lionel. "He came at me with his
drawn sword. Indeed, I think he was half-drunk. I warned him of
what must happen to the other did either of us fall, but he bade me
not concern myself with the fear of any such consequences to
himself. He was full of foul words of me and you and all whoever
bore our name. He struck me with the flat of his blade and
threatened to run me through as I stood unless I drew to defend
myself. What choice had I? I did not mean to kill him&mdash;as
God's my witness, I did not, Noll."</p>

<p>Without a word Oliver turned to a side-table, where stood a
metal basin and ewer. He poured water, then came in the same
silence to treat his brother's wound. The tale that Lionel told
made blame impossible, at least from Oliver. He had but to recall
the mood in which he himself had ridden after Peter Godolphin; he
had but to remember, that only the consideration of
Rosamund&mdash;only, indeed, the consideration of his
future&mdash;had set a curb upon his own bloodthirsty humour.</p>

<p>When he had washed the wound he fetched some table linen from a
press and ripped it into strips with his dagger; he threaded out
one of these and made a preliminary crisscross of the threads
across the lips of the wound&mdash;for the blade had gone right
through the muscles of the breast, grazing the ribs; these threads
would help the formation of a clot. Then with the infinite skill
and cunning acquired in the course of his rovings he proceeded to
the bandaging.</p>

<p>That done, he opened the window and flung out the blood-tinted
water. The cloths with which he had mopped the wound and all other
similar evidences of the treatment he cast upon the fire. He must
remove all traces even from the eyes of Nicholas. He had the most
implicit trust in the old servant's fidelity. But the matter was
too grave to permit of the slightest risk. He realized fully the
justice of Lionel's fears that however fair the fight might have
been, a thing done thus in secret must be accounted murder by the
law.</p>

<p>Bidding Lionel wrap himself in his cloak, Sir Oliver unbarred
the door, and went upstairs in quest of a fresh shirt and doublet
for his brother. On the landing he met Nicholas descending. He held
him a moment in talk of the sick man above, and outwardly at least
he was now entirely composed. He dispatched him upstairs again upon
a trumped-up errand that must keep him absent for some little time,
whilst himself he went to get the things he needed.</p>

<p>He returned below with them, and when he had assisted his
brother into fresh garments with as little movement as possible so
as not to disturb his dressing of the wound or set it bleeding
afresh, he took the blood-stained doublet, vest, and shirt which he
had ripped and flung them, too, into the great fire.</p>

<p>When some moments later Nicholas entered the vast room he found
the brothers sitting composedly at table. Had he faced Lionel he
would have observed little amiss with him beyond the deep pallor of
his face. But he did not even do so much. Lionel sat with his back
to the door and the servant's advance into the room was checked by
Sir Oliver with the assurance that they did not require him.
Nicholas withdrew again, and the brothers were once more alone.</p>

<p>Lionel ate very sparingly. He thirsted and would have emptied
the measure of posset, but that Sir Oliver restrained him, and
refused him anything but water lest he should contract a fever.
Such a sparing meal as they made&mdash;for neither had much
appetite&mdash;was made in silence. At last Sir Oliver rose, and
with slow, heavy steps, suggestive of his humour, he crossed to the
fire-place. He threw fresh logs on the blaze, and took from the
tall mantelshelf his pipe and a leaden jar of tobacco. He filled
the pipe pensively, then with the short iron tongs seized a
fragment of glowing wood and applied it to the herb.</p>

<p>He returned to the table, and standing over his brother, he
broke at last the silence that had now endured some time.</p>

<p>"What," he asked gruffly, "was the cause of your quarrel?"</p>

<p>Lionel started and shrank a little; between finger and thumb he
kneaded a fragment of bread, his eyes upon it. "I scarce know," he
replied.</p>

<p>"Lal, that is not the truth."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"'Tis not the truth. I am not to be put off with such an answer.
Yourself you said that you had warned him not to cross your path.
What path was in your mind?"</p>

<p>Lionel leaned his elbows on the table and took his head in his
hands. Weak from loss of blood, overwrought mentally as well, in a
state of revulsion and reaction also from the pursuit which had
been the cause of to-night's tragic affair, he had not strength to
withhold the confidence his brother asked. On the contrary, it
seemed to him that in making such a confidence, he would find a
haven and refuge in Sir Oliver.</p>

<p>"'Twas that wanton at Malpas was the cause of all," he
complained. And Sir Oliver's eye flashed at the words. "I deemed
her quite other; I was a fool, a fool! I"&mdash;he choked, and a
sob shook him&mdash;"I thought she loved me. I would have married
her, I would so, by God."</p>

<p>Sir Oliver swore softly under his breath.</p>

<p>"I believed her pure and good, and..." He checked. "After all,
who am I to say even now that she was not? 'Twas no fault of hers.
'Twas he, that foul dog Godolphin, who perverted her. Until he came
all was well between us. And then..."</p>

<p>"I see," said Sir Oliver quietly. "I think you have something
for which to thank him, if he revealed to you the truth of that
strumpet's nature. I would have warned thee, lad. But...Perhaps I
have been weak in that."</p>

<p>"It was not so; it was not she..."</p>

<p>"I say it was, and if I say so I am to be believed, Lionel. I'd
smirch no woman's reputation without just cause. Be very sure of
that."</p>

<p>Lionel stared up at him. "O God!" he cried presently, "I know
not what to believe. I am a shuttle-cock flung this way and that
way."</p>

<p>"Believe me," said Sir Oliver grimly. "And set all doubts to
rest." Then he smiled. "So that was the virtuous Master Peter's
secret pastime, eh? The hypocrisy of man! There is no plumbing the
endless depths of it!"</p>

<p>He laughed outright, remembering all the things that Master
Peter had said of Ralph Tressilian&mdash;delivering himself as
though he were some chaste and self-denying anchorite. Then on that
laugh he caught his breath quite suddenly. "Would she know?" he
asked fearfully. "Would that harlot know, would she suspect that
'twas your hand did this?"</p>

<p>"Aye&mdash;would she," replied the other. "I told her to-night,
when she flouted me and spoke of him, that I went straight to find
him and pay the score between us. I was on my way to Godolphin
Court when I came upon him in the park."</p>

<p>"Then you lied to me again, Lionel. For you said 'twas he
attacked you."</p>

<p>"And so he did." Lionel countered instantly. "He never gave me
time to speak, but flung down from his horse and came at me
snarling like a cross-grained mongrel. Oh, he was as ready for the
fight as I&mdash;as eager."</p>

<p>"But the woman at Malpas knows," said Sir Oliver gloomily. "And
if she tells..."</p>

<p>"She'll not," cried Lionel. "She dare not for her reputation's
sake."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I think you are right," agreed his brother with relief.
"She dare not for other reasons, when I come to think of it. Her
reputation is already such, and so well detested is she that were
it known she had been the cause, however indirect, of this, the
countryside would satisfy certain longings that it entertains
concerning her. You are sure none saw you either going or
returning?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>Sir Oliver strode the length of the room and back, pulling at
his pipe. "All should be well, then, I think," said he at last.
"You were best abed. I'll carry you thither."</p>

<p>He took up his stripling brother in his powerful arms and bore
him upstairs as though he were a babe.</p>

<p>When he had seen him safely disposed for slumber, he returned
below, shut the door in the hall, drew up the great oaken chair to
the fire, and sat there far into the night smoking and
thinking.</p>

<p>He had said to Lionel that all should be well. All should be
well for Lionel. But what of himself with the burden of this secret
on his soul? Were the victim another than Rosamund's brother the
matter would have plagued him but little. The fact that Godolphin
was slain, it must be confessed, was not in itself the source of
his oppression. Godolphin had more than deserved his end, and he
would have come by it months ago at Sir Oliver's own hand but for
the fact that he was Rosamund's brother, as we know. There was the
rub, the bitter, cruel rub. Her own brother had fallen by the hand
of his. She loved her brother more than any living being next to
himself, just as he loved Lionel above any other but herself. The
pain that must be hers he knew; he experienced some of it in
anticipation, participating it because it was hers and because all
things that were hers he must account in some measure his own.</p>

<p>He rose up at last, cursing that wanton at Malpas who had come
to fling this fresh and terrible difficulty where already he had to
face so many. He stood leaning upon the overmantel, his foot upon
one of the dogs of the fender, and considered what to do. He must
bear his burden in silence, that was all. He must keep this secret
even from Rosamund. It split his heart to think that he must
practise this deceit with her. But naught else was possible short
of relinquishing her, and that was far beyond his strength.</p>

<p>The resolve adopted, he took up a taper and went off to bed.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V &mdash; THE BUCKLER</h2>

<p>It was old Nicholas who brought the news next morning to the
brothers as they were breaking their fast.</p>

<p>Lionel should have kept his bed that day, but dared not, lest
the fact should arouse suspicion. He had a little fever, the
natural result both of his wound and of his loss of blood; he was
inclined to welcome rather than deplore it, since it set a flush on
cheeks that otherwise must have looked too pale.</p>

<p>So leaning upon his brother's arm he came down to a breakfast of
herrings and small ale before the tardy sun of that December
morning was well risen.</p>

<p>Nicholas burst in upon them with a white face and shaking limbs.
He gasped out his tale of the event in a voice of terror, and both
brothers affected to be shocked, dismayed and incredulous. But the
worst part of that old man's news, the true cause of his terrible
agitation, was yet to be announced.</p>

<p>"And they do zay," he cried with anger quivering through his
fear, "they do zay that it were you that killed he, Sir
Oliver."</p>

<p>"I?" quoth Sir Oliver, staring, and suddenly like a flood there
burst upon his mind a hundred reasons overlooked until this moment,
that inevitably must urge the countryside to this conclusion, and
to this conclusion only. "Where heard you that foul lie?"</p>

<p>In the tumult of his mind he never heeded what answer was
returned by Nicholas. What could it matter where the fellow had
heard the thing; by now it would be the accusation on the lips of
every man. There was one course to take and he must take it
instantly&mdash;as he had taken it once before in like case. He
must straight to Rosamund to forestall the tale that others would
carry to her. God send he did not come too late already.</p>

<p>He stayed for no more than to get his boots and hat, then to the
stables for a horse, and he was away over the short mile that
divided Penarrow from Godolphin Court, going by bridle and track
meadow straight to his goal. He met none until he fetched up in the
courtyard at Godolphin Court. Thence a babble of excited voices had
reached him as he aproached. But at sight of him there fell a
general silence, ominous and staring. A dozen men or more were
assembled there, and their eyes considered him first with amazement
and curiosity, then with sullen anger.</p>

<p>He leapt down from his saddle, and stood a moment waiting for
one of the three Godolphin grooms he had perceived in that assembly
to take his reins. Seeing that none stirred&mdash;</p>

<p>"How now?" he cried. "Does no one wait here? Hither, sirrah, and
hold my horse."</p>

<p>The groom addressed hesitated a moment, then, under the stare of
Sir Oliver's hard, commanding eye, he shuffled sullenly forward to
do as he was bid. A murmur ran through the group. Sir Oliver
flashed a glance upon it, and every tongue trembled into
silence.</p>

<p>In that silence he strode up the steps, and entered the
rush-strewn hall. As he vanished he heard the hubbub behind him
break out anew, fiercer than it had been before. But he nothing
heeded it.</p>

<p>He found himself face to face with a servant, who shrank before
him, staring as those in the courtyard had stared. His heart sank.
It was plain that he came a little late already; that the tale had
got there ahead of him.</p>

<p>"Where is your mistress?" said he.</p>

<p>"I...I will tell her you are here, Sir Oliver," the man replied
in a voice that faltered; and he passed through a doorway on the
right. Sir Oliver stood a moment tapping his boots with his whip,
his face pale, a deep line between his brows. Then the man
reappeared, closing the door after him.</p>

<p>"Mistress Rosamund bids you depart, sir. She will not see
you."</p>

<p>A moment Sir Oliver scanned the servant's face&mdash;or appeared
to scan it, for it is doubtful if he saw the fellow at all. Then
for only answer he strode forward towards the door from which the
man had issued. The servant set his back to it, his face
resolute.</p>

<p>"Sir Oliver, my mistress will not see you."</p>

<p>"Out of my way!" he muttered in his angry, contemptuous fashion,
and as the man persistent in his duty stood his ground, Sir Oliver
took him by the breast of his jacket, heaved him aside and went
in.</p>

<p>She was standing in mid-apartment, dressed by an odd irony all
in bridal white, that yet was not as white as was her face. Her
eyes looked like two black stains, solemn and haunting as they
fastened up on this intruder who would not be refused. Her lips
parted, but she had no word for him. She just stared in a horror
that routed all his audacity and checked the masterfulness of his
advance. At last he spoke.</p>

<p>"I see that you have heard," said he, "the lie that runs the
countryside. That is evil enough. But I see that you have lent an
ear to it; and that is worse."</p>

<p>She continued to regard him with a cold look of loathing, this
child that but two days ago had lain against his heart gazing up at
him in trust and adoration.</p>

<p>"Rosamund!" he cried, and approached her by another step.
"Rosamund! I am here to tell you that it is a lie."</p>

<p>"You had best go," she said, and her voice had in it a quality
that made him tremble.</p>

<p>"Go?" he echoed stupidly. "You bid me go? You will not hear
me?"</p>

<p>"I consented to hear you more than once; refused to hear others
who knew better than I, and was heedless of their warnings. There
is no more to be said between us. I pray God that they may take and
hang you."</p>

<p>He was white to the lips, and for the first time in his life he
knew fear and felt his great limbs trembling under him.</p>

<p>"They may hang me and welcome since you believe this thing. They
could not hurt me more than you are doing, nor by hanging me could
they deprive me of aught I value, since your faith in me is a thing
to be blown upon by the first rumour of the countryside."</p>

<p>He saw the pale lips twist themselves into a dreadful smile.</p>

<p>"There is more than rumour, I think," said she. "There is more
than all your lies will ever serve to cloak."</p>

<p>"My lies?" he cried. "Rosamund, I swear to you by my honour that
I have had no hand in the slaying of Peter. May God rot me where I
stand if this be not true!"</p>

<p>"It seems," said a harsh voice behind him, "that you fear God as
little as aught else."</p>

<p>He wheeled sharply to confront Sir John Killigrew, who had
entered after him.</p>

<p>"So," he said slowly, and his eyes grew hard and bright as
agates, "this is your work." And he waved a hand towards Rosamund.
It was plain to what he alluded.</p>

<p>"My work?" quoth Sir John. He closed the door, and advanced into
the room. "Sir, it seems your audacity, your shamelessness,
transcends all bounds. Your..."</p>

<p>"Have done with that," Sir Oliver interrupted him and smote his
great fist upon the table. He was suddenly swept by a gust of
passion. "Leave words to fools, Sir John, and criticisms to those
that can defend them better."</p>

<p>"Aye, you talk like a man of blood. You come hectoring it here
in the very house of the dead&mdash;in the very house upon which
you have cast this blight of sorrow and murder..."</p>

<p>"Have done, I say, or murder there will be!"</p>

<p>His voice was a roar, his mien terrific. And bold man though Sir
John was, he recoiled. Instantly Sir Oliver had conquered himself
again. He swung to Rosamund. "Ah, forgive me!" he pleaded. "I am
mad&mdash;stark mad with anguish at the thing imputed. I have not
loved your brother, it is true. But as I swore to you, so have I
done. I have taken blows from him, and smiled; but yesterday in a
public place he affronted me, lashed me across the face with his
riding-whip, as I still bear the mark. The man who says I were not
justified in having killed him for it is a liar and a hypocrite.
Yet the thought of you, Rosamund, the thought that he was your
brother sufficed to quench the rage in which he left me. And now
that by some grim mischance he has met his death, my recompense for
all my patience, for all my thought for you is that I am charged
with slaying him, and that you believe this charge."</p>

<p>"She has no choice," rasped Killigrew.</p>

<p>"Sir John," he cried, "I pray you do not meddle with her choice.
That you believe it, marks you for a fool, and a fool's counsel is
a rotten staff to lean upon at any time. Why God o' mercy! assume
that I desired to take satisfaction for the affront he had put upon
me; do you know so little of men, and of me of all men, that you
suppose I should go about my vengeance in this hole-and-corner
fashion to set a hangman's noose about my neck. A fine vengeance
that, as God lives! Was it so I dealt with you, Sir John, when you
permitted your tongue to wag too freely, as you have yourself
confessed? Heaven's light, man; take a proper view; consider was
this matter likely. I take it you are a more fearsome antagonist
than was ever poor Peter Godolphin, yet when I sought satisfaction
of you I sought it boldly and openly, as is my way. When we
measured swords in your park at Arwenack we did so before witnesses
in proper form, that the survivor might not be troubled with the
Justices. You know me well, and what manner of man I am with my
weapons. Should I not have done the like by Peter if I had sought
his life? Should I not have sought it in the same open fashion, and
so killed him at my pleasure and leisure, and without risk or
reproach from any?"</p>

<p>Sir John was stricken thoughtful. Here was logic hard and clear
as ice; and the knight of Arwenack was no fool. But whilst he stood
frowning and perplexed at the end of that long tirade, it was
Rosamund who gave Sir Oliver his answer.</p>

<p>"You ran no risk of reproach from any, do you say?"</p>

<p>He turned, and was abashed. He knew the thought that was running
in her mind.</p>

<p>"You mean," he said slowly, gently, his accents charged with
reproachful incredulity, "that I am so base and false that I could
in this fashion do what I dared not for your sake do openly? 'Tis
what you mean. Rosamund! I burn with shame for you that you can
think such thoughts of one whom...whom you professed to love."</p>

<p>Her coldness fell from her. Under the lash of his bitter,
half-scornful accents, her anger mounted, whelming for a moment
even her anguish in her brother's death.</p>

<p>"You false deceiver!" she cried. "There are those who heard you
vow his death. Your very words have been reported to me. And from
where he lay they found a trail of blood upon the snow that ran to
your own door. Will you still lie?"</p>

<p>They saw the colour leave his face. They saw his arms drop
limply to his sides, and his eyes dilate with obvious sudden
fear.</p>

<p>"A...a trail of blood?" he faltered stupidly.</p>

<p>"Aye, answer that!" cut in Sir John, fetched suddenly from out
his doubts by that reminder.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver turned upon Killigrew again. The knight's words
restored to him the courage of which Rosamund's had bereft him.
With a man he could fight; with a man there was no need to mince
his words.</p>

<p>"I cannot answer it," he said, but very firmly, in a tone that
brushed aside all implications. "If you say it was so, so it must
have been. Yet when all is said, what does it prove? Does it set it
beyond doubt that it was I who killed him? Does it justify the
woman who loved me to believe me a murderer and something worse?"
He paused, and looked at her again, a world of reproach in his
glance. She had sunk to a chair, and rocked there, her fingers
locking and interlocking, her face a mask of pain unutterable.</p>

<p>"Can you suggest what else it proves, sir?" quoth Sir John, and
there was doubt in his voice.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver caught the note of it, and a sob broke from him.</p>

<p>"O God of pity!" he cried out. "There is doubt in your voice,
and there is none in hers. You were my enemy once, and have since
been in a mistrustful truce with me, yet you can doubt that I did
this thing. But she...she who loved me has no room for any
doubt!"</p>

<p>"Sir Oliver," she answered him, "the thing you have done has
broken quite my heart. Yet knowing all the taunts by which you were
brought to such a deed I could have forgiven it, I think, even
though I could no longer be your wife; I could have forgiven it, I
say, but for the baseness of your present denial."</p>

<p>He looked at her, white-faced an instant, then turned on his
heel and made for the door. There he paused.</p>

<p>"Your meaning is quite plain," said he. "It is your wish that I
shall take my trial for this deed." He laughed. "Who will accuse me
to the Justices? Will you, Sir John?"</p>

<p>"If Mistress Rosamund so desires me," replied the knight.</p>

<p>"Ha! Be it so. But do not think I am the man to suffer myself to
be sent to the gallows upon such paltry evidence as satisfies that
lady. If any accuser comes to bleat of a trail of blood reaching to
my door, and of certain words I spoke yesterday in anger, I will
take my trial&mdash;but it shall be trial by battle upon the body
of my accuser. That is my right, and I will have every ounce of it.
Do you doubt how God will pronounce? I call upon him solemnly to
pronounce between me and such an one. If I am guilty of this thing
may He wither my arm when I enter the lists."</p>

<p>"Myself I will accuse you," came Rosamund's dull voice. "And if
you will, you may claim your rights against me and butcher me as
you butchered him."</p>

<p>"God forgive you, Rosamund!" said Sir Oliver, and went out.</p>

<p>He returned home with hell in his heart. He knew not what the
future might hold in store for him; but such was his resentment
against Rosamund that there was no room in his bosom for despair.
They should not hang him. He would fight them tooth and claw, and
yet Lionel should not suffer. He would take care of that. And then
the thought of Lionel changed his mood a little. How easily could
he have shattered their accusation, how easily have brought her to
her proud knees imploring pardon of him! By a word he could have
done it, yet he feared lest that word must jeopardize his
brother.</p>

<p>In the calm, still watches of that night, as he lay sleepless
upon his bed and saw things without heat, there crept a change into
his mental attitude. He reviewed all the evidence that had led her
to her conclusions, and he was forced to confess that she was in
some measure justified of them. If she had wronged him, he had
wronged her yet more. For years she had listened to all the
poisonous things that were said of him by his enemies&mdash;and his
arrogance had made him not a few. She had disregarded all because
she loved him; her relations with her brother had become strained
on that account, yet now, all this returned to crush her;
repentance played its part in her cruel belief that it was by his
hand Peter Godolphin had fallen. It must almost seem to her that in
a sense she had been a party to his murder by the headstrong course
to which she had kept in loving the man her brother hated.</p>

<p>He saw it now, and was more merciful in judging her. She had
been more than human if she had not felt as he now saw that she
must feel, and since reactions are to be measured by the mental
exaltations from which they spring, so was it but natural that now
she must hate him fiercely whom she had loved well-nigh as
fiercely.</p>

<p>It was a heavy cross to bear. Yet for Lionel's sake he must bear
it with what fortitude he could. Lionel must not be sacrificed to
his egoism for a deed that in Lionel he could not account other
than justified. He were base indeed did he so much as contemplate
such a way of escape as that.</p>

<p>But if he did not contemplate it, Lionel did, and went in terror
during those days, a terror that kept him from sleep and so
fostered the fever in him that on the second day after that grim
affair he had the look of a ghost, hollow-eyed and gaunt. Sir
Oliver remonstrated with him and in such terms as to put heart into
him anew. Moreover, there was other news that day to allay his
terrors: the Justices at Truro had been informed of the event and
the accusation that was made; but they had refused point-blank to
take action in the matter. The reason of it was that one of them
was that same Master Anthony Baine who had witnessed the affront
offered Sir Oliver. He declared that whatever had happened to
Master Godolphin as a consequence was no more than he deserved, no
more than he had brought upon himself, and he gave it as his
decision that his conscience as a man of honour would not permit
him to issue any warrant to the constable.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver received this news from that other witness, the
parson, who himself had suffered such rudeness at Godolphin's
hands, and who, man of the Gospel and of peace though he was,
entirely supported the Justice's decision&mdash;or so he
declared.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver thanked him, protesting that it was kind in him and
in Master Baine to take such a view, but for the rest avowing that
he had had no hand in the affair, however much appearances might
point to him.</p>

<p>When, however, it came to his knowledge two days later that the
whole countryside was in a ferment against Master Baine as a
consequence of the attitude he had taken up, Sir Oliver summoned
the parson and straightway rode with him to the Justice's house at
Truro, there to afford certain evidence which he had withheld from
Rosamund and Sir John Killigrew.</p>

<p>"Master Baine," he said, when the three of them were closeted in
that gentleman's library, "I have heard of the just and gallant
pronouncement you have made, and I am come to thank you and to
express my admiration of your courage."</p>

<p>Master Baine bowed gravely. He was a man whom Nature had made
grave.</p>

<p>"But since I would not that any evil consequences might attend
your action, I am come to lay proof before you that you have acted
more rightly even than you think, and that I am not the
slayer."</p>

<p>"You are not?" ejaculated Master Baine in amazement.</p>

<p>"Oh, I assure you I use no subterfuge with you, as you shall
judge. I have proof to show you, as I say; and I am come to do so
now before time might render it impossible. I do not desire it to
be made public just yet, Master Baine; but I wish you to draw up
some such document as would satisfy the courts at any future time
should this matter be taken further, as well it may."</p>

<p>It was a shrewd plea. The proof that was not upon himself was
upon Lionel; but time would efface it, and if anon publication were
made of what he was now about to show, it would then be too late to
look elsewhere.</p>

<p>"I assure you, Sir Oliver, that had you killed him after what
happened I could not hold you guilty of having done more than
punish a boorish and arrogant offender."</p>

<p>"I know sir. But it was not so. One of the pieces of evidence
against me&mdash;indeed the chief item&mdash;is that from
Godolphin's body to my door there was a trail of blood."</p>

<p>The other two grew tensely interested. The parson watched him
with unblinking eyes.</p>

<p>"Now it follows logically, I think, inevitably indeed, that the
murderer must have been wounded in the encounter. The blood could
not possibly have been the victim's, therefore it must have been
the slayer's. That the slayer was wounded indeed we know, since
there was blood upon Godolphin's sword. Now, Master Baine, and you,
Sir Andrew, shall be witnesses that there is upon my body not so
much as a scratch of recent date. I will strip me here as naked as
when first I had the mischance to stray into this world, and you
shall satisfy yourselves of that. Thereafter I shall beg you,
Master Baine, to indite the document I have mentioned." And he
removed his doublet as he spoke. "But since I will not give these
louts who accuse me so much satisfaction, lest I seem to go in fear
of them, I must beg, sirs, that you will keep this matter entirely
private until such time as its publication may be rendered
necessary by events."</p>

<p>They saw the reasonableness of his proposal, and they consented,
still entirely sceptical. But when they had made their examination
they were utterly dumbfounded to find all their notions entirely
overset. Master Baine, of course, drew up the required document,
and signed and sealed it, whilst Sir Andrew added his own signature
and seal as witness thereunto.</p>

<p>With this parchment that should be his buckler against any
future need, Sir Oliver rode home, uplifted. For once it were safe
to do so, that parchment should be spread before the eyes of Sir
John Killigrew and Rosamund, and all might yet be well.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI &mdash; JASPER LEIGH</h2>

<p>If that Christmas was one of sorrow at Godolphin Court, it was
nothing less at Penarrow.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver was moody and silent in those days, given to sit for
long hours staring into the heart of the fire and repeating to
himself again and again every word of his interview with Rosamund,
now in a mood of bitter resentment against her for having so
readily believed his guilt, now in a gentler sorrowing humour which
made full allowance for the strength of the appearances against
him.</p>

<p>His half-brother moved softly about the house now in a sort of
self-effacement, never daring to intrude upon Sir Oliver's
abstractions. He was well acquainted with their cause. He knew what
had happened at Godolphin Court, knew that Rosamund had dismissed
Sir Oliver for all time, and his heart smote him to think that he
should leave his brother to bear this burden that rightly belonged
to his own shoulders.</p>

<p>The thing preyed so much upon his mind that in an expansive
moment one evening he gave it tongue.</p>

<p>"Noll," he said, standing beside his brother's chair in the
firelit gloom, and resting a hand upon his brother's shoulder,
"were it not best to tell the truth?"</p>

<p>Sir Oliver looked up quickly, frowning. "Art mad?" quoth he.
"The truth would hang thee, Lal."</p>

<p>"It might not. And in any case you are suffering something worse
than hanging. Oh, I have watched you every hour this past week, and
I know the pain that abides in you. It is not just." And he
insisted&mdash;"We had best tell the truth."</p>

<p>Sir Oliver smiled wistfully. He put out a hand and took his
brother's.</p>

<p>"'Tis noble in you to propose it, Lal."</p>

<p>"Not half so noble as it is in you to bear all the suffering for
a deed that was my own."</p>

<p>"Bah!" Sir Oliver shrugged impatiently; his glance fell away
from Lionel's face and returned to the consideration of the fire.
"After all, I can throw off the burden when I will. Such knowledge
as that will enhearten a man through any trial."</p>

<p>He had spoken in a harsh, cynical tone, and Lionel had turned
cold at his words. He stood a long while in silence there, turning
them over in his mind and considering the riddle which they
presented him. He thought of asking his brother bluntly for the key
to it, for the precise meaning of his disconcerting statement, but
courage failed him. He feared lest Sir Oliver should confirm his
own dread interpretation of it.</p>

<p>He drew away after a time, and soon after went to bed. For days
thereafter the phrase rankled in his mind&mdash;"I can throw off
the burden when I will." Conviction grew upon him that Sir Oliver
meant that he was enheartened by the knowledge that by speaking if
he choose he could clear himself. That Sir Oliver would so speak he
could not think. Indeed, he was entirely assured that Sir Oliver
was very far from intending to throw off his burden. Yet he might
come to change his mind. The burden might grow too heavy, his
longings for Rosamund too clamorous, his grief at being in her eyes
her brother's murderer too overwhelming.</p>

<p>Lionel's soul shuddered to contemplate the consequences to
himself. His fears were self-revelatory. He realized how far from
sincere had been his proposal that they should tell the truth; he
perceived that it had been no more than the emotional outburst of
the moment, a proposal which if accepted he must most bitterly have
repented. And then came the reflection that if he were guilty of
emotional outbursts that could so outrageously play the traitor to
his real desires, were not all men subject to the same? Might not
his brother, too, come to fall a prey to one of those moments of
mental storm when in a climax of despair he would find his burden
altogether too overwhelming and in rebellion cast it from him?</p>

<p>Lionel sought to assure himself that his brother was a man of
stern fibres, a man who never lost control of himself. But against
this he would argue that what had happened in the past was no
guarantee of what might happen in the future; that a limit was set
to the endurance of every man be he never so strong, and that it
was far from impossible that the limit of Sir Oliver's endurance
might be reached in this affair. If that happened in what case
should he find himself? The answer to this was a picture beyond his
fortitude to contemplate. The danger of his being sent to trial and
made to suffer the extreme penalty of the law would be far greater
now than if he had spoken at once. The tale he could then have told
must have compelled some attention, for he was accounted a man of
unsmirched honour and his word must carry some weight. But now none
would believe him. They would argue from his silence and from his
having suffered his brother to be unjustly accused that he was
craven-hearted and dishonourable, and that if he had acted thus it
was because he had no good defence to offer for his deed. Not only
would he be irrevocably doomed, but he would be doomed with
ignominy, he would be scorned by all upright men and become a thing
of contempt over whose end not a tear would be shed.</p>

<p>Thus he came to the dread conclusion that in his endeavours to
screen himself he had but enmeshed himself the more inextricably.
If Oliver but spoke he was lost. And back he came to the question:
What assurance had he that Oliver would not speak?</p>

<p>The fear of this from occurring to him occasionally began to
haunt him day and night, and for all that the fever had left him
and his wound was entirely healed, he remained pale and thin and
hollow-eyed. Indeed the secret terror that was in his soul glared
out of his eyes at every moment. He grew nervous and would start up
at the least sound, and he went now in a perpetual mistrust of
Oliver, which became manifest in a curious petulance of which there
were outbursts at odd times.</p>

<p>Coming one afternoon into the dining-room, which was ever Sir
Oliver's favourite haunt in the mansion of Penarrow, Lionel found
his half-brother in that brooding attitude, elbow on knee and chin
on palm, staring into the fire. This was so habitual now in Sir
Oliver that it had begun to irritate Lionel's tense nerves; it had
come to seem to him that in this listlessness was a studied tacit
reproach aimed at himself.</p>

<p>"Why do you sit ever thus over the fire like some old crone?" he
growled, voicing at last the irritability that so long had been
growing in him.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver looked round with mild surprise in his glance. Then
from Lionel his eyes travelled to the long windows.</p>

<p>"It rains," he said.</p>

<p>"It was not your wont to be driven to the fireside by rain. But
rain or shine 'tis ever the same. You never go abroad."</p>

<p>"To what end?" quoth Sir Oliver, with the same mildness, but a
wrinkle of bewilderment coming gradually between his dark brows.
"Do you suppose I love to meet lowering glances, to see heads
approach one another so that confidential curses of me may be
muttered?"</p>

<p>"Ha!" cried Lionel, short and sharp, his sunken eyes blazing
suddenly. "It has come to this, then, that having voluntarily done
this thing to shield me you now reproach me with it."</p>

<p>"I?" cried Sir Oliver, aghast.</p>

<p>"Your very words are a reproach. D'ye think I do not read the
meaning that lies under them?"</p>

<p>Sir Oliver rose slowly, staring at his brother. He shook his
head and smiled.</p>

<p>"Lal, Lal!" he said. "Your wound has left you disordered, boy.
With what have I reproached you? What was this hidden meaning of my
words? If you will read aright you will see it to be that to go
abroad is to involve myself in fresh quarrels, for my mood is
become short, and I will not brook sour looks and mutterings. That
is all."</p>

<p>He advanced and set his hands upon his brother's shoulders.
Holding him so at arm's length he considered him, what time Lionel
drooped his head and a slow flush overspread his cheeks. "Dear
fool!" he said, and shook him. "What ails you? You are pale and
gaunt, and not yourself at all. I have a notion. I'll furnish me a
ship and you shall sail with me to my old hunting-grounds. There is
life out yonder&mdash;life that will restore your vigour and your
zest, and perhaps mine as well. How say you, now?"</p>

<p>Lionel looked up, his eye brightening. Then a thought occurred
to him; a thought so mean that again the colour flooded into his
cheeks, for he was shamed by it. Yet it clung. If he sailed with
Oliver, men would say that he was a partner in the guilt attributed
to his brother. He knew&mdash;from more than one remark addressed
him here or there, and left by him uncontradicted&mdash;that the
belief was abroad on the countryside that a certain hostility was
springing up between himself and Sir Oliver on the score of that
happening in Godolphin Park. His pale looks and hollow eyes had
contributed to the opinion that his brother's sin was weighing
heavily upon him. He had ever been known for a gentle, kindly lad,
in all things the very opposite of the turbulent Sir Oliver, and it
was assumed that Sir Oliver in his present increasing harshness
used his brother ill because the lad would not condone his crime. A
deal of sympathy was consequently arising for Lionel and was being
testified to him on every hand. Were he to accede to such a
proposal as Oliver now made him, assuredly he must jeopardize all
that.</p>

<p>He realized to the full the contemptible quality of his thought
and hated himself for conceiving it. But he could not shake off its
dominion. It was stronger than his will.</p>

<p>His brother observing this hesitation, and misreading it drew
him to the fireside and made him sit.</p>

<p>"Listen," he said, as he dropped into the chair opposite. "There
is a fine ship standing in the road below, off Smithick. You'll
have seen her. Her master is a desperate adventurer named Jasper
Leigh, who is to be found any afternoon in the alehouse at
Penycumwick. I know him of old, and he and his ship are to be
acquired. He is ripe for any venture, from scuttling Spaniards to
trading in slaves, and so that the price be high enough we may buy
him body and soul. His is a stomach that refuses nothing, so there
be money in the venture. So here is ship and master ready found;
the rest I will provide&mdash;the crew, the munitions, the
armament, and by the end of March we shall see the Lizard dropping
astern. What do you say, Lal? 'Tis surely better than to sit,
moping here in this place of gloom."</p>

<p>"I'll...I'll think of it," said Lionel, but so listlessly that
all Sir Oliver's quickening enthusiasm perished again at once and
no more was said of the venture.</p>

<p>But Lionel did not altogether reject the notion. If on the one
hand he was repelled by it, on the other he was attracted almost
despite himself. He went so far as to acquire the habit of riding
daily over to Penycumwick, and there he made the acquaintance of
that hardy and scarred adventurer of whom Sir Oliver had spoken,
and listened to the marvels the fellow had to tell&mdash;many of
them too marvellous to be true&mdash;of hazards upon distant
seas.</p>

<p>But one day in early March Master Jasper Leigh had a tale of
another kind for him, news that dispelled from Lionel's mind all
interest in the captain's ventures on the Spanish Main. The seaman
had followed the departing Lionel to the door of the little inn and
stood by his stirrup after he had got to horse.</p>

<p>"A word in your ear, good Master Tressilian," said he. "D'ye
know what is being concerted here against our brother?"</p>

<p>"Against my brother?"</p>

<p>"Ay&mdash;in the matter of the killing of Master Peter Godolphin
last Christmas. Seeing that the Justices would not move of
theirselves, some folk ha' petitioned the Lieutenant of Cornwall to
command them to grant a warrant for Sir Oliver's arrest on a charge
o' murder. But the Justices ha' refused to be driven by his
lordship, answering that they hold their office direct from the
Queen and that in such a matter they are answerable to none but Her
Grace. And now I hear that a petition be gone to London to the
Queen herself, begging her to command her Justices to perform their
duty or quit their office."</p>

<p>Lionel drew a sharp breath, and with dilating eyes regarded the
mariner, but made him no answer.</p>

<p>Jasper laid a long finger against his nose and his eyes grew
cunning. "I thought I'd warn you, sir, so as you may bid Sir Oliver
look to hisself. 'Tis a fine seaman and fine seamen be none so
plentiful."</p>

<p>Lionel drew his purse from his pocket and without so much as
looking into its contents dropped it into the seaman's ready hand,
with a muttered word of thanks.</p>

<p>He rode home in terror almost. It was come. The blow was about
to fall, and his brother would at last be forced to speak. At
Penarrow a fresh shock awaited him. He learnt from old Nicholas
that Sir Oliver was from home, that he had ridden over to Godolphin
Court.</p>

<p>The instant conclusion prompted by Lionel's terror was that
already the news had reached Sir Oliver and that he had instantly
taken action; for he could not conceive that his brother should go
to Godolphin Court upon any other business.</p>

<p>But his fears on that score were very idle. Sir Oliver, unable
longer to endure the present state of things, had ridden over to
lay before Rosamund that proof with which he had taken care to
furnish himself. He could do so at last without any fear of hurting
Lionel. His journey, however, had been entirely fruitless. She had
refused point-blank to receive him, and for all that with a
humility entirely foreign to him he had induced a servant to return
to her with a most urgent message, yet he had been denied. He
returned stricken to Penarrow, there to find his brother awaiting
him in a passion of impatience.</p>

<p>"Well?" Lionel greeted him. "What will you do now?"</p>

<p>Sir Oliver looked at him from under brows that scowled darkly in
reflection of his thoughts.</p>

<p>"Do now? Of what do you talk?" quoth he.</p>

<p>"Have you not heard?" And Lionel told him the news.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver stared long at him when he had done, then his lips
tightened and he smote his brow.</p>

<p>"So!" he cried. "Would that be why she refused to see me? Did
she conceive that I went perhaps to plead? Could she think that?
Could she?"</p>

<p>He crossed to the fireplace and stirred the logs with his boot
angrily. "Oh! 'Twere too unworthy. Yet of a certainty 'tis her
doing, this."</p>

<p>"What shall you do?" insisted Lionel, unable to repress the
question that was uppermost in his mind; and his voice shook.</p>

<p>"Do?" Sir Oliver looked at him over his shoulder. "Prick this
bubble, by heaven! Make an end of it for them, confound them and
cover them with shame."</p>

<p>He said it roughly, angrily, and Lionel recoiled, deeming that
roughness and anger aimed at himself. He sank into a chair, his
knees loosened by his sudden fear. So it seemed that he had had
more than cause for his apprehensions. This brother of his who
boasted such affection for him was not equal to bearing this matter
through. And yet the thing was so unlike Oliver that a doubt still
lingered with him.</p>

<p>"You...you will tell them the truth?" he said, in small,
quavering voice.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver turned and considered him more attentively.</p>

<p>"A God's name, Lal, what's in thy mind now?" he asked, almost
roughly. "Tell them the truth? Why, of course&mdash;but only as it
concerns myself. You're not supposing that I shall tell them it was
you? You'll not be accounting me capable of that?"</p>

<p>"What other way is there?"</p>

<p>Sir Oliver explained the matter. The explanation brought Lionel
relief. But this relief was ephemeral. Further reflection presented
a new fear to him. It came to him that if Sir Oliver cleared
himself, of necessity his own implication must follow. His terrors
very swiftly magnified a risk that in itself was so slender as to
be entirely negligible. In his eyes it ceased to be a risk; it
became a certain and inevitable danger. If Sir Oliver put forward
this proof that the trail of blood had not proceeded from himself,
it must, thought Lionel, inevitably be concluded that it was his
own. As well might Sir Oliver tell them the whole truth, for surely
they could not fail to infer it. Thus he reasoned in his terror,
accounting himself lost irrevocably.</p>

<p>Had he but gone with those fears of his to his brother, or had
he but been able to abate them sufficiently to allow reason to
prevail, he must have been brought to understand how much further
they carried him than was at all justified by probability. Oliver
would have shown him this, would have told him that with the
collapsing of the charge against himself no fresh charge could be
levelled against any there, that no scrap of suspicion had ever
attached to Lionel, or ever could. But Lionel dared not seek his
brother in this matter. In his heart he was ashamed of his fears;
in his heart he knew himself for a craven. He realized to the full
the hideousness of his selfishness, and yet, as before, he was not
strong enough to conquer it. In short, his love of himself was
greater than his love of his brother, or of twenty brothers.</p>

<p>The morrow&mdash;a blustering day of late March found him again
at that alehouse at Penycumwick in the company of Jasper Leigh. A
course had occurred to him, as the only course now possible. Last
night his brother had muttered something of going to Killigrew with
his proofs since Rosamund refused to receive him. Through Killigrew
he would reach her, he had said; and he would yet see her on her
knees craving his pardon for the wrong she had done him, for the
cruelty she had shown him.</p>

<p>Lionel knew that Killigrew was absent from home just then; but
he was expected to return by Easter, and to Easter there was but a
week. Therefore he had little time in which to act, little time in
which to execute the project that had come into his mind. He cursed
himself for conceiving it, but held to it with all the strength of
a weak nature.</p>

<p>Yet when he came to sit face to face with Jasper Leigh in that
little inn-parlour with the scrubbed table of plain deal between
them, he lacked the courage to set his proposal forth. They drank
sherry sack stiffly laced with brandy by Lionel's suggestion,
instead of the more customary mulled ale. Yet not until he had
consumed the best part of a pint of it did Lionel feel himself
heartened to broaching his loathsome business. Through his head
hummed the words his brother had said some time ago when first the
name of Jasper Leigh had passed between them&mdash;a desperate
adventurer ripe for anything. So the price be high enough you may
buy him body and soul." Money enough to buy Jasper Leigh was ready
to Lionel's hand; but it was Sir Oliver's money&mdash;the money
that was placed at Lionel's disposal by his half-brother's
open-handed bounty. And this money he was to employ for Oliver's
utter ruin! He cursed himself for a filthy, contemptible hound; he
cursed the foul fiend that whispered such suggestions into his
mind; he knew himself, despised himself and reviled himself until
he came to swear to be strong and to go through with whatever might
await him sooner than be guilty of such a baseness; the next moment
that same resolve would set him shuddering again as he viewed the
inevitable consequences that must attend it.</p>

<p>Suddenly the captain set him a question, very softly, that fired
the train and blew all his lingering self-resistance into
shreds.</p>

<p>"You'll ha' borne my warning to Sir Oliver?" he asked, lowering
his voice so as not to be overheard by the vintner who was stirring
beyond the thin wooden partition.</p>

<p>Master Lionel nodded, nervously fingering the jewel in his ear,
his eyes shifting from their consideration of the seaman's coarse,
weather-tanned and hairy countenance.</p>

<p>"I did," he said. "But Sir Oliver is headstrong. He will not
stir."</p>

<p>"Will he not?" The captain stroked his bushy red beard and
cursed profusely and horribly after the fashion of the sea. "Od's
wounds! He's very like to swing if he bides him here."</p>

<p>"Ay," said Lionel, "if he bides." He felt his mouth turn dry as
he spoke; his heart thudded, but its thuds were softened by a
slight insensibility which the liquor had produced in him.</p>

<p>He uttered the words in so curious a tone that the sailor's dark
eyes peered at him from under his heavy sandy eyebrows. There was
alert inquiry in that glance. Master Lionel got up suddenly.</p>

<p>"Let us take a turn outside, captain," said he.</p>

<p>The captain's eyes narrowed. He scented business. There was
something plaguily odd about this young gentleman's manner. He
tossed off the remains of his sack, slapped down the pot and
rose.</p>

<p>"Your servant, Master Tressilian," said he.</p>

<p>Outside our gentleman untethered his horse from the iron ring to
which he had attached the bridle; leading his horse he turned
seaward and strode down the road that wound along the estuary
towards Smithick.</p>

<p>A sharp breeze from the north was whipping the water into white
peaks of foam; the sky was of a hard brightness and the sun shone
brilliantly. The tide was running out, and the rock in the very
neck of the haven was thrusting its black crest above the water. A
cable's length this side of it rode the black hull and naked spars
of the Swallow&mdash;Captain Leigh's ship.</p>

<p>Lionel stepped along in silence, very gloomy and pensive,
hesitating even now. And the crafty mariner reading this
hesitation, and anxious to conquer it for the sake of such profit
as he conceived might lie in the proposal which he scented, paved
the way for him at last.</p>

<p>"I think that ye'll have some matter to propose to me." said he
slyly. "Out with it, sir, for there never was a man more ready to
serve you."</p>

<p>"The fact is," said Lionel, watching the other's face with a
sidelong glance, "I am in a difficult position, Master Leigh."</p>

<p>"I've been in a many," laughed the captain, "but never yet in
one through which I could not win. Strip forth your own, and haply
I can do as much for you as I am wont to do for myself."</p>

<p>"Why, it is this wise," said the other. "My brother will
assuredly hang as you have said if he bides him here. He is lost if
they bring him to trial. And in that case, faith, I am lost too. It
dishonours a man's family to have a member of it hanged. 'Tis a
horrible thing to have happen."</p>

<p>"Indeed, indeed!" the sailor agreed encouragingly.</p>

<p>"I would abstract him from this," pursued Lionel, and at the
same time cursed the foul fiend that prompted him such specious
words to cloak his villainy. "I would abstract him from it, and yet
'tis against my conscience that he should go unpunished for I swear
to you, Master Leigh, that I abhor the deed&mdash;a cowardly,
murderous deed!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the captain. And lest that grim ejaculation should
check his gentleman he made haste to add&mdash;"To be sure! To be
sure!"</p>

<p>Master Lionel stopped and faced the other squarely, his
shoulders to his horse. They were quite alone in as lonely a spot
as any conspirator could desire. Behind him stretched the empty
beach, ahead of him the ruddy cliffs that rise gently to the wooded
heights of Arwenack.</p>

<p>"I'll be quite plain and open with you, Master Leigh. Peter
Godolphin was my friend. Sir Oliver is no more than my
half-brother. I would give a deal to the man who would abstract Sir
Oliver secretly from the doom that hangs over him, and yet do the
thing in such a way that Sir Oliver should not thereby escape the
punishment he deserves."</p>

<p>It was strange, he thought, even as he said it, that he could
bring his lips so glibly to utter words that his heart
detested.</p>

<p>The captain looked grim. He laid a finger upon Master Lionel's
velvet doublet in line with that false heart of his.</p>

<p>"I am your man," said he. "But the risk is great. Yet ye say
that ye'ld give a deal..."</p>

<p>"Yourself shall name the price," said Lionel quickly, his eyes
burning feverishly, his cheeks white.</p>

<p>"Oh I can contrive it, never fear," said the captain. "I know to
a nicety what you require. How say you now: if I was to carry him
overseas to the plantations where they lack toilers of just such
thews as his?" He lowered his voice and spoke with some slight
hesitation, fearing that he proposed perhaps more than his
prospective employer might desire.</p>

<p>"He might return," was the answer that dispelled all doubts on
that score.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the skipper. "What o' the Barbary rovers, then! They
lack slaves and are ever ready to trade, though they be niggardly
payers. I never heard of none that returned once they had him safe
aboard their galleys. I ha' done some trading with them, bartering
human freights for spices and eastern carpets and the like."</p>

<p>Master Lionel breathed hard. "'Tis a horrible fate, is't
not?"</p>

<p>The captain stroked his beard. "Yet 'tis the only really safe
bestowal, and when all is said 'tis not so horrible as hanging, and
certainly less dishonouring to a man's kin. Ye'ld be serving Sir
Oliver and yourself."</p>

<p>"'Tis so, tis so," cried Master Lionel almost fiercely. "And the
price?"</p>

<p>The seaman shifted on his short, sturdy legs, and his face grew
pensive. "A hundred pound?" he suggested tentatively.</p>

<p>"Done with you for a hundred pounds," was the prompt
answer&mdash;so prompt that Captain Leigh realized he had driven a
fool's bargain which it was incumbent upon him to amend.</p>

<p>"That is, a hundred pound for myself," he corrected slowly.
"Then there be the crew to reckon for&mdash;to keep their counsel
and lend a hand; 'twill mean another hundred at the least."</p>

<p>Master Lionel considered a moment. "It is more than I can lay my
hands on at short notice. But, look you, you shall have a hundred
and fifty pounds in coin and the balance in jewels. You shall not
be the loser in that, I promise you. And when you come again, and
bring me word that all is done as you now undertake there shall be
the like again."</p>

<p>Upon that the bargain was settled. And when Lionel came to talk
of ways and means he found that he had allied himself to a man who
understood his business thoroughly. All the assistance that the
skipper asked was that Master Lionel should lure his gentleman to
some concerted spot conveniently near the waterside. There Leigh
would have a boat and his men in readiness, and the rest might very
safely be left to him.</p>

<p>In a flash Lionel bethought him of the proper place for this. He
swung round, and pointed across the water to Trefusis Point and the
grey pile of Godolphin Court all bathed in sunshine now.</p>

<p>"Yonder, at Trefusis Point in the shadow of Godolphin Court at
eight to-morrow night, when there will be no moon. I'll see that he
is there. But on your life do not miss him."</p>

<p>"Trust me," said Master Leigh. "And the money?"</p>

<p>"When you have him safely aboard come to me at Penarrow," he
replied, which showed that after all he did not trust Master Leigh
any further than he was compelled.</p>

<p>The captain was quite satisfied. For should his gentleman fail
to disburse he could always return Sir Oliver to shore.</p>

<p>On that they parted. Lionel mounted and rode away, whilst Master
Leigh made a trumpet of his hands and hallooed to the ship.</p>

<p>As he stood waiting for the boat that came off to fetch him, a
smile slowly overspread the adventurer's rugged face. Had Master
Lionel seen it he might have asked himself how far it was safe to
drive such bargains with a rogue who kept faith only in so far as
it was profitable. And in this matter Master Leigh saw a way to
break faith with profit. He had no conscience, but he loved as all
rogues love to turn the tables upon a superior rogue. He would play
Master Lionel most finely, most poetically false; and he found a
deal to chuckle over in the contemplation of it.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII &mdash; TREPANNED</h2>

<p>Master Lionel was absent most of the following day from
Penarrow, upon a pretext of making certain purchases in Truro. It
would be half-past seven when he returned; and as he entered he met
Sir Oliver in the hall.</p>

<p>"I have a message for you from Godolphin Court," he announced,
and saw his brother stiffen and his face change colour. "A boy met
me at the gates and bade me tell you that Mistress Rosamund desires
a word with you forthwith."</p>

<p>Sir Oliver's heart almost stopped, then went off at a gallop.
She asked for him! She had softened perhaps from her yesterday's
relentlessness. She would consent at last to see him!</p>

<p>"Be thou blessed for these good tidings!" he answered on a note
of high excitement. "I go at once." And on the instant he departed.
Such was his eagerness, indeed, that under the hot spur of it he
did not even stay to fetch that parchment which was to be his
unanswerable advocate. The omission was momentous.</p>

<p>Master Lionel said no word as his brother swept out. He shrank
back a little into the shadows. He was white to the lips and felt
as he would stifle. As the door closed he moved suddenly. He sprang
to follow Sir Oliver. Conscience cried out to him that he could not
do this thing. But Fear was swift to answer that outcry. Unless he
permitted what was planned to take its course, his life might pay
the penalty.</p>

<p>He turned, and lurched into the dining-room upon legs that
trembled.</p>

<p>He found the table set for supper as on that other night when he
had staggered in with a wound in his side to be cared for and
sheltered by Sir Oliver. He did not approach the table; he crossed
to the fire, and sat down there holding out his hands to the blaze.
He was very cold and could not still his trembling. His very teeth
chattered.</p>

<p>Nicholas came in to know if he would sup. He answered unsteadily
that despite the lateness of the hour he would await Sir Oliver's
return.</p>

<p>"Is Sir Oliver abroad?" quoth the servant in surprise.</p>

<p>"He went out a moment since, I know not whither," replied
Lionel. "But since he has not supped he is not like to be long
absent."</p>

<p>Upon that he dismissed the servant, and sat huddled there, a
prey to mental tortures which were not to be repressed. His mind
would turn upon naught but the steadfast, unwavering affection of
which Sir Oliver ever had been prodigal towards him. In this very
matter of Peter Godolphin's death, what sacrifices had not Sir
Oliver made to shield him? From so much love and self-sacrifice in
the past he inclined to argue now that not even in extreme peril
would his brother betray him. And then that bad streak of fear
which made a villain of him reminded him that to argue thus was to
argue upon supposition, that it would be perilous to trust such an
assumption; that if, after all, Sir Oliver should fail him in the
crucial test, then was he lost indeed.</p>

<p>When all is said, a man's final judgment of his fellows must be
based upon his knowledge of himself; and Lionel, knowing himself
incapable of any such sacrifice for Sir Oliver, could not believe
Sir Oliver capable of persisting in such a sacrifice as future
events might impose. He reverted to those words Sir Oliver had
uttered in that very room two nights ago, and more firmly than ever
he concluded that they could have but one meaning.</p>

<p>Then came doubt, and, finally, assurance of another sort,
assurance that this was not so and that he knew it; assurance that
he lied to himself, seeking to condone the thing he did. He took
his head in his hands and groaned loud. He was a villain, a
black-hearted, soulless villain! He reviled himself again. There
came a moment when he rose shuddering, resolved even in this
eleventh hour to go after his brother and save him from the doom
that awaited him out yonder in the night.</p>

<p>But again that resolve was withered by the breath of selfish
fear. Limply he resumed his seat, and his thoughts took a fresh
turn. They considered now those matters which had engaged them on
that day when Sir Oliver had ridden to Arwenack to claim
satisfaction of Sir John Killigrew. He realized again that Oliver
being removed, what he now enjoyed by his brother's bounty he would
enjoy henceforth in his own unquestioned right. The reflection
brought him a certain consolation. If he must suffer for his
villainy, at least there would be compensations.</p>

<p>The clock over the stables chimed the hour of eight. Master
Lionel shrank back in his chair at the sound. The thing would be
doing even now. In his mind he saw it all&mdash;saw his brother
come running in his eagerness to the gates of Godolphin Court, and
then dark forms resolve themselves from the surrounding darkness
and fall silently upon him. He saw him struggling a moment on the
ground, then, bound hand and foot, a gag thrust into his mouth, he
beheld him in fancy borne swiftly down the slope to the beach and
so to the waiting boat.</p>

<p>Another half-hour sat he there. The thing was done by now, and
this assurance seemed to quiet him a little.</p>

<p>Then came Nicholas again to babble of some possible mischance
having overtaken his master.</p>

<p>"What mischance should have overtaken him?" growled Lionel, as
if in scorn of the idea.</p>

<p>"I pray none indeed," replied the servant. "But Sir Oliver lacks
not for enemies nowadays, and 'tis scarce safe for he to be abroad
after dark."</p>

<p>Master Lionel dismissed the notion contemptuously. For
pretence's sake he announced that he would wait no longer,
whereupon Nicholas brought in his supper, and left him again to go
and linger about the door, looking out into the night and listening
for his master's return. He paid a visit to the stables, and knew
that Sir Oliver had gone forth afoot.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Master Lionel must make pretence of eating though
actual eating must have choked him. He smeared his platter, broke
food, and avidly drank a bumper of claret. Then he, too, feigned a
growing anxiety and went to join Nicholas. Thus they spent the
weary night, watching for the return of one who Master Lionel knew
would return no more.</p>

<p>At dawn they roused the servants and sent them to scour the
countryside and put the news of Sir Oliver's disappearance abroad.
Lionel himself rode out to Arwenack to ask Sir John Killigrew
bluntly if he knew aught of this matter.</p>

<p>Sir John showed a startled face, but swore readily enough that
he had not so much as seen Sir Oliver for days. He was gentle with
Lionel, whom he liked, as everybody liked him. The lad was so mild
and kindly in his ways, so vastly different from his arrogant
overbearing brother, that his virtues shone the more brightly by
that contrast.</p>

<p>"I confess it is natural you should come to me," said Sir John.
"But, my word on it, I have no knowledge of him. It is not my way
to beset my enemies in the dark."</p>

<p>"Indeed, indeed, Sir John, I had not supposed it in my heart,"
replied the afflicted Lionel. "Forgive me that I should have come
to ask a question so unworthy. Set it down to my distracted state.
I have not been the same man these months, I think, since that
happening in Godolphin Park. The thing has preyed upon my mind. It
is a fearsome burden to know your own brother&mdash;though I thank
God he is no more than my half-brother&mdash;guilty of so foul a
deed."</p>

<p>"How?" cried Killigrew, amazed. "You say that? You believed it
yourself?"</p>

<p>Master Lionel looked confused, a look which Sir John entirely
misunderstood and interpreted entirely in the young man's favour.
And it was thus and in that moment that was sown the generous seed
of the friendship that was to spring up between these two men, its
roots fertilized by Sir John's pity that one so gentle-natured, so
honest, and so upright should be cursed with so villainous a
brother.</p>

<p>"I see, I see," he said. And he sighed. "You know that we are
daily expecting an order from the Queen to her Justices to take the
action which hitherto they have refused against your...against Sir
Oliver." He frowned thoughtfully. "D'ye think Sir Oliver had news
of this?"</p>

<p>At once Master Lionel saw the drift of what was in the other's
mind.</p>

<p>"I know it," he replied. "Myself I bore it him. But why do you
ask?"</p>

<p>"Does it not help us perhaps to understand and explain Sir
Oliver's disappearance? God lack! Surely, knowing that, he were a
fool to have tarried here, for he would hang beyond all doubt did
he stay for the coming of Her Grace's messenger."</p>

<p>"My God!" said Lionel, staring. "You...you think he is fled,
then?"</p>

<p>Sir John shrugged. "What else is to be thought?"</p>

<p>Lionel hung his head. "What else, indeed?" said he, and took his
leave like a man overwrought, as indeed he was. He had never
considered that so obvious a conclusion must follow upon his work
so fully to explain the happening and to set at rest any doubt
concerning it.</p>

<p>He returned to Penarrow, and bluntly told Nicholas what Sir John
suspected and what he feared himself must be the true reason of Sir
Oliver's disappearance. The servant, however, was none so easy to
convince.</p>

<p>"But do ee believe that he done it?" cried Nicholas. "Do ee
believe it, Master Lionel?" There was reproach amounting to horror
in the servant's voice.</p>

<p>"God help me, what else can I believe now that he is fled."</p>

<p>Nicholas sidled up to him with tightened lips. He set two
gnarled fingers on the young man's arm.</p>

<p>"He'm not fled, Master Lionel," he announced with grim
impressiveness. "He'm never a turntail. Sir Oliver he don't fear
neither man nor devil, and if so be him had killed Master
Godolphin, he'd never ha' denied it. Don't ee believe Sir John
Killigrew. Sir John ever hated he."</p>

<p>But in all that countryside the servant was the only one to hold
this view. If a doubt had lingered anywhere of Sir Oliver's guilt,
that doubt was now dispelled by this flight of his before the
approach of the expected orders from the Queen.</p>

<p>Later that day came Captain Leigh to Penarrow inquiring for Sir
Oliver.</p>

<p>Nicholas brought word of his presence and his inquiry to Master
Lionel, who bade him be admitted.</p>

<p>The thick-set little seaman rolled in on his bowed legs, and
leered at his employer when they were alone.</p>

<p>"He's snug and safe aboard," he announced. "The thing were done
as clean as peeling an apple, and as quiet."</p>

<p>"Why did you ask for him?" quoth Master Lionel.</p>

<p>"Why?" Jasper leered again. "My business was with him. There was
some talk between us of him going a voyage with me. I've heard the
gossip over at Smithick. This will fit in with it." He laid that
finger of his to his nose. "Trust me to help a sound tale along. 'T
were a clumsy business to come here asking for you, sir. Ye'll know
now how to account for my visit."</p>

<p>Lionel paid him the price agreed and dismissed him upon
receiving the assurance that the Swallow would put to sea upon the
next tide.</p>

<p>When it became known that Sir Oliver had been in treaty with
Master Leigh for a passage overseas, and that it was but on that
account that Master Leigh had tarried in that haven, even Nicholas
began to doubt.</p>

<p>Gradually Lionel recovered his tranquillity as the days flowed
on. What was done was done, and, in any case, being now beyond
recall, there was no profit in repining. He never knew how fortune
aided him, as fortune will sometimes aid a villain. The royal
pour-suivants arrived some six days later, and Master Baine was the
recipient of a curt summons to render himself to London, there to
account for his breach of trust in having refused to perform his
sworn duty. Had Sir Andrew Flack but survived the chill that had
carried him off a month ago, Master Justice Baine would have made
short work of the accusation lodged against him. As it was, when he
urged the positive knowledge he possessed, and told them how he had
made the examination to which Sir Oliver had voluntarily submitted,
his single word carried no slightest conviction. Not for a moment
was it supposed that this was aught but the subterfuge of one who
had been lax in his duty and who sought to save himself from the
consequences of that laxity. And the fact that he cited as his
fellow-witness a gentleman now deceased but served to confirm his
judges in this opinion. He was deposed from his office and
subjected to a heavy fine, and there the matter ended, for the
hue-and-cry that was afoot entirely failed to discover any trace of
the missing Sir Oliver.</p>

<p>For Master Lionel a new existence set in from that day. Looked
upon as one in danger of suffering for his brother's sins, the
countryside determined to help him as far as possible to bear his
burden. Great stress was laid upon the fact that after all he was
no more than Sir Oliver's half-brother; some there were who would
have carried their kindness to the lengths of suggesting that
perhaps he was not even that, and that it was but natural that
Ralph Tressilian's second wife should have repaid her husband in
kind for his outrageous infidelities. This movement of sympathy was
led by Sir John Killigrew, and it spread in so rapid and marked a
manner that very soon Master Lionel was almost persuaded that it
was no more than he deserved, and he began to sun himself in the
favour of a countryside that hitherto had shown little but
hostility for men of the Tressilian blood.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII &mdash; THE
SPANIARD</h2>

<p>The Swallow, having passed through a gale in the Bay of
Biscay&mdash;a gale which she weathered like the surprisingly
steady old tub she was&mdash;rounded Cape Finisterre and so emerged
from tempest into peace, from leaden skies and mountainous seas
into a sunny azure calm. It was like a sudden transition from
winter into spring, and she ran along now, close hauled to the soft
easterly breeze, with a gentle list to port.</p>

<p>It had never been Master Leigh's intent to have got so far as
this without coming to an understanding with his prisoner. But the
wind had been stronger than his intentions, and he had been
compelled to run before it and to head to southward until its fury
should abate. Thus it fell out&mdash;and all marvellously to Master
Lionel's advantage, as you shall see&mdash;that the skipper was
forced to wait until they stood along the coast of
Portugal&mdash;but well out to sea, for the coast of Portugal was
none too healthy just then to English seamen&mdash;before
commanding Sir Oliver to be haled into his presence.</p>

<p>In the cramped quarters of the cabin in the poop of the little
vessel sat her captain at a greasy table, over which a lamp was
swinging faintly to the gentle heave of the ship. He was smoking a
foul pipe, whose fumes hung heavily upon the air of that little
chamber, and there was a bottle of Nantes at his elbow.</p>

<p>To him, sitting thus in state, was Sir Oliver
introduced&mdash;his wrists still pinioned behind him. He was
haggard and hollow-eyed, and he carried a week's growth of beard on
his chin. Also his garments were still in disorder from the
struggle he had made when taken, and from the fact that he had been
compelled to lie in them ever since.</p>

<p>Since his height was such that it was impossible for him to
stand upright in that low-ceilinged cabin, a stool was thrust
forward for him by one of the ruffians of Leigh's crew who had
haled him from his confinement beneath the hatchway.</p>

<p>He sat down quite listlessly, and stared vacantly at the
skipper. Master Leigh was somewhat discomposed by this odd calm
when he had looked for angry outbursts. He dismissed the two seamen
who fetched Sir Oliver, and when they had departed and closed the
cabin door he addressed his captive.</p>

<p>"Sir Oliver," said he, stroking his red beard, "ye've been most
foully abused."</p>

<p>The sunshine filtered through one of the horn windows and beat
full upon Sir Oliver's expressionless face.</p>

<p>"It was not necessary, you knave, to bring me hither to tell me
so much." he answered.</p>

<p>"Quite so," said Master Leigh. "But I have something more to
add. Ye'll be thinking that I ha' done you a disservice. There ye
wrong me. Through me you are brought to know true friends from
secret enemies; henceforward ye'll know which to trust and which to
mistrust."</p>

<p>Sir Oliver seemed to rouse himself a little from his passivity,
stimulated despite himself by the impudence of this rogue. He
stretched a leg and smiled sourly.</p>

<p>"You'll end by telling me that I am in your debt," said he.</p>

<p>"You'll end by saying so yourself," the captain assured him.
"D'ye know what I was bidden do with you?"</p>

<p>"Faith, I neither know nor care," was the surprising answer,
wearily delivered. "If it is for my entertainment that you propose
to tell me, I beg you'll spare yourself the trouble."</p>

<p>It was not an answer that helped the captain. He pulled at his
pipe a moment.</p>

<p>"I was bidden," said he presently, "to carry you to Barbary and
sell you there into the service of the Moors. That I might serve
you, I made believe to accept this task."</p>

<p>"God's death!" swore Sir Oliver. "You carry make-believe to an
odd length."</p>

<p>"The weather has been against me. It were no intention o' mine
to ha' come so far south with you. But we've been driven by the
gale. That is overpast, and so that ye'll promise to bear no plaint
against me, and to make good some of the loss I'll make by going
out of my course, and missing a cargo that I wot of, I'll put about
and fetch you home again within a week."</p>

<p>Sir Oliver looked at him and smiled grimly. "Now what a rogue
are you that can keep faith with none!" he cried. "First you take
money to carry me off; and then you bid me pay you to carry me back
again."</p>

<p>"Ye wrong me, sir, I vow ye do! I can keep faith when honest men
employ me, and ye should know it, Sir Oliver. But who keeps faith
with rogues is a fool&mdash;and that I am not, as ye should also
know. I ha' done this thing that a rogue might be revealed to you
and thwarted, as well as that I might make some little profit out
of this ship o' mine. I am frank with ye, Sir Oliver. I ha' had
some two hundred pounds in money and trinkets from your brother.
Give me the like and..."</p>

<p>But now of a sudden Sir Oliver's listlessness was all dispelled.
It fell from him like a cloak, and he sat forward, wide awake and
with some show of anger even.</p>

<p>"How do you say?" he cried, on a sharp, high note.</p>

<p>The captain stared at him, his pipe neglected. "I say that if so
be as ye'll pay me the same sum which your brother paid me to carry
you off..."</p>

<p>"My brother?" roared the knight. "Do you say my brother?"</p>

<p>"I said your brother."</p>

<p>"Master Lionel?" the other demanded still.</p>

<p>"What other brothers have you?" quoth Master Leigh.</p>

<p>There fell a pause and Sir Oliver looked straight before him,
his head sunken a little between his shoulders. "Let me
understand," he said at length. "Do you say that my brother Lionel
paid you money to carry me off&mdash;in short, that my presence
aboard this foul hulk of yours is due to him?"</p>

<p>"Whom else had ye suspected? Or did ye think that I did it for
my own personal diversion?"</p>

<p>"Answer me," bellowed Sir Oliver, writhing in his bonds.</p>

<p>"I ha' answered you more than once already. Still, I tell you
once again, since ye are slow to understand it, that I was paid a
matter of two hundred pound by your brother, Master Lionel
Tressilian, to carry you off to Barbary and there sell you for a
slave. Is that plain to you?"</p>

<p>"As plain as it is false. You lie, you dog!"</p>

<p>"Softly, softly!" quoth Master Leigh, good-humouredly.</p>

<p>"I say you lie!"</p>

<p>Master Leigh considered him a moment. "Sets the wind so!" said
he at length, and without another word he rose and went to a
sea-chest ranged against the wooden wall of the cabin. He opened it
and took thence a leather bag. From this he produced a handful of
jewels. He thrust them under Sir Oliver's nose. "Haply," said he,
"ye'll be acquainted with some of them. They was given me to make
up the sum since your brother had not the whole two hundred pound
in coin. Take a look at them."</p>

<p>Sir Oliver recognized a ring and a long pear-shaped pearl
earring that had been his brother's; he recognized a medallion that
he himself had given Lionel two years ago; and so, one by one, he
recognized every trinket placed before him.</p>

<p>His head drooped to his breast, and he sat thus awhile like a
man stunned. "My God!" he groaned miserably, at last. "Who, then,
is left to me! Lionel too! Lionel!" A sob shook the great frame.
Two tears slowly trickled down that haggard face and were lost in
the stubble of beard upon his chin. "I am accursed!" he said.</p>

<p>Never without such evidence could he have believed this thing.
From the moment that he was beset outside the gates of Godolphin
Court he had conceived it to be the work of Rosamund, and his
listlessness was begotten of the thought that she could have
suffered conviction of his guilt and her hatred of him to urge her
to such lengths as these. Never for an instant had he doubted the
message delivered him by Lionel that it was Mistress Rosamund who
summoned him. And just as he believed himself to be going to
Godolphin Court in answer to her summons, so did he conclude that
the happening there was the real matter to which she had bidden
him, a thing done by her contriving, her answer to his attempt on
the previous day to gain speech with her, her manner of ensuring
that such an impertinence should never be repeated.</p>

<p>This conviction had been gall and wormwood to him; it had
drugged his very senses, reducing him to a listless indifference to
any fate that might be reserved him. Yet it had not been so bitter
a draught as this present revelation. After all, in her case there
were some grounds for the hatred that had come to take the place of
her erstwhile love. But in Lionel's what grounds were possible?
What motives could exist for such an action as this, other than a
monstrous, a loathly egoism which desired perhaps to ensure that
the blame for the death of Peter Godolphin should not be shifted
from the shoulders that were unjustly bearing it, and the accursed
desire to profit by the removal of the man who had been brother,
father and all else to him? He shuddered in sheer horror. It was
incredible, and yet beyond a doubt it was true. For all the love
which he had showered upon Lionel, for all the sacrifices of self
which he had made to shield him, this was Lionel's return. Were all
the world against him he still must have believed Lionel true to
him, and in that belief must have been enheartened a little. And
now...His sense of loneliness, of utter destitution overwhelmed
him. Then slowly of his sorrow resentment was begotten, and being
begotten it grew rapidly until it filled his mind and whelmed in
its turn all else. He threw back his great head, and his bloodshot,
gleaming eyes fastened upon Captain Leigh, who seated now upon the
sea-chest was quietly observing him and waiting patiently until he
should recover the wits which this revelation had scattered.</p>

<p>"Master Leigh," said he, "what is your price to carry me home
again to England?"</p>

<p>"Why, Sir Oliver," said he, "I think the price I was paid to
carry you off would be a fair one. The one would wipe out t'other
as it were."</p>

<p>"You shall have twice the sum when you land me on Trefusis Point
again," was the instant answer.</p>

<p>The captain's little eyes blinked and his shaggy red eyebrows
came together in a frown. Here was too speedy an acquiescence.
There must be guile behind it, or he knew naught of the ways of
men.</p>

<p>"What mischief are ye brooding?" he sneered.</p>

<p>"Mischief, man? To you?" Sir Oliver laughed hoarsely. "God's
light, knave, d'ye think I consider you in this matter, or d'ye
think I've room in my mind for such petty resentments together with
that other?"</p>

<p>It was the truth. So absolute was the bitter sway of his anger
against Lionel that he could give no thought to this rascally
seaman's share in the adventure.</p>

<p>"Will ye give me your word for that?"</p>

<p>"My word? Pshaw, man! I have given it already. I swear that you
shall be paid the sum I've named the moment you set me ashore again
in England. Is that enough for you? Then cut me these bonds, and
let us make an end of my present condition."</p>

<p>"Faith, I am glad to deal with so sensible a man! Ye take it in
the proper spirit. Ye see that what I ha' done I ha' but done in
the way of my calling, that I am but a tool, and that what blame
there be belongs to them which hired me to this deed."</p>

<p>"Aye, ye're but a tool&mdash;a dirty tool, whetted with gold; no
more. 'Tis admitted. Cut me these bonds, a God's name! I'm weary o'
being trussed like a capon."</p>

<p>The captain drew his knife, crossed to Sir Oliver's side and
slashed his bonds away without further word. Sir Oliver stood up so
suddenly that he smote his head against the low ceiling of the
cabin, and so sat down again at once. And in that moment from
without and above there came a cry which sent the skipper to the
cabin door. He flung it open, and so let out the smoke and let in
the sunshine. He passed out on to the poop-deck, and Sir
Oliver&mdash;conceiving himself at liberty to do so&mdash;followed
him.</p>

<p>In the waist below a little knot of shaggy seamen were crowding
to the larboard bulwarks, looking out to sea; on the forecastle
there was another similar assembly, all staring intently ahead and
towards the land. They were off Cape Roca at the time, and when
Captain Leigh saw by how much they had lessened their distance from
shore since last he had conned the ship, he swore ferociously at
his mate who had charge of the wheel. Ahead of them away on their
larboard bow and in line with the mouth of the Tagus from which she
had issued&mdash;and where not a doubt but she had been lying in
wait for such stray craft as this&mdash;came a great tall-masted
ship, equipped with top-gallants, running well-nigh before the wind
with every foot of canvas spread.</p>

<p>Close-hauled as was the Swallow and with her top-sails and
mizzen reefed she was not making more than one knot to the
Spaniard's five&mdash;for that she was a Spaniard was beyond all
doubt judging by the haven whence she issued.</p>

<p>"Luff alee!" bawled the skipper, and he sprang to the wheel,
thrusting the mate aside with a blow of his elbow that almost sent
him sprawling.</p>

<p>"'Twas yourself set the course," the fellow protested.</p>

<p>"Thou lubberly fool," roared the skipper. "I bade thee keep the
same distance from shore. If the land comes jutting out to meet us,
are we to keep straight on until we pile her up?" He spun the wheel
round in his hands, and turned her down the wind. Then he
relinquished the helm to the mate again. "Hold her thus," he
commanded, and bellowing orders as he went, he heaved himself down
the companion to see them executed. Men sprang to the ratlines to
obey him, and went swarming aloft to let out the reefs of the
topsails; others ran astern to do the like by the mizzen and soon
they had her leaping and plunging through the green water with
every sheet unfurled, racing straight out to sea.</p>

<p>From the poop Sir Oliver watched the Spaniard. He saw her veer a
point or so to starboard, heading straight to intercept them, and
he observed that although this manceuvre brought her fully a point
nearer to the wind than the Swallow, yet, equipped as she was with
half as much canvas again as Captain Leigh's piratical craft, she
was gaining steadily upon them none the less.</p>

<p>The skipper came back to the poop, and stood there moodily
watching that other ship's approach, cursing himself for having
sailed into such a trap, and cursing his mate more fervently
still.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver meanwhile took stock of so much of the Swallow's
armament as was visible and wondered what like were those on the
main-deck below. He dropped a question on that score to the
captain, dispassionately, as though he were no more than an
indifferently interested spectator, and with never a thought to his
position aboard.</p>

<p>"Should I be racing her afore the Wind if I was properly
equipped?" growled Leigh. "Am I the man to run before a Spaniard?
As it is I do no more than lure her well away from land."</p>

<p>Sir Oliver understood, and was silent thereafter. He observed a
bo'sun and his mates staggering in the waist under loads of
cutlasses and small arms which they stacked in a rack about the
mainmast. Then the gunner, a swarthy, massive fellow, stark to the
waist with a faded scarf tied turban-wise about his head, leapt up
the companion to the brass carronade on the larboard quarter,
followed by a couple of his men.</p>

<p>Master Leigh called up the bo'sun, bade him take the wheel, and
dispatched the mate forward to the forecastle, where another gun
was being prepared for action.</p>

<p>Thereafter followed a spell of racing, the Spaniard ever
lessening the distance between them, and the land dropping astern
until it was no more than a hazy line above the shimmering sea.
Suddenly from the Spaniard appeared a little cloud of white smoke,
and the boom of a gun followed, and after it came a splash a
cable's length ahead of the Swallow's bows.</p>

<p>Linstock in hand the brawny gunner on the poop stood ready to
answer them when the word should be given. From below came the
gunner's mate to report himself ready for action on the main-deck
and to receive his orders.</p>

<p>Came another shot from the Spaniard, again across the bows of
the Swallow.</p>

<p>"'Tis a clear invitation to heave to," said Sir Oliver.</p>

<p>The skipper snarled in his fiery beard. "She has a longer range
than most Spaniards," said he. "But I'll not waste powder yet for
all that. We've none to spare."</p>

<p>Scarcely had he spoken when a third shot boomed. There was a
splintering crash overhead followed by a sough and a thud as the
maintopmast came hurtling to the deck and in its fall stretched a
couple of men in death. Battle was joined, it seemed. Yet Captain
Leigh did nothing in a hurry.</p>

<p>"Hold there!" he roared to the gunner who swung his linstock at
that moment in preparation.</p>

<p>She was losing way as a result of that curtailment of her
mainmast, and the Spaniard came on swiftly now. At last the skipper
accounted her near enough, and gave the word with an oath. The
Swallow fired her first and last shot in that encounter. After the
deafening thunder of it and through the cloud of suffocating smoke,
Sir Oliver saw the high forecastle of the Spaniard rent open.</p>

<p>Master Leigh was cursing his gunner for having aimed too high.
Then he signalled to the mate to fire the culverin of which he had
charge. That second shot was to be the signal for the whole
broadside from the main-deck below. But the Spaniard anticipated
them. Even as the skipper of the Swallow signalled the whole side
of the Spaniard burst into flame and smoke.</p>

<p>The Swallow staggered under the blow, recovered an instant, then
listed ominously to larboard.</p>

<p>"Hell!" roared Leigh. "She's bilging!" and Sir Oliver saw the
Spaniard standing off again, as if satisfied with what she had
done. The mate's gun was never fired, nor was the broadside from
below. Indeed that sudden list had set the muzzles pointing to the
sea; within three minutes of it they were on a level with the
water. The Swallow had received her death-blow, and she was
settling down.</p>

<p>Satisfied that she could do no further harm, the Spaniard luffed
and hove to, awaiting the obvious result and intent upon picking up
what slaves she could to man the galleys of his Catholic Majesty on
the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Thus the fate intended Sir Oliver by Lionel was to be fulfilled;
and it was to be shared by Master Leigh himself, which had not been
at all in that venal fellow's reckoning.</p>

<h2>PART II &mdash; SAKR-EL-BAHR</h2>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2-1" id="ch2-1"></a>CHAPTER I &mdash; THE
CAPTIVE</h2>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr, the hawk of the sea, the scourge of the
Mediterranean and the terror of Christian Spain, lay prone on the
heights of Cape Spartel.</p>

<p>Above him on the crest of the cliff ran the dark green line of
the orange groves of Araish&mdash;the reputed Garden of the
Hesperides of the ancients, where the golden apples grew. A mile or
so to eastward were dotted the huts and tents of a Bedouin
encampment on the fertile emerald pasture-land that spread away, as
far as eye could range, towards Ceuta. Nearer, astride of a grey
rock, an almost naked goatherd, a lithe brown stripling with a cord
of camel-hair about his shaven head, intermittently made melancholy
and unmelodious sounds upon a reed pipe. From somewhere in the blue
vault of heaven overhead came the joyous trilling of a lark, from
below the silken rustling of the tideless sea.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr lay prone upon a cloak of woven camel-hair amid
luxuriating fern and samphire, on the very edge of the shelf of
cliff to which he had climbed. On either side of him squatted a
negro from the Sus, both naked of all save white loin-cloths, their
muscular bodies glistening like ebony in the dazzling sunshine of
mid-May. They wielded crude fans fashioned from the yellowing
leaves of date palms, and their duty was to wave these gently to
and fro above their lord's head, to give him air and to drive off
the flies.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr was in the very prime of life, a man of a great
length of body, with a deep Herculean torso and limbs that
advertised a giant strength. His hawk-nosed face ending in a black
forked beard was of a swarthiness accentuated to exaggeration by
the snowy white turban wound about his brow. His eyes, by contrast,
were singularly light. He wore over his white shirt a long green
tunic of very light silk, woven along its edges with arabesques in
gold; a pair of loose calico breeches reached to his knees; his
brown muscular calves were naked, and his feet were shod in a pair
of Moorish shoes of crimson leather, with up-curling and very
pointed toes. He had no weapons other than the heavy-bladed knife
with a jewelled hilt that was thrust into his girdle of plaited
leather.</p>

<p>A yard or two away on his left lay another supine figure, elbows
on the ground, and hands arched above his brow to shade his eyes,
gazing out to sea. He, too, was a tall and powerful man, and when
he moved there was a glint of armour from the chain mail in which
his body was cased, and from the steel casque about which he had
swathed his green turban. Beside him lay an enormous curved
scimitar in a sheath of brown leather that was heavy with steel
ornaments. His face was handsome, and bearded, but swarthier far
than his companion's, and the backs of his long fine hands were
almost black.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr paid little heed to him. Lying there he looked down
the slope, clad with stunted cork-trees and evergreen oaks; here
and there was the golden gleam of broom; yonder over a spur of
whitish rock sprawled the green and living scarlet of a cactus.
Below him about the caves of Hercules was a space of sea whose
clear depths shifted with its slow movement from the deep green of
emerald to all the colours of the opal. A little farther off behind
a projecting screen of rock that formed a little haven, two
enormous masted galleys, each of fifty oars, and a smaller galliot
of thirty rode gently on the slight heave of the water, the vast
yellow oars standing out almost horizontally from the sides of each
vessel like the pinions of some gigantic bird. That they lurked
there either in concealment or in ambush was very plain. Above them
circled a flock of seagulls noisy and insolent.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr looked out to sea across the straits towards Tarifa
and the faint distant European coastline just visible through the
limpid summer air. But his glance was not concerned with that hazy
horizon; it went no further than a fine white-sailed ship that,
close-hauled, was beating up the straits some four miles off. A
gentle breeze was blowing from the east, and with every foot of
canvas spread to catch it she stood as close to it as was possible.
Nearer she came on her larboard tack, and not a doubt but her
master would be scanning the hostile African littoral for a sight
of those desperate rovers who haunted it and who took toll of every
Christian ship that ventured over-near. Sakr-el-Bahr smiled to
think how little the presence of his galleys could be suspected,
how innocent must look the sun-bathed shore of Africa to the
Christian skipper's diligently searching spy-glass. And there from
his height, like the hawk they had dubbed him, poised in the cobalt
heavens to plumb down upon his prey, he watched the great white
ship and waited until she should come within striking distance.</p>

<p>A promontory to eastward made something of a lee that reached
out almost a mile from shore. From the watcher's eyrie the line of
demarcation was sharply drawn; they could see the point at which
the white crests of the wind-whipped wavelets ceased and the water
became smoother. Did she but venture as far southward on her
present tack, she would be slow to go about again, and that should
be their opportunity. And all unconscious of the lurking peril she
held steadily to her course, until not half a mile remained between
her and that inauspicious lee.</p>

<p>Excitement stirred the mail-clad corsair; he kicked his heels in
the air, then swung round to the impassive and watchful
Sakr-el-Bahr.</p>

<p>"She will come! She will come!" he cried in the Frankish
jargon&mdash;the lingua franca of the African littoral.</p>

<p>"Insh' Allah!" was the laconic answer&mdash;"If God will."</p>

<p>A tense silence fell between them again as the ship drew nearer
so that now with each forward heave of her they caught a glint of
the white belly under her black hull. Sakr-el-Bahr shaded his eyes,
and concentrated his vision upon the square ensign flying from her
mainmast. He could make out not only the red and yellow
quarterings, but the devices of the castle and the lion.</p>

<p>"A Spanish ship, Biskaine," he growled to his companion. "It is
very well. The praise to the One!"</p>

<p>"Will she venture in?" wondered the other.</p>

<p>"Be sure she will venture," was the confident answer. "She
suspects no danger, and it is not often that our galleys are to be
found so far westward. Aye, there she comes in all her Spanish
pride."</p>

<p>Even as he spoke she reached that line of demarcation. She
crossed it, for there was still a moderate breeze on the leeward
side of it, intent no doubt upon making the utmost of that
southward run.</p>

<p>"Now!" cried Biskaine&mdash;Biskaine-el-Borak was he called from
the lightning-like impetuousness in which he was wont to strike. He
quivered with impatience, like a leashed hound.</p>

<p>"Not yet," was the calm, restraining answer. "Every inch nearer
shore she creeps the more certain is her doom. Time enough to sound
the charge when she goes about. Give me to drink, Abiad," he said
to one of his negroes, whom in irony he had dubbed "the White."</p>

<p>The slave turned aside, swept away a litter of ferns and
produced an amphora of porous red clay; he removed the palm-leaves
from the mouth of it and poured water into a cup. Sakr-el-Bahr
drank slowly, his eyes never leaving the vessel, whose every
ratline was clearly defined by now in the pellucid air. They could
see men moving on her decks, and the watchman stationed in the
foremast fighting-top. She was not more than half a mile away when
suddenly came the manceuvre to go about.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr leapt instantly to his great height and waved a
long green scarf. From one of the galleys behind the screen of
rocks a trumpet rang out in immediate answer to that signal; it was
followed by the shrill whistles of the bo'suns, and that again by
the splash and creak of oars, as the two larger galleys swept out
from their ambush. The long armoured poops were a-swarm with
turbaned corsairs, their weapons gleaming in the sunshine; a dozen
at least were astride of the crosstree of each mainmast, all armed
with bows and arrows, and the ratlines on each side of the galleys
were black with men who swarmed there like locusts ready to envelop
and smother their prey.</p>

<p>The suddenness of the attack flung the Spaniard into confusion.
There was a frantic stir aboard her, trumpet blasts and shootings
and wild scurryings of men hither and thither to the posts to which
they were ordered by their too reckless captain. In that confusion
her manoeuvre to go about went all awry, and precious moments were
lost during which she stood floundering, with idly flapping sails.
In his desperate haste the captain headed her straight to leeward,
thinking that by running thus before the wind he stood the best
chance of avoiding the trap. But there was not wind enough in that
sheltered spot to make the attempt successful. The galleys sped
straight on at an angle to the direction in which the Spaniard was
moving, their yellow dripping oars flashing furiously, as the
bo'suns plied their whips to urge every ounce of sinew in the
slaves.</p>

<p>Of all this Sakr-el-Bahr gathered an impression as, followed by
Biskaine and the negroes, he swiftly made his way down from that
eyrie that had served him so well. He sprang from red oak to
cork-tree and from cork-tree to red oak; he leapt from rock to
rock, or lowered himself from ledge to ledge, gripping a handful of
heath or a projecting stone, but all with the speed and nimbleness
of an ape. He dropped at last to the beach, then sped across it at
a run, and went bounding along a black reef until he stood
alongside of the galliot which had been left behind by the other
Corsair vessels. She awaited him in deep water, the length of her
oars from the rock, and as he came alongside, these oars were
brought to the horizontal, and held there firmly. He leapt down
upon them, his companions following him, and using them as a
gangway, reached the bulwarks. He threw a leg over the side, and
alighted on a decked space between two oars and the two rows of six
slaves that were manning each of them.</p>

<p>Biskaine followed him and the negroes came last. They were still
astride of the bulwarks when Sakr-el-Bahr gave the word. Up the
middle gangway ran a bo'sun and two of his mates cracking their
long whips of bullock-hide. Down went the oars, there was a heave,
and they shot out in the wake of the other two to join the
fight.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr, scimitar in hand, stood on the prow, a little in
advance of the mob of eager babbling corsairs who surrounded him,
quivering in their impatience to be let loose upon the Christian
foe. Above, along the yardarm and up the ratlines swarmed his
bowmen. From the mast-head floated out his standard of crimson
charged with a green crescent.</p>

<p>The naked Christian slaves groaned, strained and sweated under
the Moslem lash that drove them to the destruction of their
Christian brethren.</p>

<p>Ahead the battle was already joined. The Spaniard had fired one
single hasty shot which had gone wide, and now one of the corsair's
grappling-irons had seized her on the larboard quarter, a withering
hail of arrows was pouring down upon her decks from the Muslim
crosstrees; up her sides crowded the eager Moors, ever most eager
when it was a question of tackling the Spanish dogs who had driven
them from their Andalusian Caliphate. Under her quarter sped the
other galley to take her on the starboard side, and even as she
went her archers and stingers hurled death aboard the galleon.</p>

<p>It was a short, sharp fight. The Spaniards in confusion from the
beginning, having been taken utterly by surprise, had never been
able to order themselves in a proper manner to receive the
onslaught. Still, what could be done they did. They made a gallant
stand against this pitiless assailant. But the corsairs charged
home as gallantly, utterly reckless of life, eager to slay in the
name of Allah and His Prophet and scarcely less eager to die if it
should please the All-pitiful that their destinies should be here
fulfilled. Up they went, and back fell the Castilians, outnumbered
by at least ten to one.</p>

<p>When Sakr-el-Bahr's galliot came alongside, that brief encounter
was at an end, and one of his corsairs was aloft, hacking from the
mainmast the standard of Spain and the wooden crucifix that was
nailed below it. A moment later and to a thundering roar of
"Al-hamdolliah!" the green crescent floated out upon the
breeze.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr thrust his way through the press in the galleon's
waist; his corsairs fell back before him, making way, and as he
advanced they roared his name deliriously and waved their scimitars
to acclaim him this hawk of the sea, as he was named, this most
valiant of all the servants of Islam. True he had taken no actual
part in the engagement. It had been too brief and he had arrived
too late for that. But his had been the daring to conceive an
ambush at so remote a western point, and his the brain that had
guided them to this swift sweet victory in the name of Allah the
One.</p>

<p>The decks were slippery with blood, and strewn with wounded and
dying men, whom already the Muslimeen were heaving
overboard&mdash;dead and wounded alike when they were Christians,
for to what end should they be troubled with maimed slaves?</p>

<p>About the mainmast were huddled the surviving Spaniards,
weaponless and broken in courage, a herd of timid, bewildered
sheep.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr stood forward, his light eyes considering them
grimly. They must number close upon a hundred, adventurers in the
main who had set out from Cadiz in high hope of finding fortune in
the Indies. Their voyage had been a very brief one; their fate they
knew&mdash;to toil at the oars of the Muslim galleys, or at best,
to be taken to Algiers or Tunis and sold there into the slavery of
some wealthy Moor.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr's glance scanned them appraisingly, and rested
finally on the captain, who stood slightly in advance, his face
livid with rage and grief. He was richly dressed in the Castilian
black, and his velvet thimble-shaped hat was heavily plumed and
decked by a gold cross.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr salaamed ceremoniously to him. "Fortuna de guerra,
senor capitan," said he in fluent Spanish. "What is your name?"</p>

<p>"I am Don Paulo de Guzman," the man answered, drawing himself
erect, and speaking with conscious pride in himself and manifest
contempt of his interlocutor.</p>

<p>"So! A gentleman of family! And well-nourished and sturdy, I
should judge. In the sk at Algiers you might fetch two hundred
philips. You shall ransom yourself for five hundred."</p>

<p>"Por las Entranas de Dios!" swore Don Paulo who, like all pious
Spanish Catholics, favoured the oath anatomical. What else he would
have added in his fury is not known, for Sakr-el-Bahr waved him
contemptuously away.</p>

<p>"For your profanity and want of courtesy we will make the ransom
a thousand philips, then," said he. And to his
followers&mdash;"Away with him! Let him have courteous
entertainment against the coming of his ransom."</p>

<p>He was borne away cursing.</p>

<p>Of the others Sakr-el-Bahr made short work. He offered the
privilege of ransoming himself to any who might claim it, and the
privilege was claimed by three. The rest he consigned to the care
of Biskaine, who acted as his Kayia, or lieutenant. But before
doing so he bade the ship's bo'sun stand forward, and demanded to
know what slaves there might be on board. There were, he learnt,
but a dozen, employed upon menial duties on the ship&mdash;three
Jews, seven Muslimeen and two heretics&mdash;and they had been
driven under the hatches when the peril threatened.</p>

<p>By Sakr-el-Bahr's orders these were dragged forth from the
blackness into which they had been flung. The Muslimeen upon
discovering that they had fallen into the hands of their own people
and that their slavery was at an end, broke into cries of delight,
and fervent praise of Allah than whom they swore there was no other
God. The three Jews, lithe, stalwart young men in black tunics that
fell to their knees and black skull-caps upon their curly black
locks, smiled ingratiatingly, hoping for the best since they were
fallen into the hands of people who were nearer akin to them than
Christians and allied to them, at least, by the bond of common
enmity to Spain and common suffering at the hands of Spaniards. The
two heretics stood in stolid apathy, realizing that with them it
was but a case of passing from Charybdis to Scylla, and that they
had as little to hope for from heathen as from Christian. One of
these was a sturdy bowlegged fellow, whose garments were little
better than rags; his weather-beaten face was of the colour of
mahogany and his eyes of a dark blue under tufted eyebrows that
once had been red&mdash;like his hair and beard&mdash;but were now
thickly intermingled with grey. He was spotted like a leopard on
the hands by enormous dark brown freckles.</p>

<p>Of the entire dozen he was the only one that drew the attention
of Sakr-el-Bahr. He stood despondently before the corsair, with
bowed head and his eyes upon the deck, a weary, dejected,
spiritless slave who would as soon die as live. Thus some few
moments during which the stalwart Muslim stood regarding him; then
as if drawn by that persistent scrutiny he raised his dull, weary
eyes. At once they quickened, the dulness passed out of them; they
were bright and keen as of old. He thrust his head forward, staring
in his turn; then, in a bewildered way he looked about him at the
ocean of swarthy faces under turbans of all colours, and back again
at Sakr-el-Bahr.</p>

<p>"God's light!" he said at last, in English, to vent his infinite
amazement. Then reverting to the cynical manner that he had ever
affected, and effacing all surprise&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good day to you, Sir Oliver," said he. "I suppose ye'll give
yourself the pleasure of hanging me."</p>

<p>"Allah is great!" said Sakr-el-Bahr impassively.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2-2" id="ch2-2"></a>CHAPTER II &mdash; THE
RENEGADE</h2>

<p>How it came to happen that Sakr-el-Bahr, the Hawk of the Sea,
the Muslim rover, the scourge of the Mediterranean, the terror of
Christians, and the beloved of Asad-ed-Din, Basha of Algiers, would
be one and the same as Sir Oliver Tressilian, the Cornish gentleman
of Penarrow, is at long length set forth in the chronicles of Lord
Henry Goade. His lordship conveys to us some notion of how utterly
overwhelming he found that fact by the tedious minuteness with
which he follows step by step this extraordinary metamorphosis. He
devotes to it two entire volumes of those eighteen which he has
left us. The whole, however, may with advantage be summarized into
one short chapter.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver was one of a score of men who were rescued from the
sea by the crew of the Spanish vessel that had sunk the Swallow;
another was Jasper Leigh, the skipper. All of them were carried to
Lisbon, and there handed over to the Court of the Holy Office.
Since they were heretics all&mdash;or nearly all&mdash;it was fit
and proper that the Brethren of St. Dominic should undertake their
conversion in the first place. Sir Oliver came of a family that
never had been famed for rigidity in religious matters, and he was
certainly not going to burn alive if the adoption of other men's
opinions upon an extremely hypothetical future state would suffice
to save him from the stake. He accepted Catholic baptism with an
almost contemptuous indifference. As for Jasper Leigh, it will be
conceived that the elasticity of the skipper's conscience was no
less than Sir Oliver's, and he was certainly not the man to be
roasted for a trifle of faith.</p>

<p>No doubt there would be great rejoicings in the Holy House over
the rescue of these two unfortunate souls from the certain
perdition that had awaited them. It followed that as converts to
the Faith they were warmly cherished, and tears of thanksgiving
were profusely shed over them by the Hounds of God. So much for
their heresy. They were completely purged of it, having done
penance in proper form at an Auto held on the Rocio at Lisbon,
candle in hand and sanbenito on their shoulders. The Church
dismissed them with her blessing and an injunction to persevere in
the ways of salvation to which with such meek kindness she had
inducted them.</p>

<p>Now this dismissal amounted to a rejection. They were, as a
consequence, thrown back upon the secular authorities, and the
secular authorities had yet to punish them for their offence upon
the seas. No offence could be proved, it is true. But the courts
were satisfied that this lack of offence was but the natural result
of a lack of opportunity. Conversely, they reasoned, it was not to
be doubted that with the opportunity the offence would have been
forthcoming. Their assurance of this was based upon the fact that
when the Spaniard fired across the bows of the Swallow as an
invitation to heave to, she had kept upon her course. Thus, with
unanswerable Castilian logic was the evil conscience of her skipper
proven. Captain Leigh protested on the other hand that his action
had been dictated by his lack of faith in Spaniards and his firm
belief that all Spaniards were pirates to be avoided by every
honest seaman who was conscious of inferior strength of armaments.
It was a plea that won him no favour with his narrow-minded
judges.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver fervently urged that he was no member of the crew of
the Swallow, that he was a gentleman who found himself aboard her
very much against his will, being the victim of a villainous piece
of trepanning executed by her venal captain. The court heard his
plea with respect, and asked to know his name and rank. He was so
very indiscreet as to answer truthfully. The result was extremely
educative to Sir Oliver; it showed him how systematically conducted
was the keeping of the Spanish archives. The court produced
documents enabling his judges to recite to him most of that portion
of his life that had been spent upon the seas, and many an awkward
little circumstance which had slipped his memory long since, which
he now recalled, and which certainly was not calculated to make his
sentence lighter.</p>

<p>Had he not been in the Barbados in such a year, and had he not
there captured the galleon Maria de las Dolores? What was that but
an act of villainous piracy? Had he not scuttled a Spanish carack
four years ago in the bay of Funchal? Had he not been with that
pirate Hawkins in the affair at San Juan de Ulloa? And so on.
Questions poured upon him and engulfed him.</p>

<p>He almost regretted that he had given himself the trouble to
accept conversion and all that it entailed at the hands of the
Brethren of St. Dominic. It began to appear to him that he had but
wasted time and escaped the clerical fire to be dangled on a
secular rope as an offering to the vengeful gods of outraged
Spain.</p>

<p>So much, however, was not done. The galleys in the Mediterranean
were in urgent need of men at the time, and to this circumstance
Sir Oliver, Captain Leigh, and some others of the luckless crew of
the Swallow owed their lives, though it is to be doubted whether
any of them found the matter one for congratulation. Chained each
man to a fellow, ankle to ankle, with but a short length of links
between, they formed part of a considerable herd of unfortunates,
who were driven across Portugal into Spain and then southward to
Cadiz. The last that Sir Oliver saw of Captain Leigh was on the
morning on which he set out from the reeking Lisbon gaol.
Thereafter throughout that weary march each knew the other to be
somewhere in that wretched regiment of galley-slaves; but they
never came face to face again.</p>

<p>In Cadiz Sir Oliver spent a month in a vast enclosed space that
was open to the sky, but nevertheless of an indescribable foulness,
a place of filth, disease, and suffering beyond human conception,
the details of which the curious may seek for himself in my Lord
Henry's chronicles. They are too revolting by far to be retailed
here.</p>

<p>At the end of that month he was one of those picked out by an
officer who was manning a galley that was to convey the Infanta to
Naples. He owed this to his vigorous constitution which had
successfully withstood the infections of that mephitic place of
torments, and to the fine thews which the officer pummelled and
felt as though he were acquiring a beast of burden&mdash;which,
indeed, is precisely what he was doing.</p>

<p>The galley to which our gentleman was dispatched was a vessel of
fifty oars, each manned by seven men. They were seated upon a sort
of staircase that followed the slope of the oar, running from the
gangway in the vessel's middle down to the shallow bulwarks.</p>

<p>The place allotted to Sir Oliver was that next the gangway.
Here, stark naked as when he was born, he was chained to the bench,
and in those chains, let us say at once, he remained, without a
single moment's intermission, for six whole months.</p>

<p>Between himself and the hard timbers of his seat there was
naught but a flimsy and dirty sheepskin. From end to end the bench
was not more than ten feet in length, whilst the distance
separating it from the next one was a bare four feet. In that
cramped space of ten feet by four, Sir Oliver and his six oar-mates
had their miserable existence, waking and sleeping&mdash;for they
slept in their chains at the oar without sufficient room in which
to lie at stretch.</p>

<p>Anon Sir Oliver became hardened and inured to that unspeakable
existence, that living death of the galley-slave. But that first
long voyage to Naples was ever to remain the most terrible
experience of his life. For spells of six or eight endless hours at
a time, and on one occasion for no less than ten hours, did he pull
at his oar without a single moment's pause. With one foot on the
stretcher, the other on the bench in front of him, grasping his
part of that appallingly heavy fifteen-foot oar, he would bend his
back to thrust forward&mdash;and upwards so to clear the shoulders
of the groaning, sweating slaves in front of him&mdash;then he
would lift the end so as to bring the blade down to the water, and
having gripped he would rise from his seat to throw his full weight
into the pull, and so fall back with clank of chain upon the
groaning bench to swing forward once more, and so on until his
senses reeled, his sight became blurred, his mouth parched and his
whole body a living, straining ache. Then would come the sharp
fierce cut of the boatswain's whip to revive energies that flagged
however little, and sometimes to leave a bleeding stripe upon his
naked back.</p>

<p>Thus day in day out, now broiled and blistered by the pitiless
southern sun, now chilled by the night dews whilst he took his
cramped and unrefreshing rest, indescribably filthy and
dishevelled, his hair and beard matted with endless sweat, unwashed
save by the rains which in that season were all too rare, choked
almost by the stench of his miserable comrades and infested by
filthy crawling things begotten of decaying sheepskins and Heaven
alone knows what other foulnesses of that floating hell. He was
sparingly fed upon weevilled biscuit and vile messes of tallowy
rice, and to drink he was given luke-warm water that was often
stale, saving that sometimes when the spell of rowing was more than
usually protracted the boatswains would thrust lumps of bread
sodden in wine into the mouths of the toiling slaves to sustain
them.</p>

<p>The scurvy broke out on that voyage, and there were other
diseases among the rowers, to say nothing of the festering sores
begotten of the friction of the bench which were common to all, and
which each must endure as best he could. With the slave whose
disease conquered him or who, reaching the limit of his endurance,
permitted himself to swoon, the boat-swains had a short way. The
diseased were flung overboard; the swooning were dragged out upon
the gangway or bridge and flogged there to revive them; if they did
not revive they were flogged on until they were a horrid bleeding
pulp, which was then heaved into the sea.</p>

<p>Once or twice when they stood to windward the smell of the
slaves being wafted abaft and reaching the fine gilded poop where
the Infanta and her attendants travelled, the helmsmen were ordered
to put about, and for long weary hours the slaves would hold the
galley in position, backing her up gently against the wind so as
not to lose way.</p>

<p>The number that died in the first week of that voyage amounted
to close upon a quarter of the total. But there were reserves in
the prow, and these were drawn upon to fill the empty places. None
but the fittest could survive this terrible ordeal.</p>

<p>Of these was Sir Oliver, and of these too was his immediate
neighbour at the oar, a stalwart, powerful, impassive,
uncomplaining young Moor, who accepted his fate with a stoicism
that aroused Sir Oliver's admiration. For days they exchanged no
single word together, their religions marking them out, they
thought, for enemies despite the fact that they were fellows in
misfortune. But one evening when an aged Jew who had collapsed in
merciful unconsciousness was dragged out and flogged in the usual
manner, Sir Oliver, chancing to behold the scarlet prelate who
accompanied the Infanta looking on from the poop-rail with hard
unmerciful eyes, was filled with such a passion at all this
inhumanity and at the cold pitilessness of that professed servant
of the Gentle and Pitiful Saviour, that aloud he cursed all
Christians in general and that scarlet Prince of the Church in
particular.</p>

<p>He turned to the Moor beside him, and addressing him in
Spanish&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hell," he said, "was surely made for Christians, which may be
why they seek to make earth like it."</p>

<p>Fortunately for him the creak and dip of the oars, the clank of
chains, and the lashes beating sharply upon the wretched Jew were
sufficient to muffle his voice. But the Moor heard him, and his
dark eyes gleamed.</p>

<p>"There is a furnace seven times heated awaiting them, O my
brother," he replied, with a confidence which seemed to be the
source of his present stoicism. "But art thou, then, not a
Christian?"</p>

<p>He spoke in that queer language of the North African seaboard,
that lingua franca, which sounded like some French dialect
interspersed with Arabic words. But Sir Oliver made out his meaning
almost by intuition. He answered him in Spanish again, since
although the Moor did not appear to speak it yet it was plain he
understood it.</p>

<p>"I renounce from this hour," he answered in his passion. "I will
acknowledge no religion in whose name such things are done. Look me
at that scarlet fruit of hell up yonder. See how daintily he sniffs
at his pomander lest his saintly nostrils be offended by the
exhalations of our misery. Yet are we God's creatures made in God's
image like himself. What does he know of God? Religion he knows as
he knows good wine, rich food, and soft women. He preaches
self-denial as the way to heaven, and by his own tenets is he
damned." He growled an obscene oath as he heaved the great oar
forward. "A Christian I?" he cried, and laughed for the first time
since he had been chained to that bench of agony. "I am done with
Christians and Christianity!"</p>

<p>"Verily we are God's, and to Him shall we return," said the
Moor.</p>

<p>That was the beginning of a friendship between Sir Oliver and
this man, whose name was Yusuf-ben-Moktar. The Muslim conceived
that in Sir Oliver he saw one upon whom the grace of Allah had
descended, one who was ripe to receive the Prophet's message. Yusuf
was devout, and he applied himself to the conversion of his
fellow-slave. Sir Oliver listened to him, however, with
indifference. Having discarded one creed he would need a deal of
satisfying on the score of another before he adopted it, and it
seemed to him that all the glorious things urged by Yusuf in praise
of Islam he had heard before in praise of Christianity. But he kept
his counsel on that score, and meanwhile his intercourse with the
Muslim had the effect of teaching him the lingua franca, so that at
the end of six months he found himself speaking it like a
Mauretanian with all the Muslim's imagery and with more than the
ordinary seasoning of Arabic.</p>

<p>It was towards the end of that six months that the event took
place which was to restore Sir Oliver to liberty. In the meanwhile
those limbs of his which had ever been vigorous beyond the common
wont had acquired an elephantine strength. It was ever thus at the
oar. Either you died under the strain, or your thews and sinews
grew to be equal to their relentless task. Sir Oliver in those six
months was become a man of steel and iron, impervious to fatigue,
superhuman almost in his endurance.</p>

<p>They were returning home from a trip to Genoa when one evening
as they were standing off Minorca in the Balearic Isles they were
surprised by a fleet of four Muslim galleys which came skimming
round a promontory to surround and engage them.</p>

<p>Aboard the Spanish vessel there broke a terrible cry of
"Asad-ed-Din"&mdash;the name of the most redoubtable Muslim corsair
since the Italian renegade Ochiali&mdash;the Ali Pasha who had been
killed at Lepanto. Trumpets blared and drums beat on the poop, and
the Spaniards in morion and corselet, armed with calivers and
pikes, stood to defend their lives and liberty. The gunners sprang
to the culverins. But fire had to be kindled and linstocks ignited,
and in the confusion much time was lost&mdash;so much that not a
single cannon shot was fired before the grappling irons of the
first galley clanked upon and gripped the Spaniard's bulwarks. The
shock of the impact was terrific. The armoured prow of the Muslim
galley&mdash;Asad-ed-Din's own&mdash;smote the Spaniard a slanting
blow amidships that smashed fifteen of the oars as if they had been
so many withered twigs.</p>

<p>There was a shriek from the slaves, followed by such piteous
groans as the damned in hell may emit. Fully two score of them had
been struck by the shafts of their oars as these were hurled back
against them. Some had been killed outright, others lay limp and
crushed, some with broken backs, others with shattered limbs and
ribs.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver would assuredly have been of these but for the
warning, advice, and example of Yusuf, who was well versed in
galley-fighting and who foresaw clearly what must happen. He thrust
the oar upward and forward as far as it would go, compelling the
others at his bench to accompany his movement. Then he slipped down
upon his knees, released his hold of the timber, and crouched down
until his shoulders were on a level with the bench. He had shouted
to Sir Oliver to follow his example, and Sir Oliver without even
knowing what the manoeuvre should portend, but gathering its
importance from the other's urgency of tone, promptly obeyed. The
oar was struck an instant later and ere it snapped off it was flung
back, braining one of the slaves at the bench and mortally injuring
the others, but passing clean over the heads of Sir Oliver and
Yusuf. A moment later the bodies of the oarsmen of the bench
immediately in front were flung back atop of them with yells and
curses.</p>

<p>When Sir Oliver staggered to his feet he found the battle
joined. The Spaniards had fired a volley from their calivers and a
dense cloud of smoke hung above the bulwarks; through this surged
now the corsairs, led by a tall, lean, elderly man with a flowing
white beard and a swarthy eagle face. A crescent of emeralds
flashed from his snowy turban; above it rose the peak of a steel
cap, and his body was cased in chain mail. He swung a great
scimitar, before which Spaniards went down like wheat to the
reaper's sickle. He fought like ten men, and to support him poured
a never-ending stream of Muslimeen to the cry of "Din! Din! Allah,
Y'Allah!" Back and yet back went the Spaniards before that
irresistible onslaught.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver found Yusuf struggling in vain to rid himself of his
chain, and went to his assistance. He stooped, seized it in both
hands, set his feet against the bench, exerted all his strength,
and tore the staple from the wood. Yusuf was free, save, of course,
that a length of heavy chain was dangling from his steel anklet. In
his turn he did the like service by Sir Oliver, though not quite as
speedily, for strong man though he was, either his strength was not
equal to the Cornishman's or else the latter's staple had been
driven into sounder timber. In the end, however, it yielded, and
Sir Oliver too was free. Then he set the foot that was hampered by
the chain upon the bench, and with the staple that still hung from
the end of it he prised open the link that attached it to his
anklet.</p>

<p>That done he took his revenge. Crying "Din!" as loudly as any of
the Muslimeen boarders, he flung himself upon the rear of the
Spaniards brandishing his chain. In his hands it became a terrific
weapon. He used it as a scourge, lashing it to right and left of
him, splitting here a head and crushing there a face, until he had
hacked a way clean through the Spanish press, which bewildered by
this sudden rear attack made but little attempt to retaliate upon
the escaped galley-slave. After him, whirling the remaining ten
feet of the broken oar, came Yusuf.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver confessed afterwards to knowing very little of what
happened in those moments. He came to a full possession of his
senses to find the fight at an end, a cloud of turbaned corsairs
standing guard over a huddle of Spaniards, others breaking open the
cabin and dragging thence the chests that it contained, others
again armed with chisels and mallets passing along the benches
liberating the surviving slaves, of whom the great majority were
children of Islam.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver found himself face to face with the white-bearded
leader of the corsairs, who was leaning upon his scimitar and
regarding him with eyes at once amused and amazed. Our gentleman's
naked body was splashed from head to foot with blood, and in his
right hand he still clutched that yard of iron links with which he
had wrought such ghastly execution. Yusuf was standing at the
corsair leader's elbow speaking rapidly.</p>

<p>"By Allah, was ever such a lusty fighter seen!" cried the
latter. "The strength of the Prophet is within him thus to smite
the unbelieving pigs."</p>

<p>Sir Oliver grinned savagely.</p>

<p>"I was returning them some of their whip-lashes&mdash;with
interest," said he.</p>

<p>And those were the circumstances under which he came to meet the
formidable Asad-ed-Din, Basha of Algiers, those the first words
that passed between them.</p>

<p>Anon, when aboard Asad's own galley he was being carried to
Barbary, he was washed and his head was shaved all but the
forelock, by which the Prophet should lift him up to heaven when
his earthly destiny should come to be fulfilled. He made no
protest. They washed and fed him and gave him ease; and so that
they did these things to him they might do what else they pleased.
At last arrayed in flowing garments that were strange to him, and
with a turban wound about his head, he was conducted to the poop,
where Asad sat with Yusuf under an awning, and he came to
understand that it was in compliance with the orders of Yusuf that
he had been treated as if he were a True-Believer.</p>

<p>Yusuf-ben-Moktar was discovered as a person of great
consequence, the nephew of Asad-ed-Din, and a favourite with that
Exalted of Allah the Sublime Portal himself, a man whose capture by
Christians had been a thing profoundly deplored. Accordingly his
delivery from that thraldom was matter for rejoicing. Being
delivered, he bethought him of his oar-mate, concerning whom indeed
Asad-ed-Din manifested the greatest curiosity, for in all this
world there was nothing the old corsair loved so much as a fighter,
and in all his days, he vowed, never had he seen the equal of that
stalwart galley-slave, never the like of his performance with that
murderous chain. Yusuf had informed him that the man was a fruit
ripe for the Prophet's plucking, that the grace of Allah was upon
him, and in spirit already he must be accounted a good Muslim.</p>

<p>When Sir Oliver, washed, perfumed, and arrayed in white caftan
and turban, which gave him the air of being even taller than he
was, came into the presence of Asad-ed-Din, it was conveyed to him
that if he would enter the ranks of the Faithful of the Prophet's
House and devote the strength and courage with which Allah the One
had endowed him to the upholding of the true Faith and to the
chastening of the enemies of Islam, great honour, wealth and
dignity were in store for him.</p>

<p>Of all that proposal, made at prodigious length and with great
wealth of Eastern circumlocution, the only phrase that took root in
his rather bewildered mind was that which concerned the chastening
of the enemies of Islam. The enemies of Islam he conceived, were
his own enemies; and he further conceived that they stood in great
need of chastening, and that to take a hand in that chastening
would be a singularly grateful task. So he considered the proposals
made him. He considered, too, that the alternative&mdash;in the
event of his refusing to make the protestations of Faith required
of him&mdash;was that he must return to the oar of a galley, of a
Muslim galley now. Now that was an occupation of which he had had
more than his fill, and since he had been washed and restored to
the normal sensations of a clean human being he found that whatever
might be within the scope of his courage he could not envisage
returning to the oar. We have seen the ease with which he had
abandoned the religion in which he was reared for the Roman faith,
and how utterly deluded he had found himself. With the same degree
of ease did he now go over to Islam and with much greater profit.
Moreover, he embraced the Religion of Mahomet with a measure of
fierce conviction that had been entirely lacking from his earlier
apostasy.</p>

<p>He had arrived at the conclusion whilst aboard the galley of
Spain, as we have seen, that Christianity as practised in his day
was a grim mockery of which the world were better rid. It is not to
be supposed that his convictions that Christianity was at fault
went the length of making him suppose that Islam was right, or that
his conversion to the Faith of Mahomet was anything more than
superficial. But forced as he was to choose between the rower's
bench and the poop-deck, the oar and the scimitar, he boldly and
resolutely made the only choice that in his case could lead to
liberty and life.</p>

<p>Thus he was received into the ranks of the Faithful whose
pavilions wait them in Paradise, set in an orchard of never-failing
fruit, among rivers of milk, of wine, and of clarified honey. He
became the Kayia or lieutenant to Yusuf on the galley of that
corsair's command and seconded him in half a score of engagements
with an ability and a conspicuity that made him swiftly famous
throughout the ranks of the Mediterranean rovers. Some six months
later in a fight off the coast of Sicily with one of the galleys of
the Religion&mdash;as the vessels of the Knights of Malta were
called&mdash;Yusuf was mortally wounded in the very moment of the
victory. He died an hour later in the arms of Sir Oliver, naming
the latter his successor in the command of the galley, and
enjoining upon all implicit obedience to him until they should be
returned to Algiers and the Basha should make known his further
will in the matter.</p>

<p>The Basha's will was to confirm his nephew's dying appointment
of a successor, and Sir Oliver found himself in full command of a
galley. From that hour he became Oliver-Reis, but very soon his
valour and fury earned him the by-name of Sakr-el-Bahr, the Hawk of
the Sea. His fame grew rapidly, and it spread across the tideless
sea to the very shores of Christendom. Soon he became Asad's
lieutenant, the second in command of all the Algerine galleys,
which meant in fact that he was the commander-in-chief, for Asad
was growing old and took the sea more and more rarely now.
Sakr-el-Bahr sallied forth in his name and his stead, and such was
his courage, his address, and his good fortune that never did he go
forth to return empty-handed.</p>

<p>It was clear to all that the favour of Allah was upon him, that
he had been singled out by Allah to be the very glory of Islam.
Asad, who had ever esteemed him, grew to love him. An intensely
devout man, could he have done less in the case of one for whom the
Pitying the Pitiful showed so marked a predilection? It was freely
accepted that when the destiny of Asad-ed-Din should come to be
fulfilled, Sakr-el-Bahr must succeed him in the Bashalik of
Algiers, and that thus Oliver-Reis would follow in the footsteps of
Barbarossa, Ochiali, and other Christian renegades who had become
corsair-princes of Islam.</p>

<p>In spite of certain hostilities which his rapid advancement
begot, and of which we shall hear more presently, once only did his
power stand in danger of suffering a check. Coming one morning into
the reeking bagnio at Algiers, some six months after he had been
raised to his captaincy, he found there a score of countrymen of
his own, and he gave orders that their fetters should instantly be
struck off and their liberty restored them.</p>

<p>Called to account by the Basha for this action he took a
high-handed way, since no other was possible. He swore by the beard
of the Prophet that if he were to draw the sword of Mahomet and to
serve Islam upon the seas, he would serve it in his own way, and
one of his ways was that his own countrymen were to have immunity
from the edge of that same sword. Islam, he swore, should not be
the loser, since for every Englishman he restored to liberty he
would bring two Spaniards, Frenchmen, Greeks, or Italians into
bondage.</p>

<p>He prevailed, but only upon condition that since captured slaves
were the property of the state, if he desired to abstract them from
the state he must first purchase them for himself. Since they would
then be his own property he could dispose of them at his good
pleasure. Thus did the wise and just Asad resolve the difficulty
which had arisen, and Oliver-Reis bowed wisely to that
decision.</p>

<p>Thereafter what English slaves were brought to Algiers he
purchased, manumitted, and found means to send home again. True, it
cost him a fine price yearly, but he was fast amassing such wealth
as could easily support this tax.</p>

<p>As you read Lord Henry Goade's chronicles you might come to the
conclusion that in the whorl of that new life of his Sir Oliver had
entirely forgotten the happenings in his Cornish home and the woman
he had loved, who so readily had believed him guilty of the slaying
of her brother. You might believe this until you come upon the
relation of how he found one day among some English seamen brought
captive to Algiers by Biskaine-el-Borak&mdash;who was become his
own second in command&mdash;a young Cornish lad from Helston named
Pitt, whose father he had known.</p>

<p>He took this lad home with him to the fine palace which he
inhabited near the Bab-el-Oueb, treated him as an honoured guest,
and sat through a whole summer night in talk with him, questioning
him upon this person and that person, and thus gradually drawing
from him all the little history of his native place during the two
years that were sped since he had left it. In this we gather an
impression of the wistful longings, the fierce nostalgia that must
have overcome the renegade and his endeavours to allay it by his
endless questions. The Cornish lad had brought him up sharply and
agonizingly with that past of his upon which he had closed the door
when he became a Muslim and a corsair. The only possible inference
is that in those hours of that summer's night repentance stirred in
him, and a wild longing to return. Rosamund should reopen for him
that door which, hard-driven by misfortune, he had slammed. That
she would do so when once she knew the truth he had no faintest
doubt. And there was now no reason why he should conceal the truth,
why he should continue to shield that dastardly half-brother of
his, whom he had come to hate as fiercely as he had erstwhile loved
him.</p>

<p>In secret he composed a long letter giving the history of all
that had happened to him since his kidnapping, and setting forth
the entire truth of that and of the deed that had led to it. His
chronicler opines that it was a letter that must have moved a stone
to tears. And, moreover, it was not a mere matter of passionate
protestations of innocence, or of unsupported accusation of his
brother. It told her of the existence of proofs that must dispel
all doubt. It told her of that parchment indited by Master Baine
and witnessed by the parson, which document was to be delivered to
her together with the letter. Further, it bade her seek
confirmation of that document's genuineness, did she doubt it, at
the hands of Master Baine himself. That done, it besought her to
lay the whole matter before the Queen, and thus secure him faculty
to return to England and immunity from any consequences of his
subsequent regenade act to which his sufferings had driven him. He
loaded the young Cornishman with gifts, gave him that letter to
deliver in person, and added instructions that should enable him to
find the document he was to deliver with it. That precious
parchment had been left between the leaves of an old book on
falconry in the library at Penarrow, where it would probably be
found still undisturbed since his brother would not suspect its
presence and was himself no scholar. Pitt was to seek out Nicholas
at Penarrow and enlist his aid to obtain possession of that
document, if it still existed.</p>

<p>Then Sakr-el-Bahr found means to conduct Pitt to Genoa, and
there put him aboard an English vessel.</p>

<p>Three months later he received an answer&mdash;a letter from
Pitt, which reached him by way of Genoa&mdash;which was at peace
with the Algerines, and served then as a channel of communication
with Christianity. In this letter Pitt informed him that he had
done all that Sir Oliver had desired him; that he had found the
document by the help of Nicholas, and that in person he had waited
upon Mistress Rosamund Godolphin, who dwelt now with Sir John
Killigrew at Arwenack, delivering to her the letter and the
parchment; but that upon learning on whose behalf he came she had
in his presence flung both unopened upon the fire and dismissed him
with his tale untold.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr spent the night under the skies in his fragrant
orchard, and his slaves reported in terror that they had heard sobs
and weeping. If indeed his heart wept, it was for the last time;
thereafter he was more inscrutable, more ruthless, cruel and
mocking than men had ever known him, nor from that day did he ever
again concern himself to manumit a single English slave. His heart
was become a stone.</p>

<p>Thus five years passed, counting from that spring night when he
was trepanned by Jasper Leigh, and his fame spread, his name became
a terror upon the seas, and fleets put forth from Malta, from
Naples, and from Venice to make an end of him and his ruthless
piracy. But Allah kept watch over him, and Sakr-el-Bahr never
delivered battle but he wrested victory to the scimitars of
Islam.</p>

<p>Then in the spring of that fifth year there came to him another
letter from the Cornish Pitt, a letter which showed him that
gratitude was not as dead in the world as he supposed it, for it
was purely out of gratitude that the lad whom he had delivered from
thraldom wrote to inform him of certain matters that concerned him.
This letter reopened that old wound; it did more; it dealt him a
fresh one. He learnt from it that the writer had been constrained
by Sir John Killigrew to give such evidence of Sir Oliver's
conversion to Islam as had enabled the courts to pronounce Sir
Oliver as one to be presumed dead at law, granting the succession
to his half-brother, Master Lionel Tressilian. Pitt professed
himself deeply mortified at having been forced unwittingly to make
Sir Oliver so evil a return for the benefits received from him, and
added that sooner would he have suffered them to hang him than have
spoken could he have foreseen the consequences of his
testimony.</p>

<p>So far Sir Oliver read unmoved by any feeling other than cold
contempt. But there was more to follow. The letter went on to tell
him that Mistress Rosamund was newly returned from a two years'
sojourn in France to become betrothed to his half-brother Lionel,
and that they were to be wed in June. He was further informed that
the marriage had been contrived by Sir John Killigrew in his desire
to see Rosamund settled and under the protection of a husband,
since he himself was proposing to take the seas and was fitting out
a fine ship for a voyage to the Indies. The writer added that the
marriage was widely approved, and it was deemed to be an excellent
measure for both houses, since it would weld into one the two
contiguous estates of Penarrow and Godolphin Court.</p>

<p>Oliver-Reis laughed when he had read thus far. The marriage was
approved not for itself, it would seem, but because by means of it
two stretches of earth were united into one. It was a marriage of
two parks, of two estates, of two tracts of arable and forest, and
that two human beings were concerned in it was apparently no more
than an incidental circumstance.</p>

<p>Then the irony of it all entered his soul and spread it with
bitterness. After dismissing him for the supposed murder of her
brother, she was to take the actual murderer to her arms. And he,
that cur, that false villain!&mdash;out of what depths of hell did
he derive the courage to go through with this mummery?&mdash;had he
no heart, no conscience, no sense of decency, no fear of God?</p>

<p>He tore the letter into fragments and set about effacing the
matter from his thoughts. Pitt had meant kindly by him, but had
dealt cruelly. In his efforts to seek distraction from the
torturing images ever in his mind he took to the sea with three
galleys, and thus some two weeks later came face to face with
Master Jasper Leigh aboard the Spanish carack which he captured
under Cape Spartel.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2-3" id="ch2-3"></a>CHAPTER III &mdash; HOMEWARD
BOUND</h2>

<p>In the cabin of the captured Spaniard, Jasper Leigh found
himself that evening face to face with Sakr-el-Bahr, hailed thither
by the corsair's gigantic Nubians.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr had not yet pronounced his intentions concerning
the piratical little skipper, and Master Leigh, full conscious that
he was a villain, feared the worst, and had spent some miserable
hours in the fore-castle awaiting a doom which he accounted
foregone.</p>

<p>"Our positions have changed, Master Leigh, since last we talked
in a ship's cabin," was the renegade's inscrutable greeting.</p>

<p>"Indeed," Master Leigh agreed. "But I hope ye'll remember that
on that occasion I was your friend."</p>

<p>"At a price," Sakr-el-Bahr reminded him. "And at a price you may
find me your friend to-day."</p>

<p>The rascally skipper's heart leapt with hope.</p>

<p>"Name it, Sir Oliver," he answered eagerly. "And so that it lies
within my wretched power I swear I'll never boggle at it. I've had
enough of slavery," he ran on in a plaintive whine. "Five years of
it, and four of them spent aboard the galleys of Spain, and no day
in all of them but that I prayed for death. Did you but know what I
ha' suffered."</p>

<p>"Never was suffering more merited, never punishment more
fitting, never justice more poetic," said Sakr-el-Bahr in a voice
that made the skipper's blood run cold. "You would have sold me, a
man who did you no hurt, indeed a man who once befriended
you&mdash;you would have sold me into slavery for a matter of two
hundred pounds..."</p>

<p>"Nay, nay," cried the other fearfully, "as God's my witness,
'twas never part of my intent. Ye'll never ha' forgot the words I
spoke to you, the offer that I made to carry you back home
again."</p>

<p>"Ay, at a price, 'tis true," Sakr-el-Bahr repeated. "And it is
fortunate for you that you are to-day in a position to pay a price
that should postpone your dirty neck's acquaintance with a rope. I
need a navigator," he added in explanation, "and what five years
ago you would have done for two hundred pounds, you shall do to-day
for your life. How say you: will you navigate this ship for
me?"</p>

<p>"Sir," cried Jasper Leigh, who could scarce believe that this
was all that was required of him, "I'll sail it to hell at your
bidding."</p>

<p>"I am not for Spain this voyage," answered Sakr-el-Bahr. "You
shall sail me precisely as you would have done five years ago, back
to the mouth of the Fal, and set me ashore there. Is that
agreed?"</p>

<p>"Ay, and gladly," replied Master Leigh without a second's
pause.</p>

<p>"The conditions are that you shall have your life and your
liberty," Sakr-el-Bahr explained. "But do not suppose that arrived
in England you are to be permitted to depart. You must sail us back
again, though once you have done that I shall find a way to send
you home if you so desire it, and perhaps there will be some
measure of reward for you if you serve me faithfully throughout.
Follow the habits of a lifetime by playing me false and there's an
end to you. You shall have for constant bodyguard these two lilies
of the desert," and he pointed to the colossal Nubians who stood
there invisible almost in the shadow but for the flash of teeth and
eyeballs. "They shall watch over you, and see that no harm befalls
you so long as you are honest with me, and they shall strangle you
at the first sign of treachery. You may go. You have the freedom of
the ship, but you are not to leave it here or elsewhere save at my
express command."</p>

<p>Jasper Leigh stumbled out counting himself fortunate beyond his
expectations or deserts, and the Nubians followed him and hung
behind him ever after like some vast twin shadow.</p>

<p>To Sakr-el-Bahr entered now Biskaine with a report of the prize
captured. Beyond the prisoners, however, and the actual vessel,
which had suffered nothing in the fight, the cargo was of no
account. Outward bound as she was it was not to be expected that
any treasures would be discovered in her hold. They found great
store of armaments and powder and a little money; but naught else
that was worthy of the corsairs' attention.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr briefly issued his surprising orders.</p>

<p>"Thou'lt set the captives aboard one of the galleys, Biskaine,
and thyself convey them to Algiers, there to be sold. All else
thou'lt leave aboard here, and two hundred picked corsairs to go a
voyage with me overseas, men that will act as mariners and
fighters."</p>

<p>"Art thou, then, not returning to Algiers, O Sakr-el-Bahr?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. I am for a longer voyage. Convey my service to
Asad-ed-Din, whom Allah guard and cherish, and tell him to look for
me in some six weeks time."</p>

<p>This sudden resolve of Oliver-Reis created no little excitement
aboard the galleys. The corsairs knew nothing of navigation upon
the open seas, none of them had ever been beyond the Mediterranean,
few of them indeed had ever voyaged as far west as Cape Spartel,
and it is doubtful if they would have followed any other leader
into the perils of the open Atlantic. But Sakr-el-Bahr, the child
of Fortune, the protected of Allah, had never yet led them to aught
but victory, and he had but to call them to heel and they would
troop after him whithersoever he should think well to go. So now
there was little trouble in finding the two hundred Muslimeen he
desired for his fighting crew. Rather was the difficulty to keep
the number of those eager for the adventure within the bounds he
had indicated.</p>

<p>You are not to suppose that in all this Sir Oliver was acting
upon any preconcerted plan. Whilst he had lain on the heights
watching that fine ship beating up against the wind it had come to
him that with such a vessel under him it were a fond adventure to
sail to England, to descend upon that Cornish coast abruptly as a
thunderbolt, and present the reckoning to his craven dastard of a
brother. He had toyed with the fancy, dreamily almost as men build
their castles in Spain. Then in the heat of conflict it had
entirely escaped his mind, to return in the shape of a resolve when
he came to find himself face to face with Jasper Leigh.</p>

<p>The skipper and the ship conjointly provided him with all the
means to realize that dream he had dreamt. There was none to oppose
his will, no reason not to indulge his cruel fancy. Perhaps, too,
he might see Rosamund again, might compel her to hear the truth
from him. And there was Sir John Killigrew. He had never been able
to determine whether Sir John had been his friend or his foe in the
past; but since it was Sir John who had been instrumental in
setting up Lionel in Sir Oliver's place&mdash;by inducing the
courts to presume Sir Oliver's death on the score that being a
renegade he must be accounted dead at law&mdash;and since it was
Sir John who was contriving this wedding between Lionel and
Rosamund, why, Sir John, too, should be paid a visit and should be
informed of the precise nature of the thing he did.</p>

<p>With the forces at his disposal in those days of his absolute
lordship of life and death along the African littoral, to conceive
was with Oliver-Reis no more than the prelude to execution. The
habit of swift realization of his every wish had grown with him,
and that habit guided now his course.</p>

<p>He made his preparations quickly, and on the morrow the Spanish
carack&mdash;lately labelled Nuestra Senora de las Llagas, but with
that label carefully effaced from her quarter&mdash;trimmed her
sails and stood out for the open Atlantic, navigated by Captain
Jasper Leigh. The three galleys under the command of
Biskaine-el-Borak crept slowly eastward and homeward to Algiers,
hugging the coast, as was the corsair habit. The wind favoured
Oliver so well that within ten days of rounding Cape St. Vincent he
had his first glimpse of the Lizard.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2-4" id="ch2-4"></a>CHAPTER IV &mdash; THE RAID</h2>

<p>In the estuary of the River Fal a spendid ship, on the building
of which the most cunning engineers had been employed and no money
spared, rode proudly at anchor just off Smithick under the very
shadow of the heights crowned by the fine house of Arwenack. She
was fitting out for a distant vovage and for days the work of
bringing stores and munitions aboard had been in progress, so that
there was an unwonted bustle about the little forge and the huddle
of cottages that went to make up the fishing village, as if in
earnest of the great traffic that in future days was to be seen
about that spot. For Sir John Killigrew seemed at last to be on the
eve of prevailing and of laying there the foundations of the fine
port of his dreams.</p>

<p>To this state of things his friendship with Master Lionel
Tressilian had contributed not a little. The opposition made to his
project by Sir Oliver&mdash;and supported, largely at Sir Oliver's
suggestion, by Truro and Helston&mdash;had been entirely withdrawn
by Lionel; more, indeed Lionel had actually gone so far in the
opposite direction as to support Sir John in his representations to
Parliament and the Queen. It followed naturally enough that just as
Sir Oliver's opposition of that cherished project had been the seed
of the hostility between Arwenack and Penarrow, so Lionel's support
of it became the root of the staunch friendship that sprang up
between himself and Sir John.</p>

<p>What Lionel lacked of his brother's keen intelligence he made up
for in cunning. He realized that although at some future time it
was possible that Helston and Truro and the Tressilian property
there might come to suffer as a consequence of the development of a
port so much more advantageously situated, yet that could not be in
his own lifetime; and meanwhile he must earn in return Sir John's
support for his suit of Rosamund Godolphin and thus find the
Godolphin estates merged with his own. This certain immediate gain
was to Master Lionel well worth the other future possible loss.</p>

<p>It must not, however, be supposed that Lionel's courtship had
thenceforward run a smooth and easy course. The mistress of
Godolphin Court showed him no favour and it was mainly that she
might abstract herself from the importunities of his suit that she
had sought and obtained Sir John Killigrew's permission to
accompany the latter's sister to France when she went there with
her husband, who was appointed English ambassador to the Louvre.
Sir John's authority as her guardian had come into force with the
decease of her brother.</p>

<p>Master Lionel moped awhile in her absence; but cheered by Sir
John's assurance that in the end he should prevail, he quitted
Cornwall in his turn and went forth to see the world. He spent some
time in London about the Court, where, however, he seems to have
prospered little, and then he crossed to France to pay his devoirs
to the lady of his longings.</p>

<p>His constancy, the humility with which he made his suit, the
obvious intensity of his devotion, began at last to wear away that
gentlewoman's opposition, as dripping water wears away a stone. Yet
she could not bring herself to forget that he was Sir Oliver's
brother&mdash;the brother of the man she had loved, and the brother
of the man who had killed her own brother. Between them stood,
then, two things; the ghost of that old love of hers and the blood
of Peter Godolphin.</p>

<p>Of this she reminded Sir John on her return to Cornwall after an
absence of some two years, urging these matters as reasons why an
alliance between herself and Lionel Tressilian must be
impossible.</p>

<p>Sir John did not at all agree with her.</p>

<p>"My dear," he said, "there is your future to be thought of. You
are now of full age and mistress of your own actions. Yet it is not
well for a woman and a gentlewoman to dwell alone. As long as I
live, or as long as I remain in England, all will be well. You may
continue indefinitely your residence here at Arwenack, and you have
been wise, I think, in quitting the loneliness of Godolphin Court.
Yet consider that that loneliness may be yours again when I am not
here."</p>

<p>"I should prefer that loneliness to the company you would thrust
upon me," she answered him.</p>

<p>"Ungracious speech!" he protested. "Is this your gratitude for
that lad's burning devotion, for his patience, his gentleness, and
all the rest!"</p>

<p>"He is Oliver Tressilian's brother," she replied.</p>

<p>"And has he not suffered enough for that already? Is there to be
no end to the price that he must pay for his brother's sins?
Besides, consider that when all is said they are not even brothers.
They are but half-brothers."</p>

<p>"Yet too closely kin," she said. "If you must have me wed I beg
you'll find me another husband."</p>

<p>To this he would answer that expediently considered no husband
could be better than the one he had chosen her. He pointed out the
contiguity of their two estates, and how fine and advantageous a
thing it would be to merge these two into one.</p>

<p>He was persistent, and his persistence was increased when he
came to conceive his notion to take the seas again. His conscience
would not permit him to heave anchor until he had bestowed her
safely in wedlock. Lionel too was persistent, in a quiet, almost
self-effacing way that never set a strain upon her patience, and
was therefore the more difficult to combat.</p>

<p>In the end she gave way under the pressure of these men's wills,
and did so with the best grace she could summon, resolved to drive
from her heart and mind the one real obstacle of which, for very
shame, she had made no mention to Sir John. The fact is that in
spite of all, her love for Sir Oliver was not dead. It was stricken
down, it is true, until she herself failed to recognize it for what
it really was. But she caught herself thinking of him frequently
and wistfully; she found herself comparing him with his brother;
and for all that she had bidden Sir John find her some other
husband than Lionel, she knew full well that any suitor brought
before her must be submitted to that same comparison to his
inevitable undoing. All this she accounted evil in herself. It was
in vain that she lashed her mind with the reminder that Sir Oliver
was Peter's murderer. As time went on she found herself actually
making excuses for her sometime lover; she would admit that Peter
had driven him to the step, that for her sake Sir Oliver had
suffered insult upon insult from Peter, until, being but human, the
cup of his endurance had overflowed in the end, and weary of
submitting to the other's blows he had risen up in his anger and
smitten in his turn.</p>

<p>She would scorn herself for such thoughts as these, yet she
could not dismiss them. In act she could be strong&mdash;as witness
how she had dealt with that letter which Oliver sent her out of
Barbary by the hand of Pitt&mdash;but her thoughts she could not
govern, and her thoughts were full often traitors to her will.
There were longings in her heart for Oliver which she could not
stifle, and there was ever the hope that he would one day return,
although she realized that from such a return she might look for
nothing.</p>

<p>When Sir John finally slew the hope of that return he did a
wiser thing than he conceived. Never since Oliver's disappearance
had they heard any news of him until Pitt came to Arwenack with
that letter and his story. They had heard, as had all the world, of
the corsair Sakr-el-Bahr, but they had been far indeed from
connecting him with Oliver Tressilian. Now that his identity was
established by Pitt's testimony, it was an easy matter to induce
the courts to account him dead and to give Lionel the coveted
inheritance.</p>

<p>This to Rosamund was a small matter. But a great one was that
Sir Oliver was dead at law, and must be so in fact, should he ever
again set foot in England. It extinguished finally that curiously
hopeless and almost subconscious hope of hers that one day he would
return. Thus it helped her perhaps to face and accept the future
which Sir John was resolved to thrust upon her.</p>

<p>Her betrothal was made public, and she proved if not an ardently
loving, at least a docile and gentle mistress to Lionel. He was
content. He could ask no more in reason at the moment, and he was
buoyed up by every lover's confidence that given opportunity and
time he could find the way to awaken a response. And it must be
confessed that already during their betrothal he gave some proof of
his reason for his confidence. She had been lonely, and he
dispelled her loneliness by his complete surrender of himself to
her; his restraint and his cautious, almost insidious creeping
along a path which a more clumsy fellow would have taken at a dash
made companionship possible between them and very sweet to her.
Upon this foundation her affection began gradually to rise, and
seeing them together and such excellent friends, Sir John
congratulated himself upon his wisdom and went about the fitting
out of that fine ship of his&mdash;the Silver Heron&mdash;for the
coming voyage.</p>

<p>Thus they came within a week of the wedding, and Sir John all
impatience now. The marriage bells were to be his signal for
departure; as they fell silent the Silver Heron should spread her
wings.</p>

<p>It was the evening of the first of June; the peal of the curfew
had faded on the air and lights were being set in the great
dining-room at Arwenack where the company was to sup. It was a
small party. Just Sir John and Rosamund and Lionel, who had
lingered on that day, and Lord Henry Goade&mdash;our
chronicler&mdash;the Queen's Lieutenant of Cornwall, together with
his lady. They were visiting Sir John and they were to remain yet a
week his guests at Arwenack that they might grace the coming
nuptials.</p>

<p>Above in the house there was great stir of preparation for the
departure of Sir John and his ward, the latter into wedlock, the
former into unknown seas. In the turret chamber a dozen
sempstresses were at work upon the bridal outfit under the
directions of that Sally Pentreath who had been no less assiduous
in the preparation of swaddling clothes and the like on the eve of
Rosamund's appearance in this world.</p>

<p>At the very hour at which Sir John was leading his company to
table Sir Oliver Tressilian was setting foot ashore not a mile
away.</p>

<p>He had deemed it wiser not to round Pendennis Point. So in the
bay above Swanpool on the western side of that promontory he had
dropped anchor as the evening shadows were deepening. He had
launched the ship's two boats, and in these he had conveyed some
thirty of his men ashore. Twice had the boats returned, until a
hundred of his corsairs stood ranged along that foreign beach. The
other hundred he left on guard aboard. He took so great a force
upon an expedition for which a quarter of the men would have
sufficed so as to ensure by overwhelming numbers the avoidance of
all unnecessary violence.</p>

<p>Absolutely unobserved he led them up the slope towards Arwenack
through the darkness that had now closed in. To tread his native
soil once more went near to drawing tears from him. How familiar
was the path he followed with such confidence in the night; how
well known each bush and stone by which he went with his silent
multitude hard upon his heels. Who could have foretold him such a
return as this.</p>

<p>Who could have dreamt when he roamed amain in his youth here
with dogs and fowling-piece that he would creep one night over
these dunes a renegade Muslim leading a horde of infidels to storm
the house of Sir John Killigrew of Arwenack?</p>

<p>Such thoughts begot a weakness in him; but he made a quick
recovery when his mind swung to all that he had so unjustly
suffered, when he considered all that he came thus to avenge.</p>

<p>First to Arwenack to Sir John and Rosamund to compel them to
hear the truth at least, and then away to Penarrow for Master
Lionel and the reckoning. Such was the project that warmed him,
conquered his weakness and spurred him, relentless, onward and
upward to the heights and the fortified house that dominated
them.</p>

<p>He found the massive iron-studded gates locked, as was to have
been expected at that hour. He knocked, and presently the postern
gaped, and a lantern was advanced. Instantly that lantern was
dashed aside and Sir Oliver had leapt over the sill into the
courtyard. With a hand gripping the porter's throat to choke all
utterance, Sir Oliver heaved him out to his men, who swiftly gagged
him.</p>

<p>That done they poured silently through that black gap of the
postern into the spacious gateway. On he led them, at a run almost,
towards the tall mullioned windows whence a flood of golden light
seemed invitingly to beckon them.</p>

<p>With the servants who met them in the hall they dealt in the
same swift silent fashion as they had dealt with the gatekeeper,
and such was the speed and caution of their movements that Sir John
and his company had no suspicion of their presence until the door
of the dining-room crashed open before their eyes.</p>

<p>The sight which they beheld was one that for some moments left
them mazed and bewildered. Lord Henry tells us how at first he
imagined that here was some mummery, some surprise prepared for the
bridal couple by Sir John's tenants or the folk of Smithick and
Penycumwick, and he adds that he was encouraged in this belief by
the circumstance that not a single weapon gleamed in all that horde
of outlandish intruders.</p>

<p>Although they came full armed against any eventualities, yet by
their leader's orders not a blade was bared. What was to do was to
be done with their naked hands alone and without bloodshed. Such
were the orders of Sakr-el-Bahr, and Sakr-el-Bahr's were not orders
to be disregarded.</p>

<p>Himself he stood forward at the head of that legion of
brown-skinned men arrayed in all the colours of the rainbow, their
heads swathed in turbans of every hue. He considered the company in
grim silence, and the company in amazement considered this turbaned
giant with the masterful face that was tanned to the colour of
mahogany, the black forked beard, and those singularly light eyes
glittering like steel under his black brows.</p>

<p>Thus a little while in silence, then with a sudden gasp Lionel
Tressilian sank back in his tall chair as if bereft of
strength.</p>

<p>The agate eyes flashed upon him smiling, cruelly.</p>

<p>"I see that you, at least, recognize me," said Sakr-el-Bahr in
his deep voice. "I was assured I could depend upon the eyes of
brotherly love to pierce the change that time and stress have
wrought in me."</p>

<p>Sir John was on his feet, his lean swarthy face flushing darkly,
an oath on his lips. Rosamund sat on as if frozen with horror,
considering Sir Oliver with dilating eyes, whilst her hands clawed
the table before her. They too recognized him now, and realized
that here was no mummery. That something sinister was intended Sir
John could not for a moment doubt. But of what that something might
be he could form no notion. It was the first time that Barbary
rovers were seen in England. That famous raid of theirs upon
Baltimore in Ireland did not take place until some thirty years
after this date.</p>

<p>"Sir Oliver Tressilian!" Killigrew gasped, and "Sir Oliver
Tressilian!" echoed Lord Henry Goade, to add "By God!"</p>

<p>"Not Sir Oliver Tressilian," came the answer, "but Sakr-el-Bahr,
the scourge of the sea, the terror of Christendom, the desperate
corsair your lies, cupidity, and false-heartedness have fashioned
out of a sometime Cornish gentleman." He embraced them all in his
denunciatory gesture. "Behold me here with my sea-hawks to present
a reckoning long overdue."</p>

<p>Writing now of what his own eyes beheld, Lord Henry tells us how
Sir John leapt to snatch a weapon from the armoured walls; how
Sakr-el-Bahr barked out a single word in Arabic, and how at that
word a half-dozen of his supple blackamoors sprang upon the knight
like greyhounds upon a hare and bore him writhing to the
ground.</p>

<p>Lady Henry screamed; her husband does not appear to have done
anything, or else modesty keeps him silent on the score of it.
Rosamund, white to the lips, continued to look on, whilst Lionel,
overcome, covered his face with his hands in sheer horror. One and
all of them expected to see some ghastly deed of blood performed
there, coldly and callously as the wringing of a capon's neck. But
no such thing took place. The corsairs merely turned Sir John upon
his face, dragged his wrists behind him to make them fast, and
having performed that duty with a speedy, silent dexterity they
abandoned him.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr watched their performance with those grimly smiling
eyes of his. When it was done he spoke again and pointed to Lionel,
who leapt up in sudden terror, with a cry that was entirely
inarticulate. Lithe brown arms encircled him like a legion of
snakes. Powerless, he was lifted in the air and borne swiftly away.
For an instant he found himself held face to face with his turbaned
brother. Into that pallid terror-stricken human mask the renegade's
eyes stabbed like two daggers. Then deliberately and after the
fashion of the Muslim he was become he spat upon it.</p>

<p>"Away!" he growled, and through the press of corsairs that
thronged the hall behind him a lane was swiftly opened and Lionel
was swallowed up, lost to the view of those within the room.</p>

<p>"What murderous deed do you intend?" cried Sir John indomitably.
He had risen and stood grimly dignified in his bonds.</p>

<p>"Will you murder your own brother as you murdered mine?"
demanded Rosamund, speaking now for the first time, and rising as
she spoke, a faint flush coming to overspread her pallor. She saw
him wince; she saw the mocking lustful anger perish in his face,
leaving it vacant for a moment. Then it became grim again with a
fresh resolve. Her words had altered all the current of his
intentions. They fixed in him a dull, fierce rage. They silenced
the explanations which he was come to offer, and which he scorned
to offer here after that taunt.</p>

<p>"It seems you love that&mdash;whelp, that thing that was my
brother," he said, sneering. "I wonder will you love him still when
you come to be better acquainted with him? Though, faith, naught
would surprise me in a woman and her love. Yet I am curious to
see&mdash;curious to see." He laughed. "I have a mind to gratify
myself. I will not separate you&mdash;not just yet."</p>

<p>He advanced upon her. "Come thou with me, lady," he commanded,
and held out his hand.</p>

<p>And now Lord Henry seems to have been stirred to futile
action.</p>

<p>"At that," he writes, "I thrust myself between to shield her.
'Thou dog,' I cried,'thou shalt be made to suffer!'</p>

<p>"'Suffer?' quoth he, and mocked me with his deep laugh. 'I have
suffered already. 'Tis for that reason I am here.'</p>

<p>"'And thou shalt suffer again, thou pirate out of hell!' I
warned him. 'Thou shalt suffer for this outrage as God's my
life!'</p>

<p>"'Shall I so?' quoth he, very calm and sinister. 'And at whose
hands, I pray you?'</p>

<p>"'At mine, sir,' I roared, being by now stirred to a great
fury.</p>

<p>"'At thine?' he sneered. 'Thou'lt hunt the hawk of the sea?
Thou? Thou plump partridge! Away! Hinder me not!'"</p>

<p>And he adds that again Sir Oliver spoke that short Arabic
command, whereupon a dozen blackamoors whirled the Queen's
Lieutenant aside and bound him to a chair.</p>

<p>Face to face stood now Sir Oliver with Rosamund&mdash;face to
face after five long years, and he realized that in every moment of
that time the certainty had never departed from him of some such
future meeting.</p>

<p>"Come, lady," he bade her sternly.</p>

<p>A moment she looked at him with hate and loathing in the clear
depths of her deep blue eyes. Then swiftly as lightning she
snatched a knife from the board and drove it at his heart. But his
hand moved as swiftly to seize her wrist, and the knife clattered
to the ground, its errand unfulfilled.</p>

<p>A shuddering sob escaped her then to express at once her horror
of her own attempt and of the man who held her. That horror
mounting until it overpowered her, she sank suddenly against him in
a swoon.</p>

<p>Instinctively his arms went round her, and a moment he held her
thus, recalling the last occasion on which she had lain against his
breast, on an evening five years and more ago under the grey wall
of Godolphin Court above the river. What prophet could have told
him that when next he so held her the conditions would be these? It
was all grotesque and incredible, like the fantastic dream of some
sick mind. But it was all true, and she was in his arms again.</p>

<p>He shifted his grip to her waist, heaved her to his mighty
shoulder, as though she were a sack of grain, and swung about, his
business at Arwenack accomplished&mdash;indeed, more of it
accomplished than had been his intent, and also something less.</p>

<p>"Away, away!" he cried to his rovers, and away they sped as
fleetly and silently as they had come, no man raising now so much
as a voice to hinder them.</p>

<p>Through the hall and across the courtyard flowed that human
tide; out into the open and along the crest of the hill it surged,
then away down the slope towards the beach where their boats
awaited them. Sakr-el-Bahr ran as lightly as though the swooning
woman he bore were no more than a cloak he had flung across his
shoulder. Ahead of him went a half-dozen of his fellows carrying
his gagged and pinioned brother.</p>

<p>Once only before they dipped from the heights of Arwenack did
Oliver check. He paused to look across the dark shimmering water to
the woods that screened the house of Penarrow from his view. It had
been part of his purpose to visit it, as we know. But the necessity
had now been removed, and he was conscious of a pang of
disappointment, of a hunger to look again upon his home. But to
shift the current of his thoughts just then came two of his
officers&mdash;Othmani and Ali, who had been muttering one with the
other. As they overtook him, Othmani set now a hand upon his arm,
and pointed down towards the twinkling lights of Smithick and
Penycumwick.</p>

<p>"My lord," he cried, "there will be lads and maidens there
should fetch fat prices in the sk-el-Abeed."</p>

<p>"No doubt," said Sakr-el-Bahr, scarce heeding him, heeding
indeed little in this world but his longings to look upon
Penarrow.</p>

<p>"Why, then, my lord, shall I take fifty True-Believers and make
a raid upon them? It were an easy task, all unsuspicious as they
must be of our presence."</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr came out of his musings. "Othmani," said he, "art a
fool, the very father of fools, else wouldst thou have come to know
by now that those who once were of my own race, those of the land
from which I am sprung, are sacred to me. Here we take no slave but
these we have. On, then, in the name of Allah!"</p>

<p>But Othmani was not yet silenced. "And is our perilous voyage
across these unknown seas into this far heathen land to be rewarded
by no more than just these two captives? Is that a raid worthy of
Sakr-el-Bahr?"</p>

<p>"Leave Sakr-el-Bahr to judge," was the curt answer.</p>

<p>"But reflect, my lord: there is another who will judge. How
shall our Basha, the glorious Asad-ed-Din, welcome thy return with
such poor spoils as these? What questions will he set thee, and
what account shalt thou render him for having imperilled the lives
of all these True-Believers upon the seas for so little
profit?"</p>

<p>"He shall ask me what he pleases, and I shall answer what I
please and as Allah prompts me. On, I say!"</p>

<p>And on they went, Sakr-el-Bahr conscious now of little but the
warmth of that body upon his shoulder, and knowing not, so
tumultuous were his emotions, whether it fired him to love or
hate.</p>

<p>They gained the beach; they reached the ship whose very presence
had continued unsuspected. The breeze was fresh and they stood away
at once. By sunrise there was no more sign of them than there had
been at sunset, there was no more clue to the way they had taken
than to the way they had come. It was as if they had dropped from
the skies in the night upon that Cornish coast, and but for the
mark of their swift, silent passage, but for the absence of
Rosamund and Lionel Tressilian, the thing must have been accounted
no more than a dream of those few who had witnessed it.</p>

<p>Aboard the carack, Sakr-el-Bahr bestowed Rosamund in the cabin
over the quarter, taking the precaution to lock the door that led
to the stern-gallery. Lionel he ordered to be dropped into a dark
hole under the hatchway, there to lie and meditate upon the
retribution that had overtaken him until such time as his brother
should have determined upon his fate&mdash;for this was a matter
upon which the renegade was still undecided.</p>

<p>Himself he lay under the stars that night and thought of many
things. One of these things, which plays some part in the story,
though it is probable that it played but a slight one in his
thoughts, was begotten of the words Othmani had used. What, indeed,
would be Asad's welcome of him on his return if he sailed into
Algiers with nothing more to show for that long voyage and the
imperilling of the lives of two hundred True-Believers than just
those two captives whom he intended, moreover, to retain for
himself? What capital would not be made out of that circumstance by
his enemies in Algiers and by Asad's Sicilian wife who hated him
with all the bitterness of a hatred that had its roots in the
fertile soil of jealousy?</p>

<p>This may have spurred him in the cool dawn to a very daring and
desperate enterprise which Destiny sent his way in the shape of a
tall-masted Dutchman homeward bound. He gave chase, for all that he
was full conscious that the battle he invited was one of which his
corsairs had no experience, and one upon which they must have
hesitated to venture with another leader than himself. But the star
of Sakr-el-Bahr was a star that never led to aught but victory, and
their belief in him, the very javelin of Allah, overcame any doubts
that may have been begotten of finding themselves upon an
unfamiliar craft and on a rolling, unfamiliar sea.</p>

<p>This fight is given in great detail by my Lord Henry from the
particulars afforded him by Jasper Leigh. But it differs in no
great particular from other sea-fights, and it is none of my
purpose to surfeit you with such recitals. Enough to say that it
was stern and fierce, entailing great loss to both combatants; that
cannon played little part in it, for knowing the quality of his men
Sakr-el-Bahr made haste to run in and grapple. He prevailed of
course as he must ever prevail by the very force of his personality
and the might of his example. He was the first to leap aboard the
Dutchman, clad in mail and whirling his great scimitar, and his men
poured after him shouting his name and that of Allah in a
breath.</p>

<p>Such was ever his fury in an engagement that it infected and
inspired his followers. It did so now, and the shrewd Dutchmen came
to perceive that this heathen horde was as a body to which he
supplied the brain and soul. They attacked him fiercely in groups,
intent at all costs upon cutting him down, convinced almost by
instinct that were he felled the victory would easily be theirs.
And in the end they succeeded. A Dutch pike broke some links of his
mail and dealt him a flesh wound which went unheeded by him in his
fury; a Dutch rapier found the breach thus made in his de-fences,
and went through it to stretch him bleeding upon the deck. Yet he
staggered up, knowing as full as did they that if he succumbed then
all was lost. Armed now with a short axe which he had found under
his hand when he went down, he hacked a way to the bulwarks, set
his back against the timbers, and hoarse of voice, ghastly of face,
spattered with the blood of his wound he urged on his men until the
victory was theirs&mdash;and this was fortunately soon. And then,
as if he had been sustained by no more than the very force of his
will, he sank down in a heap among the dead and wounded huddled
against the vessel's bulwarks.</p>

<p>Grief-stricken his corsairs bore him back aboard the carack.
Were he to die then was their victory a barren one indeed. They
laid him on a couch prepared for him amidships on the main deck,
where the vessel's pitching was least discomfiting. A Moorish
surgeon came to tend him, and pronounced his hurt a grievous one,
but not so grievous as to close the gates of hope.</p>

<p>This pronouncement gave the corsairs all the assurance they
required. It could not be that the Gardener could already pluck so
fragrant a fruit from Allah's garden. The Pitiful must spare
Sakr-el-Bahr to continue the glory of Islam.</p>

<p>Yet they were come to the straits of Gibraltar before his fever
abated and he recovered complete consciousness, to learn of the
final issue of that hazardous fight into which he had led those
children of the Prophet.</p>

<p>The Dutchman, Othmani informed him, was following in their wake,
with Ali and some others aboard her, steering ever in the wake of
the carack which continued to be navigated by the Nasrani dog,
Jasper Leigh. When Sakr-el-Bahr learnt the value of the capture,
when he was informed that in addition to a hundred able-bodied men
under the hatches, to be sold as slaves in the sk-el-Abeed, there
was a cargo of gold and silver, pearls, amber, spices, and ivory,
and such lesser matters as gorgeous silken fabrics, rich beyond
anything that had ever been seen upon the seas at any one time, he
felt that the blood he had shed had not been wasted.</p>

<p>Let him sail safely into Algiers with these two ships both
captured in the name of Allah and his Prophet, one of them an
argosy so richly fraught, a floating treasure-house, and he need
have little fear of what his enemies and the crafty evil Sicilian
woman might have wrought against him in his absence.</p>

<p>Then he made inquiry touching his two English captives, to be
informed that Othmani had taken charge of them, and that he had
continued the treatment meted out to them by Sakr-el-Bahr himself
when first they were brought aboard.</p>

<p>He was satisfied, and fell into a gentle healing sleep, whilst,
on the decks above, his followers rendered thanks to Allah the
Pitying the Pitiful, the Master of the Day of Judgment, who Alone
is All-Wise, All-Knowing.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2-5" id="ch2-5"></a>CHAPTER V &mdash; THE LION OF
THE FAITH</h2>

<p>Asad-ed-Din, the Lion of the Faith, Basha of Algiers, walked in
the evening cool in the orchard of the Kasbah upon the heights
above the city, and at his side, stepping daintily, came Fenzileh,
his wife, the first lady of his hareem, whom eighteen years ago he
had carried off in his mighty arms from that little whitewashed
village above the Straits of Messina which his followers had
raided.</p>

<p>She had been a lissom maid of sixteen in those far-off days, the
child of humble peasant-folk, and she had gone uncomplaining to the
arms of her swarthy ravisher. To-day, at thirty-four, she was still
beautiful, more beautiful indeed than when first she had fired the
passion of Asad-Reis&mdash;as he then was, one of the captains of
the famous Ali-Basha. There were streaks of red in her heavy black
tresses, her skin was of a soft pearliness that seemed translucent,
her eyes were large, of a golden-brown, agleam with sombre fires,
her lips were full and sensuous. She was tall and of a shape that
in Europe would have been accounted perfect, which is to say that
she was a thought too slender for Oriental taste; she moved along
beside her lord with a sinuous, languorous grace, gently stirring
her fan of ostrich plumes. She was unveiled; indeed it was her
immodest habit to go naked of face more often than was seemly,
which is but the least of the many undesirable infidel ways which
had survived her induction into the Faith of Islam&mdash;a
necessary step before Asad, who was devout to the point of bigotry,
would consent to make her his wife. He had found her such a wife as
it is certain he could never have procured at home; a woman who,
not content to be his toy, the plaything of his idle hour,
insinuated herself into affairs, demanded and obtained his
confidences, and exerted over him much the same influence as the
wife of a European prince might exert over her consort. In the
years during which he had lain under the spell of her ripening
beauty he had accepted the situation willingly enough; later, when
he would have curtailed her interferences, it was too late; she had
taken a firm grip of the reins, and Asad was in no better case than
many a European husband&mdash;an anomalous and outrageous condition
this for a Basha of the Prophet's House. It was also a dangerous
one for Fenzileh; for should the burden of her at any time become
too heavy for her lord there was a short and easy way by which he
could be rid of it. Do not suppose her so foolish as not to have
realized this&mdash;she realized it fully; but her Sicilian spirit
was daring to the point of recklessness; her very dauntlessness
which had enabled her to seize a control so unprecedented in a
Muslim wife urged her to maintain it in the face of all risks.</p>

<p>Dauntless was she now, as she paced there in the cool of the
orchard, under the pink and white petals of the apricots, the
flaming scarlet of pomegranate blossoms, and through orange-groves
where the golden fruit glowed and amid foliage of sombre green. She
was at her eternal work of poisoning the mind of her lord against
Sakr-el-Bahr, and in her maternal jealousy she braved the dangers
of such an undertaking, fully aware of how dear to the heart of
Asad-ed-Din was that absent renegade corsair. It was this very
affection of the Basha's for his lieutenant that was the fomenter
of her own hate of Sakr-el-Bahr, for it was an affection that
transcended Asad's love for his own son and hers, and it led to the
common rumour that for Sakr-el-Bahr was reserved the high destiny
of succeeding Asad in the Bashalik.</p>

<p>"I tell thee thou'rt abused by him, O source of my life."</p>

<p>"I hear thee," answered Asad sourly. "And were thine own hearing
less infirm, woman, thou wouldst have heard me answer thee that thy
words weigh for naught with me against his deeds. Words may be but
a mask upon our thoughts; deeds are ever the expression of them.
Bear thou that in mind, O Fenzileh."</p>

<p>"Do I not bear in mind thine every word, O fount of wisdom?" she
protested, and left him, as she often did, in doubt whether she
fawned or sneered. "And it is his deeds I would have speak for him,
not indeed my poor words and still less his own."</p>

<p>"Then, by the head of Allah, let those same deeds speak, and be
thou silent."</p>

<p>The harsh tone of his reproof and the scowl upon his haughty
face, gave her pause for a moment. He turned about.</p>

<p>"Come!" he said. "Soon it will be the hour of prayer." And he
paced back towards the yellow huddle of walls of the Kasbah that
overtopped the green of that fragrant place.</p>

<p>He was a tall, gaunt man, stooping slightly at the shoulders
under the burden of his years; but his eagle face was masterful,
and some lingering embers of his youth still glowed in his dark
eyes. Thoughtfully, with a jewelled hand, he stroked his long white
beard; with the other he leaned upon her soft plump arm, more from
habit than for support, for he was full vigorous still.</p>

<p>High in the blue overhead a lark burst suddenly into song, and
from the depths of the orchard came a gentle murmur of doves as if
returning thanks for the lessening of the great heat now that the
sun was sinking rapidly towards the world's edge and the shadows
were lengthening.</p>

<p>Came Fenzileh's voice again, more musical than either, yet laden
with words of evil, poison wrapped in honey.</p>

<p>"O my dear lord, thou'rt angered with me now. Woe me! that never
may I counsel thee for thine own glory as my heart prompts me, but
I must earn thy coldness."</p>

<p>"Abuse not him I love," said the Basha shortly. "I have told
thee so full oft already."</p>

<p>She nestled closer to him, and her voice grew softer, more akin
to the amorous cooing of the doves. "And do I not love thee, O
master of my soul? Is there in all the world a heart more faithful
to thee than mine? Is not thy life my life? Have not my days been
all devoted to the perfecting of thine happiness? And wilt thou
then frown upon me if I fear for thee at the hands of an intruder
of yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Fear for me?" he echoed, and laughed jeeringly. "What shouldst
thou fear for me from Sakr-el-Bahr?"</p>

<p>"What all believers must ever fear from one who is no true
Muslim, from one who makes a mock and travesty of the True Faith
that he may gain advancement."</p>

<p>The Basha checked in his stride, and turned upon her
angrily.</p>

<p>"May thy tongue rot, thou mother of lies!"</p>

<p>"I am as the dust beneath thy feet, O my sweet lord, yet am I
not what thine heedless anger calls me."</p>

<p>"Heedless?" quoth he. "Not heedless but righteous to hear one
whom the Prophet guards, who is the very javelin of Islam against
the breast of the unbeliever, who carries the scourge of Allah
against the infidel Frankish pigs, so maligned by thee! No more, I
say! Lest I bid thee make good thy words, and pay the liar's price
if thou shouldst fail."</p>

<p>"And should I fear the test?" she countered, nothing daunted. "I
tell thee, O father of Marzak, that I should hail it gladly. Why,
hear me now. Thou settest store by deeds, not words. Tell me, then,
is it the deed of a True-Believer to waste substance upon infidel
slaves, to purchase them that he may set them free?"</p>

<p>Asad moved on in silence. That erstwhile habit of Sakr-el-Bahr's
was one not easy to condone. It had occasioned him his moments of
uneasiness, and more than once had he taxed his lieutenant with the
practice ever to receive the same answer, the answer which he now
made to Fenzileh. "For every slave that he so manumitted, he
brought a dozen into bondage."</p>

<p>"Perforce, else would he be called to account. 'Twas so much
dust he flung into the face of true Muslimeen. Those manumissions
prove a lingering fondness for the infidel country whence he
springs. Is there room for that in the heart of a true member of
the Prophet's immortal House? Hast ever known me languish for the
Sicilian shore from which in thy might thou wrested me, or have I
ever besought of thee the life of a single Sicilian infidel in all
these years that I have lived to serve thee? Such longings are
betrayed, I say, by such a practice, and such longings could have
no place in one who had uprooted infidelity from his heart. And now
this voyage of his beyond the seas&mdash;risking a vessel that he
captured from the arch-enemy of Islam, which is not his to risk but
thine in whose name he captured it; and together with it he
imperils the lives of two hundred True-Believers. To what end? To
bear him overseas, perchance that he may look again upon the
unhallowed land that gave him birth. So Biskaine reported. And what
if he should founder on the way?"</p>

<p>"Thou at least wouldst be content, thou fount of malice,"
growled Asad.</p>

<p>"Call me harsh names, O sun that warms me! Am I not thine to use
and abuse at thy sweet pleasure? Pour salt upon the heart thou
woundest; since it is thy hand I'll never murmur a complaint. But
heed me&mdash;heed my words; or since words are of no account with
thee, then heed his deeds which I am drawing to thy tardy notice.
Heed them, I say, as my love bids me even though thou shouldst give
me to be whipped or slain for my temerity."</p>

<p>"Woman, thy tongue is like the clapper of a bell with the devil
swinging from the rope. What else dost thou impute?"</p>

<p>"Naught else, since thou dost but mock me, withdrawing thy love
from thy fond slave."</p>

<p>"The praise to Allah, then," said he. "Come, it is the hour of
prayer!"</p>

<p>But he praised Allah too soon. Woman-like, though she protested
she had done, she had scarce begun as yet.</p>

<p>"There is thy son, O father of Marzak."</p>

<p>"There is, O mother of Marzak."</p>

<p>"And a man's son should be the partner of his soul. Yet is
Marzak passed over for this foreign upstart; yet does this Nasrani
of yesterday hold the place in thy heart and at thy side that
should be Marzak's."</p>

<p>"Could Marzak fill that place," he asked. "Could that beardless
boy lead men as Sakr-el-Bahr leads them, or wield the scimitar
against the foes of Islam and increase as Sakr-el-Bahr increases
the glory of the Prophet's Holy Law upon the earth?"</p>

<p>"If Sakr-el-Bahr does this, he does it by thy favour, O my lord.
And so might Marzak, young though he be. Sakr-el-Bahr is but what
thou hast made him&mdash;no more, no less."</p>

<p>"There art thou wrong, indeed, O mother of error. Sakr-el-Bahr
is what Allah hath made him. He is what Allah wills. He shall
become what Allah wills. Hast yet to learn that Allah has bound the
fate of each man about his neck?"</p>

<p>And then a golden glory suffused the deep sapphire of the sky
heralding the setting of the sun and made an end of that
altercation, conducted by her with a daring as singular as the
patience that had endured it. He quickened his steps in the
direction of the courtyard. That golden glow paled as swiftly as it
had spread, and night fell as suddenly as if a curtain had been
dropped.</p>

<p>In the purple gloom that followed the white cloisters of the
courtyard glowed with a faintly luminous pearliness. Dark forms of
slaves stirred as Asad entered from the garden followed by
Fenzileh, her head now veiled in a thin blue silken gauze. She
flashed across the quadrangle and vanished through one of the
archways, even as the distant voice of a Mueddin broke plaintively
upon the brooding stillness reciting the Shehad&mdash;</p>

<p>"La illaha, illa Allah! Wa Muhammad er Rasool Allah!"</p>

<p>A slave spread a carpet, a second held a great silver bowl, into
which a third poured water. The Basha, having washed, turned his
face towards Mecca, and testified to the unity of Allah, the
Compassionate, the Merciful, King of the Day of judgment, whilst
the cry of the Mueddin went echoing over the city from minaret to
minaret.</p>

<p>As he rose from his devotions, there came a quick sound of steps
without, and a sharp summons. Turkish janissaries of the Basha's
guard, invisible almost in their flowing black garments, moved to
answer that summons and challenge those who came.</p>

<p>From the dark vaulted entrance of the courtyard leapt a gleam of
lanterns containing tiny clay lamps in which burned a wick that was
nourished by mutton fat. Asad, waiting to learn who came, halted at
the foot of the white glistening steps, whilst from doors and
lattices of the palace flooded light to suffuse the courtyard and
set the marbles shimmering.</p>

<p>A dozen Nubian javelin-men advanced, then ranged themselves
aside whilst into the light stepped the imposing, gorgeously robed
figure of Asad's wazeer, Tsamanni. After him came another figure in
mail that clanked faintly and glimmered as he moved.</p>

<p>"Peace and the Prophet's blessings upon thee, O mighty Asad!"
was the wazeer's greeting.</p>

<p>"And peace upon thee, Tsamanni," was the answer. "Art the bearer
of news?"</p>

<p>"Of great and glorious tidings, O exalted one! Sakr-el-Bahr is
returned."</p>

<p>"The praise to Him!" exclaimed the Basha, with uplifted hands;
and there was no mistaking the thrill of his voice.</p>

<p>There fell a soft step behind him and a shadow from the doorway.
He turned. A graceful stripling in turban and caftan of cloth of
gold salaamed to him from the topmast step. And as he came upright
and the light of the lanterns fell full upon his face the
astonishingly white fairness of it was revealed&mdash;a woman's
face it might have been, so softly rounded was it in its
beardlessness.</p>

<p>Asad smiled wrily in his white beard, guessing that the boy had
been sent by his ever-watchful mother to learn who came and what
the tidings that they bore.</p>

<p>"Thou hast heard, Marzak?" he said. "Sakr-el-Bahr is
returned."</p>

<p>"Victoriously, I hope," the lad lied glibly.</p>

<p>"Victorious beyond aught that was ever known," replied Tsamanni.
"He sailed at sunset into the harbour, his company aboard two
mighty Frankish ships, which are but the lesser part of the great
spoil he brings."</p>

<p>"Allah is great," was the Basha's glad welcome of this answer to
those insidious promptings of his Sicilian wife. "Why does he not
come in person with his news?"</p>

<p>"His duty keeps him yet awhile aboard, my lord," replied the
wazeer. "But he hath sent his kayia Othmani here to tell the tale
of it."</p>

<p>"Thrice welcome be thou, Othmani." He beat his hands together,
whereat slaves placed cushions for him upon the ground. He sat, and
beckoned Marzak to his side. "And now thy tale!"</p>

<p>And Othmani standing forth related how they had voyaged to
distant England in the ship that Sakr-el-Bahr had captured, through
seas that no corsair yet had ever crossed, and how on their return
they had engaged a Dutchman that was their superior in strength and
numbers; how none the less Sakr-el-Bahr had wrested victory by the
help of Allah, his protector, how he had been dealt a wound that
must have slain any but one miraculously preserved for the greater
glory of Islam, and of the surpassing wealth of the booty which at
dawn tomorrow should be laid at Asad's feet for his division of
it.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2-6" id="ch2-6"></a>CHAPTER VI &mdash; THE
CONVERT</h2>

<p>That tale of Othmani's being borne anon to Fenzileh by her son
was gall and wormwood to her jealous soul. Evil enough to know that
Sakr-el-Bahr was returned in spite of the fervent prayers for his
foundering which she had addressed both to the God of her
forefathers and to the God of her adoption. But that he should have
returned in triumph bringing with him heavy spoils that must exalt
him further in the affection of Asad and the esteem of the people
was bitterness indeed. It left her mute and stricken, bereft even
of the power to curse him.</p>

<p>Anon, when her mind recovered from the shock she turned it to
the consideration of what at first had seemed a trivial detail in
Othmani's tale as reported by Marzak.</p>

<p>"It is most singularly odd that he should have undertaken that
long voyage to England to wrest thence just those two captives;
that being there he should not have raided in true corsair fashion
and packed his ship with slaves. Most singularly odd!"</p>

<p>They were alone behind the green lattices through which filtered
the perfumes of the garden and the throbbing of a nightingale's
voice laden with the tale of its love for the rose. Fenzileh
reclined upon a divan that was spread with silken Turkey carpets,
and one of her gold-embroidered slippers had dropped from her
henna-stained toes. Her lovely arms were raised to support her
head, and she stared up at the lamp of many colours that hung from
the fretted ceiling.</p>

<p>Marzak paced the length of the chamber back and forth, and there
was silence save for the soft swish of his slippers along the
floor.</p>

<p>"Well?" she asked him impatiently at last. "Does it not seem odd
to thee?"</p>

<p>"Odd, indeed, O my mother," the youth replied, coming to a halt
before her.</p>

<p>"And canst think of naught that was the cause of it?"</p>

<p>"The cause of it?" quoth he, his lovely young face, so closely
modelled upon her own, looking blank and vacant.</p>

<p>"Ay, the cause of it," she cried impatiently. "Canst do naught
but stare? Am I the mother of a fool? Wilt thou simper and gape and
trifle away thy days whilst that dog-descended Frank tramples thee
underfoot, using thee but as a stepping-stone to the power that
should be thine own? And that be so, Marzak, I would thou hadst
been strangled in my womb."</p>

<p>He recoiled before the Italian fury of her, was dully resentful
even, suspecting that in such words from a woman were she twenty
times his mother, there was something dishonouring to his
manhood.</p>

<p>"What can I do?" he cried.</p>

<p>"Dost ask me? Art thou not a man to think and act? I tell thee
that misbegotten son of a Christian and a Jew will trample thee in
the dust. He is greedy as the locust, wily as the serpent, and
ferocious as the panther. By Allah! I would I had never borne a
son. Rather might men point at me the finger of scorn and call me
mother of the wind than that I should have brought forth a man who
knows not how to be a man."</p>

<p>"Show me the way," he cried. "Set me a task; tell me what to do
and thou shalt not find me lacking, O my mother. Until then spare
me these insults, or I come no more to thee."</p>

<p>At this threat that strange woman heaved herself up from her
soft couch. She ran to him and flung her arms about his neck, set
her cheek against his own. Not eighteen years in the Basha's hareem
had stifled the European mother in her, the passionate Sicilian
woman, fierce as a tiger in her maternal love.</p>

<p>"O my child, my lovely boy," she almost sobbed. "It is my fear
for thee that makes me harsh. If I am angry it is but my love that
speaks, my rage for thee to see another come usurping the place
beside thy father that should be thine. Ah! but we will prevail,
sweet son of mine. I shall find a way to return that foreign offal
to the dung-heap whence it sprang. Trust me, O Marzak! Sh! Thy
father comes. Away! Leave me alone with him."</p>

<p>She was wise in that, for she knew that alone Asad was more
easily controlled by her, since the pride was absent which must
compel him to turn and rend her did she speak so before others.
Marzak vanished behind the screen of fretted sandalwood that masked
one doorway even as Asad loomed in the other.</p>

<p>He came forward smiling, his slender brown fingers combing his
long beard, his white djellaba trailing behind him along the
ground.</p>

<p>"Thou hast heard, not a doubt, O Fenzileh," said he. "Art thou
answered enough?"</p>

<p>She sank down again upon her cushions and idly considered
herself in a steel mirror set in silver.</p>

<p>"Answered?" she echoed lazily, with infinite scorn and a hint of
rippling contemptuous laughter running through the word. "Answered
indeed. Sakr-el-Bahr risks the lives of two hundred children of
Islam and a ship that being taken was become the property of the
State upon a voyage to England that has no object but the capturing
of two slaves&mdash;two slaves, when had his purpose been sincere,
it might have been two hundred."</p>

<p>"Ha! And is that all that thou hast heard?" he asked her mocking
in his turn.</p>

<p>"All that signifies," she replied, still mirroring herself. "I
heard as a matter of lesser import that on his return, meeting
fortuitously a Frankish ship that chanced to be richly laden, he
seized it in thy name."</p>

<p>"Fortuitously, sayest thou?"</p>

<p>"What else?" She lowered the mirror, and her bold, insolent eyes
met his own quite fearlessly. "Thou'lt not tell me that it was any
part of his design when he went forth?"</p>

<p>He frowned; his head sank slowly in thought. Observing the
advantage gained she thrust it home. "It was a lucky wind that blew
that Dutchman into his path, and luckier still her being so richly
fraught that he may dazzle thine eyes with the sight of gold and
gems, and so blind thee to the real purpose of his voyage."</p>

<p>"Its real purpose?" he asked dully. "What was its real purpose?"
She smiled a smile of infinite knowledge to hide her utter
ignorance, her inability to supply even a reason that should wear
an air of truth.</p>

<p>"Dost ask me, O perspicuous Asad? Are not thine eyes as sharp,
thy wits as keen at least as mine, that what is clear to me should
be hidden from thee? Or hath this Sakr-el-Bahr bewitched thee with
enchantments of Babyl?"</p>

<p>He strode to her and caught her wrist in a cruelly rough grip of
his sinewy old hand.</p>

<p>"His purpose, thou jade! Pour out the foulness of thy mind.
Speak!"</p>

<p>She sat up, flushed and defiant.</p>

<p>"I will not speak," said she.</p>

<p>"Thou wilt not? Now, by the Head of Allah! dost dare to stand
before my face and defy me, thy Lord? I'll have thee whipped,
Fenzileh. I have been too tender of thee these many years&mdash;so
tender that thou hast forgot the rods that await the disobedient
wife. Speak then ere thy flesh is bruised or speak thereafter, at
thy pleasure."</p>

<p>"I will not," she repeated. "Though I be flung to the hooks, not
another word will I say of Sakr-el-Bahr. Shall I unveil the truth
to be spurned and scorned and dubbed a liar and the mother of
lies?" Then abruptly changing she fell to weeping. "O source of my
life!" she cried to him, "how cruelly unjust to me thou art!" She
was grovelling now, a thing of supplest grace, her lovely arms
entwining his knees. "When my love for thee drives me to utter what
I see, I earn but thy anger, which is more than I can endure. I
swoon beneath the weight of it."</p>

<p>He flung her off impatiently. "What a weariness is a woman's
tongue!" he cried, and stalked out again, convinced from past
experiences that did he linger he would be whelmed in a torrent of
words.</p>

<p>But her poison was shrewdly administered, and slowly did its
work. It abode in his mind to torture him with the doubts that were
its very essence. No reason, however well founded, that she might
have urged for Sakr-el-Bahr's strange conduct could have been half
so insidious as her suggestion that there was a reason. It gave him
something vague and intangible to consider. Something that he could
not repel since it had no substance he could grapple with.
Impatiently he awaited the morning and the coming of Sakr-el-Bahr
himself, but he no longer awaited it with the ardent whole-hearted
eagerness as of a father awaiting the coming of a beloved son.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr himself paced the poop deck of the carack and
watched the lights perish one by one in the little town that
straggled up the hillside before him. The moon came up and bathed
it in a white hard light, throwing sharp inky shadows of rustling
date palm and spearlike minaret, and flinging shafts of silver
athwart the peaceful bay.</p>

<p>His wound was healed and he was fully himself once more. Two
days ago he had come on deck for the first time since the fight
with the Dutchman, and he had spent there the greater portion of
the time since then. Once only had he visited his captives. He had
risen from his couch to repair straight to the cabin in the poop
where Rosamund was confined. He had found her pale and very
wistful, but with her courage entirely unbroken. The Godolphins
were a stiff-necked race, and Rosamund bore in her frail body the
spirit of a man. She looked up when he entered, started a little in
surprise to see him at last, for it was the first time he stood
before her since he had carried her off from Arwenack some four
weeks ago. Then she had averted her eyes, and sat there, elbows on
the table, as if carved of wood, as if blind to his presence and
deaf to his words.</p>

<p>To the expressions of regret&mdash;and they were sincere, for
already he repented him his unpremeditated act so far as she was
concerned&mdash;she returned no slightest answer, gave no sign
indeed that she heard a word of it. Baffled, he stood gnawing his
lip a moment, and gradually, unreasonably perhaps, anger welled up
from his heart. He turned and went out again. Next he had visited
his brother, to consider in silence a moment the haggard,
wild-eyed, unshorn wretch who shrank and cowered before him in the
consciousness of guilt. At last he returned to the deck, and there,
as I have said, he spent the greater portion of the last three days
of that strange voyage, reclining for the most part in the sun and
gathering strength from its ardour.</p>

<p>To-night as he paced under the moon a stealthy shadow crept up
the companion to call him gently by his English name&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir Oliver!"</p>

<p>He started as if a ghost had suddenly leapt up to greet him. It
was Jasper Leigh who hailed him thus.</p>

<p>"Come up," he said. And when the fellow stood before him on the
poop&mdash;"I have told you already that here is no Sir Oliver. I
am Oliver-Reis or Sakr-el-Bahr, as you please, one of the Faithful
of the Prophet's House. And now what is your will?"</p>

<p>"Have I not served you faithfully and well?" quoth Captain
Leigh.</p>

<p>"Who has denied it?"</p>

<p>"None. But neither has any acknowledged it. When you lay wounded
below it had been an easy thing for me to ha' played the traitor. I
might ha' sailed these ships into the mouth of Tagus. I might so by
God!"</p>

<p>"You'ld have been carved in pieces on the spot," said
Sakr-el-Bahr.</p>

<p>"I might have hugged the land and run the risk of capture and
then claimed my liberation from captivity."</p>

<p>"And found yourself back on the galleys of his Catholic Majesty.
But there! I grant that you have dealt loyally by me. You have kept
your part of the bond. I shall keep mine, never doubt it."</p>

<p>"I do not. But your part of the bond was to send me home
again."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"The hell of it is that I know not where to find a home, I know
not where home may be after all these years. If ye send me forth, I
shall become a wanderer of no account."</p>

<p>"What else am I to do with you?"</p>

<p>"Faith now I am as full weary of Christians and Christendom as
you was yourself when the Muslims took the galley on which you
toiled. I am a man of parts, Sir Oliver-Sakr-el-Bahr. No better
navigator ever sailed a ship from an English port, and I ha' seen a
mort o' fighting and know the art of it upon the sea. Can ye make
naught of me here?"</p>

<p>"You would become a renegade like me?" His tone was bitter.</p>

<p>"I ha' been thinking that 'renegade' is a word that depends upon
which side you're on. I'd prefer to say that I've a wish to be
converted to the faith of Mahound."</p>

<p>"Converted to the faith of piracy and plunder and robbery upon
the seas is what you mean," said Sakr-el-Bahr.</p>

<p>"Nay, now. To that I should need no converting, for all that I
were afore," Captain Leigh admitted frankly. "I ask but to sail
under another flag than the Jolly Roger."</p>

<p>"You'll need to abjure strong drink," said Sakr-el-Bahr.</p>

<p>"There be compensations," said Master Leigh.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr considered. The rogue's appeal smote a responsive
chord in his heart. It would be good to have a man of his own race
beside him, even though it were but such a rascal as this.</p>

<p>"Be it as you will," he said at last. "You deserve to be hanged
in spite of what promises I made you. But no matter for that. So
that you become a Muslim I will take you to serve beside me, one of
my own lieutenants to begin with, and so long as you are loyal to
me, Jasper, all will be well. But at the first sign of
faithlessness, a rope and the yard-arm, my friend, and an airy
dance into hell for you."</p>

<p>The rascally skipper stooped in his emotion, caught up
Sakr-el-Bahr's hand and bore it to his lips. "It is agreed," he
said. "Ye have shown me mercy who have little deserved it from you.
Never fear for my loyalty. My life belongs to you, and worthless
thing though it may be, ye may do with it as ye please."</p>

<p>Despite himself Sakr-el-Bahr tightened his grip upon the rogue's
hand, and Jasper shuffled off and down the companion again, touched
to the heart for once in his rough villainous life by a clemency
that he knew to be undeserved, but which he swore should be
deserved ere all was done.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2-7" id="ch2-7"></a>CHAPTER VII &mdash;
MARZAK-BEN-ASAD</h2>

<p>It took no less than forty camels to convey the cargo of that
Dutch argosy from the mole to the Kasbah, and the
procession&mdash;carefully marshalled by Sakr-el-Bahr, who knew the
value of such pageants to impress the mob&mdash;was such as never
yet had been seen in the narrow streets of Algiers upon the return
of any corsair. It was full worthy of the greatest Muslim conqueror
that sailed the seas, of one who, not content to keep to the
tideless Mediterranean as had hitherto been the rule of his kind,
had ventured forth upon the wider ocean.</p>

<p>Ahead marched a hundred of his rovers in their short caftans of
every conceivable colour, their waists swathed in gaudy scarves,
some of which supported a very arsenal of assorted cutlery; many
wore body armour of mail and the gleaming spike of a casque thrust
up above their turbans. After them, dejected and in chains, came
the five score prisoners taken aboard the Dutchman, urged along by
the whips of the corsairs who flanked them. Then marched another
regiment of corsairs, and after these the long line of stately,
sneering camels, shuffling cumbrously along and led by shouting
Saharowis. After them followed yet more corsairs, and then mounted,
on a white Arab jennet, his head swathed in a turban of cloth of
gold, came Sakr-el-Bahr. In the narrower streets, with their white
and yellow washed houses, which presented blank windowless walls
broken here and there by no more than a slit to admit light and
air, the spectators huddled themselves fearfully into doorways to
avoid being crushed to death by the camels, whose burdens bulging
on either side entirely filled those narrow ways. But the more open
spaces, such as the strand on either side of the mole, the square
before the sk, and the approaches of Asad's fortress, were
thronged with a motley roaring crowd. There were stately Moors in
flowing robes cheek by jowl with half-naked blacks from the Sus and
the Draa; lean, enduring Arabs in their spotless white djellabas
rubbed shoulders with Berbers from the highlands in black
camel-hair cloaks; there were Levantine Turks, and Jewish refugees
from Spain ostentatiously dressed in European garments, tolerated
there because bound to the Moor by ties of common suffering and
common exile from that land that once had been their own.</p>

<p>Under the glaring African sun this amazing crowd stood assembled
to welcome Sakr-el-Bahr; and welcome him it did, with such vocal
thunder that an echo of it from the mole reached the very Kasbah on
the hilltop to herald his approach.</p>

<p>By the time, however, that he reached the fortress his
procession had dwindled by more than half. At the sk his forces
had divided, and his corsairs, headed by Othmani, had marched the
captives away to the bagnio&mdash;or banyard, as my Lord Henry
calls it&mdash;whilst the camels had continued up the hill. Under
the great gateway of the Kasbah they padded into the vast courtyard
to be ranged along two sides of it by their Saharowi drivers, and
there brought clumsily to their knees. After them followed but some
two score corsairs as a guard of honour to their leader. They took
their stand upon either side of the gateway after profoundly
salaaming to Asad-ed-Din. The Basha sat in the shade of an awning
enthroned upon a divan, attended by his wazeer Tsamanni and by
Marzak, and guarded by a half-dozen janissaries, whose sable
garments made an effective background to the green and gold of his
jewelled robes. In his white turban glowed an emerald cresent.</p>

<p>The Basha's countenance was dark and brooding as he watched the
advent of that line of burdened camels. His thoughts were still
labouring with the doubt of Sakr-el-Bahr which Fenzileh's crafty
speech and craftier reticence had planted in them. But at sight of
the corsair leader himself his countenance cleared suddenly, his
eyes sparkled, and he rose to his feet to welcome him as a father
might welcome a son who had been through perils on a service dear
to both.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr entered the courtyard on foot, having dismounted at
the gate. Tall and imposing, with his head high and his forked
beard thrusting forward, he stalked with great dignity to the foot
of the divan followed by Ali and a mahogany-faced fellow, turbaned
and red-bearded, in whom it needed more than a glance to recognize
the rascally Jasper Leigh, now in all the panoply of your complete
renegado.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr went down upon his knees and prostrated himself
solemnly before his prince.</p>

<p>"The blessing of Allah and His peace upon thee, my lord," was
his greeting.</p>

<p>And Asad, stooping to lift that splendid figure in his arms,
gave him a welcome that caused the spying Fenzileh to clench her
teeth behind the fretted lattice that concealed her.</p>

<p>"The praise to Allah and to our Lord Mahomet that thou art
returned and in health, my son. Already hath my old heart been
gladdened by the news of thy victories in the service of the
Faith."</p>

<p>Then followed the display of all those riches wrested from the
Dutch, and greatly though Asad's expectations had been fed already
by Othmani, the sight now spread before his eyes by far exceeded
all those expectations.</p>

<p>In the end all was dismissed to the treasury, and Tsamanni was
bidden to go cast up the account of it and mark the share that fell
to the portion of those concerned&mdash;for in these ventures all
were partners, from the Basha himself, who represented the State
down to the meanest corsair who had manned the victorious vessels
of the Faith, and each had his share of the booty, greater or less
according to his rank, one twentieth of the total falling to
Sakr-el-Bahr himself.</p>

<p>In the courtyard were left none but Asad, Marzak and the
janissaries, and Sakr-el-Bahr with Ali and Jasper. It was then that
Sakr-el-Bahr presented his new officer to the Basha as one upon
whom the grace of Allah had descended, a great fighter and a
skilled seaman, who had offered up his talents and his life to the
service of Islam, who had been accepted by Sakr-el-Bahr, and stood
now before Asad to be confirmed in his office.</p>

<p>Marzak interposed petulantly, to exclaim that already were there
too many erstwhile Nasrani dogs in the ranks of the soldiers of the
Faith, and that it was unwise to increase their number and
presumptuous in Sakr-el-Bahr to take so much upon himself.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr measured him with an eye in which scorn and
surprise were nicely blended.</p>

<p>"Dost say that it is presumptuous to win a convert to the banner
of Our Lord Mahomet?" quoth he. "Go read the Most Perspicuous Book
and see what is there enjoined as a duty upon every True-Believer.
And bethink thee, O son of Asad, that when thou dost in thy little
wisdom cast scorn upon those whom Allah has blessed and led from
the night wherein they dwelt into the bright noontide of Faith,
thou dost cast scorn upon me and upon thine own mother, which is
but a little matter, and thou dost blaspheme the Blessed name of
Allah, which is to tread the ways that lead unto the Pit."</p>

<p>Angry but defeated and silenced, Marzak fell back a step and
stood biting his lip and glowering upon the corsair, what time Asad
nodded his head and smiled approval.</p>

<p>"Verily art thou full learned in the True Belief, Sakr-el-Bahr,"
he said. "Thou art the very father of wisdom as of valour." And
thereupon he gave welcome to Master Leigh, whom he hailed to the
ranks of the Faithful under the designation of Jasper-Reis.</p>

<p>That done, the renegade and Ali were both dismissed, as were
also the janissaries, who, quitting their position behind Asad,
went to take their stand on guard at the gateway. Then the Basha
beat his hands together, and to the slaves who came in answer to
his summons he gave orders to set food, and he bade Sakr-el-Bahr to
come sit beside him on the divan.</p>

<p>Water was brought that they might wash. That done, the slaves
placed before them a savoury stew of meat and eggs with olives,
limes, and spices.</p>

<p>Asad broke bread with a reverently pronounced "Bismillah!" and
dipped his fingers into the earthenware bowl, leading the way for
Sakr-el-Bahr and Marzak, and as they ate he invited the corsair
himself to recite the tale of his adventure.</p>

<p>When he had done so, and again Asad had praised him in high and
loving terms, Marzak set him a question.</p>

<p>"Was it to obtain just these two English slaves that thou didst
undertake this perilous voyage to that distant land?"</p>

<p>"That was but a part of my design," was the calm reply. "I went
to rove the seas in the Prophet's service, as the result of my
voyage gives proof."</p>

<p>"Thou didst not know that this Dutch argosy would cross thy
path," said Marzak, in the very words his mother had prompted
him.</p>

<p>"Did I not?" quoth Sakr-el-Bahr, and he smiled confidently, so
confidently that Asad scarce needed to hear the words that so
cunningly gave the lie to the innuendo. "Had I no trust in Allah
the All-wise, the All-knowing?"</p>

<p>"Well answered, by the Koran!" Asad approved him heartily, the
more heartily since it rebutted insinuations which he desired above
all to hear rebutted.</p>

<p>But Marzak did not yet own himself defeated. He had been soundly
schooled by his guileful Sicilian mother.</p>

<p>"Yet there is something in all this I do not understand," he
murmured, with false gentleness.</p>

<p>"All things are possible to Allah!" said Sakr-el-Bahr, in tones
of incredulity, as if he suggested&mdash;not without a suspicion of
irony&mdash;that it was incredible there should be anything in all
the world that could elude the penetration of Marzak.</p>

<p>The youth bowed to him in acknowledgment. "Tell me, O mighty
Sakr-el-Bahr," he begged, "how it came to pass that having reached
those distant shores thou wert content to take thence but two poor
slaves, since with thy followers and the favour of the All-seeing
thou might easily have taken fifty times that number." And he
looked ingenuously into the corsair's swarthy, rugged face, whilst
Asad frowned thoughtfully, for the thought was one that had
occurred to him already.</p>

<p>It became necessary that Sakr-el-Bahr should lie to clear
himself. Here no high-sounding phrase of Faith would answer. And
explanation was unavoidable, and he was conscious that he could not
afford one that did not go a little lame.</p>

<p>"Why, as to that," said he, "these prisoners were wrested from
the first house upon which we came, and their capture occasioned
some alarm. Moreover, it was night-time when we landed, and I dared
not adventure the lives of my followers by taking them further from
the ship and attacking a village which might have risen to cut off
our good retreat."</p>

<p>The frown remained stamped upon the brow of Asad, as Marzak
slyly observed.</p>

<p>"Yet Othmani," said he, "urged thee to fall upon a slumbering
village all unconscious of thy presence, and thou didst
refuse."</p>

<p>Asad looked up sharply at that, and Sakr-el-Bahr realized with a
tightening about the heart something of the undercurrents at work
against him and all the pains that had been taken to glean
information that might be used to his undoing.</p>

<p>"Is it so?" demanded Asad, looking from his son to his
lieutenant with that lowering look that rendered his face evil and
cruel.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr took a high tone. He met Asad's glance with an eye
of challenge.</p>

<p>"And if it were so my lord?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I asked thee is it so?"</p>

<p>"Ay, but knowing thy wisdom I disbelieved my ears," said
Sakr-el-Bahr. "Shall it signify what Othmani may have said? Do I
take my orders or am I to be guided by Othmani? If so, best set
Othmani in my place, give him the command and the responsibility
for the lives of the Faithful who fight beside him." He ended with
an indignant snort.</p>

<p>"Thou art over-quick to anger," Asad reproved him, scowling
still.</p>

<p>"And by the Head of Allah, who will deny my right to it? Am I to
conduct such an enterprise as this from which I am returned laden
with spoils that might well be the fruits of a year's raiding, to
be questioned by a beardless stripling as to why I was not guided
by Othmani?"</p>

<p>He heaved himself up and stood towering there in the intensity
of a passion that was entirely simulated. He must bluster here, and
crush down suspicion with whorling periods and broad, fierce
gesture.</p>

<p>"To what should Othmani have guided me?" he demanded scornfully.
"Could he have guided me to more than I have this day laid at thy
feet? What I have done speaks eloquently with its own voice. What
he would have had me do might well have ended in disaster. Had it
so ended, would the blame of it have fallen upon Othmani? Nay, by
Allah! but upon me. And upon me rests then the credit, and let none
dare question it without better cause."</p>

<p>Now these were daring words to address to the tyrant Asad, and
still more daring was the tone, the light hard eyes aflash and the
sweeping gestures of contempt with which they were delivered. But
of his ascendancy over the Basha there was no doubt. And here now
was proof of it.</p>

<p>Asad almost cowered before his fury. The scowl faded from his
face to be replaced by an expression of dismay.</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, Sakr-el-Bahr, this tone!" he cried.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr, having slammed the door of conciliation in the
face of the Basha, now opened it again. He became instantly
submissive.</p>

<p>"Forgive it," he said. "Blame the devotion of thy servant to
thee and to the Faith he serves with little reck to life. In this
very expedition was I wounded nigh unto death. The livid scar of it
is a dumb witness to my zeal. Where are thy scars, Marzak?"</p>

<p>Marzak quailed before the sudden blaze of that question, and
Sakr-el-Bahr laughed softly in contempt.</p>

<p>"Sit," Asad bade him. "I have been less than just."</p>

<p>"Thou art the very fount and spring of justice, O my lord, as
this thine admission proves," protested the corsair. He sat down
again, folding his legs under him. "I will confess to you that
being come so near to England in that cruise of mine I determined
to land and seize one who some years ago did injure me, and between
whom and me there was a score to settle. I exceeded my intentions
in that I carried off two prisoners instead of one. These
prisoners," he ran on, judging that the moment of reaction in
Asad's mind was entirely favourable to the preferment of the
request he had to make, "are not in the bagnio with the others.
They are still confined aboard the carack I seized."</p>

<p>"And why is this?" quoth Asad, but without suspicion now.</p>

<p>"Because, my lord, I have a boon to ask in some reward for the
service I have rendered."</p>

<p>"Ask it, my son."</p>

<p>"Give me leave to keep these captives for myself."</p>

<p>Asad considered him, frowning again slightly. Despite himself,
despite his affection for Sakr-el-Bahr, and his desire to soothe
him now, that rankling poison of Fenzileh's infusing was at work
again in his mind.</p>

<p>"My leave thou hast," said he. "But not the law's, and the law
runs that no corsair shall subtract so much as the value of an
asper from his booty until the division has been made and his own
share allotted him," was the grave answer.</p>

<p>"The law?" quoth Sakr-el-Bahr. "But thou art the law, exalted
lord."</p>

<p>"Not so, my son. The law is above the Basha, who must himself
conform to it so that he be just and worthy of his high office. And
the law I have recited thee applies even should the corsair raider
be the Basha himself. These slaves of thine must forthwith be sent
to the bagnio to join the others that tomorrow all may be sold in
the sk. See it done, Sakr-el-Bahr."</p>

<p>The corsair would have renewed his pleadings, but that his eye
caught the eager white face of Marzak and the gleaming expectant
eyes, looking so hopefully for his ruin. He checked, and bowed his
head with an assumption of indifference.</p>

<p>"Name thou their price then, and forthwith will I pay it into
thy treasury."</p>

<p>But Asad shook his head. "It is not for me to name their price,
but for the buyers," he replied. "I might set the price too high,
and that were unjust to thee, or too low, and that were unjust to
others who would acquire them. Deliver them over to the
bagnio."</p>

<p>"It shall be done," said Sakr-el-Bahr, daring to insist no
further and dissembling his chagrin.</p>

<p>Very soon thereafter he departed upon that errand, giving
orders, however, that Rosamund and Lionel should be kept apart from
the other prisoners until the hour of the sale on the morrow when
perforce they must take their place with the rest.</p>

<p>Marzak lingered with his father after Oliver had taken his
leave, and presently they were joined there in the courtyard by
Fenzileh&mdash;this woman who had brought, said many, the Frankish
ways of Shaitan into Algiers.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2-8" id="ch2-8"></a>CHAPTER VIII &mdash; MOTHER AND
SON</h2>

<p>Early on the morrow&mdash;so early that scarce had the Shehad
been recited&mdash;came Biskaine-el-Borak to the Basha. He had just
landed from a galley which had come upon a Spanish fishing boat,
aboard of which there was a young Morisco who was being conducted
over seas to Algiers. The news of which the fellow was the bearer
was of such urgency that for twenty hours without intermission the
slaves had toiled at the oars of Biskaine's vessel&mdash;the
capitana of his fleet&mdash;to bring her swiftly home.</p>

<p>The Morisco had a cousin&mdash;a New-Christian like himself, and
like himself, it would appear, still a Muslim at heart&mdash;who
was employed in the Spanish treasury at Malaga. This man had
knowledge that a galley was fitting out for sea to convey to Naples
the gold destined for the pay of the Spanish troops in garrison
there. Through parsimony this treasure-galley was to be afforded no
escort, but was under orders to hug the coast of Europe, where she
should be safe from all piratical surprise. It was judged that she
would be ready to put to sea in a week, and the Morisco had set out
at once to bring word of it to his Algerine brethren that they
might intercept and capture her.</p>

<p>Asad thanked the young Morisco for his news, bade him be housed
and cared for, and promised him a handsome share of the plunder
should the treasure-galley be captured. That done he sent for
Sakr-el-Bahr, whilst Marzak, who had been present at the interview,
went with the tale of it to his mother, and beheld her fling into a
passion when he added that it was Sakr-el-Bahr had been summoned
that he might be entrusted with this fresh expedition, thus proving
that all her crafty innuendoes and insistent warnings had been so
much wasted labour.</p>

<p>With Marzak following at her heels, she swept like a fury into
the darkened room where Asad took his ease.</p>

<p>"What is this I hear, O my lord?" she cried, in tone and manner
more the European shrew than the submissive Eastern slave. "Is
Sakr-el-Bahr to go upon this expedition against the treasure-galley
of Spain?"</p>

<p>Reclining on his divan he looked her up and down with a languid
eye. "Dost know of any better fitted to succeed?" quoth he.</p>

<p>"I know of one whom it is my lord's duty to prefer to that
foreign adventurer. One who is entirely faithful and entirely to be
trusted. One who does not attempt to retain for himself a portion
of the booty garnered in the name of Islam."</p>

<p>"Bah!" said Asad. "Wilt thou talk forever of those two slaves?
And who may be this paragon of thine?"</p>

<p>"Marzak," she answered fiercely, flinging out an arm to drag
forward her son. "Is he to waste his youth here in softness and
idleness? But yesternight that ribald mocked him with his lack of
scars. Shall he take scars in the orchard of the Kasbah here? Is he
to be content with those that come from the scratch of a bramble,
or is he to learn to be a fighter and leader of the Children of the
Faith that himself he may follow in the path his father trod?"</p>

<p>"Whether he so follows," said Asad, "is as the Sultan of
Istambul, the Sublime Portal, shall decree. We are but his
vice-regents here."</p>

<p>"But shall the Grand Sultan appoint him to succeed thee if thou
hast not equipped him so to do? I cry shame on thee, O father of
Marzak, for that thou art lacking in due pride in thine own
son."</p>

<p>"May Allah give me patience with thee! Have I not said that he
is still over young."</p>

<p>"At his age thyself thou wert upon the seas, serving with the
great Ochiali."</p>

<p>"At his age I was, by the favour of Allah, taller and stronger
than is he. I cherish him too dearly to let him go forth and
perchance be lost to me before his strength is full grown."</p>

<p>"Look at him," she commanded. "He is a man, Asad, and such a son
as another might take pride in. Is it not time he girt a scimitar
about his waist and trod the poop of one of thy galleys?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, indeed, O my father!" begged Marzak himself.</p>

<p>"What?" barked the old Moor. "And is it so? And wouldst thou go
forth then against the Spaniard? What knowledge hast thou that
shall equip thee for such a task?"</p>

<p>"What can his knowledge be since his father has never been
concerned to school him?" returned Fenzileh. "Dost thou sneer at
shortcomings that are the natural fruits of thine own
omissions?"</p>

<p>"I will be patient with thee," said Asad, showing every sign of
losing patience. "I will ask thee only if in thy judgment he is in
case to win a victory for Islam? Answer me straightly now."</p>

<p>"Straightly I answer thee that he is not. And, as straightly, I
tell thee that it is full time he were. Thy duty is to let him go
upon this expedition that he may learn the trade that lies before
him."</p>

<p>Asad considered a moment. Then: "Be it so," he answered slowly.
"Shalt set forth, then, with Sakr-el-Bahr, my son."</p>

<p>"With Sakr-el-Bahr?" cried Fenzilch aghast.</p>

<p>"I could find him no better preceptor."</p>

<p>"Shall thy son go forth as the servant of another?"</p>

<p>"As the pupil," Asad amended. "What else?"</p>

<p>"Were I a man, O fountain of my soul," said she, "and had I a
son, none but myself should be his preceptor. I should so mould and
fashion him that he should be another me. That, O my dear lord, is
thy duty to Marzak. Entrust not his training to another and to one
whom despite thy love for him I cannot trust. Go forth thyself upon
this expedition with Marzak here for thy kayia."</p>

<p>Asad frowned. "I grow too old," he said. "I have not been upon
the seas these two years past. Who can say that I may not have lost
the art of victory. No, no." He shook his head, and his face grew
overcast and softened by wistfulness. "Sakr-el-Bahr commands this
time, and if Marzak goes, he goes with him."</p>

<p>"My lord..." she began, then checked. A Nubian had entered to
announce that Sakr-el-Bahr was come and was awaiting the orders of
his lord in the courtyard. Asad rose instantly and for all that
Fenzileh, greatly daring as ever, would still have detained him, he
shook her off impatiently, and went out.</p>

<p>She watched his departure with anger in those dark lovely eyes
of hers, an anger that went near to filming them in tears, and
after he had passed out into the glaring sunshine beyond the door,
a silence dwelt in the cool darkened chamber&mdash;a silence
disturbed only by distant trills of silvery laughter from the
lesser women of the Basha's house. The sound jarred her taut
nerves. She moved with an oath and beat her hands together. To
answer her came a negress, lithe and muscular as a wrestler and
naked to the waist; the slave ring in her ear was of massive
gold.</p>

<p>"Bid them make an end of that screeching," she snapped to vent
some of her fierce petulance. "Tell them I will have the rods to
them if they again disturb me."</p>

<p>The negress went out, and silence followed, for those other
lesser ladies of the Basha's hareem were more obedient to the
commands of Fenzileh than to those of the Basha himself.</p>

<p>Then she drew her son to the fretted lattice commanding the
courtyard, a screen from behind which they could see and hear all
that passed out yonder. Asad was speaking, informing Sakr-el-Bahr
of what he had learnt, and what there was to do.</p>

<p>"How soon canst thou put to sea again?" he ended.</p>

<p>"As soon as the service of Allah and thyself require," was the
prompt answer.</p>

<p>"It is well, my son." Asad laid a hand, affectionately upon the
corsair's shoulder, entirely conquered by this readiness. "Best set
out at sunrise to-morrow. Thou'lt need so long to make thee ready
for the sea."</p>

<p>"Then by thy leave I go forthwith to give orders to prepare,"
replied Sakr-el-Bahr, for all that he was a little troubled in his
mind by this need to depart again so soon.</p>

<p>"What galleys shalt thou take?"</p>

<p>"To capture one galley of Spain? My own galeasse, no more; she
will be full equal to such an enterprise, and I shall be the better
able, then, to lurk and take cover&mdash;a thing which might well
prove impossible with a fleet."</p>

<p>"Ay&mdash;thou art wise in thy daring," Asad approved him. "May
Allah prosper thee upon the voyage."</p>

<p>"Have I the leave to go?"</p>

<p>"A moment yet. There is my son Marzak. He is approaching
manhood, and it is time he entered the service of Allah and the
State. It is my desire that he sail as thy lieutenant on this
voyage, and that thou be his preceptor even as I was thine of
old."</p>

<p>Now here was something that pleased Sakr-el-Bahr as little as it
pleased Marzak. Knowing the bitter enmity borne him by the son of
Fenzileh he had every cause to fear trouble if this project of
Asad's were realized.</p>

<p>"As I was thine of old!" he answered with crafty wistfulness.
"Wilt thou not put to sea with us to-morrow, O Asad? There is none
like thee in all Islam, and what a joy were it not to stand beside
thee on the prow as of old when we grapple with the Spaniard."</p>

<p>Asad considered him. "Dost thou, too, urge this?" quoth he.</p>

<p>"Have others urged it?" The man's sharp wits, rendered still
sharper by his sufferings, were cutting deeply and swiftly into
this matter. "They did well, but none could have urged it more
fervently than I, for none knows so well as I the joy of battle
against the infidel under thy command and the glory of prevailing
in thy sight. Come, then, my lord, upon this enterprise, and be
thyself thine own son's preceptor since 'tis the highest honour
thou canst bestow upon him."</p>

<p>Thoughtfully Asad stroked his long white beard, his eagle eyes
growing narrow. "Thou temptest me, by Allah!"</p>

<p>"Let me do more..."</p>

<p>"Nay, more thou canst not. I am old and worn, and I am needed
here. Shall an old lion hunt a young gazelle? Peace, peace! The sun
has set upon my fighting day. Let the brood of fighters I have
raised up keep that which my arm conquered and maintain my name and
the glory of the Faith upon the seas." He leaned upon
Sakr-el-Bahr's shoulder and sighed, his eyes wistfully dreamy. "It
were a fond adventure in good truth. But no...I am resolved. Go
thou and take Marzak with thee, and bring him safely home
again."</p>

<p>"I should not return myself else," was the answer. "But my trust
is in the All-knowing."</p>

<p>Upon that he departed, dissembling his profound vexation both at
the voyage and the company, and went to bid Othmani make ready his
great galeasse, equipping it with carronades, three hundred slaves
to row it, and three hundred fighting men.</p>

<p>Asad-ed-Din returned to that darkened room in the Kasbah
overlooking the courtyard, where Fenzileh and Marzak still
lingered. He went to tell them that in compliance with the desires
of both Marzak should go forth to prove himself upon this
expedition.</p>

<p>But where he had left impatience he found thinly veiled
wrath.</p>

<p>"O sun that warms me," Fenzileh greeted him, and from long
experience he knew that the more endearing were her epithets the
more vicious was her mood, "do then my counsels weigh as naught
with thee, are they but as the dust upon thy shoes?"</p>

<p>"Less," said Asad, provoked out of his habitual indulgence of
her licences of speech.</p>

<p>"That is the truth, indeed!" she cried, bowing her head, whilst
behind her the handsome face of her son was overcast.</p>

<p>"It is," Asad agreed. "At dawn, Marzak, thou settest forth upon
the galeasse of Sakr-el-Bahr to take the seas under his tutelage
and to emulate the skill and valour that have rendered him the
stoutest bulwark of Islam, the very javelin of Allah."</p>

<p>But Marzak felt that in this matter his mother was to be
supported, whilst his detestation of this adventurer who threatened
to usurp the place that should rightly be his own spurred him to
mad lengths of daring.</p>

<p>"When I take the seas with that dog-descended Nasrani," he
answered hoarsely, "he shall be where rightly he belongs&mdash;at
the rowers' bench."</p>

<p>"How?" It was a bellow of rage. Upon the word Asad swung to
confront his son, and his face, suddenly inflamed, was so cruel and
evil in its expression that it terrified that intriguing pair. "By
the beard of the Prophet! what words are these to me?" He advanced
upon Marzak until Fenzileh in sudden terror stepped between and
faced him, like a lioness springing to defend her cub. But the
Basha, enraged now by this want of submission in his son, enraged
both against that son and the mother who he knew had prompted him,
caught her in his sinewy old hands, and flung her furiously aside,
so that she stumbled and fell in a panting heap amid the cushions
of her divan.</p>

<p>"The curse of Allah upon thee!" he screamed, and Marzak recoiled
before him. "Has this presumptuous hellcat who bore thee taught
thee to stand before my face, to tell me what thou wilt and wilt
not do? By the Koran! too long have I endured her evil foreign
ways, and now it seems she has taught thee how to tread them after
her and how to beard thy very father! To-morrow thou'lt take the
sea with Sakr-el-Bahr, I have said it. Another word and thou'lt go
aboard his galeasse even as thou saidst should be the case with
him&mdash;at the rowers' bench, to learn submission under the slave
master's whip."</p>

<p>Terrified, Marzak stood numb and silent, scarcely daring to draw
breath. Never in all his life had he seen his father in a rage so
royal. Yet it seemed to inspire no fear in Fenzileh, that
congenital shrew whose tongue not even the threat of rods or hooks
could silence.</p>

<p>"I shall pray Allah to restore sight to thy soul, O father of
Marzak," she panted, "to teach thee to discriminate between those
that love thee and the self-seekers that abuse thy trust."</p>

<p>"How!" he roared at her. "Art not yet done?"</p>

<p>"Nor ever shall be until I am lain dumb in death for having
counselled thee out of my great love, O light of these poor eyes of
mine."</p>

<p>"Maintain this tone," he said, with concentrated anger, "and
that will soon befall."</p>

<p>"I care not so that the sleek mask be plucked from the face of
that dog-descended Sakr-el-Bahr. May Allah break his bones! What of
those slaves of his&mdash;those two from England, O Asad? I am told
that one is a woman, tall and of that white beauty which is the
gift of Eblis to these Northerners. What is his purpose with
her&mdash;that he would not show her in the suk as the law
prescribes, but comes slinking here to beg thee set aside the law
for him? Ha! I talk in vain. I have shown thee graver things to
prove his vile disloyalty, and yet thou'lt fawn upon him whilst thy
fangs are bared to thine own son."</p>

<p>He advanced upon her, stooped, caught her by the wrist, and
heaved her up.</p>

<p>His face showed grey under its deep tan. His aspect terrified
her at last and made an end of her reckless forward courage.</p>

<p>He raised his voice to call.</p>

<p>"Ya anta! Ayoub!"</p>

<p>She gasped, livid in her turn with sudden terror. "My lord, my
lord!" she whimpered. "Stream of my life, be not angry! What wilt
thou do?"</p>

<p>He smiled evilly. "Do?" he growled. "What I should have done ten
years ago and more. We'll have the rods to thee." And again he
called, more insistently&mdash;"Ayoub!"</p>

<p>"My lord, my lord!" she gasped in shuddering horror now that at
last she found him set upon the thing to which so often she had
dared him. "Pity! Pity!" She grovelled and embraced his knees. "In
the name of the Pitying the Pitiful be merciful upon the excesses
to which my love for thee may have driven this poor tongue of mine.
O my sweet lord! O father of Marzak!"</p>

<p>Her distress, her beauty, and perhaps, more than either, her
unusual humility and submission may have moved him. For even as at
that moment Ayoub&mdash;the sleek and portly eunuch, who was her
wazeer and chamberlain&mdash;loomed in the inner doorway,
salaaming, he vanished again upon the instant, dismissed by a
peremptory wave of the Basha's hand.</p>

<p>Asad looked down upon her, sneering. "That attitude becomes thee
best," he said. "Continue it in future." Contemptuously he shook
himself free of her grasp, turned and stalked majestically out,
wearing his anger like a royal mantle, and leaving behind him two
terror-shaken beings, who felt as if they had looked over the very
edge of death.</p>

<p>There was a long silence between them. Then at long length
Fenzileh rose and crossed to the meshra-biyah&mdash;the latticed
window-box. She opened it and took from one of its shelves an
earthenware jar, placed there so as to receive the slightest
breeze. From it she poured water into a little cup and drank
greedily. That she could perform this menial service for herself
when a mere clapping of hands would have brought slaves to minister
to her need betrayed something of her disordered state of mind.</p>

<p>She slammed the inner lattice and turned to Marzak. "And now?"
quoth she.</p>

<p>"Now?" said the lad.</p>

<p>"Ay, what now? What are we to do? Are we to lie crushed under
his rage until we are ruined indeed? He is bewitched. That jackal
has enchanted him, so that he must deem well done all that is done
by him. Allah guide us here, Marzak, or thou'lt be trampled into
dust by Sakr-el-Bahr."</p>

<p>Marzak hung his head; slowly he moved to the divan and flung
himself down upon its pillows; there he lay prone, his hands
cupping his chin, his heels in the air.</p>

<p>"What can I do?" he asked at last.</p>

<p>"That is what I most desire to know. Something must be done, and
soon. May his bones rot! If he lives thou art destroyed."</p>

<p>"Ay," said Marzak, with sudden vigour and significance. "If he
lives!" And he sat up. "Whilst we plan and plot, and our plans and
plots come to naught save to provoke the anger of my father, we
might be better employed in taking the shorter way."</p>

<p>She stood in the middle of the chamber, pondering him with
gloomy eyes. "I too have thought of that," said she. "I could hire
me men to do the thing for a handful of gold. But the risk of
it..."</p>

<p>"Where would be the risk once he is dead?"</p>

<p>"He might pull us down with him, and then what would our profit
be in his death? Thy father would avenge him terribly."</p>

<p>"If it were craftily done we should not be discovered."</p>

<p>"Not be discovered?" she echoed, and laughed without mirth. "How
young and blind thou art, O Marzak! We should be the first to be
suspected. I have made no secret of my hate of him, and the people
do not love me. They would urge thy father to do justice even were
he himself averse to it, which I will not credit would be the case.
This Sakr-el-Bahr&mdash;may Allah wither him!&mdash;is a god in
their eyes. Bethink thee of the welcome given him! What Basha
returning in triumph was ever greeted by the like? These victories
that fortune has vouchsafed him have made them account him divinely
favoured and protected. I tell thee, Marzak, that did thy father
die to-morrow Sakr-el-Bahr would be proclaimed Basha of Algiers in
his stead, and woe betide us then. And Asad-el-Din grows old. True,
he does not go forth to fight. He clings to life and may last long.
But if he should not, and if Sakr-el-Bahr should still walk the
earth when thy father's destiny is fulfilled, I dare not think what
then will be thy fate and mine."</p>

<p>"May his grave be defiled!" growled Matzak.</p>

<p>"His grave?" said she. "The difficulty is to dig it for him
without hurt to ourselves. Shaitan protects the dog."</p>

<p>"May he make his bed in hell!" said Marzak.</p>

<p>"To curse him will not help us. Up, Marzak, and consider how the
thing is to be done."</p>

<p>Marzak came to his feet, nimble and supple as a greyhound.
"Listen now," he said. "Since I must go this voyage with him,
perchance upon the seas on some dark night opportunity may serve
me."</p>

<p>"Wait! Let me consider it. Allah guide me to find some way!" She
beat her hands together and bade the slave girl who answered her to
summon her wazeer Ayoub, and bid a litter be prepared for her.
"We'll to the sk, O Marzak, and see these slaves of his. Who knows
but that something may be done by means of them! Guile will serve
us better than mere strength against that misbegotten son of
shame."</p>

<p>"May his house be destroyed!" said Marzak.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2-9" id="ch2-9"></a>CHAPTER IX &mdash;
COMPETITORS</h2>

<p>The open space before the gates of the sk-el-Abeed was thronged
with a motley, jostling, noisy crowd that at every moment was being
swelled by the human streams pouring to mingle in it from the
debauching labyrinth of narrow, unpaved streets.</p>

<p>There were brown-skinned Berbers in black goat-hair cloaks that
were made in one piece with a cowl and decorated by a lozenge of
red or orange colour on the back, their shaven heads encased in
skull-caps or simply bound in a cord of plaited camel-hair; there
were black Saharowi who went almost naked, and stately Arabs who
seemed overmuffled in their flowing robes of white with the cowls
overshadowing their swarthy, finely featured faces; there were
dignified and prosperous-looking Moors in brightly coloured selhams
astride of sleek mules that were richly caparisoned; and there were
Tagareenes, the banished Moors of Andalusia, most of whom followed
the trade of slave-dealers; there were native Jews in sombre black
djellabas, and Christian-Jews&mdash;so-called because bred in
Christian countries, whose garments they still wore; there were
Levantine Turks, splendid of dress and arrogant of demeanour, and
there were humble Cololies, Kabyles and Biscaries. Here a
water-seller, laden with his goatskin vessel, tinkled his little
bell; there an orange-hawker, balancing a basket of the golden
fruit upon his ragged turban, bawled his wares. There were men on
foot and men on mules, men on donkeys and men on slim Arab horses,
an ever-shifting medley of colours, all jostling, laughing, cursing
in the ardent African sunshine under the blue sky where pigeons
circled. In the shadow of the yellow tapia wall squatted a line of
whining beggars and cripples soliciting alms; near the gates a
little space had been cleared and an audience had gathered in a
ring about a Meddah&mdash;a beggar-troubadour&mdash;who, to the
accompaniment of gimbri and gaitah from two acolytes, chanted a
doleful ballad in a thin, nasal voice.</p>

<p>Those of the crowd who were patrons of the market held steadily
amain, and, leaving their mounts outside, passed through the gates
through which there was no admittance for mere idlers and mean
folk. Within the vast quadrangular space of bare, dry ground,
enclosed by dust-coloured walls, there was more space. The sale of
slaves had not yet begun and was not due to begin for another hour,
and meanwhile a little trading was being done by those merchants
who had obtained the coveted right to set up their booths against
the walls; they were vendors of wool, of fruit, of spices, and one
or two traded in jewels and trinkets for the adornment of the
Faithful.</p>

<p>A well was sunk in the middle of the ground, a considerable
octagon with a low parapet in three steps. Upon the nethermost of
these sat an aged, bearded Jew in a black djellaba, his head
swathed in a coloured kerchief. Upon his knees reposed a broad,
shallow black box, divided into compartments, each filled with
lesser gems and rare stones, which he was offering for sale; about
him stood a little group of young Moors and one or two Turkish
officers, with several of whom the old Israelite was haggling at
once.</p>

<p>The whole of the northern wall was occupied by a long penthouse,
its contents completely masked by curtains of camel-hair; from
behind it proceeded a subdued murmur of human voices. These were
the pens in which were confined the slaves to be offered for sale
that day. Before the curtains, on guard, stood some dozen corsairs
with attendant negro slaves.</p>

<p>Beyond and above the wall glistened the white dome of a zowia,
flanked by a spear-like minaret and the tall heads of a few date
palms whose long leaves hung motionless in the hot air.</p>

<p>Suddenly in the crowd beyond the gates there was a commotion.
From one of the streets six colossal Nubians advanced with shouts
of&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oak! Oak! Warda! Way! Make way!"</p>

<p>They were armed with great staves, grasped in their two hands,
and with these they broke a path through that motley press, hurling
men to right and left and earning a shower of curses in return.</p>

<p>"Balk! Make way! Way for the Lord Asad-ed-Din, the exalted of
Allah! Way!"</p>

<p>The crowd, pressing back, went down upon its knees and grovelled
as Asad-ed-Din on a milk-white mule rode forward, escorted by
Tsamanni his wazeer and a cloud of black-robed janissaries with
flashing scimitars.</p>

<p>The curses that had greeted the violence of his negroes were
suddenly silenced; instead, blessings as fervent filled the
air.</p>

<p>"May Allah increase thy might! May Allah lengthen thy days! The
blessings of our Lord Mahomet upon thee! Allah send thee more
victories!" were the benedictions that showered upon him on every
hand. He returned them as became a man who was supremely pious and
devout.</p>

<p>"The peace of Allah upon the Faithful of the Prophet's House,"
he would murmur in response from time to time, until at last he had
reached the gates. There he bade Tsamanni fling a purse to the
crouching beggars&mdash;for is it not written in the Most
Perspicuous Book that of alms ye shall bestow what ye can spare,
for such as are saved from their own greed shall prosper, and
whatever ye give in alms, as seeking the face of Allah shall be
doubled unto you?</p>

<p>Submissive to the laws as the meanest of his subjects, Asad
dismounted and passed on foot into the sk. He came to a halt by
the well, and, facing the curtained penthouse, he blessed the
kneeling crowd and commanded all to rise.</p>

<p>He beckoned Sakr-el-Bahr's officer Ali&mdash;who was in charge
of the slaves of the corsair's latest raid and announced his will
to inspect the captives. At a sign from Ali, the negroes flung
aside the camel-hair curtains and let the fierce sunlight beat in
upon those pent-up wretches; they were not only the captives taken
by Sakr-el-Bahr, but some others who were the result of one or two
lesser raids by Biskaine.</p>

<p>Asad beheld a huddle of men and women&mdash;though the
proportion of women was very small&mdash;of all ages, races, and
conditions; there were pale fair-haired men from France or the
North, olive-skinned Italians and swarthy Spaniards, negroes and
half-castes; there were old men, young men and mere children, some
handsomely dressed, some almost naked, others hung with rags. In
the hopeless dejection of their countenances alone was there any
uniformity. But it was not a dejection that could awaken pity in
the pious heart of Asad. They were unbelievers who would never look
upon the face of God's Prophet, accursed and unworthy of any
tenderness from man. For a moment his glance was held by a lovely
black-haired Spanish girl, who sat with her locked hands held fast
between her knees, in an attitude of intense despair and
suffering&mdash;the glory of her eyes increased and magnified by
the dark brown stains of sleeplessness surrounding them. Leaning on
Tsamanni's arm, he stood considering her for a little while; then
his glance travelled on. Suddenly he tightened his grasp of
Tsamanni's arm and a quick interest leapt into his sallow face.</p>

<p>On the uppermost tier of the pen that he was facing sat a very
glory of womanhood, such a woman as he had heard tell existed but
the like of which he had never yet beheld. She was tall and
graceful as a cypress-tree; her skin was white as milk, her eyes
two darkest sapphires, her head of a coppery golden that seemed to
glow like metal as the sunlight caught it. She was dressed in a
close gown of white, the bodice cut low and revealing the
immaculate loveliness of her neck.</p>

<p>Asad-ed-Din turned to Ali. "What pearl is this that hath been
cast upon this dung-heap?" he asked.</p>

<p>"She is the woman our lord Sakr-el-Bahr carried off from
England." Slowly the Basha's eyes returned to consider her, and
insensible though she had deemed herself by now, he saw her cheeks
slowly reddening under the cold insult of his steady, insistent
glance. The glow heightened her beauty, effacing the weariness
which the face had worn.</p>

<p>"Bring her forth," said the Basha shortly.</p>

<p>She was seized by two of the negroes, and to avoid being roughly
handled by them she came at once, bracing herself to bear with
dignity whatever might await her. A golden-haired young man beside
her, his face haggard and stubbled with a beard of some growth,
looked up in alarm as she was taken from his side. Then, with a
groan, he made as if to clutch her, but a rod fell upon his raised
arms and beat them down.</p>

<p>Asad was thoughtful. It was Fenzileh who had bidden him come
look at the infidel maid whom Sakr-el-Bahr had risked so much to
snatch from England, suggesting that in her he would behold some
proof of the bad faith which she was forever urging against the
corsair leader. He beheld the woman, but he discovered about her no
such signs as Fenzileh had suggested he must find, nor indeed did
he look for any. Out of curiosity had he obeyed her prompting. But
that and all else were forgotten now in the contemplation of this
noble ensample of Northern womanhood, statuesque almost in her
terrible restraint.</p>

<p>He put forth a hand to touch her arm, and she drew it back as if
his fingers were of fire.</p>

<p>He sighed. "How inscrutable are the ways of Allah, that He
should suffer so luscious a fruit to hang from the foul tree of
infidelity!"</p>

<p>Tsamanni watching him craftily, a master-sycophant profoundly
learned in the art of playing upon his master's moods, made
answer:</p>

<p>"Even so perchance that a Faithful of the Prophet's House may
pluck it. Verily all things are possible to the One!"</p>

<p>"Yet is it not set down in the Book to be Read that the
daughters of the infidel are not for True-Believers?" And again he
sighed.</p>

<p>But Tsamanni knowing full well how the Basha would like to be
answered, trimmed his reply to that desire.</p>

<p>"Allah is great, and what hath befallen once may well befall
again, my lord."</p>

<p>Asad's kindling eyes flashed a glance at his wazeer.</p>

<p>"Thou meanest Fenzileh. But then, by the mercy of Allah, I was
rendered the instrument of her enlightenment."</p>

<p>"It may well be written that thou shalt be the same again, my
lord," murmured the insidious Tsamanni. There was more stirring in
his mind than the mere desire to play the courtier now. 'Twixt
Fenzileh and himself there had long been a feud begotten of the
jealousy which each inspired in the other where Asad was concerned.
Were Fenzileh removed the wazeer's influence must grow and spread
to his own profit. It was a thing of which he had often dreamed,
but a dream he feared that was never like to be realized, for Asad
was ageing, and the fires that had burned so fiercely in his
earlier years seemed now to have consumed in him all thought of
women. Yet here was one as by a miracle, of a beauty so amazing and
so diverse from any that ever yet had feasted the Basha's sight,
that plainly she had acted as a charm upon his senses.</p>

<p>"She is white as the snows upon the Atlas, luscious as the dates
of Tafilalt," he murmured fondly, his gleaming eyes considering her
what time she stood immovable before him. Suddenly he looked about
him, and wheeled upon Tsamanni, his manner swiftly becoming charged
with anger.</p>

<p>"Her face has been bared to a thousand eyes and more," he
cried.</p>

<p>"Even that has been so before," replied Tsamanni.</p>

<p>And then quite suddenly at their elbow a voice that was
naturally soft and musical of accent but now rendered harsh, cut in
to ask:</p>

<p>"What woman may this be?"</p>

<p>Startled, both the Basha and his wazeer swung round. Fenzileh,
becomingly veiled and hooded, stood before them, escorted by
Marzak. A little behind them were the eunuchs and the litter in
which, unperceived by Asad, she had been borne thither. Beside the
litter stood her wazeer Ayoub-el-Samin.</p>

<p>Asad scowled down upon her, for he had not yet recovered from
the resentment she and Marzak had provoked in him. Moreover, that
in private she should be lacking in the respect which was his due
was evil enough, though he had tolerated it. But that she should
make so bold as to thrust in and question him in this peremptory
fashion before all the world was more than his dignity could
suffer. Never yet had she dared so much nor would she have dared it
now but that her sudden anxiety had effaced all caution from her
mind. She had seen the look with which Asad had been considering
that lovely slave, and not only jealousy but positive fear awoke in
her. Her hold upon Asad was growing tenuous. To snap it utterly no
more was necessary than that he who of late years had scarce
bestowed a thought or glance upon a woman should be taken with the
fancy to bring some new recruit to his hareem.</p>

<p>Hence her desperate, reckless courage to stand thus before him
now, for although her face was veiled there was hardy arrogance in
every line of her figure. Of his scowl she took no slightest
heed.</p>

<p>"If this be the slave fetched by Sakr-el-Bahr from England, then
rumour has lied to me," she said. "I vow it was scarce worth so
long a voyage and the endangering so many valuable Muslim lives to
fetch this yellow-faced, long-shanked daughter of perdition into
Barbary."</p>

<p>Asad's surprise beat down his anger. He was not subtle.</p>

<p>"Yellow-faced? Long-shanked?" quoth he. Then reading Fenzileh at
last, he displayed a slow, crooked smile. "Already have I observed
thee to grow hard of hearing, and now thy sight is failing too, it
seems. Assuredly thou art growing old." And he looked her over with
such an eye of displeasure that she recoiled.</p>

<p>He stepped close up to her. "Too long already hast thou queened
it in my hareem with thine infidel, Frankish ways," he muttered, so
that none but those immediately about overheard his angry words.
"Thou art become a very scandal in the eyes of the Faithful," he
added very grimly. "It were well, perhaps, that we amended
that."</p>

<p>Abruptly then he turned away, and by a gesture he ordered Ali to
return the slave to her place among the others. Leaning on the arm
of Tsamanni he took some steps towards the entrance, then halted,
and turned again to Fenzileh:</p>

<p>"To thy litter," he bade her peremptorily, rebuking her thus
before all, "and get thee to the house as becomes a seemly Muslim
woman. Nor ever again let thyself be seen roving the public places
afoot."</p>

<p>She obeyed him instantly, without a murmur; and he himself
lingered at the gates with Tsamanni until her litter had passed
out, escorted by Ayoub and Marzak walking each on one side of it
and neither daring to meet the angry eye of the Basha.</p>

<p>Asad looked sourly after that litter, a sneer on his heavy
lips.</p>

<p>"As her beauty wanes so her presumption waxes," he growled. "She
is growing old, Tsamanni&mdash;old and lean and shrewish, and no
fit mate for a Member of the Prophet's House. It were perhaps a
pleasing thing in the sight of Allah that we replaced her." And
then, referring obviously to that other one, his eye turning
towards the penthouse the curtains of which were drawn again, he
changed his tone.</p>

<p>"Didst thou mark, O Tsamanni, with what a grace she
moved?&mdash;lithely and nobly as a young gazelle. Verily, so much
beauty was never created by the All-Wise to be cast into the
Pit."</p>

<p>"May it not have been sent to comfort some True-Believer?"
wondered the subtle wazeer. "To Allah all things are possible."</p>

<p>"Why else, indeed?" said Asad. "It was written; and even as none
may obtain what is not written, so none may avoid what is. I am
resolved. Stay thou here, Tsamanni. Remain for the outcry and
purchase her. She shall be taught the True Faith. She shall be
saved from the furnace." The command had come, the thing that
Tsamanni had so ardently desired.</p>

<p>He licked his lips. "And the price, my lord?" he asked, in a
small voice.</p>

<p>"Price?" quoth Asad. "Have I not bid thee purchase her? Bring
her to me, though her price be a thousand philips."</p>

<p>"A thousand philips!" echoed Tsamanni amazed. "Allah is
great!"</p>

<p>But already Asad had left his side and passed out under the
arched gateeay, where the grovelling began anew at the sight of
him.</p>

<p>It was a fine thing for Asad to bid him remain for the sale. But
the dalal would part with no slave until the money was forthcoming,
and Tsamanni had no considerable sum upon his person. Therefore in
the wake of his master he set out forthwith to the Kasbah. It
wanted still an hour before the sale would be held and he had time
and to spare in which to go and return.</p>

<p>It happened, however, that Tsamanni was malicious, and that the
hatred of Fenzileh which so long he had consumed in silence and
dissembled under fawning smiles and profound salaams included also
her servants. There was none in all the world of whom he
entertained a greater contempt than her sleek and greasy eunuch
Ayoub-el-Samin of the majestic, rolling gait and fat, supercilious
lips.</p>

<p>It was written, too, that in the courtyard of the Kasbah he
should stumble upon Ayoub, who indeed had by his mistress's
commands been set to watch for the wazeer. The fat fellow rolled
forward, his hands supporting his paunch, his little eyes
agleam.</p>

<p>"Allah increase thy health, Tsamanni," was his courteous
greeting. "Thou bearest news?"</p>

<p>"News? What news?" quoth Tsamanni. "In truth none that will
gladden thy mistress."</p>

<p>"Merciful Allah! What now? Doth it concern that Frankish
slave-girl?"</p>

<p>Tsamanni smiled, a thing that angered Ayoub, who felt that the
ground he trod was becoming insecure; it followed that if his
mistress fell from influence he fell with her, and became as the
dust upon Tsamanni's slippers.</p>

<p>"By the Koran thou tremblest, Ayoub!" Tsamanni mocked him. "Thy
soft fat is all a-quivering; and well it may, for thy days are
numbered, O father of nothing."</p>

<p>"Dost deride me, dog?" came the other's voice, shrill now with
anger.</p>

<p>"Callest me dog? Thou?" Deliberately Tsamanni spat upon his
shadow. "Go tell thy mistress that I am bidden by my lord to buy
the Frankish girl. Tell her that my lord will take her to wife,
even as he took Fenzileh, that he may lead her into the True Belief
and cheat Shaitan of so fair a jewel. Add that I am bidden to buy
her though she cost my lord a thousand philips. Bear her that
message, O father of wind, and may Allah increase thy paunch!" And
he was gone, lithe, active, and mocking.</p>

<p>"May thy sons perish and thy daughters become harlots," roared
the eunuch, maddened at once by this evil news and the insult with
which it was accompanied.</p>

<p>But Tsamanni only laughed, as he answered him over his
shoulder&mdash;</p>

<p>"May thy sons be sultans all, Ayoub!"</p>

<p>Quivering still with a rage that entirely obliterated his alarm
at what he had learnt, Ayoub rolled into the presence of his
mistress with that evil message.</p>

<p>She listened to him in a dumb white fury. Then she fell to
reviling her lord and the slave-girl in a breath, and called upon
Allah to break their bones and blacken their faces and rot their
flesh with all the fervour of one born and bred in the True Faith.
When she recovered from that burst of fury it was to sit brooding
awhile. At length she sprang up and bade Ayoub see that none lurked
to listen about the doorways.</p>

<p>"We must act, Ayoub, and act swiftly, or I am destroyed and with
me will be destroyed Marzak, who alone could not stand against his
father's face. Sakr-el-Bahr will trample us into the dust." She
checked on a sudden thought. "By Allah it may have been a part of
his design to have brought hither that white-faced wench. But we
must thwart him and we must thwart Asad, or thou art ruined too,
Ayoub."</p>

<p>"Thwart him?" quoth her wazeer, gaping at the swift energy of
mind and body with which this woman was endowed, the like of which
he had never seen in any woman yet. "Thwart him?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"First, Ayoub, to place this Frankish girl beyond his
reach."</p>

<p>"That is well thought&mdash;but how?"</p>

<p>"How? Can thy wit suggest no way? Hast thou wits at all in that
fat head of thine? Thou shalt outbid Tsamanni, or, better still,
set someone else to do it for thee, and so buy the girl for me.
Then we'll contrive that she shall vanish quietly and quickly
before Asad can discover a trace of her."</p>

<p>His face blanched, and the wattles about his jaws were shaking.
"And...and the cost? Hast thou counted the cost, O Fenzileh? What
will happen when Asad gains knowledge of this thing?"</p>

<p>"He shall gain no knowledge of it," she answered him. "Or if he
does, the girl being gone beyond recall, he shall submit him to
what was written. Trust me to know how to bring him to it."</p>

<p>"Lady, lady!" he cried, and wrung his bunches of fat fingers. "I
dare not engage in this!"</p>

<p>"Engage in what? If I bid thee go buy this girl, and give thee
the money thou'lt require, what else concerns thee, dog? What else
is to be done, a man shall do. Come now, thou shalt have the money,
all I have, which is a matter of some fifteen hundred philips, and
what is not laid out upon this purchase thou shalt retain for
thyself."</p>

<p>He considered an instant, and conceived that she was right. None
could blame him for executing the commands she gave him. And there
would be profit in it, clearly&mdash;ay, and it would be sweet to
outbid that dog Tsamanni and send him empty-handed home to face the
wrath of his frustrated master. He spread his hands and salaamed in
token of complete acquiescence.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2-10" id="ch2-10"></a>CHAPTER X &mdash; THE
SLAVE-MARKET</h2>

<p>At the sk-el-Abeed it was the hour of the outcry, announced by
a blast of trumpets and the thudding of tom-toms. The traders that
until then had been licensed to ply within the enclosure now put up
the shutters of their little booths. The Hebrew pedlar of gems
closed his box and effaced himself, leaving the steps about the
well clear for the most prominent patrons of the market. These
hastened to assemble there, surrounding it and facing outwards,
whilst the rest of the crowd was ranged against the southern and
western walls of the enclosure.</p>

<p>Came negro water-carriers in white turbans with aspersers made
of palmetto leaves to sprinkle the ground and lay the dust against
the tramp of slaves and buyers. The trumpets ceased for an instant,
then sounded a fresh imperious blast and fell permanently silent.
The crowd about the gates fell back to right and left, and very
slowly and stately three tall dalals, dressed from head to foot in
white and with immaculate turbans wound about their heads, advanced
into the open space. They came to a halt at the western end of the
long wall, the chief dalal standing slightly in advance of the
other two.</p>

<p>The chattering of voices sank upon their advent, it became a
hissing whisper, then a faint drone like that of bees, and then
utter silence. In the solemn and grave demeanour of the dalals
there was something almost sacerdotal, so that when that silence
fell upon the crowd the affair took on the aspect of a
sacrament.</p>

<p>The chief dalal stood forward a moment as if in an abstraction
with downcast eyes; then with hands outstretched to catch a
blessing he raised his voice and began to pray in a monotonous
chant:</p>

<p>"In the name of Allah the Pitying the Pitiful Who created man
from clots of blood! All that is in the Heavens and in the Earth
praiseth Allah, Who is the Mighty, the Wise! His the kingdom of the
Heavens and of the Earth. He maketh alive and killeth, and He hath
power over all things. He is the first and the last, the seen and
the unseen, and He knoweth all things."</p>

<p>"Ameen," intoned the crowd.</p>

<p>"The praise to Him who sent us Mahomet His Prophet to give the
world the True Belief, and curses upon Shaitan the stoned who wages
war upon Allah and His children."</p>

<p>"Ameen."</p>

<p>"The blessings of Allah and our Lord Mahomet upon this market
and upon all who may buy and sell herein, and may Allah increase
their wealth and grant them length of days in which to praise
Him."</p>

<p>"Ameen," replied the crowd, as with a stir and rustle the close
ranks relaxed from the tense attitude of prayer, and each man
sought elbow-room.</p>

<p>The dalal beat his hands together, whereupon the curtains were
drawn aside and the huddled slaves displayed&mdash;some three
hundred in all, occupying three several pens.</p>

<p>In the front rank of the middle pen&mdash;the one containing
Rosamund and Lionel&mdash;stood a couple of stalwart young Nubians,
sleek and muscular, who looked on with completest indifference, no
whit appalled by the fate which had haled them thither. They caught
the eye of the dalal, and although the usual course was for a buyer
to indicate a slave he was prepared to purchase, yet to the end
that good beginning should be promptly made, the dalal himself
pointed out that stalwart pair to the corsairs who stood on guard.
In compliance the two negroes were brought forth.</p>

<p>"Here is a noble twain," the dalal announced, "strong of muscle
and long of limb, as all may see, whom it were a shameful thing to
separate. Who needs such a pair for strong labour let him say what
he will give." He set out on a slow circuit of the well, the
corsairs urging the two slaves to follow him that all buyers might
see and inspect them.</p>

<p>In the foremost ranks of the crowd near the gate stood Ali, sent
thither by Othmani to purchase a score of stout fellows required to
make up the contingent of the galeasse of Sakr-el-Bahr. He had been
strictly enjoined to buy naught but the stoutest stuff the market
could afford&mdash;with one exception. Aboard that galeasse they
wanted no weaklings who would trouble the boatswain with their
swoonings. Ali announced his business forthwith.</p>

<p>"I need such tall fellows for the oars of Sakr-el-Bahr," said he
with loud importance, thus drawing upon himself the eyes of the
assembly, and sunning himself in the admiring looks bestowed upon
one of the officers of Oliver-Reis, one of the rovers who were the
pride of Islam and a sword-edge to the infidel.</p>

<p>"They were born to toil nobly at the oar, O Ali-Reis," replied
the dalal in all solemnity. "What wilt thou give for them?"</p>

<p>"Two hundred philips for the twain."</p>

<p>The dalal paced solemnly on, the slaves following in his
wake.</p>

<p>"Two hundred philips am I offered for a pair of the lustiest
slaves that by the favour of Allah were ever brought into this
market. Who will say fifty philips more?"</p>

<p>A portly Moor in a flowing blue selham rose from his seat on the
step of the well as the dalal came abreast of him, and the slaves
scenting here a buyer, and preferring any service to that of the
galleys with which they were threatened, came each in turn to kiss
his hands and fawn upon him, for all the world like dogs.</p>

<p>Calm and dignified he ran his hands over them feeling their
muscles, and then forced back their lips and examined their teeth
and mouths.</p>

<p>"Two hundred and twenty for the twain," he said, and the dalal
passed on with his wares, announcing the increased price he had
been offered.</p>

<p>Thus he completed the circuit and came to stand once more before
Ali.</p>

<p>"Two hundred and twenty is now the price, O Ali! By the Koran,
they are worth three hundred at the least. Wilt say three
hundred?"</p>

<p>"Two hundred and thirty," was the answer.</p>

<p>Back to the Moor went the dalal. "Two hundred and thirty I am
now offered, O Hamet. Thou wilt give another twenty?"</p>

<p>"Not I, by Allah!" said Hamet, and resumed his seat. "Let him
have them."</p>

<p>"Another ten philips?" pleaded the dalal.</p>

<p>"Not another asper."</p>

<p>"They are thine, then, O Ali, for two hundred and thirty. Give
thanks to Allah for so good a bargain."</p>

<p>The Nubians were surrendered to Ali's followers, whilst the
dalal's two assistants advanced to settle accounts with the
corsair.</p>

<p>"Wait, wait," said he, "is not the name of Sakr-el-Bahr good
warranty?"</p>

<p>"The inviolable law is that the purchase money be paid ere a
slave leaves the market, O valiant Ali."</p>

<p>"It shall be observed," was the impatient answer, "and I will so
pay before they leave. But I want others yet, and we will make one
account an it please thee. That fellow yonder now. I have orders to
buy him for my captain." And he indicated Lionel, who stood at
Rosamund's side, the very incarnation of woefulness and
debility.</p>

<p>Contemptuous surprise flickered an instant in the eyes of the
dalal. But this he made haste to dissemble.</p>

<p>"Bring forth that yellow-haired infidel," he commanded.</p>

<p>The corsairs laid hands on Lionel. He made a vain attempt to
struggle, but it was observed that the woman leaned over to him and
said something quickly, whereupon his struggles ceased and he
suffered himself to be dragged limply forth into the full view of
all the market.</p>

<p>"Dost want him for the oar, Ali?" cried Ayoub-el-Samin across
the quadrangle, a jest this that evoked a general laugh.</p>

<p>"What else?" quoth Ali. "He should be cheap at least."</p>

<p>"Cheap?" quoth the dalal in an affectation of surprise. "Nay,
now. 'Tis a comely fellow and a young one. What wilt thou give,
now? a hundred philips?"</p>

<p>"A hundred philips!" cried Ali derisively. "A hundred philips
for that skinful of bones! Ma'sh'-Allah! Five philips is my price,
O dalal."</p>

<p>Again laughter crackled through the mob. But the dalal stiffened
with increasing dignity. Some of that laughter seemed to touch
himself, and he was not a person to be made the butt of mirth.</p>

<p>"'Tis a jest, my master," said he, with a forgiving yet
contemptuous wave. "Behold how sound he is." He signed to one of
the corsairs, and Lionel's doublet was slit from neck to girdle and
wrenched away from his body, leaving him naked to the waist, and
displaying better proportions than might have been expected. In a
passion at that indignity Lionel writhed in the grip of his guards,
until one of the corsairs struck him a light blow with a whip in
earnest of what to expect if he continued to be troublesome.
"Consider him now," said the dalal, pointing to that white torso.
"And behold how sound he is. See how excellent are his teeth." He
seized Lionel's head and forced the jaws apart.</p>

<p>"Ay," said Ali, "but consider me those lean shanks and that
woman's arm."</p>

<p>"'Tis a fault the oar will mend," the dalal insisted.</p>

<p>"You filthy blackamoors!" burst from Lionel in a sob of
rage.</p>

<p>"He is muttering curses in his infidel tongue," said Ali. "His
temper is none too good, you see. I have said five philips. I'll
say no more."</p>

<p>With a shrug the dalal began his circuit of the well, the
corsairs thrusting Lionel after him. Here one rose to handle him,
there another, but none seemed disposed to purchase.</p>

<p>"Five philips is the foolish price offered me for this fine
young Frank," cried the dalal. "Will no True-Believer pay ten for
such a slave? Wilt not thou, O Ayoub? Thou, Hamet&mdash;ten
philips?"</p>

<p>But one after another those to whom he was offered shook their
heads. The haggardness of Lionel's face was too unprepossessing.
They had seen slaves with that look before, and experience told
them that no good was ever to be done with such fellows. Moreover,
though shapely, his muscles were too slight, his flesh looked too
soft and tender. Of what use a slave who must be hardened and
nourished into strength, and who might very well die in the
process? Even at five philips he would be dear. So the disgusted
dalal came back to Ali.</p>

<p>"He is thine, then, for five philips&mdash;Allah pardon thy
avarice."</p>

<p>Ali grinned, and his men seized upon Lionel and bore him off
into the background to join the two negroes previously
purchased.</p>

<p>And then, before Ali could bid for another of the slaves he
desired to acquire, a tall, elderly Jew, dressed in black doublet
and hose like a Castilian gentleman, with a ruffle at his neck, a
plumed bonnet on his grey locks, and a serviceable dagger hanging
from his girdle of hammered gold, had claimed the attention of the
dalal.</p>

<p>In the pen that held the captives of the lesser raids conducted
by Biskaine sat an Andalusian girl of perhaps some twenty years, of
a beauty entirely Spanish.</p>

<p>Her face was of the warm pallor of ivory, her massed hair of an
ebony black, her eyebrows were finely pencilled, and her eyes of
deepest and softest brown. She was dressed in the becoming garb of
the Castilian peasant, the folded kerchief of red and yellow above
her bodice leaving bare the glories of her neck. She was very pale,
and her eyes were wild in their look, but this detracted nothing
from her beauty.</p>

<p>She had attracted the Jew's notice, and it is not impossible
that there may have stirred in him a desire to avenge upon her some
of the cruel wrongs, some of the rackings, burning, confiscations,
and banishment suffered by the men of his race at the hands of the
men of hers. He may have bethought him of invaded ghettos, of
Jewish maidens ravished, and Jewish children butchered in the name
of the God those Spanish Christians worshipped, for there was
something almost of contemptuous fierceness in his dark eyes and in
the hand he flung out to indicate her.</p>

<p>"Yonder is a Castilian wench for whom I will give fifty Philips,
O dalal," he announced. The datal made a sign, whereupon the
corsairs dragged her struggling forth.</p>

<p>"So much loveliness may not be bought for fifty Philips, O
Ibrahim," said he. "Yusuf here will pay sixty at least." And he
stood expectantly before a resplendent Moor.</p>

<p>The Moor, however, shook his head.</p>

<p>"Allah knows I have three wives who would destroy her loveliness
within the hour and so leave me the loser."</p>

<p>The dalal moved on, the girl following him but contesting every
step of the way with those who impelled her forward, and reviling
them too in hot Castilian. She drove her nails into the arms of one
and spat fiercely into the face of another of her corsair guards.
Rosamund's weary eyes quickened to horror as she watched
her&mdash;a horror prompted as much by the fate awaiting that poor
child as by the undignified fury of the futile battle she waged
against it. But it happened that her behaviour impressed a
Levantine Turk quite differently. He rose, a short squat figure,
from his seat on the steps of the well.</p>

<p>"Sixty Philips will I pay for the joy of taming that wild cat,"
said he.</p>

<p>But Ibrahim was not to be outbidden. He offered seventy, the
Turk countered with a bid of eighty, and Ibrahim again raised the
price to ninety, and there fell a pause.</p>

<p>The dalal spurred on the Turk. "Wilt thou be beaten then, and by
an Israelite? Shall this lovely maid be given to a perverter of the
Scriptures, to an inheritor of the fire, to one of a race that
would not bestow on their fellow-men so much as the speck out of a
date-stone? It were a shame upon a True-Believer."</p>

<p>Urged thus the Turk offered another five Philips, but with
obvious reluctance. The Jew, however, entirely unabashed by a
tirade against him, the like of which he heard a score of times a
day in the course of trading, pulled forth a heavy purse from his
girdle.</p>

<p>"Here are one hundred Philips," he announced. "'Tis overmuch.
But I offer it."</p>

<p>Ere the dalal's pious and seductive tongue could urge him
further the Turk sat down again with a gesture of finality.</p>

<p>"I give him joy of her," said he.</p>

<p>"She is thine, then, O Ibrahim, for one hundred philips."</p>

<p>The Israelite relinquished the purse to the dalal's white-robed
assistants and advanced to receive the girl. The corsairs thrust
her forward against him, still vainly battling, and his arms closed
about her for a moment.</p>

<p>"Thou has cost me dear, thou daughter of Spain," said he. "But I
am content. Come." And he made shift to lead her away. Suddenly,
however, fierce as a tiger-cat she writhed her arms upwards and
clawed at his face. With a scream of pain he relaxed his hold of
her and in that moment, quick as lightning she plucked the dagger
that hung from his girdle so temptingly within her reach.</p>

<p>"Valga me Dios!" she cried, and ere a hand could be raised to
prevent her she had buried the blade in her lovely breast and sank
in a laughing, coughing, heap at his feet. A final convulsive heave
and she lay there quite still, whilst Ibrahim glared down at her
with eyes of dismay, and over all the market there hung a hush of
sudden awe.</p>

<p>Rosamund had risen in her place, and a faint colour came to warm
her pallor, a faint light kindled in her eyes. God had shown her
the way through this poor Spanish girl, and assuredly God would
give her the means to take it when her own turn came. She felt
herself suddenly uplifted and enheartened. Death was a sharp, swift
severing, an easy door of escape from the horror that threatened
her, and God in His mercy, she knew, would justify self-murder
under such circumstances as were her own and that poor dead
Andalusian maid's.</p>

<p>At length Ibrahim roused himself from his momentary stupor. He
stepped deliberately across the body, his face inflamed, and stood
to beard the impassive dalal.</p>

<p>"She is dead!" he bleated. "I am defrauded. Give me back my
gold!"</p>

<p>"Are we to give back the price of every slave that dies?" the
dalal questioned him.</p>

<p>"But she was not yet delivered to me," raved the Jew. "My hands
had not touched her. Give me back my gold."</p>

<p>"Thou liest, son of a dog," was the answer, dispassionately
delivered. "She was thine already. I had so pronounced her. Bear
her hence, since she belongs to thee."</p>

<p>The Jew, his face empurpling, seemed to fight for breath.</p>

<p>"How?" he choked. "Am I to lose a hundred philips?"</p>

<p>"What is written is written," replied the serene dalal.</p>

<p>Ibrahim was frothing at the lips, his eyes were blood-injected.
"But it was never written that..."</p>

<p>"Peace," said the dalal. "Had it not been written it could not
have come to pass. It is the will of Allah! Who dares rebel against
it?"</p>

<p>The crowd began to murmur.</p>

<p>"I want my hundred philips," the Jew insisted, whereupon the
murmur swelled into a sudden roar.</p>

<p>"Thou hearest?" said the dalal. "Allah pardon thee, thou art
disturbing the peace of this market. Away, ere ill betide
thee."</p>

<p>"Hence! hence!" roared the crowd, and some advanced
threateningly upon the luckless Ibrahim. "Away, thou perverter of
Holy Writ! thou filth! thou dog! Away!"</p>

<p>Such was the uproar, such the menace of angry countenances and
clenched fists shaken in his very face, that Ibrahim quailed and
forgot his loss in fear.</p>

<p>"I go, I go," he said, and turned hastily to depart.</p>

<p>But the dalal summoned him back. "Take hence thy property," said
he, and pointed to the body. And so Ibrahim was forced to suffer
the further mockery of summoning his slaves to bear away the
lifeless body for which he had paid in lively potent gold.</p>

<p>Yet by the gates he paused again. "I will appeal me to the
Basha," he threatened. "Asad-ed-Din is just, and he will have my
money restored to me."</p>

<p>"So he will," said the dalal, "when thou canst restore the dead
to life," and he turned to the portly Ayoub, who was plucking at
his sleeve. He bent his head to catch the muttered words of
Fenzileh's wazeer. Then, in obedience to them, he ordered Rosamund
to be brought forward.</p>

<p>She offered no least resistance, advancing in a singularly
lifeless way, like a sleep-walker or one who had been drugged. In
the heat and glare of the open market she stood by the dalal's side
at the head of the well, whilst he dilated upon her physical merits
in that lingua franca which he used since it was current coin among
all the assorted races represented there&mdash;a language which the
knowledge of French that her residence in France had taught her she
was to her increasing horror and shame able to understand.</p>

<p>The first to make an offer for her was that same portly Moor who
had sought to purchase the two Nubians. He rose to scrutinize her
closely, and must have been satisfied, for the price he offered was
a good one, and he offered it with contemptuous assurance that he
would not be outbidden.</p>

<p>"One hundred philips for the milk-faced girl."</p>

<p>"'Tis not enough. Consider me the moon-bright loveliness of her
face," said the dalal as he moved on. "Chigil yields us fair women,
but no woman of Chigil was ever half so fair."</p>

<p>"One hundred and fifty," said the Levantine Turk with a
snap.</p>

<p>"Not yet enough. Behold the stately height which Allah hath
vouchsafed her. See the noble carriage of her head, the lustre of
her eye! By Allah, she is worthy to grace the Sultan's own
hareem."</p>

<p>He said no more than the buyers recognized to be true, and
excitement stirred faintly through their usually impassive ranks. A
Tagareen Moor named Yusuf offered at once two hundred.</p>

<p>But still the dalal continued to sing her praises. He held up
one of her arms for inspection, and she submitted with lowered
eyes, and no sign of resentment beyond the slow flush that spread
across her face and vanished again.</p>

<p>"Behold me these limbs, smooth as Arabian silks and whiter than
ivory. Look at those lips like pomegranate blossoms. The price is
now two hundred philips. What wilt thou give, O Hamet?"</p>

<p>Hamet showed himself angry that his original bid should so
speedily have been doubled. "By the Koran, I have purchased three
sturdy girls from the Sus for less."</p>

<p>"Wouldst thou compare a squat-faced girl from the Sus with this
narcissus-eyed glory of womanhood?" scoffed the dalal.</p>

<p>"Two hundred and ten, then," was Hamet's sulky grunt.</p>

<p>The watchful Tsamanni considered that the time had come to buy
her for his lord as he had been bidden.</p>

<p>"Three hundred," he said curtly, to make an end of matters,
and&mdash;</p>

<p>"Four hundred," instantly piped a shrill voice behind him.</p>

<p>He spun round in his amazement and met the leering face of
Ayoub. A murmur ran through the ranks of the buyers, the people
craned their necks to catch a glimpse of this open-handed
purchaser.</p>

<p>Yusuf the Tagareen rose up in a passion. He announced angrily
that never again should the dust of the sk of Algiers defile his
slippers, that never again would he come there to purchase
slaves.</p>

<p>"By the Well of Zem-Zem," he swore, "all men are bewitched in
this market. Four hundred philips for a Frankish girl! May Allah
increase your wealth, for verily you'll need it." And in his
supreme disgust he stalked to the gates, and elbowed his way
through the crowd, and so vanished from the sk.</p>

<p>Yet ere he was out of earshot her price had risen further.
Whilst Tsamanni was recovering from his surprise at the competitor
that had suddenly appeared before him, the dalal had lured an
increased offer from the Turk.</p>

<p>"'Tis a madness," the latter deplored. "But she pleaseth me, and
should it seem good to Allah the Merciful to lead her into the True
Faith she may yet become the light of my hareem. Four hundred and
twenty philips, then, O dalal, and Allah pardon me my
prodigality."</p>

<p>Yet scarcely was his little speech concluded than Tsamanni with
laconic eloquence rapped out: "Five hundred."</p>

<p>"Y'Allah!" cried the Turk, raising his hands to heaven, and
"Y'Allah!" echoed the crowd.</p>

<p>"Five hundred and fifty," shrilled Ayoub's voice above the
general din.</p>

<p>"Six hundred," replied Tsamanni, still unmoved.</p>

<p>And now such was the general hubbub provoked by these
unprecedented prices that the dalal was forced to raise his voice
and cry for silence.</p>

<p>When this was restored Ayoub at once raised the price to seven
hundred.</p>

<p>"Eight hundred," snapped Tsamanni, showing at last a little
heat.</p>

<p>"Nine hundred," replied Ayoub.</p>

<p>Tsamanni swung round upon him again, white now with fury.</p>

<p>"Is this a jest, O father of wind?" he cried, and excited
laughter by the taunt implicit in that appellation.</p>

<p>"And thou'rt the jester," replied Ayoub with forced calm,
"thou'lt find the jest a costly one."</p>

<p>With a shrug Tsamanni turned again to the dalal. "A thousand
philips," said he shortly.</p>

<p>"Silence there!" cried the dalal again. "Silence, and praise
Allah who sends good prices."</p>

<p>"One thousand and one hundred," said Ayoub the irrepressible</p>

<p>And now Tsamanni not only found himself outbidden, but he had
reached the outrageous limit appointed by Asad. He lacked authority
to go further, dared not do so without first consulting the Basha.
Yet if he left the sk for that purpose Ayoub would meanwhile
secure the girl. He found himself between sword and wall. On the
one hand did he permit himself to be outbidden his master might
visit upon him his disappointment. On the other, did he continue
beyond the limit so idly mentioned as being far beyond all
possibility, it might fare no less ill with him.</p>

<p>He turned to the crowd, waving his arms in furious
gesticulation. "By the beard of the Prophet, this bladder of wind
and grease makes sport of us. He has no intent to buy. What man
ever heard of the half of such a price for a slave girl?"</p>

<p>Ayoub's answer was eloquent; he produced a fat bag and flung it
on the ground, where it fell with a mellow chink. "There is my
sponsor," he made answer, grinning in the very best of humours,
savouring to the full his enemy's rage and discomfiture, and
savouring it at no cost to himself. "Shall I count out one thousand
and one hundred philips, O dalal."</p>

<p>"If the wazeer Tsamanni is content."</p>

<p>"Dost thou know for whom I buy?" roared Tsamanni. "For the Basha
himself, Asad-ed-Din, the exalted of Allah," He advanced upon Ayoub
with hands upheld. "What shalt thou say to him, O dog, when he
calls thee to account for daring to outbid him."</p>

<p>But Ayoub remained unruffled before all this fury. He spread his
fat hands, his eyes twinkling, his great lips pursed. "How should I
know, since Allah has not made me all-knowing? Thou shouldst have
said so earlier. 'Tis thus I shall answer the Basha should he
question me, and the Basha is just."</p>

<p>"I would not be thee, Ayoub&mdash;not for the throne of
Istambul."</p>

<p>"Nor I thee, Tsamanni; for thou art jaundiced with rage."</p>

<p>And so they stood glaring each at the other until the dalal
called them back to the business that was to do.</p>

<p>"The price is now one thousand and one hundred philips. Wilt
thou suffer defeat, O wazeer?"</p>

<p>"Since Allah wills. I have no authority to go further."</p>

<p>"Then at one thousand and one hundred philips, Ayoub, she
is..."</p>

<p>But the sale was not yet to be completed. From the dense and
eager throng about the gates rang a crisp voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"One thousand and two hundred philips for the Frankish
girl."</p>

<p>The dalal, who had conceived that the limits of madness had been
already reached, stood gaping now in fresh amazement. The mob
crowed and cheered and roared between enthusiasm and derision, and
even Tsamanni brightened to see another champion enter the lists
who perhaps would avenge him upon Ayoub. The crowd parted quickly
to right and left, and through it into the open strode
Sakr-el-Bahr. They recognized him instantly, and his name was
shouted in acclamation by that idolizing multitude.</p>

<p>That Barbary name of his conveyed no information to Rosamund,
and her back being turned to the entrance she did not see him. But
she had recognized his voice, and she had shuddered at the sound.
She could make nothing of the bidding, nor what the purpose that
surely underlay it to account for the extraordinary excitement of
the traders. Vaguely had she been wondering what dastardly purpose
Oliver might intend to serve, but now that she heard his voice that
wonder ceased and understanding took its place. He had hung there
somewhere in the crowd waiting until all competitors but one should
have been outbidden, and now he stepped forth to buy her for his
own&mdash;his slave! She closed her eyes a moment and prayed God
that he might not prevail in his intent. Any fate but that; she
would rob him even of the satisfaction of driving her to sheathe a
poniard in her heart as that poor Andalusian girl had done. A wave
almost of unconsciousness passed over her in the intensity of her
horror. For a moment the ground seemed to rock and heave under her
feet.</p>

<p>Then the dizziness passed, and she was herself again. She heard
the crowd thundering "Ma'sh'Allah!" and "Sakr-el-Bahr!" and the
dalal clamouring sternly for silence. When this was at last
restored she heard his exclamation&mdash;</p>

<p>"The glory to Allah who sends eager buyers! What sayest thou, O
wazeer Ayoub?"</p>

<p>"Ay!" sneered Tsamanni, "what now?"</p>

<p>"One thousand and three hundred," said Ayoub with a quaver of
uneasy defiance.</p>

<p>"Another hundred, O dalal," came from Sakr-el-Bahr in a quiet
voice.</p>

<p>"One thousand and five hundred," screamed Ayoub, thus reaching
not only the limit imposed by his mistress, but the very limit of
the resources at her immediate disposal. Gone, too, with that bid
was all hope of profit to himself.</p>

<p>But Sakr-el-Bahr, impassive as Fate, and without so much as
deigning to bestow a look upon the quivering eunuch, said
again&mdash;</p>

<p>"Another hundred, O dalal."</p>

<p>"One thousand and six hundred philips!" cried the dalal, more in
amazement than to announce the figure reached. Then controlling his
emotions he bowed his head in reverence and made confession of his
faith. "All things are possible if Allah wills them. The praise to
Him who sends wealthy buyers."</p>

<p>He turned to the crestfallen Ayoub, so crestfallen that in the
contemplation of him Tsamanni was fast gathering consolation for
his own discomfiture, vicariously tasting the sweets of vengeance.
"What say you now, O perspicuous wazeer?"</p>

<p>"I say," choked Ayoub, "that since by the favour of Shaitan he
hath so much wealth he must prevail."</p>

<p>But the insulting words were scarcely uttered than
Sakr-el-Bahr's great hand had taken the wazeer by the nape of his
fat neck, a growl of anger running through the assembly to approve
him.</p>

<p>"By the favour of Shaitan, sayest thou, thou sex-less dog?" he
growled, and tightened his grip so that the wazeer squirmed and
twisted in an agony of pain. Down was his head thrust, and still
down, until his fat body gave way and he lay supine and writhing in
the dust of the sk. "Shall I strangle thee, thou father of filth,
or shall I fling thy soft flesh to the hooks to teach thee what is
a man's due from thee?" And as he spoke he rubbed the too daring
fellow's face roughly on the ground.</p>

<p>"Mercy!" squealed the wazeer. "Mercy, O mighty Sakr-el-Bahr, as
thou lookest for mercy!"</p>

<p>"Unsay thy words, thou offal. Pronounce thyself a liar and a
dog."</p>

<p>"I do unsay them. I have foully lied. Thy wealth is the reward
sent thee by Allah for thy glorious victories over the
unbelieving."</p>

<p>"Put out thine offending tongue," said Sakr-el-Bahr, "and
cleanse it in the dust. Put it forth, I say."</p>

<p>Ayoub obeyed him in fearful alacrity, whereupon Sakr-el-Bahr
released his hold and allowed the unfortunate fellow to rise at
last, half-choked with dirt, livid of face, and quaking like a
jelly, an object of ridicule and cruel mockery to all
assembled.</p>

<p>"Now get thee hence, ere my sea-hawks lay their talons on thee.
Go!"</p>

<p>Ayoub departed in all haste to the increasing jeers of the
multitude and the taunts of Tsamanni, whilst Sakr-el-Bahr turned
him once more to the dalal.</p>

<p>"At one thousand and six hundred philips this slave is thine, O
Sakr-el-Bahr, thou glory of Islam. May Allah increase thy
victories!"</p>

<p>"Pay him, Ali," said the corsair shortly, and he advanced to
receive his purchase.</p>

<p>Face to face stood he now with Rosamund, for the first time
since that day before the encounter with the Dutch argosy when he
had sought her in the cabin of the carack.</p>

<p>One swift glance she bestowed on him, then, her senses reeling
with horror at her circumstance, she shrank back, her face of a
deathly pallor. In his treatment of Ayoub she had just witnessed
the lengths of brutality of which he was capable, and she was not
to know that this brutality had been a deliberate piece of mummery
calculated to strike terror into her.</p>

<p>Pondering her now he smiled a tight-lipped cruel smile that only
served to increase her terror.</p>

<p>"Come," he said in English.</p>

<p>She cowered back against the dalal as if for protection.
Sakr-el-Bahr reached forward, caught her by the wrists, and almost
tossed her to his Nubians, Abiad and Zal-Zer, who were attending
him.</p>

<p>"Cover her face," he bade them. "Bear her to my house.
Away!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2-11" id="ch2-11"></a>CHAPTER XI &mdash; THE
TRUTH</h2>

<p>The sun was dipping swiftly to the world's rim when Sakr-el-Bahr
with his Nubians and his little retinue of corsairs came to the
gates of that white house of his on its little eminence outside the
Bab-el-Oueb and beyond the walls of the city.</p>

<p>When Rosamund and Lionel, brought in the wake of the corsair,
found themselves in the spacious courtyard beyond the dark and
narrow entrance, the blue of the sky contained but the paling
embers of the dying day, and suddenly, sharply upon the evening
stillness, came a mueddin's voice calling the faithful unto
prayer.</p>

<p>Slaves fetched water from the fountain that played in the middle
of the quadrangle and tossed aloft a slender silvery spear of water
to break into a myriad gems and so shower down into the broad
marble basin. Sakr-el-Bahr washed, as did his followers, and then
he went down upon the praying-mat that had been set for him, whilst
his corsairs detached their cloaks and spread them upon the ground
to serve them in like stead.</p>

<p>The Nubians turned the two slaves about, lest their glances
should defile the orisons of the faithful, and left them so facing
the wall and the green gate that led into the garden whence were
wafted on the cooling air the perfumes of jessamine and lavender.
Through the laths of the gate they might have caught a glimpse of
the riot of colour there, and they might have seen the slaves
arrested by the Persian waterwheel at which they had been toiling
and chanting until the call to prayer had come to strike them into
statues.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr rose from his devotions, uttered a sharp word of
command, and entered the house. The Nubians followed him, urging
their captives before them up the narrow stairs, and so brought
them out upon the terrace on the roof, that space which in Eastern
houses is devoted to the women, but which no woman's foot had ever
trodden since this house had been tenanted by Sakr-el-Bahr the
wifeless.</p>

<p>This terrace, which was surrounded by a parapet some four feet
high, commanded a view of the city straggling up the hillside to
eastward, from the harbour and of the island at the end of the mole
which had been so laboriously built by the labour of Christian
slaves from the stones of the ruined fortress&mdash;the Peon,
which Kheyr-ed-Din Barbarossa had wrested from the Spaniards. The
deepening shroud of evening was now upon all, transmuting white and
yellow walls alike to a pearly greyness. To westward stretched the
fragrant gardens of the house, where the doves were murmuring
fondly among the mulberries and lotus trees. Beyond it a valley
wound its way between the shallow hills, and from a pool fringed
with sedges and bullrushes above which a great stork was
majestically sailing came the harsh croak of frogs.</p>

<p>An awning supported upon two gigantic spears hung out from the
southern wall of the terrace which rose to twice the height of that
forming the parapet on its other three sides. Under this was a
divan and silken cushions, and near it a small Moorish table of
ebony inlaid with mother-of-pearl and gold. Over the opposite
parapet, where a lattice had been set, rioted a trailing rose-tree
charged with blood-red blossoms, though now their colours were
merged into the all-encompassing greyness.</p>

<p>Here Lionel and Rosamund looked at each other in the dim light,
their faces gleaming ghostly each to each, whilst the Nubians stood
like twin statues by the door that opened from the stair-head.</p>

<p>The man groaned, and clasped his hands before him. The doublet
which had been torn from him in the sk had since been restored and
temporarily repaired by a strand of palmetto cord. But he was
woefully bedraggled. Yet his thoughts, if his first words are to be
taken as an indication of them, were for Rosamund's condition
rather than his own.</p>

<p>"O God, that you should be subjected to this!" he cried. "That
you should have suffered what you have suffered! The humiliation of
it, the barbarous cruelty! Oh!" He covered his haggard face with
his hands.</p>

<p>She touched him gently on the arm.</p>

<p>"What I have suffered is but a little thing," she said, and her
voice was wonderfully steady and soothing. Have I not said that
these Godolphins were brave folk? Even their women were held to
have something of the male spirit in their breasts; and to this
none can doubt that Rosamund now bore witness. "Do not pity me,
Lionel, for my sufferings are at an end or very nearly." She smiled
strangely, the smile of exaltation that you may see upon the
martyr's face in the hour of doom.</p>

<p>"How?" quoth he, in faint surprise.</p>

<p>"How?" she echoed. "Is there not always a way to thrust aside
life's burden when it grows too heavy&mdash;heavier than God would
have us bear?"</p>

<p>His only answer was a groan. Indeed, he had done little but
groan in all the hours they had spent together since they were
brought ashore from the carack; and had the season permitted her so
much reflection, she might have considered that she had found him
singularly wanting during those hours of stress when a man of worth
would have made some effort, however desperate, to enhearten her
rather than repine upon his own plight.</p>

<p>Slaves entered bearing four enormous flaming torches which they
set in iron sconces protruding from the wall of the house. Thence
they shed a lurid ruddy glow upon the terrace. The slaves departed
again, and presently, in the black gap of the doorway between the
Nubians, a third figure appeared unheralded. It was
Sakr-el-Bahr.</p>

<p>He stood a moment at gaze, his attitude haughty, his face
expressionless; then slowly he advanced. He was dressed in a short
white caftan that descended to his knees, and was caught about his
waist in a shimmering girdle of gold that quivered like fire in the
glow of the torches as he moved. His arms from the elbow and his
legs from the knee were bare, and his feet were shod with
gold-embroidered red Turkish slippers. He wore a white turban
decked by a plume of osprey attached by a jewelled clasp.</p>

<p>He signed to the Nubians and they vanished silently, leaving him
alone with his captives.</p>

<p>He bowed to Rosamund. "This, mistress," he said, "is to be your
domain henceforth which is to treat you more as wife than slave.
For it is to Muslim wives that the housetops in Barbary are
allotted. I hope you like it."</p>

<p>Lionel, staring at him out of a white face, his conscience
bidding him fear the very worst, his imagination painting a
thousand horrid fates for him and turning him sick with dread,
shrank back before his half-brother, who scarce appeared to notice
him just then.</p>

<p>But Rosamund confronted him, drawn to the full of her splendid
height, and if her face was pale, yet it was as composed and calm
as his own; if her bosom rose and fell to betray her agitations yet
her glance was contemptuous and defiant, her voice calm and steady,
when she answered him with the question&mdash;"What is your intent
with me?"</p>

<p>"My intent?" said he, with a little twisted smile. Yet for all
that he believed he hated her and sought to hurt, to humble and to
crush her, he could not stifle his admiration of her spirit's
gallantry in such an hour as this.</p>

<p>From behind the hills peeped the edge of the moon&mdash;a sickle
of burnished copper.</p>

<p>"My intent is not for you to question," he replied. "There was a
time, Rosamund, when in all the world you had no slave more utter
than was I. Yourself in your heartlessness, and in your lack of
faith, you broke the golden fetters of that servitude. You'll find
it less easy to break the shackles I now impose upon you."</p>

<p>She smiled her scorn and quiet confidence. He stepped close to
her. "You are my slave, do you understand?&mdash;bought in the
market-place as I might buy me a mule, a goat, or a camel&mdash;and
belonging to me body and soul. You are my property, my thing, my
chattel, to use or abuse, to cherish or break as suits my whim,
without a will that is not my will, holding your very life at my
good pleasure."</p>

<p>She recoiled a step before the dull hatred that throbbed in his
words, before the evil mockery of his swarthy bearded face.</p>

<p>"You beast!" she gasped.</p>

<p>"So now you understand the bondage into which you are come in
exchange for the bondage which in your own wantonness you
dissolved."</p>

<p>"May God forgive you," she panted.</p>

<p>"I thank you for that prayer," said he. "May He forgive you no
less."</p>

<p>And then from the background came an inarticulate sound, a
strangled, snarling sob from Lionel.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr turned slowly. He eyed the fellow a moment in
silence, then he laughed.</p>

<p>"Ha! My sometime brother. A pretty fellow, as God lives, is it
not? Consider him, Rosamund. Behold how gallantly misfortune is
borne by this pillar of manhood upon which you would have leaned,
by this stalwart husband of your choice. Look at him! Look at this
dear brother of mine."</p>

<p>Under the lash of that mocking tongue Lionel's mood was stung to
anger where before it had held naught but fear.</p>

<p>"You are no brother of mine," he retorted fiercely. "Your mother
was a wanton who betrayed my father."</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr quivered a moment as if he had been struck. Yet he
controlled himself.</p>

<p>"Let me hear my mother's name but once again on thy foul tongue,
and I'll have it ripped out by the roots. Her memory, I thank God,
is far above the insults of such a crawling thing as you. None the
less, take care not to speak of the only woman whose name I
reverence."</p>

<p>And then turning at bay, as even the rat will do, Lionel sprang
upon him, with clawing hands outstretched to reach his throat. But
Sakr-el-Bahr caught him in a grip that bent him howling to his
knees.</p>

<p>"You find me strong, eh?" he gibed. "Is it matter for wonder?
Consider that for six endless months I toiled at the oar of a
galley, and you'll understand what it was that turned my body into
iron and robbed me of a soul."</p>

<p>He flung him off, and sent him crashing into the rosebush and
the lattice over which it rambled.</p>

<p>"Do you realize the horror of the rower's bench? to sit day in
day out, night in night out, chained naked to the oar, amid the
reek and stench of your fellows in misfortune, unkempt, unwashed
save by the rain, broiled and roasted by the sun, festering with
sores, lashed and cut and scarred by the boatswain's whip as you
faint under the ceaseless, endless, cruel toil?"</p>

<p>"Do you realize it?" From a tone of suppressed fury his voice
rose suddenly to a roar. "You shall. For that horror which was mine
by your contriving shall now be yours until you die."</p>

<p>He paused; but Lionel made no attempt to avail himself of this.
His courage all gone out of him again, as suddenly as it had
flickered up, he cowered where he had been flung.</p>

<p>"Before you go there is something else," Sakr-el-Bahr resumed,
"something for which I have had you brought hither to-night.</p>

<p>"Not content with having delivered me to all this, not content
with having branded me a murderer, destroyed my good name, filched
my possessions and driven me into the very path of hell, you must
further set about usurping my place in the false heart of this
woman I once loved."</p>

<p>"I hope," he went on reflectively, "that in your own poor way
you love her, too, Lionel. Thus to the torment that awaits your
body shall be added torment for your treacherous soul&mdash;such
torture of mind as only the damned may know. To that end have I
brought you hither. That you may realize something of what is in
store for this woman at my hands; that you may take the thought of
it with you to be to your mind worse than the boatswain's lash to
your pampered body."</p>

<p>"You devil!" snarled Lionel. "Oh, you fiend out of hell!"</p>

<p>"If you will manufacture devils, little toad of a brother, do
not upbraid them for being devils when next you meet them."</p>

<p>"Give him no heed, Lionel!" said Rosamund. "I shall prove him as
much a boaster as he has proved himself a villain. Never think that
he will be able to work his evil will."</p>

<p>"'Tis you are the boaster there," said Sakr-el-Bahr. "And for
the rest, I am what you and he, between you, have made me."</p>

<p>"Did we make you liar and coward?&mdash;for that is what you are
indeed," she answered.</p>

<p>"Coward?" he echoed, in genuine surprise. "'Twill be some lie
that he has told you with the others. In what, pray, was I ever a
coward?"</p>

<p>"In what? In this that you do now; in this taunting and
torturing of two helpless beings in our power."</p>

<p>"I speak not of what I am," he replied, "for I have told you
that I am what you have made me. I speak of what I was. I speak of
the past."</p>

<p>She looked at him and she seemed to measure him with her
unwavering glance.</p>

<p>"You speak of the past?" she echoed, her voice low. "You speak
of the past and to me? You dare?"</p>

<p>"It is that we might speak of it together that I have fetched
you all the way from England; that at last I may tell you things I
was a fool to have kept from you five years ago; that we may resume
a conversation which you interrupted when you dismissed me."</p>

<p>"I did you a monstrous injury, no doubt," she answered him, with
bitter irony. "I was surely wanting in consideration. It would have
become me better to have smiled and fawned upon my brother's
murderer."</p>

<p>"I swore to you, then, that I was not his murderer," he reminded
her in a voice that shook.</p>

<p>"And I answered you that you lied."</p>

<p>"Ay, and on that you dismissed me&mdash;the word of the man whom
you professed to love, the word of the man to whom you had given
your trust weighing for naught with you."</p>

<p>"When I gave you my trust," she retorted, "I did so in ignorance
of your true self, in a headstrong wilful ignorance that would not
be guided by what all the world said of you and your wild ways. For
that blind wilfulness I have been punished, as perhaps I deserved
to be."</p>

<p>"Lies&mdash;all lies!" he stormed. "Those ways of mine&mdash;and
God knows they were none so wild, when all is said&mdash;I
abandoned when I came to love you. No lover since the world began
was ever so cleansed, so purified, so sanctified by love as was
I."</p>

<p>"Spare me this at least!" she cried on a note of loathing.</p>

<p>"Spare you?" he echoed. "What shall I spare you?"</p>

<p>"The shame of it all; the shame that is ever mine in the
reflection that for a season I believed I loved you."</p>

<p>He smiled. "If you can still feel shame, it shall overwhelm you
ere I have done. For you shall hear me out. Here there are none to
interrupt us, none to thwart my sovereign will. Reflect then, and
remember. Remember what a pride you took in the change you had
wrought in me. Your vanity welcomed that flattery, that tribute to
the power of your beauty. Yet, all in a moment, upon the paltriest
grounds, you believed me the murderer of your brother."</p>

<p>"The paltriest grounds?" she cried, protesting almost despite
herself.</p>

<p>"So paltry that the justices at Truro would not move against
me."</p>

<p>"Because," she cut in, "they accounted that you had been
sufficiently provoked. Because you had not sworn to them as you
swore to me that no provocation should ever drive you to raise your
hand against my brother. Because they did not realize how false and
how forsworn you were."</p>

<p>He considered her a moment. Then he took a turn on the terrace.
Lionel crouching ever by the rose-tree was almost entirely
forgotten by him now.</p>

<p>"God give me patience with you!" he said at length. "I need it.
For I desire you to understand many things this night. I mean you
to see how just is my resentment; how just the punishment that is
to overtake you for what you have made of my life and perhaps of my
hereafter. Justice Baine and another who is dead, knew me for
innocent."</p>

<p>"They knew you for innocent?" There was scornful amazement in
her tone. "Were they not witnesses of the quarrel betwixt you and
Peter and of your oath that you would kill him?"</p>

<p>"That was an oath sworn in the heat of anger. Afterwards I
bethought me that he was your brother."</p>

<p>"Afterwards?" said she. "After you had murdered him?"</p>

<p>"I say again," Oliver replied calmly, "that I did not do this
thing."</p>

<p>"And I say again that you lie."</p>

<p>He considered her for a long moment; then he laughed. "Have you
ever," he asked, "known a man to lie without some purpose? Men lie
for the sake of profit, they lie out of cowardice or malice, or
else because they are vain and vulgar boasters. I know of no other
causes that will drive a man to falsehood, save that&mdash;ah,
yes!&mdash;" (and he flashed a sidelong glance at
Lionel)&mdash;"save that sometimes a man will lie to shield
another, out of self-sacrifice. There you have all the spurs that
urge a man to falsehood. Can any of these be urging me to-night?
Reflect! Ask yourself what purpose I could serve by lying to you
now. Consider further that I have come to loathe you for your
unfaith; that I desire naught so much as to punish you for that and
for all its bitter consequences to me that I have brought you
hither to exact payment from you to the uttermost farthing. What
end then can I serve by falsehood?"</p>

<p>"All this being so, what end could you serve by truth?" she
countered.</p>

<p>"To make you realize to the full the injustice that you did. To
make you understand the wrongs for which you are called to pay. To
prevent you from conceiving yourself a martyr; to make you perceive
in all its deadly bitterness that what now comes to you is the
inevitable fruit of your own faithlessness."</p>

<p>"Sir Oliver, do you think me a fool?" she asked him.</p>

<p>"Madam, I do&mdash;and worse," he answered.</p>

<p>"Ay, that is clear," she agreed scornfully, "since even now you
waste breath in attempting to persuade me against my reason. But
words will not blot out facts. And though you talk from now till
the day of judgment no word of yours can efface those bloodstains
in the snow that formed a trail from that poor murdered body to
your own door; no word of yours can extinguish the memory of the
hatred between him and you, and of your own threat to kill him; nor
can it stifle the recollection of the public voice demanding your
punishment. You dare to take such a tone as you are taking with me?
You dare here under Heaven to stand and lie to me that you may give
false gloze to the villainy of your present deed&mdash;for that is
the purpose of your falsehood, since you asked me what purpose
there could be for it. What had you to set against all that, to
convince me that your hands were clean, to induce me to keep the
troth which&mdash;God forgive me!&mdash;I had plighted to you?"</p>

<p>"My word," he answered her in a ringing voice.</p>

<p>"Your lie," she amended.</p>

<p>"Do not suppose," said he, "that I could not support my word by
proofs if called upon to do so."</p>

<p>"Proofs?" She stared at him, wide-eyed a moment. Then her lip
curled. "And that no doubt was the reason of your flight when you
heard that the Queen's pursuivants were coming in response to the
public voice to call you to account."</p>

<p>He stood at gaze a moment, utterly dumbfounded. "My flight?" he
said. "What fable's that?"</p>

<p>"You will tell me next that you did not flee. That that is
another false charge against you?"</p>

<p>"So," he said slowly, "it was believed I fled!"</p>

<p>And then light burst upon him, to dazzle and stun him. It was so
inevitably what must have been believed, and yet it had never
crossed his mind. O the damnable simplicity of it! At another time
his disappearance must have provoked comment and investigation,
perhaps. But, happening when it did, the answer to it came promptly
and convincingly and no man troubled to question further. Thus was
Lionel's task made doubly easy, thus was his own guilt made doubly
sure in the eyes of all. His head sank upon his breast. What had he
done? Could he still blame Rosamund for having been convinced by so
overwhelming a piece of evidence? Could he still blame her if she
had burnt unopened the letter which he had sent her by the hand of
Pitt? What else indeed could any suppose, but that he had fled? And
that being so, clearly such a flight must brand him irrefutably for
the murderer he was alleged to be. How could he blame her if she
had ultimately been convinced by the only reasonable assumption
possible?</p>

<p>A sudden sense of the wrong he had done rose now like a tide
about him.</p>

<p>"My God!" he groaned, like a man in pain. "My God!"</p>

<p>He looked at her, and then averted his glance again, unable now
to endure the haggard, strained yet fearless gaze of those brave
eyes of hers.</p>

<p>"What else, indeed, could you believe?" he muttered brokenly,
thus giving some utterance to what was passing through his
mind.</p>

<p>"Naught else but the whole vile truth," she answered fiercely,
and thereby stung him anew, whipped him out of his sudden weakening
back to his mood of resentment and vindictiveness.</p>

<p>She had shown herself, he thought in that moment of reviving
anger, too ready to believe what told against him.</p>

<p>"The truth?" he echoed, and eyed her boldly now. "Do you know
the truth when you see it? We shall discover. For by God's light
you shall have the truth laid stark before you now, and you shall
find it hideous beyond all your hideous imaginings."</p>

<p>There was something so compelling now in his tone and manner
that it drove her to realize that some revelation was impending.
She was conscious of a faint excitement, a reflection perhaps of
the wild excitement that was astir in him.</p>

<p>"Your brother," he began, "met his death at the hands of a false
weakling whom I loved, towards whom I had a sacred duty. Straight
from the deed he fled to me for shelter. A wound he had taken in
the struggle left that trail of blood to mark the way he had come."
He paused, and his tone became gentler; it assumed the level note
of one who reasons impassively. "Was it not an odd thing, now, that
none should ever have paused to seek with certainty whence that
blood proceeded, and to consider that I bore no wound in those
days? Master Baine knew it, for I submitted my body to his
examination, and a document was drawn up and duly attested which
should have sent the Queen's pursuivants back to London with
drooping tails had I been at Penarrow to receive them."</p>

<p>Faintly through her mind stirred the memory that Master Baine
had urged the existence of some such document, that in fact he had
gone so far as to have made oath of this very circumstance now
urged by Sir Oliver; and she remembered that the matter had been
brushed aside as an invention of the justice's to answer the charge
of laxity in the performance of his duty, particularly as the only
co-witness he could cite was Sir Andrew Flack, the parson, since
deceased. Sir Oliver's voice drew her attention from that
memory.</p>

<p>"But let that be," he was saying. "Let us come back to the story
itself. I gave the craven weakling shelter. Thereby I drew down
suspicion upon myself, and since I could not clear myself save by
denouncing him, I kept silent. That suspicion drew to certainty
when the woman to whom I was betrothed, recking nothing of my
oaths, freely believing the very worst of me, made an end of our
betrothal and thereby branded me a murderer and a liar in the eyes
of all. Indignation swelled against me. The Queen's pursuivants
were on their way to do what the justices of Truro refused to
do.</p>

<p>"So far I have given you facts. Now I give you surmise&mdash;my
own conclusions&mdash;but surmise that strikes, as you shall judge,
the very bull's-eye of truth. That dastard to whom I had given
sanctuary, to whom I had served as a cloak, measured my nature by
his own and feared that I must prove unequal to the fresh burden to
be cast upon me. He feared lest under the strain of it I should
speak out, advance my proofs, and so destroy him. There was the
matter of that wound, and there was something still more
unanswerable he feared I might have urged. There was a certain
woman&mdash;a wanton up at Malpas&mdash;who could have been made to
speak, who could have revealed a rivalry concerning her betwixt the
slayer and your brother. For the affair in which Peter Godolphin
met his death was a pitifully, shamefully sordid one at
bottom."</p>

<p>For the first time she interrupted him, fiercely. "Do you malign
the dead?"</p>

<p>"Patience, mistress," he commanded. "I malign none. I speak the
truth of a dead man that the truth may be known of two living ones.
Hear me out, then! I have waited long and survived a deal that I
might tell you this.</p>

<p>"That craven, then, conceived that I might become a danger to
him; so he decided to remove me. He contrived to have me kidnapped
one night and put aboard a vessel to be carried to Barbary and sold
there as a slave. That is the truth of my disappearance. And the
slayer, whom I had befriended and sheltered at my own bitter cost,
profited yet further by my removal. God knows whether the prospect
of such profit was a further temptation to him. In time he came to
succeed me in my possessions, and at last to succeed me even in the
affections of the faithless woman who once had been my affianced
wife."</p>

<p>At last she started from the frozen patience in which she had
listened hitherto. "Do you say that...that Lionel...?" she was
beginning in a voice choked by indignation.</p>

<p>And then Lionel spoke at last, straightening himself into a
stiffly upright attitude.</p>

<p>"He lies!" he cried. "He lies, Rosamund! Do not heed him."</p>

<p>"I do not," she answered, turning away.</p>

<p>A wave of colour suffused the swarthy face of Sakr-el-Bahr. A
moment his eyes followed her as she moved away a step or two, then
they turned their blazing light of anger upon Lionel. He strode
silently across to him, his mien so menacing that Lionel shrank
back in fresh terror.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr caught his brother's wrist in a grip that was as
that of a steel manacle. "We'll have the truth this night if we
have to tear it from you with red-hot pincers," he said between his
teeth.</p>

<p>He dragged him forward to the middle of the terrace and held him
there before Rosamund, forcing him down upon his knees into a
cowering attitude by the violence of that grip upon his wrist.</p>

<p>"Do you know aught of the ingenuity of Moorish torture?" he
asked him. "You may have heard of the rack and the wheel and the
thumbscrew at home. They are instruments of voluptuous delight
compared with the contrivances of Barbary to loosen stubborn
tongues."</p>

<p>White and tense, her hands clenched, Rosamund seemed to stiffen
before him.</p>

<p>"You coward! You cur! You craven renegade dog!" she branded
him.</p>

<p>Oliver released his brother's wrist and beat his hands together.
Without heeding Rosamund he looked down upon Lionel, who cowered
shuddering at his feet.</p>

<p>"What do you say to a match between your fingers? Or do you
think a pair of bracelets of living fire would answer better, to
begin with?"</p>

<p>A squat, sandy-bearded, turbaned fellow, rolling slightly in his
gait, came&mdash;as had been prearranged&mdash;to answer the
corsair's summons.</p>

<p>With the toe of his slipper Sakr-el-Bahr stirred his
brother.</p>

<p>"Look up, dog," he bade him. "Consider me that man, and see if
you know him again. Look at him, I say!" And Lionel looked, yet
since clearly he did so without recognition his brother explained:
"His name among Christians was Jasper Leigh. He was the skipper you
bribed to carry me into Barbary. He was taken in his own toils when
his ship was sunk by Spaniards. Later he fell into my power, and
because I forebore from hanging him he is to-day my faithful
follower. I should bid him tell you what he knows," he continued,
turning to Rosamund, "if I thought you would believe his tale. But
since I am assured you would not, I will take other means." He
swung round to Jasper again. "Bid Ali heat me a pair of steel
manacles in a brazier and hold them in readiness against my need of
them." And he waved his hand.</p>

<p>Jasper bowed and vanished.</p>

<p>"The bracelets shall coax confession from your own lips, my
brother."</p>

<p>"I have naught to confess," protested Lionel. "You may force
lies from me with your ruffianly tortures."</p>

<p>Oliver smiled. "Not a doubt but that lies will flow from you
more readily than truth. But we shall have truth, too, in the end,
never doubt it." He was mocking, and there was a subtle purpose
underlying his mockery. "And you shall tell a full story," he
continued, "in all its details, so that Mistress Rosamund's last
doubt shall vanish. You shall tell her how you lay in wait for him
that evening in Godolphin Park; how you took him unawares,
and..."</p>

<p>"That is false!" cried Lionel in a passion of sincerity that
brought him to his feet.</p>

<p>It was false, indeed, and Oliver knew it, and deliberately had
recourse to falsehood, using it as a fulcrum upon which to lever
out the truth. He was cunning as all the fiends, and never perhaps
did he better manifest his cunning.</p>

<p>"False?" he cried with scorn. "Come, now, be reasonable. The
truth, ere torture sucks it out of you. Reflect that I know
all&mdash;exactly as you told it me. How was it, now? Lurking
behind a bush you sprang upon him unawares and ran him through
before he could so much as lay a hand to his sword, and so..."</p>

<p>"The lie of that is proven by the very facts themselves," was
the furious interruption. A subtle judge of tones might have
realized that here was truth indeed, angry indignant truth that
compelled conviction. "His sword lay beside him when they found
him."</p>

<p>But Oliver was loftily disdainful. "Do I not know? Yourself you
drew it after you had slain him."</p>

<p>The taunt performed its deadly work. For just one instant Lionel
was carried off his feet by the luxury of his genuine indignation,
and in that one instant he was lost.</p>

<p>"As God's my witness, that is false!" he cried wildly. "And you
know it. I fought him fair..."</p>

<p>He checked on a long, shuddering, indrawn breath that was
horrible to hear.</p>

<p>Then silence followed, all three remaining motionless as
statues: Rosamund white and tense, Oliver grim and sardonic, Lionel
limp, and overwhelmed by the consciousness of how he had been lured
into self-betrayal.</p>

<p>At last it was Rosamund who spoke, and her voice shook and
shifted from key to key despite her strained attempt to keep it
level.</p>

<p>"What...what did you say, Lionel?" she asked.</p>

<p>Oliver laughed softly. "He was about to add proof of his
statement, I think," he jeered. "He was about to mention the wound
he took in that fight, which left those tracks in the snow, thus to
prove that I lied&mdash;as indeed I did&mdash;when I said that he
took Peter unawares."</p>

<p>"Lionel!" she cried. She advanced a step and made as if to hold
out her arms to him, then let them fall again beside her. He stood
stricken, answering nothing. "Lionel!" she cried again, her voice
growing suddenly shrill. "Is this true?"</p>

<p>"Did you not hear him say it?" quoth Oliver.</p>

<p>She stood swaying a moment, looking at Lionel, her white face
distorted into a mask of unutterable pain. Oliver stepped towards
her, ready to support her, fearing that she was about to fall. But
with an imperious hand she checked his advance, and by a supreme
effort controlled her weakness. Yet her knees shook under her,
refusing their office. She sank down upon the divan and covered her
face with her hands.</p>

<p>"God pity me!" she moaned, and sat huddled there, shaken with
sobs.</p>

<p>Lionel started at that heart-broken cry. Cowering, he approached
her, and Oliver, grim and sardonic, stood back, a spectator of the
scene he had precipitated. He knew that given rope Lionel would
enmesh himself still further. There must be explanations that would
damn him utterly. Oliver was well content to look on.</p>

<p>"Rosamund!" came Lionel's piteous cry. "Rose! Have mercy! Listen
ere you judge me. Listen lest you misjudge me!"</p>

<p>"Ay, listen to him," Oliver flung in, with his soft hateful
laugh. "Listen to him. I doubt he'll be vastly entertaining."</p>

<p>That sneer was a spur to the wretched Lionel. "Rosamund, all
that he has told you of it is false. I...I...It was done in
self-defence. It is a lie that I took him unawares." His words came
wildly now. "We had quarrelled about...about...a certain matter,
and as the devil would have it we met that evening in Godolphin
Park, he and I. He taunted me; he struck me, and finally he drew
upon me and forced me to draw that I might defend my life. That is
the truth. I swear to you here on my knees in the sight of Heaven!
And..."</p>

<p>"Enough, sir! Enough!" she broke in, controlling herself to
check these protests that but heightened her disgust.</p>

<p>"Nay, hear me yet, I implore you; that knowing all you may be
merciful in your judgment."</p>

<p>"Merciful?" she cried, and almost seemed to laugh.</p>

<p>"It was an accident that I slew him," Lionel raved on. "I never
meant it. I never meant to do more than ward and preserve my life.
But when swords are crossed more may happen than a man intends. I
take God to witness that his death was an accident resulting from
his own fury."</p>

<p>She had checked her sobs, and she considered him now with eyes
that were hard and terrible.</p>

<p>"Was it also an accident that you left me and all the world in
the belief that the deed was your brother's?" she asked him.</p>

<p>He covered his face, as if unable to endure her glance. "Did you
but know how I loved you&mdash;even in those days, in
secret&mdash;you would perhaps pity me a little," he whimpered.</p>

<p>"Pity?" She leaned forward and seemed to spit the word at him.
"'Sdeath, man! Do you sue for pity&mdash;you?"</p>

<p>"Yet you must pity me did you know the greatness of the
temptation to which I succumbed."</p>

<p>"I know the greatness of your infamy, of your falseness, of your
cowardice, of your baseness. Oh!"</p>

<p>He stretched out suppliant hands to her; there were tears now in
his eyes. "Of your charity, Rosamund..." he was beginning, when at
last Oliver intervened:</p>

<p>"I think you are wearying the lady," he said, and stirred him
with his foot. "Relate to us instead some more of your astounding
accidents. They are more diverting. Elucidate the accident, by
which you had me kidnapped to be sold into slavery. Tell us of the
accident by which you succeeded to my property. Expound to the full
the accidental circumstances of which throughout you have been the
unfortunate victim. Come, man, ply your wits. 'Twill make a pretty
tale."</p>

<p>And then came Jasper to announce that Ali waited with the
brazier and the heated manacles.</p>

<p>"They are no longer needed," said Oliver. "Take this slave hence
with you. Bid Ali to take charge of him, and at dawn to see him
chained to one of the oars of my galeasse. Away with him."</p>

<p>Lionel rose to his feet, his face ashen. "Wait! Ah, wait!
Rosamund!" he cried.</p>

<p>Oliver caught him by the nape of his neck, spun him round, and
flung him into the arms of Jasper. "Take him away!" he growled, and
Jasper took the wretch by the shoulders and urged him out, leaving
Rosamund and Oliver alone with the truth under the stars of
Barbary.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2-12" id="ch2-12"></a>CHAPTER XII &mdash; THE
SUBTLETY OF FENZILEH</h2>

<p>Oliver considered the woman for a long moment as she sat
half-crouching on the divan, her hands locked, her face set and
stony, her eyes lowered. He sighed gently and turned away. He paced
to the parapet and looked out upon the city bathed in the white
glare of the full risen moon. There arose thence a hum of sound,
dominated, however, by the throbbing song of a nightingale
somewhere in his garden and the croaking of the frogs by the pool
in the valley.</p>

<p>Now that truth had been dragged from its well, and tossed, as it
were, into Rosamund's lap, he felt none of the fierce exultation
which he had conceived that such an hour as this must bring him.
Rather, indeed, was he saddened and oppressed. To poison the unholy
cup of joy which he had imagined himself draining with such thirsty
zest there was that discovery of a measure of justification for her
attitude towards him in her conviction that his disappearance was
explained by flight.</p>

<p>He was weighed down by a sense that he had put himself entirely
in the wrong; that in his vengeance he had overreached himself; and
he found the fruits of it, which had seemed so desirably luscious,
turning to ashes in his mouth.</p>

<p>Long he stood there, the silence between them entirely unbroken.
Then at length he stirred, turned from the parapet, and paced
slowly back until he came to stand beside the divan, looking down
upon her from his great height.</p>

<p>"At last you have heard the truth," he said. And as she made no
answer he continued: "I am thankful it was surprised out of him
before the torture was applied, else you might have concluded that
pain was wringing a false confession from him." He paused, but
still she did not speak; indeed, she made no sign that she had
heard him. "That," he concluded, "was the man whom you preferred to
me. Faith, you did not flatter me, as perhaps you may have
learnt."</p>

<p>At last she was moved from her silence, and her voice came dull
and hard. "I have learnt how little there is to choose between
you," she said. "It was to have been expected. I might have known
two brothers could not have been so dissimilar in nature. Oh, I am
learning a deal, and swiftly!"</p>

<p>It was a speech that angered him, that cast out entirely the
softer mood that had been growing in him.</p>

<p>"You are learning?" he echoed. "What are you learning?"</p>

<p>"Knowledge of the ways of men."</p>

<p>His teeth gleamed in his wry smile. "I hope the knowledge will
bring you as much bitterness as the knowledge of women&mdash;of one
woman&mdash;has brought me. To have believed me what you believed
me&mdash;me whom you conceived yourself to love!" He felt, perhaps
the need to repeat it that he might keep the grounds of his
grievance well before his mind.</p>

<p>"If I have a mercy to beg of you it is that you will not shame
me with the reminder."</p>

<p>"Of your faithlessness?" he asked. "Of your disloyal readiness
to believe the worst evil of me?"</p>

<p>"Of my ever having believed that I loved you. That is the
thought that shames me, as nothing else in life could shame me, as
not even the slave-market and all the insult to which you have
submitted me could shame me. You taunt me with my readiness to
believe evil of you..."</p>

<p>"I do more than taunt you with it," he broke in, his anger
mounting under the pitiless lash of her scorn. "I lay to your
charge the wasted years of my life, all the evil that has followed
out of it, all that I have suffered, all that I have lost, all that
I am become."</p>

<p>She looked up at him coldly, astonishingly mistress of herself.
"You lay all this to my charge?" she asked him.</p>

<p>"I do." He was very vehement. "Had you not used me as you did,
had you not lent a ready ear to lies, that whelp my brother would
never have gone to such lengths, nor should I ever have afforded
him the opportunity."</p>

<p>She shifted on the cushions of the divan and turned her shoulder
to him.</p>

<p>"All this is very idle," she said coldly. Yet perhaps because
she felt that she had need to justify herself she continued: "If,
after all, I was so ready to believe evil of you, it is that my
instincts must have warned me of the evil that was ever in you. You
have proved to me to-night that it was not you who murdered Peter;
but to attain that proof you have done a deed that is even fouler
and more shameful, a deed that reveals to the full the blackness of
your heart. Have you not proved yourself a monster of vengeance and
impiety?" She rose and faced him again in her sudden passion. "Are
you not&mdash;you that were born a Cornish Christian
gentleman&mdash;become a heathen and a robber, a renegade and a
pirate? Have you not sacrificed your very God to your vengeful
lust?"</p>

<p>He met her glance fully, never quailing before her denunciation,
and when she had ended on that note of question he
counter-questioned her.</p>

<p>"And your instincts had forewarned you of all this? God's life,
woman! can you invent no better tale than that?" He turned aside as
two slaves entered bearing an earthenware vessel. "Here comes your
supper. I hope your appetite is keener than your logic."</p>

<p>They set the vessel, from which a savoury smell proceeded, upon
the little Moorish table by the divan. On the ground beside it they
placed a broad dish of baked earth in which there were a couple of
loaves and a red, short-necked amphora of water with a drinking-cup
placed over the mouth of it to act as a stopper.</p>

<p>They salaamed profoundly and padded softly out again.</p>

<p>"Sup," he bade her shortly.</p>

<p>"I want no supper," she replied, her manner sullen.</p>

<p>His cold eye played over her. "Henceforth, girl, you will
consider not what you want, but what I bid you do. I bid you eat;
about it, therefore."</p>

<p>"I will not."</p>

<p>"Will not?" he echoed slowly. "Is that a speech from slave to
master? Eat, I say."</p>

<p>"I cannot! I cannot!" she protested.</p>

<p>"A slave may not live who cannot do her master's bidding."</p>

<p>"Then kill me," she answered fiercely, leaping up to confront
and dare him. "Kill me. You are used to killing, and for that at
least I should be grateful."</p>

<p>"I will kill you if I please," he said in level icy tones. "But
not to please you. You don't yet understand. You are my slave, my
thing, my property, and I will not suffer you to be damaged save at
my own good pleasure. Therefore, eat, or my Nubians shall whip you
to quicken appetite."</p>

<p>For a moment she stood defiant before him, white and resolute.
Then quite suddenly, as if her will was being bent and crumpled
under the insistent pressure of his own, she drooped and sank down
again to the divan. Slowly, reluctantly she drew the dish nearer.
Watching her, he laughed quite silently.</p>

<p>She paused, appearing to seek for something. Failing to find it
she looked up at him again, between scorn and intercession.</p>

<p>"Am I to tear the meat with my fingers?" she demanded.</p>

<p>His eyes gleamed with understanding, or at least with suspicion.
But he answered her quite calmly&mdash;"It is against the Prophet's
law to defile meat or bread by the contact of a knife. You must use
the hands that God has given you."</p>

<p>"Do you mock me with the Prophet and his laws? What are the
Prophet's laws to me? If eat I must, at least I will not eat like a
heathen dog, but in Christian fashion."</p>

<p>To indulge her, as it seemed, he slowly drew the richly hilted
dagger from his girdle. "Let that serve you, then," he said; and
carelessly he tossed it down beside her.</p>

<p>With a quick indrawn breath she pounced upon it. "At last," she
said, "you give me something for which I can be grateful to you."
And on the words she laid the point of it against her breast.</p>

<p>Like lightning he had dropped to one knee, and his hand had
closed about her wrist with such a grip that all her arm felt limp
and powerless. He was smiling into her eyes, his swarthy face close
to her own.</p>

<p>"Did you indeed suppose I trusted you? Did you really think me
deceived by your sudden pretence of yielding? When will you learn
that I am not a fool? I did it but to test your spirit."</p>

<p>"Then now you know its temper," she replied. "You know my
intention."</p>

<p>"Forewarned, forearmed," said he.</p>

<p>She looked at him, with something that would have been mockery
but for the contempt that coloured it too deeply. "Is it so
difficult a thing," she asked, "to snap the thread of life? Are
there no ways of dying save by the knife? You boast yourself my
master; that I am your slave; that, having bought me in the
market-place, I belong to you body and soul. How idle is that
boast. My body you may bind and confine; but my soul... Be very
sure that you shall be cheated of your bargain. You boast yourself
lord of life and death. A lie! Death is all that you can
command."</p>

<p>Quick steps came pattering up the stairs, and before he could
answer her, before he had thought of words in which to do so, Ali
confronted him with the astounding announcement that there was a
woman below asking urgently to speak with him.</p>

<p>"A woman?" he questioned, frowning. "A Nasrani woman, do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"No, my lord. A Muslim," was the still more surprising
information.</p>

<p>"A Muslim woman, here? Impossible!"</p>

<p>But even as he spoke a dark figure glided like a shadow across
the threshold on to the terrace. She was in black from head to
foot, including the veil that shrouded her, a veil of the
proportions of a mantle, serving to dissemble her very shape.</p>

<p>Ali swung upon her in a rage. "Did I not bid thee wait below,
thou daughter of shame?" he stormed. "She has followed me up, my
lord, to thrust herself in here upon you. Shall I drive her
forth?"</p>

<p>"Let her be," said Sakr-el-Bahr. And he waved Ali away. "Leave
us!"</p>

<p>Something about that black immovable figure arrested his
attention and fired his suspicions. Unaccountably almost it brought
to his mind the thought of Ayoub-el-Sarnin and the bidding there
had been for Rosamund in the sk.</p>

<p>He stood waiting for his visitor to speak and disclose herself.
She on her side continued immovable until Ali's footsteps had faded
in the distance. Then, with a boldness entirely characteristic,
with the recklessness that betrayed her European origin, intolerant
of the Muslim restraint imposed upon her sex, she did what no
True-Believing woman would have done. She tossed back that long
black veil and disclosed the pale countenance and languorous eyes
of Fenzileh.</p>

<p>For all that it was no more than he had expected, yet upon
beholding her&mdash;her countenance thus bared to his
regard&mdash;he recoiled a step.</p>

<p>"Fenzileh!" he cried. "What madness is this?"</p>

<p>Having announced herself in that dramatic fashion she composedly
readjusted her veil so that her countenance should once more be
decently concealed.</p>

<p>"To come here, to my house, and thus!" he protested. "Should
this reach the ears of thy lord, how will it fare with thee and
with me? Away, woman, and at once!" he bade her.</p>

<p>"No need to fear his knowing of this unless, thyself, thou tell
him," she answered. "To thee I need no excuse if thou'lt but
remember that like thyself I was not born a Muslim."</p>

<p>"But Algiers is not thy native Sicily, and whatever thou wast
born it were well to remember what thou art become."</p>

<p>He went on at length to tell her of the precise degree of her
folly, but she cut in, stemming his protestation in full flow.</p>

<p>"These are idle words that but delay me."</p>

<p>"To thy purpose then, in Allah's name, that thus thou mayest
depart the sooner."</p>

<p>She came to it straight enough on that uncompromising summons.
She pointed to Rosamund. "It concerns that slave," said she. "I
sent my wazeer to the sk to-day with orders to purchase her for
me."</p>

<p>"So I had supposed," he said.</p>

<p>"But it seems that she caught thy fancy, and the fool suffered
himself to be outbidden."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Thou'lt relinquish her to me at the price she cost thee?" A
faint note of anxiety trembled in her voice.</p>

<p>"I am anguished to deny thee, O Fenzileh. She is not for
sale."</p>

<p>"Ah, wait," she cried. "The price paid was high&mdash;many times
higher than I have ever heard tell was given for a slave, however
lovely. Yet I covet her. 'Tis a whim of mine, and I cannot suffer
to be thwarted in my whims. To gratify this one I will pay three
thousand philips."</p>

<p>He looked at her and wondered what devilries might be stirring
in her mind, what evil purpose she desired to serve.</p>

<p>"Thou'lt pay three thousand philips?" he said slowly. Then
bluntly asked her: "Why?"</p>

<p>"To gratify a whim, to please a fancy."</p>

<p>"What is the nature of this costly whim?" he insisted.</p>

<p>"The desire to possess her for my own," she answered
evasively.</p>

<p>"And this desire to possess her, whence is it sprung?" he
returned, as patient as he was relentless.</p>

<p>"You ask too many questions," she exclaimed with a flash of
anger.</p>

<p>He shrugged and smiled. "You answer too few."</p>

<p>She set her arms akimbo and faced him squarely. Faintly through
her veil he caught the gleam of her eyes, and he cursed the
advantage she had in that her face was covered from his
reading.</p>

<p>"In a word, Oliver-Reis," said she, "wilt sell her for three
thousand philips?"</p>

<p>"In a word&mdash;no," he answered her.</p>

<p>"Thou'lt not? Not for three thousand philips?" Her voice was
charged with surprise, and he wondered was it real or assumed.</p>

<p>"Not for thirty thousand," answered he. "She is mine, and I'll
not relinquish her. So since I have proclaimed my mind, and since
to tarry here is fraught with peril for us both, I beg thee to
depart."</p>

<p>There fell a little pause, and neither of them noticed the alert
interest stamped upon the white face of Rosamund. Neither of them
suspected her knowledge of French which enabled her to follow most
of what was said in the lingua franca they employed.</p>

<p>Fenzileh drew close to him. "Thou'lt not relinquish her, eh?"
she asked, and he was sure she sneered. "Be not so confident.
Thou'lt be forced to it, my friend&mdash;if not to me, why then, to
Asad. He is coming for her, himself, in person."</p>

<p>"Asad?" he cried, startled now.</p>

<p>"Asad-ed-Din," she answered, and upon that resumed her pleading.
"Come, then! It were surely better to make a good bargain with me
than a bad one with the Basha."</p>

<p>He shook his head and planted his feet squarely. "I intend to
make no bargain with either of you. This slave is not for
sale."</p>

<p>"Shalt thou dare resist Asad? I tell thee he will take her
whether she be for sale or not."</p>

<p>"I see," he said, his eyes narrowing. "And the fear of this,
then, is the source of thy whim to acquire her for thyself. Thou
art not subtle, O Fenzileh. The consciousness that thine own charms
are fading sets thee trembling lest so much loveliness should
entirely cast thee from thy lord's regard, eh?"</p>

<p>If he could not see her face, and study there the effect of that
thrust of his, at least he observed the quiver that ran through her
muffled figure; he caught the note of anger that throbbed in her
reply&mdash;"And if that were so, what is't to thee?"</p>

<p>"It may be much or little," he replied thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Indeed, it should be much," she answered quickly, breathlessly.
"Have I not ever been thy friend? Have I not ever urged thy valour
on my lord's notice and wrought like a true friend for thine
advancement, Sakr-el-Bahr?"</p>

<p>He laughed outright. "Hast thou so?" quoth he.</p>

<p>"Laugh as thou wilt, but it is true," she insisted. "Lose me and
thy most valuable ally is lost&mdash;one who has the ear and favour
of her lord. For look, Sakr-el-Bahr, it is what would befall if
another came to fill my place, another who might poison Asad's mind
with lies against thee&mdash;for surely she cannot love thee, this
Frankish girl whom thou hast torn from her home!"</p>

<p>"Be not concerned for that," he answered lightly, his wits
striving in vain to plumb the depths and discover the nature of her
purpose. "This slave of mine shall never usurp thy place beside
Asad."</p>

<p>"O fool, Asad will take her whether she be for sale or not."</p>

<p>He looked down upon her, head on one side and arms akimbo. "If
he can take her from me, the more easily can he take her from thee.
No doubt thou hast considered that, and in some dark Sicilian way
considered too how to provide against it. But the cost&mdash;hast
thou counted that? What will Asad say to thee when he learns how
thou hast thwarted him?"</p>

<p>"What do I care for that?" she cried in sudden fury, her
gestures becoming a little wild. "She will be at the bottom of the
harbour by then with a stone about her neck. He may have me
whipped. No doubt he will. But 'twill end there. He will require me
to console him for his loss, and so all will be well again."</p>

<p>At last he had drawn her, pumped her dry, as he imagined.
Indeed, indeed, he thought, he had been right to say she was not
subtle. He had been a fool to have permitted himself to be
intrigued by so shallow, so obvious a purpose. He shrugged and
turned away from her.</p>

<p>"Depart in peace, O Fenzileh," he said. "I yield her to
none&mdash;be his name Asad or Shaitan."</p>

<p>His tone was final, and her answer seemed to accept at last his
determination. Yet she was very quick with that answer; so quick
that he might have suspected it to be preconceived.</p>

<p>"Then it is surely thine intent to wed her." No voice could have
been more innocent and guileless than was hers now. "If so," she
went on, "it were best done quickly, for marriage is the only
barrier Asad will not overthrow. He is devout, and out of his deep
reverence for the Prophet's law he would be sure to respect such a
bond as that. But be very sure that he will respect nothing short
of it."</p>

<p>Yet notwithstanding her innocence and assumed
simplicity&mdash;because of it, perhaps&mdash;he read her as if she
had been an open book; it no longer mattered that her face was
veiled.</p>

<p>"And thy purpose would be equally well served, eh?" he
questioned her, sly in his turn.</p>

<p>"Equally," she admitted.</p>

<p>"Say 'better,' Fenzileh," he rejoined. "I said thou art not
subtle. By the Koran, I lied. Thou art subtle as the serpent. Yet I
see whither thou art gliding. Were I to be guided by thine advice a
twofold purpose would be served. First, I should place her beyond
Asad's reach, and second, I should be embroiled with him for having
done so. What could more completely satisfy thy wishes?"</p>

<p>"Thou dost me wrong," she protested. "I have ever been thy
friend. I would that..." She broke off suddenly to listen. The
stillness of the night was broken by cries from the direction of
the Bab-el-Oueb. She ran swiftly to the parapet whence the gate was
to be seen and leaned far out.</p>

<p>"Look, look!" she cried, and there was a tremor of fear in her
voice. "It is he&mdash;Asad-ed-Din."</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr crossed to her side and in a glare of torches saw a
body of men coming forth from the black archway of the gate.</p>

<p>"It almost seems as if, departing from thy usual custom, thou
hast spoken truth, O Fenzileh."</p>

<p>She faced him, and he suspected the venomous glance darted at
him through her veil. Yet her voice when she spoke was cold. "In a
moment thou'lt have no single doubt of it. But what of me?" The
question was added in a quickening tone. "He must not find me here.
He would kill me, I think."</p>

<p>"I am sure he would," Sakr-el-Bahr agreed. "Yet muffled thus,
who should recognize thee? Away, then, ere he comes. Take cover in
the courtyard until he shall have passed. Didst thou come
alone?"</p>

<p>"Should I trust anyone with the knowledge that I had visited
thee?" she asked, and he admired the strong Sicilian spirit in her
that not all these years in the Basha's hareem had sufficed to
extinguish.</p>

<p>She moved quickly to the door, to pause again on the
threshold.</p>

<p>"Thou'lt not relinquish her? Thou'lt not."</p>

<p>"Be at ease," he answered her, on so resolved a note that she
departed satisfied.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2-13" id="ch2-13"></a>CHAPTER XIII &mdash; IN THE
SIGHT OF ALLAH</h2>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr stood lost in thought after she had gone. Again he
weighed her every word and considered precisely how he should meet
Asad, and how refuse him, if the Basha's were indeed such an errand
as Fenzileh had heralded.</p>

<p>Thus in silence he remained waiting for Ali or another to summon
him to the presence of the Basha. Instead, however, when Ali
entered it was actually to announce Asad-ed-Din, who followed
immediately upon his heels, having insisted in his impatience upon
being conducted straight to the presence of Sakr-el-Bahr.</p>

<p>"The peace of the Prophet upon thee, my son," was the Basha's
greeting.</p>

<p>"And upon thee, my lord." Sakr-el-Bahr salaamed. "My house is
honoured." With a gesture he dismissed Ali.</p>

<p>"I come to thee a suppliant," said Asad, advancing.</p>

<p>"A suppliant, thou? No need, my lord. I have no will that is not
the echo of thine own."</p>

<p>The Basha's questing eyes went beyond him and glowed as they
rested upon Rosamund.</p>

<p>"I come in haste," he said, "like any callow lover, guided by my
every instinct to the presence of her I seek&mdash;this Frankish
pearl, this open-faced captive of thy latest raid. I was away from
the Kasbah when that pig Tsamanni returned thither from the sk;
but when at last I learnt that he had failed to purchase her as I
commanded, I could have wept for very grief. I feared at first that
some merchant from the Sus might have bought her and departed; but
when I heard&mdash;blessed be Allah!&mdash;that thou wert the
buyer, I was comforted again. For thou'lt yield her up to me, my
son."</p>

<p>He spoke with such confidence that Oliver had a difficulty in
choosing the words that were to disillusion him. Therefore he stood
in hesitancy a moment.</p>

<p>"I will make good thy loss," Asad ran on. "Thou shalt have the
sixteen hundred philips paid and another five hundred to console
thee. Say that will content thee; for I boil with impatience."</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr smiled grimly. "It is an impatience well known to
me, my lord, where she is concerned," he answered slowly. "I boiled
with it myself for five interminable years. To make an end of it I
went a distant perilous voyage to England in a captured Frankish
vessel. Thou didst not know, O Asad, else thou wouldst..."</p>

<p>"Bah!" broke in the Basha. "Thou'rt a huckster born. There is
none like thee, Sakr-el-Bahr, in any game of wits. Well, well, name
thine own price, strike thine own profit out of my impatience and
let us have done."</p>

<p>"My lord," he said quietly, "it is not the profit that is in
question. She is not for sale."</p>

<p>Asad blinked at him, speechless, and slowly a faint colour crept
into his sallow cheeks.</p>

<p>"Not...not for sale?" he echoed, faltering in his amazement.</p>

<p>"Not if thou offered me thy Bashalik as the price of her," was
the solemn answer. Then more warmly, in a voice that held a note of
intercession&mdash;"Ask anything else that is mine," he continued,
"and gladly will I lay it at thy feet in earnest of my loyalty and
love for thee."</p>

<p>"But I want nothing else." Asad's tone was impatient, petulant
almost. "I want this slave."</p>

<p>"Then," replied Oliver, "I cast myself upon thy mercy and
beseech thee to turn thine eyes elsewhere."</p>

<p>Asad scowled upon him. "Dost thou deny me?" he demanded,
throwing back his head.</p>

<p>"Alas!" said Sakr-el-Bahr.</p>

<p>There fell a pause. Darker and darker grew the countenance of
Asad, fiercer glowed the eyes he bent upon his lieutenant. "I see,"
he said at last, with a calm so oddly at variance with his looks as
to be sinister. "I see. It seems that there is more truth in
Fenzileh than I suspected. So!" He considered the corsair a moment
with his sunken smouldering eyes.</p>

<p>Then he addressed him in a tone that vibrated with his
suppressed anger. "Bethink thee, Sakr-el-Bahr, of what thou art, of
what I have made thee. Bethink thee of all the bounty these hands
have lavished on thee. Thou art my own lieutenant, and mayest one
day be more. In Algiers there is none above thee save myself. Art,
then, so thankless as to deny me the first thing I ask of thee?
Truly is it written 'Ungrateful is Man.'"</p>

<p>"Didst thou know," began Sakr-el-Bahr, "all that is involved for
me in this..."</p>

<p>"I neither know nor care," Asad cut in. "Whatever it may be, it
should be as naught when set against my will." Then he discarded
anger for cajolery. He set a hand upon Sakr-el-Bahr's stalwart
shoulder. "Come, my son. I will deal generously with thee out of my
love, and I will put thy refusal from my mind."</p>

<p>"Be generous, my lord, to the point of forgetting that ever thou
didst ask me for her."</p>

<p>"Dost still refuse?" The voice, honeyed an instant ago, rang
harsh again. "Take care how far thou strain my patience. Even as I
have raised thee from the dirt, so at a word can I cast thee down
again. Even as I broke the shackles that chained thee to the
rowers' bench, so can I rivet them on thee anew.</p>

<p>"All this canst thou do," Sakr-el-Bahr agreed. "And since,
knowing it, I still hold to what is doubly mine&mdash;by right of
capture and of purchase&mdash;thou mayest conceive how mighty are
my reasons. Be merciful, then, Asad..."</p>

<p>"Must I take her by force in spite of thee?" roared the
Basha.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr stiffened. He threw back his head and looked the
Basha squarely in the eyes.</p>

<p>"Whilst I live, not even that mayest thou do," he answered.</p>

<p>"Disloyal, mutinous dog! Wilt thou resist me&mdash;me?"</p>

<p>"It is my prayer that thou'lt not be so ungenerous and unjust as
to compel thy servant to a course so hateful."</p>

<p>Asad sneered. "Is that thy last word?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Save only that in all things else I am thy slave, O Asad."</p>

<p>A moment the Basha stood regarding him, his glance baleful. Then
deliberately, as one who has taken his resolve, he strode to the
door. On the threshold he paused and turned again. "Wait!" he said,
and on that threatening word departed.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr remained a moment where he had stood during the
interview, then with a shrug he turned. He met Rosamund's eyes
fixed intently upon him, and invested with a look he could not
read. He found himself unable to meet it, and he turned away. It
was inevitable that in such a moment the earlier stab of remorse
should be repeated. He had overreached himself indeed. Despair
settled down upon him, a full consciousness of the horrible thing
he had done, which seemed now so irrevocable. In his silent anguish
he almost conceived that he had mistaken his feelings for Rosamund;
that far from hating her as he had supposed, his love for her had
not yet been slain, else surely he should not be tortured now by
the thought of her becoming Asad's prey. If he hated her, indeed,
as he had supposed, he would have surrendered her and gloated.</p>

<p>He wondered was his present frame of mind purely the result of
his discovery that the appearances against him had been stronger
far than he imagined, so strong as to justify her conviction that
he was her brother's slayer.</p>

<p>And then her voice, crisp and steady, cut into his torture of
consideration.</p>

<p>"Why did you deny him?"</p>

<p>He swung round again to face her, amazed, horror-stricken.</p>

<p>"You understood?" he gasped.</p>

<p>"I understood enough," said she. "This lingua franca is none so
different from French." And again she asked&mdash;"Why did you deny
him?"</p>

<p>He paced across to her side and stood looking down at her.</p>

<p>"Do you ask why?"</p>

<p>"Indeed," she said bitterly, "there is scarce the need perhaps.
And yet can it be that your lust of vengeance is so insatiable that
sooner than willingly forgo an ounce of it you will lose your
head?"</p>

<p>His face became grim again. "Of course," he sneered, "it would
be so that you'd interpret me."</p>

<p>"Nay. If I have asked it is because I doubt."</p>

<p>"Do you realize what it can mean to become the prey of
Asad-ed-Din?"</p>

<p>She shuddered, and her glance fell from his, yet her voice was
composed when she answered him&mdash;"Is it so very much worse than
becoming the prey of Oliver-Reis or Sakr-el-Bahr, or whatever they
may call you?"</p>

<p>"If you say that it is all one to you there's an end to my
opposing him," he answered coldly. "You may go to him. If I
resisted him&mdash;like a fool, perhaps&mdash;it was for no sake of
vengeance upon you. It was because the thought of it fills me with
horror."</p>

<p>"Then it should fill you with horror of yourself no less," said
she.</p>

<p>His answer startled her.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it does," he said, scarcely above a murmur. "Perhaps it
does."</p>

<p>She flashed him an upward glance and looked as if she would have
spoken. But he went on, suddenly passionate, without giving her
time to interrupt him. "O God! It needed this to show me the
vileness of the thing I have done. Asad has no such motives as had
I. I wanted you that I might punish you. But he...O God!" he
groaned, and for a moment put his face to his hands.</p>

<p>She rose slowly, a strange agitation stirring in her, her bosom
galloping. But in his overwrought condition he failed to observe
it. And then like a ray of hope to illumine his despair came the
counsel that Fenzileh had given him, the barrier which she had said
that Asad, being a devout Muslim, would never dare to violate.</p>

<p>"There is a way," he cried. "There is the way suggested by
Fenzileh at the promptings of her malice." An instant he hesitated,
his eyes averted. Then he made his plunge. "You must marry me."</p>

<p>It was almost as if he had struck her. She recoiled. Instantly
suspicion awoke in her; swiftly it drew to a conviction that he had
but sought to trick her by a pretended penitence.</p>

<p>"Marry you!" she echoed.</p>

<p>"Ay," he insisted. And he set himself to explain to her how if
she were his wife she must be sacred and inviolable to all good
Muslimeen, that none could set a finger upon her without doing
outrage to the Prophet's holy law, and that, whoever might be so
disposed, Asad was not of those, since Asad was perfervidly devout.
"Thus only," he ended, "can I place you beyond his reach."</p>

<p>But she was still scornfully reluctant.</p>

<p>"It is too desperate a remedy even for so desperate an ill,"
said she, and thus drove him into a frenzy of impatience with
her.</p>

<p>"You must, I say," he insisted, almost angrily. "You
must&mdash;or else consent to be borne this very night to Asad's
hareem&mdash;and not even as his wife, but as his slave. Oh, you
must trust me for your own sake! You must!"</p>

<p>"Trust you!" she cried, and almost laughed in the intensity of
her scorn. "Trust you! How can I trust one who is a renegade and
worse?"</p>

<p>He controlled himself that he might reason with her, that by
cold logic he might conquer her consent.</p>

<p>"You are very unmerciful," he said. "In judging me you leave out
of all account the suffering through which I have gone and what
yourself contributed to it. Knowihg now how falsely I was accused
and what other bitter wrongs I suffered, consider that I was one to
whom the man and the woman I most loved in all this world had
proven false. I had lost faith in man and in God, and if I became a
Muslim, a renegade, and a corsair, it was because there was no
other gate by which I could escape the unutterable toil of the oar
to which I had been chained." He looked at her sadly. "Can you find
no excuse for me in all that?"</p>

<p>It moved her a little, for if she maintained a hostile attitude,
at least she put aside her scorn.</p>

<p>"No wrongs," she told him, almost with sorrow in her voice,
"could justify you in outraging chivalry, in dishonouring your
manhood, in abusing your strength to persecute a woman. Whatever
the causes that may have led to it, you have fallen too low, sir,
to make it possible that I should trust you."</p>

<p>He bowed his head under the rebuke which already he had uttered
in his own heart. It was just and most deserved, and since he
recognized its justice he found it impossible to resent it.</p>

<p>"I know," he said. "But I am not asking you to trust me to my
profit, but to your own. It is for your sake alone that I implore
you to do this." Upon a sudden inspiration he drew the heavy dagger
from his girdle and proffered it, hilt foremost. "If you need an
earnest of my good faith," he said, "take this knife with which
to-night you attempted to stab yourself. At the first sign that I
am false to my trust, use it as you will&mdash;upon me or upon
yourself."</p>

<p>She pondered him in some surprise. Then slowly she put out her
hand to take the weapon, as he bade her.</p>

<p>"Are you not afraid," she asked him, "that I shall use it now,
and so make an end?"</p>

<p>"I am trusting you," he said, "that in return you may trust me.
Further, I am arming you against the worst. For if it comes to
choice between death and Asad, I shall approve your choice of
death. But let me add that it were foolish to choose death whilst
yet there is a chance of life."</p>

<p>"What chance?" she asked, with a faint return of her old scorn.
"The chance of life with you?"</p>

<p>"No," he answered firmly. "If you will trust me, I swear that I
will seek to undo the evil I have done. Listen. At dawn my galeasse
sets out upon a raid. I will convey you secretly aboard and find a
way to land you in some Christian country&mdash;Italy or
France&mdash;whence you may make your way home again."</p>

<p>"But meanwhile," she reminded him, "I shall have become your
wife."</p>

<p>He smiled wistfully. "Do you still fear a trap? Can naught
convince you of my sincerity? A Muslim marriage is not binding upon
a Christian, and I shall account it no marriage. It will be no more
than a pretence to shelter you until we are away."</p>

<p>"How can I trust your word in that?"</p>

<p>"How?" He paused, baffled; but only for a moment. "You have the
dagger," he answered pregnantly.</p>

<p>She stood considering, her eyes upon the weapon's lividly
gleaming blade. "And this marriage?" she asked. "How is it to take
place?"</p>

<p>He explained to her then that by the Muslim law all that was
required was a declaration made before a kadi, or his superior, and
in the presence of witnesses. He was still at his explanation when
from below there came a sound of voices, the tramp of feet, and the
flash of torches.</p>

<p>"Here is Asad returning in force," he cried, and his voice
trembled. "Do you consent?"</p>

<p>"But the kadi?" she inquired, and by the question he knew that
she was won to his way of saving her.</p>

<p>"I said the kadi or his superior. Asad himself shall be our
priest, his followers our witnesses."</p>

<p>"And if he refuses? He will refuse!" she cried, clasping her
hands before her in her excitement.</p>

<p>"I shall not ask him. I shall take him by surprise."</p>

<p>"It...it must anger him. He may avenge himself for what he must
deem a trick."</p>

<p>"Ay," he answered, wild-eyed. "I have thought of that, too. But
it is a risk we must run. If we do not prevail, then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have the dagger," she cried fearlessly.</p>

<p>"And for me there will be the rope or the sword," he answered.
"Be calm! They come!"</p>

<p>But the steps that pattered up the stairs were Ali's. He flung
upon the terrace in alarm.</p>

<p>"My lord, my lord! Asad-ed-Din is here in force. He has an armed
following with him!"</p>

<p>"There is naught to fear," said Sakr-el-Bahr, with every show of
calm. "All will be well."</p>

<p>Asad swept up the stairs and out upon that terrace to confront
his rebellious lieutenant. After him came a dozen black-robed
janissaries with scimitars along which the light of the torches
rippled in little runnels as of blood.</p>

<p>The Basha came to a halt before Sakr-el-Bahr, his arms
majestically folded, his head thrown back, so that his long white
beard jutted forward.</p>

<p>"I am returned," he said, "to employ force where gentleness will
not avail. Yet I pray that Allah may have lighted thee to a wiser
frame of mind."</p>

<p>"He has, indeed, my lord," replied Sakr-el-Bahr.</p>

<p>"The praise to Him!" exclaimed Asad in a voice that rang with
joy. "The girl, then!" And he held out a hand.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr stepped back to her and took her hand in his as if
to lead her forward. Then he spoke the fateful words.</p>

<p>"In Allah's Holy Name and in His All-seeing eyes, before thee,
Asad-ed-Din, and in the presence of these witnesses, I take this
woman to be my wife by the merciful law of the Prophet of Allah the
All-wise, the All-pitying."</p>

<p>The words were out and the thing was done before Asad had
realized the corsair's intent. A gasp of dismay escaped him; then
his visage grew inflamed, his eyes blazed.</p>

<p>But Sakr-el-Bahr, cool and undaunted before that royal anger,
took the scarf that lay about Rosamund's shoulders, and raising it,
flung it over her head, so that her face was covered by it.</p>

<p>"May Allah rot off the hand of him who in contempt of our Lord
Mahomet's holy law may dare to unveil that face, and may Allah
bless this union and cast into the pit of Gehenna any who shall
attempt to dissolve a bond that is tied in His All-seeing
eyes."</p>

<p>It was formidable. Too formidable for Asad-ed-Din. Behind him
his janissaries like hounds in leash stood eagerly awaiting his
command. But none came. He stood there breathing heavily, swaying a
little, and turning from red to pale in the battle that was being
fought within him between rage and vexation on the one hand and his
profound piety on the other. And as he yet hesitated perhaps
Sakr-el-Bahr assisted his piety to gain the day.</p>

<p>"Now you will understand why I would not yield her, O mighty
Asad," he said. "Thyself hast thou oft and rightly reproached me
with my celibacy, reminding me that it is not pleasing in the sight
of Allah, that it is unworthy a good Muslim. At last it hath
pleased the Prophet to send me such a maid as I could take to
wife."</p>

<p>Asad bowed his head. "What is written is written," he said in
the voice of one who admonished himself. Then he raised his arms
aloft. "Allah is All-knowing," he declared. "His will be done!"</p>

<p>"Ameen," said Sakr-el-Bahr very solemnly and with a great surge
of thankful prayer to his own long-forgotten God.</p>

<p>The Basha stayed yet a moment, as if he would have spoken. Then
abruptly he turned and waved a hand to his janissaries. "Away!" was
all he said to them, and stalked out in their wake.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2-14" id="ch2-14"></a>CHAPTER XIV &mdash; THE
SIGN</h2>

<p>From behind her lattice, still breathless from the haste she had
made, and with her whelp Marzak at her side, Fenzileh had witnessed
that first angry return of the Basha from the house of
Sakr-el-Bahr.</p>

<p>She had heard him bawling for Abdul Mohktar, the leader of his
janissaries, and she had seen the hasty mustering of a score of
these soldiers in the courtyard, where the ruddy light of torches
mingled with the white light of the full moon. She had seen them go
hurrying away with Asad himself at their head, and she had not
known whether to weep or to laugh, whether to fear or to
rejoice.</p>

<p>"It is done," Marzak had cried exultantly. "The dog hath
withstood him and so destroyed himself. There will be an end to
Sakr-el-Bahr this night." And he had added: "The praise to
Allah!"</p>

<p>But from Fenzileh came no response to his prayer of
thanksgiving. True, Sakr-el-Bahr must be destroyed, and by a sword
that she herself had forged. Yet was it not inevitable that the
stroke which laid him low must wound her on its repercussion? That
was the question to which now she sought an answer. For all her
eagerness to speed the corsair to his doom, she had paused
sufficiently to weigh the consequences to herself; she had not
overlooked the circumstance that an inevitable result of this must
be Asad's appropriation of that Frankish slave-girl. But at the
time it had seemed to her that even this price was worth paying to
remove Sakr-el-Bahr definitely and finally from her son's
path&mdash;which shows that, after all, Fenzileh the mother was
capable of some self-sacrifice. She comforted herself now with the
reflection that the influence, whose waning she feared might be
occasioned by the introduction of a rival into Asad's hareem, would
no longer be so vitally necessary to herself and Marzak once
Sakr-el-Bahr were removed. The rest mattered none so much to her.
Yet it mattered something, and the present state of things left her
uneasy, her mind a cockpit of emotions. Her grasp could not
encompass all her desires at once, it seemed; and whilst she could
gloat over the gratification of one, she must bewail the
frustration of another. Yet in the main she felt that she should
account herself the gainer.</p>

<p>In this state of mind she had waited, scarce heeding the
savagely joyous and entirely selfish babblings of her cub, who
cared little what might betide his mother as the price of the
removal of that hated rival from his path. For him, at least, there
was nothing but profit in the business, no cause for anything but
satisfaction; and that satisfaction he voiced with a fine contempt
for his mother's feelings.</p>

<p>Anon they witnessed Asad's return. They saw the janissaries come
swinging into the courtyard and range themselves there whilst the
Basha made his appearance, walking slowly, with steps that dragged
a little, his head sunk upon his breast, his hands behind him. They
waited to see slaves following him, leading or carrying the girl he
had gone to fetch. But they waited in vain, intrigued and
uneasy.</p>

<p>They heard the harsh voice in which Asad dismissed his
followers, and the clang of the closing gate; and they saw him
pacing there alone in the moonlight, ever in that attitude of
dejection.</p>

<p>What had happened? Had he killed them both? Had the girl
resisted him to such an extent that he had lost all patience and in
one of those rages begotten of such resistance made an end of
her?</p>

<p>Thus did Fenzileh question herself, and since she could not
doubt but that Sakr-el-Bahr was slain, she concluded that the rest
must be as she conjectured. Yet, the suspense torturing her, she
summoned Ayoub and sent him to glean from Abdul Mohktar the tale of
what had passed. In his own hatred of Sakr-el-Bahr, Ayoub went
willingly enough and hoping for the worst. He returned
disappointed, with a tale that sowed dismay in Fenzileh and
Marzak.</p>

<p>Fenzileh, however, made a swift recovery. After all, it was the
best that could have happened. It should not be difficult to
transmute that obvious dejection of Asad's into resentment, and to
fan this into a rage that must end by consuming Sakr-el-Bahr. And
so the thing could be accomplished without jeopardy to her own
place at Asad's side. For it was inconceivable that he should now
take Rosamund to his hareem. Already the fact that she had been
paraded with naked face among the Faithful must in itself have been
a difficult obstacle to his pride. But it was utterly impossible
that he could so subject his self-respect to his desire as to take
to himself a woman who had been the wife of his servant.</p>

<p>Fenzileh saw her way very clearly. It was through Asad's
devoutness&mdash;as she herself had advised, though scarcely
expecting such rich results as these&mdash;that he had been
thwarted by Sakr-el-Bahr. That same devoutness must further be
played upon now to do the rest.</p>

<p>Taking up a flimsy silken veil, she went out to him where he now
sat on the divan under the awning, alone there in the tepid-scented
summer night. She crept to his side with the soft, graceful,
questing movements of a cat, and sat there a moment unheeded
almost&mdash;such was his abstraction&mdash;her head resting
lightly against his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Lord of my soul," she murmured presently, "thou art sorrowing."
Her voice was in itself a soft and soothing caress.</p>

<p>He started, and she caught the gleam of his eyes turned suddenly
upon her.</p>

<p>"Who told thee so?" he asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>"My heart," she answered, her voice melodious as a viol. "Can
sorrow burden thine and mine go light?" she wooed him. "Is
happiness possible to me when thou art downcast? In there I felt
thy melancholy, and thy need of me, and I am come to share thy
burden, or to bear it all for thee." Her arms were raised, and her
fingers interlocked themselves upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>He looked down at her, and his expression softened. He needed
comfort, and never was she more welcome to him.</p>

<p>Gradually and with infinite skill she drew from him the story of
what had happened. When she had gathered it, she loosed her
indignation.</p>

<p>"The dog!" she cried. "The faithless, ungrateful hound! Yet have
I warned thee against him, O light of my poor eyes, and thou hast
scorned me for the warnings uttered by my love. Now at last thou
knowest him, and he shall trouble thee no longer. Thou'lt cast him
off, reduce him again to the dust from which thy bounty raised
him."</p>

<p>But Asad did not respond. He sat there in a gloomy abstraction,
staring straight before him. At last he sighed wearily. He was
just, and he had a conscience, as odd a thing as it was awkward in
a corsair Basha.</p>

<p>"In what hath befallen," he answered moodily, "there is naught
to justify me in casting aside the stoutest soldier of Islam. My
duty to Allah will not suffer it."</p>

<p>"Yet his duty to thee suffered him to thwart thee, O my lord,"
she reminded him very softly.</p>

<p>"In my desires&mdash;ay!" he answered, and for a moment his
voice quivered with passion. Then he repressed it, and continued
more calmly&mdash;"Shall my self-seeking overwhelm my duty to the
Faith? Shall the matter of a slave-girl urge me to sacrifice the
bravest soldier of Islam, the stoutest champion of the Prophet's
law? Shall I bring down upon my head the vengeance of the One by
destroying a man who is a scourge of scorpions unto the
infidel&mdash;and all this that I may gratify my personal anger
against him, that I may avenge the thwarting of a petty
desire?"</p>

<p>"Dost thou still say, O my life, that Sakr-el-Bahr is the
stoutest champion of the Prophet's law?" she asked him softly, yet
on a note of amazement.</p>

<p>"It is not I that say it, but his deeds," he answered
sullenly.</p>

<p>"I know of one deed no True-Believer could have wrought. If
proof were needed of his infidelity he hath now afforded it in
taking to himself a Nasrani wife. Is it not written in the Book to
be Read: 'Marry not idolatresses'? Is not that the Prophet's law,
and hath he not broken it, offending at once against Allah and
against thee, O fountain of my soul?"</p>

<p>Asad frowned. Here was truth indeed, something that he had
entirely overlooked. Yet justice compelled him still to defend
Sakr-el-Bahr, or else perhaps he but reasoned to prove to himself
that the case against the corsair was indeed complete.</p>

<p>"He may have sinned in thoughtlessness," he suggested.</p>

<p>At that she cried out in admiration of him. "What a fount of
mercy and forbearance art thou, O father of Marzak! Thou'rt right
as in all things. It was no doubt in thoughtlessness that he
offended, but would such thoughtlessness be possible in a
True-Believer&mdash;in one worthy to be dubbed by thee the champion
of the Prophet's Holy Law?"</p>

<p>It was a shrewd thrust, that pierced the armour of conscience in
which he sought to empanoply himself. He sat very thoughtful,
scowling darkly at the inky shadow of the wall which the moon was
casting. Suddenly he rose.</p>

<p>"By Allah, thou art right!" he cried. "So that he thwarted me
and kept that Frankish woman for himself, he cared not how he
sinned against the law."</p>

<p>She glided to her knees and coiled her arms about his waist,
looking up at him. "Still art thou ever merciful, ever sparing in
adverse judgment. Is that all his fault, O Asad?"</p>

<p>"All?" he questioned, looking down at her. "What more is
there?"</p>

<p>"I would there were no more. Yet more there is, to which thy
angelic mercy blinds thee. He did worse. Not merely was he reckless
of how he sinned against the law, he turned the law to his own base
uses and so defiled it."</p>

<p>"How?" he asked quickly, eagerly almost.</p>

<p>"He employed it as a bulwark behind which to shelter himself and
her. Knowing that thou who art the Lion and defender of the Faith
wouldst bend obediently to what is written in the Book, he married
her to place her beyond thy reach."</p>

<p>"The praise to Him who is All-wise and lent me strength to do
naught unworthy!" he cried in a great voice, glorifying himself. "I
might have slain him to dissolve the impious bond, yet I obeyed
what is written."</p>

<p>"Thy forbearance hath given joy to the angels," she answered
him, "and yet a man was found so base as to trade upon it and upon
thy piety, O Asad!"</p>

<p>He shook off her clasp, and strode away from her a prey to
agitation. He paced to and fro in the moonlight there, and she,
well-content, reclined upon the cushions of the divan, a thing of
infinite grace, her gleaming eyes discreetly veiled from
him&mdash;waiting until her poison should have done its work.</p>

<p>She saw him halt, and fling up his arms, as if apostrophizing
Heaven, as if asking a question of the stars that twinkled in the
wide-flung nimbus of the moon.</p>

<p>Then at last he paced slowly back to her. He was still
undecided. There was truth in what she had said; yet he knew and
weighed her hatred of Sakr-el-Bahr, knew how it must urge her to
put the worst construction upon any act of his, knew her jealousy
for Marzak, and so he mistrusted her arguments and mistrusted
himself. Also there was his own love of Sakr-el-Bahr that would
insist upon a place in the balance of his judgment. His mind was in
turmoil.</p>

<p>"Enough," he said almost roughly. "I pray that Allah may send me
counsel in the night." And upon that he stalked past her, up the
steps, and so into the house.</p>

<p>She followed him. All night she lay at his feet to be ready at
the first peep of dawn to buttress a purpose that she feared was
still weak, and whilst he slept fitfully, she slept not at all, but
lay wide-eyed and watchful.</p>

<p>At the first note of the mueddin's voice, he leapt from his
couch obedient to its summons, and scarce had the last note of it
died upon the winds of dawn than he was afoot, beating his hands
together to summon slaves and issuing his orders, from which she
gathered that he was for the harbour there and then.</p>

<p>"May Allah have inspired thee, O my lord!" she cried. And asked
him: "What is thy resolve?"</p>

<p>"I go to seek a sign," he answered her, and upon that departed,
leaving her in a frame of mind that was far from easy.</p>

<p>She summoned Marzak, and bade him accompany his father, breathed
swift instructions of what he should do and how do it.</p>

<p>"Thy fate has been placed in thine own hands," she admonished
him. "See that thou grip it firmly now."</p>

<p>In the courtyard Marzak found his father in the act of mounting
a white mule that had been brought him.</p>

<p>He was attended by his wazeer Tsamanni, Biskaine, and some other
of his captains. Marzak begged leave to go with him. It was
carelessly granted, and they set out, Marzak walking by his
father's stirrup, a little in advance of the others. For a while
there was silence between father and son, then the latter
spoke.</p>

<p>"It is my prayer, O my father, that thou art resolved to depose
the faithless Sakr-el-Bahr from the command of this
expedition."</p>

<p>Asad considered his son with a sombre eye. "Even now the
galeasse should be setting out if the argosy is to be intercepted,"
he said. "If Sakr-el-Bahr does not command, who shall, in Heaven's
name?"</p>

<p>"Try me, O my father," cried Marzak.</p>

<p>Asad smiled with grim wistfulness. "Art weary of life, O my son,
that thou wouldst go to thy death and take the galeasse to
destruction?"</p>

<p>"Thou art less than just, O my father," Marzak protested.</p>

<p>"Yet more than kind, O my son," replied Asad, and they went on
in silence thereafter, until they came to the mole.</p>

<p>The splendid galeasse was moored alongside, and all about her
there was great bustle of preparation for departure. Porters moved
up and down the gangway that connected her with the shore, carrying
bales of provisions, barrels of water, kegs of gunpowder, and other
necessaries for the voyage, and even as Asad and his followers
reached the head of that gangway, four negroes were staggering down
it under the load of a huge palmetto bale that was slung from
staves yoked to their shoulders.</p>

<p>On the poop stood Sakr-el-Bahr with Othmani, Ali, Jasper-Reis,
and some other officers. Up and down the gangway paced Larocque and
Vigitello, two renegade boatswains, one French and the other
Italian, who had sailed with him on every voyage for the past two
years. Larocque was superintending the loading of the vessel,
bawling his orders for the bestowal of provisions here, of water
yonder, and of powder about the mainmast. Vigitello was making a
final inspection of the slaves at the oars.</p>

<p>As the palmetto pannier was brought aboard, Larocque shouted to
the negroes to set it down by the mainmast. But here Sakr-el-Bahr
interfered, bidding them, instead, to bring it up to the stern and
place it in the poop-house.</p>

<p>Asad had dismounted, and stood with Marzak at his side at the
head of the gangway when the youth finally begged his father
himself to take command of this expedition, allowing him to come as
his lieutenant and so learn the ways of the sea.</p>

<p>Asad looked at him curiously, but answered nothing. He went
aboard, Marzak and the others following him. It was at this moment
that Sakr-el-Bahr first became aware of the Basha's presence, and
he came instantly forward to do the honours of his galley. If there
was a sudden uneasiness in his heart his face was calm and his
glance as arrogant and steady as ever.</p>

<p>"May the peace of Allah overshadow thee and thy house, O mighty
Asad," was his greeting. "We are on the point of casting off, and I
shall sail the more securely for thy blessing."</p>

<p>Asad considered him with eyes of wonder. So much effrontery, so
much ease after their last scene together seemed to the Basha a
thing incredible, unless, indeed, it were accompanied by a
conscience entirely at peace.</p>

<p>"It has been proposed to me that I shall do more than bless this
expedition&mdash;that I shall command it," he answered, watching
Sakr-el-Bahr closely. He observed the sudden flicker of the
corsair's eyes, the only outward sign of his inward dismay.</p>

<p>"Command it?" echoed Sakr-el-Bahr. "'Twas proposed to thee?" And
he laughed lightly as if to dismiss that suggestion.</p>

<p>That laugh was a tactical error. It spurred Asad. He advanced
slowly along the vessel's waist-deck to the mainmast&mdash;for she
was rigged with main and foremasts. There he halted again to look
into the face of Sakr-el-Bahr who stepped along beside him.</p>

<p>"Why didst thou laugh?" he questioned shortly.</p>

<p>"Why? At the folly of such a proposal," said Sakr-el-Bahr in
haste, too much in haste to seek a diplomatic answer.</p>

<p>Darker grew the Basha's frown. "Folly?" quoth he. "Wherein lies
the folly?"</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr made haste to cover his mistake. "In the suggestion
that such poor quarry as waits us should be worthy thine endeavour,
should warrant the Lion of the Faith to unsheathe his mighty claws.
Thou," he continued with ringing scorn, "thou the inspirer of a
hundred glorious fights in which whole fleets have been engaged, to
take the seas upon so trivial an errand&mdash;one galeasse to swoop
upon a single galley of Spain! It were unworthy thy great name,
beneath the dignity of thy valour!" and by a gesture he
contemptuously dismissed the subject.</p>

<p>But Asad continued to ponder him with cold eyes, his face
inscrutable. "Why, here's a change since yesterday!" he said.</p>

<p>"A change, my lord?"</p>

<p>"But yesterday in the market-place thyself didst urge me to join
this expedition and to command it," Asad reminded him, speaking
with deliberate emphasis. "Thyself invoked the memory of the days
that are gone, when, scimitar in hand, we charged side by side
aboard the infidel, and thou didst beseech me to engage again
beside thee. And now..." He spread his hands, anger gathered in his
eyes. "Whence this change?" he demanded sternly.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr hesitated, caught in his own toils. He looked away
from Asad a moment; he had a glimpse of the handsome flushed face
of Marzak at his father's elbow, of Biskaine, Tsamanni, and the
others all staring at him in amazement, and even of some grimy
sunburned faces from the rowers' bench on his left that were
looking on with dull curiosity.</p>

<p>He smiled, seeming outwardly to remain entirely unruffled.
"Why...it is that I have come to perceive thy reasons for refusing.
For the rest, it is as I say, the quarry is not worthy of the
hunter."</p>

<p>Marzak uttered a soft sneering laugh, as if the true reason of
the corsair's attitude were quite clear to him. He fancied too, and
he was right in this, that Sakr-el-Bahr's odd attitude had
accomplished what persuasions addressed to Asad-ed-Din might to the
end have failed to accomplish&mdash;had afforded him the sign he
was come to seek. For it was in that moment that Asad determined to
take command himself.</p>

<p>"It almost seems," he said slowly, smiling, "as if thou didst
not want me. If so, it is unfortunate; for I have long neglected my
duty to my son, and I am resolved at last to repair that error. We
accompany thee upon this expedition, Sakr-el-Bahr. Myself I will
command it, and Marzak shall be my apprentice in the ways of the
sea.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr said not another word in protest against that
proclaimed resolve. He salaamed, and when he spoke there was almost
a note of gladness in his voice.</p>

<p>"The praise to Allah, then, since thou'rt determined. It is not
for me to urge further the unworthiness of the quarry since I am
the gainer by thy resolve."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2-15" id="ch2-15"></a>CHAPTER XV &mdash; THE
VOYAGE</h2>

<p>His resolve being taken, Asad drew Tsamanni aside and spent some
moments in talk with him, giving him certain instructions for the
conduct of affairs ashore during his absence. That done, and the
wazeer dismissed, the Basha himself gave the order to cast off, an
order which there was no reason to delay, since all was now in
readiness.</p>

<p>The gangway was drawn ashore, the boatswains whistle sounded,
and the steersmen leapt to their niches in the stern, grasping the
shafts of the great steering-oars. A second blast rang out, and
down the gangway-deck came Vigitello and two of his mates, all
three armed with long whips of bullock-hide, shouting to the slaves
to make ready. And then, on the note of a third blast of Larocque's
whistle, the fifty-four poised oars dipped to the water, two
hundred and fifty bodies bent as one, and when they heaved
themselves upright again the great galeasse shot forward and so set
out upon her adventurous voyage. From her mainmast the red flag
with its green crescent was unfurled to the breeze, and from the
crowded mole, and the beach where a long line of spectators had
gathered, there burst a great cry of valediction.</p>

<p>That breeze blowing stiffly from the desert was Lionel's friend
that day. Without it his career at the oar might have been short
indeed. He was chained, like the rest, stark naked, save for a
loincloth, in the place nearest the gangway on the first starboard
bench abaft the narrow waist-deck, and ere the galeasse had made
the short distance between the mole and the island at the end of
it, the boatswain's whip had coiled itself about his white
shoulders to urge him to better exertion than he was putting forth.
He had screamed under the cruel cut, but none had heeded him. Lest
the punishment should be repeated, he had thrown all his weight
into the next strokes of the oar, until by the time the Peon was
reached the sweat was running down his body and his heart was
thudding against his ribs. It was not possible that it could have
lasted, and his main agony lay in that he realized it, and saw
himself face to face with horrors inconceivable that must await the
exhaustion of his strength. He was not naturally robust, and he had
led a soft and pampered life that was very far from equipping him
for such a test as this.</p>

<p>But as they reached the Peon and felt the full vigour of that
warm breeze, Sakr-el-Bahr, who by Asad's command remained in charge
of the navigation, ordered the unfurling of the enormous lateen
sails on main and foremasts. They ballooned out, swelling to the
wind, and the galeasse surged forward at a speed that was more than
doubled. The order to cease rowing followed, and the slaves were
left to return thanks to Heaven for their respite, and to rest in
their chains until such time as their sinews should be required
again.</p>

<p>The vessel's vast prow, which ended in a steel ram and was armed
with a culverin on either quarter, was crowded with lounging
corsairs, who took their ease there until the time to engage should
be upon them. They leaned on the high bulwarks or squatted in
groups, talking, laughing, some of them tailoring and repairing
garments, others burnishing their weapons or their armour, and one
swarthy youth there was who thrummed a gimri and sang a melancholy
Shilha love-song to the delight of a score or so of bloodthirsty
ruffians squatting about him in a ring of variegated colour.</p>

<p>The gorgeous poop was fitted with a spacious cabin, to which
admission was gained by two archways curtained with stout silken
tapestries upon whose deep red ground the crescent was wrought in
brilliant green. Above the cabin stood the three cressets or
stern-lamps, great structures of gilded iron surmounted each by the
orb and crescent. As if to continue the cabin forward and increase
its size, a green awning was erected from it to shade almost half
the poop-deck. Here cushions were thrown, and upon these squatted
now Asad-ed-Din with Marzak, whilst Biskaine and some three or four
other officers who had escorted him aboard and whom he had retained
beside him for that voyage, were lounging upon the gilded
balustrade at the poop's forward end, immediately above the rowers'
benches.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr alone, a solitary figure, resplendent in caftan and
turban that were of cloth of silver, leaned upon the bulwarks of
the larboard quarter of the poop-deck, and looked moodily back upon
the receding city of Algiers which by now was no more than an
agglomeration of white cubes piled up the hillside in the morning
sunshine.</p>

<p>Asad watched him silently awhile from under his beetling brows,
then summoned him. He came at once, and stood respectfully before
his prince.</p>

<p>Asad considered him a moment solemnly, whilst a furtive
malicious smile played over the beautiful countenance of his
son.</p>

<p>"Think not, Sakr-el-Bahr," he said at length, "that I bear thee
resentment for what befell last night or that that happening is the
sole cause of my present determination. I had a duty&mdash;a
long-neglected duty&mdash;to Marzak, which at last I have
undertaken to perform." He seemed to excuse himself almost, and
Marzak misliked both words and tone. Why, he wondered, must this
fierce old man, who had made his name a terror throughout
Christendom, be ever so soft and yielding where that stalwart and
arrogant infidel was concerned?</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr bowed solemnly. "My lord," he said, "it is not for
me to question thy resolves or the thoughts that may have led to
them. It suffices me to know thy wishes; they are my law."</p>

<p>"Are they so?" said Asad tartly. "Thy deeds will scarce bear out
thy protestations." He sighed. "Sorely was I wounded yesternight
when thy marriage thwarted me and placed that Frankish maid beyond
my reach. Yet I respect this marriage of thine, as all Muslims
must&mdash;for all that in itself it was unlawful. But there!" he
ended with a shrug. "We sail together once again to crush the
Spaniard. Let no ill-will on either side o'er-cloud the splendour
of our task."</p>

<p>"Ameen to that, my lord," said Sakr-el-Bahr devoutly. "I almost
feared..."</p>

<p>"No more!" the Basha interrupted him. "Thou wert never a man to
fear anything, which is why I have loved thee as a son."</p>

<p>But it suited Marzak not at all that the matter should be thus
dismissed, that it should conclude upon a note of weakening from
his father, upon what indeed amounted to a speech of
reconciliation. Before Sakr-el-Bahr could make answer he had cut in
to set him a question laden with wicked intent.</p>

<p>"How will thy bride beguile the season of thine absence, O
Sakr-el-Bahr?"</p>

<p>"I have lived too little with women to be able to give thee an
answer," said the corsair.</p>

<p>Marzak winced before a reply that seemed to reflect upon
himself. But he returned to the attack.</p>

<p>"I compassionate thee that art the slave of duty, driven so soon
to abandon the delight of her soft arms. Where hast thou bestowed
her, O captain?"</p>

<p>"Where should a Muslim bestow his wife but according to the
biddings of the Prophet&mdash;in the house?"</p>

<p>Marzak sneered. "Verily, I marvel at thy fortitude in quitting
her so soon!"</p>

<p>But Asad caught the sneer, and stared at his son. "What cause is
there to marvel in that a true Muslim should sacrifice his
inclinations to the service of the Faith?" His tone was a rebuke;
but it left Marzak undismayed. The youth sprawled gracefully upon
his cushions, one leg tucked under him.</p>

<p>"Place no excess of faith in appearances, O my father!" he
said.</p>

<p>"No more!" growled the Basha. "Peace to thy tongue, Marzak, and
may Allah the All-knowing smile upon our expedition, lending
strength to our arms to smite the infidel to whom the fragrance of
the garden is forbidden."</p>

<p>To this again Sakr-el-Bahr replied "Ameen," but an uneasiness
abode in his heart summoned thither by the questions Marzak had set
him. Were they idle words calculated to do no more than plague him,
and to keep fresh in Asad's mind the memory of Rosamund, or were
they based upon some actual knowledge?</p>

<p>His fears were to be quickened soon on that same score. He was
leaning that afternoon upon the rail, idly observing the doling out
of the rations to the slaves, when Marzak came to join him.</p>

<p>For some moments he stood silently beside Sakr-el-Bahr watching
Vigitello and his men as they passed from bench to bench serving
out biscuits and dried dates to the rowers&mdash;but sparingly, for
oars move sluggishly when stomachs are too well nourished&mdash;and
giving each to drink a cup of vinegar and water in which floated a
few drops of added oil.</p>

<p>Then he pointed to a large palmetto bale that stood on the
waist-deck near the mainmast about which the powder barrels were
stacked.</p>

<p>"That pannier," he said, "seems to me oddly in the way yonder.
Were it not better to bestow it in the hold, where it will cease to
be an encumbrance in case of action?"</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr experienced a slight tightening at the heart. He
knew that Marzak had heard him command that bale to be borne into
the poop-cabin, and that anon he had ordered it to be fetched
thence when Asad had announced his intention of sailing with him.
He realized that this in itself might be a suspicious circumstance;
or, rather, knowing what the bale contained, he was too ready to
fear suspicion. Nevertheless he turned to Marzak with a smile of
some disdain.</p>

<p>"I understood, Marzak, that thou art sailing with us as
apprentice."</p>

<p>"What then?" quoth Marzak.</p>

<p>"Why merely that it might become thee better to be content to
observe and learn. Thou'lt soon be telling me how grapnels should
be slung, and how an action should be fought." Then he pointed
ahead to what seemed to be no more than a low cloud-bank towards
which they were rapidly skimming before that friendly wind.
"Yonder," he said, "are the Balearics. We are making good
speed."</p>

<p>Although he said it without any object other than that of
turning the conversation, yet the fact itself was sufficiently
remarkable to be worth a comment. Whether rowed by her two hundred
and fifty slaves, or sailed under her enormous spread of canvas,
there was no swifter vessel upon the Mediterranean than the
galeasse of Sakr-el-Bahr. Onward she leapt now with bellying
lateens, her well-greased keel slipping through the wind-whipped
water at a rate which perhaps could not have been bettered by any
ship that sailed.</p>

<p>"If this wind holds we shall be under the Point of Aguila before
sunset, which will be something to boast of hereafter," he
promised.</p>

<p>Marzak, however, seemed but indifferently interested; his eyes
continued awhile to stray towards that palmetto bale by the
mainmast. At length, without another word to Sakr-el-Bahr, he made
his way abaft, and flung himself down under the awning, beside his
father. Asad sat there in a moody abstraction, already regretting
that he should have lent an ear to Fenzileh to the extent of coming
upon this voyage, and assured by now that at least there was no
cause to mistrust Sakr-el-Bahr. Marzak came to revive that drooping
mistrust. But the moment was ill-chosen, and at the first words he
uttered on the subject, he was growled into silence by his
sire.</p>

<p>"Thou dost but voice thine own malice," Asad rebuked him. "And I
am proven a fool in that I have permitted the malice of others to
urge me in this matter. No more, I say."</p>

<p>Thereupon Marzak fell silent and sulking, his eyes ever
following Sakr-el-Bahr, who had descended the three steps from the
poop to the gangway and was pacing slowly down between the rowers'
benches.</p>

<p>The corsair was supremely ill at ease, as a man must be who has
something to conceal, and who begins to fear that he may have been
betrayed. Yet who was there could have betrayed him? But three men
aboard that vessel knew his secret&mdash;Ali, his lieutenant,
Jasper, and the Italian Vigitello. And Sakr-el-Bahr would have
staked all his possessions that neither Ali nor Vigitello would
have betrayed him, whilst he was fairly confident that in his own
interests Jasper also must have kept faith. Yet Marzak's allusion
to that palmetto bale had filled him with an uneasiness that sent
him now in quest of his Italian boatswain whom he trusted above all
others.</p>

<p>"Vigitello," said he, "is it possible that I have been betrayed
to the Basha?"</p>

<p>Vigitello looked up sharply at the question, then smiled with
confidence. They were standing alone by the bulwarks on the
waist-deck.</p>

<p>"Touching what we carry yonder?" quoth he, his glance shifting
to the bale. "Impossible. If Asad had knowledge he would have
betrayed it before we left Algiers, or else he would never have
sailed without a stouter bodyguard of his own.</p>

<p>"What need of bodyguard for him?" returned Sakr-el-Bahr. "If it
should come to grips between us&mdash;as well it may if what I
suspect be true&mdash;there is no doubt as to the side upon which
the corsairs would range themselves."</p>

<p>"Is there not?" quoth Vigitello, a smile upon his swarthy face.
"Be not so sure. These men have most of them followed thee into a
score of fights. To them thou art the Basha, their natural
leader."</p>

<p>"Maybe. But their allegiance belongs to Asad-ed-Din, the exalted
of Allah. Did it come to a choice between us, their faith would
urge them to stand beside him in spite of any past bonds that may
have existed between them and me."</p>

<p>"Yet there were some who murmured when thou wert superseded in
the command of this expedition," Vigitello informed him. "I doubt
not that many would be influenced by their faith, but many would
stand by thee against the Grand Sultan himself. And do not forget,"
he added, instinctively lowering his voice, "that many of us are
renegadoes like myself and thee, who would never know a moment's
doubt if it came to a choice of sides. But I hope," he ended in
another tone, "there is no such danger here."</p>

<p>"And so do I, in all faith," replied Sakr-el-Bahr, with fervour.
"Yet I am uneasy, and I must know where I stand if the worst takes
place. Go thou amongst the men, Vigitello, and probe their real
feelings, gauge their humour and endeavour to ascertain upon what
numbers I may count if I have to declare war upon Asad or if he
declares it upon me. Be cautious."</p>

<p>Vigitello closed one of his black eyes portentously. "Depend
upon it," he said, "I'll bring you word anon."</p>

<p>On that they parted, Vigitello to make his way to the prow and
there engage in his investigations, Sakr-el-Bahr slowly to retrace
his steps to the poop. But at the first bench abaft the gangway he
paused, and looked down at the dejected, white-fleshed slave who
sat shackled there. He smiled cruelly, his own anxieties forgotten
in the savour of vengeance.</p>

<p>"So you have tasted the whip already," he said in English. "But
that is nothing to what is yet to come. You are in luck that there
is a wind to-day. It will not always be so. Soon shall you learn
what it was that I endured by your contriving."</p>

<p>Lionel looked up at him with haggard, blood-injected eyes. He
wanted to curse his brother, yet was he too overwhelmed by the
sense of the fitness of this punishment.</p>

<p>"For myself I care nothing," he replied.</p>

<p>"But you will, sweet brother," was the answer. "You will care
for yourself most damnably and pity yourself most poignantly. I
speak from experience. 'Tis odds you will not live, and that is my
chief regret. I would you had my thews to keep you alive in this
floating hell."</p>

<p>"I tell you I care nothing for myself," Lionel insisted. "What
have you done with Rosamund?"</p>

<p>"Will it surprise you to learn that I have played the gentleman
and married her?" Oliver mocked him.</p>

<p>"Married her?" his brother gasped, blenching at the very
thought. "You hound!"</p>

<p>"Why abuse me? Could I have done more?" And with a laugh he
sauntered on, leaving Lionel to writhe there with the torment of
his half-knowledge.</p>

<p>An hour later, when the cloudy outline of the Balearic Isles had
acquired density and colour, Sakr-el-Bahr and Vigitello met again
on the waist-deck, and they exchanged some few words in
passing.</p>

<p>"It is difficult to say exactly," the boatswain murmured, "but
from what I gather I think the odds would be very evenly balanced,
and it were rash in thee to precipitate a quarrel."</p>

<p>"I am not like to do so," replied Sakr-el-Bahr. "I should not be
like to do so in any case. I but desired to know how I stand in
case a quarrel should be forced upon me." And he passed on.</p>

<p>Yet his uneasiness was no whit allayed; his difficulties were
very far from solved. He had undertaken to carry Rosamund to France
or Italy; he had pledged her his word to land her upon one or the
other shore, and should he fail, she might even come to conclude
that such had never been his real intention. Yet how was he to
succeed, now, since Asad was aboard the galeasse? Must he be
constrained to carry her back to Algiers as secretly as he had
brought her thence, and to keep her there until another opportunity
of setting her ashore upon a Christian country should present
itself? That was clearly impracticable and fraught with too much
risk of detection. Indeed, the risk of detection was very imminent
now. At any moment her presence in that pannier might be betrayed.
He could think of no way in which to redeem his pledged word. He
could but wait and hope, trusting to his luck and to some
opportunity which it was impossible to foresee.</p>

<p>And so for a long hour and more he paced there moodily to and
fro, his hands clasped behind him, his turbaned head bowed in
thought, his heart very heavy within him. He was taken in the toils
of the evil web which he had spun; and it seemed very clear to him
now that nothing short of his life itself would be demanded as the
price of it. That, however, was the least part of his concern. All
things had miscarried with him and his life was wrecked. If at the
price of it he could ensure safety to Rosamund, that price he would
gladly pay. But his dismay and uneasiness all sprang from his
inability to discover a way of achieving that most desired of
objects even at such a sacrifice. And so he paced on alone and very
lonely, waiting and praying for a miracle.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2-16" id="ch2-16"></a>CHAPTER XVI &mdash; THE
PANNIER</h2>

<p>He was still pacing there when an hour or so before
sunset&mdash;some fifteen hours after setting out&mdash;they stood
before the entrance of a long bottle-necked cove under the shadow
of the cliffs of Aquila Point on the southern coast of the Island
of Formentera. He was rendered aware of this and roused from his
abstraction by the voice of Asad calling to him from the poop and
commanding him to make the cove.</p>

<p>Already the wind was failing them, and it became necessary to
take to the oars, as must in any case have happened once they were
through the cove's narrow neck into the becalmed lagoon beyond. So
Sakr-el-Bahr, in his turn, lifted up his voice, and in answer to
his shout came Vigitello and Larocque.</p>

<p>A blast of Vigitello's whistle brought his own men to heel, and
they passed rapidly along the benches ordering the rowers to make
ready, whilst Jasper and a half-dozen Muslim sailors set about
furling the sails that already were beginning to flap in the
shifting and intermittent gusts of the expiring wind. Sakr-el-Bahr
gave the word to row, and Vigitello blew a second and longer blast.
The oars dipped, the slaves strained and the galeasse ploughed
forward, time being kept by a boatswain's mate who squatted on the
waist-deck and beat a tomtom rhythmically. Sakr-el-Bahr, standing
on the poop-deck, shouted his orders to the steersmen in their
niches on either side of the stern, and skilfully the vessel was
manoeuvred through the narrow passage into the calm lagoon whose
depths were crystal clear. Here before coming to rest, Sakr-el-Bahr
followed the invariable corsair practice of going about, so as to
be ready to leave his moorings and make for the open again at a
moment's notice.</p>

<p>She came at last alongside the rocky buttresses of a gentle
slope that was utterly deserted by all save a few wild goats
browsing near the summit. There were clumps of broom, thick with
golden flower, about the base of the hill. Higher, a few gnarled
and aged olive trees reared their grey heads from which the rays of
the westering sun struck a glint as of silver.</p>

<p>Larocque and a couple of sailors went over the bulwarks on the
larboard quarter, dropped lightly to the horizontal shafts of the
oars, which were rigidly poised, and walking out upon them gained
the rocks and proceeded to make fast the vessel by ropes fore and
aft.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr's next task was to set a watch, and he appointed
Larocque, sending him to take his station on the summit of the head
whence a wide range of view was to be commanded.</p>

<p>Pacing the poop with Marzak the Basha grew reminiscent of former
days when roving the seas as a simple corsair he had used this cove
both for purposes of ambush and concealment. There were, he said,
few harbours in all the Mediterranean so admirably suited to the
corsairs' purpose as this; it was a haven of refuge in case of
peril, and an unrivalled lurking-place in which to lie in wait for
the prey. He remembered once having lain there with the formidable
Dragut-Reis, a fleet of six galleys, their presence entirely
unsuspected by the Genoese admiral, Doria, who had passed
majestically along with three caravels and seven galleys.</p>

<p>Marzak, pacing beside his father, listened but half-heartedly to
these reminiscences. His mind was all upon Sakr-el-Bahr, and his
suspicions of that palmetto bale were quickened by the manner in
which for the last two hours he had seen the corsair hovering
thoughtfully in its neighbourhood.</p>

<p>He broke in suddenly upon his father's memories with an
expression of what was in his mind.</p>

<p>"The thanks to Allah," he said, "that it is thou who command
this expedition, else might this cove's advantages have been
neglected."</p>

<p>"Not so," said Asad. "Sakr-el-Bahr knows them as well as I do.
He has used this vantage point afore-time. It was himself who
suggested that this would be the very place in which to await this
Spanish craft."</p>

<p>"Yet had he sailed alone I doubt if the Spanish argosy had
concerned him greatly. There are other matters on his mind, O my
father. Observe him yonder, all lost in thought. How many hours of
this voyage has he spent thus. He is as a man trapped and
desperate. There is some fear rankling in him. Observe him, I
say."</p>

<p>"Allah pardon thee," said his father, shaking his old head and
sighing over so much impetuosity of judgment. "Must thy imagination
be for ever feeding on thy malice? Yet I blame not thee, but thy
Sicilian mother, who has fostered this hostility in thee. Did she
not hoodwink me into making this unnecessary voyage?"</p>

<p>"I see thou hast forgot last night and the Frankish slave-girl,"
said his son.</p>

<p>"Nay, then thou seest wrong. I have not forgot it. But neither
have I forgot that since Allah hath exalted me to be Basha of
Algiers, He looks to me to deal in justice. Come, Marzak, set an
end to all this. Perhaps to-morrow thou shalt see him in battle,
and after such a sight as that never again wilt thou dare say evil
of him. Come, make thy peace with him, and let me see better
relations betwixt you hereafter."</p>

<p>And raising his voice he called Sakr-el-Bahr, who immediately
turned and came up the gangway. Marzak stood by in a sulky mood,
with no notion of doing his father's will by holding out an olive
branch to the man who was like to cheat him of his birthright ere
all was done. Yet was it he who greeted Sakr-el-Bahr when the
corsair set foot upon the poop.</p>

<p>"Does the thought of the coming fight perturb thee, dog of war?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Am I perturbed, pup of peace?" was the crisp answer.</p>

<p>"It seems so. Thine aloofness, thine abstractions..."</p>

<p>"Are signs of perturbation, dost suppose?"</p>

<p>"Of what else?"</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr laughed. "Thou'lt tell me next that I am afraid.
Yet I should counsel thee to wait until thou hast smelt blood and
powder, and learnt precisely what fear is."</p>

<p>The slight altercation drew the attention of Asad's officers who
were idling there. Biskaine and some three others lounged forward
to stand behind the Basha, looking, on in some amusement, which was
shared by him.</p>

<p>"Indeed, indeed," said Asad, laying a hand upon Marzak's
shoulder, "his counsel is sound enough. Wait, boy, until thou hast
gone beside him aboard the infidel, ere thou judge him easily
perturbed."</p>

<p>Petulantly Marzak shook off that gnarled old hand. "Dost thou, O
my father, join with him in taunting me upon my lack of knowledge.
My youth is a sufficient answer. But at least," he added, prompted
by a wicked notion suddenly conceived, "at least you cannot taunt
me with lack of address with weapons."</p>

<p>"Give him room," said Sakr-el-Bahr, with ironical good-humour,
"and he will show us prodigies."</p>

<p>Marzak looked at him with narrowing, gleaming eyes. "Give me a
cross-bow," he retorted, "and I'll show thee how to shoot," was his
amazing boast.</p>

<p>"Thou'lt show him?" roared Asad. "Thou'lt show him!" And his
laugh rang loud and hearty. "Go smear the sun's face with clay,
boy."</p>

<p>"Reserve thy judgment, O my father," begged Marzak, with frosty
dignity.</p>

<p>"Boy, thou'rt mad! Why, Sakr-el-Bahr's quarrel will check a
swallow in its flight."</p>

<p>"That is his boast, belike," replied Marzak.</p>

<p>"And what may thine be?" quoth Sakr-el-Bahr. "To hit the Island
of Formentera at this distance?"</p>

<p>"Dost dare to sneer at me?" cried Marzak, ruffling.</p>

<p>"What daring would that ask?" wondered Sakr-el-Bahr.</p>

<p>"By Allah, thou shalt learn."</p>

<p>"In all humility I await the lesson."</p>

<p>"And thou shalt have it," was the answer viciously delivered.
Marzak strode to the rail. "Ho there! Vigitello! A cross-bow for
me, and another for Sakr-el-Bahr."</p>

<p>Vigitello sprang to obey him, whilst Asad shook his head and
laughed again.</p>

<p>"An it were not against the Prophet's law to make a wager..." he
was beginning, when Marzak interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Already should I have proposed one."</p>

<p>"So that," said Sakr-el-Bahr, "thy purse would come to match
thine head for emptiness."</p>

<p>Marzak looked at him and sneered. Then he snatched from
Vigitello's hands one of the cross-bows that he bore and set a
shaft to it. And then at last Sakr-el-Bahr was to learn the malice
that was at the root of all this odd pretence.</p>

<p>"Look now," said the youth, "there is on that palmetto bale a
speck of pitch scarce larger than the pupil of my eye. Thou'lt need
to strain thy sight to see it. Observe how my shaft will find it.
Canst thou better such a shot?"</p>

<p>His eyes, upon Sakr-el-Bahr's face, watching it closely,
observed the pallor by which it was suddenly overspread. But the
corsair's recovery was almost as swift. He laughed, seeming so
entirely careless that Marzak began to doubt whether he had paled
indeed or whether his own imagination had led him to suppose
it.</p>

<p>"Ay, thou'lt choose invisible marks, and wherever the arrow
enters thou'lt say 'twas there! An old trick, O Marzak. Go cozen
women with it."</p>

<p>"Then," said Marzak, "we will take instead the slender cord that
binds the bale." And he levelled his bow. But Sakr-el-Bahr's hand
closed upon his arm in an easy yet paralyzing grip.</p>

<p>"Wait," he said. "Thou'lt choose another mark for several
reasons. For one, I'll not have thy shaft blundering through my
oarsmen and haply killing one of them. Most of them are slaves
specially chosen for their brawn, and I cannot spare any. Another
reason is that the mark is a foolish one. The distance is not more
than ten paces. A childish test, which, maybe, is the reason why
thou hast chosen it."</p>

<p>Marzak lowered his bow and Sakr-el-Bahr released his arm. They
looked at each other, the corsair supremely master of himself and
smiling easily, no faintest trace of the terror that was in his
soul showing upon his swarthy bearded countenance or in his hard
pale eyes.</p>

<p>He pointed up the hillside to the nearest olive tree, a hundred
paces distant. "Yonder," he said, "is a man's mark. Put me a shaft
through the long branch of that first olive."</p>

<p>Asad and his officers voiced approval.</p>

<p>"A man's mark, indeed," said the Basha, "so that he be a
marksman."</p>

<p>But Marzak shrugged his shoulders with make-believe contempt. "I
knew he would refuse the mark I set," said he. "As for the
olive-branch, it is so large a butt that a child could not miss it
at this distance."</p>

<p>"If a child could not, then thou shouldst not," said
Sakr-el-Bahr, who had so placed himself that his body was now
between Marzak and the palmetto bale. "Let us see thee hit it, O
Marzak." And as he spoke he raised his cross-bow, and scarcely
seeming to take aim, he loosed his shaft. It flashed away to be
checked, quivering, in the branch he had indicated.</p>

<p>A chorus of applause and admiration greeted the shot, and drew
the attention of all the crew to what was toward.</p>

<p>Marzak tightened his lips, realizing how completely he had been
outwitted. Willy-nilly he must now shoot at that mark. The choice
had been taken out of his hands by Sakr-el-Bahr. He never doubted
that he must cover himself with ridicule in the performance, and
that there he would be constrained to abandon this pretended
match.</p>

<p>"By the Koran," said Biskaine, "thou'lt need all thy skill to
equal such a shot, Marzak."</p>

<p>"'Twas not the mark I chose," replied Marzak sullenly.</p>

<p>"Thou wert the challenger, O Marzak," his father reminded him.
"Therefore the choice of mark was his. He chose a man's mark, and
by the beard of Mohammed, he showed us a man's shot."</p>

<p>Marzak would have flung the bow from him in that moment,
abandoning the method he had chosen to investigate the contents of
that suspicious palmetto bale; but he realized that such a course
must now cover him with scorn. Slowly he levelled his bow at that
distant mark.</p>

<p>"Have a care of the sentinel on the hill-top," Sakr-el-Bahr
admonished him, provoking a titter.</p>

<p>Angrily the youth drew the bow. The cord hummed, and the shaft
sped to bury itself in the hill's flank a dozen yards from the
mark.</p>

<p>Since he was the son of the Basha none dared to laugh outright
save his father and Sakr-el-Bahr. But there was no suppressing a
titter to express the mockery to which the proven braggart must
ever be exposed.</p>

<p>Asad looked at him, smiling almost sadly. "See now," he said,
"what comes of boasting thyself against Sakr-el-Bahr."</p>

<p>"My will was crossed in the matter of a mark," was the bitter
answer. "You angered me and made my aim untrue."</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr strode away to the starboard bulwarks, deeming the
matter at an end. Marzak observed him.</p>

<p>"Yet at that small mark," he said, "I challenge him again." As
he spoke he fitted a second shaft to his bow. "Behold!" he cried,
and took aim.</p>

<p>But swift as thought, Sakr-el-Bahr&mdash;heedless now of all
consequences&mdash;levelled at Marzak the bow which he still
held.</p>

<p>"Hold!" he roared. "Loose thy shaft at that bale, and I loose
this at thy throat. I never miss!" he added grimly.</p>

<p>There was a startled movement in the ranks of those who stood
behind Marzak. In speechless amazement they stared at Sakr-el-Bahr,
as he stood there, white-faced, his eyes aflash, his bow drawn taut
and ready to launch that death-laden quarrel as he threatened.</p>

<p>Slowly then, smiling with unutterable malice, Marzak lowered his
bow. He was satisfied. His true aim was reached. He had drawn his
enemy into self-betrayal.</p>

<p>Asad's was the voice that shattered that hush of
consternation.</p>

<p>"Kellamullah!" he bellowed. "What is this? Art thou mad, too, O
Sakr-el-Bahr?"</p>

<p>"Ay, mad indeed," said Marzak; "mad with fear." And he stepped
quickly aside so that the body of Biskaine should shield him from
any sudden consequences of his next words. "Ask him what he keeps
in that pannier, O my father."</p>

<p>"Ay, what, in Allah's name?" demanded the Basha, advancing
towards his captain.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr lowered his bow, master of himself again. His
composure was beyond all belief.</p>

<p>"I carry in it goods of price, which I'll not see riddled to
please a pert boy," he said.</p>

<p>"Goods of price?" echoed Asad, with a snort. "They'll need to be
of price indeed that are valued above the life of my son. Let us
see these goods of price." And to the men upon the waist-deck he
shouted, "Open me that pannier."</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr sprang forward, and laid a hand upon the Basha's
arm.</p>

<p>"Stay, my lord!" he entreated almost fiercely. "Consider that
this pannier is my own. That its contents are my property; that
none has a right to..."</p>

<p>"Wouldst babble of rights to me, who am thy lord?" blazed the
Basha, now in a towering passion. "Open me that pannier, I
say."</p>

<p>They were quick to his bidding. The ropes were slashed away, and
the front of the pannier fell open on its palmetto hinges. There
was a half-repressed chorus of amazement from the men. Sakr-el-Bahr
stood frozen in horror of what must follow.</p>

<p>"What is it? What have you found?" demanded Asad.</p>

<p>In silence the men swung the bale about, and disclosed to the
eyes of those upon the poop-deck the face and form of Rosamund
Godolphin. Then Sakr-el-Bahr, rousing himself from his trance of
horror, reckless of all but her, flung down the gangway to assist
her from the pannier, and thrusting aside those who stood about
her, took his stand at her side.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2-17" id="ch2-17"></a>CHAPTER XVII &mdash; THE
DUPE</h2>

<p>For a little while Asad stood at gaze, speechless in his
incredulity. Then to revive the anger that for a moment had been
whelmed in astonishment came the reflection that he had been duped
by Sakr-el-Bahr, duped by the man he trusted most. He had snarled
at Fenzileh and scorned Marzak when they had jointly warned him
against his lieutenant; if at times he had been in danger of
heeding them, yet sooner or later he had concluded that they but
spoke to vent their malice. And yet it was proven now that they had
been right in their estimate of this traitor, whilst he himself had
been a poor, blind dupe, needing Marzak's wit to tear the bandage
from his eyes.</p>

<p>Slowly he went down the gangway, followed by Marzak, Biskaine,
and the others. At the point where it joined the waist-deck he
paused, and his dark old eyes smouldered under his beetling
brows.</p>

<p>"So," he snarled. "These are thy goods of price. Thou lying dog,
what was thine aim in this?"</p>

<p>Defiantly Sakr-el-Bahr answered him: "She is my wife. It is my
right to take her with me where I go." He turned to her, and bade
her veil her face, and she immediately obeyed him with fingers that
shook a little in her agitation.</p>

<p>"None questions thy right to that," said Asad. "But being
resolved to take her with thee, why not take her openly? Why was
she not housed in the poop-house, as becomes the wife of
Sakr-el-Bahr? Why smuggle her aboard in a pannier, and keep her
there in secret?"</p>

<p>"And why," added Marzak, "didst thou lie to me when I questioned
thee upon her whereabouts?&mdash;telling me she was left behind in
thy house in Algiers?"</p>

<p>"All this I did," replied Sakr-el-Bahr, with a
lofty&mdash;almost a disdainful&mdash;dignity, "because I feared
lest I should be prevented from bearing her away with me," and his
bold glance, beating full upon Asad, drew a wave of colour into the
gaunt old cheeks.</p>

<p>"What could have caused that fear?" he asked. "Shall I tell
thee? Because no man sailing upon such a voyage as this would have
desired the company of his new-wedded wife. Because no man would
take a wife with him upon a raid in which there is peril of life
and peril of capture."</p>

<p>"Allah has watched over me his servant in the past," said
Sakr-el-Bahr, "and I put my trust in Him."</p>

<p>It was a specious answer. Such words&mdash;laying stress upon
the victories Allah sent him&mdash;had afore-time served to disarm
his enemies. But they served not now. Instead, they did but fan the
flames of Asad's wrath.</p>

<p>"Blaspheme not," he croaked, and his tall form quivered with
rage, his sallow old face grew vulturine. "She was brought thus
aboard in secret out of fear that were her presence known thy true
purpose too must stand revealed."</p>

<p>"And whatever that true purpose may have been," put in Marzak,
"it was not the task entrusted thee of raiding the Spanish
treasure-galley."</p>

<p>"'Tis what I mean, my son," Asad agreed. Then with a commanding
gesture: "Wilt thou tell me without further lies what thy purpose
was?" he asked.</p>

<p>"How?" said Sakr-el-Bahr, and he smiled never so faintly. "Hast
thou not said that this purpose was revealed by what I did? Rather,
then, I think is it for me to ask thee for some such information. I
do assure thee, my lord, that it was no part of my intention to
neglect the task entrusted me. But just because I feared lest
knowledge of her presence might lead my enemies to suppose what
thou art now supposing, and perhaps persuade thee to forget all
that I have done for the glory of Islam, I determined to bring her
secretly aboard.</p>

<p>"My real aim, since you must know it, was to land her somewhere
on the coast of France, whence she might return to her own land,
and her own people. That done, I should have set about intercepting
the Spanish galley, and never fear but that by Allah's favour I
should have succeeded."</p>

<p>"By the horns of Shaitan," swore Marzak, thrusting himself
forward, "he is the very father and mother of lies. Wilt thou
explain this desire to be rid of a wife thou hadst but wed?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"Ay," growled Asad. "Canst answer that?"</p>

<p>"Thou shalt hear the truth," said Sakr-el-Bahr.</p>

<p>"The praise to Allah!" mocked Marzak.</p>

<p>"But I warn you," the corsair continued, "that to you it will
seem less easy to believe by much than any falsehood I could
invent. Years ago in England where I was born I loved this woman
and should have taken her to wife. But there were men and
circumstances that defamed me to her so that she would not wed me,
and I went forth with hatred of her in my heart. Last night the
love of her which I believed to be dead and turned to loathing,
proved to be still a living force. Loving her, I came to see that I
had used her unworthily, and I was urged by a desire above all
others to undo the evil I had done."</p>

<p>On that he paused, and after an instant's silence Asad laughed
angrily and contemptuously. "Since when has man expressed his love
for a woman by putting her from him?" he asked in a voice of scorn
that showed the precise value he set upon such a statement.</p>

<p>"I warned thee it would seem incredible," said Sakr-el-Bahr.</p>

<p>"Is it not plain, O my father, that this marriage of his was no
more than a pretence?" cried Marzak.</p>

<p>"As plain as the light of day," replied Asad. "Thy marriage with
that woman made an impious mock of the True Faith. It was no
marriage. It was a blasphemous pretence, thine only aim to thwart
me, abusing my regard for the Prophet's Holy Law, and to set her
beyond my reach." He turned to Vigitello, who stood a little behind
Sakr-el-Bahr. "Bid thy men put me this traitor into irons," he
said.</p>

<p>"Heaven hath guided thee to a wise decision, O my father!" cried
Marzak, his voice jubilant. But his was the only jubilant note that
was sounded, his the only voice that was raised.</p>

<p>"The decision is more like to guide you both to Heaven," replied
Sakr-el-Bahr, undaunted. On the instant he had resolved upon his
course. "Stay!" he said, raising his hand to Vigitello, who, indeed
had shown no sign of stirring. He stepped close up to Asad, and
what he said did not go beyond those who stood immediately about
the Basha and Rosamund, who strained her ears that she might lose
no word of it.</p>

<p>"Do not think, Asad," he said, "that I will submit me like a
camel to its burden. Consider thy position well. If I but raise my
voice to call my sea-hawks to me, only Allah can tell how many will
be left to obey thee. Darest thou put this matter to the test?" he
asked, his countenance grave and solemn, but entirely fearless, as
of a man in whom there is no doubt of the issue as it concerns
himself.</p>

<p>Asad's eyes glittered dully, his colour faded to a deathly ashen
hue. "Thou infamous traitor..." he began in a thick voice, his body
quivering with anger.</p>

<p>"Ah no," Sakr-el-Bahr interrupted him. "Were I a traitor it is
what I should have done already, knowing as I do that in any
division of our forces, numbers will be heavily on my side. Let
then my silence prove my unswerving loyalty, Asad. Let it weigh
with thee in considering my conduct, nor permit thyself to be
swayed by Marzak there, who recks nothing so that he vents his
petty hatred of me."</p>

<p>"Do not heed him, O my father!" cried Marzak. "It cannot be
that..."</p>

<p>"Peace!" growled Asad, somewhat stricken on a sudden.</p>

<p>And there was peace whilst the Basha stood moodily combing his
white beard, his glittering eyes sweeping from Oliver to Rosamund
and back again. He was weighing what Sakr-el-Bahr had said. He more
than feared that it might be no more than true, and he realized
that if he were to provoke a mutiny here he would be putting all to
the test, setting all upon a throw in which the dice might well be
cogged against him.</p>

<p>If Sakr-el-Bahr prevailed, he would prevail not merely aboard
this galley, but throughout Algiers, and Asad would be cast down
never to rise again. On the other hand, if he bared his scimitar
and called upon the faithful to support him, it might chance that
recognizing in him the exalted of Allah to whom their loyalty was
due, they would rally to him. He even thought it might be probable.
Yet the stake he put upon the board was too vast. The game appalled
him, whom nothing yet had appalled, and it scarce needed a muttered
caution from Biskaine to determine him to hold his hand.</p>

<p>He looked at Sakr-el-Bahr again, his glance now sullen. "I will
consider thy words," he announced in a voice that was unsteady. "I
would not be unjust, nor steer my course by appearances alone.
Allah forbid!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2-18" id="ch2-18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII &mdash; SHEIK
MAT</h2>

<p>Under the inquisitive gaping stare of all about them stood
Rosamund and Sakr-el-Bahr regarding each other in silence for a
little spell after the Basha's departure. The very galley-slaves,
stirred from their habitual lethargy by happenings so curious and
unusual, craned their sinewy necks to peer at them with a flicker
of interest in their dull, weary eyes.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr's feelings as he considered Rosamunds's white face
in the fading light were most oddly conflicting. Dismay at what had
befallen and some anxious dread of what must follow were leavened
by a certain measure of relief.</p>

<p>He realized that in no case could her concealment have continued
long. Eleven mortal hours had she spent in the cramped and almost
suffocating space of that pannier, in which he had intended to do
no more than carry her aboard. The uneasiness which had been
occasioned him by the impossibility to deliver her from that close
confinement when Asad had announced his resolve to accompany them
upon that voyage, had steadily been increasing as hour succeeded
hour, and still he found no way to release her from a situation in
which sooner or later, when the limits of her endurance were
reached, her presence must be betrayed. This release which he could
not have contrived had been contrived for him by the suspicions and
malice of Marzak. That was the one grain of consolation in the
present peril&mdash;to himself who mattered nothing and to her, who
mattered all. Adversity had taught him to prize benefits however
slight and to confront perils however overwhelming. So he hugged
the present slender benefit, and resolutely braced himself to deal
with the situation as he found it, taking the fullest advantage of
the hesitancy which his words had sown in the heart of the Basha.
He hugged, too, the thought that as things had fallen out, from
being oppressor and oppressed, Rosamund and he were become fellows
in misfortune, sharing now a common peril. He found it a sweet
thought to dwell on. Therefore was it that he faintly smiled as he
looked into Rosamund's white, strained face.</p>

<p>That smile evoked from her the question that had been burdening
her mind.</p>

<p>"What now? What now?" she asked huskily, and held out appealing
hands to him.</p>

<p>"Now," said he coolly, "let us be thankful that you are
delivered from quarters destructive both to comfort and to dignity.
Let me lead you to those I had prepared for you, which you would
have occupied long since but for the ill-timed coming of Asad.
Come." And he waved an inviting hand towards the gangway leading to
the poop.</p>

<p>She shrank back at that, for there on the poop sat Asad under
his awning with Marzak, Biskaine, and his other officers in
attendance.</p>

<p>"Come," he repeated, "there is naught to fear so that you keep a
bold countenance. For the moment it is Sheik Mat&mdash;check to the
king."</p>

<p>"Naught to fear?" she echoed, staring.</p>

<p>"For the moment, naught," he answered firmly. "Against what the
future may hold, we must determine. Be sure that fear will not
assist our judgment."</p>

<p>She stiffened as if he had charged her unjustly.</p>

<p>"I do not fear," she assured him, and if her face continued
white, her eyes grew steady, her voice was resolute.</p>

<p>"Then come," he repeated, and she obeyed him instantly now as if
to prove the absence of all fear.</p>

<p>Side by side they passed up the gangway and mounted the steps of
the companion to the poop, their approach watched by the group that
was in possession of it with glances at once of astonishment and
resentment.</p>

<p>Asad's dark, smouldering eyes were all for the girl. They
followed her every movement as she approached and never for a
moment left her to turn upon her companion.</p>

<p>Outwardly she bore herself with a proud dignity and an
unfaltering composure under that greedy scrutiny; but inwardly she
shrank and writhed in a shame and humiliation that she could hardly
define. In some measure Oliver shared her feelings, but blent with
anger; and urged by them he so placed himself at last that he stood
between her and the Basha's regard to screen her from it as he
would have screened her from a lethal weapon. Upon the poop he
paused, and salaamed to Asad.</p>

<p>"Permit, exalted lord," said he, "that my wife may occupy the
quarters I had prepared for her before I knew that thou wouldst
honour this enterprise with thy presence."</p>

<p>Curtly, contemptuously, Asad waved a consenting hand without
vouchsafing to reply in words. Sakr-el-Bahr bowed again, stepped
forward, and put aside the heavy red curtain upon which the
crescent was wrought in green. From within the cabin the golden
light of a lamp came out to merge into the blue-gray twilight, and
to set a shimmering radiance about the white-robed figure of
Rosamund.</p>

<p>Thus for a moment Asad's fierce, devouring eyes observed her,
then she passed within. Sakr-el-Bahr followed, and the screening
curtain swung back into its place.</p>

<p>The small interior was furnished by a divan spread with silken
carpets, a low Moorish table in coloured wood mosaics bearing the
newly lighted lamp, and a tiny brazier in which aromatic gums were
burning and spreading a sweetly pungent perfume for the fumigation
of all True-Believers.</p>

<p>Out of the shadows in the farther corners rose silently
Sakr-el-Bahr's two Nubian slaves, Abiad and Zal-Zer, to salaam low
before him. But for their turbans and loincloths in spotless white
their dusky bodies must have remained invisible, shadowy among the
shadows.</p>

<p>The captain issued an order briefly, and from a hanging cupboard
the slaves took meat and drink and set it upon the low
table&mdash;a bowl of chicken cooked in rice and olives and prunes,
a dish of bread, a melon, and a clay amphora of water. Then at
another word from him, each took a naked scimitar and they passed
out to place themselves on guard beyond the curtain. This was not
an act in which there was menace or defiance, nor could Asad so
interpret it. The acknowledged presence of Sakr-el-Bahr's wife in
that poop-house, rendered the place the equivalent of his hareem,
and a man defends his hareem as he defends his honour; it is a spot
sacred to himself which none may violate, and it is fitting that he
take proper precaution against any impious attempt to do so.</p>

<p>Rosamund sank down upon the divan, and sat there with bowed
head, her hands folded in her lap. Sakr-el-Bahr stood by in silence
for a long moment contemplating her.</p>

<p>"Eat," he bade her at last. "You will need strength and courage,
and neither is possible to a fasting body."</p>

<p>She shook her head. Despite her long fast, food was repellent.
Anxiety was thrusting her heart up into her throat to choke
her.</p>

<p>"I cannot eat," she answered him. "To what end? Strength and
courage cannot avail me now."</p>

<p>"Never believe that," he said. "I have undertaken to deliver you
alive from the perils into which I have brought you, and I shall
keep my word."</p>

<p>So resolute was his tone that she looked up at him, and found
his bearing equally resolute and confident.</p>

<p>"Surely," she cried, "all chance of escape is lost to me."</p>

<p>"Never count it lost whilst I am living," he replied. She
considered him a moment, and there was the faintest smile on her
lips.</p>

<p>"Do you think that you will live long now?" she asked him.</p>

<p>"Just as long as God pleases," he replied quite coolly. "What is
written is written. So that I live long enough to deliver you,
then...why, then, faith I shall have lived long enough."</p>

<p>Her head sank. She clasped and unclasped the hands in her lap.
She shivered slightly.</p>

<p>"I think we are both doomed," she said in a dull voice. "For if
you die, I have your dagger still, remember. I shall not survive
you."</p>

<p>He took a sudden step forward, his eyes gleaming, a faint flush
glowing through the tan of his cheeks. Then he checked. Fool! How
could he so have misread her meaning even for a moment? Were not
its exact limits abundantly plain, even without the words which she
added a moment later?</p>

<p>"God will forgive me if I am driven to it&mdash;if I choose the
easier way of honour; for honour, sir," she added, clearly for his
benefit, "is ever the easier way, believe me."</p>

<p>"I know," he replied contritely. "I would to God I had followed
it."</p>

<p>He paused there, as if hoping that his expression of penitence
might evoke some answer from her, might spur her to vouchsafe him
some word of forgiveness. Seeing that she continued, mute and
absorbed, he sighed heavily, and turned to other matters.</p>

<p>"Here you will find all that you can require," he said. "Should
you lack aught you have but to beat your hands together, one or the
other of my slaves will come to you. If you address them in French
they will understand you. I would I could have brought a woman to
minister to you, but that was impossible, as you'll perceive." He
stepped to the entrance.</p>

<p>"You are leaving me?" she questioned him in sudden alarm.</p>

<p>"Naturally. But be sure that I shall be very near at hand. And
meanwhile be no less sure that you have no cause for immediate
fear. At least, matters are no worse than when you were in the
pannier. Indeed, much better, for some measure of ease and comfort
is now possible to you. So be of good heart; eat and rest. God
guard you! I shall return soon after sunrise."</p>

<p>Outside on the poop-deck he found Asad alone now with Marzak
under the awning. Night had fallen, the great crescent lanterns on
the stern rail were alight and cast a lurid glow along the vessel's
length, picking out the shadowy forms and gleaming faintly on the
naked backs of the slaves in their serried ranks along the benches,
many of them bowed already in attitudes of uneasy slumber. Another
lantern swung from the mainmast, and yet another from the poop-rail
for the Basha's convenience. Overhead the clustering stars
glittered in a cloudless sky of deepest purple. The wind had fallen
entirely, and the world was wrapped in stillness broken only by the
faint rustling break of waves upon the beach at the cove's end.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr crossed to Asad's side, and begged for a word alone
with him.</p>

<p>"I am alone," said the Basha curtly.</p>

<p>"Marzak is nothing, then," said Sakr-el-Bahr. "I have long
suspected it."</p>

<p>Marzak showed his teeth and growled inarticulately, whilst the
Basha, taken aback by the ease reflected in the captain's careless,
mocking words, could but quote a line of the Koran with which
Fenzileh of late had often nauseated him.</p>

<p>"A man's son is the partner of his soul. I have no secrets from
Marzak. Speak, then, before him, or else be silent and depart."</p>

<p>"He may be the partner of thy soul, Asad," replied the corsair
with his bold mockery, "but I give thanks to Allah he is not the
partner of mine. And what I have to say in some sense concerns my
soul."</p>

<p>"I thank thee," cut in Marzak, "for the justice of thy words. To
be the partner of thy soul were to be an infidel unbelieving
dog."</p>

<p>"Thy tongue, O Marzak, is like thine archery," said
Sakr-el-Bahr.</p>

<p>"Ay&mdash;in that it pierces treachery," was the swift
retort.</p>

<p>"Nay&mdash;in that it aims at what it cannot hit. Now, Allah,
pardon me! Shall I grow angry at such words as thine? Hath not the
One proven full oft that he who calls me infidel dog is a liar
predestined to the Pit? Are such victories as mine over the fleets
of the unbelievers vouchsafed by Allah to an infidel? Foolish
blasphemer, teach thy tongue better ways lest the All-wise strike
thee dumb."</p>

<p>"Peace!" growled Asad. "Thine arrogance is out of season."</p>

<p>"Haply so," said Sakr-el-Bahr, with a laugh. "And my good sense,
too, it seems. Since thou wilt retain beside thee this partner of
thy soul, I must speak before him. Have I thy leave to sit?"</p>

<p>Lest such leave should be denied him he dropped forthwith to the
vacant place beside Asad and tucked his legs under him.</p>

<p>"Lord," he said, "there is a rift dividing us who should be
united for the glory of Islam."</p>

<p>"It is of thy making, Sakr-el-Bahr," was the sullen answer, "and
it is for thee to mend it."</p>

<p>"To that end do I desire thine ear. The cause of this rift is
yonder." And he jerked his thumb backward over his shoulder towards
the poop-house. "If we remove that cause, of a surety the rift
itself will vanish, and all will be well again between us."</p>

<p>He knew that never could all be well again between him and Asad.
He knew that by virtue of his act of defiance he was irrevocably
doomed, that Asad having feared him once, having dreaded his power
to stand successfully against his face and overbear his will, would
see to it that he never dreaded it again. He knew that if he
returned to Algiers there would be a speedy end to him. His only
chance of safety lay, indeed, in stirring up mutiny upon the spot
and striking swiftly, venturing all upon that desperate throw. And
he knew that this was precisely what Asad had cause to fear. Out of
this assurance had he conceived his present plan, deeming that if
he offered to heal the breach, Asad might pretend to consent so as
to weather his present danger, making doubly sure of his vengeance
by waiting until they should be home again.</p>

<p>Asad's gleaming eyes considered him in silence for a moment.</p>

<p>"How remove that cause?" he asked. "Wilt thou atone for the
mockery of thy marriage, pronounce her divorced and relinquish
her?"</p>

<p>"That were not to remove her," replied Sakr-el-Bahr. "Consider
well, Asad, what is thy duty to the Faith. Consider that upon our
unity depends the glory of Islam. Were it not sinful, then, to
suffer the intrusion of aught that may mar such unity? Nay, nay,
what I propose is that I should be permitted&mdash;assisted
even&mdash;to bear out the project I had formed, as already I have
frankly made confession. Let us put to sea again at dawn&mdash;or
this very night if thou wilt&mdash;make for the coast of France,
and there set her ashore that she may go back to her own people and
we be rid of her disturbing presence. Then we will return&mdash;
there is time and to spare&mdash;and here or elsewhere lurk in wait
for this Spanish argosy, seize the booty and sail home in amity to
Algiers, this incident, this little cloud in the splendour of our
comradeship, behind us and forgotten as though it had never been.
Wilt thou, Asad&mdash;for the glory of the Prophet's Law?"</p>

<p>The bait was cunningly presented, so cunningly that not for a
moment did Asad or even the malicious Marzak suspect it to be just
a bait and no more. It was his own life, become a menace to Asad,
that Sakr-el-Bahr was offering him in exchange for the life and
liberty of that Frankish slave-girl, but offering it as if
unconscious that he did so.</p>

<p>Asad considered, temptation gripping him. Prudence urged him to
accept, so that affecting to heal the dangerous breach that now
existed he might carry Sakr-el-Bahr back to Algiers, there, beyond
the aid of any friendly mutineers, to have him strangled. It was
the course to adopt in such a situation, the wise and sober course
by which to ensure the overthrow of one who from an obedient and
submissive lieutenant had suddenly shown that it was possible for
him to become a serious and dangerous rival.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr watched the Basha's averted, gleaming eyes under
their furrowed, thoughtful brows, he saw Marzak's face white, tense
and eager in his anxiety that his father should consent. And since
his father continued silent, Marzak, unable longer to contain
himself, broke into speech.</p>

<p>"He is wise, O my father!" was his crafty appeal. "The glory of
Islam above all else! Let him have his way in this, and let the
infidel woman go. Thus shall all be well between us and
Sakr-el-Bahr!" He laid such a stress upon these words that it was
obvious he desired them to convey a second meaning.</p>

<p>Asad heard and understood that Marzak, too, perceived what was
here to do; tighter upon him became temptation's grip; but tighter,
too, became the grip of a temptation of another sort. Before his
fierce eyes there arose a vision of a tall stately maiden with
softly rounded bosom, a vision so white and lovely that it enslaved
him. And so he found himself torn two ways at once. On the one
hand, if he relinquished the woman, he could make sure of his
vengeance upon Sakr-el-Bahr, could make sure of removing that rebel
from his path. On the other hand, if he determined to hold fast to
his desires and to be ruled by them, he must be prepared to risk a
mutiny aboard the galeasse, prepared for battle and perhaps for
defeat. It was a stake such as no sane Basha would have consented
to set upon the board. But since his eyes had again rested upon
Rosamund, Asad was no longer sane. His thwarted desires of
yesterday were the despots of his wits.</p>

<p>He leaned forward now, looking deep into the eyes of
Sakr-el-Bahr.</p>

<p>"Since for thyself thou dost not want her, why dost thou thwart
me?" he asked, and his voice trembled with suppressed passion. "So
long as I deemed thee honest in taking her to wife I respected that
bond as became a good Muslim; but since 'tis manifest that it was
no more than a pretence, a mockery to serve some purpose hostile to
myself, a desecration of the Prophet's Holy Law, I, before whom
this blasphemous marriage was performed, do pronounce it to be no
marriage. There is no need for thee to divorce her. She is no
longer thine. She is for any Muslim who can take her."</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr laughed unpleasantly. "Such a Muslim," he
announced, "will be nearer my sword than the Paradise of Mahomet."
And on the words he stood up, as if in token of his readiness.</p>

<p>Asad rose with him in a bound of a vigour such as might scarce
have been looked for in a man of his years.</p>

<p>"Dost threaten?" he cried, his eyes aflash.</p>

<p>"Threaten?" sneered Sakr-el-Bahr. "I prophesy." And on that he
turned, and stalked away down the gangway to the vessel's waist.
There was no purpose in his going other than his perceiving that
here argument were worse than useless, and that the wiser course
were to withdraw at once, avoiding it and allowing his veiled
threat to work upon the Basha's mind.</p>

<p>Quivering with rage Asad watched his departure. On the point of
commanding him to return, he checked, fearing lest in his present
mood Sakr-el-Bahr should flout his authority and under the eyes of
all refuse him the obedience due. He knew that it is not good to
command where we are not sure of being obeyed or of being able to
enforce obedience, that an authority once successfully flouted is
in itself half-shattered.</p>

<p>Whilst still he hesitated, Marzak, who had also risen, caught
him by the arm and poured into his ear hot, urgent arguments
enjoining him to yield to Sakr-el-Bahr's demand.</p>

<p>"It is the sure way," he cried insistently. "Shall all be
jeopardized for the sake of that whey-faced daughter of perdition?
In the name of Shaitan, let us be rid of her; set her ashore as he
demands, as the price of peace between us and him, and in the
security of that peace let him be strangled when we come again to
our moorings in Algiers. It is the sure way&mdash;the sure
way!"</p>

<p>Asad turned at last to look into that handsome eager face. For a
moment he was at a loss; then he had recourse to sophistry. "Am I a
coward that I should refuse all ways but sure ones?" he demanded in
a withering tone. "Or art thou a coward who can counsel none
other?"</p>

<p>"My anxiety is all for thee, O my father," Marzak defended
himself indignantly. "I doubt if it be safe to sleep, lest he
should stir up mutiny in the night."</p>

<p>"Have no fear," replied Asad. "Myself I have set the watch, and
the officers are all trustworthy. Biskaine is even now in the
forecastle taking the feeling of the men. Soon we shall know
precisely where we stand."</p>

<p>"In thy place I would make sure. I would set a term to this
danger of mutiny. I would accede to his demands concerning the
woman, and settle after-wards with himself."</p>

<p>"Abandon that Frankish pearl?" quoth Asad. Slowly he shook his
head. "Nay, nay! She is a garden that shall yield me roses.
Together we shall yet taste the sweet sherbet of Kansar, and she
shall thank me for having led her into Paradise. Abandon that
rosy-limbed loveliness!" He laughed softly on a note of exaltation,
whilst in the gloom Marzak frowned, thinking of Fenzileh.</p>

<p>"She is an infidel," his son sternly reminded him, "so forbidden
thee by the Prophet. Wilt thou be as blind to that as to thine own
peril?" Then his voice gathering vehemence and scorn as he
proceeded: "She has gone naked of face through the streets of
Algiers; she has been gaped at by the rabble in the sk; this
loveliness of hers has been deflowered by the greedy gaze of Jew
and Moor and Turk; galley-slaves and negroes have feasted their
eyes upon her unveiled beauty; one of thy captains hath owned her
his wife." He laughed. "By Allah, I do not know thee, O my father!
Is this the woman thou wouldst take for thine own? This the woman
for whose possession thou wouldst jeopardize thy life and perhaps
the very Bashalik itself!"</p>

<p>Asad clenched his hands until the nails bit into his flesh.
Every word his son had uttered had been as a lash to his soul. The
truth of it was not to be contested. He was humiliated and shamed.
Yet was he not conquered of his madness, nor diverted from his
course. Before he could make answer, the tall martial figure of
Biskaine came up the companion.</p>

<p>"Well?" the Basha greeted him eagerly, thankful for this chance
to turn the subject.</p>

<p>Biskaine was downcast. His news was to be read in his
countenance. "The task appointed me was difficult," said he. "I
have done my best. Yet I could scarce go about it in such a fashion
as to draw definite conclusions. But this I know, my lord, that he
will be reckless indeed if he dares to take up arms against thee
and challenge thine authority. So much at least I am permitted to
conclude."</p>

<p>"No more than that?" asked Asad. "And if I were to take up arms
against him, and to seek to settle this matter out of hand?"</p>

<p>Biskaine paused a moment ere replying. "I cannot think but that
Allah would vouchsafe thee victory," he said. But his words did not
delude the Basha. He recognized them to be no more than those which
respect for him dictated to his officer. "Yet," continued Biskaine,
"I should judge thee reckless too, my lord, as reckless as I should
judge him in the like circumstances."</p>

<p>"I see," said Asad. "The matter stands so balanced that neither
of us dare put it to the test."</p>

<p>"Thou hast said it."</p>

<p>"Then is thy course plain to thee!" cried Marzak, eager to renew
his arguments. "Accept his terms, and..."</p>

<p>But Asad broke in impatiently. "Every thing in its own hour and
each hour is written. I will consider what to do."</p>

<p>Below on the waist-deck Sakr-el-Bahr was pacing with Vigitello,
and Vigitello's words to him were of a tenor identical almost with
those of Biskaine to the Basha.</p>

<p>"I scarce can judge," said the Italian renegade. "But I do think
that it were not wise for either thou or Asad to take the first
step against the other."</p>

<p>"Are matters, then, so equal between us?"</p>

<p>"Numbers, I fear," replied Vigitello, "would be in favour of
Asad. No truly devout Muslim will stand against the Basha, the
representative of the Sublime Portal, to whom loyalty is a question
of religion. Yet they are accustomed to obey thee, to leap at thy
command, and so Asad himself were rash to put it to the test."</p>

<p>"Ay&mdash;a sound argument," said Sakr-el-Bahr. "It is as I had
thought."</p>

<p>Upon that he quitted Vigitello, and slowly, thoughtfully,
returned to the poop-deck. It was his hope&mdash;his only hope
now&mdash;that Asad might accept the proposal he had made him. As
the price of it he was fully prepared for the sacrifice of his own
life, which it must entail. But, it was not for him to approach
Asad again; to do so would be to argue doubt and anxiety and so to
court refusal. He must possess his soul in what patience he could.
If Asad persisted in his refusal undeterred by any fear of mutiny,
then Sakr-el-Bahr knew not what course remained him to accomplish
Rosamund's deliverance. Proceed to stir up mutiny he dared not. It
was too desperate a throw. In his own view it offered him no
slightest chance of success, and did it fail, then indeed all would
be lost, himself destroyed, and Rosamund at the mercy of Asad. He
was as one walking along a sword-edge. His only chance of present
immunity for himself and Rosamund lay in the confidence that Asad
would dare no more than himself to take the initiative in
aggression. But that was only for the present, and at any moment
Asad might give the word to put about and steer for Barbary again;
in no case could that be delayed beyond the plundering of the
Spanish argosy. He nourished the faint hope that in that coming
fight&mdash;if indeed the Spaniards did show fight&mdash;some
chance might perhaps present itself, some unexpected way out of the
present situation.</p>

<p>He spent the night under the stars, stretched across the
threshold of the curtained entrance to the poop-house, making thus
a barrier of his body whilst he slept, and himself watched over in
his turn by his faithful Nubians who remained on guard. He awakened
when the first violet tints of dawn were in the east, and quietly
dismissing the weary slaves to their rest, he kept watch alone
thereafter. Under the awning on the starboard quarter slept the
Basha and his son, and near them Biskaine was snoring.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2-19" id="ch2-19"></a>CHAPTER XIX &mdash; THE
MUTINEERS</h2>

<p>Later that morning, some time after the galeasse had awakened to
life and such languid movement as might be looked for in a waiting
crew, Sakr-el-Bahr went to visit Rosamund.</p>

<p>He found her brightened and refreshed by sleep, and he brought
her reassuring messages that all was well, encouraging her with
hopes which himself he was very far from entertaining. If her
reception of him was not expressedly friendly, neither was it
unfriendly. She listened to the hopes he expressed of yet effecting
her safe deliverance, and whilst she had no thanks to offer him for
the efforts he was to exert on her behalf&mdash;accepting them as
her absolute due, as the inadequate liquidation of the debt that
lay between them&mdash;yet there was now none of that aloofness
amounting almost to scorn which hitherto had marked her bearing
towards him.</p>

<p>He came again some hours later, in the afternoon, by when his
Nubians were once more at their post. He had no news to bring her
beyond the fact that their sentinel on the heights reported a sail
to westward, beating up towards the island before the very gentle
breeze that was blowing. But the argosy they awaited was not yet in
sight, and he confessed that certain proposals which he had made to
Asad for landing her in France had been rejected. Still she need
have no fear, he added promptly, seeing the sudden alarm that
quickened in her eyes. A way would present itself. He was watching,
and would miss no chance.</p>

<p>"And if no chance should offer?" she asked him.</p>

<p>"Why then I will make one," he answered, lightly almost. "I have
been making them all my life, and it would be odd if I should have
lost the trick of it on my life's most important occasion."</p>

<p>This mention of his life led to a question from her.</p>

<p>"How did you contrive the chance that has made you what you are?
I mean," she added quickly, as if fearing that the purport of that
question might be misunderstood, "that has enabled you to become a
corsair captain."</p>

<p>"'Tis a long story that," he said. "I should weary you in the
telling of it."</p>

<p>"No," she replied, and shook her head, her clear eyes solemnly
meeting his clouded glance. "You would not weary me. Chances may be
few in which to learn it."</p>

<p>"And you would learn it?" quoth he, and added, "That you may
judge me?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she said, and her eyes fell.</p>

<p>With bowed head he paced the length of the small chamber, and
back again. His desire was to do her will in this, which is natural
enough&mdash;for if it is true that who knows all must perforce
forgive all, never could it have been truer than in the case of Sir
Oliver Tressilian.</p>

<p>So he told his tale. Pacing there he related it at length, from
the days when he had toiled at an oar on one of the galleys of
Spain down to that hour in which aboard the Spanish vessel taken
under Cape Spartel he had determined upon that voyage to England to
present his reckoning to his brother. He told his story simply and
without too great a wealth of detail, yet he omitted nothing of all
that had gone to place him where he stood. And she, listening, was
so profoundly moved that at one moment her eyes glistened with
tears which she sought vainly to repress. Yet he, pacing there,
absorbed, with head bowed and eyes that never once strayed in her
direction, saw none of this.</p>

<p>"And so," he said, when at last that odd narrative had reached
its end, "you know what the forces were that drove me. Another
stronger than myself might have resisted and preferred to suffer
death. But I was not strong enough. Or perhaps it is that stronger
than myself was my desire to punish, to vent the bitter hatred into
which my erstwhile love for Lionel was turned."</p>

<p>"And for me, too&mdash;as you have told me," she added.</p>

<p>"Not so," he corrected her. "I hated you for your unfaith, and
most of all for your having burnt unread the letter that I sent you
by the hand of Pitt. In doing that you contributed to the wrongs I
was enduring, you destroyed my one chance of establishing my
innocence and seeking rehabilitation, you doomed me for life to the
ways which I was treading. But I did not then know what ample cause
you had to believe me what I seemed. I did not know that it was
believed I had fled. Therefore I forgive you freely a deed for
which at one time I confess that I hated you, and which spurred me
to bear you off when I found you under my hand that night at
Arwenack when I went for Lionel."</p>

<p>"You mean that it was no part of your intent to have done so?"
she asked him.</p>

<p>"To carry you off together with him?" he asked. "I swear to God
I had not premeditated that. Indeed, it was done because not
premeditated, for had I considered it, I do think I should have
been proof against any such temptation. It assailed me suddenly
when I beheld you there with Lionel, and I succumbed to it. Knowing
what I now know I am punished enough, I think."</p>

<p>"I think I can understand," she murmured gently, as if to
comfort him, for quick pain had trembled in his voice.</p>

<p>He tossed back his turbaned head. "To understand is something,"
said he. "It is half-way at least to forgiveness. But ere
forgiveness can be accepted the evil done must be atoned for to the
full."</p>

<p>"If possible," said she.</p>

<p>"It must be made possible," he answered her with heat, and on
that he checked abruptly, arrested by a sound of shouting from
without.</p>

<p>He recognized the voice of Larocque, who at dawn had returned to
his sentinel's post on the summit of the headland, relieving the
man who had replaced him there during the night.</p>

<p>"My lord! My lord!" was the cry, in a voice shaken by
excitement, and succeeded by a shouting chorus from the crew.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr turned swiftly to the entrance, whisked aside the
curtain, and stepped out upon the poop. Larocque was in the very
act of clambering over the bulwarks amidships, towards the
waist-deck where Asad awaited him in company with Marzak and the
trusty Biskaine. The prow, on which the corsairs had lounged at
ease since yesterday, was now a seething mob of inquisitive
babbling men, crowding to the rail and even down the gangway in
their eagerness to learn what news it was that brought the sentinel
aboard in such excited haste.</p>

<p>From where he stood Sakr-el-Bahr heard Larocque's loud
announcement.</p>

<p>"The ship I sighted at dawn, my lord!"</p>

<p>"Well?" barked Asad.</p>

<p>"She is here&mdash;in the bay beneath that headland. She has
just dropped anchor."</p>

<p>"No need for alarm in that," replied the Basha at once. "Since
she has anchored there it is plain that she has no suspicion of our
presence. What manner of ship is she?"</p>

<p>"A tall galleon of twenty guns, flying the flag of England."</p>

<p>"Of England!" cried Asad in surprise. "She'll need be a stout
vessel to hazard herself in Spanish waters."</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr advanced to the rail.</p>

<p>"Does she display no further device?" he asked.</p>

<p>Larocque turned at the question. "Ay," he answered, "a narrow
blue pennant on her mizzen is charged with a white bird&mdash;a
stork, I think."</p>

<p>"A stork?" echoed Sakr-el-Bahr thoughtfully. He could call to
mind no such English blazon, nor did it seem to him that it could
possibly be English. He caught the sound of a quickly indrawn
breath behind him. He turned to find Rosamund standing in the
entrance, not more than half concealed by the curtain. Her face
showed white and eager, her eyes were wide.</p>

<p>"What is't?" he asked her shortly.</p>

<p>"A stork, he thinks," she said, as though that were answer
enough.</p>

<p>"I' faith an unlikely bird," he commented. "The fellow is
mistook."</p>

<p>"Yet not by much, Sir Oliver."</p>

<p>"How? Not by much?" Intrigued by something in her tone and
glance, he stepped quickly up to her, whilst below the chatter of
voices increased.</p>

<p>"That which he takes to be a stork is a heron&mdash;a white
heron, and white is argent in heraldry, is't not?"</p>

<p>"It is. What then?"</p>

<p>"D'ye not see? That ship will be the Silver Heron."</p>

<p>He looked at her. "'S life!" said he, "I reck little whether it
be the silver heron or the golden grasshopper. What odds?"</p>

<p>"It is Sir John's ship&mdash;Sir John Killigrew's," she
explained. "She was all but ready to sail when...when you came to
Arwenack. He was for the Indies. Instead&mdash;don't you
see?&mdash;out of love for me he will have come after me upon a
forlorn hope of overtaking you ere you could make Barbary."</p>

<p>"God's light!" said Sakr-el-Bahr, and fell to musing. Then he
raised his head and laughed. "Faith, he's some days late for
that!"</p>

<p>But the jest evoked no response from her. She continued to stare
at him with those eager yet timid eyes.</p>

<p>"And yet," he continued, "he comes opportunely enough. If the
breeze that has fetched him is faint, yet surely it blows from
Heaven."</p>

<p>"Were it...?" she paused, faltering a moment.</p>

<p>Then, "Were it possible to communicate with him?" she asked, yet
with hesitation.</p>

<p>"Possible&mdash;ay," he answered. "Though we must needs devise
the means, and that will prove none so easy."</p>

<p>"And you would do it?" she inquired, an undercurrent of wonder
in her question, some recollection of it in her face.</p>

<p>"Why, readily," he answered, "since no other way presents
itself. No doubt 'twill cost some lives," he added, "but then..."
And he shrugged to complete the sentence.</p>

<p>"Ah, no, no! Not at that price!" she protested. And how was he
to know that all the price she was thinking of was his own life,
which she conceived would be forfeited if the assistance of the
Silver Heron were invoked?</p>

<p>Before he could return her any answer his attention was
diverted. A sullen threatening note had crept into the babble of
the crew, and suddenly one or two voices were raised to demand
insistently that Asad should put to sea at once and remove his
vessel from a neighbourhood become so dangerous. Now, the fault of
this was Marzak's. His was the voice that first had uttered that
timid suggestion, and the infection of his panic had spread
instantly through the corsair ranks.</p>

<p>Asad, drawn to the full of his gaunt height, turned upon them
the eyes that had quelled greater clamours, and raised the voice
which in its day had hurled a hundred men straight into the jaws of
death without a protest.</p>

<p>"Silence!" he commanded. "I am your lord and need no counsellors
save Allah. When I consider the time come, I will give the word to
row, but not before. Back to your quarters, then, and peace!"</p>

<p>He disdained to argue with them, to show them what sound reasons
there were for remaining in this secret cove and against putting
forth into the open. Enough for them that such should be his will.
Not for them to question his wisdom and his decisions.</p>

<p>But Asad-ed-Din had lain overlong in Algiers whilst his fleets
under Sakr-el-Bahr and Biskaine had scoured the inland sea. The men
were no longer accustomed to the goad of his voice, their
confidence in his judgment was not built upon the sound basis of
past experience. Never yet had he led into battle the men of this
crew and brought them forth again in triumph and enriched by
spoil.</p>

<p>So now they set their own judgment against his. To them it
seemed a recklessness&mdash;as, indeed, Marzak had
suggested&mdash;to linger here, and his mere announcement of his
purpose was far from sufficient to dispel their doubts.</p>

<p>The murmurs swelled, not to be overborne by his fierce presence
and scowling brow, and suddenly one of the renegades&mdash;secretly
prompted by the wily Vigitello&mdash;raised a shout for the captain
whom they knew and trusted.</p>

<p>"Sakr-el-Bahr! Sakr-el-Bahr! Thou'lt not leave us penned in this
cove to perish like rats!"</p>

<p>It was as a spark to a train of powder. A score of voices
instantly took up the cry; hands were flung out towards
Sakr-el-Bahr, where he stood above them and in full view of all,
leaning impassive and stern upon the poop-rail, whilst his agile
mind weighed the opportunity thus thrust upon him, and considered
what profit was to be extracted from it.</p>

<p>Asad fell back a pace in his profound mortification. His face
was livid, his eyes blared furiously, his hand flew to the jewelled
hilt of his scimitar, yet forbore from drawing the blade. Instead
he let loose upon Marzak the venom kindled in his soul by this
evidence of how shrunken was his authority.</p>

<p>"Thou fool!" he snarled. "Look on thy craven's work. See what a
devil thou hast raised with thy woman's counsels. Thou to command a
galley! Thou to become a fighter upon the seas! I would that Allah
had stricken me dead ere I begat me such a son as thou!"</p>

<p>Marzak recoiled before the fury of words that he feared might be
followed by yet worse. He dared make no answer, offer no excuse; in
that moment he scarcely dared breathe.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Rosamund in her eagerness had advanced until she stood
at Sakr-el-Bahr's elbow.</p>

<p>"God is helping us!" she said in a voice of fervent gratitude.
"This is your opportunity. The men will obey you."</p>

<p>He looked at her, and smiled faintly upon her eagerness. "Ay,
mistress, they will obey me," he said. But in the few moments that
were sped he had taken his resolve. Whilst undoubtedly Asad was
right, and the wise course was to lie close in this sheltering cove
where the odds of their going unperceived were very heavily in
their favour, yet the men's judgment was not altogether at fault.
If they were to put to sea, they might by steering an easterly
course pass similarly unperceived, and even should the splash of
their oars reach the galleon beyond the headland, yet by the time
she had weighed anchor and started in pursuit they would be well
away straining every ounce of muscle at the oars, whilst the
breeze&mdash;a heavy factor in his considerations&mdash;was become
so feeble that they could laugh at pursuit by a vessel that
depended upon wind alone. The only danger, then, was the danger of
the galleon's cannon, and that danger was none so great as from
experience Sakr-el-Bahr well knew.</p>

<p>Thus was he reluctantly forced to the conclusion that in the
main the wiser policy was to support Asad, and since he was full
confident of the obedience of the men he consoled himself with the
reflection that a moral victory might be in store for him out of
which some surer profit might presently be made.</p>

<p>In answer, then, to those who still called upon him, he leapt
down the companion and strode along the gangway to the waist-deck
to take his stand at the Basha's side. Asad watched his approach
with angry misgivings; it was with him a foregone conclusion that
things being as they were Sakr-el-Bahr would be ranged against him
to obtain complete control of these mutineers and to cull the
fullest advantage from the situation. Softly and slowly he
unsheathed his scimitar, and Sakr-el-Bahr seeing this out of the
corner of his eye, yet affected not to see, but stood forward to
address the men.</p>

<p>"How now?" he thundered wrathfully. "What shall this mean? Are
ye all deaf that ye have not heard the commands of your Basha, the
exalted of Allah, that ye dare raise your mutinous voices and say
what is your will?"</p>

<p>Sudden and utter silence followed that exhortation. Asad
listened in relieved amazement; Rosamund caught her breath in sheer
dismay.</p>

<p>What could he mean, then? Had he but fooled and duped her? Were
his intentions towards her the very opposite to his protestations?
She leant upon the poop-rail straining to catch every syllable of
that speech of his in the lingua franca, hoping almost that her
indifferent knowledge of it had led her into error on the score of
what he had said.</p>

<p>She saw him turn with a gesture of angry command upon Larocque,
who stood there by the bulwarks, waiting.</p>

<p>"Back to thy post up yonder, and keep watch upon that vessel's
movements, reporting them to us. We stir not hence until such be
our lord Asad's good pleasure. Away with thee!"</p>

<p>Larocque without a murmur threw a leg over the bulwarks and
dropped to the oars, whence he clambered ashore as he had been
bidden. And not a single voice was raised in protest.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr's dark glance swept the ranks of the corsairs
crowding the forecastle.</p>

<p>"Because this pet of the hareem," he said, immensely daring,
indicating Marzak by a contemptuous gesture, "bleats of danger into
the ears of men, are ye all to grow timid and foolish as a herd of
sheep? By Allah! What are ye? Are ye the fearless sea-hawks that
have flown with me, and struck where the talons of my
grappling-hooks were flung, or are ye but scavenging crows?"</p>

<p>He was answered by an old rover whom fear had rendered greatly
daring.</p>

<p>"We are trapped here as Dragut was trapped at Jerba."</p>

<p>"Thou liest," he answered. "Dragut was not trapped, for Dragut
found a way out. And against Dragut there was the whole navy of
Genoa, whilst against us there is but one single galleon. By the
Koran, if she shows fight, have we no teeth? Will it be the first
galleon whose decks we have overrun? But if ye prefer a coward's
counsel, ye sons of shame, consider that once we take the open sea
our discovery will be assured, and Larocque hath told you that she
carries twenty guns. I tell you that if we are to be attacked by
her, best be attacked at close quarters, and I tell you that if we
lie close and snug in here it is long odds that we shall never be
attacked at all. That she has no inkling of our presence is proven,
since she has cast anchor round the headland. And consider that if
we fly from a danger that doth not exist, and in our flight are so
fortunate as not to render real that danger and to court it, we
abandon a rich argosy that shall bring profit to us all."</p>

<p>"But I waste my breath in argument," he ended abruptly. "You
have heard the commands of your lord, Asad-ed-Din, and that should
be argument enough. No more of this, then."</p>

<p>Without so much as waiting to see them disperse from the rail
and return to their lounging attitudes about the forecastle, he
turned to Asad.</p>

<p>"It might have been well to hang the dog who spoke of Dragut and
Jerba," he said. "But it was never in my nature to be harsh with
those who follow me." And that was all.</p>

<p>Asad from amazement had passed quickly to admiration and a sort
of contrition, into which presently there crept a poisonous tinge
of jealousy to see Sakr-el-Bahr prevail where he himself alone must
utterly have failed. This jealousy spread all-pervadingly, like an
oil stain. If he had come to bear ill-will to Sakr-el-Bahr before,
that ill-will was turned of a sudden into positive hatred for one
in whom he now beheld a usurper of the power and control that
should reside in the Basha alone. Assuredly there was no room for
both of them in the Bashalik of Algiers.</p>

<p>Therefore the words of commendation which had been rising to his
lips froze there now that Sakr-el-Bahr and he stood face to face.
In silence he considered his lieutenant through narrowing evil
eyes, whose message none but a fool could have misunderstood.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr was not a fool, and he did not misunderstand it for
a moment. He felt a tightening at the heart, and ill-will sprang to
life within him responding to the call of that ill-will. Almost he
repented him that he had not availed himself of that moment of
weakness and mutiny on the part of the crew to attempt the entire
superseding of the Basha.</p>

<p>The conciliatory words he had in mind to speak he now
suppressed. To that venomous glance he opposed his ever ready
mockery. He turned to Biskaine.</p>

<p>"Withdraw," he curtly bade him, "and take that stout sea-warrior
with thee." And he indicated Marzak.</p>

<p>Biskaine turned to the Basha. "Is it thy wish, my lord?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Asad nodded in silence, and motioned him away together with the
cowed Marzak.</p>

<p>"My lord," said Sakr-el-Bahr, when they were alone, "yesterday I
made thee a proposal for the healing of this breach between us, and
it was refused. But now had I been the traitor and mutineer thou
hast dubbed me I could have taken full advantage of the humour of
my corsairs. Had I done that it need no longer have been mine to
propose or to sue. Instead it would have been mine to dictate.
Since I have given thee such crowning proof of my loyalty, it is my
hope and trust that I may be restored to the place I had lost in
thy confidence, and that this being so thou wilt accede now to that
proposal of mine concerning the Frankish woman yonder."</p>

<p>It was unfortunate perhaps that she should have been standing
there unveiled upon the poop within the range of Asad's glance; for
the sight of her it may have been that overcame his momentary
hesitation and stifled the caution which prompted him to accede. He
considered her a moment, and a faint colour kindled in his cheeks
which anger had made livid.</p>

<p>"It is not for thee, Sakr-el-Bahr," he answered at length, "to
make me proposals. To dare it, proves thee far removed indeed from
the loyalty thy lips profess. Thou knowest my will concerning her.
Once hast thou thwarted and defied me, misusing to that end the
Prophet's Holy Law. Continue a barrier in my path and it shall be
at thy peril." His voice was raised and it shook with anger.</p>

<p>"Not so loud," said Sakr-el-Bahr, his eyes gleaming with a
response of anger. "For should my men overhear these threats of
thine I will not answer for what may follow. I oppose thee at my
peril sayest thou. Be it so, then." He smiled grimly. "It is war
between us, Asad, since thou hast chosen it. Remember hereafter
when the consequences come to overwhelm thee that the choice was
thine."</p>

<p>"Thou mutinous, treacherous son of a dog!" blazed Asad.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr turned on his heel. "Pursue the path of an old
man's folly," he said over his shoulder, "and see whither it will
lead thee."</p>

<p>Upon that he strode away up the gangway to the poop, leaving the
Basha alone with his anger and some slight fear evoked by that last
bold menace. But notwithstanding that he menaced boldly the heart
of Sakr-el-Bahr was surcharged with anxiety. He had conceived a
plan; but between the conception and its execution he realized that
much ill might lie.</p>

<p>"Mistress," he addressed Rosamund as he stepped upon the poop.
"You are not wise to show yourself so openly."</p>

<p>To his amazement she met him with a hostile glance.</p>

<p>"Not wise?" said she, her countenance scornful. "You mean that I
may see more than was intended for me. What game do you play here,
sir, that you tell me one thing and show me by your actions that
you desire another?"</p>

<p>He did not need to ask her what she meant. At once he perceived
how she had misread the scene she had witnessed.</p>

<p>"I'll but remind you," he said very gravely, "that once before
you did me a wrong by over-hasty judgment, as has been proven to
you."</p>

<p>It overthrew some of her confidence. "But then..." she
began.</p>

<p>"I do but ask you to save your judgment for the end. If I live I
shall deliver you. Meanwhile I beg that you will keep your cabin.
It does not help me that you be seen."</p>

<p>She looked at him, a prayer for explanation trembling on her
lips. But before the calm command of his tone and glance she slowly
lowered her head and withdrew beyond the curtain.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2-20" id="ch2-20"></a>CHAPTER XX &mdash; THE
MESSENGER</h2>

<p>For the rest of the day she kept the cabin, chafing with anxiety
to know what was toward and the more racked by it because
Sakr-el-Bahr refrained through all those hours from coming to her.
At last towards evening, unable longer to contain herself, she went
forth again, and as it chanced she did so at an untimely
moment.</p>

<p>The sun had set, and the evening prayer was being recited aboard
the galeasse, her crew all prostrate. Perceiving this, she drew
back again instinctively, and remained screened by the curtain
until the prayer was ended. Then putting it aside, but without
stepping past the Nubians who were on guard, she saw that on her
left Asad-ed-Din, with Marzak, Biskaine, and one or two other
officers, was again occupying the divan under the awning. Her eyes
sought Sakr-el-Bahr, and presently they beheld him coming up the
gangway with his long, swinging stride, in the wake of the
boat-swain's mates who were doling out the meagre evening meal to
the slaves.</p>

<p>Suddenly he halted by Lionel, who occupied a seat at the head of
his oar immediately next to the gangway. He addressed him harshly
in the lingua franca, which Lionel did not understand, and his
words rang clearly and were heard&mdash;as he intended that they
should be&mdash;by all upon the poop.</p>

<p>"Well, dog? How does galley-slave fare suit thy tender
stomach?"</p>

<p>Lionel looked up at him.</p>

<p>"What are you saying?" he asked in English.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr bent over him, and his face as all could see was
evil and mocking. No doubt he spoke to him in English also, but no
more than a murmur reached the straining ears of Rosamund, though
from his countenance she had no doubt of the purport of his words.
And yet she was far indeed from a correct surmise. The mockery in
his countenance was but a mask.</p>

<p>"Take no heed of my looks," he was saying. "I desire them up
yonder to think that I abuse you. Look as a man would who were
being abused. Cringe or snarl, but listen. Do you remember once
when as lads we swam together from Penarrow to Trefusis Point?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" quoth Lionel, and the natural sullenness of
his mien was all that Sakr-el-Bahr could have desired.</p>

<p>"I am wondering whether you could still swim as far. If so you
might find a more appetizing supper awaiting you at the
end&mdash;aboard Sir John Killigrew's ship. You had not heard? The
Silver Heron is at anchor in the bay beyond that headland. If I
afford you the means, could you swim to her do you think?"</p>

<p>Lionel stared at him in profoundest amazement. "Do you mock me?"
he asked at length.</p>

<p>"Why should I mock you on such a matter?"</p>

<p>"Is it not to mock me to suggest a way for my deliverance?"</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr laughed, and he mocked now in earnest. He set his
left foot upon the rowers' stretcher, and leaned forward and down
his elbow upon his raised knee so that his face was close to
Lionel's.</p>

<p>"For your deliverance?" said he. "God's life! Lionel, your mind
was ever one that could take in naught but your own self. 'Tis that
has made a villain of you. Your deliverance! God's wounds! Is there
none but yourself whose deliverance I might desire? Look you, now I
want you to swim to Sir John's ship and bear him word of the
presence here of this galeasse and that Rosamund is aboard it. 'Tis
for her that I am concerned, and so little for you that should you
chance to be drowned in the attempt my only regret will be that the
message was not delivered. Will you undertake that swim? It is your
one sole chance short of death itself of escaping from the rower's
bench. Will you go?"</p>

<p>"But how?" demanded Lionel, still mistrusting him.</p>

<p>"Will you go?" his brother insisted.</p>

<p>"Afford me the means and I will," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Very well." Sakr-el-Bahr leaned nearer still. "Naturally it
will be supposed by all who are watching us that I am goading you
to desperation. Act, then, your part. Up, and attempt to strike me.
Then when I return the blow&mdash;and I shall strike heavily that
no make-believe may be suspected&mdash;collapse on your oar
pretending to swoon. Leave the rest to me. Now," he added sharply,
and on the word rose with a final laugh of derision as if to take
his departure.</p>

<p>But Lionel was quick to follow the instructions. He leapt up in
his bonds, and reaching out as far as they would permit him, he
struck Sakr-el-Bahr heavily upon the face. On his side, too, there
was to be no make-believe apparent. That done he sank down with a
clank of shackles to the bench again, whilst every one of his
fellow-slaves that faced his way looked on with fearful eyes.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr was seen to reel under the blow, and instantly
there was a commotion on board. Biskaine leapt to his feet with a
half-cry of astonishment; even Asad's eyes kindled with interest at
so unusual a sight as that of a galley-slave attacking a corsair.
Then with a snarl of anger, the snarl of an enraged beast almost,
Sakr-el-Bahr's great arm was swung aloft and his fist descended
like a hammer upon Lionel's head.</p>

<p>Lionel sank forward under the blow, his senses swimming.
Sakr-el-Bahr's arm swung up a second time.</p>

<p>"Thou dog!" he roared, and then checked, perceiving that Lionel
appeared to have swooned.</p>

<p>He turned and bellowed for Vigitello and his mates in a voice
that was hoarse with passion. Vigitello came at a run, a couple of
his men at his heels.</p>

<p>"Unshackle me this carrion, and heave it overboard," was the
harsh order. "Let that serve as an example to the others. Let them
learn thus the price of mutiny in their lousy ranks. To it, I
say."</p>

<p>Away sped a man for hammer and chisel. He returned with them at
once. Four sharp metallic blows rang out, and Lionel was dragged
forth from his place to the gangway-deck. Here he revived, and
screamed for mercy as though he were to be drowned in earnest.</p>

<p>Biskaine chuckled under the awning, Asad looked on approvingly,
Rosamund drew back, shuddering, choking, and near to fainting from
sheer horror.</p>

<p>She saw Lionel borne struggling in the arms of the boatswain's
men to the starboard quarter, and flung over the side with no more
compunction or care than had he been so much rubbish. She heard the
final scream of terror with which he vanished, the splash of his
fall, and then in the ensuing silence the laugh of
Sakr-el-Bahr.</p>

<p>For a spell she stood there with horror and loathing of that
renegade corsair in her soul. Her mind was bewildered and confused.
She sought to restore order in it, that she might consider this
fresh deed of his, this act of wanton brutality and fratricide. And
all that she could gather was the firm conviction that hitherto he
had cheated her; he had lied when he swore that his aim was to
effect her deliverance. It was not in such a nature to know a
gentle mood of penitence for a wrong done. What might be his
purpose she could not yet perceive, but that it was an evil one she
never doubted, for no purpose of his could be aught but evil. So
overwrought was she now that she forgot all Lionel's sins, and
found her heart filled with compassion for him hurled in that
brutal fashion to his death.</p>

<p>And then, quite suddenly a shout rang out from the
forecastle.</p>

<p>"He is swimming!"</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr had been prepared for the chance of this.</p>

<p>"Where? Where?" he cried, and sprang to the bulwarks.</p>

<p>"Yonder!" A man was pointing. Others had joined him and were
peering through the gathering gloom at the moving object that was
Lionel's head and the faintly visible swirl of water about it which
indicated that he swam.</p>

<p>"Out to sea!" cried Sakr-el-Bahr. "He'll not swim far in any
case. But we will shorten his road for him." He snatched a
cross-bow from the rack about the mainmast, fitted a shaft to it
and took aim.</p>

<p>On the point of loosing the bolt he paused.</p>

<p>"Marzak!" he called. "Here, thou prince of marksmen, is a butt
for thee!"</p>

<p>From the poop-deck whence with his father he too was watching
the swimmer's head, which at every moment became more faint in the
failing light, Marzak looked with cold disdain upon his challenger,
making no reply. A titter ran through the crew.</p>

<p>"Come now," cried Sakr-el-Bahr. "Take up thy bow!"</p>

<p>"If thou delay much longer," put in Asad, "he will be beyond
thine aim. Already he is scarcely visible."</p>

<p>"The more difficult a butt, then," answered Sakr-el-B ahr, who
was but delaying to gain time. "The keener test. A hundred philips,
Marzak, that thou'lt not hit me that head in three shots, and that
I'll sink him at the first! Wilt take the wager?"</p>

<p>"The unbeliever is for ever peeping forth from thee," was
Marzak's dignified reply. "Games of chance are forbidden by the
Prophet."</p>

<p>"Make haste, man!" cried Asad. "Already I can scarce discern
him. Loose thy quarrel."</p>

<p>"Pooh," was the disdainful answer. "A fair mark still for such
an eye as mine. I never miss&mdash;not even in the dark."</p>

<p>"Vain boaster," said Marzak.</p>

<p>"Am I so?" Sakr-el-Bahr loosed his shaft at last into the gloom,
and peered after it following its flight, which was wide of the
direction of the swimmer's head. "A hit!" he cried brazenly. "He's
gone!"</p>

<p>"I think I see him still," said one.</p>

<p>"Thine eyes deceive thee in this light. No man was ever known to
swim with an arrow through his brain."</p>

<p>"Ay," put in Jasper, who stood behind Sakr-el-Bahr. "He has
vanished."</p>

<p>"'Tis too dark to see," said Vigitello.</p>

<p>And then Asad turned from the vessel's side. "Well,
well&mdash;shot or drowned, he's gone," he said, and there the
matter ended.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr replaced the cross-bow in the rack, and came slowly
up to the poop.</p>

<p>In the gloom he found himself confronted by Rosamund's white
face between the two dusky countenances of his Nubians. She drew
back before him as he approached, and he, intent upon imparting his
news to her, followed her within the poop-house, and bade Abiad
bring lights.</p>

<p>When these had been kindled they faced each other, and he
perceived her profound agitation and guessed the cause of it.
Suddenly she broke into speech.</p>

<p>"You beast! You devil!" she panted. "God will punish you! I
shall spend my every breath in praying Him to punish you as you
deserve. You murderer! You hound! And I like a poor simpleton was
heeding your false words. I was believing you sincere in your
repentance of the wrong you have done me. But now you have shown
me..."</p>

<p>"How have I hurt you in what I have done to Lionel?" he cut in,
a little amazed by so much vehemence.</p>

<p>"Hurt me!" she cried, and on the words grew cold and calm again
with very scorn. "I thank God it is beyond your power to hurt me.
And I thank you for correcting my foolish misconception of you, my
belief in your pitiful pretence that it was your aim to save me. I
would not accept salvation at your murderer's hands. Though,
indeed, I shall not be put to it. Rather," she pursued, a little
wildly now in her deep mortification, "are you like to sacrifice me
to your own vile ends, whatever they may be. But I shall thwart
you, Heaven helping me. Be sure I shall not want courage for that."
And with a shuddering moan she covered her face, and stood swaying
there before him.</p>

<p>He looked on with a faint, bitter smile, uhderstanding her mood
just as he understood her dark threat of thwarting him.</p>

<p>"I came," he said quietly, "to bring you the assurance that he
has got safely away, and to tell you upon what manner of errand I
have sent him."</p>

<p>Something compelling in his voice, the easy assurance with which
he spoke, drew her to stare at him again.</p>

<p>"I mean Lionel, of course," he said, in answer to her
questioning glance. "That scene between us&mdash;the blow and the
swoon and the rest of it&mdash;was all make-believe. So afterwards
the shooting. My challenge to Marzak was a ruse to gain
time&mdash;to avoid shooting until Lionel's head should have become
so dimly visible in the dusk that none could say whether it was
still there or not. My shaft went wide of him, as I intended. He is
swimming round the head with my message to Sir John Killigrew. He
was a strong swimmer in the old days, and should easily reach his
goal. That is what I came to tell you."</p>

<p>For a long spell she continued to stare at him in silence.</p>

<p>"You are speaking the truth?" she asked at last, in a small
voice.</p>

<p>He shrugged. "You will have a difficulty in perceiving the
object I might serve by falsehood."</p>

<p>She sat down suddenly upon the divan; it was almost as if she
collapsed bereft of strength; and as suddenly she fell to weeping
softly.</p>

<p>"And...and I believed that you...that you..."</p>

<p>"Just so," he grimly interrupted. "You always did believe the
best of me."</p>

<p>And on that he turned and went out abruptly.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2-21" id="ch2-21"></a>CHAPTER XXI &mdash;
MORITURUS</h2>

<p>He departed from her presence with bitterness in his heart,
leaving a profound contrition in her own. The sense of this her
last injustice to him so overwhelmed her that it became the gauge
by which she measured that other earlier wrong he had suffered at
her hands. Perhaps her overwrought mind falsified the perspective,
exaggerating it until it seemed to her that all the suffering and
evil with which this chronicle has been concerned were the direct
fruits of her own sin of unfaith.</p>

<p>Since all sincere contrition must of necessity bring forth an
ardent desire to atone, so was it now with her. Had he but
refrained from departing so abruptly he might have had her on her
knees to him suing for pardon for all the wrongs which her thoughts
had done him, proclaiming her own utter unworthiness and baseness.
But since his righteous resentment had driven him from her presence
she could but sit and brood upon it all, considering the words in
which to frame her plea for forgiveness when next he should
return.</p>

<p>But the hours sped, and there was no sign of him. And then,
almost with a shock of dread came the thought that ere long perhaps
Sir John Killigrew's ship would be upon them. In her distraught
state of mind she had scarcely pondered that contingency. Now that
it occurred to her all her concern was for the result of it to Sir
Oliver. Would there be fighting, and would he perhaps perish in
that conflict at the hands either of the English or of the corsairs
whom for her sake he had betrayed, perhaps without ever hearing her
confession of penitence, without speaking those words of
forgiveness of which her soul stood in such thirsty need?</p>

<p>It would be towards midnight when unable longer to bear the
suspense of it, she rose and softly made her way to the entrance.
Very quietly she lifted the curtain, and in the act of stepping
forth almost stumbled over a body that lay across the threshold.
She drew back with a startled gasp; then stooped to look, and by
the faint rays of the lanterns on mainmast and poop-rail she
recognized Sir Oliver, and saw that he slept. She never heeded the
two Nubians immovable as statues who kept guard. She continued to
bend over him, and then gradually and very softly sank down on her
knees beside him. There were tears in her eyes&mdash;tears wrung
from her by a tender emotion of wonder and gratitude at so much
fidelity. She did not know that he had slept thus last night. But
it was enough for her to find him here now. It moved her oddly,
profoundly, that this man whom she had ever mistrusted and
misjudged should even when he slept make of his body a barrier for
her greater security and protection.</p>

<p>A sob escaped her, and at the sound, so lightly and vigilantly
did he take his rest, he came instantly if silently to a sitting
attitude; and so they looked into each other's eyes, his swarthy,
bearded hawk face on a level with her white gleaming
countenance.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he whispered.</p>

<p>She drew back instantly, taken with sudden panic at that
question. Then recovering, and seeking womanlike to evade and
dissemble the thing she was come to do, now that the chance of
doing it was afforded her&mdash;"Do you think," she faltered, "that
Lionel will have reached Sir John's ship?"</p>

<p>He flashed a glance in the direction of the divan under the
awning where the Basha slept. There all was still. Besides, the
question had been asked in English. He rose and held out a hand to
help her to her feet. Then he signed to her to reenter the
poop-house, and followed her within.</p>

<p>"Anxiety keeps you wakeful?" he said, half-question,
half-assertion.</p>

<p>"Indeed," she replied.</p>

<p>"There is scarce the need," he assured her. "Sir John will not
be like to stir until dead of night, that he may make sure of
taking us unawares. I have little doubt that Lionel would reach
him. It is none so long a swim. Indeed, once outside the cove he
could take to the land until he was abreast of the ship. Never
doubt he will have done his errand."</p>

<p>She sat down, her glance avoiding his; but the light falling on
her face showed him the traces there of recent tears.</p>

<p>"There will be fighting when Sir John arrives?" she asked him
presently.</p>

<p>"Like enough. But what can it avail? We shall be caught&mdash;as
was said to-day&mdash;in just such a trap as that in which Andrea
Doria caught Dragut at Jerba, saving that whilst the wily Dragut
found a way out for his galleys, here none is possible. Courage,
then, for the hour of your deliverance is surely at hand."</p>

<p>He paused, and then in a softer voice, humbly almost, "It is my
prayer," he added, "that hereafter in a happy future these last few
weeks shall come to seem no more than an evil dream to you."</p>

<p>To that prayer she offered no response. She sat bemused, her
brow wrinkled.</p>

<p>"I would it might be done without fighting," she said presently,
and sighed wearily.</p>

<p>"You need have no fear," he assured her. "I shall take all
precautions for you. You shall remain here until all is over and
the entrance will be guarded by a few whom I can trust."</p>

<p>"You mistake me," she replied, and looked up at him suddenly.
"Do you suppose my fears are for myself?" She paused again, and
then abruptly asked him, "What will befall you?"</p>

<p>"I thank you for the thought," he replied gravely. "No doubt I
shall meet with my deserts. Let it but come swiftly when it
comes."</p>

<p>"Ah, no, no!" she cried. "Not that!" And rose in her sudden
agitation.</p>

<p>"What else remains?" he asked, and smiled. "What better fate
could anyone desire me?"</p>

<p>"You shall live to return to England," she surprised him by
exclaiming. "The truth must prevail, and justice be done you."</p>

<p>He looked at her with so fierce and searching a gaze that she
averted her eyes. Then he laughed shortly.</p>

<p>"There's but one form of justice I can look for in England,"
said he. "It is a justice administered in hemp. Believe me,
mistress, I am grown too notorious for mercy. Best end it here
to-night. Besides," he added, and his mockery fell from him, his
tone became gloomy, "bethink you of my present act of treachery to
these men of mine, who, whatever they may be, have followed me into
a score of perils and but to-day have shown their love and loyalty
to me to be greater than their devotion to the Basha himself. I
shall have delivered them to the sword. Could I survive with
honour? They may be but poor heathens to you and yours, but to me
they are my sea-hawks, my warriors, my faithful gallant followers,
and I were a dog indeed did I survive the death to which I have
doomed them."</p>

<p>As she listened and gathered from his words the apprehension of
a thing that had hitherto escaped her, her eyes grew wide in sudden
horror.</p>

<p>"Is that to be the cost of my deliverance?" she asked him
fearfully.</p>

<p>"I trust not," he replied. "I have something in mind that will
perhaps avoid it."</p>

<p>"And save your own life as well?" she asked him quickly.</p>

<p>"Why waste a thought upon so poor a thing? My life was forfeit
already. If I go back to Algiers they will assuredly hang me. Asad
will see to it, and not all my sea-hawks could save me from my
fate."</p>

<p>She sank down again upon the divan, and sat there rocking her
arms in a gesture of hopeless distress.</p>

<p>"I see," she said. "I see. I am bringing this fate upon you.
When you sent Lionel upon that errand you voluntarily offered up
your life to restore me to my own people. You had no right to do
this without first consulting me. You had no right to suppose I
would be a party to such a thing. I will not accept the sacrifice.
I will not, Sir Oliver."</p>

<p>"Indeed, you have no choice, thank God!" he answered her. "But
you are astray in your conclusions. It is I alone who have brought
this fate upon myself. It is the very proper fruit of my insensate
deed. It recoils upon me as all evil must upon him that does it."
He shrugged his shoulders as if to dismiss the matter. Then in a
changed voice, a voice singularly timid, soft, and gentle, "It were
perhaps too much to ask," said he, "that you should forgive me all
the suffering I have brought you?"</p>

<p>"I think," she answered him, "that it is for me to beg
forgiveness of you."</p>

<p>"Of me?"</p>

<p>"For my unfaith, which has been the source of all. For my
readiness to believe evil of you five years ago, for having burnt
unread your letter and the proof of your innocence that accompanied
it."</p>

<p>He smiled upon her very kindly. "I think you said your instinct
guided you. Even though I had not done the thing imputed to me,
your instinct knew me for evil; and your instinct was right, for
evil I am&mdash;I must be. These are your own words. But do not
think that I mock you with them. I have come to recognize their
truth."</p>

<p>She stretched out her hands to him. "If...if I were to say that
I have come to realize the falsehood of all that?"</p>

<p>"I should understand it to be the charity which your pitiful
heart extends to one in my extremity. Your instinct was not at
fault."</p>

<p>"It was! It was!"</p>

<p>But he was not to be driven out of his conviction. He shook his
head, his countenance gloomy. "No man who was not evil could have
done by you what I have done, however deep the provocation. I
perceive it clearly now&mdash;as men in their last hour perceive
hidden things."</p>

<p>"Oh, why are you so set on death?" she cried upon a despairing
note.</p>

<p>"I am not," he answered with a swift resumption of his more
habitual manner. "'Tis death that is so set on me. But at least I
meet it without fear or regret. I face it as we must all face the
inevitable&mdash;the gifts from the hands of destiny. And I am
heartened&mdash;gladdened almost&mdash;by your sweet
forgiveness."</p>

<p>She rose suddenly, and came to him. She caught his arm, and
standing very close to him, looked up now into his face.</p>

<p>"We have need to forgive each other, you and I, Oliver," she
said. "And since forgiveness effaces all, let...let all that has
stood between us these last five years be now effaced."</p>

<p>He caught his breath as he looked down into her white, straining
face</p>

<p>"Is it impossible for us to go back five years? Is it impossible
for us to go back to where we stood in those old days at Godolphin
Court?"</p>

<p>The light that had suddenly been kindled in his face faded
slowly, leaving it grey and drawn. His eyes grew clouded with
sorrow and despair.</p>

<p>"Who has erred must abide by his error&mdash;and so must the
generations that come after him. There is no going back ever. The
gates of the past are tight-barred against us."</p>

<p>"Then let us leave them so. Let us turn our backs upon that
past, you and I, and let us set out afresh together, and so make
amends to each other for what our folly has lost to us in those
years."</p>

<p>He set his hands upon her shoulders, and held her so at arm's
length from him considering her with very tender eyes.</p>

<p>"Sweet lady!" he murmured, and sighed heavily. "God! How happy
might we not have been but for that evil chance..." He checked
abruptly. His hands fell from her shoulders to his sides, he
half-turned away, brusque now in tone and manner. "I grow maudlin.
Your sweet pity has so softened me that I had almost spoke of love;
and what have I to do with that? Love belongs to life; love is
life; whilst I... Moriturus te salutat!"</p>

<p>"Ah, no, no!" She was clinging to him again with shaking hands,
her eyes wild.</p>

<p>"It is too late," he answered her. "There is no bridge can span
the pit I have dug myself. I must go down into it as cheerfully as
God will let me."</p>

<p>"Then," she cried in sudden exaltation, "I will go down with
you. At the last, at least, we shall be together."</p>

<p>"Now here is midsummer frenzy!" he protested, yet there was a
tenderness in the very impatience of his accents. He stroked the
golden head that lay against his shoulder. "How shall that help
me?" he asked her. "Would you embitter my last hour&mdash;rob death
of all its glory? Nay, Rosamund, you can serve me better far by
living. Return to England, and publish there the truth of what you
have learnt. Be yours the task of clearing my honour of this stain
upon it, proclaiming the truth of what drove me to the infamy of
becoming a renegade and a corsair." He started from her. "Hark!
What's that?"</p>

<p>From without had come a sudden cry, "Afoot! To arms! To arms!
Hol! Balk! Balk!"</p>

<p>"It is the hour," he said, and turning from her suddenly sprang
to the entrance and plucked aside the curtain.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2-22" id="ch2-22"></a>CHAPTER XXII &mdash; THE
SURRENDER</h2>

<p>Up the gangway between the lines of slumbering slaves came a
quick patter of feet. Ali, who since sunset had been replacing
Larocque on the heights, sprang suddenly upon the poop still
shouting.</p>

<p>"Captain! Captain! My lord! Afoot! Up! or we are taken!"</p>

<p>Throughout the vessel's length came the rustle and stir of
waking men. A voice clamoured somewhere on the forecastle. Then the
flap of the awning was suddenly whisked aside and Asad himself
appeared with Marzak at his elbow.</p>

<p>From the starboard side as suddenly came Biskaine and Othmani,
and from the waist Vigitello, Jasper&mdash;that latest
renegade&mdash;and a group of alarmed corsairs.</p>

<p>"What now?" quoth the Basha.</p>

<p>Ali delivered his message breathlessly. "The galleon has weighed
anchor. She is moving out of the bay."</p>

<p>Asad clutched his beard, and scowled. "Now what may that
portend? Can knowledge of our presence have reached them?"</p>

<p>"Why else should she move from her anchorage thus in the dead of
night?" said Biskaine.</p>

<p>"Why else, indeed?" returned Asad, and then he swung upon Oliver
standing there in the entrance of the poop-house. "What sayest
thou, Sakr-el-Bahr?" he appealed to him.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr stepped forward, shrugging. "What is there to say?
What is there to do?" he asked. "We can but wait. If our presence
is known to them we are finely trapped, and there's an end to all
of us this night."</p>

<p>His voice was cool as ice, contemptuous almost, and whilst it
struck anxiety into more than one it awoke terror in Marzak.</p>

<p>"May thy bones rot, thou ill-omened prophet!" he screamed, and
would have added more but that Sakr-el-Bahr silenced him.</p>

<p>"What is written is written!" said he in a voice of thunder and
reproof.</p>

<p>"Indeed, indeed," Asad agreed, grasping at the fatalist's
consolation. "If we are ripe for the gardener's hand, the gardener
will pluck us."</p>

<p>Less fatalistic and more practical was the counsel of
Biskaine.</p>

<p>"It were well to act upon the assumption that we are indeed
discovered, and make for the open sea while yet there may be
time."</p>

<p>"But that were to make certain what is still doubtful," broke in
Marzak, fearful ever. "It were to run to meet the danger."</p>

<p>"Not so!" cried Asad in a loud, confident voice. "The praise to
Allah who sent us this calm night. There is scarce a breath of
wind. We can row ten leagues while they are sailing one."</p>

<p>A murmur of quick approval sped through the ranks of officers
and men.</p>

<p>"Let us but win safely from this cove and they will never
overtake us," announced Biskaine.</p>

<p>"But their guns may," Sakr-el-Bahr quietly reminded them to damp
their confidence. His own alert mind had already foreseen this one
chance of escaping from the trap, but he had hoped that it would
not be quite so obvious to the others.</p>

<p>"That risk we must take," replied Asad. "We must trust to the
night. To linger here is to await certain destruction." He swung
briskly about to issue his orders. "Ali, summon the steersmen.
Hasten! Vigitello, set your whips about the slaves, and rouse
them." Then as the shrill whistle of the boatswain rang out and the
whips of his mates went hissing and cracking about the shoulders of
the already half-awakened slaves, to mingle with all the rest of
the stir and bustle aboard the galeasse, the Basha turned once more
to Biskaine. "Up thou to the prow," he commanded, "and marshal the
men. Bid them stand to their arms lest it should come to boarding.
Go!" Biskaine salaamed and sprang down the companion. Above the
rumbling din and scurrying toil of preparation rang Asad's
voice.</p>

<p>"Crossbowmen, aloft! Gunners to the carronades! Kindle your
linstocks! Put out all lights!"</p>

<p>An instant later the cressets on the poop-rail were
extinguished, as was the lantern swinging from the rail, and even
the lamp in the poop-house which was invaded by one of the Basha's
officers for that purpose. The lantern hanging from the mast alone
was spared against emergencies; but it was taken down, placed upon
the deck, and muffled.</p>

<p>Thus was the galeasse plunged into a darkness that for some
moments was black and impenetrable as velvet. Then slowly, as the
eyes became accustomed to it, this gloom was gradually relieved.
Once more men and objects began to take shape in the faint, steely
radiance of the summer night.</p>

<p>After the excitement of that first stir the corsairs went about
their tasks with amazing calm and silence. None thought now of
reproaching the Basha or Sakr-el-Bahr with having delayed until the
moment of peril to take the course which all of them had demanded
should be taken when first they had heard of the neighbourhood of
that hostile ship. In lines three deep they stood ranged along the
ample fighting platform of the prow; in the foremost line were the
archers, behind them stood the swordsmen, their weapons gleaming
lividly in the darkness. They crowded to the bulwarks of the
waist-deck and swarmed upon the rat-lines of the mainmast. On the
poop three gunners stood to each of the two small cannon, their
faces showing faintly ruddy in the glow of the ignited match.</p>

<p>Asad stood at the head of the companion, issuing his sharp brief
commands, and Sakr-el-Bahr, behind him, leaning against the timbers
of the poop-house with Rosamund at his side, observed that the
Basha had studiously avoided entrusting any of this work of
preparation to himself.</p>

<p>The steersmen climbed to their niches, and the huge steering
oars creaked as they were swung out. Came a short word of command
from Asad and a stir ran through the ranks of the slaves, as they
threw forward their weight to bring the oars to the level. Thus a
moment, then a second word, the premonitory crack of a whip in the
darkness of the gangway, and the tomtom began to beat the time. The
slaves heaved, and with a creak and splash of oars the great
galeasse skimmed forward towards the mouth of the cove.</p>

<p>Up and down the gangway ran the boatswain's mates, cutting
fiercely with their whips to urge the slaves to the very utmost
effort. The vessel gathered speed. The looming headland slipped by.
The mouth of the cove appeared to widen as they approached it.
Beyond spread the dark steely mirror of the dead-calm sea.</p>

<p>Rosamund could scarcely breathe in the intensity of her
suspense. She set a hand upon the arm of Sakr-el-Bahr.</p>

<p>"Shall we elude them, after all?" she asked in a trembling
whisper.</p>

<p>"I pray that we may not," he answered, muttering. "But this is
the handiwork I feared. Look!" he added sharply, and pointed.</p>

<p>They had shot clear to the headland. They were out of the cove,
and suddenly they had a view of the dark bulk of the galleon,
studded with a score of points of light, riding a cable's length
away on their larboard quarter.</p>

<p>"Faster!" cried the voice of Asad. "Row for your lives, you
infidel swine! Lay me your whips upon these hides of theirs! Bend
me these dogs to their oars, and they'll never overtake us
now."</p>

<p>Whips sang and thudded below them in the waist, to be answered
by more than one groan from the tormented panting slaves, who
already were spending every ounce of strength in this cruel effort
to elude their own chance of salvation and release. Faster beat the
tomtom marking the desperate time, and faster in response to it
came the creak and dip of oars and the panting, stertorous
breathing of the rowers.</p>

<p>"Lay on! Lay on!" cried Asad, inexorable. Let them burst their
lungs&mdash;they were but infidel lungs!&mdash;so that for an hour
they but maintained the present pace.</p>

<p>"We are drawing away!" cried Marzak in jubilation. "The praise
to Allah!"</p>

<p>And so indeed they were. Visibly the lights of the galleon were
receding. With every inch of canvas spread yet she appeared to be
standing still, so faint was the breeze that stirred. And whilst
she crawled, the galeasse raced as never yet she had raced since
Sakr-el-Bahr had commanded her, for Sakr-el-Bahr had never yet
turned tail upon the foe in whatever strength he found him.</p>

<p>Suddenly over the water from the galleon came a loud hail. Asad
laughed, and in the darkness shook his fist at them, cursing them
in the name of Allah and his Prophet. And then, in answer to that
curse of his, the galleon's side belched fire; the calm of the
night was broken by a roar of thunder, and something smote the
water ahead of the Muslim vessel with a resounding thudding
splash.</p>

<p>In fear Rosamund drew closer to Sakr-el-Bahr. But Asad laughed
again.</p>

<p>"No need to fear their marksmanship," he cried. "They cannot see
us. Their own lights dazzle them. On! On!"</p>

<p>"He is right," said Sakr-el-Bahr. "But the truth is that they
will not fire to sink us because they know you to be aboard."</p>

<p>She looked out to sea again, and beheld those friendly lights
falling farther and farther astern.</p>

<p>"We are drawing steadily away," she groaned. "They will never
overtake us now."</p>

<p>So feared Sakr-el-Bahr. He more than feared it. He knew that
save for some miraculous rising of the wind it must be as she said.
And then out of his despair leapt inspiration&mdash;a desperate
inspiration, true child of that despair of which it was
begotten.</p>

<p>"There is a chance," he said to her. "But it is as a throw of
the dice with life and death for stakes."</p>

<p>"Then seize it," she bade him instantly. "For though it should
go against us we shall not be losers."</p>

<p>"You are prepared for anything?" he asked her.</p>

<p>"Have I not said that I will go down with you this night? Ah,
don't waste time in words!"</p>

<p>"Be it so, then," he replied gravely, and moved away a step,
then checked. "You had best come with me," he said.</p>

<p>Obediently she complied and followed him, and some there were
who stared as these two passed down the gangway, yet none attempted
to hinder her movements. Enough and to spare was there already to
engage the thoughts of all aboard that vessel.</p>

<p>He thrust a way for her, past the boatswain's mates who stood
over the slaves ferociously plying tongues and whips, and so
brought her to the waist. Here he took up the lantern which had
been muffled, and as its light once more streamed forth, Asad
shouted an order for its extinction. But Sakr-el-Bahr took no least
heed of that command. He stepped to the mainmast, about which the
powder kegs had been stacked. One of these had been broached
against its being needed by the gunners on the poop. The unfastened
lid rested loosely atop of it. That lid Sakr-el-Bahr knocked over;
then he pulled one of the horn sides out of the lantern, and held
the now half-naked flame immediately above the powder.</p>

<p>A cry of alarm went up from some who had watched him. But above
that cry rang his sharp command:</p>

<p>"Cease rowing!"</p>

<p>The tomtom fell instantly silent, but the slaves took yet
another stroke.</p>

<p>"Cease rowing!" he commanded again. "Asad!" he called. "Bid them
pause, or I'll blow you all straight into the arms of Shaitan." And
he lowered the lantern until it rested on the very rim of the
powder keg.</p>

<p>At once the rowing ceased. Slaves, corsairs, officers, and Asad
himself stood paralyzed, all at gaze upon that grim figure
illumined by the lantern, threatening them with doom. It may have
crossed the minds of some to throw themselves forthwith upon him;
but to arrest them was the dread lest any movement towards him
should precipitate the explosion that must blow them all into the
next world.</p>

<p>At last Asad addressed him, his voice half-choked with rage.</p>

<p>"May Allah strike thee dead! Art thou djinn-possessed?"</p>

<p>Marzak, standing at his father's side, set a quarrel to the bow
which he had snatched up. "Why do you all stand and stare?" he
cried. "Cut him down, one of you!" And even as he spoke he raised
his bow. But his father checked him, perceiving what must be the
inevitable result.</p>

<p>"If any man takes a step towards me, the lantern goes straight
into the gunpowder," said Sakr-el-Bahr serenely. "And if you shoot
me as you intend, Marzak, or if any other shoots, the same will
happen of itself. Be warned unless you thirst for the Paradise of
the Prophet."</p>

<p>"Sakr-el-Bahr!" cried Asad, and from its erstwhile anger his
voice had now changed to a note of intercession. He stretched out
his arms appealingly to the captain whose doom he had already
pronounced in his heart and mind. "Sakr-el-Bahr, I conjure thee by
the bread and salt we have eaten together, return to thy senses, my
son."</p>

<p>"I am in my sense," was the answer, "and being so I have no mind
for the fate reserved me in Algiers&mdash;by the memory of that
same bread and salt. I have no mind to go back with thee to be
hanged or sent to toil at an oar again."</p>

<p>"And if I swear to thee that naught of this shall come to
pass?"</p>

<p>"Thou'lt be forsworn. I would not trust thee now, Asad. For thou
art proven a fool, and in all my life I never found good in a fool
and never trusted one&mdash;save once, and he betrayed me.
Yesterday I pleaded with thee, showing thee the wise course, and
affording thee thine opportunity. At a slight sacrifice thou
mightest have had me and hanged me at thy leisure. 'Twas my own
life I offered thee, and for all that thou knewest it, yet thou
knewest not that I knew." He laughed. "See now what manner of fool
art thou? Thy greed hath wrought thy ruin. Thy hands were opened to
grasp more than they could hold. See now the consequence. It comes
yonder in that slowly but surely approaching galleon."</p>

<p>Every word of it sank into the brain of Asad thus tardily to
enlighten him. He wrung his hands in his blended fury and despair.
The crew stood in appalled silence, daring to make no movement that
might precipitate their end.</p>

<p>"Name thine own price," cried the Basha at length, "and I swear
to thee by the beard of the Prophet it shall be paid thee."</p>

<p>"I named it yesterday, but it was refused. I offered thee my
liberty and my life if that were needed to gain the liberty of
another."</p>

<p>Had he looked behind him he might have seen the sudden lighting
of Rosamund's eyes, the sudden clutch at her bosom, which would
have announced to him that his utterances were none so cryptic but
that she had understood them.</p>

<p>"I will make thee rich and honoured, Sakr-el-Bahr," Asad
continued urgently. "Thou shalt be as mine own son. The Bashalik
itself shall be thine when I lay it down, and all men shall do thee
honour in the meanwhile as to myself."</p>

<p>"I am not to be bought, O mighty Asad. I never was. Already wert
thou set upon my death. Thou canst command it now, but only upon
the condition that thou share the cup with me. What is written is
written. We have sunk some tall ships together in our day, Asad.
We'll sink together in our turn to-night if that be thy
desire."</p>

<p>"May thou burn for evermore in hell, thou black-hearted
traitor!" Asad cursed him, his anger bursting all the bonds he had
imposed upon it.</p>

<p>And then, of a sudden, upon that admission of defeat from their
Basha, there arose a great clamour from the crew. Sakr-el-Bahr's
sea-hawks called upon him, reminding him of their fidelity and
love, and asking could he repay it now by dooming them all thus to
destruction.</p>

<p>"Have faith in me!" he answered them. "I have never led you into
aught but victory. Be sure that I shall not lead you now into
defeat&mdash;on this the last occasion that we stand together."</p>

<p>"But the galleon is upon us!" cried Vigitello. And so, indeed,
it was, creeping up slowly under that faint breeze, her tall bulk
loomed now above them, her prow ploughing slowly forward at an
acute angle to the prow of the galeasse. Another moment and she was
alongside, and with a swing and clank and a yell of victory from
the English seamen lining her bulwarks her grappling irons swung
down to seize the corsair ship at prow and stern and waist. Scarce
had they fastened, than a torrent of men in breast-plates and
morions poured over her side, to alight upon the prow of the
galeasse, and not even the fear of the lantern held above the
powder barrel could now restrain the corsairs from giving these
hardy boarders the reception they reserved for all infidels. In an
instant the fighting platform on the prow was become a raging,
seething hell of battle luridly illumined by the ruddy glow from
the lights aboard the Silver Heron. Foremost among those who had
leapt down had been Lionel and Sir John Killigrew. Foremost among
those to receive them had been Jasper Leigh, who had passed his
sword through Lionel's body even as Lionel's feet came to rest upon
the deck, and before the battle was joined.</p>

<p>A dozen others went down on either side before Sakr-el-Bahr's
ringing voice could quell the fighting, before his command to them
to hear him was obeyed.</p>

<p>"Hold there!" he had bellowed to his sea-hawks, using the lingua
franca. "Back, and leave this to me. I will rid you of these foes."
Then in English he had summoned his countrymen also to desist. "Sir
John Killigrew!" he called in a loud voice. "Hold your hand until
you have heard me! Call your men back and let none others come
aboard! Hold until you have heard me, I say, then wreak your
will."</p>

<p>Sir John, perceiving him by the mainmast with Rosamund at his
side, and leaping at the most inevitable conclusion that he meant
to threaten her life, perhaps to destroy her if they continued
their advance, flung himself before his men, to check them.</p>

<p>Thus almost as suddenly as it had been joined the combat
paused.</p>

<p>"What have you to say, you renegade dog?" Sir John demanded.</p>

<p>"This, Sir John, that unless you order your men back aboard your
ship, and make oath to desist from this encounter, I'll take you
straight down to hell with us at once. I'll heave this lantern into
the powder here, and we sink and you come down with us held by your
own grappling hooks. Obey me and you shall have all that you have
come to seek aboard this vessel. Mistress Rosamund shall be
delivered up to you."</p>

<p>Sir John glowered upon him a moment from the poop, considering.
Then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Though not prepared to make terms with you," he announced, "yet
I will accept the conditions you impose, but only provided that I
have all indeed that I am come to seek. There is aboard this galley
an infamous renegade hound whom I am bound by my knightly oath to
take and hang. He, too, must be delivered up to me. His name was
Oliver Tressilian."</p>

<p>Instantly, unhesitatingly, came the answer&mdash;"Him, too, will
I surrender to you upon your sworn oath that you will then depart
and do here no further hurt."</p>

<p>Rosamund caught her breath, and clutched Sakr-el-Bahr's arm, the
arm that held the lantern.</p>

<p>"Have a care, mistress," he bade her sharply, "or you will
destroy us all."</p>

<p>"Better that!" she answered him.</p>

<p>And then Sir John pledged him his word that upon his own
surrender and that of Rosamund he would withdraw nor offer hurt to
any there.</p>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr turned to his waiting corsairs, and briefly told
them what the terms he had made.</p>

<p>He called upon Asad to pledge his word that these terms would be
respected, and no blood shed on his behalf, and Asad answered him,
voicing the anger of all against him for his betrayal.</p>

<p>"Since he wants thee that he may hang thee, he may have thee and
so spare us the trouble, for 'tis no less than thy treachery
deserves from us."</p>

<p>"Thus, then, I surrender," he announced to Sir John, and flung
the lantern overboard.</p>

<p>One voice only was raised in his defence, and that voice was
Rosamund's. But even that voice failed, conquered by weary nature.
This last blow following upon all that lately she had endured
bereft her of all strength. Half swooning she collapsed against
Sakr-el-Bahr even as Sir John and a handful of his followers leapt
down to deliver her and make fast their prisoner.</p>

<p>The corsairs stood looking on in silence; the loyalty to their
great captain, which would have made them spend their last drop of
blood in his defence, was quenched by his own act of treachery
which had brought the English ship upon them. Yet when they saw him
pinioned and hoisted to the deck of the Silver Heron, there was a
sudden momentary reaction in their ranks. Scimitars were waved
aloft, and cries of menace burst forth. If he had betrayed them,
yet he had so contrived that they should not suffer by that
betrayal. And that was worthy of the Sakr-el-Bahr they knew and
loved; so worthy that their love and loyalty leapt full-armed again
upon the instant.</p>

<p>But the voice of Asad called upon them to bear in mind what in
their name he had promised, and since the voice of Asad alone might
not have sufficed to quell that sudden spark of revolt, there came
down to them the voice of Sakr-el-Bahr himself issuing his last
command.</p>

<p>"Remember and respect the terms I have made for you! Mektub! May
Allah guard and prosper you!"</p>

<p>A wail was his reply, and with that wail ringing in his ears to
assure him that he did not pass unloved, he was hurried below to
prepare him for his end.</p>

<p>The ropes of the grapnels were cut, and slowly the galleon
passed away into the night, leaving the galley to replace what
slaves had been maimed in the encounter and to head back for
Algiers, abandoning the expedition against the argosy of Spain.</p>

<p>Under the awning upon the poop Asad now sat like a man who has
awakened from an evil dream. He covered his head and wept for one
who had been as a son to him, and whom through his madness he had
lost. He cursed all women, and he cursed destiny; but the bitterest
curse of all was for himself.</p>

<p>In the pale dawn they flung the dead overboard and washed the
decks, nor did they notice that a man was missing in token that the
English captain, or else his followers, had not kept strictly to
the letter of the bond.</p>

<p>They returned in mourning to Algiers&mdash;mourning not for the
Spanish argosy which had been allowed to go her ways unmolested,
but for the stoutest captain that ever bared his scimitar in the
service of Islam. The story of how he came to be delivered up was
never clearly told; none dared clearly tell it, for none who had
participated in the deed but took shame in it thereafter, however
clear it might be that Sakr-el-Bahr had brought it all upon
himself. But, at least, it was understood that he had not fallen in
battle, and hence it was assumed that he was still alive. Upon that
presumption there was built up a sort of legend that he would one
day come back; and redeemed captives returning a half-century later
related how in Algiers to that day the coming of Sakr-el-Bahr was
still confidently expected and looked for by all true
Muslimeen.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2-23" id="ch2-23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII &mdash; THE
HEATHEN CREED</h2>

<p>Sakr-el-Bahr was shut up in a black hole in the forecastle of
the Silver Heron to await the dawn and to spend the time in making
his soul. No words had passed between him and Sir John since his
surrender. With wrists pinioned behind him, he had been hoisted
aboard the English ship, and in the waist of her he had stood for a
moment face to face with an old acquaintance&mdash;our chronicler,
Lord Henry Goade. I imagine the florid countenance of the Queen's
Lieutenant wearing a preternaturally grave expression, his eyes
forbidding as they rested upon the renegade. I know&mdash;from Lord
Henry's own pen&mdash;that no word had passed between them during
those brief moments before Sakr-el-Bahr was hurried away by his
guards to be flung into those dark, cramped quarters reeking of tar
and bilge.</p>

<p>For a long hour he lay where he had fallen, believing himself
alone; and time and place would no doubt conduce to philosophical
reflection upon his condition. I like to think that he found that
when all was considered, he had little with which to reproach
himself. If he had done evil he had made ample amends. It can
scarcely be pretended that he had betrayed those loyal Muslimeen
followers of his, or, if it is, at least it must be added that he
himself had paid the price of that betrayal. Rosamund was safe,
Lionel would meet the justice due to him, and as for himself, being
as good as dead already, he was worth little thought. He must have
derived some measure of content from the reflection that he was
spending his life to the very best advantage. Ruined it had been
long since. True, but for his ill-starred expedition of vengeance
he might long have continued to wage war as a corsair, might even
have risen to the proud Muslim eminence of the Bashalik of Algiers
and become a feudatory prince of the Grand Turk. But for one who
was born a Christian gentleman that would have been an unworthy way
to have ended his days. The present was the better course.</p>

<p>A faint rustle in the impenetrable blackness of his prison
turned the current of his thoughts. A rat, he thought, and drew
himself to a sitting attitude, and beat his slippered heels upon
the ground to drive away the loathly creature. Instead, a voice
challenged him out of the gloom.</p>

<p>"Who's there?"</p>

<p>It startled him for a moment, in his complete assurance that he
had been alone.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" the voice repeated, querulously to add: "What
black hell be this? Where am I?"</p>

<p>And now he recognized the voice for Jasper Leigh's, and
marvelled how that latest of his recruits to the ranks of Mohammed
should be sharing this prison with him.</p>

<p>"Faith," said he, "you're in the forecastle of the Silver Heron;
though how you come here is more than I can answer."</p>

<p>"Who are ye?" the voice asked.</p>

<p>"I have been known in Barbary as Sakr-el-Bahr."</p>

<p>"Sir Oliver!"</p>

<p>"I suppose that is what they will call me now. It is as well
perhaps that I am to be buried at sea, else it might plague these
Christian gentlemen what legend to inscribe upon my headstone. But
you&mdash;how come you hither? My bargain with Sir John was that
none should be molested, and I cannot think Sir John would be
forsworn."</p>

<p>"As to that I know nothing, since I did not even know where I
was bestowed until ye informed me. I was knocked senseless in the
fight, after I had put my bilbo through your comely brother. That
is the sum of my knowledge."</p>

<p>Sir Oliver caught his breath. "What do you say? You killed
Lionel?"</p>

<p>"I believe so," was the cool answer. "At least I sent a couple
of feet of steel through him&mdash;'twas in the press of the fight
when first the English dropped aboard the galley; Master Lionel was
in the van&mdash;the last place in which I should have looked to
see him."</p>

<p>There fell a long silence. At length Sir Oliver spoke in a small
voice.</p>

<p>"Not a doubt but you gave him no more than he was seeking. You
are right, Master Leigh; the van was the last place in which to
look for him, unless he came deliberately to seek steel that he
might escape a rope. Best so, no doubt. Best so! God rest him!"</p>

<p>"Do you believe in God?" asked the sinful skipper on an anxious
note.</p>

<p>"No doubt they took you because of that," Sir Oliver pursued, as
if communing with himself. "Being in ignorance perhaps of his
deserts, deeming him a saint and martyr, they resolved to avenge
him upon you, and dragged you hither for that purpose." He sighed.
"Well, well, Master Leigh, I make no doubt that knowing yourself
for a rascal you have all your life been preparing your neck for a
noose; so this will come as no surprise to you."</p>

<p>The skipper stirred uneasily, and groaned. "Lord, how my head
aches!" he complained.</p>

<p>"They've a sure remedy for that," Sir Oliver comforted him. "And
you'll swing in better company than you deserve, for I am to be
hanged in the morning too. You've earned it as fully as have I,
Master Leigh. Yet I am sorry for you&mdash;sorry you should suffer
where I had not so intended."</p>

<p>Master Leigh sucked in a shuddering breath, and was silent for a
while.</p>

<p>Then he repeated an earlier question.</p>

<p>"Do you believe in God, Sir Oliver?"</p>

<p>"There is no God but God, and Mohammed is his Prophet," was the
answer, and from his tone Master Leigh could not be sure that he
did not mock.</p>

<p>"That's a heathen creed," said he in fear and loathing.</p>

<p>"Nay, now; it's a creed by which men live. They perform as they
preach, which is more than can be said of any Christians I have
ever met."</p>

<p>"How can you talk so upon the eve of death?" cried Leigh in
protest.</p>

<p>"Faith," said Sir Oliver, "it's considered the season of truth
above all others."</p>

<p>"Then ye don't believe in God?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I do."</p>

<p>"But not in the real God?" the skipper insisted.</p>

<p>"There can be no God but the real God&mdash;it matters little
what men call Him."</p>

<p>"Then if ye believe, are ye not afraid?"</p>

<p>"Of what?"</p>

<p>"Of hell, damnation, and eternal fire," roared the skipper,
voicing his own belated terrors.</p>

<p>"I have but fulfilled the destiny which in His Omniscience He
marked out for me," replied Sir Oliver. "My life hath been as He
designed it, since naught may exist or happen save by His Will.
Shall I then fear damnation for having been as God fashioned
me?"</p>

<p>"'Tis the heathen Muslim creed!" Master Leigh protested.</p>

<p>"'Tis a comforting one," said Sir Oliver, "and it should comfort
such a sinner as thou."</p>

<p>But Master Leigh refused to be comforted. "Oh!" he groaned
miserably. "I would that I did not believe in God!"</p>

<p>"Your disbelief could no more abolish Him than can your fear
create Him," replied Sir Oliver. "But your mood being what it is,
were it not best you prayed?"</p>

<p>"Will not you pray with me?" quoth that rascal in his sudden
fear of the hereafter.</p>

<p>"I shall do better," said Sir Oliver at last. "I shall pray for
you&mdash;to Sir John Killigrew, that your life be spared."</p>

<p>"Sure he'll never heed you!" said Master Leigh with a catch in
his breath.</p>

<p>"He shall. His honour is concerned in it. The terms of my
surrender were that none else aboard the galley should suffer any
hurt."</p>

<p>"But I killed Master Lionel."</p>

<p>"True&mdash;but that was in the scrimmage that preceded my
making terms. Sir John pledged me his word, and Sir John will keep
to it when I have made it clear to him that honour demands it."</p>

<p>A great burden was lifted from the skipper's mind&mdash;that
great shadow of the fear of death that had overhung him. With it,
it is greatly to be feared that his desperate penitence also
departed. At least he talked no more of damnation, nor took any
further thought for Sir Oliver's opinions and beliefs concerning
the hereafter. He may rightly have supposed that Sir Oliver's creed
was Sir Oliver's affair, and that should it happen to be wrong he
was scarcely himself a qualified person to correct it. As for
himself, the making of his soul could wait until another day, when
the necessity for it should be more imminent.</p>

<p>Upon that he lay down and attempted to compose himself to sleep,
though the pain in his head proved a difficulty. Finding slumber
impossible after a while he would have talked again; but by that
time his companion's regular breathing warned him that Sir Oliver
had fallen asleep during the silence.</p>

<p>Now this surprised and shocked the skipper. He was utterly at a
loss to understand how one who had lived Sir Oliver's life, been a
renegade and a heathen, should be able to sleep tranquilly in the
knowledge that at dawn he was to hang. His belated Christian zeal
prompted him to rouse the sleeper and to urge him to spend the
little time that yet remained him in making his peace with God.
Humane compassion on the other hand suggested to him that he had
best leave him in the peace of that oblivion. Considering matters
he was profoundly touched to reflect that in such a season Sir
Oliver could have found room in his mind to think of him and his
fate and to undertake to contrive that he should be saved from the
rope. He was the more touched when he bethought him of the extent
to which he had himself been responsible for all that happened to
Sir Oliver. Out of the consideration of heroism, a certain heroism
came to be begotten in him, and he fell to pondering how in his
turn he might perhaps serve Sir Oliver by a frank confession of all
that he knew of the influences that had gone to make Sir Oliver
what he was. This resolve uplifted him, and oddly enough it
uplifted him all the more when he reflected that perhaps he would
be jeopardizing his own neck by the confession upon which he had
determined.</p>

<p>So through that endless night he sat, nursing his aching head,
and enheartened by the first purpose he had ever conceived of a
truly good and altruistic deed. Yet fate it seemed was bent upon
frustrating that purpose of his. For when at dawn they came to hale
Sir Oliver to his doom, they paid no heed to Jasper Leigh's demands
that he, too, should be taken before Sir John.</p>

<p>"Thee bean't included in our orders," said a seaman shortly.</p>

<p>"Maybe not," retorted Master Leigh, "because Sir John little
knows what it is in my power to tell him. Take me before him, I
say, that he may hear from me the truth of certain matters ere it
be too late."</p>

<p>"Be still," the seaman bade him, and struck him heavily across
the face, so that he reeled and collapsed into a corner. "Thee turn
will come soon. Just now our business be with this other
heathen."</p>

<p>"Naught that you can say would avail," Sir Oliver assured him
quietly. "But I thank you for the thought that marks you for my
friend. My hands are bound, Jasper. Were it otherwise I would beg
leave to clasp your own. Fare you well!"</p>

<p>Sir Oliver was led out into the golden sunlight which almost
blinded him after his long confinement in that dark hole. They
were, he gathered, to conduct him to the cabin where a short
mockery of a trial was to be held. But in the waist their progress
was arrested by an officer, who bade them wait.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver sat down upon a coil of rope, his guard about him, an
object of curious inspection to the rude seamen. They thronged the
forecastle and the hatchways to stare at this formidable corsair
who once had been a Cornish gentleman and who had become a renegade
Muslim and a terror to Christianity.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, the sometime Cornish gentleman was difficult to
discern in him as he sat there still wearing the caftan of cloth of
silver over his white tunic and a turban of the same material
swathed about his steel headpiece that ended in a spike. Idly he
swung his brown sinewy legs, naked from knee to ankle, with the
inscrutable calm of the fatalist upon his swarthy hawk face with
its light agate eyes and black forked beard; and those callous
seamen who had assembled there to jeer and mock him were stricken
silent by the intrepidity and stoicism of his bearing in the face
of death.</p>

<p>If the delay chafed him, he gave no outward sign of it. If his
hard, light eyes glanced hither and thither it was upon no idle
quest. He was seeking Rosamund, hoping for a last sight of her
before they launched him upon his last dread voyage.</p>

<p>But Rosamund was not to be seen. She was in the cabin at the
time. She had been there for this hour past, and it was to her that
the present delay was due.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2-24" id="ch2-24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV &mdash; THE
JUDGES</h2>

<p>In the absence of any woman into whose care they might entrust
her, Lord Henry, Sir John, and Master Tobias, the ship's surgeon,
had amongst them tended Rosamund as best they could when numbed and
half-dazed she was brought aboard the Silver Heron.</p>

<p>Master Tobias had applied such rude restoratives as he
commanded, and having made her as comfortable as possible upon a
couch in the spacious cabin astern, he had suggested that she
should be allowed the rest of which she appeared so sorely to stand
in need. He had ushered out the commander and the Queen's
Lieutenant, and himself had gone below to a still more urgent case
that was demanding his attention&mdash;that of Lionel Tressilian,
who had been brought limp and unconscious from the galeasse
together with some four other wounded members of the Silver Heron's
crew.</p>

<p>At dawn Sir John had come below, seeking news of his wounded
friend. He found the surgeon kneeling over Lionel.</p>

<p>As he entered, Master Tobias turned aside, rinsed his hands in a
metal basin placed upon the floor, and rose wiping them on a
napkin.</p>

<p>"I can do no more, Sir John," he muttered in a desponding voice.
"He is sped."</p>

<p>"Dead, d'ye mean?" cried Sir John, a catch in his voice.</p>

<p>The surgeon tossed aside the napkin, and slowly drew down the
upturned sleeves of his black doublet. "All but dead," he answered.
"The wonder is that any spark of life should still linger in a body
with that hole in it. He is bleeding inwardly, and his pulse is
steadily weakening. It must continue so until imperceptibly he
passes away. You may count him dead already, Sir John." He paused.
"A merciful, painless end," he added, and sighed perfunctorily, his
pale shaven face decently grave, for all that such scenes as these
were commonplaces in his life. "Of the other four," he continued,
"Blair is dead; the other three should all recover."</p>

<p>But Sir John gave little heed to the matter of those others. His
grief and dismay at this quenching of all hope for his friend
precluded any other consideration at the moment.</p>

<p>"And he will not even recover consciousness?" he asked
insisting, although already he had been answered.</p>

<p>"As I have said, you may count him dead already, Sir John. My
skill can do nothing for him."</p>

<p>Sir John's head drooped, his countenance drawn and grave. "Nor
can my justice," he added gloomily. "Though it avenge him, it
cannot give me back my friend." He looked at the surgeon.
"Vengeance, sir, is the hollowest of all the mockeries that go to
make up life."</p>

<p>"Your task, Sir John," replied the surgeon, "is one of justice,
not vengeance."</p>

<p>"A quibble, when all is said." He stepped to Lionel's side, and
looked down at the pale handsome face over which the dark shadows
of death were already creeping. "If he would but speak in the
interests of this justice that is to do! If we might but have the
evidence of his own words, lest I should ever be asked to justify
the hanging of Oliver Tressilian."</p>

<p>"Surely, sir," the surgeon ventured, "there can be no such
question ever. Mistress Rosamund's word alone should suffice, if
indeed so much as that even were required."</p>

<p>"Ay! His offenses against God and man are too notorious to leave
grounds upon which any should ever question my right to deal with
him out of hand."</p>

<p>There was a tap at the door and Sir John's own body servant
entered with the announcement that Mistress Rosamund was asking
urgently to see him.</p>

<p>"She will be impatient for news of him," Sir John concluded, and
he groaned. "My God! How am I to tell her? To crush her in the very
hour of her deliverance with such news as this! Was ever irony so
cruel?" He turned, and stepped heavily to the door. There he
paused. "You will remain by him to the end?" he bade the surgeon
interrogatively.</p>

<p>Master Tobias bowed. "Of course, Sir John." And he added,
"'Twill not be long."</p>

<p>Sir John looked across at Lionel again&mdash;a glance of
valediction. "God rest him!" he said hoarsely, and passed out.</p>

<p>In the waist he paused a moment, turned to a knot of lounging
seamen, and bade them throw a halter over the yard-arm, and hale
the renegade Oliver Tressilian from his prison. Then with slow
heavy step and heavier heart he went up the companion to the
vessel's castellated poop.</p>

<p>The sun, new risen in a faint golden haze, shone over a sea
faintly rippled by the fresh clean winds of dawn to which their
every stitch of canvas was now spread. Away on the larboard
quarter, a faint cloudy outline, was the coast of Spain.</p>

<p>Sir John's long sallow face was preternaturally grave when he
entered the cabin, where Rosamund awaited him. He bowed to her with
a grave courtesy, doffing his hat and casting it upon a chair. The
last five years had brought some strands of white into his thick
black hair, and at the temples in particular it showed very grey,
giving him an appearance of age to which the deep lines in his brow
contributed.</p>

<p>He advanced towards her, as she rose to receive him. "Rosamund,
my dear!" he said gently, and took both her hands. He looked with
eyes of sorrow and concern into her white, agitated face.</p>

<p>"Are you sufficiently rested, child?"</p>

<p>"Rested?" she echoed on a note of wonder that he should suppose
it.</p>

<p>"Poor lamb, poor lamb!" he murmured, as a mother might have
done, and drew her towards him, stroking that gleaming auburn head.
"We'll speed us back to England with every stitch of canvas spread.
Take heart then, and..."</p>

<p>But she broke in impetuously, drawing away from him as she
spoke, and his heart sank with foreboding of the thing she was
about to inquire.</p>

<p>"I overheard a sailor just now saying to another that it is your
intent to hang Sir Oliver Tressilian out of hand&mdash;this
morning."</p>

<p>He misunderstood her utterly. "Be comforted," he said. "My
justice shall be swift; my vengeance sure. The yard-arm is charged
already with the rope on which he shall leap to his eternal
punishment."</p>

<p>She caught her breath, and set a hand upon her bosom as if to
repress its sudden tumult.</p>

<p>"And upon what grounds," she asked him with an air of challenge,
squarely facing him, "do you intend to do this thing?"</p>

<p>"Upon what grounds?" he faltered. He stared and frowned,
bewildered by her question and its tone. "Upon what grounds?" he
repeated, foolishly almost in the intensity of his amazement. Then
he considered her more closely, and the wildness of her eyes bore
to him slowly an explanation of words that at first had seemed
beyond explaining.</p>

<p>"I see!" he said in a voice of infinite pity; for the conviction
to which he had leapt was that her poor wits were all astray after
the horrors through which she had lately travelled. "You must
rest," he said gently, "and give no thought to such matters as
these. Leave them to me, and be very sure that I shall avenge you
as is due."</p>

<p>"Sir John, you mistake me, I think. I do not desire that you
avenge me. I have asked you upon what grounds you intend to do this
thing, and you have not answered me."</p>

<p>In increasing amazement he continued to stare. He had been
wrong, then. She was quite sane and mistress of her wits. And yet
instead of the fond inquiries concerning Lionel which he had been
dreading came this amazing questioning of his grounds to hang his
prisoner.</p>

<p>"Need I state to you&mdash;of all living folk&mdash;the offences
which that dastard has committed?" he asked, expressing thus the
very question that he was setting himself.</p>

<p>"You need to tell me," she answered, "by what right you
constitute yourself his judge and executioner; by what right you
send him to his death in this peremptory fashion, without trial."
Her manner was as stern as if she were invested with all the
authority of a judge.</p>

<p>"But you," he faltered in his ever-growing bewilderment, "you,
Rosamund, against whom he has offended so grievously, surely you
should be the last to ask me such a question! Why, it is my
intention to proceed with him as is the manner of the sea with all
knaves taken as Oliver Tressilian was taken. If your mood be
merciful towards him&mdash;which as God lives, I can scarce
conceive&mdash;consider that this is the greatest mercy he can look
for."</p>

<p>"You speak of mercy and vengeance in a breath, Sir John." She
was growing calm, her agitation was quieting and a grim sternness
was replacing it.</p>

<p>He made a gesture of impatience. "What good purpose could it
serve to take him to England?" he demanded. "There he must stand
his trial, and the issue is foregone. It were unnecessarily to
torture him."</p>

<p>"The issue may be none so foregone as you suppose," she replied.
"And that trial is his right."</p>

<p>Sir John took a turn in the cabin, his wits all confused. It was
preposterous that he should stand and argue upon such a matter with
Rosamund of all people, and yet she was compelling him to it
against his every inclination, against common sense itself.</p>

<p>"If he so urges it, we'll not deny him," he said at last,
deeming it best to humour her. "We'll take him back to England if
he demands it, and let him stand his trial there. But Oliver
Tressilian must realize too well what is in store for him to make
any such demand." He passed before her, and held out his hands in
entreaty. "Come, Rosamund, my dear! You are distraught, you..."</p>

<p>"I am indeed distraught, Sir John," she answered, and took the
hands that he extended. "Oh, have pity!" she cried with a sudden
change to utter intercession. "I implore you to have pity!"</p>

<p>"What pity can I show you, child? You have but to name..."</p>

<p>"'Tis not pity for me, but pity for him that I am beseeching of
you."</p>

<p>"For him?" he cried, frowning again.</p>

<p>"For Oliver Tressilian."</p>

<p>He dropped her hands and stood away. "God's light!" he swore.
"You sue for pity for Oliver Tressilian, for that renegade, that
incarnate devil? Oh, you are mad!" he stormed. "Mad!" and he flung
away from her, whirling his arms.</p>

<p>"I love him," she said simply.</p>

<p>That answer smote him instantly still. Under the shock of it he
just stood and stared at her again, his jaw fallen.</p>

<p>"You love him!" he said at last below his breath. "You love him!
You love a man who is a pirate, a renegade, the abductor of
yourself and of Lionel, the man who murdered your brother!"</p>

<p>"He did not." She was fierce in her denial of it. "I have learnt
the truth of that matter."</p>

<p>"From his lips, I suppose?" said Sir John, and he was unable to
repress a sneer. "And you believed him?"</p>

<p>"Had I not believed him I should not have married him."</p>

<p>"Married him?" Sudden horror came now to temper his
bewilderment. Was there to be no end to these astounding
revelations? Had they reached the climax yet, he wondered, or was
there still more to come? "You married that infamous villain?" he
asked, and his voice was expressionless.</p>

<p>"I did&mdash;in Algiers on the night we landed there." He stood
gaping at her whilst a man might count to a dozen, and then
abruptly he exploded. "It is enough!" he roared, shaking a clenched
fist at the low ceiling of the cabin. "It is enough, as God's my
Witness. If there were no other reason to hang him, that would be
reason and to spare. You may look to me to make an end of this
infamous marriage within the hour."</p>

<p>"Ah, if you will but listen to me!" she pleaded.</p>

<p>"Listen to you?" He paused by the door to which he had stepped
in his fury, intent upon giving the word that there and then should
make an end, and summoning Oliver Tressilian before him, announce
his fate to him and see it executed on the spot. "Listen to you?"
he repeated, scorn and anger blending in his voice. "I have heard
more than enough already!"</p>

<p>It was the Killigrew way, Lord Henry Goade assures us, pausing
here at long length for one of those digressions into the history
of families whose members chance to impinge upon his chronicle.
"They were," he says, "ever an impetuous, short-reasoning folk,
honest and upright enough so far as their judgment carried them,
but hampered by a lack of penetration in that judgment."</p>

<p>Sir John, as much in his earlier commerce with the Tressilians
as in this pregnant hour, certainly appears to justify his lordship
of that criticism. There were a score of questions a man of
perspicuity would not have asked, not one of which appears to have
occurred to the knight of Arwenack. If anything arrested him upon
the cabin's threshold, delayed him in the execution of the thing he
had resolved upon, no doubt it was sheer curiosity as to what
further extravagances Rosamund might yet have it in her mind to
utter.</p>

<p>"This man has suffered," she told him, and was not put off by
the hard laugh with which he mocked that statement. "God alone
knows what he has suffered in body and in soul for sins which he
never committed. Much of that suffering came to him through me. I
know to-day that he did not murder Peter. I know that but for a
disloyal act of mine he would be in a position incontestably to
prove it without the aid of any man. I know that he was carried
off, kidnapped before ever he could clear himself of the
accusation, and that as a consequence no life remained him but the
life of a renegade which he chose. Mine was the chief fault. And I
must make amends. Spare him to me! If you love me..."</p>

<p>But he had heard enough. His sallow face was flushed to a
flaming purple.</p>

<p>"Not another word!" he blazed at her. "It is because I do love
you&mdash;love and pity you from my heart&mdash;that I will not
listen. It seems I must save you not only from that knave, but from
yourself. I were false to my duty by you, false to your dead father
and murdered brother else. Anon, you shall thank me, Rosamund." And
again he turned to depart.</p>

<p>"Thank you?" she cried in a ringing voice. "I shall curse you.
All my life I shall loathe and hate you, holding you in horror for
a murderer if you do this thing. You fool! Can you not see? You
fool!"</p>

<p>He recoiled. Being a man of position and importance, quick,
fearless, and vindictive of temperament&mdash;and also, it would
seem, extremely fortunate&mdash;it had never happened to him in all
his life to be so uncompromisingly and frankly judged. She was by
no means the first to account him a fool, but she was certainly the
first to call him one to his face; and whilst to the general it
might have proved her extreme sanity, to him it was no more than
the culminating proof of her mental distemper.</p>

<p>"Pish!" he said, between anger and pity, "you are mad, stark
mad! Your mind's unhinged, your vision's all distorted. This fiend
incarnate is become a poor victim of the evil of others; and I am
become a murderer in your sight&mdash;a murderer and a fool. God's
Life! Bah! Anon when you are rested, when you are restored, I pray
that things may once again assume their proper aspect."</p>

<p>He turned, all aquiver still with indignation, and was barely in
time to avoid being struck by the door which opened suddenly from
without.</p>

<p>Lord Henry Goade, dressed&mdash;as he tells us&mdash;entirely in
black, and with his gold chain of office&mdash;an ominous sign
could they have read it&mdash;upon his broad chest, stood in the
doorway, silhouetted sharply against the flood of morning sunlight
at his back. His benign face would, no doubt, be extremely grave to
match the suit he had put on, but its expression will have
lightened somewhat when his glance fell upon Rosamund standing
there by the table's edge.</p>

<p>"I was overjoyed," he writes, "to find her so far recovered, and
seeming so much herself again, and I expressed my
satisfaction."</p>

<p>"She were better abed," snapped Sir John, two hectic spots
burning still in his sallow cheeks. "She is distempered,
quite."</p>

<p>"Sir John is mistaken, my lord," was her calm assurance, "I am
very far from suffering as he conceives."</p>

<p>"I rejoice therein, my dear," said his lordship, and I imagine
his questing eyes speeding from one to the other of them, and
marking the evidences of Sir John's temper, wondering what could
have passed. "It happens," he added sombrely, "that we may require
your testimony in this grave matter that is toward." He turned to
Sir John. "I have bidden them bring up the prisoner for sentence.
Is the ordeal too much for you, Rosamund?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, no, my lord," she replied readily. "I welcome it." And
threw back her head as one who braces herself for a trial of
endurance.</p>

<p>"No, no," cut in Sir John, protesting fiercely. "Do not heed
her, Harry. She..."</p>

<p>"Considering," she interrupted, "that the chief count against
the prisoner must concern his...his dealings with myself, surely
the matter is one upon which I should be heard."</p>

<p>"Surely, indeed," Lord Henry agreed, a little bewildered, he
confesses, "always provided you are certain it will not overtax
your endurance and distress you overmuch. We could perhaps dispense
with your testimony."</p>

<p>"In that, my lord, I assure you that you are mistaken," she
answered. "You cannot dispense with it."</p>

<p>"Be it so, then," said Sir John grimly, and he strode back to
the table, prepared to take his place there.</p>

<p>Lord Henry's twinkling blue eyes were still considering Rosamund
somewhat searchingly, his fingers tugging thoughtfully at his short
tuft of ashen-coloured beard. Then he turned to the door. "Come in,
gentlemen," he said, "and bid them bring up the prisoner."</p>

<p>Steps clanked upon the deck, and three of Sir John's officers
made their appearance to complete the court that was to sit in
judgment upon the renegade corsair, a judgment whose issue was
foregone.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2-25" id="ch2-25"></a>CHAPTER XXV &mdash; THE
ADVOCATE</h2>

<p>Chairs were set at the long brown table of massive oak, and the
officers sat down, facing the open door and the blaze of sunshine
on the poop-deck, their backs to the other door and the horn
windows which opened upon the stern-gallery. The middle place was
assumed by Lord Henry Goade by virtue of his office of Queen's
Lieutenant, and the reason for his chain of office became now
apparent. He was to preside over this summary court. On his right
sat Sir John Killigrew, and beyond him an officer named Youldon.
The other two, whose names have not survived, occupied his
lordship's left.</p>

<p>A chair had been set for Rosamund at the table's extreme right
and across the head of it, so as to detach her from the judicial
bench. She sat there now, her elbows on the polished board, her
face resting in her half-clenched hands, her eyes scrutinizing the
five gentlemen who formed this court.</p>

<p>Steps rang on the companion, and a shadow fell athwart the
sunlight beyond the open door. From the vessel's waist came a
murmur of voices and a laugh. Then Sir Oliver appeared in the
doorway guarded by two fighting seamen in corselet and morion with
drawn swords.</p>

<p>He paused an instant in the doorway, and his eyelids flickered
as if he had received a shock when his glance alighted upon
Rosamund. Then under the suasion of his guards he entered, and
stood forward, his wrists still pinioned behind him, slightly in
advance of the two soldiers.</p>

<p>He nodded perfunctorily to the court, his face entirely
calm.</p>

<p>"A fine morning, sirs," said he.</p>

<p>The five considered him in silence, but Lord Henry's glance, as
it rested upon the corsair's Muslim garb, was eloquent of the scorn
which he tells us filled his heart.</p>

<p>"You are no doubt aware, sir," said Sir John after a long pause,
"of the purpose for which you have been brought hither."</p>

<p>"Scarcely," said the prisoner. "But I have no doubt whatever of
the purpose for which I shall presently be taken hence. However,"
he continued, cool and critical, "I can guess from your judicial
attitudes the superfluous mockery that you intend. If it will
afford you entertainment, faith, I do not grudge indulging you. I
would observe only that it might be considerate in you to spare
Mistress Rosamund the pain and weariness of the business that is
before you."</p>

<p>"Mistress Rosamund herself desired to be present," said Sir
John, scowling.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Sir Oliver, "she does not realize..."</p>

<p>"I have made it abundantly plain to her," Sir John interrupted,
almost vindictively.</p>

<p>The prisoner looked at her as if in surprise, his brows knit.
Then with a shrug he turned to his judges again.</p>

<p>"In that case," said he, "there's no more to be said. But before
you proceed, there is another matter upon which I desire an
understanding.</p>

<p>"The terms of my surrender were that all others should be
permitted to go free. You will remember, Sir John, that you pledged
me your knightly word for that. Yet I find aboard here one who was
lately with me upon my galeasse&mdash;a sometime English seaman,
named Jasper Leigh, whom you hold a prisoner."</p>

<p>"He killed Master Lionel Tressilian," said Sir John coldly</p>

<p>"That may be, Sir John. But the blow was delivered before I made
my terms with you, and you cannot violate these terms without hurt
to your honour."</p>

<p>"D'ye talk of honour, sir?" said Lord Henry.</p>

<p>"Of Sir John's honour, my lord," said the prisoner, with mock
humility.</p>

<p>"You are here, sir, to take your trial," Sir John reminded
him.</p>

<p>"So I had supposed. It is a privilege for which you agreed to
pay a certain price, and now it seems you have been guilty of
filching something back. It seems so, I say. For I cannot think but
that the arrest was inadvertently effected, and that it will
suffice that I draw your attention to the matter of Master Leigh's
detention."</p>

<p>Sir John considered the table. It was beyond question that he
was in honour bound to enlarge Master Leigh, whatever the fellow
might have done; and, indeed, his arrest had been made without Sir
John's knowledge until after the event.</p>

<p>"What am I do with him?" he growled sullenly.</p>

<p>"That is for yourself to decide, Sir John. But I can tell you
what you may not do with him. You may not keep him a prisoner, or
carry him to England or injure him in any way. Since his arrest was
a pure error, as I gather, you must repair that error as best you
can. I am satisfied that you will do so, and need say no more. Your
servant, sirs," he added to intimate that he was now entirely at
their disposal, and he stood waiting.</p>

<p>There was a slight pause, and then Lord Henry, his face
inscrutable, his glance hostile and cold, addressed the
prisoner.</p>

<p>"We have had you brought hither to afford you an opportunity of
urging any reasons why we should not hang you out of hand, as is
our right."</p>

<p>Sir Oliver looked at him in almost amused surprise. "Faith!" he
said at length. "It was never my habit to waste breath."</p>

<p>"I doubt you do not rightly apprehend me, sir," returned his
lordship, and his voice was soft and silken as became his judicial
position. "Should you demand a formal trial, we will convey you to
England that you may have it."</p>

<p>"But lest you should build unduly upon that," cut in Sir John
fiercely, "let me warn you that as the offences for which you are
to suffer were chiefly committed within Lord Henry Goade's own
jurisdiction, your trial will take place in Cornwall, where Lord
Henry has the honour to be Her Majesty's Lieutenant and dispenser
of justice."</p>

<p>"Her Majesty is to be congratulated," said Sir Oliver
elaborately.</p>

<p>"It is for you to choose, sir," Sir John ran on, "whether you
will be hanged on sea or land."</p>

<p>"My only possible objection would be to being hanged in the air.
But you're not likely to heed that," was the flippant answer.</p>

<p>Lord Henry leaned forward again. "Let me beg you, sir, in your
own interests to be serious," he admonished the prisoner.</p>

<p>"I confess the occasion, my lord. For if you are to sit in
judgment upon my piracy, I could not desire a more experienced
judge of the matter on sea or land than Sir John Killigrew."</p>

<p>"I am glad to deserve your approval," Sir John replied tartly.
"Piracy," he added, "is but the least of the counts against
you."</p>

<p>Sir Oliver's brows went up, and he stared at the row of solemn
faces.</p>

<p>"As God's my life, then, your other counts must needs be
sound&mdash;or else, if there be any justice in your methods, you
are like to be disappointed of your hopes of seeing me swing.
Proceed, sirs, to the other counts. I vow you become more
interesting than I could have hoped."</p>

<p>"Can you deny the piracy?" quoth Lord Henry.</p>

<p>"Deny it? No. But I deny your jurisdiction in the matter, or
that of any English court, since I have committed no piracy in
English waters."</p>

<p>Lord Henry admits that the answer silenced and bewildered him,
being utterly unexpected. Yet what the prisoner urged was a truth
so obvious that it was difficult to apprehend how his lordship had
come to overlook it. I rather fear that despite his judicial
office, jurisprudence was not a strong point with his lordship. But
Sir John, less perspicuous or less scrupulous in the matter, had
his retort ready.</p>

<p>"Did you not come to Arwenack and forcibly carry off
thence..."</p>

<p>"Nay, now, nay, now," the corsair interrupted, good-humouredly.
"Go back to school, Sir John, to learn that abduction is not
piracy."</p>

<p>"Call it abduction, if you will," Sir John admitted.</p>

<p>"Not if I will, Sir John. We'll call it what it is, if you
please."</p>

<p>"You are trifling, sir. But we shall mend that presently," and
Sir John banged the table with his fist, his face flushing slightly
in anger. (Lord Henry very properly deplores this show of heat at
such a time.) "You cannot pretend to be ignorant," Sir John
continued, "that abduction is punishable by death under the law of
England." He turned to his fellow-judges. "We will then, sirs, with
your concurrence, say no more of the piracy."</p>

<p>"Faith," said Lord Henry in his gentle tones, "in justice we
cannot." And he shrugged the matter aside. "The prisoner is right
in what he claims. We have no jurisdiction in that matter, seeing
that he committed no piracy in English waters, nor&mdash;so far as
our knowledge goes&mdash;against any vessel sailing under the
English flag."</p>

<p>Rosamund stirred. Slowly she took her elbows from the table, and
folded her arms resting them upon the edge of it. Thus leaning
forward she listened now with an odd brightness in her eye, a
slight flush in her cheeks reflecting some odd excitement called
into life by Lord Henry's admission&mdash;an admission which
sensibly whittled down the charges against the prisoner.</p>

<p>Sir Oliver, watching her almost furtively, noted this and
marvelled, even as he marvelled at her general composure. It was in
vain that he sought to guess what might be her attitude of mind
towards himself now that she was safe again among friends and
protectors.</p>

<p>But Sir John, intent only upon the business ahead, plunged
angrily on.</p>

<p>"Be it so," he admitted impatiently. "We will deal with him upon
the counts of abduction and murder. Have you anything to say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing that would be like to weigh with you," replied Sir
Oliver. And then with a sudden change from his slightly derisive
manner to one that was charged with passion: "Let us make an end of
this comedy," he cried, "of this pretence of judicial proceedings.
Hang me, and have done, or set me to walk the plank. Play the
pirate, for that is a trade you understand. But a' God's name don't
disgrace the Queen's commission by playing the judge."</p>

<p>Sir John leapt to his feet, his face aflame. "Now, by Heaven,
you insolent knave..."</p>

<p>But Lord Henry checked him, placing a restraining hand upon his
sleeve, and forcing him gently back into his seat. Himself he now
addressed the prisoner.</p>

<p>"Sir, your words are unworthy one who, whatever his crimes, has
earned the repute of being a sturdy, valiant fighter. Your deeds
are so notorious&mdash;particularly that which caused you to flee
from England and take to roving, and that of your reappearance at
Arwenack and the abduction of which you were then guilty&mdash;that
your sentence in an English court is a matter foregone beyond all
possible doubt. Nevertheless, it shall be yours, as I have said,
for the asking.</p>

<p>"Yet," he added, and his voice was lowered and very earnest,
"were I your friend, Sir Oliver, I would advise you that you rather
choose to be dealt with in the summary fashion of the sea."</p>

<p>"Sirs," replied Sir Oliver, "your right to hang me I have not
disputed, nor do I. I have no more to say."</p>

<p>"But I have."</p>

<p>Thus Rosamund at last, startling the court with her crisp, sharp
utterance. All turned to look at her as she rose, and stood tall
and compelling at the table's end.</p>

<p>"Rosamund!" cried Sir John, and rose in his turn. "Let me
implore you..."</p>

<p>She waved him peremptorily, almost contemptuously, into
silence.</p>

<p>"Since in this matter of the abduction with which Sir Oliver is
charged," she said, "I am the person said to have been abducted, it
were perhaps well that before going further in this matter you
should hear what I may hereafter have to say in an English
court."</p>

<p>Sir John shrugged, and sat down again. She would have her way,
he realized; just as he knew that its only result could be to waste
their time and protract the agony of the doomed man.</p>

<p>Lord Henry turned to her, his manner full of deference. "Since
the prisoner has not denied the charge, and since wisely he
refrains from demanding to be taken to trial, we need not harass
you, Mistress Rosamund. Nor will you be called upon to say anything
in an English court."</p>

<p>"There you are at fault, my lord," she answered, her voice very
level. "I shall be called upon to say something when I impeach you
all for murder upon the high seas, as impeach you I shall if you
persist in your intent."</p>

<p>"Rosamund!" cried Oliver in his sudden amazement&mdash;and it
was a cry of joy and exultation.</p>

<p>She looked at him, and smiled&mdash;a smile full of courage and
friendliness and something more, a smile for which he considered
that his impending hanging was but a little price to pay. Then she
turned again to that court, into which her words had flung a sudden
consternation.</p>

<p>"Since he disdains to deny the accusation, I must deny it for
him," she informed them. "He did not abduct me, sirs, as is
alleged. I love Oliver Tressilian. I am of full age and mistress of
my actions, and I went willingly with him to Algiers where I became
his wife."</p>

<p>Had she flung a bomb amongst them she could hardly have made a
greater disorder of their wits. They sat back, and stared at her
with blank faces, muttering incoherencies.</p>

<p>"His...his wife?" babbled Lord Henry. "You became his..."</p>

<p>And then Sir John cut in fiercely. "A lie! A lie to save that
foul villain's neck!"</p>

<p>Rosamund leaned towards him, and her smile was almost a sneer.
"Your wits were ever sluggish, Sir John," she said. "Else you would
not need reminding that I could have no object in lying to save him
if he had done me the wrong that is imputed to him." Then she
looked at the others. "I think, sirs, that in this matter my word
will outweigh Sir John's or any man's in any court of justice."</p>

<p>"Faith, that's true enough!" ejaculated the bewildered Lord
Henry. "A moment, Killigrew!" And again he stilled the impetuous
Sir John. He looked at Sir Oliver, who in truth was very far from
being the least bewildered in that company. "What do you say to
that, sir?" he asked.</p>

<p>"To that?" echoed the almost speechless corsair. "What is there
left to say?" he evaded.</p>

<p>"'Tis all false," cried Sir John again. "We were witnesses of
the event&mdash;you and I, Harry&mdash;and we saw..."</p>

<p>"You saw," Rosamund interrupted. "But you did not know what had
been concerted."</p>

<p>For a moment that silenced them again. They were as men who
stand upon crumbling ground, whose every effort to win to a safer
footing but occasioned a fresh slide of soil. Then Sir John
sneered, and made his riposte.</p>

<p>"No doubt she will be prepared to swear that her betrothed,
Master Lionel Tressilian, accompanied her willingly upon that
elopement."</p>

<p>"No," she answered. "As for Lionel Tressilian he was carried off
that he might expiate his sins&mdash;sins which he had fathered
upon his brother there, sins which are the subject of your other
count against him."</p>

<p>"Now what can you mean by that?" asked his lordship.</p>

<p>"That the story that Sir Oliver killed my brother is a calumny;
that the murderer was Lionel Tressilian, who, to avoid detection
and to complete his work, caused Sir Oliver to be kidnapped that he
might be sold into slavery."</p>

<p>"This is too much!" roared Sir John. "She is trifling with us,
she makes white black and black white. She has been bewitched by
that crafty rogue, by Moorish arts that..."</p>

<p>"Wait!" said Lord Henry, raising his hand. "Give me leave." He
confronted her very seriously. "This...this is a grave statement,
mistress. Have you any proof&mdash;anything that you conceive to be
a proof&mdash;of what you are saying?"</p>

<p>But Sir John was not to be repressed. "'Tis but the lying tale
this villain told her. He has bewitched her, I say. 'Tis plain as
the sunlight yonder."</p>

<p>Sir Oliver laughed outright at that. His mood was growing
exultant, buoyant, and joyous, and this was the first expression of
it. "Bewitched her? You're determined never to lack for a charge.
First 'twas piracy, then abduction and murder, and now 'tis
witchcraft!"</p>

<p>"Oh, a moment, pray!" cried Lord Henry, and he confesses to some
heat at this point. "Do you seriously tell us, Mistress Rosamund,
that it was Lionel Tressilian who murdered Peter Godolphin?"</p>

<p>"Seriously?" she echoed, and her lips were twisted in a little
smile of scorn. "I not merely tell it you, I swear it here in the
sight of God. It was Lionel who murdered my brother and it was
Lionel who put it about that the deed was Sir Oliver's. It was said
that Sir Oliver had run away from the consequences of something
discovered against him, and I to my shame believed the public
voice. But I have since discovered the truth..."</p>

<p>"The truth, do you say, mistress?" cried the impetuous Sir John
in a voice of passionate contempt. "The truth..."</p>

<p>Again his Lordship was forced to intervene.</p>

<p>"Have patience, man," he admonished the knight. "The truth will
prevail in the end, never fear, Killigrew."</p>

<p>"Meanwhile we are wasting time," grumbled Sir John, and on that
fell moodily silent.</p>

<p>"Are we further to understand you to say, mistress," Lord Henry
resumed, "that the prisoner's disappearance from Penarrow was due
not to flight, as was supposed, but to his having been trepanned by
order of his brother?"</p>

<p>"That is the truth as I stand here in the sight of Heaven," she
replied in a voice that rang with sincerity and carried conviction
to more than one of the officers seated at that table. "By that act
the murderer sought not only to save himself from exposure, but to
complete his work by succeeding to the Tressilian estates. Sir
Oliver was to have been sold into slavery to the Moors of Barbary.
Instead the vessel upon which he sailed was captured by Spaniards,
and he was sent to the galleys by the Inquisition. When his galley
was captured by Muslim corsairs he took the only way of escape that
offered. He became a corsair and a leader of corsairs, and
then..."</p>

<p>"What else he did we know," Lord Henry interrupted. "And I
assure you it would all weigh very lightly with us or with any
court if what else you say is true."</p>

<p>"It is true. I swear it, my lord," she repeated.</p>

<p>"Ay," he answered, nodding gravely. "But can you prove it?"</p>

<p>"What better proof can I offer you than that I love him, and
have married him?"</p>

<p>"Bah!" said Sir John.</p>

<p>"That, mistress," said Lord Henry, his manner extremely gentle,
"is proof that yourself you believe this amazing story. But it is
not proof that the story itself is true. You had it, I suppose," he
continued smoothly, "from Oliver Tressilian himself?"</p>

<p>"That is so; but in Lionel's own presence, and Lionel himself
confirmed it&mdash;admitting its truth."</p>

<p>"You dare say that?" cried Sir John, and stared at her in
incredulous anger. "My God! You dare say that?"</p>

<p>"I dare and do," she answered him, giving him back look for
look.</p>

<p>Lord Henry sat back in his chair, and tugged gently at his ashen
tuft of beard, his florid face overcast and thoughtful. There was
something here he did not understand at all. "Mistress Rosamund,"
he said quietly, "let me exhort you to consider the gravity of your
words. You are virtually accusing one who is no longer able to
defend himself; if your story is established, infamy will rest for
ever upon the memory of Lionel Tressilian. Let me ask you again,
and let me entreat you to answer scrupulously. Did Lionel
Tressilian admit the truth of this thing with which you say that
the prisoner charged him?"</p>

<p>"Once more I solemnly swear that what I have spoken is true;
that Lionel Tressilian did in my presence, when charged by Sir
Oliver with the murder of my brother and the kidnapping of himself,
admit those charges. Can I make it any plainer, sirs?"</p>

<p>Lord Henry spread his hands. "After that, Killigrew, I do not
think we can go further in this matter. Sir Oliver must go with us
to England, and there take his trial."</p>

<p>But there was one present&mdash;that officer named
Youldon&mdash;whose wits, it seems, were of keener temper.</p>

<p>"By your leave, my lord," he now interposed, and he turned to
question the witness. "What was the occasion on which Sir Oliver
forced this admission from his brother?"</p>

<p>Truthfully she answered. "At his house in Algiers on the night
he..." She checked suddenly, perceiving then the trap that had been
set for her. And the others perceived it also. Sir John leapt into
the breach which Youldon had so shrewdly made in her defences.</p>

<p>"Continue, pray," he bade her. "On the night he..."</p>

<p>"On the night we arrived there," she answered desperately, the
colour now receding slowly from her face.</p>

<p>"And that, of course," said Sir John slowly, mockingly almost,
"was the first occasion on which you heard this explanation of Sir
Oliver's conduct?"</p>

<p>"It was," she faltered&mdash;perforce.</p>

<p>"So that," insisted Sir John, determined to leave her no
loophole whatsoever, "so that until that night you had naturally
continued to believe Sir Oliver to be the murderer of your
brother?"</p>

<p>She hung her head in silence, realizing that the truth could not
prevail here since she had hampered it with a falsehood, which was
now being dragged into the light.</p>

<p>"Answer me!" Sir John commanded.</p>

<p>"There is no need to answer," said Lord Henry slowly, in a voice
of pain, his eyes lowered to the table. "There can, of course, be
but one answer. Mistress Rosamund has told us that he did not
abduct her forcibly; that she went with him of her own free will
and married him; and she has urged that circumstance as a proof of
her conviction of his innocence. Yet now it becomes plain that at
the time she left England with him she still believed him to be her
brother's slayer. Yet she asks us to believe that he did not abduct
her." He spread his hands again and pursed his lips in a sort of
grieved contempt.</p>

<p>"Let us make an end, a' God's name!" said Sir John, rising.</p>

<p>"Ah, wait!" she cried. "I swear that all that I have told you is
true&mdash;all but the matter of the abduction. I admit that, but I
condoned it in view of what I have since learnt."</p>

<p>"She admits it!" mocked Sir John.</p>

<p>But she went on without heeding him. "Knowing what he has
suffered through the evil of others, I gladly own him my husband,
hoping to make some amends to him for the part I had in his wrongs.
You must believe me, sirs. But if you will not, I ask you is his
action of yesterday to count for naught? Are you not to remember
that but for him you would have had no knowledge of my
whereabouts?"</p>

<p>They stared at her in fresh surprise.</p>

<p>"To what do you refer now, mistress? What action of his is
responsible for this?"</p>

<p>"Do you need to ask? Are you so set on murdering him that you
affect ignorance? Surely you know that it was he dispatched Lionel
to inform you of my whereabouts?"</p>

<p>Lord Henry tells us that at this he smote the table with his
open palm, displaying an anger he could no longer curb. "This is
too much!" he cried. "Hitherto I have believed you sincere but
misguided and mistaken. But so deliberate a falsehood transcends
all bounds. What has come to you, girl? Why, Lionel himself told us
the circumstances of his escape from the galeasse. Himself he told
us how that villain had him flogged and then flung him into the sea
for dead."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Sir Oliver between his teeth. "I recognize Lionel
there! He would be false to the end, of course. I should have
thought of that."</p>

<p>Rosamund at bay, in a burst of regal anger leaned forward to
face Lord Henry and the others. "He lied, the base, treacherous
dog!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Madam," Sir John rebuked her, "you are speaking of one who is
all but dead."</p>

<p>"And more than damned," added Sir Oliver. "Sirs," he cried, "you
prove naught but your own stupidity when you accuse this gentle
lady of falsehood."</p>

<p>"We have heard enough, sir," Lord Henry interrupted.</p>

<p>"Have you so, by God!" he roared, stung suddenly to anger. "You
shall hear yet a little more. The truth will prevail, you have said
yourself; and prevail the truth shall since this sweet lady so
desires it."</p>

<p>He was flushed, and his light eyes played over them like points
of steel, and like points of steel they carried a certain measure
of compulsion. He had stood before them half-mocking and
indifferent, resigned to hang and desiring the thing might be over
and ended as speedily as possible. But all that was before he
suspected that life could still have anything to offer him, whilst
he conceived that Rosamund was definitely lost to him. True, he had
the memory of a certain tenderness she had shown him yesternight
aboard the galley, but he had deemed that tenderness to be no more
than such as the situation itself begot. Almost he had deemed the
same to be here the case until he had witnessed her fierceness and
despair in fighting for his life, until he had heard and gauged the
sincerity of her avowal that she loved him and desired to make some
amends to him for all that he had suffered in the past. That had
spurred him, and had a further spur been needed, it was afforded
him when they branded her words with falsehood, mocked her to her
face with what they supposed to be her lies. Anger had taken him at
that to stiffen his resolve to make a stand against them and use
the one weapon that remained him&mdash;that a merciful chance, a
just God had placed within his power almost despite himself.</p>

<p>"I little knew, sirs," he said, "that Sir John was guided by the
hand of destiny itself when last night, in violation of the terms
of my surrender, he took a prisoner from my galeasse. That man is,
as I have said, a sometime English seaman, named Jasper Leigh. He
fell into my hands some months ago, and took the same road to
escape from thraldom that I took myself under the like
circumstances. I was merciful in that I permitted him to do so, for
he is the very skipper who was suborned by Lionel to kidnap me and
carry me into Barbary. With me he fell into the hands of the
Spaniards. Have him brought hither, and question him."</p>

<p>In silence they all looked at him, but on more than one face he
saw the reflection of amazement at his impudence, as they conceived
it.</p>

<p>It was Lord Henry who spoke at last. "Surely, sir, this is most
oddly, most suspiciously apt," he said, and there could be no doubt
that he was faintly sneering. "The very man to be here aboard, and
taken prisoner thus, almost by chance..."</p>

<p>"Not quite by chance, though very nearly. He conceives that he
has a grudge against Lionel, for it was through Lionel that
misfortune overtook him. Last night when Lionel so rashly leapt
aboard the galley, Jasper Leigh saw his opportunity to settle an
old score and took it. It was as a consequence of that that he was
arrested."</p>

<p>"Even so, the chance is still miraculous."</p>

<p>"Miracles, my lord, must happen sometimes if the truth is to
prevail," Sir Oliver replied with a tinge of his earlier mockery.
"Fetch him hither, and question him. He knows naught of what has
passed here. It were a madness to suppose him primed for a
situation which none could have foreseen. Fetch him hither,
then."</p>

<p>Steps sounded outside but went unheeded at the moment.</p>

<p>"Surely," said Sir John, "we have been trifled with by liars
long enough!"</p>

<p>The door was flung open, and the lean black figure of the
surgeon made its appearance.</p>

<p>"Sir John!" he called urgently, breaking without ceremony into
the proceedings, and never heeding Lord Henry's scowl. "Master
Tressilian has recovered consciousness. He is asking for you and
for his brother. Quick, sirs! He is sinking fast."</p>

<h2><a name="ch2-26" id="ch2-26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI &mdash; THE
JUDGMENT</h2>

<p>To that cabin below the whole company repaired in all speed in
the surgeon's wake, Sir Oliver coming last between his guards. They
assembled about the couch where Lionel lay, leaden-hued of face,
his breathing laboured, his eyes dull and glazing.</p>

<p>Sir John ran to him, went down upon one knee to put loving arms
about that chilling clay, and very gently raised him in them, and
held him so resting against his breast.</p>

<p>"Lionel!" he cried in stricken accents. And then as if thoughts
of vengeance were to soothe and comfort his sinking friend's last
moments, he added: "We have the villain fast."</p>

<p>Very slowly and with obvious effort Lionel turned his head to
the right, and his dull eyes went beyond Sir John and made quest in
the ranks of those that stood about him.</p>

<p>"Oliver?" he said in a hoarse whisper. "Where is Oliver?"</p>

<p>"There is not the need to distress you..." Sir John was
beginning, when Lionel interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Wait!" he commanded in a louder tone. "Is Oliver safe?"</p>

<p>"I am here," said Sir Oliver's deep voice, and those who stood
between him and his brother drew aside that they might cease from
screening him.</p>

<p>Lionel looked at him for a long moment in silence, sitting up a
little. Then he sank back again slowly against Sir John's
breast.</p>

<p>"God has been merciful to me, a sinner," he said, "since He
accords me the means to make amends, tardily though it be."</p>

<p>Then he struggled up again, and held out his arms to Sir Oliver,
and his voice came in a great pleading cry. "Noll! My brother!
Forgive!"</p>

<p>Oliver advanced, none hindering until, with his hands still
pinioned behind him he stood towering there above his brother, so
tall that his turban brushed the low ceiling of the cabin. His
countenance was stern and grim.</p>

<p>"What is it that you ask me to forgive?" he asked. Lionel
struggled to answer, and sank back again into Sir John's arms,
fighting for breath; there was a trace of blood-stained foam about
his lips.</p>

<p>"Speak! Oh, speak, in God's name!" Rosamund exhorted him from
the other side, and her voice was wrung with agony.</p>

<p>He looked at her, and smiled faintly. "Never fear," he
whispered, "I shall speak. God has spared me to that end. Take your
arms from me, Killigrew. I am the...the vilest of men. It...it was
I who killed Peter Godolphin."</p>

<p>"My God!" groaned Sir John, whilst Lord Henry drew a sharp
breath of dismay and realization.</p>

<p>"Ah, but that is not my sin," Lionel continued. "There was no
sin in that. We fought, and in self-defence I slew
him&mdash;fighting fair. My sin came afterwards. When suspicion
fell on Oliver, I nourished it...Oliver knew the deed was mine, and
kept silent that he might screen me. I feared the truth might
become known for all that...and...and I was jealous of him,
and...and I had him kidnapped to be sold..."</p>

<p>His fading voice trailed away into silence. A cough shook him,
and the faint crimson foam on his lips was increased. But he
rallied again, and lay there panting, his fingers plucking at the
coverlet.</p>

<p>"Tell them," said Rosamund, who in her desperate fight for Sir
Oliver's life kept her mind cool and steady and directed towards
essentials, "tell them the name of the man you hired to kidnap
him."</p>

<p>"Jasper Leigh, the skipper of the Swallow," he answered,
whereupon she flashed upon Lord Henry a look that contained a gleam
of triumph for all that her face was ashen and her lips
trembled.</p>

<p>Then she turned again to the dying man, relentlessly almost in
her determination to extract all vital truth from him ere he fell
silent.</p>

<p>"Tell them," she bade him, "under what circumstances Sir Oliver
sent you last night to the Silver Heron."</p>

<p>"Nay, there is no need to harass him," Lord Henry interposed.
"He has said enough already. May God forgive us our blindness,
Killigrew!"</p>

<p>Sir John bowed his head in silence over Lionel.</p>

<p>"Is it you, Sir John?" whispered the dying man. "What? Still
there? Ha!" he seemed to laugh faintly, then checked. "I am
going..." he muttered, and again his voice grew stronger, obeying
the last flicker of his shrinking will. "Noll! I am going! I...I
have made reparation...all that I could. Give me...give me thy
hand!" Gropingly he put forth his right.</p>

<p>"I should have given it you ere this but that my wrists are
bound," cried Oliver in a sudden frenzy. And then exerting that
colossal strength of his, he suddenly snapped the cords that
pinioned him as if they had been thread. He caught his brother's
extended hand, and dropped upon his knees beside him.
"Lionel...Boy!" he cried. It was as if all that had befallen in the
last five years had been wiped out of existence. His fierce
relentless hatred of his half-brother, his burning sense of wrong,
his parching thirst for vengeance, became on the instant all dead,
buried, and forgotten. More, it was as if they had never been.
Lionel in that moment was again the weak, comely, beloved brother
whom he had cherished and screened and guarded, and for whom when
the hour arrived he had sacrificed his good name, and the woman he
loved, and placed his life itself in jeopardy.</p>

<p>"Lionel, boy!" was all that for a moment he could say. Then:
"Poor lad! Poor lad!" he added. "Temptation was too strong for
thee." And reaching forth he took the other white hand that lay
beyond the couch, and so held both tight-clasped within his
own.</p>

<p>From one of the ports a ray of sunshine was creeping upwards
towards the dying man's face. But the radiance that now overspread
it was from an inward source. Feebly he returned the clasp of his
brother's hands.</p>

<p>"Oliver, Oliver!" he whispered. "There is none like thee! I ever
knew thee as noble as I was base. Have I said enough to make you
safe? Say that he will be safe now," he appealed to the others,
"that no..."</p>

<p>"He will be safe," said Lord Henry stoutly. "My word on't."</p>

<p>"It is well. The past is past. The future is in your hands,
Oliver. God's blessing on't." He seemed to collapse, to rally yet
again. He smiled pensively, his mind already wandering. "That was a
long swim last night&mdash;the longest I ever swam. From Penarrow
to Trefusis&mdash;a fine long swim. But you were with me, Noll. Had
my strength given out...I could have depended on you. I am still
chill from it, for it was cold...cold...ugh!" He shuddered, and lay
still.</p>

<p>Gently Sir John lowered him to his couch. Beyond it Rosamund
fell upon her knees and covered her face, whilst by Sir John's side
Oliver continued to kneel, clasping in his own his brother's
chilling hands.</p>

<p>There ensued a long spell of silence. Then with a heavy sigh Sir
Oliver folded Lionel's hands across his breast, and slowly, heavily
rose to his feet.</p>

<p>The others seemed to take this for a signal. It was as if they
had but waited mute and still out of deference to Oliver. Lord
Henry moved softly round to Rosamund and touched her lightly upon
the shoulder. She rose and went out in the wake of the others, Lord
Henry following her, and none remaining but the surgeon.</p>

<p>Outside in the sunshine they checked. Sir John stood with bent
head and hunched shoulders, his eyes upon the white deck. Timidly
almost&mdash;a thing never seen before in this bold man&mdash;he
looked at Sir Oliver.</p>

<p>"He was my friend," he said sorrowfully, and as if to excuse and
explain himself, "and...and I was misled through love of him."</p>

<p>"He was my brother," replied Sir Oliver solemnly. "God rest
him!"</p>

<p>Sir John, resolved, drew himself up into an attitude preparatory
to receiving with dignity a rebuff should it be administered
him.</p>

<p>"Can you find it in your generosity, sir, to forgive me?" he
asked, and his air was almost one of challenge.</p>

<p>Silently Sir Oliver held out his hand. Sir John fell upon it
almost in eagerness.</p>

<p>"We are like to be neighbours again," he said, "and I give you
my word I shall strive to be a more neighbourly one than in the
past."</p>

<p>"Then, sirs," said Sir Oliver, looking from Sir John to Lord
Henry, "I am to understand that I am no longer a prisoner."</p>

<p>"You need not hesitate to return with us to England, Sir
Oliver," replied his lordship. "The Queen shall hear your story,
and we have Jasper Leigh to confirm it if need be, and I will go
warranty for your complete reinstatement. Count me your friend, Sir
Oliver, I beg." And he, too, held out his hand. Then turning to the
others: "Come, sirs," he said, "we have duties elsewhere, I
think."</p>

<p>They tramped away, leaving Oliver and Rosamund alone. The twain
looked long each at the other. There was so much to say, so much to
ask, so much to explain, that neither knew with what words to
begin. Then Rosamund suddenly came up to him, holding out her
hands. "Oh, my dear!" she said, and that, after all, summed up a
deal.</p>

<p>One or two over-inquisitive seamen, lounging on the forecastle
and peeping through the shrouds, were disgusted to see the lady of
Godolphin Court in the arms of a beturbaned bare-legged follower of
Mahound.</p>
