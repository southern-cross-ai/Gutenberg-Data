<h2><a name="book1" id="book1"></a>BOOK OF KHALK'RU</h2>

<h2>1. &mdash; SOUNDS IN THE NIGHT</h2>

<p class="first">I raised my head, listening&mdash;not only with my
ears but with every square inch of my skin, waiting for a
recurrence of the sound that had awakened me. There was silence,
utter silence. No soughing in the boughs of the spruces clustered
around the little camp. No stirring of furtive life in the
underbrush. Through the spires of the spruces the stars shone wanly
in the short sunset to sunrise twilight of the early Alaskan
summer.</p>

<p>A sudden wind bent the spruce tops, carrying again the
sound&mdash;the clangor of a beaten anvil.</p>

<p>I slipped out of my blanket, and round the dim embers of the
fire toward Jim. His voice halted me.</p>

<p>"All right, Leif. I hear it."</p>

<p>The wind sighed and died, and with it died the humming
aftertones of the anvil stroke. Before we could speak, the wind
arose. It bore the after-hum of the anvil stroke&mdash;faint and
far away. And again the wind died, and with it the sound.</p>

<p>"An anvil, Leif!"</p>

<p>"Listen!"</p>

<p>A stronger gust swayed the spruces. It carried a distant
chanting; voices of many women and men singing a strange, minor
theme. The chant ended on a wailing chord, archaic, dissonant.</p>

<p>There was a long roll of drums, rising in a swift crescendo,
ending abruptly. After it a thin and clamorous confusion.</p>

<p>It was smothered by a low, sustained rumbling, like thunder,
muted by miles. In it defiance, challenge.</p>

<p>We waited, listening. The spruces were motionless. The wind did
not return.</p>

<p>"Queer sort of sounds, Jim." I tried to speak casually, He sat
up. A stick flared up in the dying fire. Its light etched his face
against the darkness &mdash;thin, and brown and hawk-profiled. He
did not look at me.</p>

<p>"Every feathered forefather for the last twenty centuries is
awake and shouting! Better call me Tsantawu, Leif. Tsi'
Tsa'lagi&mdash;I am a Cherokee! Right now&mdash;all Indian."</p>

<p>He smiled, but still he did not look at me, and I was glad of
that.</p>

<p>"It was an anvil," I said. "A hell of a big anvil. And hundreds
of people singing...and how could that be in this wilderness...they
didn't sound like Indians..."</p>

<p>"The drums weren't Indian." He squatted by the fire, staring
into it. "When they turned loose, something played a pizzicato with
icicles up and down my back."</p>

<p>"They got me, too&mdash;those drums!" I thought my voice was
steady, but he looked up at me sharply; and now it was I who
averted my eyes and stared at the embers. "They reminded me of
something I heard...and thought I saw... in Mongolia. So did the
singing. Damn it, Jim, why do you look at me like that?"</p>

<p>I threw a stick on the fire. For the life of me I couldn't help
searching the shadows as the stick flamed. Then I met his gaze
squarely.</p>

<p>"Pretty bad place, was it, Leif?" he asked, quietly. I said
nothing. Jim got up and walked over to the packs. He came back with
some water and threw it over the fire. He kicked earth on the
hissing coals. If he saw me wince as the shadows rushed in upon us,
he did not show it.</p>

<p>"That wind came from the north," he said. "So that's the way the
sounds came. Therefore, whatever made the sounds is north of us.
That being so &mdash;which way do we travel tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"North," I said.</p>

<p>My throat dried as I said it.</p>

<p>Jim laughed. He dropped upon his blanket, and rolled it around
him. I propped myself against the bole of one of the spruces, and
sat staring toward the north.</p>

<p>"The ancestors are vociferous, Leif. Promising a lodge of
sorrow, I gather &mdash;if we go north...'Bad Medicine!' say the
ancestors...'Bad Medicine for you, Tsantawu! You go to Usunhi'yi,
the Darkening-land, Tsantawu!...Into Tsusgina'i, the ghost country!
Beware! Turn from the north, Tsantawu!'"</p>

<p>"Oh, go to sleep, you hag-ridden redskin!"</p>

<p>"All right, I'm just telling you."</p>

<p>Then a little later:</p>

<p>"'And heard ancestral voices prophesying war'&mdash;it's worse
than war these ancestors of mine are prophesying, Leif."</p>

<p>"Damn it, will you shut up!"</p>

<p>A chuckle from the darkness; thereafter silence.</p>

<p>I leaned against the tree trunk. The sounds, or rather the evil
memory they had evoked, had shaken me more than I was willing to
admit, even to myself. The thing I had carried for two years in the
buckskin bag at the end of the chain around my neck had seemed to
stir; turn cold. I wondered how much Jim had divined of what I had
tried to cover...Why had he put out the fire? Because he had known
I was afraid? To force me to face my fear and conquer it?...Or had
it been the Indian instinct to seek cover in darkness?...By his own
admission, chant and drum-roll had played on his nerves as they had
on mine...</p>

<p>Afraid! Of course it had been fear that had wet the palms of my
hands, and had tightened my throat so my heart had beaten in my
ears like drums.</p>

<p>Like drums...yes!</p>

<p>But...not like those drums whose beat had been borne to us by
the north wind. They had been like the cadence of the feet of men
and women, youths and maids and children, running ever more rapidly
up the side of a hollow world to dive swiftly into the
void...dissolving into the nothingness...fading as they
fell...dissolving...eaten up by the nothingness...</p>

<p>Like that accursed drum-roll I had heard in the secret temple of
the Gobi oasis two years ago!</p>

<p>Neither then nor now had it been fear alone. Fear it was, in
truth, but fear shot through with defiance...defiance of life
against its negation... upsurging, roaring, vital rage...frantic
revolt of the drowning against the strangling water, rage of the
candle-flame against the hovering extinguisher...</p>

<p>Was it as hopeless as that? If what I suspected to be true was
true, to think so was to be beaten at the beginning!</p>

<p>But there was Jim! How to keep him out of it? In my heart, I had
never laughed at those subconscious perceptions, whatever they
were, that he called the voices of his ancestors. When he had
spoken of Usunhi'yi, the Darkening- land, a chill had crept down my
spine. For had not the old Uighur priest spoken of the
Shadowed-land? And it was as though I had heard the echo of his
words.</p>

<p>I looked over to where he lay. He had been more akin to me than
my own brothers. I smiled at that, for they had never been akin to
me. To all but my soft-voiced, deep-bosomed, Norse mother I had
been a stranger in that severely conventional old house where I had
been born.</p>

<p>The youngest son, and an unwelcome intruder; a changeling. It
had been no fault of mine that I had come into the world a
throwback to my mother's yellow-haired, blue-eyed, strong-thewed
Viking forefathers. Not at all a Langdon. The Langdon men were dark
and slender, thin-lipped and saturnine. stamped out by the same die
for generations. They looked down at me, the changeling, from the
family portraits with faintly amused, supercilious hostility.
Precisely as my father and my four brothers, true Langdons, each of
them, looked at me when I awkwardly disposed of my bulk at their
table.</p>

<p>It had brought me unhappiness, but it had made my mother wrap
her heart around me. I wondered, as I had wondered many times, how
she had come to give herself to that dark, self-centered man my
father&mdash;with the blood of the sea-rovers singing in her veins.
It was she who had named me Leif&mdash; as incongruous a name to
tack on a Langdon as was my birth among them.</p>

<p>Jim and I had entered Dartmouth on the same day. I saw him as he
was then &mdash;the tall, brown lad with his hawk face and
inscrutable black eyes. pure blood of the Cherokees, of the clan
from which had come the great Sequoiah, a clan which had produced
through many centuries wisest councillors, warriors strong in
cunning.</p>

<p>On the college roster his name was written James T. Eagles, but
on the rolls of the Cherokee Nation it was written Two Eagles and
his mother had called him Tsantawu. From the first we had
recognized spiritual kinship. By the ancient rites of his people we
had become blood-brothers, and he had given me my secret name,
known only to the pair of us, Degataga&mdash;one who stands so
close to another that the two are one.</p>

<p>My one gift, besides my strength, is an aptness at languages.
Soon I spoke the Cherokee as though I had been born in the Nation.
Those years in college were the happiest I had ever known. It was
during the last of them that America entered the World War.
Together we had left Dartmouth, gone into training camp, sailed for
France on the same transport.</p>

<p>Sitting there, under the slow-growing Alaskan dawn, my mind
leaped over the years between...my mother's death on Armistice
Day...my return to New York to a frankly hostile home...Jim's
recall to his clan...the finishing of my course in mining
engineering...my wanderings in Asia...my second return to America
and my search for Jim...this expedition of ours to Alaska, more for
comradeship and the wilderness peace than for the gold we were
supposed to be seeking&mdash;</p>

<p>A long trail since the War&mdash;the happiest for me these last
two months of it. It had led us from Nome over the quaking tundras,
and then to the Koyukuk, and at last to this little camp among the
spruces, somewhere between the headwaters of the Koyukuk and the
Chandalar in the foothills of the unexplored Endicott Range. A long
trail...I had the feeling that it was here the real trail of my
life began.</p>

<p>A ray of the rising sun struck through the trees. Jim sat up,
looked over at me, and grinned.</p>

<p>"Didn't get much sleep after the concert, did you?"</p>

<p>"What did you do to the ancestors? They didn't seem to keep you
awake long."</p>

<p>He said, too carelessly: "Oh, they quieted down." His face and
eyes were expressionless. He was veiling his mind from me. The
ancestors had not quieted down. He had lain awake while I had
thought him sleeping. I made a swift decision. We would go south as
we had planned. I would go with him as far as Circle. I would find
some pretext to leave him there.</p>

<p>I said: "We're not going north. I've changed my mind."</p>

<p>"Yes. Why?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you after we've had breakfast," I said&mdash;I'm not
so quick in thinking up lies. "Rustle up a fire, Jim. I'll go down
to the stream and get some water."</p>

<p>"Degataga!"</p>

<p>I started. It was only in moments of rare sympathy or in time of
peril that he used the secret name.</p>

<p>"Degataga, you go north! You go if I have to march ahead of you
to make you follow..." he dropped into the Cherokee..."It is to
save your spirit, Degataga. Do we march
together&mdash;blood-brothers? Or do you creep after me&mdash;like
a shivering dog at the heels of the hunter?"</p>

<p>The blood pounded in my temples, my hand went out toward him. He
stepped back, and laughed.</p>

<p>"That's better, Leif."</p>

<p>The quick rage left me, my hand fell.</p>

<p>"All right, Tsantawu. We go&mdash;north. But it wasn't&mdash;it
wasn't because of myself that I told you I'd changed my mind."</p>

<p>"I know damned well it wasn't!"</p>

<p>He busied himself with the fire. I went after the water. We
drank the strong black tea, and ate what was left of the little
brown storks they call Alaskan turkeys which we had shot the day
before. When we were through I began to talk.</p>

<h2><a name="chap2" id="chap2"></a>2. &mdash; RING OF THE
KRAKEN</h2>

<p class="first">Three years ago, so I began my story, I went into
Mongolia with the Fairchild expedition. Part of its work was a
mineral survey for certain British interests, part of it
ethnographic and archeological research for the British Museum and
the University of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>I never had a chance to prove my value as a mining engineer. At
once I became good-will representative, camp entertainer, liaison
agent between us and the tribes. My height, my yellow hair, blue
eyes and freakish strength, and my facility in picking up languages
were of never-ending interest to them. Tartars, Mongols, Buriats,
Kirghiz&mdash;they would watch while I bent horseshoes, twisted
iron bars over my knees and performed what my father used to call
contemptuously my circus tricks.</p>

<p>Well, that's exactly what I was to them&mdash;a one-man circus.
And yet I was more than that&mdash;they liked me. Old Fairchild
would laugh when I complained that I had no time for technical
work. He would tell me that I was worth a dozen mining engineers,
that I was the expedition's insurance, and that as long as I could
keep up my act they wouldn't be bothered by any trouble-makers. And
it is a fact that they weren't. It was the only expedition of its
kind I ever knew where you could leave your stuff unwatched and
return to find it still there. Also we were singularly free from
graft and shake-downs.</p>

<p>In no time I had picked up half a dozen of the dialects and
could chatter and chaff with the tribesmen in their own tongues. It
made a prodigious hit with them. And now and then a Mongol
delegation would arrive with a couple of their wrestlers, big
fellows with chests like barrels, to pit against me. I learned
their tricks, and taught them ours. We had pony-lifting contests,
and some of my Manchu friends taught me how to fight with the two
broadswords &mdash;a sword in each hand.</p>

<p>Fairchild had planned on a year, but so smoothly did the days go
by that he decided to prolong our stay. My act, he told me in his
sardonic fashion, was undoubtedly of perennial vitality; never
again would science have such an opportunity in this
region&mdash;unless I made up my mind to remain and rule. He didn't
know how close he came to prophecy.</p>

<p>In the early summer of the following year we shifted our camp
about a hundred miles north. This was Uighur country. They are a
strange people, the Uighurs. They say of themselves that they are
descendants of a great race which ruled the Gobi when it was no
desert but an earthly Paradise, with flowing rivers and many lakes
and teeming cities. It is a fact that they are apart from all the
other tribes, and while those others cheerfully kill them when they
can, still they go in fear of them. Or rather, of the sorcery of
their priests.</p>

<p>Seldom had Uighurs appeared at the old camp. When they did, they
kept at a distance. We had been at the new camp less than a week
when a band of twenty rode in. I was sitting in the shade of my
tent. They dismounted and came straight to me. They paid no
attention to anyone else. They halted a dozen feet from me. Three
walked close up and stood, studying me. The eyes of these three
were a peculiar gray-blue; those of the one who seemed to be their
captain singularly cold. They were bigger, taller men than the
others.</p>

<p>I did not know the Uighur. I gave them polite salutations in the
Kirghiz. They did not answer, maintaining their close scrutiny.
Finally they spoke among themselves, nodding as though they had
come to some decision.</p>

<p>The leader then addressed me. As I stood up, I saw that he was
not many inches under my own six feet four. I told him, again in
the Kirghiz, that I did not know his tongue. He gave an order to
his men. They surrounded my tent, standing like guards, spears at
rest beside them, their wicked longswords drawn.</p>

<p>At this my temper began to rise, but before I could protest the
leader began to speak to me in the Kirghiz. He assured me, with
deference, that their visit was entirely peaceful, only they did
not wish their contact with me to be disturbed by any of my
companions. He asked if I would show him my hands. I held them out.
He and his two comrades bent over the palms, examining them
minutely, pointing to a mark or a crossing of lines. This
inspection ended, the leader touched his forehead with my right
hand.</p>

<p>And then to my complete astonishment, he launched without
explanation into what was a highly intelligent lesson in the Uighur
tongue. He took the Kirghiz for the comparative language. He did
not seem to be surprised at the ease with which I assimilated the
tuition; indeed, I had a puzzled idea that he regarded it as
something to be expected. I mean that his manner was less that of
teaching me a new language, than of recalling to me one I had
forgotten. The lesson lasted for a full hour. He then touched his
forehead again with my hand, and gave a command to the ring of
guards. The whole party walked to their horses and galloped
off.</p>

<p>There had been something disquieting about the whole experience.
Most disquieting was my own vague feeling that my tutor, if I had
read correctly his manner, had been right&mdash;that I was not
learning a new tongue but one I had forgotten. Certainly I never
picked up any language with such rapidity and ease as I did the
Uighur.</p>

<p>The rest of my party had been perplexed and apprehensive,
naturally. I went immediately to them, and talked the matter over.
Our ethnologist was the famous Professor David Barr, of Oxford.
Fairchild was inclined to take it as a joke, but Barr was greatly
disturbed. He said that the Uighur tradition was that their
forefathers had been a fair race, yellow-haired and blue-eyed, big
men of great strength. In short, men like myself. A few ancient
Uighur wall paintings had been found which had portrayed exactly
this type, so there was evidence of the correctness of the
tradition. However, if the Uighurs of the present were actually the
descendants of this race, the ancient blood must have been mixed
and diluted almost to the point of extinction.</p>

<p>I asked what this had to do with me, and he replied that quite
conceivably my visitors might regard me as of the pure blood of the
ancient race. In fact, he saw no other explanation of their
conduct. He was of the opinion that their study of my palms, and
their manifest approval of what they had discovered there, clinched
the matter.</p>

<p>Old Fairchild asked him, satirically, if he was trying to
convert us to palmistry. Barr said, coldly, that he was a
scientist. As a scientist, he was aware that certain physical
resemblances can be carried on by hereditary factors through many
generations. Certain peculiarities in the arrangement of the lines
of the palms might persist through centuries. They could reappear
in cases of atavism, such as I clearly represented.</p>

<p>By this time, I was getting a bit dizzy. But Barr had a few
shots left that made me more so. By now his temper was well up, and
he went on to say that the Uighurs might even be entirely correct
in what he deduced was their opinion of me. I was a throwback to
the ancient Norse. Very well. It was quite certain that the Aesir,
the old Norse gods and goddesses&mdash;Odin and Thor, Frigga and
Freya, Frey and Loki of the Fire and all the others &mdash;had once
been real people. Without question they had been leaders in some
long and perilous migration. After they had died, they had been
deified, as numerous other similar heroes and heroines had been by
other tribes and races. Ethnologists were agreed that the original
Norse stock had come into North-eastern Europe from Asia, like
other Aryans. Their migration might have occurred anywhere from
1000 B.C. to 5000 B.C. And there was no scientific reason why they
should not have come from the region now called the Gobi, nor why
they should not have been the blond race these present-day Uighurs
called their forefathers.</p>

<p>No one, he went on to say, knew exactly when the Gobi had become
desert &mdash;nor what were the causes that had changed it into
desert. Parts of the Gobi and all the Little Gobi might have been
fertile as late as two thousand years ago. Whatever it had been,
whatever its causes, and whether operating slowly or quickly, the
change gave a perfect reason for the migration led by Odin and the
other Aesir which had ended in the colonization of the Scandinavian
Peninsula. Admittedly I was a throwback to my mother's stock of a
thousand years ago. There was no reason why I should not also be a
throwback in other recognizable ways to the ancient
Uighurs&mdash;if they actually were the original Norse.</p>

<p>But the practical consideration was that I was headed for
trouble. So was every other member of our party. He urgently
advised going back to the old camp where we would be among friendly
tribes. In conclusion he pointed out that, since we had come to
this site, not a single Mongol, Tartar or any other tribesman with
whom I had established such pleasant relations had come near us. He
sat down with a glare at Fairchild, observing that this was no
palmist's advice but that of a recognized scientist.</p>

<p>Well, Fairchild apologized, of course, but he overruled Barr on
returning; we could safely wait a few days longer and see what
developed. Barr remarked morosely that as a prophet Fairchild was
probably a total loss, but it was also probable that we were being
closely watched and would not be allowed to retreat, and therefore
it did not matter...</p>

<p>That night we heard drums beating far away, drumming between
varying intervals of silence almost until dawn, reporting and
answering questions of drums still further off.</p>

<p>The next day, at the same hour, along came the same troop. Their
leader made straight for me, ignoring, as before, the others in the
camp. He saluted me almost with humility. We walked back together
to my tent. Again the cordon was thrown round it, and my second
lesson abruptly began. It continued for two hours or more.
Thereafter, day after day, for three weeks, the same performance
was repeated. There was no desultory conversation, no extraneous
questioning, no explanations. These men were there for one definite
purpose: to teach me their tongue. They stuck to that admirably.
Filled with curiosity, eager to reach the end and learn what it all
meant, I interposed no obstacles, stuck as rigorously as they to
the matter in hand. This, too, they seemed to take as something
expected of me. In three weeks I could carry on a conversation in
the Uighur as well as I can in English.</p>

<p>Barr's uneasiness kept growing. "They're grooming you for
something!" he would say. "I'd give five years of my life to be in
your shoes. But I don't like it. I'm afraid for you. I'm damned
afraid!"</p>

<p>One night at the end of this third week, the signalling drums
beat until dawn. The next day my instructors did not appear, nor
the next day, nor the day after. But our men reported that there
were Uighurs all around us, picketing the camp. They were in fear,
and no work could be got out of them.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the fourth day we saw a cloud of dust
drifting rapidly down upon us from the north. Soon we heard the
sound of the Uighur drums. Then out of the dust emerged a troop of
horsemen. There were two or three hundred of them, spears glinting,
many of them with good rifles. They drew up in a wide semi-circle
before the camp. The cold-eyed leader who had been my chief
instructor dismounted and came forward leading a magnificent black
stallion. A big horse, a strong horse, unlike the rangy horses that
carried them; a horse that could bear my weight with ease.</p>

<p>The Uighur dropped on one knee, handing me the stallion's reins,
I took them, automatically. The horse looked me over, sniffed at
me, and rested its nose on my shoulder. At once the troop raised
their spears, shouting some word I could not catch, then dropped
from their mounts and stood waiting.</p>

<p>The leader arose. He drew from his tunic a small cube of ancient
jade. He sank again upon his knee, handed me the cube. It seemed
solid, but as I pressed it flew open. Within, was a ring. It was of
heavy gold, thick and wide. Set in it was a yellow, translucent
stone about an inch and a half square. And within this stone was
the shape of a black octopus.</p>

<p>Its tentacles spread out fan-wise from its body. They had the
effect of reaching forward through the yellow stone. I could even
see upon their nearer tips the sucking discs. The body was not so
clearly defined. It was nebulous, seeming to reach into far
distance. The black octopus had not been cut upon the jewel. It was
within it.</p>

<p>I was aware of a curious mingling of feelings&mdash;repulsion
and a peculiar sense of familiarity, like the trick of the mind
that causes what we call double memory, the sensation of having
experienced the same thing before. Without thinking. I slipped the
ring over my thumb which it fitted perfectly, and held it up to the
sun to catch the light through the stone. Instantly every man of
the troop threw himself down upon his belly, prostrating himself
before it.</p>

<p>The Uighur captain spoke to me. I had been subconsciously aware
that from the moment of handing me the jade he had been watching me
closely. I thought that now there was awe in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Your horse is ready&mdash;" again he used the unfamiliar word
with which the troop had saluted me. "Show me what you wish to take
with you, and your men shall carry it."</p>

<p>"Where do we go&mdash;and for how long?" I asked.</p>

<p>"To a holy man of your people," he answered. "For how
long&mdash;he alone can answer."</p>

<p>I felt a momentary irritation at the casualness with which I was
being disposed of. Also I wondered why he spoke of his men and his
people as mine.</p>

<p>"Why does he not come to me?" I asked.</p>

<p>"He is old," he answered. "He could not make the journey."</p>

<p>I looked at the troop, now standing up beside their horses. If I
refused to go, it would undoubtedly mean the wiping out of the camp
if my companions attempted, as they would, to resist my taking.
Besides, I was on fire with curiosity.</p>

<p>"I must speak to my comrades before I go," I said.</p>

<p>"If it please Dwayanu"&mdash;this time I caught the
word&mdash;"to bid farewell to his dogs, let him." There was a
nicker of contempt in his eyes as he looked at old Fairchild and
the others.</p>

<p>Definitely I did not like what he had said, nor his manner.</p>

<p>"Await me here," I told him curtly, and walked over to
Fairchild. I drew him into his tent, Barr and the others of the
expedition at our heels. I told them what was happening. Barr took
my hand, and scrutinized the ring. He whistled softly.</p>

<p>"Don't you know what this is?" he asked me. "It's the
Kraken&mdash;that super-wise, malignant and mythical sea-monster of
the old Norsemen. See, its tentacles are not eight but twelve.
Never was it pictured with less than ten. It symbolized the
principle that is inimical to Life&mdash;not Death precisely, more
accurately annihilation. The Kraken&mdash;and here in
Mongolia!"</p>

<p>"See here. Chief," I spoke to Fairchild. "There's only one way
you can help me&mdash;if I need help. And that's to get back quick
as you can to the old camp. Get hold of the Mongols and send word
to that chief who kept bringing in the big wrestlers&mdash;they'll
know whom I mean. Persuade or hire him to get as many able fighting
men at the camp as you can. I'll be back, but I'll probably come
back running. Outside of that, you're all in danger. Not at the
moment, maybe, but things may develop which will make these people
think it better to wipe you out. I know what I'm talking about.
Chief. I ask you to do this for my sake, if not for your own."</p>

<p>"But they watch the camp&mdash;" he began to object.</p>

<p>"They won't&mdash;after I've gone. Not for a little while at
least. Everyone of them will be streaking away with me." I spoke
with complete certainty, and Barr nodded acquiescence.</p>

<p>"The King returns to his Kingdom," he said. "All his loyal
subjects with him. He's in no danger&mdash;while he's with them.
But&mdash;God, if I could only go with you, Leif! The Kraken! And
the ancient legend of the South Seas told of the Great Octopus,
dozing on and biding his time till he felt like destroying the
world and all its life. And three miles up in the air the Black
Octopus is cut into the cliffs of the Andes! Norsemen&mdash;and the
South Sea Islanders&mdash;and the Andeans! And the same
symbol&mdash; here!"</p>

<p>"Please promise?" I asked Fairchild. "My life may depend on
it."</p>

<p>"It's like abandoning you. I don't like it!"</p>

<p>"Chief, this crowd could wipe you out in a minute. Go back, and
get the Mongols. The Tartars will help. They hate the Uighurs. I'll
come back, don't fear. But I'd bet everything that this whole
crowd, and more, will be at my heels. When I come, I want a wall to
duck behind."</p>

<p>"We'll go," he said.</p>

<p>I went out of that tent, and over to my own. The odd-eyed Uighur
followed me. I took my rifle and an automatic, stuffed a toothbrush
and a shaving-kit in my pocket, and turned to go.</p>

<p>"Is there nothing else?" There was surprise in his question.</p>

<p>"If there is, I'll come back for it," I answered.</p>

<p>"Not after you have&mdash;remembered," he said,
enigmatically.</p>

<p>Side by side we walked to the black stallion. I lifted myself to
his back.</p>

<p>The troop wheeled in behind us. Their spears a barrier between
me and the camp, we galloped south.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap3" id="chap3"></a>3. &mdash; RITUAL OF
KHALK'RU</h2>

<p class="first">The stallion settled down to a steady, swinging
lope. He carried my weight easily. About an hour from dusk we were
over the edge of the desert. At our right loomed a low range of red
sandstone hills Close ahead was a defile. We rode into it, and
picked our way through it. In about half an hour we emerged into a
boulder-strewn region, upon what had once been a wide road. The
road stretched straight ahead of us to the north-east, toward
another and higher range of red sandstone, perhaps five miles away.
This we reached just as night began, and here my guide halted,
saying that we would encamp until dawn. Some twenty of the troop
dismounted; the rest rode on.</p>

<p>Those who remained waited, looking at me, plainly expectant. I
wondered what I was supposed to do; then, noticing that the
stallion had been sweating, I called for something to rub him down,
and for food and water for him. This, apparently, was what had been
looked for. The captain himself brought me the cloths, grain and
water while the men whispered. After the horse was cooled down, I
fed him. I then asked for blankets to put on him, for the nights
were cold. When I had finished I found that supper had been
prepared. I sat beside a fire with the leader. I was hungry, and,
as usual when it was possible, I ate voraciously. I asked few
questions, and most of these were answered so evasively, with such
obvious reluctance, that I soon asked none. When the supper was
over, I was sleepy. I said so. I was given blankets, and walked
over to the stallion. I spread my blankets beside him, dropped, and
rolled myself up.</p>

<p>The stallion bent his head, nosed me gently, blew a long breath
down my neck, and lay down carefully beside me. I shifted so that I
could rest my head on his neck. I heard excited whispering among
the Uighurs. I went to sleep.</p>

<p>At dawn I was awakened. Breakfast was ready. We set out again on
the ancient road. It ran along the hills, skirting the bed of what
had long ago been a large river. For some time the eastern hills
protected us from the sun. When it began to strike directly down
upon us, we rested under the shadow of some immense rocks. By
mid-afternoon we were once more on our way. Shortly before sundown,
we crossed the dry river bed over what had once been a massive
bridge. We passed into another defile through which the long-gone
stream had flowed, and just at dusk reached its end.</p>

<p>Each side of the end of the shallow gorge was commanded by stone
forts. They were manned by dozens of the Uighurs. They shouted as
we drew near, and again I heard the word "Dwayanu" repeated again
and again.</p>

<p>The heavy gates of the right-hand fort swung open. We went
through, into a passage under the thick wall. We trotted across a
wide enclosure. We passed out of it through similar gates.</p>

<p>I looked upon an oasis hemmed in by the bare mountains. It had
once been the site of a fair-sized city, for ruins dotted it
everywhere. What had possibly been the sources of the river had
dwindled to a brook which sunk into the sands not far from where I
stood. At the right of this brook there was vegetation and trees;
to the left of it was a desolation. The road passed through the
oasis and ran on across this barren. It stopped at, or entered, a
huge square-cut opening in the rock wall more than a mile away, an
opening that was like a door in that mountain, or like the entrance
to some gigantic Egyptian tomb.</p>

<p>We rode straight down into the fertile side. There were hundreds
of the ancient stone buildings here, and fair attempts had been
made to keep some in repair. Even so, their ancientness struck
against my nerves. There were tents among the trees also. And out
of the buildings and tents were pouring Uighurs, men, women and
children. There must have been a thousand of the warriors alone.
Unlike the men at the guardhouses, these watched me in awed silence
as I passed.</p>

<p>We halted in front of a time-bitten pile that might have been a
palace &mdash;five thousand years or twice that ago. Or a temple. A
colonnade of squat, square columns ran across its front. Heavier
ones stood at its entrance. Here we dismounted. The stallion and my
guide's horse were taken by our escort. Bowing low at the
threshold, my guide invited me to enter.</p>

<p>I stepped into a wide corridor, lined with spearsmen and lighted
by torches of some resinous wood. The Uighur leader walked beside
me. The corridor led into a huge room&mdash;high-ceilinged, so wide
and long that the flambeaux on the walls made its center seem the
darker. At the far end of this place was a low dais, and upon it a
stone table, and seated at this table were a number of hooded
men.</p>

<p>As I drew nearer, I felt the eyes of these hooded men intent
upon me, and saw that they were thirteen&mdash;six upon each side
and one seated in a larger chair at the table's end. High cressets
of metal stood about them in which burned some substance that gave
out a steady, clear white light. I came close, and halted. My guide
did not speak. Nor did these others.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the light glinted upon the ring on my thumb.</p>

<p>The hooded man at the table's end stood up, gripping its edge
with trembling hands that were like withered claws. I heard him
whisper&mdash; "Dwayanu!"</p>

<p>The hood slipped back from his head. I saw an old, old face in
which were eyes almost as blue as my own, and they were filled with
stark wonder and avid hope. It touched me, for it was the look of a
man long lost to despair who sees a savior appear.</p>

<p>Now the others arose, slipped back their hoods. They were old
men, all of them, but not so old as he who had whispered. Their
eyes of cold blue-gray weighed me. The high priest, for that I so
guessed him and such he turned out to be, spoke again:</p>

<p>"They told me&mdash;but I could not believe! Will you come to
me?"</p>

<p>I jumped on the dais and walked to him. He drew his old face
close to mine, searching my eyes. He touched my hair. He thrust his
hand within my shirt and laid it on my heart. He said:</p>

<p>"Let me see your hands."</p>

<p>I placed them, palms upward, on the table. He gave them the same
minute scrutiny as had the Uighur leader. The twelve others
clustered round, following his fingers as be pointed to this
marking and to that. He lifted from his neck a chain of golden
links, drawing from beneath his robe a large, flat square of jade.
He opened this. Within it was a yellow stone, larger than that in
my ring, but otherwise precisely similar, the black octopus
&mdash;or the Kraken&mdash;writhing from its depths. Beside it was
a small phial of jade and a small, lancet-like jade knife. He took
my right hand, and brought the wrist over the yellow stone. He
looked at me and at the others with eyes in which was agony.</p>

<p>"The last test." he whispered. "The blood!"</p>

<p>He nicked a vein of my wrist with the knife. Blood fell, slow
drop by drop upon the stone; I saw then that it was slightly
concave. As the blood dripped, it spread like a thin film from
bottom to lip. The old priest lifted the phial of jade, unstoppered
it, and by what was plainly violent exercise of his will, held it
steadily over the yellow stone. One drop of colorless fluid fell
and mingled with my blood.</p>

<p>The room was now utterly silent, high priest and his ministers
seemed not to breathe, staring at the stone. I shot a glance at the
Uighur leader, and he was glaring at me, fanatic fires in his
eyes.</p>

<p>There was an exclamation from the high priest, echoed by the
others. I looked down at the stone. The pinkish film was changing
color. A curious sparkle ran through it; it changed into a film of
clear, luminous green.</p>

<p>"Dwayanu!" gasped the high priest, and sank back into his chair,
covering his face with shaking hands. The others stared at me and
back at the stone and at me again as though they beheld some
miracle. I looked at the Uighur leader. He lay flat upon his face
at the base of the dais.</p>

<p>The high priest uncovered his face. It seemed to me that he had
become incredibly younger, transformed; his eyes were no longer
hopeless, agonized; they were filled with eagerness. He arose from
his chair, and sat me in it.</p>

<p>"Dwayanu," he said, "what do you remember?"</p>

<p>I shook my head, puzzled; it was an echo of the Uighur's remark
at the camp.</p>

<p>"What should I remember?" I asked.</p>

<p>His gaze withdrew from me, sought the faces of the others,
questioningly; as though he had spoken to them, they looked at one
another, then nodded. He shut the jade case and thrust it into his
breast. He took my hand, twisted the bezel of the ring behind my
thumb and closed my hand on it.</p>

<p>"Do you remember&mdash;" his voice sank to the faintest of
whispers &mdash;"Khalk'ru?"</p>

<p>Again the stillness dropped upon the great chamber&mdash;this
time like a tangible thing. I sat, considering. There was something
familiar about that name. I had an irritated feeling that I ought
to know it; that if I tried hard enough, I could remember it; that
memory of it was just over the border of consciousness. Also I had
the feeling that it meant something rather dreadful. Something
better forgotten. I felt vague stirrings of repulsion, coupled with
sharp resentment.</p>

<p>"No," I answered.</p>

<p>I heard the sound of sharply exhaled breaths. The old priest
walked behind me and placed his hands over my eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you remember&mdash;this?"</p>

<p>My mind seemed to blur, and then I saw a picture as clearly as
though I were looking at it with my open eyes. I was galloping
through the oasis straight to the great doorway in the mountain.
Only now it was no oasis. It was a city with gardens, and a river
ran sparkling through it. The ranges were not barren red sandstone,
but green with trees. There were others with me, galloping behind
me&mdash;men and women like myself, fair and strong. Now I was
close to the doorway. There were immense square stone columns
flanking it...and now I had dismounted from my horse...a great
black stallion...I was entering...</p>

<p>I would not enter! If I entered, I would
remember&mdash;Khalk'ru! I thrust myself back...and out...I felt
hands over my eyes...I reached and tore them away...the old
priest's hands. I jumped from the chair, quivering with anger. I
faced him. His face was benign, his voice gentle.</p>

<p>"Soon," he said, "you will remember more!"</p>

<p>I did not answer, struggling to control my inexplicable rage. Of
course, the old priest had tried to hypnotize me; what I had seen
was what he had willed me to see. Not without reason had the
priests of the Uighurs gained their reputation as sorcerers. But it
was not that which had stirred this wrath that took all my will to
keep from turning berserk. No, it had been something about that
name of Khalk'ru. Something that lay behind the doorway in the
mountain through which I had almost been forced.</p>

<p>"Are you hungry?" The abrupt transition to the practical in the
old priest's question brought me back to normal. I laughed
outright, and told him that I was, indeed. And getting sleepy. I
had feared that such an important personage as I had apparently
become would have to dine with the high priest. I was relieved when
he gave me in charge of the Uighur captain. The Uighur followed me
out like a dog, he kept his eyes upon me like a dog upon its
master, and he waited on me like a servant while I ate. I told him
I would rather sleep in a tent than in one of the stone houses. His
eyes flashed at that, and for the first time he spoke other than in
respectful monosyllables.</p>

<p>"Still a warrior!" he grunted approvingly. A tent was set up for
me. Before I went to sleep I peered through the flap. The Uighur
leader was squatting at the opening, and a double ring of spearsmen
stood shoulder to shoulder on guard.</p>

<p>Early next morning, a delegation of the lesser priests called
for me. We went into the same building, but to a much smaller room,
bare of all furnishings. The high priest and the rest of the lesser
priests were awaiting me. I had expected many questions. He asked
me none; he had, apparently, no curiosity as to my origin, where I
had come from, nor how I had happened to be in Mongolia. It seemed
to be enough that they had proved me to be who they had hoped me to
be&mdash;whoever that was. Furthermore, I had the strongest
impression that they were anxious to hasten on to the consummation
of a plan that had begun with my lessons. The high priest west
straight to the point.</p>

<p>"Dwayanu," he said, "we would recall to your memory a certain
ritual. Listen carefully, watch carefully, repeat faithfully each
inflection, each gesture."</p>

<p>"To what purpose?" I asked.</p>

<p>"That you shall learn&mdash;" he began, then interrupted himself
fiercely. "No! I will tell you now! So that this which is desert
shall once more become fertile. That the Uighurs shall recover
their greatness. That the ancient sacrilege against Khalk'ru, whose
fruit was the desert, shall be expiated!"</p>

<p>"What have I, a stranger, to do with all this?" I asked.</p>

<p>"We to whom you have come," he answered, "have not enough of the
ancient blood to bring this about. You are no stranger. You are
Dwayanu&mdash;the Releaser. You are of the pure blood. Because of
that, only you&mdash; Dwayanu&mdash;can lift the doom."</p>

<p>I thought how delighted Barr would be to hear that explanation;
how he would crow over Fairchild. I bowed to the old priest, and
told him I was ready. He took from my thumb the ring, lifted the
chain and its pendent jade from his neck, and told me to strip.
While I was doing so, he divested himself of his own robes, and the
others followed suit. A priest carried the things away, quickly
returning. I looked at the shrunken shapes of the old men standing
mother-naked round me, and suddenly lost all desire to laugh. The
proceedings were being touched by the sinister. The lesson
began.</p>

<p>It was not a ritual; it was an invocation&mdash;rather, it was
an evocation of a Being, Power, Force, named Khalk'ru. It was
exceedingly curious, and so were the gestures that accompanied it.
It was dearly couched in the archaic form of the Uighur. There were
many words I did not understand. Obviously, it had been passed down
from high priest to high priest from remote antiquity. Even an
indifferent churchman would have considered it blasphemous to the
point of damnation. I was too much interested to think much of that
phase of it. I had the same odd sense of familiarity with it that I
had felt at the first naming of Khalk'ru. I felt none of the
repulsion, however. I felt strongly in earnest. How much this was
due to the force of the united wills of the twelve priests who
never took their eyes off me, I do not know.</p>

<p>I won't repeat it, except to give the gist of it. Khalk'ru was
the Beginning-without-Beginning, as he would be the
End-without-End. He was the Lightless Timeless Void. The Destroyer.
The Eater-up of Life. The Annihilator. The Dissolver. He was not
Death&mdash;Death was only a part of him. He was alive, very much
so, but his quality of living was the antithesis of Life as we know
it. Life was an invader, troubling Khalk'ru's ageless calm. Gods
and man, animals and birds and all creatures, vegetation and water
and air and fire, sun and stars and moon&mdash;all were his to
dissolve into Himself, the Living Nothingness, if he so willed. But
let them go on a little longer. Why should Khalk'ru care when in
the end there would be only &mdash;Khalk'ru! Let him withdraw from
the barren places so life could enter and cause them to blossom
again; let him touch only those who were the enemies of his
worshipers, so that his worshipers would be great and powerful,
evidence that Khalk'ru was the All in All. It was only for a breath
in the span of his eternity. Let Khalk'ru make himself manifest in
the form of his symbol and take what was offered him as evidence he
had listened and consented.</p>

<p>There was more, much more, but that was the gist of it. A
dreadful prayer, but I felt no dread&mdash;then.</p>

<p>Three times, and I was letter-perfect. The high priest gave me
one more rehearsal and nodded to the priest who had taken away the
clothing. He went out and returned with the robes&mdash;but not my
clothes. Instead, he produced a long white mantle and a pair of
sandals. I asked for my own clothes and was told by the old priest
that I no longer needed them, that hereafter I would be dressed as
befitted me. I agreed that this was desirable, but said I would
like to have them so I could look at them once in a while. To this
he acquiesced.</p>

<p>They took me to another room. Faded, ragged tapestries hung on
its walls. They were threaded with scenes of the hunt and of war.
There were oddly shaped stools and chairs of some metal that might
have been copper but also might have been gold, a wide and low
divan, in one corner spears, a bow and two swords, a shield and a
cap-shaped bronze helmet. Everything, except the rugs spread over
the stone floor, had the appearance of great antiquity. Here I was
washed and carefully shaved and my long hair trimmed&mdash;a
ceremonial cleansing accompanied by rites of purification which, at
times, were somewhat startling.</p>

<p>These ended, I was given a cotton undergarment which sheathed me
from toes to neck. After this, a pair of long, loose, girdled
trousers that seemed spun of threads of gold reduced by some
process to the softness of silk. I noticed with amusement that they
had been carefully repaired and patched. I wondered how many
centuries the man who had first worn them had been dead. There was
a long, blouse-like coat of the same material, and my feet were
slipped into cothurns, or high buskins, whose elaborate embroidery
was a bit ragged.</p>

<p>The old priest placed the ring on my thumb, and stood back,
staring at me raptly. Quite evidently he saw nothing of the ravages
of time upon my garments.</p>

<p>I was to him the splendid figure from the past that he thought
me.</p>

<p>"So did you appear when our race was great," he said. "And soon,
when it has recovered a little of its greatness, we shall bring
back those who still dwell in the Shadowed-land."</p>

<p>"The Shadowed-land?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It is far to the East, over the Great Water," he said. "But we
know they dwell there, those of Khalk'ru who fled at the time of
the great sacrilege which changed fecund Uighurland into desert.
They will be of the pure blood like yourself, Dwayanu, and you
shall find mates among the women. And in time, we of the thinned
blood shall pass away, and Uighurland again be peopled by its
ancient race."</p>

<p>He walked abruptly away, the lesser priests following. At the
door he turned.</p>

<p>"Wait here," he said, "until the word comes from me."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap4" id="chap4"></a>4. &mdash; TENTACLE OF
KHALK'RU</h2>

<p class="first">I waited for an hour, examining the curious
contents of the room, and amusing myself with shadow-fencing with
the two swords. I swung round to find the Uighur captain watching
me from the doorway, pale eyes glowing.</p>

<p>"By Zarda!" he said. "Whatever you have forgotten, it is not
your sword play! A warrior you left us, a warrior you have
returned!"</p>

<p>He dropped upon a knee, bent his head: "Pardon, Dwayanu! I have
been sent for you. It is time to go."</p>

<p>A heady exaltation began to take me. I dropped the swords, and
clapped him on the shoulder. He took it like an accolade. We passed
through the corridor of the spearsmen and over the threshold of the
great doorway. There was a thunderous shout.</p>

<p>"Dwayanu!"</p>

<p>And then a blaring of trumpets, a mighty roll of drums and the
clashing of cymbals.</p>

<p>Drawn up in front of the palace was a hollow square of Uighur
horsemen, a full five hundred of them, spears glinting, pennons
flying from their shafts. Within the square, in ordered ranks, were
as many more. But now I saw that these were both men and women,
clothed in garments as ancient as those I wore, and shimmering in
the strong sunlight like a vast multicolored rug of metal threads.
Banners and bannerets, torn and tattered and bearing strange
symbols, fluttered from them. At the far edge of the square I
recognized the old priest, his lesser priests flanking him, mounted
and clad in the yellow. Above them streamed a yellow banner, and as
the wind whipped it straight, black upon it appeared the shape of
the Kraken. Beyond the square of horsemen, hundreds of the Uighurs
pressed for a glimpse of me. As I stood there, blinking, another
shout mingled with the roll of the Uighur drums.</p>

<p>"The King returns to his people!" Barr had said. Well, it was
like that.</p>

<p>A soft nose nudged me. Beside me was the black stallion. I
mounted him. The Uighur captain at my heels, we trotted down the
open way between the ordered ranks. I looked at them as I went by.
All of them, men and women, had the pale blue-gray eyes; each of
them was larger than the run of the race. I thought that these were
the nobles, the pick of the ancient families, those in whom the
ancient blood was strongest. Their tattered banners bore the
markings of their clans. There was exultation in the eyes of the
men. Before I had reached the priests. I had read terror in the
eyes of many of the women.</p>

<p>I reached the old priest. The line of horsemen ahead of us
parted. We two rode through the gap, side by side. The lesser
priests fell in behind us. The nobles followed them. A long thin
line upon each side of the cavalcade, the Uighur horsemen
trotted&mdash;with the Uighur trumpets blaring, the Uighur
kettle-drums and long-drums beating, the Uighur cymbals crashing,
in wild triumphal rhythms.</p>

<p>"The King returns&mdash;"</p>

<p>I would so that something had sent me then straight upon the
Uighur spears!</p>

<p>We trotted through the green of the oasis. We crossed a wide
bridge which had spanned the little stream when it had been a
mighty river. We set our horses' feet upon the ancient road that
led straight to the mountain's doorway a mile or more away. The
heady exultation grew within me. I looked back at my company. And
suddenly I remembered the repairs and patches on my breeches and my
blouse. And my following was touched with the same shabbiness. It
made me feel less a king, but it also made me pitiful. I saw them
as men and women driven by hungry ghosts in their thinned blood,
ghosts of strong ancestors growing weak as the ancient blood
weakened, starving as it weakened, but still strong enough to
clamor against extinction, still strong enough to command their
brains and wills and drive them toward something the ghosts
believed would feed their hunger, make them strong again.</p>

<p>Yes, I pitied them. It was nonsense to think I could appease the
hunger of their ghosts, but there was one thing I could do for
them. I could give them a damned good show! I went over in my mind
the ritual the old priest had taught me, rehearsed each
gesture.</p>

<p>I looked up to find we were at the threshold of the mountain
door. It was wide enough for twenty horsemen to ride through
abreast. The squat columns I had seen, under the touch of the old
priest's hands, lay shattered beside it. I felt no repulsion, no
revolt against entering, as I then had. I was eager to be in and to
be done with it.</p>

<p>The spearsmen trotted up, and formed a guard beside the opening.
I dismounted and handed one of them the stallion's rein. The old
priest beside me, the lesser ones behind us, we passed over the
threshold of the mined doorway, and into the mountain. The passage,
or vestibule, was lighted by wall cressets in which burned the
clear, white flame. A hundred paces from the entrance, another
passage opened, piercing inward at an angle of about fifteen
degrees to the wider one. Into this the old priest turned. I
glanced back. The nobles had not yet entered; I could see them
dismounting at the entrance. We went along this passage in silence
for perhaps a thousand feet. It opened into a small square chamber,
cut in the red sandstone, at whose side was another door, covered
with heavy tapestries. In this chamber was nothing except a number
of stone coffers of various sizes ranged along its walls.</p>

<p>The old priest opened one of these. Within it was a wooden box,
gray with age. He lifted its lid, and took from it two yellow
garments. He slipped one of these garments over my head. It was
like a smock, falling to my knees. I glanced down; woven within it,
its tentacles encircling me, was the black octopus.</p>

<p>The other he drew over his own head. It, too, bore the octopus,
but only on the breast, the tentacles did not embrace him. He bent
and took from the coffer a golden staff, across the end of which
ran bars. From these fell loops of small golden bells.</p>

<p>From the other coffers the lesser priests had taken drums,
queerly shaped oval instruments some three feet long, with sides of
sullen red metal. They sat, rolling the drumheads under their
thumbs, tightening them here and there while the old priest gently
shook his staff of bells, testing their chiming. They were for all
the world like an orchestra tuning up. I again felt a desire to
laugh;</p>

<p>I did not then know how the commonplace can intensify the
terrible.</p>

<p>There were sounds outside the tapestried doorway, rustlings.
There were three clangorous strokes like a hammer upon an anvil.
Then silence. The twelve priests walked through the doorway with
their drums in their arms. The high priest beckoned me to follow
him, and we passed through after them.</p>

<p>I looked out upon an immense cavern, cut from the living rock by
the hands of men dust now for thousands of years. It told its
immemorial antiquity as clearly as though the rocks had tongue. It
was more than ancient; it was primeval. It was dimly lighted, so
dimly that hardly could I see the Uighur nobles. They were
standing, the banners of their clans above them, their faces turned
up to me, upon the stone floor, a hundred yards or so away, and ten
feet below me. Beyond them and behind them the cavern extended,
vanishing in darkness. I saw that in front of them was a curving
trough, wide&mdash; like the trough between two long
waves&mdash;and that like a wave it swept upward from the hither
side of the trough, curving, its lip crested, as though that wave
of sculptured stone were a gigantic comber rushing back upon them.
This lip formed the edge of the raised place on which I stood.</p>

<p>The high priest touched my arm. I turned my head to him, and
followed his eyes. A hundred feet away from me stood a girl. She
was naked. She had not long entered womanhood and quite plainly was
soon to be a mother. Her eyes were as blue as those of the old
priest, her hair was reddish brown, touched with gold, her skin was
palest olive. The blood of the old fair race was strong within her.
For all she held herself so bravely, there was terror in her eyes,
and the rapid rise and fall of her rounded breasts further revealed
that terror.</p>

<p>She stood in a small hollow. Around her waist was a golden ring,
and from that ring dropped three golden chains fastened to the rock
floor. I recognized their purpose. She could not run, and if she
dropped or fell, she could not writhe away, out of the cup. But
run, or writhe away from what? Certainly not from me! I looked at
her and smiled. Her eyes searched mine. The terror suddenly fled
from them. She smiled back at me, trustingly.</p>

<p>God forgive me&mdash;I smiled at her and she trusted me! I
looked beyond her, from whence had come a glitter of yellow like a
flash from a huge topaz. Up from the rock a hundred yards behind
the girl jutted an immense fragment of the same yellow translucent
stone that formed the jewel in my ring. It was like the fragment of
a gigantic shattered pane. Its shape was roughly triangular. Black
within it was a tentacle of the Kraken. The tentacle swung down
within the yellow stone, broken from the monstrous body when the
stone had been broken. It was all of fifty feet long. Its inner
side was turned toward me, and plain upon all its length clustered
the hideous sucking discs.</p>

<p>Well, it was ugly enough&mdash;but nothing to be afraid of, I
thought. I smiled again at the chained girl, and met once more her
look of utter trust.</p>

<p>The old priest had been watching me closely. We walked forward
until we were half-way between the edge and the girl. At the lip
squatted the twelve lesser priests, their drums on their laps.</p>

<p>The old priest and I faced the girl and the broken tentacle. He
raised his staff of golden bells and shook them. From the darkness
of the cavern began a low chanting, a chant upon three minor
themes, repeated and repeated, and intermingled.</p>

<p>It was as primeval as the cavern; it was the voice of the cavern
itself.</p>

<p>The girl never took her eyes from me.</p>

<p>The chanting ended. I raised my hands and made the curious
gestures of salutation I had been taught. I began the ritual to
Khalk'ru...</p>

<p>With the first words, the odd feeling of recognition swept over
me&mdash; with something added. The words, the gestures, were
automatic. I did not have to exert any effort of memory; they
remembered themselves. I no longer saw the chained girl. All I saw
was the black tentacle in the shattered stone.</p>

<p>On swept the ritual and on...was the yellow stone dissolving
from around the tentacle...was the tentacle swaying?</p>

<p>Desperately I tried to halt the words, the gesturing. I could
not!</p>

<p>Something stronger than myself possessed me, moving my muscles,
speaking from my throat. I had a sense of inhuman power. On to the
climax of the evil evocation&mdash;and now I knew how utterly evil
it was&mdash;the ritual rushed, while I seemed to stand apart,
helpless to check it.</p>

<p>It ended.</p>

<p>And the tentacle quivered...it writhed...it reached outward to
the chained girl...</p>

<p>There was a devil's roll of drums, rushing up fast and ever
faster to a thunderous crescendo...</p>

<p>The girl was still looking at me...but the trust was gone from
her eyes...her face reflected the horror stamped upon my own.</p>

<p>The black tentacle swung up and out!</p>

<p>I had a swift vision of a vast cloudy body from which other
cloudy tentacles writhed. A breath that had in it the cold of outer
space touched me.</p>

<p>The black tentacle coiled round the girl...</p>

<p>She screamed&mdash;inhumanly...she faded...she dissolved...her
screaming faded...her screaming became a small shrill agonized
piping...a sigh.</p>

<p>I heard the dash of metal from where the girl had stood. The
clashing of the golden chains and girdle that had held her, falling
empty on the rock.</p>

<p>The girl was gone!</p>

<p>I stood, nightmare horror such as I had never known in worst of
nightmares paralyzing me&mdash;</p>

<p>The child had trusted me...I had smiled at her, and she had
trusted me... and I had summoned the Kraken to destroy her!</p>

<p>Searing remorse, white hot rage, broke the chains that held me.
I saw the fragment of yellow stone in its place, the black tentacle
inert within it. At my feet lay the old priest, flat on his face,
his withered body shaking; his withered hands clawing at the rock.
Beside their drums lay the lesser priests, and flat upon the floor
of the cavern were the nobles&mdash; prostrate, abased, blind and
deaf in stunned worship of that dread Thing I had summoned.</p>

<p>I ran to the tapestried doorway. I had but one desire&mdash;to
get out of the temple of Khalk'ru. Out of the lair of the Kraken.
To get far and far away from it. To get back...back to the
camp&mdash;home. I ran through the little room, through the
passages and, still running, reached the entrance to the temple. I
stood there for an instant, dazzled by the sunlight.</p>

<p>There was a roaring shout from hundreds of throats&mdash;then
silence. My sight cleared. They lay there, in the dust, prostrate
before me&mdash; the troops of the Uighur spearsmen.</p>

<p>I looked for the black stallion. He was close beside me. I
sprang upon his back, gave him the reins. He shot forward like a
black thunderbolt through the prostrate ranks, and down the road to
the oasis. We raced through the oasis. I bad vague glimpses of
running crowds, shouting. None tried to stop me. None could have
stayed the rush of that great horse.</p>

<p>And now I was close to the inner gates of the stone fort through
which we had passed on the yesterday. They were open. Their guards
stood gaping at me. Drums began to beat, peremptorily, from the
temple. I looked back. There was a confusion at its entrance, a
chaotic milling. The Uighur spearsmen were streaming down the wide
road.</p>

<p>The gates began to close. I shot the stallion forward, bowling
over the guards, and was inside the fort. I reached the further
gates. They were closed. Louder beat the drums, threatening,
commanding.</p>

<p>Something of sanity returned to me. I ordered the guards to
open. They stood, trembling, staring at me. But they did not obey.
I leaped from the stallion and ran to them. I raised my hand. The
ring of Khalk'ru glittered. They threw themselves on the ground
before me&mdash;but they did not open the gates.</p>

<p>I saw upon the wall goatskins full of water. I snatched one of
these and a sack of grain. Upon the floor was a huge slab of stone.
I lifted it as though it had been a pebble, and hurled it at the
gates where the two halves met. They burst asunder. I threw the
skin of water and sack of grain over the high saddle, and rode
through the broken gates.</p>

<p>The great horse skimmed through the ravine like a swallow. And
now we were over the crumbling bridge and thundering down the
ancient road.</p>

<p>We came to the end of the far ravine. I knew it by the fall of
rock. I looked back. There was no sign of pursuit But I could hear
the faint throb of the drums.</p>

<p>It was now well past mid-afternoon. We picked our way through
the ravine and came out at the edge of the sandstone range. It was
cruel to force the stallion, but I could not afford to spare him.
By nightfall we had reached semi-arid country. The stallion was
reeking with sweat, and tired. Never once had he slackened or
turned surly. He had a great heart, that horse. I made up my mind
that he should rest, come what might.</p>

<p>I found a sheltered place behind some high boulders. Suddenly I
realized that I was still wearing the yellow ceremonial smock. I
tore it off with sick loathing. I rubbed the horse down with it. I
watered him and gave him some of the grain. I realized, too, that I
was ravenously hungry and had eaten nothing since morning. I chewed
some of the grain and washed it down with the tepid water. As yet,
there were no signs of pursuit, and the drums were silent. I
wondered uneasily whether the Uighurs knew of a shorter road and
were outflanking me. I threw the smock over the stallion and
stretched myself on the ground. I did not intend to sleep. But I
did go to sleep.</p>

<p>I awakened abruptly. Dawn was breaking. Looking down upon me
were the old priest and the cold-eyed Uighur captain. My hiding
place was ringed with spearsmen. The old priest spoke, gently.</p>

<p>"We mean you no harm, Dwayanu. If it is your will to leave us,
we cannot stay you. He whose call Khalk'ru has answered has nothing
to fear from us. His will is our will."</p>

<p>I did not answer. Looking at him, I saw again&mdash;could only
see &mdash;that which I had seen in the cavern. He sighed.</p>

<p>"It is your will to leave us! So shall it be!"</p>

<p>The Uighur captain did not speak.</p>

<p>"We have brought your clothing, Dwayanu, thinking that you might
wish to go from us as you came," said the old priest.</p>

<p>I stripped and dressed in my old clothes. The old priest took my
faded finery. He lifted the octopus robe from the stallion. The
captain spoke:</p>

<p>"Why do you leave us, Dwayanu? You have made our peace with
Khalk'ru. You have unlocked the gates. Soon the desert will blossom
as of old. Why will you not remain and lead us on our march to
greatness?"</p>

<p>I shook my head. The old priest sighed again.</p>

<p>"It is his will! So shall it be! But remember, Dwayanu&mdash;he
whose call Khalk'ru has answered must answer when Khalk'ru calls
him. And soon or late&mdash;Khalk'ru will call him!"</p>

<p>He touched my hair with his trembling old hands, touched my
heart, and turned. A troop of spearsmen wheeled round him. They
rode away.</p>

<p>The Uighur captain said:</p>

<p>"We wait to guard Dwayanu on his journey."</p>

<p>I mounted the stallion. We reached the expedition's new camp. It
was deserted. We rode on, toward the old camp. Late that afternoon
we saw ahead of us a caravan. As we came nearer they halted, made
hasty preparations for defence. It was the expedition&mdash;still
on the march. I waved my hands to them and shouted.</p>

<p>I dropped off the black stallion, and handed the reins to the
Uighur.</p>

<p>"Take him," I said. His face lost its sombre sternness,
brightened.</p>

<p>"He shall be ready for you when you return to us, Dwayanu. He or
his sons," he said. He touched my hand to his forehead, knelt. "So
shall we all be, Dwayanu&mdash;ready for you, we or our sons. When
you return."</p>

<p>He mounted his horse. He faced me with his troop. They raised
their spears. There was one crashing shout&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dwayanu!"</p>

<p>They raced away.</p>

<p>I walked to where Fairchild and the others awaited me.</p>

<p>As soon as I could arrange it, I was on my way back to America.
I wanted only one thing&mdash;to put as many miles as possible
between myself and Khalk'ru's temple.</p>

<p>I stopped. Involuntarily my hand sought the buckskin bag on my
breast.</p>

<p>"But now," I said, "it appears that it is not so easy to escape
him. By anvil stroke, by chant and drums&mdash;Khalk'ru calls
me!"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap5" id="chap5"></a>5. &mdash; THE MIRAGE</h2>

<p class="first">Jim had sat silent, watching me, but now and again
I had seen the Indian stoicism drop from his face. He leaned over
and put a hand on my shoulder.</p>

<p>"Leif," he said quietly, "how could I have known? For the first
time, I saw you afraid&mdash;it hurt me. I did not know..."</p>

<p>From Tsantawu, the Cherokee, this was much. "It's all right,
Indian. Snap back," I said roughly. He sat for a while not
speaking, throwing little twigs on the fire.</p>

<p>"What did your friend Barr say about it?" he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"He gave me hell," I said. "He gave me hell with the tears
streaming down his cheeks. He said that never had anyone betrayed
science as I had since Judas kissed Christ. He was keen on mixed
metaphors that got under your skin. That went deep under mine, for
it was precisely what I was thinking of myself &mdash;not as to
science but as to the girl. I had given her the kiss of Judas all
right. Barr said that I had been handed the finest opportunity man
ever had given him. I could have solved the whole mystery of the
Gobi and its lost civilization. I had run away like a child from a
bugaboo. I was not only atavistic in body, I was atavistic in
brain. I was a blond savage cowering before my mumbo-jumbos. He
said that if he had been given my chance he would have let himself
be crucified to have learned the truth. He would have, too. He was
not lying."</p>

<p>"Admirably scientific," said Jim. "But what did he say about
what you saw?"</p>

<p>"That is was nothing but hypnotic suggestion by the old priest.
I had seen what he had willed me to see&mdash;just as before, under
his will, I had seen myself riding to the temple. The girl hadn't
dissolved. She had probably been standing in the wings laughing at
me. But if everything that my ignorant mind had accepted as true
had been true then my conduct was even more unforgivable. I should
have remained, studied the phenomena and brought back the results
for science to examine. What I had told him of the ritual of
Khalk'ru was nothing but the second law of thermo-dynamics
expressed in terms of anthropomorphism. Life was an intrusion upon
Chaos, using that word to describe the unformed, primal state of
the universe. An invasion. An accident. In time all energy would be
changed to static heat, impotent to give birth to any life
whatsoever. The dead universes would float lifelessly in the
illimitable void. The void was eternal, life was not. Therefore the
void would absorb it. Suns, worlds, gods, men, and things animate,
would return to the void. Go back to Chaos. Back to Nothingness.
Back to Khalk'ru. Or if my atavistic brain preferred the
term&mdash;back to the Kraken. He was bitter."</p>

<p>"But the others saw the girl taken, you say. How did he explain
that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, easily. That was mass hypnotism&mdash;like the Angels of
Mons, the ghostly bowmen of Crecy and other collective
hallucinations of the War. I had been a catalyzer. My likeness to
the traditional ancient race, my completeness as a throwback, my
mastery at Khalk'ru's ritual, the faith the Uighurs had in
me&mdash;all this had been the necessary element in bringing about
the collective hallucination of the tentacle. Obviously the priests
had long been trying to make work a drug in which an essential
chemical was lacking. I, for some reason, was the missing
chemical&mdash;the catalyzer. That was all." Again he sat thinking,
breaking the little twigs.</p>

<p>"It's a reasonable explanation. But you weren't convinced?"</p>

<p>"No, I wasn't convinced&mdash;I saw the girl's face when the
tentacle touched her." He arose, stood staring toward the
north.</p>

<p>"Leif," he asked suddenly, "what did you do with the ring?"</p>

<p>I drew out the little buckskin pouch, opened it and handed the
ring to him. He examined it closely, returned it to me.</p>

<p>"Why did you keep it, Leif?"</p>

<p>"I don't know." I slipped the ring over my thumb. "I didn't give
it back to the old priest; he didn't ask for it. Oh,
hell&mdash;I'll tell you why I kept it&mdash;for the same reason
Coleridge's Ancient Mariner had the albatross tied round his neck.
So I couldn't forget I'm a murderer."</p>

<p>I put the ring back in the buckskin bag, and dropped it down my
neck. Faintly from the north came a roll of drums. It did not seem
to travel with the wind this time. It seemed to travel underground,
and died out deep beneath us.</p>

<p>"Khalk'ru!" I said.</p>

<p>"Well, don't let's keep the old gentleman waiting," said Jim
cheerfully.</p>

<p>He busied himself with the packs, whistling. Suddenly he turned
to me.</p>

<p>"Listen, Leif. Barr's theories sound good to me. I'm not saying
that if I'd been in your place I would have accepted them. Maybe
you're right. But I'm with Barr&mdash;until events, if-when-and-how
they occur, prove him wrong."</p>

<p>"Fine!" I said heartily, and entirely without sarcasm.</p>

<p>"May your optimism endure until we get back to New
York&mdash;if&mdash;when&mdash;and&mdash;how."</p>

<p>We shouldered the packs, and took up our rifles and started
northward.</p>

<p>It was not hard going, but it was an almost constant climb. The
country sloped upward, sometimes at a breathtaking pitch. The
forest, unusually thick and high for the latitude, began to thin.
It grew steadily cooler. After we had covered about fifteen miles
we entered a region of sparse and stunted trees. Five miles ahead
was a thousand-feet-high range of bare rocks. Beyond this range was
a jumble of mountains four to five thousand feet higher, treeless,
their peaks covered with snow and ice, and cut by numerous ravines
which stood out glistening white like miniature glaciers. Between
us and the nearer range stretched a plain, all grown over with
dwarfed thickets of wild roses, blueberries and squawberries, and
dressed in the brilliant reds and blues and greens of the brief
Alaskan summer.</p>

<p>"If we camp at the base of those hills, we'll be out of that
wind," said Jim. "It's five o'clock. We ought to make it in an
hour."</p>

<p>We set off. Bursts of willow ptarmigans shot up around us from
the berry thickets like brown rockets; golden plovers and curlews
were whistling on all sides; within rifle shot a small herd of
caribou was feeding, and the little brown cranes were stalking
everywhere. No one could starve in that country, and after we had
set up camp we dined very well.</p>

<p>There were no sounds that night&mdash;or if there were we slept
too deeply to hear them.</p>

<p>The next morning we debated our trail. The low range stood
directly in our path north. It continued, increasing in height,
both east and west. It presented no great difficulties from where
we were, at least so far as we could see. We determined to climb
it, taking it leisurely. It was more difficult than it had
appeared; it took us two hours to wind our way to the top.</p>

<p>We tramped across the top toward a line of huge boulders that
stretched like a wall before us. We squeezed between two of these,
and drew hastily back. We were standing at the edge of a precipice
that dropped hundreds of feet sheer to the floor of a singular
valley. The jumble of snow-and-ice-mantled mountains clustered
around it. At its far end, perhaps twenty miles away, was a
pyramidal-shaped peak.</p>

<p>Down its center, from tip to the floor of the valley, ran a
glittering white streak, without question a glacier filling a chasm
which split the mountain as evenly as though it had been made by a
single sword stroke. The valley was not wide, not more than five
miles, I estimated, at its widest point. A long and narrow valley,
its far end stoppered by the glacier-cleft giant, its sides the
walls of the other mountains, dropping, except here and there where
there had been falls of rock, as precipitously into it as the cliff
under us.</p>

<p>But it was the floor of the valley itself that riveted our
attention. It seemed nothing but a tremendous level field covered
with rocky rubble. At the far end, the glacier ran through this
rubble for half the length of the valley. There was no trace of
vegetation among the littered rocks. There was no hint of green
upon the surrounding mountains; only the bare black cliffs with
their ice and snow-filled gashes. It was a valley of
desolation.</p>

<p>"It's cold here, Leif." Jim shivered.</p>

<p>It was cold&mdash;a cold of a curious quality, a still and
breathless cold. It seemed to press out upon us from the valley, as
though to force us away.</p>

<p>"It's going to be a job getting down there," I said.</p>

<p>"And hard going when we do," said Jim. "Where the hell did all
those rocks come from, and what spread them out so flat?"</p>

<p>"Probably dropped by that glacier when it shrunk," I said. "It
looks like a terminal moraine. In fact this whole place looks as
though it had been scooped out by the ice."</p>

<p>"Hold on to my feet, Leif, I'll take a look." He lay on his
belly and wriggled his body over the edge. In a minute or two I
heard him call, and pulled him back.</p>

<p>"There's a slide about a quarter of a mile over there to the
left," he said. "I couldn't tell whether it goes all the way to the
top. We'll go see. Leif, how far down do you think that valley
is?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a few hundred feet."</p>

<p>"It's all of a thousand if it's an inch. The cliff goes down and
down. I don't understand what makes the bottom seem so much closer
here. It's a queer place, this."</p>

<p>We picked up the packs and marched off behind the wall-like rim
of boulders. In a little while we came across a big gouge in the
top, running far back. Here frost and ice had bitten out the rock
along some fault. The shattered debris ran down the middle of the
gouge like giant stepping-stones clear to the floor of the
valley.</p>

<p>"We'll have to take the packs off to negotiate that," said Jim.
"What shall be do&mdash;leave them here while we explore, or drop
them along with us as we go?"</p>

<p>"Take them with us. There must be an outlet off there at the
base of the big mountain."</p>

<p>We began the descent. I was scrambling over one of the rocks
about a third of the way when I heard his sharp exclamation.</p>

<p>Gone was the glacier that had thrust its white tongue in among
the rubble. Gone was the rubble. Toward its far end, the valley's
floor was covered with scores of pyramidal black stones, each
marked down its center with a streak of glistening white. They
stood in ranks, spaced regularly, like the dolmens of the Druids.
They marched half-down the valley. Here and there between them
arose wisps of white steam, like smokes of sacrifices.</p>

<p>Between them and us, lapping at the black cliffs, was a blue and
rippling lake! It filled the lower valley from side to side. It
rippled over the edges of the shattered rocks still far below
us.</p>

<p>Then something about the marshaled ranks of black stones struck
me.</p>

<p>"Jim! Those pyramid-shaped rocks. Each and every one of them is
a tiny duplicate of the mountain behind them! Even to the white
streak!"</p>

<p>As I spoke, the blue lake quivered. It flowed among the black
pyramids, half-submerging them, quenching the sacrificial smokes.
It covered the pyramids. Again it quivered. It was gone. Where the
lake had been was once more the rubble-covered floor of the
valley.</p>

<p>There had been an odd touch of legerdemain about the
transformations, like the swift work of a master magician. And it
had been magic&mdash;of a kind. But I had watched nature perform
that magic before.</p>

<p>"Hell!" I said. "It's a mirage!"</p>

<p>Jim did not answer. He was staring at the valley with a singular
expression.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, Tsantawu? Listening to the
ancestors again? It's only a mirage."</p>

<p>"Yes?" he said. "But which one? The lake&mdash;or the
rocks?"</p>

<p>I studied the valley's floor. It looked real enough. The theory
of a glacial moraine accounted for its oddly level
appearance&mdash;that and our height above it. When we reached it
we would find that distribution of boulders uncomfortably uneven
enough, I would swear.</p>

<p>"Why, the lake of course."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I think the stones are the mirage."</p>

<p>"Nonsense. There's a layer of warm air down there. The stones
radiate the sun's heat. This cold air presses on it. It's one of
the conditions that produces mirages, and it has just done it for
us. That's all."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "it isn't all."</p>

<p>He leaned against the rock.</p>

<p>"Leif, the ancestors had a few things more to say last night
than I told you."</p>

<p>"I know damned well they did."</p>

<p>"They spoke of Ataga'hi. Does that mean anything to you."</p>

<p>"Not a thing."</p>

<p>"It didn't to me&mdash;then. It does now. Ataga'hi was an
enchanted lake, in the wildest part of the Great Smokies, westward
from the headwaters of the Ocanaluftee. It was the medicine lake of
the animals and birds. All the Cherokee knew it was there, though
few had seen it. If a stray hunter came close, all he saw was a
stony flat, without blade of grass, forbidding. But by prayer and
fasting and an all-night vigil, he could sharpen his spiritual
sight. He would then behold at daybreak a wide shallow sheet of
purple water, fed by springs, spouting from the high cliffs around.
And in the water all kinds of fish and reptiles, flocks of ducks
and geese and other birds flying about, and around the lake the
tracks of animals. They came to Ataga'hi to be cured of wounds or
sickness. The Great Spirit had placed an island in the middle of
the lake. The wounded, the sick' animals and birds swam to it. When
they had reached it&mdash;the waters of Ataga'hi had cured them.
They came up on its shores&mdash;whole once more. Over Ataga'hi
ruled the peace of God. All creatures were friends."</p>

<p>"Listen, Indian, are you trying to tell me this is your medicine
lake?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say that at all. I said the name of Ataga'hi kept
coming into my mind. It was a place that appeared to be a stony
flat, without blade of grass, forbidding. So does this place. But
under that illusion was&mdash;a lake. We saw a lake. It's a queer
coincidence, that's all. Perhaps the stony flat of Ataga'hi was a
mirage&mdash;" He hesitated: "Well, if some other things the
ancestors mentioned turn up, I'll shift sides and take your version
of that Gobi affair."</p>

<p>"That lake was the mirage. I'm telling you."</p>

<p>He shook his head, stubbornly.</p>

<p>"Maybe. But maybe what we see down there now is mirage, too.
Maybe both are mirage. And if so, then, how deep is the real floor,
and can we make our way over it?"</p>

<p>He stood staring silently at the valley. He shivered, and again
I was aware of the curiously intense quality of the cold. I stooped
and caught hold of my pack. My hands were numb.</p>

<p>"Well, whatever it is&mdash;let's find out."</p>

<p>A quiver ran through the valley floor. Abruptly it became again
the shimmering blue lake. And as abruptly turned again to nibbled
rock.</p>

<p>But not before I had seemed to see within that lake of
illusion&mdash;if illusion it were&mdash;a gigantic shadowy shape,
huge black tentacles stretching out from a vast and nebulous
body...a body which seemed to vanish back into immeasurable
distances...vanishing into the void...as the Kraken of the Gobi
cavern had seemed to vanish into the void...into that void which
was&mdash;Khalk'ru!</p>

<p>We crept between, scrambled over and slid down the huge broken
fragments. The further down we went, the more intense became the
cold. It had a still and creeping quality that seeped into the
marrow. Sometimes we dropped the packs ahead of us, sometimes
dragged them after us. And ever more savagely the cold bit into our
bones.</p>

<p>By the frequent glimpses of the valley floor, I was more and
more assured of its reality. Every mirage I had ever
beheld&mdash;and in Mongolia I had seen many&mdash;had retreated,
changed form, or vanished as I drew near. The valley floor did none
of these things. It was true that the stones seemed to be squatter
as we came closer; but I attributed that to the different angle of
vision.</p>

<p>We were about a hundred feet above the end of the slide when I
began to be less sure. The traveling had become peculiarly
difficult. The slide had narrowed. At our left the rock was clean
swept, stretching down to the valley as smoothly as though it had
been brushed by some titanic broom. Probably an immense fragment
had broken loose at this point, shattering into the boulders that
lay heaped at its termination. We veered to the right, where there
was a ridge of rocks, pushed to the side by that same besom of
stone. Down this ridge we picked our way.</p>

<p>Because of my greater strength, I was carrying both our rifles,
swung by a thong over my left shoulder. Also I was handling the
heavier pack. We came upon an extremely awkward place. The stone
upon which I was standing suddenly tipped beneath my weight. It
threw me sideways. The pack slipped from my hands, toppled, and
fell over on the smooth rock. Automatically I threw myself forward,
catching at it. The thong holding the two rifles broke. They went
slithering after the escaping pack.</p>

<p>It was one of those combinations of circumstances that makes one
believe in a God of Mischance. The thing might have happened
anywhere else on our journey without any result whatever. And even
at that moment I didn't think it mattered.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, cheerfully, "that saves me carrying them. We can
pick them up when we get to the bottom."</p>

<p>"That is." said Jim, "if there is a bottom."</p>

<p>I cocked my eye down the slide. The rifles had caught up with
the pack and the three were now moving fast.</p>

<p>"There they stop," I said. They were almost on the rubble at the
end.</p>

<p>"The hell they do," said Jim. "There they go!"</p>

<p>I rubbed my eyes, and looked and looked again. The pack and the
pushing rifles should have been checked by that barrier at the
slide's end. But they had not been. They had vanished.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap6" id="chap6"></a>6. &mdash; THE SHADOWED
LAND</h2>

<p class="first">There had been a queer quivering when rifles and
pack had touched the upthrust of rock. Then they had seemed to melt
into it.</p>

<p>"I'd say they dropped into the lake," said Jim.</p>

<p>"There's no lake. They dropped into some break in the rock. Come
in&mdash;"</p>

<p>He gripped my shoulder.</p>

<p>"Wait, Leif. Go slow."</p>

<p>I followed his pointing finger. The barrier of stones had
vanished. Where they had been, the slide ran, a smooth tongue of
stone, far out into the valley.</p>

<p>"Come on," I said.</p>

<p>We went down, testing every step. With each halt, the nibbled
plain became flatter and flatter, the boulders squatted lower and
lower. A cloud drifted over the sun. There were no boulders. The
valley floor stretched below us, a level slate-gray waste!</p>

<p>The slide ended abruptly at the edge of this waste. The rocks
ended as abruptly, about fifty feet ahead. They stood at the edge
with the queer effect of stones set in place when the edge had been
viscous. Nor did the waste appear solid; it, too, gave the
impression of viscosity; through it ran a slight but constant
tremor, like waves of heat over a sun-baked road &mdash;yet with
every step downward the bitter, still cold increased until it was
scarcely to be borne.</p>

<p>There was a narrow passage between the shattered rocks and the
cliff at our right. We crept through it. We stood upon an immense
flat stone at the very edge of the strange plain. It was neither
water nor rock; more than anything, it had the appearance of a thin
opaque liquid glass, or a gas that had been turned semi-liquid.</p>

<p>I stretched myself out on the slab, and reached out to touch it.
I did touch it&mdash;there was no resistance; I felt nothing. I let
my hand sink slowly in. I saw my hand for a moment as though
reflected in a distorting mirror, and then I could not see it at
all. But it was pleasantly warm down there where my hand had
disappeared. The chilled blood began to tingle in my numbed
fingers. I leaned far over the stone and plunged both arms in
almost to the shoulders. It felt damned good.</p>

<p>Jim dropped beside me and thrust in his arms.</p>

<p>"It's air," he said.</p>

<p>"Feels like it&mdash;" I began, and then a sudden realization
came to me &mdash;"the rifles and the pack! If we don't get them
we're out of luck!"</p>

<p>He said: "If Khalk'ru is&mdash;guns aren't going to get us away
from him."</p>

<p>"You think this&mdash;" I stopped, memory of the shadowy shape
in the lake of illusion coming back to me.</p>

<p>"Usunhi'yi, the Darkening-land. The Shadowed-land your old
priest called it, didn't he? I'd say this fits either
description."</p>

<p>I lay quiet; no matter what the certainty of a coming ordeal a
man may carry in his soul, he can't help a certain shrinking when
he knows his foot is at the threshold of it. And now quite clearly
and certainly I knew just that. All the long trail between
Khalk'ru's Gobi temple and this place of mirage was wiped out. I
was stepping from that focus of Khalk'ru's power into this
one&mdash;where what had been begun in the Gobi must be ended. The
old haunting horror began to creep over me. I fought it.</p>

<p>I would take up the challenge. Nothing on earth could stop me
now from going on. And with that determination, I felt the horror
sullenly retreat, leave me. For the first time in years I was
wholly free of it.</p>

<p>"I'm going to see what's down there." Jim drew up his arms.
"Hold on to my feet, Leif, and I'll slip over the edge of the
stone. I felt along its edge and it seems to go on a bit
further."</p>

<p>"I'll go first." I said. "After all, it's my party."</p>

<p>"And a fine chance I'd have to pull you up if you fell over, you
human elephant. Here goes&mdash;catch hold."</p>

<p>I had just time to grip his ankles as he wriggled over the
stone, and his head and shoulders passed from sight. On he went,
slowly writhing along the slanting rock until my hands and arms
were hidden to the shoulders. He paused &mdash;and then from the
mysterious opacity in which he had vanished came a roar of crazy
laughter.</p>

<p>I felt him twist and try to jerk his feet away from me. I pulled
him, fighting against me every inch of the way, out upon the stone.
He came out roaring that same mad laughter. His face was red, and
his eyes were shining drunkenly; he had in fact all the symptoms of
a laughing drunk. But the rapidity of his respiration told me what
had happened.</p>

<p>"Breathe slowly," I shouted in his ear. "Breathe slowly, I tell
you."</p>

<p>And then, as his laughter continued and his struggles to tear
loose did not abate, I held him down with one arm and closed his
nose and mouth with my hand. In a moment or two he relaxed. I
released him; and he sat up groggily.</p>

<p>"Funniest things," he said, thickly. "Saw funniest faces..."</p>

<p>He shook his head, took a deep breath or two, and lay back on
the stone.</p>

<p>"What the hell happened to me, Leif?"</p>

<p>"You had an oxygen burn, Indian," I said. "A nice cheap jag on
air loaded with carbon-dioxide. And that explains a lot of things
about this place. You came up breathing three to the second, which
is what carbon-dioxide does to you. Works on the respiratory
centers of the brain and speeds up respiration. You took in more
oxygen than you could use, and you got drunk on it. What did you
see before the world became so funny?"</p>

<p>"I saw you," he said. "And the sky. It was like looking up out
of water. I looked down and around. A little below me was something
like a floor of pale green mist. I couldn't see through it. It's
warm in there, good and plenty warm, and it smells like trees and
flowers. That's all I managed to grasp before I went goofy. Oh,
yes, this rock fall keeps right on going down. Maybe we can get to
the bottom of it&mdash;if we don't laugh ourselves off. I'm going
right out and sit in that mirage up to my neck&mdash;my God, Leif,
I'm freezing!"</p>

<p>I looked at him with concern. His lips were blue, his teeth
chattering. The transition from the warmth to the bitter cold was
having its effect, and a dangerous one.</p>

<p>"All right," I said, rising. "I'll go first. Breathe slowly,
take deep, long breaths as slowly as you can, and breathe out just
as slowly. You'll soon get used to it. Come on."</p>

<p>I slung the remaining pack over my back, craw-fished over the
side of the stone, felt solid rock under my feet, and drew myself
down within the mirage.</p>

<p>It was warm enough; almost as warm as the steam-room of a
Turkish bath. I looked up and saw the sky above me like a circle of
blue, misty at its edges. Then I saw Jim's legs dropping down
toward me, his body bent back from them at an impossible angle. I
was seeing him, in fact, about as a fish does an angler wading in
its pool. His body seemed to telescope and he was squatting beside
me.</p>

<p>"God, but this feels good!"</p>

<p>"Don't talk," I told him. "Just sit here and practise that slow
breathing. Watch me."</p>

<p>We sat there, silently, for all of half an hour. No sound broke
the stillness around us. It smelled of the jungle, of fast growing
vigorous green life, and green life falling as swiftly into decay;
and there were elusive, alien fragrances. All I could see was the
circle of blue sky above, and perhaps a hundred feet below us the
pale green mist of which Jim had spoken. It was like a level floor
of cloud, impenetrable to the vision. The rock-fall entered it and
was lost to sight. I felt no discomfort, but both of us were
dripping with sweat. I watched with satisfaction Jim's deep,
unhurried breathing.</p>

<p>"Having any trouble?" I asked at last.</p>

<p>"Not much. Now and then I have to put the pedal down. But I
think I'm getting the trick."</p>

<p>"All right," I said. "Soon we'll be moving. I don't believe it
will get any worse as we go down."</p>

<p>"You talk like an old-timer. What's your idea of this place
anyway, Leif?"</p>

<p>"Simple enough. Although the combination hasn't a chance in
millions to be duplicated. Here is a wide, deep valley entirely
hemmed in by precipitous cliffs. It is, in effect, a pit. The
mountains enclosing it are seamed with glaciers and ice streams and
there is a constant flow of cold air into this pit, even in summer.
There is probably volcanic activity close beneath the valley's
floor, boiling springs and the like. It may be a miniature of the
Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes over to the west All this produces an
excess of carbon-dioxide. There is most probably a lush vegetation
which adds to the product. What we are going into is likely to be a
little left-over fragment of the Carboniferous Age&mdash;about ten
million years out of its time. The warm, heavy air fills the pit
until it reaches the layer of cold air we've just come from. The
mirage is produced where the two meet, by approximately the same
causes which produce every mirage. How long it's been this way. God
alone knows. Parts of Alaska never had a Glacial Age&mdash;the ice
for some reason or another didn't cover them. When what is New York
was under a thousand feet of ice, the Yukon Flats were an oasis
filled with all sorts of animal and plant life. If this valley
existed then, we're due to see some strange survivals. If it's
comparatively recent, we'll probably run across some equally
interesting adaptations. That's about all, except there must be an
outlet of some kind somewhere at about this level, otherwise the
warm air would fill the whole valley to the top, as gas does a
tank. Let's be going."</p>

<p>"I begin to hope we find the guns," said Jim, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"As you pointed out, they'd be no good against
Khalk'ru&mdash;what, who, if and where he is," I said. "But they'd
be handy against his attendant devils. Keep an eye out for
them&mdash;I mean the guns."</p>

<p>We started down the rock-fall, toward the floor of green mist.
The going was not very difficult. We reached the mist without
having seen anything of rifles or packs. The mist looked like a
heavy fog. We entered it, and that was precisely what it was. It
closed around us, thick and warm. The rocks were reeking wet and
slippery, and we had to feel for every foot of the way. Twice I
thought our numbers were up. How deep that mist was, I could not
tell, perhaps two or three hundred feet&mdash;a condensation
brought about by the peculiar atmospheric conditions that produced
the mirage.</p>

<p>The mist began to lighten. It maintained its curious green tint,
but I had the idea that this was due to reflection from below.
Suddenly it thinned to nothing. We came out of it upon a breast
where the falling rocks had met some obstruction and had piled up
into a barrier about thrice my height. We climbed that barrier.</p>

<p>We looked upon the valley beneath the mirage.</p>

<p>It lay a full thousand feet beneath us. It was filled with pale
green light like that in a deep forest glade. That light was both
lucent and vaporous, lucent where we stood, but hiding the distance
with misty curtains of pallid emerald. To the north and on each
side as far as I could see, and melting into the vaporous emerald
curtains, was a vast carpet of trees. Their breath came pulsing up
to me, jungle-strong, laden with the unfamiliar fragrances. At left
and right, the black cliffs fell sheer to the forest edge.</p>

<p>"Listen!" Jim caught my arm.</p>

<p>At first only a faint tapping, then louder and louder, we heard
from far away the beating of drums, scores of drums, in a strange
staccato rhythm &mdash;shrill, mocking, jeering! But they were no
drums of Khalk'ru! In them was nothing of that dreadful trampling
of racing feet upon a hollow world.</p>

<p>They ceased. As though in answer, and from an entirely different
direction, there was a fanfaronade of trumpets, menacing, warlike.
If brazen notes could curse, these did. Again the drums broke
forth, still mocking, taunting, defiant.</p>

<p>"Little drums," Jim was whispering. "Drums of&mdash;" He dropped
down from the rocks, and I followed. The barrier led to the east,
dipping steadily downward. We followed its base. It stood like a
great wall between us and the valley, barring our vision. We heard
the drums no more. We descended five hundred feet at least before
the barrier ended. At its end was another rock slide like that down
which the rifles and pack had fallen.</p>

<p>We stood studying it. It descended at an angle of about
forty-five degrees, and while not so smooth as the other, it had
few enough foot-holds.</p>

<p>The air had steadily grown warmer. It was not an uncomfortable
heat; there was a queer tingling life about it, an exhalation of
the crowding forest or of the valley itself, I thought. It gave me
a feeling of rampant, reckless life, a heady exaltation. The pack
had grown tiresome. If we were to negotiate the slide, and there
seemed nothing else to do, I couldn't very well carry it. I unslung
it.</p>

<p>"Letter of introduction" I said, and sent it slithering down the
rock.</p>

<p>"Breathe deep and slow, you poor ass," said Jim, and
laughed.</p>

<p>His eyes were bright; he looked happy, like a man from whom some
burden of fear and doubt has fallen. He looked, in fact, as I had
felt when I had taken up that challenge of the unknown not so long
before. And I wondered.</p>

<p>The slithering pack gave a little leap, and dropped completely
out of sight. Evidently the slide did not go all the way to the
valley floor, or, if so, it continued at a sharper angle at the
point of the pack's disappearance.</p>

<p>I let myself over cautiously, and began to worm down the slide
flat on my belly, Jim following. We had negotiated about
three-quarters of it when I heard him shout. Then his falling body
struck me. I caught him with one hand, but it broke my own
precarious hold. We went rolling down the slide and dropped into
space. I felt a jarring shock, and abruptly went completely
out.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap7" id="chap7"></a>7. &mdash; THE LITTLE
PEOPLE</h2>

<p class="first">I came to myself to find Jim pumping the breath
back into me. I was lying on something soft. I moved my legs
gingerly, and sat up. I looked around. We were on a bank of
moss&mdash;in it, rather, for the tops of the moss were a foot or
more above my head. It was an exceedingly overgrown moss, I
thought, staring at it stupidly. I had never seen moss as big as
this. Had I shrunk, or was it really so overgrown? Above me was a
hundred feet of almost sheer cliff. Said Jim:</p>

<p>"Well, we're here."</p>

<p>"How did we get here?" I asked, dazed. He pointed to the
cliff.</p>

<p>"We fell down that. We struck a ledge. You did, rather. I was on
top. It bumped us right out on this nice big moss mattress. I was
still on top. That's why I've been pumping breath back into you for
the last five minutes. Sorry, Leif, but if it had been the other
way about, you'd certainly have had to proceed on your pilgrimage
alone. I haven't your resilience."</p>

<p>He laughed. I stood up, and looked about us. The bed of giant
moss on which we had landed formed a mound between us and the
forest. At the base of the cliff was piled the debris of the fall
that had made the slide. I looked at these rocks and shivered. If
we had struck them we would have been a jumble of broken bones and
mangled flesh. I felt myself over. I was intact.</p>

<p>"Everything, Indian," I said piously, "is always for the
best."</p>

<p>"God, Leif! You had me worried for a while!" He turned abruptly.
"Look at the forest."</p>

<p>The mound of moss was a huge and high oval, hemmed almost to the
base of the cliffs by gigantic trees. They were somewhat like the
sequoias of California, and quite as high. Their crowns towered;
their enormous boles were columns carved by Titans. Beneath them
grew graceful ferns, tall as palm trees, and curious conifers with
trunks thin as bamboos, scaled red and yellow. Over them, hanging
from the boles and branches of the trees, were vines and clusters
of flowers of every shape and color; there were cressets of
orchids, and chandeliers of lilies; strange symmetrical trees, the
tips of whose leafless branches held up flower cups as though they
were candelabra; chimes of flower bells swayed from boughs and
there were long ropes and garlands of small starry flowers, white
and crimson and in all the blues of the tropic seas. Bees dipped
into them. There was a constant flashing of great dragon-flies all
in lacquered mail of green and scarlet. And mysterious shadows
drifted through the forest, like the shadows of the wings of
hovering unseen guardians.</p>

<p>It was no forest of the Carboniferous Age, at least none such as
I had ever seen reconstructed by science. It was a forest of
enchantment. Out of it came heady fragrances. Nor was it, for all
its strangeness, in the least sinister, or forbidding. It was very
beautiful. Jim said:</p>

<p>"The woods of the gods! Anything might live in a place like
that. Anything that is lovely&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ah, Tsantawu, my brother&mdash;had that but been true!</p>

<p>All I said was:</p>

<p>"It's going to be damned hard to get through."</p>

<p>"I was thinking that," he answered. "Maybe the best thing is to
skirt the cliffs. We may run across easier going farther on. Which
way&mdash;right or left?"</p>

<p>We tossed a coin. The coin spun right. I saw the pack not far
away, and walked over to retrieve it. The moss was as unsteady as a
double spring- mattress. I wondered how it came to be there;
thought that probably a few of the giant trees had been felled by
the rock fall and the moss had fed upon their decay. I slung the
pack over my shoulders, and we tramped, waist-deep in the spongy
growth, to the cliffs.</p>

<p>We skirted the cliffs for about a mile. Sometimes the forest
pressed so closely that we had trouble clinging to the rock. Then
it began to change. The giant trees retreated. We entered a brake
of the immense ferns. Except for the bees and the lacquered
dragon-flies, there was no sign of life amid the riotous
vegetation. We passed out of the ferns and into a most singular
small meadow. It was almost like a clearing. At each side were the
ferns; the forest formed a palisade at one end; at the other was a
sheer cliff whose black face was spangled with large cup-shaped
white flowers which hung from short, reddish, rather repellently
snake-like vines whose roots I supposed were fixed in crevices in
the rock.</p>

<p>No trees or ferns of any kind grew in the meadow. It was
carpeted by a lacy grass upon whose tips were minute blue
flowerets. From the base of the cliff arose a thin veil of steam
which streamed up softly high in air, bathing the cup-shaped white
blossoms.</p>

<p>A boiling spring, we decided. We drew closer to examine it.</p>

<p>We heard a wailing&mdash;despairing, agonized...Like the wail of
a heart-broken, tortured child, yet neither quite human nor quite
animal. It had come from the cliff, from somewhere behind the veils
of steam. We stopped short, listening. The wailing began again,
within it something that stirred the very depths of pity, and it
did not cease. We ran toward the cliff. The steam curtain at its
base was dense. We skirted it and reached its farther end.</p>

<p>At the base of the cliff was a long and narrow pool, like a
small closed stream. Its water was black and bubbling, and from
these bubbles came the steam. From end to end of the boiling pool,
across the face of the black rock, ran a yard-wide ledge. Above it,
spaced at regular intervals, were niches cut within the cliff,
small as cradles.</p>

<p>In two of these niches, half-within them and half-upon the
ledge, lay what at first glance seemed two children. They were
outstretched upon their backs, their tiny hands and feet fastened
to the stone by staples of bronze. Their hair streamed down their
sides; their bodies were stark naked.</p>

<p>And now I saw that they were not children. They were
mature&mdash;a little man and a little woman. The woman had twisted
her head and was staring at the other pygmy. It was she who was
wailing. She did not see us. Her eyes were intent upon him. He lay
rigid, his eyes dosed. Upon his breast, over his heart, was a black
corrosion, as though acid had been dropped upon it.</p>

<p>There was a movement on the cliff above him. One of the
cup-shaped white flowers was there. Could it have been that which
had moved? It hung a foot above the little man's breast, and on its
scarlet pistils was a slowly gathering drop which I took for
nectar.</p>

<p>It had been the flower whose movement had caught my eye! As I
looked the reddish vine trembled. It writhed like a sluggish worm
an inch down the rock. The flower shook its cup as though it were a
mouth trying to shake loose the gathering drop. And the flower
mouth was directly over the little man's heart and the black
corrosion on his breast.</p>

<p>I stepped out upon the narrow path, reached up and grasped the
vine and tore it loose. It squirmed in my hand like a snake. Its
roots clung to my fingers, and like a snake's head the flower
raised itself as though to strike. Its rim was thick and fleshy,
like a round white mouth. The drop of nectar fell upon my hand and
a fiery agony bit into it, running up my arm like a flame. I hurled
the squirming thing into the boiling pool.</p>

<p>Close above the little woman was another of the crawling vines.
I tore it loose as I had the other. It, too, strove to strike me
with its head of flower, but either there was none of that dreadful
nectar in its cup, or it missed me. I threw it after the other.</p>

<p>I bent over the little man. His eyes were open; he was glaring
up at me. Like his skin, his eyes were yellow, tilted, Mongolian.
They seemed to have no pupils, and they were not wholly human; no
more than had been the wailing of his woman. There was agony in
them, and there was bitter hatred. His gaze wandered to my hair,
and I saw amazement banish the hatred.</p>

<p>The flaming torment of my hand and arm was almost intolerable.
By it, I knew what the pygmy must be suffering. I tore away the
staples that fettered him. I lifted the little man, and passed him
over to Jim. He weighed no more than a baby.</p>

<p>I snapped the staples from the slab on which lay the little
woman. There was no fear nor hatred in her eyes. They were filled
with wonder and unmistakable gratitude. I carried her over and set
her beside her man.</p>

<p>I looked back, up the face of the black cliff. There was
movement all over it; the reddish ropes of the vines writhing, the
white flowers swaying, raising and lowering their cups.</p>

<p>It was rather hideous...</p>

<p>The little man lay quietly, yellow eyes turning from me to Jim
and back to me again. The woman spoke, in trilling, bird-like
syllables. She darted away across the meadow, into the forest.</p>

<p>Jim was staring down upon the golden pygmy like a man in a
dream. I heard him whisper:</p>

<p>"The Yunwi Tsundi! The Little People! It was all true then! All
true!"</p>

<p>The little woman came running out of the fern brake. Her hands
were full of thick, heavily veined leaves. She darted a look at me,
as of apology. She bent over her man. She squeezed some of the
leaves over his breast. A milky sap streamed through her fingers
and dropped upon the black, corroded spot. It spread over the spot
like a film. The little man stiffened and groaned, relaxed and lay
still.</p>

<p>The little woman took my hand. Where the nectar had touched, the
skin had turned black. She squeezed the juice of the leaves upon
it. A pang, to which all the torment that had gone before was
nothing, ran through hand and arm. Then, almost instantly, there
was no pain.</p>

<p>I looked at the little man's breast. The black corrosion had
disappeared. There was a wound like an old burn, red and normal. I
looked at my hand. It was inflamed, but the blackness was no longer
there.</p>

<p>The little woman bowed before me. The little man arose. He
looked at my eyes and ran his gaze along my bulk. I watched
suspicion grow, and the return of bitter hate. He spoke to his
woman. She answered at some length, pointing to the cliff, to my
inflamed hand, and to the ankles and wrists of both of them. The
little man beckoned to me; by gesture asked me to bend down to him.
I did, and he touched my yellow hair; he ran it through his tiny
fingers. He laid his hand on my heart...then laid his head on my
heart, listening to its beat.</p>

<p>He struck me with his small hand across my mouth. It was no
blow; I knew it for a caress.</p>

<p>The little man smiled at me, and trilled. I could not
understand, and shook my head helplessly. He looked up at Jim and
trilled another question. Jim tried him in the Cherokee. This time
it was the little man who shook his head. He spoke again to his
woman. Clearly I caught the word "ev-ah-lee" in the bird-like
sounds. She nodded.</p>

<p>Motioning us to follow, they ran across the meadow, toward the
further brake of fern. How little they were&mdash;hardly to my
thighs. They were beautifully formed. Their long hair was chestnut
brown, fine and silky. Their hair floated behind them like
cobwebs.</p>

<p>They ran like small deer. We were hard put to keep up with them.
They entered the fern brake toward which we had been heading, and
here they slowed their pace. On and on we went through the giant
ferns. I could see no path, but the golden pygmies knew their
way.</p>

<p>We came out of the ferns. Before us was a wide sward covered
with the flowerets whose blue carpet ran to the banks of a wide
river, to the banks of a strange river, a river all milky white,
over whose placid surface hovered swirls of opalescent mist.
Through the swirls I caught glimpses of green, level plains upon
the white river's further side, and of green scarps.</p>

<p>The little man halted. He bent his ear to the ground. He leaped
back into the brake, motioning us to follow. In a few minutes we
came across a half- ruined watch tower. Its entrance gaped open.
The pygmies slipped within it, beckoning.</p>

<p>Inside the tower was a crumbling flight of stones leading to its
top. The little man and woman danced up them, with us close behind
them. There was a small chamber at the tower's top through the
chinks of whose stones the green light streamed. I peered through
one of the crevices, down upon the blue sward and the white river.
I heard the faint trampling of horses' feet and the low chanting of
women; closer they drew, and closer.</p>

<p>A woman came riding down the blue sward. She was astride a great
black mare. She wore, like a hood, the head of a white wolf. Its
pelt covered her shoulders and back. Over that silvery pelt her
hair fell in two thick braids of flaming red. Her high, round
breasts were bare, and beneath them the paws of the white wolf were
clasped like a girdle. Her eyes were blue as the cornflower and set
wide apart under a broad, low forehead. Her skin was milky-white
flushed with soft rose. Her mouth was full-lipped, crimson, and
both amorous and cruel.</p>

<p>She was a strong woman, tall almost as I. She was like a
Valkyrie, and like those messengers of Odin she carried on her
saddle before her, held by one arm, a body. But it was no soul of a
slain warrior snatched up for flight to Valhalla. It was a girl. A
girl whose arms were bound to her sides by stout thongs, with head
bent hopelessly on her breast. I could not see her face; it was
hidden under the veil of her hair. But the hair was russet red and
her skin as fair as that of the woman who held her.</p>

<p>Over the Wolf-woman's head flew a snow-white falcon, dipping and
circling and keeping pace with her as she rode.</p>

<p>Behind her rode a half-score other women, young and
strong-thewed, pink- skinned and blue-eyed, their hair of
copper-red, rust-red, bronzy-red, plaited around their heads or
hanging in long braids down their shoulders. They were
bare-breasted, kirtled and buskined. They carried long, slender
spears and small round targes. And they, too, were like Valkyries,
each of them a shield-maiden of the Aesir. As they rode, they sang,
softly, muted, a strange chant.</p>

<p>The Wolf-woman and her captive passed around a bend of the sward
and out of sight. The chanting women followed and were hidden.</p>

<p>There was a gleam of silver from the white falcon's wing as it
circled and dropped, circled and dropped. Then it, too, was
gone.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap8" id="chap8"></a>8. &mdash; EVALIE</h2>

<p class="first">The golden pygmies hissed; their yellow eyes were
molten with hatred.</p>

<p>The little man touched my hand, talking in the rapid trilling
syllables, and pointing over the white river. Clearly he was
telling me we must cross it. He stopped, listening. The little
woman ran down the broken stairs. The little man twittered angrily,
darted to Jim, beat at his legs with his fists as though to arouse
him, then shot after the woman.</p>

<p>"Snap out of it, Indian!" I said, impatiently. "They want us to
hurry."</p>

<p>He shook his head, like a man shaking away the last cobwebs of
some dream.</p>

<p>We sped down the broken steps. The little man was waiting for
us; or at least he had not run away, for, if waiting for us, he was
doing so in a most singular manner. He was dancing in a small
circle, waving his arms and hands oddly, and trilling a weird
melody upon four notes, repeated over and over in varying
progressions. The woman was nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>A wolf howled. It was answered by other wolves farther away in
the flowered forest&mdash;like a hunting pack whose leader has
found the scent.</p>

<p>The little woman came racing through the fern brake; the little
man stopped dancing. Her hands were filled with small purplish
fruits resembling fox-grapes. The little man pointed toward the
white river, and they set off through the screening brake of ferns.
We followed.</p>

<p>We came out of the brake, crossed the blue sward and stood on
the bank of the river.</p>

<p>The howl of the wolf sounded again, answered by the others, and
closer.</p>

<p>The little man leaped upon me, twittering frantically; he twined
his legs about my waist and strove to tear my shirt from me. The
woman was trilling at Jim, waving in her hands the bunches of
purple fruit.</p>

<p>"They want us to take off our clothes," said Jim. "They want us
to be quick about it."</p>

<p>We stripped, hastily. There was a crevice in the bank into which
I pushed the pack. Quickly we rolled up our clothes and boots, and
threw a strap around them and slung them over our shoulders.</p>

<p>The little woman threw a handful of the purple fruit to her man.
She motioned Jim to bend, and as he did so she squeezed the berries
over his head and hands, his breasts and thighs and feet. The
little man was doing the same for me. The fruit had an oddly
pungent odor that made my eyes water.</p>

<p>I straightened up and looked out over the white river.</p>

<p>The head of a serpent broke through its milky surface; then
another and another. Their heads were as large as those of the
anaconda, and were scaled in vivid emerald. They were crested by
brilliant green spines which continued along their backs and were
revealed as they swirled and twisted in the white water. Quite
definitely, I did not like plunging into that water, but now I
thought I knew the purpose of our anointing, and that most
certainly the golden pygmies intended us no harm. And just as
certainly, I assumed, they knew what they were about.</p>

<p>The howling of the wolves came once more, not only much nearer,
but from the direction along which had gone the troop of women.</p>

<p>The little man dived into the water, motioning me to follow. I
obeyed, and heard the small splash of the woman and the louder one
of Jim. The little man glanced back at me, nodded, and began to
swim across like an eel, at a speed that I found difficult to
emulate.</p>

<p>The crested serpents did not molest us. Once I felt the slither
of scales across my loins; once I shook the water from my eyes to
find one of them swimming beside me, matching in play my speed, or
so it seemed; racing me.</p>

<p>The water was warm, as warm as the milk it resembled, and
curiously buoyant. The river at this point was about a thousand
feet wide. I had covered half of it when I heard a shrill shriek
and felt the buffeting of wings about my head. I rolled over,
beating up with my hands to drive off whatever it was that had
attacked me.</p>

<p>It was the white falcon of the Wolf-woman, hovering, dropping,
rising again, threshing me with its pinions!</p>

<p>I heard a cry from the bank, a bell-like contralto, vibrant,
imperious &mdash;in archaic Uighur:</p>

<p>"Come back! Come back. Yellow-hair!"</p>

<p>I swung round to see. The falcon ceased its buffetings. Upon the
farther bank was the Wolf-woman upon her great black mare, the
captive girl still clasped in her arm. The Wolf-woman's eyes were
like sapphire stars, her free hand was raised in summons.</p>

<p>And all around her, heads lowered, glaring at me with eyes as
green as hers were blue, was a pack of snow-white wolves!</p>

<p>"Come back!" she cried again.</p>

<p>She was very beautiful&mdash;the Wolf-woman. It would not have
been hard to have obeyed. But no&mdash;she was not a Wolf-woman!
What was she? Into my mind came a Uighur word, an ancient word that
I had not known I knew. She was the Salur'da&mdash;the Witch-woman.
And with it came angry resentment of her summons. Who was
she&mdash;the Salur'da&mdash;to command me! Me, Dwayanu, who in
olden time long forgot would have had her whipped with scorpions
for such insolence!</p>

<p>I raised myself high above the white water.</p>

<p>"Back to your den, Salur'da!" I shouted. "Does Dwayanu come to
your call? When I summon you, then see that you obey!"</p>

<p>She stared at me, stark amazement in her eyes; the strong arm
that held the girl relaxed so that the captive almost dropped from
the mare's high pommel. I struck out across the water to the
farther shore.</p>

<p>I heard the Witch-woman whistle. The falcon circling round my
head screamed, and flew. I heard the white wolves snarling; I heard
the thud of the black mare's hoofs racing over the blue sward. I
reached the bank and climbed it. Only then did I turn. Witch-woman,
falcon and white wolves &mdash;all of them were gone.</p>

<p>Across my wake the emerald-headed, emerald-crested serpents swam
and swirled and dived.</p>

<p>The golden pygmies had climbed upon the bank.</p>

<p>Jim asked:</p>

<p>"What did you say to her?"</p>

<p>"The Witch-woman comes to my call&mdash;not I to hers," I
answered, and wondered as I did so what it was that compelled the
words.</p>

<p>"Still very much&mdash;Dwayanu, aren't you, Leif? What touched
the trigger on you this time?"</p>

<p>"I don't know." The inexplicable resentment against the woman
was still strong, and, because I could not understand it,
irritating to a degree. "She ordered me to come back, and a little
fire-cracker went off in my brain. Then I&mdash;I seemed to know
her for what she is, and that her command was rank insolence. I
told her so. She was no more surprised by what I said than I am. It
was like someone else speaking. It was like&mdash;"</p>

<p>I hesitated&mdash;"well, it was like when I started that cursed
ritual and couldn't stop."</p>

<p>He nodded, then began to put on his clothes. I followed suit.
They were soaking wet. The pygmies watched us wriggle into them
with frank amazement. I noticed that the angry red around the wound
on the little man's breast had paled, and that while the wound
itself was raw, it was not deep and had already begun to heal. I
looked at my own hand; the red had almost disappeared, and only a
slight tenderness betrayed where the nectar had touched it.</p>

<p>When we had laced our boots, the golden pygmies trotted off,
away from the river toward a line of cliffs about a mile ahead. The
vaporous green light half hid them, as it had wholly hidden our
view to the north when we had first looked over the valley. For
half the distance the ground was level and covered with the blue
flowered grass. Then ferns began, steadily growing higher. We came
upon a trail little wider than a deer path which threaded into a
greater brake. Into this we turned.</p>

<p>We had eaten nothing since early morning, and I thought
regretfully of the pack I had left behind. However, it is my
training to eat heartily when I can, and philosophically go without
when I must. So I tightened my belt and glanced back at Jim, close
upon my heels.</p>

<p>"Hungry?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No. Too busy thinking."</p>

<p>"Indian&mdash;what brought the red-headed beauty back?"</p>

<p>"The wolves. Didn't you hear them howling after her? They found
our track and gave her the signal."</p>

<p>"I thought so&mdash;but it's incredible! Hell&mdash;then she is
a Witch-woman."</p>

<p>"Not because of that. You're forgetting your Mowgli and the gray
Companions. Wolves aren't hard to train. But she's a Witch-woman,
nevertheless. Don't hold back Dwayanu when you deal with her,
Leif."</p>

<p>The little drums again began to beat. At first only a few, then
steadily more and more until there were scores of them. This time
the cadences were lilting, gay, tapping out a dancing rhythm that
lifted all weariness. They did not seem far away. But now the ferns
were high over our heads and impenetrable to the sight, and the
narrow path wove in and out among them like a meandering stream</p>

<p>The pygmies hastened their pace. Suddenly the trail came out of
the ferns, and the pair halted. In front of us the ground sloped
sharply upward for three or four hundred feet. The slope, except
where the path ran, was covered from bottom to top with a tangle of
thick green vines studded along all their lengths with wicked
three-inch thorns; a living <i>chevaux-de-frise</i> which no living
creature would penetrate. At the end of the path was a squat tower
of stone, and from this came the glint of spear-heads.</p>

<p>In the tower a shrill-voiced drum chattered an unmistakable
alarm. Instantly the lilting drums were silent. The same shrill
chatter was taken up and repeated from point to point, diminishing
in the far distance; and now I saw that the slope was like an
immense circular fortification, curving far out toward the unbroken
palisade of the giant ferns, and retreating at our right toward the
sheer wall of black cliff, far away. Everywhere upon it was the
thicket of thorn.</p>

<p>The little man twittered to his woman, and walked up the trail
toward the tower. He was met by other pygmies streaming out of it.
The little woman stayed with us, nodding and smiling and patting
our knees reassuringly.</p>

<p>Another drum, or a trio of them, began to beat from the tower. I
thought there were three because their burden was on three
different notes, soft, caressing, yet far-carrying. They sang a
word, a name, those drums, as plainly as though they had lips, the
name I had heard in the trilling of the pygmies&mdash;</p>

<p>Ev-ah-lee...Ev-ah-lee...Ev-ah-lee...Over and over and over. The
drums in the other towers were silent.</p>

<p>The little man beckoned us. We went forward, avoiding with
difficulty the thorns. We came to the top of the path beside the
small tower. A score of the little men stepped out and barred our
way. None was taller than the one I had saved from the white
flowers. All had the same golden skin, the same half- animal yellow
eyes; like his, their hair was long and silky, floating almost to
their tiny feet, They wore twisted loin-cloths of what appeared to
be cotton; around their waists were broad girdles of silver,
pierced like lace-work in intricate designs. Their spears were
wicked weapons for all their apparent frailty, long-handled, hafted
in some black wood, and with foot-deep points of red metal, and
barbed like a muskalonge hook from tip to base. Swung on their
backs were black bows with long arrows barbed in similar manner;
and in their metal girdles were slender sickle-shaped knives of the
red metal, like scimitars of gnomes.</p>

<p>They stood staring at us, like small children. They made me feel
as Gulliver must have felt among the Lilliputians. Also, there was
that about them which gave me no desire to tempt them to use their
weapons. They looked at Jim with curiosity and interest and with no
trace of unfriendliness. They looked at me with little faces that
grew hard and fierce. Only when their eyes roved to my yellow hair
did I see wonder and doubt lighten suspicion &mdash;but they never
dropped the points of the spears turned toward me.</p>

<p>Ev-ah-lee...Ev-ah-lee...Ev-ah-lee...sang the drums.</p>

<p>There was an answering roll from beyond, and they were
silent.</p>

<p>I heard a sweet, low-pitched voice at the other side of the
tower trilling the bird-like syllables of the Little
People&mdash;And then&mdash;I saw Evalie.</p>

<p>Have you watched a willow bough swaying in spring above some
clear sylvan pool, or a slender birch dancing with the wind in a
secret woodland and covert, or the flitting green shadows in a deep
forest glade which are dryads half-tempted to reveal themselves? I
thought of them as she came toward us.</p>

<p>She was a dark girl, and a tall girl. Her eyes were brown under
long black lashes, the clear brown of the mountain brook in autumn;
her hair was black, the jetty hair that in a certain light has a
sheen of darkest blue. Her face was small, her features certainly
neither classic nor regular&mdash;the brows almost meeting in two
level lines above her small, straight nose; her mouth was large but
finely cut, and sensitive. Over her broad, low forehead the
blue-black hair was braided like a coronal. Her skin was clear
amber. Like polished fine amber it shone under the loose, yet
clinging, garment that clothed her, knee-long, silvery, cobweb-fine
and transparent. Around her hips was the white loin-cloth of the
Little People. Unlike them, her feet were sandaled.</p>

<p>But it was the grace of her that made the breath catch in your
throat as you looked at her, the long flowing line from ankle to
shoulder, delicate and mobile as the curve of water flowing over
some smooth breast of rock, a liquid grace of line that changed
with every movement.</p>

<p>It was that&mdash;and the life that burned in her like the green
flame of the virgin forest when the kisses of spring are being
changed for the warmer caresses of summer. I knew now why the old
Greeks had believed in the dryads, the naiads, the
nereids&mdash;the woman souls of trees, of brooks and waterfalls
and fountains, and of the waves.</p>

<p>I could not tell how old she was&mdash;hers was the pagan beauty
which knows no age.</p>

<p>She examined me, my clothes and boots, in manifest perplexity;
she glanced at Jim, nodded, as though to say there was nothing in
him to be disturbed about; then turned back to me, studying me. The
small soldiers ringed her, their spears ready.</p>

<p>The little man and his woman had stepped forward. They were both
talking at once, pointing to his breast, to my hand, to my yellow
hair. The girl laughed, drew the little woman to her and covered
her lips with a hand. The little man went on trilling and
twittering.</p>

<p>Jim had been listening with a puzzled intensity whenever the
girl had done the talking. He caught my arm.</p>

<p>"It's Cherokee they're speaking! Or something like
it&mdash;Listen... there was a word...it sounded like
'Yun'-wini'giski'...it means 'Man-eaters'. Literally, 'They eat
people'...if that's what it was...and look...he's showing how the
vines crawled down the cliffs..."</p>

<p>The girl began speaking again. I listened intently. The rapid
enunciation and the trilling made understanding difficult, but I
caught sounds that seemed familiar&mdash;and now I heard a
combination that I certainly knew.</p>

<p>"It's some kind of Mongolian tongue, Jim. I got a word just then
that means 'serpent-water' in a dozen different dialects."</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;she called the snake 'aha'nada' and the Cherokees
say 'inadu'&mdash;but it's Indian, not Mongolian."</p>

<p>"It might be both. The Indian dialects are Mongolian. Maybe it's
the ancient mother-tongue. If we could only get her to speak
slower, and tune down on the trills."</p>

<p>"It might be that. The Cherokees called themselves 'the oldest
people' and their language 'the first
speech'&mdash;wait&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stepped forward, hand upraised; he spoke the word which in
the Cherokee means, equally, friend or one who comes with good
intentions. He said it several times. Wonder and comprehension
crept into the girl's eyes. She repeated it as he had spoken it,
then turned to the pygmies, passing the word on to them&mdash;and I
could distinguish it now plainly within the trills and pipings. The
pygmies came closer, staring up at Jim.</p>

<p>He said, slowly: "We come from outside. We know nothing of this
place. We know none within it."</p>

<p>Several times he had to repeat this before she caught it. She
looked gravely at him, and at me doubtfully&mdash;yet as one who
would like to believe. She answered haltingly.</p>

<p>"But Sri"&mdash;she pointed to the little man&mdash;"has said
that in the water he spoke the tongue of evil."</p>

<p>"He speaks many tongues," said Jim&mdash;then to me:</p>

<p>"Talk to her. Don't stand there like a dummy, admiring her. This
girl can think&mdash;and we're in a jam. Your looks make no hit
with the dwarfs, Leif, in spite of what you did."</p>

<p>"Is it any stranger that I should have spoken that tongue than
that I now speak yours, Evalie?" I said. And asked the same
question in two of the oldest dialects of the Mongolian that I
knew. She studied me, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"No," she said at last&mdash;"no; for I, too, know something of
it, yet that does not make me evil."</p>

<p>And suddenly she smiled, and trilled some command to the guards.
They lowered their spears, regarding me with something of the
friendly interest they had showed toward Jim. Within the tower, the
drums began to roll a cheerful tattoo. As at a signal, the other
unseen drums which the shrill alarm had silenced, resumed their
lilting rhythm.</p>

<p>The girl beckoned us. We walked behind her, the little soldiers
ringing us, between a portcullis of thorn and the tower.</p>

<p>We passed over the threshold of the Land of the Little People
and of Evalie.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap9" id="chap9"></a>9. &mdash; [UNTITLED]</h2>

<p class="first">The green light that filled the Shadowed-land was
darkening. As the green forest darkens at dusk. The sun must long
since have dipped beneath the peaks circling that illusory floor
which was the sky of the Shadowed-land. Yet here the glow faded
slowly, as though it were not wholly dependent upon the sun, as
though the place had some luminosity of its own.</p>

<p>We sat beside the tent of Evalie. It was pitched on a rounded
knoll not far from the entrance of her lair within the cliff. All
along the base of the cliff were the lairs of the Little People,
tiny openings through which none larger than they could creep into
the caves that were their homes, their laboratories, their
workshops, their storehouses and granaries, their impregnable
fortresses.</p>

<p>It had been hours since we had followed her over the plain
between the watch-tower and her tent. The golden pygmies had
swarmed from every side, curious as children, chattering and
trilling, questioning Evalie, twittering her answers to those on
the outskirts of the crowd. Even now there was a ring of them
around the base of the knoll, dozens of little men and little
women, staring up at us with their yellow eyes, chirping and
laughing. In the arms of the women were babies like tiniest dolls,
and like larger dolls were the older children who clustered at
their knees.</p>

<p>Child-like, their curiosity was soon satisfied; they went back
to their occupations and their play. Others, curiosity not yet
quenched, took their places.</p>

<p>I watched them dancing upon the smooth grass. They danced in
circling measures to the lilting rhythm of their drums. There were
other knolls upon the plain, larger and smaller than that on which
we were, and all of them as rounded and as symmetrical. Around and
over them the golden pygmies danced to the throbbing of the little
drums.</p>

<p>They had brought us little loaves of bread, and oddly sweet but
palatable milk and cheese, and unfamiliar delicious fruits and
melons. I was ashamed of the number of platters I had cleaned. The
little people had only watched, and laughed, and urged the women to
bring me more. Jim said, laughingly:</p>

<p>"It's the food of the Yunwi Tsundi you're eating. Fairy food,
Leif! You can never eat mortal food again."</p>

<p>I looked at Evalie, and at the wine and amber beauty of her.
Well, I could believe Evalie had been brought up on something more
than mortal food.</p>

<p>I studied the plain for the hundredth time. The slope on which
stood the squat towers was an immense semi-circle, the ends of
whose arcs met the black cliffs. It must enclose, I thought, some
twenty square miles. Beyond the thorned vines were the brakes of
the giant fern; beyond them, on the other side of the river, I
could glimpse the great trees. If there were forests on this side,
I could not tell. Nor what else there might be of living things.
There was something to be guarded against, certainly, else why the
fortification, the defenses?</p>

<p>Whatever else it might be, this guarded land of the golden
pygmies was a small Paradise, with its stands of grain, its
orchards, its vines and berries and its green fields.</p>

<p>I thought over what Evalie had told us of herself, carefully and
slowly tuning down the trilling syllables of the little people into
vocables we could understand. It was an ancient tongue she
spoke&mdash;one whose roots struck far deeper down in the soil of
Time than any I knew, unless it were the archaic Uighur itself.
Minute by minute I found myself mastering it with ever greater
ease, but not so rapidly as Jim. He had even essayed a few trills,
to the pygmies' delight. More than that, however, they had
understood him. Each of us could follow Evalie's thought better
than she could ours.</p>

<p>Whence had the Little People come into the Shadowed-land? And
where had they learned that ancient tongue? I asked myself that,
and answered that as well ask how it came that the Sumerians, whose
great city the Bible calls Ur of the Chaldees, spoke a Mongolian
language. They, too, were a dwarfish race, masters of strange
sorceries, students of the stars. And no man knows whence they came
into Mesopotamia with their science full-blown. Asia is the Ancient
Mother, and to how many races she has given birth and watched blown
away in dust none can say.</p>

<p>The transformation of the tongue into the bird-like speech of
the Little People, I thought I understood. Obviously, the smaller
the throat, the higher are the sounds produced. Unless by some
freak, one never hears a child with a bass voice. The tallest of
the Little People was no bigger than a six-year-old child. They
could not, perforce, sound the gutturals and deeper tones; so they
had to substitute other sounds. The natural thing, when you cannot
strike a note in a lower octave, is to strike that same note in a
higher. And so they had, and in time this had developed into the
overlying pattern of trills and pipings, beneath which, however,
the essential structure persisted.</p>

<p>She remembered, Evalie had told us, a great stone house. She
thought she remembered a great water. She remembered a land of
trees which had become "white and cold". There had been a man and a
woman...then there was only the man...and it was all like mist. All
she truly remembered was the Little People...she had forgotten
there had ever been anything else&mdash;until we had come. She
remembered when she had been no bigger than the Little
People&mdash;and how frightened she was when she began to be bigger
than they. The Little People, the Rrrllya&mdash;it is the closest I
can come to the trill&mdash;loved her; they did as she told them to
do. They had fed and clothed and taught her, especially the mother
of Sri, whose life I had saved from the Death Flower. Taught her
what? She looked at us oddly, and only repeated&mdash;"taught me".
Sometimes she danced with the Little People and sometimes she
danced for them&mdash;again the oddly secretive, half-amused
glance. That was all. How long ago had she been as small as the
Little People? She did not know&mdash;long and long ago. Who had
named her Evalie? She did not know.</p>

<p>I studied her, covertly. There was not one thing about her to
give a clue to her race. Foundling, I knew, she must have been, the
vague man and woman her father and mother. But what had they
been&mdash;of what country? No more than could her lips, did her
eyes or hair, colouring or body hint at answer.</p>

<p>She was more changeling than I. A changeling of the mirage!
Nurtured on food from Goblin Market!</p>

<p>I wondered whether she would change back again into everyday
woman if I carried her out of the Shadowed-land.</p>

<p>I felt the ring touch my breast with the touch of ice.</p>

<p>Carry her away! There was Khalk'ru to meet first&mdash;and the
Witch- woman!</p>

<p>The green twilight deepened; great fire-flies began to flash
lanterns of pale topaz through the flowering trees; a little breeze
stole over the fern brakes, laden with the fragrances of the far
forest. Evalie sighed.</p>

<p>"You will not leave me, Tsantawu?"</p>

<p>If he heard her, he did not answer. She turned to me.</p>

<p>"You will not leave me&mdash;Leif?"</p>

<p>"No!" I said...and seemed to hear the drums of Khalk'ru beating
down the lilting tambours of the Little People like faraway mocking
laughter.</p>

<p>The green twilight had deepened into darkness, a luminous
darkness, as though a full moon were shining behind a cloud-veiled
sky. The golden pygmies had stilled their lilting drums; they were
passing into their cliff lairs. From the distant towers came the
tap-tap-tap of the drums of the guards, whispering to each other
across the thorn-covered slopes. The fire-flies' lights were like
the lanterns of a goblin watch; great moths floated by on luminous
silvery wings, like elfin planes.</p>

<p>"Evalie," Jim spoke. "The Yunwi Tsundi&mdash;the Little
People&mdash; how long have they dwelt here?"</p>

<p>"Always, Tsantawu&mdash;or so they say."</p>

<p>"And those others&mdash;the red-haired women?"</p>

<p>We had asked her of those women before, and she had not
answered, had tranquilly ignored the matter, but now she replied
without hesitation.</p>

<p>"They are of the Ayjir&mdash;it was Lur the Sorceress who wore
the wolfskin. She rules the Ayjir with Yodin the High Priest and
Tibur&mdash; Tibur the Laugher, Tibur the Smith. He is not so tall
as you, Leif, but he is broader of shoulder and girth, and he is
strong&mdash;strong! I will tell you of the Ayjir. Before it was as
though a hand were clasped over my lips &mdash;or was it my heart?
But now the hand is gone.</p>

<p>"The Little People say the Ayjir came riding here long and long
and long ago. Then the Rrrllya held the land on each side of the
river. There were many of the Ayjir&mdash;and many. Far more than
now, many men and women where now are mainly women and few men.
They came as though in haste from far away, or so the little people
say their fathers told them. They were led by a &mdash;by a&mdash;I
have no word! It has a name, but that name I will not
speak&mdash;no, not even within me! Yet it has a shape...I have
seen it on the banners that float from the towers of Karak...and it
is on the breasts of Lur and Tibur when they..."</p>

<p>She shivered and was silent. A silver-winged moth dropped upon
her hand, lifting and dropping its shining wings; gently she raised
it to her lips, wafted it away.</p>

<p>"All this the Rrrllya&mdash;whom you call the Little
People&mdash;did not then know. The Ayjir rested. They began to
build Karak, and to cut within the cliff their temple to&mdash;to
what had led them here. They built quickly at first, as though they
feared pursuit; but when none came, they built more slowly. They
would have made my little ones their servants, their slaves. The
Rrrllya would not have it so. There was war. The Little Ones lay in
wait around Karak, and when the Ayjir came forth, they killed them;
for the Little Ones know all the&mdash;the life of the plants, and
so they know how to make their spears and arrows slay at once those
whom they only touch. And so, many of the Ayjir died.</p>

<p>"At last a truce was made, and not because the Little People
were being beaten, for they were not. But for another reason. The
Ayjir were cunning; they laid traps for the little ones, and caught
a number. Then this they did &mdash;they carried them to the temple
and sacrificed them to&mdash;to that which had led them here. By
sevens they took them to the temple, and one out of each seven they
made watch that sacrifice, then released him to carry to the
Rrrllya the tale of what he had seen.</p>

<p>"The first they would not believe, so dreadful was the story of
that sacrifice&mdash;but then came the second and third and fourth
with the same story. And a great dread and loathing and horror fell
upon the Little People. They made a covenant. They would dwell upon
this side of the river; the Ayjir should have the other. In return
the Ayjir swore by what had led them that never more should one of
the Little People be given in sacrifice to it. If one were caught
in Ayjirland, he would be killed&mdash;but not by the Sacrifice.
And if any of the Ayjir should flee Karak, seek refuge among the
Rrrllya, they must kill that fugitive. To all of this, because of
that great horror, the Little People agreed. Nansur was broken, so
none could cross &mdash;Nansur, that spanned Nanbu, the white
river, was broken. All boats both of the Ayjir and the Rrrllya were
destroyed, and it was agreed no more should be built. Then, as
further guard, the Little People took the dalan'usa and set them in
Nanbu, so none could cross by its waters. And so it has been
&mdash;for long and long and long."</p>

<p>"Dalan'usa, Evalie&mdash;you mean the serpents?"</p>

<p>"Tlanu'si&mdash;the leech," said Jim.</p>

<p>"The serpents&mdash;they are harmless. I think you would not
have stopped to talk to Lur had you seen one of the dalan'usa,
Leif," said Evalie, half-maliciously.</p>

<p>I filed that enigma for further reference.</p>

<p>"Those two we found beneath the death flowers. They had broken
the truce?"</p>

<p>"Not broken it. They knew what to expect if found, and were
ready to pay. There are plants that grow on the farther side of
white Nanbu&mdash;and other things the Little Ones need, and they
are not to be found on this side. And so they swim Nanbu to get
them&mdash;the dalan'usa are their friends &mdash;and not often are
they caught there. But this day Lur was hunting a runaway who was
trying to make her way to Sirk, and she crossed their trail and ran
them down, and laid them beneath the Death Flowers."</p>

<p>"But what had the girl done&mdash;she was one of them?"</p>

<p>"She had been set apart for the Sacrifice. Did you not
see&mdash;she was taluli...with child...ripening for...for..."</p>

<p>Her voice trailed into silence. A chill touched me.</p>

<p>"But, of course, you know nothing of that," she said. "Nor will
I speak of it&mdash;now. If Sri and Sra had found the girl before
they, themselves, had been discovered, they would have guided her
past the dalan'usa&mdash;as they guided you; and here she would
have dwelt until the time came that she must pass out of herself.
She would have passed in sleep, in peace, without pain...and when
she awakened it would have been far from here...perhaps with no
memory of it...free. So it is that the Little People who love life
send forth those who must be sent."</p>

<p>She said it tranquilly, with clear eyes, untroubled.</p>

<p>"And are many sent forth so?"</p>

<p>"Not many, since few may pass the dalan'usa&mdash;yet many
try."</p>

<p>"Both men and women, Evalie?"</p>

<p>"Can men bear children?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" I asked, roughly enough; there had
been something in the question that somehow touched me in the
raw.</p>

<p>"Not now," she answered. "Besides, men are few in Karak, as I
told you. Of children born, not one in twenty is a man child. Do
not ask me why, for I do not know."</p>

<p>She arose, stood looking at us dreamily.</p>

<p>"Enough for to-night. You shall sleep in my tent. On the morrow
you shall have one of your own, and the Little People will cut you
a lair in the cliff next to mine. And you shall look on Karak,
standing on broken Nansur&mdash; and you shall see Tibur the
Laugher, since he always comes to Nansur's other side when I am
there. You shall see it all...on the morrow...or the morrow
after...or on another morrow. What does it matter, since every
morrow shall be ours, together. Is it not so?"</p>

<p>And again Jim made no answer.</p>

<p>"It is so, Evalie," I said.</p>

<p>She smiled at us, sleepily. She turned from us and floated
toward the darker shadow on the cliff which was the door to her
cave. She merged into the shadow, and was gone.</p>

<h2><a name="chap10" id="chap10"></a>10. &mdash; IF A MAN COULD USE
ALL HIS BRAIN</h2>

<p class="first">The drums of the sentinel dwarfs beat on softly,
talking to one another along the miles of circling scarp. And
suddenly I had a desperate longing for the Gobi. I don't know why,
but its barren and burning, wind-swept and sand-swept body was more
desirable than any woman's. It was like strong homesickness. I
found it hard to shake it off. I spoke at last in sheer
desperation. "You've been acting damned queer, Indian."</p>

<p>"Tsi Tsa'lagi&mdash;I told you&mdash;I'm all Cherokee."</p>

<p>"Tsantawu&mdash;It is I, Degataga, who speaks to you now." I had
dropped into the Cherokee; he answered:</p>

<p>"What is it my brother desires to know?"</p>

<p>"What it was the voices of the dead whispered that night we
slept beneath the spruces? What it was you knew to be truth by the
three signs they gave you. I did not hear the voices,
brother&mdash;yet by the blood rite they are my ancestors as they
are yours; and I have the right to know their words."</p>

<p>He said: "Is it not better to let the future unroll itself
without giving heed to the thin voices of the dead? Who can tell
whether the voices of ghosts speak truth?"</p>

<p>"Tsantawu points his arrow in one direction while his eyes look
the other. Once he called me dog slinking behind the heels of the
hunter. Since it is plain he still thinks me that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, Leif," he broke in, dropping the tribal tongue. "I only
mean I don't know whether it's truth. I know what Barr would call
it&mdash;natural apprehensions put subconsciously in terms of
racial superstitions. The voices &mdash;we'll call them that,
anyway&mdash;said great danger lay north. The Spirit that was north
would destroy them for ever and for ever if I fell in its hands.
They and I would be 'as though we never had been'. There was some
enormous difference between ordinary death and this peculiar death
that I couldn't understand. But the voices did. I would know by
three signs that they spoke truth, by Ataga'hi, by Usunhi'yi and by
the Yunwi Tsundi. I could meet the first two and still go back. But
if I went on to the third&mdash; it would be too late. They begged
me not to&mdash;this was peculiarly interesting, Leif&mdash;not to
let them be&mdash;dissolved."</p>

<p>"Dissolved!" I exclaimed. "But&mdash;that's the same word I
used. And it was hours after!"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's why I felt creepy when I heard you. You can't blame
me for being a little preoccupied when we came across the stony
flat that was like Ataga'hi, and more so when we struck the
coincidence of the Shadowed-land, which is pretty much the same as
Usunhi'yi, the Darkening-land. It's why I said if we ran across the
third, the Yunwi Tsundi, I'd take your interpretation rather than
Barr's. We did strike it. And if you think all those things aren't
a good reason for acting damned queer, as you put it,
well&mdash;what would you think a good one?"</p>

<p>Jim in the golden chains...Jim with the tentacle of that Dark
Power creeping, creeping toward him...my lips were dry and
stiff...</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me all that! I'd never have let you go
on!"</p>

<p>"I know it. But you'd have come back, wouldn't you,
old-timer?"</p>

<p>I did not answer; he laughed.</p>

<p>"How could I be sure until I saw all the signs?"</p>

<p>"But they didn't say you would be&mdash;dissolved," I clutched
at the straw. "They only said there was the danger."</p>

<p>"That's all."</p>

<p>"And what would I be doing? Jim&mdash;I'd kill you with my own
hand before I'd let what I saw happen in the Gobi happen to
you."</p>

<p>"If you could," he said, and I saw he was sorry he had said
it.</p>

<p>"If I could? What did they say about me&mdash;those damned
ancestors?"</p>

<p>"Not a damned thing," he answered, cheerfully. "I never said
they did. I simply reasoned that if we went on, and I was in
danger, so would you be. That's all."</p>

<p>"Jim&mdash;it isn't all. What are you keeping back?"</p>

<p>He arose, and stood over me.</p>

<p>"All right. They said that even if the Spirit didn't get me, I'd
never get out. Now you have the whole works."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, a burden rolling off me, "that's not so bad.
And, as for getting out&mdash;that may be as may be. One thing's
sure&mdash;if you stay, so do I."</p>

<p>He nodded, absently. I went on to something else that had been
puzzling me.</p>

<p>"The Yunwi Tsundi, Jim, what were they? You never told me
anything about them that I remember. What's the legend?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;the Little People," he squatted beside me, chuckling,
wide awake from his abstraction. "They were in Cherokee-land when
the Cherokees got there. They were a pygmy race, like those in
Africa and Australia to-day. Only they weren't blacks. These small
folk fit their description. Of course, the tribes did some
embroidering. They had them copper-colored and only two feet high.
These are golden-skinned and average three feet. At that, they may
have faded some here and put on height. Otherwise they square with
the accounts&mdash;long hair, perfect shape, drums and all."</p>

<p>He went on to tell of the Little People. They had lived in
caves, mostly in the region now Tennessee and Kentucky. They were
earth-folk, worshipers of life; and as such at times outrageously
Rabelaisian. They were friendly toward the Cherokees, but kept
rigorously to themselves and seldom were seen. They frequently
aided those who had got lost in the mountains, especially children.
If they helped anyone, and took him into their caves, they warned
him he mustn't tell where the caves were, or he would die. And, ran
the legends, if he told, he did die. If anyone ate their food he
had to be very careful when he returned to his tribe, and resume
his old diet slowly, or he would also die.</p>

<p>The Little People were touchy. If anyone followed them in the
woods, they cast a spell on him so that for days he had no sense of
location. They were expert wood and metal workers, and if a hunter
found in the forest a knife or arrow-head or any kind of trinket,
before he picked it up he had to say: "Little People, I want to
take this". If he didn't ask, he never killed any more game and
another misfortune came upon him. One which distressed his
wife.</p>

<p>They were gay, the Little People, and they spent half their time
in dancing and drumming. They had every kind of drum&mdash;drums
that would make trees fall, drums that brought sleep, drums that
drove to madness, drums that talked and thunder drums. The thunder
drums sounded just like thunder, and when the Little People beat on
them soon there was a real thunderstorm, because they sounded so
much like the actuality that it woke up the thunderstorms, and one
or more storm was sure to come poking around to gossip with what it
supposed a wandering member of the family...</p>

<p>I remembered the roll of thunder that followed the chanting; I
wondered whether that had been the Little People's defiance to
Khalk'ru...</p>

<p>"I've a question or two for you, Leif."</p>

<p>"Go right ahead, Indian."</p>

<p>"Just how much do you remember of&mdash;Dwayanu?"</p>

<p>I didn't answer at once; it was the question I had been dreading
ever since I had cried out to the Witch-woman on the white river's
bank.</p>

<p>"If you're thinking it over, all right. If you're thinking of a
way to stall, all wrong. I'm asking for a straight answer."</p>

<p>"Is it your idea that I'm that ancient Uighur, reborn? If it is,
maybe you have a theory as to where I've been during the thousands
of years between this time and now."</p>

<p>"Oh, so the same idea has been worrying you, has it? No,
reincarnation isn't what I had in mind. Although at that, we know
so damned little I wouldn't rule it out. But there may be a more
reasonable explanation. That's why I ask&mdash;what do you remember
of Dwayanu?"</p>

<p>I determined to make a clean breast of it.</p>

<p>"All right, Jim," I said. "That same question has been riding my
mind right behind Khalk'ru for three years. And if I can't find the
answer here, I'll go back to the Gobi for it&mdash;if I can get
out. When I was in that room of the oasis waiting the old priest's
call, I remembered perfectly well it had been Dwayanu's. I knew the
bed, and I knew the armour and the weapons. I stood looking at one
of the metal caps and I remembered that Dwayanu &mdash;or
I&mdash;had got a terrific clout with a mace when wearing it. I
took it down, and there was a dent in it precisely where I
remembered it had been struck. I remembered the swords, and
recalled that Dwayanu&mdash;or I &mdash;had the habit of using a
heavier one in the left hand than in the right. Well, one of them
was much heavier than the other. Also, in a fight I use my left
hand better than I do my right. These memories, or whatever they
were, came in flashes. For a moment I would be Dwayanu, plus
myself, looking with amused interest on old familiar
things&mdash;and the next moment I would be only myself and
wondering, with no amusement, what it all meant."</p>

<p>"Yes, what else?"</p>

<p>"Well, I wasn't entirely frank about the ritual matter," I said,
miserably. "I told you it was as though another person had taken
charge of my mind and gone on with it. That was true, in a
way&mdash;but God help me, I knew all the time that other person
was&mdash;myself! It was like being two people and one at the same
time. It's hard to make clear...you know how you can be saying one
thing and thinking another. Suppose you could be saying one thing
and thinking two things at once. It was like that. One part of me
was in revolt, horror-stricken, terrified. The other part was none
of those things; it knew it had power and was enjoying exercising
that power&mdash; and it had control of my will. But both
were&mdash;I. Unequivocally, unmistakably&mdash;I. Hell,
man&mdash;if I'd really believed it was somebody, something,
besides myself, do you suppose I'd feel the remorse I do? No, it's
because I knew it was I&mdash;the same part of me that knew the
helm and the swords, that I've gone hag-ridden ever since."</p>

<p>"Anything else?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Dreams."</p>

<p>He leaned over, and spoke sharply.</p>

<p>"What dreams?"</p>

<p>"Dreams of battles&mdash;dreams of feasts...a dream of war
against yellow men, and of a battlefield beside a river and of
arrows flying overhead in clouds...of hand-to-hand fights in which
I wield a weapon like a huge hammer against big yellow-haired men I
know are like myself...dreams of towered cities through which I
pass and where white, blue-eyed women toss garlands down for my
horse to trample...When I wake the dreams are vague, soon lost. But
always I know that while I dreamed them, they were clear,
sharp-cut&mdash;real as life..."</p>

<p>"Is that how you knew the Witch-woman was
Witch-woman&mdash;through those dreams?"</p>

<p>"If so, I don't remember. I only knew that suddenly I recognized
her for what she was&mdash;or that other self did."</p>

<p>He sat for a while in silence.</p>

<p>"Leif," he asked, "in those dreams do you ever take any part in
the service of Khalk'ru? Have anything at all to do with his
worship?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't. I'd remember that, by God! I don't even dream
of the temple in the Gobi!"</p>

<p>He nodded, as though I had confirmed some thought in his own
mind; then was quiet for so long that I became jumpy.</p>

<p>"Well, Old Medicine Man of the Tsa'lagi, what's the diagnosis?
Reincarnation, demonic possession, or just crazy?"</p>

<p>"Leif, you never had any of those dreams before the Gobi?"</p>

<p>"I did not."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I've been trying to think as Barr would, and
squaring it with my own gray matter. Here's the result. I think
that everything you've told me is the doing of your old priest. He
had you under his control when you saw yourself riding to the
Temple of Khalk'ru&mdash;and wouldn't go in. You don't know what
else he might have suggested at that time, and have commanded you
to forget consciously when you came to yourself. That's a simple
matter of hypnotism. But he had another chance at you. When you
were asleep that night. How do you know he didn't come in and do
some more suggesting? Obviously, he wanted to believe you were
Dwayanu. He wanted you to 'remember'&mdash;but having had one
lesson, he didn't want you to remember what went on with Khalk'ru.
That would explain why you dreamed about the pomp and glory and the
pleasant things, but not the unpleasant. He was a wise old
gentleman&mdash;you say that yourself. He knew enough of your
psychology to foresee you would balk at a stage of the ritual. So
you did &mdash;but he had tied you well up. Instantly the
post-hypnotic command to the subconscious operated. You couldn't
help going on. Although your conscious self was wide-awake, fully
aware, it had no control over your will. I think that's what Barr
would say. And I'd agree with him. Hell, there are drugs that do
all that to you. You don't have to go into migrations of the soul,
or demons, or any medieval matter to account for it."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, hopefully but doubtfully. "And how about the
Witch- woman?"</p>

<p>"Somebody like her in your dreams, but forgotten. I think the
explanation is what I've said. If it is, Leif, it worries me."</p>

<p>"I don't follow you there," I said.</p>

<p>"No? Well, think this over. If all these things that puzzle you
come from suggestions the old priest made&mdash;what else did he
suggest? Clearly, he knew something of this place. Suppose he
foresaw the possibility of your finding it. What would he want you
to do when you did find it? Whatever it was, you can bet your
chances of getting out that he planted it deep in your
subconscious. All right&mdash;that being a reasonable deduction,
what is it you will do when you come in closer contact with those
red-headed ladies we saw, and with the happy few gentlemen who
share their Paradise? I haven't the slightest idea&mdash;nor have
you. And if that isn't something to worry about, tell me what is.
Come on&mdash;let's go to bed."</p>

<p>We went into the tent. We had been in it before with Evalie. It
had been empty then except for a pile of soft pelts and silken
stuffs at one side. Now there were two such piles. We shed our
clothes in the pale green darkness and turned in. I looked at my
watch.</p>

<p>"Ten o'clock," I said. "How many months since morning?"</p>

<p>"At least six. If you keep me awake I'll murder you. I'm
tired."</p>

<p>So was I; but I lay long, thinking. I was not so convinced by
Jim's argument, plausible as it was. Not that I believed I had been
lying dormant in some extra-spatial limbo for centuries. Nor that I
had ever been this ancient Dwayanu. There was a third explanation,
although I didn't like it a bit better than than of reincarnation;
and it had just as many unpleasant possibilities as that of
Jim's.</p>

<p>Not long ago an eminent American physician and psychologist had
said he bad discovered that the average man used only about
one-tenth of his brain; and scientists generally agreed he was
right. The ablest thinkers, all-round geniuses, such as Leonardo da
Vinci and Michelangelo were, might use a tenth more. Any man who
could use all his brain could rule the world&mdash;but probably
wouldn't want to. In the human skull was a world only one-fifth
explored at the most.</p>

<p>What was in the terra incognita of the brain&mdash;the
unexplored eight- tenths?</p>

<p>Well, for one thing there might be a storehouse of ancestral
memories, memories reaching back to those of the hairy, ape-like
ancestors who preceded man, reaching beyond them even to those of
the flippered creatures who crawled out of the ancient seas to
begin their march to men&mdash;and further back to their ancestors
who had battled and bred in the steaming oceans when the continents
were being born.</p>

<p>Millions upon millions of years of memories! What a reservoir of
knowledge if man's consciousness could but tap it!</p>

<p>There was nothing more unbelievable in this than that the
physical memory of the race could be contained in the two single
cells which start the cycle of birth. In them are all the
complexities of the human body&mdash;brain and nerves, muscles,
bone and blood. In them, too, are those traits we call
hereditary&mdash;family resemblances, resemblances not only of face
and body but of thought, habits, emotions, reactions to
environment: grandfather's nose, great-grandmother's eyes,
great-great-grandfather's irascibility, moodiness or what not. If
all this can be carried in those seven and forty, and eight and
forty, microscopic rods within the birth cells which biologists
call the chromosomes, tiny mysterious gods of birth who determine
from the beginning what blend of ancestors a boy or girl shall be,
why could they not carry, too, the accumulated experiences, the
memories of those ancestors?</p>

<p>Somewhere in the human brain might be a section of records, each
neatly graven with lines of memories, waiting only for the needle
of consciousness to run over them to make them articulate.</p>

<p>Maybe the consciousness did now and then touch and read them.
Maybe there were a few people who by some freak had a limited power
of tapping their contents.</p>

<p>If that were true, it would explain many mysteries. Jim's
ghostly voices, for example. My own uncanny ability of picking up
languages.</p>

<p>Suppose that I had come straight down from this Dwayanu. And
that in this unknown world of my brain, my consciousness, that
which now was I, could and did reach in and touch those memories
that had been Dwayanu. Or that those memories stirred and reached
my consciousness? When that happened&mdash; Dwayanu would awaken
and live. And I would be both Dwayanu and Leif Langdon!</p>

<p>Might it not be that the old priest had known something of this?
By words and rites and by suggestion, even as Jim had said, had
reached into that terra incognita and wakened these memories that
were&mdash;Dwayanu?</p>

<p>They were strong&mdash;those memories. They had not been wholly
asleep; else I would not have learned so quickly the Uighur...nor
experienced those strange, reluctant flashes of recognition before
ever I met the old priest...</p>

<p>Yes, Dwayanu was strong. And in some way I knew he was ruthless.
I was afraid of Dwayanu&mdash;of those memories that once had been
Dwayanu. I had no power to arouse them, and I had no power to
control them. Twice they had seized my will, had pushed me
aside.</p>

<p>What if they grew stronger?</p>

<p>What if they became&mdash;all of me?</p>

<h2><a name="chap11" id="chap11"></a>11. &mdash; DRUMS OF THE
LITTLE PEOPLE</h2>

<p class="first">Six times the green light of the Shadowed-land had
darkened into the pale dusk that was its night, and I had heard
nothing, seen nothing of the Witch-woman or of any of those who
dwelt on the far side of the white river. They had been six days
and nights of curious interest. We had gone with Evalie among the
golden pygmies over all their guarded plain; and we had gone at
will among them, alone.</p>

<p>We had watched them at their work and at their play, listened to
their drumming and looked on in wonder at their dances&mdash;dances
so intricate, so extraordinary, that they were more like complex
choral harmonies than steps and gestures. Sometimes the Little
People danced in small groups of a dozen or so, and then it was
like some simple song. But sometimes they were dancing by the
hundreds, interlaced, over a score of the smooth-turfed dancing
greens; and then it was like symphonies translated into
choreographic measures.</p>

<p>They danced always to the music of their drums; they had no
other music, nor did they need any. The drums of the Little People
were of many shapes and sizes, in range covering all of ten
octaves, and producing not only the semitones of our own familiar
scale, but quarter and eighth-tones and even finer gradations that
oddly affect the listener&mdash;at least, they did me. They ranged
in pitch from the pipe organ's deepest bass to a high staccato
soprano. Some, the pygmies played with thumbs and fingers, and some
with palms of their hands, and some with sticks. There were drums
that whispered, drums that hummed, drums that laughed, and drums
that sang.</p>

<p>Dances and drums, but especially the drums, were evocative of
strange thoughts, strange pictures; the drums beat at the doors of
another world &mdash;and now and then opened them wide enough to
give a glimpse of fleeting, weirdly beautiful, weirdly disturbing,
images.</p>

<p>There must have been between four and five thousand of the
Little People in the approximately twenty square miles of
cultivated, fertile plain enclosed by their wall; how many outside
of it, I had no means of knowing. There were a score or more of
small colonies, Evalie told us. These were like hunting or mining
posts from which came the pelts, the metals and other things the
horde fashioned to their uses. At Nansur Bridge was a strong
warrior post. Some balance of nature, so far as I could learn from
her, kept them at about the same constant; they grew quickly into
maturity and their lives were not long.</p>

<p>She told us of Sirk, the city of those who had fled from the
Sacrifice. From her description an impregnable place, built against
the cliffs; walled; boiling springs welling up at the base of its
battlements and forming an impassable moat. There was constant
warfare between the people of Sirk and the white wolves of Lur,
lurking in the encompassing forest, keeping watch to intercept
those fleeing to it from Karak. I had the feeling that there was
furtive intercourse between Sirk and the golden pygmies, that
perhaps the horror of the Sacrifice which both shared, and the
revolt of those in Sirk against the worshipers of Khalk'ru was a
bond. And that when they could, the Little People helped them, and
would even join hands with them, were it not for the deep ancient
fear of what might follow should they break the compact their
forefathers had made with the Ayjir.</p>

<p>It was a thing Evalie said that made me think that.</p>

<p>"If you had turned the other way, Leif&mdash;and if you had
escaped the wolves of Lur&mdash;you would have come to Sirk. And a
great change might have grown from that, for Sirk would have
welcomed you, and who knows what might have followed, with you as
their leader. Nor would my Little People then..."</p>

<p>She stopped there, nor would she complete the sentence, for all
my urging. So I told her there were too many ifs about the matter,
and I was content that the dice had fallen as they had. It pleased
her.</p>

<p>I had one experience not shared by Jim. Its significance I did
not then recognize. The Little People were&mdash;as I have
said&mdash;worshipers of life. That was their whole creed and
faith. Here and there about the plain were small cairns, altars in
fact, upon which, cut from wood or stone or fossil ivory, were the
ancient symbols of fertility; sometimes singly, sometimes in pairs,
and sometimes in a form curiously like that same symbol of the old
Egyptians&mdash;the looped cross, the crux ansata which Osiris, God
of the Resurrection, carried in his hand and touched, in the Hall
of the Dead, those souls which had passed all tests and had earned
immortality.</p>

<p>It happened on the third day. Evalie bade me go with her, and
alone. We walked along the well-kept path that ran along the base
of the cliffs in which the pygmies had their lairs. The tiny
golden-eyed women peeped out at us and trilled to their dolls of
children as we passed. Groups of elders, both men and women, came
dancing toward us and fell in behind us as we went on. Each and all
carried drums of a type I had not yet seen. They did not beat them,
nor did they talk; group by group they dropped in behind us,
silently.</p>

<p>After a while I noticed that there were no more lairs. At the
end of half an hour we turned a bastion of the cliffs. We were at
the edge of a small meadow carpeted with moss, fine and soft as the
pile of a silken carpet. The meadow was perhaps five hundred feet
wide and about as many feet deep. Opposite me was another bastion.
It was as though a rounded chisel had been thrust down, cutting out
a semicircle in the precipice. At the far end of the meadow was
what, at first glance, I thought a huge domed building, and then
saw was an excrescence from the cliff itself.</p>

<p>In this rounded rock was an oval entrance, not much larger than
an average door. As I stood, wondering, Evalie took my hand and led
me toward it. We went through it.</p>

<p>The domed rock was hollow.</p>

<p>It was a temple of the Little People&mdash;I knew that, of
course, as soon as I had crossed the threshold. Its walls of some
cool, green stone curved smoothly up. It was not dark within the
temple. The rocky dome had been pierced as though by the needle of
a lace-maker, and through hundreds of the frets light streamed. The
walls caught it, and dispersed it from thousands of crystalline
angles within the stone. The floor was carpeted with the thick,
soft moss, and this was faintly luminous, adding to the strange
pellucid light; it must have covered at least two acres.</p>

<p>Evalie drew me forward. In the exact center of the floor was a
depression, like an immense bowl. Between it and me stood one of
the looped-cross symbols, thrice the height of a tall man. It was
polished, and glimmered as though cut from some enormous
amethystine crystal I glanced behind me. The pygmies who had
followed us were pouring through the oval doorway.</p>

<p>They crowded close behind us as Evalie again took my hand and
led me toward the cross. She pointed, and I peered down into the
bowl.</p>

<p>I looked upon the Kraken!</p>

<p>There it lay, sprawled out within the bowl, black tentacles
spread fanwise from its bloated body, its huge black eyes staring
inscrutably up into mine!</p>

<p>Resurgence of the old horror swept me. I jumped back with an
oath.</p>

<p>The pygmies were crowding around my knees, staring up at me
intently. I knew that my horror was written plain upon my face.
They began an excited trilling, nodding to one another,
gesticulating. Evalie watched them gravely, and then I saw her own
face lighten as though with relief.</p>

<p>She smiled at me, and pointed again to the bowl. I forced myself
to look. And now I saw that the shape within it had been cunningly
carved. The dreadful, inscrutable eyes were of jet-like jewel.
Through the end of each of the fifty-foot-long tentacles had been
driven one of the crux ansatas, pinioning it like a spike; and
through the monstrous body had been driven a larger one. I read the
meaning: life fettering the enemy of life; rendering it impotent;
prisoning it with the secret, ancient and holy symbol of that very
thing it was bent upon destroying. And the great looped-cross above
&mdash;watching and guarding like the god of life.</p>

<p>I heard a rippling and rustling and rushing from the drums. On
and on it went in quickly increasing tempo. There was triumph in
it&mdash;the triumph of onrushing conquering waves, the triumph of
the free rushing wind; and there was peace and surety of peace in
it&mdash;like the rippling song of little waterfalls chanting their
faith that "they will go on and on for ever", the rippling of
little waves among the sedges of the river-bank, and the rustling
of the rain bringing life to all the green things of earth.</p>

<p>Round the amethystine cross Evalie began to dance, circling it
slowly to the rippling, the rustling and the rushing music of the
drums. And she was the spirit of that song they sang, and the
spirit of all those things of which they sang.</p>

<p>Three times she circled it. She came dancing to me, took my hand
once more and led me away, out through the portal. From behind us,
as we passed through, there came a sustained rolling of the little
drums, no longer rippling, rustling, rushing&mdash;defiant now,
triumphal.</p>

<p>But of that ceremony, or of its reasons, or of the temple itself
she would speak no word thereafter, question her as I might.</p>

<p>And we still had to stand upon Nansur Bridge and look on towered
Karak.</p>

<p>"On the morrow," she would say; and when the morrow came, again
she would say&mdash;"on the morrow". When she answered me, she
would drop long lashes over the clear brown eyes and glance at me
from beneath them, strangely; or touch my hair and say that there
were many morrows and what did it matter on which of them we went,
since Nansur would not run away. There was some reluctance I could
not fathom. And day by day her sweetness and her beauty wound a web
around my heart until I began to wonder whether it might become a
shield against the touch of what I carried on my breast.</p>

<p>But the Little People still had their doubts about me, temple
ceremony or none; that was plain enough. Jim, they had taken to
their hearts; they twittered and trilled and laughed with him as
though he were one of them. They were polite and friendly enough to
me, but they watched me. Jim could take up the tiny doll-like
children and play with them. The mothers didn't like me to do that
and showed it very clearly. I received direct confirmation of how
they felt about me that morning.</p>

<p>"I'm going to leave you for two or three days, Leif," he told me
when we had finished breakfasting. Evalie had floated away on some
call from her small folk.</p>

<p>"Going to leave me!" I gaped at him in astonishment. "What do
you mean? Where are you going?"</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"Going to look at the tlanu'si&mdash;what Evalie calls the
dalan'usa &mdash;the big leeches. The river guards she told us the
pygmies put on the job when the bridge was broken."</p>

<p>She had not spoken about them again, and I had forgotten all
about them.</p>

<p>"What are they, Indian?"</p>

<p>"That's what I'm going to find out. They sound like the great
leech of Tlanusi'yi. The tribes said it was red with white stripes
and as big as a house. The Little People don't go that far. They
only say they're as big as you are."</p>

<p>"Listen, Indian&mdash;I'm going along."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you're not."</p>

<p>"I'd like to know why not."</p>

<p>"Because the Little People won't let you. Now listen to me,
old-timer &mdash;the plain fact is that they're not entirely
satisfied about you. They're polite, and they wouldn't hurt
Evalie's feelings for the world, but &mdash;they'd much rather be
without you."</p>

<p>"You're telling me nothing new," I said.</p>

<p>"No, but here is something new. A party that's been on a hunting
trip down the other end of the valley came in yesterday. One of
them remembered his grandfather had told him that when the Ayjir
came riding into this place they all had yellow hair like yours.
Not the red they have now. It's upset them."</p>

<p>"I thought they'd been watching me pretty damned close the last
twenty- four hours," I said. "So that's the reason, is it?"</p>

<p>"That's the reason, Leif. It's upset them. It's also the reason
for this expedition to the tlanu'si. They're going to increase the
river guard. It involves some sort of ceremony, I gather. They want
me to go along. I think it better that I do."</p>

<p>"Does Evalie know all this?"</p>

<p>"Sure she does. And she wouldn't let you go, even if the pygmies
would."</p>

<p>Jim left with a party of about a hundred of the pygmies about
noon. I bade him a cheerful good-bye. If it puzzled Evalie that I
took his departure so calmly, and asked her no questions she did
not show it. But she was very quiet that day, speaking mostly in
monosyllables abstractedly. Once or twice I caught her looking at
me with a curious wonder in her eyes. And once I had taken her
hand, and she had quivered and leaned toward me, and then snatched
it away, half-angrily. And once when she had forgotten her
moodiness and had rested against my shoulder, I had fought hard
against taking her in my arms.</p>

<p>The worst of it was that I could find no cogent argument why I
shouldn't take her. A voice within my mind was whispering that if I
so desired, why should I not? And there were other things besides
that whisper which sapped my resistance. It had been a queer day
even for this queer place. The air was heavy, as though a storm
brooded. The heady fragrances from the far forest were stronger,
clinging amorously, confusing. The vaporous veils that hid the
distances had thickened; at the north they were almost smoke color,
and they marched slowly but steadily nearer.</p>

<p>We sat, Evalie and I, beside her tent. She broke a long
silence.</p>

<p>"You are sorrowful, Leif&mdash;and why?"</p>

<p>"Not sorrowful, Evalie&mdash;just wondering."</p>

<p>"I, too, am wondering. Is it what you wonder?"</p>

<p>"How do I know&mdash;who know nothing of your mind?"</p>

<p>She stood up, abruptly.</p>

<p>"You like to watch the smiths. Let us go to them."</p>

<p>I looked at her, struck by the anger in her voice. She frowned
down upon me, brows drawn to a straight line over bright,
half-contemptuous eyes.</p>

<p>"Why are you angry, Evalie? What have I done?"</p>

<p>"I am not angry. And you have done nothing." She stamped her
foot. "I say you have done&mdash;nothing! Let us watch the
smiths."</p>

<p>She walked away. I sprang up, and followed her. What was the
matter with her? I had done something to irritate her, that was
certain. But what? Well, I'd know, sooner or later. And I did like
to watch the smiths. They stood beside their small anvils beating
out the sickled knives, the spear and arrowheads, shaping the
earrings and bracelets of gold for their tiny women.</p>

<p>Tink-a-tink, tink-a-clink, cling-clang, clink-a-tink&mdash;went
their little hammers.</p>

<p>They stood beside their anvils like gnomes, except that there
was no deformity about them. Miniature men they were, perfectly
shaped, gleaming golden in the darkening light, long hair coiled
about their heads, yellow eyes intent upon their forgings. I forgot
Evalie and her wrath, watching them as ever, fascinated.</p>

<p>Tink-a-tink! Cling-clang! Clink&mdash;</p>

<p>The little hammers hung suspended in air; the little smiths
stood frozen. Speeding from the north came the hum of a great gong,
a brazen stroke that seemed to break overhead. It was followed by
another and another and another. A wind wailed over the plain; the
air grew darker, the vaporous smoky veils quivered and marched
closer.</p>

<p>The clangor of the gongs gave way to a strong chanting, the
singing of many people; the chanting advanced and retreated, rose
and waned as the wind rose and fell, rose and fell in rhythmic
pulse. From all the walls the drums of the guards roared
warning.</p>

<p>The little smiths dropped their hammers and raced to the lairs.
Over all the plain there was turmoil, movement of the golden
pygmies racing to the cliffs and to the circling slope to swell the
garrisons there.</p>

<p>Through the strong chanting came the beat of other drums. I knew
them &mdash;the throb of the Uighur kettle-drums, the war drums.
And I knew the chant&mdash;it was the war song, the battle song of
the Uighurs. Not the Uighurs, no&mdash;not the patched and paltry
people I had led from the oasis! War song of the ancient race! The
great race&mdash;the Ayjir!</p>

<p>The old race! My people! I knew the song&mdash;well did I know
it! Often and often had I heard it in the olden days...when I had
gone forth to battle...By Zarda of the Thirsty Spears...by Zarda
God of Warriors, but it was like drink to a parched throat to hear
it again!</p>

<p>My blood drummed in my ears...I opened my throat to roar that
song...</p>

<p>"Leif! Leif! What is the matter?" Evalie's hands were on my
shoulders, shaking me!</p>

<p>I glared at her, uncomprehending for a moment. I felt a strange,
angry bafflement. Who was this dark girl that checked me on my way
to war? And abruptly the obsession left me. It left me trembling,
shaken at though by some brief wild tempest of the mind. I put my
own hands upon those on my shoulders, drew reality from the touch.
I saw that there was amazement in Evalie's eyes, and something of
fear. And around us was a ring of the Little People, staring up at
me. I shook my head, gasping for breath.</p>

<p>"Leif! What is the matter?"</p>

<p>Before I could answer, chanting and drums were drowned in a
bellow of thunder. Peal upon peal of thunder roared and echoed over
the plain, beating back, beating down the sounds from the
north&mdash;roaring over them, rolling over them, sweeping them
back.</p>

<p>I stared stupidly around me. All along the cliffs were the
golden pygmies, scores of them, beating upon great drums high as
their waists. From those drums came the pealing of thunder, claps
and shattering strokes of the bolt's swift fall, and the shouting
reverberations that follow it.</p>

<p>The Thunder Drums of the Little People!</p>

<p>On and on roared the drums, yet through their rolling diapason
beat ever the battle chant and those other drums...like thrusts of
lances...like trampling of horses and of marching men...by Zarda,
but the old race still was strong...</p>

<p>A ring of the Little People was dancing around me. Another ring
joined them. Beyond them I saw Evalie, watching me with wide,
astonished eyes. And around her was another ring of the golden
pygmies, arrows at readiness, sickled knives in hand.</p>

<p>Why was she watching me...why were the arms of the Little People
turned against me...and why were they dancing? That was a strange
dance...it made you sleepy to look at it...what was this lethargy
creeping over me...God, but I was sleepy! So sleepy that my dull
ears could hardly hear the Thunder Drums...so sleepy I could hear
nothing else...so sleepy...I knew, dimly, that I had dropped to my
knees, then had fallen prone upon the soft turf... then slept.</p>

<p>I awakened, every sense alert. The drums were throbbing all
around me. Not the Thunder Drums, but drums that sang, drums that
throbbed and sang to some strange lilting rhythm that set the blood
racing through me in tune and in time with its joyousness. The
throbbing, singing notes were like tiny, warm, vital blows that
whipped my blood into ecstasy of life.</p>

<p>I leaped to my feet. I stood upon a high knoll, round as a
woman's breast. Over all the plain were lights, small fires
burning, ringing the little altars of the pygmies. And around the
fires the Little People were dancing to the throbbing drums. Around
the fires and the altars they danced and leaped like little golden
flames of life made animate.</p>

<p>Circling the knoll on which I stood was a triple ring of the
dwarfs, women and men, weaving, twining, swaying.</p>

<p>They and the burden of the drums were one.</p>

<p>A soft and scented wind was blowing over the knoll. It hummed as
it streamed by&mdash;and its humming was akin to dance and
drum.</p>

<p>In and out, and round about and out and in and back again, the
golden pygmies danced around the knoll. And round and round and
back again they circled the fire-ringed altars.</p>

<p>I heard a sweet low voice singing&mdash;singing to the cadence,
singing the song of the drums, singing the dancing of the Little
People.</p>

<p>Close by was another knoll like that on which I was&mdash;like a
pair of woman's high breasts they stood above the plain. It, too,
was circled by the dancing dwarfs.</p>

<p>On it sang and danced Evalie.</p>

<p>Her singing was the soul of drum song and dance&mdash;her
dancing was the sublimation of both. She danced upon the
knoll&mdash;cobweb veils and girdle gone, clothed only in the
silken, rippling cloak of her blue-black hair.</p>

<p>She beckoned, and she called to me&mdash;a high-pitched, sweet
call.</p>

<p>The fragrant, rushing wind pushed me toward her as I ran down
the mound.</p>

<p>The dancing pygmies parted to let me through. The throbbing of
the drums grew swifter; their song swept into a higher octave.</p>

<p>Evalie came dancing down to meet me...she was beside me, her
arms round my neck, her lips pressed to mine...The drums beat
faster. My pulses matched them.</p>

<p>The two rings of little yellow living flames of life joined.
They became one swirling circle that drove us forward. Round and
round and round us they swirled, driving us on and on to the pulse
of the drums. I ceased to think &mdash;drum-throb, drum-song,
dance-song were all of me.</p>

<p>Yet still I knew that the fragrant wind thrust us on and on,
caressing, murmuring, laughing.</p>

<p>We were beside an oval doorway. The silken, scented tresses of
Evalie streamed in the wind and kissed me. Beyond and behind us
sang the drums. And ever the wind pressed us on...</p>

<p>Drums and wind drove us through the portal of the domed
rock.</p>

<p>They drove us into the temple of the Little People...</p>

<p>The soft moss glimmered...the amethystine cross gleamed...</p>

<p>Evalie's arms were around my neck&mdash;I held her close...the
touch of her lips to mine was like the sweet, secret fire of
life...</p>

<p>It was silent in the temple of the Little People. Their drums
were silent. The glow of the looped cross above the pit of the
Kraken was dim.</p>

<p>Evalie stirred and cried out in her sleep. I touched her lips
and she awoke.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Evalie?"</p>

<p>"Leif, beloved&mdash;I dreamed a white falcon tried to dip its
beak into my heart!"</p>

<p>"It was but a dream, Evalie."</p>

<p>She shuddered; she raised her head and bent over me so that her
hair covered our faces.</p>

<p>"You drove the falcon away&mdash;but then a white wolf
came...and leaped upon me."</p>

<p>"It was only a dream, Evalie&mdash;bright flame of my
heart."</p>

<p>She bent closer to me under the tent of her hair, lips close to
mine.</p>

<p>"You drove the wolf away. And I would have kissed you...but a
face came between ours..."</p>

<p>"A face, Evalie?"</p>

<p>She whispered:</p>

<p>"The face of Lur! She laughed at me...and then you were
gone...with her...and I was alone..."</p>

<p>"It was a lying dream, that! Sleep, beloved."</p>

<p>She sighed. There was a long silence; then drowsily:</p>

<p>"What is it you carry round your neck, Leif? Something from some
woman that you treasure?"</p>

<p>"Nothing of woman, Evalie. That is truth."</p>

<p>She kissed me&mdash;and slept.</p>

<p>Fool that I was not to have told her then, under the shadow of
the ancient symbol...Fool that I was&mdash;I did not!</p>

<h2><a name="chap12" id="chap12"></a>12. &mdash; ON NANSUR
BRIDGE</h2>

<p class="first">When we went out of the temple into the morning
there were half a hundred of the elders, men and women, patiently
awaiting our appearance. I thought they were the same who had
followed into the domed rock when I had first entered it.</p>

<p>The little women clustered around Evalie. They had brought wraps
and swathed her from head to feet. She walked off among them with
never a glance nor a word for me. There was something quite
ceremonial about it all; she looked for all the world like a bride
being led away by somewhat mature elfin bridesmaids.</p>

<p>The little men clustered around me. Sri was there. I was glad of
that, for, whatever the doubts of the others about me, I knew he
had none. They bade me go with them, and I obeyed without
question.</p>

<p>It was raining, and it was both jungle-wet and jungle-warm. The
wind was blowing in the regular, rhythmic gusts of the night
before. The rain seemed less to fall than to condense in great
drops from the air about, except when the wind blew and then the
rain drove by in almost level lines. The air was like fragrant
wine. I felt like singing and dancing. There was thunder all
around&mdash;not the drums, but real thunder.</p>

<p>I had been wearing only my shirt and my trousers. I had
discarded my knee- high boots for sandals. It was only a minute or
two before I was soaking wet. We came to a steaming pool and there
we halted. Sri told me to strip and plunge in.</p>

<p>The pool was hot and invigorating and as I splashed around in it
I kept feeling better and better. I reflected that whatever had
been in the minds of the Little People when they had driven Evalie
and me into the temple, their fear of me had been
exorcized&mdash;for the time at any rate. But I thought I knew what
had been in their minds. They suspected that Khalk'ru had some hold
on me, as over the people I resembled. Not much of a hold
maybe&mdash; but still it was not to be ignored. Very
well&mdash;the remedy, since they couldn't kill me without breaking
Evalie's heart, was to spike me down as they had the Kraken which
was Khalk'ru's symbol. So they had spiked me down with Evalie.</p>

<p>I climbed out of the pool, more thoughtful than I had gone into
it. They wrapped a loin cloth around me, in curious folds and
knots. Then they trilled and twittered and laughed, and danced.</p>

<p>Sri had my clothes and belt. I didn't want to lose them, so when
we started off I kept close behind him. Soon we stopped&mdash;in
front of Evalie's lair.</p>

<p>After a while there was a great commotion, singing and beating
of drums, and along came Evalie with a crowd of the little women
dancing around her. They led her to where I was waiting. Then all
of them danced away.</p>

<p>That was all there was to it. The ceremony, if ceremony it was,
was finished. But, somehow, I felt very much married.</p>

<p>I looked down at Evalie. She looked up at me, demurely. Her hair
was no longer free, but braided cunningly around head and ears and
neck. The swathings were gone. She wore the little apron of the
pygmy matrons and the silvery cobweb veils. She laughed, and took
my hand, and we went into the lair.</p>

<p>Next day, late in the afternoon, we heard a fanfare of trumpets
that sounded rather close. They blew long and loudly, as though
summoning someone. We stepped out into the rain, to listen better.
I noted that the wind had changed from north to west, and was
blowing steadily and strongly. By this time I knew that the
acoustics of the land under the mirage were peculiar and that there
was no way of telling just how close the trumpets were. They were
on the far side of the river bank of course, but how far away the
pygmies' guarded slope was from the river, I did not know. There
was some bustling on the wall, but no excitement.</p>

<p>There came a final trumpet blast, raucous and derisive. It was
followed by a roar of laughter more irritatingly mocking because of
its human quality. It brought me out of my indifference with a
jump. It made me see red.</p>

<p>"That," said Evalie, "was Tibur. I suppose he has been hunting
with Lur. I think he was laughing at&mdash;you, Leif."</p>

<p>Her delicate nose was turned up disdainfully, but there was a
smile at the corner of her lips as she watched my quick anger flare
up.</p>

<p>"See here, Evalie, just who is this Tibur?"</p>

<p>"I told you. He is Tibur the Smith, and he rules the Ayjir with
Lur. Always does he come when I stand on Nansur. We have talked
together&mdash; often. He is very strong&mdash;oh, strong."</p>

<p>"Yes?" I said, still more irritated. "And why does Tibur come
when you are there?"</p>

<p>"Why, because he desires me, of course," she said
tranquilly.</p>

<p>My dislike for Tibur the Laugher increased.</p>

<p>"He'll not laugh if I ever get an opening at him," I
muttered.</p>

<p>"What did you say?" she asked. I translated, as best t could.
She nodded and began to speak&mdash;and then I saw her eyes open
wide and stark terror fill them. I heard a whirring over my
head.</p>

<p>Out of the mists had flown a great bird. It hovered fifty feet
over us, glaring down with baleful yellow eyes. A great
bird&mdash;a white bird...</p>

<p>The white falcon of the Witch-woman!</p>

<p>I thrust Evalie back into the lair, and watched it. Thrice it
circled over me, and then, screaming, hurtled up into the mists and
vanished.</p>

<p>I went in to Evalie. She was crouched on the couch of skins. She
had undone her hair and it streamed over her head and shoulders,
hiding her like a cloak. I bent over her, and parted it. She was
crying. She put her arms around my neck, and held me close, close.
I felt her heart beating like a drum against mine.</p>

<p>"Evalie, beloved&mdash;there's nothing to be afraid of."</p>

<p>"The&mdash;white falcon, Leif!"</p>

<p>"It is only a bird."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;Lur sent it."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, dark sweetheart. A bird flies where it wills. It was
hunting &mdash;or it had lost its way in the mists."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"But, Leif, I&mdash;dreamed of a white falcon..."</p>

<p>I held her tight, and after a while she pushed me away and
smiled at me. But there was little of gaiety the remainder of that
day. And that night her dreams were troubled, and she held me close
to her, and cried and murmured in her sleep.</p>

<p>The next day Jim came back. I had been feeling a bit
uncomfortable about his return. What would he think of me? I
needn't have worried. He showed no surprise at all when I laid the
cards before him. And then I realized that of course the pygmies
must have been talking to one another by their drums, and that they
would have gone over matters with him.</p>

<p>"Good enough," said Jim, when I had finished. "If you don't get
out, it's the best thing for both of you. If you do get out, you'll
take Evalie with you&mdash;or won't you?"</p>

<p>That stung me.</p>

<p>"Listen, Indian&mdash;I don't like the way you're talking! I
love her."</p>

<p>"All right. I'll put it another way. Does Dwayanu love her?"</p>

<p>That question was like a slap on my mouth. While I struggled for
an answer, Evalie ran out. She went over to Jim and kissed him. He
patted her shoulder and hugged her like a big brother. She glanced
at me, and came to me, and drew my head down to her and kissed me
too, but not exactly the way she had kissed him.</p>

<p>I glanced over her head at Jim. Suddenly I noticed that he
looked tired and haggard.</p>

<p>"You're, feeling all right, Jim?"</p>

<p>"Sure. Only a bit weary. I've&mdash;seen things."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Well," he hesitated, "well&mdash;the tlanu'si&mdash;the big
leeches &mdash;for one thing. I'd never have believed it if I
hadn't seen them, and if I had seen them before we dived into the
river, I'd have picked the wolves as cooing doves in
comparison."</p>

<p>He told me they had camped at the far end of the plain that
night.</p>

<p>"This place is bigger than we thought, Leif. It must be, because
I've gone more miles than would be possible if it were only as
large as it looked before we went through the mirage. Probably the
mirage foreshortened it &mdash;confused us."</p>

<p>The next day they had gone through forest and jungle and
cane-brake and marsh. They had come at last to a steaming swamp. A
raised path ran across it. They had taken that path, and eventually
came to another transecting it. Where the two causeways met, there
was a wide, circular and gently rounded mound rising from the
swamp. Here the pygmies had halted. They had made fires of fagots
and leaves. The fires sent up a dense and scented smoke which
spread slowly out from the mound over the swamp. When the fires
were going well, the pygmies began drumming&mdash;a queerly
syncopated beat. In a few moments he had seen a movement in the
swamp, close by the mound.</p>

<p>"There was a ring of pygmies between me and the edge," he said,
"and when I saw the thing that crawled out I was glad of it. First
there was an upheaval of the mud, and then up came the back of what
I thought was an enormous red slug. The slug raised itself, and
crept out on land. It was a leech all right, and that was all it
was&mdash;but it made me more than a bit sick. It was its size that
did that. It must have been seven feet long, and it lay there,
blind and palpitating, its mouth gaping, listening to the drums and
luxuriating in that scented smoke. Then another and another came
out. After a while there were a hundred of the things grouped
around in a semicircle, eyeless heads all turned to
us&mdash;sucking in the smoke, palpitating to the drums.</p>

<p>"Some of the pygmies got up, took burning sticks from the fire
and started off on the intersecting causeway, drumming as they
went. The others quenched the fires. The leeches writhed along
after the torch-bearers. The other pygmies fell in behind, herding
them. I stuck in the rear. We went along until we came to the bank
of the river. Those in the lead stopped drumming. They threw their
smoking, blazing sticks into the water, and they cast into it
handfuls of crushed berries&mdash;not the ones Sri and Sra rubbed
on us. Red berries. The big leeches went writhing over the bank and
into the river, following, I suppose, the smoke and the scent of
the berries. Anyway, they went in&mdash;each and all of them.</p>

<p>"We went back, and out of the marsh. We camped on its edge. All
that night they talked with the drums.</p>

<p>"They had talked the night before, and were uneasy; but I took
it that it was the same worry they had when we started. They must
have known what was going on, but they didn't tell me then.
Yesterday morning, though, they were happy and carefree. I knew
something must have happened&mdash;that they must have got good
news in the night. They were so good-natured that they told me why
they were. Not just as you have&mdash;but the sense was the
same&mdash;"</p>

<p>He chuckled.</p>

<p>"That morning we herded up a couple of hundred more of the
tlanu'si and put them where the Little People think they'll do the
most good. Then we started back&mdash;and here I am."</p>

<p>"Yes," I asked suspiciously. "And is that all?"</p>

<p>"All for to-night, anyway," he said. "I'm sleepy. I'm going to
turn in. You go with Evalie and leave me strictly alone till
to-morrow."</p>

<p>I left him to sleep, determined to find out in the morning what
he was holding back; I didn't think it was entirely the journey and
the leeches that accounted for his haggardness.</p>

<p>But in the morning I forgot all about it.</p>

<p>In the first place, when I awoke, Evalie was missing. I went
over to the tent, looking for Jim. He was not there. The Little
People had long since poured out of the cliffs, and were at work;
they always worked in the morning &mdash;afternoons and nights they
played and drummed and danced. They said Evalie and Tsantawu had
gone into council with the elders. I went back to the tent.</p>

<p>In a little while Evalie and Jim came up. Evalie's face was
white and her eyes were haunted. Also they were misty with tears.
Also, she was madder than hell. Jim was doing his best to be
cheerful.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You're due for a little trip," said Jim. "You've been wanting
to see Nansur Bridge, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes." I said.</p>

<p>"Well," said Jim. "That's where we're going. Better put on your
traveling clothes and your boots. If the trail is anything like
what I've just gone over, you'll need them. The Little People can
slip through things&mdash;but we're built different."</p>

<p>I studied them, puzzled. Of course I'd wanted to see Nansur
Bridge&mdash; but why should the fact we were to go there make them
behave so oddly? I went to Evalie, and turned her face up to
mine.</p>

<p>"You've been crying, Evalie. What's wrong?"</p>

<p>She shook her head, slipped out of my arms and into the lair. I
followed her. She was bending over a coffer, taking yards and yards
of veils out of it. I swung her away from it and lifted her until
her eyes were level with mine.</p>

<p>"What's wrong, Evalie?"</p>

<p>A thought struck me. I lowered her to her feet.</p>

<p>"Who suggested going to Nansur Bridge?"</p>

<p>"The Little People...the elders...I fought against it...I don't
want you to go...they say you must..."</p>

<p>"I must go?" The thought grew clearer. "Then you need not
go&mdash;nor Tsantawu. Unless you choose?"</p>

<p>"Let them try to keep me from going with you." She stamped a
foot furiously.</p>

<p>The thought was crystal clear, and I began to feel a bit
irritated by the Little People. They were thorough to the point of
annoyance. I now understood perfectly why I was to go to Nansur
Bridge. The pygmies were not certain that their
magic&mdash;including Evalie&mdash;had thoroughly taken. Therefore
I was to look upon the home of the enemy&mdash;and be watched for
my reactions. Well, that was fair enough, at that. Maybe the
Witch-woman would be there. Maybe Tibur&mdash;Tibur who desired
Evalie&mdash;Tibur who had laughed at me. Suddenly I was keen for
going to Nansur Bridge. I began to put on my old clothes. As I was
tying the high shoes, I glanced over at Evalie. She had coiled her
hair and covered it with a cap; she had swathed her body from neck
to knees in the veils and she was lacing high sandals that covered
her feet and legs as completely as my boots did mine. She smiled
faintly at my look of wonder.</p>

<p>"I do not like Tibur to look on me&mdash;not now!" she said.</p>

<p>I bent over her and took her in my arms. She set her lips to
mine in a kiss that bruised them...When we came out, Jim and about
fifty of the pygmies were waiting.</p>

<p>We struck diagonally across the plain away from the cliffs,
heading north toward the river. We went over the slope, past one of
the towers, and put feet on a narrow path like that which we had
trod when coming into the land of the Little People. It wound
through a precisely similar fern-brake. We went along it single
file, and, perforce, in silence. We came out of it into a forest of
close-growing, coniferous trees, through which the trail wound
tortuously. We went through this for an hour or more, without once
resting, the pygmies trotting along tirelessly. I looked at my
watch. We had been going for four hours and had covered, I
calculated, about twelve miles. There was no sign of bird or animal
life.</p>

<p>Evalie seemed deep in thought and Jim had fallen into one of his
fits of Indian taciturnity. I didn't feel much like talking. It was
a silent journey; not even the golden pygmies chattered, as was
their habit. We came to a sparkling spring, and drank. One of the
dwarfs swung a small cylindrical drum in front of him and began to
tap out some message. It was answered at length from far ahead by
other tappings.</p>

<p>We swung into our way once more. The conifers began to thin. At
our left and far below us I began to catch glimpses of the white
river and of the dense forest on its opposite bank. The conifers
ceased and we came out upon a rocky waste. Just ahead of us was an
outthrust of cliff along whose base streamed the white river. The
out-thrust cut off our view of what lay beyond. Here the pygmies
halted and sent another drum message. The answer was startlingly
close. Then around the edge of the cliff, half-way up, spear tips
glinted. A group of little warriors stood there, scrutinizing us.
They signalled, and we marched forward, over the waste.</p>

<p>There was a broad road up the side of the cliff, wide enough for
six horses abreast. We climbed it. We came to the top, and I looked
on Nansur Bridge and towered Karak.</p>

<p>Once, thousands or hundreds of thousands of years ago, there had
been a small mountain here, rising from the valley floor. Nanbu,
the white river, had eaten it away&mdash;all except a vein of black
adamantine rock.</p>

<p>Nanbu had fallen, fallen, steadily gnawing at the softer stone
until at last it was spanned by a bridge that was like a rainbow of
jet. That gigantic bow of black rock winged over the abyss with the
curved flight of an arrow.</p>

<p>Its base, on each side, was a mesa&mdash;sculptured as Nansur
had been from the original mount.</p>

<p>The mesa, at whose threshold I stood, was flat-topped. But on
the opposite side of the river, thrusting up from the mesa-top, was
a huge, quadrangular pile of the same black rock as the bow of
Nansur. It looked less built from than cut out of that rock. It
covered I judged about half a square mile. Towers and turrets both
square and round sprang up from it. It was walled.</p>

<p>There was something about that immense ebon citadel that struck
me with the same sense of foreknowledge that I had felt when I had
ridden into the ruins of the Gobi oasis. Also I thought it looked
like that city of Dis which Dante glimpsed in Hades. And its
antiquity hung over it like a sable garment.</p>

<p>Then I saw that Nansur was broken. Between the arch that winged
from the side on which we stood and the arch that swept up and out
from the side of the black citadel, there was a gap. It was as
though a gigantic hammer had been swung down on the soaring bow,
shattering it at its center. I thought of Bifrst Bridge over which
the Valkyries rode, bearing the souls of the warriors to Valhalla;
and I thought it had been as great a blasphemy to have broken
Nansur Bridge as it would have been to have broken Bifrst.</p>

<p>Around the citadel were other buildings, hundreds of them
outside its walls&mdash;buildings of gray and brown stone, with
gardens; they stretched over acres. And on each side of this city
were fertile fields and flowering groves. There was a wide road
stretching far, far away to cliffs shrouded in the green veils. I
thought I saw the black mouth of a cavern at its end.</p>

<p>"Karak!" whispered Evalie. "And Nansur Bridge! And Oh, Leif,
beloved... but my heart is heavy...so heavy!"</p>

<p>I hardly heard her, looking at Karak. Stealthy memories had
begun to stir. I trod on them, and put my arm around Evalie. We
went on, and now I saw why Karak had been built where it was, for
on the far side the black citadel commanded both ends of the
valley, and when Nansur had been unbroken, it had commanded this
approach as well.</p>

<p>Suddenly I felt a feverish eagerness to run out upon Nansur and
look down on Karak from the broken end. I was restive at the
slowness of the pygmies. I started forward. The garrison came
crowding around me, staring up at me, whispering to one another,
studying me with their yellow eyes. Drums began to beat.</p>

<p>They were answered by trumpets from the citadel.</p>

<p>I walked ever more rapidly toward Nansur. The fever of eagerness
had become consuming. I wanted to run. I pushed the golden pygmies
aside impatiently. Jim's voice came to me, warningly:</p>

<p>"Steady, Leif&mdash;steady!"</p>

<p>I paid no heed. I went out upon Nansur. Vaguely, I realized that
it was wide and that low parapets guarded its edges, and that the
stone was ramped for the tread of horses and the tread of marching
men. And that if the white river had shaped it, the hands of men
had finished its carving.</p>

<p>I reached the broken end. A hundred feet below me the white
river raced smoothly. There were no serpents. A dull red body,
slug-like, monstrous, lifted above the milky current; then another
and another, round mouths gaping &mdash;the leeches of the Little
People, on guard.</p>

<p>There was a broad plaza between the walls of the dark citadel
and the end of the bridge. It was empty. Set in the walls were
massive gates of bronze. I felt a curious quivering inside me, a
choking in my throat. I forgot Evalie; I forgot Jim; I forgot
everything in watching those gates.</p>

<p>There was a louder blaring of the trumpets, a clanging of bars,
and the gates swung open. Through them galloped a company, led by
two riders, one on a great black horse, the other upon a white.
They raced across the plaza, dropped from their mounts and came
walking over the bridge. They stood facing me across the fifty-foot
gap.</p>

<p>The one who had ridden the black horse was the Witch-woman, and
the other I knew for Tibur the Smith&mdash;Tibur the Laugher. I had
no eyes just then for the Witch-woman or her followers. I had eyes
only for Tibur.</p>

<p>He was a head shorter than I, but strength as great or greater
than mine spoke from the immense shoulders, the thick body. His red
hair hung sleekly straight to his shoulders. He was red-bearded.
His eyes were violet-blue and lines of laughter crinkled at their
comers; and the wide, loose mouth was a laughing mouth. But the
laughter which had graven those lines on Tibur's face was not the
kind to make the bearer merry.</p>

<p>He wore a coat of mail. At his left side hung a huge war hammer.
He looked me over from head to foot and back again with narrowed,
mocking eyes. If I had hated Tibur before I had seen him, it was
nothing to what I felt now.</p>

<p>I looked from him to the Witch-woman. Her cornflower-blue eyes
were drinking me in; absorbed, wondering&mdash;amused. She, too,
wore a coat of mail, over which streamed her red braids. Those who
were clustered behind Tibur and the Witch-woman were only a blur to
me.</p>

<p>Tibur leaned forward.</p>

<p>"Welcome&mdash;Dwayanu!" he jeered. "What has brought you out of
your skulking place? My challenge?"</p>

<p>"Was it you I heard baying yesterday?" I said. "Hai&mdash;you
picked a safe distance ere you began to howl, red dog!"</p>

<p>There was a laugh from the group around the Witch-woman, and I
saw that they were women, fair and red-haired like herself, and
that there were two tall men with Tibur. But the Witch-woman said
nothing, still drinking me in, a curious speculation in her
eyes.</p>

<p>Tibur's face grew dark. One of the men leaned, and whispered to
him. Tibur nodded, and swaggered forward. He called out to me:</p>

<p>"Have you grown soft during your wanderings, Dwayanu? By the
ancient custom, by the ancient test, we must learn that before we
acknowledge you &mdash;great Dwayanu. Stand fast&mdash;"</p>

<p>His hand dropped to the battle-hammer at his side. He hurled it
at me.</p>

<p>The hammer was hurtling through the air at me with the speed of
a bullet &mdash;yet it seemed to come slowly. I could even see the
thong that held it to Tibur's arm slowly lengthening as it
flew...</p>

<p>Little doors were opening in my brain...the ancient test...Hai!
but I knew that play...I waited motionless as the ancient custom
prescribed...but they should have given me a shield...no
matter...how slowly the great sledge seemed to come...and it seemed
to me that the hand I thrust out to catch it moved as slowly...</p>

<p>I caught it. Its weight was all of twenty pounds, yet I caught
it squarely, effortlessly, by its metal shaft. Hai! but did I not
know the trick of that?...The little doors were opening faster
now...and I knew another. With my other hand I gripped the thong
that held the battle-hammer to Tibur's arm and jerked him toward
me.</p>

<p>The laugh was frozen on Tibur's face. He tottered on Nansur's
broken edge. I heard behind me the piping shout of the
pygmies...</p>

<p>The Witch-woman sliced down a knife and severed the thong. She
jerked Tibur back from the verge. Rage swept me...that was not in
the play...by the ancient test it was challenger and challenged
alone...I swung the great hammer around my head and around, and
hurled it back at Tibur; it whistled as it flew and the severed
thong streamed rigid in its wake. He threw himself aside, but not
quickly enough. The sledge struck him on a shoulder. A glancing
bow, but it dropped him.</p>

<p>And now I laughed across the gulf.</p>

<p>The Witch-woman leaned forward, incredulity flooding the
speculation in her eyes. She was no longer amused. No! And Tibur
jerked himself up on one knee, glaring at me, his laughter lines
twisted into nothing like mirth of any kind.</p>

<p>Still other doors, tiny doors, opening in my brain...They
wouldn't believe I was Dwayanu...Hai! I would show them. I dipped
into the pocket of my belt. Ripped open the buckskin pouch. Drew
out the ring of Khalk'ru. I held it up. The green light glinted on
it. The yellow stone seemed to expand. The black octopus to
grow...</p>

<p>"Am I Dwayanu? Look on this! Am I Dwayanu?"</p>

<p>I heard a woman scream&mdash;I knew that voice. And I heard a
man calling, shouting to me&mdash;and that voice I knew too. The
little doors clicked shut, the memories that had slipped through
them darted back before they closed...</p>

<p>Why, it was Evalie who was screaming! And Jim who was shouting
at me! What was the matter with them? Evalie was facing me, arms
outstretched. And there was stark unbelief and horror&mdash;and
loathing&mdash;in the brown eyes fastened on me. And rank upon
rank, the Little People were closing around the pair of
them&mdash;barring me from them. Their spears and arrows were
levelled at me. They were hissing like a horde of golden snakes,
their faces distorted with hatred, their eyes fastened on the ring
of Khalk'ru still held high above my head.</p>

<p>And now I saw that hatred reflected upon the face of
Evalie&mdash;and the loathing deepen in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Evalie!" I cried, and would have leaped toward her...Back went
the hands of the pygmies for the throwing cast; the arrows trembled
in their bows.</p>

<p>"Don't move, Leif! I'm coming!" Jim jumped forward. Instantly
the pygmies swarmed round and upon him. He swayed and went down
under them.</p>

<p>"Evalie!" I cried again.</p>

<p>I saw the loathing fade, and heart-break come into her face. She
called some command.</p>

<p>A score of pygmies shot by her, on each side, casting down their
bows and spears as they raced toward me. Stupidly, I watched them
come; among them I saw Sri.</p>

<p>They struck me like little living battering rams. I was thrust
backward. My foot struck air&mdash;</p>

<p>The pygmies clinging to my legs, harrying me like terriers, I
toppled over the edge of Nansur.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="book2" id="book2"></a>BOOK OF THE WITCH-WOMAN</h2>

<h2><a name="chap13" id="chap13"></a>13. &mdash; KARAK</h2>

<p class="first">I had sense enough to throw my hands up over my
head, and so I went down feet first. The pygmies hanging to my legs
helped that, too. When I struck the water I sank deep and deep. The
old idea is that when a man drowns his whole past life runs through
his mind in a few seconds, like a reversed cinema reel. I don't
know about that, but I do know that in my progress into Nanbu's
depths and up again I thought faster than ever before in my
life.</p>

<p>In the first place I realized that Evalie had ordered me thrown
off the bridge. That made me white-hot mad. Why hadn't she waited
and given me a chance to explain the ring! Then I thought of how
many chances I'd had to explain&mdash;and hadn't taken one of them.
Also that the pygmies had been in no mood for waiting, and that
Evalie had held back their spears and arrows and given me a run for
my life, even though it might be a brief one. Then I thought of my
utter folly in flashing the ring at that particular moment, and I
couldn't blame the Little People for thinking me an emissary of
Khalk'ru. And I saw again the heart-break in Evalie's eyes, and my
rage vanished in a touch of heart-break of my own.</p>

<p>After that, quite academically, the idea came to me that Tibur's
hammer- play explained old God Thor of the Norse and his hammer
Mjolnir, the Smasher, which always returned to his hand after he
had thrown it&mdash;to make it more miraculous the skalds had left
out that practical detail of the thong; here was still another link
between the Uighur or Ayjir and the Aesir&mdash; I'd talk to Jim
about it. And then I knew I couldn't get back to Jim to talk to him
about that or anything else because the pygmies would certainly be
waiting for me, and would quite as certainly drive me back among
the leeches, even if I managed to get as far as their side of
Nanbu. At that thought, if a man entirely immersed in water can
break into a cold sweat I did it. I would much rather pass out by
way of the Little People's spears and darts or even Tibur's smasher
than be drained dry by those sucking mouths.</p>

<p>Just then I broke through the surface of Nanbu, trod water for a
moment, clearing my eyes, and saw the red-slug back of a leech
gliding toward me not twenty feet away. I cast a despairing glance
around me. The current was swift and had borne me several hundred
yards below the bridge. Also it had carried me toward the Karak
side, which seemed about five hundred feet away. I turned to face
the leech. It came slowly, as though sure of me. I planned to dive
under it and try to make for the shore...if&mdash;only there were
no others...</p>

<p>I heard a chattering shout. Sri shot past me. He raised an arm
and pointed at Karak. Clearly he was telling me to get there as
quickly as I could. I had forgotten all about him, except for a
momentary flash of wrath that he had joined my assailants. Now I
saw what an injustice I had done him. He swam straight to the big
leech and slapped it alongside its mouth. The creature bent toward
him, actually it nuzzled him. I waited to see no more, but struck
out as fast as my boots would let me for the river bank.</p>

<p>That was no pleasant swim, no! The place was thick with the
gliding red backs. Without question it was only Sri that saved me
from them. He came scuttering back, and he circled round and round
me as I ploughed on; he drove the leeches away. I touched bottom,
and scrambled over rocks to the safety of the bank. The golden
pygmy sent one last call to me. What he said I could not hear. I
stood there, gasping for breath, and saw him shooting across the
white water like a yellow flying fish, a half-dozen of the red
slug-backs gliding in his wake.</p>

<p>I looked up at Nansur Bridge. The Little People's end of it and
the parapets were crowded with pygmies, watching me. The other side
was empty. I looked around me. I was in the shadow of the walls of
the black citadel. They arose, smooth, impregnable, for a hundred
feet. Between me and them was a wide plaza, similar to that over
which Tibur and the Witch-woman had ridden from the bronze gates.
It was bordered with squat, one-storied houses of stone; there were
many small flowering trees. Beyond the bordering houses were
others, larger, more pretentious, set farther apart. Not so far
away and covering part of the plaza was an everyday, open-air
market.</p>

<p>From the bordering houses and from the market, scores of people
were pouring down upon me. They came swiftly, but they came
silently, not calling to one another, not signalling nor
summoning&mdash;intent upon me. I felt for my automatic and swore,
remembering that I had not worn it for days. Something flashed on
my hand...</p>

<p>The ring of Khalk'ru! I must have slipped it on my thumb when
the pygmies had rushed me. Well, the ring had brought me here.
Surely its effect would not be less upon these people, than it had
been upon those who had faced me from the far side of the broken
bridge. At any rate, it was all I had. I turned it so that the
stone was hidden in my hand.</p>

<p>They were close now, and mostly women and girls and girl
children. They all wore much the same kind of garment, a smock that
came down to their knees and which left the right breast bare.
Without exception, they were. red-haired and blue-eyed, their skins
creamy-white and delicate rose, and they were tall and strong and
beautifully formed. They might have been Viking maids and mothers
come to welcome home some dragon-ship from its sea-faring. The
children were little blue-eyed angels. I took note of the men;
there were not many of them, a dozen perhaps. They, too, had the
red polls and blue eyes. The older wore short beards, the younger
were clean-shaven. They were not so tall by several inches as the
run of the women. None, men nor women, came within half a head of
my height. They bore no weapons.</p>

<p>They halted a few yards from me, looking at me in silence. Their
eyes ran over me and stopped at my yellow hair, and rested
there.</p>

<p>There was a bustle at the edge of the crowd. A dozen women
pushed through and walked toward me. They wore short kirtles; there
were short swords in their girdles and they carried javelins in
their hands; unlike the others, their breasts were covered. They
ringed me, javelins raised, so close that the tips almost touched
me.</p>

<p>The leader's bright blue eyes were bold, more soldier's than
woman's.</p>

<p>"The yellow-haired stranger! Luka has smiled on us this
day!"</p>

<p>The woman beside her leaned and whispered, but I caught the
words:</p>

<p>"Tibur would give us more for him than Lur."</p>

<p>The leader shook her head.</p>

<p>"Too dangerous. We'll enjoy Lur's reward longer."</p>

<p>She looked me over, quite frankly.</p>

<p>"It's a shame to waste him," she said.</p>

<p>"Lur won't," the other answered, cynically.</p>

<p>The leader gave me a prod of her javelin, and motioned toward
the citadel wall.</p>

<p>"Onward, Yellow Hair," she said. "It's a pity you can't
understand me. Or I'd tell you something for your own good&mdash;at
a price, of course."</p>

<p>She smiled at me, and prodded me again. I felt like grinning
back at her; she was so much like a hard-boiled sergeant I'd known
in the War. I spoke, instead, sternly:</p>

<p>"Summon Lur to me with fitting escort, O! woman whose tongue
rivals the drum stick."</p>

<p>She gaped at me, her javelin dropping from her hand. Quite
evidently, although an alarm had been sounded for me, the fact that
I could speak the Uighur had not been told.</p>

<p>"Summon Lur at once," I said. "Or, by Khalk'ru&mdash;"</p>

<p>I did not complete the sentence. I turned the ring and held up
my hand.</p>

<p>There was a gasp of terror from the crowd. They went down on
their knees, heads bent low. The soldier-woman's face whitened, and
she and the others dropped before me. And then there was a grating
of bars. An immense block opened in the wall of the citadel not far
away.</p>

<p>Out of the opening, as though my words had summoned them, rode
the Witch- woman with Tibur beside her, and at their heels the
little troop who had watched me from Nansur Bridge.</p>

<p>They halted, staring at the kneeling crowd. Then Tibur spurred
his horse; the Witch-woman thrust out a hand and stayed him, and
they spoke together. The soldier touched my foot.</p>

<p>"Let us rise. Lord," she said. I nodded, and she jumped up with
a word to her women. Again they ringed me. I read the fear in the
leader's eyes, and appeal. I smiled at her.</p>

<p>"Don't fear. I heard nothing," I whispered.</p>

<p>"Then you have a friend in Dara," she muttered. "By
Luka&mdash;they would boil us for what we said!"</p>

<p>"I heard nothing," I repeated.</p>

<p>"A gift for a gift," she breathed. "Watch Tibur's left hand
should you fight him."</p>

<p>The little troop was in motion; they came riding slowly toward
me. As they drew near I could see that Tibur's face was dark, and
that he was holding in his temper with an effort. He halted his
horse at the edge of the crowd. His rage fell upon them; for a
moment I thought he was going to ride them down.</p>

<p>"Up, you swine!" he roared. "Since when has Karak knelt to any
but its rulers?"</p>

<p>They arose, huddled together with frightened faces as the troop
rode through them. I looked up at the Witch-woman and the
Laugher.</p>

<p>Tibur glowered down on me, his hand fumbling at his hammer; the
two big men who had flanked him on the bridge edged close to me,
long swords in hand. The Witch-woman said nothing, studying me
intently yet with a certain cynical impersonality I found
disquieting; evidently she still had not made up her mind about me
and was waiting for some word or move of mine to guide her. I
didn't like the situation very much. If it came to a dog fight I
would have little chance with three mounted men, to say nothing of
the women. I had the feeling that the Witch-woman did not want me
killed out-of-hand, but then she might be a bit late in succoring
me&mdash;and beyond that I had no slightest wish to be beaten up,
trussed up, carried into Karak a prisoner.</p>

<p>Also I began to feel a hot and unreasoning resentment against
these people who dared bar my way, dared hold me back from whatever
way I chose to go, an awakening arrogance&mdash;a stirring of those
mysterious memories that had cursed me ever since I had carried the
ring of Khalk'ru...</p>

<p>Well, those memories had served me on Nansur Bridge when Tibur
cast the hammer at me...and what was it Jim had said?...to let
Dwayanu ride when I faced the Witch-woman...well, let him...it was
the only way...the bold way...the olden way...It was as though I
heard the words! I threw my mind wide open to the memories, or
to&mdash;Dwayanu.</p>

<p>There was a tiny tingling shock in my brain, and then something
like the surging up of a wave toward that consciousness which was
Leif Langdon. I managed to thrust it back before it had entirely
submerged that consciousness. It retreated, but sullenly&mdash;nor
did it retreat far. No matter, so long as it did not roll over
me...I pushed the soldiers aside and walked to Tibur. Something of
what had occurred must have stamped itself on my face, changed me.
Doubt crept into the Witch-woman's eyes. Tibur's hand fell from his
hammer, and he backed his horse away. I spoke, and my wrathful
voice fell strangely on my own ears.</p>

<p>"Where is my horse? Where are my arms? Where are my standard and
my spearsmen? Why are the drums and the trumpets silent? Is it thus
Dwayanu is greeted when he comes to a city of the Ayjir! By Zarda,
but this is not to be home!"</p>

<p>Now the Witch-woman spoke, mockery in the clear, deep bell-toned
voice, and I felt that whatever hold I had gained over her had in
some way slipped.</p>

<p>"Hold your hand, Tibur! I will speak to&mdash;Dwayanu. And
you&mdash; if you are Dwayanu&mdash;scarcely can hold us to blame.
It has been long and long since human eyes rested on you&mdash;and
never in this land. So how could we know you? And when first we saw
you, the little yellow dogs ran you away from us. And when next we
saw you, the little yellow dogs ran you to us. If we have not
received you as Dwayanu has a right to expect from a city of the
Ayjir, equally is it true that no city of the Ayjir has ever before
been so visited by Dwayanu."</p>

<p>Well, that was true enough, admirable reasoning, lucid and all
of that. The part of me that was Leif Langdon, and engaged in
rather desperate struggle to retain control, recognized it. Yet the
unreasoning anger grew. I held up the ring of Khalk'ru.</p>

<p>"You may not know Dwayanu&mdash;but you know this."</p>

<p>"I know you have it," she said, levelly. "But I do not know how
you came by it. In itself it proves nothing."</p>

<p>Tibur leaned forward, grinning.</p>

<p>"Tell us where you did come from. Are you by-blow of Sirk?"</p>

<p>There was a murmur from the crowd. The Witch-woman leaned
forward, frowning. I heard her murmur, half-contemptuously:</p>

<p>"Your strength was never in your head, Tibur!"</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I answered him.</p>

<p>"I come," I said bleakly, "from the Mother-land of the Ayjir.
From the land that vomited your shivering forefathers, red
toad!"</p>

<p>I shot a glance at the Witch-woman. That had jolted her all
right. I saw her body stiffen, her cornflower eyes distend and
darken, her red lips part; and her women bent to each other,
whispering, while the murmur of the crowd swelled.</p>

<p>"You lie!" roared Tibur. "There is no life in the Mother-land.
There is no life elsewhere than here. Khalk'ru has sucked earth dry
of Life. Except here. You lie!"</p>

<p>His hand dropped to his hammer.</p>

<p>And suddenly I saw red; all the world dissolved in a red mist of
red. The horse of the man closest to me was a noble animal. I had
been watching it &mdash;a roan stallion, strong as the black
stallion that had carried me from the Gobi oasis. I reached up,
caught at its jaw, and pulled it down to its knees. Taken unaware,
its rider toppled forward, somersaulted over its head and fell at
my feet. He was up again like a cat, sword a-thrust at me. I caught
his arm before he could strike and swung up my left fist. It
cracked on his jaw; his head snapped back, and he dropped. I
snatched up the sword, and swung myself on the rising horse's back.
Before Tibur could move I had the point of the sword at his
throat.</p>

<p>"Stop! I grant you Dwayanu! Hold your hand!" It was the
Witch-woman's voice, low, almost whispering.</p>

<p>I laughed. I pressed the point of the sword deeper into Tiber's
throat.</p>

<p>"Am I Dwayanu? Or by-blow of Sirk?"</p>

<p>"You are&mdash;Dwayanu!" he groaned.</p>

<p>I laughed again.</p>

<p>"I am Dwayanu! Then guide me into Karak to make amends for your
insolence, Tibur!"</p>

<p>I drew the sword away from his throat.</p>

<p>Yes, I drew it back&mdash;and by all the mad mixed gods of that
mad mixed mind of mine at that moment I would that I had thrust it
through his throat!</p>

<p>But I did not, and so that chance passed. I spoke to the
Witch-woman:</p>

<p>"Ride at my right hand. Let Tibur ride before."</p>

<p>The man I had struck down was on his feet, swaying unsteadily.
Lur spoke to one of her women. She slipped from her horse, and with
Tibur's other follower helped him upon it.</p>

<p>We rode across the plaza, and through the walls of the black
citadel.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap14" id="chap14"></a>14. &mdash; IN THE BLACK
CITADEL</h2>

<p class="first">The bars that held the gate crashed down behind
us. The passage through the walls was wide and long and lined with
soldiers, most of them women. They stared at me; their discipline
was good, for they were silent, saluting us with upraised
swords.</p>

<p>We came out of the walls into an immense square, bounded by the
towering black stone of the citadel. It was stone-paved and bare,
and there must have been half a thousand soldiers in it, again
mostly women and one and all of the strong-bodied, blue-eyed,
red-haired type. It was a full quarter-mile to the side&mdash;the
square. Opposite where we entered, there was a group of people on
horses, of the same class as those who rode with us, or so I
judged. They were clustered about a portal in the farther walls,
and toward these we trotted.</p>

<p>About a third of the way over, we passed a circular pit a
hundred feet wide in which water boiled and bubbled and from which
steam arose. A hot spring, I supposed; I could feel its breath.
Around it were slender stone pillars from each of which an arm
jutted like that of a gallows, and from the ends of them dangled
thin chains. It was, indefinably, an unpleasant and ominous place.
I didn't like the look of it at all. Something of this must have
shown on my face, for Tibur spoke, blandly.</p>

<p>"Our cooking pot."</p>

<p>"No easy one from which to ladle broth," I said. I thought him
jesting.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;but the meat we cook there is not the kind we eat," he
answered, still more blandly. And his laughter roared out.</p>

<p>I felt a little sick as his meaning reached me. It was tortured
human flesh which those chains were designed to hold, lowering it
slowly inch by inch into that devil's cauldron. But I only nodded
indifferently, and rode on.</p>

<p>The Witch-woman had paid no attention to us; her russet head
bent, she went on deep in thought, though now and then I caught her
oblique glance at me. We drew near the portal. She signalled those
who awaited there, a score of the red-haired maids and women and a
half-dozen men; they dismounted. The Witch-woman leaned to me and
whispered:</p>

<p>"Turn the ring so its seal will be covered."</p>

<p>I obeyed her, asking no question.</p>

<p>We arrived at the portal. I looked at the group there. The women
wore the breast-revealing upper garment; their legs were covered
with loose baggy trousers tied in at the ankles; they had wide
girdles in which were two swords, one long and one short. The men
were clothed in loose blouses, and the same baggy trousers; in
their girdles beside the swords&mdash;or rather, hanging from their
girdles&mdash;were hammers like that of the Smith, but smaller. The
women who had gathered around me after I had climbed out of Nanbu
had been fair enough, but these were far more attractive, finer,
with a stamp of breeding the others had not had. They stared at me
as frankly, as appraisingly, as had the soldier woman and her
lieutenant; their eyes rested upon my yellow hair and stopped
there, as though fascinated. On all their faces was that suggestion
of cruelty latent in the amorous mouth of Lur.</p>

<p>"We dismount here," said the Witch-woman, "to go where we may
become &mdash;better acquainted."</p>

<p>I nodded as before, indifferently. I had been thinking that it
was a foolhardy thing I had done, thus to thrust myself alone among
these people; but I had been thinking, too, that I could have done
nothing else except have gone to Sirk, and where that was I did not
know; and that if I had tried I would have been a hunted outlaw on
this side of white Nanbu, as I would be on the other. The part of
me that was Leif Langdon was thinking that&mdash;but the part of me
that was Dwayanu was not thinking like that at all. It was fanning
the fire of recklessness, the arrogance, that had carried me thus
far in safety; whispering that none among the Ayjir had the right
to question me or to bar my way, whispering with increasing
insistence that I should have been met by dipping standards and
roll of drums and fanfare of trumpets. The part that was Leif
Langdon answered that there was nothing else to do but continue as
I had been doing, that it was the game to play, the line to take,
the only way. And that other part, ancient memories, awakening of
Dwayanu, post-hypnotic suggestion of the old Gobi priest,
impatiently asked why I should question even myself, urging that it
was no game&mdash;but truth! And that it would brook little more
insolence from these degenerate dogs of the Great Race&mdash;and
little more cowardice from me!</p>

<p>So I flung myself from my horse, and stood looking arrogantly
down upon the faces turned to me, literally looking down, for I was
four inches or more taller than the tallest of them. Lur touched my
arm. Between her and Tibur I strode through the portal and into the
black citadel.</p>

<p>It was a vast vestibule through which we passed, and dimly
lighted by slits far up in the polished rock. We went by groups of
silently saluting soldier-women; we went by many transverse
passages. We came at last to a great guarded door, and here Lur and
Tibur dismissed their escorts. The door rolled slowly open; we
entered and it rolled shut behind us.</p>

<p>The first thing I saw was the Kraken.</p>

<p>It sprawled over one wall of the chamber into which we had come.
My heart leaped as I saw it, and for an instant I had an almost
ungovernable impulse to turn and run. And now I saw that the figure
of the Kraken was a mosaic set in the black stone. Or rather, that
the yellow field in which it lay was a mosaic and that the Black
Octopus had been cut from the stone of the wall itself. Its
unfathomable eyes of jet regarded me with that suggestion of
lurking malignity the yellow pygmies had managed to imitate so
perfectly in their fettered symbol inside the hollow rock.</p>

<p>Something stirred beneath the Kraken. A face looked out on me
from under a hood of black. At first I thought it the old priest of
the Gobi himself, and then I saw that this man was not so old, and
that his eyes were clear deep blue and that his face was
unwrinkled, and cold and white and expressionless as though carved
from marble. Then I remembered what Evalie had told me, and knew
this must be Yodin the High Priest. He sat upon a throne-like chair
behind a long low table on which were rolls like the papyrus rolls
of the Egyptians, and cylinders of red metal which were, I
supposed, their containers. On each side of him was another of the
thrones.</p>

<p>He lifted a thin white hand and beckoned me.</p>

<p>"Come to me&mdash;you who call yourself Dwayanu."</p>

<p>The voice was cold and passionless as the face, but courteous. I
seemed to hear again the old priest when he had called me to him. I
walked over, more as one who humors another a little less than
equal than as though obeying a summons. And that was precisely the
way I felt. He must have read my thought, for I saw a shadow of
anger pass over his face. His eyes searched me.</p>

<p>"You have a certain ring, I am told."</p>

<p>With the same feeling of humoring one slightly inferior, I
turned the bevel of the Kraken ring and held my hand out toward
him. He looked at the ring, and the white face lost its immobility.
He thrust a hand into his girdle, and drew from it a box, and out
of it another ring, and placed it beside mine. I saw that it was
not so large, and that the setting was not precisely the same. He
studied the two rings, and then with a hissing intake of breath he
snatched my hands and turned them over, scanning the palms. He
dropped them and leaned back in his chair.</p>

<p>"Why do you come to us?" he asked.</p>

<p>A surge of irritation swept me.</p>

<p>"Does Dwayanu stand like a common messenger to be questioned?" I
said harshly.</p>

<p>I walked around the table and dropped into one of the chairs
beside him.</p>

<p>"Let drink be brought, for I am thirsty. Until my thirst is
quenched, I will not talk."</p>

<p>A faint flush stained the white face; there was a growl from
Tibur. He was glaring at me with reddened face; the Witch-woman
stood, gaze intent upon me, no mockery in it now; the speculative
interest was intensified. It came to me that the throne I had
usurped was Tibur's. I laughed.</p>

<p>"Beware, Tibur," I said. "This may be an omen!"</p>

<p>The High Priest intervened, smoothly.</p>

<p>"If he be indeed Dwayanu, Tibur, then no honor is too great for
him. See that wine is brought."</p>

<p>The look that the Smith shot at Yodin seemed to me to hold a
question. Perhaps the Witch-woman thought so too. She spoke
quickly.</p>

<p>"I will see to it."</p>

<p>She walked to the door, opened it and gave an order to a guard.
She waited; there was silence among us while she waited. I thought
many things. I thought, for example, that I did not like the look
that had passed between Yodin and Tibur, and that while I might
trust Lur for the present&mdash; still she would drink first when
the wine came. And I thought that I would tell them little of how I
came to the Shadowed-land. And I thought of Jim &mdash;and I
thought of Evalie. It made my heart ache so that I felt the
loneliness of nightmare; and then I felt the fierce contempt of
that other part of me, and felt it strain against the fetters I had
put on it. Then the wine came.</p>

<p>The Witch-woman carried ewer and goblet over to the table and
set them before me. She poured yellow wine into the goblet and
handed it to me. I smiled at her.</p>

<p>"The cup-bearer drinks first," I said. "So it was in the olden
days, Lur. And the olden customs are dear to me."</p>

<p>Tibur gnawed his lip and tugged at his beard at that, but Lur
took up the goblet and drained it. I refilled it, and raised it to
Tibur. I had a malicious desire to bait the Smith.</p>

<p>"Would you have done that had you been the cup-bearer, Tibur?" I
asked him and drank.</p>

<p>That was good wine! It tingled through me, and I felt the heady
recklessness leap up under it as though lashed. I filled the goblet
again and tossed it off.</p>

<p>"Come up, Lur, and sit with us," I said. "Tibur, join us."</p>

<p>The Witch-woman quietly took the third throne. Tibur was
watching me, and I saw a new look in his eyes, something of that
furtive speculation I had surprised in Lur's. The white-faced
priest's gaze was far away. It occurred to me that the three of
them were extremely busy with their own thoughts, and that Tibur at
least, was becoming a bit uneasy. When he answered me his voice had
lost all truculency.</p>

<p>"Well and good&mdash;Dwayanu!" he said, and, lifting a bench,
carried it to the table, and set it where he could watch our
faces.</p>

<p>"I answer your question," I turned to Yodin. "I came here at the
summons of Khalk'ru."</p>

<p>"It is strange," he said, "that I, who am High Priest of
Khalk'ru, knew nothing of any summons."</p>

<p>"The reasons for that I do not know," I said, casually. "Ask
them of him you serve."</p>

<p>He pondered over that.</p>

<p>"Dwayanu lived long and long and long ago," he said.
"Before&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Before the Sacrilege. True." I took another drink of the wine.
"Yet &mdash;I am here."</p>

<p>For the first time his voice lost its steadiness.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you know of the Sacrilege!" His fingers clutched my
wrist. "Man&mdash;whoever you are&mdash;from whence do you
come?"</p>

<p>"I come," I answered, "from the Mother-land."</p>

<p>His fingers tightened around my wrist. He echoed Tibur.</p>

<p>"The Mother-land is a dead land. Khalk'ru in his anger destroyed
its life. There is no life save here, where Khalk'ru hears his
servants and lets life be."</p>

<p>He did not believe that; I could tell it by the involuntary
glance he had given the Witch-woman and the Smith. Nor did
they.</p>

<p>"The Mother-land," I said, "is bleached bones. Its cities lie
covered in shrouds of sand. Its rivers are waterless, and all that
runs within their banks is sand driven by the arid winds. Yet still
is there life in the Motherland, and although the ancient blood is
thinned&mdash;still it runs. And still is Khalk'ru worshipped and
feared in the place from whence I came &mdash;and still in other
lands the earth spawns life as always she has done."</p>

<p>I poured some more wine. It was good wine, that.</p>

<p>Under it I felt my recklessness increase...under it Dwayanu was
stronger...well, this was a tight box I was in, so let him
be...</p>

<p>"Show me the place from whence you came," the High Priest spoke
swiftly. He gave me a tablet of wax and a stylus. I traced the
outline of Northern Asia upon it and of Alaska. I indicated the
Gobi and approximately the location of the oasis, and also the
position of the Shadowed-land.</p>

<p>Tibur got up to look at it; their three heads bent over it. The
priest fumbled among the rolls, picked one, and they compared it
with the tablet. It appeared like a map, but if so the northern
coast line was all wrong. There was a line traced on it that seemed
to be a route of some sort. It was overscored and underscored with
symbols. I wondered whether it might not be the record of the trek
those of the Old Race had made when they had fled from the
Gobi.</p>

<p>They looked up at last; there was perturbation in the priest's
eyes, angry apprehension in Tibur's, but the eyes of the
Witch-woman were clear and untroubled&mdash;as though she had made
up her mind about something and knew precisely what she was going
to do.</p>

<p>"It is the Mother-land!" the priest said. "Tell me&mdash;did the
black- haired stranger who fled with you across the river and who
watched you hurled from Nansur come also from there?"</p>

<p>There was sheer malice in that question. I began to dislike
Yodin.</p>

<p>"No," I answered. "He comes from an old land of the
Rrrllya."</p>

<p>That brought the priest up standing; Tibur swore incredulously;
and even the Witch-woman was shaken from her serenity.</p>

<p>"Another land&mdash;of the Rrrllya! But that cannot be!"
whispered Yodin.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless it is so," I said.</p>

<p>He sank back, and thought for a while.</p>

<p>"He is your friend?"</p>

<p>"My brother by the ancient blood rite of his people."</p>

<p>"He would join you here?"</p>

<p>"He would if I sent for him. But that I will not do. Not yet. He
is well off where he is."</p>

<p>I was sorry I had said that the moment I had spoken. Why&mdash;I
did not know. But I would have given much to have recalled the
words.</p>

<p>Again the priest was silent.</p>

<p>"These are strange things you tell us," he said at last. "And
you have come to us strangely for&mdash;Dwayanu. You will not mind
if for a little we take counsel?"</p>

<p>I looked in the ewer. It was still half-full. I liked that
wine&mdash; most of all because it dulled my sorrow over
Evalie.</p>

<p>"Speak as long as you please," I answered, graciously. They went
off to a comer of the room. I poured myself another drink, and
another. I forgot about Evalie. I began to feel I was having a good
time. I wished Jim was with me, but I wished I hadn't said he would
come if I sent for him. And then I took another drink and forgot
about Jim. Yes, I was having a damned good time... well, wait till
I let Dwayanu loose a bit more! I'd have a better one...I was
sleepy...I wondered what old Barr would say if he could be here
with me...</p>

<p>I came to myself with a start. The High Priest was standing at
my side, talking. I had a vague idea he had been talking to me for
some time but I couldn't remember what about. I also had the idea
that someone had been fumbling with my thumb. It was clenched
stubbornly in my palm, so tightly that the stone had bruised the
flesh. The effect of the wine had entirely worn off I looked around
the room. Tibur and the Witch-woman were gone. Why hadn't I seen
them go? Had I been asleep? I studied Yodin's face. There was a
look of strain about it, of bafflement; and yet I sensed some deep
satisfaction. It was a queer composite of expression. And I didn't
like it.</p>

<p>"The others have gone to prepare a fitting reception for you,"
he said. "To make ready a place for you and fitting apparel."</p>

<p>I arose and stood beside him.</p>

<p>"As Dwayanu?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Not as yet," he answered urbanely. "But as an honored guest.
The other is too serious a matter to decide without further
proof."</p>

<p>"And that proof?"</p>

<p>He looked at me a long moment before answering.</p>

<p>"That Khalk'ru will appear at your prayer!"</p>

<p>A little shudder went through me at that. He was watching me so
closely that he must have seen it.</p>

<p>"Curb your impatience," his voice was cold honey. "You will not
have long to wait. Until then I probably shall not see you. In the
meantime&mdash;I have a request to make."</p>

<p>"What is it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"That you will not wear the ring of Khalk'ru
openly&mdash;except, of course, at such times as may seem necessary
to you."</p>

<p>It was the same thing Lur had asked me. Yet scores had seen me
with the ring&mdash;more must know I had it. He read my
indecision.</p>

<p>"It is a holy thing," he said. "I did not know another existed
until word was brought me that you had shown it on Nansur. It is
not well to cheapen holy things. I do not wear mine except when I
think it&mdash; necessary."</p>

<p>I wondered under what circumstances he considered
it&mdash;necessary. And I wished fervently I knew under what
circumstances it would be helpful to me. His eyes were searching
me, and I hoped he had not read that thought.</p>

<p>"I see no reason to deny that request," I said. I slipped the
ring off my thumb and into my belt pocket.</p>

<p>"I was sure you would not," he murmured.</p>

<p>A gong sounded lightly. He pressed the side of the table, and
the door opened. Three youths clothed in the smocks of the people
entered and stood humbly waiting.</p>

<p>"They are your servants. They will take you to your place,"
Yodin said. He bent his head. I went out with the three young
Ayjirs. At the door was a guard of a dozen women with a bold-eyed
young captain. They saluted me smartly. We marched down the
corridor and at length turned into another. I looked back.</p>

<p>I was just in time to see the Witch-woman slipping into the High
Priest's chamber.</p>

<p>We came to another guarded door. It was thrown open and into it
I was ushered, followed by the three youths.</p>

<p>"We are also your servants. Lord," the bold-eyed captain spoke.
"If there is anything you wish, summon me by this. We shall be at
the door."</p>

<p>She handed me a small gong of jade, saluted again and marched
out.</p>

<p>The room had an odd aspect of familiarity. Then I realized it
was much like that to which I had been taken in the oasis. There
were the same oddly shaped stools, and chairs of metal, the same
wide, low divan bed, the tapestried walls, the rugs upon the floor.
Only here there were no signs of decay. True, some of the
tapestries were time-faded, but exquisitely so; there were no rags
or tatters in them. The others were beautifully woven but fresh as
though just from the loom. The ancient hangings were threaded with
the same scenes of the hunt and war as the haggard drapings of the
oasis; the newer ones bore scenes of the land under the mirage.
Nansur Bridge sprang unbroken over one, on another was a battle
with the pygmies, on another a scene of the fantastically lovely
forest&mdash;with the white wolves of Lur slinking through the
trees. Something struck me as wrong. I looked and looked before I
knew what it was. The arms of its olden master had been in the
chamber of the oasis, his swords and spears, helmet and shield; in
this one there was not a weapon. I remembered that I had carried
the sword of Tibur's man into the chamber of the High Priest. I did
not have it now.</p>

<p>A disquietude began to creep over me. I turned to the three
young Ayjirs, and began to unbutton my shirt. They came forward
silently, and started to strip me. And suddenly I felt a consuming
thirst.</p>

<p>"Bring me water," I said to one of the youths. He paid not the
slightest attention to me.</p>

<p>"Bring me water," I said again, thinking he had not heard. "I am
thirsty."</p>

<p>He continued tranquilly taking off a boot. I touched him on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Bring me water to drink," I said, emphatically.</p>

<p>He smiled up at me, opened his mouth and pointed. He had no
tongue. He pointed to his ears. I understood that he was telling me
he was both dumb and deaf. I pointed to his two comrades. He
nodded.</p>

<p>My disquietude went up a point or two. Was this a general custom
of the rulers of Karak; had this trio been especially adapted not
only for silent service but unhearing service on special guests?
Guests or&mdash; prisoners?</p>

<p>I tapped the gong with a finger. At once the door opened, and
the young captain stood there, saluting.</p>

<p>"I am thirsty," I said. "Bring water."</p>

<p>For answer she crossed the room and pulled aside one of the
hangings. Behind it was a wide, deep alcove.</p>

<p>Within the floor was a shallow pool through which clear water
was flowing, and close beside it was a basin of porphyry from which
sprang a jet like a tiny fountain, She took a goblet from a niche,
filled it under the jet and handed it to me. It was cold and
sparkling.</p>

<p>"Is there anything more. Lord?" she asked. I shook my head, and
she marched out.</p>

<p>I went back to the ministrations of the three deaf-mutes. They
took off the rest of my clothes and began to massage me, with some
light, volatile oil. While they were doing it, my mind began to
function rather actively. In the first place, the sore spot in my
palm kept reminding me of that impression someone had been trying
to get the ring off my thumb. In the second place, the harder I
thought the more I was sure that before I awakened or had come out
of my abstraction or drink or whatever it was, the white-faced
priest had been talking, talking, talking to me, questioning me,
probing into my dulled mind. And in the third place, I had lost
almost entirely all the fine carelessness of consequences that had
been so successful in putting me where I was&mdash;in fact, I was
far too much Leif Langdon and too little Dwayanu. What had the
priest been at with his talking, talking, questioning&mdash;and
what had I said?</p>

<p>I jumped out of the hands of my masseurs, ran over to my
trousers and dived into my belt. The ring was there right enough. I
searched for my old pouch. It was gone. I rang the gong. The
captain answered. I was mother-naked, but I hadn't the slightest
sense of her being a woman.</p>

<p>"Hear me," I said. "Bring me wine. And bring with it a safe,
strong case big enough to hold a ring. Bring with that a strong
chain with which I can hang the case around my neck. Do you
understand?"</p>

<p>"Done at once. Lord," she said. She was not long in returning.
She set down the ewer she was carrying and reached into her blouse.
She brought out a locket suspended from a metal chain. She snapped
it open.</p>

<p>"Will this do. Lord?"</p>

<p>I turned from her, and put the ring of Khalk'ru into the locket.
It held it admirably.</p>

<p>"Most excellently," I told her, "but I have nothing to give you
in return."</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>"Reward enough to have beheld you. Lord," she said, not at all
ambiguously, and marched away. I hung the locket round my neck. I
poured a drink and then another. I went back to my masseurs and
began to feel better. I drank while they were bathing me, and I
drank while they were trimming my hair and shaving me. And the more
I drank the more Dwayanu came up, coldly wrathful and
resentful.</p>

<p>My dislike for Yodin grew. It did not lessen while the trio were
dressing me. They put on me a silken under-vest. They covered it
with a gorgeous tunic of yellow shot through with metallic threads
of blue; they covered my long legs with the baggy trousers of the
same stuff; they buckled around my waist a broad, gem-studded
girdle, and they strapped upon my feet sandals of soft golden
leather. They had shaved me, and now they brushed and dressed my
hair which they had shorn to the nape of my neck.</p>

<p>By the time they were through with me, the wine was done. I was
a little drunk, willing to be more so, and in no mood to be played
with. I rang the gong for the captain. I wanted some more wine, and
I wanted to know when, where and how I was going to eat. The door
opened, but it was not the captain who came in.</p>

<p>It was the Witch-woman.</p>

<br>

<h2><a name="chap15" id="chap15"></a>15. &mdash; THE LAKE OF THE
GHOSTS</h2>

<p class="first">Lur paused, red lips parted, regarding me. Plainly
she was startled by the difference the Ayjir trappings and the
ministrations of the mutes had made in the dripping, bedraggled
figure that had scrambled out of the river not long before. Her
eyes glowed, and a deeper rose stained her cheeks. She came
close.</p>

<p>"Dwayanu&mdash;you will go with me?"</p>

<p>I looked at her, and laughed.</p>

<p>"Why not, Lur&mdash;but also, why?"</p>

<p>She whispered:</p>

<p>"You are in danger&mdash;whether you are Dwayanu or whether you
are not. I have persuaded Yodin to let you remain with me until you
go to the temple. With me you shall be safe&mdash;until then."</p>

<p>"And why did you do this for me, Lur?"</p>

<p>She made no answer&mdash;only set one hand upon my shoulder and
looked at me with blue eyes grown soft; and though common sense
told me there were other reasons for her solicitude than any quick
passion for me, still at that touch and look the blood raced
through my veins, and it was hard to master my voice and speak.</p>

<p>"I will go with you, Lur."</p>

<p>She went to the door, opened it.</p>

<p>"Ouarda, the cloak and cap." She came back to me with a black
cloak which she threw over my shoulders and fastened round my neck;
she pulled down over my yellow hair a close-fitting cap shaped like
the Phyrgian and she tucked my hair into it. Except for my height
it made me like any other Ayjir in Karak.</p>

<p>"There is need for haste, Dwayanu."</p>

<p>"I am ready. Wait&mdash;"</p>

<p>I went over to where my old clothes lay, and rolled them up
around my boots. After all&mdash;I might need them. The Witch-woman
made no comment, opened the door and we went out. The captain and
her guard were in the corridor, also a half-dozen of Lur's women,
and handsome creatures they were. Then I noticed that each of them
wore the light coat of mail and, besides the two swords, carried
throwing hammers. So did Lur. Evidently they were ready for
trouble, whether with me or with someone else; and whichever way it
was, I didn't like it.</p>

<p>"Give me your sword," I said abruptly to the captain. She
hesitated.</p>

<p>"Give it to him," said Lur.</p>

<p>I weighed the weapon in my hand; not so heavy as I would have
liked, but still a sword. I thrust it into my girdle, and bunched
the bundle of my old clothes beneath my left arm, under the cloak.
We set off down the corridor, leaving the guard at the door.</p>

<p>We went only a hundred yards, and then into a small bare
chamber. We had met no one. Lur drew a breath of relief, walked
over to a side, and a slab of stone slid open, revealing a passage.
We went into that and the slab closed, leaving us in
pitch-darkness. There was a spark, produced I don't know how, and
the place sprang into light from torches in the hands of two of the
women. They burned with a clear, steady and silvery flame. The
torch-bearers marched ahead of us. After a while we came to the end
of that passage, the torches were extinguished, another stone slid
away and we stepped out. I heard whispering, and after the glare of
the flambeaux had worn away, I saw that we were at the base of one
of the walls of the black citadel, and that close by were half a
dozen more of Lur's women, with horses. One of them led forward a
big gray stallion.</p>

<p>"Mount, and ride beside me," said Lur.</p>

<p>I fixed my bundle on the pommel of the high saddle, and
straddled the gray. We set off silently. It was never wholly dark
at night in the land under the mirage; there was always a faint
green luminescence, but to-night it was brighter than I had ever
seen it. I wondered whether there was a full moon shining down over
the peaks of the valley. I wondered if we had far to go. I was not
as drunk as I had been when Lur had come in on me, but in a way I
was drunker. I had a queer, light-headed feeling that was decidedly
pleasant, a carefree irresponsibility. I wanted to keep on feeling
that way. I hoped that Lur had plenty of wine wherever she was
taking me. I wished I had a drink right now.</p>

<p>We were going through the city beyond the citadel, and we went
fast. The broad street we were on was well paved. There were lights
in the houses and in the gardens and people singing and drums and
pipes playing. Sinister the black citadel might be, but it did not
seem to cast any shadow on the people of Karak. Or so I thought
then.</p>

<p>We passed out of the city into a smooth road running between
thick vegetation. The luminous moths like fairy planes were
flitting about, and for a moment I felt a pang of memory, and
Evalie's face floated up before me. It didn't last a second. The
gray went sweetly and I began to sing an old Kirghiz song about a
lover who rode in the moonlight to his maid and what he found when
he got there. Lur laughed, and put her hand over my mouth.</p>

<p>"Quiet, Dwayanu! There still is danger." Then I realized that I
hadn't been singing the Kirghiz at all, but the Uighur, which was
probably where the Kirghiz got it from. And then it occurred to me
that I had never heard the song in the Uighur. It started the old
problem going in my mind&mdash;and that lasted no longer than the
memory of Evalie.</p>

<p>Now and then I caught a glimpse of the white river. And then we
went over a long stretch where the road narrowed so that we rode
single file between verdure-covered cliffs. When we came out of
them, the road forked. One part of it ran right on, the other
turned sharply to the left. We rode along this for three or four
miles, apparently directly through the heart of the strange forest.
The great trees spread their arms out far overhead; the candelabras
and cressets and swaying ropes of blooms gleamed like ghosts of
flowers in the pallid light; the scaled trees were like men-at-arms
on watch. And the heady fragrances, the oddly stimulating
exhalations were strong&mdash; strong. They throbbed from the
forest, rhythmically, as though they were the pulse of its
life-drunken heart.</p>

<p>And as we came to the end of that road and I looked down upon
the Lake of the Ghosts.</p>

<p>Never, I think, in all the world was there such a place of
breath-taking, soul-piercing, unearthly beauty as that lake beneath
the mirage in which Lur the Witch-woman had her home. And had she
not been Witch-woman before she dwelt there, it must have made her
so.</p>

<p>It was shaped like an arrow-head, its longer shores not more
than a mile in, length. It was enclosed by low hills whose sides
were covered with the tree-ferns; their feathery fronds clothed
them as though they were the breasts of gigantic birds of Paradise;
threw themselves up from them like fountains; soared over them like
vast virescent wings. The color of its water was pale emerald, and
like an emerald it gleamed, placid, untroubled. But beneath that
untroubled surface there was movement&mdash;luminous circles of
silvery green that spread swiftly and vanished, rays that laced and
interlaced in fantastic yet ordered, geometric forms; luminous
spiralings, none of which ever came quite to the surface to disturb
its serenity. And here and there were clusters of soft lights, like
vaporous rubies, misted sapphires and opals and glimmering
pearls&mdash;witch-lights. The luminous lilies of the Lake of the
Ghosts.</p>

<p>Where the point of the arrow-head touched, there were no ferns.
A broad waterfall spread itself like a veil over the face of the
cliff, whispering as it fell. Mists rose there, mingling with the
falling water, dancing slowly with the falling water, swaying
toward it and reaching up with ghostly hands as though to greet it.
And from the shores of the lake, other wraiths of mist would rise,
and glide swiftly over the emerald floor and join those other
dancing, welcoming wraiths of the waterfall. Thus first I saw the
Lake of the Ghosts under the night of the mirage, and it was no
less beautiful in the mirage day.</p>

<p>The road ran out into the lake like the shaft of an arrow. At
its end was what once, I supposed, had been a small island. It lay
two-thirds of the way across. Over its trees were the turrets of a
small castle.</p>

<p>We walked our horses down the steep to the narrowing of the road
where it became the shaft of the arrow. Here there were no ferns to
hide the approach; they had been cleared away and the breast of the
hill was covered with the blue flowerets. As we reached the narrow
part, I saw that it was a causeway, built of stone. The place to
which we were going was still an island. We came to the end of the
causeway, and there was a forty-foot gap between it and a pier on
the opposite shore. Lur drew from her girdle a small horn and
sounded it. A drawbridge began to creak, and to drop down over the
gap. We rode across that and into a garrison of her women. We
cantered up a winding road, and I heard the creak of the lifting
bridge as we went. We drew up before the house of the
Witch-woman.</p>

<p>I looked at it with interest, not because it was unfamiliar, for
it was not, but I was thinking I had never seen a castle of its
sort built of that peculiar green stone nor with so many turrets.
Yes, I knew them well. "Lady castles," we had called them;
lana'rada, bowers for favorite women, a place to rest, a place to
love after war or when weary of statecraft.</p>

<p>Women came and took the horses. Wide doors of polished wood
swung open. Lur led me over the threshold.</p>

<p>Girls came forward with wine. I drank thirstily. The queer
light- headedness, and the sense of detachment were growing. I
seemed to have awakened from a long, long sleep, and was not
thoroughly awake and troubled by memories of dreams. But I was sure
that they had not all been dreams. That old priest who had awakened
me in the desert which once had been fertile Ayjirland&mdash;he had
been no dream. Yet the people among whom I had awakened bad not
been Ayjirs. This was not Ayjirland, yet the people were of the
ancient breed! How had I gotten here? I must have fallen asleep
again in the temple after&mdash;after&mdash;by Zarda, but I must
feel my way a bit! Be cautious. Then would follow a surge of
recklessness that swept away all thought of caution, a roaring
relish of life, a wild freedom as of one who, long in prison, sees
suddenly the bars broken and before him the table of life spread
with all he has been denied, to take as he wills. And on its heels
a flash of recognition that I was Leif Langdon and knew perfectly
well how I came to be in this place and must some way, somehow, get
back to Evalie and to Jim. Swift as the lightning were those latter
flashes, and as brief.</p>

<p>I became aware that I was no longer in the castle's hall but in
a smaller chamber, octagonal, casemented, tapestried. There was a
wide, low bed. There was a table glistening with gold and crystal;
tall candles burned upon it. My blouse was gone, and in its place a
light silken tunic. The casements were open and the fragrant air
sighed through them. I leaned from one.</p>

<p>Below me were the lesser turrets and the roof of the castle. Far
below was the lake. I looked through another. The waterfall with
its beckoning wraiths whispered and murmured not a thousand feet
away.</p>

<p>I felt the touch of a hand on my head; it slipped down to my
shoulder; I swung round. The Witch-woman was beside me.</p>

<p>For the first time I seemed to be realizing her beauty, seemed
for the first time to be seeing her clearly. Her russet hair was
braided in a thick coronal; it shone like reddest gold, and within
it was twisted a strand of sapphires. Her eyes outshone them. Her
scanty robe of gossamer blue revealed every lovely, sensuous line
of her. White shoulders and one of the exquisite breasts were bare.
Her full red lips promised&mdash;anything, and even the subtle
cruelty stamped upon them lured.</p>

<p>There had been a dark girl...who had she been...Ev&mdash;
Eval&mdash; the name eluded me...no matter...she was like a wraith
beside this woman... like one of the mist wraiths swaying at the
feet of the waterfall...</p>

<p>The Witch-woman read what was in my eyes. Her hand slipped from
my shoulder and rested on my heart. She bent closer, blue eyes
languorous &mdash;yet strangely intent.</p>

<p>"And are you truly Dwayanu?"</p>

<p>"I am he&mdash;none else, Lur."</p>

<p>"Who was Dwayanu&mdash;long and long and long ago?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you that, Lur&mdash;I who have been long asleep
and in sleep forgotten much. Yet&mdash;I am he."</p>

<p>"Then look&mdash;and remember."</p>

<p>Her hand left my heart and rested on my head; she pointed to the
waterfall. Slowly its whispering changed. It became the beat of
drums, the trample of horses, the tread of marching men. Louder and
louder they grew. The waterfall quivered, and spread across the
black cliff like a gigantic curtain. From every side the mist
wraiths were hurrying, melting into it. Clearer and nearer sounded
the drums. And suddenly the waterfall vanished. In its place was a
great walled city. Two armies were fighting there and I knew that
the forces which were attacking the city were being borne back. I
heard the thunder of the hoofs of hundreds of horses. Down upon the
defenders raced a river of mounted men. Their leader was clothed in
shining mail. He was helmetless, and his yellow hair streamed
behind him as he rode. He turned his face. And that face was my
own! I heard a roaring shout of "Dwayanu!" The charge struck like a
river in spate, rolled over the defenders, submerged them.</p>

<p>I saw an army in rout, and smashed by companies with the
throwing- hammers.</p>

<p>I rode with the yellow-haired leader into the conquered city.
And I sat with him on a conquered throne while ruthlessly,
mercilessly, he dealt death to men and women dragged before him,
and smiled at the voices of rapine and pillage rising from without.
I rode and sat with him, I say, for now it was no longer as though
I were in the Witch-woman's chamber but was with this yellow-haired
man who was my twin, seeing as he did, hearing as he did
&mdash;yes, and thinking as he thought.</p>

<p>Battle upon battle, tourneys and feasts and triumphs, hunts with
the falcons and hunts with great dogs in fair Ayjirland,
hammer-play and anvil-play&mdash;I saw them, standing always beside
Dwayanu like an unseen shadow. I went with him to the temples when
he served the gods. I went with him to the Temple of the
Dissolver&mdash;Black Khalk'ru, the Greater-than-Gods&mdash;and he
wore the ring which rested on my breast. But when he passed within
Khalk'ru's temple, I held back. The same deep, stubborn resistance
which had halted me when I had visioned the portal of the oasis
temple halted me now. I listened to two voices. One urged me to
enter with Dwayanu.</p>

<p>The other whispered that I must not. And that voice I could not
disobey.</p>

<p>And then, abruptly, Ayjirland was no more! I was staring out at
the waterfall and gliding mist wraiths. But&mdash;I was
Dwayanu!</p>

<p>I was all Dwayanu! Leif Langdon had ceased to exist!</p>

<p>Yet he had left memories&mdash;memories which were like
half-remembered dreams, memories whose source I could not fathom
but realized that, even if only dreams, were true ones. They told
me the Ayjirland I had ruled had vanished as utterly as had the
phantom Ayjirland of the waterfall, that dusty century upon century
had passed since them, that other empires had risen and fallen,
that here was an alien land with only a dying fragment of the
ancient glory.</p>

<p>Warrior-king and warrior-priest I had been, holding in my hands
empire and the lives and destinies of a race.</p>

<p>And now&mdash;no more!</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap16" id="chap16"></a>16. &mdash; KISSES OF LUR</h2>

<p class="first">Black sorrow and the bitter ashes were in my heart
when I turned from the window. I looked at Lur. From long slim feet
to shining head I looked at her, and the black sorrow lightened and
the bitter ashes blew away.</p>

<p>I put my hands on her shoulders and laughed. Luka had spun her
wheel and sent my empire flying off its rim like dust from the
potter's. But she had left me something. In all old Ayjirland there
had been few women like this.</p>

<p>Praise Luka! A sacrifice to her next morning if this woman
proves what I think her!</p>

<p>My vanished empire! What of it? I would build another. Enough
that I was alive!</p>

<p>Again I laughed. I put my hand under Lur's chin, raised her face
to mine, set my lips against hers. She thrust me from her. There
was anger in her eyes &mdash;but there was doubt under the
anger.</p>

<p>"You bade me remember. Well, I have remembered. Why did you open
the gates of memory. Witch-woman, unless you had made up your mind
to abide by what came forth? Or did you know less of Dwayanu than
you pretended?"</p>

<p>She took a step back; she said, furiously:</p>

<p>"I give my kisses. None takes them."</p>

<p>I caught her in my arms, crushed her mouth to mine, then
released her.</p>

<p>"I take them."</p>

<p>I struck down at her right wrist. There was a dagger in her
hand. I was amused, wondering where she had hidden it. I wrenched
it from her grip and slipped it in my girdle.</p>

<p>"And draw the stings from those I kiss. Thus did Dwayanu in the
days of old and thus he does to-day."</p>

<p>She stepped back and back, eyes dilated. Ai! but I could read
her! She had thought me other than I was, thought me hare-brain,
imposter, trickster. And it had been in her mind to trick me, to
bend me to her will. To beguile me. Me&mdash;Dwayanu, who knew
women as I knew war! And yet&mdash;</p>

<p>She was very beautiful...and she was all I had in this alien
land to begin the building of my rule. I summed her up as she stood
staring at me. I spoke, and my words were as cold as my
thoughts.</p>

<p>"Play no more with daggers&mdash;nor with me. Call your
servants. I am hungry and I thirst. When I have eaten and drunk we
will talk."</p>

<p>She hesitated, then clapped her hands. Women came in with
steaming dishes, with ewers of wine, with fruits. I ate ravenously.
I drank deeply. I ate and drank, thinking little of Lur&mdash;but
thinking much of what her sorcery had made me see, drawing together
what I remembered from desert oasis until now. It was little
enough. I ate and drank silently. I felt her eyes upon me. I looked
into them and smiled. "You thought to make me slave to your will,
Lur. Never think it again!"</p>

<p>She dropped her head between her hands and gazed at me across
the table.</p>

<p>"Dwayanu died long and long ago. Can the leaf that has withered
grow green?"</p>

<p>"I am he, Lur."</p>

<p>She did not answer.</p>

<p>"What was in your thought when you brought me here, Lur?"</p>

<p>"I am weary of Tibur, weary of his laughter, weary of his
stupidity."</p>

<p>"What else?"</p>

<p>"I tire of Yodin. You and I&mdash;alone&mdash;could rule Karak,
if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That 'if' is the heart of it. Witch-woman. What is it?"</p>

<p>She arose, leaned toward me.</p>

<p>"If you can summon Khalk'ru!"</p>

<p>"And if I cannot?"</p>

<p>She shrugged her white shoulders, dropped back into her chair. I
laughed.</p>

<p>"In which case Tibur will not be so wearisome, and Yodin may be
tolerated. Now listen to me, Lur. Was it your voice I heard urging
me to enter Khalk'ru's temples? Did you see as I was seeing? You
need not answer. I read you, Lur. You would be rid of Tibur. Well,
perhaps I can kill him. You would be rid of Yodin. Well, no matter
who I am, if I can summon the Greater-than-Gods, there is no need
of Yodin. Tibur and Yodin gone, there would be only you and me. You
think you could rule me. You could not, Lur."</p>

<p>She had listened quietly, and quietly now she answered.</p>

<p>"All that is true&mdash;"</p>

<p>She hesitated; her eyes glowed; a rosy flush swept over bosom
and cheeks.</p>

<p>"Yet&mdash;there might be another reason why I took
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>I did not ask her what that other reason might be; women had
tried to snare me with that ruse before. Her gaze dropped from me,
the cruelty on the red mouth stood out for an instant, naked.</p>

<p>"What did you promise Yodin, Witch-woman?"</p>

<p>She arose, held out her arms to me, her voice
trembled&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are you less than man&mdash;that you can speak to me so! Have I
not offered you power, to share with me? Am I not
beautiful&mdash;am I not desirable?"</p>

<p>"Very beautiful, very desirable. But always I learned the traps
my city concealed before I took it."</p>

<p>Her eyes shot blue fires at that. She took a swift step toward
the door. I was swifter. I held her, caught the hand she raised to
strike me.</p>

<p>"What did you promise the High-priest, Lur?"</p>

<p>I put the point of the dagger at her throat. Her eyes blazed at
me, unafraid. Luka&mdash;turn your wheel so I need not slay this
woman!</p>

<p>Her straining body relaxed; she laughed.</p>

<p>"Put away the dagger, I will tell you."</p>

<p>I released her, and walked back to my chair. She studied me from
her place across the table; she said, half incredulously:</p>

<p>"You would have killed me!"</p>

<p>"Yes," I told her.</p>

<p>"I believe you. Whoever you may be. Yellow-hair&mdash;there is
no man like you here."</p>

<p>"Whoever I may be&mdash;Witch?"</p>

<p>She stirred impatiently.</p>

<p>"No further need for pretense between us." There was anger in
her voice. "I am done with lies&mdash;better for both if you be
done with them too. Whoever you are&mdash;you are not Dwayanu. I
say again that the withered leaf cannot turn green nor the dead
return."</p>

<p>"If I am not he, then whence came those memories you watched
with me not long ago? Did they pass from your mind to mine.
Witch-woman&mdash;or from my mind to yours?"</p>

<p>She shook her head, and again I saw a furtive doubt cloud her
eyes.</p>

<p>"I saw nothing. I meant you to see&mdash;something. You eluded
me. Whatever it was you saw&mdash;I had no part in it. Nor could I
bend you to my will. I saw nothing."</p>

<p>"I saw the ancient land, Lur."</p>

<p>She said, sullenly:</p>

<p>"I could go no farther than its portal."</p>

<p>"What was it you sent me into Ayjirland to find for Yodin,
Witch- woman?"</p>

<p>"Khalk'ru," she answered evenly.</p>

<p>"And why?"</p>

<p>"Because then I would have known surely, beyond all doubt,
whether you could summon him. That was what I promised Yodin to
discover."</p>

<p>"And if I could summon him?"</p>

<p>"Then you were to be slain before you had opportunity."</p>

<p>"And if I could not?"</p>

<p>"Then you would be offered to him in the temple."</p>

<p>"By Zarda!" I swore. "Dwayanu's welcome is not like what he had
of old when he went visiting&mdash;or, if you prefer it, the
hospitality you offer a stranger is no thing to encourage
travelers. Now do I see eye to eye with you in this matter of
eliminating Tibur and the priest. But why should I not begin with
you. Witch?"</p>

<p>She leaned back, smiling.</p>

<p>"First&mdash;because it would do you no good. Yellow-hair.
Look."</p>

<p>She beckoned me to one of the windows. From it I could see the
causeway and the smooth hill upon which we had emerged from the
forest. There were soldiers all along the causeway and the top of
the hill held a company of them. I felt that she was quite
right&mdash;even I could not get through them unscathed. The old
cold rage began to rise within me. She watched me, with mockery in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"And second&mdash;" she said. "And second&mdash;well, hear me.
Yellow- hair."</p>

<p>I poured wine, raised the goblet to her, and drank. She
said:</p>

<p>"Life is pleasant in this land. Pleasant at least for those of
us who rule it. I have no desire to change it&mdash;except in the
matter of Tibur and Yodin. And another matter of which we can talk
later. I know the world has altered since long and long ago our
ancestors fled from Ayjirland. I know there is life outside this
sheltered place to which Khalk'ru led those ancestors. Yodin and
Tibur know it, and some few more. Others guess it. But none of us
desires to leave this pleasant place&mdash;nor do we desire it
invaded. Particularly have we no desire to have our people go from
it. And this many would attempt if they knew there were green
fields and woods and running water and a teeming world of men
beyond us. For through the uncounted years they have been taught
that in all the world there is no life save here. That Khalk'ru,
angered by the Great Sacrilege when Ayjirland rose in revolt and
destroyed his temples, then destroyed all life except here, and
that only by Khalk'ru's sufferance does it here exist&mdash;and
shall persist only so long as he is offered the ancient Sacrifice.
You follow me. Yellow-hair."</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>"The prophecy of Dwayanu is an ancient one. He was the greatest
of the Ayjir kings. He lived a hundred years or more before the
Ayjirs began to turn their faces from Khalk'ru, to resist the
Sacrifice&mdash;and the desert in punishment began to waste the
land. And as the unrest grew, and the great war which was to
destroy the Ayjirs brewed, the prophecy was born. That he would
return to restore the ancient glory. No new story. Yellow-hair.
Others have had their Dwayanus&mdash;the Redeemer, the Liberator,
the Loosener of Fate &mdash;or so I have read in those rolls our
ancestors carried with them when they fled. I do not believe these
stories; new Dwayanus may arise, but the old ones do not return.
Yet the people know the prophecy, and the people will believe
anything that promises them freedom from something they do not
like. And it is from the people that the sacrifices to Khalk'ru are
taken&mdash; and they do not like the Sacrifice. But because they
fear what might come if there were no more sacrifices&mdash;they
endure them.</p>

<p>"And now. Yellow-hair&mdash;we come to you. When first I saw
you, heard you shouting that you were Dwayanu, I took council with
Yodin and Tibur. I thought you then from Sirk. Soon I knew that
could not be. There was another with you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Another?" I asked, in genuine surprise.</p>

<p>She looked at me, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"You have no memory of him?"</p>

<p>"No. I remember seeing you. You had a white falcon. There were
other women with you. I saw you from the river."</p>

<p>She leaned forward, gaze intent.</p>

<p>"You remember the Rrrllya&mdash;the Little People? A dark girl
who calls herself Evalie?"</p>

<p>Little People&mdash;a dark girl&mdash;Evalie? Yes, I did
remember something of them&mdash;but vaguely. They had been in
those dreams I had forgotten, perhaps. No&mdash;they had been
real...or had they?</p>

<p>"Faintly, I seem to remember something of them, Lur. Nothing
clearly."</p>

<p>She stared at me, a curious exultation in her eyes.</p>

<p>"No matter," she said. "Do not try to think of them. You were
not&mdash; awake. Later we will speak of them. They are enemies. No
matter&mdash; follow me now. If you were from Sirk, posing as
Dwayanu, you might be a rallying point for our discontented.
Perhaps even the leader they needed. If you were from
outside&mdash;you were still more dangerous, since you could prove
us liars. Not only the people, but the soldiers might rally to you.
And probably would. What was there for us to do but to kill
you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," I answered. "I wonder now you did not when you had
the chance."</p>

<p>"You had complicated matters," she said. "You had shown the
ring. Many had seen it, many had heard you call yourself
Dwayanu&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ah, yes! I remember now&mdash;I had come up from the river. How
had I gotten into the river? The
bridge&mdash;Nansur&mdash;something had happened there...it was all
misty, nothing clear-cut...the Little People...yes, I remembered
something of them...they were afraid of me...but I had nothing
against them...vainly I tried to sort the vague visions into some
pattern. Lur's voice recalled my wandering thoughts.</p>

<p>"And so," she was saying, "I made Yodin see that it was not well
to slay you outright. It would have been known, and caused too much
unrest&mdash; strengthened Sirk for one thing. Caused unrest among
the soldiers. What &mdash;Dwayanu had come and we had slain him! 'I
will take him,' I told Yodin. 'I do not trust Tibur who, in his
stupidity and arrogance, might easily destroy us all. There is a
better way. Let Khalk'ru eat him and so prove us right and him the
liar and braggart. Then not soon will another come shouting that he
is Dwayanu'!"</p>

<p>"So the High-priest does not think me Dwayanu, either?"</p>

<p>"Less even than I do. Yellow-hair," she said, smiling. "Nor
Tibur. But who you are, and whence you came, and how and
why&mdash;that puzzles them as it does me. You look like the
Ayjir&mdash;it means nothing. You have the ancient marks upon your
hands&mdash;well, granted you are of the ancient blood. So has
Tibur&mdash;and he is no Redeemer," again her laughter rang like
little bells, "You have the ring. Where did you find it.
Yellow-hair? For you know little of its use. Yodin found that out.
When you were in sleep. And Yodin saw you turn color and half turn
to flee when first you saw Khalk'ru in his chamber. Deny it not.
Yellow-hair. I saw it myself. Ah, no &mdash;Yodin has little fear
of a rival with the Dissolver. Yet&mdash;he is not wholly certain.
There is the faintest shadow of doubt. I played on that. And
so&mdash;you are here."</p>

<p>I looked at her with frankest admiration, again raised the
goblet and drank to her. I clapped my hands, and the serving girls
entered.</p>

<p>"Clear the table! Bring wine!"</p>

<p>They came with fresh ewers and goblets. When they had gone out I
went over to the door. There was a heavy bar that closed it. I
thrust it down. I picked up one of the ewers and half emptied
it.</p>

<p>"I can summon the Dissolver, Witch-woman."</p>

<p>She drew in her breath, sharply; her body trembled; the blue
fires of her eyes were bright&mdash;bright.</p>

<p>"Shall I show you?"</p>

<p>I took the ring from the locket, slipped it on my thumb, raised
my hands in the beginning of the salutation&mdash;</p>

<p>A cold breath seemed to breathe through the room. The
Witch-woman sprang to me, dragged down my hand. Her lips were
white.</p>

<p>"No!&mdash;No! I believe&mdash;Dwayanu!"</p>

<p>I laughed. The strange cold withdrew, stealthily.</p>

<p>"And now. Witch, what will you tell the priest?"</p>

<p>The blood was slowly coming back into her lips and face. She
lifted the ewer and drained it. Her hand was steady. An admirable
woman&mdash;this Lur!</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>"I will tell him that you are powerless."</p>

<p>I said:</p>

<p>"I will summon the Dissolver. I will kill Tibur. I will kill
Yodin&mdash; what else is there?"</p>

<p>She came to me, stood with breast touching mine.</p>

<p>"Destroy Sirk. Sweep the dwarfs away. Then you and I shall
rule&mdash; alone."</p>

<p>I drank more wine.</p>

<p>"I will summon Khalk'ru; I will eliminate Tibur and the priest;
I will sack Sirk and I will war against the
dwarfs&mdash;if&mdash;"</p>

<p>She looked into my eyes, long and long; her arm stole round my
shoulder... I thrust out a hand and swept away the candles. The
green darkness of the mirage night seeped through the casements.
The whispering of the waterfall was soft laughter.</p>

<p>"I take my pay in advance," I said. "Such was Dwayanu's way of
old&mdash; and am I not Dwayanu?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" whispered the Witch-woman.</p>

<p>She took the strand of sapphires from her hair, she unbraided
her coronal and shook loose its russet-gold. Her arms went round my
neck. Her lips sought mine and clung to them.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>There was the beat of horses' hoofs on the causeway. A distant
challenge. A knocking at the door. The Witch-woman awakened, sat
sleepily up under the silken tent of her hair.</p>

<p>"Is it you, Ouarda?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mistress. A messenger from Tibur."</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>"Tell him you are busy with your gods, Lur."</p>

<p>She bent her head over mine so that the silken tent of it
covered us both.</p>

<p>"Tell him I am busy with the gods, Ouarda. He may stay till
morning &mdash;or return to Tibur with the message."</p>

<p>She sank back, pressed her lips to mine&mdash;</p>

<p>By Zarda! But it was as it was of old&mdash;enemies to slay, a
city to sack, a nation to war with and a woman's soft arms around
me.</p>

<p>I was well content!</p>

<h2><a name="book3" id="book3"></a>BOOK OF DWAYANU</h2>

<h2><a name="chap17" id="chap17"></a>17. &mdash; ORDEAL BY
KHALK'RU</h2>

<p class="first">Twice the green night had filled the bowl of the
land beneath the mirage while I feasted and drank with Lur and her
women. Sword-play there had been, and the hammer-play and
wrestling. They were warriors&mdash;these women! Tempered steel
under silken skins, they pressed me hard now and again&mdash;
strong as I was, quick as I might be. If Sirk were soldiered by
such as these, it would be no easy conquest.</p>

<p>By the looks they gave me and by soft whispered words I knew I
need not be lonely if Lur rode off to Karak. But she did not; she
was ever at my side, and no more messengers came from Tibur; or if
they did I did not know it. She had sent secret word to the
High-priest that he had been right&mdash;I had no power to summon
the Greater-than-Gods&mdash;that I was either imposter or mad. Or
so she told me. Whether she had lied to him or, lied now to me I
did not know and did not greatly care. I was too
busy&mdash;living.</p>

<p>Yet no more did she call me Yellow-hair. Always it was Dwayanu.
And every art of love of hers&mdash;and she was no novice, the
Witch-woman&mdash; she used to bind me tighter to her.</p>

<p>It was early dawn of the third day; I was leaning from the
casement, watching the misty jewel-fires of the luminous lilies
fade, the mist wraiths that were the slaves of the waterfall rise
slowly and more slowly. I thought Lur asleep. I heard her stir, and
turned. She was sitting up, peering at me through the red veils of
her hair. She looked all Witch-woman then...</p>

<p>"A messenger came to me last night from Yodin. To-day you pray
to Khalk'ru."</p>

<p>A thrill went through me; the blood sang in my ears. Always had
I felt so when I must evoke the Dissolver&mdash;a feeling of power
that surpassed even that of victory. Different&mdash;a sense of
inhuman power and pride. And with it a deep anger, revolt against
this Being which was Life's enemy. This demon that fed on
Ayjirland's flesh and blood&mdash;and soul. She was watching me.
"Are you afraid, Dwayanu?" I sat beside her, parted the veils of
her hair. "Was that why your kisses were doubled last night, Lur?
Why they were so&mdash;tender? Tenderness, Witch-woman, becomes
you&mdash;but it sits strangely on you. Were you afraid? For me?
You soften me, Lur!" Her eyes flashed, her face flushed at my
laughter. "You do not believe I love you, Dwayanu?"</p>

<p>"Not so much as you love power, Witch-woman."</p>

<p>"You love me?"</p>

<p>"Not so much as I love power, Witch-woman," I answered, and
laughed again.</p>

<p>She studied me with narrowed eyes. She said:</p>

<p>"There is much talk in Karak of you. It grows menacing. Yodin
regrets that he did not kill you when he could have&mdash;but knows
full well the case might be worse if he had. Tibur regrets he did
not kill you when you came up from the river&mdash;urges that no
more time be lost in doing so. Yodin has declared you a false
prophet and has promised that the Greater-than-Gods will prove you
so. He believes what I have told you&mdash;or perhaps he has a
hidden sword. You"&mdash;faint mockery crept into her
voice&mdash;"you, who can read me so easily, surely can read him
and guard against it! The people murmur; there are nobles who
demand you be brought forth; and the soldiers would follow Dwayanu
eagerly&mdash;if they believed you truly he. They are restless.
Tales spread. You have grown exceedingly&mdash; inconvenient. So
you face Khalk'ru to-day."</p>

<p>"If all that be true," I said, "it occurs to me that I may not
have to evoke the Dissolver to gain rule."</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>"It was not your old cunning which sent that thought. You will
be closely guarded. You would be slain before you could rally a
dozen round you. Why not &mdash;since there would then be nothing
to lose by killing you? And perhaps something to be gained.
Besides&mdash;what of your promises to me?"</p>

<p>I thrust my arm around her shoulders, lifted and kissed her.</p>

<p>"As for being slain&mdash;well, I would have a thing to say to
that. But I was jesting, Lur. I keep my promises."</p>

<p>There was the galloping of horses on the causeway, the jangle of
accoutrement, the rattle of kettle-drums. I went over to the
window. Lur sprang from the bed and stood beside me. Over the
causeway was coming a troop of a hundred or more horsemen. From
their spears floated yellow pennons bearing the black symbol of
Khalk'ru. They paused at the open drawbridge. At their head I
recognized Tibur, his great shoulders covered by a yellow cloak,
and on his breast the Kraken.</p>

<p>"They come to take you to the temple. I must let them pass."</p>

<p>"Why not?" I asked, indifferently. "But I'll go to no temple
until I've broken my fast."</p>

<p>I looked again toward Tibur.</p>

<p>"And if I ride beside the Smith, I would you had a coat of mail
to fit me."</p>

<p>"You ride beside me," she said. "And as for weapons, you shall
have your pick. Yet there is nothing to fear on the way to the
temple&mdash;it is within it that danger dwells."</p>

<p>"You speak too much of fear, Witch-woman," I said, frowning.
"Sound the horn. Tibur may think I am loath to meet him. And that I
would not have him believe."</p>

<p>She sounded the signal to the garrison at the bridge. I heard it
creaking as I bathed. And soon the horses were trampling before the
door of the castle. Lur's tire-woman entered, and with her she
slipped away.</p>

<p>I dressed leisurely. On my way to the great hall I stopped at
the chamber of weapons. There was a sword there I had seen and
liked. It was of the weight to which I was accustomed, and long and
curved and of metal excellent as any I had ever known in Ayjirland.
I weighed it in my left hand and took a lighter one for my right. I
recalled that someone had told me to beware of Tibur's left
hand...ah, yes, the woman soldier. I laughed&mdash;well, let Tibur
beware of mine. I took a hammer, not so heavy as the Smith's...that
was his vanity...there was more control to the lighter sledges...I
fastened to my forearm the strong strap that held its thong. Then I
went down to meet Tibur.</p>

<p>There were a dozen of the Ayjir nobles in the hall, mostly men.
Lur was with them. I noticed she had posted her soldiers at various
vantage points, and that they were fully armed. I took that for
evidence of her good faith, although it somewhat belied her
assurance to me that I need fear no danger until I had reached the
temple. I had no fault to find in Tibur's greeting. Nor with those
of the others. Except one. There was a man beside the Smith almost
as tall as myself. He had cold blue eyes and in them the singular
expressionless stare that marks the born killer of men. There was a
scar running from left temple to chin, and his nose had been
broken. The kind of man, I reflected, whom in the olden days I
would have set over some peculiarly rebellious tribe. There was an
arrogance about him that irritated me, but I held it down. It was
not in my thoughts to provoke any conflict at this moment. I
desired to raise no suspicions in the mind of the Smith. My
greetings to him and to the others might be said to have had almost
a touch of apprehension, of conciliation.</p>

<p>I maintained that attitude while we broke fast and drank. Once
it was difficult. Tibur leaned toward the scar-face, laughing.</p>

<p>"I told you he was taller than you, Rascha. The gray stallion is
mine!"</p>

<p>The blue eyes ran over me, and my gorge rose.</p>

<p>"The stallion is yours."</p>

<p>Tibur leaned toward me.</p>

<p>"Rascha the Back-breaker, he is named. Next to me, the strongest
in Karak. Too bad you must meet the Greater-than-Gods so quickly. A
match between you two would be worth the seeing."</p>

<p>Now my rage swelled up at this, and my hand dropped to my sword,
but I managed to check it, and answered with a touch of
eagerness.</p>

<p>"True enough&mdash;perhaps that meeting may be deferred..."</p>

<p>Lur frowned and stared at me, but Tibur snapped at the bait, his
eyes gleaming with malice.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;there is one that may not be kept waiting. But
after&mdash; perhaps..."</p>

<p>His laughter shook the table. The others joined in it. The
scar-face grinned. By Zarda, but this is not to be borne! Careful,
Dwayanu, thus you tricked them in the olden days&mdash;and thus you
shall trick them now. I drained my goblet, and another. I joined
them in their laughter&mdash;as though I wondered why they laughed.
But I sealed their faces in my memory. We rode over the causeway
with Lur at my right and a close half-circle of her picked women
covering us.</p>

<p>Ahead of us went Tibur and the Back-breaker with a dozen of
Tibur's strongest. Behind us came the troop with the yellow
pennons, and behind them another troop of the Witch-woman's
guards.</p>

<p>I rode with just the proper touch of dejection. Now and then the
Smith and his familiars looked back at me. And I would hear, their
laughter. The Witch-woman rode as silently as I. She glanced at me
askance, and when that happened I dropped my head a little
lower.</p>

<p>The black citadel loomed ahead of us. We entered the city. By
that time the puzzlement in Lur's eyes had changed almost to
contempt, the laughter of the Smith become derisive.</p>

<p>The streets were crowded with the people of Karak. And now I
sighed, and seemed to strive to arouse myself from my dejection,
but still rode listlessly. And Lur bit her lip, and drew close to
me, frowning.</p>

<p>"Have you tricked me. Yellow-hair? You go like a dog already
beaten!"</p>

<p>I turned my head from her that she might not see my face. By
Luka, but it was hard to stifle my own laughter!</p>

<p>There were whisperings, murmurings, among the crowd. There were
no shouts, no greetings. Everywhere were the soldiers, sworded and
armed with the hammers, spears and pikes ready. There were archers.
The High-priest was taking no chances.</p>

<p>Nor was I.</p>

<p>It was no intention of mine to precipitate a massacre. None to
give Tibur slightest excuse to do away with me, turn spears and
arrow storm upon me. Lur had thought my danger not on my way to the
temple, but when within it. I knew the truth was the exact
opposite.</p>

<p>So it was no conquering hero, no redeemer, no splendid warrior
from the past who rode through Karak that day. It was a man not
sure of himself &mdash;or better, too sure of what was in store for
him. The people who had waited and watched for Dwayanu felt
that&mdash;and murmured, or were silent. That well pleased the
Smith. And it well pleased me, who by now was as eager to meet
Khalk'ru as any bridegroom his bride. And was taking no risks of
being stopped by sword or hammer, spear or arrow before I
could.</p>

<p>And ever the frown on the face of the Witch-woman grew darker,
and stronger the contempt and fury in her eyes.</p>

<p>We skirted the citadel, and took a broad road leading back to
the cliffs. We galloped along this, pennons flying, drums rolling.
We came to a gigantic doorway in the cliff&mdash;many times had I
gone through such a door as that! I dismounted, hesitatingly.
Half-reluctantly, I let myself be led through it by Tibur and Lur
and into a small rock-hewn chamber.</p>

<p>They left me, without a word. I glanced about. Here were the
chests that held the sacrificial garments, the font of
purification, the vessels for the anointing of the evoker of
Khalk'ru.</p>

<p>The door opened. I looked into the face of Yodin.</p>

<p>There was vindictive triumph in it, and I knew he had met the
Smith and Witch-woman, and that they had told him how I had ridden.
As a victim to the Sacrifice! Well, Lur could tell him honestly
what he hoped was the truth. If she had the thought to betray
me&mdash;had betrayed me&mdash;she now believed me liar and
braggart with quite as good reason as Tibur and the others. If she
had not betrayed me, I had backed her lie to Yodin.</p>

<p>Twelve lesser priests filed in behind him, dressed in the sacred
robes. The High-priest wore the yellow smock with the tentacles
entwined round him. The ring of Khalk'ru shone on his thumb.</p>

<p>"The Greater-than-Gods awaits your prayer, Dwayanu," he said.
"But first you must undergo purification."</p>

<p>I nodded. They busied themselves with the necessary rites. I
submitted to them awkwardly, like one not familiar with them, but
as one who plainly wished to be thought so. The malice in Yodin's
eyes increased.</p>

<p>The rites were finished. Yodin took a smock like his own from a
chest and draped it on me. I waited.</p>

<p>"Your ring," he reminded me, sardonically. "Have you forgotten
you must wear the ring!"</p>

<p>I fumbled at the chain around my neck, opened the locket and
slipped the ring over my thumb. The lesser priests passed from the
chamber with their drums. I followed, the High-priest beside me. I
heard the clang of a hammer striking a great anvil. And knew it for
the voice of Tubalka, the oldest god, who had taught man to wed
fire and metal. Tubalka's recognition of, his salutation and his
homage to&mdash;Khalk'ru!</p>

<p>The olden exaltation, the ecstasy of dark power, was pouring
through me. Hard it was not to betray it. We came out of the
passage and into the temple.</p>

<p>Hai! But they had done well by the Greater-than-Gods in this far
shrine! Vaster temple I had never beheld in Ayjirland. Cut from the
mountain's heart, as all Khalk'ru's abodes must be, the huge
pillars which bordered the amphitheater struck up to a ceiling lost
in darkness. There were cressets of twisted metal and out of them
sprang smooth spirals of wan yellow flame. They burned steadily and
soundlessly; by their wan light I could see the pillars marching,
marching away as though into the void itself.</p>

<p>Faces were staring up at me from the amphitheater&mdash;hundreds
of them. Women's faces under pennons and bannerets broidered with
devices of clans whose men had fought beside and behind me in many
a bloody battle. Gods &mdash;how few the men were here! They stared
up at me, these women faces... women&mdash;nobles, women-knights,
women-soldiers...They stared up at me by the hundreds...blue eyes
ruthless...nor was there pity nor any softness of woman in their
faces...warriors they were...Good! Then not as women but as
warriors would I treat them.</p>

<p>And now I saw that archers were posted on the borders of the
amphitheater, bows in readiness, arrows at rest but poised, and the
bow-strings lined toward me.</p>

<p>Tibur's doings? Or the priest's&mdash;watchful lest I should
attempt escape? I had no liking for that, but there was no help for
it. Luka, Lovely Goddess&mdash;turn your wheel so no arrow flies
before I begin the ritual!</p>

<p>I turned and looked for the mystic screen which was Khalk'ru's
doorway from the Void. It was a full hundred paces away from me, so
broad and deep was the platform of rock. Here the cavern had been
shaped into a funnel. The mystic screen was a gigantic disk, a
score of times the height of a tall man. Not the square of lucent
yellow through which, in the temples of the Motherland, Khalk'ru
had become corporeal. For the first time I felt a doubt &mdash;was
this Being the same? Was there other reason for the High-priest's
malignant confidence than his disbelief in me?</p>

<p>But there in the yellow field floated the symbol of the
Greater-than- Gods; his vast black body lay as though suspended in
a bubble-ocean of yellow space; his tentacles spread like monstrous
rays of black stars and his dreadful eyes brooded on the temple as
though, as always, they saw all and saw nothing. The symbol was
unchanged. The tide of conscious, dark power in my mind, checked
for that instant, resumed its upward flow.</p>

<p>And now I saw between me and the screen a semi-circle of women.
Young they were, scarce blossomed out of girlhood&mdash;but already
in fruit. Twelve of them I counted, each standing in the shallow
hollowed cup of sacrifice, the golden girdles of the sacrifice
around their waists. Over white shoulders, over young breasts, fell
the veils of their ruddy hair, and through those veils they looked
at me with blue eyes in which horror lurked. Yet though they could
not hide that horror in their eyes from me who was so close, they
hid it from those who watched us from beyond. They stood within the
cups, erect, proudly, defiant. Ai! but they were brave&mdash;those
women of Karak! I felt the olden pity for them; stirring of the
olden revolt.</p>

<p>In the center of the semi-circle of women swung a thirteenth
ring, held by strong golden chains dropping from the temple's roof.
It was empty, the clasps of the heavy girdle open&mdash;</p>

<p>The thirteenth ring! The ring of the Warrior's Sacrifice! Open
for&mdash; me!</p>

<p>I looked at the High-priest. He stood beside his priests
squatting at their drums. His gaze was upon me. Tibur stood at the
edge of the platform beside the anvil of Tubalka, in his hands the
great sledge, on his face reflection of the gloating on that of the
High-priest. The Witch-woman I could not see.</p>

<p>The High-priest stepped forward. He spoke into the dark vastness
of the temple where was the congregation of the nobles.</p>

<p>"Here stands one who comes to us calling himself&mdash;Dwayanu.
If he be Dwayanu, then will the Greater-than-Gods, mighty Khalk'ru,
hear his prayer and accept the Sacrifices. But if Khalk'ru be deaf
to him&mdash;he is proven cheat and liar. And Khalk'ru will not be
deaf to me who have served him faithfully. Then this cheat and liar
swings within the Warrior's Ring for Khalk'ru to punish as he
wills. Hear me! Is it just? Answer!"</p>

<p>From the depths of the temple came the voices of the
witnesses.</p>

<p>"We hear! It is just!"</p>

<p>The High-priest turned to me as if to speak. But if that had
been his mind, he changed it. Thrice he raised his staff of golden
bells and shook them. Thrice Tibur raised the hammer and smote the
anvil of Tubalka.</p>

<p>Out of the depths of the temple came the ancient chant, the
ancient supplication which Khalk'ru had taught our forefathers when
he chose us from all the peoples of earth, forgotten age upon
forgotten age ago. I listened to it as to a nursery song. And
Tibur's eyes never left me, his hand on hammer in readiness to hurl
and cripple if I tried to flee; nor did Yodin's gaze leave me.</p>

<p>The chant ended.</p>

<p>Swiftly I raised my hands in the ancient sign, and I did with
the ring what the ancient ritual ordered&mdash;and through the
temple swept that first breath of cold that was presage of the
coming of Khalk'ru!</p>

<p>Hail The faces of Yodin and Tibur when they felt that breath!
Would that I could look on them! Laugh now, Tibur! Hai! but they
could not stop me now! Not even the Smith would dare hurl hammer
nor raise hand to loose arrow storm upon me! Not even Yodin would
dare halt me&mdash;I forgot all that. I forgot Yodin and Tibur. I
forgot, as ever I forgot, the Sacrifices in the dark exultation of
the ritual.</p>

<p>The yellow stone wavered, was shot through with tremblings. It
became thin as air. It vanished.</p>

<p>Where it had been, black tentacles quivering, black body
hovering, vanishing into immeasurable space, was Khalk'ru!</p>

<p>Faster, louder, beat the drums.</p>

<p>The black tentacles writhed forward. The women did not see them.
Their eyes clung to me...as though...as though I held for them some
hope that flamed through their despair! I...who had summoned their
destroyer...</p>

<p>The tentacles touched them. I saw the hope fade and die. The
tentacles coiled round their shoulders. They slid across their
breasts. Embraced them. Slipped down their thighs and touched their
feet. The drums began their swift upward flight into the crescendo
of the Sacrifice's culmination.</p>

<p>The wailing of the women was shrill above the drums. Their white
bodies became gray mist. They became shadows. They were
gone&mdash;gone before the sound of their wailing had died. The
golden girdles fell clashing to the rock&mdash;</p>

<p>What was wrong? The ritual was ended. The Sacrifice accepted.
Yet Khalk'ru still hovered!</p>

<p>And the lifeless cold was creeping round me, was rising round
me...</p>

<p>A tentacle swayed and writhed forward. Slowly, slowly, it passed
the Warrior's Ring&mdash;came closer&mdash;closer&mdash;</p>

<p>It was reaching for me!</p>

<p>I heard a voice intoning. Intoning words more ancient than I had
ever known. Words? They were not words! They were sounds whose
roots struck back and back into a time before ever man drew
breath.</p>

<p>It was Yodin&mdash;Yodin speaking in a tongue that might have
been Khalk'ru's own before ever life was!</p>

<p>Drawing Khalk'ru upon me by it! Sending me along the road the
Sacrifices had traveled!</p>

<p>I leaped upon Yodin. I caught him in my arms and thrust him
between me and the questing tentacle. I raised Yodin in my arms as
though he had been a doll and flung him to Khalk'ru. He went
through the tentacle as though it had been cloud. He struck the
chains that held the Warrior's Ring. He swung in them, entangled.
He slithered down upon the golden girdle.</p>

<p>Hands upraised, I heard myself crying to Khalk'ru those same
unhuman syllables. I did not know their meaning then, and do not
know them now &mdash;nor from whence knowledge of them came to
me...</p>

<p>I know they were sounds the throats and lips of men were never
meant to utter!</p>

<p>But Khalk'ru heard&mdash;and heeded! He hesitated. His eyes
stared at me, unfathomably&mdash;stared at and through me.</p>

<p>And then the tentacle curled back. It encircled Yodin. A thin
screeching &mdash;and Yodin was gone!</p>

<p>The living Khalk'ru was gone. Lucent yellow, the bubble-ocean
gleamed where he had been&mdash;the black shape floated inert
within it.</p>

<p>I heard a tinkle upon the rock, the ring of Yodin rolling down
the side of the cup. I leaped forward and picked it up.</p>

<p>Tibur, hammer half raised, stood glaring at me beside the anvil.
I snatched the sledge from his hand, gave him a blow that sent him
reeling.</p>

<p>I raised the hammer and crushed the ring of Yodin on the
anvil!</p>

<p>From the temple came a thunderous shout&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dwayanu!"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap18" id="chap18"></a>18. &mdash; WOLVES OF LUR</h2>

<p class="first">I rode through the forest with the Witch-woman.
The white falcon perched on her gauntleted wrist and cursed me with
unwinking golden eyes. It did not like me&mdash;Lur's falcon. A
score of her women rode behind us. A picked dozen of my own were
shield for my back. They rode close. So it was of old. I liked my
back covered. It was my sensitive part, whether with friends or
foes.</p>

<p>The armorers had fashioned me a jacket of the light chain-mail.
I wore it; Lur and our little troop wore them; and each was as
fully armed as I with the two swords, the long dagger and the
thonged hammer. We were on our way to reconnoiter Sirk.</p>

<p>For five days I had sat on the throne of the High-priest, ruling
Karak with the Witch-woman and Tibur. Lur had come to
me&mdash;penitent in her own fierce fashion. Tibur, all arrogance
and insolence evaporated, had bent the knee, proffering me
allegiance, protesting, reasonably enough, that his doubts had been
but natural. I accepted his allegiance, with reservations. Sooner
or later I would have to kill Tibur&mdash;even if I had not
promised Lur his death. But why kill him before he ceased to be
useful? He was a sharp-edged tool? Well, if he cut me in my
handling of him, it would be only my fault. Better a crooked sharp
knife than a straight dull one.</p>

<p>As for Lur&mdash;she was sweet woman flesh, and subtle. But did
she greatly matter? Not greatly&mdash;just then. There was a
lethargy upon me, a lassitude, as I rode beside her through the
fragrant forest.</p>

<p>Yet I had received from Karak homage and acclaim more than
enough to soothe any wounded pride. I was the idol of the soldiers.
I rode through the streets to the shouts of the people, and mothers
held their babes up to look on me. But there were many who were
silent when I passed, averting their heads, or glancing at me
askance with eyes shadowed by furtive hatred and fear.</p>

<p>Dara, the bold-eyed captain who had warned me of Tibur, and
Naral, the swaggering girl who had given me her locket, I had taken
for my own and had made them officers of my personal guard. They
were devoted and amusing. I had spoken to Dara only that morning of
those who looked askance at me, asking why.</p>

<p>"You want straight answer. Lord?"</p>

<p>"Always that, Dara."</p>

<p>She said bluntly:</p>

<p>"They are the ones who looked for a Deliverer. One who would
break chains. Open doors. Bring freedom. They say Dwayanu is only
another feeder of Khalk'ru. His butcher. Like Yodin. No worse,
maybe. No better certainly."</p>

<p>I thought of that strange hope I had seen strangled in the eyes
of the sacrifices. They too had hoped me Deliverer, instead
of...</p>

<p>"What do you think, Dara?"</p>

<p>"I think as you think. Lord," she answered. "Only&mdash;it would
not break my heart to see the golden girdles broken."</p>

<p>And I was thinking of that as I rode along with Lur, her falcon
hating me with its unwinking glare. What was&mdash;Khalk'ru? Often
and often, long and long and long ago, I had wondered that. Could
the illimitable cast itself into such a shape as that which came to
the call of the wearer of the ring? Or rather&mdash;would it? My
empire had been widespread&mdash;under sun and moon and stars. Yet
it was a mote in the sun-ray compared to the empire of the Spirit
of the Void. Would one so great be content to shrink himself within
the mote?</p>

<p>Ai! but there was no doubt that the Enemy of Life was! But was
that which came to the summons of the ring&mdash;the Enemy of Life?
And if not&mdash; then was this dark worship worth its cost?</p>

<p>A wolf howled. The Witch-woman threw back her head and answered
it. The falcon stretched its wings, screaming. We rode from the
forest into an open glade, moss-carpeted. She halted, sent again
from her throat the wolf cry.</p>

<p>Suddenly around us was a ring of wolves. White wolves whose
glowing green eyes were fixed on Lur. They ringed us, red tongues
lolling, fangs glistening. A patter of pads, and as suddenly the
circle of wolves was doubled. And others slipped through the trees
until the circle was three-fold, four-fold...until it was a wide
belt of living white flecked by scarlet flames of wolf-tongues,
studded with glinting emeralds of wolf-eyes...</p>

<p>My horse trembled; I smelled its sweat.</p>

<p>Lur drove her knees into the sides of her mount and rode
forward. Slowly she paced it round the inner circle of the white
wolves. She raised her hand; something she said. A great dog-wolf
arose from its haunches and came toward her. Like a dog, it put its
paws upon her saddle. She reached down, caught its jowls in her
hands. She whispered to it. The wolf seemed to listen. It slipped
back to the circle and squatted, watching her. I laughed.</p>

<p>"Are you woman&mdash;or wolf, Lur?"</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>"I, too, have my followers, Dwayanu. You could not easily win
these from me."</p>

<p>Something in her tone made me look at her sharply. It was the
first time that she had shown resentment, or at least chagrin, at
my popularity. She did not meet my gaze.</p>

<p>The big dog-wolf lifted its throat and howled. The circles
broke. They spread out, padding swiftly ahead of us like scouts.
They melted into the green shadows.</p>

<p>The forest thinned. Giant ferns took the place of the trees. I
began to hear a curious hissing. Also it grew steadily warmer, and
the air filled with moisture, and mist wreaths floated over the
ferns. I could see no tracks, yet Lur rode steadily as though upon
a well-marked road.</p>

<p>We came to a huge clump of ferns. Lur dropped from her
horse.</p>

<p>"We go on foot here, Dwayanu. It is but a little way."</p>

<p>I joined her. The troop drew up but did not alight. The
Witch-woman and I slipped through the ferns for a score of paces.
The dog-wolf stalked just ahead of her. She parted the fronds. Sirk
lay before me.</p>

<p>At right arose a bastion of perpendicular cliff, dripping with
moisture, little of green upon it except small ferns clinging to
precarious root-holds. At left, perhaps four arrow flights away,
was a similar bastion, soaring into the haze. Between these
bastions was a level platform of black rock. Its smooth and
glistening foundations dropped into a moat as wide as two strong
throws of a javelin. The platform curved outward, and from cliff to
cliff it was lipped with one unbroken line of fortress.</p>

<p>Hai! But that was a moat! Out from under the right-hand cliff
gushed a torrent. It hissed and bubbled as it shot forth, and the
steam from it wavered over the cliff face like a great veil and
fell upon us in a fine warm spray. It raced boiling along the rock
base of the fortress, and jets of steam broke through it and
immense bubbles rose and burst, scattering showers of scalding
spray.</p>

<p>The fortress itself was not high. It was squat and solidly
built, its front unbroken except for arrow slits close to the top.
There was a parapet across the top. Upon it I could see the glint
of spears and the heads of the guards. In only one part was there
anything like towers. These were close to the center where the
boiling moat narrowed. Opposite them, on the farther bank, was a
pier for a drawbridge. I could see the bridge, a narrow one, raised
and protruding from between the two towers like a tongue.</p>

<p>Behind the fortress, the cliffs swept inward. They did not
touch. Between them was a gap about a third as wide as the platform
of the fortress. In front of us, on our side of the boiling stream,
the sloping ground had been cleared both of trees and ferns. It
gave no cover.</p>

<p>They had picked their spot well, these outlaws of Sirk. No
besiegers could swim that moat with its hissing jets of live steam
and bursting bubbles rising continually from the geysers at its
bottom. No stones nor trees could damn it, making a causeway over
which to march to batter at the fortress's walls. There was no
taking of Sirk from this side. That was clear. Yet there must be
more of Sirk than this.</p>

<p>Lur had been following my eyes, reading my thoughts.</p>

<p>"Sirk itself lies beyond those gates," she pointed to the gap
between the cliffs. "It is a valley wherein is the city, the
fields, the herds. And there is no way into it except through those
gates."</p>

<p>I nodded, absently. I was studying the cliffs behind the
fortress. I saw that these, unlike the bastions in whose embrace
the platform lay, were not smooth. There had been falls of rock,
and these rocks had formed rough terraces. If one could get to
those terraces&mdash;unseen...</p>

<p>"Can we get closer to the cliff from which the torrent comes,
Lur?"</p>

<p>She caught my wrist, her eyes bright.</p>

<p>"What do you see, Dwayanu?"</p>

<p>"I do not know as yet. Witch-woman. Perhaps nothing. Can we get
closer to the torrent?"</p>

<p>"Come."</p>

<p>We slipped out of the ferns, skirted them, the dog-wolf walking
stiff- legged in the lead, eyes and ears alert. The air grew
hotter, vapor-filled, hard to breathe. The hissing became louder.
We crept through the ferns, wet to the skins. Another step and I
looked straight down upon the boiling torrent. I saw now that it
did not come directly from the cliff. It shot up from beneath it,
and its heat and its exhalations made me giddy. I tore a strip from
my tunic and wrapped it around mouth and nose. I studied the cliff
above it, foot by foot. Long I studied it and long&mdash;and then I
turned.</p>

<p>"We can go back, Lur."</p>

<p>"What have you seen, Dwayanu?"</p>

<p>What I had seen might be the end of Sirk&mdash;but I did not
tell her so. The thought was not yet fully born. It had never been
my way to admit others into half-formed plans. It is too dangerous.
The bud is more delicate than the flower and should be left to
develop free from prying hands or treacherous or even well-meant
meddling. Mature your plan and test it; then you can weigh with
clear judgment any changes. Nor was I ever strong for counsel; too
many pebbles thrown into the spring muddy it. That was one reason I
was&mdash;Dwayanu. I said to Lur:</p>

<p>"I do not know. I have a thought. But I must weigh it."</p>

<p>She said, angrily:</p>

<p>"I am not stupid. I know war&mdash;as I know love. I could
help&mdash; you."&mdash;</p>

<p>I said, impatiently:</p>

<p>"Not yet. When I have made my plan I will tell it to you."</p>

<p>She did not speak again until we were within sight of the
waiting women; then she turned to me. Her voice was low, and very
sweet:</p>

<p>"Will you not tell me? Are we not equal, Dwayanu?"</p>

<p>"No," I answered, and left her to decide whether that was answer
to the first question or both.</p>

<p>She mounted her horse, and we rode back through the forest.</p>

<p>I was thinking, thinking over what I had seen, and what it might
mean, when I heard again the howling of the wolves. It was a
steady, insistent howling. Summoning. The Witch-woman raised her
head, listened, then spurred her horse forward. I shot my own after
her. The white falcon fluttered, and beat up into the air,
screeching.</p>

<p>We raced out of the forest and upon a flower-covered meadow. In
the meadow stood a little man. The wolves surrounded him, weaving
around and around one another in a witch-ring. The instant they
caught sight of Lur, they ceased their cry&mdash;squatted on their
haunches. Lur checked her horse and rode slowly toward them. I
caught a glimpse of her face, and it was hard and fierce.</p>

<p>I looked at the little man. Little enough he was, hardly above
one of my knees, yet perfectly formed. A little golden man with
hair streaming down almost to his feet. One of the Rrrllya&mdash;I
had studied the woven pictures of them on the tapestries, but this
was the first living one I had seen&mdash;or was it? I had a vague
idea that once I had been in closer contact with them than the
tapestries.</p>

<p>The white falcon was circling round his head, darting down upon
him, striking at him with claws and beak. The little man held an
arm before his eyes, while the other was trying to beat the bird
away. The Witch-woman sent a shrill call to the falcon. It flew to
her, and the little man dropped his arms. His eyes fell upon
me.</p>

<p>He cried out to me, held his arms out to me, like a child.</p>

<p>There was appeal in cry and gesture. Hope, too, and confidence.
It was like a frightened child calling to one whom it knew and
trusted. In his eyes I saw again the hope that I had watched die in
the eyes of the Sacrifices. Well, I would not watch it die in the
eyes of the little man!</p>

<p>I thrust my horse past Lur's, and lifted it over the barrier of
the wolves. Leaning from the saddle, I caught the little man up in
my arms. He clung to me, whispering in strange trilling sounds.</p>

<p>I looked back at Lur. 'She had halted her horse beyond the
wolves.</p>

<p>She cried:</p>

<p>"Bring him to me!"</p>

<p>The little man clutched me tight, and broke into a rapid babble
of the strange sounds. Quite evidently he had understood, and quite
as evidently he was imploring me to do anything other than turn him
over to the Witch-woman.</p>

<p>I laughed, and shook my head at her. I saw her eyes blaze with
quick, uncontrollable fury. Let her rage! The little man should go
safe! I put my heels to the horse and leaped the far ring of
wolves. I saw not far away the gleam of the river, and turned my
horse toward it.</p>

<p>The Witch-woman gave one wild, fierce cry. And then there was
the whirr of wings around my head, and the buffeting of wings about
my ears. I threw up a hand. I felt it strike the falcon, and I
heard it shriek with rage and pain. The little man shrank closer to
me.</p>

<p>A white body shot up and clung for a moment to the pommel of my
saddle, green eyes glaring into mine, red mouth' slavering. I took
a quick glance back. The wolf pack was rushing down upon me, Lur at
their heels. Again the wolf leaped. But by this time I had drawn my
sword. I thrust it through the white wolf's throat. Another leaped,
tearing a strip from my tunic. I held the little man high up in one
arm and thrust again.</p>

<p>Now the river was close. And now I was on its bank. I lifted the
little man in both hands and hurled him far out into the water.</p>

<p>I turned, both swords in hand, to meet the charge of the
wolves.</p>

<p>I heard another cry from Lur. The wolves stopped in their rush,
so suddenly that the foremost of them slid and rolled. I looked
over the river. Far out on it was the head of the little man, long
hair floating behind him, streaking for the opposite shore.</p>

<p>Lur rode up to me. Her face was white, and her eyes were hard as
blue jewels. She said in a strangled voice:</p>

<p>"Why did you save him?"</p>

<p>I considered that, gravely. I said:</p>

<p>"Because not twice would I see hope die in the eyes of one who
trusts me."</p>

<p>She watched me, steadily; and the white-hot anger did not
abate.</p>

<p>"You have broken the wings of my falcon, Dwayanu."</p>

<p>"Which do you love best. Witch-woman&mdash;its wing or my
eyes?"</p>

<p>"You have killed two of my wolves."</p>

<p>"Two wolves&mdash;or my throat, Lur?"</p>

<p>She did not answer. She rode slowly back to her women. But I had
seen tears in her eyes before she turned. They might have been of
rage&mdash;or they might not. But it was the first time I had ever
seen Lur weep.</p>

<p>With never a word to each other we rode back to Karak&mdash;she
nursing the wounded falcon, I thinking over what I had seen on the
cliffs of Sirk.</p>

<p>We did not stop at Karak. I had a longing for the quiet and
beauty of the Lake of the Ghosts. I told Lur that. She assented
indifferently, so we went straight on and came to it just as the
twilight was thickening. With the women, we dined together in the
great hall. Lur had shaken off her moodiness. If she still felt
wrath toward me, she hid it well. We were merry and I drank much
wine. The more I drank the clearer became my plan for the taking of
Sirk. It was a good plan. After a while, I went up with Lur to her
tower and watched the waterfall and the beckoning mist wraiths, and
the plan became clearer still.</p>

<p>Then my mind turned back to that matter of Khalk'ru. And I
thought over that a long while. I looked up and found Lur's gaze
intent upon me.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking, Dwayanu?"</p>

<p>"I am thinking that never again will I summon Khalk'ru."</p>

<p>She said, slowly, incredulously:</p>

<p>"You cannot mean that, Dwayanu!"</p>

<p>"I do mean it."</p>

<p>Her face whitened. She said:</p>

<p>"If Khalk'ru is not offered his Sacrifice, he will withdraw life
from this land. It will become desert, as did the Motherland when
the Sacrifices were ended."</p>

<p>I said:</p>

<p>"Will it? That is what I have ceased to believe. Nor do I think
you believe it, Lur. In the olden days there was land upon land
which did not acknowledge Khalk'ru, whose people did not sacrifice
to Khalk'ru&mdash;yet they were not desert. And I know, even though
I do not know how I know, that there is land upon land to-day where
Khalk'ru is not worshipped&mdash;yet life teems in them. Even
here&mdash;the Rrrllya, the Little People, do not worship him. They
hate him&mdash;or so you have told me&mdash;yet the land over Nanbu
is no less fertile than here."</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>"That was the whisper that went through the Motherland, long and
long and long ago. It became louder&mdash;and the Motherland became
desert."</p>

<p>"There might have been other reasons than Khalk'ru's wrath for
that, Lur."</p>

<p>"What were they?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," I said. "But you have never seen the sun and
moon and stars. I have seen them. And a wise old man once told me
that beyond sun and moon were other suns with other earths circling
them, and upon them&mdash; life. The Spirit of the Void in which
burn these suns should be too vast to shrink itself to such
littleness as that which, in a little temple in this little comer
of all earth, makes itself manifest to us."</p>

<p>She answered:</p>

<p>"Khalk'ru is! Khalk'ru is everywhere. He is in the tree that
withers, the spring that dries. Every heart is open to him. He
touches it&mdash;and there comes weariness of life, hatred of life,
desire for eternal death. He touches earth and there is sterile
sand where meadows grew; the flocks grow barren. Khalk'ru is."</p>

<p>I thought over that, and I thought it was true enough. But there
was a flaw in her argument.</p>

<p>"Nor do I deny that, Lur," I answered. "The Enemy of Life is.
But is what comes to the ritual of the ring&mdash;Khalk'ru?"</p>

<p>"What else? So it has been taught from ancient days."</p>

<p>"I do not know what else. And many things have been taught from
ancient days which would not stand the test. But I do not believe
that which comes is Khalk'ru, Soul of the Void,
He-To-Whom-All-Life-Must-Return and all the rest of his titles. Nor
do I believe that if we end the Sacrifices life will end here with
them."</p>

<p>She said, very quietly:</p>

<p>"Hear me, Dwayanu. Whether that which comes to the Sacrifices be
Khalk'ru or another matters not at all to me. All that matters is
this: I do not want to leave this land, and I would keep it
unchanged. I have been happy here. I have seen the sun and moon and
stars. I have seen the outer earth in my waterfall yonder. I would
not go into it. Where would I find a place so lovely as this my
Lake of the Ghosts? If the Sacrifices end, they whom only fear
keeps here will go. They will be followed by more and more. The old
life I love ends with the Sacrifices&mdash;surely. For if
desolation comes, we shall be forced to go. And if it does not
come, the people will know that they have been taught lies, and
will go to see whether what is beyond be not fairer, happier, than
here. So it has always been. I say to you, Dwayanu &mdash;it shall
not be here!"</p>

<p>She waited for me to answer. I did not answer.</p>

<p>"If you do not wish to summon Khalk'ru, then why not choose
another in your place?"</p>

<p>I looked at her sharply. I was not ready to go quite that far as
yet. Give up the ring, with all its power!</p>

<p>"There is another reason, Dwayanu, than those you have given me.
What is it?"</p>

<p>I said, bluntly:</p>

<p>"There are many who call me feeder of Khalk'ru. Butcher for him.
I do not like that. Nor do I like to see&mdash;what I see&mdash;in
the eyes of the women I feed him."</p>

<p>"So that is it," she said, contemptuously. "Sleep has made you
soft, Dwayanu! Better tell me your plan to take Sirk and let me
carry it out! You have grown too tender-hearted for war, I
think!"</p>

<p>That stung me, swept all my compunctions away. I jumped up,
knocking away the chair, half-raised my hand to strike her. She
faced me, boldly, no trace of fear in her eyes. I dropped my
hand.</p>

<p>"But not so soft that you can mould me to your will, Witch," I
said. "Nor do I go back on my bargains. I have given you Yodin. I
shall give you Sirk, and all else I have promised. Till
then&mdash;let this matter of the Sacrifices rest When shall I give
you Tibur?"</p>

<p>She put her hands on my shoulders and smiled into my angry eyes.
She clasped her hands around my neck and brought my lips down to
her warm red ones.</p>

<p>"Now," she whispered, "you are Dwayanu! Now the one I
love&mdash;ah, Dwayanu, if you but loved me as I love you!"</p>

<p>Well, as for that, I loved her as much as I could any
woman...After all, there was none like her. I swung her up and held
her tight, and the old recklessness, the old love of life poured
through me.</p>

<p>"You shall have Sirk! And Tibur when you will."</p>

<p>She seemed to consider.</p>

<p>"Not yet," she said. "He is strong, and he has his followers. He
will be useful at Sirk, Dwayanu. Not before then&mdash;surely."</p>

<p>"It was precisely what I was thinking," I said. "On one thing at
least we agree."</p>

<p>"Let us have wine upon our peace," she said, and called to her
serving- women.</p>

<p>"But there is another thing also upon which we agree." She
looked at me strangely.</p>

<p>"What is it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You yourself have said it," she answered&mdash;and more than
that I could not get her to say. It was long before I knew what she
had meant, and then it was too late...</p>

<p>It was good wine. I drank more than I should have. But clearer
and clearer grew my plan for the taking of Sirk.</p>

<p>It was late next morning when I awoke. Lur was gone. I had slept
as though drugged. I had the vaguest memory of what had occurred
the night before, except that Lur and I had violently disagreed
about something. I thought of Khalk'ru not at all. I asked Ouarda
where Lur had gone. She said that word had been brought early that
two women set apart for the next Sacrifice had managed to escape.
Lur thought they were making their way to Sirk. She was hunting
them with the wolves. I felt irritated that she had not roused me
and taken me with her. I thought that I would like to see those
white brutes of hers in action. They were like the great dogs we
had used in Ayjirland to track similar fugitives.</p>

<p>I did not go into Karak. I spent the day at sword-play and
wrestling, and swimming in the Lake of the Ghosts&mdash;after my
headache had worn off.</p>

<p>Close toward nightfall Lur returned.</p>

<p>"Did you catch them?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No," she said. "They got to Sirk safely. We were just in time
to see them half-across the drawbridge."</p>

<p>I thought she was rather indifferent about it, but gave the
matter no further thought. And that night she was gay&mdash;and
most tender toward me. Sometimes so tender that I seemed to detect
another emotion in her kisses. It seemed to me that they
were&mdash;regretful. And I gave that no thought then either.</p>

<br>

<h2><a name="chap19" id="chap19"></a>19. &mdash; THE TAKING OF
SIRK</h2>

<p class="first">Again I rode through the forest toward Sirk, with
Lur at my left hand and Tibur beside her. At my back were my two
captains, Dara and Naral. Close at our heels came Ouarda, with
twelve slim, strong girls, fair skins stained strangely green and
black, and naked except for a narrow belt around their waists.
Behind these rode four score of the nobles with Tibur's friend
Rascha at their head. And behind them marched silently a full
thousand of Karak's finest fighting women.</p>

<p>It was night. It was essential to reach the edge of the forest
before the last third of the stretch between midnight and dawn. The
hoofs of the horses were muffled so that no sharp ears might hear
their distant tread, and the soldiers marched in open formation,
noiselessly. Five days had passed since I had first looked on the
fortress.</p>

<p>They had been five days of secret, careful preparation. Only the
Witch- woman and the Smith knew what I had in mind. Secret as we
had been, the rumor had spread that we were preparing for a sortie
against the Rrrllya. I was well content with that. Not until we had
gathered to start did even Rascha, or so I believed, know that we
were headed toward Sirk. This so no word might be carried there to
put them on guard, for I knew well that those we menaced had many
friends in Karak&mdash;might have them among the ranks that slipped
along behind us. Surprise was the essence of my plan. Therefore the
muffling of the horses' hoofs. Therefore the march by night.
Therefore the silence as we passed through the forest. And
therefore it was that when we heard the first howling of Lur's
wolves the Witch-woman slipped from her horse and disappeared in
the luminous green darkness.</p>

<p>We halted, awaiting her return. None spoke; the howls were
stilled; she came from the trees and remounted. Like well-trained
dogs the white wolves spread ahead of us, nosing over the ground we
still must travel, ruthless scouts which no spy nor chance
wanderer, whether from or to Sirk, could escape.</p>

<p>I had desired to strike sooner than this, had chafed at the
delay, had been reluctant to lay bare my plan to Tibur. But Lur had
pointed out that if the Smith were to be useful at Sirk's taking he
would have to be trusted, and that he would be less dangerous if
informed and eager than if uninformed and suspicious. Well, that
was true. And Tibur was a first-class fighting man with strong
friends.</p>

<p>So I had taken him into my confidence and told him what I had
observed when first I had stood with Lur beside Sirk's boiling
moat&mdash;the vigorously growing clumps of ferns which extended in
an almost unbroken, irregular line high up and across the black
cliff, from the forest on the hither side and over the
geyser-spring, and over the parapets. It betrayed, I believed, a
slipping or cracking of the rock which had formed a ledge. Along
that ledge, steady-nerved, sure-footed climbers might creep, and
make their way unseen into the fortress&mdash;and there do for us
what I had in mind.</p>

<p>Tibur's eyes had sparkled, and he had laughed as I had not heard
him laugh since my ordeal by Khalk'ru. He had made only one
comment.</p>

<p>"The first link of your chain is the weakest, Dwayanu."</p>

<p>"True enough. But it is forged where Sirk's chain of defence is
weakest."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless&mdash;I would not care to be the first to test
that link."</p>

<p>For all my lack of trust, I had warmed to him for that touch of
frankness.</p>

<p>"Thank the gods for your weight then, Anvil-smiter," I had said.
"I cannot see those feet of yours competing for toe-holds with
ferns. Otherwise I might have picked you."</p>

<p>I had looked down at the sketch I had drawn to make the matter
clearer.</p>

<p>"We must strike quickly. How long before we can be in readiness,
Lur?"</p>

<p>I had raised my eyes in time to see a swift glance pass between
the two. Whatever suspicion I may have felt had been fleeting. Lur
had answered, quickly.</p>

<p>"So far as the soldiers are concerned, we could start to-night.
How long it will take to pick the climbers, I cannot tell. Then I
must test them. All that will take time."</p>

<p>"How long, Lur? We must be swift."</p>

<p>"Three days&mdash;five days&mdash;I will be swift as may be.
Beyond that I will not promise."</p>

<p>With that I had been forced to be content. And now, five nights
later, we marched on Sirk. It was neither dark nor light in the
forest; a strange dimness floated over us; the glimmer of the
flowers was our torch. All the fragrances were of life. But it was
death whose errand we were on.</p>

<p>The weapons of the soldiers were covered so that there could be
no betraying glints; spear-heads darkened&mdash;no shining of metal
upon any of us. On the tunics of the soldiers was the Wheel of
Luka, so that friend would not be mistaken for foe once we were
behind the walls of Sirk. Lur had wanted the Black Symbol of
Khalk'ru.</p>

<p>I would not have it. We reached the spot where we had decided to
leave the horses. And here in silence our force separated. Under
leadership of Tibur and Rascha, the others crept through wood and
fern-brake to the edge of the clearing opposite the drawbridge.</p>

<p>With the Witch-woman and myself went a scant dozen of the
nobles, Ouarda with the naked girls, a hundred of the soldiers.
Each of these had bow and quiver in well-protected cases on their
backs. They carried the short battleaxe, long sword and dagger.
They bore the long, wide rope ladder I had caused to be made, like
those I had used long and long ago to meet problems similar to this
of Sirk&mdash;but none with its peculiarly forbidding aspects. They
carried another ladder, long and flexible and of wood. I was armed
only with battleaxe and long sword, Lur and the nobles with the
throwing hammers and swords.</p>

<p>We stole toward the torrent whose hissing became louder with
each step.</p>

<p>Suddenly I halted, drew Lur to me.</p>

<p>"Witch-woman, can you truly talk to your wolves?"</p>

<p>"Truly, Dwayanu."</p>

<p>"I am thinking it would be no bad plan to draw eyes and ears
from this end of the parapet. If some of your wolves would fight
and howl and dance a bit there at the far bastion for the amusement
of the guards, it might help us here."</p>

<p>She sent a low call, like the whimper of a she-wolf. Almost
instantly the head of the great dog-wolf which had greeted her on
our first ride lifted beside her. Its hackles bristled as it glared
at me. But it made no sound. The Witch-woman dropped to her knees
beside it, took its head in her arms, whispering. They seemed to
whisper together. And then as suddenly as it had appeared, it was
gone. Lur arose, in her eyes something of the green fire of the
wolf's.</p>

<p>"The guards shall have their amusement."</p>

<p>I felt a little shiver along my back, for this was true
witchcraft. But I said nothing and we went on. We came to that
place from which I had scanned the cliff. We parted the ferns and
peered out upon the fortress.</p>

<p>Thus it was. At our right, a score of paces away, soared the
sheer wall of the cliff which, continuing over the boiling torrent,
formed this nearer bastion. The cover in which we lurked ran up to
it, was thrown back like a green wave from its base. Between our
cover and the moat was a space not more than a dozen paces across,
made barren by the hot spray that fell on it. Here, the walls of
the fortress were not more than a javelin cast distant. The wall
and the parapet touched the cliff, but hardly could they be seen
through the thick veils of steam. And this was what I had meant
when I had said that our weakest link would be forged where Sirk's
defenses were weakest. For no sentinels stood at this corner. With
the heat and steam and exhalations from the geyser, there was no
need&mdash;or so they thought. How, here at its hottest source,
could the torrent be crossed? Who could scale that smooth and
dripping cliff? Of all the defenses, this spot was the impregnable
one, unnecessary to guard&mdash;or so they thought. Therefore it
was the exact point to attack&mdash;if it could be done.</p>

<p>I studied it. Not for full two hundred paces was there a single
sentinel. From somewhere behind the fortress came the glare of a
fire. It cast nickering shadows on the terraces of fallen rock
beyond the bastioning cliffs; and that was good, since if we gained
their shelter, we, too, would seem but flickering shadows. I
beckoned Ouarda, and pointed to the rocks which were to be the goal
of the naked girls. They were close to the cliff where it curved
inward beyond the parapet, and they were about the height of twenty
tall men above where we hid. She drew the girls to her and
instructed them. They nodded, their eyes dropping swiftly to the
cauldron of the moat, then turning to the glistening precipice. I
saw some of them shudder. Well, I could not hold that against them,
no!</p>

<p>We crept back and found the base of the cliff. Here were enough
and to spare of rock-holds for the grapnels of the ladder. We
unwound the rope ladder. We set the wooden ladder against the
cliff. I pointed out the ledge that might be the key to Sirk,
counselled the climbers as best I could. I knew that the ledge
could not be much wider than the span of a hand. Yet above it and
below it were small crevices, pockets, where fingers and toes could
grip, for clumps of ferns sprouted there.</p>

<p>Hai! But they had courage, those slim girls. We fastened to
their belts long strong cords which would slip through our hands as
they crept along. And they looked at one another's stained faces
and bodies and laughed. The first went up the ladder like a
squirrel, got foothold and handhold and began to edge across. In an
instant she had vanished, the green and black with which her body
was stained merging into the dim green and black of the cliff.
Slowly, slowly, the first cord slipped through my fingers.</p>

<p>Another followed her, and another, until I held six cords. And
now the others climbed up and crept out on the perilous path, their
leashes held in the strong hands of the Witch-woman.</p>

<p>Hai! But that was queer fishing! With will strained toward
keeping these girl-fish out of water! Slowly&mdash;Gods, but how
slowly&mdash;the cords crept through my fingers! Through the
fingers of the Witch-woman...slowly... slowly...but ever on and
on.</p>

<p>Now that first slim girl must be over the cauldron...I had swift
vision of her clinging to the streaming rock, the steam of the
cauldron clothing her...</p>

<p>That line slackened in my hand. It slackened, then ran out so
swiftly that it cut the skin...slackened again...a tug upon it as
of a great fish racing away...I felt the line snap. The girl had
fallen! Was now dissolving flesh in the cauldron!</p>

<p>The second cord slackened and tugged and snapped...and the
third...Three of them gone! I whispered to Lur:</p>

<p>"Three are gone!"</p>

<p>"And two!" she said. I saw that her eyes were tightly closed,
but the hands that clutched the cords were steady.</p>

<p>Five of those slim girls! Only seven left! Luka&mdash;spin your
wheel!</p>

<p>On and on, slowly, with many a halt, the remaining cords crept
through my fingers. Now the fourth girl must be over the
moat...must be over the parapet...must be well on her way to the
rocks...my heart beat in my throat, half-strangling
me...Gods&mdash;the sixth had fallen! "Another!" I groaned to Lur.
"And another!" she whispered, and cast the end of a cord from her
hand.</p>

<p>Five left...only five now...Luka, a temple to you in
Karak&mdash;all your own, sweet goddess!</p>

<p>What was that? A pull upon a cord, and twice repeated! The
signal! One had crossed! Honor and wealth to you, slim girl...</p>

<p>"All gone but one, Dwayanu!" whispered the Witch-woman.</p>

<p>I groaned again, and glared at her...Again the
twitches&mdash;upon my fifth cord! Another safe! "My last is over!"
whispered Lur. Three safe! Three hidden among the rocks. The
fishing was done. Sirk had stolen three-fourths of my bait.</p>

<p>But Sirk was hooked!</p>

<p>Weakness like none I had known melted bones and muscles. Lur's
face was white as chalk, black shadows under staring eyes.</p>

<p>Well, now it was our turn. The slim maids who had fallen might
soon have company!</p>

<p>I took the cord from Lur. Sent the signal. Felt it answered.</p>

<p>We cut the cords, and knotted their ends to heavier strands. And
when they had run out we knotted to their ends a stronger, slender
rope.</p>

<p>It crept away&mdash;and away&mdash;and away&mdash;</p>

<p>And now for the ladder&mdash;the bridge over which we must
go.</p>

<p>It was light but strong, that ladder. Woven cunningly in a way
thought out long and long ago. It had claws at each end which, once
they had gripped, were not easily opened.</p>

<p>We fastened that ladder's end to the slender rope. It slipped
away from us...over the ferns...out into the hot breath of the
cauldron...through it.</p>

<p>Invisible within that breath...invisible against the green dusk
of the cliff...on and on it crept...</p>

<p>The three maids had it! They were making it fast. Under my hands
it straightened and stiffened. We drew it taut from our end. We
fastened our grapnels.</p>

<p>The road to Sirk was open!</p>

<p>I turned to the Witch-woman. She stood, her gaze far and far
away. In her eyes was the green fire of her wolves. And suddenly
over the hissing of the torrent, I beard the howling of her
wolves&mdash;far and far away.</p>

<p>She relaxed; her head dropped; she smiled at
me&mdash;"Yes&mdash;truly can I talk to my wolves, Dwayanu!"</p>

<p>I walked to the ladder, tested it. It was strong, secure.</p>

<p>"I go first, Lur. Let none follow me until I have crossed. Then
do you, Dara and Naral, climb to guard my back."</p>

<p>Lur's eyes blazed.</p>

<p>"I follow you. Your captains come after me."</p>

<p>I considered that. Well&mdash;let it be.</p>

<p>"As you say, Lur. But do not follow until I have crossed. Then
let Ouarda send the soldiers. Ouarda&mdash;not more than ten may be
on the ladder at a time. Bind cloths over their mouths and nostrils
before they start Count thirty&mdash;slowly, like this&mdash;before
each sets forth behind the other. Fasten axe and sword between my
shoulders, Lur. See to it that all bear their weapons so. Watch
now, how I use my hands and feet."</p>

<p>I swung upon the ladder, arms and legs opened wide. I began to
climb it. Like a spider. Slowly, so they could learn. The ladder
swayed but little; its angle was a good one.</p>

<p>And now I was above the fern-brake. And now I was at the edge of
the torrent. Above it. The stream swirled round me. It hid me. The
hot breath of the geyser shrivelled me. Nor could I see anything of
the ladder except the strands beneath me...</p>

<p>Thank Luka for that! If what was before me was hidden&mdash;so
was I hidden from what was before me!</p>

<p>I was through the steam. I had passed the cliff. I was above the
parapet. I dropped from the ladder, among the rocks&mdash;unseen. I
shook the ladder. There was a quivering response. There was weight
upon it...more weight... and more...</p>

<p>I unstrapped axe and sword&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dwayanu&mdash;"</p>

<p>I turned. There were the three maids. I began to praise
them&mdash; holding back laughter. Green and black had run and
combined under bath of steam into grotesque pattern.</p>

<p>"Nobles you are, maids! From this moment! Green and black your
colors. What you have done this night will long be a tale in
Karak."</p>

<p>I looked toward the battlements. Between us and them was a
smooth floor of rock and sand, less than half a bow-shot wide. A
score of soldiers stood around the fire. There was a larger group
on the parapet close to the towers of the bridge. There were more
at the farther end of the parapet, looking at the wolves.</p>

<p>The towers of the drawbridge ran straight down to the rocky
floor. The tower at the left was blank wall. The tower at the right
had a wide gate. The gate was open, unguarded, unless the soldiers
about the fire were its guards. Down from between the towers
dropped a wide ramp, the approach to the bridge- head.</p>

<p>There was a touch on my arm. Lur was beside me. And close after
her came my two captains. After them, one by one, the soldiers. I
bade them string bows, set arrows. One by one they melted out of
the green darkness, slipped by me. They made ready in the shadow of
the rocks.</p>

<p>One score&mdash;two score...a shriek cut like an arrow through
the hissing of the torrent! The ladder trembled. It shook&mdash;and
twisted... Again the despairing cry...the ladder fell slack!</p>

<p>"Dwayanu&mdash;the ladder is broken? At&mdash;Ouarda&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quiet, Lur! They may have heard that shrieking. The ladder
could not break..."</p>

<p>"Draw it in, Dwayanu&mdash;draw it in!"</p>

<p>Together we pulled upon it. It was heavy. We drew it in like a
net, and swiftly. And suddenly it was of no weight at all. It
rushed into our hands&mdash;</p>

<p>Its ends were severed as though by knife slash or axe blow.</p>

<p>"Treachery!" I said.</p>

<p>"But treachery...how...with Ouarda on guard."</p>

<p>I crept, crouching, behind the shadow of the rocks.</p>

<p>"Dara&mdash;spread out the soldiers. Tell Naral to slip to the
farther end. On the signal, let them loose their arrows. Three
flights only. The first at those around the fire. The second and
the third at those on the walls closest to the towers. Then follow
me. You understand me?"</p>

<p>"It is understood. Lord."</p>

<p>The word went along the line; I heard the bowstrings
whisper.</p>

<p>"We are fewer than I like, Lur&mdash;yet nothing for us but to
go through with it. No way out of Sirk now but the way of the
sword."</p>

<p>"I know. It is of Ouarda I am thinking..." Her voice
trembled.</p>

<p>"She is safe. If treachery had been wide-spread, we would have
heard sounds of fighting. No more talking, Lur. We must move
swiftly. After the third arrow flight, we rush the tower gate."</p>

<p>I gave the signal. Up rose the archers. Straight upon those
around the fire flew their shafts. They left few alive. Instantly
upon those around the towers of the bridge whistled a second arrow
storm.</p>

<p>Hai! But that was straight shooting! See them fall! Once
more&mdash;</p>

<p>Whistle of feathered shaft! Song of the bow-string I
Gods&mdash;but this is to live again!</p>

<p>I dropped down the rocks, Lur beside me. The soldier women
poured after us. Straight to the tower door we sped. We were
half-way there before those upon the long parapet awakened.</p>

<p>Shouts rang. Trumpets blared, and the air was filled with the
brazen clangor of a great gong bellowing the alarm to Sirk asleep
behind the gap. We sped on. Javelins dropped among us, arrows
whistled. From other gates along the inner walls guards began to
emerge, racing to intercept us.</p>

<p>We were at the door of the bridge towers&mdash;and through
it!</p>

<p>But not all. A third had fallen under javelin and arrow. We
swung the stout door shut. We dropped across it the massive bars
that secured it. And not an instant too soon. Upon the door began
to beat the sledges of the tricked guards.</p>

<p>The chamber was of stone, huge and bare. Except for the door
through which we had come, there was no opening. I saw the reason
for that&mdash;never had Sirk expected to be attacked from within.
There were arrow slits high up, looking over the moat, and
platforms for archers. At one side were cogs and levers which
raised and lowered the bridge.</p>

<p>All this I took in at one swift glance. I leaped over to the
levers, began to manipulate them. The cogs revolved.</p>

<p>The bridge was falling!</p>

<p>The Witch-woman ran up to the platform of the archers; she
peered out; set horn to lips; she sent a long call through the
arrow slit&mdash;summoning signal for Tibur and his host.</p>

<p>The hammering against the door had ceased. The blows against it
were stronger, more regular&mdash;timed. The battering of a ram.
The stout wood trembled under them; the bars groaned, Lur called to
me:</p>

<p>"The bridge is down, Dwayanu! Tibur is rushing upon it. It grows
lighter. Dawn is breaking. They have brought their horses!"</p>

<p>I cursed.</p>

<p>"Luka, sent him wit not to pound across that bridge on
horse!"</p>

<p>"He is doing it...he and Rascha and a handful of others
only...the rest are dismounting..."</p>

<p>"Hai&mdash;they are shooting at them from the arrow slits...the
javelins rain among them...Sirk takes toll..."</p>

<p>There was a thunderous crash against the door. The wood
split...</p>

<p>A roaring tumult. Shouts and battle cries. Ring of sword upon
sword and the swish of arrows. And over it all the laughter of
Tibur.</p>

<p>No longer was the ram battering at the door.</p>

<p>I threw up the bars, raised axe in readiness, opened the great
gate a finger's breadth and peered out.</p>

<p>The soldiers of Karak were pouring down the ramp from the
bridge-head.</p>

<p>I opened the door wider. The dead of the fortress lay thick
around tower base and bridge-head.</p>

<p>I stepped through the door. The soldiers saw me.</p>

<p>"Dwayanu!" rang their shout.</p>

<p>From the fortress still came the clamor of the great
gong&mdash;warning Sirk.</p>

<p>Sirk&mdash;no longer sleeping!</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap20" id="chap20"></a>20. &mdash;
"TSANTAWU&mdash;FAREWELL!"</h2>

<p class="first">There was a humming as of a disturbed gigantic
hive beyond Sirk's gap. Trumpet blasts and the roll of drums. Clang
of brazen gongs answering that lonely one which beat from the
secret heart of the raped fortress. And ever Karak's women-warriors
poured over the bridge until the space behind the fortress filled
with them.</p>

<p>The Smith wheeled his steed&mdash;faced me.</p>

<p>"Gods&mdash;Tibur! But that was well done!"</p>
"Never done but for you, Dwayanu! You saw, you knew&mdash;you did.
Ours the least part."

<p>Well, that was true. But I was close to liking Tibur then. Life
of my blood! It had been no play to lead that charge against the
bridge end. The Smith was a soldier! Let him be only half loyal to
me&mdash;and Khalk'ru take the Witch-woman!</p>

<p>"Sweep the fortress clean, Anvil-smiter. We want no arrows at
our backs."</p>

<p>"It is being swept, Dwayanu."</p>

<p>By brooms of sword and spear, by javelin and arrow, the fortress
was swept dean.</p>

<p>The clamor of the brazen gong died on a part stroke.</p>

<p>My stallion rested his nose on my shoulder, blew softly against
my ear.</p>

<p>"You did not forget my horse! My hand to you, Tibur!"</p>

<p>"You lead the charge, Dwayanu!" I leaped upon the stallion.
Battleaxe held high, I wheeled and galloped toward the gap. Like
the point of a spear I sped, Tibur at my left, the Witch-woman at
my right, the nobles behind us, the soldiers sweeping after us.</p>

<p>We hurled ourselves through the cliffed portal of Sirk.</p>

<p>A living wave lifted itself to throw us back. Hammers flew, axes
hewed, javelins and spears and feathered shafts sleeted us. My
horse tottered and dropped, screaming, his hinder hocks cut
through. I felt a hand upon my shoulder, dragging me to my feet.
The Witch-woman smiled at me. She sliced with her sword the arm
drawing me down among the dead. With axe and sword we cleared a
ring around us. I threw myself on the back of a gray from which a
noble had fallen, bristling with arrows.</p>

<p>We thrust forward against the living wave. It gave, curling
round us.</p>

<p>On and on! Cut sword and hew axe! Cut and slash and batter
through!</p>

<p>The curling wave that tore at us was beaten down. We were
through the gap. Sirk lay before us.</p>

<p>I reined in my horse. Sirk lay before us&mdash;but too
invitingly!</p>

<p>The city nestled in a hollow between sheer, unscalable black
walls. The lip of the gap was higher than the roof of the houses.
They began an arrow flight away. It was a fair city. There was no
citadel nor forts; there were no temples nor palaces. Only houses
of stone, perhaps a thousand of them, flat roofed, set wide apart,
gardens around them, a wide street straying among them,
tree-bordered. There were many lanes. Beyond the city fertile field
upon field, and flowering orchards.</p>

<p>And no battle ranks arrayed against us. The way open.</p>

<p>Too open!</p>

<p>I caught the glint of arms on the housetops. There was the noise
of axes above the blaring of trumpets and the roll of the
kettle-drums.</p>

<p>Hai! They were barricading the wide street with their trees,
preparing a hundred ambushes for us, expecting us to roll down in
force.</p>

<p>Spreading the net in the sight of Dwayanu!</p>

<p>Yet they were good tactics. The best defence. I had met with it
in many a war against the barbarians. It meant we must fight for
every step, with every house a fort, with arrows searching for us
from every window and roof. They had a leader here in Sirk, to
arrange such reception on such brief notice! I had respect for that
leader, whoever he might be. He had picked the only possible way to
victory&mdash;unless those against whom he fought knew the
countermove.</p>

<p>And that, hard earned, I did know.</p>

<p>How long could this leader keep Sirk within its thousand forts?
There, always, lay the danger in this defence. The overpowering
impulse of a pierced city is to swarm out upon its invaders as ants
and bees do from their hills and nests. Not often is there a leader
strong enough to hold them back. If each house of Sirk could remain
linked to the other, each ever an active part of the
whole&mdash;then Sirk might be unconquerable. But how, when they
began to be cut off, one by one? Isolated? The leader's will
severed?</p>

<p>Hai! Then it is that despair creeps through every chink! They
are drawn out by fury and despair as though by ropes. They pour
out&mdash;to kill or to be killed. The cliff crumbles, stone by
stone. The cake is eaten by the attackers, crumb by crumb.</p>

<p>I divided our soldiers, and sent the first part against Sirk in
small squads, with orders to spread and to take advantage of all
cover. They were to take the outer fringe of houses, at all costs,
shooting their arrows up in the high curved flight against the
defenders while others hammered their way into those houses. Still
others were to attack farther on, but never getting too far from
their comrades nor from the broad way running through the city.</p>

<p>I was casting a net over Sirk and did not want its meshes
broken.</p>

<p>By now it was broad daylight.</p>

<p>The soldiers moved forward. I saw the arrows stream up and down,
twisting among each other like serpents...I heard the axe-blows on
the doors...By Luka! There floats a banner of Karak from one of the
roofs! And another.</p>

<p>The hum of Sirk shot higher, became louder, in it a note of
madness. Hai! I knew they could not long stand this nibbling! And I
knew that sound! Soon it would rise to frenzy. Drone from that into
despair!</p>

<p>Hai! Not long now before they came tumbling out...</p>

<p>Tibur was cursing at my elbow. I looked at Lur, and she was
trembling. The soldiers were murmuring, straining at the leash, mad
to join battle. I looked at their blue eyes, hard and cold; their
faces beneath the helmet-caps were not those of women but of young
warriors...those who sought in them for woman's mercy would have
rude awakening!</p>

<p>"By Zarda! But the fight will be done before we can dip blade!"
I laughed.</p>

<p>"Patience, Tibur! Patience is our strong weapon. Sirk's
strongest&mdash; if they but knew it. Let them be first to lose
that weapon."</p>

<p>The turmoil grew louder. At the head of the street appeared half
a hundred of Karak's soldiers, struggling against more than equal
number which steadily, swiftly, was swelled by others of Sirk
pouring from side lanes and dropping from roofs and windows of the
beleaguered houses.</p>

<p>It was the moment for which I had waited!</p>

<p>I gave the command. I raised the battle-cry. We drove down upon
them. Our skirmishers opened to let us through, melting into the
shouting ranks behind. We ripped into the defenders of Sirk. Down
they went, but as they fell they fought, and many a saddle of the
nobles was empty, and many were the steeds lost before we won to
the first barricade.</p>

<p>Hai! But how they fought us there from behind the hastily felled
trees &mdash;women and men and children hardly big enough to bend
the bow or wield the knife!</p>

<p>Now the soldiers of Karak began to harry them from the sides;
the soldiers of Karak shot into them from the tops of the houses
they had abandoned; we fought Sirk as it had planned to fight us.
And those who fought against us soon broke and fled, and we were
over the barricade. Battling, we reached the heart of Sirk, a great
and lovely square in which fountains played and flowers blossomed.
The spray of the fountains was crimson and there were no flowers
when we left that square.</p>

<p>We paid heavy toll there. Full half of the nobles were slain. A
spear had struck my helmet and well-nigh dropped me. Bare-headed,
blood-flecked I rode, shouting, sword dripping red. Naral and Dara
both bore wounds, but still guarded my back. The Witch-woman, and
the Smith and his scarred familiar fought on, untouched.</p>

<p>There was a thunder of hoofs. Down upon us swept a wave of
horsemen. We raced toward them. We struck like two combers. Surged
up. Mingled. Flash swords! Hammers smite! Axes cleave! Hai! But now
it was hand-to-hand in the way I knew best and best loved!</p>

<p>We swirled in a mad whirlpool. I glanced at right and saw the
Witch-woman had been separated from me. Tibur, too, was gone. Well,
they were giving good account of themselves no doubt&mdash;wherever
they were.</p>

<p>I swung to right and to left with my sword. In the front of
those who fought us, over the caps of Karak which had swirled
between us, was a dark face...a dark face whose black eyes looked
steadily into mine&mdash; steadily...steadily. At the shoulder of
that man was a slighter figure whose clear, brown eyes stared at
me...steadily...steadily. In the black eyes was understanding and
sorrow. The brown eyes were filled with hate.</p>

<p>Black eyes and brown eyes touched something deep and deep within
me... They were rousing that something...calling to it...something
that had been sleeping.</p>

<p>I heard my own voice shouting command to cease fighting, and at
that shout abruptly all sound of battle close by was stilled. Sirk
and Karak alike stood silent, amazed, staring at me. I thrust my
horse through the press of bodies, looked deep into the black
eyes.</p>

<p>And wondered why I had dropped my sword...why I stood thus...and
why the sorrow in those eyes racked my heart...The dark-faced man
spoke&mdash;two words&mdash;</p>

<p>"Leif!...Degataga!"</p>

<p>That something which had been asleep was wide awake, rushing up
through me...rocking my brain...tearing at it...shaking every
nerve...</p>

<p>I heard a cry&mdash;the voice of the Witch-woman.</p>

<p>A horse burst through the ring of the soldiers. Upon it was
Rascha, lips drawn back over his teeth, cold eyes glaring into
mine. His arm came up. His dagger gleamed, and was hidden in the
back of the man who had called me &mdash;Degataga!</p>

<p>Had called me&mdash;</p>

<p>God&mdash;but I knew him I</p>

<p>Tsantawu! Jim!</p>

<p>The sleeping thing that had awakened was all awake...it had my
brain... it was myself...Dwayanu forgotten!</p>

<p>I threw my horse forward.</p>

<p>Rascha's arm was up for second stroke&mdash;the brown-eyed rider
was swinging at him with sword, and Jim was falling, settling over
his horse's mane.</p>

<p>I caught Rascha's arm before the dagger could descend again. I
caught his arm, bent it back, and heard the bone snap. He
howled&mdash;like a wolf.</p>

<p>A hammer hummed by my head, missing it by a hair. I saw Tibur
drawing it back by its thong.</p>

<p>I leaned and lifted Rascha from his saddle. His sound arm swept
up, hand clutching at my throat. I caught the wrist and twisted
that arm back. I snapped it as I had the other.</p>

<p>My horse swerved. With one hand at Rascha's throat, the other
arm holding him, I toppled from the saddle bearing him down with
me. I fell upon him. I twisted, and threw him over the bar of my
knee. My hand slipped from his throat to his chest. My right leg
locked over his.</p>

<p>A swift downward thrust&mdash;a sound like the breaking of a
faggot. The Back-breaker would break no more backs. His own was
broken.</p>

<p>I leaped to my feet. Looked up into the face of the brown-eyed
rider... Evalie!...</p>

<p>I cried out to her&mdash;"Evalie!"</p>

<p>Abruptly, all about me the battle broke out afresh. Evalie
turned to meet the charge. I saw Tibur's great shoulders rise
behind her...saw him snatch her from her horse...saw from his left
hand a flash of light...It sped toward me...I was hurled aside.
None too soon&mdash;not soon enough&mdash;</p>

<p>Something caught me a glancing blow upon the side of my head. I
went down upon my knees and hands, blind and dizzy. I heard Tibur
laughing; I strove to conquer blind dizziness and nausea, felt
blood streaming down my face.</p>

<p>And crouching, swaying on knees and hands, heard the tide of
battle sweep around and over and past me.</p>

<p>My head steadied. The blindness was passing. I was still on my
hands and knees. Under me was the body of a man&mdash;a man whose
black eyes were fixed on mine with understanding&mdash;with
love!</p>

<p>I felt a touch on my shoulder; with difficulty I looked up. It
was Dara.</p>

<p>"A hair between life and death. Lord. Drink this."</p>

<p>She put a phial to my lips. The bitter, fiery liquid coursed
through me, brought steadiness, brought strength. I could see there
was a ring of soldier-women around me, guarding me&mdash;beyond
them a ring of others, on horses.</p>

<p>"Can you hear me, Leif?...I haven't much time..."</p>

<p>I lurched aside and knelt.</p>

<p>"Jim! Jim! Oh, God&mdash;why did you come here? Take this sword
and kill me!"</p>

<p>He reached for my hand, held it tight.</p>

<p>"Don't be a damned fool, Leif! You couldn't help it...but you've
got to save Evalie!"</p>

<p>"I've got to save you, Tsantawu&mdash;get you out of
here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up and listen. I've got mine, Leif, and I know it. That
blade went through the mail right into the lungs...I'm trickling
out&mdash;inside... hell, Leif&mdash;don't take it so hard...It
might have been in the war...It might have been any time...It's not
your fault..."</p>

<p>A sob shook me, tears mingled with the blood upon my face.</p>

<p>"But I killed him, Jim&mdash;I killed him!"</p>

<p>"I know, Leif...a neat job...I saw you...but there's something
I've got to tell you..." his voice faltered.</p>

<p>I put the phial to his lips&mdash;it brought him back.</p>

<p>"Just now...Evalie...hates you! You have to save
her...Leif...whether she does or not. Listen. Word came to us from
Sirk through the Little People that you wanted us to meet you
there. You were pretending to be Dwayanu... pretending to remember
nothing but Dwayanu...to allay suspicion and to gain power. You
were going to slip away...come to Sirk, and lead it against Karak.
You needed me to stand beside you...needed Evalie to persuade the
pygmies..."</p>

<p>"I sent you no message, Jim!" I groaned.</p>

<p>"I know you didn't&mdash;now...But we believed it...You saved
Sri from the wolves and defied the Witch-woman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jim&mdash;how long was it after Sri's escape that the lying
message came?"</p>

<p>"Two days...What does it matter? I'd told Evalie what
was&mdash;wrong &mdash;with you...gone over your story again and
again. She didn't understand...but she took me on faith...Some more
of that stuff, Leif... I'm going..."</p>

<p>Again the fiery draught revived him.</p>

<p>"We reached Sirk...two days ago...across the river with Sri and
twenty pygmies...it was easy...too easy...not a wolf howled,
although I knew the beasts were watching us...stalking us...and the
others did, too. We waited...then came the attack...and then I knew
we had been trapped...How did you get over those geysers...Big
Fellow...never mind...but...Evalie believes you sent the
message...you...black treachery..."</p>

<p>His eyes closed. Cold, cold were his hands.</p>

<p>"Tsantawu&mdash;brother&mdash;you do not believe!
Tsantawu&mdash; come back...speak to me..."</p>

<p>His eyes opened, but hardly could I hear him speak&mdash;</p>

<p>"You're not Dwayanu&mdash;Leif? Not now&mdash;or ever
again?"</p>

<p>"No, Tsantawu...don't leave me!"</p>

<p>"Bend...your head...closer, Leif...keep fighting...save
Evalie."</p>

<p>Fainter grew his voice:</p>

<p>"Good-bye...Degataga...not your fault..."</p>

<p>A ghost of the old sardonic smile passed over the white
face.</p>

<p>"You didn't pick your...damned...ancestors!...Worse luck...We've
had...hell of good times...together...Save...Evalie..."</p>

<p>There was a gush of blood from his mouth.</p>

<p>Jim was dead...was dead.</p>

<p>Tsantawu&mdash;no more I.</p>

<h2><a name="book4" id="book4">BOOK OF LEIF</a>
</h2>

<h2><a name="chap21" id="chap21"></a>21. &mdash; RETURN TO
KARAK</h2>

<p class="first">I leaned over Jim and kissed his forehead. I
arose. I was numb with sorrow. But under that numbness seethed a
tortured rage, a tortured horror. Deadly rage against the
Witch-woman and the Smith&mdash;horror of myself, of what I had
been...horror of&mdash;Dwayanu!</p>

<p>I must find Tibur and the Witch-woman&mdash;but first there was
something else to be done. They and Evalie could wait.</p>

<p>"Dara&mdash;have them lift him. Carry him into one of the
houses."</p>

<p>I followed on foot as they bore Jim away. There was fighting
still going on, but far from us. Here were only the dead. I guessed
that Sirk was making its last stand at the end of the valley.</p>

<p>Dara, Naral and I and half-dozen more passed through the broken
doors of what yesterday had been a pleasant home. In its center was
a little columned hall. The other soldiers clustered round the
broken doors, guarding entrance. I ordered chairs and beds and
whatever else would burn brought into the little hall and heaped
into a pyre. Dara said:</p>

<p>"Lord, let me bathe your wound."</p>

<p>I dropped upon a stool, sat thinking while she washed the gash
upon my head with stinging wine. Beyond the strange numbness, my
mind was very clear. I was Leif Langdon. Dwayanu was no longer
master of my mind&mdash;nor ever again would be. Yet he lived. He
lived within as part of&mdash;myself. It was as though the shock of
recognition of Jim had dissolved Dwayanu within Leif Langdon.</p>

<p>As though two opposing currents had merged into one; as though
two drops had melted into each other; as though two antagonistic
metals had fused.</p>

<p>Crystal clear was every memory of what I had heard and seen,
said and done and thought from the time I had been hurled from
Nansur Bridge. And crystal clear, agonizingly clear, was all that
had gone before. Dwayanu was not dead, no! But part of me, and I
was by far the stronger. I could use him, his strength, his
wisdom&mdash;but he could not use mine. I was in control. I was the
master.</p>

<p>And I thought, sitting there, that if I were to save
Evalie&mdash;if I were to do another thing that now I knew I would
do or die in the doing, I must still outwardly be all Dwayanu.
There lay my power. Not easily could such transmutation as I had
undergone be explained to my soldiers. They believed in me and
followed me as Dwayanu. If Evalie, who had known me as Leif, who
had loved me as Leif, who had listened to Jim, could not understand
&mdash;how much less could these? No, they must see no change.</p>

<p>I touched my head. The cut was deep and long; apparently only
the toughness of my skull had saved it from being split.</p>

<p>"Dara&mdash;you saw who made this wound?"</p>

<p>"It was Tibur, Lord."</p>

<p>"He tried to kill me...Why did he not finish?"</p>

<p>"Never yet has Tibur's left hand failed to deal death. He thinks
it cannot fail. He saw you fall&mdash;he thought you dead."</p>

<p>"And death missed me by a hair's-breadth. And would not, had not
someone hurled me aside. Was that you, Dara?"</p>

<p>"It was I, Dwayanu. I saw his hand dip into his girdle, knew
what was coming. I threw myself at your knees&mdash;so he could not
see me."</p>

<p>"Why, because you fear Tibur?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;because I wanted him to believe he did not miss."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"So that you would have better chance to kill Tibur, Lord. Your
strength was ebbing with your friend's life."</p>

<p>I looked sharply at this bold-eyed captain of mine. How much did
she know? Well, time later to find that out. I looked at the pyre.
It was nearly complete.</p>

<p>"What was it he threw, Dara?"</p>

<p>She drew from her girdle a curious weapon, one whose like I had
never seen. Its end was top-shaped, pointed like a dagger and with
four razor-edged ribs on its sides. It had an eight-inch metal
haft, round, like the haft of a diminutive javelin. It weighed
about five pounds. It was of some metal I did not
recognize&mdash;denser, harder than the finest of tempered steel.
It was, in effect, a casting knife. But no mail could turn aside
that adamantine point when hurled with the strength of one like the
Smith. Dara took it from me, and pulled the short shaft. Instantly
the edged ribs flew open, like flanges. The end of each was shaped
like an inverted barb. A devilish tool, if I ever saw one. Once
embedded, there was no way to get it out except cutting, and any
pull would release the flanges, hooking them at the same time into
the flesh. I took it back from Dara, and placed it in my own
girdle. If I had had any doubts about what I was going to do to
Tibur&mdash; I had none now.</p>

<p>The pyre was finished. I walked over to Jim, and laid him on it.
I kissed him on the eyes, and put a sword in his dead hand. I
stripped the room of its rich tapestries and draped them over him.
I struck flint and set flame to the pyre. The wood was dry and
resinous, and burned swiftly. I watched the flames creep up and up
until smoke and fire made a canopy over him.</p>

<p>Then dry-eyed, but with death in my heart. I walked out of that
house and among my soldiers.</p>

<p>Sirk had fallen and its sack was on. Smoke was rising everywhere
from the looted homes. A detachment of soldiers marched by, herding
along some two-score prisoners&mdash;women, all of them, and little
children; some bore the marks of wounds. And then I saw that among
those whom I had taken for children were a handful of the golden
pygmies. At sight of me the soldiers halted, stood rigid, staring
at me unbelievingly.</p>

<p>Suddenly one cried out..."Dwayanu! Dwayanu lives!"...They raised
their swords in salute, and from them came a shout..."Dwayanu!"</p>

<p>I beckoned their captain.</p>

<p>"Did you think Dwayanu dead then?"</p>

<p>"So ran the tale among us, Lord."</p>

<p>"And did this tale also tell how I was slain?"</p>

<p>She hesitated.</p>

<p>"There were some who said it was by the Lord Tibur...by
'accident'... that he had made cast at Sirk's leader who was
menacing you...and that you were struck instead...and that your
body had been borne away by those of Sirk...I do not know..."</p>

<p>"Enough, soldier. Go on to Karak with the captives. Do not
loiter, and do not speak of seeing me. It is a command. For a while
I let the tale stand."</p>

<p>They glanced at each other, oddly, saluted, and went on. The
yellow eyes of the pygmies, filled with a venomous hatred, never
left me until they had passed out of range. I waited, thinking. So
that was to be the story! Hai! But they had fear at their elbows or
they would not have troubled to spread that tale of accident!
Suddenly I made decision. No use to wander over Sirk searching for
Tibur. Folly to be seen, and have the counter-tale that Dwayanu
lived be borne to the ears of Tibur and Lur! They should come to
me&mdash; unknowing.</p>

<p>There was only one way out of Sirk, and that by the bridge. It
was there I would await them. I turned to Dara.</p>

<p>"We go to the bridge, but not by this road. We take the lanes
until we reach the cliffs."</p>

<p>They wheeled their horses, and for the first time I realized
that all this little troop of mine were mounted. And for the first
time I realized that all were of my own guard, and that many of
them had been foot-soldiers, yet these, too, were riding, and that
upon a score of saddles were the colors of nobles who had followed
me and the Witch-woman and Tibur through the gap of Sirk. It was
Naral who, reading my perplexity, spoke, half-impudently as
always:</p>

<p>"These are your most faithful, Dwayanu! The horses were
idle&mdash;or a few we made so. For your better shield should
Tibur&mdash;make mistake again."</p>

<p>I said nothing to that until we had gone around the burning
house and were under cover of one of the lanes. Then I spoke to
them:</p>

<p>"Naral&mdash;Dara&mdash;let us talk apart for a moment."</p>

<p>And when we had drawn a little away from the others, I said:</p>

<p>"To you two I owe my life&mdash;most of all to you, Dara. All
that I can give you is yours for the asking. All I ask of you
is&mdash;truth."</p>

<p>"Dwayanu&mdash;you shall have it."</p>

<p>"Why did Tibur want to kill me?"</p>

<p>Naral said, dryly:</p>

<p>"The Smith was not the only one who wanted you killed,
Dwayanu."</p>

<p>I knew that, but I wanted to hear it from them.</p>

<p>"Who else, Naral?"</p>

<p>"Lur&mdash;and most of the nobles."</p>

<p>"But why? Had I not opened Sirk for them?"</p>

<p>"You were becoming too strong, Dwayanu. It is not in Lur or
Tibur to take second place&mdash;or third...or maybe no place."</p>

<p>"But they had opportunity before&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you had not taken Sirk for them," said Dara.</p>

<p>Naral said, resentfully:</p>

<p>"Dwayanu, you play with us. You know as well as
we&mdash;better&mdash; what the reason was. You came here with that
friend we have just left on his fire couch. All knew it. If you
were to die&mdash;so must he die. He must not live, perhaps to
escape and bring others into this place&mdash;for I know, as some
others do, that there is life beyond here and that Khalk'ru does
not reign supreme, as the nobles tell us. Well&mdash;here together
are you and this friend of yours. And not only you two, but also
the dark girl of the Rrrllya, whose death or capture might break
the spirit of the little folk and put them under Karak's yoke. The
three of you&mdash;together! Why, Dwayanu&mdash;it was the one
place and the one time to strike! And Lur and Tibur did&mdash;and
killed your friend, and think they have killed you, and have taken
the dark girl."</p>

<p>"And if I kill Tibur, Naral?"</p>

<p>"Then there will be fighting. And you must guard yourself well,
for the nobles hate you, Dwayanu. They have been told you are
against the old customs &mdash;mean to debase them, and raise the
people. Intend even to end the Sacrifices..."</p>

<p>She glanced at me, slyly.</p>

<p>"And if that were true?"</p>

<p>"You have most of the soldiers with you now, Dwayanu. If it were
true you would also have most of the people. But Tibur has his
friends&mdash;even among the soldiers. And Lur is no weakling."</p>

<p>She twitched up her horse's head, viciously.</p>

<p>"Better kill Lur, too, while you're in the mood, Dwayanu!"</p>

<p>I made no answer to that. We trotted through the lanes, not
speaking again. Everywhere were dead, and gutted houses. We came
out of the city, and rode over the narrow plain to the gap between
the cliffs. There happened to be none on the open road just then;
so we entered the gap unnoticed. We passed through it out into the
square behind the fortress. There were soldiers here, in plenty,
and groups of captives. I rode in the center of my troop, bent over
the neck of my horse. Dara had roughly bandaged my head. The
bandages and cap-helmet I had picked up hid my yellow hair. There
was much confusion, and I passed through unnoticed. I rode straight
to the door of the tower behind which we had lurked when Karak
stormed the bridge. I slipped in with my horse, half-closed the
door. My women grouped themselves outside. They were not likely to
be challenged. I settled down to wait for Tibur.</p>

<p>It was hard waiting, that! Jim's face over the camp-fire. Jim's
face grinning at me in the trenches. Jim's face above mine when I
lay on the moss bank of the threshold of the mirage&mdash;Jim's
face under mine on the street of Sirk...</p>

<p>Tsantawu! Aie&mdash;Tsantawu! And you thought that only beauty
could come from the forest!</p>

<p>Evalie? I cared nothing for Evalie then, caught in that limbo
which at once was ice and candent core of rage.</p>

<p>"Save...Evalie!" Jim had bade. Well, I would save Evalie! Beyond
that she mattered no more than did the Witch-woman...yes, a little
more...I had a score to satisfy with the Witch-woman...I had none
with Evalie...</p>

<p>The face of Jim...always the face of Jim...floating before
me....</p>

<p>I heard a whisper&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dwayanu&mdash;Tibur comes!"</p>

<p>"Is Lur with him, Dara?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;a group of the nobles. He is laughing. He carries the
dark girl on his saddle-bow."</p>

<p>"How far away is he, Dara?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps a bow-shot. He rides slowly."</p>

<p>"When I ride out, close in behind me. The fight will be between
me and Tibur. I do not think those with him will dare attack me. If
they do..."</p>

<p>Naral laughed.</p>

<p>"If they do, we shall be at their throats, Dwayanu. There are
one or two of Tibur's friends I would like to settle accounts with.
We ask you only this: waste neither words nor time on Tibur. Kill
him quickly. For by the gods, if he kills you, it will be the
boiling pot and the knives of the flayers for all of us he
captures."</p>

<p>"I will kill him, Naral."</p>

<p>Slowly I opened the great door. Now I could see Tibur, his horse
pacing toward the bridge-end. Upon the pommel of his saddle was
Evalie. Her body drooped; the hair of blue-black was loosened and
covered her face like a veil. Her hands were tied behind her back,
and gripped in one of Tibur's. There were a score of his followers
around and behind him, nobles&mdash;and the majority of them men. I
had noticed that although the Witch-woman had few men among her
guards and garrisons, the Smith showed a preference for them among
his friends and personal escort. His head was turned toward them,
his voice, roaring with triumph, and his laughter came plainly to
me. By now the enclosure was almost empty of soldiers and captives.
There was none between us. I wondered where the Witch-woman
was.</p>

<p>Closer came Tibur, and closer.</p>

<p>"Ready Dara&mdash;Naral?"</p>

<p>"Ready, Lord!"</p>

<p>I flung open the gate. I raced toward Tibur, head bent low, my
little troop behind me. I swung against him with head uplifted,
thrust my face close to his.</p>

<p>Tibur's whole body grew rigid, his eyes glared into mine, his
jaw dropped. I knew that those who followed him were held in that
same incredulous stupefaction. Before the Smith could recover from
his paralysis, I had snatched Evalie up from his saddle, had passed
her to Dara.</p>

<p>I lifted my sword to slash at Tibur's throat. I gave him no
warning. It was no time for chivalry. Twice he had tried
treacherously to kill me. I would make quick end.</p>

<p>Swift as had been my stroke, the Smith was swifter. He threw
himself back, slipped off his horse, and landed like a cat at its
heels. I was down from mine before his great sledge was half-raised
to hurl. I thrust my blade forward to pierce his throat. He parried
it with the sledge. Then berserk rage claimed him. The hammer fell
clanging on the rock. He threw himself on me, howling. His arms
circled me, fettering mine to my sides, like living bands of steel.
His legs felt for mine, striving to throw me. His lips were drawn
back like a mad wolf's, and he bored his head into the pit of my
neck, trying to tear my throat with his teeth.</p>

<p>My ribs cracked under the tightening vice of Tibur's arms. My
lungs were laboring, sight dimming. I writhed and twisted in the
effort to escape the muzzling of that hot mouth and the searching
fangs.</p>

<p>I heard shouting around me, heard and dimly saw milling of the
horses. The clutching fingers of my left hand touched my
girdle&mdash;closed on something there&mdash;something like the
shaft of a javelin&mdash;</p>

<p>Tibur's hell-forged dart!</p>

<p>Suddenly I went limp in Tibur's grip. His laughter bellowed,
hoarse with triumph. And for a split-second his grip relaxed.</p>

<p>That split-second was enough. I summoned all my strength and
broke his grip. Before he could clench me again, my hand had swept
down into the girdle and clutched the dart.</p>

<p>I brought it up and drove it into Tibur's throat just beneath
his jaw. I jerked the haft. The opened, razor-edged flanges sliced
through arteries and muscles. The bellowing laughter of Tibur
changed to a hideous gurgling. His hands sought the haft, dragged
at it&mdash;tore it out&mdash;And the blood spurted from Tibur's
mangled throat; Tibur's knees buckled beneath him, and he lurched
and fell at my feet...choking...his hands still feebly groping to
clutch me...</p>

<p>I stood there, dazed, gasping for breath, the pulse roaring in
my ears.</p>

<p>"Drink this. Lord!"</p>

<p>I looked up at Dara. She was holding a wine-skin to me. I took
it with trembling hands, and drank deep. The good wine whipped
through me. Suddenly I took it from my lips.</p>

<p>"The dark girl of the Rrrllya&mdash;Evalie. She is not with
you."</p>

<p>"There she is. I set her on another horse. There was fighting.
Lord."</p>

<p>I stared into Evalie's face. She looked back at me, brown eyes
cold, implacable.</p>

<p>"Better use the rest of the wine to wash your face, Lord. You
are no sight for any tender maid."</p>

<p>I passed my hand over my face, drew it away wet with blood.</p>

<p>"Tibur's blood, Dwayanu, thank the gods!"</p>

<p>She brought my horse forward. I felt better when I was in its
saddle. I glanced down at Tibur. His fingers were still faintly
twitching. I looked about me. There was a shattered company of
Karak's archers at the bridge-end. They raised their bows in
salute.</p>

<p>"Dwayanu! Live Dwayanu!"</p>

<p>My troop seemed strangely shrunken. I called&mdash;"Naral!"</p>

<p>"Dead, Dwayanu. I told you there had been fighting."</p>

<p>"Who killed her?"</p>

<p>"Never mind. I slew him. And those left of Tibur's escort have
fled. And now what. Lord?"</p>

<p>"We wait for Lur."</p>

<p>"Not long shall we have to linger then, for here she comes."</p>

<p>There was the blast of a horn. I turned to see the Witch-woman
come galloping over the square. Her red braids were loose, her
sword was red, and she was nigh as battle-stained as I. With her
rode a scant dozen of her women, half as many of her nobles.</p>

<p>I awaited her. She reined up before me, searching me with wild
bright eyes.</p>

<p>I should have killed her as I had Tibur. I should have been
hating her. But I found I was not hating her at all. All of hate I
had held seemed to have poured out upon Tibur! No, I was not hating
her.</p>

<p>She smiled faintly:</p>

<p>"You are hard to kill. Yellow-hair!"</p>

<p>"Dwayanu&mdash;Witch."</p>

<p>She glanced at me, half-contemptuously.</p>

<p>"You are no longer Dwayanu!"</p>

<p>"Try to convince these soldiers of that, Lur."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know" she said, and stared down at Tibur. "So you killed
the Smith. Well, at least you are still a man."</p>

<p>"Killed him for you, Lur!" I jeered. "Did I not promise
you?"</p>

<p>She did not answer, only asked, as Dara had before her:</p>

<p>"And now what?"</p>

<p>"We wait here until Sirk is emptied. Then we ride to Karak, you
beside me. I do not like you at my back, Witch-woman."</p>

<p>She spoke quietly to her women, then sat, head bent, thinking,
with never another word for me.</p>

<p>I whispered to Dara:</p>

<p>"Can we trust the archers?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"Bid them wait and march with us. Let them drag the body of
Tibur into some corner."</p>

<p>For half an hour the soldiers came by, with prisoners, with
horses, with cattle and other booty. Small troops of the nobles and
their supporters galloped up, halted, and spoke, but, at my word
and Lur's nod, passed on over the bridge. Most of the nobles showed
dismayed astonishment at my resurrection; the soldiers gave me glad
salute.</p>

<p>The last skeleton company came through the gap. I had been
watching for Sri, but he was not with them, and I concluded that he
had been taken to Karak with the earliest prisoners or had been
killed.</p>

<p>"Come," I said to the Witch-woman. "Let your women go before
us."</p>

<p>I rode over to Evalie, lifted her from her saddle and set her on
my pommel. She made no resistance, but I felt her shrink from me. I
knew she was thinking that she had but exchanged Tibur for another
master, that to me she was only spoil of war. If my mind had not
been so weary I suppose that would have hurt. But my mind was too
weary to care.</p>

<p>We passed over the bridge, through the curling mists of steam.
We were halfway to the forest when the Witch-woman threw back her
head and sent forth a long, wailing call. The white wolves burst
from the ferns. I gave command to the archers to set arrows. Lur
shook her head.</p>

<p>"No need to harm them. They go to Sirk. They have earned their
pay."</p>

<p>The white wolves coursed over the barren to the bridge-end,
streamed over it, vanished. I heard them howling among the
dead.</p>

<p>"I, too, keep my promises," said the Witch-woman.</p>

<p>We rode on, into the forest, back to Karak.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap22" id="chap22"></a>22. &mdash; GATE OF
KHALK'RU</h2>

<p class="first">We were close to Karak when the drums of the
Little People began beating.</p>

<p>The leaden weariness pressed down upon me increasingly. I
struggled to keep awake. Tibur's stroke on my head had something to
do with that, but I had taken other blows and eaten nothing since
long before dawn. I could not think, much less plan what I was
going to do after I had got back to Karak.</p>

<p>The drums of the Little People drove away my lethargy, brought
me up wide- awake. They crashed out at first like a thunderburst
across the white river. After that they settled down into a slow,
measured rhythm filled with implacable menace. It was like Death
standing on hollow graves and stamping on them before he
marched.</p>

<p>At the first crash Evalie straightened, then sat listening with
every nerve. I reined up my horse, and saw that the Witch-woman had
also halted and was listening with all of Evalie's intentness.
There was something inexplicably disturbing in that monotonous
drumming. Something that reached beyond and outside of human
experience&mdash;or reached before it. It was like thousands of
bared hearts beating in unison, in one unalterable rhythm, not to
be still till the hearts themselves stopped...inexorable...and
increasing in a steadily widening area...spreading,
spreading...until they beat from all the land across white
Nanbu.</p>

<p>I spoke to Lur.</p>

<p>"I am thinking that here is the last of my promises,
Witch-woman. I killed Yodin, gave you Sirk, I slew Tibur&mdash;and
here is your war with the Rrrllya."</p>

<p>I had not thought of how that might sound to Evalie! She turned
and gave me one long level look of scorn; she said to the
Witch-woman, coldly, in halting Uighur:</p>

<p>"It is war. Was that not what you expected when you dared to
take me? It will be war until my people have me again. Best be
careful how you use me."</p>

<p>The Witch-woman's control broke at that, all the long pent-up
fires of her wrath bursting forth.</p>

<p>"Good! Now we shall wipe out your yellow dogs for once and all.
And you shall be flayed, or bathed in the cauldron&mdash;or given
to Khalk'ru. Win or lose&mdash;there will be little of you for your
dogs to fight over. You shall be used as I choose."</p>

<p>"No," I said, "as I choose, Lur."</p>

<p>The blue eyes flamed on me at that. And the brown eyes met mine
as scornfully as before.</p>

<p>"Give me a horse to ride. I do not like the touch of you&mdash;
Dwayanu!"</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, you ride with me, Evalie."</p>

<p>We passed into Karak. The drums beat now loud, now low. But
always with that unchanging, inexorable rhythm. They swelled and
fell, swelled and fell. Like Death still stamping on the hollow
graves&mdash;now fiercely&mdash; and now lightly.</p>

<p>There were many people in the streets. They stared at Evalie,
and whispered. There were no shouts of welcome, no cheering. They
seemed sullen, frightened. Then I knew they were listening so
closely to the drums that they hardly knew we were passing. The
drums were closer. I could hear them talking from point to point
along the far bank of the river. The tongues of the talking drums
rose plain above the others. And through their talking, repeated
and repeated:</p>

<p>"Ev-ah-lee! Ev-ah-lee!"</p>

<p>We rode over the open square to the gate of the black citadel.
There I stopped.</p>

<p>"A truce, Lur."</p>

<p>She sent a mocking glance at Evalie.</p>

<p>"A truce! What need of a truce between you and
me&mdash;Dwayanu?"</p>

<p>I said, quietly:</p>

<p>"I am tired of bloodshed. Among the captives are some of the
Rrrllya. Let us bring them where they can talk with Evalie and with
us two. We will then release a part of them, and send them across
Nanbu with the message that no harm is intended Evalie. That we ask
the Rrrllya to send us on the morrow an embassy empowered to
arrange a lasting peace. And that when that peace is arranged they
shall take Evalie back with them unharmed."</p>

<p>She said, smiling:</p>

<p>"So&mdash;Dwayanu&mdash;fears the dwarfs!"</p>

<p>I repeated:</p>

<p>"I am tired of bloodshed."</p>

<p>"Ah, me," she sighed. "And did I not once hear Dwayanu boast
that he kept his promises&mdash;and was thereby persuaded to give
him payment for them in advance! Ah, me&mdash;but Dwayanu is
changed!"</p>

<p>She stung me there, but I managed to master my anger; I
said:</p>

<p>"If you will not agree to this, Lur, then I myself will give the
orders. But then we shall be a beleaguered city which is at its own
throat. And easy prey for the enemy."</p>

<p>She considered this.</p>

<p>"So you want no war with the little yellow dogs? And it is your
thought that if the girl is returned to them, there will be none?
Then why wait? Why not send her back at once with the captives?
Take them up to Nansur, parley with the dwarfs there. Drum talk
would settle the matter in a little while &mdash;if you are right.
Then we can sleep this night without the drums disturbing you."</p>

<p>That was true enough, but I read the malice in it. The truth was
that I did not want Evalie sent back just then. If she were, then
never, I knew, might I have a chance to justify myself with her,
break down her distrust &mdash;have her again accept me as the Leif
whom she had loved. But given a little time&mdash;I might. And the
Witch-woman knew this.</p>

<p>"Not so quickly should it be done, Lur," I said, suavely. "That
would be to make them think we fear them&mdash;as the proposal made
you think I feared them. We need more than hasty drum talk to seal
such treaty. No, we hold the girl as hostage until we make our
terms."</p>

<p>She bent her head, thinking, then looked at me with clear eyes,
and smiled.</p>

<p>"You are right, Dwayanu. I will send for the captives after I
have rid myself of these stains of Sirk. They will be brought to
your chamber. And in the meantime I will do more. I will order that
word be sent the Rrrllya on Nansur that soon their captured fellows
will be among them with a message. At the least it will give us
time. And we need time, Dwayanu&mdash;both of us."</p>

<p>I looked at her sharply. She laughed, and gave her horse the
spurs. I rode behind her through the gate and into the great
enclosed square. It was crowded with soldiers and captives. Here
the drumming was magnified. The drums seemed to be within the place
itself, invisible and beaten by invisible drummers. The soldiers
were plainly uneasy, the prisoners excited, and curiously
defiant.</p>

<p>Passing into the citadel I called various officers who had not
taken part in the attack on Sirk and gave orders that the garrison
on the walls facing Nansur Bridge be increased. Also that an alarm
should be sounded which would bring in the soldiers and people from
the outer-lying posts and farms. I ordered the guard upon the river
walls to be strengthened, and the people of the city be told that
those who wished to seek shelter in the citadel could come, but
must be in by dusk. It was a scant hour before nightfall. There
would be little trouble in caring for them in that immense place.
And all this I did in event of the message failing. If it failed, I
had no desire to be part of a massacre in Karak, which would stand
a siege until I could convince the Little People of my good faith.
Or convince Evalie of it, and have her bring about a peace.</p>

<p>This done, I took Evalie to my own chambers, not those of the
High-priest where the Black Octopus hovered over the three thrones,
but a chain of comfortable rooms in another part of the citadel.
The little troop, which had stood by me through the sack of Sirk
and after, followed us. There I turned Evalie over to Dara. I was
bathed, my wound dressed and bandaged, and clothed. Here the
windows looked out over the river, and the drums beat through them
maddeningly. I ordered food brought, and wine, and summoned Evalie.
Dara brought her. She had been well cared for, but she would not
eat with me. She said to me:</p>

<p>"I fear my people will have but scant faith in any messages you
send, Dwayanu."</p>

<p>"Later we will talk of that other message, Evalie. I did not
send it. And Tsantawu, dying in my arms, believed me when I told
him I had not."</p>

<p>"I heard you say to Lur that you had promised her Sirk. You did
not lie to her, Dwayanu&mdash;for Sirk is eaten. How can I believe
you?"</p>

<p>I said: "You shall have proof that I speak truth, Evalie, Now,
since you will not eat with me, go with Dara."</p>

<p>She had no fault to find with Dara. Dara was no lying traitor,
but a soldier, and fighting in Sirk or elsewhere was part of her
trade. She went with her.</p>

<p>I ate sparingly and drank heavily. The wine put new life in me,
drove away what was left of weariness. I put sorrow for Jim
resolutely aside for the moment, thinking of what I intended to do,
and how best to do it. And then there was a challenge at the door,
and the Witch-woman entered.</p>

<p>Her red braids crowned her and in them shone the sapphires. She
bore not the slightest mark of the struggles of the day, nor sign
of fatigue. Her eyes were bright and clear, her red lips smiling.
Her low, sweet voice, her touch upon my arm, brought back memories
I had thought gone with Dwayanu.</p>

<p>She called, and through the door came a file of soldiers, and
with them a score of the Little People, unbound, hatred in their
yellow eyes as they saw me, curiosity too. I spoke to them, gently.
I sent for Evalie. She came, and the golden pygmies ran to her,
threw themselves upon her like a crowd of children, twittering and
trilling, stroking her hair, touching her feet and hands.</p>

<p>She laughed, called them one by one by name, then spoke rapidly.
I could get little of what she said; by the shadow on Lur's face I
knew she had understood nothing at all. I repeated to Evalie
precisely what I had told Lur &mdash;and which, at least in part,
she knew, for she had betrayed that she understood the Uighur, or
the Ayjir, better than she had admitted. I translated from the
tongue of the dwarfs for Lur.</p>

<p>The pact was speedily made. Half of the pygmies were to make
their way at once over Nanbu to the garrison on the far side of the
bridge. By the talking drums they would send our message to the
stronghold of the Little People. If they accepted it, the beating
of the war drums would cease. I said to Evalie:</p>

<p>"When they talk on their drums, let them say that nothing will
be asked of them that was not contained in the old truce&mdash;and
that death will no longer lie in wait for them when they cross the
river."</p>

<p>The Witch-woman said:</p>

<p>"Just what does that mean, Dwayanu?"</p>

<p>"Now Sirk is done, there is no longer much need for that
penalty, Lur. Let them gather their herbs and metals as they will;
that is all."</p>

<p>"There is more in your mind than that&mdash;" Her eyes
narrowed.</p>

<p>"They understood me, Evalie&mdash;but do you also tell
them."</p>

<p>The Little People trilled among themselves; then ten of them
stepped forward, those chosen to take the message. As they were
moving away, I stopped them.</p>

<p>"If Sri escaped, let him come with the embassy. Better
still&mdash;let him come before them. Send word through the drums
that he may come as soon as he can. He has my safe-conduct, and
shall stay with Evalie until all is settled."</p>

<p>They chattered over that, assented. The Witch-woman made no
comment. For the first time I saw Evalie's eyes soften as she
looked at me.</p>

<p>When the pygmies were gone, Lur walked to the door, and
beckoned. Ouarda entered.</p>

<p>"Ouarda!"</p>

<p>I liked Ouarda. It was good to know she was alive. I went to her
with outstretched hands. She took them.</p>

<p>"It was two of the soldiers. Lord. They had sisters in Sirk.
They cut the ladder before we could stop them. They were slain,"
she said.</p>

<p>Would to God they had cut it before any could, have followed me
I</p>

<p>Before I could speak, one of my captains knocked and
entered.</p>

<p>"It is long after dusk and the gates are closed. Lord. All those
who would come are behind them."</p>

<p>"Were there many, soldier?"</p>

<p>"No, Lord&mdash;not more than a hundred or so. The others
refused."</p>

<p>"And did they say why they refused?"</p>

<p>"Is the question an order. Lord?"</p>

<p>"It is an order."</p>

<p>"They said they were safer where they were. That the Rrrllya had
no quarrel with them, who were but meat for Khalk'ru."</p>

<p>"Enough, soldier!" The Witch-woman's voice was harsh. "Go! Take
the Rrrllya with you."</p>

<p>The captain saluted, turned smartly and was gone with the
dwarfs. I laughed.</p>

<p>"Soldiers cut our ladder for sympathy of those who fled
Khalk'ru. The people fear the enemies of Khalk'ru less than they do
their own kind who are his butchers! We do well to make peace with
the Rrrllya, Lur."</p>

<p>I watched her face pale, then redden and saw the knuckles of her
hands whiten as she clenched them. She smiled, poured herself wine,
lifted it with a steady hand.</p>

<p>"I drink to your wisdom&mdash;Dwayanu!"</p>

<p>A strong soul&mdash;the Witch-woman's! A warrior's heart.
Somewhat lacking in feminine softness, it was true. But it was no
wonder that Dwayanu had loved her&mdash;in his way and as much as
he could love a woman.</p>

<p>A silence dropped upon the chamber, intensified in some odd
fashion by the steady beating of the drums. How long we sat in that
silence I do not know. But suddenly the beat of the drums became
fainter.</p>

<p>And then all at once the drums ceased entirely. The quiet
brought a sense of unreality. I could feel the tense nerves
loosening like springs long held taut. The abrupt silence made ears
ache, slowed heart-beat.</p>

<p>"They have the message. They have accepted it," Evalie
spoke.</p>

<p>The Witch-woman arose.</p>

<p>"You keep the girl beside you to-night, Dwayanu?"</p>

<p>"She sleeps in one of these rooms, Lur. She will be under guard.
No one can reach her without passing through my room here," I
looked at her, significantly. "And I sleep lightly. You need have
no fear of her escape."</p>

<p>"I am glad the drums will not disturb your
sleep&mdash;Dwayanu."</p>

<p>She gave me a mocking salute, and, with Ouarda, left me.</p>

<p>And suddenly the weariness dropped upon me again. I turned to
Evalie, watching me with eyes in which I thought doubt of her own
deep doubt had crept. Certainly there was no scorn, nor loathing in
them. Well, now I had her where all this maneuvering had been meant
to bring her. Alone with me. And looking at her I felt that in the
face of all she had seen of me, all she had undergone because of
me&mdash;words were useless things. Nor could I muster them as I
wanted. No, there would be plenty of time...in the morning,
perhaps, when I had slept...or after I had done what I had to
do...then she must believe...</p>

<p>"Sleep, Evalie. Sleep without fear...and believe that all that
has been wrong is now becoming right. Go with Dara. You shall be
well guarded. None can come to you except through this room, and
here I will be. Sleep and fear nothing."</p>

<p>I called Dara, gave her instructions, and Evalie went with her.
At the curtains masking the entrance to the next room she
hesitated, half turned as though to speak, but did not. And not
long after Dara returned. She said:</p>

<p>"She is already asleep, Dwayanu."</p>

<p>"As you should be, friend," I told her. "And all those others
who stood by me this day. I think there is nothing to fear
to-night. Select those whom you can trust and have them guard the
corridor and my door. Where have you put her?"</p>

<p>"In the chamber next this, Lord."</p>

<p>"It would be better if you and the others slept here, Dara.
There are half a dozen rooms for you. Have wine and food brought
for you&mdash;plenty of it."</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>"Do you expect a siege, Dwayanu?"</p>

<p>"One never knows."</p>

<p>"You do not greatly trust Lur, Lord?"</p>

<p>"I trust her not at all, Dara."</p>

<p>She nodded, turned to go. Upon the impulse I said:</p>

<p>"Dara, would it make you sleep better to-night and those with
you, and would it help you in picking your guard if I told you
this: there will be no more sacrifices to Khalk'ru while I
live?"</p>

<p>She started; her face lightened, softened. She thrust out her
hand to me:</p>

<p>"Dwayanu&mdash;I had a sister who was given to Khalk'ru. Do you
mean this?"</p>

<p>"By the life of my blood! By all the living gods! I mean
it!"</p>

<p>"Sleep well. Lord!" Her voice was choked. She walked away,
through the curtain, but not before I had seen the tears on her
cheeks.</p>

<p>Well, a woman had a right to weep&mdash;even if she was a
soldier. I myself had wept to-day.</p>

<p>I poured myself wine, sat thinking as I drank. Mainly my
thoughts revolved around the enigma of Khalk'ru. And there was a
good reason for that.</p>

<p>What was Khalk'ru?</p>

<p>I slipped the chain from round my neck, opened the locket and
studied the ring. I closed it, and threw it on the table. Somehow I
felt that it was better there than over my heart while I was doing
this thinking.</p>

<p>Dwayanu had had his doubts about that dread Thing being any
Spirit of the Void, and I, who now was Leif Langdon and a passive
Dwayanu, had no doubts whatever that it was not. Yet I could not
accept Barr's theory of mass hypnotism&mdash;and trickery was out
of the question.</p>

<p>Whatever Khalk'ru might be, Khalk'ru&mdash;as the Witch-woman
had said &mdash;was. Or at least that Shape which became material
through ritual, ring and screen&mdash;was.</p>

<p>I thought that I might have put the experience in the temple of
the oasis down as hallucination if it had not been repeated here in
the Shadowed-land. But there could be no possible doubt about the
reality of the sacrifice I had conducted; no possible doubt as to
the destruction&mdash;absorption&mdash; dissolvement&mdash;of the
twelve girls. And none of Yodin's complete belief in the power of
the tentacle to remove me, and none of his complete effacement. And
I thought that if the sacrifices and Yodin were standing in the
wings laughing at me, as Barr had put it&mdash;then it was in the
wings of a theater in some other world than this. And there was the
deep horror of the Little People, the horror of so many of the
Ayjir&mdash;and there was the revolt in ancient Ayjirland born of
this same horror, which had destroyed Ayjirland by civil war.</p>

<p>No, whatever the Thing was, no matter how repugnant to science
its recognition as a reality might be&mdash;still it was atavism,
superstition &mdash;call it what Barr would&mdash;I knew the Thing
was real! Not of this earth&mdash;no, most certainly not of this
earth. Not even supernatural. Or rather, supernatural only insofar
as it might come from another dimension or even another world which
our five senses could not encompass.</p>

<p>And I reflected, now, that science and religion are really blood
brothers, which is largely why they hate each other so, that
scientists and religionists are quite alike in their dogmatism,
their intolerance, and that every bitter battle of religion over
some interpretation of creed or cult has its parallel in battles of
science over a bone or rock.</p>

<p>Yet just as there are men in the churches whose minds have not
become religiously fossilized, so there are men in the laboratories
whose minds have not become scientifically fossilized...Einstein,
who dared challenge all conceptions of space and time with his four
dimensional space in which time itself was a dimension, and who
followed that with proof of five dimensional space instead of the
four which are all our senses can apprehend, and which apprehends
one of them wrongly...the possibility of a dozen worlds spinning
interlocked with this one...in the same space...the energy which we
call matter of each of them keyed to the different vibration, and
each utterly unaware of the other...and utterly overturning the old
axiom that two bodies cannot occupy the same place at the same
time.</p>

<p>And I thought&mdash;what if far and far back in time, a
scientist of that day, one of the Ayjir people, had discovered all
that! Had discovered the fifth dimension beyond length, breadth,
thickness and time. Or had discovered one of those interlocking
worlds whose matter streams through the interstices of the matter
of ours. And discovering dimension or world, had found the way to
make dwellers in that dimension or that other world both aware of
and manifest to those of this. By sound and gesture, by ring and
screen, had made a gateway through which such dwellers could
come&mdash;or at least, appear! And then what a weapon this
discoverer had&mdash;what a weapon the inevitable priests of that
Thing would have! And did have ages gone, just as they had here in
Karak.</p>

<p>If so, was it one dweller or many who lurked in those gateways
for its drink of life? The memories bequeathed me by Dwayanu told
me there had been other temples in Ayjirland besides that one of
the oasis. Was it the same Being that appeared in each? Was the
Shape that came from the shattered stone of the oasis the same that
had fed in the temple of the mirage? Or were there many of
them&mdash;dwellers in other dimension or other world&mdash; avidly
answering the summons? Nor was it necessarily true that in their
own place these Things had the form of the Kraken. That might be
the shape, through purely natural laws, which entrance into this
world forced upon them.</p>

<p>I thought over that for quite a while. It seemed to me the best
explanation of Khalk'ru. And if it was, then the way to be rid of
Khalk'ru was to destroy his means of entrance. And that, I
reflected, was precisely how the ancient Ayjirs had argued.</p>

<p>But it did not explain why only those of the old blood could
summon&mdash;</p>

<p>I heard a low voice at the door. I walked softly over to it,
listened. I opened the door and there was Lur, talking to the
guards.</p>

<p>"What is it you are seeking, Lur?"</p>

<p>"To speak with you. I will keep you only a little time,
Dwayanu."</p>

<p>I studied the Witch-woman. She stood, very quietly, in her eyes
nothing of defiance nor resentment nor subtle
calculation&mdash;only appeal. Her red braids fell over her white
shoulders; she was without weapon or ornament. She looked younger
than ever I had seen her, and somewhat forlorn. I felt no desire to
mock her nor to deny her. I felt instead the stirrings of a deep
pity.</p>

<p>"Enter, Lur&mdash;and say all that is in your mind."</p>

<p>I closed the door behind her. She walked over to the window,
looked out into the dim greenly glimmering night. I went to
her.</p>

<p>"Speak softly, Lur. The girl is asleep there in the next
chamber. Let her rest."</p>

<p>She said, tonelessly:</p>

<p>"I wish you had never come here. Yellow-hair." I thought of Jim,
and I answered:</p>

<p>"I wish that too. Witch-woman. But here I am." She leaned
towards me, put her hand over my heart. "Why do you hate me so
greatly?"</p>

<p>"I do not hate you, Lur. I have no hate left in me&mdash;except
for one thing."</p>

<p>"And that&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Involuntarily I looked at the table. One candle shone there and
its light fell on the locket that held the ring. Her glance
followed mine. She said:</p>

<p>"What do you mean to do? Throw Karak open to the dwarfs? Mend
Nansur? Rule here over Karak and the Rrrllya with their dark girl
at your side? Is it that...and if it is that&mdash;what is to
become of Lur? Answer me. I have the right to know. There is a bond
between us...I loved you when you were Dwayanu...you know how
well..."</p>

<p>"And would have killed me while I was still Dwayanu," I said,
sombrely.</p>

<p>"Because I saw Dwayanu dying as you looked into the eyes of the
stranger," she answered. "You whom Dwayanu had mastered was killing
Dwayanu. I loved Dwayanu. Why should I not avenge him?"</p>

<p>"If you believe I am no longer Dwayanu, then I am the man whose
friend you trapped and murdered&mdash;the man whose love you
trapped and would have destroyed. And if that be so&mdash;what
claim have you upon me, Lur?"</p>

<p>She did not answer for moments; then she said:</p>

<p>"I have some justice on my side. I tell you I loved Dwayanu.
Something I knew of your case from the first. Yellow-hair. But I
saw Dwayanu awaken within you. And I knew it was truly he! I knew,
too, that as long as that friend of yours and the dark girl lived
there was danger for Dwayanu. That was why I plotted to bring them
into Sirk. I threw the dice upon the chance of killing them before
you had seen them. Then, I thought, all would be well. There would
be none left to rouse that in you which Dwayanu had mastered. I
lost. I knew I had lost when by whim of Luka she threw you three
together. And rage and sorrow caught me&mdash;and I did...what I
did."</p>

<p>"Lur," I said, "answer me truly. That day you returned to the
Lake of the Ghosts after pursuit of the two women&mdash;were they
not your spies who bore that lying message into Sirk? And did you
not wait until you learned my friend and Evalie were in the trap
before you gave me word to march? And was it not in your thought
that you would then&mdash;if I opened the way into Sirk&mdash;rid
yourself not only of those two but of Dwayanu? For remember
&mdash;you may have loved Dwayanu, but as he told you, you loved
power better than he. And Dwayanu threatened your power. Answer me
truly."</p>

<p>For the second time I saw tears in the eyes of the Witch-woman.
She said, brokenly:</p>

<p>"I sent the spies, yes. I waited until the two were in the trap.
But I never meant harm to Dwayanu!"</p>

<p>I did not believe her. But still I felt no anger, no hate. The
pity grew.</p>

<p>"Lur, now I will tell you truth. It is not in my mind to rule
with Evalie over Karak and the Rrrllya. I have no more desire for
power. That went with Dwayanu. In the peace I make with the dwarfs,
you shall rule over Karak &mdash;if that be your desire. The dark
girl shall go back with them. She will not desire to remain in
Karak. Nor do I..."</p>

<p>"You cannot go with her," she interrupted me. "Never would the
yellow dogs trust you. Their arrows would be ever pointed at
you."</p>

<p>I nodded&mdash;that thought had occurred to me long before.</p>

<p>"All&mdash;that must adjust itself," I said. "But there shall be
no more sacrifices. The gate of Khalk'ru shall be closed against
him for ever. And I will close it."</p>

<p>Her eyes dilated.</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean that I will shut Khalk'ru for ever from
Karak&mdash;unless Khalk'ru proves stronger than I."</p>

<p>She wrung her hands, helplessly.</p>

<p>"What use rule over Karak to me then...how could I hold the
people?"</p>

<p>"Nevertheless&mdash;I will destroy the gate of Khalk'ru."</p>

<p>She whispered:</p>

<p>"Gods&mdash;if I had Yodin's ring..."</p>

<p>I smiled at that.</p>

<p>"Witch-woman, you know as well as I that Khalk'ru comes to no
woman's call."</p>

<p>The witch-lights flickered in her eyes; a flash of green shone
through them.</p>

<p>"There is an ancient prophecy. Yellow-hair, that Dwayanu did not
know &mdash;or had forgotten. It says that when Khalk'ru comes to a
woman's call, he&mdash;stays! That was the reason no woman in
ancient Ayjilrand might be priestess at the sacrifice."</p>

<p>I laughed at that.</p>

<p>"A fine pet, Lur&mdash;to add to your wolves."</p>

<p>She walked toward the door, paused.</p>

<p>"What if I could love you&mdash;as I loved Dwayanu? Could make
you love me as Dwayanu loved me? And more! Send the dark girl to
join her people and take the ban of death from them on this side of
Nanbu. Would you let things be as they are&mdash;rule with me over
Karak?"</p>

<p>I opened the door for her.</p>

<p>"I told you I no longer care for power, Lur."</p>

<p>She walked away.</p>

<p>I went back to the window, drew a chair to it, and sat thinking.
Suddenly from somewhere close to the citadel I heard a wolf cry.
Thrice it howled, then thrice again.</p>

<p>"Leif!"</p>

<p>I jumped to my feet. Evalie was beside me. She peered at me
through the veils of her hair; her clear eyes shone upon
me&mdash;no longer doubting, hating, fearing. They were as they
were of old.</p>

<p>"Evalie!"</p>

<p>My arms went round her; my lips found hers.</p>

<p>"I listened, Leif!"</p>

<p>"You believe, Evalie!"</p>

<p>She kissed me, held me tight.</p>

<p>"But she was right&mdash;Leif. You could not go with me again
into the land of the Little People. Never, never would they
understand. And I would not dwell in Karak."</p>

<p>"Will you go with me, Evalie&mdash;to my own land? After I have
done what I must do...and if I am not destroyed in its doing?"</p>

<p>"I will go with you, Leif!"</p>

<p>And she wept a while, and after another while she fell asleep in
my arms. And I lifted her, and carried her into her chamber and
covered her with the sleep silks. Nor did she awaken.</p>

<p>I returned to my own room. As I passed the table I picked up the
locket, started to put it round my neck. I threw it back. Never
would I wear that chain again, I dropped upon the bed, sword at
hand. I slept.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap23" id="chap23"></a>23. &mdash; IN KHALK'RU'S
TEMPLE</h2>

<p class="first">Twice I awakened. The first time it was the
howling of the wolves that aroused me. It was as though they were
beneath my window. I listened drowsily, and sank back to sleep.</p>

<p>The second time I came wide awake from a troubled dream. Some
sound in the chamber had roused me, of that I was sure. My hand
dropped to my sword lying on the floor beside my bed. I had the
feeling that there was someone in the room. I could see nothing in
the green darkness that filled the chamber. I called, softly:</p>

<p>"Evalie! Is that you?"</p>

<p>There was no answer, no sound.</p>

<p>I sat up in the bed, even thrust a leg out to rise. And then I
remembered the guards at my door, and Dara and her soldiers beyond,
and I told myself that it had been only my troubled dream that had
awakened me. Yet for a time I lay awake listening, sword in hand.
And then the silence lulled me back to sleep.</p>

<p>There was a knocking upon my door, and I struggled out of that
sleep. I saw that it was well after dawn. I went to the door softly
so that I might not awaken Evalie. I opened it, and there with the
guards was Sri. The little man had come well armed, with spear and
sickle-sword and between his shoulders one of the small,
surprisingly resonant talking drums. He looked at me in the
friendliest fashion. I patted his hand and pointed to the
curtains.</p>

<p>"Evalie is there, Sri. Go waken her."</p>

<p>He trotted past me. I gave greeting to the guards, and turned to
follow Sri. He stood at the curtains, looking at me with eyes in
which was now no friendliness at all. He said:</p>

<p>"Evalie is not there."</p>

<p>I stared at him, incredulously, brushed by him and into that
chamber. It was empty. I crossed to the pile of silks and cushions
on which Evalie had slept, touched them. There was no warmth. I
went, Sri at my heels, into the next room. Dara and a half dozen of
the women lay there, asleep. Evalie was not among them. I touched
Dara on the shoulder. She sat up, yawning.</p>

<p>"Dara&mdash;the girl is gone!"</p>

<p>"Gone!" she stared at me as incredulously as I had at the golden
pygmy. She leaped to her feet, ran to the empty room, then with me
through the other chambers. There lay the soldier women, asleep,
but not Evalie.</p>

<p>I ran back to my own room, and to its door. A bitter rage began
to possess me. Swiftly, harshly, I questioned the guards. They had
seen no one. None had entered; none had gone forth. The golden
pygmy listened, his eyes never leaving me.</p>

<p>I turned toward Evalie's room. I passed the table on which I had
thrown the locket. My hand fell on it, lifted it; it was curiously
light...I opened it...The ring of Khalk'ru was not there! I glared
at the empty locket &mdash;and like a torturing flame realization
of what its emptiness and the vanishment of Evalie might signify
came to me. I groaned, leaned against the table to keep from
falling.</p>

<p>"Drum, Sri! Call your people! Bid them come quickly! There may
yet be time!"</p>

<p>The golden pygmy hissed; his eyes became little pools of yellow
fire. He could not have known all the horror of my
thoughts&mdash;but he read enough. He leaped to the window, swung
his drum and sent forth call upon call &mdash;peremptory, raging,
vicious. At once he was answered&mdash;answered from Nansur, and
then from all the river and beyond it the drums of the Little
People roared out.</p>

<p>Would Lur hear them? She could not help but hear them...but
would she heed...would their threat stop her...it would tell her
that I was awake and that the Little People knew of their
betrayal...and Evalie's.</p>

<p>God! If she did hear&mdash;was it in time to save Evalie?</p>

<p>"Quick, Lord!" Dara called from the curtains. The dwarf and I
ran through. She pointed to the side of the wall. There, where one
of the carved stones jointed another, hung a strip of silk.</p>

<p>"A door there, Dwayanu! That is how they took her. They went
hurriedly. The cloth caught when the stone closed."</p>

<p>I looked for something to batter at the stone. But Dara was
pressing here and there. The stone swung open. Sri darted past and
into the black passage it had masked. I stumbled after him, Dara at
my heels, the others following. It was a narrow passage, and not
long. Its end was a solid wall of stone. And here Dara pressed
again until that wall opened.</p>

<p>We burst into the chamber of the High-priest. The eyes of the
Kraken stared at me and through me with their inscrutable
malignancy. Yet it seemed to me that in them now was challenge.</p>

<p>All my senseless fury, all blind threshing of my rage, fell from
me. A cold deliberation, an ordered purpose that had in it nothing
of haste took its place...Is it too late to save Evalie?...It is
not too late to destroy you, my enemy...</p>

<p>"Dara&mdash;get horses for us. Gather quickly as many as you can
trust. Take only the strongest. Have them ready at the gate of the
road to the temple...We go to end Khalk'ru. Tell them that."</p>

<p>I spoke to the golden pygmy.</p>

<p>"I do not know if I can help Evalie. But I go to put an end to
Khalk'ru. Do you wait for your people&mdash;or do you go with
me?"</p>

<p>"I go with you."</p>

<p>I knew where the Witch-woman dwelt in the black citadel, and it
was not far away. I knew I would not find her there, but I must be
sure. And she might have taken Evalie to the Lake of the Ghosts, I
was thinking as I went on, past groups of silent, uneasy, perplexed
and saluting soldiers. But deep in me I knew she had not. Deep
within me I knew that it had been Lur who had awakened me in the
night. Lur, who had stolen through the curtains to take the ring of
Khalk'ru. And there was only one reason why she should have done
that. No, she would not be at the Lake of the Ghosts.</p>

<p>Yet, if she had come into my room&mdash;why had she not slain
me? Or had she meant to do this, and had my awakening and calling
out to Evalie stayed her? Had she feared to go further? Or had she
deliberately spared me?</p>

<p>I reached her rooms. She was not there. None of her women was
there. The place was empty, not even soldiers on guard.</p>

<p>I broke into a run. The golden pygmy followed me, shrilling,
javelins in left hand, sickle-sword in right. We came to the gate
to the temple road.</p>

<p>There were three or four hundred soldiers awaiting me.
Mounted&mdash;and every one a woman. I threw myself on a horse Dara
held for me, swung Sri up on the saddle. We raced toward the
temple.</p>

<p>We were half-way there when out from the trees that bordered the
temple road poured the white wolves. They sprang from the sides
like a white torrent, threw themselves upon the riders. They
checked our rush, our horses stumbled, falling over those the fangs
of the wolves had dropped in that swift, unexpected ambuscade;
soldiers falling with them, ripped and torn by the wolves before
they could struggle to their feet. We milled among them
&mdash;horses and men and wolves in a whirling, crimson-flecked
ring.</p>

<p>Straight at my throat leaped the great dog-wolf, leader of Lur's
pack, green eyes naming. I had no time for sword thrust. I caught
its throat in my left hand, lifted it and flung it over my back.
Even so, its fangs had struck and gashed me.</p>

<p>We were through the wolves. What was left of them came coursing
behind us. But they had taken toll of my troop.</p>

<p>I heard the clang of an anvil...thrice stricken...the anvil of
Tubalka!</p>

<p>God! It was true...Lur in the temple...and Evalie...and
Khalk'ru!</p>

<p>We swept up to the door of the temple. I heard voices raised in
the ancient chant. The entrance swarmed...It bristled with swords
of the nobles, women and men.</p>

<p>"Ride through them, Dara! Ride them down!"</p>

<p>We swept through them like a ram. Sword against sword, hammers
and battleaxes beating at them, horses trampling them.</p>

<p>The shrill song of Sri never ceased. His javelin thrust, his
sickle-sword slashed.</p>

<p>We burst into Khalk'ru's temple. The chanting stopped. The
chanters arose against us; they struck with sword and axe and
hammer at us; they stabbed and hacked our horses; pulled us down.
The amphitheater was a raging cauldron of death...</p>

<p>The lip of the platform was before me. I spurred my horse to it,
stood upon its back and leaped upon the platform. Close to my right
was the anvil of Tubalka; beside it, hammer raised to smite, was
Ouarda. I heard the roll of drums, the drums of Khalk'ru's
evocation. The backs of the priests were bent over them.</p>

<p>In front of the priests, the ring of Khalk'ru raised high, stood
Lur.</p>

<p>And between her and the bubble ocean of yellow stone that was
the gate of Khalk'ru, fettered dwarfs swung two by two in the
golden girdles...</p>

<p>Within the warrior's ring&mdash;Evalie!</p>

<p>The Witch-woman never looked at me; she never looked behind her
at the roaring cauldron of the amphitheater where the soldiers and
nobles battled.</p>

<p>She launched into the ritual!</p>

<p>Shouting, I rushed on Ouarda. I wrested the great sledge from
her hands. I hurled it straight at the yellow screen...straight at
the head of Khalk'ru. With every ounce of my strength I hurled that
great hammer.</p>

<p>The screen cracked! The hammer was thrown back from
it...fell.</p>

<p>The Witch-woman's voice went on...and on...never faltering.</p>

<p>There was a wavering in the cracked screen. The Kraken floating
in the bubble ocean seemed to draw back...to thrust forward...</p>

<p>I ran toward it...to the hammer.</p>

<p>An instant I halted beside Evalie. I thrust my hands through the
golden girdle, broke it as though it had been wood. I dropped my
sword at her feet.</p>

<p>"Guard yourself, Evalie!"</p>

<p>I picked up the hammer. I raised it. The eyes of Khalk'ru
moved...they glared at me, were aware of me...the tentacles
stirred! And the paralyzing cold began to creep round me...I threw
all my will against it.</p>

<p>I smashed the sledge of Tubalka against the yellow
stone...again...and again&mdash;</p>

<p>The tentacles of Khalk'ru stretched toward me!</p>

<p>There was a crystalline crashing, like a lightning bolt striking
close. The yellow stone of the screen shattered. It rained round me
like sleet driven by an icy hurricane. There was an earthquake
trembling. The temple rocked. My arms fell, paralyzed. The hammer
of Tubalka dropped from hands that could no longer feel it. The icy
cold swirled about me...higher... higher...there was a shrill and
dreadful shrieking...</p>

<p>For an instant the shape of the Kraken hovered where the screen
had been. Then it shrank. It seemed to be sucked away into
immeasurable distances. It vanished.</p>

<p>And life rushed back into me!</p>

<p>There were jagged streamers of the yellow stone upon the rocky
floor... black of the Kraken within them...I beat them into
dust...</p>

<p>"Leif!"</p>

<p>Evalie's voice, shrill, agonized. I swung round. Lur was rushing
upon me, sword raised. Before I could move Evalie had darted
between us, flung herself in front of the Witch-woman, struck at
her with my own sword.</p>

<p>The blade of Lur parried the stroke, swept in...bit deep...and
Evalie fell...Lur leaped toward me...I watched her come, not
moving, not caring... there was blood upon her sword...Evalie's
blood...</p>

<p>Something like a flash of light touched her breast. She halted
as though a hand had thrust her back. Slowly, she dropped to her
knees. She sank to the rock.</p>

<p>Over the rim of the platform leaped the dog-wolf, howling as it
ran. It hurled itself straight at me. There was another flash of
light. The dog-wolf somersaulted and fell&mdash;in mid-leap.</p>

<p>I saw Sri, crouching. One of his javelins was in Lur's breast,
the mate to it in the dog-wolf's throat...I saw the golden pygmy
running to Evalie... saw her rise, holding a hand to a shoulder
from which streamed blood...</p>

<p>I walked toward Lur, stiffly, like an automaton. The white wolf
tried to stagger to its feet, then crawled to the Witch-woman,
dragging itself on its belly. It reached her before I did. It
dropped its head upon her breast. It turned its head, and lay
glaring at me, dying.</p>

<p>The Witch-woman looked up at me. Her eyes were soft and her
mouth had lost all cruelty. It was tender. She smiled at me.</p>

<p>"I wish you had never come here, Yellow-hair!"</p>

<p>And then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ai&mdash;and&mdash;Ai! My Lake of the Ghosts!"</p>

<p>Her hand crept up, and dropped on the head of the dying wolf,
caressingly. She sighed&mdash;</p>

<p>The Witch-woman was dead.</p>

<p>I looked into the awed faces of Evalie and Dara.
"Evalie&mdash;your wound&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not deep, Leif...Soon it will heal...it does not matter..."</p>

<p>Dara said:</p>

<p>"Hail&mdash;Dwayanu! It is a great thing you have done this
day!"</p>

<p>She dropped on her knees, kissed my hand. And now I saw that
those of mine who had survived the battle in the temple had come up
on the platform, and were kneeling&mdash;to me. And that Ouarda lay
beside Tubalka's anvil, and that Sri too was on his knees, staring
at me, eyes filled with worship.</p>

<p>I heard the tumult of the drums of the Little People...no longer
on Nanbu's far side...in Karak...and closer.</p>

<p>Dara spoke again:</p>

<p>"Let us be going back to Karak, Lord. It is now all yours to
rule."</p>

<p>I said to Sri:</p>

<p>"Sound your drum, Sri. Tell them that Evalie lives. That Lur is
dead. That the gate of Khalk'ru is closed forever. Let there be no
more killing."</p>

<p>Sri answered:</p>

<p>"What you have done has wiped out all war between my people and
Karak. Evalie and you we will obey. I will tell them what you have
done."</p>

<p>He swung the little drum, raised his hands to beat it. I stopped
him.</p>

<p>"Wait, Sri, I shall not be here to obey."</p>

<p>Dara cried: "Dwayanu&mdash;you will not leave us!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Dara...I go now to that place whence I came...I do not
return to Karak. I am done with the Little People, Sri."</p>

<p>Evalie spoke, breathlessly:</p>

<p>"What of me&mdash;Leif?"</p>

<p>I put my hands on her shoulders, looked into her eyes:</p>

<p>"Last night you whispered that you would go with me, Evalie. I
release you from that promise...I am thinking you would be happier
here with your small folk..."</p>

<p>She said, steadily:</p>

<p>"I know where happiness lies for me. I hold to my
promise...unless you do not want me..."</p>

<p>"I do want you&mdash;dark girl!"</p>

<p>She turned to Sri: "Carry my love to my people, Sri. I shall not
see them again."</p>

<p>The little man clung to her, cast himself down before her,
wailed and wept while she talked to him. At last he squatted on his
haunches, and stared long at the shattered gate of the Kraken. I
saw the secret knowledge touch him. He came to me, held up his arms
for me to lift him. He raised my lids and looked deep into my eyes.
He thrust his hand in my breast, and placed his head on my breast,
and listened to the beating of my heart. He dropped, bent Evalie's
head to his, whispering.</p>

<p>Dara said: "Dwayanu's will is our will. Yet it is hard to
understand why he will not stay with us."</p>

<p>"Sri knows...more than I do. I cannot, Dara."</p>

<p>Evalie came to me. Her eyes were bright with unshed tears.</p>

<p>"Sri says we must go now, Leif...quickly. My people
must&mdash;not see me. He will tell them a tale upon his
drum...there will be no fighting... and henceforth there will be
peace."</p>

<p>The golden pygmy began to beat the talking drum. At the first
strokes the hosts of other drums were silent. When he had ended
they began again... jubilant, triumphant...until in them crept a
note of questioning. Once more he beat a message...the answer
came&mdash;angry, peremptory&mdash;in some queer fashion,
incredulous.</p>

<p>Sri said to me: "Haste! Haste!"</p>

<p>Dara said: "We stay with you, Dwayanu, until the last."</p>

<p>I nodded, and looked at Lur. Upon her hand the ring of Khalk'ru
sent out a sudden gleam. I went to her, lifted the dead hand and
took from it the ring. I smashed it on the anvil of Tubalka as I
had the ring of Yodin.</p>

<p>Evalie said: "Sri knows a way that will lead us out into your
world, Leif. It lies at the head of Nanbu. He will take us."</p>

<p>"Is the way past the Lake of Ghosts, Evalie?"</p>

<p>"I will ask him...yes, it passes there."</p>

<p>"That is good. We go into a country where the clothing I wear
would be hardly fitting. And some provision must be made for
you."</p>

<p>We rode from the temple with Sri on my saddle, and Evalie and
Dara on either side. The drums were very close. They were muted
when we emerged from the forest upon the road. We went swiftly. It
was mid-afternoon when we reached the Lake of the Ghosts. The
drawbridge was down. There was no one in the garrison. The
Witch-woman's castle was empty. I searched, and found my roll of
clothes; I stripped the finery of Dwayanu from me. I took a
battle-axe, thrust a short sword in my belt, picked javelins for
Evalie and myself. They would help us win through, would be all we
had to depend upon to get us food later on. We took food with us
from Lur's castle, and skins to clothe Evalie when she passed from
the Mirage.</p>

<p>I did not go up into the chamber of the Witch-woman. I heard the
whispering of the waterfall&mdash;and did not dare to look upon
it.</p>

<p>All the rest of that afternoon we galloped along the white
river's banks. The drums of the Little People followed
us...searching...questioning...
calling..."Ev-ah-lee...Ev-ah-lee...Ev-ah-lee..."</p>

<p>By nightfall we had come to the cliffs at the far end of the
valley. Here Nanbu poured forth in a mighty torrent from some
subterranean source. We picked our way across. Sri led us far into
a ravine running steeply upward, and here we camped.</p>

<p>And that night I sat thinking long of what Evalie must meet in
that new world awaiting her beyond the Mirage&mdash;the world of
sun and stars and wind and cold. I thought long of what must be
done to shield her until she could adjust herself to that world.
And I listened to the drums of the Little People calling her, and I
watched her while she slept, and wept and smiled in dream.</p>

<p>She must be taught to breathe. I knew that when she emerged from
this atmosphere in which she had lived since babyhood, she would
cease instantly to breathe&mdash;deprivation of the accustomed
stimulus of the carbon-dioxide would bring that about at once. She
must will herself to breathe until the reflexes again became
automatic and she need give them no conscious thought. And at
night, when she slept, this would be trebly difficult. I would have
to remain awake, watch beside her.</p>

<p>And she must enter this new world with eyes bandaged, blind,
until the nerves accustomed to the green luminosity of the Mirage
could endure the stronger light. Warm clothing we could contrive
from the skins and furs. But the food&mdash;what was it Jim had
said in the long and long ago&mdash; that those who had eaten the
food of the Little People would die if they ate other. Well, that
was true in part. Yet, only in part&mdash;it could be managed.</p>

<p>With dawn came a sudden memory&mdash;the pack I had hidden on
Nanbu's bank when we had plunged into the white river with the
wolves at our heels. If that could be found, it would help solve
the problem of Evalie's clothing at least. I told Dara about it.
And she and Sri set out to find it. And while they were gone the
soldier-women foraged for food and I instructed Evalie upon what
she must do to cross in safety that bridge which lay, perilous,
between her world and mine.</p>

<p>Two days they were gone&mdash;but they had found the pack. They
brought word of peace between the Ayjir and the Little People. As
for me&mdash;</p>

<p>Dwayanu the Deliverer had come even as the prophecy had
promised...had come and freed them from the ancient doom...and had
gone back as was his right to that place from which, answering the
prophecy, he had come...and had taken with him Evalie as was also
his right. Sri had spread the tale.</p>

<p>And next morning when the light showed that the sun had risen
over the peaks that girdled the Valley of the Mirage, we set
forth&mdash;Evalie like a slim boy beside me.</p>

<p>We climbed until we were within the green mists. And here we
bade farewell, Sri clinging to Evalie, kissing her hands and feet,
weeping. And Dara clasped my shoulders:</p>

<p>"You will come back to us, Dwayanu? We will be waiting!"</p>

<p>It was like the echo of the Uighur captain's voice&mdash;long
and long ago...</p>

<p>I turned and began to climb, Evalie following. I thought that so
might Euridice have followed her lover up from the Land of Shades
in another long and long ago.</p>

<p>The figures of Sri and the watching women became dim. They were
hidden under the green mists...</p>

<p>I felt the bitter cold touch my face. I caught Evalie up in my
arms &mdash;and climbed up and on&mdash;and staggered at last out
into the sun- lit warmth of the slopes beyond the pit of the
precipices.</p>

<p>The day dawned when we had won the long, hard fight for Evalie's
life. Not easily was the grip of the Mirage loosed. We turned our
faces to the South and set our feet upon the Southward trail.</p>

<p>And yet...</p>

<p>Ai! Lur&mdash;Witch-woman! I see you lying there, smiling with
lips grown tender&mdash;the white wolf's head upon your breast! And
Dwayanu still lives within me!</p>
