  <h3>BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTE</h3>

  <p class="first">This PGA/RGL edition of <i>My Lady Bountiful</i> was
produced by Lyn
and Maurie Mulcahy as part of their ongoing project to collect the works of
Fred M. White and present them to readers all over the world via Project
Gutenberg Australia and Roy Glashan's Library. The text offered here was
taken from the serial version of the novel published in 1905 by <i>The Evening
News</i>, Sydney, Australia, and archived at
<a href="http://trove.nla.gov.au/">Trove</a>, the web site of
the National Library of Australia. A search of Internet resources failed to
yield any other verifiable bibliographic information about <i>My Lady
Bountiful</i>. There is no record of a library copy at the OCLC WorldCat
site. A list of Fred M. White's books at the
<a href="http://embden11.home.xs4all.nl/Engels6/white.htm">British Crime
Writers</a> web site gives 1915 as the year of publication in book form,
but this may be the result of confusion with a book of the same name by
Littlestone Gilbert, first published by Ward Lock &amp; Co. in 1914.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; THE SETTING OF THE GEM</h2>

  <p class="first">The lantern clock in the great hall struck eight in the
courtly,
  condescending way it had done any time since Karl Halz made him in Antwerp
  "in the yeare of oure Lord, 1619," as the quaint date testified.
  Immediately&mdash;or it would have been immediately in an ordinary
  household&mdash;a tall footman advanced and struck a score of times on the
  big ship's bell that hung under the aforesaid timepiece. As most visitors to
  Caradoc knew, this bell was from the Spanish galleon Santa Maria, the
  Admiral's flagship in the ill-fated Armada.</p>

  <p>Everything was leisurely, courtly, high shouldered at Caradoc. The
  lingering impressiveness of the bell ceremony was reminiscent of mouldy
  ceremony. The Right Honourable Charles Merrion, Secretary for Foreign
  Affairs, remarked that it suggested the funeral of some very important but
  exceedingly disagreeable personage, followed by dinner in a chastened mood,
  but not so chastened as to render one indifferent to the lack of cayenne in
  the savoury.</p>

  <p>The clanging had not died away when a tall figure in black velvet and
  diamonds and lace appeared at the head of the staircase. Leaning on the arm
  of a footman, she came leisurely down into the hall, where the oak pillars
  and the armour and the tapestry had been any time for the last three hundred
  years. Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram never forgot the fact that there had been a
  Caradoc House standing in the same spot since the days of Edward the
  Confessor.</p>

  <p>The aforesaid Secretary for Foreign Affairs was standing with his back to
  the wood fire on the wide hearth in the drawing-room as his hostess entered.
  The footman bowed her into an armchair, and placed a table with a
  reading-lamp at her elbow. The quaint, old-world room, all black oak from
  floor to rafters, was lighted by candles in silver sconces. To the mind of
  the right honourable gentleman the funeral suggestion and sarcophagus effect
  was thus heightened.</p>

  <p>"I had hoped to see you earlier, Charles," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said. There
  was just the shade of reproach in her voice. The Minister inclined his head
  meekly. Even a Foreign Secretary has calls upon his time. "But you look
  worried, Charles."</p>

  <p>The speaker was calm enough. She was tall and dark, and whilst owning
  pleasantly enough to nearly seventy years of age, there was not a grey hair
  on her smooth head. Her features were handsome and haughty, as befitted Mrs.
  Eldred-Wolfram, of Caradoc; her eyes were restless and changeable.</p>

  <p>The dominant note on her features was pride. But then there had been
  Wolframs at Caradoc for over a thousand years. No doubt existed on this head.
  The pedigree of the Wolframs was written in history.</p>

  <p>Time was when the late Christopher Eldred-Wolfram had been an important
  figure in politics. As a holder of office his wife had of necessity seen
  something of the world. But she had never cared for it; she had never for one
  moment forgotten Caradoc and the pedigree of a thousand years. The death of
  her husband had relieved her of the necessity of being polite to
  comparatively new creations and society leaders, whose social edifice was
  firmly rooted in beer barrels and the like. For Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram had been
  related to her husband, and the aegis of the pedigree was as a halo about her
  head.</p>

  <p>For seventeen years now she had never moved from Caradoc. On the face of
  it, hers seemed to be a lonely life. She had openly proclaimed the fact that
  there were not two families in the county worth knowing, and the county had
  resented the ultimatum accordingly.</p>

  <p>Everything was merged into the glory of the Eldred-Wolframs. The queen
  regnant seemed to forget that she had no more than a life interest in the
  estate. She spent her money freely, regally; if her tenants were unfortunate,
  and could not pay their rents, they had only to come hat in hand to the
  throne and say so, and there was an end of the matter. It was an open secret
  that Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram had mortgaged her income to the last penny, but the
  glory of the house was as bright as the crests in the great mullioned
  windows. There was the costly racing stud that never raced in the stables,
  there was a small army of servants and footmen and gardeners. There were no
  finer peaches and grapes in the county, and yet every tradesman was paid to
  the day. It was all very strange, but there it was.</p>

  <p>If "My Lady Bountiful," as she was generally called, condescended to take
  advice from anybody, that fortunate individual was the Right Honourable
  Charles Merrion. Old Lord Saltoun declared openly that Maria Wolfram would
  have so far forgotten herself as to marry him&mdash;despite the fact that his
  pedigree failed to go beyond a Speaker of the House of Commons circa Charles
  II.&mdash;only that family claims came first. Be that as it may, Merrion was
  one of the only men who ever passed the lodge gates of Caradoc.</p>

  <p>"I met the boat," Merrion explained.</p>

  <p>"You have seen the girl?" Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram asked, after a long
  pause.</p>

  <p>"As I wrote to you, the young lady was to have come down with me this
  afternoon. At the last moment she decided to mote as far as Castleford with
  the Wiltshires."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram gasped. Merrion had never seen that stately lady gasp
  before, and he was properly impressed.</p>

  <p>"My unhappy sister and her family!" she said. "Charles, how did the girl
  get entangled with those deplorable people? And she not landed more than
  four-and-twenty hours from Australia!"</p>

  <p>"The explanation is fairly simple," Merrion replied. "The Wiltshires have
  been round the world in their yacht. Very naturally they looked up your
  brother in Australia some little time before he died, poor fellow. Hence the
  acquaintanceship. One of the Wiltshire boys came back with Miss Kathleen
  Wolfram on the Comus, and there you are."</p>

  <p>The listener closed her eyes with pious resignation. All the same, it was
  a dreadful blow. The idea of a child of her brother's on terms of friendship
  with the Wiltshires! Of course, the Wiltshires were popular figures in what
  passed in these degenerate days for society. But Major Wiltshires sire had
  made his money out of a horrid East End brewery.</p>

  <p>"I parted with my sister in sorrow more than anger," she said. "When she
  married John Wiltshire there was an end of all intercourse. It was in vain
  that I implored her to remember that, as the widow of Jasper Eldred, her boy
  would one day be head of the family. When I die, Reginald Eldred will reign
  here. Lucy pointed out the fact that she was horribly poor and that she liked
  John Wiltshire. I pointed out that if she married him the boy Reginald would
  have all his principles sapped in an atmosphere of beer."</p>

  <p>"He is a splendid young fellow," Merrion said warmly.</p>

  <p>"Well, he is one of the family, after all. We must try and make my poor
  boy's daughter properly appreciate her position. But to come down close to
  Caradoc in a motor! And with the Wiltshires! My dear Charles, the mere idea
  of it makes me feel quite faint!"</p>

  <p>Merrion nodded with the polite sympathy of the statesman who always keeps
  a large stock of that kind of thing on hand. As a matter of fact, he was
  thinking that his hostess was a little sillier and more childishly proud than
  usual. Perhaps the loss of her only brother a few months ago in Australia had
  made a difference. Charles Eldred had always been delicate, so delicate that
  he could not live in England, hence the fact that he had migrated to
  Australia and married years ago. It was the only child of this brother that
  Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram was so impatiently waiting.</p>

  <p>"I had a telegram just now," Merrion explained. "The motor broke down on
  the road. Miss Kathleen says she shall drive over from Castleford. Probably
  she will get here before we have finished dinner."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps the mistake has not been hers," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said
  magnanimously. "The atmosphere of Caradoc will not be without its influence.
  But you have not yet told me what the child is like. Of course, she is tall
  and dark, like all our family. I selected my poor brother's wife for him, so
  there is no cause for uneasiness on that score. She is refined and haughty;
  she is a true descendant of an ancient race, in fact. At the same time, I
  trust she is not too haughty."</p>

  <p>Merrion bent down and replaced a log of wood on the fire. His clean-shaven
  lips trembled as if at the recollection of some subtle humour.</p>

  <p>"Well, no," he said thoughtfully, with his fine eyes still on the
  refractory log. "I don't fancy Kathleen will be a martyr to that
  infirmity."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; POST PRANDIAL</h2>

  <p class="first">The sonorous clang of the ship's bell filled the house
sedately. A
  magnificent butler announced dinner as if it had been some dark yet sacred
  rite. He bowed to Merrion, and hoped severely that he was well, though his
  manner conveyed but a poor opinion of the latter's statesmanlike qualities.
  The 'Times' had been down upon the Foreign Secretary lately, and the 'Times'
  invariably had the cachet of Mr. Cedric's approval. In lighter mood he
  trifled with the 'Morning Post,' but that was only when he unbent in the
  servants' hall.</p>

  <p>"We are not dining in state to-night, Maria?" Merrion asked as he
  proffered his arm.</p>

  <p>"The Saxon parlour," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram explained. "The dining-hall is
  draughty, I admit. Only ourselves and my nieces."</p>

  <p>The big bell was still humming as the two passed along. At the foot of the
  stairs two girls in white stood. They were pretty girls, and it required no
  great stretch of imagination to say that they were high-spirited girls
  naturally. But their plain muslin dresses were painfully severe, as was their
  brushed back hair tied with ribbons. There was a painful suggestion of the
  genteel pensioner about them, something, almost monastic, but at the same
  time redolent of the better class of girls' home usually patronised by the
  bishop's wife. One felt that their proper policy was to come in with the
  dessert.</p>

  <p>Still, the bishop's wife, represented in this case by Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram,
  kissed the charity twins in the warmest possible manner, much as if they had
  just come home from the holidays. Mr. Cedric looked on in a fatherly and
  approving manner.</p>

  <p>"Now shake hands with Mr. Merrion," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said. "My dear
  children, how nice you look. My nieces do me credit Charles."</p>

  <p>Merrion muttered something polite and mellow in the mouth. He had a deal
  of humour for a statesman, and he was profoundly sorry for the twins, Edna
  and Phillipa. Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram collected authentic specimens of her
  distinguished family as other people collect old Chelsea and Bow china, and
  once the mark on the articles was passed they were taken to her kindly heart
  in future. The existing specimens had been unearthed five years before, as
  also was the vicar of Caradoc, who had originally been usher of a school in
  Cornwall.</p>

  <p>The twins followed behind meekly and dutifully. The Saxon parlour was
  adorned entirely with old weapons and suite of leather armour. The oak walls
  were rough from the adze, as they had been shapen centuries before. What
  light there was in daytime came from slits in the walls. Dinner was served on
  a round oak gate-legged table at which Richard of the Lion Heart had
  frequently partaken of meat. There were candles in silver branches with
  climbing ferns gracefully twisted about them, and for flowers nothing more
  ornate than white wood violets, dewy and fragrant.</p>

  <p>"None of the vulgar class of flowers here," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said as
  she sipped her soup. "For instance, nothing like the outrageous violets that
  you are wearing, Charles."</p>

  <p>"Do my Neapolitans offend your eye?" Merrion asked.</p>

  <p>"And my senses, Charles. They are redolent of the vulgar ostentation of
  the age. The true fragrance of the blossom has been sacrificed to the size.
  They suggest casinos and music halls and things of that kind. They also
  suggest&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram broke off to critically examine a speck of dust on a
  slim pink forefinger. There was pollution in the touch. Whence had it the
  presumption to come?</p>

  <p>"Cedric, come here," the soiled hostess commanded. "Lift up my soup plate.
  It is within the region of possibility that it has not been properly
  polished!"</p>

  <p>Cedric was profoundly regretful. The candles seemed to take on a funeral
  gloom. On the fair white damask was a circular film of plate powder. Cedric
  contemplated it with grey hairs borne down with sorrow. The iron had entered
  his soul. The twins laid down their forks, mildly overcome. There was a
  decorous silence.</p>

  <p>"It seems a most extraordinary occurrence, Madam," Cedric whispered.</p>

  <p>"It is an extraordinary occurrence," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram murmured. "I make
  no charge. It may be a pure accident. Of that you are the best judge. As a
  favour, may I ask that it does not occur again?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think it could occur twice in this household, Madam," Cedric said
  with conviction.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram waved her plate aside. Cedric bowed before the
  humiliation&mdash;all the more keen in the presence of so poor a statesman as
  Merrion. The latter was wiping his lips gravely, and hiding them at the same
  time. His eyes lighted on the faces of the twins. Veritably it was a night of
  surprises. For Edna winked with almost professional dexterity at Phillipa,
  and the latter flashed it back again with telegraphic ease. It was so sudden,
  so spontaneous, and so grave, that Merrion with difficulty preserved his
  decorum.</p>

  <p>"Did you speak to me, Phillipa?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No, indeed, Mr. Merrion," Phillipa replied demurely. "I should never
  think of speaking unless you addressed me first."</p>

  <p>The girl was chaffing him. Her quiet tones and the droop of her eye-lashes
  told him that. So there were profound depths of humour concealed in the
  'Girls' Home' somewhere.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram bridled complacently.</p>

  <p>"Five years' training here, Charles," she said, "is bound to have its
  effect. My children here will be excellent companions for Kathleen. And yet,
  I recollect the time when Edna used actually to whistle. In this house I
  don't suppose such a thing even a scullion dares to do. Merciful Heaven!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram paused with her jewelled fingers to her ears. The
  startled Cedric nearly went to the length of dropping an entree dish. From
  the hall arose a long, clear, sweet, and birdlike whistle.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; THE COMING GUEST</h2>

  <p class="first">The Foreign Secretary scented comedy. He had a deal of
humour for a mere
  Minister, a blessed gift that rendered even the House of Commons
  entertaining. There seemed to be all the elements of high comedy here. The
  shade of Sheridan would have revelled in it.</p>

  <p>Out in the hall, under the very shadow of the decorous clock, the clear,
  rich whistling went on. Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram turned a cold, critical eye on
  Cedric as if he was responsible for the outrage. The butler shook his head
  with the air of a man who finds a chastened resignation in the decrees of
  Providence.</p>

  <p>"Go and see what it means," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram commanded. "If it is one
  of the footmen&mdash;but that is impossible."</p>

  <p>Cedric felt his way from the room like a Chesterfield walking in his
  sleep. Almost immediately the whistling ceased. There were the notes of a
  strange voice, a very pleasant voice, and clear laughter.</p>

  <p>"Charles," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram whispered, "can it possibly
  be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," Merrion responded with proper gravity, "that it is."</p>

  <p>The door opened as if some strange energy were behind it, and a girl
  entered.</p>

  <p>She was rather short, with a beautiful figure; her pretty face was full of
  vivacity. The restless grey eyes suggested mischief, whilst at the same time
  there was something demure, almost saintly, in her expression. It was a face
  of contrasts, and all the more fascinating for that. The slight figure in the
  close-fitting coat and skirt of grey advanced smilingly and with the most
  perfect self-possession. The light from the candles gleamed on her shining
  chestnut hair, dark or burnished, just as the shadows fell.</p>

  <p>"My dear aunt," she cried, "I am so glad to see you."</p>

  <p>She threw her arms about Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram's neck and kissed her
  heartily, to the speechless admiration of the twins.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I am Kathleen," the newcomer went on. "I got here a quarter of
  an hour ago. I would not let them disturb you as I managed to get a dinner of
  sorts at Castleford. So I thought I could explore this perfect gem of an old
  house. I had just started when that magnificent butler of yours came and took
  me in custody. I fancy he took me for a member of the swell mob. Now, didn't
  you?"</p>

  <p>Miss Kathleen Eldred flashed a dazzling smile at Cedric. All the
  traditions of the house were toppling about the unhappy butler. Kathleen
  dropped demurely into a seat, and unfolded her serviette.</p>

  <p>"Really, I fancy I could eat something," she said. "But, my dear aunt,
  don't have anything brought back for me."</p>

  <p>"Have you no word for me?" Merrion asked.</p>

  <p>Kathleen nodded. Something that turned out to be an eyeglass flashed on
  her silk shirt front. She screwed it into her right eye quite professionally,
  and regarded Merrion with critical approval.</p>

  <p>"Put down that thing immediately," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said. "I desire
  that you never appear with it in my presence, in anyone's presence,
  again."</p>

  <p>"You dear old goose," said Kathleen with engaging sweetness, "I can't see
  without it. And it is so much better than pince-nez. Champagne, Cedric."</p>

  <p>Cedric emerged from the gloomy corner by the buffet. Nobody spoke. The
  petrifaction of the twins was complete. The cause of the cataclysm sat quite
  calmly there, sedately eating an entree, and sipping the champagne that the
  wondering Cedric had poured out for her. He slopped a little on the
  table-cloth, but Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram was too dazed to notice.</p>

  <p>Only the Foreign Secretary was cool and collected. He was interested. To
  hear anybody call his hostess a dear old goose was a sensation in
  itself&mdash;like a showerbath on a hot afternoon.</p>

  <p>"And so you are my brother's child," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said in a hollow
  voice. "My child, where have you been educated."</p>

  <p>"Well, promiscuously," Kathleen laughed. "I always had pretty well my own
  way. You see, Australian girls come out so much earlier than English ones.
  They say I don't look it, but I'm twenty-one, you know. And for the last five
  years I have had the run of Government House, and all that kind of thing. All
  the same, I'm glad to come home. I shall love this grand old place. In my
  mind there is no place on earth like a good English country house."</p>

  <p>All this with an air of perfect self-possession, patronage almost. Merrion
  watched the pretty, animated face with pleasure. Of course, the girl had been
  most abominably spoilt, but nothing could ruin that sunny nature. The vapid
  artificiality of the twins was a painful contrast.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said nothing. The dazed feeling had not left her yet.
  Her exile of seventeen years from society and the trend of fashion had
  rendered her terribly out of date. She had no idea that she was face to face
  with the modern type of girl, and a very good type too, had she only known
  it. But nothing like this had ever crossed the threshold of Caradoc. Edna and
  Phillipa were as near the model of what a young girl should be as their
  relative could make them. Kathleen was regarding them critically through her
  eyeglass. The satisfaction was not all on one side.</p>

  <p>The dinner had drawn to an end at length. The artistic confusion of silver
  and gleaming crystal and fruit on old Dresden made a pleasing spot of colour
  for the eye. Merrion was significantly playing with his cigarette case. It
  was a dreadful innovation at Caradoc, but the mistress allowed it.</p>

  <p>"Children, you can go to the music room," she commanded. "And take your
  cousin with you. Charles, I shall be glad to have a few words with you
  here."</p>

  <p>"What, whilst I smoke?" Merrion asked, fixedly.</p>

  <p>"Certainly. What does it matter for once? What does anything matter after
  the dreadful events of the evening? Charles, what am I to do with her?"</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with the child?" Merrion asked. "She has a charming
  face, and she's pure and innocent, despite her savoir faire. Of course she is
  quite different from those two dolls&mdash;er&mdash;I mean Edna and Phillipa.
  They are perfectly trained. Nobody could imagine them being guilty of the
  least breach of decorum."</p>

  <p>"It is my reward," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said in a 'nunc dimittis' frame of
  mind.</p>

  <p>It was well for the speaker's peace that she lacked the gift of double
  sight. Like a prisoner in moral custody, Kathleen walked to the music room
  between the twins. A long passage cut the music room off from the rest of the
  house, there were two heavy doors between. The passage was traversed in stony
  silence. Kathleen was looking as demure as her guardians.</p>

  <p>The second door closed. A subdued gloom of candles faintly illuminated the
  dark old room. In the uncertain light Kathleen was not quire sure of her
  eyes. But surely the dolls were showing signs of animation. They were
  smiling. Really, they were not bad-looking girls at all, despite their
  ridiculous attire.</p>

  <p>"Oh, we're not wax," said Edna, nodding in a birdlike manner. "If you
  press our young and unsophisticated bosoms, we don't say 'mama' and 'papa' in
  a voice like a penny whistle. Now, ain't we guys?"</p>

  <p>"To be perfectly frank," Kathleen said cheerfully, "you are. But why?"</p>

  <p>"Because we are the models of what young ladies should be," Phillipa
  laughed bitterly. "We are moulded on the best examples of eighteenth century
  samplers. We are nineteenth century monstrosities. Would any modern young man
  look at us? Could the fancy of a girl whose hair is dressed like mine lightly
  turn to thoughts of love?"</p>

  <p>Phillipa pushed back her hair from her forehead and dexterously twisted it
  behind. Before an oval Florentine mirror Edna did the same. The lid of a
  large box ottoman was raised, and therefrom came two evening blouses of blue
  silk, prettily trimmed with lace. In the twinkling of an eye the girls were
  transformed. It was like some enchanting conjuring trick.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's all right," Edna cried as Kathleen glanced at the door. "Aunt
  never moves from the drawing-room after dinner. Nobody sees us except our
  maid, who is in the secret. We do our utmost to be up to date. We get all the
  best of the ladies' papers smuggled in here, and all the recent novels. We
  probably know more of Court and theatrical and society gossip than girls
  really in the swim. Look here."</p>

  <p>Down in the roomy box ottoman were various periodicals and novels.</p>

  <p>"Up-to-date, you see," Edna smiled. "Have you read 'A Curious
  Courtship?'"</p>

  <p>"I wrote it," Kathleen said casually. "It was such fun."</p>

  <p>The twins gasped. It was an evening of delightful surprises. 'A Curious
  Courtship' was 'the novel' of the season. The papers were full of paragraphs
  about it. It had been attributed to various social lights, from Royalty
  downwards. It was political, and social, and daring. The critics were
  unanimous in the praise of its freshness and originality. And here was the
  actual author sitting here as if it was the most natural thing in the
  world.</p>

  <p>"I wrote it for fun," she said, "for my own amusement. Most of the
  characters were English people that I met out yonder. I happened to show it
  to an English novelist who was on a tour, and he said he would get it
  published for me. And when I got to England I found I was a celebrity."</p>

  <p>"I should just think you are!" Phillipa said in an awed voice.</p>

  <p>"But I never expected it," Kathleen said. "It seems such a joke still. In
  London I had people pestering me for interviews all day long. There were lots
  of papers that could never be happy without my photograph. I was asked to
  lecture at three institutions. They didn't seem to mind what subject. And
  everybody who knows me tells me I am a great author. Those good kind critics
  have found qualities in my book that I never expected. They say I have a
  wonderful gift for introspective analysis. It's rather entertaining, because
  I don't know what introspective analysis is."</p>

  <p>Kathleen laughed in the freest and most unaffected manner. It was clear
  that she regarded her new fame in the light of a stupendous joke. There was
  none of the dignity that goes with successful letters about her. She sat on
  the edge of the box ottoman with a smile on her pretty animated face.</p>

  <p>"But I am going to have a rest from those people down here," she said.
  "I'm going to settle down here and become respectable. Now, what do you do as
  a rule?"</p>

  <p>"Mark Twain's diary," Edna said crisply. "Mark Twain's diary sums up the
  daily whirl of our giddy life?"</p>

  <p>"Mark Twain once kept a diary," Phillipa explained. "It consisted in
  writing under each day in painful monotony the information that he got up and
  washed, and went to bed. That is what we do&mdash;get up, wash, and go to
  bed. Nothing expresses our daily existence better than that."</p>

  <p>"That sounds inviting," said Kathleen. "And our dear aunt?"</p>

  <p>"Aunt Maria is one of the best women in the world," said Edna. "If only
  the family dignity was not a madness of hers she would be perfect. There
  isn't a man, woman, or child, for miles round who does not rise up and call
  'My Lady Bountiful' blessed. Anything that her tenants want has to be done.
  And if they won't pay their rent they don't."</p>

  <p>"It's nice to be rich," Kathleen said thoughtfully, as she gazed into the
  log fire with the lights leaping on the quaint blue tiles.</p>

  <p>"She hasn't got a penny," said Phillipa. "Oh, you may well look
  astonished. The house and estates are magnificently administered; we don't
  owe anybody anything. This is a huge house, a perfect storehouse of
  treasures. The Eldred-Wolframs have been accumulating treasures for
  centuries. There is no artistic period that is not represented here in the
  very best examples&mdash;old silver and copper and brass and pewter, old work
  and old china, pictures, prints, engravings. The Wallace collection is no
  finer. And everything is authenticated. Aunt Maria is overdrawn at the bank,
  say; she wants £10,000 or £20,000. She goes into the Saxon wing, which is
  never used, with some snuffy old expert who comes down from London. Then a
  van comes and goes away with a few prayer chests or a set of Cromwell brasses
  or a picture that looks like a study in treacle, and a day or two after you
  see in the 'Times' that so and so has fetched the record price of fourteen
  thousand guineas, and there you are. We don't want the things, they are never
  missed; some parts of the house are packed with them. It's delightfully
  simple."</p>

  <p>Kathleen followed them with the rapt attention of the born novelist who
  has found something quite new and strange.</p>

  <p>"I have a passion for art," she said. "I shall revel in this house. How I
  should like to show a gentleman I met in Australia the place. It was he who
  first awakened my perceptions. He goes miles to see houses like this. Do you
  happen to know the name of Christopher Broadway?"</p>

  <p>"My dear, we know the names of no men except the vicar and Mr. Dennison,
  who is a doctor in these parts," said Edna, mournfully. "We are born to blush
  unseen. You see, we do not possess your monumental cheek. We should as soon
  think of dancing a hornpipe on the lawn as addressing Aunt Maria as a dear
  old goose, as you did to-night. But you are a novelist with an original mind.
  Perhaps you may find some way to pave the path for a social revolution."</p>

  <p>"Have you ever tried yourselves?" Kathleen asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Phillipa said darkly, "we have."</p>

  <p>"Well, hope for the best," Kathleen said. "Now, do you mind relapsing into
  the dolly stage again, and showing me something of the house?"</p>

  <p>By the dim light of candles the manifold treasures were unfolded before
  Kathleen's delighted eyes. The carvings in themselves were a revelation.
  Everything was old, and everything was artistic. There were pictures with a
  history of their own, cabinets of China absolutely priceless. The spirit of
  the ages seemed to tread over those silent corridors. And presently, to add
  to the effect, the notes of a mellowed old organ stole upon the air. The
  whole place seemed to be flooded with a silver melody. Kathleen paused,
  delighted.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" she asked. "What a touch, what expression! A genius!"</p>

  <p>"It is Margaret," said Phillipa, with a reproachful blush. "Edna, we have
  quite forgotten Margaret. Kathleen, you must see no more treasures, do
  nothing more till we have presented you to Margaret."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; "RARE, PALE MARGARET"</h2>

  <p class="first">The lantern clock was staggering decorously towards ten as
the trio
  crossed the hall, Phillipa looked at the moon face regretfully.</p>

  <p>"We shall have no time to do more than introduce Margaret," she said.
  "According to the laws of the Medes and Persians, we retire at ten, though we
  are nearly twenty. At a quarter to eleven you will be expected in the
  drawing-room to make your curtsey to Aunt Maria. If you stay here you will
  probably have to make certain changes in your dress."</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," said Kathleen, with a glance at the dolly frocks.</p>

  <p>"Which reminds me," Edna put in, "a discreet silence as to the evening
  blouses in Margaret's presence would be esteemed. It is an innocent deception
  that we have kept even from her. You would not have been let into the secret
  save in self-defence."</p>

  <p>The silver-throated organ still filled the air with its melody. The twins
  passed before a cell-like door, iron studded, and let into the massive walls.
  It might have been the entrance to a dungeon, Kathleen thought. But as the
  door swung back on its long hammered hinges, the girl stood there with a
  shining delight in her eyes.</p>

  <p>There was something here to appeal to her artistic fancy. A long, low
  room, with a carved and painted ceiling wrought by some cunning hand. Stone
  walls with the marks of ancient chisels still on them, walls draped for the
  most part with figured tapestry. There were a few good pictures of the old
  school, a table marvellously carved, oaken cabinets in exquisite relief, a
  fine place to dream in, and logs blazing on quaint dogs. A swinging bronze
  lamp illuminated the room, and fell upon a perfect pyramid of flowers, not
  the simple blooms of the fields, but blossoms of a grander growth.</p>

  <p>Beyond the room was a smaller one given over entirely to banks of flowers,
  a room half cell, half conservatory, with high painted windows at the sides,
  and at the back of it the organ with the yellow keys, an instrument so
  wonderfully carved that Kathleen could not repress a cry of delight.</p>

  <p>At the sound the player stopped and turned. She was dressed in unassuming
  black, with white collar and cuffs, her abundant dark hair was gathered at
  the base of her neck, in a Grecian knot. Her face had the same clear, pallid
  ivory hue as the keys of the organ, a lofty face full of sweetness and
  purity, a pair of dark, tender eyes, and a brilliant set of teeth. Behind the
  organ stool was a black ebony crutchstick with a silver handle.</p>

  <p>"Margaret," Phillipa said, "we have brought Kathleen to see you. She wants
  to know what relation we are to one another, but I tell her the task is
  beyond my strength. We must go, because it is time good girls were in
  bed."</p>

  <p>The organ player came down from the organ platform with the aid of a
  stick. So lame was she that she came across the room as a wounded swallow
  might have done. She looked so smiling and so sweet and so good, that
  Kathleen kissed her. Here was a girl that she was certain to love.</p>

  <p>"I am going to like you," she said; "I am sure we shall be friends. But
  I'll not say another word till you sit down, Miss&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Margaret, if you please. And you are Kathleen. We will not go into the
  relationship. And I need not say you are in the least like what I
  expected."</p>

  <p>"Don't say you are disappointed," Kathleen laughed.</p>

  <p>Margaret declared with truth that she was not in the least disappointed.
  Only she was a great invalid, and did not go out much, so that she was a
  dreamer of dreams. She looked like some beautiful picture in her plain black
  and white, Kathleen thought. The chastened resignation on her noble features
  told of some great sorrow. It came into the mind of the young novelist that
  Margaret had either lost a lover or formed some hopeless attachment.</p>

  <p>"Do you suffer any pain?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Not now," Margaret said, "I used to when I lived in London. I had a bad
  fall some years ago. Because I was poor I neglected myself. For years I
  managed to get my living by water-colour drawings and the like, Dr.
  Dennison's son attended me, and his father got to know. By chance Sir John
  Dennison, who was attending Aunt Maria for something, asked if I were any
  relation. She came to see me, and carried me down here, where I have been
  ever since. And, Kathleen, I want you to like Aunt Maria. She has her faults;
  her family pride and dignity almost amount to madness. But a kinder woman
  never breathed. You will find that out before you have been here long."</p>

  <p>"I'll try," said Kathleen, encouragingly. "But who, oh why, are the twins
  dressed like funny little inhabitants of a doll's house?"</p>

  <p>Margaret smilingly evaded the point, and Kathleen let it pass. She
  sincerely hoped that Margaret was getting better.</p>

  <p>"I am improving," the latter said. "Strange to say, young Dr. Dennison is
  attending me here. Some two years or so ago a lunatic patient of his shot him
  in the head, and he had to leave London for a time at any rate. As he loved
  his profession and could not be idle, he came and took a share of a practice
  here. When he came first I could not leave my bed. Now I can walk a good long
  way. John&mdash;I mean Dr. Dennison&mdash;has, well&mdash;I have a deal to
  thank him for."</p>

  <p>There was such a yearning expression in the dark eyes, such a wistful
  smile on the lips, that Kathleen gathered far more than the speaker intended.
  With the prophetic instinct of the novelist, she felt that she was on the
  verge of a love story.</p>

  <p>"Is Dr. Dennison a friend of the family?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Bless me, no," Margaret said with the same yearning smile. "Mere doctors
  are not admitted to the friendship of Eldred-Wolframs. But she is a good
  woman, Kathleen, and you must never, never forget that."</p>

  <p>There was a fierce loyalty in the last few words that startled the
  listener. Margaret's long, slender fingers had broken off a spray of azalea.
  And then Kathleen knew that Margaret and John Dennison were in love with one
  another, and that Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram would have died rather than consent to
  the marriage.</p>

  <p>Kathleen looked round at the flowers and the wondrous carved oak
  thoughtfully. She was fond of constructing little romances, of getting people
  out of all kinds of imaginary difficulties. And, as a girl, the unspoken love
  story touched her. What if she were the god in the car appointed to set the
  thing right? She would treat it exactly as the plot of a novel. In that way
  it would go hard if she did not find some way out of the difficulty.</p>

  <p>She came down from the clouds blushing and smiling at her own conceit.</p>

  <p>"Tell me something about the house and its ways," she asked. "The twins
  spoke of you as if you were a kind of mistress here."</p>

  <p>"Well, so I am. I do all the correspondence. It its the strangest
  household in the word. So well ordained, appointed, but so extravagant and
  reckless."</p>

  <p>Kathleen listened eagerly. It seemed a few minutes more the decorous dock
  deigned to inform curious humanity that it was eleven o'clock.</p>

  <p>"All lights out in ten minutes," Margaret broke off suddenly. "My child,
  you must fly."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; THE YEW WALK</h2>

  <p class="first">Kathleen was up betimes in the morning. She was anxious to
examine the
  paradise where her lines had fallen. She saw the grand old rooms packed with
  their treasures, oak and lath and plaster all teeming with memories; she saw
  the grand old half-timbered front, the trim lawns and terraces beyond what
  had once been the moat. It was all so quaint and beautiful, that Kathleen
  could do no more than saturate herself with the savour of it. She knew her
  Scott almost by heart, her veneration for the spirit of age was intense, but
  in her wildest flights she had never anticipated anything like this.</p>

  <p>She was glad to have it all to herself. It was almost with a sense of
  dismay that she saw the double doors in the Gothic porch open and the stately
  figure of Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram emerge. She was dressed precisely as she had
  been the night before, save that she wore no ornaments. She slightly inclined
  her weight upon a clouded cane, but it was evident that she had not the
  slightest need of this support. Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram came along stately and
  smiling.</p>

  <p>"My dear, you may kiss me," she said graciously. "It is a gratification to
  me to see that you love early hours. I always have, and took at me."</p>

  <p>"Oh," Kathleen cried, "you are wonderful, Aunt Maria."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram murmured something about flattery, but she was highly
  pleased. She patted Kathleen's cheek, quite affectionately.</p>

  <p>"That was very pretty and very sincere," she said. "But there, as a
  family, we are always sincere. We can afford to be. But the family traditions
  must be observed. How old are you?"</p>

  <p>"I am over twenty-one," Kathleen said. "I understand what you mean."</p>

  <p>"You are clever. Yes, you have a clever face. And you would resent anybody
  interfering with your freedom of action. Still, if you are to remain
  here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear aunt, I should like nothing better in the world."</p>

  <p>"Another compliment," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram smiled. "Yes, yes. But there are
  certain traditions. I have strong views about girls. For instance, your
  dress. Now, something more in the style of Edna and
  Phillipa&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I couldn't," Kathleen cried. "I really couldn't. Don't ask me."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram froze slightly. She had brooked no opposition in her
  life.</p>

  <p>"All that is here, you share," she said. "After my death it will be a
  different matter. But so long as you are a&mdash;pardon me, dependent
  upon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But I am not," Kathleen exclaimed. "You see there is my book."</p>

  <p>"Book! Child! child! Do you mean that you have written
  a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She paused, overcome for words. She stood, like another Dedlock, before
  the ruined floodgates of society. Kathleen nodded slightly.</p>

  <p>"A novel," she said. "Forty thousand copies have been disposed of, and it
  is still selling. That means some two thousand pounds to me, half of which I
  have. And I have been offered a lot of money for the serial rights of the new
  book. As things go, I am quite well off."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram leant upon her clouded cane with real need of support.
  Here was a new type to her&mdash;a Wolfram who actually wrote novels. In her
  mind's eye the average authoress smoked cigarettes and wore short hair.
  Visions of Georges Sand rose up horribly and grizzly before her.</p>

  <p>"I cannot understand it," she said. "I am bewildered. So that if I ask
  you, if I implore you to&mdash;er&mdash;in fact, become more like
  Edna&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I should decline to do it. I couldn't. With my sense of humour, I should
  pine and die."</p>

  <p>"My dear child, but if I made it a condition&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then I should have to go elsewhere. It was always a consolation to my
  dear, kind, thoughtless father that I should find a home here. And amidst
  surroundings like these one could do the highest, noblest work. I should be
  dreadfully sorry, aunt, but I should have to go."</p>

  <p>The clouded cane bent beneath the weight upon it. It was a clear case for
  the advice of the Foreign Secretary. The vitiated influence of the Commons
  had snatched him from the joys of early rising, so he was not at hand.</p>

  <p>"We will discuss the question again," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said in a
  faraway voice. For the moment she felt dazed and unreal. "You are my
  brother's child&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She broke off abruptly and went slowly towards the house. Kathleen smiled
  unsteadily. There was something pathetic alongside the comedy of it. This
  wide breach of opinion was trying, but to dress like the twins, like early
  Victorian dolls! Not only must she decline anything of the kind, but she must
  do all in her power for the emancipation of the marionettes.</p>

  <p>She turned into a green alley along the side of the house, and thence came
  to a long avenue of yews cropped into the semblance of a solid wall. There
  was a quaint trimness about it that fascinated Kathleen. Goodness knows how
  many centuries this alley had been tended and pruned and shaven. The grass
  was emerald below, here and there arbours had been made in the busy growth,
  like unto havens carved out of solid stone.</p>

  <p>"Never was a glace like it," Kathleen cried. "One could imagine Cavaliers
  hiding here from the Roundheads, or troubadours waiting to keep some love
  tryst. Or revenge standing in the gloom yonder with a dagger."</p>

  <p>Kathleen slipped into one of the arbours. It was quite dark behind there.
  The flashing sunshine made quite a dazzle outside. Then, before she could
  emerge again, the figure of Margaret came into the frame work of dark
  verdure, and almost instantly the figure of a man. He was young and strong
  and dark, with a resolute face, lighted by a pair of steady, kindly, blue
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Dennison for a groat," Kathleen murmured. "I wish they were a little
  further off."</p>

  <p>The situation was suggestive of eavesdropping but Kathleen's conscience
  was clear. The stranger was following Margaret evidently, and pleading some
  cause violently.</p>

  <p>"It would break her heart," Margaret was saying.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so. Hearts don't break so easily. And they managed to do
  without you so long."</p>

  <p>"I know, I know. And yet she saved my life. She brought me, a total
  stranger, down here, she gave me all the heart could
  desire&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And if you had not seen her you would have been my wife by this time,
  Madge."</p>

  <p>Margaret threw up her hand as if to ward off something. Her dark eyes were
  full of tears. Her glance was passionate, yet pleading.</p>

  <p>"I know it, Jack," she said. "And I&mdash;well, I am between love and
  duty. If you only knew, if I only dared to tell you. Can't you trust me,
  Jack, and say no more?"</p>

  <p>There were eager words on the man's lips, but he checked himself. He bent
  over Margaret's hand and kissed it. Then he strode on his way, and was lost
  to the verdant frame. With a hot face Kathleen crept from the alcove.</p>

  <p>"I'm dreadfully sorry," she stammered, "but I could not prevent it. You
  came upon me so suddenly&mdash;Margaret, if I could only help you."</p>

  <p>The pink flush was reflected on Margaret's cheeks.</p>

  <p>"I can trust you," she said. "And I must tell someone. Come and sit here
  by this old dial in the sunshine, and I will tell you a story after your own
  heart. Only it must not be put into a book; it must not be told to
  anybody."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; NEXT TO THE THRONE</h2>

  <p class="first">There was a charm about Caradoc that could not fail to
appeal to
  Kathleen's artistic feeling. Her first successful issue in fiction she had
  regarded more in the light of a splendid joke than anything else; but the
  thoughtful, brooding silence of Caradoc was opening up new fields to her.</p>

  <p>The charm of the old place was falling upon her like a mantle. Her
  imagination was inflamed. There were fresh and original types of character to
  her hand. And there was the pathos and tenderness of Margaret's love story to
  crown all. It would be a glorious thing to write a novel all about Caradoc
  and the people there, and to work it all out to a happy ending&mdash;the
  marriage of Margaret, for instance, and the transformation of the twins. But
  this latter part of the plot puzzled Kathleen exceedingly. She wanted to
  invent some social cataclysm to bring Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram in line with
  modernity.</p>

  <p>"And that you will never do," said Phillipa. Kathleen and the twins were
  seated on the lawn by the big sundial. It was a delightful spring morning;
  the walls of the old house were bathed in sunshine. Beyond the scroll gates
  the road looked like a ribbon of light. "Aunt is not likely to change."</p>

  <p>"Yet she permits me to have my own way," said Kathleen.</p>

  <p>"Because you are independent," Edna urged. "If you recollect, she has no
  power to detain you here. She would never be happy as long as the world could
  point to an Eldred woman getting her living in a vulgar, practical way. She
  hopes that in time you will come to our way of thinking."</p>

  <p>Kathleen smiled as she looked at the twins. They were dressed in white,
  with little black cloaks and straw bonnets, more like the bishop's wife's
  proteges than ever. The twins laughed, too, but they were not in a position
  to appreciate the humour quite so keenly as Kathleen.</p>

  <p>"Prince, prince, come and kiss the sleeping beauty," Phillipa cried.
  "Behold, a noble young gentleman riding along the road. Is he the prince, I
  wonder?"</p>

  <p>"No, it's Reggie Eldred," Edna said practically. "I believe he's coming
  here."</p>

  <p>"A relative?" Kathleen remarked. "And who may Reggie Eldred be?"</p>

  <p>"Why, the heir, of course. Aunt's sister's son. Aunt Lucy, Major
  Wiltshire's wife, was married first to an Eldred, a cousin or something. But
  nobody attempts to understand relationships in this family. Anyway, Reggie
  Eldred comes into all this when Aunt Maria dies. Major Wiltshire is his
  guardian appointed by the Court of Chancery till Reggie is twenty-five."</p>

  <p>"He is coming here," Edna gasped. "He's left his horse at the lodge. I
  fly."</p>

  <p>Phillipa picked up her heels and flew also. They might endure a hard
  world's gaze in white muslin tuckers and stockings, but under the critical
  eye of a young man the charity bonnets were impossible.</p>

  <p>The young man came slowly up from the drive. He was not particularly
  nice-looking, Kathleen thought, but he had a pleasant face and steady brown
  eyes, and that indescribable air that the world over proclaims a
  gentleman.</p>

  <p>"You are my cousin, Kathleen," he said, holding out his hand unaffectedly.
  "I'm glad you stopped when the twins fled. Poor things, I'm not surprised. If
  I had fallen under Aunt Maria's sway, I should still be in a velvet suit with
  a Van Dyke collar. Mr. Merrion told me all about you last night. He broke his
  journey at Castleford on his way to town. And that's why I came to see
  you."</p>

  <p>He sat down quite coolly by the old sundial and poked at the mossy
  crannies with his hunting crop. Really, he had very nice eyes.</p>

  <p>"I am flattered," Kathleen said demurely.</p>

  <p>"Now, don't you get poking fun at me," Reggie Eldred laughed. "Really, you
  know, I am jolly glad you are here. There's going to be a lot of trouble
  sooner or later, and as you are so clever, being a
  novelist&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Naturally, I have a brain far above the average."</p>

  <p>Reggie nodded. Really, he was a very nice young man. There was something
  so frank about him.</p>

  <p>"So I thought I would come and pay my respects to Aunt Maria, and see you
  at the same time. You see it's this way. My mother married Major Wiltshire
  some years ago. The major is a good fellow, but as obstinate as
  the&mdash;as&mdash;as they make 'em. He's jolly rich, and not at all ashamed
  of having a big brewery in London. We were pretty poor before, you know.
  Well, Aunt Maria, who's clean mad on the subject of the Eldred-Wolframs, made
  no end of a bother about it. If my mother had been going to marry the village
  butcher, she couldn't have made a greater tragedy out of the business.
  Wiltshire is pretty touchy, and the last man in the world to stand
  any&mdash;any&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Any nonsense of that kind," Kathleen concluded the sentence.</p>

  <p>"That's the word," Reggie said approvingly. "The consequence is that the
  two sisters are more or less strangers, and once a year the major comes here
  to formally look over the house; he always brings my mother, because really
  the major is a very good chap, and he has hopes of a thorough reconciliation.
  When you see how Aunt Maria snubs him, you will realise that he has a lot to
  put up with."</p>

  <p>"Shall I see it?" Kathleen asked, the novelist side uppermost.
  "Really!"</p>

  <p>"To-day," Reggie went on. "This is the day. I tried to get out of it, but
  they wouldn't let me off. You've never seen Aunt Maria really on her dignity.
  But there is extra reason why Wiltshire is desirous of settling the quarrel,
  if it can be called by so vulgar a name. He's taking a big place close here
  with a view to buying it. And he's set his heart upon representing this part
  of the country in Parliament in the ultra Conservative interest. Now Aunt
  Maria is worshipped by the people about here, and if she sets her face
  against it, the major hasn't a chance. If you, with that polly clever brain
  of yours, can only bring her round&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She will never be brought round," Kathleen said with deep conviction.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid not," Reggie replied, with a baleful eye for the sundial, "if
  she crosses the major's pet scheme there will be trouble. You see, he belongs
  to a new family, and is consequently touchy as to his dignity. If Aunt Maria
  does not formally call, the county is practically closed to him. And if that
  happens, the major is certain to fall back upon a wonderfully strong card he
  has in his hand."</p>

  <p>"This is interesting," spoke the novelist. "The setting for the story is
  perfect, and here is the plot actually unfolding without any trouble on my
  part. Go on."</p>

  <p>"I was going on," said Reggie. "The major only discovered he had the card
  in his hand a few days ago. Now, Aunt Maria only has a life interest in this
  property. During that time she can do what she likes with the income. From
  all accounts, that income has not been nearly sufficient. But there is a way
  out of the difficulty. Caradoc is crammed with treasures of all kinds. From
  an artistic point of view the house would be better without half of them.
  They can be spared. Therefore, Aunt Maria parts with a few from time to time,
  and in a pleasant and easy way replenishes her exchequer. All that is
  wrong."</p>

  <p>"Why wrong?" Kathleen asked innocently.</p>

  <p>"Because they are heirlooms," Reggie explained. "She has no more right to
  sell them than she has to sell the house. My guardian has found that out. Oh,
  yes; there is going to be what the Yankees call a heap of trouble here before
  long."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; "NO BIGGER THAN A MAN'S HAND"</h2>

  <p class="first">Here was the plot that Kathleen had been looking for.
Everything was ready
  to the hand of the novelist. And the setting was perfect. But how was it
  going to end? Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram might break, but most assuredly she would
  not bend. She would insist upon her right to do anything she pleased with
  everything at Caradoc, even at the risk of mutual unpleasantness with the
  Lord Chancellor.</p>

  <p>Reggie had gone in to pay his respects to his aunt and pave the way for
  the momentous interview later on. Usually he did not care to stay to
  luncheon, though the invitation was generally offered him. But on this
  occasion there came to him a dainty vision of a pretty girl with a pleasant
  face and wondrous grey eyes by the side of a mossy sundial, and he complied
  eagerly.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram sat in the drawing-room in frigid state, as a queen
  might do when receiving homage from a vassal province. The twins in their
  virgin white were on either side of her, subdued, not to say gawky. They were
  pretty girls, too, Reggie thought. Dressed properly, they were not calculated
  to remain wallflowers for long. They conversed demurely, with eyes cast down.
  Outside the sun was shining, and a thrush was piping madly on a blackthorn.
  The drawing-room was cold and draughty&mdash;a fitting and proper atmosphere.
  The conversation of the refrigerator was in keeping with its atmosphere. The
  twins rose with a half-hysterical gasp on the part of Edna as the ship's bell
  clanged in its courtly, decorous way.</p>

  <p>"Children, go and wash your hands," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said, as one who
  issues an edict. The twins crossed the room demurely and vanished. The big
  hall was empty as they raced up the staircase and along the corridor.</p>

  <p>"Oh, for something to happen," Phillipa cried. "An earthquake, a
  revolution, something between a civil war and a workhouse. If something would
  only happen!"</p>

  <p>The cataclysm was nearer than the speaker expected. Edna dabbed at her
  hair savagely. She was wondering what Reggie thought of her. All too soon the
  ship's bell rang again. All too soon a subdued company gathered in the Saxon
  parlour. The large butler, haply recovered from the tragedy of the
  soup-plate, presided over the functions in the character of leading
  undertaking. The coffin was not in sight, but the feeling that it was there
  somewhere was strong.</p>

  <p>"Cedric, you may go," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said at length. "Margaret, I am
  glad that you feel well enough to join us to-day. It is very opportune."</p>

  <p>Reggie blushed ingenuously. Kathleen was wondering why he seemed so
  uncomfortable. A reflective flush of a lighter hue was on Margaret's pallid
  face.</p>

  <p>"If you came to see me a little oftener, as you should, Reginald," Mrs.
  Eldred-Wolfram went on, "I should have no occasion to allude
  to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't," Reggie asked imploringly. "It's so, so very&mdash;oh, dash it
  all, have a little consideration for poor Margaret."</p>

  <p>Kathleen wondered vaguely what it all meant. There was some family
  likeness to an adjourned debate in the House of Commons.</p>

  <p>"You know my views," Mrs Eldred-Wolfram went on in the same judicial
  manner. "For the last five years I have designed Margaret for Reginald.
  Reginald must marry in his own family. Nobody can say that I have been unduly
  impatient. Still, up to the last few days I have been content to leave it an
  open question. It was just possible that Reginald might prefer either Edna or
  Phillipa."</p>

  <p>Curious sounds proceeded from the twins. By a merciful dispensation of
  Providence Kathleen maintained her gravity. Reggie's face was a fine study in
  scarlet. He began to wish that he had not been so taken by that winsome
  picture by the sundial.</p>

  <p>"Or perhaps Kathleen," the speaker went on. "I had great hopes for
  brother's child, but from the first moment that my eyes fell upon Kathleen
  these hopes were dashed. I have to acknowledge with pain that Kathleen is
  neither an Eldred nor a Wolfram. She is far too modern and independent.
  Doubtless the atmosphere of the place will not be without effect, but at
  present she is hopeless."</p>

  <p>From the expression on Reggie's face he failed to share the judicial
  opinion. Kathleen felt the carmine rising to her own temples. It was a relief
  when Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram rose at length. Reggie strode into the hall, wiping
  his forehead.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to have a few cigarettes on the lawn," he confided to Kathleen.
  "Nothing less than a dozen will soothe my shattered nerves."</p>

  <p>Kathleen would have followed had she dared, but the late Imperial edict
  had rendered her unusually constrained and shy. Margaret had fled to her own
  room, and was solacing her wounded spirit in a flood of Beethoven's melody.
  In the hall there was a greater show of ceremony than usual. All the footmen
  were in evidence, and all were arrayed in their best liveries. Cedric moved
  amongst them as if he had never sullied a dignified reputation by a dusty
  silver soup-plate.</p>

  <p>It was quiet and subdued in the drawing-room. Upstairs the twins had
  locked themselves in their bedrooms, where they were indulging in the luxury
  of a pillow-fight. They found it a fine antidote for incipient hysteria.</p>

  <p>Kathleen could think out her plot in the drawing-room. So far, everything
  was clear cut, but she could not see far enough. She wanted everything to end
  happily, for Margaret to marry her lover, and the twins to be emancipated,
  and taste the joys of tailor frocks and parties and premieres.</p>

  <p>But Kathleen was still feeling for her scheme when Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram
  entered. She was serene and calm and dignified. She was going to assert
  herself.</p>

  <p>"Aunt?" Kathleen said suddenly, "are you very rich?"</p>

  <p>"My dear, I have positively nothing," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram replied with the
  greatest cheerfulness. "We have always been an extravagant race. When the
  property came to me, there was much to be done. Whatever our tenants require,
  they must have. What other purpose is money made for? And after a time it
  dawned upon me that I had no ready money, and no prospect of getting
  any."</p>

  <p>"That was very awkward," Kathleen said artfully.</p>

  <p>"It was, my dear child. Then I reflected. There were wealthy parvenus who
  craved for old furniture that they could pretend belonged to apocryphal
  ancestors, for pictures to make those ancestors of, and all the rest. The
  house was blocked up with all kinds of useless treasures. Then why not sell
  some of them. The thing was done without the least fuss or bother, and there
  you are. Since then I have never been without money, and I never hope to be
  again."</p>

  <p>"And if you were prevented from selling any more of it, aunt?" Kathleen
  asked.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram bridled.</p>

  <p>"My dear, you are talking to me," she said.</p>

  <p>"It is a liberty, I know," Kathleen said humbly. "But supposing some power
  steps in and says you are not to part with anything more?"</p>

  <p>"If we go so far," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said graciously, "then I should be
  absolutely penniless; the mistress of a noble house with no means to support
  it. But such a thing is absolutely out of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Major and Mrs. Wiltshire," said Cedric, seriously.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram seemed to freeze before Kathleen's gaze. The
  atmosphere grew colder. Kathleen would have fled, but a glance from the
  glassy eyes detained her.</p>

  <p>Well, she would stay now, for she felt that here was the climax of the
  story.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE "DIRK BUTS'" TRIPTYCH</h2>

  <p class="first">Mrs. Wiltshire was a sort of faded copy of her sister. It
was painfully
  evident from the first that she had lost her grip of the family dignity. An
  Eldred of a Wolfram who had in a fit of temporary aberration thoughtlessly
  married a common place type like the major ought to have made up for the
  hiatus by frequent snubbings, but here was a decadent Saxon who not only
  respected her husband, but actually deferred to him in most things.
  Kathleen's photographic eye recorded the fact immediately.</p>

  <p>"You are well, I trust," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram, said, with a frosty peck at
  her sister's cheek and a sigh. To be well under such circumstances was almost
  outrage. "Yes, I see you are. You are very much tanned, and you have actually
  a colour. The same remark might apply to you, sir."</p>

  <p>Major Wiltshire flushed hotly. He was quick and small, with a reddish
  suggestion as to colour, closely buttoned up, trim as to his moustache, a man
  accustomed to command and be obeyed.</p>

  <p>"I'm pretty tough, thank you," he said crisply. "By Jove."</p>

  <p>The exclamation was under his breath, a note of admiration. In his way the
  major was a connoisseur and collector, old oak and china being the small gods
  of his idolatry. The joy of a 'find' in a snuffy back shop was as the new
  star to the astronomer. He had never seen anything like this before.</p>

  <p>"It seems a long time since I last saw you," Mrs. Wiltshire began timidly.
  "Do you know, my dear Maria, we are thinking of settling in these parts?"</p>

  <p>"So Reginald told me. I have no doubt you will find it pleasant. I believe
  that the society about here is quite respectable, though I go to few houses
  myself."</p>

  <p>"Well, you'll come to ours, at any rate," the major cut in suddenly, as he
  ceased ogling a rare bit of old Chinese enamel. "I suppose that's
  settled."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram made no reply for a moment. She could not grasp as yet
  what the man meant. Surely he must know, his wife would have told him, that a
  visit from the mistress of Caradoc was a distinct honour, a precious thing to
  be valued accordingly.</p>

  <p>"It's this way," the major proceeded, absolutely at his ease; "we like the
  place, and the house I have my eye on suits me down to the ground. Of course,
  I knew that you had some prejudice&mdash;I mean objections&mdash;to your
  sister's marriage with me, but one naturally makes allowances for family
  weaknesses of that kind. I don't ask you to be particularly friendly with
  me&mdash;we would be treading on each other's corns all the time&mdash;only
  be fairly sociable, and I ask no more. My idea is to get into parliament,
  and, if you only give me your countenance, and all that sort of thing, why,
  we can jog along very comfortably indeed."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram listened with the air of one who walks in her sleep.
  The maker and seller of a degraded liquid was actually taking things for
  granted. The suggestion of absolute social equality was revolting. He must be
  made to understand things.</p>

  <p>"I had made up my mind not to call," she said slowly. "As a Christian I
  have forgiven my sister her marriage. I shall be glad to see her when she
  likes to visit me. But, forgive me, I could never lend my countenance
  to&mdash;er&mdash;beer. It is not even homemade beer, I am told. Mr. Merrion
  tells me that the makers of&mdash;er&mdash;beer are quite recognised in
  society at present. The fact is beyond my grasp. It seems incredible."</p>

  <p>The major's mouth closed with a snap and clicked open again. A fine
  imperial purple, deep as the lost tint on the Chinese enamel, spread over his
  face.</p>

  <p>"It's a fact," he said. "Oh, Lord, yes. Only we are only allowed in by the
  area door, and take our meals in the house-keepers room. We have to be polite
  to the butler, by gad&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Major Wiltshire choked and gurgled, Kathleen's little white teeth were
  pressed together to keep back the wild laughter that fairly bubbled within
  her. The biting sarcasm was lost on Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram.</p>

  <p>"You underestimate yourself," she said. "A gentleman&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Go on," the major cried, holding himself in hand. "Tell me what a
  gentleman is. I thought I knew, but I am evidently mistaken. Madame, your
  definition will be taken as a priceless favour."</p>

  <p>"With the exception of Mr. Charles Merrion and Reggie, I have not seen one
  for years."</p>

  <p>The remark was made with all the calmness of absolute conviction. There
  was not the slightest intention of any desire to be mistaken on the part of
  Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram that her class of race alluded to was practically
  extinct. She would have said just the same thing to any noble lord sullying
  his pedigree by contact with trade. So to speak she merely swept the major up
  into a crumb tray of a class.</p>

  <p>"Upon my word," the major exploded. "I really must speak, Lucy.
  I&mdash;what the&mdash;what do you call me?"</p>

  <p>The speaker stood erect as a ramrod, the perfectly-cut frockcoat tight to
  his figure. He would have passed as the right thing anywhere, the typical
  soldier of the Army and Navy Club, a popular member of White's, and the like.
  He had his world at his finger tips. Kathleen discreetly intervened.</p>

  <p>"A veritable curio!" she cried. "Who is that white-haired old man with the
  velvet coat coming up the drive?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram glanced casually out of the window. She was utterly
  unconscious of having given mortal offence. She was still pondering mildly
  over the majors conundrum.</p>

  <p>"That is Mr. Evan Pryce, of Castleford," she explained. "A pure Celt, my
  dear, a man with a perfect pedigree. He is a wonderful judge of antiques, in
  fact, he acts as my agent in disposing of my spare treasures. He has
  evidently called about the Dirk Bouts' triptych."</p>

  <p>The major sat down again, or rather he was jerked adroitly into a seat by
  his wife. Rage still gently simmered in his bosom, rage subtly lessened by
  the knowledge that Fate had unexpectedly placed a smooth, round stone in his
  sling. The woman wanted humbling, by gad, and she should get it.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean to say you have the Dirk Bouts' triptych here?" he asked.
  "Why, it's been missing for years. You couldn't sell a thing like that, you
  know."</p>

  <p>"I have yet to learn that there is any power to prevent me," Mrs.
  Eldred-Wolfram said calmly. "There are far too many art treasures here, the
  place is too much like the institutions founded by pill-makers, where
  respectable artisans are allowed to go on Sundays. The income of the estate
  is inadequate, absurdly inadequate, to my requirements. Say I want £10,000.
  As a matter of fact I badly need £10,000 at the present moment. I call in
  Pryce, and tell him the circumstances of the case. He picks out this or that
  treasure, he takes it away, and in the course of a week or so he sends me a
  cheque for the money, less his&mdash;his&mdash;what do you call it?"</p>

  <p>"Commission," Major Wiltshire said crisply. "The deuce he&mdash;I mean,
  does he really? And on this occasion you are going to part with the Bouts'
  triptych?"</p>

  <p>"That certainly is the intention. As a matter of fact, the triptych is a
  hideous monstrosity. I believe that some newspaper man is most desirous of
  obtaining it."</p>

  <p>The major nodded. He began to see his way now. The name of the newspaper
  man who collected works of art was perfectly familiar to him, but that
  mattered nothing for the moment. What did matter was that he found a way of
  bringing Mrs Eldred-Wolfram to her knees. She should respect him, she should
  give him the run of her house and call openly upon her sister, or he would
  know the reason why.</p>

  <p>"Very sorry to do anything unpleasant," he said, "but my duty lies plainly
  before me. My dear madam, much as you may need money, you must not part with
  the triptych."</p>

  <p>"And might I ask," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram began, "what possible business is
  it of yours to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To interfere. Exactly. You must not part with the triptych for the simple
  reason that it is not yours to sell. You have no right to sell it any more
  than I have. As Reggie's guardian and legal protector, being responsible as I
  am for entailed property, it is my painful duty to ask for the list of art
  treasures that you have already disposed of, and to call upon you to refund
  the proceeds to the trustees. I am certain that neither my co-trustee nor
  myself had the slightest idea of these illegal proceedings. I acquit you of
  any deliberate violation of the law."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram rose and made a motion in the direction of the
  bell.</p>

  <p>"Ring it," she said, addressing Kathleen with half-closed eyes. "This
  interview must cease; indeed, it had far better not have taken place. Deeply
  sorry as I am for my unfortunate and unhappy sister&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Neither the one nor the other," snapped the major. "Besides, I'm doing no
  more than my bare duty. These things you are selling are family heirlooms.
  Good heavens, madam, is not your connection with an old house long enough to
  know that heirlooms cannot be sold, even by the holder of the entail? It is
  only done when estates are heavily encumbered, or the entailer is heavily in
  debt, and only then by the consent of the next-of-kin, and under an order of
  the Court of Chancery. The same thing applies even to timber. Of course, I
  can't prevent Pryce&mdash;who, I don't doubt, is quite an innocent
  party&mdash;from taking that triptych away, but I can, and I will, apply to
  the Court of Chancery for an injunction to restrain him from parting with
  it."</p>

  <p>All this fell as a foreign tongue on the ears of Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram. That
  any one, even the august Court of Chancery, would ever dare to interfere with
  her movements she did not imagine for a moment. Nor could she see that the
  major was doing no more than his manifest duty. It was merely an act of petty
  spite on the part of the beer man because the head of the family had not
  taken him, so to speak, to her bosom.</p>

  <p>"This painful interview must cease," she said. "As I said before, it
  should never have taken place. Cedric, will you see Major and Mrs. Wiltshire
  to their carriage? Lucy, you may come and kiss me."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Wiltshire complied almost tearfully. It was more than a farewell, it
  was a valediction. It meant, as plain as words could speak, that the doors of
  Caradoc were closed for ever. From the major's point of view it was a direct
  challenge, which he accepted with martial impetuosity. He would bring this
  vain old creature to her knees. Outside in the hall the little white-haired
  man in the velvet jacket was lovingly hanging over a dim study in treacle
  that the major recognised as the immortal triptych. By no possible stretch of
  imagination could it be construed into a thing of beauty and a joy for ever.
  But there it was. Mr. Evan Pryce bowed respectfully to the major, as one does
  to a royal or profitable customer; but the major saw him not. He was going to
  drive straight to Castleford, on his way to London. He was doing his plain
  duty&mdash;a disagreeable thing, but in this instance a matter that by no
  means rendered itself repugnant to the major's feelings.</p>

  <p>"You're not going to do anything rash, John?" Mrs. Wiltshire suggested as
  the carriage moved away.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," the major said with decision. "It is not in my nature to
  do rash things. I had not the faintest idea that the art treasures at Caradoc
  were being disposed of in this reckless fashion. If I close my eyes to what
  is going on, I become directly responsible."</p>

  <p>"But Reggie would never be so mean as&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear, it is not a question of Reggie at all. Reggie may die, and those
  people at Saltash come into the property. The man there is a lawyer, as you
  know, and if he finds out he would bring an action against myself and
  co-trustee to a dead certainty, and we should have to refund, too. Why, your
  own sister might have to refund as much as £100,000 by her present policy. My
  course is quite clear."</p>

  <p>"But I don't see what you can do, John. Maria is very headstrong."</p>

  <p>"She must be brought to her knees. The Court of Chancery will grant an
  order restraining her from parting with any more of the family property, and
  if she ignores that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She is certain to do so. She will decline to take the slightest
  notice."</p>

  <p>"Then she'll go to gaol, by gad. People of position can do most things,
  but they don't play the goat with the Court of Chancery. Contempt of court is
  a serious matter. Why, not so long ago a duchess was locked up for a spell
  because she defied the court, and Maria will find herself in the same box if
  she does not look out. Of course, I may not be a gentleman&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Wiltshire wisely refrained from further questions, and judiciously
  applied the soothing process to the feelings of her justly irate husband. All
  the same, she was not easy in her mind; visions of an Eldred-Wolfram picking
  oakum in a dungeon cell disturbed her.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps Reggie could settle matters," she suggested.</p>

  <p>"Reggie, thank goodness, has no voice in the affair. Leave it to me, Lucy.
  A good lesson to your sister would be more than a kindness&mdash;it would be
  a positive charity, by gad."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; LADY DISDAIN</h2>

  <p class="first">Kathleen had slipped out into the garden, full of the plot
of her new
  story. Major Wiltshire had given her the very detail she had wanted. Mrs.
  Eldred-Wolfram was delightful; such a charming and picturesque central figure
  for a story. But, of course, 'my lady bountiful' had to be beaten and mildly
  humiliated in the long run, and here it would be unwise to outrage the
  conventional by any 'stagey' trick. The humbling process must be both
  probable and natural. And here Major Wiltshire had kindly provided the very
  thing.</p>

  <p>Kathleen was quite an artist in her way, though she had none of the
  shibboleths of the superior critic at her finger ends. She had crude ideas as
  to introspection and restraint, and all that kind of thing, but she possessed
  feeling, and an eye for colour&mdash;there was nothing of the fretwork
  novelist about her. It seemed to her that the probable action of the Court of
  Chancery fitted in splendidly. She had followed Major Wiltshire carefully,
  and he appeared to have a very good case. If these things were heirlooms,
  then Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram had no more right to sell them than the estate
  itself.</p>

  <p>Altogether, here was the making of a charming romance, with Margaret's
  love story for a tender background. Of course, Margaret must eventually marry
  the man of her choice, both in the fiction and in the flesh. Kathleen smiled
  as a very pretty thought came to her.</p>

  <p>"I'll do it," she murmured. "It is the very thing. I'll see Margaret at
  once. Only I had better not let her know my dark designs. I beg your
  pardon."</p>

  <p>Kathleen had turned out of the garden into the drive. She became suddenly
  conscious of the fact that the little man with the white hair and velvet coat
  was addressing her. She seemed to know that though the picturesque figure
  kept a shop for the disposal of antiques, he was a scholar and a
  gentleman.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, I am sure," he said. "Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said she
  could not see me. I ventured to say my business was urgent, but apparently I
  had chosen the wrong moment. You see when I was in the hall just now I could
  not help hearing what Major Wiltshire said. The major has what you call a
  commanding voice, but that is not the point. The point is that Mrs.
  Eldred-Wolfram is exceeding the powers the law allows her. For some time I
  have been doing the same thing&mdash;quite unwittingly, I assure you. The
  difficulty happened once before with a young gentleman who defied the Court
  of Chancery. Had not Lady Belsize befriended me, I should certainly have gone
  to&mdash;in short, suffered involuntary confinement."</p>

  <p>"The upshot of all this being?" Kathleen smiled.</p>

  <p>"That I must regretfully decline to take the triptych. Mr. Lawson Waddy,
  of the 'Early News,' wanted it badly. Not that he is exactly a connoisseur,
  but he wanted it. He is going to call at my shop this afternoon and complete
  the transaction."</p>

  <p>Kathleen nodded. She had heard all about Lawson Waddy, of the 'Early
  News,' which popular sheet had been evolved gradually from a kind of
  gratuitous trade journal. The secret of the success of the paper in question
  was that on no day in the year was it allowed to lack a big sensation. That
  the sensation was all manufactured in the office and proved to be false,
  mattered nothing. A certain class of people read it with avidity, the
  circulation was large, and after all, there was a certain amount of flashy
  braininess in the conduct of the sheet. To a certain extent Lawson Waddy was
  a gentleman, the son of a country doctor. He copied other people's ideas
  unblushingly, he had a real genius for a good advertisement. For journalism
  in the higher walks he neither knew nor cared anything. The whole thing was
  as a trade to him. He peddled papers as other men peddle soap; he would have
  been equally successful had he taken up glue, or tin tacks, or patent
  medicines, or anything else. He had grown immensely rich of late, and only
  wanted a wife now from the ranks of the aristocracy to make a social footing
  for him.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad he's not going to get it," Kathleen said. "The first time I met
  Mr. Waddy it occurred to me what an expressive word 'bounder' is."</p>

  <p>Mr. Evan Pryce allowed himself to indulge in a smile. "There are certain
  men that one does not like to sell to," he murmured. "The modern rich man who
  buys because it is the thing to do, for instance, but I am detaining you. You
  will be so good as to tell Mrs. Wolfram why I cannot take the triptych away.
  Good afternoon."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pryce raised his felt hat with quite the grand air and shuffled off
  down the road. Here was another character for the book, Kathleen thought. She
  was putting the pieces deftly together when Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram came out
  leaning on the totally unnecessary stick. The trick and stick had both been
  copied from a Wolfram of the early Tudor period, whom the head of the
  household much admired.</p>

  <p>"I have been seeing my steward," she explained. "Quite a disturbing day
  altogether. But I do not fancy that Major Wiltshire will come her again."</p>

  <p>"Under the circumstances, I should imagine not," Kathleen said drily.</p>

  <p>Something in her tone struck Mrs Eldred-Wolfram's ears. Usually the
  sarcastic note was lost on her.</p>

  <p>"Was I too hard on him, do you think?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes. You ask me the question, and I am bound to say yes. Do you
  know, I rather like the major. He has a perfectly honest face, a brave and
  kindly face, and he has a most distinguished career. I am sure that one could
  trust him implicitly. And there was no occasion to tell him he was no
  gentleman."</p>

  <p>"But is he one?" Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram asked, with an air of speculation. "I
  don't recollect saying so."</p>

  <p>"But you did, indeed you did. You actually emphasised the fact. When he
  asked for an example, you said you had seen no gentleman, with the exception
  of Mr. Merrion and Reggie, for years."</p>

  <p>"And of course the man naturally took it to himself?"</p>

  <p>"He could do nothing else. I thought the reply was deliberate. In anybody
  less stately and wonderful than yourself, the reply would have been
  absolutely rude. And you are quite wrong, quite wrong. It is not in the least
  necessary for a man to have a long pedigree to be a gentleman. I have met
  plenty of them down under who have tended sheep, and all that kind of thing.
  I was very sorry to hear you make that remark."</p>

  <p>Had she only been able to realise the fact, Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram was
  feeling small. In the whole course of her life, nobody had ever ventured to
  speak to her like this before, she had never pictured the possibility of it.
  And here was this child laying down the law, and she was actually listening
  with something like humility. But nobody had ever resented anything that
  Kathleen had chosen to say.</p>

  <p>"The man always grated upon me," the elder lady said feebly. "And look how
  he threatened me! But that, of course, was dictated by the meanest spirit of
  revenge."</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," Kathleen argued. "Major Wiltshire has to protect
  himself. He is honestly of opinion that you are beyond your rights in what
  you are doing. If he allows it to go on, he is liable like yourself. Of
  course, Reggie would let it pass. But if anything happened to Reggie, who
  comes in to this property?"</p>

  <p>"A branch of the family in the north. Horrid decadent people who are
  actually in trade."</p>

  <p>"Then they would make you pay; you would have to refund every penny you
  got for the heirlooms already deposed of. The Court of Chancery might even
  ask you to do that now. Have you any idea of the amount of money received
  through the medium of these sales from first to last?"</p>

  <p>Really, Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram had not the slightest idea. The rest of the
  estate was not sufficient for her needs. The tenants were part of her being,
  her beloved vassals. They had only to say it was impossible to pay their
  rents and there was an end of the matter.</p>

  <p>"Then I presume agricultural depression is at a high point here?" Kathleen
  said drily.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram innocently supposed that it was. The tenants of recent
  years had suffered a course of misfortunes quite phenomenal. But what did it
  matter when Caradoc was packed with superfluous art treasures? As far as the
  mistress knew, she might have had something like £200,000 this way; but she
  could not tell.</p>

  <p>"And if the major is right and you are wrong, and the court asks for this
  money to be refunded, do you know what is likely to happen?" Kathleen asked.
  "It is a very pretty plot&mdash;I mean, it is a strange position."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram listened with supreme indifference to this dark
  picture drawn by the young novelist. In all probability the Court of Chancery
  would not order a prosecution; they would accept the plea of ignorance. But
  they would assuredly take over the administration of the estate, let the
  house, and allow Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram a small allowance until the debt was
  paid off or the heir came into possession.</p>

  <p>"And what shall you do then?" Kathleen wound up suddenly.</p>

  <p>"I decline to discuss anything so ridiculous," Mrs Eldred-Wolfram said in
  her best manner. "Your absurd, your undisciplined, imagination runs away with
  you altogether. Let us in go in and have tea."</p>

  <p>Tea was served in a small room at the side of the porch. The twins sidled
  in presently, demure as usual, followed by Margaret, who seemed depressed and
  absent. It was a silent, gloomy meal, and no incident to speak of beyond the
  fact that Phillipa helped herself to cake the second time without asking
  permission. Even Kathleen fell under the gloomy atmosphere, and promptly
  proceeded to lose herself in a world of her own. Phillipa looked darkly
  vengeful at the unconscious novelist who had taken cake and toast
  indiscriminately without the slightest suggestion of disfavour on Mrs.
  Eldred-Wolfram's part.</p>

  <p>There was a long silence, broken only by the velvet movements of Cedric.
  From the open windows came the sound of a distant boom. The boom grew nearer
  and nearer, there was a rattle and a hum besides, then something long and
  shining shot past the window and pulled up before the porch.</p>

  <p>"It is a motor-car," Edna cried, as the stricken heroine of melodrama who
  discerns a sail. "A motor."</p>

  <p>"A motor-car at my front door," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram gasped. "None of my
  friends&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The rest of the sentence was lost. The rest of the party, with the
  exception of Margaret had hurried to the window.</p>

  <p>"Behold the owner," Kathleen cried. "How the bounder must rise up and call
  the inventor of motors blessed. It enables him to wear a huge coat with all
  the fur outside without having mud and broken bottles pelted at him. It
  enables him to swagger and hoot and cause people to look at him, all of which
  must be grateful to his soul. I actually believe the man is coming in."</p>

  <p>He was, preceded by Cedric with his head in the air, as if the smell of
  the motor was rank in his nostrils. In a depressed voice he announced Mr.
  Lawson Waddy, and retired. Kathleen regarded the little man with the
  moustache, a la the German Emperor, not with out a certain admiration. Here
  was the typical bloom, so to speak, of modern progress, a kind of essence of
  'push.' No ordinary man would have found his way into that room, but it would
  have been all the same to Mr. Lawson Waddy if it had been Windsor Castle.</p>

  <p>"Oh, good afternoon," he said, with a certain mincing of his words as a
  concession to society prejudice. "Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram, I presume. I came here
  after seeing Pryce, of Castleford. He has just informed me that he can really
  have nothing more to do in the matter of the Dirk Bouts' triptych. Something
  about Major Wiltshire and the Court of Chancery, I believe."</p>

  <p>"I was under the impression that the triptych had gone," Mrs. Wolfram said
  in a frozen voice. "Please understand, sir, that I have nothing to do with
  these things personally, absolutely nothing. If Mr. Pryce is
  afraid&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Declines to take any risks, quite right on his part. But that makes no
  difference to me. I particularly want the panel, and I am prepared to pay for
  it. If the worst comes to the worst&mdash;but I beg your pardon, ladies never
  understand business."</p>

  <p>"The thing might make a sensation," Kathleen suggested demurely.</p>

  <p>"Why, it's Miss Kathleen Wolfram," Waddy cried. He was quite at his ease;
  Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram's stony glare at him, and her stern disapproval of
  Kathleen's intervention, were absolutely lost. "I had quite forgotten.
  Veritably a day of surprises, for, unless I am greatly mistaken, I know Miss
  Margaret also."</p>

  <p>"My family seems to be fortunate," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram murmured.</p>

  <p>Margaret's pale face flushed. She seemed uneasy and uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"I used to know Mr. Waddy when I was in London," she said. "He was in the
  office of a weekly paper where I used to sell some of my drawings
  occasionally. I fancy Mr. Waddy wrote stories."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and precious bad ones, too," the journalist said cheerfully. "I very
  soon found out that there was more money in publishing than in writing;
  still, they were jolly days, and we had a very happy Bohemian set. Do you
  ever see anything of Jack Dennison now, Miss Margaret?"</p>

  <p>The flush on Margaret's pale face deepened.</p>

  <p>"Dr. John Dennison is here at present," she said. "After his accident he
  had to live in the country. In fact, he has been attending me for some time
  past."</p>

  <p>"Of course he has. It used to be an understood thing in the old Bohemian
  set that you and the doctor&mdash;but discretion forbids me to say more. It
  really would not be fair."</p>

  <p>Waddy smiled in the manner of one born to the keeping of secrets. He saw
  nothing of the painful red that had mounted to the roots of Margaret's hair.
  From his own point of view he was merely making himself agreeable. With ready
  sympathy Kathleen came to the rescue.</p>

  <p>"My dear grandmother, we are wasting Mr. Waddy's valuable time," she said.
  "As the agent declines to take any further part in the transaction, Mr. Waddy
  came to ask you if he can have the triptych."</p>

  <p>"For the sum of £14,000," Lawson Waddy put in diplomatically, or so it
  seemed to him.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram nodded in a doubtful kind of manner. A baleful light
  had broken in upon her, and Margaret's flushed face and painful air had
  coloured the illumination. Could it be possible that Margaret, a full-blooded
  Wolfram, had permitted herself to care for a mere doctor?</p>

  <p>"I must have a little time to think it over," she said, in a hollow
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you would like to look at the triptych," Kathleen suggested
  sweetly. "It is in the hall."</p>

  <p>Lawson Waddy desired nothing better. He admitted with frankness that he
  was no judge whatever of works of art, especially old art. From his point of
  view, the panel was a hideous monstrosity, a nightmare in treacle brown and
  dirty red.</p>

  <p>"But it's the fashion," he said breezily. "And it's not a bad
  investment."</p>

  <p>"Nor would an action in the Court of Chancery be," Kathleen smiled. The
  little man amused her; she could read him like an open book. "The missing
  Dirk Bouts, the injunction, the picturesque house at Caradoc. I can see it
  all highly spiced in the 'Early News.'"</p>

  <p>Lawson Waddy laughed heartily. With his big coat and his high collar he
  seemed to strike a discord in the tune of the grand old hall. The fact was
  not lost upon Cedric, who passed with the afternoon letters on a tray. The
  intruder gave no more than a passing glance at Dirk Bouts.</p>

  <p>"I mean to have it," he said. "You see, I know nothing officially about
  the Court of Chancery. If you have any kind of influence with Mrs
  Eldred-Wolfram, I shall be greatly obliged."</p>

  <p>But the lady in question was already in the hall, with an open letter in
  her hand. She stood there with outraged dignity, trembling in every line of
  her figure.</p>

  <p>"I have heard from Major Wiltshire's solicitor in Castleford," she
  proclaimed. It really was a proclamation. "They give me notice to part with
  no more of the family heirlooms, and they warn me, warn me, that the
  consequences&mdash;&mdash;Mr. Waddy, if you will be good enough to walk into
  the library, I will have my steward sent to you."</p>

  <p>"The triptych is but small," Mr. Waddy said, grasping the point at once.
  "After I have settled with your steward, I can easily take it away in my
  motor-car."</p>

  <p>"Then I shall wish you good afternoon. Come, Kathleen."</p>

  <p>It was a dismissal, a royal wayleave from the premises. Back in the small
  room, Kathleen found that Margaret and the twins had disappeared. From the
  sound of distant music, Margaret was evidently soothing her nerves with
  harmony. Kathleen did not fail to notice that the twins had taken advantage
  of the hiatus to raid the rest of the cake. Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram dropped into
  a chair.</p>

  <p>"A most disturbing day," she said, "on the whole, the most disturbing day
  I ever remember. Really, I might be keeping a shop or something of that kind.
  But my feelings are nothing; I am not thinking of myself. Though I firmly
  intend to show Major Wiltshire&mdash;Kathleen, I want to have a serious talk
  with you."</p>

  <p>"What have I done this time?" Kathleen asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it is not you. I have been very much disturbed, greatly upset to-day.
  And I feel bound to speak to you very seriously about Margaret and&mdash;and
  Dr. Dennison."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; THE JOURNALISTIC INSTINCT</h2>

  <p class="first">A beautiful silence reigned over Caradoc, like the evening
tranquility
  that frequently follows a stormy day. Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram was not to be seen;
  always after contact with earthly things she took what the practical call 'a
  day off' for social purification. Metaphorically speaking, she washed herself
  of the world, she purged her wounded self-respect in solitary contemplation
  of her own greatness. For the next four and twenty hours she kept to her
  room, taking all her meals there.</p>

  <p>To Kathleen the peace and tranquility were exquisite. It was one of
  Margaret's bad days, too, and she kept to her sanctuary, so that Kathleen was
  thrown more or less on the society of the twins. From their point of view the
  peacefulness had its drawbacks.</p>

  <p>"We get it in too large doses," Edna said flippantly. "We live in an
  atmosphere of it all the year round. Sometimes we imagine adventures like the
  girls get in the historic novels. Do you think we are the sort of girls that
  cavaliers on prancing horses would fall violently in love with?"</p>

  <p>"Especially as our dress is contemporaneous with the period," Phillipa
  added.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, their dress to-day was quite normal. Mrs.
  Eldred-Wolfram was out of the way, and it was pretty certain that Margaret
  would not appear. Their young souls knew no trouble for the moment.</p>

  <p>"Let's go for a walk like this," Edna suggested. "Through the village.
  Nobody will know us."</p>

  <p>They set off presently, leaving Kathleen to work upon her new novel. The
  plot was clear now, and Margaret's love story was to be the pretty thread
  holding the whole together. Kathleen fell to with avidity; she worked after
  luncheon and long after dinner; by bed-time the first ten thousand words were
  finished. Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram was down to breakfast the next morning serene
  and tranquil, as if nothing had happened recently to ruffle her serenity. She
  was exceedingly gracious and stately, the twins had not looked so depressed
  for a long time.</p>

  <p>Margaret was down again, looking somewhat pale and ill at ease. She went
  back to her sanctuary directly the meal was over, and for the best part of
  the morning the house was flooded with the melody of the silver throated
  organ. She was lost in Gounod's 'Ave Maria,' as Mrs Eldred-Wolfram, fresh
  from a long interview with her steward, came in.</p>

  <p>The long wail of the melody ceased, and Margaret came down from her seat.
  She still looked pale and downcast, her long slim hands worked restlessly
  together.</p>

  <p>"You want to speak to me," she said.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes. Only please sit down and let us talk over matters comfortably.
  Margaret, do I understand that you knew Dr. Dennison before you came down
  here?"</p>

  <p>"I knew him in my London days very intimately indeed," Margaret
  replied.</p>

  <p>"Then is it not strange that you should not have mentioned the fact to me
  before?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so. Sir John Dennison, Dr. Dennison's father, was a great
  friend of my father's. In those days Caradoc was only a name to me. My father
  was a clever man, and he liked clever society. We knew a great many people
  connected with art and literature, and gradually I began to paint myself. One
  of the best known figures in that set was Sir John Dennison. After my father
  died he was more than kind to me, after my accident his goodness was
  touching. At one time I was pronounced incurable, but John Dennison took the
  case up, and I am what you see. In a comparatively short time I shall be as
  other girls. And it is all due to John Dennison&mdash;and yourself."</p>

  <p>"What did I have to do with it, Margaret?"</p>

  <p>"You found me out, you recognised me as a relative. My work and the hard
  struggle were throwing me back. Your goodness and Caradoc have nearly worked
  the cure. It is exactly the final remedy that Dr. Dennison always
  suggested."</p>

  <p>"So when you came he followed you down here?"</p>

  <p>Margaret's pale face flushed, and her hands were clasped a little more
  tightly together.</p>

  <p>"I cannot permit you to say that," she said with simple dignity. "John
  Dennison was compelled to resign London practice for a time owing to a bad
  accident or something like that at the hands of an insane patient. He had
  decided to come here before you had discovered me."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram murmured an apology. She accepted the statement
  implicitly, she had always lived in an atmosphere where the truth was normal
  and inevitable.</p>

  <p>"Was that&mdash;that man who came here yesterday in your set?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, I suppose so. He has the pushing nature that nothing can put back
  for long. He writes verses and 'smart' stories, and he had a little
  connection with the cheap Press. Seven years ago he was barely getting his
  living. Nobody liked him, but he was tolerated."</p>

  <p>"I see," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said thoughtfully. "When I was in the world I
  met his type occasionally. I suppose he is too rich now to be flippantly
  familiar. In his poorer days I should judge that he called you by your
  Christian name."</p>

  <p>Margaret smiled; this touch of worldly wisdom on the part of her patroness
  was utterly unexpected. And, as a matter of fact, Lawson Waddy had had a
  weakness for the Christian name. Grown rich, that weakness had to be
  modified, or it tended to place inferiors on too high a plane.</p>

  <p>"The man's taste is atrocious," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram went on. "His
  allusions to Dr. Dennison and yourself were deplorable. Of course, there is
  no truth in it, Margaret?"</p>

  <p>The attack was a direct one, and had to be faced. The flush on Margaret's
  face deepened. Not for a moment did she make the slightest attempt to
  prevaricate. Her fingers shook as she played with the petals of a
  geranium.</p>

  <p>"John Dennison and I have been friends for years," she said in a low
  voice. "He is a man of the highest character, and in every sense of the word
  a gentleman. From a worldly point of view he would be a good match for any
  girl. And when he asked me to marry him, I was absolutely happy for a
  time."</p>

  <p>"Till you recognised the absolute impossibility of it, Margaret?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid we are not looking into the matter from the same point of
  view," Margaret said in her low, sweet voice. Her lips were quite steady now.
  "At that time I did not know how great a thing it was to be a Wolfram, and I
  deemed myself honoured amongst women."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram's brows contracted. She suggested a high divine in the
  presence of a freethinker.</p>

  <p>"It seemed that I was singularly honoured," Margaret went on. "Then, when
  the first flush of my happiness faded, I had time for reflection. There was
  I, practically in the grip of a hopeless malady, and I declined to permit so
  good a man to tie himself up to so useless a wife. But John insisted. If he
  could cure me, would I say yes? Aye, I would have said 'yes' with my whole
  heart and soul."</p>

  <p>The last words came low and fervently. Margaret stood with her head thrown
  back, an aureole of scarlet flowers behind her pale, sweet face. Just for a
  moment she had forgotten the presence of her companion.</p>

  <p>A tender love story was told in those few words. A strange sensation came
  over Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram. Daydreams from her own lost youth flashed through
  her mind; there had been a time when Christopher Eldred-Wolfram had been near
  to losing the proudest mistress that Caradoc had ever had.</p>

  <p>"Then I understand that you love him still?" she said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, yes. I shall never change. Now I have told you my story, and
  there is an end of it."</p>

  <p>"But a Wolfram could never marry a Dennison. Sir John Dennison was the son
  of a poor railway clerk."</p>

  <p>"That was very thoughtless of him," Margaret said with a faint, unsteady
  smile. "Still, I am in your hands. Positively, I owe my life to you. You
  brought me from sordid poverty to this; you brought me from a poor room to
  the most beautiful and refined home in England. I did nothing to deserve your
  kindness. And, as to the rest, my future and my happiness are both in your
  hands."</p>

  <p>"You mean that you prefer to remain here, Margaret?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, do not let us misunderstand one another," Margaret cried, with just a
  trace of passion in her voice. "I prefer to follow the man of my heart, to be
  by his side and help him in his life's work. On the other hand, I owe you
  everything, I regard you as a mother. If you say stay, I will stay; but it
  will break my heart all the same."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram kissed the speaker quite tenderly. Not for a moment
  did she realise the sacrifice that Margaret was making. To be a Wolfram was
  everything, a Wolfram could control mere human feelings as no ordinary being
  could do. Margaret would forget this passing folly.</p>

  <p>"I am delighted," the elder lady said, "charmed. Of course, as a friend, I
  have no objection to Dr. Dennison, indeed I have called him in myself once or
  twice. I will write him, Margaret; he shall be free of the house."</p>

  <p>Margaret's pale lips summoned thanks unsteadily. She had known Mrs.
  Eldred-Wolfram long enough to feel the enormous sacrifice she was making. But
  she wanted to be alone now to think. And Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram's victory was so
  complete that she did not care to peril it by any further discussion. On her
  way through the hall she met Kathleen. The girl's eyes flashed like a pair of
  blue interrogation points.</p>

  <p>"I heard that you were with Margaret, so I came in," she said.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said beamingly. "I took your advice. It
  was perhaps fortunate on the whole that that man yesterday said as much as he
  did. It seems almost incredible on the part of a Wolfram, but Margaret is in
  love with Dr. Dennison."</p>

  <p>"Then my worst fears are confirmed," Kathleen said in a shocked voice.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram sighed. She had not the slightest idea that Kathleen
  was laughing at her.</p>

  <p>"Indeed they are, my dear," she said. "Let me tell you all about it."</p>

  <p>They walked together across the lawn, shaven and rolled these many
  centuries. Kathleen listened intently without the faintest suggestion of
  curiosity. It seemed to her to be a very charming and tender story indeed,
  the very background for her own little romance. How the romance was going to
  end she had not yet decided, but she had an idea. If Mrs. Wolfram knew that
  idea she would have been startled out of her high serenity. As it was, she
  deemed Kathleen to be properly impressed with the superiority of the Wolframs
  to the rest or humanity.</p>

  <p>"So you see that Margaret's instincts are perfect," she said with a
  complacency that moved Kathleen to inward laughter. "The race has always
  possessed that great virtue. Of course we can none of us rid ourselves of the
  vulgar emotions, such as love and the like. There was a Wolfram, for
  instance, in the fourteenth century who married the daughter of a hind, but
  it was hushed up. Therefore, I do not blame Margaret because she loves this
  man. But she is not going to marry him, Kathleen."</p>

  <p>"Which is a very great pity," Kathleen said in her direct way. "Here are
  two good and noble souls designed by Providence for each other if ever two
  people were. I suppose that Providence may be permitted to sway the destinies
  even of a Wolfram. Grandmother, you are acting with great cruelty. Margaret
  deemed it her duty to obey you, and inevitably break her heart at the same
  time. You are deliberately condemning her to a soulless and unloved life. Oh,
  you ought to be ashamed of yourself."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram looked at Kathleen with astonished eyes. Never in the
  whole course of her life had she been addressed like this before. She would
  have resented the charge of being a bully, indeed it is probable that she had
  no idea of the meaning of the word. She made a fatal mistake now, a mistake
  that never gave her a grip on Kathleen again&mdash;she protested, instead of
  the policy of silent dignity.</p>

  <p>"Really, you make me out quite a monster," she said. "I have done nothing
  wrong. The family&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What has posterity done for me?" Kathleen laughed, quite good-humouredly
  again. "I declare that you are the most ridiculous old goose in the
  world."</p>

  <p>Goose! Ridiculous! Was the world coming to an end? Were the pillars of
  society being snapped? At the scared look on her companion's face Kathleen's
  mind thought of Sir Leicester Dedlock and his favourite simile. Just for the
  moment Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram was routed, horse and artillery.</p>

  <p>"My dear," she implored, "let me ask ask you one favour!"</p>

  <p>"A dozen if you like," Kathleen said sweetly. "What is it?"</p>

  <p>"If you have any respect for me, any feeling for the traditions of the
  family, say nothing of this to the twins. I suppose it is not altogether your
  fault that you are so republican. Now the twins are quite different, so
  simple and unsophisticated. You won't&mdash;won't contaminate them?"</p>

  <p>Kathleen promised that the lives of the twins should not be blighted by
  her poisoned influence. They were unusually demure at luncheon, so demure
  that Kathleen scented mischief in the air. Margaret had not come in; she had
  remained in her own room under plea of a headache. A walk in the grounds with
  the twins after luncheon killed a little of the passing time, until the
  sudden and unexpected appearance of Reggie Eldred coming up the drive. Edna
  regarded her print dress with a deep sigh.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't he come yesterday?" she said, with the air of one who has a
  substantial grievance. "Then he would have seen us in all our glory. Phillipa
  with her pretty hair dressed in Christian fashion, myself in a green coat and
  skirt. We passed through the village and nobody recognised us. If Reggie had
  come yesterday, he must have proposed to one of us."</p>

  <p>"Or perhaps both of us," Phillipa suggested in a sanguine spirit.</p>

  <p>"Then we could have tossed for him. Kathleen, I'm going. In this get-up,
  under the broad canopy of heaven, I could not sit and make myself agreeable
  to an eligible young man. Exit Edna."</p>

  <p>"And Phillipa, left upper entrance," Phillipa cried gaily. "Kathleen, lure
  him on to stay to dinner. Then in our sacred hour afterwards we could dress
  up and astonish him. Try."</p>

  <p>"I will," Kathleen laughed. "If those smart blouses of yours are without
  effect, why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But the twins had vanished. Reggie came moodily up the drive, slashing his
  big boots with his stick. From the dirt on his boots he had evidently walked
  over. The moody frown between his straight brows vanished as he caught sight
  of Kathleen and came forward.</p>

  <p>"The twins fled at your approach," she said. "It was very bad taste."</p>

  <p>"And a very good job," said Reggie coolly. "It was you I came to see. You
  are the only one in the house who seems to have any common sense."</p>

  <p>"Terse, vigorous, and no doubt meant to be complimentary," Kathleen
  laughed.</p>

  <p>"My dear girl, it's no laughing matter," Reggie said seriously. "I told
  you there would be an explosion when the opposing forces met, and so there
  was. But, of course, you were present. Now don't laugh. Still, I suppose it
  was very funny, even from the Major's description of it."</p>

  <p>Kathleen proceeded to give a trenchant account of the interview. Reggie
  was amused in spite of himself.</p>

  <p>"And therein lies the sting," he said thoughtfully. "But it was a bit too
  bad to tell the poor old chap that he was not a gentleman, because it isn't
  true. And then again he must go and play the martinet over those pictures and
  things, instead of approaching the subject in a diplomatic way. If he had
  done so, I am quite sure our dear old relative would have listened in a
  proper spirit."</p>

  <p>"Not she," Kathleen replied. "Mark my words, Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram is going
  to get herself into trouble. If Major Wiltshire goes for an
  injunction&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why, he's got it, got it yesterday," Reggie exclaimed. "Mrs.
  Eldred-Wolfram is sure to have had the papers by the second post. The Court
  granted the injunction at once, restraining our gracious lady from parting
  with anything else in the house without the consent of all and sundry
  concerned in the property. And a proper fuss there was over something called
  a triptych&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not the Dirk Bouts' triptych?" Kathleen cried.</p>

  <p>"That's the joker. It appears that some newspaper chap got hold of it a
  day or two ago, and he was represented in Court yesterday. The Major swears
  that he'll have the trip something or other back, and the proprietor of the
  'Early News' looked like getting a fine advertisement out of it. They have
  made three columns out of it in the 'Early News' to-day; in fact, I've got a
  copy of it in my pocket."</p>

  <p>Kathleen held out her hand eagerly.</p>

  <p>"The spirit of journalistic enterprise," she laughed. "Let me have a look
  at it. Or, better still, read it aloud. How nice a thing it is to have fame
  thrust upon you."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; THE WARWICK CUP</h2>

  <p class="first">From the connoisseur's point of view the 'Early News' was
not an
  attractive sheet. The first page boasted a drawing usually depicting some
  repellent crime, the details and local colour being left to the artist. The
  mere fact that a murder scene was frequently portrayed long before the police
  had a clue to the assassins counted for nothing. The paper itself was
  atrocious, the articles were vulgar and personal, and in the worst of taste.
  If Lawson Waddy could have raised his circulation by making the 'Early News'
  still more vulgar he would not have hesitated to do it. The thing paid, and
  the rest mattered nothing.</p>

  <p>"Beautifully adapted to a public-house isn't it?" Reggie asked as he
  opened the sheet. "It's all here on page five. 'The Grande Dame and her
  Treasures! The missing Dirk Bouts' triptych comes to light! Purchased for
  £14,000 by the Proprietor of the 'Early News!' The Trustees of the Caradoc
  Estate Intervene! Proceedings in the Chancery Court to-day!' You can imagine
  the rest."</p>

  <p>"I am acquainted with lurid colonial rags," Kathleen said. "Get to the
  gist of it."</p>

  <p>Reggie proceeded to read. The legal details were somewhat dry, but, under
  the circumstances, interesting. Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram had not been represented,
  but that mattered little. A well-known K.C., acting on instructions from the
  trustees of the Caradoc Estate, had applied to the Court for an order to
  restrain Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram from disposing of any of the heirlooms of
  Caradoc. In support of the application Major Wiltshire had given evidence. He
  had only recently discovered the fact that Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram had been
  supplementing her income by disposing of certain heirlooms. As a matter of
  duty and for his own protection, he had applied to the Court for an
  injunction. He had made the discovery over the Dirk Bouts' triptych, which he
  had given Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram instructions not to dispose of.</p>

  <p>In spite of this she had persisted in disposing of the unique work of art
  in question for £14,000 to the editor and proprietor of the 'Early News.'
  Counsel understood that Mr. Lawson Waddy was represented in Court, and was
  prepared to resist the suggestion that he should restore the triptych to the
  trustees and obtain a refund of the money. That matter, however, would be
  argued later on. All the trustees wanted for the moment was an injunction to
  restrain these sales in the future, and for a schedule of the protected
  property.</p>

  <p>The K.C. representing Mr. Lawson Waddy interposed. Unless the Court so
  ordered it, his client had no intention of parting with the triptych. He had
  purchased the picture in open market, and was quite an innocent party in the
  matter.</p>

  <p>Eventually the Court made the order applied for, certain specific
  treasures of historic interest being mentioned.</p>

  <p>Reggie put down the paper and asked Kathleen if she was interested.</p>

  <p>"Of course I am," she said. "From your manner there is something more to
  come."</p>

  <p>"The sting is in the tail, as usual," Reggie said. "Once this kind of
  thing gets fairly going, there seems to be no end to the lawyers engaged in
  it. On behalf of the Saltash branch of the family, yet another K.C. shoves
  his oar in. Failing me, the property, you know, goes to the Saltash branch
  people, and naturally they are interested. They want Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram to
  render account of the treasures already disposed of, and the money handed
  over to the trustees."</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" Kathleen cried. "Why that would amount to nearly a quarter
  of a million, every penny of which has been spent long ago. As you know, the
  state at Caradoc is semi-regal. And I am quite sure that Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram
  has acted innocently."</p>

  <p>"Of course she has," Reggie said, thoughtfully contemplating the tragedy
  on page one. "If I had my way I should say nothing at all. But I have no more
  to do with it than yourself. Anyway, the Court made the order asked for by
  the Saltash people's lawyer."</p>

  <p>"Reduced to plain English, what does it all amount to?"</p>

  <p>"Reduced to plain English, it amounts to this. Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram will
  have to render a faithful account of all the heirlooms she has disposed of
  and the amount for the whole. When that is done she will be compelled to hand
  over the amount to the trustees, plus about four per cent. interest."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear Reggie, the thing is impossible. The money is spent."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that argument will not go down with the Court of Chancery. If
  the money has gone, there is an end of it, and nothing will bring it back.
  What the Court will probably do is this&mdash;order the offender to pay back
  a stated amount out of income. They will direct the trustees to pay Mrs.
  Wolfram, say, £1000 a year, and take the rest as a refund. Also they will
  probably let Caradoc for a term of years, so Major Wiltshire says. Much the
  same thing happened over the Waldinghurst estates, and that is what took
  place there."</p>

  <p>Let Caradoc! Allow Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram £1000 a year! Kathleen's lively
  imagination staggered at the prospect. It practically meant the
  workhouse.</p>

  <p>"But this is dreadful, Reggie," she said. "Major Wiltshire has gone too
  far."</p>

  <p>"I don't see that the Major is in the least to blame," Reggie said, with
  the man's finer sense of justice. "Please don't imagine that he is in the
  least vindictive over the matter. If Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram had received him
  with open arms he would have acted in just the same way."</p>

  <p>Kathleen thought of the Major and his quick, clear eyes, and decided that
  Reggie was right.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram knows this?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course. I have not the slightest doubt that she knew yesterday.
  Probably a special messenger brought down the order yesterday, and probably
  it was thrown regally into the fire."</p>

  <p>"And if it is disobeyed, Reggie?"</p>

  <p>"Well, in that case, our gracious queen here will find herself in a tight
  place. That would be the grossest contempt of Court, the one thing that even
  the rich and powerful cannot evade. It would simply mean going to Holloway
  Gaol until the offender had purged his or her contempt. Under such
  circumstances as these, the sentence would not be less than three
  months."</p>

  <p>Kathleen tried to grasp it and failed. Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram a prisoner, the
  mistress of Caradoc actually the occupant of a common cell in an ordinary
  gaol! The imagination could not picture it; that and scrubbing floors, and
  eating gruel off a tin plate.</p>

  <p>"Does Mr. Waddy mention it in a leader, or anything like that?" Kathleen
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Waddy has not let the grass grow under his feet, you may be sure of
  that. On another page is a more or less villainous cut of the triptych, with
  a full history of it, mostly apocryphal. Also, it is announced that
  reproductions of the famous work will be ready shortly, £10 10s on India
  proof paper and a limited number on ordinary paper at £4, payable in so many
  monthly instalments of so much each. Modern journalism seems to be a fearful
  and wonderful thing."</p>

  <p>"There seems to be a kind of smaller article on art treasures here,"
  Kathleen said, as she held up the lurid sheet as if there was something
  poisonous about it. "The Warwick Cup is mentioned here. Didn't Cedric tell me
  something about that piece of plate?"</p>

  <p>"I daresay he did," Reggie replied. "Anyway, it's in the house, or was,
  though, perhaps, that has been disposed of. After the Battle or Towton in
  1461, King Edward IV. had that cup made and presented to Warwick, who
  subsequently gave it to an ancestor of ours. Apart from its artistic by the
  fact that Warwick scratched his monogram on the bottom of the cup and a
  doggerel verse as well. You must get Cedric to show it you."</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is priceless?" Kathleen asked.</p>

  <p>Reggie made no reply. He was looking at something approaching through the
  shrubbery.</p>

  <p>"Do I sleep, do I dream, or are visions about?" he quoted. "Kathleen, who
  are these?" Through the bushes came the figure of Edna, closely followed by
  that of Phillipa. They were attired in coats and skirts of neat heather
  mixture, sweeping black hats with feathers. The transformation was
  marvellous. There was a suggestion of laughter in the eyes of both, otherwise
  they were perfectly serious.</p>

  <p>"Will you kindly introduce me?" Reggie said, gravely. "Delighted to meet
  you. Do you happen to have seen anything of Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram lately?"</p>

  <p>Edna laughed aloud. Really, they were very pretty girls, once out of their
  hideous frocks and bonnets. Phillipa seemed to be equally delighted.</p>

  <p>"We are not dense," she said, "despite the simplicity of our upbringing;
  an innocent can gather things at times. All our lavish pocket-money does not
  go in coals and red blankets of a horribly ticklish description, as our fairy
  godmother fondly imagines. Kathleen, considering that the genius who built
  our gowns worked from self-measurement, has he not done splendidly?"</p>

  <p>"The Park would be the richer for your presence," Kathleen laughed. "But
  Reggie put you a diplomatic question just now that you have failed to
  answer."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram has gone calling. Something early yesterday or
  to-day has touched her dignity. She has gone with the best barouche and the
  bays to call on Lady Leydonmere. Together they will discuss the crumbling
  fabric of society, and decide that they are the only two ladies left. Hence
  our temporary emancipation from the Bishop's orphanage. Now, honestly,
  Reggie, as a man who knows something of the world, are we, or are we not, two
  pretty girls?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;er&mdash;on the whole, I think you are," Reggie said,
  critically. "I should not be in the least displeased if I had you at
  Hurlingham or at Oxford in the May term; in fact, I should be rather proud of
  you, and very much disappointed if I did not become exceedingly popular with
  the undergraduates. Why don't you rebel? Why not strike out a line for
  yourselves? Look at Kathleen."</p>

  <p>"We frequently do," Edna said, admiringly, and with envy. "Kathleen is so
  great that she amounts almost to an institution. Her calm, native assurance
  is monumental. The first night she came here she whistled!"</p>

  <p>"And Cedric is supposed to have a weak heart," Reggie exclaimed. "What
  happened?"</p>

  <p>"Why, nothing. Kathleen had firmly established herself before the
  temporary paralysis had passed off. She calls our god-mother a silly old
  goose, and she puts up with it. I fancy if we only dared to make the plunge
  we might win some sort of concession to popular prejudice."</p>

  <p>"You shall begin to-night," Kathleen exclaimed. "If Reggie will stay to
  dinner and back me up, the first of the fetters shall be struck from your
  jaded limbs. With what you possess, and what I can find, I'll dress you both.
  Hair just a little simpler, a silk blouse, with a suggestion of throat and
  chest showing, a few flowers. Then we can work by easy stages up to an
  evening frock. If you will be guided by me in the matter, I am sure that I
  can help you."</p>

  <p>The twins beamed with mischievous delight. Reggie listened with a
  flattering interest. He had more than half a mind to stay and witness the
  success of the experiment. One of the men from the stables could ride over to
  Castleford and procure his dress clothes, so that he could stop the
  night.</p>

  <p>"Come along, then," Edna cried. "Come into the library and write the note
  before you change your mind and flee from the wrath to come. As for me, give
  me liberty or give me death."</p>

  <p>Kathleen passed into the house a little more sedately than the others. The
  girls, by great good fortune, just escaped detection at the hands of Cedric,
  who came into the great hall with a tray of old silver on a salver. Kathleen
  stopped to admire, and the butler so far committed himself as to smile.
  Kathleen was an outrage at Caradoc, a something out of keeping with the
  sedate solemnity of the house, but Cedric, like everybody else, had fallen
  under the charm of her manner.</p>

  <p>"There is no silver like ours in England," he said. "Some day when I have
  time, miss, I should like to show you our plate. Most of it historic, all of
  it unique. Why, it's a pleasure to have the cleaning of nearly all the stuff
  under my care."</p>

  <p>"There is one piece I should like to see now, if I may," Kathleen smiled.
  "Would you mind just letting me have a peep at the Warwick Cup?"</p>

  <p>Cedric's large manner gave way to a look of deep dejection. It was as if
  Kathleen had unwillingly touched a tender chord, as if a mother had been
  suddenly reminded of a lost child.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry I can't do it, miss," the butler said. "It's the one piece I
  valued most. And Lord only knows what it is worth. But only last night my
  mistress asked for it. When it occurred to me that it might be for sale a
  cold perspiration broke out all over me. I actually dropped one of the
  Venetian tumblers and broke it."</p>

  <p>"A dignified protest, perhaps, Cedric," Kathleen suggested.</p>

  <p>"Not to my mistress, though I was very near to it. But perhaps I am giving
  myself a deal of unnecessary anxiety."</p>

  <p>Kathleen went off in a thoughtful frame of mind. The dressing up of the
  twins was not nearly so amusing as she had expected it to be, and when the
  dinner hour drew near they had become nervous and dejected. Kathleen rallied
  her forces and went downstairs as the ship's bell tolled its solemn knell.
  Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram was already in the drawing-room talking to Reggie. She
  was in a haughty mood, and stared through her glasses severely as she caught
  sight of the blushing twins.</p>

  <p>"And what may the meaning of this be?" she demanded. "White lace skirts
  with trains and bronze shoes. And lace blouses open at the neck. Who is
  responsible for this&mdash;this&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't say outrage," Kathleen smiled. "It's so hackneyed. Place all the
  blame on my shoulders. Pour on, I will endure. My dear godmother, I have
  simply transformed two dolls into pretty girls, who look exceedingly nice and
  refined and well bred."</p>

  <p>"Can't be the slightest question about it," Reggie said boldly.</p>

  <p>"Now, don't be a ridiculous old goose," Kathleen cut in, kissing the
  outraged lady affectionately. "I am sure that you are greatly pleased in your
  heart."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said nothing, though she was all the more convinced
  something was seriously wrong with the fabric of society. Here was
  Margaret&mdash;rare, pale Margaret&mdash;giving her affections to a mere
  doctor and now the twins had been transformed from their Arcadian simplicity
  into conventional young ladies. They would be asking for bicycles next, once
  this innovation was passed.</p>

  <p>The bell tolled again, and Cedric solemnly announced dinner, much as an
  undertaker would have proclaimed the fact that the funeral cortege was ready
  to proceed. Conversation was fitful, the twins keeping very much in the
  background, as if fearful of a reaction of the tacit edict sanctioned by Mrs.
  Eldred-Wolfram's silence. Kathleen was thinking of the Warwick Cup and the
  consequences to the hostess if she had parted with that treasure. A remark
  about some quaint old silver led up to it.</p>

  <p>"I am curious to see the Warwick Cup," the girl said. "I asked Cedric this
  afternoon, but he said that it had temporarily left his possession. May I see
  it?"</p>

  <p>"It is unfortunate that you did not ask before," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said
  in her largest manner. "I was told not to part with it, I was threatened.
  Immediately, I placed those papers on the fire, immediately I telegraphed to
  a kind of foreigner&mdash;an American&mdash;who had made an offer previously.
  Cedric!"</p>

  <p>Cedric had forgotten himself, and groaned. One word came from his lips
  distinct and clear.</p>

  <p>"I'm only human," he muttered, with bowed head. "It was 'Good Lord' that I
  said, madame."</p>

  <p>"I am aware of it, Cedric. Your feelings do you credit, but I will ask you
  not to express them again in that manner. The American man was here early
  to-day, and renewed his offer. Whether it was £20,000 or so many guineas I
  don't know."</p>

  <p>"And you parted with the Cup?" Reggie said, forgetting his manners. "You
  sold it?"</p>

  <p>"As a means of asserting my authority, yes. The Warwick Cup has passed out
  of the family."</p>

  <p>The speaker looked around her. She had desired to make an impression. And
  in the minds of two of her hearers at least she had succeeded beyond her
  wildest expectations.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; "THERE'S A DIVINITY DOTH HEDGE A KING."</h2>

  <p class="first">"Great minds," Edna said sententiously, "rise to great
occasions. The
  remark may not be original, but there is a thoughtful flavour about it. This
  is a great occasion. Look here."</p>

  <p>A score of wax candles made subdued light in the dressing-room given over
  to the twins. It was the hour before dinner, and they were decking out in
  vestal robes for the occasion. Edna held up a black dress all filmy with
  lace; there was an atmosphere of Paris about it.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it a wee bit too sudden?" Phillipa said doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," Edna said, holding out the skirt admiringly. "Last
  night the bare arms stage was allowed to pass. You see our godmother has a
  deal to occupy her attention just at present. There is her lecture to the
  Lord Chancellor, for instance."</p>

  <p>Phillipa smiled. During the last day or two Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram had become
  celebrated beyond the domains of Caradoc. It is not very often that the Court
  of Chancery finds itself so deliberately defied as had happened in the case
  of Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram and the Warwick Cup. Mrs Eldred-Wolfram had thrown
  down the gauntlet, and she had waited calmly for a tyrannous legal tribunal
  to pick it up, much as an ancestor of hers had once defied the Star
  Chamber.</p>

  <p>A day or two passed and nothing had happened. The delighted owner of the
  Warwick Cup had omitted to tell his secretary of the transaction,
  consequently a valuable piece of gossip had not reached the Press. From Mrs.
  Eldred-Wolfram's point of view this was timidity on the part of Chancery. But
  the paragraph came at length; it was copied, and amplified, and discussed,
  and finally it had come to the ears of the Saltash branch of the family. Then
  there were notices and motions and the like, and a pressing request on the
  part of the Chancellor that Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram should stand before him on a
  certain day to answer that inasmuch as she&mdash;but the legal jargon is
  immaterial.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram perused the verbose document with a certain calm
  dignity worthy of her. She would not attend. Why should she trouble about
  Lord Stourmouth. Why, he had been no more than a junior clerk in a lawyer's
  office at one time. Still, it might be just as well to allow her lawyers to
  see the summons. All this she imparted to the twins and Kathleen to their
  boundless admiration. But the reply from the eminent firm of lawyers in
  Lincoln's Inn had changed everything.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram had suddenly grown quiet and distrait; she seemed to
  have something on her mind. And to-morrow was the day for the interview with
  Lord Stourmouth. Later in the afternoon she had telegraphed to Mr. Charles
  Merrion to come and see her, and he had replied that he was coming down to
  dinner.</p>

  <p>Hence the suggested opportunity for the complete emancipation of the
  twins. Greatly daring, they had ventured upon bare arms the night before.
  They might have appeared in a fancy dress costume for all the notice Mrs.
  Eldred-Wolfram took of them. Her mind seemed to be far away. Cedric spilt two
  drops of claret on the table-cloth and the crime passed without punishment.
  Cedric, too, seemed to share the grave preoccupation. The only one of the
  party who appeared to have any knowledge of the subject was Kathleen, and she
  had got her information second-hand. Reggie and the Major were away in
  London, though Reggie had telegraphed for permission to come over to dinner
  that same night, and Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram had smiled for the first time during
  the day.</p>

  <p>"A cloud hangs over the fortunes of the house," Phillipa said. "Our
  godmother is going to be sacrificed to satisfy a brutal judicial system. If
  she wanted to sell that stupid old cup, why shouldn't she? Still, her mind is
  not quite easy; she never heeded when I used a spoon with my entree at
  luncheon. On the whole, I shall venture on my yellow dress."</p>

  <p>The yellow dress was a little more chic than Edna's black one. Once the
  girls were dressed they looked at one another with critical, admiring eyes
  that had just a suggestion of defiance in them. The bell had sounded, but
  they still hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Who is going into the drawing-room first?" Edna asked.</p>

  <p>"Your well-known firmness and strength of character," Phillipa began, "and
  your&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, nonsense. I might suggest your superior sweetness and charm. Let's
  toss up for it. Your call."</p>

  <p>Phillipa called heads and lost. In the drawing-room the guests had already
  arrived. Mrs Eldred-Wolfram was seated in a low chair, shading her eyes from
  the light with a screen. Kathleen and Reggie were opposite her, whilst the
  Honourable Charles Merrion had taken up a forensic attitude with his back to
  the fire.</p>

  <p>"The point is this," he was saying. "The point is this. For the moment we
  have nothing whatever to do with your legal rights and liberties. The Court
  has decided in its wisdom to&mdash;Good heavens!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Merrion pulled up sharply as the visions in black and yellow broke in
  upon his eyes. Those were the demure twins, no doubt, though he would not
  have recognised them anywhere else. Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram followed the gaze of
  her distinguished guest sadly.</p>

  <p>"Don't blame me," she said, with pious resignation. "Kathleen is the
  culprit. Foolishly, I gave her an inch, and she has taken an ell. I give up
  the modern girl, she is beyond me. I suppose it is all right, and I hope it
  is quite respectable."</p>

  <p>Mr. Merrion was understood to say that he saw no outrage of the
  proprieties. Also he told himself that he had no idea the twins were so
  pretty. He would have congratulated Kathleen had he found an opportunity of
  doing so. Being the polished man of the world he was, he turned the
  conversation into another channel. Cedric came in with the announcement of
  dinner.</p>

  <p>It was a perfect dinner, beautifully served and cooked to perfection, but
  Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram ate nothing. Again and again she referred to the morrow.
  She had abandoned all idea of defying the law, at which Mr. Merrion nodded
  approval.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I shall be asked to express my regret," she asked. Merrion
  glanced at Cedric, the only servant in the room by this time.</p>

  <p>"Cedric knows everything," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram went on. "Cedric is
  distinctly one of the family. I should not hesitate to discuss anything in
  his presence."</p>

  <p>Cedric coughed his approval of this praiseworthy sentiment. He stood
  behind the chair of his mistress now with the air of a faithful adviser
  thoughtfully imported into an important family discussion.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that will not do," Mr. Merrion went on. "You don't seem to
  understand that you have committed the grossest contempt of Court. Even a
  judge is human, and in this case you have touched the personal dignity of the
  Court. They order you to do a certain thing, and you deliberately defy
  them."</p>

  <p>"If I express my regret, and undertake in the future not
  to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that will not do. If you could obtain possession of the Cup
  again&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That will be asking a favour&mdash;a favour of a foreigner, a sort of
  American. Quite a dreadful person, I assure you. I had no idea Major
  Wiltshire could be so vindictive."</p>

  <p>"I assure you the Major has had nothing to do with the matter," Reggie
  said hastily. "It is the Saltash people who are moving. I hardly like to say
  it, but they will press for an extreme penalty."</p>

  <p>"And what may that be?" Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram asked with pardonable
  anxiety.</p>

  <p>Reggie glanced at Mr. Merrion, who took up the thread again.</p>

  <p>"A committal for contempt," he said. "My dear lady, I am loth to say it
  but the thing is inevitable. The fact that a national treasure, so to speak,
  is going to America will tell against you. Still, as they make special
  provision for these cases at Holloway&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Holloway Gaol?" Kathleen exclaimed. "Mr. Merrion, you don't mean to
  say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Really, my dear young lady, I am afraid I do," Merrion said gravely.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" Cedric remarked, sotto voce. "Good Lord, you don't mean
  it?"</p>

  <p>Nobody took the faintest notice. The anxious expression faded from Mrs.
  Eldred-Wolfram's face. She was her calm, placid self again.</p>

  <p>"Then I shall go," she said. "I want no sympathy, please; no show of
  feeling. Come, girls."</p>

  <p>She rose and swept gravely from the table, followed by the girls. Merrion
  pushed the cigarettes across to Reggie, and helped himself to another glass
  of claret.</p>

  <p>"I suppose that is what it will really come to?" the younger man
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, my dear boy. It is a bad case&mdash;as bad as that of a
  certain Duchess some years ago. I have done the best I can. Still, a humble
  apology, plus the Cup, may do much. The point is&mdash;do you think the Major
  will succeed in getting it back in time?"</p>

  <p>"It won't be for the want of trying," Reggie said. "During the last two
  days the Major and myself have had several interviews with Mr. Wargrave. Of
  course, he is very sore about it; he bought the Cup in good faith, and he is
  naturally very proud of it. It is a gem that any collector might covet.
  Still, he sees now that in any case he will have to refund it, because
  clearly Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram had no authority to sell. I fancy he was
  convinced of that when we parted last night."</p>

  <p>"And, naturally, he would expect to get his cheque back. The point is,
  whether our charming hostess still has the money."</p>

  <p>"I should say not. She has probably discharged some of her heavy
  obligations with it. Still, we ought to know before long what Mr. Wargrave is
  going to do."</p>

  <p>A second glass of claret was finished, and a second cigarette was smoked
  before Cedric came in with a telegram. Reggie glanced at it and smiled.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, so far," he said. "The Major has got the Cup, by which I
  infer that he has given his cheque for the money, and so risked losing it.
  After all, despite Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram's ideas, there is something in having
  a brewery in the family."</p>

  <p>"We may just manage to pull through now," Merrion said, "unless the
  Saltash people are very vindictive. But one thing is quite certain&mdash;Mrs.
  Eldred-Wolfram must appear in person. But, win or lose, there is a painful
  surprise in store for her."</p>

  <p>The royal pageant started the following morning; Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram
  behind the bays, with Mr. Merrion by her side. Reggie had elected to stay
  behind; the family would have to be supported in the hour of their need, he
  argued. The suggestion that an old shoe should be thrown for luck was
  abandoned as being contrary to the traditions that hung around the
  family.</p>

  <p>"Will she have to clean out her own cell?" Edna asked, unfeelingly.</p>

  <p>"I fancy patients with money are allowed to employ the poorer debtors in
  that capacity," Reggie explained. "Also they can order in their own food, but
  knives and forks are not permitted. Tobacco is prohibited, and only malt
  liquor to the extent of two pints a day."</p>

  <p>Phillipa was moved to heartless mirth. The situation was not without
  humour. The connection between Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram and malt liquors was
  distinctly funny. The twins had come down and dutifully kissed their
  godmother farewell, and she had embraced their heather mixture costumes
  without the faintest shade of annoyance. Under the circumstances of the case,
  they could not take a gloomy view of the future.</p>

  <p>It was past four when there came a telegram from Mr. Merrion to the effect
  that Holloway was not destined on this occasion to number Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram
  as a temporary member. On the whole she had behaved very well, the Court had
  been in a good humour, and the Saltash people not unduly vindictive. The
  production in court of the Warwick Cup had created a good impression. Mrs.
  Eldred-Wolfram was detained by pressing business, but would be home to dinner
  at nine o'clock.</p>

  <p>"She will explain the changed aspect of affairs," the message
  concluded.</p>

  <p>This was vague and a little disquieting. Nobody quite knew what it meant.
  Reggie's legal knowledge was of the slightest, and it had given out earlier
  in the day. Nor was there a word from Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram as she sat calm and
  dignified throughout dinner. But there was something heavy in the air, for,
  as the dessert appeared, Cedric was dismissed. He sighed loudly and went.</p>

  <p>"You have something dreadful to tell us?" Kathleen suggested.</p>

  <p>"So dreadful that I cannot quite realise it as yet," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram
  said quite calmly. "It appears that I have been living in a fool's paradise
  all these years. My tenants I have never bothered, because I have regarded
  them as more or less part of the family. Therefore, I have sold what I have
  regarded as my own properly in order to keep up the dignity of the house. All
  this, it appears, is wrong. They make out that from first to last I have had
  over £200,000 in this way, I have been ordered to refund the money."</p>

  <p>"But that does not seem to be possible," Margaret exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"My dear, you are perfectly right; it is not possible. I had to agree to
  everything. Had I not done so there is little doubt that the Lord Chancellor
  would have sent me to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The twins nodded in sympathy. Edna smiled sadly as she thought of the two
  pints of malt liquor.</p>

  <p>"It would have been exceedingly unpleasant," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram went on.
  "They lectured me, and I had to endure it. . . . From a man who was once a
  lawyer's clerk. . . . They said that I had been foolishly indulgent to my
  tenants; they made out that they had taken shameful advantage of me. How it
  happened, goodness only knows, but Mr. Merrion tells me that I consented for
  the estate to be administered by the trustees, with power to get in the
  really enormous arrears of rent, which they are to apply to repay off my
  debt. I am to be allowed £2000 a year, and Caradoc is to be let
  furnished."</p>

  <p>"Did you really agree to that?" Kathleen cried, aghast.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram nodded, and her eyes grew moist.</p>

  <p>"I had to," she said, simply. "Unless I had consented they would have sent
  me . . . yonder. I should have been compelled to mix with dreadful creatures.
  My dears, the blow has fallen. And that is not the worst."</p>

  <p>"Could there be any worse?" Kathleen asked.</p>

  <p>"There is always something worse," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said in a deepest
  gloom. "There are my private debts. How am I going to pay them? So far as I
  can gather, I owe something like £8000 now. And&mdash;and I owe Major
  Wiltshire half that sum as the balance for the recovery of the Warwick
  Cup."</p>

  <p>It was a bitter confession to make, but Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram made it like
  the great lady she was. Reggie, with his eyes cast down on the table, said
  nothing. He knew pretty well what a confession like that had cost the
  speaker. To be under an obligation to Major Wiltshire was worse than leaving
  Caradoc. Reggie found himself alone with Kathleen presently.</p>

  <p>"It's a dreadful business," she said. "Though I fancy a blow like this
  will do Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram good. And the way the tenants have taken
  advantage of her is ridiculous. I suppose, if she places half her income on
  one side, she can make terms with her private creditors."</p>

  <p>"I'll see to that," Reggie said. "You are going to stick to our gracious
  lady, I see, and she couldn't have anybody better. I'm glad you came home,
  Kathleen."</p>

  <p>"And I'm glad I met you, Reggie," Kathleen said with a flush on her face.
  "We'll both stick to our gracious lady, and there's my hand on it."</p>

  <p>Reggie kissed the slender fingers, and seemed about as if to say
  something, and then changed his mind.</p>

  <p>"We'll pull through all right," he said. "It all depends now upon the
  tenant who takes Caradoc. Oh, the place will let like anything. There will be
  scores of rich men after it to-morrow. As soon as everything is decided, I'll
  come over and let you know. . . . Good night, little Kitty."</p>

  <p>They shook hands again, and smiled into each other's eyes. Then Kitty
  blushed and fled, with a pleased feeling in her mind and her heart beating a
  little faster than usual. It was two days later before Reggie came over from
  Castleford again with a grave face and a suggestion of catastrophe in his
  eyes. Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram was walking in the garden as he came up.</p>

  <p>"If there anything bad?" Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram asked. "What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Caradoc is let," Reggie stammered. "Never was anything so foolish. And
  who do you suppose they have let it to? It's infamous."</p>

  <p>"I know," Kitty said with fine instinct. "It's been taken by Mr. Lawson
  Waddy, the newspaper man."</p>

  <p>"This," said Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram, "is the crushing blow. Fate can do no
  further harm now."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; EXODUS</h2>

  <p class="first">There was straw littered about the great Gothic hall at
Caradoc, some
  dreadfully modern-looking deal packing boxes stood side by side with a pair
  of carved oak dower chests. Contemplating them with a wistful expression on
  her pretty face was Kathleen.</p>

  <p>"There is something very pathetic about a packing case," she said aloud.
  "Under these circumstances, a poet might write an ode to a packing case.
  Fancy a family living here since the time of Alfred the Great and then being
  'moved' by Maple&mdash;'estimates free'&mdash;and all the rest of it. Oh,
  dear; I wish this had never happened. I wish&mdash;I do wish, Reggie was
  here."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's a sincere compliment, at any rate," Reggie's clear voice
  said. "I have pressing business that takes me away for a week, and when I
  come back I find this. What does it mean?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," Kathleen said hopelessly. She seemed oblivious to the fact
  that Reginald was still holding her hand in his, and that there was something
  more than admiration shining in his honest eyes. "I had to go to London with
  Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram to help her with that dreadful legal business, and we
  only got back last night. Grandmother's creditors have behaved shamefully.
  Men who have had thousands of her money are abusing her as if she were a
  thief. Reggie, it has aged her dreadfully. Some of those people came and
  abused her. It was like drawing her heart's blood drop by drop."</p>

  <p>Reggie nodded in sympathy. To be abused by a tradesman was the deepest
  depth of all.</p>

  <p>"We all came back last night," Kathleen went on. "Margaret and I have been
  making arrangements, and the twins have been helping us. There are unexpected
  strong points in the twins that nobody could possibly have anticipated. Never
  again will they come under the dominating influence of grandmother. We are
  going to take a flat near Hyde Park for the present."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you are," Reggie said, grimly. "I can see the programme quite
  clearly. Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram has decided to immolate herself on the shrine of
  her order, and refuses to touch a penny of the income allowed her by the
  Court because some vulgar thief, who has probably been overcharging her for
  years, has descended to abuse. You are going to help because you are really
  making a good income, and Margaret is going to take to painting again. The
  twins are going to act in lieu of servants. Now, isn't that the programme
  that you have mapped out for yourselves?"</p>

  <p>"Well!" said Kathleen, somewhat taken aback, "it&mdash;it is rather like
  that. How did you know?"</p>

  <p>"How did I know? Think I never read novels! Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram would die
  in a year up there, and Margaret will never recover if she goes back yonder.
  Since you have been away I have been pretty busy. For one thing, I have taken
  Beacon Lodge."</p>

  <p>"The pretty house back under the hills," Kathleen exclaimed. "Are you
  going to live there?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I must have a home somewhere," Reggie said hastily. "The Major has
  pretty well made up his mind to settle in these parts, and I don't exactly
  care to take up my abode with him. You see, I have my father's money, so I am
  pretty well off&mdash;too well off to have any desire for Caradoc till I am
  legally entitled to it. As this place is let, and there was nothing said
  about the family heirlooms, I am furnishing on the cheap. Every carpet and
  chair and picture and the rest at Beacon Lodge comes from here. Hence these
  cases. The trustees allowed me to do that."</p>

  <p>Kathleen followed with more or less interest.</p>

  <p>"That explains it all," she said. "But it seems strange that nearly
  everything I miss, and which you have taken, should have been Mrs.
  Eldred-Wolfram's favourite treasures."</p>

  <p>"That shows my exquisite taste," Reggie said, with a smile. "You must come
  and see my place."</p>

  <p>"We'll make the most of our time," Kathleen said, sadly. "Did you take
  Margaret's organ, too? I find that has gone. Oh, Reggie, how she will miss
  it."</p>

  <p>"I took that, too," Reggie said. "I did not fancy Mr. Lawson Waddy playing
  'Girl' music on Margaret's favourite instrument. And so you are going to do
  without servants in London."</p>

  <p>"Practically. One little maid from here, or something like that. The great
  stumbling-block in the way is Cedric; his obstinacy is monumental. He
  persistently declines to leave us. When I suggested the question of wages to
  him, he gave me a look&mdash;well, I couldn't go on, Reggie. I can't really
  grasp it. A little time ago my grandmother was absolute mistress here; she
  seemed both rich and powerful. Then comes a petty dispute; a few words,
  followed by a thoughtless action, and everything has gone like a vision."</p>

  <p>"If it hadn't been for that confounded Cup," Reggie muttered.</p>

  <p>"Come and see Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram. You will find her greatly changed."</p>

  <p>Reggie was bound to admit that Kathleen was right. The last few days
  seemed to have added years to the elderly lady's life. She had lost her
  straightness, there was a shakiness of the hands that was painful to see.
  Reggie could imagine his relative broken, but he had never anticipated seeing
  her bent like this.</p>

  <p>"I began to fancy you had deserted us," she said, with the first ghost of
  a smile. "We have been in London, Reggie. There is a deal of business to
  transact. And there were certain creditors of mine who seemed to think that I
  had behaved shabbily to them. One or two were exceedingly angry. They
  ventured to say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't," Kathleen said imploringly. "Please don't; try and forget all
  about it. I have been telling Reggie of our plans. Once we have made the
  plunge, we shall be quite happy in London."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram's lips framed the words, but they did not find
  utterance. There was a yearning look in her eyes as they roamed about the old
  room; no suggestion of tears told in her eyes, but there was something very
  pathetic about the drooping figure in the Jacobean armchair.</p>

  <p>"I see a good many of the treasures have been removed," she said. "Cedric
  tells me several cases have gone away. It is strange that most of them should
  have been my favourites."</p>

  <p>Reggie proceeded to explain. Everything has gone to Beacon Lodge. By this
  time the whole house was practically straight. It would perhaps be a little
  break at a mournful period, certainly Reggie would take it as a great honour
  if the family would dine with him to-morrow night.</p>

  <p>"I'll try and come, Reggie," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said. "But the last day
  or two I have been so dreadfully tired. It is quite a new feeling to me. So
  very, very tired."</p>

  <p>She repeated the last words once or twice mechanically. All her old pride
  and haughtiness seemed to have been swept away. The sound of her
  ivory-handled stick sounded loud on the stairs; for the first time in her
  life she needed it. Kathleen looked at Reggie, her eyes full of tears.</p>

  <p>"It's very sad," she said unsteadily. "If I could only do something really
  useful&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Reggie was of opinion that Kathleen's advent in England was a god-send.
  Two workmen crossed the hall and proceeded to remove the remaining cases, the
  sound of hammers echoed from a distant corridor. As Kathleen looked up she
  saw that the lantern clock and the ship's bell were gone. She was about to
  remark on this when the twins came in from the garden. As Reggie looked at
  them he found himself wondering why he had ever compared them to a pair of
  Dutch dolls. They were alert and vigorous enough now.</p>

  <p>"It's no use my pretending I'm sorry, because I'm not," Edna said. "It
  sounds like blasphemy, but I never cared for Caradoc, it's too grand and
  overbearing for me. I never felt human here. At last I am going to live and
  breathe and be of some use in the world."</p>

  <p>She stood poised there, with her lips parted and with eager eyes. It was a
  picture good to see. Then they all passed into the garden again, where they
  found Margaret, and fell to discussing the future. It was Reggie who was the
  most buoyant and cheerful. He was quite sure that everything would come all
  right.</p>

  <p>"What you really want is to find a place here," he said.</p>

  <p>"I've thought of that," Kathleen said quietly, "but it wouldn't do. It
  would be too reminiscent. Perhaps we could have managed if the place had not
  been taken by Mr. Lawson Waddy."</p>

  <p>"That was a fatal mistake," Reggie said, shooting the head off a daisy
  with his stick. "But I've got my little scheme for getting rid of Lawson
  Waddy. With the true caution of his class he has only taken the house with a
  proviso that he can relinquish it at the end of a year if he likes. Unless I
  am greatly mistaken, the end of the twelve months will also see the end of
  Lawson Waddy. Now, you are all coming to dine with me to-morrow night.
  Whatever you do, pray don't disappoint me."</p>

  <p>Reggie went off, nodding his head mysteriously. It was only a pleasant
  walk across the fields, so that there was no occasion for a state entry into
  Beacon Lodge. The girls had forgotten everything in the excitement and
  curiosity of the moment, nor were they disposed to be critical. They saw a
  long, low house, covered with creepers, approached by paths past beautifully
  trimmed lawns. There was a square, oak-panelled hall, with the old lantern
  clock in the centre, hard by the ship's bell; here were the Elizabethan
  chairs and the favourite pictures in the drawing-room, lending to a
  beautifully fitted conservatory, Reggie seemed to have gathered everything
  that Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram most valued; indeed, everything seemed to have been
  arranged to copy the small dining and drawing rooms at Caradoc. In a small
  chamber behind was the organ that Margaret had so prized. She clasped her
  hands together as she looked at it.</p>

  <p>"It has been hard work to get it ready," Reggie said. He appeared to have
  some little difficulty with his words. "I got all the old furniture, you see,
  down to the carpet and rugs. The trustees allowed me to take them away, on
  condition that I made myself personally responsible for their safety. If I
  can't have the rose just yet, I mean to get as near to the rose as I
  can."</p>

  <p>Kathleen looked about her with shining eyes; there was a deep colour on
  her cheeks. With more zest than she had shown for days, Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram
  proposed to see the bedrooms.</p>

  <p>"It is an excellent idea or yours, Reggie," she said. "And a great
  compliment to me. Do you mean to say that all the furniture from my
  chamber&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is upstairs," Reggie said. "It will be for you when you come to see me,
  which will be often, I hope. It was a poor idea, but the best I could think
  of."</p>

  <p>The others were trooping up the stairs behind Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram; only
  Kathleen lingered beyond. She looked up to Reggie with eyes that told their
  own tale.</p>

  <p>"You are a darling," she whispered, "a regular darling. Oh, Reggie,
  Reggie!"</p>

  <p>Her hands went out impulsively, and he caught them in his. The next moment
  his arm was about her waist and his lips pressed to hers. It was a delirious,
  delicious minute in which Kathleen realised that she loved and was loved in
  return. An instant later, and they were standing apart as if nothing had
  happened, save that Kathleen was breathing fast, and her lips were parted in
  an unsteady smile.</p>

  <p>"The subject is not to be mentioned again for a long time," she said. "At
  the present moment, and, oh, Reggie, do you really and truly love me?"</p>

  <p>Reggie made no reply in words. But he was quite sure of his feelings. He
  listened to Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram's praise of his good taste and feeling for
  decorations without hearing a word she said. It was not till the ship's bell
  tolled out with startling familiarity that he had recovered himself.</p>

  <p>Down in the dining-room, dinner was laid out on the oval gate-legged table
  that Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram affected. There was the familiar damask, the
  favourite flowers, the old Venetian glass and silver, with the old portraits
  smiling down from the walls. And in the centre of the table stood the Warwick
  Cup. Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram's pale face flushed as she saw it.</p>

  <p>"The skeleton at the feast," she murmured. "Well, my pride has had a fall;
  how strange and yet how familiar it all seems. Dear me, is that Cedric?"</p>

  <p>Cedric came forward to wait without a muscle of his face moving. He looked
  like the repository of a great and wonderful secret. His manners were as
  perfect as ever, but his hand shook ever so slightly as he handed round the
  dishes so familiar to him for so many years.</p>

  <p>On the whole, it was a cheerful meal, there was a buoyant, sanguine spirit
  about it. The cloth was removed and dessert laid out when Reggie made a sign
  to Cedric.</p>

  <p>"Take the Cup and fill it," he said.</p>

  <p>Cedric removed the Warwick Cup from the table, and proceeded to fill it
  with champagne. Reggie rose with a graver face than he had worn all through
  the meal.</p>

  <p>"I am going to propose a toast and make a confession," he said. "We are
  all friends here, in which category, I have no hesitation in including
  Cedric, who stands behind me."</p>

  <p>"And God bless you for saying that, Master Reginald," Cedric said in a
  muffled voice.</p>

  <p>"Well, it is no more than the truth. Circumstances into which I need not
  go render it imperative for my esteemed relative here to find another home.
  Really, I am getting on better with my speech than I anticipated. I find
  myself in command of a fine flow of language. Well, my esteemed relative and
  her loving relations have decided, in their wisdom, to go to London. The
  wisdom of that decision I question. It is no place for you, dear lady. I am
  quite sure it is no place for Margaret. It was my intention to try and
  persuade my friends to remain in the neighbourhood of Caradoc. Dear Mrs.
  Eldred-Wolfram, will you be quite candid with me?"</p>

  <p>"I will be as candid with you as you like, Reggie," the elderly lady
  murmured.</p>

  <p>"Then, would it not have broken your heart to go away from here?"</p>

  <p>"Is it not broken already?" Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said quietly. "My
  punishment is none the less hard because I have brought it on myself. But for
  the sake of the girls&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, the girls will be all right. Edna and Phillipa would look after the
  house. For Margaret I have procured some splendid commissions to
  paint&mdash;paint&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Reggie paused in confusion as he met Kathleen's brimming, dancing eyes.
  Perhaps she loved him none the less for the falsehood uttered in so good a
  cause and with such good feeling.</p>

  <p>"So that Margaret shall have a good income," he went on. "As for Kathleen,
  I should say she must be making, at least, £1000 a year, which is likely to
  become much more."</p>

  <p>"Oh, much," Kathleen cried, fairly caressing Reggie with her eyes, and
  entering into the spirit of the thing. "We are going to make my grandmother
  very comfortable between us. She has given up her income for the honour of
  the name; we will give everything up also for her dear sake."</p>

  <p>"That is how I expected you all to feel," Reggie said. "So, therefore, you
  are not going to London at all. Kathleen, you guessed my secret. Tell it to
  the others."</p>

  <p>"Reggie bought this house for us," Kathleen said, with shining eyes. "We
  shall be happy and comfortable, we shall have money and to spare. Pass the
  loving cup, and let us drink to our future happiness."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram took the Cup with hands that trembled so much that
  Reggie had to steady it. Then the big silver vessel went slowly round the
  table till all had sipped, and finally Reggie passed it to Cedric. The old
  man's face flamed, but he accepted the compliment, and drank without protest
  or apology.</p>

  <p>"I may be able to thank you presently," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said. "From
  you I could accept the gift. If you only knew how I have dreaded&mdash;if I
  could only cry my head would be better."</p>

  <p>She bent forward and wiped her dry eyes, a queer laugh came from her lips
  as Reggie turned towards her. Each smiling, happy face had grown uneasy.</p>

  <p>"Cedric, this is a case for a doctor," Reggie whispered. "I had no idea
  that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Dr. Ford, sir?" Cedric asked. "I'll go myself."</p>

  <p>"No, no," cried Kathleen, with a sudden inspiration. "Dr. Dennison,
  Cedric; send for Dr. Dennison. I am quite sure that Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram would
  like him."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram seemed to comprehend dimly. She met Margaret's
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"I should prefer Dr. Dennison, I think," she said. "They say he is so
  clever."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; ARCADIAN</h2>

  <p class="first">A blackbird was piping madly in the apple orchard, a faint
breeze stirred
  the elms. There was a murmur of bees in the air, the sharp tinkle of a
  whetstone against a scythe as Cedric pompously slaved away in a dark corner.
  Not the least surprising part of the exodus was the many sidedness of
  character displayed by Cedric. The mere idea of Cedric playing the part of
  gardener was past imagination; even Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram would never have
  dreamt of asking him to do anything of the kind. It was a pleasing feature in
  the hour of trouble.</p>

  <p>And yet the trouble, once faced, had not been nearly so dreadful as on the
  first blush it appeared. Beacon Lodge would have been voted a delightful
  house by ordinary mortals. It stood high, and embraced the most charming
  views, as the house agents picturesquely put it; there was plenty of shade,
  and the garden and grounds were well matured&mdash;to quote the agent
  again.</p>

  <p>And nothing was wanting inside the house to make it complete. The side
  lawn was delightfully shady, so Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram had her basket-chair and
  knitting placed there, where she could hear the sweet low music of Margaret's
  organ, and where she could watch Kathleen at her work.</p>

  <p>The latter had given herself over, heart and soul, the last few days, to
  her new book. Kathleen was a rapid worker, and always did best at high
  pressure. Never before had she been so deeply enamoured of a story, full as
  it was of Caradoc and the impression of her last surroundings. There were
  sharp contrasts, too, that gave the story a piquancy of its own.</p>

  <p>Kathleen wrote on for another hour, and then closed her pad with a
  snap.</p>

  <p>"There!" she said, looking up with a sunny smile. "We have reached the
  point where the heroine has to choose between her love and what she considers
  her duty. Shall I read what I have written to-day?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram assented eagerly. She was taking the most vivid
  interest in the new novel. Modern fiction she generally despised; she was out
  of touch with the latter day spirit, and anything beyond the era of Scott she
  viewed with contempt. But she had been learning things lately, she had become
  much more human in the last few months, and there was a tender simplicity
  about Kathleen's work that charmed her. She listened with an interest that
  was flattering.</p>

  <p>"Of course your 'Gelert House' is Caradoc," she said. "Do you know your
  heroine strongly reminds me of Margaret? There is quite a likeness."</p>

  <p>Kathleen smiled. As a matter of fact Margaret was the heroine of the
  story&mdash;Margaret torn between love and duty&mdash;Margaret, the daughter
  of a gentle lady of high degree, who had married a pushing, shrewd man of the
  world, who had ordered Margaret's poor lover not to enter the house again.
  Only in the book the heroine's mother was dead, and she had her father to
  fight alone.</p>

  <p>"The father is familiar, but I can't quite grasp him," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram
  said.</p>

  <p>"Then I will let you into the secret," said Kathleen. "My heroine's father
  is a kind of Lawson Waddy grown older. Gelert House is Caradoc, of course,
  and the heroine loves it because it is the home of her race bought back by
  her father after he had made his money. As yet we have not seen much of the
  hero, but he must not be neglected any longer."</p>

  <p>"Who is he going to be like?" Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram asked.</p>

  <p>The soft sweet harmony of the organ had stopped for a moment and Margaret
  had come out into the sunshine through the window. Kathleen went on
  quietly.</p>

  <p>"He is to be a doctor," she said. "A noble young fellow who makes great
  sacrifices and who has saved the heroine's life. Now, can you suggest
  anybody?"</p>

  <p>"Why not Dr. Dennison?" Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram asked eagerly. It seemed to
  her that she was really having a hand in the making of the story. "Dr.
  Dennison would do admirably."</p>

  <p>"You think that he is&mdash;is&mdash;you know what I mean. Of course,
  there are gentlemen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said with great decision, "you can make
  your mind quite easy on that point. Dr. Dennison is a gentleman in the best
  sense of the word. And nobody could have done me so much good as he did. You
  could not have a more attractive model."</p>

  <p>"Then it is settled that Dr. Dennison is to be the model for the hero of
  the great work," Kathleen said cheerfully. "There are two loyal, noble,
  loving hearts on the verge of shipwreck because a sordid and worldly father
  desires to sacrifice his daughter for his own ends."</p>

  <p>"But you are not going to let him succeed?" Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said
  eagerly. "Don't be what they call realistic, I believe, and spoil the story
  in this way. My dear, I have been thinking of a great many things lately,
  since&mdash;since&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Since you came here for your holiday," Kathleen interposed.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes, if you put it that way. After all, love is everything; there
  is nothing like it."</p>

  <p>"Margaret and Dr. Dennison," Kathleen said vaguely. "Not that they have
  anything to do with the case."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram blushed a little. She had been talking in the
  abstract, and this concreting of her sentiments was not altogether
  pleasing.</p>

  <p>"That is a different matter altogether," she said, not without dignity. "I
  cannot forget that Margaret is a representative of perhaps the oldest family
  in England. Besides, there is Reggie&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Kathleen hastened to change the subject. The time was not ripe yet to tell
  her secret, and, besides, Margaret was standing in the window. At the end of
  the garden a yellow motor with red wheels whizzed by at a pace that would
  have caused trouble before a bench of Surrey magistrates, and a grotesque
  figure raised one of the latest monstrosities in the way of a motor cap.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Lawson Waddy," said Kathleen. "What an absurd little creature he is,
  with his turned-up moustaches. They say he is going to do all kinds of things
  at Caradoc. He has been here only a few weeks, and I'm told he talks as if he
  had solved the whole agricultural problem. I'm told that he is going in for
  jam-making on a large scale."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram's face clouded slightly. She had heard most of the
  stories from the farmers, and the farmers' wives, who had come to do her
  homage at Beacon Lodge. Most of the tenants on the Caradoc estates had
  doubtless shamefully abused Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram's regal generosity in the
  past, but they were making up to her now. Amazing gifts, or rather offerings
  of produce, came streaming into the kitchen at Beacon Lodge. Poultry, butter,
  cheese, preserves of all kinds, were literally laid at the feet of the Lady
  Bountiful, and she accepted it all as her right. Thus did the vassals in the
  old days show their loyalty to the lord of the soil. But as they came they
  brought strange rumours.</p>

  <p>Mr. Lawson Waddy was going to wake them all up, he was going to show them
  how to make a fortune out of the fruits of the soil, the labourers were to be
  coaxed back to the land again, a golden time was coming&mdash;a golden time
  and a dividend of 10 per cent. Lawson Waddy had not lost sight of the
  dividend. He was going to erect his own factory as an object lesson; before
  long the Caradoc brand or provisions would be famous. It was merely a manner
  of advertising.</p>

  <p>All these things Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram had heard with misgiving. She
  wondered if the trustees had power to prevent this kind of thing. She was
  still debating the matter in her mind over her knitting when the garden gate
  opened, and a young man, wheeling a bicycle, entered. As a rule, Mrs.
  Eldred-Wolfram hated bicycles as a concession to the revolutionary spirit,
  but she had a smile for the rider. Margaret had a smile for him, too, and her
  pale face flushed.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Dennison," Kathleen murmured. "Grandmother, shall I ring the bell for
  tea?"</p>

  <p>Tea came presently, served on the grass under the sweet-smelling acacias
  by Cedric, who looked and bore himself as if he had never seen a scythe in
  his life. Dennison talked in his easy, graceful manner, but there was a
  suggestion of a frown between his brows.</p>

  <p>"What is wrong, Dr. Dennison?" Kathleen asked, in her quick, sympathetic
  way. "Did Mr. Lawson Waddy run you down in his motor-car?"</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, he stopped and spoke to me," Dennison said. "I longed
  for the freedom of my 'Varsity days again. If I could have recalled them I
  should have certainly assaulted that distinguished journalist, though I beg
  Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram's pardon for talking so violently in her presence."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram smiled indulgently. She had taken a greater liking to
  this frank, manly, clever young doctor than she would have cared to
  acknowledge. Besides, she had the turbulent spirit of her ancestors
  somewhere, and, sooth to say, she would rather have enjoyed the spectacle of
  an encounter between these two.</p>

  <p>"Was he more than usually offensive?" Kathleen asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, much worse. The fellow is going to build a factory here, or so he
  says, to make jam. I pointed out to him the other day that it would be a
  great eyesore to you here, and an offence generally! He was very rude then,
  he had practically purchased the only available land, and he should do as he
  liked. Under the circumstances I took the bull by the horns and went to see
  old Ballard, who has the land to sell. I told him what was going on, and he
  quite took my view. The long and short of it is that, to save any possible
  annoyance, I bought that land myself."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram was quite warm in her gratitude&mdash;it was a most
  kind and thoughtful thing to do. Dennison blushed slightly under the
  process.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," he said. "I can spare the money and the land is valuable. Mr
  Waddy met me just now and gave me his opinion on the transaction. Not to be
  less candid, I gave him a few of my opinions. But he shall not sell anything
  from Caradoc. I flatter myself that I have some influence with the tenants
  here, and most of them have promised to refrain from sending anything to
  Waddy's agents. He will make nothing out of his vulgar commercialism
  here."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram positively beamed with gratitude. She even said
  nothing as Dennison, after tea, strolled off with Margaret to see the roses.
  Cedric had produced a fresh brew in the Georgian teapot, when Reggie came
  strolling down the garden path.</p>

  <p>"I am just over from Caradoc," he explained casually. "Upon my word, our
  friend there is going it. He proposes to publish a cheap history of the
  house&mdash;price a penny, of course&mdash;and get people interested in the
  place. Then he wants to establish a kind of bacon factory or something of the
  kind, and make a big market for the Caradoc provisions. He says he shall call
  it the 'Caradoc,' and have the Warwick Cup as a trade mark."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram turned up her eyes resignedly.</p>

  <p>"Can we have no peace from that man?" She said. "Cannot he refrain from
  his vulgar money-making in a peaceful spot like this? Of course, you stopped
  it at once, Reggie?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you see, I am not exactly in a position to do so," Reggie
  explained. "I believe the fellow can adopt any name as trade mark he likes.
  Fortunately, the factory scheme has been knocked on the head owing to the
  action of Dennison."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram announced her intention of going inside as the dew was
  falling. She was leaning a little heavily on her stick again. Visions of a
  reproduction of the Warwick Cup wrapped round a pound of butter or
  picturesquely adoring a pot of jam, rose before her troubled eyes. The whole
  thing was horrible. Kathleen lay back in her chair, and laughed gently. She
  sadly lacked the Wolfram spirit.</p>

  <p>"The whole thing sounds so absurd," she said. "And yet I have been quite
  long enough with her to appreciate the feelings of our gracious lady in the
  matter. Reggie, it was a great mistake to allow that man to come to Caradoc.
  Is there no way of getting rid of him?"</p>

  <p>"Come down into the garden and let us discuss it seriously," Reggie said.
  "My darling, I have not seen you for a week."</p>

  <p>It was some time before they discussed anything seriously. It was very
  quiet there, and the scent of the roses was heavy on the air. When the
  conversation became less warm and personal, it drifted to Margaret and
  Dennison.</p>

  <p>"Can nothing be done there?" Reggie asked.</p>

  <p>"Everything is going to be done there," Kathleen smiled. "I am working out
  a pretty scheme, and our gracious lady is falling into the trap most
  beautifully. If you want any little schemes like that worked out, you can do
  no better than consult a novelist. Let me tell you something about my new
  book, which is getting on famously. And when you have the plot of it, I shall
  be greatly disappointed if you don't guess what I am working for. Mrs.
  Eldred-Wolfram is deeply interested in the heroine."</p>

  <p>"What a clever wife I shall have," Reggie said. "And yet it is dreadful to
  think that I shall be always pointed out as Mrs. Eldred's husband."</p>

  <p>"And what better fate could you have, sir? Now, listen to me carefully.
  When I have finished I shall expect you to recognise the original of my
  heroine."</p>

  <p>Kathleen told the plot of the story clearly and distinctly. Reggie's
  interest was clearly flattering.</p>

  <p>"That sounds very fine," he said. "I recognised Margaret and Dennison at
  once. I presume the cruel father is made up of a compound portrait of Waddy
  and Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram; in other words, you dare not be too near the
  original in that quarter. My dear girl, I see exactly what you are driving
  at, and a very clever scheme it is, if you can get over our gracious
  lady."</p>

  <p>"Dearest, I have done so already. She is greatly interested in the story
  of my heroine, she is quite distressed lest the whole thing should not end
  happily. And when I make her subsequently confess, I mean when I make Mrs.
  Eldred-Wolfram confess&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Reggie moved a little further away as Margaret and Dennison came down the
  path. The name of Lawson Waddy floated in the air, he seemed to poison
  everything. Reggie laughed, but Dennison's face was grave again. He proceeded
  to explain, but Reggie cut him short.</p>

  <p>"But I see you don't know everything," the doctor said. "That man is
  simply bound to turn everything into money. Do you know his latest scheme? He
  is having practically all your treasures photographed with a view to
  publication. Says he's going to start a new art journal. I don't speak with
  legal knowledge, but I fancy you can stop that."</p>

  <p>"Is that really a fact?" Reggie asked, with a beaming face.</p>

  <p>"I had it from the culprit myself. 'Pon my word, Eldred, you seem to take
  it pretty coolly."</p>

  <p>"Don't let us mention the man again," Reggie said. "I fancy I see my way
  to deal with him now. Margaret, come and give us a little music, and Dennison
  shall sing. I must not stay long, as I have to drive out to Castleford
  to-night."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; THE DOWER CHEST</h2>

  <p class="first">The organ stood back with the bank of flowers behind it
exactly as it had
  done in the cell at Caradoc. Kathleen sat there dreaming as Margaret's
  fingers wandered over the keys, her mind was far away as Dennison's fine
  voice sang some passionate Ave. She sat there still for a long time after the
  two young men had departed and the shadows had commenced to fall. From
  outside came the sound of the voices of the twins quarrelling over their game
  of tennis.</p>

  <p>"How material those girls are!" Kathleen said as she came to herself at
  length. "Margaret, I hardly heard you playing."</p>

  <p>"I saw you were in a brown study," Margaret said. "Thinking of the book
  still. I am quite hurt that I am not allowed to hear any of it. How does your
  heroine get on?"</p>

  <p>"My heroine is like yourself," Kathleen smiled. "The love story is marred
  by a sinister influence&mdash;the struggle between love and duty."</p>

  <p>"I know; I have heard it before. Don't spoil it, Kathleen, don't be too
  material. I hope you are going to let your heroine be happy."</p>

  <p>Kathleen leaned over and kissed the white, pathetic face.</p>

  <p>"She is going to be happy," she whispered. "She is going to marry the man
  of her choice. And then she does so about the same time you will marry yours.
  Dear old Margaret, you are going to have your doctor yet."</p>

  <p>Margaret shook her head, but Kathleen's light spirit had affected her. The
  music of the organ rose and swelled into a triumphal march.</p>

  <p>Kathleen sat under the big cedar on the lawn busy at her story. Her head
  was bent down and her pen was flying over the paper. Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram,
  brushing green fly from the roses, watched her with a certain air of
  proprietorship. A few weeks ago it had come to her as a great shock that a
  near relative of hers should have plied for hire, so to speak, as a
  professional novelist, but she had altered her views widely of late. After
  all, it was good to have an intellect in the family. In her heart of hearts
  Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram regarded herself as part author of the story. She was
  anxious to know how the day's work was progressing, but she had learned the
  lesson that an author is not to be molested in the moment of inspiration even
  by a Wolfram.</p>

  <p>Kathleen turned back the leaves of her pad presently and began to whistle.
  It was all very strange and new and wonderful, but that whistle did not shock
  or annoy Mrs Eldred-Wolfram in the least. Perhaps she was more adaptable than
  she imagined. She smiled quite amiably as Edna came out of the porch with a
  book in her hand. Edna, in a black dress with neat collar and cuffs, and her
  hair becomingly done, looked quite smart and business-like.</p>

  <p>"The grocer has been overcharging us again," she said. "I have taken two
  shillings off his book, and he does not like it. I tell him this is not
  Caradoc, and that if this occurs again we shall have to send to the
  stores."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram murmured something. She tried to imagine Edna once
  again in a straw bonnet and white stockings, and failed. Phillipa was dusting
  the drawing-room china and whistling over her work. It struck the elderly
  lady suddenly and quite as a shock that she was the only useless member of
  the household. Even Margaret, down the garden, was making a water-colour
  sketch of some white lilac. Edna returned to the house again with an
  ultimatum for the unhappy grocer. Kathleen came up, still whistling
  gently.</p>

  <p>"Three thousand words since breakfast," she said. "My dear grandmother, I
  have more or less solved the problem for my heroine."</p>

  <p>"Have you, indeed, my dear?" Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said eagerly. "I should
  very much like to hear how. Do you know, your heroine is quite real to me. I
  don't know why, but whenever she comes into my mind I think of Margaret."</p>

  <p>"Very strange, is it not?" Kathleen said drily. "Do you know, I experience
  exactly the same feeling. I am going to make my heroine's father the victim
  of mental delusions. All his work and worry, for the time being, have turned
  his brain. He imagines that he has become suddenly poor and given up his fine
  house to take quite humble lodgings. Mind you, his daughter quite thinks that
  the thing is true, and so does her lover. He marries the girl, and suggests
  that her father shall live with them. It is going to be an awful struggle,
  but they do it. The millionaire becomes quite senile, like Captain Cardiff in
  'This Son of Vulcan.' Of course, all the time his partners think he has gone
  for a long voyage for the sake of his health. After he is discovered he comes
  back to his senses again, and there the thing ends happily. I fancy that is
  quite a new and original idea in fiction."</p>

  <p>"It is exceedingly clever," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said with critical
  approval.</p>

  <p>"I fancy that will be a success," said Kathleen. "Don't you think that it
  will be just as well for me to make the heroine hold back at first for fear
  her father should think he had been deceived?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram emphatically thought not.</p>

  <p>"It is this way," she said quite eagerly. "Undoubtedly the girl owed much
  to her father. A child owes much to any parent who does even the ordinary
  duty by her. But natural love and affection for such a man is absolutely out
  of the question. And mind you, the girl's whole happiness is at stake. She
  regarded her real father as being absolutely ruined. Not only had they no
  money, but she was compelled to keep him, and here was a good man wanting to
  marry her. The girl obeys the dictates of a pure affection, as anyone might
  do."</p>

  <p>Kathleen glanced at the figure of Margaret down the garden, and
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"The case is not altogether unlike that of Margaret's," she said. "Oh, my
  dear grandmother, if she could only hear you talk now!"</p>

  <p>A rich flush mounted to Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram's face. She was quite glad to
  see the figure of Reggie Eldred come striding up the path.</p>

  <p>"You have come to luncheon?" she asked, effusively.</p>

  <p>"Well, that depends," Reggie said. "I'm here more or less on business. The
  trustees are bothered about Wanstead. He contends that he is entitled to have
  the lease of the farm renewed on payment of the usual fees. We say that he
  has forfeited that right; in fact, we hope so, as he is a discredit to the
  estate. We shall get rid of him if we can."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram was glad to hear it. There was only one really black
  sheep amongst the whole of the Caradoc tenants, and Wanstead was the man.</p>

  <p>"After all," Reggie went on, "there is nobody who knows the manners and
  customs of the estate as well as yourself. Now, didn't Wanstead's
  father&mdash;who seemed as bad as himself&mdash;sign some release, forty or
  fifty years ago, resigning his rights in the freehold at the end of a certain
  period? I seem to recollect something about it."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram recollected something about it also. Gradually the
  transaction was being fixed in her mind. She had a poor head for details.</p>

  <p>"Quite right," she said. "I recollect the whole business now. The deed was
  signed and placed away in the Tudor muniment chest that stands in the corner
  of the Saxon parlour. As a matter of fact, it ought to have been sent to the
  bank, but my husband's father used the muniment chest for his deeds, as
  generations of Wolframs have done before him. You will find that paper or
  parchment about fifth from the top on the right hand shelf opposite the
  Monmouth papers."</p>

  <p>"What are the Monmouth papers?" asked Kathleen.</p>

  <p>"They have to do with the Monmouth Rebellion," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram
  explained. "Guy Wolfram of Caradoc, for some mad reason, threw in his lot
  with Monmouth. He was caught and beheaded. About ten years after, his cousin,
  Eldred Wolfram (from whence the family got its present double name), was
  presented to the estates for some notable exploit, and by deed the property
  was conveyed absolutely to him to do as he pleased with. The break in the
  succession was made so that the estates might not revert by death or other
  accident to Guy Wolfram's family. The papers are really very interesting
  reading."</p>

  <p>"I should just think they would be!" Kathleen exclaimed. "What a wonderful
  place Caradoc is! I have only to open my eyes and ask a few questions, and
  here are plots by the score ready to one's hand. I should like to see those
  papers."</p>

  <p>"You shall this very day," Reggie said. "I have ascertained that our
  friend, Lawson Waddy, is out of town, so I shall take this opportunity of
  fetching that release away. If you like to come along, Kathleen, it will be a
  famous chance to look at the Monmouth papers."</p>

  <p>Kathleen jumped eagerly at the opportunity. From a huge pile Cedric
  produced a quaint key with a number on it, and, armed with this weapon,
  Kathleen and her lover crossed the fields towards Caradoc. A number of men
  were at work here and there, smart, alert-looking workmen, with badges on
  their caps. Kathleen gave a little gasp.</p>

  <p>"National Telephone Company," she said. "Also British Electric Company. My
  dearest boy, try and picture a telephone and electric light at Caradoc! Has
  that man no sense of decency? I wonder you are not ashamed to leave all those
  documents in his charge."</p>

  <p>"They have only historic value," Reggie said. "Though if I had my way they
  would all be sent to the bank. Still, I suppose they are safe enough in those
  big oak chests."</p>

  <p>Kathleen felt dubious, but she did not press the point. In imagination she
  was already busy on another story, which had for its plot the worsting of Mr.
  Lawson Waddy and his discomfited exit from Caradoc. She felt that she could
  put her heart into that.</p>

  <p>"They don't seem to be doing much damage," she grudgingly admitted. "The
  holes in the ceiling are small. But, small as they are, it seems like
  sacrilege."</p>

  <p>They were in the house now, passing through the familiar rooms. A smart,
  supercilious London footman had hesitated to admit them, but a junior servant
  imported from the estate signified that it was all right. There was the Saxon
  parlour at last; the giant key was fitted into the equally giant lock and the
  lid of the dower-chest thrown back. There was a faint, mouldy smell from the
  many documents inside. Reggie had not far to search. The release was found
  exactly as Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said it would be.</p>

  <p>"I fancy this disposes of Wanstead," he said in a satisfied voice, as he
  cast his eye over the parchment. "The estates will benefit by his absence.
  Come along."</p>

  <p>"Certainly not, sir," Kathleen said with decision. "I do not accompany you
  merely to seek for an instrument to destroy the happiness of some
  down-trodden tenant. On the contrary, I came quite expressly to have a look
  at the Monmouth papers."</p>

  <p>Reggie apologised, he had quite forgotten that. From one of the shelves in
  the mouldy smelling chest he produced a package of parchment, faded and
  yellow, and yet with the cramped letters still quite clear and distinct. One
  with a huge seal and a scrawling signature attracted Katie's attention.</p>

  <p>"This looks very choice," she said. "What a great seal, to be sure!
  'James, King, Defender of the Faith, to Aubyn Eldred-Wolfram, greeting.' Why,
  that must be James II. I suppose that is the great seal and the royal
  signature."</p>

  <p>"Nothing less," Reggie said. "You can make out every word with a little
  care. 'To Aubyn Eldred-Wolfram and the heirs male of his body for ever.'
  Isn't that quite clear? Really, I shall have to get the trustees to remove
  these papers."</p>

  <p>"Found anything interesting?" a quick yet mincing voice said from behind.
  "Upon my word, I am getting a taste for this kind of thing myself. If I had
  time I should develop into all antiquary. I beg your pardon, Miss Wolfram, I
  hardly saw you in that dark corner."</p>

  <p>Reggie crushed down his annoyance and was fain to take the much be-ringed
  hand that Lawson Waddy tendered to him. He had expressly waited for a day
  when he had felt quite sure that the master of the house would be away, and
  here he was, overdressed, over-confident, and presumably hospitable.</p>

  <p>"Of course, you'll stay to lunch," he said. "I fancy my cook will give you
  every satisfaction."</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately it's impossible," Reggie said. "I came over here to get
  this deed from yonder chest; I had not the slightest idea of intruding. Only
  Miss Wolfram found some interesting historic documents, and they have
  fascinated her so that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lawson Waddy flicked up the electric light. There were no shades attached
  to the glowing bulbs yet, so that the light was garish and repulsive to a
  degree. But Kathleen did not notice that for the moment. The strange glare
  fell on the table where the documents lay and she could read every word of
  the cramped writing now.</p>

  <p>"The amount of stuff of interest here is amazing," Waddy went on, not in
  the least chilled by the cold politeness of Reggie's manner. "I have a
  first-class photographer down here, and most of the things have come under
  the eye of the camera. Fact is, I'm going to reproduce them. Amongst other
  things, I've got a new art journal coming out, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You have the consent of the trustees?" Reggie asked crisply.</p>

  <p>Mr. Lawson Waddy had not troubled about that formality. As tenant of the
  house, it seemed to him that he had a perfect right to do this kind of thing.
  It would be an advertisement, he said, the thing would be talked about,
  paragraphed in the papers, in all probability everybody concerned would find
  themselves subjects of an illustrated interview before it was all over.</p>

  <p>"That would indeed be something like fame," Reggie said gravely. But the
  sarcasm was wasted on the other; he was absolutely destitute of the faintest
  spark of humour. "I suppose that some people really like that kind of
  thing."</p>

  <p>"Like it!" Lawson Waddy exclaimed. "Why, they grovel for it. Publicity is
  the breath of life to the smart brigade. Ask Miss Wolfram what she
  thinks."</p>

  <p>Kathleen smiled vaguely. She was understood to say that she had been
  interviewed many times already, and that the process was by no means
  unpleasant.</p>

  <p>"Not that I should ever seek for it," she said, "ever angle for it. But it
  does flatter your vanity to be told that the readers of a great paper are
  anxious to know something of you. At least, that is my feeling."</p>

  <p>"It seems strange, but I can't share it," Reggie said. "On the whole Mr.
  Waddy, I must ask you to desist from making the goods and chattels at Caradoc
  public property. The great aspiring multitude must get their education
  elsewhere."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear fellow, you really don't object?" Waddy cried. "The thing is
  absurd. I have already spent some thousands over the matter. If I were to go
  to any of the great homes and make me same suggestion, I should be invited to
  dinner, egad."</p>

  <p>Reggie thought it extremely unlikely, but declined to argue the matter. He
  was quite sure that the trustees would object; under the circumstances of the
  case it would be an outrage to the feelings of Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram. He had
  not the slightest wish to make himself objectionable, but he must put his
  foot down here. He spoke with great determination.</p>

  <p>"And if I object altogether?" Waddy asked. His mincing voice had grown
  truculent.</p>

  <p>"Then we shall have to move for an injunction," Reggie said. "As a family
  we have always kept rigidly to ourselves. We have nothing in common with the
  modern smart county set. These things are copyright; you know perfectly well
  that it is not permissible to photograph public buildings for the purpose of
  trade without permission. We shall strongly object to our chairs and tables
  and bedsteads being placed in the hands of an inquisitive public."</p>

  <p>"We had better argue the matter out legally," Waddy suggested.</p>

  <p>"And thereby secure for yourself a first class gratis advertisement for
  the new journal," Reggie said with sarcastic emphasis. "Do you quite
  understand the position, sir? If this goes any further we shall have to
  remove the old furniture altogether."</p>

  <p>Waddy laughed somewhat insolently. Did the speaker know that he had taken
  the house furnished? What did he regard as a furnished house?</p>

  <p>"A furnished house is one where the place is properly appointed for
  letting," Reggie said. Kathleen, deep in her parchments, heard nothing of the
  discussion. "Let me point out to you that the old furniture is not furniture
  in the ordinary sense of the word, but heirlooms. They are not part of the
  house, they belong to the estate. You will find, sir, that if we like to
  remove these things, you have not the smallest legal remedy."</p>

  <p>Something strong and defiant trembled on the lips of the journalist. He
  looked away to where Kathleen was standing. She had finished her perusal of
  the yellow parchment.</p>

  <p>"It is very interesting," she said, "the signature of King James II."</p>

  <p>"What have you got there?" Waddy asked with a sudden change of manner.
  "Very interesting indeed. A grant of the estates to Eldred-Wolfram some time
  after the Monmouth rebellion? Pray lock it up or I shall be tempted to have
  it photographed. Mr. Eldred, I am sorry that I have done anything that seems
  offensive in your eyes. It never occurred to me that the family might object.
  Pray think no more about the matter, the loss shall be mine."</p>

  <p>Reggie murmured something, but he was too astonished to be quite coherent.
  He could not possibly account for the sudden change for the better in the
  manner of his opponent. He wondered vaguely if the James II. grant had
  anything to do with it, but that seemed absurd. Mr. Waddy's new politeness
  lasted till he had seen his visitors off the premises. He went back to the
  Saxon parlour and there lighted a cigarette. A closer inspection of the dower
  chest seemed to satisfy him.</p>

  <p>"The lock can easily be unscrewed without anyone being any the wiser," he
  muttered. "So then the story that drunken little lawyer's clerk told Wybrow
  was true, after all. If we can prove that, I'll humble the pride of these
  people for them. I'll settle the point to-day."</p>

  <p>Waddy passed into the library, where he wrote a telegram. It was not a
  long message, and it seemed to give him a wonderful degree of
  satisfaction&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Wybrow, London,&mdash;Have discovered that Rackstraw's tale is quite
  true. Come down here to-night by the 5.15 train and dine and sleep here."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; A DISCOVERY</h2>

  <p class="first">Daylight was at odds with the darkness, so that the candles
in the big
  silver sconces seemed faint under their red shades. It was a warm evening,
  and the party at Beacon Lodge dined with the windows open, so that the scent
  of the flowers came in; the rough note of a landrail came in with a certain
  suggestion of drowsiness.</p>

  <p>It all looked so strangely familiar and yet so different; here were the
  old pictures and silver and china, there sat the mistress of all exactly as
  she had been wont to do at Caradoc, though she was gentler and quieter now
  and her features were tranquil. An indescribable refinement lay over
  everything, that nameless charm that goes with a well-ordered home. Cedric
  had set out the dessert and vanished; Kathleen was demurely eating
  strawberries and cream.</p>

  <p>"I thought Dr. Dennison was coming in to dinner," she said presently.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram nodded. Dennison frequently came now, the mistress of
  the house professed to be greatly charmed with his voice. But a few months
  ago that gift would never have obtained for him the entree of Caradoc.
  Reggie, discreetly busy with his raspberries, smiled at Kathleen.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately the doctor could not come," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said. "The
  calls of duty, you understand. Really, I find he is most kind to the poorer
  people on the estate. And they are so selfish when they get hold of a really
  sympathetic doctor. Old Betty Timms does not really require a doctor, and yet
  he goes."</p>

  <p>"Dennison is a good fellow," Reggie said. "And a gentleman to his finger
  tips. Let us hope that we will have the pleasure of his company later in the
  evening."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram hoped so also. She was pleased to approve of a fruit
  salad that had made its appearance earlier at the table. Edna laughed.</p>

  <p>"I made it," she said. "No, I am not going to have my efforts criticised.
  If my dear grandmother suggests that there are too many strawberries, I
  contradict her flatly."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram smiled. Kathleen smiled too, but only at her own
  thoughts. The emancipation of the twins was complete. If either of them had
  anything to say, they stated it boldly; only the night before Phillipa had
  actually criticised Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram's dress cap. They had taken
  possession of the house, and they were managing it very capably indeed. The
  twins had developed unexpected talents that nobody had ever guessed
  before.</p>

  <p>"I always had a passion for fruit salads from a boy," Reggie said.
  "Whenever I saw one abroad it always brought Caradoc to my mind. And we have
  Caradoc on a small scale here."</p>

  <p>"I like this place infinitely better," Phillipa said boldly. "It isn't so
  awfully depressing, and one does not feel so small. Besides, one can be
  useful here."</p>

  <p>"There is no place in the world like Caradoc," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram sighed.
  "Certainly no place that ever suited me half so well."</p>

  <p>"That is mere sentiment," Edna said boldly. "My dear grandmother, if you
  would only confess it, you are better in health now than you have been for
  years. You have taken up certain duties that occupy your time to the
  exclusion of the contemplation of a great position. Now we are not going to
  allow you&mdash;even after dinner&mdash;to pose as a martyr."</p>

  <p>Reggie glanced with admiration at the speaker. He waited for the majestic
  wrath to follow. But Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram only smiled at the audacious
  speaker.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you are right," she said mildly. "Still it is good for old people
  to cherish illusions, especially if they are pleasant ones. Reggie, you may
  smoke your cigarette here if you like. It is a concession to the spirit of
  the times."</p>

  <p>"They certainly are moving rapidly," Reggie said drily. "We shall have the
  twins quite grown up before we know what has happened. I'll sit in the
  verandah and smoke. Won't you come outside?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram excused herself. A glorious moon was rising, behind a
  delicate lacework of green leaves, turning them to a wondrous golden pattern.
  The landrail was still croaking his harsh note, down somewhere in the water
  meadows.</p>

  <p>"Then the others must come out," Reggie cried. "Positively, I'm too
  unselfish to keep the glorious moonlight all to myself. Margaret, come and
  talk to me."</p>

  <p>But Margaret had a drawing that she must finish at once, and the twins had
  a heap of freshly-cut flowers to arrange. Only Kathleen was idle. She slipped
  out on to the balcony, and sat there dreamily, as Reggie lay back in the full
  enjoyment of his tobacco. Apparently Margaret was not long over her drawing,
  as presently the dreamy music of the organ stole out on the still air.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to see Reggie and Kathleen such good friends," Mrs.
  Eldred-Wolfram said placidly, as she sat over some knitting. "No, please
  don't close the window; it is only when outside that I feel the night air.
  Reggie and Kathleen seem to get on so well together."</p>

  <p>"We have noticed the same thing," Edna said demurely. "Unfortunately, our
  early chances were blighted by the relegated episcopal charity frocks. Reggie
  never admired us."</p>

  <p>"Except perhaps as curios," Phillipa put in.</p>

  <p>"I begin to fear that Reggie is not a marrying man," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram
  went on. "At first I had hopes that he and Margaret&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Margaret ought to be a saint or the wife of a great philanthropist," said
  Edna. "Or perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The wife of a doctor with a large practice," Phillipa suggested
  mischievously.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram wisely ignored the suggestions and discreetly admired
  the arrangement of the flowers. Of course Reggie would marry some time, for
  the sake of the family and for the utter confusion of those people at
  Saltash. Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram's fears would have been considerably modified
  could she have seen Reggie and Kathleen at that moment. The cigarette was
  finished, and the two had strolled down the garden together. The light of the
  moon touched Kathleen's face softly&mdash;her pretty face looked very sweet
  and serious. With his arm about her, Reggie asked her thoughts.</p>

  <p>"I had Margaret in my mind at the moment," Kathleen said. "Reggie, have
  you noticed how much better and stronger Margaret has been of late?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly I have," Reggie replied. "She is getting quite a colour.
  Perhaps the place suits her."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it does, but the frequency of Dr. Dennison's visits of late suit
  her a great deal better. Reggie, she loves him with her whole heart and soul,
  and none the less because he has saved her life. It is one of the prettiest
  and tenderest love romances in the world, and I have taken the liberty of
  borrowing it for my new book. I want the book and the real story both to end
  well."</p>

  <p>"Doesn't it depend upon Dennison?" Reggie suggested. "He is in an
  excellent position, and eventually he will be master of a very pretty
  fortune. If he likes to put his foot down&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Margaret will do anything he likes in that case. But that is not in the
  least what I want&mdash;it is far too commonplace and prosaic. And Margaret
  is so sensitive. I want my grandmother to smile on the match, and I think I
  shall bring it about."</p>

  <p>"Of course you will," Reggie said, with the flattering confidence of the
  lover. "If you can't do it, nobody can, and if you fail, I'll use my
  tremendous influence!"</p>

  <p>"That is exactly what I wanted to ask you," Kathleen said. "But I would
  much rather do it all off my own bat, as the boys say. Now, I am going to
  tell you what my little scheme is."</p>

  <p>Reggie listened with Kathleen's head on his shoulder and her lips close to
  his ear. Told in the moonlight, it sounded tender and charming enough.
  Looking back to the house Margaret could be seen at her organ, the red
  flowers gleaming wine dark behind her slender head. The long French windows
  were open to the lawn, so that the picture was complete.</p>

  <p>"It's charming," Reggie cried with effusion, "perfectly charming. And the
  wonderful artfulness of the girl. Dearest, I am positively afraid of you. And
  now I must really be going if I am to catch the last train back to
  Castleford. It's like leaving Paradise, but still&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Kathleen lingered at the gate until Reggie had disappeared round a turn in
  the road. A tall figure coming from the other direction stopped and raised
  his hat.</p>

  <p>"Better late than never, Dr. Dennison," Kathleen said. "Reggie has run off
  to catch his train back to Castleford, and left me desolate and alone. Won't
  you go up to the house? No, I am going to stay here and dream out the next
  chapter of my new book."</p>

  <p>Dennison passed on up the path and entered the drawing-room by means of
  the window. Even if structural possibilities had admitted, such a thing would
  never have been dreamed of at Caradoc, as Edna gravely pointed out, in the
  absence of Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram upstairs hunting for a mislaid pattern.</p>

  <p>Dennison murmured something that sounded like a compliment, but Phillipa
  waved it aside.</p>

  <p>"Don't waste your sweetness on us," she said. "We do not deserve it; we
  have not been educated up to it. Gather your rose buds whilst you
  may&mdash;in other words, as our dear godmother is out of the way, you will
  have Margaret all to yourself."</p>

  <p>"In my time," Edna said solemnly, "young men were not so backward."</p>

  <p>Dennison took the hint and retired. Presently Kathleen, standing by the
  gate, could see the two talking earnestly together; she could see the twins
  also busy over their flowers. She saw Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram return, and in a
  sudden impulse Kathleen fetched her out.</p>

  <p>"Positively, I am not going to let you stay indoors," she said. "I am
  going to place this big shawl over your head and your shoulders, and we are
  going to walk up and down and abuse the neighbours. I feel pleased with
  myself, because I have thought of another good idea for the book."</p>

  <p>"I haven't heard what you have written to-day yet," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram
  said, interested at once.</p>

  <p>"My dear, I have written a most important chapter. You will remember that
  the heroine's father loses his reason and imagines himself to be penniless.
  The daughter and her husband believe the delusion to be true. They have got
  very poor indeed&mdash;in fact, their home is going to be sold up. They have
  made themselves poor in order that the benighted millionaire may have all he
  needs. As reason comes back to him he hears everything in a discussion. He is
  not quite sure even now whether he has lost his money or not. He goes to the
  little room that has been set apart for him, and sees the pile of letters
  which have remained unopened. There he finds plenty of evidence of the fact
  that he is still rich. What do you think of that?"</p>

  <p>"Splendid!" Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram cried. "What is coming next?"</p>

  <p>"That I have been just working out," Kathleen said. "I want a pretty
  tableau that will bring the erring man to his knees, and then the story will
  be practically complete. This tableau&mdash;well, it is terribly like spying,
  but I require something like that."</p>

  <p>Kathleen indicated the open window of the room where Margaret stood with
  her back to the organ, a faint smile on her face. Dennison had both her hands
  in his, and was looking eagerly down into the face of his companion as he
  talked. It was a pretty picture cut out of the darkness, and Mrs.
  Eldred-Wolfram caught her breath as she looked.</p>

  <p>"Margaret seemed transformed," she murmured. "Kathleen, she is quite
  beautiful."</p>

  <p>"Margaret has one of the most tranquilly beautiful faces in the world,"
  Kathleen said quietly. "Do you know she has been more or less my heroine. The
  gentle girl who holds duty before love. Do you not understand what I mean,
  dear?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram murmured something. A sudden light had broken in upon
  her. She seemed to be looking into her own mind and seeing the selfishness
  that her pride had built up about her. She would have spoken from her heart
  then, but Cedric came gliding down the path. She turned her head, held high,
  as if something was distasteful to her sense of smell.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Lawson Waddy would speak to you for a moment, madam," said he, as if
  repeating a lesson. "He desires to apologise for his intrusion at such a
  time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How did he manage to get here?" Kathleen exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"By the side gate, miss," Cedric explained. "And he further wanted me to
  say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I will see him," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said. She was hard and cold enough
  now, so that Kathleen feared for the success of her parable. "I must convince
  Mr. Waddy that his presence here is not desirable. If he must intrude, he
  might have chosen a more reasonable time."</p>

  <p>Mr. Waddy was waiting with some signs of impatience in the drawing-room.
  There was no fault to find with his evening attire, save that he affected a
  double collar. He was the sort of man that one might instinctively expect to
  wear a double collar with a dress coat.</p>

  <p>"I am exceedingly sorry to intrude upon you," he said. "I'm afraid that is
  the right word&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I cannot quarrel with your choice of it," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said
  coldly. "Your business&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I will come to that at once," Waddy said, with a fascinating smile.
  Thick-skinned as he was, the manner of his involuntary hostess galled him.
  "But it is somewhat difficult to explain matters of this kind to a lady. I
  daresay you will recollect that after the ill-fated Monmouth Rebellion the
  estates of Caradoc passed from the holder to his cousin, Aubyn
  Eldred-Wolfram. There was a deed, you know?"</p>

  <p>"Signed by James II., sir. Yes, I recollect it perfectly well."</p>

  <p>"Well under that deed certain contingencies may happen. They are very
  remote, but still under that deed certain privileges may revert to you. I
  need not go into details. If ever the property came into the
  market&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Which is not at all likely, sir."</p>

  <p>"Pardon me," Waddy said eagerly. "The thing is possible. It only means the
  collapse of three or four lives. Take the case of the Paddingham peerage, for
  instance. Four years ago there were nine lives, and at the present moment the
  barony is extinct. The same thing might happen here. If I purchased your
  contingencies and the property came into the market, I should get it much
  cheaper if I were disposed to buy. Or I could sell the contingencies for a
  good profit. At the present moment you would be glad to receive a large sum
  of money. I am prepared to pay you £40,000."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram fairly gasped. Just for the moment her dignity
  collapsed utterly. Such a sum of money seemed beyond her wildest dreams. With
  that she could pay all her creditors, she could bring to her knees those who
  had so insulted her, she could take up the income allowed by the trustees,
  and, best of all, she could pay off the money that Major Wiltshire had
  advanced to save her from the wrath of the Court of Chancery.</p>

  <p>"If you would be so kind as to go into details?" she faltered.</p>

  <p>"Details, my dear madam, are quite superfluous," Waddy said glibly.
  "Really, I am offering you a fancy price for what may be absolutely
  worthless. I am acting on impulse; I may repent of my offer within a week.
  You have only to sign a deed and the cheque is yours at once."</p>

  <p>"If my solicitors draw up the deed, when&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why trouble your solicitors? I have mine at Caradoc at this moment. Under
  the assignment made by James II., and given by him to Aubyn
  Eldred-Wolfram&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Waddy paused as the curtains were pushed back and Kathleen entered.</p>

  <p>"I was in the verandah," she said. "I could hot help listening. Under the
  grant you speak of&mdash;but we need not go into that at present.
  Grandmother, Mr. Waddy has made a strange discovery. Would you kindly ask him
  to fetch the grant from Caradoc and bring it here. Ask Cedric for the key.
  Mr. Waddy knows exactly in which dower chest to find the grant, for he saw it
  replaced by Reggie the other morning. It is a lot of money to give."</p>

  <p>"It is indeed," Waddy stammered, lost of all his usual self-possession and
  very red in the face. "If I may venture to intrude upon you again so late at
  night&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My grandmother will pardon that under the circumstances," Kathleen said
  quietly.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash; VIVE LE ROI</h2>

  <p class="first">Kathleen looked curiously at the little man in the doorway.
He appeared to
  have lost a good deal of his native assurance during the last few minutes. He
  was not at all at his ease; the most casual spectator would have detected in
  him a sense of inferiority.</p>

  <p>"Does Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram want the document to-night, really?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>Kathleen signified that she did. The elder lady might have been eager, but
  she disguised her feelings carefully. Still Waddy's offer was revolving like
  a wheel in her brain.</p>

  <p>A few months ago she would have discussed the raising or spending of
  £40,000 with perfect equanimity, but the environment was different now. There
  would be something magnificent in sweeping over those recalcitrant creditors
  and reducing them to mere grovelling worms wriggling under her feet.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Kathleen went on. "You can easily be back in a quarter of an
  hour, and the time is not so very late. I will get the keys from Cedric."</p>

  <p>The girl reappeared presently with the key, which Waddy accepted
  mechanically. As a matter of fact he had no need for them, seeing that he had
  unscrewed the hinges of the dower chest, and, together with his lawyer, had
  been poring over that historic parchment for the last hour. Still, it was not
  exactly policy to acquaint Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram with that fact.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram sat back in her chair dreaming dreams. Even Kathleen's
  imagination was no more vivid than her own at that moment. She was under a
  deep obligation to Major Wiltshire, and no specious sophistry could alter
  that fact. To pay the major off would be a supreme satisfaction. At that
  moment Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram would have cheerfully signed anything and asked no
  questions.</p>

  <p>"I don't like that man," Kathleen said. "There is something under-handed
  about him. He is a vulgar money-making machine, and I am sure he is not very
  scrupulous over his methods. If he pays you all that money, you may be sure
  he sees his way to make as much more for himself."</p>

  <p>"He said something about a speculation," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram murmured.</p>

  <p>"My dear grandmother, nobody values money more or grudges parting with it
  than the man who has already made more than he knows what to do with. Mr.
  Waddy has found something out; he has discovered that you are entitled to
  something or other, and he proposes to buy it. He argues that you are not
  likely to seek advice, that you will act on your own judgment, and ask no
  questions. I should not sign anything until I had had the advice of the
  family solicitors."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram saw no necessity to do anything of the kind. The forty
  thousand pounds dazzled her, and blinded what little business judgment she
  possessed. She was quite capable of managing her own affairs, as she reminded
  Kathleen with some dignity. She regarded this money as a god-send; she would
  be able to hold up her head once more. The paean of the family glory was in
  full blast when Waddy returned. He laid the parchment on the table as if loth
  to part with it.</p>

  <p>"It requires a trained legal head to understand that," he said. "My own
  lawyer, who has seen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The little man paused in some confusion, conscious that Kathleen's eyes
  were upon him. Kathleen was asking herself many questions, and her distrust
  of Waddy deepened.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," she said coolly, "it strikes me as a singularly clear
  and luminous document. I should like to read it again whilst you discuss
  matters with my grandmother."</p>

  <p>Mr. Waddy naturally had no objection. He was quite himself now; there was
  a smooth oiliness about him that many rising authors, prepared to take a
  small honorarium for early work, found quite pleasing. But Kathleen saw and
  heard nothing of this; she was deep in the parchment.</p>

  <p>"Then that is settled," she heard Waddy say at length. "I will bring over
  the papers the first thing in the morning, and you can sign them and take my
  cheque. Really, it is a tremendous deal of money to part with for so remote a
  contingency."</p>

  <p>"Is it a contingency at all?" Kathleen asked in a clear, cold voice.</p>

  <p>Lawson Waddy smilingly admitted that it was a very remote one. As to his
  money&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Your money is perfectly safe," Kathleen went on. "A year or two ago, when
  I first began to write, I did a little story, the plot of which turned upon a
  point of law. In my ignorance of legal matters, I accepted words to mean what
  they said instead of directly opposite. A man sold a certain piece of
  property, and afterwards it turned out it was left to him and 'his heirs for
  ever,' so I assumed that as it was so disposed the man could not legally sell
  it. But, as a lawyer friend of the family subsequently pointed out, those
  very words 'his heirs for ever,' gave him absolute control over the property.
  Now, Caradoc was strictly entailed until the time of James II. When the
  property was conveyed to Aubyn Eldred-Wolfram by the deed, it was granted to
  him and his heirs for ever. If you like to look here, you can see the very
  words. If I make no mistake, the deed enables any rightful owner of the
  property to leave it where he pleases. The fact has been overlooked all these
  centuries, and the property treated as if it had been strictly entailed. But
  that is not a fact. Grandmother, did my grandfather make a will in your
  favour before he died?"</p>

  <p>"Of course he did, my dear," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram replied. "He left
  everything he possessed to me. It was a very simple document, as there was
  very little to leave."</p>

  <p>Kathleen brought her hand emphatically down on the historic parchment.</p>

  <p>"You are quite wrong," she said, breathlessly. Her eyes were shining with
  the light of a great discovery. "He left you Caradoc. It was absolutely his.
  There was no entail in the property; there was no entail on heirlooms, no
  limitations whatever. Unless I am greatly mistaken, Caradoc and all there is
  yours to give away to the first beggar that come along if you like."</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram exclaimed. "Kathleen, you must be
  wrong."</p>

  <p>"No," Kathleen said drily, "ask your lawyer. If you want confirmation of
  what I say, look at Mr. Waddy and ask him."</p>

  <p>Mr. Lawson Waddy was not good to look upon just at that moment. His face
  was a fine study in mixed emotions. He was angry and sore and disappointed;
  moreover he had been found out, and he disliked nothing more than that. He
  protested with flabby dignity, but nobody was deceived.</p>

  <p>"I don't know where Mr. Waddy got his information from," Kathleen went on,
  "nor does it matter. Probably a clever but unscrupulous clerk in the office
  of the family lawyers made the discovery, and kept the secret with an eye to
  ultimate gain. Mr. Waddy, have I guessed right?"</p>

  <p>For Waddy had started guiltily. That was exactly what had happened. A
  dissipated clerk, digging amongst the family archives for one thing, had
  found another. The knowledge had seemed cheap to buy at the small price asked
  for it, and the rest was easy. Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram would do anything silly
  for a round sum of money, and she would not live much longer in the ordinary
  course of things. Once she was dead, Waddy could spring the great discovery
  as a new fact upon Reggie Eldred. For a comparatively small outlay the whole
  of the magnificent Caradoc estate would be Waddy's. Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram would
  sign any document put before her, and this particular one was to be the
  assignment of her contingent interests in Caradoc.</p>

  <p>"There may be something in what you say," Waddy stammered.</p>

  <p>"I am absolutely certain of it, and that I am right," Kathleen went on.
  "You say your lawyer and yourself have been carefully through this paper.
  That I can quite believe. That you have also known of its existence for some
  time I am equally certain. We will keep the parchment, sir, and, if I am
  wrong, why, then, I shall have to ask your pardon for the rudeness, and will
  promise most carefully to refrain from interfering any further in any
  business transaction between Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram and yourself."</p>

  <p>Mr. Waddy got away finally with what little dignity remained to him.</p>

  <p>"That is the last of your tenant," Kathleen said. "He will not come back
  here again. What a dishonourable, cowardly thing to do! Has your modern
  money-grubber any scruples at all? My dear grandmother, we must have the
  family lawyer down here to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram paced up and down the room in a kind of waking dream.
  Not for a moment did she entertain any doubt as to the soundness of
  Kathleen's theory. As the head of a great family, she knew all about the law
  of entail and progeniture, and all that kind of thing. And she had heard of
  cases on similar lines before. If Kathleen was right, then Caradoc and all
  that was therein became absolutely her own. She could take possession again,
  administer the revenues, and sell every heirloom there, in spite of a dozen
  courts of Chancery. The new, placid look had gone from her face already; she
  had called back all the haughty pride and dignity that had clothed her like a
  garment when first Kathleen came to Caradoc.</p>

  <p>"I owe you much for this," she said, in a curiously even voice. "I should
  have signed that paper and asked no questions. It seems to me that Caradoc is
  my own again; I need not consult anybody. The Court of Chancery has gone
  beyond its powers. Mr. Lawson Waddy is not the tenant of Caradoc at all; I
  could turn him out of the house to-morrow. Oh, I shall enjoy that!"</p>

  <p>"I shall enjoy that part of the programme myself," Kathleen said
  dubiously. "But, grandmother, you will do nothing rash. We have been here
  only a short time, but I fancy we have all been very happy at Beacon
  Lodge."</p>

  <p>But Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram was not listening. A change for the worse had come
  over her already. Kathleen was troubled in her mind as she went to bed. She
  was not the less troubled when the old Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram came down to
  breakfast. She had slipped into her pride again, and it seemed to fit her as
  well as ever. She was distant and haughty to Margaret, she was severe as to
  the dress of the twins, and commanded certain modifications. Edna and
  Phillipa, not in the secret, looked aghast. Then they rose to the fray.</p>

  <p>"I thought that was all done with," Edna said, with outward calm. "My dear
  godmother, we can't go back to the old life; that is impossible; but we can
  go on to the new life."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram shifted her ground a little. She did not quite
  understand.</p>

  <p>"Go out into the world and get our own living," Phillipa explained. "Oh,
  we mean it. After all is said and done, we should make rather
  attractive-looking shop assistants."</p>

  <p>"The conversations is getting distinctly vulgar," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram
  said. "Besides, we are going back to Caradoc. Kathleen will tell you all
  about it after breakfast."</p>

  <p>Kathleen had an interested gallery of listeners when the morning meal was
  finished. Cedric had been dispatched quite early to send a telegram to
  London, and Kathleen had barely finished her recital when Reggie rode over,
  and the story had to be gone over again.</p>

  <p>"So that puts your nose out of joint," Edna said, with a mirthless
  laugh.</p>

  <p>"I wasn't thinking of myself," Reggie said thoughtfully. "Under the new
  condition of things, the heirship to Caradoc won't be worth much. By the time
  our respected relative is no more, the property will be a pleasing vision of
  the past. The only good feature I can see is the extinguishing of Waddy."</p>

  <p>"I should have liked to have seen his face," Phillipa said, bubbling over
  into a laugh.</p>

  <p>Kathleen gave a graphic little picture of the discomfited journalist, but
  nobody laughed. A sense of impending misfortune seemed to hang like a cloud
  over the little group. They had all been getting so happy and comfortable at
  Beacon Lodge, Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram had so changed for the better.</p>

  <p>"And now we shall go back to the old business," Reggie prophesied
  gloomily. "I don't care a hang about it myself, and in any case I shall have
  all Major Wiltshire's money presently. But I wanted to see my aunt and my
  mother friends. Now, I am afraid that it is out of the question. Mrs.
  Eldred-Wolfram will pay the major, and send him a letter that will make
  matters ten times worse. Hang Waddy and his discoveries!"</p>

  <p>It was late in the afternoon before the family lawyer came down. For an
  hour or more he was closeted with Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram, after which he
  returned to town with the historic document in his possession. Cedric came
  out on the lawn presently and summoned the little party there to tea. He was
  the Cedric of old once more, but, on the whole, he did not appear to
  appreciate the change. There was no smile on Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram's face as
  she sat in the drawing-room, though she looked blandly self-satisfied.</p>

  <p>"It is all as I expected," she said. "Kathleen was quite right; I am very
  pleased."</p>

  <p>"And I am downright sorry," Kathleen burst, out passionately. "I have been
  hoping and praying all the morning that I had blundered. I trusted that we
  were not going back to Caradoc any more. It is a grand old place, but it is
  too cold and dignified for me. Here we have worth and love, and kindly
  feeling all round, and everybody pulling together. There it was nothing but
  dullness and dignity. I could not go back there."</p>

  <p>"Could not go back to Caradoc," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said. "The girl is
  mad."</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry," Kathleen subdued herself with an effort. "I am very
  sorry, but I shall stay here. If we can take back the air of affection and
  feeling, well and good, but not under the old conditions. You can never
  really refasten broken ties perfectly. I could not see the twins once more in
  white frocks and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Calm yourself," Edna said coolly. "The ghost of the white frocks is laid
  for ever."</p>

  <p>Reggie, with a man's want of moral courage under the circumstances, had
  slipped out into the garden. Margaret made off presently to find consolation
  in her organ. It was in vain that Kathleen wished Reggie to stay to dinner.
  The rebellion might break out again at any moment, and he dreaded a
  scene.</p>

  <p>"But were you really in earnest?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"My dear boy, we all were, except Margaret, that is. Wherever Mrs.
  Eldred-Wolfram goes, Margaret goes. She is a martyr to duty. And yet I had
  hoped to see her finally engaged to Dr. Dennison before the week was out.
  Reggie, I can't go back to Caradoc unless we take our cheerful condition with
  us. I am earning quite enough money to live here comfortably, and the twins
  can remain for the present. If they go back to Caradoc the white frocks and
  the hideous bonnets are inevitable."</p>

  <p>"It's a case of tete montee," Reggie groaned. "Can't you suggest
  anything?"</p>

  <p>But Kathleen had nothing to suggest now or after dinner. She walked about
  the garden disconsolately. Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram came out presently and joined
  her. She was still profoundly dignified, but more or less human. She did not
  forget to ask after the progress of the novel.</p>

  <p>"It has gone out of my head, for the present," Kathleen confessed. "Not a
  line have I written to-day. Just for the moment the spell is broken. I had
  quite a personal interest in my hero and heroine. You see they were the means
  to an end."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram was silent for a moment. She could see the twins
  talking moodily in the drawing-room; she could see Margaret bent over the
  organ. The music was low and sad to-night.</p>

  <p>"I can't make out why everybody should be so miserable when things have
  gone so wonderfully," she said. "I can't think why everybody is so
  changed."</p>

  <p>Kathleen took her courage in both hands. She was was going to speak
  openly.</p>

  <p>"We have not changed," she said. "The change is yourself. For the past few
  weeks I have watched you carefully. I saw all the dignity and coldness
  falling from you. I marked with delight how the human interest in my story
  pleased you. I saw you were different to the twins and Margaret and I
  rejoiced. For myself, I cared nothing. But now it is all different, you are
  going to be the haughty mistress of Caradoc again, and Margaret will droop
  and wither. Sometimes we shall come over and cheer her up if we
  may&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear Kathleen, you speak as if you were going to remain here!"</p>

  <p>"And so I am. And so are Edna and Phillipa. Be your own natural self
  again, and we will beg to come along. But for the present we stay here. If I
  have said too much, forgive me."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram turned and walked slowly back to the house,
  thinking.</p>

  <p>The new order of things, or rather the reversion to the old order, did not
  give her the pleasure she had anticipated. Would she but have owned it, she
  was utterly miserable. She sat in her room thinking, long after the house was
  quiet. She could not sleep; she had no desire to go to bed. She pulled up the
  blind and looked over the peaceful landscape, so still in the light of the
  waning moon. Why had she that strange pain at her heart, she wondered. As she
  sat there her eyes grew wet, a tear trickled over her cheeks. Still, she must
  be firm; she must not give way. In the morning she would insist upon an
  understanding.</p>

  <p>"I almost wish it hadn't come," she murmured. "I almost wish. Why disguise
  it! From the bottom of my heart I am sorry that old document ever came to
  light again. If I had only burnt it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; THE SHADOW ON THE HEARTH</h2>

  <p class="first">A bronze gong jangled under Cedric's unaccustomed hand, and
he wished for
  the ship's bell again. But then the ship's bell was still at Beacon Lodge,
  and Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram was back at Caradoc again. The whole thing had been
  rushed through so quickly that Cedric could not grip it as yet. The baleful
  shadow of the journalist no longer obscured the family glory, and Caradoc was
  almost itself again.</p>

  <p>But not quite, as Cedric acknowledged sadly. There had been no quarrel,
  nothing in the way of a vulgar dispute; the twins had simply refused to go
  back bound hard and fast to the clannish wheels of the conqueror, and
  Kathleen had backed them up. For the present they were all at Beacon Lodge,
  with the exception of Margaret who had gone where duty had taken her. As a
  matter of fact, Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram had missed the young people terribly, and
  indeed they had not opposed her without considerable searching of spirit. So
  the elderly lady had gone back to her own again with a new sense of dignity
  and a wider scope than she had ever enjoyed before. The discovery of that
  wonderful document had changed everything. The family lawyers wondered why it
  had never been unearthed before, wondered how dead and gone Wolframs had
  ignored it. If they had not done so, Caradoc would have changed hands long
  ago.</p>

  <p>But there it was, the prediction of that dingy parchment and a few words
  spoken by a frowsy judge in a stuffy set of chambers had changed everything.
  Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram was absolutely tete montee, as Reggie had prophesied she
  would be. She had not paid Major Wiltshire, for the simple reason that funds
  were not available as yet. She was absolute mistress of Caradoc, the fear of
  the Court of Chancery was before her no longer. She ought to have been
  happy.</p>

  <p>But the fact remained that she wasn't. She told herself that she missed
  the ship's bell and all the familiar objects that had been removed from
  Caradoc to Beacon Lodge. Not that she meant to have them back; she was too
  high-souled for that; she would not have consented had there been a bitter
  quarrel.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact there had been no quarrel at all, the opposing forces
  had parted quite amiably. Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram had asked Kathleen to retain
  everything for the present, till such time as she and the twins come to their
  senses and begged permission to return to Caradoc. With anybody but Kathleen
  she would have been furiously angry, but she had come to love the girl too
  much for that. And from the very first Kathleen had acknowledged no
  sovereignty and bowed to no discipline.</p>

  <p>In her heart of Hearts Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram was utterly miserable. She was
  actually late for dinner, which was a practical evidence of her state of
  mind. She was so late that the Right Honourable Charles Merrion, who had run
  over from Castleford for an hour or so wandered into the hall. Cedric stood
  contemplating the brass gong with an air of sadness chastened by
  resignation.</p>

  <p>"An innovation, Cedric," Mr. Merrion said. "What does it all mean?"</p>

  <p>Cedric shook his head scornfully. He was understood to say that the place
  was not what it had once been. The coming of Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram put an end
  to further disclosures. She looked drawn and pale, Merrion thought, and by no
  means so contented as she had been the last time he was at Beacon Lodge. She
  was stately as usual, but she did not say much till dinner was over and
  Merrion had produced his cigarettes.</p>

  <p>"What has become of Margaret?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Margaret went to Beacon Lodge to dinner," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram explained.
  "Charles, I really am deeply concerned about that girl. Latterly, she has
  been so much better, that I hoped to see her quite well soon. But since we
  returned she has gone back dreadfully."</p>

  <p>"What does the doctor say?" Merrion asked with some directness.</p>

  <p>"She will not see a doctor, at least, not Dr. Dennison. That in itself is
  strange."</p>

  <p>Merrion braced himself for an effort. He was going to speak plainly.</p>

  <p>"It is not strange at all," he said. "My dear Maria, I know no woman who
  can be more wilfully blind than yourself when it pleases you. Now, can you
  look me honestly and fairly in the face and declare you don't know what is
  the matter with Margaret?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram played with a peach quite nervously.</p>

  <p>"If you are alluding to some absurd love story," she said, "why, of
  course, I know."</p>

  <p>"Of course you do. I have seen it myself for some time. What I didn't
  know, Kathleen told me. It is a very pretty story, and a very pathetic one,
  at least it would be only it is distasteful to me to see an old friend acting
  in so cowardly a fashion."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram asked her ears a question. But they resolutely refused
  to help her out.</p>

  <p>"It's not a pretty word," Mr. Merrion went on, "but I can think of no
  other. The fact is you are a bully, Maria. For a long time you bullied the
  twins; you did so till Kathleen urged them to revolt. You never bullied
  Kathleen, because you knew she would not stand it, and in your heart you were
  afraid to do so. You have lost these young people; you miss them terribly.
  That is why, with a woman's lack of logic, your are taking it out of
  Margaret. Naturally the poor girl thought that you were giving way over the
  Dennison business. Now the dream is shattered, and the thing is telling on
  her health. Dennison is a gentleman, and will be a rich man. Maria, are you
  going to let your confounded pride break Margaret's heart?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram was angry, she was very angry indeed. And she was in
  none the less of a rage because she knew that every word of Merrion's was
  true. Still, it was hard to find all her friends turning away like this. She
  would walk over to Beacon Lodge and fetch Margaret presently. She tried to
  take comfort from the glory of her surroundings, she tried to wrap herself up
  in her dignity, but there must have been a hole in the garment somewhere.</p>

  <p>"I think you are very rude, Charles," she said.</p>

  <p>"I don't ever remember being so rude before," Mr. Merrion admitted coolly.
  "At the same time, I don't take back a single word of it&mdash;what's more,
  you know that I'm right. If I get hold of Margaret, I shall try and persuade
  her that she ought to take her happiness in her own hands. Give me an hour
  with Margaret and I shall play the snake in the grass with a vengeance. I
  give you fair warning."</p>

  <p>The right honourable gentleman was perfectly self-possessed and collected.
  The next moment he was talking about something else in his easy, charming
  manner. It was impossible to be angry with him for long, and, sooth to say,
  Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram would not have been very deeply outraged had he carried
  out his threat. But though she brought the subject up again and again, the
  wily old minister would have nothing of it. The conscience of his hostess was
  at work, and she should be left to work out her own salvation.</p>

  <p>"Well, I must be going," he said at length. "What a lovely, peaceful old
  house this is, how grateful it is to nerves like mine. No, you need not ring,
  Maria. I have plenty of time, and as it is so lovely a night, I shall walk to
  the station. One does not often see such a night in England."</p>

  <p>Merrion spoke truly. A full moon like a great silver shield on a dark
  wall, rode overhead; there was very little dew, the night was warm and balmy.
  The air was heavy with the subtle perfumes that come upon the wings of the
  darkness, Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram threw a wrap over her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I'll come as far as Beacon Lodge with you," she said. "Really, it is
  quite a sin to be indoors. I shall have the excuse of going to fetch
  Margaret."</p>

  <p>They walked along in silence for a little time, a little impressed by the
  silent beauty of the night. They came at length to the gate leading to Beacon
  Lodge. Behind the hedge and the fringe of trees came the gleam of shaded
  lights; a ripple of laughter floated from the house. Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram
  sighed wistfully. There was no laughter like that at Caradoc.</p>

  <p>"Well, good-night, Maria," said Merrion, holding out his hand.
  "By-the-way, come to think of it, I was very rude to you just now."</p>

  <p>"That," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said quietly, "was patent to the meanest
  understanding."</p>

  <p>"I suppose it was," Merrion observed thoughtfully. "Very rude, was I? I
  ought to apologise. But I shan't. When I peep between those trees, I'm glad I
  said what I did. Apologies come very easy to a Cabinet Minister, they are the
  grammar of his art. But you don't catch me apologising this time. Good-night,
  Maria."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram was actually smiling as she walked up the trim path.
  All the blinds were up; all the windows were wide open. Outside, on the
  verandah, the twins were seated, drinking lemonade from long glasses. They
  were chattering gaily about something; from a distance Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram's
  seemed to catch the sound of a man's voice. It was not Reggie's, and yet it
  sounded familiar.</p>

  <p>Altogether it was a charming picture of refined home life, home in the
  best sense of the word. There was nothing like this at Caradoc, though Mrs.
  Eldred-Wolfram could see no reason why not. Perhaps it was the wide send of
  freedom, the sense of liberty. The elderly lady stood there for a moment in
  the shadow. It was dreadfully suggestive of eavesdropping, but she could not
  help it.</p>

  <p>"I don't care what you say," Edna declared in her fresh, clear voice.
  "It's a shame; Margaret has herself to think about. If Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram
  lives to a good old age, which Heaven grant, then Margaret is destined to be
  an old maid; which is not what Providence meant a girl for."</p>

  <p>"Certainly not a pretty girl," Phillips said sententiously.</p>

  <p>"Well, they don't get all the luck, as witness ourselves," Edna replied.
  "I repeat it is a great shame. If I were in Margaret's place, I
  should&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram stepped out of the shadow. She really must not listen
  any longer.</p>

  <p>"It's a still night, and words carry far," Phillipa said, with a
  suggestion of mischief in her voice. "My dear godmother, how much did you
  hear?"</p>

  <p>"I discovered myself lest I should hear more," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram smiled.
  "Edna, were you going to say something bad about me?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I was," Edna retorted. "About you and Margaret. Godmother, you are
  a wicked woman, and you ought to be thoroughly ashamed of yourself. I've been
  trying to get Margaret to rebel."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram had nothing to say for the moment. Everybody seemed
  against her to-night, and it seemed strange to hear the Wolfram blood
  speaking like this; the shackles had been broken and the scabbard thrown away
  with a vengeance. Edna would never have dared to speak like that a month
  ago.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I must put up with it," the elder lady sighed. "It is my cross
  to bear; it all dates back to the coming of Kathleen. Where is she?"</p>

  <p>"Working on the last chapter of her new book," Phillipa said. "She is
  undecided about the ending. Novelists who are finishing stories are people
  distinctly to be avoided."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram sat in the balcony listening to the nonsense of the
  twins, and presently there came the notes of Margaret's organ. She had not
  had it removed back to Caradoc again; she said she had lost her taste for
  music. Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram had known perfectly well what the girl meant, but
  she had chosen to listen in silence.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to hear that," she said. "Margaret feels better. But who is
  singing to her accompaniment?"</p>

  <p>"Dr. Dennison," Edna said. "When I heard that Margaret was coming to
  dinner, I asked him to come. I put it so sweetly, that he could not refuse.
  What I want to do is to string him up to desperation, and make him elope with
  Margaret. I have taken a great deal of trouble to help those young
  people."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said nothing. She felt so helpless when the twins
  talked thus. It was a sign that their emancipation was absolutely complete.
  Presently there was a shadow in the window, and Kathleen appeared. She
  welcomed her visitor warmly. Edna and Phillipa slipped away; perhaps their
  victory was so new a thing that they did not feel quite at home with the
  vanquished yet.</p>

  <p>"You are working too hard," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram said. "Tell me about the
  story. They say you are at the last chapter. How is it going to end?"</p>

  <p>"Let us walk up and down the garden and discuss it," said Kathleen. "You
  shall take my arm and try and imagine that you are in our happy midst again.
  There, is not that like the good old times? I am exercised in my mind. An
  hour on my story will finish it. It is the end that troubles me."</p>

  <p>"Then why not end it happily?" Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram cried eagerly. She was
  back in the spirit of the thing again, and for the moment Caradoc and the
  family dignity were forgotten. "Kathleen, once I am here I am as deeply
  interested as ever. I came to fetch Margaret."</p>

  <p>"Did you come entirely to fetch Margaret?" Kathleen asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, no. I was quite miserable yonder without you. I sent for Mr.
  Merrion to come and dine with me, and give me his sympathy. Instead of that
  he bullied me dreadfully. Really he was shockingly rude."</p>

  <p>"And so that brought Margaret into your mind, by which I infer that the
  conversation was mainly about her. Which brings me back to my story. Now let
  me tell you a little secret. The heroine of my tale is Margaret in another
  form, the sinister influence in another form is yourself."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear, it took the shape of a money-loving father
  who&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who was absolutely indifferent to the feelings of his child. Make it a
  man or make it a woman, the pride and the selfishness are the same. Step by
  step I worked the story out, step by step I consulted you about it; I read it
  aloud for your delectation. And you threw yourself into the spirit of the
  thing, and I was glad, because I was certain then that the human note was
  touched. You were angry with my heroine's father for thinking that he was
  ruining the girl's life. You said that she was right in the step she took. I
  enjoyed your interest, which lasted to the finding of that grant of James II.
  After that things were different. You seemed to have lost all sympathy with
  my children."</p>

  <p>"I was so very busy," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram protested.</p>

  <p>"Well, I will let that pass. I wrote the story that I saw blooming under
  my own eyes. And the end is not for me to write, but for you to finish. Look
  there."</p>

  <p>Margaret and Dennison had come out into the verandah. The pale moonlight
  was on the girl's face, but it was a smiling and happy face now that she
  turned to her companion. The usually downcast eyes were smiling, there was a
  tinge of colour on the cheeks. Her hand rested gently on Dennison's arm for
  the moment. Her glance sought his. It was a pretty, touching picture, a
  picture that told its own tale. Dennison was saying something courtly, and
  Margaret turned away; her face changing.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of that?" Kathleen asked. "Here stands my hero and
  heroine between love and duty. In the spirit you were all with me, in the
  flesh you seem to be all against me. Shall I recall some of the many things
  you have said?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram put up her hands in feeble protest. She was trembling
  now, and that picture in the verandah dissolved in something very like
  tears.</p>

  <p>"No, no," she cried. "I begin to recognise, I begin to understand.
  Kathleen, I am a wicked old woman."</p>

  <p>"No, no, only a mistaken one. Grandmother, how shall I end the story?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, happily, happily. There is no other way. Let the wrong be righted and
  the eyes of the blind to see the truth. As you end the story so shall the
  story that was before me just now end. And&mdash;and I want you all to come
  and dine with me at Caradoc to-morrow night. I&mdash;I can't wait for
  Margaret. I should like to go back home alone, you understand. And Dr.
  Dennison shall bring Margaret back."</p>

  <p>The speaker held out her hand, but Kathleen kissed her instead. Then she
  went to the gate and stood watching the tall black figure till it had
  vanished in the mist. Down the path Edna came skipping, her gay voice carried
  far in the still air.</p>

  <p>"Have you got it?" she asked. "Is the ending a happy one after all?"</p>

  <p>"The end is perfect," Kathleen said in tones that shook a little. "My
  story is finished. And where my story ends the life happiness of one I love
  begins."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19"></a>XIX. &mdash; ABSOLUTION</h2>

  <p class="first">The Right Honourable Charles Merrion started, thereby
losing the correct
  angle of the dress tie he was just drawing up. Really it had been an
  unfortunate day altogether. He had come down to Caradoc, at considerable
  personal inconvenience, at an urgent summons from Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram, and
  these messages generally meant trouble. It was the clang of the ship's
  bell&mdash;premonition of approaching dinner&mdash;that had so startled
  Merrion. Why was that bell back at Caradoc again? Only last night it had been
  at Beacon Lodge. Could there have been a quarrel or bother?</p>

  <p>"But, no, I'll not believe it," the Minister said, as he settled his tie
  at last. "Maria is terribly wrong-headed, but she never did anything in bad
  taste. What's in the wind, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram was alone in the drawing-room when Merrion got down.
  She was a little more magnificently dressed than usual, her point lace was
  superb. A thin string of brilliants was around her throat. Evidently
  something very much out of the common was going to take place. Mrs.
  Eldred-Wolfram's usually calm manner had deserted her, she was palpably
  nervous, there was some colour in her cheeks, and she glanced at the clock
  like a debutante going to her first party. Yet, on the whole, Charles Merrion
  had never admired Maria Eldred-Wolfram quite so much as he did at that
  moment.</p>

  <p>"I am exceedingly sorry to trouble you so soon, Charles," she said. "My
  only excuse is the certainty of your satisfaction before the evening is over.
  Something&mdash;something has happened, Charles."</p>

  <p>Merrion no longer doubted it, for he could see around him many of the
  treasures so recently transported to Beacon Lodge. Still, the momentous news
  must be good. No woman ever looked as Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram did at this moment
  who was not going to perform a brave and generous action. There was almost
  girlish brilliancy in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"You must not be surprised at anything you see," she said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I won't," Merrion promised. "This is where my political training
  comes in. Eh, what?"</p>

  <p>Cedric opened the door solemnly, and announced the twins as if they had
  been perfect strangers. Cedric too, had caught the excitement, for his cheeks
  were red. Merrion bowed before the two visions of beauty with a grave air of
  restrained admiration. The girls really were looking exceedingly nice. There
  was not the faintest suggestion of there being an evangelical bishop in the
  family now.</p>

  <p>All the same, Merrion was surprised as Margaret came announced in the same
  way, followed quickly by Dr. Dennison and Reggie. Nobody but the twins seemed
  at their ease, with the exception of Kathleen, who had headed off Cedric and
  came like a flash of sunlight into the room and kissed her hostess heartily.
  There was no forcing even the fringe of the family dignity on Kathleen.</p>

  <p>"I was horribly afraid that I was going to be late," she said, "but I was
  bound to stay and finish my story. It is ended at last, thank goodness."</p>

  <p>"And the end?" Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram asked, with the shade of suggestion in
  her voice.</p>

  <p>"Oh, the end is lovely," Kathleen laughed. "I decided to place my faith in
  human nature, and the conclusion worked out splendidly. I hope I am not
  mistaken."</p>

  <p>"I'm perfectly certain you are not," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram murmured.</p>

  <p>There was some understanding between these two, there was a subtle meaning
  somewhere, Merrion decided. What were they driving at? Well, he had promised
  to be surprised at nothing that happened to-night. But he had reckoned
  without his hostess's sense of dramatic feeling. The door was thrown back,
  and Cedric entered in his most solemn and episcopal manner.</p>

  <p>"Major and Mrs. Wiltshire," he said evenly; it was a splendid effort of
  discipline. "Major and Mrs. Wiltshire. And I have to say that dinner is
  served, madam."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram rose with a real smile of welcome on her face. She
  kissed her sister quite affectionately, and her handshake with the major was
  genuine.</p>

  <p>"I am very glad to see you both," she said, "and it was really good of you
  to come at so short a notice, especially as I have never been to call on
  Lucy. John, I was very rude the last time we met, and I most sincerely ask
  your pardon. Your kindness has touched me deeply."</p>

  <p>"Fine weather for the crops," Merrion said mechanically. As a rule, he
  hated to be banal, but for the life of him he could not think of anything
  else to say. Kathleen was obviously laughing at him. He coolly put his arm
  under hers and followed the Major and Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram to the dining-room.
  "Young woman, you are in the conspiracy," he went on. "Did you hear our
  gracious lady call him John?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and I'm glad of it," Kathleen said.</p>

  <p>"He is what you call a good fellow and a gentleman, Mr. Merrion. This is a
  great evening, an epoch-making night in the history of the house."</p>

  <p>"So it seems," Merrion said drily. "And methinks there is more to
  follow."</p>

  <p>The meal was a little constrained at first, but the feeling gradually wore
  off. Merrion took brilliant advantage of the field opened to his diplomacy.
  They were a merry party enough by the time dessert came, and when Major
  Wiltshire calmly addressed Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram as Maria, Merrion lay back
  with the air of one who has done his duty successfully and well.</p>

  <p>Then came one of the sudden silences that assail even the most carefully
  chosen dinner party. Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram signed to Cedric to fill the
  glasses. He made a terrible hash of it. His hand trembled, so that he spilt
  little pools of different hued liquid all along the shining board. Mrs.
  Eldred-Wolfram watched the enormity with a pleased, tolerant smile.</p>

  <p>"I am going to say a few words," she said. "Many strange things have
  happened lately, and not the least startling event is the discovery that
  places me finally here again. But in the interval, I learnt a great lesson.
  In future there is going to be no more selfish waste at Caradoc. Just debts
  will be paid and expected in return. Sitting here, I solemnly pledge my word
  that not another heirloom at Caradoc is parted from the property. It may be
  that the entail was broken in the the time of James II., but all the same I
  regard my present position as a solemn trust. I hold the estate in trust for
  my rightful heir and successor, Reginald Eldred. I ask you all to drink the
  health of the future owner of Caradoc."</p>

  <p>Heads were solemnly bowed over glasses, and various wines sipped. Reggie
  murmured something to the effect that he was not worthy, but nobody took the
  faintest notice of him. There was more to come.</p>

  <p>"That is one reason why I asked you here to-night," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram
  went on. "Another reason was to see the reconciliation between my sister and
  myself, my sister and her husband. Lucy, you are a fortunate woman, and I
  have been a very foolish one. I need not say any more than that. This is
  another cause for the dinner. You are here to-night in honour of the
  engagement of my dear Margaret to Dr. Dennison. Let us drink life and
  happiness to the prospective bride and bridegroom."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you darling," Kathleen cried eagerly. "You perfect darling. Margaret,
  my dear, love to you."</p>

  <p>Kathleen's hands shook and her eyes filled with tears. Margaret's pale
  face flushed deeply, but she said nothing. John Dennison's fingers closed on
  hers, and his heart seemed to be uplifted. It was a beautiful and dramatic
  surprise. Dr. Dennison stammered out a few heartfelt words.</p>

  <p>"I see you are all pleased," Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram proceeded. "I had only
  decided on that lately. When my good fortune came back to me, I was on the
  verge of a great folly. I almost quarrelled with my young people; I decided
  to do without them. I couldn't do it; I was perfectly miserable here. So I
  asked them to come back on their own term's, and they came. They brought all
  the treasures back from Beacon Lodge, as you can see. But Beacon Lodge is not
  going to be deserted. Reggie very kindly placed it at my disposal, and I'm
  gong to ask a further favour at his hands. I am going to ask him to let me
  retain Beacon Lodge as the future home of Dr. and Mrs. Dennison, I could not
  let Margaret go very far away. What does Reggie say?"</p>

  <p>Reggie said exactly what was expected of him, and said it very well.
  Apparently, the pleasant surprises of the night were over, but Kathleen had
  one more. It was only to be expected that so brilliant a novelist would cap
  the efforts of an amateur like Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to be a brand of strife," she said sweetly. "But what is to
  become of Reggie and myself? All I ask is where are we going to live when we
  are married?"</p>

  <p>"You don't mean to say&mdash;&mdash;" Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram gasped. "My dear
  child, this is the most delightful surprise of all. At one time I had
  intended Margaret for Reggie. For a long time I have seen that it is
  impossible. Then I thought, perhaps, that Edna or Phillipa&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Impossible," Edna said. "Think of the episcopal rampart
  that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Everybody laughed, Mrs. Eldred-Wolfram included. Then she grew grave
  again.</p>

  <p>"I can settle that for you," she said. "If that charter had never been
  found, under ordinary circumstances Reggie would have come into possession of
  Caradoc two years hence. Then, I should have retired to the dower house. It
  is my mood to forget that the charter has ever existed, it is my whim to
  behave as the dames of Caradoc have behaved for generations. When Reggie
  marries he comes here. I shall be happier there. I am not a novelist like
  Kathleen, but I have my visions. It is the happy old age that comes to the
  good and generous. You may smile at me."</p>

  <p>But nobody was smiling, everybody was very silent. Then Kathleen kissed
  the speaker with lips that trembled. One by one the girls did the same.
  Margaret, at a sign from Dennison, rose and slipped away from the room. At
  the grand organ in the hall she sat down and flooded the house with melody.
  The grand, sad chords rolled out, the glad music rose higher.</p>

  <p>"Mendelssohn's 'Wedding March,'" Merrion said. "Never heard it played so
  in my life, eh, Maria?"</p>
