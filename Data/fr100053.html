<p class="first"><i>"MAGNIFIQUE!"</i> ejaculated the Countess de
Coude, beneath her breath.</p>

<p>"Eh?" questioned the count, turning toward his young wife.
"What is it that is magnificent?" and the count bent his eyes in
various directions in quest of the object of her admiration.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing at all, my dear," replied the countess, a slight
flush momentarily coloring her already pink cheek. "I was but
recalling with admiration those stupendous skyscrapers, as they
call them, of New York," and the fair countess settled herself
more comfortably in her steamer chair, and resumed the magazine
which "nothing at all" had caused her to let fall upon her
lap.</p>

<p>Her husband again buried himself in his book, but not without
a mild wonderment that three days out from New York his countess
should suddenly have realized an admiration for the very
buildings she had but recently characterized as horrid.</p>

<p>Presently the count put down his book. "It is very tiresome,
Olga," he said. "I think that I shall hunt up some others who may
be equally bored, and see if we cannot find enough for a game of
cards."</p>

<p>"You are not very gallant, my husband," replied the young
woman, smiling, "but as I am equally bored I can forgive you. Go
and play at your tiresome old cards, then, if you will." When he
had gone she let her eyes wander slyly to the figure of a tall
young man stretched lazily in a chair not far distant.</p>

<p><i>"Magnifique!"</i> she breathed once more.</p>

<p>The Countess Olga de Coude was twenty. Her husband forty. She
was a very faithful and loyal wife, but as she had had nothing
whatever to do with the selection of a husband, it is not at all
unlikely that she was not wildly and passionately in love with
the one that fate and her titled Russian father had selected for
her. However, simply because she was surprised into a tiny
exclamation of approval at sight of a splendid young stranger it
must not be inferred therefrom that her thoughts were in any way
disloyal to her spouse.</p>

<p>She merely admired, as she might have admired a particularly
fine specimen of any species. Furthermore, the young man was
unquestionably good to look at.</p>

<p>As her furtive glance rested upon his profile he rose to leave
the deck. The Countess de Coude beckoned to a passing steward.
"Who is that gentleman?" she asked.</p>

<p>"He is booked, madam, as Monsieur Tarzan, of Africa," replied
the steward.</p>

<p>"Rather a large estate," thought the girl, but now her
interest was still further aroused.</p>

<p>As Tarzan walked slowly toward the smoking-room he came
unexpectedly upon two men whispering excitedly just without. He
would have vouchsafed them not even a passing thought but for the
strangely guilty glance that one of them shot in his direction.
They reminded Tarzan of melodramatic villains he had seen at the
theaters in Paris.</p>

<p>Both were very dark, and this, in connection with the shrugs
and stealthy glances that accompanied their palpable intriguing,
lent still greater force to the similarity.</p>

<p>Tarzan entered the smoking-room, and sought a chair a little
apart from the others who were there. He felt in no mood for
conversation, and as he sipped his absinth he let his mind run
rather sorrowfully over the past few weeks of his life. Time and
again he had wondered if he had acted wisely in renouncing his
birthright to a man to whom he owed nothing. It is true that he
liked Clayton, but&mdash;ah, but that was not the question. It
was not for William Cecil Clayton, Lord Greystoke, that he had
denied his birth. It was for the woman whom both he and Clayton
had loved, and whom a strange freak of fate had given to Clayton
instead of to him.</p>

<p>That she loved him made the thing doubly difficult to bear,
yet he knew that he could have done nothing less than he did do
that night within the little railway station in the far Wisconsin
woods.</p>

<p>To him her happiness was the first consideration of all, and
his brief experience with civilization and civilized men had
taught him that without money and position life to most of them
was unendurable.</p>

<p>Jane Porter had been born to both, and had Tarzan taken them
away from her future husband it would doubtless have plunged her
into a life of misery and torture. That she would have spurned
Clayton once he had been stripped of both his title and his
estates never for once occurred to Tarzan, for he credited to
others the same honest loyalty that was so inherent a quality in
himself. Nor, in this instance, had he erred. Could any one thing
have further bound Jane Porter to her promise to Clayton it would
have been in the nature of some such misfortune as this
overtaking him.</p>

<p>Tarzan's thoughts drifted from the past to the future. He
tried to look forward with pleasurable sensations to his return
to the jungle of his birth and boyhood; the cruel, fierce jungle
in which he had spent twenty of his twenty-two years. But who or
what of all the myriad jungle life would there be to welcome his
return? Not one. Only Tantor, the elephant, could he call friend.
The others would hunt him or flee from him as had been their way
in the past.</p>

<p>Not even the apes of his own tribe would extend the hand of
fellowship to him.</p>

<p>If civilization had done nothing else for Tarzan of the Apes,
it had to some extent taught him to crave the society of his own
kind, and to feel with genuine pleasure the congenial warmth of
companionship. And in the same ratio had it made any other life
distasteful to him. It was difficult to imagine a world without a
friend&mdash;without a living thing who spoke the new tongues
which Tarzan had learned to love so well. And so it was that
Tarzan looked with little relish upon the future he had mapped
out for himself.</p>

<p>As he sat musing over his cigarette his eyes fell upon a
mirror before him, and in it he saw reflected a table at which
four men sat at cards. Presently one of them rose to leave, and
then another approached, and Tarzan could see that he courteously
offered to fill the vacant chair, that the game might not be
interrupted. He was the smaller of the two whom Tarzan had seen
whispering just outside the smoking-room.</p>

<p>It was this fact that aroused a faint spark of interest in
Tarzan, and so as he speculated upon the future he watched in the
mirror the reflection of the players at the table behind him.
Aside from the man who had but just entered the game Tarzan knew
the name of but one of the other players. It was he who sat
opposite the new player, Count Raoul de Coude, whom an over-
attentive steward had pointed out as one of the celebrities of
the passage, describing him as a man high in the official family
of the French minister of war.</p>

<p>Suddenly Tarzan's attention was riveted upon the picture in
the glass. The other swarthy plotter had entered, and was
standing behind the count's chair. Tarzan saw him turn and glance
furtively about the room, but his eyes did not rest for a
sufficient time upon the mirror to note the reflection of
Tarzan's watchful eyes.</p>

<p>Stealthily the man withdrew something from his pocket. Tarzan
could not discern what the object was, for the man's hand covered
it.</p>

<p>Slowly the hand approached the count, and then, very deftly,
the thing that was in it was transferred to the count's pocket.
The man remained standing where he could watch the Frenchman's
cards.</p>

<p>Tarzan was puzzled, but he was all attention now, nor did he
permit another detail of the incident to escape him.</p>

<p>The play went on for some ten minutes after this, until the
count won a considerable wager from him who had last joined the
game, and then Tarzan saw the fellow back of the count's chair
nod his head to his confederate. Instantly the player arose and
pointed a finger at the count.</p>

<p>"Had I known that monsieur was a professional card sharp I had
not been so ready to be drawn into the game," he said.</p>

<p>Instantly the count and the two other players were upon their
feet.</p>

<p>De Coude's face went white.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, sir?" he cried. "Do you know to whom you
speak?"</p>

<p>"I know that I speak, for the last time, to one who cheats at
cards," replied the fellow.</p>

<p>The count leaned across the table, and struck the man full in
the mouth with his open palm, and then the others closed in
between them.</p>

<p>"There is some mistake, sir," cried one of the other players.
"Why, this is Count de Coude, of France."</p>

<p>"If I am mistaken," said the accuser, "I shall gladly
apologize; but before I do so first let monsieur le count explain
the extra cards which I saw him drop into his side pocket." And
then the man whom Tarzan had seen drop them there turned to sneak
from the room, but to his annoyance he found the exit barred by a
tall, gray-eyed stranger.</p>

<p>"Pardon," said the man brusquely, attempting to pass to one
side.</p>

<p>"Wait," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"But why, monsieur?" exclaimed the other petulantly. "Permit
me to pass, monsieur."</p>

<p>"Wait," said Tarzan. "I think that there is a matter in here
that you may doubtless be able to explain." The fellow had lost
his temper by this time, and with a low oath seized Tarzan to
push him to one side. The ape-man but smiled as he twisted the
big fellow about and, grasping him by the collar of his coat,
escorted him back to the table, struggling, cursing, and striking
in futile remonstrance. It was Nikolas Rokoff's first experience
with the muscles that had brought their savage owner victorious
through encounters with Numa, the lion, and Terkoz, the great
bull ape.</p>

<p>The man who had accused De Coude, and the two others who had
been playing, stood looking expectantly at the count. Several
other passengers had drawn toward the scene of the altercation,
and all awaited the denouement.</p>

<p>"The fellow is crazy," said the count. "Gentlemen, I implore
that one of you search me."</p>

<p>"The accusation is ridiculous." This from one of the
players.</p>

<p>"You have but to slip your hand in the count's coat pocket and
you will see that the accusation is quite serious," insisted the
accuser. And then, as the others still hesitated to do so: "Come,
I shall do it myself if no other will," and he stepped forward
toward the count.</p>

<p>"No, monsieur," said De Coude. "I will submit to a search only
at the hands of a gentleman."</p>

<p>"It is unnecessary to search the count. The cards are in his
pocket. I myself saw them placed there." All turned in surprise
toward this new speaker, to behold a very well-built young man
urging a resisting captive toward them by the scruff of his
neck.</p>

<p>"It is a conspiracy," cried De Coude angrily. "There are no
cards in my coat," and with that he ran his hand into his pocket.
As he did so tense silence reigned in the little group. The count
went dead white, and then very slowly he withdrew his hand, and
in it were three cards.</p>

<p>He looked at them in mute and horrified surprise, and slowly
the red of mortification suffused his face. Expressions of pity
and contempt tinged the features of those who looked on at the
death of a man's honor.</p>

<p>"It is a conspiracy, monsieur." It was the gray-eyed stranger
who spoke. "Gentlemen," he continued, "monsieur le count did not
know that those cards were in his pocket. They were placed there
without his knowledge as he sat at play. From where I sat in that
chair yonder I saw the reflection of it all in the mirror before
me. This person whom I just intercepted in an effort to escape
placed the cards in the count's pocket." De Coude had glanced
from Tarzan to the man in his grasp.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>, Nikolas!" he cried. "You?" Then he turned to
his accuser, and eyed him intently for a moment.</p>

<p>"And you, monsieur, I did not recognize you without your
beard. It quite disguises you, Paulvitch. I see it all now. It is
quite clear, gentlemen."</p>

<p>"What shall we do with them, monsieur?" asked Tarzan. "Turn
them over to the captain?"</p>

<p>"No, my friend," said the count hastily. "It is a personal
matter, and I beg that you will let it drop. It is sufficient
that I have been exonerated from the charge. The less we have to
do with such fellows, the better. But, monsieur, how can I thank
you for the great kindness you have done me? Permit me to offer
you my card, and should the time come when I may serve you,
remember that I am yours to command."</p>

<p>Tarzan had released Rokoff, who, with his confederate,
Paulvitch, had hastened from the smoking-room.</p>

<p>Just as he was leaving, Rokoff turned to Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Monsieur will have ample opportunity to regret his
interference in the affairs of others."</p>

<p>Tarzan smiled, and then, bowing to the count, handed him his
own card.</p>

<p>The count read:<br></p>

<p class="sign">M. Jean C. Tarzan</p><br>

<p>"Monsieur Tarzan," he said, "may indeed wish that he had never
befriended me, for I can assure him that he has won the enmity of
two of the most unmitigated scoundrels in all Europe. Avoid them,
monsieur, by all means."</p>

<p>"I have had more awe-inspiring enemies, my dear count,"
replied Tarzan with a quiet smile, "yet I am still alive and
unworried. I think that neither of these two will ever find the
means to harm me."</p>

<p>"Let us hope not, monsieur," said De Coude, "but yet it will
do no harm to be on the alert, and to know that you have made at
least one enemy today who never forgets and never forgives, and
in whose malignant brain there are always hatching new atrocities
to perpetrate upon those who have thwarted or offended him. To
say that Nikolas Rokoff is a devil would be to place a wanton
affront upon his satanic majesty."</p>

<p>That night as Tarzan entered his cabin he found a folded note
upon the floor that had evidently been pushed beneath the door.
He opened it and read:</p><br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">M. Tarzan</span>:</p>

<p class="letter">Doubtless you did not realize the gravity of
your offense, or you would not have done the thing you did today.
I am willing to believe that you acted in ignorance and without
any intention to offend a stranger. For this reason I shall
gladly permit you to offer an apology, and on receiving your
assurances that you will not again interfere in affairs that do
not concern you, I shall drop the matter.</p>

<p class="letter">Otherwise&mdash;but I am sure that you will see
the wisdom of adopting the course I suggest.</p>

<p class="letter">Very respectfully, <span class="smcap">Nikolas
Rokoff</span>.</p><br>

<p>Tarzan permitted a grim smile to play about his lips for a
moment, then he promptly dropped the matter from his mind, and
went to bed.</p>

<p>In a nearby cabin the Countess de Coude was speaking to her
husband.</p>

<p>"Why so grave, my dear Raoul?" she asked. "You have been as
glum as could be all evening. What worries you?"</p>

<p>"Olga, Nikolas is on board. Did you know it?"</p>

<p>"Nikolas!" she exclaimed. "But it is impossible, Raoul. It
cannot be. Nikolas is under arrest in Germany."</p>

<p>"So I thought myself until I saw him today&mdash;him and that
other arch scoundrel, Paulvitch. Olga, I cannot endure his
persecution much longer. No, not even for you. Sooner or later I
shall turn him over to the authorities. In fact, I am half minded
to explain all to the captain before we land. On a French liner
it were an easy matter, Olga, permanently to settle this Nemesis
of ours."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Raoul!" cried the countess, sinking to her knees
before him as he sat with bowed head upon a divan. "Do not do
that. Remember your promise to me. Tell me, Raoul, that you will
not do that. Do not even threaten him, Raoul."</p>

<p>De Coude took his wife's hands in his, and gazed upon her pale
and troubled countenance for some time before he spoke, as though
he would wrest from those beautiful eyes the real reason which
prompted her to shield this man.</p>

<p>"Let it be as you wish, Olga," he said at length. "I cannot
understand. He has forfeited all claim upon your love, loyalty,
or respect. He is a menace to your life and honor, and the life
and honor of your husband. I trust you may never regret
championing him."</p>

<p>"I do not champion him, Raoul," she interrupted vehemently. "I
believe that I hate him as much as you do, but&mdash;Oh, Raoul,
blood is thicker than water."</p>

<p>"I should today have liked to sample the consistency of his,"
growled De Coude grimly. "The two deliberately attempted to
besmirch my honor, Olga," and then he told her of all that had
happened in the smoking-room. "Had it not been for this utter
stranger, they had succeeded, for who would have accepted my
unsupported word against the damning evidence of those cards
hidden on my person? I had almost begun to doubt myself when this
Monsieur Tarzan dragged your precious Nikolas before us, and
explained the whole cowardly transaction."</p>

<p>"Monsieur Tarzan?" asked the countess, in evident
surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes. Do you know him, Olga?"</p>

<p>"I have seen him. A steward pointed him out to me."</p>

<p>"I did not know that he was a celebrity," said the count.</p>

<p>Olga de Coude changed the subject. She discovered suddenly
that she might find it difficult to explain just why the steward
had pointed out the handsome Monsieur Tarzan to her. Perhaps she
flushed the least little bit, for was not the count, her husband,
gazing at her with a strangely quizzical expression. "Ah," she
thought, "a guilty conscience is a most suspicious thing."</p>
<hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap2" id="chap2">II. &mdash; FORGING BONDS OF HATE
AND&mdash;?</a></h2>

<div align="center"> <img src="fr100053-images/TheReturnOfTarzan-02.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration"> </div><br>

<p class="first">It was not until late the following afternoon
that Tarzan saw anything more of the fellow passengers into the
midst of whose affairs his love of fair play had thrust him. And
then he came most unexpectedly upon Rokoff and Paulvitch at a
moment when of all others the two might least appreciate his
company.</p>

<p>They were standing on deck at a point which was temporarily
deserted, and as Tarzan came upon them they were in heated
argument with a woman. Tarzan noted that she was richly
appareled, and that her slender, well-modeled figure denoted
youth; but as she was heavily veiled he could not discern her
features.</p>

<p>The men were standing on either side of her, and the backs of
all were toward Tarzan, so that he was quite close to them
without their being aware of his presence. He noticed that Rokoff
seemed to be threatening, the woman pleading; but they spoke in a
strange tongue, and he could only guess from appearances that the
girl was afraid.</p>

<p>Rokoff's attitude was so distinctly filled with the threat of
physical violence that the ape-man paused for an instant just
behind the trio, instinctively sensing an atmosphere of danger.
Scarcely had he hesitated ere the man seized the woman roughly by
the wrist, twisting it as though to wring a promise from her
through torture.</p>

<p>What would have happened next had Rokoff had his way we may
only conjecture, since he did not have his way at all. Instead,
steel fingers gripped his shoulder, and he was swung
unceremoniously around, to meet the cold gray eyes of the
stranger who had thwarted him on the previous day.</p>

<p><i>"Sapristi!"</i> screamed the infuriated Rokoff. "What do you mean?
Are you a fool that you thus again insult Nikolas Rokoff?"</p>

<p>"This is my answer to your note, monsieur," said Tarzan, in a
low voice. And then he hurled the fellow from him with such force
that Rokoff lunged sprawling against the rail.</p>

<p>"Name of a name!" shrieked Rokoff. "Pig, but you shall die for
this," and, springing to his feet, he rushed upon Tarzan, tugging
the meanwhile to draw a revolver from his hip pocket. The girl
shrank back in terror.</p>

<p>"Nikolas!" she cried. "Do not&mdash;oh, do not do that. Quick,
monsieur, fly, or he will surely kill you!" But instead of flying
Tarzan advanced to meet the fellow. "Do not make a fool of
yourself, monsieur," he said.</p>

<p>Rokoff, who was in a perfect frenzy of rage at the humiliation
the stranger had put upon him, had at last succeeded in drawing
the revolver. He had stopped, and now he deliberately raised it
to Tarzan's breast and pulled the trigger. The hammer fell with a
futile click on an empty chamber&mdash;the ape-man's hand shot
out like the head of an angry python; there was a quick wrench,
and the revolver sailed far out across the ship's rail, and
dropped into the Atlantic.</p>

<p>For a moment the two men stood there facing one another.
Rokoff had regained his self-possession. He was the first to
speak.</p>

<p>"Twice now has monsieur seen fit to interfere in matters which
do not concern him. Twice he has taken it upon himself to
humiliate Nikolas Rokoff. The first offense was overlooked on the
assumption that monsieur acted through ignorance, but this affair
shall not be overlooked. If monsieur does not know who Nikolas
Rokoff is, this last piece of effrontery will insure that
monsieur later has good reason to remember him."</p>

<p>"That you are a coward and a scoundrel, monsieur," replied
Tarzan, "is all that I care to know of you," and he turned to ask
the girl if the man had hurt her, but she had disappeared. Then,
without even a glance toward Rokoff and his companion, he
continued his stroll along the deck.</p>

<p>Tarzan could not but wonder what manner of conspiracy was on
foot, or what the scheme of the two men might be. There had been
something rather familiar about the appearance of the veiled
woman to whose rescue he had just come, but as he had not seen
her face he could not be sure that he had ever seen her before.
The only thing about her that he had particularly noticed was a
ring of peculiar workmanship upon a finger of the hand that
Rokoff had seized, and he determined to note the fingers of the
women passengers he came upon thereafter, that he might discover
the identity of her whom Rokoff was persecuting, and learn if the
fellow had offered her further annoyance.</p>

<p>Tarzan had sought his deck chair, where he sat speculating on
the numerous instances of human cruelty, selfishness, and spite
that had fallen to his lot to witness since that day in the
jungle four years since that his eyes had first fallen upon a
human being other than himself&mdash;the sleek, black Kulonga,
whose swift arrow had that day found the vitals of Kala, the
great she-ape, and robbed the youth, Tarzan, of the only mother
he had ever known.</p>

<p>He recalled the murder of King by the rat-faced Snipes; the
abandonment of Professor Porter and his party by the mutineers of
the <i>Arrow</i>; the cruelty of the black warriors and women of
Mbonga to their captives; the petty jealousies of the civil and
military officers of the West Coast colony that had afforded him
his first introduction to the civilized world.</p>

<p><i>"Mon Dieu!"</i> he soliloquized, "but they are all alike.
Cheating, murdering, lying, fighting, and all for things that the
beasts of the jungle would not deign to possess&mdash;money to
purchase the effeminate pleasures of weaklings. And yet withal
bound down by silly customs that make them slaves to their
unhappy lot while firm in the belief that they be the lords of
creation enjoying the only real pleasures of existence. In the
jungle one would scarcely stand supinely aside while another took
his mate. It is a silly world, an idiotic world, and Tarzan of
the Apes was a fool to renounce the freedom and the happiness of
his jungle to come into it." Presently, as he sat there, the
sudden feeling came over him that eyes were watching from behind,
and the old instinct of the wild beast broke through the thin
veneer of civilization, so that Tarzan wheeled about so quickly
that the eyes of the young woman who had been surreptitiously
regarding him had not even time to drop before the gray eyes of
the ape-man shot an inquiring look straight into them. Then, as
they fell, Tarzan saw a faint wave of crimson creep swiftly over
the now half-averted face.</p>

<p>He smiled to himself at the result of his very uncivilized and
ungallant action, for he had not lowered his own eyes when they
met those of the young woman. She was very young, and equally
good to look upon. Further, there was something rather familiar
about her that set Tarzan to wondering where he had seen her
before. He resumed his former position, and presently he was
aware that she had arisen and was leaving the deck. As she
passed, Tarzan turned to watch her, in the hope that he might
discover a clew to satisfy his mild curiosity as to her
identity.</p>

<p>Nor was he disappointed entirely, for as she walked away she
raised one hand to the black, waving mass at the nape of her
neck&mdash;the peculiarly feminine gesture that admits cognizance
of appraising eyes behind her&mdash;and Tarzan saw upon a finger
of this hand the ring of strange workmanship that he had seen
upon the finger of the veiled woman a short time before.</p>

<p>So it was this beautiful young woman Rokoff had been
persecuting.</p>

<p>Tarzan wondered in a lazy sort of way whom she might be, and
what relations one so lovely could have with the surly, bearded
Russian.</p>

<p>After dinner that evening Tarzan strolled forward, where he
remained until after dark, in conversation with the second
officer, and when that gentleman's duties called him elsewhere
Tarzan lolled lazily by the rail watching the play of the
moonlight upon the gently rolling waters. He was half hidden by a
davit, so that two men who approached along the deck did not see
him, and as they passed Tarzan caught enough of their
conversation to cause him to fall in behind them, to follow and
learn what deviltry they were up to.</p>

<p>He had recognized the voice as that of Rokoff, and had seen
that his companion was Paulvitch.</p>

<p>Tarzan had overheard but a few words: "And if she screams you
may choke her until&mdash;" But those had been enough to arouse
the spirit of adventure within him, and so he kept the two men in
sight as they walked, briskly now, along the deck. To the
smoking-room he followed them, but they merely halted at the
doorway long enough, apparently, to assure themselves that one
whose whereabouts they wished to establish was within.</p>

<p>Then they proceeded directly to the first-class cabins upon
the promenade deck. Here Tarzan found greater difficulty in
escaping detection, but he managed to do so successfully. As they
halted before one of the polished hardwood doors, Tarzan slipped
into the shadow of a passageway not a dozen feet from them.</p>

<p>To their knock a woman's voice asked in French: "Who is
it?"</p>

<p>"It is I, Olga&mdash;Nikolas," was the answer, in Rokoff's now
familiar guttural. "May I come in?"</p>

<p>"Why do you not cease persecuting me, Nikolas?" came the voice
of the woman from beyond the thin panel. "I have never harmed
you."</p>

<p>"Come, come, Olga," urged the man, in propitiary tones; "I but
ask a half dozen words with you. I shall not harm you, nor shall
I enter your cabin; but I cannot shout my message through the
door." Tarzan heard the catch click as it was released from the
inside. He stepped out from his hiding-place far enough to see
what transpired when the door was opened, for he could not but
recall the sinister words he had heard a few moments before upon
the deck, "And if she screams you may choke her." Rokoff was
standing directly in front of the door. Paulvitch had flattened
himself against the paneled wall of the corridor beyond.</p>

<p>The door opened. Rokoff half entered the room, and stood with
his back against the door, speaking in a low whisper to the
woman, whom Tarzan could not see. Then Tarzan heard the woman's
voice, level, but loud enough to distinguish her words.</p>

<p>"No, Nikolas," she was saying, "it is useless. Threaten as you
will, I shall never accede to your demands. Leave the room,
please; you have no right here. You promised not to enter."</p>

<p>"Very well, Olga, I shall not enter; but before I am done with
you, you shall wish a thousand times that you had done at once
the favor I have asked. In the end I shall win anyway, so you
might as well save trouble and time for me, and disgrace for
yourself and your&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never, Nikolas!" interrupted the woman, and then Tarzan saw
Rokoff turn and nod to Paulvitch, who sprang quickly toward the
doorway of the cabin, rushing in past Rokoff, who held the door
open for him. Then the latter stepped quickly out. The door
closed. Tarzan heard the click of the lock as Paulvitch turned it
from the inside.</p>

<p>Rokoff remained standing before the door, with head bent, as
though to catch the words of the two within. A nasty smile curled
his bearded lip.</p>

<p>Tarzan could hear the woman's voice commanding the fellow to
leave her cabin. "I shall send for my husband," she cried. "He
will show you no mercy." Paulvitch's sneering laugh came through
the polished panels.</p>

<p>"The purser will fetch your husband, madame," said the man.
"In fact, that officer has already been notified that you are
entertaining a man other than your husband behind the locked door
of your cabin."</p>

<p>"Bah!" cried the woman. "My husband will know!"</p>

<p>"Most assuredly your husband will know, but the purser will
not; nor will the newspaper men who shall in some mysterious way
hear of it on our landing. But they will think it a fine story,
and so will all your friends when they read of it at breakfast
on&mdash;let me see, this is Tuesday&mdash;yes, when they read of
it at breakfast next Friday morning. Nor will it detract from the
interest they will all feel when they learn that the man whom
madame entertained is a Russian servant&mdash;her brother's
valet, to be quite exact."</p>

<p>"Alexis Paulvitch," came the woman's voice, cold and fearless,
"you are a coward, and when I whisper a certain name in your ear
you will think better of your demands upon me and your threats
against me, and then you will leave my cabin quickly, nor do I
think that ever again will you, at least, annoy me," and there
came a moment's silence in which Tarzan could imagine the woman
leaning toward the scoundrel and whispering the thing she had
hinted at into his ear. Only a moment of silence, and then a
startled oath from the man&mdash;the scuffling of feet&mdash;a
woman's scream&mdash;and silence.</p>

<p>But scarcely had the cry ceased before the ape-man had leaped
from his hiding-place. Rokoff started to run, but Tarzan grasped
him by the collar and dragged him back. Neither spoke, for both
felt instinctively that murder was being done in that room, and
Tarzan was confident that Rokoff had had no intention that his
confederate should go that far&mdash;he felt that the man's aims
were deeper than that&mdash;deeper and even more sinister than
brutal, cold-blooded murder. Without hesitating to question those
within, the ape-man threw his giant shoulder against the frail
panel, and in a shower of splintered wood he entered the cabin,
dragging Rokoff after him. Before him, on a couch, the woman lay,
and on top of her was Paulvitch, his fingers gripping the fair
throat, while his victim's hands beat futilely at his face,
tearing desperately at the cruel fingers that were forcing the
life from her.</p>

<p>The noise of his entrance brought Paulvitch to his feet, where
he stood glowering menacingly at Tarzan. The girl rose
falteringly to a sitting posture upon the couch. One hand was at
her throat, and her breath came in little gasps. Although
disheveled and very pale, Tarzan recognized her as the young
woman whom he had caught staring at him on deck earlier in the
day.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this?" said Tarzan, turning to Rokoff,
whom he intuitively singled out as the instigator of the outrage.
The man remained silent, scowling. "Touch the button, please,"
continued the ape-man; "we will have one of the ship's officers
here&mdash;this affair has gone quite far enough."</p>

<p>"No, no," cried the girl, coming suddenly to her feet. "Please
do not do that. I am sure that there was no real intention to
harm me. I angered this person, and he lost control of himself,
that is all. I would not care to have the matter go further,
please, monsieur," and there was such a note of pleading in her
voice that Tarzan could not press the matter, though his better
judgment warned him that there was something afoot here of which
the proper authorities should be made cognizant.</p>

<p>"You wish me to do nothing, then, in the matter?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing, please," she replied.</p>

<p>"You are content that these two scoundrels should continue
persecuting you?" She did not seem to know what answer to make,
and looked very troubled and unhappy. Tarzan saw a malicious grin
of triumph curl Rokoff's lip. The girl evidently was in fear of
these two&mdash;she dared not express her real desires before
them.</p>

<p>"Then," said Tarzan, "I shall act on my own responsibility. To
you," he continued, turning to Rokoff, "and this includes your
accomplice, I may say that from now on to the end of the voyage I
shall take it upon myself to keep an eye on you, and should there
chance to come to my notice any act of either one of you that
might even remotely annoy this young woman you shall be called to
account for it directly to me, nor shall the calling or the
accounting be pleasant experiences for either of you.</p>

<p>"Now get out of here," and he grabbed Rokoff and Paulvitch
each by the scruff of the neck and thrust them forcibly through
the doorway, giving each an added impetus down the corridor with
the toe of his boot. Then he turned back to the stateroom and the
girl. She was looking at him in wide-eyed astonishment.</p>

<p>"And you, madame, will confer a great favor upon me if you
will but let me know if either of those rascals troubles you
further."</p>

<p>"Ah, monsieur," she answered, "I hope that you will not suffer
for the kind deed you attempted. You have made a very wicked and
resourceful enemy, who will stop at nothing to satisfy his
hatred. You must be very careful indeed, Monsieur&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, madame, my name is Tarzan."</p>

<p>"Monsieur Tarzan. And because I would not consent to notify
the officers, do not think that I am not sincerely grateful to
you for the brave and chivalrous protection you rendered me. Good
night, Monsieur Tarzan. I shall never forget the debt I owe you,"
and, with a most winsome smile that displayed a row of perfect
teeth, the girl curtsied to Tarzan, who bade her good night and
made his way on deck.</p>

<p>It puzzled the man considerably that there should be two on
board&mdash;this girl and Count de Coude&mdash;who suffered
indignities at the hands of Rokoff and his companion, and yet
would not permit the offenders to be brought to justice. Before
he turned in that night his thoughts reverted many times to the
beautiful young woman into the evidently tangled web of whose
life fate had so strangely introduced him.</p>

<p>It occurred to him that he had not learned her name. That she
was married had been evidenced by the narrow gold band that
encircled the third finger of her left hand. Involuntarily he
wondered who the lucky man might be.</p>

<p>Tarzan saw nothing further of any of the actors in the little
drama that he had caught a fleeting glimpse of until late in the
afternoon of the last day of the voyage. Then he came suddenly
face to face with the young woman as the two approached their
deck chairs from opposite directions. She greeted him with a
pleasant smile, speaking almost immediately of the affair he had
witnessed in her cabin two nights before. It was as though she
had been perturbed by a conviction that he might have construed
her acquaintance with such men as Rokoff and Paulvitch as a
personal reflection upon herself.</p>

<p>"I trust monsieur has not judged me," she said, "by the
unfortunate occurrence of Tuesday evening. I have suffered much
on account of it&mdash;this is the first time that I have
ventured from my cabin since; I have been ashamed," she concluded
simply.</p>

<p>"One does not judge the gazelle by the lions that attack it,"
replied Tarzan. "I had seen those two work before&mdash;in the
smoking-room the day prior to their attack on you, if I recollect
it correctly, and so, knowing their methods, I am convinced that
their enmity is a sufficient guarantee of the integrity of its
object. Men such as they must cleave only to the vile, hating all
that is noblest and best."</p>

<p>"It is very kind of you to put it that way," she replied,
smiling.</p>

<p>"I have already heard of the matter of the card game. My
husband told me the entire story. He spoke especially of the
strength and bravery of Monsieur Tarzan, to whom he feels that he
owes an immense debt of gratitude."</p>

<p>"Your husband?" repeated Tarzan questioningly.</p>

<p>"Yes. I am the Countess de Coude."</p>

<p>"I am already amply repaid, madame, in knowing that I have
rendered a service to the wife of the Count de Coude."</p>

<p>"Alas, monsieur, I already am so greatly indebted to you that
I may never hope to settle my own account, so pray do not add
further to my obligations," and she smiled so sweetly upon him
that Tarzan felt that a man might easily attempt much greater
things than he had accomplished, solely for the pleasure of
receiving the benediction of that smile.</p>

<p>He did not see her again that day, and in the rush of landing
on the following morning he missed her entirely, but there had
been something in the expression of her eyes as they parted on
deck the previous day that haunted him. It had been almost
wistful as they had spoken of the strangeness of the swift
friendships of an ocean crossing, and of the equal ease with
which they are broken forever.</p>

<p>Tarzan wondered if he should ever see her again.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap3" id="chap3">III. &mdash; WHAT HAPPENED IN THE
RUE MAULE</a></h2>

<div align="center"> <img src="fr100053-images/TheReturnOfTarzan-03.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration"> </div><br>

<p class="first">On his arrival in Paris, Tarzan had gone
directly to the apartments of his old friend, D'Arnot, where the
naval lieutenant had scored him roundly for his decision to
renounce the title and estates that were rightly his from his
father, John Clayton, the late Lord Greystoke.</p>

<p>"You must be mad, my friend," said D'Arnot, "thus lightly to
give up not alone wealth and position, but an opportunity to
prove beyond doubt to all the world that in your veins flows the
noble blood of two of England's most honored houses&mdash;instead
of the blood of a savage she-ape. It is incredible that they
could have believed you&mdash;Miss Porter least of all.</p>

<p>"Why, I never did believe it, even back in the wilds of your
African jungle, when you tore the raw meat of your kills with
mighty jaws, like some wild beast, and wiped your greasy hands
upon your thighs.</p>

<p>"Even then, before there was the slightest proof to the
contrary, I knew that you were mistaken in the belief that Kala
was your mother."</p>

<p>"And now, with your father's diary of the terrible life led by
him and your mother on that wild African shore; with the account
of your birth, and, final and most convincing proof of all, your
own baby finger prints upon the pages of it, it seems incredible
to me that you are willing to remain a nameless, penniless
vagabond."</p>

<p>"I do not need any better name than Tarzan," replied the ape-
man; "and as for remaining a penniless vagabond, I have no
intention of so doing. In fact, the next, and let us hope the
last, burden that I shall be forced to put upon your unselfish
friendship will be the finding of employment for me."</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh!" scoffed D'Arnot. "You know that I did not mean
that.</p>

<p>"Have I not told you a dozen times that I have enough for
twenty men, and that half of what I have is yours? And if I gave
it all to you, would it represent even the tenth part of the
value I place upon your friendship, my Tarzan? Would it repay the
services you did me in Africa? I do not forget, my friend, that
but for you and your wondrous bravery I had died at the stake in
the village of Mbonga's cannibals. Nor do I forget that to your
self-sacrificing devotion I owe the fact that I recovered from
the terrible wounds I received at their hands&mdash;I discovered
later something of what it meant to you to remain with me in the
amphitheater of apes while your heart was urging you on to the
coast.</p>

<p>"When we finally came there, and found that Miss Porter and
her party had left, I commenced to realize something of what you
had done for an utter stranger. Nor am I trying to repay you with
money, Tarzan. It is that just at present you need money; were it
sacrifice that I might offer you it were the same&mdash;my
friendship must always be yours, because our tastes are similar,
and I admire you. That I cannot command, but the money I can and
shall."</p>

<p>"Well," laughed Tarzan, "we shall not quarrel over the money.
I must live, and so I must have it; but I shall be more contented
with something to do. You cannot show me your friendship in a
more convincing manner than to find employment for me&mdash;I
shall die of inactivity in a short while. As for my
birthright&mdash;it is in good hands. Clayton is not guilty of
robbing me of it. He truly believes that he is the real Lord
Greystoke, and the chances are that he will make a better English
lord than a man who was born and raised in an African jungle. You
know that I am but half civilized even now. Let me see red in
anger but for a moment, and all the instincts of the savage beast
that I really am, submerge what little I possess of the milder
ways of culture and refinement.</p>

<p>"And then again, had I declared myself I should have robbed
the woman I love of the wealth and position that her marriage to
Clayton will now insure to her. I could not have done
that&mdash;could I, Paul?</p>

<p>"Nor is the matter of birth of great importance to me," he
went on, without waiting for a reply. "Raised as I have been, I
see no worth in man or beast that is not theirs by virtue of
their own mental or physical prowess. And so I am as happy to
think of Kala as my mother as I would be to try to picture the
poor, unhappy little English girl who passed away a year after
she bore me. Kala was always kind to me in her fierce and savage
way. I must have nursed at her hairy breast from the time that my
own mother died. She fought for me against the wild denizens of
the forest, and against the savage members of our tribe, with the
ferocity of real mother love.</p>

<p>"And I, on my part, loved her, Paul. I did not realize how
much until after the cruel spear and the poisoned arrow of
Mbonga's black warrior had stolen her away from me. I was still a
child when that occurred, and I threw myself upon her dead body
and wept out my anguish as a child might for his own mother. To
you, my friend, she would have appeared a hideous and ugly
creature, but to me she was beautiful&mdash;so gloriously does
love transfigure its object. And so I am perfectly content to
remain forever the son of Kala, the she-ape."</p>

<p>"I do not admire you the less for your loyalty," said D'Arnot,
"but the time will come when you will be glad to claim your own.
Remember what I say, and let us hope that it will be as easy then
as it is now. You must bear in mind that Professor Porter and Mr.
Philander are the only people in the world who can swear that the
little skeleton found in the cabin with those of your father and
mother was that of an infant anthropoid ape, and not the
offspring of Lord and Lady Greystoke. That evidence is most
important. They are both old men. They may not live many years
longer. And then, did it not occur to you that once Miss Porter
knew the truth she would break her engagement with Clayton? You
might easily have your title, your estates, and the woman you
love, Tarzan. Had you not thought of that?"</p>

<p>Tarzan shook his head.</p>

<p>"You do not know her," he said. "Nothing could bind her closer
to her bargain than some misfortune to Clayton. She is from an
old southern family in America, and southerners pride themselves
upon their loyalty."</p>

<p>Tarzan spent the two following weeks renewing his former brief
acquaintance with Paris. In the daytime he haunted the libraries
and picture galleries. He had become an omnivorous reader, and
the world of possibilities that were opened to him in this seat
of culture and learning fairly appalled him when he contemplated
the very infinitesimal crumb of the sum total of human knowledge
that a single individual might hope to acquire even after a
lifetime of study and research; but he learned what he could by
day, and threw himself into a search for relaxation and amusement
at night. Nor did he find Paris a whit less fertile field for his
nocturnal avocation.</p>

<p>If he smoked too many cigarettes and drank too much absinth it
was because he took civilization as he found it, and did the
things that he found his civilized brothers doing. The life was a
new and alluring one, and in addition he had a sorrow in his
breast and a great longing which he knew could never be
fulfilled, and so he sought in study and in dissipation&mdash;the
two extremes&mdash;to forget the past and inhibit contemplation
of the future.</p>

<p>He was sitting in a music hall one evening, sipping his
absinth and admiring the art of a certain famous Russian dancer,
when he caught a passing glimpse of a pair of evil black eyes
upon him.</p>

<p>The man turned and was lost in the crowd at the exit before
Tarzan could catch a good look at him, but he was confident that
he had seen those eyes before and that they had been fastened on
him this evening through no passing accident. He had had the
uncanny feeling for some time that he was being watched, and it
was in response to this animal instinct that was strong within
him that he had turned suddenly and surprised the eyes in the
very act of watching him.</p>

<p>Before he left the music hall the matter had been forgotten,
nor did he notice the swarthy individual who stepped deeper into
the shadows of an opposite doorway as Tarzan emerged from the
brilliantly lighted amusement hall.</p>

<p>Had Tarzan but known it, he had been followed many times from
this and other places of amusement, but seldom if ever had he
been alone.</p>

<p>Tonight D'Arnot had had another engagement, and Tarzan had
come by himself.</p>

<p>As he turned in the direction he was accustomed to taking from
this part of Paris to his apartments, the watcher across the
street ran from his hiding-place and hurried on ahead at a rapid
pace.</p>

<p>Tarzan had been wont to traverse the Rue Maule on his way home
at night. Because it was very quiet and very dark it reminded him
more of his beloved African jungle than did the noisy and garish
streets surrounding it. If you are familiar with your Paris you
will recall the narrow, forbidding precincts of the Rue Maule. If
you are not, you need but ask the police about it to learn that
in all Paris there is no street to which you should give a wider
berth after dark.</p>

<p>On this night Tarzan had proceeded some two squares through
the dense shadows of the squalid old tenements which line this
dismal way when he was attracted by screams and cries for help
from the third floor of an opposite building. The voice was a
woman's.</p>

<p>Before the echoes of her first cries had died Tarzan was
bounding up the stairs and through the dark corridors to her
rescue.</p>

<p>At the end of the corridor on the third landing a door stood
slightly ajar, and from within Tarzan heard again the same appeal
that had lured him from the street. Another instant found him in
the center of a dimly-lighted room. An oil lamp burned upon a
high, old-fashioned mantel, casting its dim rays over a dozen
repulsive figures. All but one were men. The other was a woman of
about thirty. Her face, marked by low passions and dissipation,
might once have been lovely. She stood with one hand at her
throat, crouching against the farther wall.</p>

<p>"Help, monsieur," she cried in a low voice as Tarzan entered
the room; "they were killing me." As Tarzan turned toward the men
about him he saw the crafty, evil faces of habitual criminals. He
wondered that they had made no effort to escape. A movement
behind him caused him to turn. Two things his eyes saw, and one
of them caused him considerable wonderment. A man was sneaking
stealthily from the room, and in the brief glance that Tarzan had
of him he saw that it was Rokoff.</p>

<p>But the other thing that he saw was of more immediate
interest. It was a great brute of a fellow tiptoeing upon him
from behind with a huge bludgeon in his hand, and then, as the
man and his confederates saw that he was discovered, there was a
concerted rush upon Tarzan from all sides. Some of the men drew
knives. Others picked up chairs, while the fellow with the
bludgeon raised it high above his head in a mighty swing that
would have crushed Tarzan's head had it ever descended upon
it.</p>

<p>But the brain, and the agility, and the muscles that had coped
with the mighty strength and cruel craftiness of Terkoz and Numa
in the fastness of their savage jungle were not to be so easily
subdued as these apaches of Paris had believed.</p>

<p>Selecting his most formidable antagonist, the fellow with the
bludgeon, Tarzan charged full upon him, dodging the falling
weapon, and catching the man a terrific blow on the point of the
chin that felled him in his tracks.</p>

<p>Then he turned upon the others. This was sport. He was
reveling in the joy of battle and the lust of blood. As though it
had been but a brittle shell, to break at the least rough usage,
the thin veneer of his civilization fell from him, and the ten
burly villains found themselves penned in a small room with a
wild and savage beast, against whose steel muscles their puny
strength was less than futile.</p>

<p>At the end of the corridor without stood Rokoff, waiting the
outcome of the affair. He wished to be sure that Tarzan was dead
before he left, but it was not a part of his plan to be one of
those within the room when the murder occurred.</p>

<p>The woman still stood where she had when Tarzan entered, but
her face had undergone a number of changes with the few minutes
which had elapsed. From the semblance of distress which it had
worn when Tarzan first saw it, it had changed to one of
craftiness as he had wheeled to meet the attack from behind; but
the change Tarzan had not seen.</p>

<p>Later an expression of surprise and then one of horror
superseded the others. And who may wonder. For the immaculate
gentleman her cries had lured to what was to have been his death
had been suddenly metamorphosed into a demon of revenge. Instead
of soft muscles and a weak resistance, she was looking upon a
veritable Hercules gone mad.</p>

<p><i>"Mon Dieu!"</i> she cried; "he is a beast!" For the strong,
white teeth of the ape-man had found the throat of one of his
assailants, and Tarzan fought as he had learned to fight with the
great bull apes of the tribe of Kerchak.</p>

<p>He was in a dozen places at once, leaping hither and thither
about the room in sinuous bounds that reminded the woman of a
panther she had seen at the zoo. Now a wrist-bone snapped in his
iron grip, now a shoulder was wrenched from its socket as he
forced a victim's arm backward and upward.</p>

<p>With shrieks of pain the men escaped into the hallway as
quickly as they could; but even before the first one staggered,
bleeding and broken, from the room, Rokoff had seen enough to
convince him that Tarzan would not be the one to lie dead in that
house this night, and so the Russian had hastened to a nearby den
and telephoned the police that a man was committing murder on the
third floor of Rue Maule, 27. When the officers arrived they
found three men groaning on the floor, a frightened woman lying
upon a filthy bed, her face buried in her arms, and what appeared
to be a well-dressed young gentleman standing in the center of
the room awaiting the reinforcements which he had thought the
footsteps of the officers hurrying up the stairway had
announced&mdash;but they were mistaken in the last; it was a wild
beast that looked upon them through those narrowed lids and
steel-gray eyes. With the smell of blood the last vestige of
civilization had deserted Tarzan, and now he stood at bay, like a
lion surrounded by hunters, awaiting the next overt act, and
crouching to charge its author.</p>

<p>"What has happened here?" asked one of the policemen.</p>

<p>Tarzan explained briefly, but when he turned to the woman for
confirmation of his statement he was appalled by her reply.</p>

<p>"He lies!" she screamed shrilly, addressing the policeman. "He
came to my room while I was alone, and for no good purpose. When
I repulsed him he would have killed me had not my screams
attracted these gentlemen, who were passing the house at the
time. He is a devil, messieurs; alone he has all but killed ten
men with his bare hands and his teeth." So shocked was Tarzan by
her ingratitude that for a moment he was struck dumb. The police
were inclined to be a little skeptical, for they had had other
dealings with this same lady and her lovely coterie of gentlemen
friends. However, they were policemen, not judges, so they
decided to place all the inmates of the room under arrest, and
let another, whose business it was, separate the innocent from
the guilty.</p>

<p>But they found that it was one thing to tell this well-dressed
young man that he was under arrest, but quite another to enforce
it.</p>

<p>"I am guilty of no offense," he said quietly. "I have but
sought to defend myself. I do not know why the woman has told you
what she has. She can have no enmity against me, for never until
I came to this room in response to her cries for help had I seen
her."</p>

<p>"Come, come," said one of the officers; "there are judges to
listen to all that," and he advanced to lay his hand upon
Tarzan's shoulder. An instant later he lay crumpled in a corner
of the room, and then, as his comrades rushed in upon the ape-
man, they experienced a taste of what the apaches had but
recently gone through. So quickly and so roughly did he handle
them that they had not even an opportunity to draw their
revolvers.</p>

<p>During the brief fight Tarzan had noted the open window and,
beyond, the stem of a tree, or a telegraph pole&mdash;he could
not tell which.</p>

<p>As the last officer went down, one of his fellows succeeded in
drawing his revolver and, from where he lay on the floor, fired
at Tarzan. The shot missed, and before the man could fire again
Tarzan had swept the lamp from the mantel and plunged the room
into darkness.</p>

<p>The next they saw was a lithe form spring to the sill of the
open window and leap, panther-like, onto the pole across the
walk. When the police gathered themselves together and reached
the street their prisoner was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>They did not handle the woman and the men who had not escaped
any too gently when they took them to the station; they were a
very sore and humiliated detail of police. It galled them to
think that it would be necessary to report that a single unarmed
man had wiped the floor with the whole lot of them, and then
escaped them as easily as though they had not existed.</p>

<p>The officer who had remained in the street swore that no one
had leaped from the window or left the building from the time
they entered until they had come out. His comrades thought that
he lied, but they could not prove it.</p>

<p>When Tarzan found himself clinging to the pole outside the
window, he followed his jungle instinct and looked below for
enemies before he ventured down. It was well he did, for just
beneath stood a policeman. Above, Tarzan saw no one, so he went
up instead of down.</p>

<p>The top of the pole was opposite the roof of the building, so
it was but the work of an instant for the muscles that had for
years sent him hurtling through the treetops of his primeval
forest to carry him across the little space between the pole and
the roof.</p>

<p>From one building he went to another, and so on, with much
climbing, until at a cross street he discovered another pole,
down which he ran to the ground.</p>

<p>For a square or two he ran swiftly; then he turned into a
little all-night cafe and in the lavatory removed the evidences
of his over-roof promenade from hands and clothes. When he
emerged a few moments later it was to saunter slowly on toward
his apartments.</p>

<p>Not far from them he came to a well-lighted boulevard which it
was necessary to cross. As he stood directly beneath a brilliant
arc light, waiting for a limousine that was approaching to pass
him, he heard his name called in a sweet feminine voice. Looking
up, he met the smiling eyes of Olga de Coude as she leaned
forward upon the back seat of the machine. He bowed very low in
response to her friendly greeting. When he straightened up the
machine had borne her away.</p>

<p>"Rokoff and the Countess de Coude both in the same evening,"
he soliloquized; "Paris is not so large, after all."</p> <hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap4" id="chap4">IV. &mdash; THE COUNTESS
EXPLAINS</a></h2>

<div align="center"> <img src="fr100053-images/TheReturnOfTarzan-04.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration"> </div><br>

<p class="first">"Your Paris is more dangerous than my savage
jungles, Paul," concluded Tarzan, after narrating his adventures
to his friend the morning following his encounter with the
apaches and police in the Rue Maule. "Why did they lure me there?
Were they hungry?" D'Arnot feigned a horrified shudder, but he
laughed at the quaint suggestion.</p>

<p>"It is difficult to rise above the jungle standards and reason
by the light of civilized ways, is it not, my friend?" he queried
banteringly.</p>

<p>"Civilized ways, forsooth," scoffed Tarzan. "Jungle standards
do not countenance wanton atrocities. There we kill for food and
for self-preservation, or in the winning of mates and the
protection of the young. Always, you see, in accordance with the
dictates of some great natural law. But here! Faugh, your
civilized man is more brutal than the brutes. He kills wantonly,
and, worse than that, he utilizes a noble sentiment, the
brotherhood of man, as a lure to entice his unwary victim to his
doom. It was in answer to an appeal from a fellow being that I
hastened to that room where the assassins lay in wait for me.</p>

<p>"I did not realize, I could not realize for a long time
afterward, that any woman could sink to such moral depravity as
that one must have to call a would-be rescuer to death. But it
must have been so&mdash;the sight of Rokoff there and the woman's
later repudiation of me to the police make it impossible to place
any other construction upon her acts. Rokoff must have known that
I frequently passed through the Rue Maule. He lay in wait for
me&mdash;his entire scheme worked out to the last detail, even to
the woman's story in case a hitch should occur in the program
such as really did happen. It is all perfectly plain to me."</p>

<p>"Well," said D'Arnot, "among other things, it has taught you
what I have been unable to impress upon you&mdash;that the Rue
Maule is a good place to avoid after dark."</p>

<p>"On the contrary," replied Tarzan, with a smile, "it has
convinced me that it is the one worth-while street in all Paris.
Never again shall I miss an opportunity to traverse it, for it
has given me the first real entertainment I have had since I left
Africa."</p>

<p>"It may give you more than you will relish even without
another visit," said D'Arnot. "You are not through with the
police yet, remember. I know the Paris police well enough to
assure you that they will not soon forget what you did to them.
Sooner or later they will get you, my dear Tarzan, and then they
will lock the wild man of the woods up behind iron bars. How will
you like that?"</p>

<p>"They will never lock Tarzan of the Apes behind iron bars,"
replied he, grimly.</p>

<p>There was something in the man's voice as he said it that
caused D'Arnot to look up sharply at his friend. What he saw in
the set jaw and the cold, gray eyes made the young Frenchman very
apprehensive for this great child, who could recognize no law
mightier than his own mighty physical prowess. He saw that
something must be done to set Tarzan right with the police before
another encounter was possible.</p>

<p>"You have much to learn, Tarzan," he said gravely. "The law of
man must be respected, whether you relish it or no. Nothing but
trouble can come to you and your friends should you persist in
defying the police. I can explain it to them once for you, and
that I shall do this very day, but hereafter you must obey the
law. If its representatives say 'Come,' you must come; if they
say 'Go,' you must go. Now we shall go to my great friend in the
department and fix up this matter of the Rue Maule. Come!"</p>

<p>Together they entered the office of the police official a half
hour later. He was very cordial. He remembered Tarzan from the
visit the two had made him several months prior in the matter of
finger prints.</p>

<p>When D'Arnot had concluded the narration of the events which
had transpired the previous evening, a grim smile was playing
about the lips of the policeman. He touched a button near his
hand, and as he waited for the clerk to respond to its summons he
searched through the papers on his desk for one which he finally
located.</p>

<p>"Here, Joubon," he said as the clerk entered. "Summon these
officers&mdash;have them come to me at once," and he handed the
man the paper he had sought. Then he turned to Tarzan.</p>

<p>"You have committed a very grave offense, monsieur," he said,
not unkindly, "and but for the explanation made by our good
friend here I should be inclined to judge you harshly. I am,
instead, about to do a rather unheard-of-thing. I have summoned
the officers whom you maltreated last night. They shall hear
Lieutenant D'Arnot's story, and then I shall leave it to their
discretion to say whether you shall be prosecuted or not.</p>

<p>"You have much to learn about the ways of civilization. Things
that seem strange or unnecessary to you, you must learn to accept
until you are able to judge the motives behind them. The officers
whom you attacked were but doing their duty. They had no
discretion in the matter. Every day they risk their lives in the
protection of the lives or property of others. They would do the
same for you. They are very brave men, and they are deeply
mortified that a single unarmed man bested and beat them.</p>

<p>"Make it easy for them to overlook what you did. Unless I am
gravely in error you are yourself a very brave man, and brave men
are proverbially magnanimous." Further conversation was
interrupted by the appearance of the four policemen. As their
eyes fell on Tarzan, surprise was writ large on each
countenance.</p>

<p>"My children," said the official, "here is the gentleman whom
you met in the Rue Maule last evening. He has come voluntarily to
give himself up. I wish you to listen attentively to Lieutenant
D'Arnot, who will tell you a part of the story of monsieur's
life. It may explain his attitude toward you of last night.
Proceed, my dear lieutenant."</p>

<p>D'Arnot spoke to the policemen for half an hour. He told them
something of Tarzan's wild jungle life. He explained the savage
training that had taught him to battle like a wild beast in self-
preservation. It became plain to them that the man had been
guided by instinct rather than reason in his attack upon them. He
had not understood their intentions. To him they had been little
different from any of the various forms of life he had been
accustomed to in his native jungle, where practically all were
his enemies.</p>

<p>"Your pride has been wounded," said D'Arnot, in conclusion.
"It is the fact that this man overcame you that hurts the most.
But you need feel no shame. You would not make apologies for
defeat had you been penned in that small room with an African
lion, or with the great Gorilla of the jungles.</p>

<p>"And yet you were battling with muscles that have time and
time again been pitted, and always victoriously, against these
terrors of the dark continent. It is no disgrace to fall beneath
the superhuman strength of Tarzan of the Apes." And then, as the
men stood looking first at Tarzan and then at their superior the
ape-man did the one thing which was needed to erase the last
remnant of animosity which they might have felt for him. With
outstretched hand he advanced toward them.</p>

<p>"I am sorry for the mistake I made," he said simply. "Let us
be friends." And that was the end of the whole matter, except
that Tarzan became a subject of much conversation in the barracks
of the police, and increased the number of his friends by four
brave men at least.</p>

<p>On their return to D'Arnot's apartments the lieutenant found a
letter awaiting him from an English friend, William Cecil
Clayton, Lord Greystoke. The two had maintained a correspondence
since the birth of their friendship on that ill-fated expedition
in search of Jane Porter after her theft by Terkoz, the bull
ape.</p>

<p>"They are to be married in London in about two months," said
D'Arnot, as he completed his perusal of the letter. Tarzan did
not need to be told who was meant by "they." He made no reply,
but he was very quiet and thoughtful during the balance of the
day.</p>

<p>That evening they attended the opera. Tarzan's mind was still
occupied by his gloomy thoughts. He paid little or no attention
to what was transpiring upon the stage. Instead he saw only the
lovely vision of a beautiful American girl, and heard naught but
a sad, sweet voice acknowledging that his love was returned. And
she was to marry another! He shook himself to be rid of his
unwelcome thoughts, and at the same instant he felt eyes upon
him. With the instinct that was his by virtue of training he
looked up squarely into the eyes that were looking at him, to
find that they were shining from the smiling face of Olga,
Countess de Coude. As Tarzan returned her bow he was positive
that there was an invitation in her look, almost a plea.</p>

<p>The next intermission found him beside her in her box.</p>

<p>"I have so much wished to see you," she was saying. "It has
troubled me not a little to think that after the service you
rendered to both my husband and myself no adequate explanation
was ever made you of what must have seemed ingratitude on our
part in not taking the necessary steps to prevent a repetition of
the attacks upon us by those two men."</p>

<p>"You wrong me," replied Tarzan. "My thoughts of you have been
only the most pleasant. You must not feel that any explanation is
due me. Have they annoyed you further?"</p>

<p>"They never cease," she replied sadly. "I feel that I must
tell some one, and I do not know another who so deserves an
explanation as you. You must permit me to do so. It may be of
service to you, for I know Nikolas Rokoff quite well enough to be
positive that you have not seen the last of him. He will find
some means to be revenged upon you. What I wish to tell you may
be of aid to you in combating any scheme of revenge he may
harbor. I cannot tell you here, but tomorrow I shall be at home
to Monsieur Tarzan at five."</p>

<p>"It will be an eternity until tomorrow at five," he said, as
he bade her good night. From a corner of the theater Rokoff and
Paulvitch saw Monsieur Tarzan in the box of the Countess de
Coude, and both men smiled.</p>

<p>At four-thirty the following afternoon a swarthy, bearded man
rang the bell at the servants' entrance of the palace of the
Count de Coude. The footman who opened the door raised his
eyebrows in recognition as he saw who stood without. A low
conversation passed between the two.</p>

<p>At first the footman demurred from some proposition that the
bearded one made, but an instant later something passed from the
hand of the caller to the hand of the servant. Then the latter
turned and led the visitor by a roundabout way to a little
curtained alcove off the apartment in which the countess was wont
to serve tea of an afternoon.</p>

<p>A half hour later Tarzan was ushered into the room, and
presently his hostess entered, smiling, and with outstretched
hands.</p>

<p>"I am so glad that you came," she said.</p>

<p>"Nothing could have prevented," he replied.</p>

<p>For a few moments they spoke of the opera, of the topics that
were then occupying the attention of Paris, of the pleasure of
renewing their brief acquaintance which had had its inception
under such odd circumstances, and this brought them to the
subject that was uppermost in the minds of both.</p>

<p>"You must have wondered," said the countess finally, "what the
object of Rokoff's persecution could be. It is very simple. The
count is intrusted with many of the vital secrets of the ministry
of war. He often has in his possession papers that foreign powers
would give a fortune to possess&mdash;secrets of state that their
agents would commit murder and worse than murder to learn.</p>

<p>"There is such a matter now in his possession that would make
the fame and fortune of any Russian who could divulge it to his
government. Rokoff and Paulvitch are Russian spies. They will
stop at nothing to procure this information. The affair on the
liner&mdash;I mean the matter of the card game&mdash;was for the
purpose of blackmailing the knowledge they seek from my
husband.</p>

<p>"Had he been convicted of cheating at cards, his career would
have been blighted. He would have had to leave the war
department. He would have been socially ostracized. They intended
to hold this club over him&mdash;the price of an avowal on their
part that the count was but the victim of the plot of enemies who
wished to besmirch his name was to have been the papers they
seek.</p>

<p>"You thwarted them in this. Then they concocted the scheme
whereby my reputation was to be the price, instead of the
count's. When Paulvitch entered my cabin he explained it to me.
If I would obtain the information for them he promised to go no
farther, otherwise Rokoff, who stood without, was to notify the
purser that I was entertaining a man other than my husband behind
the locked doors of my cabin. He was to tell every one he met on
the boat, and when we landed he was to have given the whole story
to the newspaper men.</p>

<p>"Was it not too horrible? But I happened to know something of
Monsieur Paulvitch that would send him to the gallows in Russia
if it were known by the police of St. Petersburg. I dared him to
carry out his plan, and then I leaned toward him and whispered a
name in his ear. Like that"&mdash;and she snapped her
fingers&mdash;"he flew at my throat as a madman. He would have
killed me had you not interfered."</p>

<p>"The brutes!" muttered Tarzan.</p>

<p>"They are worse than that, my friend," she said.</p>

<p>"They are devils. I fear for you because you have gained their
hatred. I wish you to be on your guard constantly. Tell me that
you will, for my sake, for I should never forgive myself should
you suffer through the kindness you did me."</p>

<p>"I do not fear them," he replied. "I have survived grimmer
enemies than Rokoff and Paulvitch." He saw that she knew nothing
of the occurrence in the Rue Maule, nor did he mention it,
fearing that it might distress her.</p>

<p>"For your own safety," he continued, "why do you not turn the
scoundrels over to the authorities? They should make quick work
of them." She hesitated for a moment before replying.</p>

<p>"There are two reasons," she said finally. "One of them it is
that keeps the count from doing that very thing. The other, my
real reason for fearing to expose them, I have never
told&mdash;only Rokoff and I know it. I wonder," and then she
paused, looking intently at him for a long time.</p>

<p>"And what do you wonder?" he asked, smiling.</p>

<p>"I was wondering why it is that I want to tell you the thing
that I have not dared tell even to my husband. I believe that you
would understand, and that you could tell me the right course to
follow. I believe that you would not judge me too harshly."</p>

<p>"I fear that I should prove a very poor judge, madame," Tarzan
replied, "for if you had been guilty of murder I should say that
the victim should be grateful to have met so sweet a fate."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no," she expostulated; "it is not so terrible as
that.</p>

<p>"But first let me tell you the reason the count has for not
prosecuting these men; then, if I can hold my courage, I shall
tell you the real reason that I dare not. The first is that
Nikolas Rokoff is my brother. We are Russians. Nikolas has been a
bad man since I can remember. He was cashiered from the Russian
army, in which he held a captaincy. There was a scandal for a
time, but after a while it was partially forgotten, and my father
obtained a position for him in the secret service.</p>

<p>"There have been many terrible crimes laid at Nikolas' door,
but he has always managed to escape punishment. Of late he has
accomplished it by trumped-up evidence convicting his victims of
treason against the czar, and the Russian police, who are always
only too ready to fasten guilt of this nature upon any and all,
have accepted his version and exonerated him."</p>

<p>"Have not his attempted crimes against you and your husband
forfeited whatever rights the bonds of kinship might have
accorded him?" asked Tarzan. "The fact that you are his sister
has not deterred him from seeking to besmirch your honor. You owe
him no loyalty, madame."</p>

<p>"Ah, but there is that other reason. If I owe him no loyalty
though he be my brother, I cannot so easily disavow the fear I
hold him in because of a certain episode in my life of which he
is cognizant.</p>

<p>"I might as well tell you all," she resumed after a pause,
"for I see that it is in my heart to tell you sooner or later. I
was educated in a convent. While there I met a man whom I
supposed to be a gentleman. I knew little or nothing about men
and less about love. I got it into my foolish head that I loved
this man, and at his urgent request I ran away with him. We were
to have been married.</p>

<p>"I was with him just three hours. All in the daytime and in
public places&mdash;railroad stations and upon a train. When we
reached our destination where we were to have been married, two
officers stepped up to my escort as we descended from the train,
and placed him under arrest. They took me also, but when I had
told my story they did not detain me, other than to send me back
to the convent under the care of a matron. It seemed that the man
who had wooed me was no gentleman at all, but a deserter from the
army as well as a fugitive from civil justice. He had a police
record in nearly every country in Europe.</p>

<p>"The matter was hushed up by the authorities of the convent.
Not even my parents knew of it. But Nikolas met the man
afterward, and learned the whole story. Now he threatens to tell
the count if I do not do just as he wishes me to."</p>

<p>Tarzan laughed.</p>

<p>"You are still but a little girl. The story that you have told
me cannot reflect in any way upon your reputation, and were you
not a little girl at heart you would know it. Go to your husband
tonight, and tell him the whole story, just as you have told it
to me. Unless I am much mistaken he will laugh at you for your
fears, and take immediate steps to put that precious brother of
yours in prison where he belongs."</p>

<p>"I only wish that I dared," she said, "but I am afraid. I
learned early to fear men. First my father, then Nikolas, then
the fathers in the convent. Nearly all my friends fear their
husbands&mdash;why should I not fear mine?"</p>

<p>"It does not seem right that women should fear men," said
Tarzan, an expression of puzzlement on his face. "I am better
acquainted with the jungle folk, and there it is more often the
other way around, except among the black men, and they to my mind
are in most ways lower in the scale than the beasts. No, I cannot
understand why civilized women should fear men, the beings that
are created to protect them. I should hate to think that any
woman feared me."</p>

<p>"I do not think that any woman would fear you, my friend,"
said Olga de Coude softly. "I have known you but a short while,
yet though it may seem foolish to say it, you are the only man I
have ever known whom I think that I should never fear&mdash;it is
strange, too, for you are very strong. I wondered at the ease
with which you handled Nikolas and Paulvitch that night in my
cabin. It was marvelous." As Tarzan was leaving her a short time
later he wondered a little at the clinging pressure of her hand
at parting, and the firm insistence with which she exacted a
promise from him that he would call again on the morrow.</p>

<p>The memory of her half-veiled eyes and perfect lips as she had
stood smiling up into his face as he bade her good-by remained
with him for the balance of the day. Olga de Coude was a very
beautiful woman, and Tarzan of the Apes a very lonely young man,
with a heart in him that was in need of the doctoring that only a
woman may provide.</p>

<p>As the countess turned back into the room after Tarzan's
departure, she found herself face to face with Nikolas
Rokoff.</p>

<p>"How long have you been here?" she cried, shrinking away from
him.</p>

<p>"Since before your lover came," he answered, with a nasty
leer.</p>

<p>"Stop!" she commanded. "How dare you say such a thing to
me&mdash;your sister!"</p>

<p>"Well, my dear Olga, if he is not your lover, accept my
apologies; but it is no fault of yours that he is not. Had he
one-tenth the knowledge of women that I have you would be in his
arms this minute. He is a stupid fool, Olga. Why, your every word
and act was an open invitation to him, and he had not the sense
to see it."</p>

<p>The woman put her hands to her ears.</p>

<p>"I will not listen. You are wicked to say such things as that.
No matter what you may threaten me with, you know that I am a
good woman. After tonight you will not dare to annoy me, for I
shall tell Raoul all. He will understand, and then, Monsieur
Nikolas, beware!"</p>

<p>"You shall tell him nothing," said Rokoff. "I have this affair
now, and with the help of one of your servants whom I may trust
it will lack nothing in the telling when the time comes that the
details of the sworn evidence shall be poured into your husband's
ears. The other affair served its purpose well&mdash;we now have
something tangible to work on, Olga. A real
<i>affair</i>&mdash;and you a trusted wife. Shame, Olga," and the
brute laughed.</p>

<p>So the countess told her count nothing, and matters were worse
than they had been. From a vague fear her mind was transferred to
a very tangible one. It may be, too, that conscience helped to
enlarge it out of all proportion.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap5" id="chap5">V. &mdash; THE PLOT THAT
FAILED</a></h2>

<div align="center"> <img src="fr100053-images/TheReturnOfTarzan-05.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration"> </div><br>

<p class="first">For a month Tarzan was a regular and very
welcome devotee at the shrine of the beautiful Countess de Coude.
Often he met other members of the select little coterie that
dropped in for tea of an afternoon. More often Olga found devices
that would give her an hour of Tarzan alone.</p>

<p>For a time she had been frightened by what Nikolas had
insinuated.</p>

<p>She had not thought of this big, young man as anything more
than friend, but with the suggestion implanted by the evil words
of her brother she had grown to speculate much upon the strange
force which seemed to attract her toward the gray-eyed stranger.
She did not wish to love him, nor did she wish his love.</p>

<p>She was much younger than her husband, and without having
realized it she had been craving the haven of a friendship with
one nearer her own age. Twenty is shy in exchanging confidences
with forty.</p>

<p>Tarzan was but two years her senior. He could understand her,
she felt. Then he was clean and honorable and chivalrous. She was
not afraid of him. That she could trust him she had felt
instinctively from the first.</p>

<p>From a distance Rokoff had watched this growing intimacy with
malicious glee. Ever since he had learned that Tarzan knew that
he was a Russian spy there had been added to his hatred for the
ape-man a great fear that he would expose him. He was but waiting
now until the moment was propitious for a master stroke. He
wanted to rid himself forever of Tarzan, and at the same time
reap an ample revenge for the humiliations and defeats that he
had suffered at his hands.</p>

<p>Tarzan was nearer to contentment than he had been since the
peace and tranquility of his jungle had been broken in upon by
the advent of the marooned Porter party. He enjoyed the pleasant
social intercourse with Olga's friends, while the friendship
which had sprung up between the fair countess and himself was a
source of never-ending delight. It broke in upon and dispersed
his gloomy thoughts, and served as a balm to his lacerated
heart.</p>

<p>Sometimes D'Arnot accompanied him on his visits to the De
Coude home, for he had long known both Olga and the count.
Occasionally De Coude dropped in, but the multitudinous affairs
of his official position and the never-ending demands of politics
kept him from home usually until late at night.</p>

<p>Rokoff spied upon Tarzan almost constantly, waiting for the
time that he should call at the De Coude palace at night, but in
this he was doomed to disappointment. On several occasions Tarzan
accompanied the countess to her home after the opera, but he
invariably left her at the entrance&mdash;much to the disgust of
the lady's devoted brother.</p>

<p>Finding that it seemed impossible to trap Tarzan through any
voluntary act of his own, Rokoff and Paulvitch put their heads
together to hatch a plan that would trap the ape-man in all the
circumstantial evidence of a compromising position.</p>

<p>For days they watched the papers as well as the movements of
De Coude and Tarzan. At length they were rewarded. A morning
paper made brief mention of a smoker that was to be given on the
following evening by the German minister. De Coude's name was
among those of the invited guests. If he attended this meant that
he would be absent from his home until after midnight.</p>

<p>On the night of the banquet Paulvitch waited at the curb
before the residence of the German minister, where he could scan
the face of each guest that arrived. He had not long to wait
before De Coude descended from his car and passed him. That was
enough. Paulvitch hastened back to his quarters, where Rokoff
awaited him. There they waited until after eleven, then Paulvitch
took down the receiver of their telephone. He called a
number.</p>

<p>"The apartments of Lieutenant D'Arnot?" he asked, when he had
obtained his connection.</p>

<p>"A message for Monsieur Tarzan, if he will be so kind as to
step to the telephone." For a minute there was silence.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Tarzan?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, monsieur, this is François&mdash;in the service of
the Countess de Coude. Possibly monsieur does poor François the
honor to recall him&mdash;yes? Yes, monsieur. I have a message,
an urgent message from the countess. She asks that you hasten to
her at once&mdash;she is in trouble, monsieur.</p>

<p>"No, monsieur, poor François does not know. Shall I tell
madame that monsieur will be here shortly? Thank you, monsieur.
The good God will bless you." Paulvitch hung up the receiver and
turned to grin at Rokoff.</p>

<p>"It will take him thirty minutes to get there. If you reach
the German minister's in fifteen, De Coude should arrive at his
home in about forty-five minutes. It all depends upon whether the
fool will remain fifteen minutes after he finds that a trick has
been played upon him; but unless I am mistaken Olga will be loath
to let him go in so short a time as that. Here is the note for De
Coude. Hasten!"</p>

<p>Paulvitch lost no time in reaching the German minister's. At
the door he handed the note to a footman. "This is for the Count
de Coude. It is very urgent. You must see that it is placed in
his hands at once," and he dropped a piece of silver into the
willing hand of the servant. Then he returned to his
quarters.</p>

<p>A moment later De Coude was apologizing to his host as he tore
open the envelope. What he read left his face white and his hand
trembling.</p><br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Monsieur le Count de
Coude:</span></p>

<p class="letter">One who wishes to save the honor of your name
takes this means to warn you that the sanctity of your home is
this minute in jeopardy.</p>

<p class="letter">A certain man who for months has been a
constant visitor there during your absence is now with your wife.
If you go at once to your countess' boudoir you will find them
together.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">A Friend.</span></p><br>

<p>Twenty minutes after Paulvitch had called Tarzan, Rokoff
obtained a connection with Olga's private line. Her maid answered
the telephone which was in the countess' boudoir.</p>

<p>"But madame has retired," said the maid, in answer to Rokoff's
request to speak with her.</p>

<p>"This is a very urgent message for the countess' ears alone,"
replied Rokoff. "Tell her that she must arise and slip something
about her and come to the telephone. I shall call up again in
five minutes." Then he hung up his receiver. A moment later
Paulvitch entered.</p>

<p>"The count has the message?" asked Rokoff.</p>

<p>"He should be on his way to his home by now," replied
Paulvitch.</p>

<p>"Good! My lady will be sitting in her boudoir, very much in
negligee, about now. In a minute the faithful Jacques will escort
Monsieur Tarzan into her presence without announcing him. It will
take a few minutes for explanations. Olga will look very alluring
in the filmy creation that is her night-dress, and the clinging
robe which but half conceals the charms that the former does not
conceal at all. Olga will be surprised, but not displeased.</p>

<p>"If there is a drop of red blood in the man the count will
break in upon a very pretty love scene in about fifteen minutes
from now. I think we have planned marvelously, my dear Alexis.
Let us go out and drink to the very good health of Monsieur
Tarzan in some of old Plancon's unparalleled absinth; not
forgetting that the Count de Coude is one of the best swordsmen
in Paris, and by far the best shot in all France."</p>

<p>When Tarzan reached Olga's, Jacques was awaiting him at the
entrance.</p>

<p>"This way, Monsieur," he said, and led the way up the broad,
marble staircase. In another moment he had opened a door, and,
drawing aside a heavy curtain, obsequiously bowed Tarzan into a
dimly lighted apartment. Then Jacques vanished.</p>

<p>Across the room from him Tarzan saw Olga seated before a
little desk on which stood her telephone. She was tapping
impatiently upon the polished surface of the desk. She had not
heard him enter.</p>

<p>"Olga," he said, "what is wrong?"</p>

<p>She turned toward him with a little cry of alarm.</p>

<p>"Jean!" she cried. "What are you doing here? Who admitted you?
What does it mean?"</p>

<p>Tarzan was thunderstruck, but in an instant he realized a part
of the truth.</p>

<p>"Then you did not send for me, Olga?"</p>

<p>"Send for you at this time of night? <i>Mon Dieu!</i> Jean, do you
think that I am quite mad?"</p>

<p>"François telephoned me to come at once; that you were in
trouble and wanted me."</p>

<p>"François? Who in the world is François?"</p>

<p>"He said that he was in your service. He spoke as though I
should recall the fact."</p>

<p>"There is no one by that name in my employ. Some one has
played a joke upon you, Jean," and Olga laughed.</p>

<p>"I fear that it may be a most sinister 'joke,' Olga," he
replied. "There is more back of it than humor."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? You do not think that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where is the count?" he interrupted.</p>

<p>"At the German ambassador's."</p>

<p>"This is another move by your estimable brother. Tomorrow the
count will hear of it. He will question the servants. Everything
will point to&mdash;to what Rokoff wishes the count to
think."</p>

<p>"The scoundrel!" cried Olga. She had arisen, and come close to
Tarzan, where she stood looking up into his face. She was very
frightened. In her eyes was an expression that the hunter sees in
those of a poor, terrified doe&mdash;puzzled&mdash;questioning.
She trembled, and to steady herself raised her hands to his broad
shoulders. "What shall we do, Jean?" she whispered. "It is
terrible. Tomorrow all Paris will read of it&mdash;he will see to
that." Her look, her attitude, her words were eloquent of the
age-old appeal of defenseless woman to her natural
protector&mdash;man. Tarzan took one of the warm little hands
that lay on his breast in his own strong one. The act was quite
involuntary, and almost equally so was the instinct of protection
that threw a sheltering arm around the girl's shoulders.</p>

<p>The result was electrical. Never before had he been so close
to her. In startled guilt they looked suddenly into each other's
eyes, and where Olga de Coude should have been strong she was
weak, for she crept closer into the man's arms, and clasped her
own about his neck. And Tarzan of the Apes? He took the panting
figure into his mighty arms, and covered the hot lips with
kisses.</p>

<p>Raoul de Coude made hurried excuses to his host after he had
read the note handed him by the ambassador's butler. Never
afterward could he recall the nature of the excuses he made.
Everything was quite a blur to him up to the time that he stood
on the threshold of his own home. Then he became very cool,
moving quietly and with caution. For some inexplicable reason
Jacques had the door open before he was halfway to the steps. It
did not strike him at the time as being unusual, though afterward
he remarked it.</p>

<p>Very softly he tiptoed up the stairs and along the gallery to
the door of his wife's boudoir. In his hand was a heavy walking
stick&mdash;in his heart, murder.</p>

<p>Olga was the first to see him. With a horrified shriek she
tore herself from Tarzan's arms, and the ape-man turned just in
time to ward with his arm a terrific blow that De Coude had aimed
at his head. Once, twice, three times the heavy stick fell with
lightning rapidity, and each blow aided in the transition of the
ape-man back to the primordial.</p>

<p>With the low, guttural snarl of the bull ape he sprang for the
Frenchman. The great stick was torn from his grasp and broken in
two as though it had been matchwood, to be flung aside as the now
infuriated beast charged for his adversary's throat. Olga de
Coude stood a horrified spectator of the terrible scene which
ensued during the next brief moment, then she sprang to where
Tarzan was murdering her husband&mdash;choking the life from
him&mdash;shaking him as a terrier might shake a rat.</p>

<p>Frantically she tore at his great hands. "Mother of God!" she
cried. "You are killing him, you are killing him! Oh, Jean, you
are killing my husband!" Tarzan was deaf with rage. Suddenly he
hurled the body to the floor, and, placing his foot upon the
upturned breast, raised his head.</p>

<p>Then through the palace of the Count de Coude rang the awesome
challenge of the bull ape that has made a kill. From cellar to
attic the horrid sound searched out the servants, and left them
blanched and trembling. The woman in the room sank to her knees
beside the body of her husband, and prayed.</p>

<p>Slowly the red mist faded from before Tarzan's eyes. Things
began to take form&mdash;he was regaining the perspective of
civilized man.</p>

<p>His eyes fell upon the figure of the kneeling woman. "Olga,"
he whispered. She looked up, expecting to see the maniacal light
of murder in the eyes above her. Instead she saw sorrow and
contrition.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jean!" she cried. "See what you have done. He was my
husband. I loved him, and you have killed him."</p>

<p>Very gently Tarzan raised the limp form of the Count de Coude
and bore it to a couch. Then he put his ear to the man's
breast.</p>

<p>"Some brandy, Olga," he said.</p>

<p>She brought it, and together they forced it between his
lips.</p>

<p>Presently a faint gasp came from the white lips. The head
turned, and De Coude groaned.</p>

<p>"He will not die," said Tarzan. "Thank God!"</p>

<p>"Why did you do it, Jean?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I do not know. He struck me, and I went mad. I have seen the
apes of my tribe do the same thing. I have never told you my
story, Olga. It would have been better had you known
it&mdash;this might not have happened. I never saw my father. The
only mother I knew was a ferocious she-ape. Until I was fifteen I
had never seen a human being. I was twenty before I saw a white
man. A little more than a year ago I was a naked beast of prey in
an African jungle.</p>

<p>"Do not judge me too harshly. Two years is too short a time in
which to attempt to work the change in an individual that it has
taken countless ages to accomplish in the white race."</p>

<p>"I do not judge at all, Jean. The fault is mine. You must go
now&mdash;he must not find you here when he regains
consciousness. Good-by." It was a sorrowful Tarzan who walked
with bowed head from the palace of the Count de Coude.</p>

<p>Once outside his thoughts took definite shape, to the end that
twenty minutes later he entered a police station not far from the
Rue Maule. Here he soon found one of the officers with whom he
had had the encounter several weeks previous. The policeman was
genuinely glad to see again the man who had so roughly handled
him.</p>

<p>After a moment of conversation Tarzan asked if he had ever
heard of Nikolas Rokoff or Alexis Paulvitch.</p>

<p>"Very often, indeed, monsieur. Each has a police record, and
while there is nothing charged against them now, we make it a
point to know pretty well where they may be found should the
occasion demand. It is only the same precaution that we take with
every known criminal. Why does monsieur ask?"</p>

<p>"They are known to me," replied Tarzan. "I wish to see
Monsieur Rokoff on a little matter of business. If you can direct
me to his lodgings I shall appreciate it."</p>

<p>A few minutes later he bade the policeman adieu, and, with a
slip of paper in his pocket bearing a certain address in a semi-
respectable quarter, he walked briskly toward the nearest taxi
stand.</p>

<p>Rokoff and Paulvitch had returned to their rooms, and were
sitting talking over the probable outcome of the evening's
events. They had telephoned to the offices of two of the morning
papers from which they momentarily expected representatives to
hear the first report of the scandal that was to stir social
Paris on the morrow.</p>

<p>A heavy step sounded on the stairway.<p>

<p>"Ah, but these newspaper men are prompt," exclaimed Rokoff,
and as a knock fell upon the door of their room: "Enter,
monsieur." The smile of welcome froze upon the Russian's face as
he looked into the hard, gray eyes of his visitor.</p>

<p>"Name of a name!" he shouted, springing to his feet, "What
brings you here!"</p>

<p>"Sit down!" said Tarzan, so low that the men could barely
catch the words, but in a tone that brought Rokoff to his chair,
and kept Paulvitch in his.</p>

<p>"You know what has brought me here," he continued, in the same
low tone. "It should be to kill you, but because you are Olga de
Coude's brother I shall not do that&mdash;now.</p>

<p>"I shall give you a chance for your lives. Paulvitch does not
count much&mdash;he is merely a stupid, foolish little tool, and
so I shall not kill him so long as I permit you to live. Before I
leave you two alive in this room you will have done two things.
The first will be to write a full confession of your connection
with tonight's plot&mdash;and sign it.</p>

<p>"The second will be to promise me upon pain of death that you
will permit no word of this affair to get into the newspapers. If
you do not do both, neither of you will be alive when I pass next
through that doorway. Do you understand?" And, without waiting
for a reply: "Make haste; there is ink before you, and paper and
a pen." Rokoff assumed a truculent air, attempting by bravado to
show how little he feared Tarzan's threats. An instant later he
felt the ape-man's steel fingers at his throat, and Paulvitch,
who attempted to dodge them and reach the door, was lifted
completely off the floor, and hurled senseless into a corner.
When Rokoff commenced to blacken about the face Tarzan released
his hold and shoved the fellow back into his chair. After a
moment of coughing Rokoff sat sullenly glaring at the man
standing opposite him. Presently Paulvitch came to himself, and
limped painfully back to his chair at Tarzan's command.</p>

<p>"Now write," said the ape-man. "If it is necessary to handle
you again I shall not be so lenient." Rokoff picked up a pen and
commenced to write.</p>

<p>"See that you omit no detail, and that you mention every
name," cautioned Tarzan.</p>

<p>Presently there was a knock at the door. "Enter," said
Tarzan.</p>

<p>A dapper young man came in. "I am from the Matin," he
announced. "I understand that Monsieur Rokoff has a story for
me."</p>

<p>"Then you are mistaken, monsieur," replied Tarzan. "You have
no story for publication, have you, my dear Nikolas." Rokoff
looked up from his writing with an ugly scowl upon his face.</p>

<p>"No," he growled, "I have no story for
publication&mdash;now."</p>

<p>"Nor ever, my dear Nikolas," and the reporter did not see the
nasty light in the ape-man's eye; but Nikolas Rokoff did.</p>

<p>"Nor ever," he repeated hastily.</p>

<p>"It is too bad that monsieur has been troubled," said Tarzan,
turning to the newspaper man. "I bid monsieur good evening," and
he bowed the dapper young man out of the room, and closed the
door in his face.</p>

<p>An hour later Tarzan, with a rather bulky manuscript in his
coat pocket, turned at the door leading from Rokoff's room.</p>

<p>"Were I you I should leave France," he said, "for sooner or
later I shall find an excuse to kill you that will not in any way
compromise your sister."</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap6" id="chap6">VI. &mdash; A DUEL</a></h2>

<div align="center"> <img src="fr100053-images/TheReturnOfTarzan-06.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration"> </div><br>

<p class="first">D'Arnot was asleep when Tarzan entered their
apartments after leaving Rokoff's. Tarzan did not disturb him,
but the following morning he narrated the happenings of the
previous evening, omitting not a single detail.</p>

<p>"What a fool I have been," he concluded. "De Coude and his
wife were both my friends. How have I returned their friendship?
Barely did I escape murdering the count. I have cast a stigma on
the name of a good woman. It is very probable that I have broken
up a happy home."</p>

<p>"Do you love Olga de Coude?" asked D'Arnot.</p>

<p>"Were I not positive that she does not love me I could not
answer your question, Paul; but without disloyalty to her I tell
you that I do not love her, nor does she love me. For an instant
we were the victims of a sudden madness&mdash;it was not
love&mdash;and it would have left us, unharmed, as suddenly as it
had come upon us even though De Coude had not returned. As you
know, I have had little experience of women. Olga de Coude is
very beautiful; that, and the dim light and the seductive
surroundings, and the appeal of the defenseless for protection,
might have been resisted by a more civilized man, but my
civilization is not even skin deep&mdash;it does not go deeper
than my clothes.</p>

<p>"Paris is no place for me. I will but continue to stumble into
more and more serious pitfalls. The man-made restrictions are
irksome. I feel always that I am a prisoner. I cannot endure it,
my friend, and so I think that I shall go back to my own jungle,
and lead the life that God intended that I should lead when He
put me there."</p>

<p>"Do not take it so to heart, Jean," responded D'Arnot. "You
have acquitted yourself much better than most 'civilized' men
would have under similar circumstances. As to leaving Paris at
this time, I rather think that Raoul de Coude may be expected to
have something to say on that subject before long."</p>

<p>Nor was D'Arnot mistaken. A week later on Monsieur Flaubert
was announced about eleven in the morning, as D'Arnot and Tarzan
were breakfasting. Monsieur Flaubert was an impressively polite
gentleman. With many low bows he delivered Monsieur le Count de
Coude's challenge to Monsieur Tarzan. Would monsieur be so very
kind as to arrange to have a friend meet Monsieur Flaubert at as
early an hour as convenient, that the details might be arranged
to the mutual satisfaction of all concerned? Certainly. Monsieur
Tarzan would be delighted to place his interests unreservedly in
the hands of his friend, Lieutenant D'Arnot. And so it was
arranged that D'Arnot was to call on Monsieur Flaubert at two
that afternoon, and the polite Monsieur Flaubert, with many bows,
left them.</p>

<p>When they were again alone D'Arnot looked quizzically at
Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said.</p>

<p>"Now to my sins I must add murder, or else myself be killed,"
said Tarzan. "I am progressing rapidly in the ways of my
civilized brothers."</p>

<p>"What weapons shall you select?" asked D'Arnot. "De Coude is
accredited with being a master with the sword, and a splendid
shot."</p>

<p>"I might then choose poisoned arrows at twenty paces, or
spears at the same distance," laughed Tarzan. "Make it pistols,
Paul."</p>

<p>"He will kill you, Jean."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt of it," replied Tarzan. "I must die some
day."</p>

<p>"We had better make it swords," said D'Arnot. "He will be
satisfied with wounding you, and there is less danger of a mortal
wound."</p>

<p>"Pistols," said Tarzan, with finality.</p>

<p>D'Arnot tried to argue him out of it, but without avail, so
pistols it was.</p>

<p>D'Arnot returned from his conference with Monsieur Flaubert
shortly after four.</p>

<p>"It is all arranged," he said. "Everything is satisfactory.
Tomorrow morning at daylight&mdash;there is a secluded spot on
the road not far from Étamps. For some personal reason Monsieur
Flaubert preferred it. I did not demur."</p>

<p>"Good!" was Tarzan's only comment. He did not refer to the
matter again even indirectly. That night he wrote several letters
before he retired. After sealing and addressing them he placed
them all in an envelope addressed to D'Arnot. As he undressed
D'Arnot heard him humming a music-hall ditty.</p>

<p>The Frenchman swore under his breath. He was very unhappy, for
he was positive that when the sun rose the next morning it would
look down upon a dead Tarzan. It grated upon him to see Tarzan so
unconcerned.</p>

<p>"This is a most uncivilized hour for people to kill each
other," remarked the ape-man when he had been routed out of a
comfortable bed in the blackness of the early morning hours. He
had slept well, and so it seemed that his head scarcely touched
the pillow ere his man deferentially aroused him. His remark was
addressed to D'Arnot, who stood fully dressed in the doorway of
Tarzan's bedroom.</p>

<p>D'Arnot had scarcely slept at all during the night. He was
nervous, and therefore inclined to be irritable.</p>

<p>"I presume you slept like a baby all night," he said.</p>

<p>Tarzan laughed. "From your tone, Paul, I infer that you rather
harbor the fact against me. I could not help it, really."</p>

<p>"No, Jean; it is not that," replied D'Arnot, himself smiling.
"But you take the entire matter with such infernal
indifference&mdash;it is exasperating. One would think that you
were going out to shoot at a target, rather than to face one of
the best shots in France."</p>

<p>Tarzan shrugged his shoulders. "I am going out to expiate a
great wrong, Paul. A very necessary feature of the expiation is
the marksmanship of my opponent. Wherefore, then, should I be
dissatisfied? Have you not yourself told me that Count de Coude
is a splendid marksman?"</p>

<p>"You mean that you hope to be killed?" exclaimed D'Arnot, in
horror.</p>

<p>"I cannot say that I hope to be, but you must admit that there
is little reason to believe that I shall not be killed."</p>

<p>Had D'Arnot known the thing that was in the ape-man's
mind&mdash;that had been in his mind almost from the first
intimation that De Coude would call him to account on the field
of honor&mdash;he would have been even more horrified than he
was.</p>

<p>In silence they entered D'Arnot's great car, and in similar
silence they sped over the dim road that leads to Étamps. Each
man was occupied with his own thoughts. D'Arnot's were very
mournful, for he was genuinely fond of Tarzan. The great
friendship which had sprung up between these two men whose lives
and training had been so widely different had but been
strengthened by association, for they were both men to whom the
same high ideals of manhood, of personal courage, and of honor
appealed with equal force. They could understand one another, and
each could be proud of the friendship of the other.</p>

<p>Tarzan of the Apes was wrapped in thoughts of the past;
pleasant memories of the happier occasions of his lost jungle
life. He recalled the countless boyhood hours that he had spent
cross-legged upon the table in his dead father's cabin, his
little brown body bent over one of the fascinating picture books
from which, unaided, he had gleaned the secret of the printed
language long before the sounds of human speech fell upon his
ears. A smile of contentment softened his strong face as he
thought of that day of days that he had had alone with Jane
Porter in the heart of his primeval forest.</p>

<p>Presently his reminiscences were broken in upon by the
stopping of the car&mdash;they were at their destination.
Tarzan's mind returned to the affairs of the moment. He knew that
he was about to die, but there was no fear of death in him. To a
denizen of the cruel jungle, death is a commonplace. The first
law of nature compels them to cling tenaciously to life&mdash;to
fight for it; but it does not teach them to fear death.</p>

<p>D'Arnot and Tarzan were first upon the field of honor. A
moment later De Coude, Monsieur Flaubert, and a third gentleman
arrived.</p>

<p>The last was introduced to D'Arnot and Tarzan; he was a
physician.</p>

<p>D'Arnot and Monsieur Flaubert spoke together in whispers for a
brief time. The Count de Coude and Tarzan stood apart at opposite
sides of the field. Presently the seconds summoned them. D'Arnot
and Monsieur Flaubert had examined both pistols. The two men who
were to face each other a moment later stood silently while
Monsieur Flaubert recited the conditions they were to
observe.</p>

<p>They were to stand back to back. At a signal from Monsieur
Flaubert they were to walk in opposite directions, their pistols
hanging by their sides. When each had proceeded ten paces D'Arnot
was to give the final signal&mdash;then they were to turn and
fire at will until one fell, or each had expended the three shots
allowed.</p>

<p>While Monsieur Flaubert spoke Tarzan selected a cigarette from
his case, and lighted it. De Coude was the personification of
coolness&mdash;was he not the best shot in France? Presently
Monsieur Flaubert nodded to D'Arnot, and each man placed his
principal in position.</p>

<p>"Are you quite ready, gentlemen?" asked Monsieur Flaubert.</p>

<p>"Quite," replied De Coude.</p>

<p>Tarzan nodded. Monsieur Flaubert gave the signal. He and
D'Arnot stepped back a few paces to be out of the line of fire as
the men paced slowly apart. Six! Seven! Eight! There were tears
in D'Arnot's eyes. He loved Tarzan very much. Nine! Another pace,
and the poor lieutenant gave the signal he so hated to give. To
him it sounded the doom of his best friend.</p>

<p>Quickly De Coude wheeled and fired. Tarzan gave a little
start.</p>

<p>His pistol still dangled at his side. De Coude hesitated, as
though waiting to see his antagonist crumple to the ground. The
Frenchman was too experienced a marksman not to know that he had
scored a hit. Still Tarzan made no move to raise his pistol. De
Coude fired once more, but the attitude of the ape-man&mdash;the
utter indifference that was so apparent in every line of the
nonchalant ease of his giant figure, and the even unruffled
puffing of his cigarette&mdash;had disconcerted the best marksman
in France. This time Tarzan did not start, but again De Coude
knew that he had hit.</p>

<p>Suddenly the explanation leaped to his mind&mdash;his
antagonist was coolly taking these terrible chances in the hope
that he would receive no staggering wound from any of De Coude's
three shots.</p>

<p>Then he would take his own time about shooting De Coude down
deliberately, coolly, and in cold blood. A little shiver ran up
the Frenchman's spine. It was fiendish&mdash;diabolical. What
manner of creature was this that could stand complacently with
two bullets in him, waiting for the third? And so De Coude took
careful aim this time, but his nerve was gone, and he made a
clean miss. Not once had Tarzan raised his pistol hand from where
it hung beside his leg.</p>

<p>For a moment the two stood looking straight into each other's
eyes.</p>

<p>On Tarzan's face was a pathetic expression of disappointment.
On De Coude's a rapidly growing expression of horror&mdash;yes,
of terror.</p>

<p>He could endure it no longer.</p>

<p>"Mother of God! Monsieur&mdash;shoot!" he screamed.</p>

<p>But Tarzan did not raise his pistol. Instead, he advanced
toward De Coude, and when D'Arnot and Monsieur Flaubert,
misinterpreting his intention, would have rushed between them, he
raised his left hand in a sign of remonstrance.</p>

<p>"Do not fear," he said to them, "I shall not harm him." It was
most unusual, but they halted. Tarzan advanced until he was quite
close to De Coude.</p>

<p>"There must have been something wrong with monsieur's pistol,"
he said. "Or monsieur is unstrung. Take mine, monsieur, and try
again," and Tarzan offered his pistol, butt foremost, to the
astonished De Coude.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>, monsieur!" cried the latter. "Are you
mad?"</p>

<p>"No, my friend," replied the ape-man; "but I deserve to die.
It is the only way in which I may atone for the wrong I have done
a very good woman. Take my pistol and do as I bid."</p>

<p>"It would be murder," replied De Coude. "But what wrong did
you do my wife? She swore to me that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do not mean that," said Tarzan quickly. "You saw all the
wrong that passed between us. But that was enough to cast a
shadow upon her name, and to ruin the happiness of a man against
whom I had no enmity. The fault was all mine, and so I hoped to
die for it this morning. I am disappointed that monsieur is not
so wonderful a marksman as I had been led to believe."</p>

<p>"You say that the fault was all yours?" asked De Coude
eagerly.</p>

<p>"All mine, monsieur. Your wife is a very pure woman. She loves
only you. The fault that you saw was all mine. The thing that
brought me there was no fault of either the Countess de Coude or
myself. Here is a paper which will quite positively demonstrate
that," and Tarzan drew from his pocket the statement Rokoff had
written and signed.</p>

<p>De Coude took it and read. D'Arnot and Monsieur Flaubert had
drawn near. They were interested spectators of this strange
ending of a strange duel. None spoke until De Coude had quite
finished, then he looked up at Tarzan.</p>

<p>"You are a very brave and chivalrous gentleman," he said. "I
thank God that I did not kill you." De Coude was a Frenchman.
Frenchmen are impulsive. He threw his arms about Tarzan and
embraced him. Monsieur Flaubert embraced D'Arnot. There was no
one to embrace the doctor. So possibly it was pique which
prompted him to interfere, and demand that he be permitted to
dress Tarzan's wounds.</p>

<p>"This gentleman was hit once at least," he said. "Possibly
thrice."</p>

<p>"Twice," said Tarzan. "Once in the left shoulder, and again in
the left side&mdash;both flesh wounds, I think."</p>

<p>But the doctor insisted upon stretching him upon the sward,
and tinkering with him until the wounds were cleansed and the
flow of blood checked.</p>

<p>One result of the duel was that they all rode back to Paris
together in D'Arnot's car, the best of friends. De Coude was so
relieved to have had this double assurance of his wife's loyalty
that he felt no rancor at all toward Tarzan. It is true that the
latter had assumed much more of the fault than was rightly his,
but if he lied a little he may be excused, for he lied in the
service of a woman, and he lied like a gentleman.</p>

<p>The ape-man was confined to his bed for several days. He felt
that it was foolish and unnecessary, but the doctor and D'Arnot
took the matter so to heart that he gave in to please them,
though it made him laugh to think of it.</p>

<p>"It is droll," he said to D'Arnot. "To lie abed because of a
pin prick! Why, when Bolgani, the king gorilla, tore me almost to
pieces, while I was still but a little boy, did I have a nice
soft bed to lie on? No, only the damp, rotting vegetation of the
jungle. Hidden beneath some friendly bush I lay for days and
weeks with only Kala to nurse me&mdash;poor, faithful Kala, who
kept the insects from my wounds and warned off the beasts of
prey.</p>

<p>"When I called for water she brought it to me in her own
mouth&mdash;the only way she knew to carry it. There was no
sterilized gauze, there was no antiseptic bandage&mdash;there was
nothing that would not have driven our dear doctor mad to have
seen. Yet I recovered&mdash;recovered to lie in bed because of a
tiny scratch that one of the jungle folk would scarce realize
unless it were upon the end of his nose."</p>

<p>But the time was soon over, and before he realized it Tarzan
found himself abroad again. Several times De Coude had called,
and when he found that Tarzan was anxious for employment of some
nature he promised to see what could be done to find a berth for
him.</p>

<p>It was the first day that Tarzan was permitted to go out that
he received a message from De Coude requesting him to call at the
count's office that afternoon.</p>

<p>He found De Coude awaiting him with a very pleasant welcome,
and a sincere congratulation that he was once more upon his feet.
Neither had ever mentioned the duel or the cause of it since that
morning upon the field of honor.</p>

<p>"I think that I have found just the thing for you, Monsieur
Tarzan," said the count. "It is a position of much trust and
responsibility, which also requires considerably physical courage
and prowess. I cannot imagine a man better fitted than you, my
dear Monsieur Tarzan, for this very position. It will necessitate
travel, and later it may lead to a very much better
post&mdash;possibly in the diplomatic service.</p>

<p>"At first, for a short time only, you will be a special agent
in the service of the ministry of war. Come, I will take you to
the gentleman who will be your chief. He can explain the duties
better than I, and then you will be in a position to judge if you
wish to accept or no." De Coude himself escorted Tarzan to the
office of General Rochère, the chief of the bureau to which
Tarzan would be attached if he accepted the position. There the
count left him, after a glowing description to the general of the
many attributes possessed by the ape-man which should fit him for
the work of the service.</p>

<p>A half hour later Tarzan walked out of the office the
possessor of the first position he had ever held. On the morrow
he was to return for further instructions, though General Rochère
had made it quite plain that Tarzan might prepare to leave Paris
for an almost indefinite period, possibly on the morrow.</p>

<p>It was with feelings of the keenest elation that he hastened
home to bear the good news to D'Arnot. At last he was to be of
some value in the world. He was to earn money, and, best of all,
to travel and see the world.</p>

<p>He could scarcely wait to get well inside D'Arnot's sitting
room before he burst out with the glad tidings. D'Arnot was not
so pleased.</p>

<p>"It seems to delight you to think that you are to leave Paris,
and that we shall not see each other for months, perhaps. Tarzan,
you are a most ungrateful beast!" and D'Arnot laughed.</p>

<p>"No, Paul; I am a little child. I have a new toy, and I am
tickled to death." And so it came that on the following day
Tarzan left Paris en route for Marseilles and Oran.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap7" id="chap7">VII. &mdash; THE DANCING GIRL OF
SIDI AISSA</a></h2>

<div align="center"> <img src="fr100053-images/TheReturnOfTarzan-07.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration"> </div><br>

<p class="first">Tarzan's first mission did not bid fair to be
either exciting or vastly important. There was a certain
lieutenant of Spahis whom the government had reason to suspect of
improper relations with a great European power. This Lieutenant
Gernois, who was at present stationed at Sidi-bel-Abbes, had
recently been attached to the general staff, where certain
information of great military value had come into his possession
in the ordinary routine of his duties. It was this information
which the government suspected the great power was bartering for
with the officer.</p>

<p>It was at most but a vague hint dropped by a certain notorious
Parisienne in a jealous mood that had caused suspicion to rest
upon the lieutenant. But general staffs are jealous of their
secrets, and treason so serious a thing that even a hint of it
may not be safely neglected. And so it was that Tarzan had come
to Algeria in the guise of an American hunter and traveler to
keep a close eye upon Lieutenant Gernois.</p>

<p>He had looked forward with keen delight to again seeing his
beloved Africa, but this northern aspect of it was so different
from his tropical jungle home that he might as well have been
back in Paris for all the heart-felt thrills of homecoming that
he experienced. At Oran he spent a day wandering through the
narrow, crooked alleys of the Arab quarter enjoying the strange,
new sights. The next day found him at Sidi-bel-Abbes, where he
presented his letters of introduction to both civil and military
authorities&mdash;letters which gave no clew to the real
significance of his mission.</p>

<p>Tarzan possessed a sufficient command of English to enable him
to pass among Arabs and Frenchmen as an American, and that was
all that was required of it. When he met an Englishman he spoke
French in order that he might not betray himself, but
occasionally talked in English to foreigners who understood that
tongue, but could not note the slight imperfections of accent and
pronunciation that were his.</p>

<p>Here he became acquainted with many of the French officers,
and soon became a favorite among them. He met Gernois, whom he
found to be a taciturn, dyspeptic-looking man of about forty,
having little or no social intercourse with his fellows.</p>

<p>For a month nothing of moment occurred. Gernois apparently had
no visitors, nor did he on his occasional visits to the town hold
communication with any who might even by the wildest flight of
imagination be construed into secret agents of a foreign
power.</p>

<p>Tarzan was beginning to hope that, after all, the rumor might
have been false, when suddenly Gernois was ordered to Bou Saada
in the Petit Sahara far to the south.</p>

<p>A company of <i>spahis</i> and three officers were to relieve
another company already stationed there. Fortunately one of the
officers, Captain Gérard, had become an excellent friend of
Tarzan's, and so when the ape-man suggested that he should
embrace the opportunity of accompanying him to Bou Saada, where
he expected to find hunting, it caused not the slightest
suspicion.</p>

<p>At Bouira the detachment detrained, and the balance of the
journey was made in the saddle. As Tarzan was dickering at Bouira
for a mount he caught a brief glimpse of a man in European
clothes eying him from the doorway of a native coffeehouse, but
as Tarzan looked the man turned and entered the little, low-
ceilinged mud hut, and but for a haunting impression that there
had been something familiar about the face or figure of the
fellow, Tarzan gave the matter no further thought.</p>

<p>The march to Aumale was fatiguing to Tarzan, whose equestrian
experiences hitherto had been confined to a course of riding
lessons in a Parisian academy, and so it was that he quickly
sought the comforts of a bed in the Hotel Grossat, while the
officers and troops took up their quarters at the military
post.</p>

<p>Although Tarzan was called early the following morning, the
company of <i>spahis</i> was on the march before he had finished
his breakfast. He was hurrying through his meal that the soldiers
might not get too far in advance of him when he glanced through
the door connecting the dining room with the bar.</p>

<p>To his surprise, he saw Gernois standing there in conversation
with the very stranger he had seen in the coffee-house at Bouira
the day previous. He could not be mistaken, for there was the
same strangely familiar attitude and figure, though the man's
back was toward him.</p>

<p>As his eyes lingered on the two, Gernois looked up and caught
the intent expression on Tarzan's face. The stranger was talking
in a low whisper at the time, but the French officer immediately
interrupted him, and the two at once turned away and passed out
of the range of Tarzan's vision.</p>

<p>This was the first suspicious occurrence that Tarzan had ever
witnessed in connection with Gernois' actions, but he was
positive that the men had left the barroom solely because Gernois
had caught Tarzan's eyes upon them; then there was the persistent
impression of familiarity about the stranger to further augment
the ape-man's belief that here at last was something which would
bear watching.</p>

<p>A moment later Tarzan entered the barroom, but the men had
left, nor did he see aught of them in the street beyond, though
he found a pretext to ride to various shops before he set out
after the column which had now considerable start of him. He did
not overtake them until he reached Sidi Aissa shortly after noon,
where the soldiers had halted for an hour's rest. Here he found
Gernois with the column, but there was no sign of the
stranger.</p>

<p>It was market day at Sidi Aissa, and the numberless caravans
of camels coming in from the desert, and the crowds of bickering
Arabs in the market place, filled Tarzan with a consuming desire
to remain for a day that he might see more of these sons of the
desert. Thus it was that the company of <i>spahis</i> marched on
that afternoon toward Bou Saada without him. He spent the hours
until dark wandering about the market in company with a youthful
Arab, one Abdul, who had been recommended to him by the innkeeper
as a trustworthy servant and interpreter.</p>

<p>Here Tarzan purchased a better mount than the one he had
selected at Bouira, and, entering into conversation with the
stately Arab to whom the animal had belonged, learned that the
seller was Kadour ben Saden, sheik of a desert tribe far south of
Djelfa. Through Abdul, Tarzan invited his new acquaintance to
dine with him. As the three were making their way through the
crowds of marketers, camels, donkeys, and horses that filled the
market place with a confusing babel of sounds, Abdul plucked at
Tarzan's sleeve.</p>

<p>"Look, master, behind us," and he turned, pointing at a figure
which disappeared behind a camel as Tarzan turned. "He has been
following us about all afternoon," continued Abdul.</p>

<p>"I caught only a glimpse of an Arab in a dark-blue burnoose
and white turban," replied Tarzan. "Is it he you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I suspected him because he seems a stranger here,
without other business than following us, which is not the way of
the Arab who is honest, and also because he keeps the lower part
of his face hidden, only his eyes showing. He must be a bad man,
or he would have honest business of his own to occupy his
time."</p>

<p>"He is on the wrong scent then, Abdul," replied Tarzan, "for
no one here can have any grievance against me. This is my first
visit to your country, and none knows me. He will soon discover
his error, and cease to follow us."</p>

<p>"Unless he be bent on robbery," returned Abdul.</p>

<p>"Then all we can do is wait until he is ready to try his hand
upon us," laughed Tarzan, "and I warrant that he will get his
bellyful of robbing now that we are prepared for him," and so he
dismissed the subject from his mind, though he was destined to
recall it before many hours through a most unlooked-for
occurrence.</p>

<p>Kadour ben Saden, having dined well, prepared to take leave of
his host. With dignified protestations of friendship, he invited
Tarzan to visit him in his wild domain, where the antelope, the
stag, the boar, the panther, and the lion might still be found in
sufficient numbers to tempt an ardent huntsman.</p>

<p>On his departure the ape-man, with Abdul, wandered again into
the streets of Sidi Aissa, where he was soon attracted by the
wild din of sound coming from the open doorway of one of the
numerous cafés maures. It was after eight, and the dancing was in
full swing as Tarzan entered. The room was filled to repletion
with Arabs. All were smoking, and drinking their thick, hot
coffee.</p>

<p>Tarzan and Abdul found seats near the center of the room,
though the terrific noise produced by the musicians upon their
Arab drums and pipes would have rendered a seat farther from them
more acceptable to the quiet-loving ape-man. A rather good-
looking Ouled-Nail was dancing, and, perceiving Tarzan's European
clothes, and scenting a generous gratuity, she threw her silken
handkerchief upon his shoulder, to be rewarded with a franc.</p>

<p>When her place upon the floor had been taken by another the
bright-eyed Abdul saw her in conversation with two Arabs at the
far side of the room, near a side door that let upon an inner
court, around the gallery of which were the rooms occupied by the
girls who danced in this cafe.</p>

<p>At first he thought nothing of the matter, but presently he
noticed from the corner of his eye one of the men nod in their
direction, and the girl turn and shoot a furtive glance at
Tarzan. Then the Arabs melted through the doorway into the
darkness of the court.</p>

<p>When it came again the girl's turn to dance she hovered close
to Tarzan, and for the ape-man alone were her sweetest smiles.
Many an ugly scowl was cast upon the tall European by swarthy,
dark-eyed sons of the desert, but neither smiles nor scowls
produced any outwardly visible effect upon him. Again the girl
cast her handkerchief upon his shoulder, and again was she
rewarded with a franc piece. As she was sticking it upon her
forehead, after the custom of her kind, she bent low toward
Tarzan, whispering a quick word in his ear.</p>

<p>"There are two without in the court," she said quickly, in
broken French, "who would harm m'sieur. At first I promised to
lure you to them, but you have been kind, and I cannot do it. Go
quickly, before they find that I have failed them. I think that
they are very bad men." Tarzan thanked the girl, assuring her
that he would be careful, and, having finished her dance, she
crossed to the little doorway and went out into the court. But
Tarzan did not leave the cafe as she had urged.</p>

<p>For another half hour nothing unusual occurred, then a surly-
looking Arab entered the cafe from the street. He stood near
Tarzan, where he deliberately made insulting remarks about the
European, but as they were in his native tongue Tarzan was
entirely innocent of their purport until Abdul took it upon
himself to enlighten him.</p>

<p>"This fellow is looking for trouble," warned Abdul. "He is not
alone. In fact, in case of a disturbance, nearly every man here
would be against you. It would be better to leave quietly,
master."</p>

<p>"Ask the fellow what he wants," commanded Tarzan.</p>

<p>"He says that 'the dog of a Christian' insulted the Ouled-
Nail, who belongs to him. He means trouble, m'sieur."</p>

<p>"Tell him that I did not insult his or any other Ouled-Nail,
that I wish him to go away and leave me alone. That I have no
quarrel with him, nor has he any with me."</p>

<p>"He says," replied Abdul, after delivering this message to the
Arab, "that besides being a dog yourself that you are the son of
one, and that your grandmother was a hyena. Incidentally you are
a liar." The attention of those near by had now been attracted by
the altercation, and the sneering laughs that followed this
torrent of invective easily indicated the trend of the sympathies
of the majority of the audience.</p>

<p>Tarzan did not like being laughed at, neither did he relish
the terms applied to him by the Arab, but he showed no sign of
anger as he arose from his seat upon the bench. A half smile
played about his lips, but of a sudden a mighty fist shot into
the face of the scowling Arab, and back of it were the terrible
muscles of the ape-man.</p>

<p>At the instant that the man fell a half dozen fierce plainsmen
sprang into the room from where they had apparently been waiting
for their cue in the street before the cafe. With cries of "Kill
the unbeliever!" and "Down with the dog of a Christian!" they
made straight for Tarzan. A number of the younger Arabs in the
audience sprang to their feet to join in the assault upon the
unarmed white man. Tarzan and Abdul were rushed back toward the
end of the room by the very force of numbers opposing them. The
young Arab remained loyal to his master, and with drawn knife
fought at his side.</p>

<p>With tremendous blows the ape-man felled all who came within
reach of his powerful hands. He fought quietly and without a
word, upon his lips the same half smile they had worn as he rose
to strike down the man who had insulted him. It seemed impossible
that either he or Abdul could survive the sea of wicked-looking
swords and knives that surrounded them, but the very numbers of
their assailants proved the best bulwark of their safety. So
closely packed was the howling, cursing mob that no weapon could
be wielded to advantage, and none of the Arabs dared use a
firearm for fear of wounding one of his compatriots.</p>

<p>Finally Tarzan succeeded in seizing one of the most persistent
of his attackers. With a quick wrench he disarmed the fellow, and
then, holding him before them as a shield, he backed slowly
beside Abdul toward the little door which led into the inner
courtyard. At the threshold he paused for an instant, and,
lifting the struggling Arab above his head, hurled him, as though
from a catapult, full in the faces of his on-pressing
fellows.</p>

<p>Then Tarzan and Abdul stepped into the semidarkness of the
court.</p>

<p>The frightened Ouled-Nails were crouching at the tops of the
stairs which led to their respective rooms, the only light in the
courtyard coming from the sickly candles which each girl had
stuck with its own grease to the woodwork of her door-frame, the
better to display her charms to those who might happen to
traverse the dark inclosure.</p>

<p>Scarcely had Tarzan and Abdul emerged from the room ere a
revolver spoke close at their backs from the shadows beneath one
of the stairways, and as they turned to meet this new antagonist,
two muffled figures sprang toward them, firing as they came.
Tarzan leaped to meet these two new assailants. The foremost lay,
a second later, in the trampled dirt of the court, disarmed and
groaning from a broken wrist. Abdul's knife found the vitals of
the second in the instant that the fellow's revolver misfired as
he held it to the faithful Arab's forehead.</p>

<p>The maddened horde within the cafe were now rushing out in
pursuit of their quarry. The Ouled-Nails had extinguished their
candles at a cry from one of their number, and the only light
within the yard came feebly from the open and half-blocked door
of the cafe.</p>

<p>Tarzan had seized a sword from the man who had fallen before
Abdul's knife, and now he stood waiting for the rush of men that
was coming in search of them through the darkness.</p>

<p>Suddenly he felt a light hand upon his shoulder from behind,
and a woman's voice whispering, "Quick, m'sieur; this way. Follow
me."</p>

<p>"Come, Abdul," said Tarzan, in a low tone, to the youth; "we
can be no worse off elsewhere than we are here." The woman turned
and led them up the narrow stairway that ended at the door of her
quarters. Tarzan was close beside her. He saw the gold and silver
bracelets upon her bare arms, the strings of gold coin that
depended from her hair ornaments, and the gorgeous colors of her
dress. He saw that she was a Ouled-Nail, and instinctively he
knew that she was the same who had whispered the warning in his
ear earlier in the evening.</p>

<p>As they reached the top of the stairs they could hear the
angry crowd searching the yard beneath.</p>

<p>"Soon they will search here," whispered the girl. "They must
not find you, for, though you fight with the strength of many
men, they will kill you in the end. Hasten; you can drop from the
farther window of my room to the street beyond. Before they
discover that you are no longer in the court of the buildings you
will be safe within the hotel." But even as she spoke, several
men had started up the stairway at the head of which they stood.
There was a sudden cry from one of the searchers. They had been
discovered. Quickly the crowd rushed for the stairway. The
foremost assailant leaped quickly upward, but at the top he met
the sudden sword that he had not expected&mdash;the quarry had
been unarmed before.</p>

<p>With a cry, the man toppled back upon those behind him. Like
tenpins they rolled down the stairs. The ancient and rickety
structure could not withstand the strain of this unwonted weight
and jarring.</p>

<p>With a creaking and rending of breaking wood it collapsed
beneath the Arabs, leaving Tarzan, Abdul, and the girl alone upon
the frail platform at the top.</p>

<p>"Come!" cried the Ouled-Nail. "They will reach us from another
stairway through the room next to mine. We have not a moment to
spare." Just as they were entering the room Abdul heard and
translated a cry from the yard below for several to hasten to the
street and cut off escape from that side.</p>

<p>"We are lost now," said the girl simply.</p>

<p>"We?" questioned Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Yes, m'sieur," she responded; "they will kill me as well.
Have I not aided you?" This put a different aspect on the matter.
Tarzan had rather been enjoying the excitement and danger of the
encounter. He had not for an instant supposed that either Abdul
or the girl could suffer except through accident, and he had only
retreated just enough to keep from being killed himself. He had
had no intention of running away until he saw that he was
hopelessly lost were he to remain.</p>

<p>Alone he could have sprung into the midst of that close-packed
mob, and, laying about him after the fashion of Numa, the lion,
have struck the Arabs with such consternation that escape would
have been easy. Now he must think entirely of these two faithful
friends.</p>

<p>He crossed to the window which overlooked the street. In a
minute there would be enemies below. Already he could hear the
mob clambering the stairway to the next quarters&mdash;they would
be at the door beside him in another instant. He put a foot upon
the sill and leaned out, but he did not look down. Above him,
within arm's reach, was the low roof of the building. He called
to the girl.</p>

<p>She came and stood beside him. He put a great arm about her
and lifted her across his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Wait here until I reach down for you from above," he said to
Abdul. "In the meantime shove everything in the room against that
door&mdash;it may delay them long enough." Then he stepped to the
sill of the narrow window with the girl upon his shoulders. "Hold
tight," he cautioned her. A moment later he had clambered to the
roof above with the ease and dexterity of an ape. Setting the
girl down, he leaned far over the roof's edge, calling softly to
Abdul.</p>

<p>The youth ran to the window.</p>

<p>"Your hand," whispered Tarzan. The men in the room beyond were
battering at the door. With a sudden crash it fell splintering
in, and at the same instant Abdul felt himself lifted like a
feather onto the roof above. They were not a moment too soon, for
as the men broke into the room which they had just quitted a
dozen more rounded the corner in the street below and came
running to a spot beneath the girl's window.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap8" id="chap8">VIII. &mdash; THE FIGHT IN THE
DESERT</a></h2>

<div align="center"> <img src="fr100053-images/TheReturnOfTarzan-08.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration"> </div><br>

<p class="first">As the three squatted upon the roof above the
quarters of the Ouled-Nails they heard the angry cursing of the
Arabs in the room beneath. Abdul translated from time to time to
Tarzan.</p>

<p>"They are berating those in the street below now," said Abdul,
"for permitting us to escape so easily. Those in the street say
that we did not come that way&mdash;that we are still within the
building, and that those above, being too cowardly to attack us,
are attempting to deceive them into believing that we have
escaped. In a moment they will have fighting of their own to
attend to if they continue their brawling." Presently those in
the building gave up the search, and returned to the cafe. A few
remained in the street below, smoking and talking.</p>

<p>Tarzan spoke to the girl, thanking her for the sacrifice she
had made for him, a total stranger.</p>

<p>"I liked you," she said simply. "You were unlike the others
who come to the cafe. You did not speak coarsely to me&mdash;the
manner in which you gave me money was not an insult."</p>

<p>"What shall you do after tonight?" he asked. "You cannot
return to the cafe. Can you even remain with safety in Sidi
Aissa?"</p>

<p>"Tomorrow it will be forgotten," she replied. "But I should be
glad if it might be that I need never return to this or another
cafe. I have not remained because I wished to; I have been a
prisoner."</p>

<p>"A prisoner!" ejaculated Tarzan incredulously.</p>

<p>"A slave would be the better word," she answered. "I was
stolen in the night from my father's <i>douar</i> by a band of
marauders. They brought me here and sold me to the Arab who keeps
this cafe. It has been nearly two years now since I saw the last
of mine own people. They are very far to the south. They never
come to Sidi Aissa."</p>

<p>"You would like to return to your people?" asked Tarzan. "Then
I shall promise to see you safely so far as Bou Saada at least.
There we can doubtless arrange with the commandant to send you
the rest of the way."</p>

<p>"Oh, m'sieur," she cried, "how can I ever repay you! You
cannot really mean that you will do so much for a poor Ouled-
Nail. But my father can reward you, and he will, for is he not a
great sheik? He is Kadour ben Saden."</p>

<p>"Kadour ben Saden!" ejaculated Tarzan. "Why, Kadour ben Saden
is in Sidi Aissa this very night. He dined with me but a few
hours since."</p>

<p>"My father in Sidi Aissa?" cried the amazed girl. "Allah be
praised then, for I am indeed saved."</p>

<p>"Hssh!" cautioned Abdul. "Listen." From below came the sound
of voices, quite distinguishable upon the still night air. Tarzan
could not understand the words, but Abdul and the girl
translated.</p>

<p>"They have gone now," said the latter. "It is you they want,
m'sieur. One of them said that the stranger who had offered money
for your slaying lay in the house of Akmed din Soulef with a
broken wrist, but that he had offered a still greater reward if
some would lay in wait for you upon the road to Bou Saada and
kill you."</p>

<p>"It is he who followed m'sieur about the market today,"
exclaimed Abdul. "I saw him again within the cafe&mdash;him and
another; and the two went out into the inner court after talking
with this girl here. It was they who attacked and fired upon us,
as we came out of the cafe. Why do they wish to kill you,
m'sieur?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," replied Tarzan, and then, after a pause:
"Unless&mdash;" But he did not finish, for the thought that had
come to his mind, while it seemed the only reasonable solution of
the mystery, appeared at the same time quite improbable.
Presently the men in the street went away. The courtyard and the
cafe were deserted.</p>

<p>Cautiously Tarzan lowered himself to the sill of the girl's
window.</p>

<p>The room was empty. He returned to the roof and let Abdul
down, then he lowered the girl to the arms of the waiting
Arab.</p>

<p>From the window Abdul dropped the short distance to the street
below, while Tarzan took the girl in his arms and leaped down as
he had done on so many other occasions in his own forest with a
burden in his arms. A little cry of alarm was startled from the
girl's lips, but Tarzan landed in the street with but an
imperceptible jar, and lowered her in safety to her feet.</p>

<p>She clung to him for a moment.</p>

<p>"How strong m'sieur is, and how active," she cried. "<i>El
Adrea</i>, the black lion, himself is not more so."</p>

<p>"I should like to meet this <i>El Adrea</i> of yours," he
said. "I have heard much about him."</p>

<p>"And you come to the <i>douar</i> of my father you shall see
him," said the girl. "He lives in a spur of the mountains north
of us, and comes down from his lair at night to rob my father's
<i>douar</i>. With a single blow of his mighty paw he crushes the
skull of a bull, and woe betide the belated wayfarer who meets
<i>El Adrea</i> abroad at night." Without further mishap they
reached the hotel. The sleepy landlord objected strenuously to
instituting a search for Kadour ben Saden until the following
morning, but a piece of gold put a different aspect on the
matter, so that a few moments later a servant had started to make
the rounds of the lesser native hostelries where it might be
expected that a desert sheik would find congenial associations.
Tarzan had felt it necessary to find the girl's father that
night, for fear he might start on his homeward journey too early
in the morning to be intercepted.</p>

<p>They had waited perhaps half an hour when the messenger
returned with Kadour ben Saden. The old sheik entered the room
with a questioning expression upon his proud face.</p>

<p>"Monsieur has done me the honor to&mdash;" he commenced, and
then his eyes fell upon the girl. With outstretched arms he
crossed the room to meet her. "My daughter!" he cried. "Allah is
merciful!" and tears dimmed the martial eyes of the old
warrior.</p>

<p>When the story of her abduction and her final rescue had been
told to Kadour ben Saden he extended his hand to Tarzan.</p>

<p>"All that is Kadour ben Saden's is thine, my friend, even to
his life," he said very simply, but Tarzan knew that those were
no idle words.</p>

<p>It was decided that although three of them would have to ride
after practically no sleep, it would be best to make an early
start in the morning, and attempt to ride all the way to Bou
Saada in one day. It would have been comparatively easy for the
men, but for the girl it was sure to be a fatiguing journey.</p>

<p>She, however, was the most anxious to undertake it, for it
seemed to her that she could not quickly enough reach the family
and friends from whom she had been separated for two years.</p>

<p>It seemed to Tarzan that he had not closed his eyes before he
was awakened, and in another hour the party was on its way south
toward Bou Saada. For a few miles the road was good, and they
made rapid progress, but suddenly it became only a waste of sand,
into which the horses sank fetlock deep at nearly every step. In
addition to Tarzan, Abdul, the sheik, and his daughter were four
of the wild plainsmen of the sheik's tribe who had accompanied
him upon the trip to Sidi Aissa. Thus, seven guns strong, they
entertained little fear of attack by day, and if all went well
they should reach Bou Saada before nightfall.</p>

<p>A brisk wind enveloped them in the blowing sand of the desert,
until Tarzan's lips were parched and cracked. What little he
could see of the surrounding country was far from
alluring&mdash;a vast expanse of rough country, rolling in
little, barren hillocks, and tufted here and there with clumps of
dreary shrub. Far to the south rose the dim lines of the Saharan
Atlas range. How different, thought Tarzan, from the gorgeous
Africa of his boyhood! Abdul, always on the alert, looked
backward quite as often as he did ahead. At the top of each
hillock that they mounted he would draw in his horse and,
turning, scan the country to the rear with utmost care. At last
his scrutiny was rewarded.</p>

<p>"Look!" he cried. "There are six horsemen behind us."</p>

<p>"Your friends of last evening, no doubt, monsieur," remarked
Kadour ben Saden dryly to Tarzan.</p>

<p>"No doubt," replied the ape-man. "I am sorry that my society
should endanger the safety of your journey. At the next village I
shall remain and question these gentlemen, while you ride on.
There is no necessity for my being at Bou Saada tonight, and less
still why you should not ride in peace."</p>

<p>"If you stop we shall stop," said Kadour ben Saden. "Until you
are safe with your friends, or the enemy has left your trail, we
shall remain with you. There is nothing more to say."</p>

<p>Tarzan nodded his head. He was a man of few words, and
possibly it was for this reason as much as any that Kadour ben
Saden had taken to him, for if there be one thing that an Arab
despises it is a talkative man.</p>

<p>All the balance of the day Abdul caught glimpses of the
horsemen in their rear. They remained always at about the same
distance.</p>

<p>During the occasional halts for rest, and at the longer halt
at noon, they approached no closer.</p>

<p>"They are waiting for darkness," said Kadour ben Saden.</p>

<p>And darkness came before they reached Bou Saada. The last
glimpse that Abdul had of the grim, white-robed figures that
trailed them, just before dusk made it impossible to distinguish
them, had made it apparent that they were rapidly closing up the
distance that intervened between them and their intended quarry.
He whispered this fact to Tarzan, for he did not wish to alarm
the girl. The ape-man drew back beside him.</p>

<p>"You will ride ahead with the others, Abdul," said Tarzan.
"This is my quarrel. I shall wait at the next convenient spot,
and interview these fellows."</p>

<p>"Then Abdul shall wait at thy side," replied the young Arab,
nor would any threats or commands move him from his decision.</p>

<p>"Very well, then," replied Tarzan. "Here is as good a place as
we could wish. Here are rocks at the top of this hillock. We
shall remain hidden here and give an account of ourselves to
these gentlemen when they appear." They drew in their horses and
dismounted. The others riding ahead were already out of sight in
the darkness. Beyond them shone the lights of Bou Saada. Tarzan
removed his rifle from its boot and loosened his revolver in its
holster. He ordered Abdul to withdraw behind the rocks with the
horses, so that they should be shielded from the enemies' bullets
should they fire. The young Arab pretended to do as he was bid,
but when he had fastened the two animals securely to a low shrub
he crept back to lie on his belly a few paces behind Tarzan.</p>

<p>The ape-man stood erect in the middle of the road, waiting.
Nor did he have long to wait. The sound of galloping horses came
suddenly out of the darkness below him, and a moment later he
discerned the moving blotches of lighter color against the solid
background of the night.</p>

<p>"Halt," he cried, "or we fire!" The white figures came to a
sudden stop, and for a moment there was silence. Then came the
sound of a whispered council, and like ghosts the phantom riders
dispersed in all directions. Again the desert lay still about
him, yet it was an ominous stillness that foreboded evil.</p>

<p>Abdul raised himself to one knee. Tarzan cocked his jungle-
trained ears, and presently there came to him the sound of horses
walking quietly through the sand to the east of him, to the west,
to the north, and to the south. They had been surrounded. Then a
shot came from the direction in which he was looking, a bullet
whirred through the air above his head, and he fired at the flash
of the enemy's gun.</p>

<p>Instantly the soundless waste was torn with the quick staccato
of guns upon every hand. Abdul and Tarzan fired only at the
flashes&mdash;they could not yet see their foemen. Presently it
became evident that the attackers were circling their position,
drawing closer and closer in as they began to realize the paltry
numbers of the party which opposed them.</p>

<p>But one came too close, for Tarzan was accustomed to using his
eyes in the darkness of the jungle night, than which there is no
more utter darkness this side of the grave, and with a cry of
pain a saddle was emptied.</p>

<p>"The odds are evening, Abdul," said Tarzan, with a low
laugh.</p>

<p>But they were still far too one-sided, and when the five
remaining horsemen whirled at a signal and charged full upon them
it looked as if there would be a sudden ending of the battle.
Both Tarzan and Abdul sprang to the shelter of the rocks, that
they might keep the enemy in front of them. There was a mad
clatter of galloping hoofs, a volley of shots from both sides,
and the Arabs withdrew to repeat the maneuver; but there were now
only four against the two.</p>

<p>For a few moments there came no sound from out of the
surrounding blackness. Tarzan could not tell whether the Arabs,
satisfied with their losses, had given up the fight, or were
waiting farther along the road to waylay them as they proceeded
on toward Bou Saada.</p>

<p>But he was not left long in doubt, for now all from one
direction came the sound of a new charge. But scarcely had the
first gun spoken ere a dozen shots rang out behind the Arabs.
There came the wild shouts of a new party to the controversy, and
the pounding of the feet of many horses from down the road to Bou
Saada.</p>

<p>The Arabs did not wait to learn the identity of the oncomers.
With a parting volley as they dashed by the position which Tarzan
and Abdul were holding, they plunged off along the road toward
Sidi Aissa. A moment later Kadour ben Saden and his men dashed
up.</p>

<p>The old sheik was much relieved to find that neither Tarzan
nor Abdul had received a scratch. Not even had their horses been
wounded.</p>

<p>They sought out the two men who had fallen before Tarzan's
shots, and, finding that both were dead, left them where they
lay.</p>

<p>"Why did you not tell me that you contemplated ambushing those
fellows?" asked the sheik in a hurt tone. "We might have had them
all if the seven of us had stopped to meet them."</p>

<p>"Then it would have been useless to stop at all," replied
Tarzan, "for had we simply ridden on toward Bou Saada they would
have been upon us presently, and all could have been engaged. It
was to prevent the transfer of my own quarrel to another's
shoulders that Abdul and I stopped off to question them. Then
there is your daughter&mdash;I could not be the cause of exposing
her needlessly to the marksmanship of six men." Kadour ben Saden
shrugged his shoulders. He did not relish having been cheated out
of a fight.</p>

<p>The little battle so close to Bou Saada had drawn out a
company of soldiers. Tarzan and his party met them just outside
the town.</p>

<p>The officer in charge halted them to learn the significance of
the shots.</p>

<p>"A handful of marauders," replied Kadour ben Saden. "They
attacked two of our number who had dropped behind, but when we
returned to them the fellows soon dispersed. They left two dead.
None of my party was injured." This seemed to satisfy the
officer, and after taking the names of the party he marched his
men on toward the scene of the skirmish to bring back the dead
men for purposes of identification, if possible.</p>

<p>Two days later, Kadour ben Saden, with his daughter and
followers, rode south through the pass below Bou Saada, bound for
their home in the far wilderness. The sheik had urged Tarzan to
accompany him, and the girl had added her entreaties to those of
her father; but, though he could not explain it to them, Tarzan's
duties loomed particularly large after the happenings of the past
few days, so that he could not think of leaving his post for an
instant. But he promised to come later if it lay within his power
to do so, and they had to content themselves with that
assurance.</p>

<p>During these two days Tarzan had spent practically all his
time with Kadour ben Saden and his daughter. He was keenly
interested in this race of stern and dignified warriors, and
embraced the opportunity which their friendship offered to learn
what he could of their lives and customs. He even commenced to
acquire the rudiments of their language under the pleasant
tutorage of the brown-eyed girl. It was with real regret that he
saw them depart, and he sat his horse at the opening to the pass,
as far as which he had accompanied them, gazing after the little
party as long as he could catch a glimpse of them.</p>

<p>Here were people after his own heart! Their wild, rough lives,
filled with danger and hardship, appealed to this half-savage man
as nothing had appealed to him in the midst of the effeminate
civilization of the great cities he had visited. Here was a life
that excelled even that of the jungle, for here he might have the
society of men&mdash;real men whom he could honor and respect,
and yet be near to the wild nature that he loved. In his head
revolved an idea that when he had completed his mission he would
resign and return to live for the remainder of his life with the
tribe of Kadour ben Saden.</p>

<p>Then he turned his horse's head and rode slowly back to Bou
Saada.</p>

<p>The front of the Hotel du Petit Sahara, where Tarzan stopped
in Bou Saada, is taken up with the bar, two dining-rooms, and the
kitchens. Both of the dining-rooms open directly off the bar, and
one of them is reserved for the use of the officers of the
garrison. As you stand in the barroom you may look into either of
the dining-rooms if you wish.</p>

<p>It was to the bar that Tarzan repaired after speeding Kadour
ben Saden and his party on their way. It was yet early in the
morning, for Kadour ben Saden had elected to ride far that day,
so that it happened that when Tarzan returned there were guests
still at breakfast.</p>

<p>As his casual glance wandered into the officers' dining-room,
Tarzan saw something which brought a look of interest to his
eyes. Lieutenant Gernois was sitting there, and as Tarzan looked
a white-robed Arab approached and, bending, whispered a few words
into the lieutenant's ear. Then he passed on out of the building
through another door.</p>

<p>In itself the thing was nothing, but as the man had stooped to
speak to the officer, Tarzan had caught sight of something which
the accidental parting of the man's burnoose had
revealed&mdash;he carried his left arm in a sling.</p> <hr> <br>

<div align="center"> <img src="fr100053-images/TheReturnOfTarzan-09.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration"> </div><br>

<p class="first">On the same day that Kadour ben Saden rode south
the diligence from the north brought Tarzan a letter from D'Arnot
which had been forwarded from Sidi-bel-Abbes. It opened the old
wound that Tarzan would have been glad to have forgotten; yet he
was not sorry that D'Arnot had written, for one at least of his
subjects could never cease to interest the ape-man. Here is the
letter:</p><br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">My Dear Jean</span>:</p>

<p class="letter">Since last I wrote you I have been across to
London on a matter of business. I was there but three days. The
very first day I came upon an old friend of yours&mdash;quite
unexpectedly&mdash;in Henrietta Street. Now you never in the
world would guess whom. None other than Mr. Samuel T. Philander.
But it is true. I can see your look of incredulity. Nor is this
all. He insisted that I return to the hotel with him, and there I
found the others&mdash;Professor Archimedes Q. Porter, Miss
Porter, and that enormous black woman, Miss Porter's
maid&mdash;Esmeralda, you will recall. While I was there Clayton
came in. They are to be married soon, or rather sooner, for I
rather suspect that we shall receive announcements almost any
day. On account of his father's death it is to be a very quiet
affair&mdash;only blood relatives.</p>

<p class="letter">While I was alone with Mr. Philander the old
fellow became rather confidential. Said Miss Porter had already
postponed the wedding on three different occasions. He confided
that it appeared to him that she was not particularly anxious to
marry Clayton at all; but this time it seems that it is quite
likely to go through.</p>

<p class="letter">Of course they all asked after you, but I
respected your wishes in the matter of your true origin, and only
spoke to them of your present affairs.</p>

<p class="letter">Miss Porter was especially interested in
everything I had to say about you, and asked many questions. I am
afraid I took a rather unchivalrous delight in picturing your
desire and resolve to go back eventually to your native jungle. I
was sorry afterward, for it did seem to cause her real anguish to
contemplate the awful dangers to which you wished to return. "And
yet," she said, "I do not know. There are more unhappy fates than
the grim and terrible jungle presents to Monsieur Tarzan. At
least his conscience will be free from remorse. And there are
moments of quiet and restfulness by day, and vistas of exquisite
beauty. You may find it strange that I should say it, who
experienced such terrifying experiences in that frightful forest,
yet at times I long to return, for I cannot but feel that the
happiest moments of my life were spent there." There was an
expression of ineffable sadness on her face as she spoke, and I
could not but feel that she knew that I knew her secret, and that
this was her way of transmitting to you a last tender message
from a heart that might still enshrine your memory, though its
possessor belonged to another.</p>

<p class="letter">Clayton appeared nervous and ill at ease while
you were the subject of conversation. He wore a worried and
harassed expression. Yet he was very kindly in his expressions of
interest in you. I wonder if he suspects the truth about you?
Tennington came in with Clayton. They are great friends, you
know.</p>

<p class="letter">He is about to set out upon one of his
interminable cruises in that yacht of his, and was urging the
entire party to accompany him.</p>

<p class="letter">Tried to inveigle me into it, too. Is thinking
of circumnavigating Africa this time. I told him that his
precious toy would take him and some of his friends to the bottom
of the ocean one of these days if he didn't get it out of his
head that she was a liner or a battleship.</p>

<p class="letter">I returned to Paris day before yesterday, and
yesterday I met the Count and Countess de Coude at the races.
They inquired after you. De Coude really seems quite fond of you.
Doesn't appear to harbor the least ill will. Olga is as beautiful
as ever, but a trifle subdued. I imagine that she learned a
lesson through her acquaintance with you that will serve her in
good stead during the balance of her life. It is fortunate for
her, and for De Coude as well, that it was you and not another
man more sophisticated.</p>

<p class="letter">Had you really paid court to Olga's heart I am
afraid that there would have been no hope for either of you.</p>

<p class="letter">She asked me to tell you that Nikolas had left
France. She paid him twenty thousand francs to go away, and stay.
She is congratulating herself that she got rid of him before he
tried to carry out a threat he recently made her that he should
kill you at the first opportunity. She said that she should hate
to think that her brother's blood was on your hands, for she is
very fond of you, and made no bones in saying so before the
count. It never for a moment seemed to occur to her that there
might be any possibility of any other outcome of a meeting
between you and Nikolas. The count quite agreed with her in that.
He added that it would take a regiment of Rokoffs to kill you. He
has a most healthy respect for your prowess.</p>

<p class="letter">Have been ordered back to my ship. She sails
from Le Havre in two days under sealed orders. If you will
address me in her care, the letters will find me eventually. I
shall write you as soon as another opportunity presents.</p>

<p class="letter">Your sincere friend, <span class="smcap">Paul
D'Arnot</span>.</p><br>

<p>"I fear," mused Tarzan, half aloud, "that Olga has thrown away
her twenty thousand francs." He read over that part of D'Arnot's
letter several times in which he had quoted from his conversation
with Jane Porter. Tarzan derived a rather pathetic happiness from
it, but it was better than no happiness at all.</p>

<p>The following three weeks were quite uneventful. On several
occasions Tarzan saw the mysterious Arab, and once again he had
been exchanging words with Lieutenant Gernois; but no amount of
espionage or shadowing by Tarzan revealed the Arab's lodgings,
the location of which Tarzan was anxious to ascertain.</p>

<p>Gernois, never cordial, had kept more than ever aloof from
Tarzan since the episode in the dining-room of the hotel at
Aumale. His attitude on the few occasions that they had been
thrown together had been distinctly hostile.</p>

<p>That he might keep up the appearance of the character he was
playing, Tarzan spent considerable time hunting in the vicinity
of Bou Saada. He would spend entire days in the foothills,
ostensibly searching for gazelle, but on the few occasions that
he came close enough to any of the beautiful little animals to
harm them he invariably allowed them to escape without so much as
taking his rifle from its boot. The ape-man could see no sport in
slaughtering the most harmless and defenseless of God's creatures
for the mere pleasure of killing.</p>

<p>In fact, Tarzan had never killed for "pleasure," nor to him
was there pleasure in killing. It was the joy of righteous battle
that he loved&mdash;the ecstasy of victory. And the keen and
successful hunt for food in which he pitted his skill and
craftiness against the skill and craftiness of another; but to
come out of a town filled with food to shoot down a soft-eyed,
pretty gazelle&mdash;ah, that was crueller than the deliberate
and cold-blooded murder of a fellow man. Tarzan would have none
of it, and so he hunted alone that none might discover the sham
that he was practicing.</p>

<p>And once, probably because of the fact that he rode alone, he
was like to have lost his life. He was riding slowly through a
little ravine when a shot sounded close behind him, and a bullet
passed through the cork helmet he wore. Although he turned at
once and galloped rapidly to the top of the ravine, there was no
sign of any enemy, nor did he see aught of another human being
until he reached Bou Saada.</p>

<p>"Yes," he soliloquized, in recalling the occurrence, "Olga has
indeed thrown away her twenty thousand francs." That night he was
Captain Gérard's guest at a little dinner.</p>

<p>"Your hunting has not been very fortunate?" questioned the
officer.</p>

<p>"No," replied Tarzan; "the game hereabout is timid, nor do I
care particularly about hunting game birds or antelope. I think I
shall move on farther south, and have a try at some of your
Algerian lions."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed the captain. "We are marching toward Djelfa
on the morrow. You shall have company that far at least.
Lieutenant Gernois and I, with a hundred men, are ordered south
to patrol a district in which the marauders are giving
considerable trouble.</p>Possibly we may have the pleasure of
hunting the lion together&mdash;what say you?"

<p>Tarzan was more than pleased, nor did he hesitate to say so;
but the captain would have been astonished had he known the real
reason of Tarzan's pleasure.</p>

<p>Gernois was sitting opposite the ape-man. He did not seem so
pleased with his captain's invitation.</p>

<p>"You will find lion hunting more exciting than gazelle
shooting," remarked Captain Gérard, "and more dangerous."</p>

<p>"Even gazelle shooting has its dangers," replied Tarzan.
"Especially when one goes alone. I found it so today. I also
found that while the gazelle is the most timid of animals, it is
not the most cowardly." He let his glance rest only casually upon
Gernois after he had spoken, for he did not wish the man to know
that he was under suspicion, or surveillance, no matter what he
might think. The effect of his remark upon him, however, might
tend to prove his connection with, or knowledge of, certain
recent happenings. Tarzan saw a dull red creep up from beneath
Gernois' collar. He was satisfied, and quickly changed the
subject.</p>

<p>When the column rode south from Bou Saada the next morning
there were half a dozen Arabs bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>"They are not attached to the command," replied Gérard in
response to Tarzan's query. "They merely accompany us on the road
for companionship." Tarzan had learned enough about Arab
character since he had been in Algeria to know that this was no
real motive, for the Arab is never overfond of the companionship
of strangers, and especially of French soldiers. So his
suspicions were aroused, and he decided to keep a sharp eye on
the little party that trailed behind the column at a distance of
about a quarter of a mile. But they did not come close enough
even during the halts to enable him to obtain a close scrutiny of
them.</p>

<p>He had long been convinced that there were hired assassins on
his trail, nor was he in great doubt but that Rokoff was at the
bottom of the plot. Whether it was to be revenge for the several
occasions in the past that Tarzan had defeated the Russian's
purposes and humiliated him, or was in some way connected with
his mission in the Gernois affair, he could not determine. If the
latter, and it seemed probable since the evidence he had had that
Gernois suspected him, then he had two rather powerful enemies to
contend with, for there would be many opportunities in the wilds
of Algeria, for which they were bound, to dispatch a suspected
enemy quietly and without attracting suspicion.</p>

<p>After camping at Djelfa for two days the column moved to the
southwest, from whence word had come that the marauders were
operating against the tribes whose douars were situated at the
foot of the mountains.</p>

<p>The little band of Arabs who had accompanied them from Bou
Saada had disappeared suddenly the very night that orders had
been given to prepare for the morrow's march from Djelfa. Tarzan
made casual inquiries among the men, but none could tell him why
they had left, or in what direction they had gone. He did not
like the looks of it, especially in view of the fact that he had
seen Gernois in conversation with one of them some half hour
after Captain Gérard had issued his instructions relative to the
new move. Only Gernois and Tarzan knew the direction of the
proposed march. All the soldiers knew was that they were to be
prepared to break camp early the next morning. Tarzan wondered if
Gernois could have revealed their destination to the Arabs.</p>

<p>Late that afternoon they went into camp at a little oasis in
which was the <i>douar</i> of a sheik whose flocks were being
stolen, and whose herdsmen were being killed. The Arabs came out
of their goatskin tents, and surrounded the soldiers, asking many
questions in the native tongue, for the soldiers were themselves
natives. Tarzan, who, by this time, with the assistance of Abdul,
had picked up quite a smattering of Arab, questioned one of the
younger men who had accompanied the sheik while the latter paid
his respects to Captain Gérard.</p>

<p>No, he had seen no party of six horsemen riding from the
direction of Djelfa. There were other oases scattered
about&mdash;possibly they had been journeying to one of these.
Then there were the marauders in the mountains above&mdash;they
often rode north to Bou Saada in small parties, and even as far
as Aumale and Bouira. It might indeed have been a few marauders
returning to the band from a pleasure trip to one of these
cities.</p>

<p>Early the next morning Captain Gérard split his command in
two, giving Lieutenant Gernois command of one party, while he
headed the other. They were to scour the mountains upon opposite
sides of the plain.</p>

<p>"And with which detachment will Monsieur Tarzan ride?" asked
the captain. "Or maybe it is that monsieur does not care to hunt
marauders?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall be delighted to go," Tarzan hastened to explain.
He was wondering what excuse he could make to accompany
Gernois.</p>

<p>His embarrassment was short-lived, and was relieved from a
most unexpected source. It was Gernois himself who spoke.</p>

<p>"If my captain will forego the pleasure of Monsieur Tarzan's
company for this once, I shall esteem it an honor indeed to have
monsieur ride with me today," he said, nor was his tone lacking
in cordiality.</p>

<p>In fact, Tarzan imagined that he had overdone it a trifle,
but, even so, he was both astounded and pleased, hastening to
express his delight at the arrangement.</p>

<p>And so it was that Lieutenant Gernois and Tarzan rode off side
by side at the head of the little detachment of <i>spahis</i>.
Gernois' cordiality was short-lived. No sooner had they ridden
out of sight of Captain Gérard and his men than he lapsed once
more into his accustomed taciturnity. As they advanced the ground
became rougher.</p>

<p>Steadily it ascended toward the mountains, into which they
filed through a narrow canyon close to noon. By the side of a
little rivulet Gernois called the midday halt. Here the men
prepared and ate their frugal meal, and refilled their
canteens.</p>

<p>After an hour's rest they advanced again along the canyon,
until they presently came to a little valley, from which several
rocky gorges diverged. Here they halted, while Gernois minutely
examined the surrounding heights from the center of the
depression.</p>

<p>"We shall separate here," he said, "several riding into each
of these gorges," and then he commenced to detail his various
squads and issue instructions to the non-commissioned officers
who were to command them. When he had done he turned to Tarzan.
"Monsieur will be so good as to remain here until we return."
Tarzan demurred, but the officer cut him short. "There may be
fighting for one of these sections," he said, "and troops cannot
be embarrassed by civilian noncombatants during action."</p>

<p>"But, my dear lieutenant," expostulated Tarzan, "I am most
ready and willing to place myself under command of yourself or
any of your sergeants or corporals, and to fight in the ranks as
they direct. It is what I came for."</p>

<p>"I should be glad to think so," retorted Gernois, with a sneer
he made no attempt to disguise. Then shortly: "You are under my
orders, and they are that you remain here until we return. Let
that end the matter," and he turned and spurred away at the head
of his men. A moment later Tarzan found himself alone in the
midst of a desolate mountain fastness.</p>

<p>The sun was hot, so he sought the shelter of a nearby tree,
where he tethered his horse, and sat down upon the ground to
smoke. Inwardly he swore at Gernois for the trick he had played
upon him. A mean little revenge, thought Tarzan, and then
suddenly it occurred to him that the man would not be such a fool
as to antagonize him through a trivial annoyance of so petty a
description. There must be something deeper than this behind it.
With the thought he arose and removed his rifle from its boot. He
looked to its loads and saw that the magazine was full. Then he
inspected his revolver.</p>

<p>After this preliminary precaution he scanned the surrounding
heights and the mouths of the several gorges&mdash;he was
determined that he should not be caught napping.</p>

<p>The sun sank lower and lower, yet there was no sign of
returning <i>spahis</i>. At last the valley was submerged in
shadow. Tarzan was too proud to go back to camp until he had
given the detachment ample time to return to the valley, which he
thought was to have been their rendezvous. With the closing in of
night he felt safer from attack, for he was at home in the dark.
He knew that none might approach him so cautiously as to elude
those alert and sensitive ears of his; then there were his eyes,
too, for he could see well at night; and his nose, if they came
toward him from up-wind, would apprise him of the approach of an
enemy while they were still a great way off.</p>

<p>So he felt that he was in little danger, and thus lulled to a
sense of security he fell asleep, with his back against the
tree.</p>

<p>He must have slept for several hours, for when he was suddenly
awakened by the frightened snorting and plunging of his horse the
moon was shining full upon the little valley, and there, not ten
paces before him, stood the grim cause of the terror of his
mount.</p>

<p>Superb, majestic, his graceful tail extended and quivering,
and his two eyes of fire riveted full upon his prey, stood Numa
<i>El Adrea</i>, the black lion. A little thrill of joy tingled
through Tarzan's nerves. It was like meeting an old friend after
years of separation.</p>

<p>For a moment he sat rigid to enjoy the magnificent spectacle
of this lord of the wilderness.</p>

<p>But now Numa was crouching for the spring. Very slowly Tarzan
raised his gun to his shoulder. He had never killed a large
animal with a gun in all his life&mdash;heretofore he had
depended upon his spear, his poisoned arrows, his rope, his
knife, or his bare hands.</p>

<p>Instinctively he wished that he had his arrows and his
knife&mdash;he would have felt surer with them.</p>

<p>Numa was lying quite flat upon the ground now, presenting only
his head. Tarzan would have preferred to fire a little from one
side, for he knew what terrific damage the lion could do if he
lived two minutes, or even a minute after he was hit. The horse
stood trembling in terror at Tarzan's back. The ape-man took a
cautious step to one side&mdash;Numa but followed him with his
eyes. Another step he took, and then another. Numa had not moved.
Now he could aim at a point between the eye and the ear.</p>

<p>His finger tightened upon the trigger, and as he fired Numa
sprang.</p>

<p>At the same instant the terrified horse made a last frantic
effort to escape&mdash;the tether parted, and he went careening
down the canyon toward the desert.</p>

<p>No ordinary man could have escaped those frightful claws when
Numa sprang from so short a distance, but Tarzan was no ordinary
man.</p>

<p>From earliest childhood his muscles had been trained by the
fierce exigencies of his existence to act with the rapidity of
thought.</p>

<p>As quick as was <i>El Adrea</i>, Tarzan of the Apes was
quicker, and so the great beast crashed against a tree where he
had expected to feel the soft flesh of man, while Tarzan, a
couple of paces to the right, pumped another bullet into him that
brought him clawing and roaring to his side.</p>

<p>Twice more Tarzan fired in quick succession, and then <i>El
Adrea</i> lay still and roared no more. It was no longer Monsieur
Jean Tarzan; it was Tarzan of the Apes that put a savage foot
upon the body of his savage kill, and, raising his face to the
full moon, lifted his mighty voice in the weird and terrible
challenge of his kind&mdash;a bull ape had made his kill. And the
wild things in the wild mountains stopped in their hunting, and
trembled at this new and awful voice, while down in the desert
the children of the wilderness came out of their goatskin tents
and looked toward the mountains, wondering what new and savage
scourge had come to devastate their flocks.</p>

<p>A half mile from the valley in which Tarzan stood, a score of
white-robed figures, bearing long, wicked-looking guns, halted at
the sound, and looked at one another with questioning eyes. But
presently, as it was not repeated, they took up their silent,
stealthy way toward the valley.</p>

<p>Tarzan was now confident that Gernois had no intention of
returning for him, but he could not fathom the object that had
prompted the officer to desert him, yet leave him free to return
to camp. His horse gone, he decided that it would be foolish to
remain longer in the mountains, so he set out toward the
desert.</p>

<p>He had scarcely entered the confines of the canyon when the
first of the white-robed figures emerged into the valley upon the
opposite side. For a moment they scanned the little depression
from behind sheltering boulders, but when they had satisfied
themselves that it was empty they advanced across it. Beneath the
tree at one side they came upon the body of <i>El Adrea</i>. With
muttered exclamations they crowded about it. Then, a moment
later, they hurried down the canyon which Tarzan was threading a
brief distance in advance of them. They moved cautiously and in
silence, taking advantage of shelter, as men do who are stalking
man.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap10" id="chap10">X. &mdash; THROUGH THE VALLEY OF
THE SHADOW</a></h2>

<div align="center"> <img src="fr100053-images/TheReturnOfTarzan-10.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration"> </div><br>

<p class="first">As Tarzan walked down the wild canyon beneath the
brilliant African moon the call of the jungle was strong upon
him. The solitude and the savage freedom filled his heart with
life and buoyancy. Again he was Tarzan of the Apes&mdash;every
sense alert against the chance of surprise by some jungle
enemy&mdash;yet treading lightly and with head erect, in proud
consciousness of his might.</p>

<p>The nocturnal sounds of the mountains were new to him, yet
they fell upon his ears like the soft voice of a half-forgotten
love.</p>

<p>Many he intuitively sensed&mdash;ah, there was one that was
familiar indeed; the distant coughing of Sheeta, the leopard; but
there was a strange note in the final wail which made him doubt.
It was a panther he heard.</p>

<p>Presently a new sound&mdash;a soft, stealthy
sound&mdash;obtruded itself among the others. No human ears other
than the ape-man's would have detected it. At first he did not
translate it, but finally he realized that it came from the bare
feet of a number of human beings. They were behind him, and they
were coming toward him quietly. He was being stalked.</p>

<p>In a flash he knew why he had been left in that little valley
by Gernois; but there had been a hitch in the
arrangements&mdash;the men had come too late. Closer and closer
came the footsteps. Tarzan halted and faced them, his rifle ready
in his hand. Now he caught a fleeting glimpse of a white
burnoose. He called aloud in French, asking what they would of
him. His reply was the flash of a long gun, and with the sound of
the shot Tarzan of the Apes plunged forward upon his face.</p>

<p>The Arabs did not rush out immediately; instead, they waited
to be sure that their victim did not rise. Then they came rapidly
from their concealment, and bent over him. It was soon apparent
that he was not dead. One of the men put the muzzle of his gun to
the back of Tarzan's head to finish him, but another waved him
aside.</p>

<p>"If we bring him alive the reward is to be greater," explained
the latter. So they bound his hands and feet, and, picking him
up, placed him on the shoulders of four of their number. Then the
march was resumed toward the desert. When they had come out of
the mountains they turned toward the south, and about daylight
came to the spot where their horses stood in care of two of their
number.</p>

<p>From here on their progress was more rapid. Tarzan, who had
regained consciousness, was tied to a spare horse, which they
evidently had brought for the purpose. His wound was but a slight
scratch, which had furrowed the flesh across his temple. It had
stopped bleeding, but the dried and clotted blood smeared his
face and clothing. He had said no word since he had fallen into
the hands of these Arabs, nor had they addressed him other than
to issue a few brief commands to him when the horses had been
reached.</p>

<p>For six hours they rode rapidly across the burning desert,
avoiding the oases near which their way led. About noon they came
to a <i>douar</i> of about twenty tents. Here they halted, and as
one of the Arabs was releasing the alfa-grass ropes which bound
him to his mount they were surrounded by a mob of men, women, and
children.</p>

<p>Many of the tribe, and more especially the women, appeared to
take delight in heaping insults upon the prisoner, and some had
even gone so far as to throw stones at him and strike him with
sticks, when an old sheik appeared and drove them away.</p>

<p>"Ali-ben-Ahmed tells me," he said, "that this man sat alone in
the mountains and slew <i>El Adrea</i>. What the business of the
stranger who sent us after him may be, I know not, and what he
may do with this man when we turn him over to him, I care not;
but the prisoner is a brave man, and while he is in our hands he
shall be treated with the respect that be due one who hunts
<i>the lord with the large head</i> alone and by night&mdash;and
slays him." Tarzan had heard of the respect in which Arabs held a
lion-killer, and he was not sorry that chance had played into his
hands thus favorably to relieve him of the petty tortures of the
tribe. Shortly after this he was taken to a goat-skin tent upon
the upper side of the <i>douar</i>. There he was fed, and then,
securely bound, was left lying on a piece of native carpet, alone
in the tent.</p>

<p>He could see a guard sitting before the door of his frail
prison, but when he attempted to force the stout bonds that held
him he realized that any extra precaution on the part of his
captors was quite unnecessary; not even his giant muscles could
part those numerous strands.</p>

<p>Just before dusk several men approached the tent where he lay,
and entered it. All were in Arab dress, but presently one of the
number advanced to Tarzan's side, and as he let the folds of
cloth that had hidden the lower half of his face fall away the
ape-man saw the malevolent features of Nikolas Rokoff. There was
a nasty smile on the bearded lips. "Ah, Monsieur Tarzan," he
said, "this is indeed a pleasure. But why do you not rise and
greet your guest?" Then, with an ugly oath, "Get up, you dog!"
and, drawing back his booted foot, he kicked Tarzan heavily in
the side. "And here is another, and another, and another," he
continued, as he kicked Tarzan about the face and side. "One for
each of the injuries you have done me." The ape-man made no
reply&mdash;he did not even deign to look upon the Russian again
after the first glance of recognition. Finally the sheik, who had
been standing a mute and frowning witness of the cowardly attack,
intervened.</p>

<p>"Stop!" he commanded. "Kill him if you will, but I will see no
brave man subjected to such indignities in my presence. I have
half a mind to turn him loose, that I may see how long you would
kick him then." This threat put a sudden end to Rokoff's
brutality, for he had no craving to see Tarzan loosed from his
bonds while he was within reach of those powerful hands.</p>

<p>"Very well," he replied to the Arab; "I shall kill him
presently."</p>

<p>"Not within the precincts of my <i>douar</i>," returned the
sheik. "When he leaves here he leaves alive. What you do with him
in the desert is none of my concern, but I shall not have the
blood of a Frenchman on the hands of my tribe on account of
another man's quarrel&mdash;they would send soldiers here and
kill many of my people, and burn our tents and drive away our
flocks."</p>

<p>"As you say," growled Rokoff. "I'll take him out into the
desert below the <i>douar</i>, and dispatch him."</p>

<p>"You will take him a day's ride from my country," said the
sheik, firmly, "and some of my children shall follow you to see
that you do not disobey me&mdash;otherwise there may be two dead
Frenchmen in the desert." Rokoff shrugged. "Then I shall have to
wait until the morrow&mdash;it is already dark."</p>

<p>"As you will," said the sheik. "But by an hour after dawn you
must be gone from my <i>douar</i>. I have little liking for
unbelievers, and none at all for a coward." Rokoff would have
made some kind of retort, but he checked himself, for he realized
that it would require but little excuse for the old man to turn
upon him. Together they left the tent. At the door Rokoff could
not resist the temptation to turn and fling a parting taunt at
Tarzan. "Sleep well, monsieur," he said, "and do not forget to
pray well, for when you die tomorrow it will be in such agony
that you will be unable to pray for blaspheming." No one had
bothered to bring Tarzan either food or water since noon, and
consequently he suffered considerably from thirst. He wondered if
it would be worth while to ask his guard for water, but after
making two or three requests without receiving any response, he
decided that it would not.</p>

<p>Far up in the mountains he heard a lion roar. How much safer
one was, he soliloquized, in the haunts of wild beasts than in
the haunts of men. Never in all his jungle life had he been more
relentlessly tracked down than in the past few months of his
experience among civilized men. Never had he been any nearer
death.</p>

<p>Again the lion roared. It sounded a little nearer. Tarzan felt
the old, wild impulse to reply with the challenge of his kind.
His kind? He had almost forgotten that he was a man and not an
ape.</p>

<p>He tugged at his bonds. God, if he could but get them near
those strong teeth of his. He felt a wild wave of madness sweep
over him as his efforts to regain his liberty met with
failure.</p>

<p>Numa was roaring almost continually now. It was quite evident
that he was coming down into the desert to hunt. It was the roar
of a hungry lion. Tarzan envied him, for he was free. No one
would tie him with ropes and slaughter him like a sheep. It was
that which galled the ape-man. He did not fear to die,
no&mdash;it was the humiliation of defeat before death, without
even a chance to battle for his life.</p>

<p>It must be near midnight, thought Tarzan. He had several hours
to live. Possibly he would yet find a way to take Rokoff with him
on the long journey. He could hear the savage lord of the desert
quite close by now. Possibly he sought his meat from among the
penned animals within the <i>douar</i>.</p>

<p>For a long time silence reigned, then Tarzan's trained ears
caught the sound of a stealthily moving body. It came from the
side of the tent nearest the mountains&mdash;the back. Nearer and
nearer it came. He waited, listening intently, for it to pass.
For a time there was silence without, such a terrible silence
that Tarzan was surprised that he did not hear the breathing of
the animal he felt sure must be crouching close to the back wall
of his tent.</p>

<p>There! It is moving again. Closer it creeps. Tarzan turns his
head in the direction of the sound. It is very dark within the
tent. Slowly the back rises from the ground, forced up by the
head and shoulders of a body that looks all black in the semi-
darkness.</p>

<p>Beyond is a faint glimpse of the dimly starlit desert. A grim
smile plays about Tarzan's lips. At least Rokoff will be cheated.
How mad he will be! And death will be more merciful than he could
have hoped for at the hands of the Russian.</p>

<p>Now the back of the tent drops into place, and all is darkness
again&mdash;whatever it is is inside the tent with him. He hears
it creeping close to him&mdash;now it is beside him. He closes
his eyes and waits for the mighty paw. Upon his upturned face
falls the gentle touch of a soft hand groping in the dark, and
then a girl's voice in a scarcely audible whisper pronounces his
name.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is I," he whispers in reply. "But in the name of
Heaven who are you?"</p>

<p>"The Ouled-Nail of Sisi Aissa," came the answer. While she
spoke Tarzan could feel her working about his bonds. Occasionally
the cold steel of a knife touched his flesh. A moment later he
was free.</p>

<p>"Come!" she whispered.</p>

<p>On hands and knees he followed her out of the tent by the way
she had come. She continued crawling thus flat to the ground
until she reached a little patch of shrub. There she halted until
he gained her side. For a moment he looked at her before he
spoke.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand," he said at last. "Why are you here? How
did you know that I was a prisoner in that tent? How does it
happen that it is you who have saved me?" She smiled. "I have
come a long way tonight," she said, "and we have a long way to go
before we shall be out of danger. Come; I shall tell you all
about as we go." Together they rose and set off across the desert
in the direction of the mountains.</p>

<p>"I was not quite sure that I should ever reach you," she said
at last. "EL ADREA is abroad tonight, and after I left the horses
I think he winded me and was following&mdash;I was terribly
frightened."</p>

<p>"What a brave girl," he said. "And you ran all that risk for a
stranger&mdash;an alien&mdash;an unbeliever?" She drew herself up
very proudly.</p>

<p>"I am the daughter of the Sheik Kadour ben Saden," she
answered.</p>

<p>"I should be no fit daughter of his if I would not risk my
life to save that of the man who saved mine while he yet thought
that I was but a common Ouled-Nail."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," he insisted, "you are a very brave girl. But
how did you know that I was a prisoner back there?"</p>

<p>"Achmet-din-Taieb, who is my cousin on my father's side, was
visiting some friends who belong to the tribe that captured you.
He was at the <i>douar</i> when you were brought in. When he
reached home he was telling us about the big Frenchman who had
been captured by Ali-ben-Ahmed for another Frenchman who wished
to kill him. From the description I knew that it must be you. My
father was away. I tried to persuade some of the men to come
and save you, but they would not do it, saying: 'Let the
unbelievers kill one another if they wish. It is none of our
affair, and if we go and interfere with Ali-ben-Ahmed's plans we
shall only stir up a fight with our own people.'

<p>"So when it was dark I came alone, riding one horse and
leading another for you. They are tethered not far from here. By
morning we shall be within my father's <i>douar</i>. He should be
there himself by now&mdash;then let them come and try to take
Kadour ben Saden's friend."</p>

<p>For a few moments they walked on in silence.</p>

<p>"We should be near the horses," she said. "It is strange that
I do not see them here."</p>

<p>Then a moment later she stopped, with a little cry of
consternation.</p>

<p>"They are gone!" she exclaimed. "It is here that I tethered
them."</p>

<p>Tarzan stooped to examine the ground. He found that a large
shrub had been torn up by the roots. Then he found something
else. There was a wry smile on his face as he rose and turned
toward the girl.</p>

<p>"<i>El Adrea</i> has been here. From the signs, though, I
rather think that his prey escaped him. With a little start they
would be safe enough from him in the open." There was nothing to
do but continue on foot. The way led them across a low spur of
the mountains, but the girl knew the trail as well as she did her
mother's face. They walked in easy, swinging strides, Tarzan
keeping a hand's breadth behind the girl's shoulder, that she
might set the pace, and thus be less fatigued. As they walked
they talked, occasionally stopping to listen for sounds of
pursuit.</p>

<p>It was now a beautiful, moonlit night. The air was crisp and
invigorating. Behind them lay the interminable vista of the
desert, dotted here and there with an occasional oasis. The date
palms of the little fertile spot they had just left, and the
circle of goatskin tents, stood out in sharp relief against the
yellow sand&mdash;a phantom paradise upon a phantom sea. Before
them rose the grim and silent mountains. Tarzan's blood leaped in
his veins.</p>

<p>This was life! He looked down upon the girl beside him&mdash;a
daughter of the desert walking across the face of a dead world
with a son of the jungle. He smiled at the thought. He wished
that he had had a sister, and that she had been like this girl.
What a bully chum she would have been! They had entered the
mountains now, and were progressing more slowly, for the trail
was steeper and very rocky.</p>

<p>For a few minutes they had been silent. The girl was wondering
if they would reach her father's <i>douar</i> before the pursuit
had overtaken them. Tarzan was wishing that they might walk on
thus forever. If the girl were only a man they might. He longed
for a friend who loved the same wild life that he loved. He had
learned to crave companionship, but it was his misfortune that
most of the men he knew preferred immaculate linen and their
clubs to nakedness and the jungle. It was, of course, difficult
to understand, yet it was very evident that they did.</p>

<p>The two had just turned a projecting rock around which the
trail ran when they were brought to a sudden stop. There, before
them, directly in the middle of the path, stood Numa, <i>El
Adrea</i>, the black lion. His green eyes looked very wicked, and
he bared his teeth, and lashed his bay-black sides with his angry
tail. Then he roared&mdash;the fearsome, terror-inspiring roar of
the hungry lion which is also angry.</p>

<p>"Your knife," said Tarzan to the girl, extending his hand. She
slipped the hilt of the weapon into his waiting palm. As his
fingers closed upon it he drew her back and pushed her behind
him. "Walk back to the desert as rapidly as you can. If you hear
me call you will know that all is well, and you may return."</p>

<p>"It is useless," she replied, resignedly. "This is the
end."</p>

<p>"Do as I tell you," he commanded. "Quickly! He is about to
charge." The girl dropped back a few paces, where she stood
watching for the terrible sight that she knew she should soon
witness.</p>

<p>The lion was advancing slowly toward Tarzan, his nose to the
ground, like a challenging bull, his tail extended now and
quivering as though with intense excitement.</p>

<p>The ape-man stood, half crouching, the long Arab knife
glistening in the moonlight. Behind him the tense figure of the
girl, motionless as a carven statue. She leaned slightly forward,
her lips parted, her eyes wide. Her only conscious thought was
wonder at the bravery of the man who dared face with a puny knife
the lord with the large head. A man of her own blood would have
knelt in prayer and gone down beneath those awful fangs without
resistance. In either case the result would be the same&mdash;it
was inevitable; but she could not repress a thrill of admiration
as her eyes rested upon the heroic figure before her. Not a
tremor in the whole giant frame&mdash;his attitude as menacing
and defiant as that of <i>El Adrea</i> himself.</p>

<p>The lion was quite close to him now&mdash;but a few paces
intervened&mdash;he crouched, and then, with a deafening roar, he
sprang.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap11" id="chap11">XI. &mdash; JOHN CALDWELL,
LONDON</a></h2>

<div align="center"> <img src="fr100053-images/TheReturnOfTarzan-11.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration"> </div><br>

<p class="first">As Numa <i>El Adrea</i> launched himself with
widespread paws and bared fangs he looked to find this puny man
as easy prey as the score who had gone down beneath him in the
past. To him man was a clumsy, slow-moving, defenseless
creature&mdash;he had little respect for him.</p>

<p>But this time he found that he was pitted against a creature
as agile and as quick as himself. When his mighty frame struck
the spot where the man had been he was no longer there.</p>

<p>The watching girl was transfixed by astonishment at the ease
with which the crouching man eluded the great paws. And now, O
Allah! He had rushed in behind <i>El Adrea</i>'s shoulder even
before the beast could turn, and had grasped him by the mane. The
lion reared upon his hind legs like a horse&mdash;Tarzan had
known that he would do this, and he was ready. A giant arm
encircled the black-maned throat, and once, twice, a dozen times
a sharp blade darted in and out of the bay-black side behind the
left shoulder.</p>

<p>Frantic were the leaps of Numa&mdash;awful his roars of rage
and pain; but the giant upon his back could not be dislodged or
brought within reach of fangs or talons in the brief interval of
life that remained to the lord with the large head. He was quite
dead when Tarzan of the Apes released his hold and arose. Then
the daughter of the desert witnessed a thing that terrified her
even more than had the presence of <i>El Adrea</i>. The man
placed a foot upon the carcass of his kill, and, with his
handsome face raised toward the full moon, gave voice to the most
frightful cry that ever had smote upon her ears.</p>

<p>With a little cry of fear she shrank away from him&mdash;she
thought that the fearful strain of the encounter had driven him
mad. As the last note of that fiendish challenge died out in the
diminishing echoes of the distance the man dropped his eyes until
they rested upon the girl.</p>

<p>Instantly his face was lighted by the kindly smile that was
ample assurance of his sanity, and the girl breathed freely once
again, smiling in response.</p>

<p>"What manner of man are you?" she asked. "The thing you have
done is unheard of. Even now I cannot believe that it is possible
for a lone man armed only with a knife to have fought hand to
hand with <i>El Adrea</i> and conquered him, unscathed&mdash;to
have conquered him at all. And that cry&mdash;it was not human.
Why did you do that?"</p>

<p>Tarzan flushed.</p>

<p>"It is because I forget," he said, "sometimes, that I am a
civilized man. When I kill it must be that I am another
creature."</p>

<p>He did not try to explain further, for it always seemed to him
that a woman must look with loathing upon one who was yet so
nearly a beast.</p>

<p>Together they continued their journey. The sun was an hour
high when they came out into the desert again beyond the
mountains.</p>

<p>Beside a little rivulet they found the girl's horses grazing.
They had come this far on their way home, and with the cause of
their fear no longer present had stopped to feed. With little
trouble Tarzan and the girl caught them, and, mounting, rode out
into the desert toward the <i>douar</i> of Sheik Kadour ben
Saden.</p>

<p>No sign of pursuit developed, and they came in safety about
nine o'clock to their destination. The sheik had but just
returned. He was frantic with grief at the absence of his
daughter, whom he thought had been again abducted by the
marauders. With fifty men he was already mounted to go in search
of her when the two rode into the <i>douar</i>.</p>

<p>His joy at the safe return of his daughter was only equaled by
his gratitude to Tarzan for bringing her safely to him through
the dangers of the night, and his thankfulness that she had been
in time to save the man who had once saved her.</p>

<p>No honor that Kadour ben Saden could heap upon the ape-man in
acknowledgment of his esteem and friendship was neglected. When
the girl had recited the story of the slaying of <i>El Adrea</i>
Tarzan was surrounded by a mob of worshiping Arabs&mdash;it was a
sure road to their admiration and respect.</p>

<p>The old sheik insisted that Tarzan remain indefinitely as his
guest. He even wished to adopt him as a member of the tribe, and
there was for some time a half-formed resolution in the ape-man's
mind to accept and remain forever with these wild people, whom he
understood and who seemed to understand him. His friendship and
liking for the girl were potent factors in urging him toward an
affirmative decision.</p>

<p>Had she been a man, he argued, he should not have hesitated,
for it would have meant a friend after his own heart, with whom
he could ride and hunt at will; but as it was they would be
hedged by the conventionalities that are even more strictly
observed by the wild nomads of the desert than by their more
civilized brothers and sisters. And in a little while she would
be married to one of these swarthy warriors, and there would be
an end to their friendship.</p>

<p>So he decided against the sheik's proposal, though he remained
a week as his guest.</p>

<p>When he left, Kadour ben Saden and fifty white-robed warriors
rode with him to Bou Saada. While they were mounting in the
<i>douar</i> of Kadour ben Saden the morning of their departure,
the girl came to bid farewell to Tarzan.</p>

<p>"I have prayed that you would remain with us," she said
simply, as he leaned from his saddle to clasp her hand in
farewell, "and now I shall pray that you will return." There was
an expression of wistfulness in her beautiful eyes, and a
pathetic droop at the corners of her mouth. Tarzan was
touched.</p>

<p>"Who knows?" and then he turned and rode after the departing
Arabs.</p>

<p>Outside Bou Saada he bade Kadour ben Saden and his men good-
by, for there were reasons which made him wish to make his entry
into the town as secret as possible, and when he had explained
them to the sheik the latter concurred in his decision. The Arabs
were to enter Bou Saada ahead of him, saying nothing as to his
presence with them. Later Tarzan would come in alone, and go
directly to an obscure native inn.</p>

<p>Thus, making his entrance after dark, as he did, he was not
seen by any one who knew him, and reached the inn unobserved.
After dining with Kadour ben Saden as his guest, he went to his
former hotel by a roundabout way, and, coming in by a rear
entrance, sought the proprietor, who seemed much surprised to see
him alive.</p>

<p>Yes, there was mail for monsieur; he would fetch it. No, he
would mention monsieur's return to no one. Presently he returned
with a packet of letters. One was an order from his superior to
lay off on his present work, and hasten to Cape Town by the first
steamer he could get. His further instructions would be awaiting
him there in the hands of another agent whose name and address
were given.</p>

<p>That was all&mdash;brief but explicit. Tarzan arranged to
leave Bou Saada early the next morning. Then he started for the
garrison to see Captain Gérard, whom the hotel man had told him
had returned with his detachment the previous day.</p>

<p>He found the officer in his quarters. He was filled with
surprise and pleasure at seeing Tarzan alive and well.</p>

<p>"When Lieutenant Gernois returned and reported that he had not
found you at the spot that you had chosen to remain while the
detachment was scouting, I was filled with alarm. We searched the
mountain for days. Then came word that you had been killed and
eaten by a lion. As proof your gun was brought to us. Your horse
had returned to camp the second day after your disappearance. We
could not doubt.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Gernois was grief-stricken&mdash;he took all the
blame upon himself. It was he who insisted on carrying on the
search himself. It was he who found the Arab with your gun. He
will be delighted to know that you are safe."</p>

<p>"Doubtless," said Tarzan, with a grim smile.</p>

<p>"He is down in the town now, or I should send for him,"
continued Captain Gérard. "I shall tell him as soon as he
returns." Tarzan let the officer think that he had been lost,
wandering finally into the <i>douar</i> of Kadour ben Saden, who
had escorted him back to Bou Saada. As soon as possible he bade
the good officer adieu, and hastened back into the town. At the
native inn he had learned through Kadour ben Saden a piece of
interesting information.</p>

<p>It told of a black-bearded white man who went always disguised
as an Arab. For a time he had nursed a broken wrist. More
recently he had been away from Bou Saada, but now he was back,
and Tarzan knew his place of concealment. It was for there he
headed.</p>

<p>Through narrow, stinking alleys, black as Erebus, he groped,
and then up a rickety stairway, at the end of which was a closed
door and a tiny, unglazed window. The window was high under the
low eaves of the mud building. Tarzan could just reach the sill.
He raised himself slowly until his eyes topped it. The room
within was lighted, and at a table sat Rokoff and Gernois.
Gernois was speaking.</p>

<p>"Rokoff, you are a devil!" he was saying. "You have hounded me
until I have lost the last shred of my honor. You have driven me
to murder, for the blood of that man Tarzan is on my hands. If it
were not that that other devil's spawn, Paulvitch, still knew my
secret, I should kill you here tonight with my bare hands."</p>

<p>Rokoff laughed.</p>

<p>"You would not do that, my dear lieutenant," he said.</p>

<p>"The moment I am reported dead by assassination, dear Alexis
will forward to the minister of war full proof of the affair you
so ardently long to conceal; and, further, will charge you with
my murder. Come, be sensible. I am your best friend. Have I not
protected your honor as though it were my own?" Gernois sneered,
and spat out an oath.</p>

<p>"Just one more little payment," continued Rokoff, "and the
papers I wish, and you have my word of honor that I shall never
ask another cent from you, or further information."</p>

<p>"And a good reason why," growled Gernois. "What you ask will
take my last cent, and the only valuable military secret I hold.
You ought to be paying me for the information, instead of taking
both it and money, too."</p>

<p>"I am paying you by keeping a still tongue in my head,"
retorted Rokoff. "But let's have done. Will you, or will you not?
I give you three minutes to decide. If you are not agreeable I
shall send a note to your commandant tonight that will end in the
degradation that Dreyfus suffered&mdash;the only difference being
that he did not deserve it." For a moment Gernois sat with bowed
head. At length he arose. He drew two pieces of paper from his
blouse.</p>

<p>"Here," he said hopelessly. "I had them ready, for I knew that
there could be but one outcome." He held them toward the
Russian.</p>

<p>Rokoff's cruel face lighted in malignant gloating. He seized
the bits of paper.</p>

<p>"You have done well, Gernois," he said. "I shall not trouble
you again&mdash;unless you happen to accumulate some more money
or information," and he grinned.</p>

<p>"You never shall again, you dog!" hissed Gernois. "The next
time I shall kill you. I came near doing it tonight. For an hour
I sat with these two pieces of paper on my table before me ere I
came here&mdash;beside them lay my loaded revolver. I was trying
to decide which I should bring. Next time the choice shall be
easier, for I already have decided. You had a close call tonight,
Rokoff; do not tempt fate a second time." Then Gernois rose to
leave. Tarzan barely had time to drop to the landing and shrink
back into the shadows on the far side of the door. Even then he
scarcely hoped to elude detection. The landing was very small,
and though he flattened himself against the wall at its far edge
he was scarcely more than a foot from the doorway.</p>

<p>Almost immediately it opened, and Gernois stepped out. Rokoff
was behind him. Neither spoke. Gernois had taken perhaps three
steps down the stairway when he halted and half turned, as though
to retrace his steps.</p>

<p>Tarzan knew that discovery would be inevitable. Rokoff still
stood on the threshold a foot from him, but he was looking in the
opposite direction, toward Gernois. Then the officer evidently
reconsidered his decision, and resumed his downward course.
Tarzan could hear Rokoff's sigh of relief. A moment later the
Russian went back into the room and closed the door.</p>

<p>Tarzan waited until Gernois had had time to get well out of
hearing, then he pushed open the door and stepped into the room.
He was on top of Rokoff before the man could rise from the chair
where he sat scanning the paper Gernois had given him. As his
eyes turned and fell upon the ape-man's face his own went
livid.</p>

<p>"You!" he gasped.</p>

<p>"I," replied Tarzan.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" whispered Rokoff, for the look in the ape-
man's eyes frightened him. "Have you come to kill me? You do not
dare. They would guillotine you. You do not dare kill me."</p>

<p>"I dare kill you, Rokoff," replied Tarzan, "for no one knows
that you are here or that I am here, and Paulvitch would tell
them that it was Gernois. I heard you tell Gernois so. But that
would not influence me, Rokoff. I would not care who knew that I
had killed you; the pleasure of killing you would more than
compensate for any punishment they might inflict upon me. You are
the most despicable cur of a coward, Rokoff, I have ever heard
of. You should be killed. I should love to kill you," and Tarzan
approached closer to the man.</p>

<p>Rokoff's nerves were keyed to the breaking point. With a
shriek he sprang toward an adjoining room, but the ape-man was
upon his back while his leap was yet but half completed. Iron
fingers sought his throat&mdash;the great coward squealed like a
stuck pig, until Tarzan had shut off his wind. Then the ape-man
dragged him to his feet, still choking him. The Russian struggled
futilely&mdash;he was like a babe in the mighty grasp of Tarzan
of the Apes.</p>

<p>Tarzan sat him in a chair, and long before there was danger of
the man's dying he released his hold upon his throat. When the
Russian's coughing spell had abated Tarzan spoke to him
again.</p>

<p>"I have given you a taste of the suffering of death," he
said.</p>

<p>"But I shall not kill&mdash;this time. I am sparing you solely
for the sake of a very good woman whose great misfortune it was
to have been born of the same woman who gave birth to you. But I
shall spare you only this once on her account. Should I ever
learn that you have again annoyed her or her husband&mdash;should
you ever annoy me again&mdash;should I hear that you have
returned to France or to any French possession, I shall make it
my sole business to hunt you down and complete the choking I
commenced tonight." Then he turned to the table, on which the two
pieces of paper still lay. As he picked them up Rokoff gasped in
horror.</p>

<p>Tarzan examined both the check and the other. He was amazed at
the information the latter contained. Rokoff had partially read
it, but Tarzan knew that no one could remember the salient facts
and figures it held which made it of real value to an enemy of
France.</p>

<p>"These will interest the chief of staff," he said, as he
slipped them into his pocket. Rokoff groaned. He did not dare
curse aloud.</p>

<p>The next morning Tarzan rode north on his way to Bouira and
Algiers.</p>

<p>As he had ridden past the hotel Lieutenant Gernois was
standing on the veranda. As his eyes discovered Tarzan he went
white as chalk.</p>

<p>The ape-man would have been glad had the meeting not occurred,
but he could not avoid it. He saluted the officer as he rode
past.</p>

<p>Mechanically Gernois returned the salute, but those terrible,
wide eyes followed the horseman, expressionless except for
horror. It was as though a dead man looked upon a ghost.</p>

<p>At Sidi Aissa Tarzan met a French officer with whom he had
become acquainted on the occasion of his recent sojourn in the
town.</p>

<p>"You left Bou Saada early?" questioned the officer. "Then you
have not heard about poor Gernois."</p>

<p>"He was the last man I saw as I rode away," replied Tarzan.
"What about him?"</p>

<p>"He is dead. He shot himself about eight o'clock this
morning." Two days later Tarzan reached Algiers. There he found
that he would have a two days' wait before he could catch a ship
bound for Cape Town. He occupied his time in writing out a full
report of his mission. The secret papers he had taken from Rokoff
he did not inclose, for he did not dare trust them out of his own
possession until he had been authorized to turn them over to
another agent, or himself return to Paris with them.</p>

<p>As Tarzan boarded his ship after what seemed a most tedious
wait to him, two men watched him from an upper deck. Both were
fashionably dressed and smooth shaven. The taller of the two had
sandy hair, but his eyebrows were very black. Later in the day
they chanced to meet Tarzan on deck, but as one hurriedly called
his companion's attention to something at sea their faces were
turned from Tarzan as he passed, so that he did not notice their
features. In fact, he had paid no attention to them at all.</p>

<p>Following the instructions of his chief, Tarzan had booked his
passage under an assumed name&mdash;John Caldwell, London. He did
not understand the necessity of this, and it caused him
considerable speculation. He wondered what role he was to play in
Cape Town.</p>

<p>"Well," he thought, "thank Heaven that I am rid of Rokoff. He
was commencing to annoy me. I wonder if I am really becoming so
civilized that presently I shall develop a set of nerves. He
would give them to me if any one could, for he does not fight
fair. One never knows through what new agency he is going to
strike. It is as though Numa, the lion, had induced Tantor, the
elephant, and Histah, the snake, to join him in attempting to
kill me. I would then never have known what minute, or by whom, I
was to be attacked next. But the brutes are more chivalrous than
man&mdash;they do not stoop to cowardly intrigue." At dinner that
night Tarzan sat next to a young woman whose place was at the
captain's left. The officer introduced them.</p>

<p>Miss Strong! Where had he heard the name before? It was very
familiar. And then the girl's mother gave him the clew, for when
she addressed her daughter she called her Hazel.</p>

<p>Hazel Strong! What memories the name inspired. It had been a
letter to this girl, penned by the fair hand of Jane Porter, that
had carried to him the first message from the woman he loved. How
vividly he recalled the night he had stolen it from the desk in
the cabin of his long-dead father, where Jane Porter had sat
writing it late into the night, while he crouched in the darkness
without.</p>

<p>How terror-stricken she would have been that night had she
known that the wild jungle beast squatted outside her window,
watching her every move.</p>

<p>And this was Hazel Strong&mdash;Jane Porter's best friend!</p>

PASS</a></h2>

<div align="center"> <img src="fr100053-images/TheReturnOfTarzan-12.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration"> </div><br>

<p class="first">Let us go back a few months to the little,
windswept platform of a railway station in northern Wisconsin.
The smoke of forest fires hangs low over the surrounding
landscape, its acrid fumes smarting the eyes of a little party of
six who stand waiting the coming of the train that is to bear
them away toward the south.</p>

<p>Professor Archimedes Q. Porter, his hands clasped beneath the
tails of his long coat, paces back and forth under the ever-
watchful eye of his faithful secretary, Mr. Samuel T. Philander.
Twice within the past few minutes he has started absent-mindedly
across the tracks in the direction of a near-by swamp, only to be
rescued and dragged back by the tireless Mr. Philander.</p>

<p>Jane Porter, the professor's daughter, is in strained and
lifeless conversation with William Cecil Clayton and Tarzan of
the Apes.</p>

<p>Within the little waiting room, but a bare moment before, a
confession of love and a renunciation had taken place that had
blighted the lives and happiness of two of the party, but William
Cecil Clayton, Lord Greystoke, was not one of them.</p>

<p>Behind Miss Porter hovered the motherly Esmeralda. She, too,
was happy, for was she not returning to her beloved Maryland?
Already she could see dimly through the fog of smoke the murky
headlight of the oncoming engine. The men began to gather up the
hand baggage.</p>

<p>Suddenly Clayton exclaimed.</p>

<p>"By Jove! I've left my ulster in the waiting-room," and
hastened off to fetch it.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Jane," said Tarzan, extending his hand. "God bless
you!"</p>

<p>"Good-bye," replied the girl faintly. "Try to forget
me&mdash;no, not that&mdash;I could not bear to think that you
had forgotten me."</p>

<p>"There is no danger of that, dear," he answered. "I wish to
Heaven that I might forget. It would be so much easier than to go
through life always remembering what might have been. You will be
happy, though; I am sure you shall&mdash;you must be. You may
tell the others of my decision to drive my car on to New
York&mdash;I don't feel equal to bidding Clayton good-bye. I want
always to remember him kindly, but I fear that I am too much of a
wild beast yet to be trusted too long with the man who stands
between me and the one person in all the world I want." As
Clayton stooped to pick up his coat in the waiting room his eyes
fell on a telegraph blank lying face down upon the floor. He
stooped to pick it up, thinking it might be a message of
importance which some one had dropped. He glanced at it hastily,
and then suddenly he forgot his coat, the approaching
train&mdash;everything but that terrible little piece of yellow
paper in his hand. He read it twice before he could fully grasp
the terrific weight of meaning that it bore to him.</p>

<p>When he had picked it up he had been an English nobleman, the
proud and wealthy possessor of vast estates&mdash;a moment later
he had read it, and he knew that he was an untitled and penniless
beggar. It was D'Arnot's cablegram to Tarzan, and it
read:</p><br>

<p class="telegram">FINGER-PRINTS PROVE YOU GREYSTOKE.
CONGRATULATIONS. D'ARNOT.</p><br>

<p>He staggered as though he had received a mortal blow. Just
then he heard the others calling to him to hurry&mdash;the train
was coming to a stop at the little platform. Like a man dazed he
gathered up his ulster. He would tell them about the cablegram
when they were all on board the train. Then he ran out upon the
platform just as the engine whistled twice in the final warning
that precedes the first rumbling jerk of coupling pins. The
others were on board, leaning out from the platform of a Pullman,
crying to him to hurry.</p>

<p>Quite five minutes elapsed before they were settled in their
seats, nor was it until then that Clayton discovered that Tarzan
was not with them.</p>

<p>"Where is Tarzan?" he asked Jane Porter. "In another car?"</p>

<p>"No," she replied; "at the last minute he determined to drive
his machine back to New York. He is anxious to see more of
America than is possible from a car window. He is returning to
France, you know." Clayton did not reply. He was trying to find
the right words to explain to Jane Porter the calamity that had
befallen him&mdash;and her. He wondered just what the effect of
his knowledge would be on her. Would she still wish to marry
him&mdash;to be plain Mrs. Clayton? Suddenly the awful sacrifice
which one of them must make loomed large before his imagination.
Then came the question: Will Tarzan claim his own? The ape-man
had known the contents of the message before he calmly denied
knowledge of his parentage! He had admitted that Kala, the ape,
was his mother! Could it have been for love of Jane Porter? There
was no other explanation which seemed reasonable. Then, having
ignored the evidence of the message, was it not reasonable to
assume that he meant never to claim his birthright? If this were
so, what right had he, William Cecil Clayton, to thwart the
wishes, to balk the self-sacrifice of this strange man? If Tarzan
of the Apes could do this thing to save Jane Porter from
unhappiness, why should he, to whose care she was intrusting her
whole future, do aught to jeopardize her interests? And so he
reasoned until the first generous impulse to proclaim the truth
and relinquish his titles and his estates to their rightful owner
was forgotten beneath the mass of sophistries which self-interest
had advanced. But during the balance of the trip, and for many
days thereafter, he was moody and distraught. Occasionally the
thought obtruded itself that possibly at some later day Tarzan
would regret his magnanimity, and claim his rights.</p>

<p>Several days after they reached Baltimore Clayton broached the
subject of an early marriage to Jane.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by early?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Within the next few days. I must return to England at
once&mdash;I want you to return with me, dear."</p>

<p>"I can't get ready so soon as that," replied Jane. "It will
take a whole month, at least." She was glad, for she hoped that
whatever called him to England might still further delay the
wedding. She had made a bad bargain, but she intended carrying
her part loyally to the bitter end&mdash;if she could manage to
secure a temporary reprieve, though, she felt that she was
warranted in doing so. His reply disconcerted her.</p>

<p>"Very well, Jane," he said. "I am disappointed, but I shall
let my trip to England wait a month; then we can go back
together." But when the month was drawing to a close she found
still another excuse upon which to hang a postponement, until at
last, discouraged and doubting, Clayton was forced to go back to
England alone.</p>

<p>The several letters that passed between them brought Clayton
no nearer to a consummation of his hopes than he had been before,
and so it was that he wrote directly to Professor Porter, and
enlisted his services. The old man had always favored the match.
He liked Clayton, and, being of an old southern family, he put
rather an exaggerated value on the advantages of a title, which
meant little or nothing to his daughter.</p>

<p>Clayton urged that the professor accept his invitation to be
his guest in London, an invitation which included the professor's
entire little family&mdash;Mr. Philander, Esmeralda, and all. The
Englishman argued that once Jane was there, and home ties had
been broken, she would not so dread the step which she had so
long hesitated to take.</p>

<p>So the evening that he received Clayton's letter Professor
Porter announced that they would leave for London the following
week.</p>

<p>But once in London Jane Porter was no more tractable than she
had been in Baltimore. She found one excuse after another, and
when, finally, Lord Tennington invited the party to cruise around
Africa in his yacht, she expressed the greatest delight in the
idea, but absolutely refused to be married until they had
returned to London.</p>

<p>As the cruise was to consume a year at least, for they were to
stop for indefinite periods at various points of interest,
Clayton mentally anathematized Tennington for ever suggesting
such a ridiculous trip.</p>

<p>It was Lord Tennington's plan to cruise through the
Mediterranean and the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean, and thus down
the East Coast, putting in at every port that was worth the
seeing.</p>

<p>And so it happened that on a certain day two vessels passed in
the Strait of Gibraltar. The smaller, a trim white yacht, was
speeding toward the east, and on her deck sat a young woman who
gazed with sad eyes upon a diamond-studded locket which she idly
fingered. Her thoughts were far away, in the dim, leafy fastness
of a tropical jungle&mdash;and her heart was with her
thoughts.</p>

<p>She wondered if the man who had given her the beautiful
bauble, that had meant so much more to him than the intrinsic
value which he had not even known could ever have meant to him,
was back in his savage forest.</p>

<p>And upon the deck of the larger vessel, a passenger steamer
passing toward the west, the man sat with another young woman,
and the two idly speculated upon the identity of the dainty craft
gliding so gracefully through the gentle swell of the lazy
sea.</p>

<p>When the yacht had passed the man resumed the conversation
that her appearance had broken off.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I like America very much, and that means, of
course, that I like Americans, for a country is only what its
people make it. I met some very delightful people while I was
there. I recall one family from your own city, Miss Strong, whom
I liked particularly&mdash;Professor Porter and his
daughter."</p>

<p>"Jane Porter!" exclaimed the girl. "Do you mean to tell me
that you know Jane Porter? Why, she is the very best friend I
have in the world. We were little children together&mdash;we have
known each other for ages."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" he answered, smiling. "You would have difficulty in
persuading any one of the fact who had seen either of you."</p>

<p>"I'll qualify the statement, then," she answered, with a
laugh. "We have known each other for two ages&mdash;hers and
mine. But seriously we are as dear to each other as sisters, and
now that I am going to lose her I am almost heartbroken."</p>

<p>"Going to lose her?" exclaimed Tarzan. "Why, what do you mean?
Oh, yes, I understand. You mean that now that she is married and
living in England, you will seldom if ever see her."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied she, "and the saddest part of it all is that
she is not marrying the man she loves. Oh, it is terrible.
Marrying from a sense of duty! I think it is perfectly wicked,
and I told her so. I have felt so strongly on the subject that
although I was the only person outside of blood relations who was
to have been asked to the wedding I would not let her invite me,
for I should not have gone to witness the terrible mockery. But
Jane Porter is peculiarly positive. She has convinced herself
that she is doing the only honorable thing that she can do, and
nothing in the world will ever prevent her from marrying Lord
Greystoke except Greystoke himself, or death."</p>

<p>"I am sorry for her," said Tarzan.</p>

<p>"And I am sorry for the man she loves," said the girl, "for he
loves her. I never met him, but from what Jane tells me he must
be a very wonderful person. It seems that he was born in an
African jungle, and brought up by fierce, anthropoid apes. He had
never seen a white man or woman until Professor Porter and his
party were marooned on the coast right at the threshold of his
tiny cabin.</p>

<p>"He saved them from all manner of terrible beasts, and
accomplished the most wonderful feats imaginable, and then to cap
the climax he fell in love with Jane and she with him, though she
never really knew it for sure until she had promised herself to
Lord Greystoke."</p>

<p>"Most remarkable," murmured Tarzan, cudgeling his brain for
some pretext upon which to turn the subject. He delighted in
hearing Hazel Strong talk of Jane, but when he was the subject of
the conversation he was bored and embarrassed. But he was soon
given a respite, for the girl's mother joined them, and the talk
became general.</p>

<p>The next few days passed uneventfully. The sea was quiet. The
sky was clear. The steamer plowed steadily on toward the south
without pause. Tarzan spent quite a little time with Miss Strong
and her mother. They whiled away their hours on deck reading,
talking, or taking pictures with Miss Strong's camera. When the
sun had set they walked.</p>

<p>One day Tarzan found Miss Strong in conversation with a
stranger, a man he had not seen on board before. As he approached
the couple the man bowed to the girl and turned to walk away.</p>

<p>"Wait, Monsieur Thuran," said Miss Strong; "you must meet Mr.
Caldwell. We are all fellow passengers, and should be
acquainted."</p>

<p>The two men shook hands. As Tarzan looked into the eyes of
Monsieur Thuran he was struck by the strange familiarity of their
expression.</p>

<p>"I have had the honor of monsieur's acquaintance in the past,
I am sure," said Tarzan, "though I cannot recall the
circumstances." Monsieur Thuran appeared ill at ease.</p>

<p>"I cannot say, monsieur," he replied. "It may be so. I have
had that identical sensation myself when meeting a stranger."</p>

<p>"Monsieur Thuran has been explaining some of the mysteries of
navigation to me," explained the girl.</p>

<p>Tarzan paid little heed to the conversation that
ensued&mdash;he was attempting to recall where he had met
Monsieur Thuran before. That it had been under peculiar
circumstances he was positive. Presently the sun reached them,
and the girl asked Monsieur Thuran to move her chair farther back
into the shade. Tarzan happened to be watching the man at the
time, and noticed the awkward manner in which he handled the
chair&mdash;his left wrist was stiff. That clew was
sufficient&mdash;a sudden train of associated ideas did the
rest.</p>

<p>Monsieur Thuran had been trying to find an excuse to make a
graceful departure. The lull in the conversation following the
moving of their position gave him an opportunity to make his
excuses. Bowing low to Miss Strong, and inclining his head to
Tarzan, he turned to leave them.</p>

<p>"Just a moment," said Tarzan. "If Miss Strong will pardon me I
will accompany you. I shall return in a moment, Miss Strong."
Monsieur Thuran looked uncomfortable. When the two men had passed
out of the girl's sight, Tarzan stopped, laying a heavy hand on
the other's shoulder.</p>

<p>"What is your game now, Rokoff?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am leaving France as I promised you," replied the other, in
a surly voice.</p>

<p>"I see you are," said Tarzan; "but I know you so well that I
can scarcely believe that your being on the same boat with me is
purely a coincidence. If I could believe it the fact that you are
in disguise would immediately disabuse my mind of any such
idea."</p>

<p>"Well," growled Rokoff, with a shrug, "I cannot see what you
are going to do about it. This vessel flies the English flag. I
have as much right on board her as you, and from the fact that
you are booked under an assumed name I imagine that I have more
right."</p>

<p>"We will not discuss it, Rokoff. All I wanted to say to you is
that you must keep away from Miss Strong&mdash;she is a decent
woman." Rokoff turned scarlet.</p>

<p>"If you don't I shall pitch you overboard," continued Tarzan.
"Do not forget that I am just waiting for some excuse." Then he
turned on his heel, and left Rokoff standing there trembling with
suppressed rage.</p>

<p>He did not see the man again for days, but Rokoff was not
idle. In his stateroom with Paulvitch he fumed and swore,
threatening the most terrible of revenges.</p>

<p>"I would throw him overboard tonight," he cried, "were I sure
that those papers were not on his person. I cannot chance
pitching them into the ocean with him. If you were not such a
stupid coward, Alexis, you would find a way to enter his
stateroom and search for the documents."</p>

<p>Paulvitch smiled.</p>

<p>"You are supposed to be the brains of this partnership, my
dear Nikolas," he replied. "Why do you not find the means to
search Monsieur Caldwell's stateroom&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>Two hours later fate was kind to them, for Paulvitch, who was
ever on the watch, saw Tarzan leave his room without locking the
door.</p>

<p>Five minutes later Rokoff was stationed where he could give
the alarm in case Tarzan returned, and Paulvitch was deftly
searching the contents of the ape-man's luggage.</p>

<p>He was about to give up in despair when he saw a coat which
Tarzan had just removed. A moment later he grasped an official
envelope in his hand. A quick glance at its contents brought a
broad smile to the Russian's face.</p>

<p>When he left the stateroom Tarzan himself could not have told
that an article in it had been touched since he left
it&mdash;Paulvitch was a past master in his chosen field. When he
handed the packet to Rokoff in the seclusion of their stateroom
the larger man rang for a steward, and ordered a pint of
champagne.</p>

<p>"We must celebrate, my dear Alexis," he said.</p>

<p>"It was luck, Nikolas," explained Paulvitch. "It is evident
that he carries these papers always upon his person&mdash;just by
chance he neglected to transfer them when he changed coats a few
minutes since. But there will be the deuce to pay when he
discovers his loss. I am afraid that he will immediately connect
you with it. Now that he knows that you are on board he will
suspect you at once."</p>

<p>"It will make no difference whom he suspects&mdash;after
tonight," said Rokoff, with a nasty grin.</p>

<p>After Miss Strong had gone below that night Tarzan stood
leaning over the rail looking far out to sea. Every night he had
done this since he had come on board&mdash;sometimes he stood
thus for an hour.</p>

<p>And the eyes that had been watching his every movement since
he had boarded the ship at Algiers knew that this was his
habit.</p>

<p>Even as he stood there this night those eyes were on him.
Presently the last straggler had left the deck. It was a clear
night, but there was no moon&mdash;objects on deck were barely
discernible.</p>

<p>From the shadows of the cabin two figures crept stealthily
upon the ape-man from behind. The lapping of the waves against
the ship's sides, the whirring of the propeller, the throbbing of
the engines, drowned the almost soundless approach of the
two.</p>

<p>They were quite close to him now, and crouching low, like
tacklers on a gridiron. One of them raised his hand and lowered
it, as though counting off
seconds&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;three! As one man the two
leaped for their victim. Each grasped a leg, and before Tarzan of
the Apes, lightning though he was, could turn to save himself he
had been pitched over the low rail and was falling into the
Atlantic.</p>

<p>Hazel Strong was looking from her darkened port across the
dark sea. Suddenly a body shot past her eyes from the deck above.
It dropped so quickly into the dark waters below that she could
not be sure of what it was&mdash;it might have been a man, she
could not say.</p>

<p>She listened for some outcry from above&mdash;for the always-
fearsome call, "Man overboard!" but it did not come. All was
silence on the ship above&mdash;all was silence in the sea
below.</p>

<p>The girl decided that she had but seen a bundle of refuse
thrown overboard by one of the ship's crew, and a moment later
sought her berth.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap13" id="chap13">XIII. &mdash; THE WRECK OF THE
"LADY ALICE"</a></h2>

<div align="center"> <img src="fr100053-images/TheReturnOfTarzan-13.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration"> </div><br>

<p class="first">The next morning at breakfast Tarzan's place was
vacant. Miss Strong was mildly curious, for Mr. Caldwell had
always made it a point to wait that he might breakfast with her
and her mother. As she was sitting on deck later Monsieur Thuran
paused to exchange a half dozen pleasant words with her. He
seemed in most excellent spirits&mdash;his manner was the extreme
of affability. As he passed on Miss Strong thought what a very
delightful man was Monsieur Thuran.</p>

<p>The day dragged heavily. She missed the quiet companionship of
Mr. Caldwell&mdash;there had been something about him that had
made the girl like him from the first; he had talked so
entertainingly of the places he had seen&mdash;the peoples and
their customs&mdash;the wild beasts; and he had always had a
droll way of drawing striking comparisons between savage animals
and civilized men that showed a considerable knowledge of the
former, and a keen, though somewhat cynical, estimate of the
latter.</p>

<p>When Monsieur Thuran stopped again to chat with her in the
afternoon she welcomed the break in the day's monotony. But she
had begun to become seriously concerned in Mr. Caldwell's
continued absence; somehow she constantly associated it with the
start she had had the night before, when the dark object fell
past her port into the sea. Presently she broached the subject to
Monsieur Thuran. Had he seen Mr. Caldwell today? He had not. Why?
"He was not at breakfast as usual, nor have I seen him once since
yesterday," explained the girl.</p>

<p>Monsieur Thuran was extremely solicitous.</p>

<p>"I did not have the pleasure of intimate acquaintance with Mr.
Caldwell," he said. "He seemed a most estimable gentleman,
however. Can it be that he is indisposed, and has remained in his
stateroom? It would not be strange."</p>

<p>"No," replied the girl, "it would not be strange, of course;
but for some inexplicable reason I have one of those foolish
feminine presentiments that all is not right with Mr. Caldwell.
It is the strangest feeling&mdash;it is as though I knew that he
was not on board the ship."</p>

<p>Monsieur Thuran laughed pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Mercy, my dear Miss Strong," he said; "where in the world
could he be then? We have not been within sight of land for
days."</p>

<p>"Of course, it is ridiculous of me," she admitted. And then:
"But I am not going to worry about it any longer; I am going to
find out where Mr. Caldwell is," and she motioned to a passing
steward.</p>

<p>"That may be more difficult than you imagine, my dear girl,"
thought Monsieur Thuran, but aloud he said: "By all means."</p>

<p>"Find Mr. Caldwell, please," she said to the steward, "and
tell him that his friends are much worried by his continued
absence."</p>

<p>"You are very fond of Mr. Caldwell?" suggested Monsieur
Thuran.</p>

<p>"I think he is splendid," replied the girl. "And mamma is
perfectly infatuated with him. He is the sort of man with whom
one has a feeling of perfect security&mdash;no one could help but
have confidence in Mr. Caldwell."</p>

<p>A moment later the steward returned to say that Mr. Caldwell
was not in his stateroom.</p>

<p>"I cannot find him, Miss Strong, and"&mdash;he
hesitated&mdash;"I have learned that his berth was not occupied
last night. I think that I had better report the matter to the
captain."</p>

<p>"Most assuredly," exclaimed Miss Strong. "I shall go with you
to the captain myself. It is terrible! I know that something
awful has happened. My presentiments were not false, after
all."</p>

<p>It was a very frightened young woman and an excited steward
who presented themselves before the captain a few moments later.
He listened to their stories in silence&mdash;a look of concern
marking his expression as the steward assured him that he had
sought for the missing passenger in every part of the ship that a
passenger might be expected to frequent.</p>

<p>"And are you sure, Miss Strong, that you saw a body fall
overboard last night?" he asked.</p>

<p>"There is not the slightest doubt about that," she answered.
"I cannot say that it was a human body&mdash;there was no outcry.
It might have been only what I thought it was&mdash;a bundle of
refuse. But if Mr. Caldwell is not found on board I shall always
be positive that it was he whom I saw fall past my port."</p>

<p>The captain ordered an immediate and thorough search of the
entire ship from stem to stern&mdash;no nook or cranny was to be
overlooked.</p>

<p>Miss Strong remained in his cabin, waiting the outcome of the
quest. The captain asked her many questions, but she could tell
him nothing about the missing man other than what she had herself
seen during their brief acquaintance on shipboard. For the first
time she suddenly realized how very little indeed Mr. Caldwell
had told her about himself or his past life. That he had been
born in Africa and educated in Paris was about all she knew, and
this meager information had been the result of her surprise that
an Englishman should speak English with such a marked French
accent.</p>

<p>"Did he ever speak of any enemies?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"Was he acquainted with any of the other passengers?"</p>

<p>"Only as he had been with me&mdash;through the circumstance of
casual meeting as fellow shipmates."</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;was he, in your opinion, Miss Strong, a man who
drank to excess?"</p>

<p>"I do not know that he drank at all&mdash;he certainly had not
been drinking up to half an hour before I saw that body fall
overboard," she answered, "for I was with him on deck up to that
time."</p>

<p>"It is very strange," said the captain. "He did not look to me
like a man who was subject to fainting spells, or anything of
that sort. And even had he been it is scarcely credible that he
should have fallen completely over the rail had he been taken
with an attack while leaning upon it&mdash;he would rather have
fallen inside, upon the deck. If he is not on board, Miss Strong,
he was thrown overboard&mdash;and the fact that you heard no
outcry would lead to the assumption that he was dead before he
left the ship's deck&mdash;murdered." The girl shuddered.</p>

<p>It was a full hour later that the first officer returned to
report the outcome of the search.</p>

<p>"Mr. Caldwell is not on board, sir," he said.</p>

<p>"I fear that there is something more serious than accident
here, Mr. Brently," said the captain. "I wish that you would make
a personal and very careful examination of Mr. Caldwell's
effects, to ascertain if there is any clew to a motive either for
suicide or murder&mdash;sift the thing to the bottom."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir!" responded Mr. Brently, and left to commence
his investigation.</p>

<p>Hazel Strong was prostrated. For two days she did not leave
her cabin, and when she finally ventured on deck she was very wan
and white, with great, dark circles beneath her eyes. Waking or
sleeping, it seemed that she constantly saw that dark body
dropping, swift and silent, into the cold, grim sea.</p>

<p>Shortly after her first appearance on deck following the
tragedy, Monsieur Thuran joined her with many expressions of
kindly solicitude.</p>

<p>"Oh, but it is terrible, Miss Strong," he said. "I cannot rid
my mind of it."</p>

<p>"Nor I," said the girl wearily. "I feel that he might have
been saved had I but given the alarm."</p>

<p>"You must not reproach yourself, my dear Miss Strong," urged
Monsieur Thuran. "It was in no way your fault. Another would have
done as you did. Who would think that because something fell into
the sea from a ship that it must necessarily be a man? Nor would
the outcome have been different had you given an alarm. For a
while they would have doubted your story, thinking it but the
nervous hallucination of a woman&mdash;had you insisted it would
have been too late to have rescued him by the time the ship could
have been brought to a stop, and the boats lowered and rowed back
miles in search of the unknown spot where the tragedy had
occurred. No, you must not censure yourself. You have done more
than any other of us for poor Mr. Caldwell&mdash;you were the
only one to miss him. It was you who instituted the search."</p>

<p>The girl could not help but feel grateful to him for his kind
and encouraging words. He was with her often&mdash;almost
constantly for the remainder of the voyage&mdash;and she grew to
like him very much indeed.</p>

<p>Monsieur Thuran had learned that the beautiful Miss Strong, of
Baltimore, was an American heiress&mdash;a very wealthy girl in
her own right, and with future prospects that quite took his
breath away when he contemplated them, and since he spent most of
his time in that delectable pastime it is a wonder that he
breathed at all.</p>

<p>It had been Monsieur Thuran's intention to leave the ship at
the first port they touched after the disappearance of Tarzan.
Did he not have in his coat pocket the thing he had taken passage
upon this very boat to obtain? There was nothing more to detain
him here. He could not return to the Continent fast enough, that
he might board the first express for St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>But now another idea had obtruded itself, and was rapidly
crowding his original intentions into the background. That
American fortune was not to be sneezed at, nor was its possessor
a whit less attractive.</p>

<p>"<i>Sapristi!</i> but she would cause a sensation in St.
Petersburg." And he would, too, with the assistance of her
inheritance.</p>

<p>After Monsieur Thuran had squandered a few million dollars, he
discovered that the vocation was so entirely to his liking that
he would continue on down to Cape Town, where he suddenly decided
that he had pressing engagements that might detain him there for
some time.</p>

<p>Miss Strong had told him that she and her mother were to visit
the latter's brother there&mdash;they had not decided upon the
duration of their stay, and it would probably run into
months.</p>

<p>She was delighted when she found that Monsieur Thuran was to
be there also.</p>

<p>"I hope that we shall be able to continue our acquaintance,"
she said. "You must call upon mamma and me as soon as we are
settled." Monsieur Thuran was delighted at the prospect, and lost
no time in saying so. Mrs. Strong was not quite so favorably
impressed by him as her daughter.</p>

<p>"I do not know why I should distrust him," she said to Hazel
one day as they were discussing him. "He seems a perfect
gentleman in every respect, but sometimes there is something
about his eyes&mdash;a fleeting expression which I cannot
describe, but which when I see it gives me a very uncanny
feeling."</p>

<p>The girl laughed.</p>

<p>"You are a silly dear, mamma," she said.</p>

<p>"I suppose so, but I am sorry that we have not poor Mr.
Caldwell for company instead."</p>

<p>"And I, too," replied her daughter.</p>

<p>Monsieur Thuran became a frequent visitor at the home of Hazel
Strong's uncle in Cape Town. His attentions were very marked, but
they were so punctiliously arranged to meet the girl's every wish
that she came to depend upon him more and more. Did she or her
mother or a cousin require an escort&mdash;was there a little
friendly service to be rendered, the genial and ubiquitous
Monsieur Thuran was always available. Her uncle and his family
grew to like him for his unfailing courtesy and willingness to be
of service. Monsieur Thuran was becoming indispensable. At
length, feeling the moment propitious, he proposed. Miss Strong
was startled. She did not know what to say.</p>

<p>"I had never thought that you cared for me in any such way,"
she told him. "I have looked upon you always as a very dear
friend. I shall not give you my answer now. Forget that you have
asked me to be your wife. Let us go on as we have been&mdash;then
I can consider you from an entirely different angle for a time.
It may be that I shall discover that my feeling for you is more
than friendship. I certainly have not thought for a moment that I
loved you."</p>

<p>This arrangement was perfectly satisfactory to Monsieur
Thuran. He deeply regretted that he had been hasty, but he had
loved her for so long a time, and so devotedly, that he thought
that every one must know it.</p>

<p>"From the first time I saw you, Hazel," he said, "I have loved
you. I am willing to wait, for I am certain that so great and
pure a love as mine will be rewarded. All that I care to know is
that you do not love another. Will you tell me?"</p>

<p>"I have never been in love in my life," she replied, and he
was quite satisfied. On the way home that night he purchased a
steam yacht, and built a million-dollar villa on the Black
Sea.</p>

<p>The next day Hazel Strong enjoyed one of the happiest
surprises of her life&mdash;she ran face to face upon Jane Porter
as she was coming out of a jeweler's shop.</p>

<p>"Why, Jane Porter!" she exclaimed. "Where in the world did you
drop from? Why, I can't believe my own eyes."</p>

<p>"Well, of all things!" cried the equally astonished Jane. "And
here I have been wasting whole reams of perfectly good
imagination picturing you in Baltimore&mdash;the very idea!" And
she threw her arms about her friend once more, and kissed her a
dozen times.</p>

<p>By the time mutual explanations had been made Hazel knew that
Lord Tennington's yacht had put in at Cape Town for at least a
week's stay, and at the end of that time was to continue on her
voyage&mdash;this time up the West Coast&mdash;and so back to
England. "Where," concluded Jane, "I am to be married."</p>

<p>"Then you are not married yet?" asked Hazel.</p>

<p>"Not yet," replied Jane, and then, quite irrelevantly, "I wish
England were a million miles from here." Visits were exchanged
between the yacht and Hazel's relatives.</p>

<p>Dinners were arranged, and trips into the surrounding country
to entertain the visitors. Monsieur Thuran was a welcome guest at
every function. He gave a dinner himself to the men of the party,
and managed to ingratiate himself in the good will of Lord
Tennington by many little acts of hospitality.</p>

<p>Monsieur Thuran had heard dropped a hint of something which
might result from this unexpected visit of Lord Tennington's
yacht, and he wanted to be counted in on it. Once when he was
alone with the Englishman he took occasion to make it quite plain
that his engagement to Miss Strong was to be announced
immediately upon their return to America. "But not a word of it,
my dear Tennington&mdash;not a word of it."</p>

<p>"Certainly, I quite understand, my dear fellow," Tennington
had replied. "But you are to be congratulated&mdash;ripping girl,
don't you know&mdash;really." The next day it came. Mrs. Strong,
Hazel, and Monsieur Thuran were Lord Tennington's guests aboard
his yacht. Mrs. Strong had been telling them how much she had
enjoyed her visit at Cape Town, and that she regretted that a
letter just received from her attorneys in Baltimore had
necessitated her cutting her visit shorter than they had
intended.</p>

<p>"When do you sail?" asked Tennington.</p>

<p>"The first of the week, I think," she replied.</p>

<p>"Indeed?" exclaimed Monsieur Thuran. "I am very fortunate. I,
too, have found that I must return at once, and now I shall have
the honor of accompanying and serving you."</p>

<p>"That is nice of you, Monsieur Thuran," replied Mrs. Strong.
"I am sure that we shall be glad to place ourselves under your
protection."</p>

<p>But in the bottom of her heart was the wish that they might
escape him. Why, she could not have told.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" ejaculated Lord Tennington, a moment later. "Bully
idea, by Jove!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Tennington, of course," ventured Clayton; "it must be a
bully idea if you had it, but what the deuce is it? Goin' to
steam to China via the south pole?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I say now, Clayton," returned Tennington, "you needn't be
so rough on a fellow just because you didn't happen to suggest
this trip yourself&mdash;you've acted a regular bounder ever
since we sailed.</p>

<p>"No, sir," he continued, "it's a bully idea, and you'll all
say so. It's to take Mrs. Strong and Miss Strong, and Thuran,
too, if he'll come, as far as England with us on the yacht. Now,
isn't that a corker?"</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Tenny, old boy," cried Clayton. "It certainly
<i>is</i> a corking idea&mdash;I never should have suspected you
of it. You're quite sure it's original, are you?"</p>

<p>"And we'll sail the first of the week, or any other time that
suits your convenience, Mrs. Strong," concluded the big-hearted
Englishman, as though the thing were all arranged except the
sailing date.</p>

<p>"Mercy, Lord Tennington, you haven't even given us an
opportunity to thank you, much less decide whether we shall be
able to accept your generous invitation," said Mrs. Strong.</p>

<p>"Why, of course you'll come," responded Tennington. "We'll
make as good time as any passenger boat, and you'll be fully as
comfortable; and, anyway, we all want you, and won't take no for
an answer."</p>

<p>And so it was settled that they should sail the following
Monday.</p>

<p>Two days out the girls were sitting in Hazel's cabin, looking
at some prints she had had finished in Cape Town. They
represented all the pictures she had taken since she had left
America, and the girls were both engrossed in them, Jane asking
many questions, and Hazel keeping up a perfect torrent of comment
and explanation of the various scenes and people.</p>

<p>"And here," she said suddenly, "here's a man you know. Poor
fellow, I have so often intended asking you about him, but I
never have been able to think of it when we were together." She
was holding the little print so that Jane did not see the face of
the man it portrayed.</p>

<p>"His name was John Caldwell," continued Hazel. "Do you recall
him? He said that he met you in America. He is an
Englishman."</p>

<p>"I do not recollect the name," replied Jane. "Let me see the
picture."</p>

<p>"The poor fellow was lost overboard on our trip down the
coast," she said, as she handed the print to Jane.</p>

<p>"Lost over&mdash;Why, Hazel, Hazel&mdash;don't tell me that he
is dead&mdash;drowned at sea! Hazel! Why don't you say that you
are joking!" And before the astonished Miss Strong could catch
her Jane Porter had slipped to the floor in a swoon.</p>

<p>After Hazel had restored her chum to consciousness she sat
looking at her for a long time before either spoke.</p>

<p>"I did not know, Jane," said Hazel, in a constrained voice,
"that you knew Mr. Caldwell so intimately that his death could
prove such a shock to you."</p>

<p>"John Caldwell?" questioned Miss Porter. "You do not mean to
tell me that you do not know who this man was, Hazel?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, Jane; I know perfectly well who he was&mdash;his
name was John Caldwell; he was from London."</p>

<p>"Oh, Hazel, I wish I could believe it," moaned the girl. "I
wish I could believe it, but those features are burned so deep
into my memory and my heart that I should recognize them anywhere
in the world from among a thousand others, who might appear
identical to any one but me."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Jane?" cried Hazel, now thoroughly
alarmed.</p>

<p>"Who do you think it is?"</p>

<p>"I don't think, Hazel. I know that that is a picture of Tarzan
of the Apes."</p>

<p>"Jane!"</p>

<p>"I cannot be mistaken. Oh, Hazel, are you sure that he is
dead? Can there be no mistake?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid not, dear," answered Hazel sadly. "I wish I could
think that you are mistaken, but now a hundred and one little
pieces of corroborative evidence occur to me that meant nothing
to me while I thought that he was John Caldwell, of London. He
said that he had been born in Africa, and educated in
France."</p>

<p>"Yes, that would be true," murmured Jane Porter dully.</p>

<p>"The first officer, who searched his luggage, found nothing to
identify John Caldwell, of London. Practically all his belongings
had been made, or purchased, in Paris. Everything that bore an
initial was marked either with a 'T' alone, or with 'J. C. T.' We
thought that he was traveling incognito under his first two
names&mdash;the J. C. standing for John Caldwell."</p>

<p>"Tarzan of the Apes took the name Jean C. Tarzan," said Jane,
in the same lifeless monotone. "And he is dead! Oh! Hazel, it is
horrible! He died all alone in this terrible ocean! It is
unbelievable that that brave heart should have ceased to
beat&mdash;that those mighty muscles are quiet and cold forever!
That he who was the personification of life and health and manly
strength should be the prey of slimy, crawling things,
that&mdash;" But she could go no further, and with a little moan
she buried her head in her arms, and sank sobbing to the
floor.</p>

<p>For days Miss Porter was ill, and would see no one except
Hazel and the faithful Esmeralda. When at last she came on deck
all were struck by the sad change that had taken place in her.
She was no longer the alert, vivacious American beauty who had
charmed and delighted all who came in contact with her. Instead
she was a very quiet and sad little girl&mdash;with an expression
of hopeless wistfulness that none but Hazel Strong could
interpret.</p>

<p>The entire party strove their utmost to cheer and amuse her,
but all to no avail. Occasionally the jolly Lord Tennington would
wring a wan smile from her, but for the most part she sat with
wide eyes looking out across the sea.</p>

<p>With Jane Porter's illness one misfortune after another seemed
to attack the yacht. First an engine broke down, and they drifted
for two days while temporary repairs were being made. Then a
squall struck them unaware, that carried overboard nearly
everything above deck that was portable. Later two of the seamen
fell to fighting in the forecastle, with the result that one of
them was badly wounded with a knife, and the other had to be put
in irons. Then, to cap the climax, the mate fell overboard at
night, and was drowned before help could reach him. The yacht
cruised about the spot for ten hours, but no sign of the man was
seen after he disappeared from the deck into the sea.</p>

<p>Every member of the crew and guests was gloomy and depressed
after these series of misfortunes. All were apprehensive of worse
to come, and this was especially true of the seamen who recalled
all sorts of terrible omens and warnings that had occurred during
the early part of the voyage, and which they could now clearly
translate into the precursors of some grim and terrible tragedy
to come.</p>

<p>Nor did the croakers have long to wait. The second night after
the drowning of the mate the little yacht was suddenly wracked
from stem to stern. About one o'clock in the morning there was a
terrific impact that threw the slumbering guests and crew from
berth and bunk. A mighty shudder ran through the frail craft; she
lay far over to starboard; the engines stopped. For a moment she
hung there with her decks at an angle of forty-five
degrees&mdash;then, with a sullen, rending sound, she slipped
back into the sea and righted.</p>

<p>Instantly the men rushed upon deck, followed closely by the
women.</p>

<p>Though the night was cloudy, there was little wind or sea, nor
was it so dark but that just off the port bow a black mass could
be discerned floating low in the water.</p>

<p>"A derelict," was the terse explanation of the officer of the
watch.</p>

<p>Presently the engineer hurried on deck in search of the
captain.</p>

<p>"That patch we put on the cylinder head's blown out, sir," he
reported, "and she's makin' water fast for'ard on the port bow."
An instant later a seaman rushed up from below.</p>

<p>"My Gawd!" he cried. "Her whole bleedin' bottom's ripped out.
She can't float twenty minutes."</p>

<p>"Shut up!" roared Tennington. "Ladies, go below and get some
of your things together. It may not be so bad as that, but we may
have to take to the boats. It will be safer to be prepared. Go at
once, please. And, Captain Jerrold, send some competent man
below, please, to ascertain the exact extent of the damage. In
the meantime I might suggest that you have the boats
provisioned." The calm, low voice of the owner did much to
reassure the entire party, and a moment later all were occupied
with the duties he had suggested. By the time the ladies had
returned to the deck the rapid provisioning of the boats had been
about completed, and a moment later the officer who had gone
below had returned to report.</p>

<p>But his opinion was scarcely needed to assure the huddled
group of men and women that the end of the <i>Lady Alice</i> was
at hand.</p>

<p>"Well, sir?" said the captain, as his officer hesitated.</p>

<p>"I dislike to frighten the ladies, sir," he said, "but she
can't float a dozen minutes, in my opinion. There's a hole in her
you could drive a bally cow through, sir." For five minutes the
<i>Lady Alice</i> had been settling rapidly by the bow. Already
her stern loomed high in the air, and foothold on the deck was of
the most precarious nature. She carried four boats, and these
were all filled and lowered away in safety. As they pulled
rapidly from the stricken little vessel Jane Porter turned to
have one last look at her. Just then there came a loud crash and
an ominous rumbling and pounding from the heart of the
ship&mdash;her machinery had broken loose, and was dashing its
way toward the bow, tearing out partitions and bulkheads as it
went&mdash;the stern rose rapidly high above them; for a moment
she seemed to pause there&mdash;a vertical shaft protruding from
the bosom of the ocean, and then swiftly she dove headforemost
beneath the waves.</p>

<p>In one of the boats the brave Lord Tennington wiped a tear
from his eye&mdash;he had not seen a fortune in money go down
forever into the sea, but a dear, beautiful friend whom he had
loved.</p>

<p>At last the long night broke, and a tropical sun smote down
upon the rolling water. Jane Porter had dropped into a fitful
slumber&mdash;the fierce light of the sun upon her upturned face
awoke her. She looked about her. In the boat with her were three
sailors, Clayton, and Monsieur Thuran. Then she looked for the
other boats, but as far as the eye could reach there was nothing
to break the fearful monotony of that waste of waters&mdash;they
were alone in a small boat upon the broad Atlantic.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap14" id="chap14">XIV. &mdash; BACK TO THE
PRIMITIVE</a></h2>

<div align="center"> <img src="fr100053-images/TheReturnOfTarzan-14.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration"> </div><br>

<p class="first">As Tarzan struck the water, his first impulse
was to swim clear of the ship and possible danger from her
propellers. He knew whom to thank for his present predicament,
and as he lay in the sea, just supporting himself by a gentle
movement of his hands, his chief emotion was one of chagrin that
he had been so easily bested by Rokoff.</p>

<p>He lay thus for some time, watching the receding and rapidly
diminishing lights of the steamer without it ever once occurring
to him to call for help. He never had called for help in his
life, and so it is not strange that he did not think of it now.
Always had he depended upon his own prowess and resourcefulness,
nor had there ever been since the days of Kala any to answer an
appeal for succor. When it did occur to him it was too late.</p>

<p>There was, thought Tarzan, a possible one chance in a hundred
thousand that he might be picked up, and an even smaller chance
that he would reach land, so he determined that to combine what
slight chances there were, he would swim slowly in the direction
of the coast&mdash;the ship might have been closer in than he had
known.</p>

<p>His strokes were long and easy&mdash;it would be many hours
before those giant muscles would commence to feel fatigue. As he
swam, guided toward the east by the stars, he noticed that he
felt the weight of his shoes, and so he removed them. His
trousers went next, and he would have removed his coat at the
same time but for the precious papers in its pocket. To assure
himself that he still had them he slipped his hand in to feel,
but to his consternation they were gone.</p>

<p>Now he knew that something more than revenge had prompted
Rokoff to pitch him overboard&mdash;the Russian had managed to
obtain possession of the papers Tarzan had wrested from him at
Bou Saada. The ape-man swore softly, and let his coat and shirt
sink into the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Before many hours he had divested himself of his remaining
garments, and was swimming easily and unencumbered toward the
east.</p>

<p>The first faint evidence of dawn was paling the stars ahead of
him when the dim outlines of a low-lying black mass loomed up
directly in his track. A few strong strokes brought him to its
side&mdash;it was the bottom of a wave-washed derelict. Tarzan
clambered upon it&mdash;he would rest there until daylight at
least. He had no intention to remain there inactive&mdash;a prey
to hunger and thirst. If he must die he preferred dying in action
while making some semblance of an attempt to save himself.</p>

<p>The sea was quiet, so that the wreck had only a gently
undulating motion, that was nothing to the swimmer who had had no
sleep for twenty hours. Tarzan of the Apes curled up upon the
slimy timbers, and was soon asleep.</p>

<p>The heat of the sun awoke him early in the forenoon. His first
conscious sensation was of thirst, which grew almost to the
proportions of suffering with full returning consciousness; but a
moment later it was forgotten in the joy of two almost
simultaneous discoveries. The first was a mass of wreckage
floating beside the derelict in the midst of which, bottom up,
rose and fell an overturned lifeboat; the other was the faint,
dim line of a far-distant shore showing on the horizon in the
east.</p>

<p>Tarzan dove into the water, and swam around the wreck to the
lifeboat. The cool ocean refreshed him almost as much as would a
draft of water, so that it was with renewed vigor that he brought
the smaller boat alongside the derelict, and, after many
herculean efforts, succeeded in dragging it onto the slimy ship's
bottom.</p>

<p>There he righted and examined it&mdash;the boat was quite
sound, and a moment later floated upright alongside the wreck.
Then Tarzan selected several pieces of wreckage that might answer
him as paddles, and presently was making good headway toward the
far-off shore.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon by the time he came close enough
to distinguish objects on land, or to make out the contour of the
shore line. Before him lay what appeared to be the entrance to a
little, landlocked harbor. The wooded point to the north was
strangely familiar. Could it be possible that fate had thrown him
up at the very threshold of his own beloved jungle! But as the
bow of his boat entered the mouth of the harbor the last shred of
doubt was cleared away, for there before him upon the farther
shore, under the shadows of his primeval forest, stood his own
cabin&mdash;built before his birth by the hand of his long-dead
father, John Clayton, Lord Greystoke.</p>

<p>With long sweeps of his giant muscles Tarzan sent the little
craft speeding toward the beach. Its prow had scarcely touched
when the ape-man leaped to shore&mdash;his heart beat fast in joy
and exultation as each long-familiar object came beneath his
roving eyes&mdash;the cabin, the beach, the little brook, the
dense jungle, the black, impenetrable forest. The myriad birds in
their brilliant plumage&mdash;the gorgeous tropical blooms upon
the festooned creepers falling in great loops from the giant
trees.</p>

<p>Tarzan of the Apes had come into his own again, and that all
the world might know it he threw back his young head, and gave
voice to the fierce, wild challenge of his tribe. For a moment
silence reigned upon the jungle, and then, low and weird, came an
answering challenge&mdash;it was the deep roar of Numa, the lion;
and from a great distance, faintly, the fearsome answering bellow
of a bull ape.</p>

<p>Tarzan went to the brook first, and slaked his thirst. Then he
approached his cabin. The door was still closed and latched as he
and D'Arnot had left it. He raised the latch and entered. Nothing
had been disturbed; there were the table, the bed, and the little
crib built by his father&mdash;the shelves and cupboards just as
they had stood for over twenty-three years&mdash;just as he had
left them nearly two years before.</p>

<p>His eyes satisfied, Tarzan's stomach began to call aloud for
attention&mdash;the pangs of hunger suggested a search for food.
There was nothing in the cabin, nor had he any weapons; but upon
a wall hung one of his old grass ropes. It had been many times
broken and spliced, so that he had discarded it for a better one
long before.</p>

<p>Tarzan wished that he had a knife. Well, unless he was
mistaken he should have that and a spear and bows and arrows
before another sun had set&mdash;the rope would take care of
that, and in the meantime it must be made to procure food for
him. He coiled it carefully, and, throwing it about his shoulder,
went out, closing the door behind him.</p>

<p>Close to the cabin the jungle commenced, and into it Tarzan of
the Apes plunged, wary and noiseless&mdash;once more a savage
beast hunting its food. For a time he kept to the ground, but
finally, discovering no spoor indicative of nearby meat, he took
to the trees. With the first dizzy swing from tree to tree all
the old joy of living swept over him. Vain regrets and dull
heartache were forgotten.</p>

<p>Now was he living. Now, indeed, was the true happiness of
perfect freedom his. Who would go back to the stifling, wicked
cities of civilized man when the mighty reaches of the great
jungle offered peace and liberty? Not he.</p>

<p>While it was yet light Tarzan came to a drinking place by the
side of a jungle river. There was a ford there, and for countless
ages the beasts of the forest had come down to drink at this
spot. Here of a night might always be found either Sabor or Numa
crouching in the dense foliage of the surrounding jungle awaiting
an antelope or a water buck for their meal. Here came Horta, the
boar, to water, and here came Tarzan of the Apes to make a kill,
for he was very empty.</p>

<p>On a low branch he squatted above the trail. For an hour he
waited. It was growing dark. A little to one side of the ford in
the densest thicket he heard the faint sound of padded feet, and
the brushing of a huge body against tall grasses and tangled
creepers. None other than Tarzan might have heard it, but the
ape-man heard and translated&mdash;it was Numa, the lion, on the
same errand as himself. Tarzan smiled.</p>

<p>Presently he heard an animal approaching warily along the
trail toward the drinking place. A moment more and it came in
view&mdash;it was Horta, the boar. Here was delicious
meat&mdash;and Tarzan's mouth watered. The grasses where Numa lay
were very still now&mdash;ominously still. Horta passed beneath
Tarzan&mdash;a few more steps and he would be within the radius
of Numa's spring. Tarzan could imagine how old Numa's eyes were
shining&mdash;how he was already sucking in his breath for the
awful roar which would freeze his prey for the brief instant
between the moment of the spring and the sinking of terrible
fangs into splintering bones.</p>

<p>But as Numa gathered himself, a slender rope flew through the
air from the low branches of a near-by tree. A noose settled
about Horta's neck. There was a frightened grunt, a squeal, and
then Numa saw his quarry dragged backward up the trail, and, as
he sprang, Horta, the boar, soared upward beyond his clutches
into the tree above, and a mocking face looked down and laughed
into his own.</p>

<p>Then indeed did Numa roar. Angry, threatening, hungry, he
paced back and forth beneath the taunting ape-man. Now he
stopped, and, rising on his hind legs against the stem of the
tree that held his enemy, sharpened his huge claws upon the bark,
tearing out great pieces that laid bare the white wood
beneath.</p>

<p>And in the meantime Tarzan had dragged the struggling Horta to
the limb beside him. Sinewy fingers completed the work the
choking noose had commenced. The ape-man had no knife, but nature
had equipped him with the means of tearing his food from the
quivering flank of his prey, and gleaming teeth sank into the
succulent flesh while the raging lion looked on from below as
another enjoyed the dinner that he had thought already his.</p>

<p>It was quite dark by the time Tarzan had gorged himself. Ah,
but it had been delicious! Never had he quite accustomed himself
to the ruined flesh that civilized men had served him, and in the
bottom of his savage heart there had constantly been the craving
for the warm meat of the fresh kill, and the rich, red blood.</p>

<p>He wiped his bloody hands upon a bunch of leaves, slung the
remains of his kill across his shoulder, and swung off through
the middle terrace of the forest toward his cabin, and at the
same instant Jane Porter and William Cecil Clayton arose from a
sumptuous dinner upon the <i>Lady Alice</i>, thousands of miles
to the east, in the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>Beneath Tarzan walked Numa, the lion, and when the ape-man
deigned to glance downward he caught occasional glimpses of the
baleful green eyes following through the darkness. Numa did not
roar now&mdash;instead, he moved stealthily, like the shadow of a
great cat; but yet he took no step that did not reach the
sensitive ears of the ape-man.</p>

<p>Tarzan wondered if he would stalk him to his cabin door. He
hoped not, for that would mean a night's sleep curled in the
crotch of a tree, and he much preferred the bed of grasses within
his own abode. But he knew just the tree and the most comfortable
crotch, if necessity demanded that he sleep out. A hundred times
in the past some great jungle cat had followed him home, and
compelled him to seek shelter in this same tree, until another
mood or the rising sun had sent his enemy away.</p>

<p>But presently Numa gave up the chase and, with a series of
blood-curdling moans and roars, turned angrily back in search of
another and an easier dinner. So Tarzan came to his cabin
unattended, and a few moments later was curled up in the mildewed
remnants of what had once been a bed of grasses. Thus easily did
Monsieur Jean C. Tarzan slough the thin skin of his artificial
civilization, and sink happy and contented into the deep sleep of
the wild beast that has fed to repletion. Yet a woman's "yes"
would have bound him to that other life forever, and made the
thought of this savage existence repulsive.</p>

<p>Tarzan slept late into the following forenoon, for he had been
very tired from the labors and exertion of the long night and day
upon the ocean, and the jungle jaunt that had brought into play
muscles that he had scarce used for nearly two years. When he
awoke he ran to the brook first to drink. Then he took a plunge
into the sea, swimming about for a quarter of an hour. Afterward
he returned to his cabin, and breakfasted off the flesh of Horta.
This done, he buried the balance of the carcass in the soft earth
outside the cabin, for his evening meal.</p>

<p>Once more he took his rope and vanished into the jungle. This
time he hunted nobler quarry&mdash;man; although had you asked
him his own opinion he could have named a dozen other denizens of
the jungle which he considered far the superiors in nobility of
the men he hunted.</p>

<p>Today Tarzan was in quest of weapons. He wondered if the women
and children had remained in Mbonga's village after the punitive
expedition from the French cruiser had massacred all the warriors
in revenge for D'Arnot's supposed death. He hoped that he should
find warriors there, for he knew not how long a quest he should
have to make were the village deserted.</p>

<p>The ape-man traveled swiftly through the forest, and about
noon came to the site of the village, but to his disappointment
found that the jungle had overgrown the plantain fields and that
the thatched huts had fallen in decay. There was no sign of man.
He clambered about among the ruins for half an hour, hoping that
he might discover some forgotten weapon, but his search was
without fruit, and so he took up his quest once more, following
up the stream, which flowed from a southeasterly direction. He
knew that near fresh water he would be most likely to find
another settlement.</p>

<p>As he traveled he hunted as he had hunted with his ape people
in the past, as Kala had taught him to hunt, turning over rotted
logs to find some toothsome vermin, running high into the trees
to rob a bird's nest, or pouncing upon a tiny rodent with the
quickness of a cat. There were other things that he ate, too, but
the less detailed the account of an ape's diet, the
better&mdash;and Tarzan was again an ape, the same fierce, brutal
anthropoid that Kala had taught him to be, and that he had been
for the first twenty years of his life.</p>

<p>Occasionally he smiled as he recalled some friend who might
even at the moment be sitting placid and immaculate within the
precincts of his select Parisian club&mdash;just as Tarzan had
sat but a few months before; and then he would stop, as though
turned suddenly to stone as the gentle breeze carried to his
trained nostrils the scent of some new prey or a formidable
enemy.</p>

<p>That night he slept far inland from his cabin, securely wedged
into the crotch of a giant tree, swaying a hundred feet above the
ground. He had eaten heartily again&mdash;this time from the
flesh of Bara, the deer, who had fallen prey to his quick
noose.</p>

<p>Early the next morning he resumed his journey, always
following the course of the stream. For three days he continued
his quest, until he had come to a part of the jungle in which he
never before had been. Occasionally upon the higher ground the
forest was much thinner, and in the far distance through the
trees he could see ranges of mighty mountains, with wide plains
in the foreground.</p>

<p>Here, in the open spaces, were new game&mdash;countless
antelope and vast herds of zebra. Tarzan was entranced&mdash;he
would make a long visit to this new world.</p>

<p>On the morning of the fourth day his nostrils were suddenly
surprised by a faint new scent. It was the scent of man, but yet
a long way off. The ape-man thrilled with pleasure. Every sense
was on the alert as with crafty stealth he moved quickly through
the trees, up-wind, in the direction of his prey. Presently he
came upon it&mdash;a lone warrior treading softly through the
jungle.</p>

<p>Tarzan followed close above his quarry, waiting for a clearer
space in which to hurl his rope. As he stalked the unconscious
man, new thoughts presented themselves to the ape-
man&mdash;thoughts born of the refining influences of
civilization, and of its cruelties. It came to him that seldom if
ever did civilized man kill a fellow being without some pretext,
however slight. It was true that Tarzan wished this man's weapons
and ornaments, but was it necessary to take his life to obtain
them? The longer he thought about it, the more repugnant became
the thought of taking human life needlessly; and thus it happened
that while he was trying to decide just what to do, they had come
to a little clearing, at the far side of which lay a palisaded
village of beehive huts.</p>

<p>As the warrior emerged from the forest, Tarzan caught a
fleeting glimpse of a tawny hide worming its way through the
matted jungle grasses in his wake&mdash;it was Numa, the lion.
He, too, was stalking the black man. With the instant that Tarzan
realized the native's danger his attitude toward his erstwhile
prey altered completely&mdash;now he was a fellow man threatened
by a common enemy.</p>

<p>Numa was about to charge&mdash;there was little time in which
to compare various methods or weigh the probable results of any.
And then a number of things happened, almost
simultaneously&mdash;the lion sprang from his ambush toward the
retreating black&mdash;Tarzan cried out in warning&mdash;and the
black turned just in time to see Numa halted in mid-flight by a
slender strand of grass rope, the noosed end of which had fallen
cleanly about his neck.</p>

<p>The ape-man had acted so quickly that he had been unable to
prepare himself to withstand the strain and shock of Numa's great
weight upon the rope, and so it was that though the rope stopped
the beast before his mighty talons could fasten themselves in the
flesh of the black, the strain overbalanced Tarzan, who came
tumbling to the ground not six paces from the infuriated animal.
Like lightning Numa turned upon this new enemy, and, defenseless
as he was, Tarzan of the Apes was nearer to death that instant
than he ever before had been. It was the black who saved him. The
warrior realized in an instant that he owed his life to this
strange white man, and he also saw that only a miracle could save
his preserver from those fierce yellow fangs that had been so
near to his own flesh.</p>

<p>With the quickness of thought his spear arm flew back, and
then shot forward with all the force of the sinewy muscles that
rolled beneath the shimmering ebon hide. True to its mark the
iron-shod weapon flew, transfixing Numa's sleek carcass from the
right groin to beneath the left shoulder. With a hideous scream
of rage and pain the brute turned again upon the black. A dozen
paces he had gone when Tarzan's rope brought him to a stand once
more&mdash;then he wheeled again upon the ape-man, only to feel
the painful prick of a barbed arrow as it sank half its length in
his quivering flesh.</p>

<p>Again he stopped, and by this time Tarzan had run twice around
the stem of a great tree with his rope, and made the end
fast.</p>

<p>The black saw the trick, and grinned, but Tarzan knew that
Numa must be quickly finished before those mighty teeth had found
and parted the slender cord that held him. It was a matter of but
an instant to reach the black's side and drag his long knife from
its scabbard. Then he signed the warrior to continue to shoot
arrows into the great beast while he attempted to close in upon
him with the knife; so as one tantalized upon one side, the other
sneaked cautiously in upon the other. Numa was furious. He raised
his voice in a perfect frenzy of shrieks, growls, and hideous
moans, the while he reared upon his hind legs in futile attempt
to reach first one and then the other of his tormentors.</p>

<p>But at length the agile ape-man saw his chance, and rushed in
upon the beast's left side behind the mighty shoulder. A giant
arm encircled the tawny throat, and a long blade sank once, true
as a die, into the fierce heart. Then Tarzan arose, and the black
man and the white looked into each other's eyes across the body
of their kill&mdash;and the black made the sign of peace and
friendship, and Tarzan of the Apes answered in kind.</p> <hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap15" id="chap15">XV. &mdash; FROM APE TO
SAVAGE</a></h2>

<div align="center"> <img src="fr100053-images/TheReturnOfTarzan-15.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration"> </div><br>

<p class="first">The noise of their battle with Numa had drawn an
excited horde of savages from the nearby village, and a moment
after the lion's death the two men were surrounded by lithe, ebon
warriors, gesticulating and jabbering&mdash;a thousand questions
that drowned each ventured reply.</p>

<p>And then the women came, and the children&mdash;eager,
curious, and, at sight of Tarzan, more questioning than ever. The
ape-man's new friend finally succeeded in making himself heard,
and when he had done talking the men and women of the village
vied with one another in doing honor to the strange creature who
had saved their fellow and battled single-handed with fierce
Numa.</p>

<p>At last they led him back to their village, where they brought
him gifts of fowl, and goats, and cooked food. When he pointed to
their weapons the warriors hastened to fetch spear, shield,
arrows, and a bow. His friend of the encounter presented him with
the knife with which he had killed Numa. There was nothing in all
the village he could not have had for the asking.</p>

<p>How much easier this was, thought Tarzan, than murder and
robbery to supply his wants. How close he had been to killing
this man whom he never had seen before, and who now was
manifesting by every primitive means at his command friendship
and affection for his would-be slayer. Tarzan of the Apes was
ashamed. Hereafter he would at least wait until he knew men
deserved it before he thought of killing them.</p>

<p>The idea recalled Rokoff to his mind. He wished that he might
have the Russian to himself in the dark jungle for a few
minutes.</p>

<p>There was a man who deserved killing if ever any one did. And
if he could have seen Rokoff at that moment as he assiduously
bent every endeavor to the pleasant task of ingratiating himself
into the affections of the beautiful Miss Strong, he would have
longed more than ever to mete out to the man the fate he
deserved.</p>

<p>Tarzan's first night with the savages was devoted to a wild
orgy in his honor. There was feasting, for the hunters had
brought in an antelope and a zebra as trophies of their skill,
and gallons of the weak native beer were consumed. As the
warriors danced in the firelight, Tarzan was again impressed by
the symmetry of their figures and the regularity of their
features&mdash;the flat noses and thick lips of the typical West
Coast savage were entirely missing.</p>

<p>In repose the faces of the men were intelligent and dignified,
those of the women ofttimes prepossessing.</p>

<p>It was during this dance that the ape-man first noticed that
some of the men and many of the women wore ornaments of
gold&mdash;principally anklets and armlets of great weight,
apparently beaten out of the solid metal. When he expressed a
wish to examine one of these, the owner removed it from her
person and insisted, through the medium of signs, that Tarzan
accept it as a gift. A close scrutiny of the bauble convinced the
ape-man that the article was of virgin gold, and he was
surprised, for it was the first time that he had ever seen golden
ornaments among the savages of Africa, other than the trifling
baubles those near the coast had purchased or stolen from
Europeans. He tried to ask them from whence the metal came, but
he could not make them understand.</p>

<p>When the dance was done Tarzan signified his intention to
leave them, but they almost implored him to accept the
hospitality of a great hut which the chief set apart for his sole
use. He tried to explain that he would return in the morning, but
they could not understand. When he finally walked away from them
toward the side of the village opposite the gate, they were still
further mystified as to his intentions.</p>

<p>Tarzan, however, knew just what he was about. In the past he
had had experience with the rodents and vermin that infest every
native village, and, while he was not overscrupulous about such
matters, he much preferred the fresh air of the swaying trees to
the fetid atmosphere of a hut.</p>

<p>The natives followed him to where a great tree overhung the
palisade, and as Tarzan leaped for a lower branch and disappeared
into the foliage above, precisely after the manner of Manu, the
monkey, there were loud exclamations of surprise and
astonishment. For half an hour they called to him to return, but
as he did not answer them they at last desisted, and sought the
sleeping-mats within their huts.</p>

<p>Tarzan went back into the forest a short distance until he had
found a tree suited to his primitive requirements, and then,
curling himself in a great crotch, he fell immediately into a
deep sleep.</p>

<p>The following morning he dropped into the village street as
suddenly as he had disappeared the preceding night. For a moment
the natives were startled and afraid, but when they recognized
their guest of the night before they welcomed him with shouts and
laughter. That day he accompanied a party of warriors to the
nearby plains on a great hunt, and so dexterous did they find
this white man with their own crude weapons that another bond of
respect and admiration was thereby wrought.</p>

<p>For weeks Tarzan lived with his savage friends, hunting
buffalo, antelope, and zebra for meat, and elephant for ivory.
Quickly he learned their simple speech, their native customs, and
the ethics of their wild, primitive tribal life. He found that
they were not cannibals&mdash;that they looked with loathing and
contempt upon men who ate men.</p>

<p>Busuli, the warrior whom he had stalked to the village, told
him many of the tribal legends&mdash;how, many years before, his
people had come many long marches from the north; how once they
had been a great and powerful tribe; and how the slave raiders
had wrought such havoc among them with their death-dealing guns
that they had been reduced to a mere remnant of their former
numbers and power.</p>

<p>"They hunted us down as one hunts a fierce beast," said
Busuli.</p>

<p>"There was no mercy in them. When it was not slaves they
sought it was ivory, but usually it was both. Our men were killed
and our women driven away like sheep. We fought against them for
many years, but our arrows and spears could not prevail against
the sticks which spit fire and lead and death to many times the
distance that our mightiest warrior could place an arrow. At
last, when my father was a young man, the Arabs came again, but
our warriors saw them a long way off, and Chowambi, who was chief
then, told his people to gather up their belongings and come away
with him&mdash;that he would lead them far to the south until
they found a spot to which the Arab raiders did not come.</p>

<p>"And they did as he bid, carrying all their belongings,
including many tusks of ivory. For months they wandered,
suffering untold hardships and privations, for much of the way
was through dense jungle, and across mighty mountains, but
finally they came to this spot, and although they sent parties
farther on to search for an even better location, none has ever
been found."</p>

<p>"And the raiders have never found you here?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"About a year ago a small party of Arabs and Manyuema stumbled
upon us, but we drove them off, killing many. For days we
followed them, stalking them for the wild beasts they are,
picking them off one by one, until but a handful remained, but
these escaped us." As Busuli talked he fingered a heavy gold
armlet that encircled the glossy hide of his left arm. Tarzan's
eyes had been upon the ornament, but his thoughts were elsewhere.
Presently he recalled the question he had tried to ask when he
first came to the tribe&mdash;the question he could not at that
time make them understand. For weeks he had forgotten so trivial
a thing as gold, for he had been for the time a truly primeval
man with no thought beyond today. But of a sudden the sight of
gold awakened the sleeping civilization that was in him, and with
it came the lust for wealth. That lesson Tarzan had learned well
in his brief experience of the ways of civilized man. He knew
that gold meant power and pleasure. He pointed to the bauble.</p>

<p>"From whence came the yellow metal, Busuli?" he asked.</p>

<p>The black pointed toward the southeast.</p>

<p>"A moon's march away&mdash;maybe more," he replied.</p>

<p>"Have you been there?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"No, but some of our people were there years ago, when my
father was yet a young man. One of the parties that searched
farther for a location for the tribe when first they settled here
came upon a strange people who wore many ornaments of yellow
metal. Their spears were tipped with it, as were their arrows,
and they cooked in vessels made all of solid metal like my
armlet.</p>

<p>"They lived in a great village in huts that were built of
stone and surrounded by a great wall. They were very fierce,
rushing out and falling upon our warriors before ever they
learned that their errand was a peaceful one. Our men were few in
number, but they held their own at the top of a little rocky
hill, until the fierce people went back at sunset into their
wicked city. Then our warriors came down from their hill, and,
after taking many ornaments of yellow metal from the bodies of
those they had slain, they marched back out of the valley, nor
have any of us ever returned.</p>

<p>"They are wicked people&mdash;neither white like you nor black
like me, but covered with hair as is Bolgani, the gorilla. Yes,
they are very bad people indeed, and Chowambi was glad to get out
of their country."</p>

<p>"And are none of those alive who were with Chowambi, and saw
these strange people and their wonderful city?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Waziri, our chief, was there," replied Busuli. "He was a very
young man then, but he accompanied Chowambi, who was his
father."</p>

<p>So that night Tarzan asked Waziri about it, and Waziri, who
was now an old man, said that it was a long march, but that the
way was not difficult to follow. He remembered it well.</p>

<p>"For ten days we followed this river which runs beside our
village. Up toward its source we traveled until on the tenth day
we came to a little spring far up upon the side of a lofty
mountain range. In this little spring our river is born. The next
day we crossed over the top of the mountain, and upon the other
side we came to a tiny rivulet which we followed down into a
great forest. For many days we traveled along the winding banks
of the rivulet that had now become a river, until we came to a
greater river, into which it emptied, and which ran down the
center of a mighty valley.</p>

<p>"Then we followed this large river toward its source, hoping
to come to more open land. After twenty days of marching from the
time we had crossed the mountains and passed out of our own
country we came again to another range of mountains. Up their
side we followed the great river, that had now dwindled to a tiny
rivulet, until we came to a little cave near the mountain-top. In
this cave was the mother of the river.</p>

<p>"I remember that we camped there that night, and that it was
very cold, for the mountains were high. The next day we decided
to ascend to the top of the mountains, and see what the country
upon the other side looked like, and if it seemed no better than
that which we had so far traversed we would return to our village
and tell them that they had already found the best place in all
the world to live.</p>

<p>"And so we clambered up the face of the rocky cliffs until we
reached the summit, and there from a flat mountain-top we saw,
not far beneath us, a shallow valley, very narrow; and upon the
far side of it was a great village of stone, much of which had
fallen and crumbled into decay."</p>

<p>The balance of Waziri's story was practically the same as that
which Busuli had told.</p>

<p>"I should like to go there and see this strange city," said
Tarzan, "and get some of their yellow metal from its fierce
inhabitants."</p>

<p>"It is a long march," replied Waziri, "and I am an old man,
but if you will wait until the rainy season is over and the
rivers have gone down I will take some of my warriors and go with
you." And Tarzan had to be contented with that arrangement,
though he would have liked it well enough to have set off the
next morning&mdash;he was as impatient as a child. Really Tarzan
of the Apes was but a child, or a primeval man, which is the same
thing in a way.</p>

<p>The next day but one a small party of hunters returned to the
village from the south to report a large herd of elephant some
miles away.</p>

<p>By climbing trees they had had a fairly good view of the herd,
which they described as numbering several large tuskers, a great
many cows and calves, and full-grown bulls whose ivory would be
worth having.</p>

<p>The balance of the day and evening was filled with preparation
for a great hunt&mdash;spears were overhauled, quivers were
replenished, bows were restrung; and all the while the village
witch doctor passed through the busy throngs disposing of various
charms and amulets designed to protect the possessor from hurt,
or bring him good fortune in the morrow's hunt.</p>

<p>At dawn the hunters were off. There were fifty sleek, black
warriors, and in their midst, lithe and active as a young forest
god, strode Tarzan of the Apes, his brown skin contrasting oddly
with the ebony of his companions. Except for color he was one of
them. His ornaments and weapons were the same as theirs&mdash;he
spoke their language&mdash;he laughed and joked with them, and
leaped and shouted in the brief wild dance that preceded their
departure from the village, to all intent and purpose a savage
among savages.</p>

<p>Nor, had he questioned himself, is it to be doubted that he
would have admitted that he was far more closely allied to these
people and their life than to the Parisian friends whose ways,
apelike, he had successfully mimicked for a few short months.</p>

<p>But he did think of D'Arnot, and a grin of amusement showed
his strong white teeth as he pictured the immaculate Frenchman's
expression could he by some means see Tarzan as he was that
minute. Poor Paul, who had prided himself on having eradicated
from his friend the last traces of wild savagery. "How quickly
have I fallen!" thought Tarzan; but in his heart he did not
consider it a fall&mdash;rather, he pitied the poor creatures of
Paris, penned up like prisoners in their silly clothes, and
watched by policemen all their poor lives, that they might do
nothing that was not entirely artificial and tiresome.</p>

<p>A two hours' march brought them close to the vicinity in which
the elephants had been seen the previous day. From there on they
moved very quietly indeed searching for the spoor of the great
beasts. At length they found the well-marked trail along which
the herd had passed not many hours before. In single file they
followed it for about half an hour. It was Tarzan who first
raised his hand in signal that the quarry was at hand&mdash;his
sensitive nose had warned him that the elephants were not far
ahead of them.</p>

<p>The blacks were skeptical when he told them how he knew.</p>

<p>"Come with me," said Tarzan, "and we shall see." With the
agility of a squirrel he sprang into a tree and ran nimbly to the
top. One of the blacks followed more slowly and carefully.</p>

<p>When he had reached a lofty limb beside the ape-man the latter
pointed to the south, and there, some few hundred yards away, the
black saw a number of huge black backs swaying back and forth
above the top of the lofty jungle grasses. He pointed the
direction to the watchers below, indicating with his fingers the
number of beasts he could count.</p>

<p>Immediately the hunters started toward the elephants. The
black in the tree hastened down, but Tarzan stalked, after his
own fashion, along the leafy way of the middle terrace.</p>

<p>It is no child's play to hunt wild elephants with the crude
weapons of primitive man. Tarzan knew that few native tribes ever
attempted it, and the fact that his tribe did so gave him no
little pride&mdash;already he was commencing to think of himself
as a member of the little community. As Tarzan moved silently
through the trees he saw the warriors below creeping in a half
circle upon the still unsuspecting elephants. Finally they were
within sight of the great beasts.</p>

<p>Now they singled out two large tuskers, and at a signal the
fifty men rose from the ground where they had lain concealed, and
hurled their heavy war spears at the two marked beasts. There was
not a single miss; twenty-five spears were embedded in the sides
of each of the giant animals. One never moved from the spot where
it stood when the avalanche of spears struck it, for two,
perfectly aimed, had penetrated its heart, and it lunged forward
upon its knees, rolling to the ground without a struggle.</p>

<p>The other, standing nearly head-on toward the hunters, had not
proved so good a mark, and though every spear struck not one
entered the great heart. For a moment the huge bull stood
trumpeting in rage and pain, casting about with its little eyes
for the author of its hurt. The blacks had faded into the jungle
before the weak eyes of the monster had fallen upon any of them,
but now he caught the sound of their retreat, and, amid a
terrific crashing of underbrush and branches, he charged in the
direction of the noise.</p>

<p>It so happened that chance sent him in the direction of
Busuli, whom he was overtaking so rapidly that it was as though
the black were standing still instead of racing at full speed to
escape the certain death which pursued him. Tarzan had witnessed
the entire performance from the branches of a nearby tree, and
now that he saw his friend's peril he raced toward the infuriated
beast with loud cries, hoping to distract him.</p>

<p>But it had been as well had he saved his breath, for the brute
was deaf and blind to all else save the particular object of his
rage that raced futilely before him. And now Tarzan saw that only
a miracle could save Busuli, and with the same unconcern with
which he had once hunted this very man he hurled himself into the
path of the elephant to save the black warrior's life.</p>

<p>He still grasped his spear, and while Tantor was yet six or
eight paces behind his prey, a sinewy white warrior dropped as
from the heavens, almost directly in his path. With a vicious
lunge the elephant swerved to the right to dispose of this
temerarious foeman who dared intervene between himself and his
intended victim; but he had not reckoned on the lightning
quickness that could galvanize those steel muscles into action so
marvelously swift as to baffle even a keener eyesight than
Tantor's.</p>

<p>And so it happened that before the elephant realized that his
new enemy had leaped from his path Tarzan had driven his iron-
shod spear from behind the massive shoulder straight into the
fierce heart, and the colossal pachyderm had toppled to his death
at the feet of the ape-man.</p>

<p>Busuli had not beheld the manner of his deliverance, but
Waziri, the old chief, had seen, and several of the other
warriors, and they hailed Tarzan with delight as they swarmed
about him and his great kill. When he leaped upon the mighty
carcass, and gave voice to the weird challenge with which he
announced a great victory, the blacks shrank back in fear, for to
them it marked the brutal Bolgani, whom they feared fully as much
as they feared Numa, the lion; but with a fear with which was
mixed a certain uncanny awe of the manlike thing to which they
attributed supernatural powers.</p>

<p>But when Tarzan lowered his raised head and smiled upon them
they were reassured, though they did not understand. Nor did they
ever fully understand this strange creature who ran through the
trees as quickly as Manu, yet was even more at home upon the
ground than themselves; who was except as to color like unto
themselves, yet as powerful as ten of them, and singlehanded a
match for the fiercest denizens of the fierce jungle.</p>

<p>When the remainder of the warriors had gathered, the hunt was
again taken up and the stalking of the retreating herd once more
begun; but they had covered a bare hundred yards when from behind
them, at a great distance, sounded faintly a strange popping.</p>

<p>For an instant they stood like a group of statuary, intently
listening. Then Tarzan spoke.</p>

<p>"Guns!" he said. "The village is being attacked."</p>

<p>"Come!" cried Waziri. "The Arab raiders have returned with
their cannibal slaves for our ivory and our women!"</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap16" id="chap16">XVI. &mdash; THE IVORY
RAIDERS</a></h2>

<div align="center"> <img src="fr100053-images/TheReturnOfTarzan-16.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration"> </div><br>

<p class="first">Waziri's warriors marched at a rapid trot
through the jungle in the direction of the village. For a few
minutes, the sharp cracking of guns ahead warned them to haste,
but finally the reports dwindled to an occasional shot, presently
ceasing altogether. Nor was this less ominous than the rattle of
musketry, for it suggested but a single solution to the little
band of rescuers&mdash;that the illy garrisoned village had
already succumbed to the onslaught of a superior force.</p>

<p>The returning hunters had covered a little more than three
miles of the five that had separated them from the village when
they met the first of the fugitives who had escaped the bullets
and clutches of the foe. There were a dozen women, youths, and
girls in the party, and so excited were they that they could
scarce make themselves understood as they tried to relate to
Waziri the calamity that had befallen his people.</p>

<p>"They are as many as the leaves of the forest," cried one of
the women, in attempting to explain the enemy's force. "There are
many Arabs and countless Manyuema, and they all have guns. They
crept close to the village before we knew that they were about,
and then, with many shouts, they rushed in upon us, shooting down
men, and women, and children. Those of us who could fled in all
directions into the jungle, but more were killed. I do not know
whether they took any prisoners or not&mdash;they seemed only
bent upon killing us all. The Manyuema called us many names,
saying that they would eat us all before they left our
country&mdash;that this was our punishment for killing their
friends last year. I did not hear much, for I ran away quickly."
The march toward the village was now resumed, more slowly and
with greater stealth, for Waziri knew that it was too late to
rescue&mdash;their only mission could be one of revenge. Inside
the next mile a hundred more fugitives were met. There were many
men among these, and so the fighting strength of the party was
augmented.</p>

<p>Now a dozen warriors were sent creeping ahead to
reconnoiter.</p>

<p>Waziri remained with the main body, which advanced in a thin
line that spread in a great crescent through the forest. By the
chief's side walked Tarzan.</p>

<p>Presently one of the scouts returned. He had come within sight
of the village.</p>

<p>"They are all within the palisade," he whispered.</p>

<p>"Good!" said Waziri. "We shall rush in upon them and slay them
all," and he made ready to send word along the line that they
were to halt at the edge of the clearing until they saw him rush
toward the village&mdash;then all were to follow.</p>

<p>"Wait!" cautioned Tarzan. "If there are even fifty guns within
the palisade we shall be repulsed and slaughtered. Let me go
alone through the trees, so that I may look down upon them from
above, and see just how many there be, and what chance we might
have were we to charge. It were foolish to lose a single man
needlessly if there be no hope of success. I have an idea that we
can accomplish more by cunning than by force. Will you wait,
Waziri?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the old chief. "Go!"</p>

<p>So Tarzan sprang into the trees and disappeared in the
direction of the village. He moved more cautiously than was his
wont, for he knew that men with guns could reach him quite as
easily in the treetops as on the ground. And when Tarzan of the
Apes elected to adopt stealth, no creature in all the jungle
could move so silently or so completely efface himself from the
sight of an enemy.</p>

<p>In five minutes he had wormed his way to the great tree that
overhung the palisade at one end of the village, and from his
point of vantage looked down upon the savage horde beneath. He
counted fifty Arabs and estimated that there were five times as
many Manyuema. The latter were gorging themselves upon food and,
under the very noses of their white masters, preparing the
gruesome feast which is the <i>pièce de résistance</i> that
follows a victory in which the bodies of their slain enemies fall
into their horrid hands.</p>

<p>The ape-man saw that to charge that wild horde, armed as they
were with guns, and barricaded behind the locked gates of the
village, would be a futile task, and so he returned to Waziri and
advised him to wait; that he, Tarzan, had a better plan.</p>

<p>But a moment before one of the fugitives had related to Waziri
the story of the atrocious murder of the old chief's wife, and so
crazed with rage was the old man that he cast discretion to the
winds. Calling his warriors about him, he commanded them to
charge, and, with brandishing spears and savage yells, the little
force of scarcely more than a hundred dashed madly toward the
village gates.</p>

<p>Before the clearing had been half crossed the Arabs opened up
a withering fire from behind the palisade.</p>

<p>With the first volley Waziri fell. The speed of the chargers
slackened. Another volley brought down a half dozen more. A few
reached the barred gates, only to be shot in their tracks,
without the ghost of a chance to gain the inside of the palisade,
and then the whole attack crumpled, and the remaining warriors
scampered back into the forest. As they ran the raiders opened
the gates, rushing after them, to complete the day's work with
the utter extermination of the tribe. Tarzan had been among the
last to turn back toward the forest, and now, as he ran slowly,
he turned from time to time to speed a well-aimed arrow into the
body of a pursuer.</p>

<p>Once within the jungle, he found a little knot of determined
blacks waiting to give battle to the oncoming horde, but Tarzan
cried to them to scatter, keeping out of harm's way until they
could gather in force after dark.</p>

<p>"Do as I tell you," he urged, "and I will lead you to victory
over these enemies of yours. Scatter through the forest, picking
up as many stragglers as you can find, and at night, if you think
that you have been followed, come by roundabout ways to the spot
where we killed the elephants today. Then I will explain my plan,
and you will find that it is good. You cannot hope to pit your
puny strength and simple weapons against the numbers and the guns
of the Arabs and the Manyuema." They finally assented. "When you
scatter," explained Tarzan, in conclusion, "your foes will have
to scatter to follow you, and so it may happen that if you are
watchful you can drop many a Manyuema with your arrows from
behind some great trees." They had barely time to hasten away
farther into the forest before the first of the raiders had
crossed the clearing and entered it in pursuit of them.</p>

<p>Tarzan ran a short distance along the ground before he took to
the trees. Then he raced quickly to the upper terrace, there
doubling on his tracks and making his way rapidly back toward the
village.</p>

<p>Here he found that every Arab and Manyuema had joined in the
pursuit, leaving the village deserted except for the chained
prisoners and a single guard.</p>

<p>The sentry stood at the open gate, looking in the direction of
the forest, so that he did not see the agile giant that dropped
to the ground at the far end of the village street. With drawn
bow the ape-man crept stealthily toward his unsuspecting victim.
The prisoners had already discovered him, and with wide eyes
filled with wonder and with hope they watched their would-be
rescuer. Now he halted not ten paces from the unconscious
Manyuema. The shaft was drawn back its full length at the height
of the keen gray eye that sighted along its polished surface.
There was a sudden twang as the brown fingers released their
hold, and without a sound the raider sank forward upon his face,
a wooden shaft transfixing his heart and protruding a foot from
his black chest.</p>

<p>Then Tarzan turned his attention to the fifty women and youths
chained neck to neck on the long slave chain. There was no
releasing of the ancient padlocks in the time that was left him,
so the ape-man called to them to follow him as they were, and,
snatching the gun and cartridge belt from the dead sentry, he led
the now happy band out through the village gate and into the
forest upon the far side of the clearing.</p>

<p>It was a slow and arduous march, for the slave chain was new
to these people, and there were many delays as one of their
number would stumble and fall, dragging others down with her.
Then, too, Tarzan had been forced to make a wide detour to avoid
any possibility of meeting with returning raiders. He was
partially guided by occasional shots which indicated that the
Arab horde was still in touch with the villagers; but he knew
that if they would but follow his advice there would be but few
casualties other than on the side of the marauders.</p>

<p>Toward dusk the firing ceased entirely, and Tarzan knew that
the Arabs had all returned to the village. He could scarce
repress a smile of triumph as he thought of their rage on
discovering that their guard had been killed and their prisoners
taken away. Tarzan had wished that he might have taken some of
the great store of ivory the village contained, solely for the
purpose of still further augmenting the wrath of his enemies; but
he knew that that was not necessary for its salvation, since he
already had a plan mapped out which would effectually prevent the
Arabs leaving the country with a single tusk. And it would have
been cruel to have needlessly burdened these poor, overwrought
women with the extra weight of the heavy ivory.</p>

<p>It was after midnight when Tarzan, with his slow-moving
caravan, approached the spot where the elephants lay. Long before
they reached it they had been guided by the huge fire the natives
had built in the center of a hastily improvised boma, partially
for warmth and partially to keep off chance lions.</p>

<p>When they had come close to the encampment Tarzan called aloud
to let them know that friends were coming. It was a joyous
reception the little party received when the blacks within the
<i>boma</i> saw the long file of fettered friends and relatives
enter the firelight.</p>

<p>These had all been given up as lost forever, as had Tarzan as
well, so that the happy blacks would have remained awake all
night to feast on elephant meat and celebrate the return of their
fellows, had not Tarzan insisted that they take what sleep they
could, against the work of the coming day.</p>

<p>At that, sleep was no easy matter, for the women who had lost
their men or their children in the day's massacre and battle made
the night hideous with their continued wailing and howling.
Finally, however, Tarzan succeeded in silencing them, on the plea
that their noise would attract the Arabs to their hiding-place,
when all would be slaughtered.</p>

<p>When dawn came Tarzan explained his plan of battle to the
warriors, and without demur one and all agreed that it was the
safest and surest way in which to rid themselves of their
unwelcome visitors and be revenged for the murder of their
fellows.</p>

<p>First the women and children, with a guard of some twenty old
warriors and youths, were started southward, to be entirely out
of the zone of danger. They had instructions to erect temporary
shelter and construct a protecting <i>boma</i> of thorn bush; for
the plan of campaign which Tarzan had chosen was one which might
stretch out over many days, or even weeks, during which time the
warriors would not return to the new camp.</p>

<p>Two hours after daylight a thin circle of black warriors
surrounded the village. At intervals one was perched high in the
branches of a tree which could overlook the palisade. Presently a
Manyuema within the village fell, pierced by a single arrow.
There had been no sound of attack&mdash;none of the hideous war-
cries or vainglorious waving of menacing spears that ordinarily
marks the attack of savages&mdash;just a silent messenger of
death from out of the silent forest.</p>

<p>The Arabs and their followers were thrown into a fine rage at
this unprecedented occurrence. They ran for the gates, to wreak
dire vengeance upon the foolhardy perpetrator of the outrage; but
they suddenly realized that they did not know which way to turn
to find the foe. As they stood debating with many angry shouts
and much gesticulating, one of the Arabs sank silently to the
ground in their very midst&mdash;a thin arrow protruding from his
heart.</p>

<p>Tarzan had placed the finest marksmen of the tribe in the
surrounding trees, with directions never to reveal themselves
while the enemy was faced in their direction. As a black released
his messenger of death he would slink behind the sheltering stem
of the tree he had selected, nor would he again aim until a
watchful eye told him that none was looking toward his tree.</p>

<p>Three times the Arabs started across the clearing in the
direction from which they thought the arrows came, but each time
another arrow would come from behind to take its toll from among
their number.</p>

<p>Then they would turn and charge in a new direction. Finally
they set out upon a determined search of the forest, but the
blacks melted before them, so that they saw no sign of an
enemy.</p>

<p>But above them lurked a grim figure in the dense foliage of
the mighty trees&mdash;it was Tarzan of the Apes, hovering over
them as if he had been the shadow of death. Presently a Manyuema
forged ahead of his companions; there was none to see from what
direction death came, and so it came quickly, and a moment later
those behind stumbled over the dead body of their
comrade&mdash;the inevitable arrow piercing the still heart.</p>

<p>It does not take a great deal of this manner of warfare to get
upon the nerves of white men, and so it is little to be wondered
at that the Manyuema were soon panic-stricken. Did one forge
ahead an arrow found his heart; did one lag behind he never again
was seen alive; did one stumble to one side, even for a bare
moment from the sight of his fellows, he did not return&mdash;and
always when they came upon the bodies of their dead they found
those terrible arrows driven with the accuracy of superhuman
power straight through the victim's heart. But worse than all
else was the hideous fact that not once during the morning had
they seen or heard the slightest sign of an enemy other than the
pitiless arrows.</p>

<p>When finally they returned to the village it was no better.
Every now and then, at varying intervals that were maddening in
the terrible suspense they caused, a man would plunge forward
dead.</p>

<p>The blacks besought their masters to leave this terrible
place, but the Arabs feared to take up the march through the grim
and hostile forest beset by this new and terrible enemy while
laden with the great store of ivory they had found within the
village; but, worse yet, they hated to leave the ivory
behind.</p>

<p>Finally the entire expedition took refuge within the thatched
huts&mdash;here, at least, they would be free from the arrows.
Tarzan, from the tree above the village, had marked the hut into
which the chief Arabs had gone, and, balancing himself upon an
overhanging limb, he drove his heavy spear with all the force of
his giant muscles through the thatched roof. A howl of pain told
him that it had found a mark. With this parting salute to
convince them that there was no safety for them anywhere within
the country, Tarzan returned to the forest, collected his
warriors, and withdrew a mile to the south to rest and eat. He
kept sentries in several trees that commanded a view of the trail
toward the village, but there was no pursuit.</p>

<p>An inspection of his force showed not a single
casualty&mdash;not even a minor wound; while rough estimates of
the enemies' loss convinced the blacks that no fewer than twenty
had fallen before their arrows.</p>

<p>They were wild with elation, and were for finishing the day in
one glorious rush upon the village, during which they would
slaughter the last of their foemen. They were even picturing the
various tortures they would inflict, and gloating over the
suffering of the Manyuema, for whom they entertained a peculiar
hatred, when Tarzan put his foot down flatly upon the plan.</p>

<p>"You are crazy!" he cried. "I have shown you the only way to
fight these people. Already you have killed twenty of them
without the loss of a single warrior, whereas, yesterday,
following your own tactics, which you would now renew, you lost
at least a dozen, and killed not a single Arab or Manyuema. You
will fight just as I tell you to fight, or I shall leave you and
go back to my own country." They were frightened when he
threatened this, and promised to obey him scrupulously if he
would but promise not to desert them.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said. "We shall return to the elephant
<i>boma</i> for the night. I have a plan to give the Arabs a
little taste of what they may expect if they remain in our
country, but I shall need no help. Come! If they suffer no more
for the balance of the day they will feel reassured, and the
relapse into fear will be even more nerve-racking than as though
we continued to frighten them all afternoon." So they marched
back to their camp of the previous night, and, lighting great
fires, ate and recounted the adventures of the day until long
after dark. Tarzan slept until midnight, then he arose and crept
into the Cimmerian blackness of the forest. An hour later he came
to the edge of the clearing before the village. There was a camp-
fire burning within the palisade. The ape-man crept across the
clearing until he stood before the barred gates. Through the
interstices he saw a lone sentry sitting before the fire.</p>

<p>Quietly Tarzan went to the tree at the end of the village
street.</p>

<p>He climbed softly to his place, and fitted an arrow to his
bow.</p>

<p>For several minutes he tried to sight fairly upon the sentry,
but the waving branches and flickering firelight convinced him
that the danger of a miss was too great&mdash;he must touch the
heart full in the center to bring the quiet and sudden death his
plan required.</p>

<p>He had brought, besides, his bow, arrows, and rope, the gun he
had taken the previous day from the other sentry he had killed.
Caching all these in a convenient crotch of the tree, he dropped
lightly to the ground within the palisade, armed only with his
long knife.</p>

<p>The sentry's back was toward him. Like a cat Tarzan crept upon
the dozing man. He was within two paces of him now&mdash;another
instant and the knife would slide silently into the fellow's
heart.</p>

<p>Tarzan crouched for a spring, for that is ever the quickest
and surest attack of the jungle beast&mdash;when the man, warned,
by some subtle sense, sprang to his feet and faced the ape-
man.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap17" id="chap17">XVII. &mdash; THE WHITE CHIEF OF
THE WAZIRI</a></h2>

<div align="center"> <img src="fr100053-images/TheReturnOfTarzan-17.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration"> </div><br>

<p class="first">When the eyes of the black Manyuema savage fell
upon the strange apparition that confronted him with menacing
knife they went wide in horror. He forgot the gun within his
hands; he even forgot to cry out&mdash;his one thought was to
escape this fearsome-looking white savage, this giant of a man
upon whose massive rolling muscles and mighty chest the
flickering firelight played.</p>

<p>But before he could turn Tarzan was upon him, and then the
sentry thought to scream for aid, but it was too late. A great
hand was upon his windpipe, and he was being borne to the earth.
He battled furiously but futilely&mdash;with the grim tenacity of
a bulldog those awful fingers were clinging to his throat.
Swiftly and surely life was being choked from him. His eyes
bulged, his tongue protruded, his face turned to a ghastly
purplish hue&mdash;there was a convulsive tremor of the
stiffening muscles, and the Manyuema sentry lay quite still.</p>

<p>The ape-man threw the body across one of his broad shoulders
and, gathering up the fellow's gun, trotted silently up the
sleeping village street toward the tree that gave him such easy
ingress to the palisaded village. He bore the dead sentry into
the midst of the leafy maze above.</p>

<p>First he stripped the body of cartridge belt and such
ornaments as he craved, wedging it into a convenient crotch while
his nimble fingers ran over it in search of the loot he could not
plainly see in the dark. When he had finished he took the gun
that had belonged to the man, and walked far out upon a limb,
from the end of which he could obtain a better view of the huts.
Drawing a careful bead on the beehive structure in which he knew
the chief Arabs to be, he pulled the trigger. Almost instantly
there was an answering groan. Tarzan smiled. He had made another
lucky hit.</p>

<p>Following the shot there was a moment's silence in the camp,
and then Manyuema and Arab came pouring from the huts like a
swarm of angry hornets; but if the truth were known they were
even more frightened than they were angry. The strain of the
preceding day had wrought upon the fears of both black and white,
and now this single shot in the night conjured all manner of
terrible conjectures in their terrified minds.</p>

<p>When they discovered that their sentry had disappeared, their
fears were in no way allayed, and as though to bolster their
courage by warlike actions, they began to fire rapidly at the
barred gates of the village, although no enemy was in sight.
Tarzan took advantage of the deafening roar of this fusillade to
fire into the mob beneath him.</p>

<p>No one heard his shot above the din of rattling musketry in
the street, but some who were standing close saw one of their
number crumple suddenly to the earth. When they leaned over him
he was dead. They were panic-stricken, and it took all the brutal
authority of the Arabs to keep the Manyuema from rushing helter-
skelter into the jungle&mdash;anywhere to escape from this
terrible village.</p>

<p>After a time they commenced to quiet down, and as no further
mysterious deaths occurred among them they took heart again. But
it was a short-lived respite, for just as they had concluded that
they would not be disturbed again Tarzan gave voice to a weird
moan, and as the raiders looked up in the direction from which
the sound seemed to come, the ape-man, who stood swinging the
dead body of the sentry gently to and fro, suddenly shot the
corpse far out above their heads.</p>

<p>With howls of alarm the throng broke in all directions to
escape this new and terrible creature who seemed to be springing
upon them. To their fear-distorted imaginations the body of the
sentry, falling with wide-sprawled arms and legs, assumed the
likeness of a great beast of prey. In their anxiety to escape,
many of the blacks scaled the palisade, while others tore down
the bars from the gates and rushed madly across the clearing
toward the jungle.</p>

<p>For a time no one turned back toward the thing that had
frightened them, but Tarzan knew that they would in a moment, and
when they discovered that it was but the dead body of their
sentry, while they would doubtless be still further terrified, he
had a rather definite idea as to what they would do, and so he
faded silently away toward the south, taking the moonlit upper
terrace back toward the camp of the Waziri.</p>

<p>Presently one of the Arabs turned and saw that the thing that
had leaped from the tree upon them lay still and quiet where it
had fallen in the center of the village street. Cautiously he
crept back toward it until he saw that it was but a man. A moment
later he was beside the figure, and in another had recognized it
as the corpse of the Manyuema who had stood on guard at the
village gate.</p>

<p>His companions rapidly gathered around at his call, and after
a moment's excited conversation they did precisely what Tarzan
had reasoned they would. Raising their guns to their shoulders,
they poured volley after volley into the tree from which the
corpse had been thrown&mdash;had Tarzan remained there he would
have been riddled by a hundred bullets.</p>

<p>When the Arabs and Manyuema discovered that the only marks of
violence upon the body of their dead comrade were giant finger
prints upon his swollen throat they were again thrown into deeper
apprehension and despair. That they were not even safe within a
palisaded village at night came as a distinct shock to them. That
an enemy could enter into the midst of their camp and kill their
sentry with bare hands seemed outside the bounds of reason, and
so the superstitious Manyuema commenced to attribute their ill
luck to supernatural causes; nor were the Arabs able to offer any
better explanation.</p>

<p>With at least fifty of their number flying through the black
jungle, and without the slightest knowledge of when their uncanny
foemen might resume the cold-blooded slaughter they had
commenced, it was a desperate band of cut-throats that waited
sleeplessly for the dawn. Only on the promise of the Arabs that
they would leave the village at daybreak, and hasten onward
toward their own land, would the remaining Manyuema consent to
stay at the village a moment longer. Not even fear of their cruel
masters was sufficient to overcome this new terror.</p>

<p>And so it was that when Tarzan and his warriors returned to
the attack the next morning they found the raiders prepared to
march out of the village. The Manyuema were laden with stolen
ivory.</p>

<p>As Tarzan saw it he grinned, for he knew that they would not
carry it far. Then he saw something which caused him
anxiety&mdash;a number of the Manyuema were lighting torches in
the remnant of the camp-fire.</p>

<p>They were about to fire the village.</p>

<p>Tarzan was perched in a tall tree some hundred yards from the
palisade. Making a trumpet of his hands, he called loudly in the
Arab tongue: "Do not fire the huts, or we shall kill you all! Do
not fire the huts, or we shall kill you all!" A dozen times he
repeated it. The Manyuema hesitated, then one of them flung his
torch into the campfire. The others were about to do the same
when an Arab sprung upon them with a stick, beating them toward
the huts. Tarzan could see that he was commanding them to fire
the little thatched dwellings. Then he stood erect upon the
swaying branch a hundred feet above the ground, and, raising one
of the Arab guns to his shoulder, took careful aim and fired.
With the report the Arab who was urging on his men to burn the
village fell in his tracks, and the Manyuema threw away their
torches and fled from the village. The last Tarzan saw of them
they were racing toward the jungle, while their former masters
knelt upon the ground and fired at them.</p>

<p>But however angry the Arabs might have been at the
insubordination of their slaves, they were at least convinced
that it would be the better part of wisdom to forego the pleasure
of firing the village that had given them two such nasty
receptions. In their hearts, however, they swore to return again
with such force as would enable them to sweep the entire country
for miles around, until no vestige of human life remained.</p>

<p>They had looked in vain for the owner of the voice which had
frightened off the men who had been detailed to put the torch to
the huts, but not even the keenest eye among them had been able
to locate him. They had seen the puff of smoke from the tree
following the shot that brought down the Arab, but, though a
volley had immediately been loosed into its foliage, there had
been no indication that it had been effective.</p>

<p>Tarzan was too intelligent to be caught in any such trap, and
so the report of his shot had scarcely died away before the ape-
man was on the ground and racing for another tree a hundred yards
away.</p>

<p>Here he again found a suitable perch from which he could watch
the preparations of the raiders. It occurred to him that he might
have considerable more fun with them, so again he called to them
through his improvised trumpet.</p>

<p>"Leave the ivory!" he cried. "Leave the ivory! Dead men have
no use for ivory!" Some of the Manyuema started to lay down their
loads, but this was altogether too much for the avaricious Arabs.
With loud shouts and curses they aimed their guns full upon the
bearers, threatening instant death to any who might lay down his
load. They could give up firing the village, but the thought of
abandoning this enormous fortune in ivory was quite beyond their
conception&mdash;better death than that.</p>

<p>And so they marched out of the village of the Waziri, and on
the shoulders of their slaves was the ivory ransom of a score of
kings.</p>

<p>Toward the north they marched, back toward their savage
settlement in the wild and unknown country which lies back from
the Congo in the uttermost depths of The Great Forest, and on
either side of them traveled an invisible and relentless foe.</p>

<p>Under Tarzan's guidance the black Waziri warriors stationed
themselves along the trail on either side in the densest
underbrush. They stood at far intervals, and, as the column
passed, a single arrow or a heavy spear, well aimed, would pierce
a Manyuema or an Arab.</p>

<p>Then the Waziri would melt into the distance and run ahead to
take his stand farther on. They did not strike unless success
were sure and the danger of detection almost nothing, and so the
arrows and the spears were few and far between, but so persistent
and inevitable that the slow-moving column of heavy-laden raiders
was in a constant state of panic&mdash;panic at the uncertainty
of who the next would be to fall, and when.</p>

<p>It was with the greatest difficulty that the Arabs prevented
their men a dozen times from throwing away their burdens and
fleeing like frightened rabbits up the trail toward the north.
And so the day wore on&mdash;a frightful nightmare of a day for
the raiders&mdash;a day of weary but well-repaid work for the
Waziri. At night the Arabs constructed a rude <i>boma</i> in a
little clearing by a river, and went into camp.</p>

<p>At intervals during the night a rifle would bark close above
their heads, and one of the dozen sentries which they now had
posted would tumble to the ground. Such a condition was
insupportable, for they saw that by means of these hideous
tactics they would be completely wiped out, one by one, without
inflicting a single death upon their enemy. But yet, with the
persistent avarice of the white man, the Arabs clung to their
loot, and when morning came forced the demoralized Manyuema to
take up their burdens of death and stagger on into the
jungle.</p>

<p>For three days the withering column kept up its frightful
march.</p>

<p>Each hour was marked by its deadly arrow or cruel spear. The
nights were made hideous by the barking of the invisible gun that
made sentry duty equivalent to a death sentence.</p>

<p>On the morning of the fourth day the Arabs were compelled to
shoot two of their blacks before they could compel the balance to
take up the hated ivory, and as they did so a voice rang out,
clear and strong, from the jungle: "Today you die, oh, Manyuema,
unless you lay down the ivory. Fall upon your cruel masters and
kill them! You have guns, why do you not use them? Kill the
Arabs, and we will not harm you. We will take you back to our
village and feed you, and lead you out of our country in safety
and in peace. Lay down the ivory, and fall upon your
masters&mdash;we will help you. Else you die!" As the voice died
down the raiders stood as though turned to stone.</p>

<p>The Arabs eyed their Manyuema slaves; the slaves looked first
at one of their fellows, and then at another&mdash;they were but
waiting for some one to take the initiative. There were some
thirty Arabs left, and about one hundred and fifty blacks. All
were armed&mdash;even those who were acting as porters had their
rifles slung across their backs.</p>

<p>The Arabs drew together. The sheik ordered the Manyuema to
take up the march, and as he spoke he cocked his rifle and raised
it.</p>

<p>But at the same instant one of the blacks threw down his load,
and, snatching his rifle from his back, fired point-black at the
group of Arabs. In an instant the camp was a cursing, howling
mass of demons, fighting with guns and knives and pistols. The
Arabs stood together, and defended their lives valiantly, but
with the rain of lead that poured upon them from their own
slaves, and the shower of arrows and spears which now leaped from
the surrounding jungle aimed solely at them, there was little
question from the first what the outcome would be. In ten minutes
from the time the first porter had thrown down his load the last
of the Arabs lay dead.</p>

<p>When the firing had ceased Tarzan spoke again to the Manyuema:
"Take up our ivory, and return it to our village, from whence you
stole it. We shall not harm you." For a moment the Manyuema
hesitated. They had no stomach to retrace that difficult three
days' trail. They talked together in low whispers, and one turned
toward the jungle, calling aloud to the voice that had spoken to
them from out of the foliage.</p>

<p>"How do we know that when you have us in your village you will
not kill us all?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You do not know," replied Tarzan, "other than that we have
promised not to harm you if you will return our ivory to us. But
this you do know, that it lies within our power to kill you all
if you do not return as we direct, and are we not more likely to
do so if you anger us than if you do as we bid?"</p>

<p>"Who are you that speaks the tongue of our Arab masters?"
cried the Manyuema spokesman. "Let us see you, and then we shall
give you our answer."</p>

<p>Tarzan stepped out of the jungle a dozen paces from them.</p>

<p>"Look!" he said.</p>

<p>When they saw that he was white they were filled with awe, for
never had they seen a white savage before, and at his great
muscles and giant frame they were struck with wonder and
admiration.</p>

<p>"You may trust me," said Tarzan. "So long as you do as I tell
you, and harm none of my people, we shall do you no hurt. Will
you take up our ivory and return in peace to our village, or
shall we follow along your trail toward the north as we have
followed for the past three days?"</p>

<p>The recollection of the horrid days that had just passed was
the thing that finally decided the Manyuema, and so, after a
short conference, they took up their burdens and set off to
retrace their steps toward the village of the Waziri. At the end
of the third day they marched into the village gate, and were
greeted by the survivors of the recent massacre, to whom Tarzan
had sent a messenger in their temporary camp to the south on the
day that the raiders had quitted the village, telling them that
they might return in safety.</p>

<p>It took all the mastery and persuasion that Tarzan possessed
to prevent the Waziri falling on the Manyuema tooth and nail, and
tearing them to pieces, but when he had explained that he had
given his word that they would not be molested if they carried
the ivory back to the spot from which they had stolen it, and had
further impressed upon his people that they owed their entire
victory to him, they finally acceded to his demands, and allowed
the cannibals to rest in peace within their palisade.</p>

<p>That night the village warriors held a big palaver to
celebrate their victories, and to choose a new chief. Since old
Waziri's death Tarzan had been directing the warriors in battle,
and the temporary command had been tacitly conceded to him. There
had been no time to choose a new chief from among their own
number, and, in fact, so remarkably successful had they been
under the ape-man's generalship that they had had no wish to
delegate the supreme authority to another for fear that what they
already had gained might be lost. They had so recently seen the
results of running counter to this savage white man's advice in
the disastrous charge ordered by Waziri, in which he himself had
died, that it had not been difficult for them to accept Tarzan's
authority as final.</p>

<p>The principal warriors sat in a circle about a small fire to
discuss the relative merits of whomever might be suggested as old
Waziri's successor. It was Busuli who spoke first:</p>

<p>"Since Waziri is dead, leaving no son, there is but one among
us whom we know from experience is fitted to make us a good king.
There is only one who has proved that he can successfully lead us
against the guns of the white man, and bring us easy victory
without the loss of a single life. There is only one, and that is
the white man who has led us for the past few days," and Busuli
sprang to his feet, and with uplifted spear and half-bent,
crouching body commenced to dance slowly about Tarzan, chanting
in time to his steps: "Waziri, king of the Waziri; Waziri, killer
of Arabs; Waziri, king of the Waziri."</p>

<p>One by one the other warriors signified their acceptance of
Tarzan as their king by joining in the solemn dance. The women
came and squatted about the rim of the circle, beating upon tom-
toms, clapping their hands in time to the steps of the dancers,
and joining in the chant of the warriors. In the center of the
circle sat Tarzan of the Apes&mdash;Waziri, king of the Waziri,
for, like his predecessor, he was to take the name of his tribe
as his own.</p>

<p>Faster and faster grew the pace of the dancers, louder and
louder their wild and savage shouts. The women rose and fell in
unison, shrieking now at the tops of their voices. The spears
were brandishing fiercely, and as the dancers stooped down and
beat their shields upon the hard-tramped earth of the village
street the whole sight was as terribly primeval and savage as
though it were being staged in the dim dawn of humanity,
countless ages in the past.</p>

<p>As the excitement waxed the ape-man sprang to his feet and
joined in the wild ceremony. In the center of the circle of
glittering black bodies he leaped and roared and shook his heavy
spear in the same mad abandon that enthralled his fellow savages.
The last remnant of his civilization was forgotten&mdash;he was a
primitive man to the fullest now; reveling in the freedom of the
fierce, wild life he loved, gloating in his kingship among these
wild blacks.</p>

<p>Ah, if Olga de Coude had but seen him then&mdash;could she
have recognized the well-dressed, quiet young man whose well-bred
face and irreproachable manners had so captivated her but a few
short months ago? And Jane Porter! Would she have still loved
this savage warrior chieftain, dancing naked among his naked
savage subjects? And D'Arnot! Could D'Arnot have believed that
this was the same man he had introduced into half a dozen of the
most select clubs of Paris? What would his fellow peers in the
House of Lords have said had one pointed to this dancing giant,
with his barbaric headdress and his metal ornaments, and said:
"There, my lords, is John Clayton, Lord Greystoke." And so Tarzan
of the Apes came into a real kingship among men&mdash;slowly but
surely was he following the evolution of his ancestors, for had
he not started at the very bottom?</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap18" id="chap18">XVIII. &mdash; THE LOTTERY OF
DEATH</a></h2>

<div align="center"> <img src="fr100053-images/TheReturnOfTarzan-18.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration"> </div><br>

<p class="first">Jane Porter had been the first of those in the
lifeboat to awaken the morning after the wreck of the <i>Lady
Alice</i>. The other members of the party were asleep upon the
thwarts or huddled in cramped positions in the bottom of the
boat.</p>

<p>When the girl realized that they had become separated from the
other boats she was filled with alarm. The sense of utter
loneliness and helplessness which the vast expanse of deserted
ocean aroused in her was so depressing that, from the first,
contemplation of the future held not the slightest ray of promise
for her. She was confident that they were lost&mdash;lost beyond
possibility of succor.</p>

<p>Presently Clayton awoke. It was several minutes before he
could gather his senses sufficiently to realize where he was, or
recall the disaster of the previous night. Finally his bewildered
eyes fell upon the girl.</p>

<p>"Jane!" he cried. "Thank God that we are together!"</p>

<p>"Look," said the girl dully, indicating the horizon with an
apathetic gesture. "We are all alone." Clayton scanned the water
in every direction.</p>

<p>"Where can they be?" he cried. "They cannot have gone down,
for there has been no sea, and they were afloat after the yacht
sank&mdash;I saw them all." He awoke the other members of the
party, and explained their plight.</p>

<p>"It is just as well that the boats are scattered, sir," said
one of the sailors. "They are all provisioned, so that they do
not need each other on that score, and should a storm blow up
they could be of no service to one another even if they were
together, but scattered about the ocean there is a much better
chance that one at least will be picked up, and then a search
will be at once started for the others. Were we together there
would be but one chance of rescue, where now there may be four."
They saw the wisdom of his philosophy, and were cheered by it,
but their joy was short-lived, for when it was decided that they
should row steadily toward the east and the continent, it was
discovered that the sailors who had been at the only two oars
with which the boat had been provided had fallen asleep at their
work, and allowed both to slip into the sea, nor were they in
sight anywhere upon the water.</p>

<p>During the angry words and recriminations which followed the
sailors nearly came to blows, but Clayton succeeded in quieting
them; though a moment later Monsieur Thuran almost precipitated
another row by making a nasty remark about the stupidity of all
Englishmen, and especially English sailors.</p>

<p>"Come, come, mates," spoke up one of the men, Tompkins, who
had taken no part in the altercation, "shootin' off our bloomin'
mugs won't get us nothin'. As Spider 'ere said afore, we'll all
bloody well be picked up, anyway, sez 'e, so wot's the use o'
squabblin'? Let's eat, sez I."</p>

<p>"That's not a bad idea," said Monsieur Thuran, and then,
turning to the third sailor, Wilson, he said: "Pass one of those
tins aft, my good man."</p>

<p>"Fetch it yerself," retorted Wilson sullenly. "I ain't a-
takin' no orders from no&mdash;furriner&mdash;you ain't captain
o' this ship yet." The result was that Clayton himself had to get
the tin, and then another angry altercation ensued when one of
the sailors accused Clayton and Monsieur Thuran of conspiring to
control the provisions so that they could have the lion's
share.</p>

<p>"Some one should take command of this boat," spoke up Jane
Porter, thoroughly disgusted with the disgraceful wrangling that
had marked the very opening of a forced companionship that might
last for many days. "It is terrible enough to be alone in a frail
boat on the Atlantic, without having the added misery and danger
of constant bickering and brawling among the members of our
party. You men should elect a leader, and then abide by his
decisions in all matters. There is greater need for strict
discipline here than there is upon a well-ordered ship." She had
hoped before she voiced her sentiments that it would not be
necessary for her to enter into the transaction at all, for she
believed that Clayton was amply able to cope with every
emergency, but she had to admit that so far at least he had shown
no greater promise of successfully handling the situation than
any of the others, though he had at least refrained from adding
in any way to the unpleasantness, even going so far as to give up
the tin to the sailors when they objected to its being opened by
him.</p>

<p>The girl's words temporarily quieted the men, and finally it
was decided that the two kegs of water and the four tins of food
should be divided into two parts, one-half going forward to the
three sailors to do with as they saw best, and the balance aft to
the three passengers.</p>

<p>Thus was the little company divided into two camps, and when
the provisions had been apportioned each immediately set to work
to open and distribute food and water. The sailors were the first
to get one of the tins of "food" open, and their curses of rage
and disappointment caused Clayton to ask what the trouble might
be.</p>

<p>"Trouble!" shrieked Spider. "Trouble! It's worse than
trouble&mdash;it's death! This&mdash;-tin is full of coal oil!"
Hastily now Clayton and Monsieur Thuran tore open one of theirs,
only to learn the hideous truth that it also contained, not food,
but coal oil. One after another the four tins on board were
opened.</p>

<p>And as the contents of each became known howls of anger
announced the grim truth&mdash;there was not an ounce of food
upon the boat.</p>

<p>"Well, thank Gawd it wasn't the water," cried Thompkins. "It's
easier to get along without food than it is without water. We can
eat our shoes if worse comes to worst, but we couldn't drink
'em." As he spoke Wilson had been boring a hole in one of the
water kegs, and as Spider held a tin cup he tilted the keg to
pour a draft of the precious fluid. A thin stream of blackish,
dry particles filtered slowly through the tiny aperture into the
bottom of the cup. With a groan Wilson dropped the keg, and sat
staring at the dry stuff in the cup, speechless with horror.</p>

<p>"The kegs are filled with gunpowder," said Spider, in a low
tone, turning to those aft. And so it proved when the last had
been opened.</p>

<p>"Coal oil and gunpowder!" cried Monsieur Thuran.
"<i>Sapristi!</i> What a diet for shipwrecked mariners!" With the
full knowledge that there was neither food nor water on board,
the pangs of hunger and thirst became immediately aggravated, and
so on the first day of their tragic adventure real suffering
commenced in grim earnest, and the full horrors of shipwreck were
upon them.</p>

<p>As the days passed conditions became horrible. Aching eyes
scanned the horizon day and night until the weak and weary
watchers would sink exhausted to the bottom of the boat, and
there wrest in dream-disturbed slumber a moment's respite from
the horrors of the waking reality.</p>

<p>The sailors, goaded by the remorseless pangs of hunger, had
eaten their leather belts, their shoes, the sweatbands from their
caps, although both Clayton and Monsieur Thuran had done their
best to convince them that these would only add to the suffering
they were enduring.</p>

<p>Weak and hopeless, the entire party lay beneath the pitiless
tropic sun, with parched lips and swollen tongues, waiting for
the death they were beginning to crave. The intense suffering of
the first few days had become deadened for the three passengers
who had eaten nothing, but the agony of the sailors was pitiful,
as their weak and impoverished stomachs attempted to cope with
the bits of leather with which they had filled them. Tompkins was
the first to succumb. Just a week from the day the <i>Lady
Alice</i> went down the sailor died horribly in frightful
convulsions.</p>

<p>For hours his contorted and hideous features lay grinning back
at those in the stern of the little boat, until Jane Porter could
endure the sight no longer. "Can you not drop his body overboard,
William?" she asked.</p>

<p>Clayton rose and staggered toward the corpse. The two
remaining sailors eyed him with a strange, baleful light in their
sunken orbs.</p>

<p>Futilely the Englishman tried to lift the corpse over the side
of the boat, but his strength was not equal to the task.</p>

<p>"Lend me a hand here, please," he said to Wilson, who lay
nearest him.</p>

<p>"Wot do you want to throw 'im over for?" questioned the
sailor, in a querulous voice.</p>

<p>"We've got to before we're too weak to do it," replied
Clayton.</p>

<p>"He'd be awful by tomorrow, after a day under that broiling
sun."</p>

<p>"Better leave well enough alone," grumbled Wilson. "We may
need him before tomorrow." Slowly the meaning of the man's words
percolated into Clayton's understanding. At last he realized the
fellow's reason for objecting to the disposal of the dead
man.</p>

<p>"God!" whispered Clayton, in a horrified tone. "You don't
mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"W'y not?" growled Wilson. "Ain't we gotta live? He's dead,"
he added, jerking his thumb in the direction of the corpse. "He
won't care."</p>

<p>"Come here, Thuran," said Clayton, turning toward the
Russian.</p>

<p>"We'll have something worse than death aboard us if we don't
get rid of this body before dark." Wilson staggered up menacingly
to prevent the contemplated act, but when his comrade, Spider,
took sides with Clayton and Monsieur Thuran he gave up, and sat
eying the corpse hungrily as the three men, by combining their
efforts, succeeded in rolling it overboard.</p>

<p>All the balance of the day Wilson sat glaring at Clayton, in
his eyes the gleam of insanity. Toward evening, as the sun was
sinking into the sea, he commenced to chuckle and mumble to
himself, but his eyes never left Clayton.</p>

<p>After it became quite dark Clayton could still feel those
terrible eyes upon him. He dared not sleep, and yet so exhausted
was he that it was a constant fight to retain consciousness.
After what seemed an eternity of suffering his head dropped upon
a thwart, and he slept. How long he was unconscious he did not
know&mdash;he was awakened by a shuffling noise quite close to
him. The moon had risen, and as he opened his startled eyes he
saw Wilson creeping stealthily toward him, his mouth open and his
swollen tongue hanging out.</p>

<p>The slight noise had awakened Jane Porter at the same time,
and as she saw the hideous tableau she gave a shrill cry of
alarm, and at the same instant the sailor lurched forward and
fell upon Clayton.</p>

<p>Like a wild beast his teeth sought the throat of his intended
prey, but Clayton, weak though he was, still found sufficient
strength to hold the maniac's mouth from him.</p>

<p>At Jane Porter's scream Monsieur Thuran and Spider awoke. On
seeing the cause of her alarm, both men crawled to Clayton's
rescue, and between the three of them were able to subdue Wilson
and hurl him to the bottom of the boat. For a few minutes he lay
there chattering and laughing, and then, with an awful scream,
and before any of his companions could prevent, he staggered to
his feet and leaped overboard.</p>

<p>The reaction from the terrific strain of excitement left the
weak survivors trembling and prostrated. Spider broke down and
wept; Jane Porter prayed; Clayton swore softly to himself;
Monsieur Thuran sat with his head in his hands, thinking. The
result of his cogitation developed the following morning in a
proposition he made to Spider and Clayton.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Monsieur Thuran, "you see the fate that
awaits us all unless we are picked up within a day or two. That
there is little hope of that is evidenced by the fact that during
all the days we have drifted we have seen no sail, nor the
faintest smudge of smoke upon the horizon.</p>

<p>"There might be a chance if we had food, but without food
there is none. There remains for us, then, but one of two
alternatives, and we must choose at once. Either we must all die
together within a few days, or one must be sacrificed that the
others may live. Do you quite clearly grasp my meaning?"</p>

<p>Jane Porter, who had overheard, was horrified. If the
proposition had come from the poor, ignorant sailor, she might
possibly have not been so surprised; but that it should come from
one who posed as a man of culture and refinement, from a
gentleman, she could scarcely credit.</p>

<p>"It is better that we die together, then," said Clayton.</p>

<p>"That is for the majority to decide," replied Monsieur
Thuran.</p>

<p>"As only one of us three will be the object of sacrifice, we
shall decide. Miss Porter is not interested, since she will be in
no danger."</p>

<p>"How shall we know who is to be first?" asked Spider.</p>

<p>"It may be fairly fixed by lot," replied Monsieur Thuran. "I
have a number of franc pieces in my pocket. We can choose a
certain date from among them&mdash;the one to draw this date
first from beneath a piece of cloth will be the first."</p>

<p>"I shall have nothing to do with any such diabolical plan,"
muttered Clayton; "even yet land may be sighted or a ship
appear&mdash;in time."</p>

<p>"You will do as the majority decide, or you will be 'the
first' without the formality of drawing lots," said Monsieur
Thuran threateningly. "Come, let us vote on the plan; I for one
am in favor of it. How about you, Spider?"</p>

<p>"And I," replied the sailor.</p>

<p>"It is the will of the majority," announced Monsieur Thuran,
"and now let us lose no time in drawing lots. It is as fair for
one as for another. That three may live, one of us must die
perhaps a few hours sooner than otherwise." Then he began his
preparation for the lottery of death, while Jane Porter sat wide-
eyed and horrified at thought of the thing that she was about to
witness. Monsieur Thuran spread his coat upon the bottom of the
boat, and then from a handful of money he selected six franc
pieces. The other two men bent close above him as he inspected
them. Finally he handed them all to Clayton.</p>

<p>"Look at them carefully," he said. "The oldest date is
eighteen seventy-five, and there is only one of that year."
Clayton and the sailor inspected each coin. To them there seemed
not the slightest difference that could be detected other than
the dates. They were quite satisfied. Had they known that
Monsieur Thuran's past experience as a card sharp had trained his
sense of touch to so fine a point that he could almost
differentiate between cards by the mere feel of them, they would
scarcely have felt that the plan was so entirely fair. The 1875
piece was a hair thinner than the other coins, but neither
Clayton nor Spider could have detected it without the aid of a
micrometer.</p>

<p>"In what order shall we draw?" asked Monsieur Thuran, knowing
from past experience that the majority of men always prefer last
chance in a lottery where the single prize is some distasteful
thing&mdash;there is always the chance and the hope that another
will draw it first.</p>

<p>Monsieur Thuran, for reasons of his own, preferred to draw
first if the drawing should happen to require a second adventure
beneath the coat.</p>

<p>And so when Spider elected to draw last he graciously offered
to take the first chance himself. His hand was under the coat for
but a moment, yet those quick, deft fingers had felt of each
coin, and found and discarded the fatal piece. When he brought
forth his hand it contained an 1888 franc piece. Then Clayton
drew. Jane Porter leaned forward with a tense and horrified
expression on her face as the hand of the man she was to marry
groped about beneath the coat. Presently he withdrew it, a franc
piece lying in the palm. For an instant he dared not look, but
Monsieur Thuran, who had leaned nearer to see the date, exclaimed
that he was safe.</p>

<p>Jane Porter sank weak and trembling against the side of the
boat.</p>

<p>She felt sick and dizzy. And now, if Spider should not draw
the 1875 piece she must endure the whole horrid thing again.</p>

<p>The sailor already had his hand beneath the coat. Great beads
of sweat were standing upon his brow. He trembled as though with
a fit of ague. Aloud he cursed himself for having taken the last
draw, for now his chances for escape were but three to one,
whereas Monsieur Thuran's had been five to one, and Clayton's
four to one.</p>

<p>The Russian was very patient, and did not hurry the man, for
he knew that he himself was quite safe whether the 1875 piece
came out this time or not. When the sailor withdrew his hand and
looked at the piece of money within, he dropped fainting to the
bottom of the boat. Both Clayton and Monsieur Thuran hastened
weakly to examine the coin, which had rolled from the man's hand
and lay beside him.</p>

<p>It was not dated 1875. The reaction from the state of fear he
had been in had overcome Spider quite as effectually as though he
had drawn the fated piece.</p>

<p>But now the whole proceeding must be gone through again. Once
more the Russian drew forth a harmless coin. Jane Porter closed
her eyes as Clayton reached beneath the coat. Spider bent, wide-
eyed, toward the hand that was to decide his fate, for whatever
luck was Clayton's on this last draw, the opposite would be
Spider's. Then William Cecil Clayton, Lord Greystoke, removed his
hand from beneath the coat, and with a coin tight pressed within
his palm where none might see it, he looked at Jane Porter. He
did not dare open his hand.</p>

<p>"Quick!" hissed Spider. "My Gawd, let's see it." Clayton
opened his fingers. Spider was the first to see the date, and ere
any knew what his intention was he raised himself to his feet,
and lunged over the side of the boat, to disappear forever into
the green depths beneath&mdash;the coin had not been the 1875
piece.</p>

<p>The strain had exhausted those who remained to such an extent
that they lay half unconscious for the balance of the day, nor
was the subject referred to again for several days. Horrible days
of increasing weakness and hopelessness. At length Monsieur
Thuran crawled to where Clayton lay.</p>

<p>"We must draw once more before we are too weak even to eat,"
he whispered.</p>

<p>Clayton was in such a state that he was scarcely master of his
own will. Jane Porter had not spoken for three days. He knew that
she was dying. Horrible as the thought was, he hoped that the
sacrifice of either Thuran or himself might be the means of
giving her renewed strength, and so he immediately agreed to the
Russian's proposal.</p>

<p>They drew under the same plan as before, but there could be
but one result&mdash;Clayton drew the 1875 piece.</p>

<p>"When shall it be?" he asked Thuran.</p>

<p>The Russian had already drawn a pocketknife from his trousers,
and was weakly attempting to open it.</p>

<p>"Now," he muttered, and his greedy eyes gloated upon the
Englishman.</p>

<p>"Can't you wait until dark?" asked Clayton. "Miss Porter must
not see this thing done. We were to have been married, you know."
A look of disappointment came over Monsieur Thuran's face.</p>

<p>"Very well," he replied hesitatingly. "It will not be long
until night. I have waited for many days&mdash;I can wait a few
hours longer."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my friend," murmured Clayton. "Now I shall go to
her side and remain with her until it is time. I would like to
have an hour or two with her before I die." When Clayton reached
the girl's side she was unconscious&mdash;he knew that she was
dying, and he was glad that she should not have to see or know
the awful tragedy that was shortly to be enacted. He took her
hand and raised it to his cracked and swollen lips. For a long
time he lay caressing the emaciated, clawlike thing that had once
been the beautiful, shapely white hand of the young Baltimore
belle.</p>

<p>It was quite dark before he knew it, but he was recalled to
himself by a voice out of the night. It was the Russian calling
him to his doom.</p>

<p>"I am coming, Monsieur Thuran," he hastened to reply.</p>

<p>Thrice he attempted to turn himself upon his hands and knees,
that he might crawl back to his death, but in the few hours that
he had lain there he had become too weak to return to Thuran's
side.</p>

<p>"You will have to come to me, monsieur," he called weakly. "I
have not sufficient strength to gain my hands and knees."</p>

<p><i>"Sapristi!"</i> muttered Monsieur Thuran. "You are
attempting to cheat me out of my winnings."</p>

<p>Clayton heard the man shuffling about in the bottom of the
boat. Finally there was a despairing groan.</p>

<p>"I cannot crawl," he heard the Russian wail. "It is too late.
You have tricked me, you dirty English dog."</p>

<p>"I have not tricked you, monsieur," replied Clayton. "I have
done my best to rise, but I shall try again, and if you will try
possibly each of us can crawl halfway, and then you shall have
your 'winnings.'" Again Clayton exerted his remaining strength to
the utmost, and he heard Thuran apparently doing the same. Nearly
an hour later the Englishman succeeded in raising himself to his
hands and knees, but at the first forward movement he pitched
upon his face.</p>

<p>A moment later he heard an exclamation of relief from Monsieur
Thuran.</p>

<p>"I am coming," whispered the Russian.</p>

<p>Again Clayton essayed to stagger on to meet his fate, but once
more he pitched headlong to the boat's bottom, nor, try as he
would, could he again rise. His last effort caused him to roll
over on his back, and there he lay looking up at the stars, while
behind him, coming ever nearer and nearer, he could hear the
laborious shuffling, and the stertorous breathing of the
Russian.</p>

<p>It seemed that he must have lain thus an hour waiting for the
thing to crawl out of the dark and end his misery. It was quite
close now, but there were longer and longer pauses between its
efforts to advance, and each forward movement seemed to the
waiting Englishman to be almost imperceptible.</p>

<p>Finally he knew that Thuran was quite close beside him. He
heard a cackling laugh, something touched his face, and he lost
consciousness.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap19" id="chap19">XIX. &mdash; THE CITY OF
GOLD</a></h2>

<div align="center"> <img src="fr100053-images/TheReturnOfTarzan-19.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration"> </div><br>

<p class="first">The very night that Tarzan of the Apes became
chief of the Waziri the woman he loved lay dying in a tiny boat
two hundred miles west of him upon the Atlantic. As he danced
among his naked fellow savages, the firelight gleaming against
his great, rolling muscles, the personification of physical
perfection and strength, the woman who loved him lay thin and
emaciated in the last coma that precedes death by thirst and
starvation.</p>

<p>The week following the induction of Tarzan into the kingship
of the Waziri was occupied in escorting the Manyuema of the Arab
raiders to the northern boundary of Waziri in accordance with the
promise which Tarzan had made them. Before he left them he
exacted a pledge from them that they would not lead any
expeditions against the Waziri in the future, nor was it a
difficult promise to obtain.</p>

<p>They had had sufficient experience with the fighting tactics
of the new Waziri chief not to have the slightest desire to
accompany another predatory force within the boundaries of his
domain.</p>

<p>Almost immediately upon his return to the village Tarzan
commenced making preparations for leading an expedition in search
of the ruined city of gold which old Waziri had described to him.
He selected fifty of the sturdiest warriors of his tribe,
choosing only men who seemed anxious to accompany him on the
arduous march, and share the dangers of a new and hostile
country.</p>

<p>The fabulous wealth of the fabled city had been almost
constantly in his mind since Waziri had recounted the strange
adventures of the former expedition which had stumbled upon the
vast ruins by chance.</p>

<p>The lure of adventure may have been quite as powerful a factor
in urging Tarzan of the Apes to undertake the journey as the lure
of gold, but the lure of gold was there, too, for he had learned
among civilized men something of the miracles that may be wrought
by the possessor of the magic yellow metal. What he would do with
a golden fortune in the heart of savage Africa it had not
occurred to him to consider&mdash;it would be enough to possess
the power to work wonders, even though he never had an
opportunity to employ it.</p>

<p>So one glorious tropical morning Waziri, chief of the Waziri,
set out at the head of fifty clean-limbed ebon warriors in quest
of adventure and of riches. They followed the course which old
Waziri had described to Tarzan. For days they marched&mdash;up
one river, across a low divide; down another river; up a third,
until at the end of the twenty-fifth day they camped upon a
mountainside, from the summit of which they hoped to catch their
first view of the marvelous city of treasure.</p>

<p>Early the next morning they were climbing the almost
perpendicular crags which formed the last, but greatest, natural
barrier between them and their destination. It was nearly noon
before Tarzan, who headed the thin line of climbing warriors,
scrambled over the top of the last cliff and stood upon the
little flat table-land of the mountaintop.</p>

<p>On either hand towered mighty peaks thousands of feet higher
than the pass through which they were entering the forbidden
valley.</p>

<p>Behind him stretched the wooded valley across which they had
marched for many days, and at the opposite side the low range
which marked the boundary of their own country.</p>

<p>But before him was the view that centered his attention. Here
lay a desolate valley&mdash;a shallow, narrow valley dotted with
stunted trees and covered with many great boulders. And on the
far side of the valley lay what appeared to be a mighty city, its
great walls, its lofty spires, its turrets, minarets, and domes
showing red and yellow in the sunlight. Tarzan was yet too far
away to note the marks of ruin&mdash;to him it appeared a
wonderful city of magnificent beauty, and in imagination he
peopled its broad avenues and its huge temples with a throng of
happy, active people.</p>

<p>For an hour the little expedition rested upon the mountain-
top, and then Tarzan led them down into the valley below. There
was no trail, but the way was less arduous than the ascent of the
opposite face of the mountain had been. Once in the valley their
progress was rapid, so that it was still light when they halted
before the towering walls of the ancient city.</p>

<p>The outer wall was fifty feet in height where it had not
fallen into ruin, but nowhere as far as they could see had more
than ten or twenty feet of the upper courses fallen away. It was
still a formidable defense. On several occasions Tarzan had
thought that he discerned things moving behind the ruined
portions of the wall near to them, as though creatures were
watching them from behind the bulwarks of the ancient pile. And
often he felt the sensation of unseen eyes upon him, but not once
could he be sure that it was more than imagination.</p>

<p>That night they camped outside the city. Once, at midnight,
they were awakened by a shrill scream from beyond the great wall.
It was very high at first, descending gradually until it ended in
a series of dismal moans. It had a strange effect upon the
blacks, almost paralyzing them with terror while it lasted, and
it was an hour before the camp settled down to sleep once more.
In the morning the effects of it were still visible in the
fearful, sidelong glances that the Waziri continually cast at the
massive and forbidding structure which loomed above them.</p>

<p>It required considerable encouragement and urging on Tarzan's
part to prevent the blacks from abandoning the venture on the
spot and hastening back across the valley toward the cliffs they
had scaled the day before. But at length, by dint of commands,
and threats that he would enter the city alone, they agreed to
accompany him.</p>

<p>For fifteen minutes they marched along the face of the wall
before they discovered a means of ingress. Then they came to a
narrow cleft about twenty inches wide. Within, a flight of
concrete steps, worn hollow by centuries of use, rose before
them, to disappear at a sharp turning of the passage a few yards
ahead.</p>

<p>Into this narrow alley Tarzan made his way, turning his giant
shoulders sideways that they might enter at all. Behind him
trailed his black warriors. At the turn in the cleft the stairs
ended, and the path was level; but it wound and twisted in a
serpentine fashion, until suddenly at a sharp angle it debouched
upon a narrow court, across which loomed an inner wall equally as
high as the outer. This inner wall was set with little round
towers alternating along its entire summit with pointed
monoliths. In places these had fallen, and the wall was ruined,
but it was in a much better state of preservation than the outer
wall.</p>

<p>Another narrow passage led through this wall, and at its end
Tarzan and his warriors found themselves in a broad avenue, on
the opposite side of which crumbling edifices of hewn granite
loomed dark and forbidding. Upon the crumbling debris along the
face of the buildings trees had grown, and vines wound in and out
of the hollow, staring windows; but the building directly
opposite them seemed less overgrown than the others, and in a
much better state of preservation. It was a massive pile,
surmounted by an enormous dome. At either side of its great
entrance stood rows of tall pillars, each capped by a huge,
grotesque bird carved from the solid rock of the monoliths.</p>

<p>As the ape-man and his companions stood gazing in varying
degrees of wonderment at this ancient city in the midst of savage
Africa, several of them became aware of movement within the
structure at which they were looking. Dim, shadowy shapes
appeared to be moving about in the semi-darkness of the interior.
There was nothing tangible that the eye could grasp&mdash;only an
uncanny suggestion of life where it seemed that there should be
no life, for living things seemed out of place in this weird,
dead city of the long-dead past.</p>

<p>Tarzan recalled something that he had read in the library at
Paris of a lost race of white men that native legend described as
living in the heart of Africa. He wondered if he were not looking
upon the ruins of the civilization that this strange people had
wrought amid the savage surroundings of their strange and savage
home. Could it be possible that even now a remnant of that lost
race inhabited the ruined grandeur that had once been their
progenitor? Again he became conscious of a stealthy movement
within the great temple before him. "Come!" he said, to his
Waziri. "Let us have a look at what lies behind those ruined
walls." His men were loath to follow him, but when they saw that
he was bravely entering the frowning portal they trailed a few
paces behind in a huddled group that seemed the personification
of nervous terror. A single shriek such as they had heard the
night before would have been sufficient to have sent them all
racing madly for the narrow cleft that led through the great
walls to the outer world.</p>

<p>As Tarzan entered the building he was distinctly aware of many
eyes upon him. There was a rustling in the shadows of a near-by
corridor, and he could have sworn that he saw a human hand
withdrawn from an embrasure that opened above him into the
domelike rotunda in which he found himself.</p>

<p>The floor of the chamber was of concrete, the walls of smooth
granite, upon which strange figures of men and beasts were
carved.</p>

<p>In places tablets of yellow metal had been set in the solid
masonry of the walls.</p>

<p>When he approached closer to one of these tablets he saw that
it was of gold, and bore many hieroglyphics. Beyond this first
chamber there were others, and back of them the building branched
out into enormous wings. Tarzan passed through several of these
chambers, finding many evidences of the fabulous wealth of the
original builders. In one room were seven pillars of solid gold,
and in another the floor itself was of the precious metal. And
all the while that he explored, his blacks huddled close together
at his back, and strange shapes hovered upon either hand and
before them and behind, yet never close enough that any might say
that they were not alone.</p>

<p>The strain, however, was telling upon the nerves of the
Waziri.</p>

<p>They begged Tarzan to return to the sunlight. They said that
no good could come of such an expedition, for the ruins were
haunted by the spirits of the dead who had once inhabited
them.</p>

<p>"They are watching us, O king," whispered Busuli. "They are
waiting until they have led us into the innermost recesses of
their stronghold, and then they will fall upon us and tear us to
pieces with their teeth. That is the way with spirits. My
mother's uncle, who is a great witch doctor, has told me all
about it many times."</p>

<p>Tarzan laughed.</p>

<p>"Run back into the sunlight, my children," he said. "I will
join you when I have searched this old ruin from top to bottom,
and found the gold, or found that there is none. At least we may
take the tablets from the walls, though the pillars are too heavy
for us to handle; but there should be great storerooms filled
with gold&mdash;gold that we can carry away upon our backs with
ease. Run on now, out into the fresh air where you may breathe
easier."</p>

<p>Some of the warriors started to obey their chief with
alacrity, but Busuli and several others hesitated to leave
him&mdash;hesitated between love and loyalty for their king, and
superstitious fear of the unknown. And then, quite unexpectedly,
that occurred which decided the question without the necessity
for further discussion.</p>

<p>Out of the silence of the ruined temple there rang, close to
their ears, the same hideous shriek they had heard the previous
night, and with horrified cries the black warriors turned and
fled through the empty halls of the age-old edifice.</p>

<p>Behind them stood Tarzan of the Apes where they had left him,
a grim smile upon his lips&mdash;waiting for the enemy he fully
expected was about to pounce upon him. But again silence reigned,
except for the faint suggestion of the sound of naked feet moving
stealthily in near-by places.</p>

<p>Then Tarzan wheeled and passed on into the depths of the
temple.</p>

<p>From room to room he went, until he came to one at which a
rude, barred door still stood, and as he put his shoulder against
it to push it in, again the shriek of warning rang out almost
beside him.</p>

<p>It was evident that he was being warned to refrain from
desecrating this particular room. Or could it be that within lay
the secret to the treasure stores? At any rate, the very fact
that the strange, invisible guardians of this weird place had
some reason for wishing him not to enter this particular chamber
was sufficient to treble Tarzan's desire to do so, and though the
shrieking was repeated continuously, he kept his shoulder to the
door until it gave before his giant strength to swing open upon
creaking wooden hinges.</p>

<p>Within all was black as the tomb. There was no window to let
in the faintest ray of light, and as the corridor upon which it
opened was itself in semi-darkness, even the open door shed no
relieving rays within. Feeling before him upon the floor with the
butt of his spear, Tarzan entered the Stygian gloom. Suddenly the
door behind him closed, and at the same time hands clutched him
from every direction out of the darkness.</p>

<p>The ape-man fought with all the savage fury of self-
preservation backed by the herculean strength that was his. But
though he felt his blows land, and his teeth sink into soft
flesh, there seemed always two new hands to take the place of
those that he fought off. At last they dragged him down, and
slowly, very slowly, they overcame him by the mere weight of
their numbers. And then they bound him&mdash;his hands behind his
back and his feet trussed up to meet them. He had heard no sound
except the heavy breathing of his antagonists, and the noise of
the battle. He knew not what manner of creatures had captured
him, but that they were human seemed evident from the fact that
they had bound him.</p>

<p>Presently they lifted him from the floor, and half dragging,
half pushing him, they brought him out of the black chamber
through another doorway into an inner courtyard of the temple.
Here he saw his captors. There must have been a hundred of
them&mdash;short, stocky men, with great beards that covered
their faces and fell upon their hairy breasts.</p>

<p>The thick, matted hair upon their heads grew low over their
receding brows, and hung about their shoulders and their backs.
Their crooked legs were short and heavy, their arms long and
muscular.</p>

<p>About their loins they wore the skins of leopards and lions,
and great necklaces of the claws of these same animals depended
upon their breasts. Massive circlets of virgin gold adorned their
arms and legs. For weapons they carried heavy, knotted bludgeons,
and in the belts that confined their single garments each had a
long, wicked-looking knife.</p>

<p>But the feature of them that made the most startling
impression upon their prisoner was their white
skins&mdash;neither in color nor feature was there a trace of the
negroid about them. Yet, with their receding foreheads, wicked
little close-set eyes, and yellow fangs, they were far from
prepossessing in appearance.</p>

<p>During the fight within the dark chamber, and while they had
been dragging Tarzan to the inner court, no word had been spoken,
but now several of them exchanged grunting, monosyllabic
conversation in a language unfamiliar to the ape-man, and
presently they left him lying upon the concrete floor while they
trooped off on their short legs into another part of the temple
beyond the court.</p>

<p>As Tarzan lay there upon his back he saw that the temple
entirely surrounded the little inclosure, and that on all sides
its lofty walls rose high above him. At the top a little patch of
blue sky was visible, and, in one direction, through an
embrasure, he could see foliage, but whether it was beyond or
within the temple he did not know.</p>

<p>About the court, from the ground to the top of the temple,
were series of open galleries, and now and then the captive
caught glimpses of bright eyes gleaming from beneath masses of
tumbling hair, peering down upon him from above.</p>

<p>The ape-man gently tested the strength of the bonds that held
him, and while he could not be sure it seemed that they were of
insufficient strength to withstand the strain of his mighty
muscles when the time came to make a break for freedom; but he
did not dare to put them to the crucial test until darkness had
fallen, or he felt that no spying eyes were upon him.</p>

<p>He had lain within the court for several hours before the
first rays of sunlight penetrated the vertical shaft; almost
simultaneously he heard the pattering of bare feet in the
corridors about him, and a moment later saw the galleries above
fill with crafty faces as a score or more entered the
courtyard.</p>

<p>For a moment every eye was bent upon the noonday sun, and then
in unison the people in the galleries and those in the court
below took up the refrain of a low, weird chant. Presently those
about Tarzan began to dance to the cadence of their solemn song.
They circled him slowly, resembling in their manner of dancing a
number of clumsy, shuffling bears; but as yet they did not look
at him, keeping their little eyes fixed upon the sun.</p>

<p>For ten minutes or more they kept up their monotonous chant
and steps, and then suddenly, and in perfect unison, they turned
toward their victim with upraised bludgeons and emitting fearful
howls, the while they contorted their features into the most
diabolical expressions, they rushed upon him.</p>

<p>At the same instant a female figure dashed into the midst of
the bloodthirsty horde, and, with a bludgeon similar to their
own, except that it was wrought from gold, beat back the
advancing men.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap20" id="chap20">XX. &mdash; LA</a></h2>

<div align="center"> <img src="fr100053-images/TheReturnOfTarzan-20.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration"> </div><br>

<p class="first">For a moment Tarzan thought that by some strange
freak of fate a miracle had saved him, but when he realized the
ease with which the girl had, single-handed, beaten off twenty
gorilla-like males, and an instant later, as he saw them again
take up their dance about him while she addressed them in a
singsong monotone, which bore every evidence of rote, he came to
the conclusion that it was all but a part of the ceremony of
which he was the central figure.</p>

<p>After a moment or two the girl drew a knife from her girdle,
and, leaning over Tarzan, cut the bonds from his legs. Then, as
the men stopped their dance, and approached, she motioned to him
to rise.</p>

<p>Placing the rope that had been about his legs around his neck,
she led him across the courtyard, the men following in twos.</p>

<p>Through winding corridors she led, farther and farther into
the remoter precincts of the temple, until they came to a great
chamber in the center of which stood an altar. Then it was that
Tarzan translated the strange ceremony that had preceded his
introduction into this holy of holies.</p>

<p>He had fallen into the hands of descendants of the ancient sun
worshippers. His seeming rescue by a votaress of the high
priestess of the sun had been but a part of the mimicry of their
heathen ceremony&mdash;the sun looking down upon him through the
opening at the top of the court had claimed him as his own, and
the priestess had come from the inner temple to save him from the
polluting hands of worldlings&mdash;to save him as a human
offering to their flaming deity.</p>

<p>And had he needed further assurance as to the correctness of
his theory he had only to cast his eyes upon the brownish-red
stains that caked the stone altar and covered the floor in its
immediate vicinity, or to the human skulls which grinned from
countless niches in the towering walls.</p>

<p>The priestess led the victim to the altar steps. Again the
galleries above filled with watchers, while from an arched
doorway at the east end of the chamber a procession of females
filed slowly into the room. They wore, like the men, only skins
of wild animals caught about their waists with rawhide belts or
chains of gold; but the black masses of their hair were encrusted
with golden headgear composed of many circular and oval pieces of
gold ingeniously held together to form a metal cap from which
depended at each side of the head, long strings of oval pieces
falling to the waist.</p>

<p>The females were more symmetrically proportioned than the
males, their features were much more perfect, the shapes of their
heads and their large, soft, black eyes denoting far greater
intelligence and humanity than was possessed by their lords and
masters.</p>

<p>Each priestess bore two golden cups, and as they formed in
line along one side of the altar the men formed opposite them,
advancing and taking each a cup from the female opposite. Then
the chant began once more, and presently from a dark passageway
beyond the altar another female emerged from the cavernous depths
beneath the chamber.</p>

<p>The high priestess, thought Tarzan. She was a young woman with
a rather intelligent and shapely face. Her ornaments were similar
to those worn by her votaries, but much more elaborate, many
being set with diamonds. Her bare arms and legs were almost
concealed by the massive, bejeweled ornaments which covered them,
while her single leopard skin was supported by a close-fitting
girdle of golden rings set in strange designs with innumerable
small diamonds. In the girdle she carried a long, jeweled knife,
and in her hand a slender wand in lieu of a bludgeon.</p>

<p>As she advanced to the opposite side of the altar she halted,
and the chanting ceased. The priests and priestesses knelt before
her, while with wand extended above them she recited a long and
tiresome prayer. Her voice was soft and musical&mdash;Tarzan
could scarce realize that its possessor in a moment more would be
transformed by the fanatical ecstasy of religious zeal into a
wild-eyed and bloodthirsty executioner, who, with dripping knife,
would be the first to drink her victim's red, warm blood from the
little golden cup that stood upon the altar.</p>

<p>As she finished her prayer she let her eyes rest for the first
time upon Tarzan. With every indication of considerable curiosity
she examined him from head to foot. Then she addressed him, and
when she had finished stood waiting, as though she expected a
reply.</p>

<p>"I do not understand your language," said Tarzan. "Possibly we
may speak together in another tongue?" But she could not
understand him, though he tried French, English, Arab, Waziri,
and, as a last resort, the mongrel tongue of the West Coast.</p>

<p>She shook her head, and it seemed that there was a note of
weariness in her voice as she motioned to the priests to continue
with the rites. These now circled in a repetition of their
idiotic dance, which was terminated finally at a command from the
priestess, who had stood throughout, still looking intently upon
Tarzan.</p>

<p>At her signal the priests rushed upon the ape-man, and,
lifting him bodily, laid him upon his back across the altar, his
head hanging over one edge, his legs over the opposite. Then they
and the priestesses formed in two lines, with their little golden
cups in readiness to capture a share of the victim's lifeblood
after the sacrificial knife had accomplished its work.</p>

<p>In the line of priests an altercation arose as to who should
have first place. A burly brute with all the refined intelligence
of a gorilla stamped upon his bestial face was attempting to push
a smaller man to second place, but the smaller one appealed to
the high priestess, who in a cold peremptory voice sent the
larger to the extreme end of the line. Tarzan could hear him
growling and rumbling as he went slowly to the inferior
station.</p>

<p>Then the priestess, standing above him, began reciting what
Tarzan took to be an invocation, the while she slowly raised her
thin, sharp knife aloft. It seemed ages to the ape-man before her
arm ceased its upward progress and the knife halted high above
his unprotected breast.</p>

<p>Then it started downward, slowly at first, but as the
incantation increased in rapidity, with greater speed. At the end
of the line Tarzan could still hear the grumbling of the
disgruntled priest.</p>

<p>The man's voice rose louder and louder. A priestess near him
spoke in sharp tones of rebuke. The knife was quite near to
Tarzan's breast now, but it halted for an instant as the high
priestess raised her eyes to shoot her swift displeasure at the
instigator of this sacrilegious interruption.</p>

<p>There was a sudden commotion in the direction of the
disputants, and Tarzan rolled his head in their direction in time
to see the burly brute of a priest leap upon the woman opposite
him, dashing out her brains with a single blow of his heavy
cudgel. Then that happened which Tarzan had witnessed a hundred
times before among the wild denizens of his own savage jungle. He
had seen the thing fall upon Kerchak, and Tublat, and Terkoz;
upon a dozen of the other mighty bull apes of his tribe; and upon
Tantor, the elephant; there was scarce any of the males of the
forest that did not at times fall prey to it. The priest went
mad, and with his heavy bludgeon ran amuck among his fellows.</p>

<p>His screams of rage were frightful as he dashed hither and
thither, dealing terrific blows with his giant weapon, or sinking
his yellow fangs into the flesh of some luckless victim. And
during it the priestess stood with poised knife above Tarzan, her
eyes fixed in horror upon the maniacal thing that was dealing out
death and destruction to her votaries.</p>

<p>Presently the room was emptied except for the dead and dying
on the floor, the victim upon the altar, the high priestess, and
the madman. As the cunning eyes of the latter fell upon the woman
they lighted with a new and sudden lust. Slowly he crept toward
her, and now he spoke; but this time there fell upon Tarzan's
surprised ears a language he could understand; the last one that
he would ever have thought of employing in attempting to converse
with human beings&mdash;the low guttural barking of the tribe of
great anthropoids&mdash;his own mother tongue. And the woman
answered the man in the same language.</p>

<p>He was threatening&mdash;she attempting to reason with him,
for it was quite evident that she saw that he was past her
authority. The brute was quite close now&mdash;creeping with
clawlike hands extended toward her around the end of the altar.
Tarzan strained at the bonds which held his arms pinioned behind
him. The woman did not see&mdash;she had forgotten her prey in
the horror of the danger that threatened herself. As the brute
leaped past Tarzan to clutch his victim, the ape-man gave one
superhuman wrench at the thongs that held him. The effort sent
him rolling from the altar to the stone floor on the opposite
side from that on which the priestess stood; but as he sprang to
his feet the thongs dropped from his freed arms, and at the same
time he realized that he was alone in the inner temple&mdash;the
high priestess and the mad priest had disappeared.</p>

<p>And then a muffled scream came from the cavernous mouth of the
dark hole beyond the sacrificial altar through which the
priestess had entered the temple. Without even a thought for his
own safety, or the possibility for escape which this rapid series
of fortuitous circumstances had thrust upon him, Tarzan of the
Apes answered the call of the woman in danger. With a little
bound he was at the gaping entrance to the subterranean chamber,
and a moment later was running down a flight of age-old concrete
steps that led he knew not where.</p>

<p>The faint light that filtered in from above showed him a
large, low-ceiled vault from which several doorways led off into
inky darkness, but there was no need to thread an unknown way,
for there before him lay the objects of his search&mdash;the mad
brute had the girl upon the floor, and gorilla-like fingers were
clutching frantically at her throat as she struggled to escape
the fury of the awful thing upon her.</p>

<p>As Tarzan's heavy hand fell upon his shoulder the priest
dropped his victim, and turned upon her would-be rescuer. With
foam-flecked lips and bared fangs the mad sun-worshiper battled
with the tenfold power of the maniac. In the blood lust of his
fury the creature had undergone a sudden reversion to type, which
left him a wild beast, forgetful of the dagger that projected
from his belt&mdash;thinking only of nature's weapons with which
his brute prototype had battled.</p>

<p>But if he could use his teeth and hands to advantage, he found
one even better versed in the school of savage warfare to which
he had reverted, for Tarzan of the Apes closed with him, and they
fell to the floor tearing and rending at one another like two
bull apes; while the primitive priestess stood flattened against
the wall, watching with wide, fear-fascinated eyes the growling,
snapping beasts at her feet.</p>

<p>At last she saw the stranger close one mighty hand upon the
throat of his antagonist, and as he forced the bruteman's head
far back rain blow after blow upon the upturned face. A moment
later he threw the still thing from him, and, arising, shook
himself like a lion. He placed a foot upon the carcass before
him, and raised his head to give the victory cry of his kind, but
as his eyes fell upon the opening above him leading into the
temple of human sacrifice he thought better of his intended
act.</p>

<p>The girl, who had been half paralyzed by fear as the two men
fought, had just commenced to give thought to her probable fate
now that, though released from the clutches of a madman, she had
fallen into the hands of one whom but a moment before she had
been upon the point of killing. She looked about for some means
of escape. The black mouth of a diverging corridor was near at
hand, but as she turned to dart into it the ape-man's eyes fell
upon her, and with a quick leap he was at her side, and a
restraining hand was laid upon her arm.</p>

<p>"Wait!" said Tarzan of the Apes, in the language of the tribe
of Kerchak.</p>

<p>The girl looked at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Who are you," she whispered, "who speaks the language of the
first man?"</p>

<p>"I am Tarzan of the Apes," he answered in the vernacular of
the anthropoids.</p>

<p>"What do you want of me?" she continued. "For what purpose did
you save me from Tha?"</p>

<p>"I could not see a woman murdered?" It was a half question
that answered her.</p>

<p>"But what do you intend to do with me now?" she continued.</p>

<p>"Nothing," he replied, "but you can do something for
me&mdash;you can lead me out of this place to freedom." He made
the suggestion without the slightest thought that she would
accede. He felt quite sure that the sacrifice would go on from
the point where it had been interrupted if the high priestess had
her way, though he was equally positive that they would find
Tarzan of the Apes unbound and with a long dagger in his hand a
much less tractable victim than Tarzan disarmed and bound.</p>

<p>The girl stood looking at him for a long moment before she
spoke.</p>

<p>"You are a very wonderful man," she said. "You are such a man
as I have seen in my daydreams ever since I was a little girl.
You are such a man as I imagine the forbears of my people must
have been&mdash;the great race of people who built this mighty
city in the heart of a savage world that they might wrest from
the bowels of the earth the fabulous wealth for which they had
sacrificed their far-distant civilization.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand why you came to my rescue in the first
place, and now I cannot understand why, having me within your
power, you do not wish to be revenged upon me for having
sentenced you to death&mdash;for having almost put you to death
with my own hand."</p>

<p>"I presume," replied the ape-man, "that you but followed the
teachings of your religion. I cannot blame <i>you</i> for that,
no matter what I may think of your creed. But who are
you&mdash;what people have I fallen among?"</p>

<p>"I am La, high priestess of the Temple of the Sun, in the city
of Opar. We are descendants of a people who came to this savage
world more than ten thousand years ago in search of gold. Their
cities stretched from a great sea under the rising sun to a great
sea into which the sun descends at night to cool his flaming
brow. They were very rich and very powerful, but they lived only
a few months of the year in their magnificent palaces here; the
rest of the time they spent in their native land, far, far to the
north.</p>

<p>"Many ships went back and forth between this new world and the
old. During the rainy season there were but few of the
inhabitants remained here, only those who superintended the
working of the mines by the black slaves, and the merchants who
had to stay to supply their wants, and the soldiers who guarded
the cities and the mines.</p>

<p>"It was at one of these times that the great calamity
occurred. When the time came for the teeming thousands to return
none came. For weeks the people waited. Then they sent out a
great galley to learn why no one came from the mother country,
but though they sailed about for many months, they were unable to
find any trace of the mighty land that had for countless ages
borne their ancient civilization&mdash;it had sunk into the
sea.</p>

<p>"From that day dated the downfall of my people. Disheartened
and unhappy, they soon became a prey to the black hordes of the
north and the black hordes of the south. One by one the cities
were deserted or overcome. The last remnant was finally forced to
take shelter within this mighty mountain fortress. Slowly we have
dwindled in power, in civilization, in intellect, in numbers,
until now we are no more than a small tribe of savage apes.</p>

<p>"In fact, the apes live with us, and have for many ages. We
call them the first men&mdash;we speak their language quite as
much as we do our own; only in the rituals of the temple do we
make any attempt to retain our mother tongue. In time it will be
forgotten, and we will speak only the language of the apes; in
time we will no longer banish those of our people who mate with
apes, and so in time we shall descend to the very beasts from
which ages ago our progenitors may have sprung."</p>

<p>"But why are you more human than the others?" asked the
man.</p>

<p>"For some reason the women have not reverted to savagery so
rapidly as the men. It may be because only the lower types of men
remained here at the time of the great catastrophe, while the
temples were filled with the noblest daughters of the race. My
strain has remained clearer than the rest because for countless
ages my foremothers were high priestesses&mdash;the sacred office
descends from mother to daughter. Our husbands are chosen for us
from the noblest in the land. The most perfect man, mentally and
physically, is selected to be the husband of the high
priestess."</p>

<p>"From what I saw of the gentlemen above," said Tarzan, with a
grin, "there should be little trouble in choosing from among
them." The girl looked at him quizzically for a moment.</p>

<p>"Do not be sacrilegious," she said. "They are very holy
men&mdash;they are priests."</p>

<p>"Then there are others who are better to look upon?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"The others are all more ugly than the priests," she
replied.</p>

<p>Tarzan shuddered at her fate, for even in the dim light of the
vault he was impressed by her beauty.</p>

<p>"But how about myself?" he asked suddenly. "Are you going to
lead me to liberty?"</p>

<p>"You have been chosen by The Flaming God as his own," she
answered solemnly. "Not even I have the power to save
you&mdash;should they find you again. But I do not intend that
they shall find you. You risked your life to save mine. I may do
no less for you. It will be no easy matter&mdash;it may require
days; but in the end I think that I can lead you beyond the
walls. Come, they will look here for me presently, and if they
find us together we shall both be lost&mdash;they would kill me
did they think that I had proved false to my god."</p>

<p>"You must not take the risk, then," he said quickly. "I will
return to the temple, and if I can fight my way to freedom there
will be no suspicion thrown upon you." But she would not have it
so, and finally persuaded him to follow her, saying that they had
already remained in the vault too long to prevent suspicion from
falling upon her even if they returned to the temple.</p>

<p>"I will hide you, and then return alone," she said, "telling
them that I was long unconscious after you killed Tha, and that I
do not know whither you escaped." And so she led him through
winding corridors of gloom, until finally they came to a small
chamber into which a little light filtered through a stone
grating in the ceiling.</p>

<p>"This is the Chamber of the Dead," she said. "None will think
of searching here for you&mdash;they would not dare. I will
return after it is dark. By that time I may have found a plan to
effect your escape." She was gone, and Tarzan of the Apes was
left alone in the Chamber of the Dead, beneath the long-dead city
of Opar.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap21" id="chap21">XXI. &mdash; THE
CASTAWAYS</a></h2>

<div align="center"> <img src="fr100053-images/TheReturnOfTarzan-21.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration"> </div><br>

<p class="first">Clayton dreamed that he was drinking his fill of
water, pure, delightful drafts of fresh water. With a start he
gained consciousness to find himself wet through by torrents of
rain that were falling upon his body and his upturned face. A
heavy tropical shower was beating down upon them. He opened his
mouth and drank. Presently he was so revived and strengthened
that he was enabled to raise himself upon his hands. Across his
legs lay Monsieur Thuran. A few feet aft Jane Porter was huddled
in a pitiful little heap in the bottom of the boat&mdash;she was
quite still. Clayton knew that she was dead.</p>

<p>After infinite labor he released himself from Thuran's
pinioning body, and with renewed strength crawled toward the
girl. He raised her head from the rough boards of the boat's
bottom. There might be life in that poor, starved frame even yet.
He could not quite abandon all hope, and so he seized a water-
soaked rag and squeezed the precious drops between the swollen
lips of the hideous thing that had but a few short days before
glowed with the resplendent life of happy youth and glorious
beauty.</p>

<p>For some time there was no sign of returning animation, but at
last his efforts were rewarded by a slight tremor of the half-
closed lids. He chafed the thin hands, and forced a few more
drops of water into the parched throat. The girl opened her eyes,
looking up at him for a long time before she could recall her
surroundings.</p>

<p>"Water?" she whispered. "Are we saved?"</p>

<p>"It is raining," he explained. "We may at least drink. Already
it has revived us both."</p>

<p>"Monsieur Thuran?" she asked. "He did not kill you. Is he
dead?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," replied Clayton. "If he lives and this rain
revives him&mdash;" But he stopped there, remembering too late
that he must not add further to the horrors which the girl
already had endured.</p>

<p>But she guessed what he would have said.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" she asked.</p>

<p>Clayton nodded his head toward the prostrate form of the
Russian.</p>

<p>For a time neither spoke.</p>

<p>"I will see if I can revive him," said Clayton at length.</p>

<p>"No," she whispered, extending a detaining hand toward him.
"Do not do that&mdash;he will kill you when the water has given
him strength. If he is dying, let him die. Do not leave me alone
in this boat with that beast."</p>

<p>Clayton hesitated. His honor demanded that he attempt to
revive Thuran, and there was the possibility, too, that the
Russian was beyond human aid. It was not dishonorable to hope so.
As he sat fighting out his battle he presently raised his eyes
from the body of the man, and as they passed above the gunwale of
the boat he staggered weakly to his feet with a little cry of
joy.</p>

<p>"Land, Jane!" he almost shouted through his cracked lips.
"Thank God, land!"</p>

<p>The girl looked, too, and there, not a hundred yards away, she
saw a yellow beach, and, beyond, the luxurious foliage of a
tropical jungle.</p>

<p>"Now you may revive him," said Jane Porter, for she, too, had
been haunted with the pangs of conscience which had resulted from
her decision to prevent Clayton from offering succor to their
companion.</p>

<p>It required the better part of half an hour before the Russian
evinced sufficient symptoms of returning consciousness to open
his eyes, and it was some time later before they could bring him
to a realization of their good fortune. By this time the boat was
scraping gently upon the sandy bottom.</p>

<p>Between the refreshing water that he had drunk and the
stimulus of renewed hope, Clayton found strength to stagger
through the shallow water to the shore with a line made fast to
the boat's bow. This he fastened to a small tree which grew at
the top of a low bank, for the tide was at flood, and he feared
that the boat might carry them all out to sea again with the ebb,
since it was quite likely that it would be beyond his strength to
get Jane Porter to the shore for several hours. Next he managed
to stagger and crawl toward the near-by jungle, where he had seen
evidences of profusion of tropical fruit. His former experience
in the jungle of Tarzan of the Apes had taught him which of the
many growing things were edible, and after nearly an hour of
absence he returned to the beach with a little armful of
food.</p>

<p>The rain had ceased, and the hot sun was beating down so
mercilessly upon her that Jane Porter insisted on making an
immediate attempt to gain the land. Still further invigorated by
the food Clayton had brought, the three were able to reach the
half shade of the small tree to which their boat was moored.
Here, thoroughly exhausted, they threw themselves down to rest,
sleeping until dark.</p>

<p>For a month they lived upon the beach in comparative safety.
As their strength returned the two men constructed a rude shelter
in the branches of a tree, high enough from the ground to insure
safety from the larger beasts of prey. By day they gathered
fruits and trapped small rodents; at night they lay cowering
within their frail shelter while savage denizens of the jungle
made hideous the hours of darkness.</p>

<p>They slept upon litters of jungle grasses, and for covering at
night Jane Porter had only an old ulster that belonged to
Clayton, the same garment that he had worn upon that memorable
trip to the Wisconsin woods. Clayton had erected a frail
partition of boughs to divide their arboreal shelter into two
rooms&mdash;one for the girl and the other for Monsieur Thuran
and himself.</p>

<p>From the first the Russian had exhibited every trait of his
true character&mdash;selfishness, boorishness, arrogance,
cowardice, and lust. Twice had he and Clayton come to blows
because of Thuran's attitude toward the girl. Clayton dared not
leave her alone with him for an instant. The existence of the
Englishman and his fiancee was one continual nightmare of horror,
and yet they lived on in hope of ultimate rescue.</p>

<p>Jane Porter's thoughts often reverted to her other experience
on this savage shore. Ah, if the invincible forest god of that
dead past were but with them now. No longer would there be aught
to fear from prowling beasts, or from the bestial Russian. She
could not well refrain from comparing the scant protection
afforded her by Clayton with what she might have expected had
Tarzan of the Apes been for a single instant confronted by the
sinister and menacing attitude of Monsieur Thuran. Once, when
Clayton had gone to the little stream for water, and Thuran had
spoken coarsely to her, she voiced her thoughts.</p>

<p>"It is well for you, Monsieur Thuran," she said, "that the
poor Monsieur Tarzan who was lost from the ship that brought you
and Miss Strong to Cape Town is not here now."</p>

<p>"You knew the pig?" asked Thuran, with a sneer.</p>

<p>"I knew the man," she replied. "The only real man, I think,
that I have ever known." There was something in her tone of voice
that led the Russian to attribute to her a deeper feeling for his
enemy than friendship, and he grasped at the suggestion to be
further revenged upon the man whom he supposed dead by
besmirching his memory to the girl.</p>

<p>"He was worse than a pig," he cried. "He was a poltroon and a
coward. To save himself from the righteous wrath of the husband
of a woman he had wronged, he perjured his soul in an attempt to
place the blame entirely upon her. Not succeeding in this, he ran
away from France to escape meeting the husband upon the field of
honor. That is why he was on board the ship that bore Miss Strong
and myself to Cape Town. I know whereof I speak, for the woman in
the case is my sister. Something more I know that I have never
told another&mdash;your brave Monsieur Tarzan leaped overboard in
an agony of fear because I recognized him, and insisted that he
make reparation to me the following morning&mdash;we could have
fought with knives in my stateroom." Jane Porter laughed. "You do
not for a moment imagine that one who has known both Monsieur
Tarzan and you could ever believe such an impossible tale?"</p>

<p>"Then why did he travel under an assumed name?" asked Monsieur
Thuran.</p>

<p>"I do not believe you," she cried, but nevertheless the seed
of suspicion was sown, for she knew that Hazel Strong had known
her forest god only as John Caldwell, of London.</p>

<p>A scant five miles north of their rude shelter, all unknown to
them, and practically as remote as though separated by thousands
of miles of impenetrable jungle, lay the snug little cabin of
Tarzan of the Apes. While farther up the coast, a few miles
beyond the cabin, in crude but well-built shelters, lived a
little party of eighteen souls&mdash;the occupants of the three
boats from the <i>Lady Alice</i> from which Clayton's boat had
become separated.</p>

<p>Over a smooth sea they had rowed to the mainland in less than
three days. None of the horrors of shipwreck had been theirs, and
though depressed by sorrow, and suffering from the shock of the
catastrophe and the unaccustomed hardships of their new existence
there was none much the worse for the experience.</p>

<p>All were buoyed by the hope that the fourth boat had been
picked up, and that a thorough search of the coast would be
quickly made.</p>

<p>As all the firearms and ammunition on the yacht had been
placed in Lord Tennington's boat, the party was well equipped for
defense, and for hunting the larger game for food.</p>

<p>Professor Archimedes Q. Porter was their only immediate
anxiety.</p>

<p>Fully assured in his own mind that his daughter had been
picked up by a passing steamer, he gave over the last vestige of
apprehension concerning her welfare, and devoted his giant
intellect solely to the consideration of those momentous and
abstruse scientific problems which he considered the only proper
food for thought in one of his erudition. His mind appeared blank
to the influence of all extraneous matters.</p>

<p>"Never," said the exhausted Mr. Samuel T. Philander, to Lord
Tennington, "never has Professor Porter been more
difficult&mdash;er&mdash;I might say, impossible. Why, only this
morning, after I had been forced to relinquish my surveillance
for a brief half hour he was entirely missing upon my return.
And, bless me, sir, where do you imagine I discovered him? A half
mile out in the ocean, sir, in one of the lifeboats, rowing away
for dear life. I do not know how he attained even that
magnificent distance from shore, for he had but a single oar,
with which he was blissfully rowing about in circles.</p>

<p>"When one of the sailors had taken me out to him in another
boat the professor became quite indignant at my suggestion that
we return at once to land. 'Why, Mr. Philander,' he said, 'I am
surprised that you, sir, a man of letters yourself, should have
the temerity so to interrupt the progress of science. I had about
deduced from certain astronomic phenomena I have had under minute
observation during the past several tropic nights an entirely new
nebular hypothesis which will unquestionably startle the
scientific world. I wish to consult a very excellent monograph on
Laplace's hypothesis, which I understand is in a certain private
collection in New York City. Your interference, Mr. Philander,
will result in an irreparable delay, for I was just rowing over
to obtain this pamphlet.' And it was with the greatest difficulty
that I persuaded him to return to shore, without resorting to
force," concluded Mr. Philander.</p>

<p>Miss Strong and her mother were very brave under the strain of
almost constant apprehension of the attacks of savage beasts. Nor
were they quite able to accept so readily as the others the
theory that Jane, Clayton, and Monsieur Thuran had been picked up
safely.</p>

<p>Jane Porter's Esmeralda was in a constant state of tears at
the cruel fate which had separated her from her "po, li'le
honey." Lord Tennington's great-hearted good nature never
deserted him for a moment. He was still the jovial host, seeking
always for the comfort and pleasure of his guests. With the men
of his yacht he remained the just but firm commander&mdash;there
was never any more question in the jungle than there had been on
board the <i>Lady Alice</i> as to who was the final authority in
all questions of importance, and in all emergencies requiring
cool and intelligent leadership.</p>

<p>Could this well-organized and comparatively secure party of
castaways have seen the ragged, fear-haunted trio a few miles
south of them they would scarcely have recognized in them the
formerly immaculate members of the little company that had
laughed and played upon the <i>Lady Alice</i>. Clayton and
Monsieur Thuran were almost naked, so torn had their clothes been
by the thorn bushes and tangled vegetation of the matted jungle
through which they had been compelled to force their way in
search of their ever more difficult food supply.</p>

<p>Jane Porter had of course not been subjected to these
strenuous expeditions, but her apparel was, nevertheless, in a
sad state of disrepair.</p>

<p>Clayton, for lack of any better occupation, had carefully
saved the skin of every animal they had killed. By stretching
them upon the stems of trees, and diligently scraping them, he
had managed to save them in a fair condition, and now that his
clothes were threatening to cover his nakedness no longer, he
commenced to fashion a rude garment of them, using a sharp thorn
for a needle, and bits of tough grass and animal tendons in lieu
of thread.</p>

<p>The result when completed was a sleeveless garment which fell
nearly to his knees. As it was made up of numerous small pelts of
different species of rodents, it presented a rather strange and
wonderful appearance, which, together with the vile stench which
permeated it, rendered it anything other than a desirable
addition to a wardrobe. But the time came when for the sake of
decency he was compelled to don it, and even the misery of their
condition could not prevent Jane Porter from laughing heartily at
sight of him.</p>

<p>Later, Thuran also found it necessary to construct a similar
primitive garment, so that, with their bare legs and heavily
bearded faces, they looked not unlike reincarnations of two
prehistoric progenitors of the human race. Thuran acted like
one.</p>

<p>Nearly two months of this existence had passed when the first
great calamity befell them. It was prefaced by an adventure which
came near terminating abruptly the sufferings of two of
them&mdash;terminating them in the grim and horrible manner of
the jungle, forever.</p>

<p>Thuran, down with an attack of jungle fever, lay in the
shelter among the branches of their tree of refuge. Clayton had
been into the jungle a few hundred yards in search of food. As he
returned Jane Porter walked to meet him. Behind the man, cunning
and crafty, crept an old and mangy lion. For three days his
ancient thews and sinews had proved insufficient for the task of
providing his cavernous belly with meat. For months he had eaten
less and less frequently, and farther and farther had he roamed
from his accustomed haunts in search of easier prey. At last he
had found nature's weakest and most defenseless creature&mdash;in
a moment more Numa would dine.</p>

<p>Clayton, all unconscious of the lurking death behind him,
strode out into the open toward Jane. He had reached her side, a
hundred feet from the tangled edge of jungle when past his
shoulder the girl saw the tawny head and the wicked yellow eyes
as the grasses parted, and the huge beast, nose to ground,
stepped softly into view.</p>

<p>So frozen with horror was she that she could utter no sound,
but the fixed and terrified gaze of her fear-widened eyes spoke
as plainly to Clayton as words. A quick glance behind him
revealed the hopelessness of their situation. The lion was scarce
thirty paces from them, and they were equally as far from the
shelter. The man was armed with a stout stick&mdash;as
efficacious against a hungry lion, he realized, as a toy pop-gun
charged with a tethered cork.</p>

<p>Numa, ravenous with hunger, had long since learned the
futility of roaring and moaning as he searched for prey, but now
that it was as surely his as though already he had felt the soft
flesh beneath his still mighty paw, he opened his huge jaws, and
gave vent to his long-pent rage in a series of deafening roars
that made the air tremble.</p>

<p>"Run, Jane!" cried Clayton. "Quick! Run for the shelter!" But
her paralyzed muscles refused to respond, and she stood mute and
rigid, staring with ghastly countenance at the living death
creeping toward them.</p>

<p>Thuran, at the sound of that awful roar, had come to the
opening of the shelter, and as he saw the tableau below him he
hopped up and down, shrieking to them in Russian.</p>

<p>"Run! Run!" he cried. "Run, or I shall be left all alone in
this horrible place," and then he broke down and commenced to
weep. For a moment this new voice distracted the attention of the
lion, who halted to cast an inquiring glance in the direction of
the tree.</p>

<p>Clayton could endure the strain no longer. Turning his back
upon the beast, he buried his head in his arms and waited.</p>

<p>The girl looked at him in horror. Why did he not do something?
If he must die, why not die like a man&mdash;bravely; beating at
that terrible face with his puny stick, no matter how futile it
might be. Would Tarzan of the Apes have done thus? Would he not
at least have gone down to his death fighting heroically to the
last? Now the lion was crouching for the spring that would end
their young lives beneath cruel, rending, yellow fangs. Jane
Porter sank to her knees in prayer, closing her eyes to shut out
the last hideous instant. Thuran, weak from fever, fainted.</p>

<p>Seconds dragged into minutes, long minutes into an eternity,
and yet the beast did not spring. Clayton was almost unconscious
from the prolonged agony of fright&mdash;his knees
trembled&mdash;a moment more and he would collapse.</p>

<p>Jane Porter could endure it no longer. She opened her eyes.
Could she be dreaming? "William," she whispered; "look!" Clayton
mastered himself sufficiently to raise his head and turn toward
the lion. An ejaculation of surprise burst from his lips.</p>

<p>At their very feet the beast lay crumpled in death. A heavy
war spear protruded from the tawny hide. It had entered the great
back above the right shoulder, and, passing entirely through the
body, had pierced the savage heart.</p>

<p>Jane Porter had risen to her feet; as Clayton turned back to
her she staggered in weakness. He put out his arms to save her
from falling, and then drew her close to him&mdash;pressing her
head against his shoulder, he stooped to kiss her in
thanksgiving.</p>

<p>Gently the girl pushed him away.</p>

<p>"Please do not do that, William," she said. "I have lived a
thousand years in the past brief moments. I have learned in the
face of death how to live. I do not wish to hurt you more than is
necessary; but I can no longer bear to live out the impossible
position I have attempted because of a false sense of loyalty to
an impulsive promise I made you.</p>

<p>"The last few seconds of my life have taught me that it would
be hideous to attempt further to deceive myself and you, or to
entertain for an instant longer the possibility of ever becoming
your wife, should we regain civilization."</p>

<p>"Why, Jane," he cried, "what do you mean? What has our
providential rescue to do with altering your feelings toward me?
You are but unstrung&mdash;tomorrow you will be yourself
again."</p>

<p>"I am more nearly myself this minute than I have been for over
a year," she replied. "The thing that has just happened has again
forced to my memory the fact that the bravest man that ever lived
honored me with his love. Until it was too late I did not realize
that I returned it, and so I sent him away. He is dead now, and I
shall never marry. I certainly could not wed another less brave
than he without harboring constantly a feeling of contempt for
the relative cowardice of my husband. Do you understand me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, with bowed head, his face mantling with
the flush of shame.</p>

<p>And it was the next day that the great calamity befell.</p>

<h2><a name="chap22" id="chap22">XXII. &mdash; THE TREASURE
VAULTS OF OPAR</a></h2>

<div align="center"> <img src="fr100053-images/TheReturnOfTarzan-22.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration"> </div><br>

<p class="first">It was quite dark before La, the high priestess,
returned to the Chamber of the Dead with food and drink for
Tarzan. She bore no light, feeling with her hands along the
crumbling walls until she gained the chamber. Through the stone
grating above, a tropic moon served dimly to illuminate the
interior.</p>

<p>Tarzan, crouching in the shadows at the far side of the room
as the first sound of approaching footsteps reached him, came
forth to meet the girl as he recognized that it was she.</p>

<p>"They are furious," were her first words. "Never before has a
human sacrifice escaped the altar. Already fifty have gone forth
to track you down. They have searched the temple&mdash;all save
this single room."</p>

<p>"Why do they fear to come here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It is the Chamber of the Dead. Here the dead return to
worship. See this ancient altar? It is here that the dead
sacrifice the living&mdash;if they find a victim here. That is
the reason our people shun this chamber. Were one to enter he
knows that the waiting dead would seize him for their
sacrifice."</p>

<p>"But you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am high priestess&mdash;I alone am safe from the dead. It
is I who at rare intervals bring them a human sacrifice from the
world above. I alone may enter here in safety."</p>

<p>"Why have they not seized me?" he asked, humoring her
grotesque belief.</p>

<p>She looked at him quizzically for a moment. Then she
replied:</p>

<p>"It is the duty of a high priestess to instruct, to
interpret&mdash;according to the creed that others, wiser than
herself, have laid down; but there is nothing in the creed which
says that she must believe. The more one knows of one's religion
the less one believes&mdash;no one living knows more of mine than
I."</p>

<p>"Then your only fear in aiding me to escape is that your
fellow mortals may discover your duplicity?"</p>

<p>"That is all&mdash;the dead are dead; they cannot
harm&mdash;or help. We must therefore depend entirely upon
ourselves, and the sooner we act the better it will be. I had
difficulty in eluding their vigilance but now in bringing you
this morsel of food. To attempt to repeat the thing daily would
be the height of folly. Come, let us see how far we may go toward
liberty before I must return."</p>

<p>She led him back to the chamber beneath the altar room. Here
she turned into one of the several corridors leading from it. In
the darkness Tarzan could not see which one. For ten minutes they
groped slowly along a winding passage, until at length they came
to a closed door. Here he heard her fumbling with a key, and
presently came the sound of a metal bolt grating against
metal.</p>

<p>The door swung in on scraping hinges, and they entered.</p>

<p>"You will be safe here until tomorrow night," she said.</p>

<p>Then she went out, and, closing the door, locked it behind
her.</p>

<p>Where Tarzan stood it was dark as Erebus. Not even his trained
eyes could penetrate the utter blackness. Cautiously he moved
forward until his out-stretched hand touched a wall, then very
slowly he traveled around the four walls of the chamber.</p>

<p>Apparently it was about twenty feet square. The floor was of
concrete, the walls of the dry masonry that marked the method of
construction above ground. Small pieces of granite of various
sizes were ingeniously laid together without mortar to construct
these ancient foundations.</p>

<p>The first time around the walls Tarzan thought he detected a
strange phenomenon for a room with no windows but a single door.
Again he crept carefully around close to the wall. No, he could
not be mistaken! He paused before the center of the wall opposite
the door. For a moment he stood quite motionless, then he moved a
few feet to one side. Again he returned, only to move a few feet
to the other side.</p>

<p>Once more he made the entire circuit of the room, feeling
carefully every foot of the walls. Finally he stopped again
before the particular section that had aroused his curiosity.
There was no doubt of it! A distinct draft of fresh air was
blowing into the chamber through the intersection of the masonry
at that particular point&mdash;and nowhere else.</p>

<p>Tarzan tested several pieces of the granite which made up the
wall at this spot, and finally was rewarded by finding one which
lifted out readily. It was about ten inches wide, with a face
some three by six inches showing within the chamber. One by one
the ape-man lifted out similarly shaped stones. The wall at this
point was constructed entirely, it seemed, of these almost
perfect slabs.</p>

<p>In a short time he had removed some dozen, when he reached in
to test the next layer of masonry. To his surprise, he felt
nothing behind the masonry he had removed as far as his long arm
could reach.</p>

<p>It was a matter of but a few minutes to remove enough of the
wall to permit his body to pass through the aperture. Directly
ahead of him he thought he discerned a faint glow&mdash;scarcely
more than a less impenetrable darkness. Cautiously he moved
forward on hands and knees, until at about fifteen feet, or the
average thickness of the foundation walls, the floor ended
abruptly in a sudden drop.</p>

<p>As far out as he could reach he felt nothing, nor could he
find the bottom of the black abyss that yawned before him,
though, clinging to the edge of the floor, he lowered his body
into the darkness to its full length.</p>

<p>Finally it occurred to him to look up, and there above him he
saw through a round opening a tiny circular patch of starry
sky.</p>

<p>Feeling up along the sides of the shaft as far as he could
reach, the ape-man discovered that so much of the wall as he
could feel converged toward the center of the shaft as it rose.
This fact precluded possibility of escape in that direction.</p>

<p>As he sat speculating on the nature and uses of this strange
passage and its terminal shaft, the moon topped the opening
above, letting a flood of soft, silvery light into the shadowy
place. Instantly the nature of the shaft became apparent to
Tarzan, for far below him he saw the shimmering surface of water.
He had come upon an ancient well&mdash;but what was the purpose
of the connection between the well and the dungeon in which he
had been hidden? As the moon crossed the opening of the shaft its
light flooded the whole interior, and then Tarzan saw directly
across from him another opening in the opposite wall. He wondered
if this might not be the mouth of a passage leading to possible
escape. It would be worth investigating, at least, and this he
determined to do.</p>

<p>Quickly returning to the wall he had demolished to explore
what lay beyond it, he carried the stones into the passageway and
replaced them from that side. The deep deposit of dust which he
had noticed upon the blocks as he had first removed them from the
wall had convinced him that even if the present occupants of the
ancient pile had knowledge of this hidden passage they had made
no use of it for perhaps generations.</p>

<p>The wall replaced, Tarzan turned to the shaft, which was some
fifteen feet wide at this point. To leap across the intervening
space was a small matter to the ape-man, and a moment later he
was proceeding along a narrow tunnel, moving cautiously for fear
of being precipitated into another shaft such as he had just
crossed.</p>

<p>He had advanced some hundred feet when he came to a flight of
steps leading downward into Stygian gloom. Some twenty feet
below, the level floor of the tunnel recommenced, and shortly
afterward his progress was stopped by a heavy wooden door which
was secured by massive wooden bars upon the side of Tarzan's
approach. This fact suggested to the ape-man that he might surely
be in a passageway leading to the outer world, for the bolts,
barring progress from the opposite side, tended to substantiate
this hypothesis, unless it were merely a prison to which it
led.</p>

<p>Along the tops of the bars were deep layers of dust&mdash;a
further indication that the passage had lain long unused. As he
pushed the massive obstacle aside, its great hinges shrieked out
in weird protest against this unaccustomed disturbance. For a
moment Tarzan paused to listen for any responsive note which
might indicate that the unusual night noise had alarmed the
inmates of the temple; but as he heard nothing he advanced beyond
the doorway.</p>

<p>Carefully feeling about, he found himself within a large
chamber, along the walls of which, and down the length of the
floor, were piled many tiers of metal ingots of an odd though
uniform shape.</p>

<p>To his groping hands they felt not unlike double-headed
bootjacks.</p>

<p>The ingots were quite heavy, and but for the enormous number
of them he would have been positive that they were gold; but the
thought of the fabulous wealth these thousands of pounds of metal
would have represented were they in reality gold, almost
convinced him that they must be of some baser metal.</p>

<p>At the far end of the chamber he discovered another barred
door, and again the bars upon the inside renewed the hope that he
was traversing an ancient and forgotten passageway to liberty.
Beyond the door the passage ran straight as a war spear, and it
soon became evident to the ape-man that it had already led him
beyond the outer walls of the temple. If he but knew the
direction it was leading him! If toward the west, then he must
also be beyond the city's outer walls.</p>

<p>With increasing hopes he forged ahead as rapidly as he dared,
until at the end of half an hour he came to another flight of
steps leading upward. At the bottom this flight was of concrete,
but as he ascended his naked feet felt a sudden change in the
substance they were treading. The steps of concrete had given
place to steps of granite. Feeling with his hands, the ape-man
discovered that these latter were evidently hewed from rock, for
there was no crack to indicate a joint.</p>

<p>For a hundred feet the steps wound spirally up, until at a
sudden turning Tarzan came into a narrow cleft between two rocky
walls.</p>

<p>Above him shone the starry sky, and before him a steep incline
replaced the steps that had terminated at its foot. Up this
pathway Tarzan hastened, and at its upper end came out upon the
rough top of a huge granite boulder.</p>

<p>A mile away lay the ruined city of Opar, its domes and turrets
bathed in the soft light of the equatorial moon. Tarzan dropped
his eyes to the ingot he had brought away with him. For a moment
he examined it by the moon's bright rays, then he raised his head
to look out upon the ancient piles of crumbling grandeur in the
distance.</p>

<p>"Opar," he mused, "Opar, the enchanted city of a dead and
forgotten past. The city of the beauties and the beasts. City of
horrors and death; but&mdash;city of fabulous riches." The ingot
was of virgin gold.</p>

<p>The boulder on which Tarzan found himself lay well out in the
plain between the city and the distant cliffs he and his black
warriors had scaled the morning previous. To descend its rough
and precipitous face was a task of infinite labor and
considerable peril even to the ape-man; but at last he felt the
soft soil of the valley beneath his feet, and without a backward
glance at Opar he turned his face toward the guardian cliffs, and
at a rapid trot set off across the valley.</p>

<p>The sun was just rising as he gained the summit of the flat
mountain at the valley's western boundary. Far beneath him he saw
smoke arising above the tree-tops of the forest at the base of
the foothills.</p>

<p>"Man," he murmured. "And there were fifty who went forth to
track me down. Can it be they?" Swiftly he descended the face of
the cliff, and, dropping into a narrow ravine which led down to
the far forest, he hastened onward in the direction of the smoke.
Striking the forest's edge about a quarter of a mile from the
point at which the slender column arose into the still air, he
took to the trees. Cautiously he approached until there suddenly
burst upon his view a rude <i>boma</i>, in the center of which,
squatted about their tiny fires, sat his fifty black Waziri. He
called to them in their own tongue: "Arise, my children, and
greet thy king!" With exclamations of surprise and fear the
warriors leaped to their feet, scarcely knowing whether to flee
or not. Then Tarzan dropped lightly from an overhanging branch
into their midst. When they realized that it was indeed their
chief in the flesh, and no materialized spirit, they went mad
with joy.</p>

<p>"We were cowards, oh, Waziri," cried Busuli. "We ran away and
left you to your fate; but when our panic was over we swore to
return and save you, or at least take revenge upon your
murderers. We were but now preparing to scale the heights once
more and cross the desolate valley to the terrible city."</p>

<p>"Have you seen fifty frightful men pass down from the cliffs
into this forest, my children?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Yes, Waziri," replied Busuli. "They passed us late yesterday,
as we were about to turn back after you. They had no woodcraft.
We heard them coming for a mile before we saw them, and as we had
other business in hand we withdrew into the forest and let them
pass. They were waddling rapidly along upon short legs, and now
and then one would go upon all fours like Bolgani, the gorilla.
They were indeed fifty frightful men, Waziri."</p>

<p>When Tarzan had related his adventures and told them of the
yellow metal he had found, not one demurred when he outlined a
plan to return by night and bring away what they could carry of
the vast treasure; and so it was that as dusk fell across the
desolate valley of Opar fifty ebon warriors trailed at a smart
trot over the dry and dusty ground toward the giant boulder that
loomed before the city.</p>

<p>If it had seemed a difficult task to descend the face of the
boulder, Tarzan soon found that it would be next to impossible to
get his fifty warriors to the summit. Finally the feat was
accomplished by dint of herculean efforts upon the part of the
ape-man. Ten spears were fastened end to end, and with one end of
this remarkable chain attached to his waist, Tarzan at last
succeeded in reaching the summit.</p>

<p>Once there, he drew up one of his blacks, and in this way the
entire party was finally landed in safety upon the boulder's
top.</p>

<p>Immediately Tarzan led them to the treasure chamber, where to
each was allotted a load of two ingots, for each about eighty
pounds.</p>

<p>By midnight the entire party stood once more at the foot of
the boulder, but with their heavy loads it was mid-forenoon ere
they reached the summit of the cliffs. From there on the homeward
journey was slow, as these proud fighting men were unaccustomed
to the duties of porters. But they bore their burdens
uncomplainingly, and at the end of thirty days entered their own
country.</p>

<p>Here, instead of continuing on toward the northwest and their
village, Tarzan guided them almost directly west, until on the
morning of the thirty-third day he bade them break camp and
return to their own village, leaving the gold where they had
stacked it the previous night.</p>

<p>"And you, Waziri?" they asked.</p>

<p>"I shall remain here for a few days, my children," he
replied.</p>

<p>"Now hasten back to thy wives and children." When they had
gone Tarzan gathered up two of the ingots and, springing into a
tree, ran lightly above the tangled and impenetrable mass of
undergrowth for a couple of hundred yards, to emerge suddenly
upon a circular clearing about which the giants of the jungle
forest towered like a guardian host. In the center of this
natural amphitheater, was a little flat-topped mound of hard
earth.</p>

<p>Hundreds of times before had Tarzan been to this secluded
spot, which was so densely surrounded by thorn bushes and tangled
vines and creepers of huge girth that not even Sheeta, the
leopard, could worm his sinuous way within, nor Tantor, with his
giant strength, force the barriers which protected the council
chamber of the great apes from all but the harmless denizens of
the savage jungle.</p>

<p>Fifty trips Tarzan made before he had deposited all the ingots
within the precincts of the amphitheater. Then from the hollow of
an ancient, lightning-blasted tree he produced the very spade
with which he had uncovered the chest of Professor Archimedes Q.
Porter which he had once, apelike, buried in this selfsame spot.
With this he dug a long trench, into which he laid the fortune
that his blacks had carried from the forgotten treasure vaults of
the city of Opar.</p>

<p>That night he slept within the amphitheater, and early the
next morning set out to revisit his cabin before returning to his
Waziri.</p>

<p>Finding things as he had left them, he went forth into the
jungle to hunt, intending to bring his prey to the cabin where he
might feast in comfort, spending the night upon a comfortable
couch.</p>

<p>For five miles toward the south he roamed, toward the banks of
a fair-sized river that flowed into the sea about six miles from
his cabin. He had gone inland about half a mile when there came
suddenly to his trained nostrils the one scent that sets the
whole savage jungle aquiver&mdash;Tarzan smelled man.</p>

<p>The wind was blowing off the ocean, so Tarzan knew that the
authors of the scent were west of him. Mixed with the man scent
was the scent of Numa. Man and lion. "I had better hasten,"
thought the ape-man, for he had recognized the scent of whites.
"Numa may be a-hunting." When he came through the trees to the
edge of the jungle he saw a woman kneeling in prayer, and before
her stood a wild, primitive-looking white man, his face buried in
his arms. Behind the man a mangy lion was advancing slowly toward
this easy prey. The man's face was averted; the woman's bowed in
prayer. He could not see the features of either.</p>

<p>Already Numa was about to spring. There was not a second to
spare.</p>

<p>Tarzan could not even unsling his bow and fit an arrow in time
to send one of his deadly poisoned shafts into the yellow hide.
He was too far away to reach the beast in time with his knife.
There was but a single hope&mdash;a lone alternative. And with
the quickness of thought the ape-man acted.</p>

<p>A brawny arm flew back&mdash;for the briefest fraction of an
instant a huge spear poised above the giant's shoulder&mdash;and
then the mighty arm shot out, and swift death tore through the
intervening leaves to bury itself in the heart of the leaping
lion. Without a sound he rolled over at the very feet of his
intended victims&mdash;dead.</p>

<p>For a moment neither the man nor the woman moved. Then the
latter opened her eyes to look with wonder upon the dead beast
behind her companion. As that beautiful head went up Tarzan of
the Apes gave a gasp of incredulous astonishment. Was he mad? It
could not be the woman he loved! But, indeed, it was none
other.</p>

<p>And the woman rose, and the man took her in his arms to kiss
her, and of a sudden the ape-man saw red through a bloody mist of
murder, and the old scar upon his forehead burned scarlet against
his brown hide.</p>

<p>There was a terrible expression upon his savage face as he
fitted a poisoned shaft to his bow. An ugly light gleamed in
those gray eyes as he sighted full at the back of the
unsuspecting man beneath him.</p>

<p>For an instant he glanced along the polished shaft, drawing
the bowstring far back, that the arrow might pierce through the
heart for which it was aimed.</p>

<p>But he did not release the fatal messenger. Slowly the point
of the arrow drooped; the scar upon the brown forehead faded; the
bowstring relaxed; and Tarzan of the Apes, with bowed head,
turned sadly into the jungle toward the village of the
Waziri.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap23" id="chap23">XXIII. THE FIFTY FRIGHTFUL
MEN</a></h2>

<div align="center"> <img src="fr100053-images/TheReturnOfTarzan-23.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration"> </div><br>

<p class="first">For several long minutes Jane Porter and William
Cecil Clayton stood silently looking at the dead body of the
beast whose prey they had so narrowly escaped becoming.</p>

<p>The girl was the first to speak again after her outbreak of
impulsive avowal.</p>

<p>"Who could it have been?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"God knows!" was the man's only reply.</p>

<p>"If it is a friend, why does he not show himself?" continued
Jane.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be well to call out to him, and at least thank
him?" Mechanically Clayton did her bidding, but there was no
response.</p>

<p>Jane Porter shuddered. "The mysterious jungle," she murmured.
"The terrible jungle. It renders even the manifestations of
friendship terrifying."</p>

<p>"We had best return to the shelter," said Clayton. "You will
be at least a little safer there. I am no protection whatever,"
he added bitterly.</p>

<p>"Do not say that, William," she hastened to urge, acutely
sorry for the wound her words had caused. "You have done the best
you could. You have been noble, and self-sacrificing, and brave.
It is no fault of yours that you are not a superman. There is
only one other man I have ever known who could have done more
than you. My words were ill chosen in the excitement of the
reaction&mdash;I did not wish to wound you. All that I wish is
that we may both understand once and for all that I can never
marry you&mdash;that such a marriage would be wicked."</p>

<p>"I think I understand," he replied. "Let us not speak of it
again&mdash;at least until we are back in civilization."</p>

<p>The next day Thuran was worse. Almost constantly he was in a
state of delirium. They could do nothing to relieve him, nor was
Clayton over-anxious to attempt anything. On the girl's account
he feared the Russian&mdash;in the bottom of his heart he hoped
the man would die. The thought that something might befall him
that would leave her entirely at the mercy of this beast caused
him greater anxiety than the probability that almost certain
death awaited her should she be left entirely alone upon the
outskirts of the cruel forest.</p>

<p>The Englishman had extracted the heavy spear from the body of
the lion, so that when he went into the forest to hunt that
morning he had a feeling of much greater security than at any
time since they had been cast upon the savage shore. The result
was that he penetrated farther from the shelter than ever
before.</p>

<p>To escape as far as possible from the mad ravings of the
fever-stricken Russian, Jane Porter had descended from the
shelter to the foot of the tree&mdash;she dared not venture
farther. Here, beside the crude ladder Clayton had constructed
for her, she sat looking out to sea, in the always surviving hope
that a vessel might be sighted.</p>

<p>Her back was toward the jungle, and so she did not see the
grasses part, or the savage face that peered from between.
Little, bloodshot, close-set eyes scanned her intently, roving
from time to time about the open beach for indications of the
presence of others than herself. Presently another head appeared,
and then another and another. The man in the shelter commenced to
rave again, and the heads disappeared as silently and as suddenly
as they had come. But soon they were thrust forth once more, as
the girl gave no sign of perturbation at the continued wailing of
the man above.</p>

<p>One by one grotesque forms emerged from the jungle to creep
stealthily upon the unsuspecting woman. A faint rustling of the
grasses attracted her attention. She turned, and at the sight
that confronted her staggered to her feet with a little shriek of
fear. Then they closed upon her with a rush. Lifting her bodily
in his long, gorilla-like arms, one of the creatures turned and
bore her into the jungle. A filthy paw covered her mouth to
stifle her screams. Added to the weeks of torture she had already
undergone, the shock was more than she could withstand. Shattered
nerves collapsed, and she lost consciousness. When she regained
her senses she found herself in the thick of the primeval forest.
It was night. A huge fire burned brightly in the little clearing
in which she lay. About it squatted fifty frightful men. Their
heads and faces were covered with matted hair. Their long arms
rested upon the bent knees of their short, crooked legs. They
were gnawing, like beasts, upon unclean food. A pot boiled upon
the edge of the fire, and out of it one of the creatures would
occasionally drag a hunk of meat with a sharpened stick.</p>

<p>When they discovered that their captive had regained
consciousness, a piece of this repulsive stew was tossed to her
from the foul hand of a nearby feaster. It rolled close to her
side, but she only closed her eyes as a qualm of nausea surged
through her.</p>

<p>For many days they traveled through the dense forest. The
girl, footsore and exhausted, was half dragged, half pushed
through the long, hot, tedious days. Occasionally, when she would
stumble and fall, she was cuffed and kicked by the nearest of the
frightful men. Long before they reached their journey's end her
shoes had been discarded&mdash;the soles entirely gone. Her
clothes were torn to mere shreds and tatters, and through the
pitiful rags her once white and tender skin showed raw and
bleeding from contact with the thousand pitiless thorns and
brambles through which she had been dragged.</p>

<p>The last two days of the journey found her in such utter
exhaustion that no amount of kicking and abuse could force her to
her poor, bleeding feet. Outraged nature had reached the limit of
endurance, and the girl was physically powerless to raise herself
even to her knees.</p>

<p>As the beasts surrounded her, chattering threateningly the
while they goaded her with their cudgels and beat and kicked her
with their fists and feet, she lay with closed eyes, praying for
the merciful death that she knew alone could give her surcease
from suffering; but it did not come, and presently the fifty
frightful men realized that their victim was no longer able to
walk, and so they picked her up and carried her the balance of
the journey.</p>

<p>Late one afternoon she saw the ruined walls of a mighty city
looming before them, but so weak and sick was she that it
inspired not the faintest shadow of interest. Wherever they were
bearing her, there could be but one end to her captivity among
these fierce half brutes.</p>

<p>At last they passed through two great walls and came to the
ruined city within. Into a crumbling pile they bore her, and here
she was surrounded by hundreds more of the same creatures that
had brought her; but among them were females who looked less
horrible. At sight of them the first faint hope that she had
entertained came to mitigate her misery. But it was short-lived,
for the women offered her no sympathy, though, on the other hand,
neither did they abuse her.</p>

<p>After she had been inspected to the entire satisfaction of the
inmates of the building she was borne to a dark chamber in the
vaults beneath, and here upon the bare floor she was left, with a
metal bowl of water and another of food.</p>

<p>For a week she saw only some of the women whose duty it was to
bring her food and water. Slowly her strength was
returning&mdash;soon she would be in fit condition to offer as a
sacrifice to The Flaming God. Fortunate indeed it was that she
could not know the fate for which she was destined.</p>

<p><br> <br> As Tarzan of the Apes moved slowly through the
jungle after casting the spear that saved Clayton and Jane Porter
from the fangs of Numa, his mind was filled with all the sorrow
that belongs to a freshly opened heart wound.</p>

<p>He was glad that he had stayed his hand in time to prevent the
consummation of the thing that in the first mad wave of jealous
wrath he had contemplated. Only the fraction of a second had
stood between Clayton and death at the hands of the ape-man. In
the short moment that had elapsed after he had recognized the
girl and her companion and the relaxing of the taut muscles that
held the poisoned shaft directed at the Englishman's heart,
Tarzan had been swayed by the swift and savage impulses of brute
life.</p>

<p>He had seen the woman he craved&mdash;his woman&mdash;his
mate&mdash;in the arms of another. There had been but one course
open to him, according to the fierce jungle code that guided him
in this other existence; but just before it had become too late
the softer sentiments of his inherent chivalry had risen above
the flaming fires of his passion and saved him. A thousand times
he gave thanks that they had triumphed before his fingers had
released that polished arrow.</p>

<p>As he contemplated his return to the Waziri the idea became
repugnant. He did not wish to see a human being again. At least
he would range alone through the jungle for a time, until the
sharp edge of his sorrow had become blunted. Like his fellow
beasts, he preferred to suffer in silence and alone.</p>

<p>That night he slept again in the amphitheater of the apes, and
for several days he hunted from there, returning at night. On the
afternoon of the third day he returned early. He had lain
stretched upon the soft grass of the circular clearing for but a
few moments when he heard far to the south a familiar sound. It
was the passing through the jungle of a band of great
apes&mdash;he could not mistake that. For several minutes he lay
listening. They were coming in the direction of the
amphitheater.</p>

<p>Tarzan arose lazily and stretched himself. His keen ears
followed every movement of the advancing tribe. They were upwind,
and presently he caught their scent, though he had not needed
this added evidence to assure him that he was right.</p>

<p>As they came closer to the amphitheater Tarzan of the Apes
melted into the branches upon the other side of the arena. There
he waited to inspect the newcomers. Nor had he long to wait.</p>

<p>Presently a fierce, hairy face appeared among the lower
branches opposite him. The cruel little eyes took in the clearing
at a glance, then there was a chattered report returned to those
behind.</p>

<p>Tarzan could hear the words. The scout was telling the other
members of the tribe that the coast was clear and that they might
enter the amphitheater in safety.</p>

<p>First the leader dropped lightly upon the soft carpet of the
grassy floor, and then, one by one, nearly a hundred anthropoids
followed him. There were the huge adults and several young. A few
nursing babes clung close to the shaggy necks of their savage
mothers.</p>

<p>Tarzan recognized many members of the tribe. It was the same
into which he had come as a tiny babe. Many of the adults had
been little apes during his boyhood. He had frolicked and played
about this very jungle with them during their brief childhood. He
wondered if they would remember him&mdash;the memory of some apes
is not overlong, and two years may be an eternity to them.</p>

<p>From the talk which he overheard he learned that they had come
to choose a new king&mdash;their late chief had fallen a hundred
feet beneath a broken limb to an untimely end.</p>

<p>Tarzan walked to the end of an overhanging limb in plain view
of them. The quick eyes of a female caught sight of him first.
With a barking guttural she called the attention of the others.
Several huge bulls stood erect to get a better view of the
intruder. With bared fangs and bristling necks they advanced
slowly toward him, with deep-throated, ominous growls.</p>

<p>"Karnath, I am Tarzan of the Apes," said the ape-man in the
vernacular of the tribe. "You remember me. Together we teased
Numa when we were still little apes, throwing sticks and nuts at
him from the safety of high branches." The brute he had addressed
stopped with a look of half-comprehending, dull wonderment upon
his savage face.</p>

<p>"And Magor," continued Tarzan, addressing another, "do you not
recall your former king&mdash;he who slew the mighty Kerchak?
Look at me! Am I not the same Tarzan&mdash;mighty
hunter&mdash;invincible fighter&mdash;that you all knew for many
seasons?" The apes all crowded forward now, but more in curiosity
than threatening. They muttered among themselves for a few
moments.</p>

<p>"What do you want among us now?" asked Karnath.</p>

<p>"Only peace," answered the ape-man.</p>

<p>Again the apes conferred. At length Karnath spoke again.</p>

<p>"Come in peace, then, Tarzan of the Apes," he said.</p>

<p>And so Tarzan of the Apes dropped lightly to the turf into the
midst of the fierce and hideous horde&mdash;he had completed the
cycle of evolution, and had returned to be once again a brute
among brutes.</p>

<p>There were no greetings such as would have taken place among
men after a separation of two years. The majority of the apes
went on about the little activities that the advent of the ape-
man had interrupted, paying no further attention to him than as
though he had not been gone from the tribe at all.</p>

<p>One or two young bulls who had not been old enough to remember
him sidled up on all fours to sniff at him, and one bared his
fangs and growled threateningly&mdash;he wished to put Tarzan
immediately into his proper place. Had Tarzan backed off,
growling, the young bull would quite probably have been
satisfied, but always after Tarzan's station among his fellow
apes would have been beneath that of the bull which had made him
step aside.</p>

<p>But Tarzan of the Apes did not back off. Instead, he swung his
giant palm with all the force of his mighty muscles, and,
catching the young bull alongside the head, sent him sprawling
across the turf. The ape was up and at him again in a second, and
this time they closed with tearing fingers and rending
fangs&mdash;or at least that had been the intention of the young
bull; but scarcely had they gone down, growling and snapping,
than the ape-man's fingers found the throat of his
antagonist.</p>

<p>Presently the young bull ceased to struggle, and lay quite
still.</p>

<p>Then Tarzan released his hold and arose&mdash;he did not wish
to kill, only to teach the young ape, and others who might be
watching, that Tarzan of the Apes was still master.</p>

<p>The lesson served its purpose&mdash;the young apes kept out of
his way, as young apes should when their betters were about, and
the old bulls made no attempt to encroach upon his prerogatives.
For several days the she-apes with young remained suspicious of
him, and when he ventured too near rushed upon him with wide
mouths and hideous roars. Then Tarzan discreetly skipped out of
harm's way, for that also is a custom among the apes&mdash;only
mad bulls will attack a mother. But after a while even they
became accustomed to him.</p>

<p>He hunted with them as in days gone by, and when they found
that his superior reason guided him to the best food sources, and
that his cunning rope ensnared toothsome game that they seldom if
ever tasted, they came again to look up to him as they had in the
past after he had become their king. And so it was that before
they left the amphitheater to return to their wanderings they had
once more chosen him as their leader.</p>

<p>The ape-man felt quite contented with his new lot. He was not
happy&mdash;that he never could be again, but he was at least as
far from everything that might remind him of his past misery as
he could be. Long since he had given up every intention of
returning to civilization, and now he had decided to see no more
his black friends of the Waziri. He had foresworn humanity
forever. He had started life an ape&mdash;as an ape he would
die.</p>

<p>He could not, however, erase from his memory the fact that the
woman he loved was within a short journey of the stamping-ground
of his tribe; nor could he banish the haunting fear that she
might be constantly in danger. That she was illy protected he had
seen in the brief instant that had witnessed Clayton's
inefficiency. The more Tarzan thought of it, the more keenly his
conscience pricked him.</p>

<p>Finally he came to loathe himself for permitting his own
selfish sorrow and jealousy to stand between Jane Porter and
safety. As the days passed the thing preyed more and more upon
his mind, and he had about determined to return to the coast and
place himself on guard over Jane Porter and Clayton, when news
reached him that altered all his plans and sent him dashing madly
toward the east in reckless disregard of accident and death.</p>

<p>Before Tarzan had returned to the tribe, a certain young bull,
not being able to secure a mate from among his own people, had,
according to custom, fared forth through the wild jungle, like
some knight-errant of old, to win a fair lady from some
neighboring community.</p>

<p>He had but just returned with his bride, and was narrating his
adventures quickly before he should forget them. Among other
things he told of seeing a great tribe of strange-looking
apes.</p>

<p>"They were all hairy-faced bulls but one," he said, "and that
one was a she, lighter in color even than this stranger," and he
chucked a thumb at Tarzan.</p>

<p>The ape-man was all attention in an instant. He asked
questions as rapidly as the slow-witted anthropoid could answer
them.</p>

<p>"Were the bulls short, with crooked legs?"</p>

<p>"They were."</p>

<p>"Did they wear the skins of Numa and Sheeta about their loins,
and carry sticks and knives?"</p>

<p>"They did."</p>

<p>"And were there many yellow rings about their arms and
legs?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And the she one&mdash;was she small and slender, and very
white?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did she seem to be one of the tribe, or was she a
prisoner?"</p>

<p>"They dragged her along&mdash;sometimes by an
arm&mdash;sometimes by the long hair that grew upon her head; and
always they kicked and beat her. Oh, but it was great fun to
watch them."</p>

<p>"God!" muttered Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Where were they when you saw them, and which way were they
going?" continued the ape-man.</p>

<p>"They were beside the second water back there," and he pointed
to the south. "When they passed me they were going toward the
morning, upward along the edge of the water."</p>

<p>"When was this?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Half a moon since." Without another word the ape-man sprang
into the trees and fled like a disembodied spirit eastward in the
direction of the forgotten city of Opar.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap24" id="chap24">XXIV. &mdash; HOW TARZAN CAME
AGAIN TO OPAR</a></h2>

<div align="center"> <img src="fr100053-images/TheReturnOfTarzan-24.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration"> </div><br>

<p class="first">When Clayton returned to the shelter and found
Jane Porter was missing, he became frantic with fear and grief.
He found Monsieur Thuran quite rational, the fever having left
him with the surprising suddenness which is one of its
peculiarities. The Russian, weak and exhausted, still lay upon
his bed of grasses within the shelter.</p>

<p>When Clayton asked him about the girl he seemed surprised to
know that she was not there.</p>

<p>"I have heard nothing unusual," he said. "But then I have been
unconscious much of the time." Had it not been for the man's very
evident weakness, Clayton should have suspected him of having
sinister knowledge of the girl's whereabouts; but he could see
that Thuran lacked sufficient vitality even to descend, unaided,
from the shelter. He could not, in his present physical
condition, have harmed the girl, nor could he have climbed the
rude ladder back to the shelter.</p>

<p>Until dark the Englishman searched the nearby jungle for a
trace of the missing one or a sign of the trail of her abductor.
But though the spoor left by the fifty frightful men, unversed in
woodcraft as they were, would have been as plain to the densest
denizen of the jungle as a city street to the Englishman, yet he
crossed and recrossed it twenty times without observing the
slightest indication that many men had passed that way but a few
short hours since.</p>

<p>As he searched, Clayton continued to call the girl's name
aloud, but the only result of this was to attract Numa, the lion.
Fortunately the man saw the shadowy form worming its way toward
him in time to climb into the branches of a tree before the beast
was close enough to reach him. This put an end to his search for
the balance of the afternoon, as the lion paced back and forth
beneath him until dark.</p>

<p>Even after the beast had left, Clayton dared not descend into
the awful blackness beneath him, and so he spent a terrifying and
hideous night in the tree. The next morning he returned to the
beach, relinquishing the last hope of succoring Jane Porter.</p>

<p>During the week that followed, Monsieur Thuran rapidly
regained his strength, lying in the shelter while Clayton hunted
food for both. The men never spoke except as necessity demanded.
Clayton now occupied the section of the shelter which had been
reserved for Jane Porter, and only saw the Russian when he took
food or water to him, or performed the other kindly offices which
common humanity required.</p>

<p>When Thuran was again able to descend in search of food,
Clayton was stricken with fever. For days he lay tossing in
delirium and suffering, but not once did the Russian come near
him. Food the Englishman could not have eaten, but his craving
for water amounted practically to torture. Between the recurrent
attacks of delirium, weak though he was, he managed to reach the
brook once a day and fill a tiny can that had been among the few
appointments of the lifeboat.</p>

<p>Thuran watched him on these occasions with an expression of
malignant pleasure&mdash;he seemed really to enjoy the suffering
of the man who, despite the just contempt in which he held him,
had ministered to him to the best of his ability while he lay
suffering the same agonies. At last Clayton became so weak that
he was no longer able to descend from the shelter. For a day he
suffered for water without appealing to the Russian, but finally,
unable to endure it longer, he asked Thuran to fetch him a drink.
The Russian came to the entrance to Clayton's room, a dish of
water in his hand. A nasty grin contorted his features.</p>

<p>"Here is water," he said. "But first let me remind you that
you maligned me before the girl&mdash;that you kept her to
yourself, and would not share her with me&mdash;"</p>

<p>Clayton interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Stop!" he cried. "Stop! What manner of cur are you that you
traduce the character of a good woman whom we believe dead! God!
I was a fool ever to let you live&mdash;you are not fit to live
even in this vile land."</p>

<p>"Here is your water," said the Russian. "All you will get,"
and he raised the basin to his lips and drank; what was left he
threw out upon the ground below. Then he turned and left the sick
man.</p>

<p>Clayton rolled over, and, burying his face in his arms, gave
up the battle.</p>

<p>The next day Thuran determined to set out toward the north
along the coast, for he knew that eventually he must come to the
habitations of civilized men&mdash;at least he could be no worse
off than he was here, and, furthermore, the ravings of the dying
Englishman were getting on his nerves. So he stole Clayton's
spear and set off upon his journey. He would have killed the sick
man before he left had it not occurred to him that it would
really have been a kindness to do so.</p>

<p>That same day he came to a little cabin by the beach, and his
heart filled with renewed hope as he saw this evidence of the
proximity of civilization, for he thought it but the outpost of a
nearby settlement. Had he known to whom it belonged, and that its
owner was at that very moment but a few miles inland, Nikolas
Rokoff would have fled the place as he would a pestilence. But he
did not know, and so he remained for a few days to enjoy the
security and comparative comforts of the cabin. Then he took up
his northward journey once more.</p>

<p><br>In Lord Tennington's camp preparations were going
forward to build permanent quarters, and then to send out an
expedition of a few men to the north in search of relief.</p>

<p>As the days had passed without bringing the longed-for succor,
hope that Jane Porter, Clayton, and Monsieur Thuran had been
rescued began to die. No one spoke of the matter longer to
Professor Porter, and he was so immersed in his scientific
dreaming that he was not aware of the elapse of time.</p>

<p>Occasionally he would remark that within a few days they
should certainly see a steamer drop anchor off their shore, and
that then they should all be reunited happily. Sometimes he spoke
of it as a train, and wondered if it were being delayed by
snowstorms.</p>

<p>"If I didn't know the dear old fellow so well by now,"
Tennington remarked to Miss Strong, "I should be quite certain
that he was&mdash;er&mdash;not quite right, don't you know."</p>

<p>"If it were not so pathetic it would be ridiculous," said the
girl, sadly. "I, who have known him all my life, know how he
worships Jane; but to others it must seem that he is perfectly
callous to her fate. It is only that he is so absolutely
impractical that he cannot conceive of so real a thing as death
unless nearly certain proof of it is thrust upon him."</p>

<p>"You'd never guess what he was about yesterday," continued
Tennington.</p>

<p>"I was coming in alone from a little hunt when I met him
walking rapidly along the game trail that I was following back to
camp. His hands were clasped beneath the tails of his long black
coat, and his top hat was set firmly down upon his head, as with
eyes bent upon the ground he hastened on, probably to some sudden
death had I not intercepted him.</p>

<p>"'Why, where in the world are you bound, professor?' I asked
him.</p>

<p>"'I am going into town, Lord Tennington,' he said, as
seriously as possible, 'to complain to the postmaster about the
rural free delivery service we are suffering from here. Why, sir,
I haven't had a piece of mail in weeks. There should be several
letters for me from Jane. The matter must be reported to
Washington at once.'</p>

<p>"And would you believe it, Miss Strong," continued Tennington,
"I had the very deuce of a job to convince the old fellow that
there was not only no rural free delivery, but no town, and that
he was not even on the same continent as Washington, nor in the
same hemisphere.</p>

<p>"When he did realize he commenced to worry about his
daughter&mdash;I think it is the first time that he really has
appreciated our position here, or the fact that Miss Porter may
not have been rescued."</p>

<p>"I hate to think about it," said the girl, "and yet I can
think of nothing else than the absent members of our party."</p>

<p>"Let us hope for the best," replied Tennington. "You yourself
have set us each a splendid example of bravery, for in a way your
loss has been the greatest."</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied; "I could have loved Jane Porter no more
had she been my own sister." Tennington did not show the surprise
he felt. That was not at all what he meant. He had been much with
this fair daughter of Maryland since the wreck of the <i>Lady
Alice</i>, and it had recently come to him that he had grown much
more fond of her than would prove good for the peace of his mind,
for he recalled almost constantly now the confidence which
Monsieur Thuran had imparted to him that he and Miss Strong were
engaged. He wondered if, after all, Thuran had been quite
accurate in his statement. He had never seen the slightest
indication on the girl's part of more than ordinary
friendship.</p>

<p>"And then in Monsieur Thuran's loss, if they are lost, you
would suffer a severe bereavement," he ventured.</p>

<p>She looked up at him quickly. "Monsieur Thuran had become a
very dear friend," she said. "I liked him very much, though I
have known him but a short time."</p>

<p>"Then you were not engaged to marry him?" he blurted out.</p>

<p>"Heavens, no!" she cried. "I did not care for him at all in
that way."</p>

<p>There was something that Lord Tennington wanted to say to
Hazel Strong&mdash;he wanted very badly to say it, and to say it
at once; but somehow the words stuck in his throat. He started
lamely a couple of times, cleared his throat, became red in the
face, and finally ended by remarking that he hoped the cabins
would be finished before the rainy season commenced. But, though
he did not know it, he had conveyed to the girl the very message
he intended, and it left her happy&mdash;happier than she had
ever before been in all her life.</p>

<p>Just then further conversation was interrupted by the sight of
a strange and terrible-looking figure which emerged from the
jungle just south of the camp. Tennington and the girl saw it at
the same time. The Englishman reached for his revolver, but when
the half-naked, bearded creature called his name aloud and came
running toward them he dropped his hand and advanced to meet
it.</p>

<p>None would have recognized in the filthy, emaciated creature,
covered by a single garment of small skins, the immaculate
Monsieur Thuran the party had last seen upon the deck of the
<i>Lady Alice</i>.</p>

<p>Before the other members of the little community were apprised
of his presence Tennington and Miss Strong questioned him
regarding the other occupants of the missing boat.</p>

<p>"They are all dead," replied Thuran. "The three sailors died
before we made land. Miss Porter was carried off into the jungle
by some wild animal while I was lying delirious with fever.
Clayton died of the same fever but a few days since. And to think
that all this time we have been separated by but a few
miles&mdash;scarcely a day's march. It is terrible!"</p>

<p><br> <br> How long Jane Porter lay in the darkness of the
vault beneath the temple in the ancient city of Opar she did not
know. For a time she was delirious with fever, but after this
passed she commenced slowly to regain her strength. Every day the
woman who brought her food beckoned to her to arise, but for many
days the girl could only shake her head to indicate that she was
too weak.</p>

<p>But eventually she was able to gain her feet, and then to
stagger a few steps by supporting herself with one hand upon the
wall. Her captors now watched her with increasing interest. The
day was approaching, and the victim was gaining in strength.</p>

<p>Presently the day came, and a young woman whom Jane Porter had
not seen before came with several others to her dungeon. Here
some sort of ceremony was performed&mdash;that it was of a
religious nature the girl was sure, and so she took new heart,
and rejoiced that she had fallen among people upon whom the
refining and softening influences of religion evidently had
fallen. They would treat her humanely&mdash;of that she was now
quite sure.</p>

<p>And so when they led her from her dungeon, through long, dark
corridors, and up a flight of concrete steps to a brilliant
courtyard, she went willingly, even gladly&mdash;for was she not
among the servants of God? It might be, of course, that their
interpretation of the supreme being differed from her own, but
that they owned a god was sufficient evidence to her that they
were kind and good.</p>

<p>But when she saw a stone altar in the center of the courtyard,
and dark-brown stains upon it and the nearby concrete of the
floor, she began to wonder and to doubt. And as they stooped and
bound her ankles, and secured her wrists behind her, her doubts
were turned to fear. A moment later, as she was lifted and placed
supine across the altar's top, hope left her entirely, and she
trembled in an agony of fright.</p>

<p>During the grotesque dance of the votaries which followed, she
lay frozen in horror, nor did she require the sight of the thin
blade in the hands of the high priestess as it rose slowly above
her to enlighten her further as to her doom.</p>

<p>As the hand began its descent, Jane Porter closed her eyes and
sent up a silent prayer to the Maker she was so soon to
face&mdash;then she succumbed to the strain upon her tired
nerves, and swooned.</p>

<p><br> <br> Day and night Tarzan of the Apes raced through the
primeval forest toward the ruined city in which he was positive
the woman he loved lay either a prisoner or dead.</p>

<p>In a day and a night he covered the same distance that the
fifty frightful men had taken the better part of a week to
traverse, for Tarzan of the Apes traveled along the middle
terrace high above the tangled obstacles that impede progress
upon the ground.</p>

<p>The story the young bull ape had told made it clear to him
that the girl captive had been Jane Porter, for there was not
another small white "she" in all the jungle. The "bulls" he had
recognized from the ape's crude description as the grotesque
parodies upon humanity who inhabit the ruins of Opar. And the
girl's fate he could picture as plainly as though he were an
eyewitness to it.</p>

<p>When they would lay her across that grim altar he could not
guess, but that her dear, frail body would eventually find its
way there he was confident.</p>

<p>But, finally, after what seemed long ages to the impatient
ape-man, he topped the barrier cliffs that hemmed the desolate
valley, and below him lay the grim and awful ruins of the now
hideous city of Opar. At a rapid trot he started across the dry
and dusty, boulder-strewn ground toward the goal of his
desires.</p>

<p>Would he be in time to rescue? He hoped against hope. At least
he could be revenged, and in his wrath it seemed to him that he
was equal to the task of wiping out the entire population of that
terrible city. It was nearly noon when he reached the great
boulder at the top of which terminated the secret passage to the
pits beneath the city. Like a cat he scaled the precipitous sides
of the frowning granite kopje. A moment later he was running
through the darkness of the long, straight tunnel that led to the
treasure vault. Through this he passed, then on and on until at
last he came to the well-like shaft upon the opposite side of
which lay the dungeon with the false wall.</p>

<p>As he paused a moment upon the brink of the well a faint sound
came to him through the opening above. His quick ears caught and
translated it&mdash;it was the dance of death that preceded a
sacrifice, and the singsong ritual of the high priestess. He
could even recognize the woman's voice. Could it be that the
ceremony marked the very thing he had so hastened to prevent? A
wave of horror swept over him. Was he, after all, to be just a
moment too late? Like a frightened deer he leaped across the
narrow chasm to the continuation of the passage beyond. At the
false wall he tore like one possessed to demolish the barrier
that confronted him&mdash;with giant muscles he forced the
opening, thrusting his head and shoulders through the first small
hole he made, and carrying the balance of the wall with him, to
clatter resoundingly upon the cement floor of the dungeon.</p>

<p>With a single leap he cleared the length of the chamber and
threw himself against the ancient door. But here he stopped. The
mighty bars upon the other side were proof even against such
muscles as his.</p>

<p>It needed but a moment's effort to convince him of the
futility of endeavoring to force that impregnable barrier. There
was but one other way, and that led back through the long tunnels
to the boulder a mile beyond the city's walls, and then back
across the open as he had come to the city first with his
Waziri.</p>

<p>He realized that to retrace his steps and enter the city from
above ground would mean that he would be too late to save the
girl, if it were indeed she who lay upon the sacrificial altar
above him.</p>

<p>But there seemed no other way, and so he turned and ran
swiftly back into the passageway beyond the broken wall. At the
well he heard again the monotonous voice of the high priestess,
and, as he glanced aloft, the opening, twenty feet above, seemed
so near that he was tempted to leap for it in a mad endeavor to
reach the inner courtyard that lay so near.</p>

<p>If he could but get one end of his grass rope caught upon some
projection at the top of that tantalizing aperture! In the
instant's pause and thought an idea occurred to him. He would
attempt it.</p>

<p>Turning back to the tumbled wall, he seized one of the large,
flat slabs that had composed it. Hastily making one end of his
rope fast to the piece of granite, he returned to the shaft, and,
coiling the balance of the rope on the floor beside him, the ape-
man took the heavy slab in both hands, and, swinging it several
times to get the distance and the direction fixed, he let the
weight fly up at a slight angle, so that, instead of falling
straight back into the shaft again, it grazed the far edge,
tumbling over into the court beyond.</p>

<p>Tarzan dragged for a moment upon the slack end of the rope
until he felt that the stone was lodged with fair security at the
shaft's top, then he swung out over the black depths beneath. The
moment his full weight came upon the rope he felt it slip from
above. He waited there in awful suspense as it dropped in little
jerks, inch by inch. The stone was being dragged up the outside
of the masonry surrounding the top of the shaft&mdash;would it
catch at the very edge, or would his weight drag it over to fall
upon him as he hurtled into the unknown depths below?</p> <hr>
<br>

PRIMEVAL</a></h2>

<div align="center"> <img src="fr100053-images/TheReturnOfTarzan-25.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration"> </div><br>

<p class="first">For a brief, sickening moment Tarzan felt the
slipping of the rope to which he clung, and heard the scraping of
the block of stone against the masonry above.</p>

<p>Then of a sudden the rope was still&mdash;the stone had caught
at the very edge. Gingerly the ape-man clambered up the frail
rope. In a moment his head was above the edge of the shaft. The
court was empty. The inhabitants of Opar were viewing the
sacrifice. Tarzan could hear the voice of La from the nearby
sacrificial court. The dance had ceased. It must be almost time
for the knife to fall; but even as he thought these things he was
running rapidly toward the sound of the high priestess'
voice.</p>

<p>Fate guided him to the very doorway of the great roofless
chamber.</p>

<p>Between him and the altar was the long row of priests and
priestesses, awaiting with their golden cups the spilling of the
warm blood of their victim. La's hand was descending slowly
toward the bosom of the frail, quiet figure that lay stretched
upon the hard stone.</p>

<p>Tarzan gave a gasp that was almost a sob as he recognized the
features of the girl he loved. And then the scar upon his
forehead turned to a flaming band of scarlet, a red mist floated
before his eyes, and, with the awful roar of the bull ape gone
mad, he sprang like a huge lion into the midst of the
votaries.</p>

<p>Seizing a cudgel from the nearest priest, he laid about him
like a veritable demon as he forged his rapid way toward the
altar. The hand of La had paused at the first noise of
interruption. When she saw who the author of it was she went
white. She had never been able to fathom the secret of the
strange white man's escape from the dungeon in which she had
locked him. She had not intended that he should ever leave Opar,
for she had looked upon his giant frame and handsome face with
the eyes of a woman and not those of a priestess.</p>

<p>In her clever mind she had concocted a story of wonderful
revelation from the lips of the flaming god himself, in which she
had been ordered to receive this white stranger as a messenger
from him to his people on earth. That would satisfy the people of
Opar, she knew. The man would be satisfied, she felt quite sure,
to remain and be her husband rather than to return to the
sacrificial altar.</p>

<p>But when she had gone to explain her plan to him he had
disappeared, though the door had been tightly locked as she had
left it. And now he had returned&mdash;materialized from thin
air&mdash;and was killing her priests as though they had been
sheep. For the moment she forgot her victim, and before she could
gather her wits together again the huge white man was standing
before her, the woman who had lain upon the altar in his
arms.</p>

<p>"One side, La," he cried. "You saved me once, and so I would
not harm you; but do not interfere or attempt to follow, or I
shall have to kill you also." As he spoke he stepped past her
toward the entrance to the subterranean vaults.</p>

<p>"Who is she?" asked the high priestess, pointing at the
unconscious woman.</p>

<p>"She is mine," said Tarzan of the Apes.</p>

<p>For a moment the girl of Opar stood wide-eyed and staring.
Then a look of hopeless misery suffused her eyes&mdash;tears
welled into them, and with a little cry she sank to the cold
floor, just as a swarm of frightful men dashed past her to leap
upon the ape-man.</p>

<p>But Tarzan of the Apes was not there when they reached out to
seize him. With a light bound he had disappeared into the passage
leading to the pits below, and when his pursuers came more
cautiously after they found the chamber empty, they but laughed
and jabbered to one another, for they knew that there was no exit
from the pits other than the one through which he had entered. If
he came out at all he must come this way, and they would wait and
watch for him above.</p>

<p>And so Tarzan of the Apes, carrying the unconscious Jane
Porter, came through the pits of Opar beneath the temple of The
Flaming God without pursuit. But when the men of Opar had talked
further about the matter, they recalled to mind that this very
man had escaped once before into the pits, and, though they had
watched the entrance he had not come forth; and yet today he had
come upon them from the outside. They would again send fifty men
out into the valley to find and capture this desecrater of their
temple.</p>

<p>After Tarzan reached the shaft beyond the broken wall, he felt
so positive of the successful issue of his flight that he stopped
to replace the tumbled stones, for he was not anxious that any of
the inmates should discover this forgotten passage, and through
it come upon the treasure chamber. It was in his mind to return
again to Opar and bear away a still greater fortune than he had
already buried in the amphitheater of the apes.</p>

<p>On through the passageways he trotted, past the first door and
through the treasure vault; past the second door and into the
long, straight tunnel that led to the lofty hidden exit beyond
the city.</p>

<p>Jane Porter was still unconscious.</p>

<p>At the crest of the great boulder he halted to cast a backward
glance toward the city. Coming across the plain he saw a band of
the hideous men of Opar. For a moment he hesitated. Should he
descend and make a race for the distant cliffs, or should he hide
here until night? And then a glance at the girl's white face
determined him. He could not keep her here and permit her enemies
to get between them and liberty. For aught he knew they might
have been followed through the tunnels, and to have foes before
and behind would result in almost certain capture, since he could
not fight his way through the enemy burdened as he was with the
unconscious girl.</p>

<p>To descend the steep face of the boulder with Jane Porter was
no easy task, but by binding her across his shoulders with the
grass rope he succeeded in reaching the ground in safety before
the Oparians arrived at the great rock. As the descent had been
made upon the side away from the city, the searching party saw
nothing of it, nor did they dream that their prey was so close
before them.</p>

<p>By keeping the <i>kopje</i> between them and their pursuers,
Tarzan of the Apes managed to cover nearly a mile before the men
of Opar rounded the granite sentinel and saw the fugitive before
them. With loud cries of savage delight, they broke into a mad
run, thinking doubtless that they would soon overhaul the
burdened runner; but they both underestimated the powers of the
ape-man and overestimated the possibilities of their own short,
crooked legs.</p>

<p>By maintaining an easy trot, Tarzan kept the distance between
them always the same. Occasionally he would glance at the face so
near his own. Had it not been for the faint beating of the heart
pressed so close against his own, he would not have known that
she was alive, so white and drawn was the poor, tired face.</p>

<p>And thus they came to the flat-topped mountain and the barrier
cliffs. During the last mile Tarzan had let himself out, running
like a deer that he might have ample time to descend the face of
the cliffs before the Oparians could reach the summit and hurl
rocks down upon them. And so it was that he was half a mile down
the mountainside ere the fierce little men came panting to the
edge.</p>

<p>With cries of rage and disappointment they ranged along the
cliff top shaking their cudgels, and dancing up and down in a
perfect passion of anger. But this time they did not pursue
beyond the boundary of their own country. Whether it was because
they recalled the futility of their former long and irksome
search, or after witnessing the ease with which the ape-man swung
along before them, and the last burst of speed, they realized the
utter hopelessness of further pursuit, it is difficult to say;
but as Tarzan reached the woods that began at the base of the
foothills which skirted the barrier cliffs they turned their
faces once more toward Opar.</p>

<p>Just within the forest's edge, where he could yet watch the
cliff tops, Tarzan laid his burden upon the grass, and going to
the near-by rivulet brought water with which he bathed her face
and hands; but even this did not revive her, and, greatly
worried, he gathered the girl into his strong arms once more and
hurried on toward the west.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon Jane Porter regained consciousness. She
did not open her eyes at once&mdash;she was trying to recall the
scenes that she had last witnessed. Ah, she remembered now. The
altar, the terrible priestess, the descending knife. She gave a
little shudder, for she thought that either this was death or
that the knife had buried itself in her heart and she was
experiencing the brief delirium preceding death. And when finally
she mustered courage to open her eyes, the sight that met them
confirmed her fears, for she saw that she was being borne through
a leafy paradise in the arms of her dead love. "If this be
death," she murmured, "thank God that I am dead."</p>

<p>"You spoke, Jane!" cried Tarzan. "You are regaining
consciousness!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Tarzan of the Apes," she replied, and for the first time
in months a smile of peace and happiness lighted her face.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" cried the ape-man, coming to the ground in a
little grassy clearing beside the stream. "I was in time, after
all."</p>

<p>"In time? What do you mean?" she questioned.</p>

<p>"In time to save you from death upon the altar, dear," he
replied.</p>

<p>"Do you not remember?"</p>

<p>"Save me from death?" she asked, in a puzzled tone. "Are we
not both dead, my Tarzan?" He had placed her upon the grass by
now, her back resting against the stem of a huge tree. At her
question he stepped back where he could the better see her
face.</p>

<p>"Dead!" he repeated, and then he laughed. "You are not, Jane;
and if you will return to the city of Opar and ask them who dwell
there they will tell you that I was not dead a few short hours
ago. No, dear, we are both very much alive."</p>

<p>"But both Hazel and Monsieur Thuran told me that you had
fallen into the ocean many miles from land," she urged, as though
trying to convince him that he must indeed be dead. "They said
that there was no question but that it must have been you, and
less that you could have survived or been picked up."</p>

<p>"How can I convince you that I am no spirit?" he asked, with a
laugh.</p>

<p>"It was I whom the delightful Monsieur Thuran pushed
overboard, but I did not drown&mdash;I will tell you all about it
after a while&mdash;and here I am very much the same wild man you
first knew, Jane Porter." The girl rose slowly to her feet and
came toward him.</p>

<p>"I cannot even yet believe it," she murmured. "It cannot be
that such happiness can be true after all the hideous things that
I have passed through these awful months since the <i>Lady
Alice</i> went down." She came close to him and laid a hand, soft
and trembling, upon his arm.</p>

<p>"It must be that I am dreaming, and that I shall awaken in a
moment to see that awful knife descending toward my
heart&mdash;kiss me, dear, just once before I lose my dream
forever." Tarzan of the Apes needed no second invitation. He took
the girl he loved in his strong arms, and kissed her not once,
but a hundred times, until she lay there panting for breath; yet
when he stopped she put her arms about his neck and drew his lips
down to hers once more.</p>

<p>"Am I alive and a reality, or am I but a dream?" he asked.</p>

<p>"If you are not alive, my man," she answered, "I pray that I
may die thus before I awaken to the terrible realities of my last
waking moments." For a while both were silent&mdash;gazing into
each others' eyes as though each still questioned the reality of
the wonderful happiness that had come to them. The past, with all
its hideous disappointments and horrors, was forgotten&mdash;the
future did not belong to them; but the present&mdash;ah, it was
theirs; none could take it from them. It was the girl who first
broke the sweet silence.</p>

<p>"Where are we going, dear?" she asked. "What are we going to
do?"</p>

<p>"Where would you like best to go?" he asked. "What would you
like best to do?"</p>

<p>"To go where you go, my man; to do whatever seems best to
you," she answered.</p>

<p>"But Clayton?" he asked. For a moment he had forgotten that
there existed upon the earth other than they two. "We have
forgotten your husband."</p>

<p>"I am not married, Tarzan of the Apes," she cried. "Nor am I
longer promised in marriage. The day before those awful creatures
captured me I spoke to Mr. Clayton of my love for you, and he
understood then that I could not keep the wicked promise that I
had made. It was after we had been miraculously saved from an
attacking lion." She paused suddenly and looked up at him, a
questioning light in her eyes. "Tarzan of the Apes," she cried,
"it was you who did that thing? It could have been no other." He
dropped his eyes, for he was ashamed.</p>

<p>"How could you have gone away and left me?" she cried
reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Don't, Jane!" he pleaded. "Please don't! You cannot know how
I have suffered since for the cruelty of that act, or how I
suffered then, first in jealous rage, and then in bitter
resentment against the fate that I had not deserved. I went back
to the apes after that, Jane, intending never again to see a
human being." He told her then of his life since he had returned
to the jungle&mdash;of how he had dropped like a plummet from a
civilized Parisian to a savage Waziri warrior, and from there
back to the brute that he had been raised.</p>

<p>She asked him many questions, and at last fearfully of the
things that Monsieur Thuran had told her&mdash;of the woman in
Paris. He narrated every detail of his civilized life to her,
omitting nothing, for he felt no shame, since his heart always
had been true to her. When he had finished he sat looking at her,
as though waiting for her judgment, and his sentence.</p>

<p>"I knew that he was not speaking the truth," she said. "Oh,
what a horrible creature he is!"</p>

<p>"You are not angry with me, then?" he asked.</p>

<p>And her reply, though apparently most irrelevant, was truly
feminine.</p>

<p>"Is Olga de Coude very beautiful?" she asked.</p>

<p>And Tarzan laughed and kissed her again. "Not one-tenth so
beautiful as you, dear," he said.</p>

<p>She gave a contented little sigh, and let her head rest
against his shoulder. He knew that he was forgiven.</p>

<p>That night Tarzan built a snug little bower high among the
swaying branches of a giant tree, and there the tired girl slept,
while in a crotch beneath her the ape-man curled, ready, even in
sleep, to protect her.</p>

<p>It took them many days to make the long journey to the coast.
Where the way was easy they walked hand in hand beneath the
arching boughs of the mighty forest, as might in a far-gone past
have walked their primeval forebears. When the underbrush was
tangled he took her in his great arms, and bore her lightly
through the trees, and the days were all too short, for they were
very happy. Had it not been for their anxiety to reach and succor
Clayton they would have drawn out the sweet pleasure of that
wonderful journey indefinitely.</p>

<p>On the last day before they reached the coast Tarzan caught
the scent of men ahead of them&mdash;the scent of black men. He
told the girl, and cautioned her to maintain silence. "There are
few friends in the jungle," he remarked dryly.</p>

<p>In half an hour they came stealthily upon a small party of
black warriors filing toward the west. As Tarzan saw them he gave
a cry of delight&mdash;it was a band of his own Waziri. Busuli
was there, and others who had accompanied him to Opar. At sight
of him they danced and cried out in exuberant joy. For weeks they
had been searching for him, they told him.</p>

<p>The blacks exhibited considerable wonderment at the presence
of the white girl with him, and when they found that she was to
be his woman they vied with one another to do her honor. With the
happy Waziri laughing and dancing about them they came to the
rude shelter by the shore.</p>

<p>There was no sign of life, and no response to their calls.
Tarzan clambered quickly to the interior of the little tree hut,
only to emerge a moment later with an empty tin. Throwing it down
to Busuli, he told him to fetch water, and then he beckoned Jane
Porter to come up.</p>

<p>Together they leaned over the emaciated thing that once had
been an English nobleman. Tears came to the girl's eyes as she
saw the poor, sunken cheeks and hollow eyes, and the lines of
suffering upon the once young and handsome face.</p>

<p>"He still lives," said Tarzan. "We will do all that can be
done for him, but I fear that we are too late." When Busuli had
brought the water Tarzan forced a few drops between the cracked
and swollen lips. He wetted the hot forehead and bathed the
pitiful limbs.</p>

<p>Presently Clayton opened his eyes. A faint, shadowy smile
lighted his countenance as he saw the girl leaning over him. At
sight of Tarzan the expression changed to one of wonderment.</p>

<p>"It's all right, old fellow," said the ape-man. "We've found
you in time. Everything will be all right now, and we'll have you
on your feet again before you know it."</p>

<p>The Englishman shook his head weakly.</p>

<p>"It's too late," he whispered. "But it's just as well. I'd
rather die."</p>

<p>"Where is Monsieur Thuran?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"He left me after the fever got bad. He is a devil. When I
begged for the water that I was too weak to get he drank before
me, threw the rest out, and laughed in my face."</p>

<p>At the thought of it the man was suddenly animated by a spark
of vitality. He raised himself upon one elbow.</p>

<p>"Yes," he almost shouted; "I will live. I will live long
enough to find and kill that beast!"</p>

<p>But the brief effort left him weaker than before, and he sank
back again upon the rotting grasses that, with his old ulster,
had been the bed of Jane Porter.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about Thuran," said Tarzan of the Apes, laying a
reassuring hand on Clayton's forehead. "He belongs to me, and I
shall get him in the end, never fear."</p>

<p>For a long time Clayton lay very still. Several times Tarzan
had to put his ear quite close to the sunken chest to catch the
faint beating of the worn-out heart. Toward evening he aroused
again for a brief moment.</p>

<p>"Jane," he whispered. The girl bent her head closer to catch
the faint message. "I have wronged you&mdash;and him," he nodded
weakly toward the ape-man. "I loved you so&mdash;it is a poor
excuse to offer for injuring you; but I could not bear to think
of giving you up. I do not ask your forgiveness. I only wish to
do now the thing I should have done over a year ago."</p>

<p>He fumbled in the pocket of the ulster beneath him for
something that he had discovered there while he lay between the
paroxysms of fever. Presently he found it&mdash;a crumpled bit of
yellow paper. He handed it to the girl, and as she took it his
arm fell limply across his chest, his head dropped back, and with
a little gasp he stiffened and was still.</p>

<p>Then Tarzan of the Apes drew a fold of the ulster across the
upturned face.</p>

<p>For a moment they remained kneeling there, the girl's lips
moving in silent prayer, and as they rose and stood on either
side of the now peaceful form, tears came to the ape-man's eyes,
for through the anguish that his own heart had suffered he had
learned compassion for the suffering of others.</p>

<p>Through her own tears the girl read the message upon the bit
of faded yellow paper, and as she read her eyes went very wide.
Twice she read those startling words before she could fully
comprehend their meaning.</p><br>

<p class="telegram">FINGER PRINTS PROVE YOU GREYSTOKE.
CONGRATULATIONS. D'ARNOT.</p><br>

<p>She handed the paper to Tarzan.</p>

<p>"And he has known it all this time," she said, "and did not
tell you?"</p>

<p>"I knew it first, Jane," replied the man. "I did not know that
he knew it at all. I must have dropped this message that night in
the waiting room. It was there that I received it."</p>

<p>"And afterward you told us that your mother was a she-ape, and
that you had never known your father?" she asked
incredulously.</p>

<p>"The title and the estates meant nothing to me without you,
dear," he replied. "And if I had taken them away from him I
should have been robbing the woman I love&mdash;don't you
understand, Jane?" It was as though he attempted to excuse a
fault.</p>

<p>She extended her arms toward him across the body of the dead
man, and took his hands in hers.</p>

<p>"And I would have thrown away a love like that!" she said.</p>
<hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap26" id="chap26">XXVI. &mdash; THE PASSING OF THE
APE-MAN</a></h2>

<div align="center"> <img src="fr100053-images/TheReturnOfTarzan-26.gif"
alt="Illustration" title="Illustration"> </div><br>

<p class="first">The next morning they set out upon the short
journey to Tarzan's cabin. Four Waziri bore the body of the dead
Englishman. It had been the ape-man's suggestion that Clayton be
buried beside the former Lord Greystoke near the edge of the
jungle against the cabin that the older man had built.</p>

<p>Jane Porter was glad that it was to be so, and in her heart of
hearts she wondered at the marvelous fineness of character of
this wondrous man, who, though raised by brutes and among brutes,
had the true chivalry and tenderness which only associates with
the refinements of the highest civilization.</p>

<p>They had proceeded some three miles of the five that had
separated them from Tarzan's own beach when the Waziri who were
ahead stopped suddenly, pointing in amazement at a strange figure
approaching them along the beach. It was a man with a shiny silk
hat, who walked slowly with bent head, and hands clasped behind
him underneath the tails of his long, black coat.</p>

<p>At sight of him Jane Porter uttered a little cry of surprise
and joy, and ran quickly ahead to meet him. At the sound of her
voice the old man looked up, and when he saw who it was
confronting him he, too, cried out in relief and happiness. As
Professor Archimedes Q. Porter folded his daughter in his arms
tears streamed down his seamed old face, and it was several
minutes before he could control himself sufficiently to
speak.</p>

<p>When a moment later he recognized Tarzan it was with
difficulty that they could convince him that his sorrow had not
unbalanced his mind, for with the other members of the party he
had been so thoroughly convinced that the ape-man was dead it was
a problem to reconcile the conviction with the very lifelike
appearance of Jane's "forest god." The old man was deeply touched
at the news of Clayton's death.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand it," he said. "Monsieur Thuran assured us
that Clayton passed away many days ago."</p>

<p>"Thuran is with you?" asked Tarzan.</p>

<p>"Yes; he but recently found us and led us to your cabin. We
were camped but a short distance north of it. Bless me, but he
will be delighted to see you both."</p>

<p>"And surprised," commented Tarzan.</p>

<p>A short time later the strange party came to the clearing in
which stood the ape-man's cabin. It was filled with people coming
and going, and almost the first whom Tarzan saw was D'Arnot.</p>

<p>"Paul!" he cried. "In the name of sanity what are you doing
here? Or are we all insane?" It was quickly explained, however,
as were many other seemingly strange things. D'Arnot's ship had
been cruising along the coast, on patrol duty, when at the
lieutenant's suggestion they had anchored off the little
landlocked harbor to have another look at the cabin and the
jungle in which many of the officers and men had taken part in
exciting adventures two years before. On landing they had found
Lord Tennington's party, and arrangements were being made to take
them all on board the following morning, and carry them back to
civilization.</p>

<p>Hazel Strong and her mother, Esmeralda, and Mr. Samuel T.
Philander were almost overcome by happiness at Jane Porter's safe
return.</p>

<p>Her escape seemed to them little short of miraculous, and it
was the consensus of opinion that it could have been achieved by
no other man than Tarzan of the Apes. They loaded the
uncomfortable ape-man with eulogies and attentions until he
wished himself back in the amphitheater of the apes.</p>

<p>All were interested in his savage Waziri, and many were the
gifts the black men received from these friends of their king,
but when they learned that he might sail away from them upon the
great canoe that lay at anchor a mile off shore they became very
sad.</p>

<p>As yet the newcomers had seen nothing of Lord Tennington and
Monsieur Thuran. They had gone out for fresh meat early in the
day, and had not yet returned.</p>

<p>"How surprised this man, whose name you say is Rokoff, will be
to see you," said Jane Porter to Tarzan.</p>

<p>"His surprise will be short-lived," replied the ape-man
grimly, and there was that in his tone that made her look up into
his face in alarm. What she read there evidently confirmed her
fears, for she put her hand upon his arm, and pleaded with him to
leave the Russian to the laws of France.</p>

<p>"In the heart of the jungle, dear," she said, "with no other
form of right or justice to appeal to other than your own mighty
muscles, you would be warranted in executing upon this man the
sentence he deserves; but with the strong arm of a civilized
government at your disposal it would be murder to kill him now.
Even your friends would have to submit to your arrest, or if you
resisted it would plunge us all into misery and unhappiness
again. I cannot bear to lose you again, my Tarzan. Promise me
that you will but turn him over to Captain Dufranne, and let the
law take its course&mdash;the beast is not worth risking our
happiness for." He saw the wisdom of her appeal, and promised. A
half hour later Rokoff and Tennington emerged from the jungle.
They were walking side by side. Tennington was the first to note
the presence of strangers in the camp. He saw the black warriors
palavering with the sailors from the cruiser, and then he saw a
lithe, brown giant talking with Lieutenant D'Arnot and Captain
Dufranne.</p>

<p>"Who is that, I wonder," said Tennington to Rokoff, and as the
Russian raised his eyes and met those of the ape-man full upon
him, he staggered and went white.</p>

<p><i>"Sapristi!"</i> he cried, and before Tennington realized
what he intended he had thrown his gun to his shoulder, and
aiming point-blank at Tarzan pulled the trigger. But the
Englishman was close to him&mdash;so close that his hand reached
the leveled barrel a fraction of a second before the hammer fell
upon the cartridge, and the bullet that was intended for Tarzan's
heart whirred harmlessly above his head.</p>

<p>Before the Russian could fire again the ape-man was upon him
and had wrested the firearm from his grasp. Captain Dufranne,
Lieutenant D'Arnot, and a dozen sailors had rushed up at the
sound of the shot, and now Tarzan turned the Russian over to them
without a word. He had explained the matter to the French
commander before Rokoff arrived, and the officer gave immediate
orders to place the Russian in irons and confine him on board the
cruiser.</p>

<p>Just before the guard escorted the prisoner into the small
boat that was to transport him to his temporary prison Tarzan
asked permission to search him, and to his delight found the
stolen papers concealed upon his person.</p>

<p>The shot had brought Jane Porter and the others from the
cabin, and a moment after the excitement had died down she
greeted the surprised Lord Tennington. Tarzan joined them after
he had taken the papers from Rokoff, and, as he approached, Jane
Porter introduced him to Tennington.</p>

<p>"John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, my lord," she said.</p>

<p>The Englishman looked his astonishment in spite of his most
herculean efforts to appear courteous, and it required many
repetitions of the strange story of the ape-man as told by
himself, Jane Porter, and Lieutenant D'Arnot to convince Lord
Tennington that they were not all quite mad.</p>

<p>At sunset they buried William Cecil Clayton beside the jungle
graves of his uncle and his aunt, the former Lord and Lady
Greystoke. And it was at Tarzan's request that three volleys were
fired over the last resting place of "a brave man, who met his
death bravely." Professor Porter, who in his younger days had
been ordained a minister, conducted the simple services for the
dead. About the grave, with bowed heads, stood as strange a
company of mourners as the sun ever looked down upon. There were
French officers and sailors, two English lords, Americans, and a
score of savage African braves.</p>

<p>Following the funeral Tarzan asked Captain Dufranne to delay
the sailing of the cruiser a couple of days while he went inland
a few miles to fetch his "belongings," and the officer gladly
granted the favor.</p>

<p>Late the next afternoon Tarzan and his Waziri returned with
the first load of "belongings," and when the party saw the
ancient ingots of virgin gold they swarmed upon the ape-man with
a thousand questions; but he was smilingly obdurate to their
appeals&mdash;he declined to give them the slightest clew as to
the source of his immense treasure. "There are a thousand that I
left behind," he explained, "for every one that I brought away,
and when these are spent I may wish to return for more."</p>

<p>The next day he returned to camp with the balance of his
ingots, and when they were stored on board the cruiser Captain
Dufranne said he felt like the commander of an old-time Spanish
galleon returning from the treasure cities of the Aztecs. "I
don't know what minute my crew will cut my throat, and take over
the ship," he added.</p>

<p>The next morning, as they were preparing to embark upon the
cruiser, Tarzan ventured a suggestion to Jane Porter.</p>

<p>"Wild beasts are supposed to be devoid of sentiment," he said,
"but nevertheless I should like to be married in the cabin where
I was born, beside the graves of my mother and my father, and
surrounded by the savage jungle that always has been my
home."</p>

<p>"Would it be quite regular, dear?" she asked. "For if it would
I know of no other place in which I should rather be married to
my forest god than beneath the shade of his primeval forest." And
when they spoke of it to the others they were assured that it
would be quite regular, and a most splendid termination of a
remarkable romance. So the entire party assembled within the
little cabin and about the door to witness the second ceremony
that Professor Porter was to solemnize within three days.</p>

<p>D'Arnot was to be best man, and Hazel Strong bridesmaid, until
Tennington upset all the arrangements by another of his marvelous
