<h2><a name="ch0" id="ch0"></a>Introductory Note</h2>

<p>Mr Stacy Aumonier's pre-eminence in the difficult art of writing
short stories is established, So well, indeed, that his other
accomplishments, which are by no means few, tend to become
forgotten. We like to pigeonhole our authors neatly, and when once
a man has been labelled "short-story writer" it is more than a
little annoying that he should present incontestable proof of being
many other things as well. And here is Mr Stacy Aumonier, with
inconsiderate versatility, demanding recognition both as a novelist
and an essayist, and demanding it in such a way that we dare not
refuse. In addition to that, he began his career as a decorative
designer and landscape artist, has exhibited at the Royal Academy,
has been a Society entertainer, and has performed at various
theatres, in sketches of his own composition.</p>

<p>All the various qualities thus called forth have helped to make
his literary work what it is. A keen appreciation of design and an
eye for dramatic moments give him the equipment of a novelist. A
lively sense of humour and a clear judgment combine to make him a
shrewd and lively commentator on life and things in general. "It
takes years, much training, discipline, and reflection to learn how
to become a human being," he says, and it is this realization of
the significance of all the details that make up life which gives
his amusing reflections their value. Mr Aumonier was born in
1887.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>The Thin Black Line</h2>

<p>Do you know those days when every one seems to like you? You
walk along the street and strangers smile at you kindly; pretty
women exude an aura of accessibility; policemen touch their hats;
errand-boys ask you for cigarette-pictures, which you happen to
have; a jolly old gentleman asks you the way somewhere, and you
happen to know. You meet just the right people: friends who ask you
to dinner, acquaintances who tell you a really good story,
tradesmen who give you the impression that your interests are their
interests, a barber who takes a kind of feline delight in cutting
your hair, children who are confiding and gay.</p>

<p>And then one day you experience just the reverse. Every one
appears to hate the sight of you. They scowl at you and pass by.
Women appear distant. You meet all the wrong people: rude boys and
tradespeople; friends who remind you that you have not yet returned
that loan; bores with tedious stories you've heard before;
policemen who regard you suspiciously; gruff old ladies who ask you
the way somewhere, and show annoyance at your not knowing; bus
conductors who convince you that you have merely boarded a bus in
order to make yourself a public nuisance. You meet no one you know,
and no one who seems to want to know you.</p>

<p>I experienced such a day yesterday. I went for my usual walk
along the Finchley Road. I had not gone two hundred yards before I
realized that it was going to be a bad day. Everybody I passed had
that unmistakable look of hostility. I tried to regard them
genially, but there was no response. A man to whom I had recently
been introduced cut me. A tobacconist was peculiarly surly. I had
to call at two shops, and in neither was there so much as a "sir"
or "Thank you." I boarded a bus, and there the sense of animosity
was even more pronounced. Every one glanced at me as though they
resented my presence. The conductor almost pushed me off at
Finchley Road Station, where I had to dismount as I was going to
the bank. I had about a five minutes' walk from there. It was the
busy hour when the streets were crowded with pretty women shopping.
Now, come! there is surely no harm in looking at a pretty woman as
you pass by. There was no need for that almost outraged sense of
propriety when I glanced at them. I felt desolate and depressed. No
one asked me the way anywhere, or demanded cigarette-pictures. It
was unfair. It was cruel.</p>

<p>I went into the bank, and there my despondence reached a climax.
The cashier looked up at me suspiciously. "Then he took my cheque
away with him, and I knew he was doing some furtive comparisons in
the corner with a ledger. After a time he returned and reluctantly
handed me the few meagre Treasury notes I had applied for. I
noticed that, contrary to usual practice, they were old ones. As I
went out of the bank I thought:</p>

<p>"This is a dark day for you, my lad."</p>

<p>I wandered back disconsolately down the Finchley Road, still
encountering glances of stern disapproval and dislike. I looked
into unfriendly shops. Once I glanced at a chemist's. I'm not sure
that poison was not at the back of my mind. Behind a lot of bottles
was a mirror. I looked at myself. And then suddenly the stark
horror was upon me. <i>I hadn't got a tie on!</i> I looked awful. I
gasped, panted, blushed, clutched at my overcoat. Like lightning I
turned up the collar and buttoned it tightly round my neck, and
regarded the result. Thank God! I breathed again. Glancing guiltily
round I resumed my journey. Then lo! I experienced the striking
metamorphosis of the human unit. Every one became immediately
friendly once more. Two ladies asked me the way to get to the Zoo.
The darlings! Partial acquaintances nodded and smiled&mdash;a
friend of mine who goes about cleaning the street-lamps, the man
and his wife who run the flower-stall. The pretty women shoppers no
longer turned away in disgust. Complete strangers gave me friendly
glances. Near my turning I ran into Jimmy. Jimmy is an actor. He
was on his way to the Haymarket to get his hair cut. Wonderful! No
one but an actor would go all the way from the Finchley Road to the
Haymarket to get his hair cut. He was in great spirits, enormously
old-boyish, and told me several of the latest. And as I glanced at
him I thought:</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, my friend. Would you be so friendly if you knew the
fell secret which my coat collar conceals?"</p>

<p>He waved a boisterous farewell, and left me to reflect upon the
grim irony of life. For I came to the conclusion that that which
divides savagery from civilization is not a vast bulwark of culture
and spiritual enlightenment, but a thin black line of <i>crépe</i>
or silk.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>A Bullfight</h2>

<p><i>MALAGA</i>.</p>

<p>Seated in the amphitheatre of the bull-ring yesterday and
awaiting the show to begin, I had a curious feeling that I was
there to watch an organized street accident.</p>

<p>Now there is a curious feature about street accidents in that we
all have a sneaking liking for them; at least, we like them if they
don't mean some one being hurt and blood flowing. We all&mdash;or
nearly all&mdash;enjoy what the fifth-form boy calls "a good old
muck up." We enjoy a football scrimmage, smashing things, and
throwing stones at bottles.</p>

<p>But when I got to my seat the first thing that struck me was the
lightness of the sand in the arena. I thought of Ibanez's <i>Blood
and Sand</i>. I became uncomfortably aware that one would miss
nothing. It seemed extraordinary that in a few minutes' time we
should see a real street accident, in which a number of
animals&mdash;and quite possibly men&mdash;would be killed against
that background of light sand.</p>

<p>I couldn't help thinking that, knowing there was going to be
this accident, wouldn't it be possible to avoid it?</p>

<p>The King and Queen of Spain were present, and some fifteen
thousand people, and the lowest price of a seat was nine pesetas.
As a pageant it was magnificent.</p>

<p>The proceedings, conducted by a bugle from the president's box,
had that heraldic quality which one associates with the Middle
Ages, and one felt that nothing had altered one iota since. The
sport, or whatever it was, was redolent of the soil, and steeped in
tradition, When two knights in black rode in, and, standing before
the president's box, announced that the bulls had arrived, and
begged for the keys to open the gate to the ring, and when the keys
were solemnly flung down, and the band played, one forgot that one
had come to see a street accident.</p>

<p>The procession, headed by the three toreadors, gorgeously
apparelled, helped to sustain the Homeric gesture. It was not till
three quixotic gentlemen, on the sorriest steeds you ever saw, took
up their positions that one began to have one's suspicions, Even
when the bull itself appeared it seemed to be nothing but a pretty
game. There were some twenty people in the ring, and the bull made
tentative little plunges at scarlet cloaks, but never followed it
up, because some one else immediately distracted its attention.</p>

<p>This went on for about five minutes, and the bull, which had at
first seemed bewildered, began to regard it as all rather silly.
But when one of the quixotic gentlemen on the sorry nags, carrying
a pole with a short steel spike (his legs encased in steel),
emerged a few yards from the barrier and began to be provocative,
then I knew that the 'muck up' was coming.</p>

<p>And so it proved. The bull, bored with all this messing about,
decided that it was time to get to work. He took the measure of
this miserable equipage and charged. The picador worked his horse
into a broadside position, and made but a poor attempt to defend
it. It was as though a motor-bus going full tilt had run into an
old four-wheeler. There was a crash and sudden chaos of blood,
limbs, horns, hoofs, and trappings.</p>

<p>Don Quixote was unseated and picked up by his friends, while
others distracted the bull's attentions. The bull shook himself
free from the confusion, looked around, and snorted. A change came
over him. He suddenly seemed to be saying: "Of course, if it's
street accidents you want, I'm all for it." He was prepared to
charge anything. He rushed around looking for a nice plate-glass
window or a china-shop. Instead of that he met a skinny man,
holding a dart in either hand above his head. This seemed easy
stuff. He bore down on him, but the man neatly inserted the darts,
one on either flank, and leapt aside. This was annoying, and he
bellowed with anger, and tried to shake the darts out.</p>

<p>Three times this happened till he had six of the horrid things
flapping on his back. And still the harassing of the red cloaks
went on. Just to show, however, that he was not yet done he killed
another horse. But he was obviously tiring.</p>

<p>It was then that the toreador (exactly as you might see him on
the stage at Daly's) came forward, and, bowing to the King, he
placed his hand on his heart and made a kind of "I, about to die,
salute thee" address. And with his sword and red cloak he went into
the middle of the ring, and after two attempts he did kill the
bull.</p>

<p>I now feel I must recount the remarks I overheard from an old
man near by. They had a familiar ring, and amounted to this: What's
wrong with bullfighting? When <i>he</i> was a young man
bullfighting was the <i>real</i> thing. They had fierce and cunning
old bulls up to the age of ten; now there wasn't a toreador in
Spain with the pluck to face a bull more than six years old. He
remembered So-and-so who used to come into the ring and sit on a
chair. He did all fighting from it, killed the bull seated, and got
paid a few crowns. These modern toreadors thought about nothing but
big purses, and running as little risk as possible. Bah! This was
one of the pleasantest notes of the afternoon. I might have been at
the Oval.</p>

<p>The old man's arguments were, however, somewhat confuted during
the next encounter, for the bull got the toreador. How badly he was
hurt I could not tell, but he was carried out of the ring. This
seemed to unnerve the rest, for according to the experts the
fighting was poor and the bulls tame. There was not one clean kill.
The business of the toreador is to work the bull into such a
position that he can drive his sword right through a space about
the size of a saucer between the shoulders to the heart. This was
never done at all, neither did one of the picadors ever succeed in
defending his horse against the bull.</p>

<p>But a diversion was caused by bull number four. He was a fine
big black chap, who had apparently certain gentlemanly instincts.
He refused to go for the horses. 'This according to bullfighting
code Is a punishable offence. A bugle rang out from the president's
box. One of the carabineros rushed out and hurled darts charged
with bombs into the bull. They exploded with terrific violence, and
immediately the whole arena reeked of grilled steak and dynamite.
The bull apparently went mad. He leapt into the air like a cat,
rushed across the arena and jumped the barricade. He then
disappeared down a narrow passage, where he got jammed. While the
audience were yelling, some for him to be sent back into the ring,
for the kill, others for him to be killed where he was, one had an
opportunity of deciphering a banner suspended across a gallery
facing the Royal Box. It said: "The brotherhood of Christ who
expired on the Cross welcome their Majesties the King and
Queen..."</p>

<p>During the afternoon I saw eight horses and six bulls killed,
and one toreador wounded. 'The spectators worked themselves up to a
tremendous state of enthusiasm, and never stopped eating
sandwiches, honeyed cakes, and <i>calentita</i>.</p>

<p>To me as a casual outsider, and regarding the sport simply as a
spectacle, it seemed monotonous after the first few bulls. One got
tired of the incessant waving of red cloaks and the inevitable
goring of the horses. If I lived here I'm certain I should be
writing to the papers on "How to brighten Bullfighting." I should
like more noise and less blood.</p>

<p>It seemed wicked to waste the magnificent driving power of the
bull on bits of rag. A lot of harmless amusement might have been
got out of plate-glass windows and piles of crockery. As we came
out they were selling sandwiches made from the flesh of the first
bull, slightly cooked. Two small boys near me were devouring them
greedily. I noticed on the bread the imprints of bloody
fingermarks.</p>

<p>Altogether it was not at all the kind of afternoon my aunt from
Tunbridge Wells would have enjoyed.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>The Social Sense</h2>

<p>I have been to prison twice within the last six months. Let me
hasten to add that they were fugitive visits of a voluntary nature.
But my impression is, from what I saw and heard, that prisons are
filled less by people who are naturally vicious than by people who
haven't acquired the social sense. The social sense is indeed not
easy to acquire. If you leave three or four young children alone in
a room&mdash;however refined their ancestry&mdash;in half an hour's
time they will be biting each other. It takes years, much training,
discipline, and reflection to learn how to become a human being.
Now the average man who throws a cigarette-end down in the street
thinks no more about it. But by that gesture he has subscribed
himself as a member of the body politic, because some one else has
to pick it up after him, take it away, and get rid of it.
Therefore, as a good citizen, it is up to him to perform some other
action that shall compensate for the removal of the cigarette-end.
Weare all of us waited on hand and foot by thousands of other
people. Even while we sleep other people in all parts of the world
are making furniture, clothes, varnish, boot-polish, cricket bats,
poems, beer, dyes, matches, and other commodities that we shall
eventually have the benefit of and enjoy. You cannot escape from
the services that are being rendered you, nor from the services
rendered you in the past, nor those that will be rendered you by
the unborn. To acquire the social sense is to find your place in
this great scheme of universal service.</p>

<p>The prison problem is desperately difficult. We have not yet
reached that stage of civilization when prisons can be dispensed
with, But if the prisoner shows anti-social tendencies before
conviction, prison life tends to destroy any social sense he may
have had. It is almost impossible for him to fit into the social
scheme again, At Wandsworth Prison alone there are on an average
four thousand prisoners discharged every year, of whom about
two-thirds are destitute. That is to say, that from this one prison
alone there are being poured into the community three thousand
desperate men annually, men with the stigma of prison life upon
them, men who even if willing find it almost impossible to get
work. What is there for them to do except to continue to plunder
the community until caught again?</p>

<p>But that is not the only dangerous side of the situation. Prison
life is not by any means beer and skittles, but it has an insidious
side. A prisoner has no responsibilities. He has a clean, centrally
heated cell. He has chapel, lectures, and lessons. His
food&mdash;which is adequate&mdash;is brought to him in his cell
cooked. He has books and exercise, and he is given work that is
carefully considered with regard to his medical record. (I heard of
one man in Wandsworth who was a bootmaker by trade, but was not
passed by the M.O. as fit for this work!) All of this is very
demoralizing to a man without the social sense. At first he hates
it, but it gradually grips him. Outside, he doesn't know how to fit
in. He is afraid of people. He drops his cigarette-ends all over
the place and thinks it's all right for others to pick them up.
Social life bewilders him. Here is an easy solution. The prison
becomes a community in itself, a life within a life. To keep a man
like that for several years and then discharge him into the
community without help, check, or foresight is like keeping a
rabbit in a hutch for years, feeding it on cabbage-stalks, and then
releasing it in a field of foxes. He hasn't got a chance.</p>

<p>One cannot, of course, expect the Government and, indirectly,
the ratepayers to subsidize and endow discharged prisoners. But in
the interests of the community itself it would be better if the
matter were more sympathetically considered. There is nothing
between the discharged prisoner and the field of foxes&mdash;or
shall we say his own frailties and temptations '&mdash;except a
very hard-working, inadequately supported body of men and women
called "The Prisoners' Aid Society." This society is rendering
great service to every one, and doing it in, perhaps, the only
sensible way&mdash;that is to say, every prisoner who appeals to
them is considered as an individual case.</p>

<p>The economics of the situation present endless difficulties, but
there is one side to it which we could all contribute to modify.
"The stigma of prison life" is a well-worn phrase, but none the
less true for that. It is not so much the punishment at the time
which breaks men and women as the effect it has on them afterwards.
Now we are none of us in a position to throw the first stone, and
what I would suggest is&mdash;not that these people who have been
found out should not go to prison, but that every one should go to
prison. You may gamble on the fact that every one has been
sufficiently naughty&mdash;either in deed or thought&mdash;to
merit, say, three weeks' imprisonment every year. And think of the
immense amount of good it would do everybody.</p>

<p>For three weeks every year you would be cut off from such things
as drinks, smokes, worries, and responsibilities. You would get up
early, take exercise, rest, work, read, and go to bed early. And at
night you would be left alone to look between the eyes of your
soul. You would not be able to escape behind the cloak of
dissipations or false social values. You would have to think
yourself out. The stigma of prison life would no longer be a
reproach. In after life the burglar and the bishop would meet on
equal spiritual grounds. The burglar would not be conscious of that
unscalable wall of inspissated unctuousness, for he would be able
to say: "Ah, my lord, do you remember those old days when we were
up at Parkhurst together?"</p>

<p>And the mind of the bishop would show a quicker understanding of
that religion he professes to teach, a religion whose tenets are
prescribed to enlarge the interpretation of the social sense in its
most magnanimous form.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>On Pottering About</h2>

<p>The first essential to pottering about is that one must be
dressed for the part. By dressed I mean, of course, undressed or
only partially dressed. Probably the best pottering about is done
in a dressing-gown, slippers, and an unshaven condition.</p>

<p>What is more delightful to the accomplished potterer than to go,
thus apparelled, into a sunny room after an early morning cup of
tea, light a cigarette, and then to poke about, pull out a book and
put it back, stare at a bowl of flowers, open the drawer of a
cabinet, shut it again, while all the time his mind is registering
in short wave-lengths: "By Jove! I must do that&mdash;to-morrow. I
should like to paint that bowl of flowers&mdash;how jolly it looks
against the dark cabinet. I really must mend that
blind-roller&mdash;later on. What a great man is Bernard Shaw. I
must write a play myself&mdash;soon." These reflections and
determinations naturally do not follow each other rapidly. They are
dragged and slurred over a comfortable period of time, further
mellowed by a slow, sensuous enjoyment of languid movement, of
being conscious of diligently pottering about.</p>

<p>For the feature of pottering about is that one must feel like
doing things, but never actually do them, unless it is to pick one
snail off the wall and glower disapprovingly at the other snails,
or else to snip off one dead rose and say to oneself: "After
breakfast I must really prune these bushes." It is justifiable to
pick up one cigarette-end, but not to clean up the hearth. One may
reread a letter that came last night, but one mustn't answer it.
All of which seems strange, because at no time is one's mind so
actively alive as during the period of pottering about. It is an
ideal state. Indeed, so rare and precious are these abstract
moments that we are not going to waste them on concrete
actions.</p>

<p>When we are actively engaged in work that has to be done we
dream longingly of the hours we shall spend pottering about. When
we are pottering about we wallow in the reflection of heroic
achievement. We are above the mundane claims of mere execution. Our
poise is entirely spiritual.</p>

<p>When a man retires from business he spends the rest of his life
pottering about; that is to say, he spends it in a greater state of
spiritual activity than he had ever indulged in before. Whereas for
forty years perhaps he had been idling away his time as an actuary
in an assurance Company or as a civil engineer, he suddenly finds
himself collecting cigar-bands or growing gentians. He has always
wanted to indulge his spiritual passion for cigar-bands or become
absorbed in the generic mysteries of the elusive gentian, but the
company or the machine has stood in his way. Suddenly he finds
himself free. He expands. His secret yearnings come to fruition, he
becomes terribly active, he&mdash;potters about.</p>

<p>No longer trammelled by routine, he casually makes discoveries.
Watt, pottering about with a kettle, discovered the steam-engine.
Newton, pottering about with an apple, discovered the law of
gravitation. Columbus, pottering about with the ocean, discovered
America.</p>

<p>And this fact you cannot deny to our good potterer&mdash;many of
the best things have been done casually; all of the vile things
have been done deliberately. Wars are the result of routine and its
calculated effects; the potterer about has no use for them. They
make him hold up his hands in horror. They may restrict the
extension of his collection of cigar-bands; they will certainly
interfere with his development of gentians.</p>

<p>The potterer about is a pioneer. His business is concerned with
spiritual experiment. He combines the enthusiasm of the amateur
with the acquired experience of the professional. I once heard Sir
Ernest Shackleton say that the main incentive to his Polar
expeditions was not scientific research, but the kind of schoolboy
fun of doing it, of planting the British flag where others had not
penetrated. That is to say, he liked reading Shelley and pottering
about in the snow, and come what must&mdash;he had no ulterior
motives, no instinct of sordid gain or worldly glory. What the
British Empire owes to the instinct of her sons for pottering about
is incalculable, I am surprised it has never been written up.</p>

<p>This country has never produced a Napoleon dreaming of British
world dominion. 'The Empire has just happened along, almost under
protest. Some Englishman has been pottering about (figuratively in
his dressing-gown) in an African jungle or an Indian desert, when
some one has come up and said: "Excuse me, do you mind holding my
baby a minute?" Or he has been pottering about the Malay
Archipelago (still in his dressing-gown) when a party of people
have come up and said: "I say, do you know the Chinese keep slaves
in the salt-mines here? They treat them horribly. Can't you do
something about it?"</p>

<p>And because in his pottering-about way he has a kind of
conscience, he grumblingly agrees. He doesn't want to do any of
these things. He just wants to go on pottering about, and then go
back to bed. But because he is at heart a kind-hearted chap and is
always being nagged by this spectre of conscience, he gradually
finds himself encumbered with babies, and salt-mines, and other
impedimenta. Soon he becomes weighted down, chained and fettered to
the gyves of a social life that bores him. The dressing-gown is
reluctantly discarded. And at night, thoroughly tired out, he
throws himself on his bed and dreams. He dreams of Heaven, a place
where one may uninterruptedly go on for ever, and ever, and
ever&mdash;pottering about.</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>On Doing what You're Told</h2>

<p>There is a phrase often repeated in the advertising spaces of
the daily Press familiar to us all. It runs: "Eat more bananas!" I
think it must have occurred to most of us at times to wonder
whether this peremptory injunction does actually influence people
to eat more bananas, It stands to reason that hard-headed business
men would not spend good money repeating it unless indeed it did
have the desired effect. And experience teaches us that repetition
is an enormously powerful force.</p>

<p>It is no good saying to me once (in print), "Eat more bananas!"
I should simply think, "How silly!" But if every time I pick up a
newspaper I am enjoined to eat more of this yellow fruit (of which
I am not particularly fond), and if people I meet keep on
whispering in my ear, "Eat more bananas!" and reverend grey-haired
gentlemen take me on one side and say, "What you want to do, my
boy, is to eat more bananas," I know that in the fullness of time I
should develop an inclination to devour bananas for breakfast,
lunch, tea, and dinner.</p>

<p>There are, I know, certain strong-minded people who would stand
out against this injunction. The mere fact of being told to eat
bananas would drive them to an orgy of pickled walnuts. But they
are in a minority; with the majority of us the inclination is
always to do as we are told, from whatever source the order comes.
In the same way we are advised to "Eat mustard and get strong!"
"Get the Tube habit!" etc.</p>

<p>Among Eastern and other peoples the religious devotee is
instructed not merely to repeat a prayer once, but so many times.
This is quite sound. By this means the vagrant sinner learns to
acquire godliness in the same way that the Pagan from Putney tends
to acquire strength from the excitation of a much-advertised
mustard. It reminds one of the old lady who said: "I must try
So-and-so's soap. All the advertisements speak so well of it."</p>

<p>This very powerful instinct arises presumably from the fact that
when we are children we are taught to do what we are told,
unquestioningly. And this instruction carries with it a strange
sense of comfort. We are born amidst incomprehensible surroundings.
We have no judgment as to what is right and what is wrong, what is
good and what is evil, what will do us harm and what will benefit
us. But at that age we find ourselves surrounded by maternal and
paternal experts in these matters. It sometimes occurs to us to
challenge these teachings out of a sense of perversity and
experiment, but never to challenge the actual justice of them.</p>

<p>But, alas! there comes an oblique instant when we no longer do
what we are told, for there is no one there to tell us what to do.
We find ourselves suddenly faced with the problem of forming a
judgment, or making a quick decision&mdash;alone. It is a solitary
and, at first, terrifying experience, and one which we all
instinctively try to avoid. We come into the world alone. We go out
alone, and every big moment which affects our character and our
destiny is a moment that has to be faced alone. And because in all
the big things we remain children to the very end, we are always
clamouring to be told what we should do. There are odd lazy corners
of our minds, dark passions and desires that cannot be explained,
deep-rooted prejudices and disaffections. And in the problems they
present we are still eager to snuggle beneath the protection of the
expert in these matters. And so we go to the priest, the lawyer,
the philosopher, and the doctor and we say: "Tell me what is right.
And I'll do what I'm told."</p>

<p>And he comes with the force of a thousand repetitions, and he
says: "Do this or do that," and we comply unquestioningly.</p>

<p>I have a good friend, who before the War held a responsible
position in a big engineering works. During the War he was put into
the R.E.'s (the right thing did get done sometimes). I met him one
day when he was on leave. He had just come back from Gallipoli and
the Italian front, looking very fit and well, On asking him how he
was getting on, he replied: "Oh, fine! It's grand, no
responsibility. You simply have to do what you're told!" He was
looking fifteen years younger than when I had last seen him.</p>

<p>Conscious then of this power of suggestion as supported by
endless repetitions, it behoves us to watch carefully what we say.
For every little thing we say, however serious or frivolous, is a
contribution to the herd instinct. Public conscience is less
susceptible to the arguments of logic and reason than it is to the
pressure of repetition. You have only to make a statement often
enough and vehemently enough for it to become a fact.</p>

<p>If the French keep on saying that they hate the Germans, and the
Germans keep on saying that they hate the French, well, then, they
do. But it would be just as easy to make them love each other as it
would be to make them both eat bananas. They could both be taught
to do what they're told.</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>The Thrill of Being Ill</h2>

<p>It's no good getting a cold in the head, or any kind of absurd
bilious attack, This doesn't help you at all. Your friends regard
you as a bore. The people who have an affection for you display
only an impatient interest.</p>

<p>You must do the thing properly. There must be in the first place
a sudden shifting of all physical and mental values. You must glide
away into a curious twilight where the division of time seems a
little uncertain. And then you notice an unfamiliar figure, all in
white, gliding hither and thither, performing rites that contribute
to your general comfort. And a man in a grey suit, with an air of
forced geniality, takes arbitrary possession of your body. And he
says "Ha!" and "H'm!" in a discreetly non-committal way. And he
vanishes and comes again, and vanishes and comes, and other people
come and vanish, and your vanity forbids you asking too many
questions, as though you think you are so important!</p>

<p>And then you become subtly aware of a change of attitude in the
manner of certain people. They are anxious. At this realization the
Ego-maniac in you rises and swells. You have come into your
kingdom, You have become dramatically a centre of interest. No
miserable cold in the head for you, but something with a name that
has the power to frighten and disturb. Its direct bearing on you is
purely objective. It seems of no great consequence, except as it
affects these social relationships. Indolently you think of various
friends who will say, "Poor old chap! He's got it!" and you
visualize them discussing the matter with others.</p>

<p>There is a latent thrill about all this. You have bought the
luxury at the price of many pains and penalties, and you rightly
demand your pound of flesh. You become somnolently autocratic. You
accept the attention and service of those who hover around you as
the toll due to a person of special privilege. If you were
commanding a ship at sea, or sitting in judgment on your
fellow-man, you could not feel more secretly elated. 'The fact that
your physical powers are dissipated, that even the actions of your
own body are controlled by others, seems to add to rather than
diminish this sense of personal exultation. Of course it's all
wrong. But illness itself is all wrong. It is attributable in nine
cases out of ten to some unnatural pressure of which this very
exultation is one. In the ordinary course of social life we set up
and demand a certain standard of exultation. If we fall below it we
are unhappy. That is why we smoke thirty cigarettes a day
and&mdash;do all the other things we do. We are constantly keying
ourselves up to our own arbitrary standard of exultation. And then
one day comes a crash, and the first thing the Medicine Men say,
after having picked up the pieces, is: "Ah! too much
exultation!"</p>

<p>And then we are sent away to where such a thing is apparently
inaccessible. Ninety-nine per cent. of the exultation is cut off.
We slowly emerge. And as we emerge we realize how wise and yet how
unseeing the Medicine Men are. For though their precepts are good,
they have overlooked the fact that if you knock 99 per cent off a
thing the remaining unit is still divisible by a hundred. The
thrill shifts its ground, but it is still there.</p>

<p>We discover in the first place that whereas in the old days our
time was divided between night and day&mdash;that is to say, a time
when it was light and a time when it was dark&mdash;we now enjoy a
cycle of twenty-four complete hours. We make friends with hours
that are strangers to us. I met such a one last week. It was
between two and three in the morning, and an owl went slowly by,
hooting around the eaves of the house. I have an idea he must have
been a young owl&mdash;one, perhaps, just starting up in business
for himself&mdash;for although his cry was plaintive and very
beautiful, it had not that deep velvety note of the older owl,
surely the most beautiful sound in Nature.</p>

<p>Exultation! You cannot escape it, whatever the scale of your
activities. In the early morning you hear a rustling in the
corridor outside. You know that in twenty minutes' time some one
will be bringing you tea. Tea! You await the thrill of the early
morning tea with the same avidity that in former days you have
awaited the rising of the curtain on a first night. After the tea
the day proceeds on a carefully modulated progression of thrills.
The post comes, That is in itself as exciting an experience as man
could desire. One's whole destiny may be affected by a post. One
reads the letters through very attentively twice, and even
circulars about sales of jam and women's <i>coiffeur</i> arrest
one's attention. Whilst the pathetic offer from the gentleman who
is anxious to lend you £20,000 on note of hand, without security,
sends one off into vivid dreams of Southern seas or Persian
palaces.</p>

<p>In due course follow the newspapers. In the bad old days one
glanced at the cricket and skimmed the general news. One now reads
the newspaper from cover to cover. Not an over is missed in county
cricket. Even letters to the editor, weather forecasts, and
political speeches have an arresting significance. And so as the
day proceeds one is reminded of the poem about the little fleas and
the lesser fleas. The unit functions within its restricted area
with complete success. The proportion remains undisturbed. I am
writing this seated among pine-trees in Berkshire. I cannot see
very far because the view is cut off by the pines. A Russian lady
was here the other day. She said the view made her feel homesick.
"But think," she added, "in Russia we have this"&mdash;and she
waved her arms towards the pines&mdash;"the same thing, stretching
away for thousands of miles."</p>

<p>Well, dear lady, we none of us can see more than we can see. So
far as my happiness is concerned there are just as many pine-trees
in Berkshire as there are in Russia. It is quite likely that the
lesser fleas get just as big a thrill biting the little fleas as
the little fleas do biting the big fleas. It is all a question of
scale.</p>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>These Charming Women!</h2>

<p>When woman escaped&mdash;not so very long ago&mdash;from the
position of being purely man's chattel, her instinct of
self-preservation prompted her to the realization of a salient
fact. She saw that there was one obstacle that must be mastered if
she were to retain her position of apparent equality. And that
obstacle was&mdash;man's astounding physical beauty.</p>

<p>In the flesh she knew she could not compare with him, and so she
set about her attack in other and subtler ways. It was essential
for her to give man the impression, at all costs, that she was even
more beautiful than he. And the generations have produced an
amazing state of affairs. In the first place they have produced an
industry, or rather a colossal combination of industries, whose
sole activities are devoted to trying to make out that women are
more beautiful than men. Industries producing frocks, hats, gloves,
shoes, scents, cosmetics, powders, and jewels; and millions and
millions of people slaving away night and day in order to keep up
the lie.</p>

<p>Frocks that deceive and allure and entice, hats that bewilder,
shoes that minimize, paint that heightens, jewels that sparkle,
perfume that intoxicates&mdash;all these things are brought into
the preposterous contest. Even in his ugly clothes a man cannot
conceal his beauty. A woman requires the assistance of the whole
earth to make her presentable. There would be no harm in the
childish vanity this position has evoked, except for the fact that
she is gradually coming to think that she is not only as beautiful
as man, but that she is as <i>important</i>! Was any suggestion so
absurd?</p>

<p>She has come to regard not only sex equality as a fact, but even
to argue about a thing she calls 'sex antagonism.' Now, if we are
to suggest that sex antagonism may be regarded as a serious issue,
let it be stated at once that if the men took it into their heads
they could kill all the women in the world in about twelve hours
with very few casualties. Mind you, I'm not advocating this. I
should disapprove of it. I like women. I merely state it as
evidence that any theory of sex antagonism is worthless. It is like
discussing antagonism between a lamb and a tiger.</p>

<p>The subject could only have arisen through her desperate
realization that all these frocks and frills have failed. In spite
of centuries of concentration on the subject she knows that man
still remains more beautiful than she. Stripped of her adornments,
woman makes pretty poor showing. And one must judge of this not by
the church parade or the beauty chorus, but by the sculpture
gallery.</p>

<p>The sculpture gallery gives the whole show away. Look at the
<i>Apollo Sauroctonus</i>, the <i>Eros of Centocelle</i>, the
<i>Zeus</i> from Dodona, the <i>Discobolus</i>, or some of the
Medicis of Michelangelo; and compare any of these with the <i>Venus
de Milo</i>, or the <i>Cnidian Aphrodite</i>. Both the <i>Venus</i>
and the <i>Aphrodite</i> have beauty, but it is of a lower order.
It is a passive, receptive, shrinking form of beauty. The <i>Venus
de Milo</i> looks naked and thoroughly ashamed; and well she might
be. And then note the extraordinary grace and poise of Apollo and
Zeus; creatures made to rule, and conquer, and create.</p>

<p>And so at the present day if you want to see real physical
beauty you don't go to a ladies' swimming-bath; you go to the
running-track or the towpath at our public schools and
universities.</p>

<p>It is no reflection upon women that they are less beautiful than
men. They cannot help it. But they must never expect to be co-equal
with them. For by the laws of God man is the most perfect thing
ever made, and woman is only the complement, the accessory after
the fact of man's creation.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>The Advantages of Being
Murdered</h2>

<p>As one has to die in any case, there are very obvious advantages
in being murdered&mdash;both to the individual and to the race. It
cleans up the type. All animals are murdered. It is only man who
has inaugurated the effete habit of dying in bed. The other animals
have to be on top of their form the whole time. A damaged limb or
impaired strength, and some more healthy creature springs on you
and gobbles you up. And that's that. The consequence is that you
are a hundred per cent. yourself the whole time, and
then&mdash;finish! You are spared long years of lingering pain,
melancholy, and regret.</p>

<p>(When I say "'all animals," I must, of course, make the one
reservation of the domestic cat, But the domestic cat is a creature
apart from all other creatures. It has the social equation taped to
the last hair. No one pretends to understand the cat. After twelve
or fourteen years of an indolent and utterly depraved life, it
suddenly rushes round in a circle and dies. A dog is murdered
kindly. It develops something which a vet. says is incurable, and
some one releases it with a shot-gun or chloroform. But who knows
anything about a cat's illnesses? It may behave in some astounding
manner, and you think it is going to die, and then a few hours
later it is torturing a sparrow in the garden. No one is anxious to
be mixed up in its sinister career. )</p>

<p>Indiscriminate murdering should certainly be discouraged.
Murders should only be done by people of great discrimination,
intelligence, and high moral courage. That is why wars are an evil,
because the wrong people both murder and get murdered.</p>

<p>But as populations increase so bewilderingly and social problems
become more and more complex, it is not at all certain that
Governments will not have to appoint bodies of refined and educated
official murderers who will go about among the people with a
licence to kill in their pockets. 'Their position will be somewhat
analogous to that of a doctor, and their mission somewhat similar,
only more direct. They should be carefully trained and be quite
unrecognizable. 'The effect of having social life leavened by such
a body of men would key up the whole standard of human behaviour
wonderfully.</p>

<p>Suppose, for instance, you were seated in a club listening to
some incredible old bore talking about his ailments. Suddenly a man
comes up and plunges a dagger into his heart. You would simply
say:</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir, but have you a licence?"</p>

<p>If he says no, of course you must have him arrested. But if he
says yes, and produces his licence, you merely thank him, and ring
for the waiter to come and clear up the mess. Your own behaviour
would improve remarkably. Imagine every time you go into a
restaurant or a bus and you don't know whether the quiet little man
in the corner may not have a licence in one pocket and a revolver
in the other. You would surely be constrained to act discreetly.
You would give up your seat to a woman or an older man. You
wouldn't throw banana-skins and paper about the streets, or write
foolish articles for the Press. You wouldn't ring people up early
in the morning, and then say: "Sorry you have been troubled." You
wouldn't come in late to the theatre and tell the person next to
you the story of the play in advance. You wouldn't be a Nosey
Parker or a Road Hog or a Superior Person. You would become
terribly nice.</p>

<p>Manners maketh man, and there is more unhappiness and distress
caused by ill manners than by what are known as crimes, Crimes are
comparatively rare, but bad manners are universal, and for some
obscure reason unpunishable. It seems strange that a man may get
six months' hard labour for stealing a sack of potatoes, but he may
walk down Bond Street wearing brown boots and a black tail coat,
and pass unmolested! He may drown the band with the noise he makes
eating soup. He may shout at the top of his voice all the good news
about himself in a crowded public conveyance, when every one else
is wanting to read. He can play a gramophone all day in some quiet
backwater. He can go into a private house without wiping his muddy
boots. He can bully waiters and be rude to servants, and there is
no Nemesis awaiting him.</p>

<p>How much better that he should die&mdash;swiftly, suddenly, and
as far as possible painlessly! And how much better that he should
know that he is liable to die if he does these things!</p>

<p>The human race established expressionism largely through the
agency of murder. One race murders another race, and so
superimposes one type upon another. The individual debarred from
this luxury by State laws is nevertheless a prolific murderer
through the agency of social conditions. He wants everything for
the people he loves and the rest can go hang. Perhaps even this
form of murder helps to shape the mysterious purposes of human
development.</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>The Present Seven Wonders of the
World</h2>

<p>According to an old tradition the Seven Wonders of the World
were as follows:</p>

<p>1. The Pyramids of Egypt.<br>
2. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon.<br>
3. The Temple of Diana at Ephesus.<br>
4. The statue of Zeus at Olympia.<br>
5. The tomb of King Mausolus at Halicarnassus.<br>
6. The Colossus of Rhodes.<br>
7. The Pharos of Alexandria (the first lighthouse).</p>

<p>But the time has come when we must seriously reconsider our
Wonders. The Pyramids still remain one of the Wonders, but many of
the others have become obsolete or have been superseded by more
Wonderful Wonders.</p>

<p>Now I take it that a Wonder is something that inspires Wonder.
It is not necessarily fine or beautiful, but a thing that creates
in us a sense of awe. The Pyramids remain a Wonder partly by their
inanity. I suppose the idea of lugging a lot of colossal stones out
into the desert, dumping them down in the sand, and piling them up
in the form of a pyramid is about the stupidest idea that ever
occurred to the mind of man. But they remain a Wonder partly for
this very reason, partly on account of their antiquity, and partly
on account of the mystery of their construction.</p>

<p>I should like to hear the opinion of some much travelled and
cultured authority on what he or she considers the Seven
present-day Wonders of the World.</p>

<p>Personally I do not feel competent to hazard a list. I neither
know enough nor have travelled enough. But it seems to me that the
most important element in Wonder is size. If a thing is only large
enough you cannot help being impressed by it. Nothing, for
instance, could be much uglier or less impressive than a
semicircular glass roof, but make it the size of Liverpool Street
Station and you create the atmosphere of a cathedral. Niagara is a
wonder, simply because it is an enormous mass of water falling over
enormous rocks. The Ford Motor Works are surely one of the Seven
modern Wonders of the World. But they wouldn't be if they were a
twentieth their size. The same holds good with the Woolworth
building in New York.</p>

<p>But well up in the list of the Seven modern Wonders I think J
should place the London police. 'The London police have this in
common with the Pyramids of Egypt in that both exude a sense of
perpetuity. But where the police score over the pyramids is that,
while equally impressive, they are a more sensible institution.
While we have the London police as a corporate entity we know that
nothing can go seriously wrong. They give an impression of a size
so vast as to epitomize fate itself. I think the Government made a
great mistake at the beginning of the War in drafting so many of
these good fellows into khaki units, drilling them, arming them,
and disguising them. If they had sent the whole lot out, armed with
nothing but white cotton gloves, the War instead of lasting four
and a half years would have been all over by tea-time on August 4,
1914. They would just have marched very slowly and deliberately up
to the German lines and said: "Now, then, come out of that! You
come along with me!" And the whole of the German army would have
been arrested and brought up at Bow Street the next morning and
suitably fined for carrying firearms without a licence. There would
have been no nonsense or fuss of any kind.</p>

<p>It is quite easy to kill a policeman, but almost impossible to
disobey him. He is enormous, incontrovertible, and eternal. His
pace never varies; his type never changes. He towers above us,
directing, controlling, mothering us. His attitude is aloof, but
essentially protective. When he arrests you, you know it is only
out of consideration for your own interests.</p>

<p>And we know that on the Day of Judgment the London police in
their white cotton gloves will be there in charge of the whole
situation. We shall hear the rich sleepy burr of their voices
exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Now, then, pass along, please! Don't crowd! Don't crowd!
There's plenty of time."</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>The Perils of Precision</h2>

<p>He has a new and very excellent red rubble tennis-court. Last
Sunday morning he asked me to go and make up a four with himself,
his wife, and a woman friend.</p>

<p>I turned up twelve minutes late. He was alone on the court,
doing something to the net. I said "Good morning!"</p>

<p>He looked up at me through his gold-rimmed spectacles, then took
out his watch, and regarded it and me alternately, as though he
were working out a mathematical problem. At last he said: "Good
morning!" by which I gathered that the gravity of my late arrival
had been overlooked by a narrow margin. I felt a little resentful
at this attitude, as although I was late the women were not there,
and he himself had not yet apparently got the court in working
order. He continued to potter about with the strap and chain. After
a minute or two I said: "It's a nice morning." He suddenly turned,
blinked up at the sky, and then blinked at me as though I had made
some astonishing statement. He said: "Now what do you mean
precisely by 'nice'? Do you mean it's a nice morning for tennis or
do you mean that the weather is nice? or what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Well," I stammered, "I just meant it was an&mdash;er&mdash;a
pleasant morning."</p>

<p>"Ah! there now I have you! Pleasant, yes! I understand now. But
'nice'!"</p>

<p>He walked to the end of the court and called out:</p>

<p>"Sophie!" At the window of the sitting-room above appeared his
wife, a fair, pretty thing, younger than he. She called back:</p>

<p>"Bertha and I are just coming."</p>

<p>"Yes," he called back. "But tell me, my dear, where is the
dictionary?"</p>

<p>"You had it at breakfast, James. I think you left it in the
bathroom."</p>

<p>"Come," he said. We went inside. He found the dictionary, and
examined it for some moments.</p>

<p>"It is as I thought," he continued. "'Nice' has several
meanings, but not one of which you could apply to a morning.
Dainty, delicate, polite, but the true and precise meaning of nice
is 'exact.' Now you cannot have an exact morning. Exactly what?
Exactly fine? Exactly wet? It is neither. The conditions exactly
right for tennis? If you argue that way you must first postulate
that all men and women are physically and temperamentally the same.
But whereas one man will play better on a fine day, another will
play better on a wet day. On a wet day the court is heavy and
demands physical strength in the player. That little girl Bertha
who is playing with us this morning is at a disadvantage on a wet
day. Therefore, as you cannot have an exact day, you cannot have a
nice day."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," I said faintly (I had been up very late the
previous evening). "Are we going to play soon?"</p>

<p>As I spoke the two women entered. He turned to them.</p>

<p>"Come, come," he said. "I said eleven o'clock. It is now
twenty-three minutes to twelve. Nothing is accomplished without
punctuality and precision."</p>

<p>"James," said his wife, "do you know you haven't got your shoes
on? And didn't you tell me last week you had lost your racket?
Where is it?"</p>

<p>"Lost!" he exclaimed. "I would hardly employ the word 'lost.'
Lost implies a condition of irrevocable irrecovery. Let us say
mislaid. It is true I took it to be restrung, and for the moment I
have forgotten which shop. However, I will use that oval-shaped
racket that Uncle Robert inadvertently left here. It has five
strings missing, and is concave in shape."</p>

<p>To my surprise, his wife&mdash;who had apparently been brought
up at the same school&mdash;here stepped into the breach.</p>

<p>"Why should you say it is concave any more than convex? No one
has ever yet discovered which is the front of a racket. Go and get
it, and put your shoes on."</p>

<p>It was ten minutes past twelve when we came out to play. A good
deal of the time was spent by James explaining the advantages of an
oval racket slightly warped, Einstein and the fourth dimension were
brought into it. It was finally decided that the best arrangement
would be for the men to play the women. James served. The first
ball went over the garden wall. The second ball hit me on the back
of the head. We crossed over and he served another double fault. At
that moment the telephone bell went somewhere upstairs. His wife
dashed off the court and disappeared.</p>

<p>"The telephone is sometimes very inconvenient," said Bertha.</p>

<p>"Inconvenient!" said James. "Now, when you say 'inconvenient,'
do you mean incommodious, unseasonable? What do you mean? One can
hardly call it unseasonable, because one has it all the year round.
Now the dictionary&mdash;to be precise&mdash;"</p>

<p>His wife appeared at the window above.</p>

<p>"James, it's Aunt Emma. She says: Do you know a word of seven
letters, beginning with <i>s</i> and ending with <i>a</i>, that
signifies a chemical substance only found in the quartz mountains
of East Borneo?"</p>

<p>The eyes of James narrowed. A kind of greedy look crept into
them. He was like a man whose secret vice had been discovered. He
leant the oval racket against the net and said:</p>

<p>"Perhaps I had better speak to her."</p>

<p>We all went in. The three of us sat in the lounge and he went
into the sitting-room. We sat there for twenty minutes. Above our
desultory conversation I caught such sentences as:</p>

<p>"No, no, my dear, when you refer to root, do you mean root in
the generic sense or in the purely vegetable sense?&mdash;Seven
down&mdash;it can only be the amboyna-tree&mdash;yes,
three&mdash;it doesn't fit in with spatula&mdash;sixteen across.
Innocuous has a very different meaning from innocent&mdash;"</p>

<p>When he at length returned Bertha said:</p>

<p>"What a lot of waste of time there is over those absurd
puzzles."</p>

<p>James regarded her critically.</p>

<p>"Waste! Now what do you mean precisely by 'waste'? The true
dictionary meaning of 'waste' is loss by dissipation, wantonness,
or negligence. You cannot possibly argue that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What I mean precisely is," said Bertha, "that the tennis has
consisted of you serving two double faults, and now it is pouring
with rain and time to go home to lunch."</p>

<p>At the door his wife apologized.</p>

<p>"Not at all," I said; "I've had a most delightful morning."</p>

<p>And then I caught the eye of James. I could see it coming.</p>

<p>"Delightful? Now what do you mean by delightful? Do you
mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>He didn't say it, however, and I turned my back quickly. As I
was going out Bertha said:</p>

<p>"Sorry you haven't had a nicer morning."</p>

<p>"Oh!" I answered, "it's been perfectly exact," and hurried
away.</p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>The Birth of Ideas</h2>

<p>"I haven't an idea in my head!" How often does one not hear this
expression! When stated by any kind of creative artist it implies a
grave but usually temporary disorder. For the world is governed by
Ideas. Indeed, the world wouldn't exist at all if some one hadn't
had the <i>idea</i> of a world, America wouldn't have been
discovered if some one hadn't visualized an America, All the arts,
sciences, religions, and philosophies owe their inception to an
idea. "The word comes from a Greek word which means 'to see." And
that is the whole point of Ideas. It is a question of mental
vision. There is a twilight borderland where Ideas dwell, And the
man of Ideas is usually the man who can the more easily relax
(mentally). In this condition his mentality is played upon by the
actions and movements of life going on around him. He becomes a
medium anxious to impart impressions. The practical person is often
lacking in ideas because he remains mentally rigid. He is not going
to stand any nonsense from ideas. He is impervious to outside
influences, Suppose several people enter a room&mdash;say the
drawing-room of a seaside boarding-house. To each one it is a
different emotional experience. One man will instinctively value
the furniture; another will be depressed by the sordid atmosphere.
A painter will see it in terms of paint; the satirist regard it in
the light of a cynical jest. One man will go straight up to examine
a print on the wall; another will take up a book from the table to
see what book it is. To one person it may seem a gay and pleasant
room; to another just the reverse. 'They are all media played upon
at various angles by the Idea which created the room.</p>

<p>When it comes to the creative artist the importance of the
effect is manifest. The room <i>must</i> mean something to him. He
cannot mentally afford to regard it just as a boarding-house
drawing-room with so many chairs, tables, and what-nots. It must be
the playground of his emotions. It is for this reason perhaps that
so many great artists are just egoists and babies. An evening spent
in this room by a pork-packer might be tolerable and even pleasant,
but an evening spent in that same room by a Whistler or a Beethoven
would be torture (especially if the daughter of the house played
the piano!). But it doesn't follow that the room would be
antipathetic to any creative artist. Mr Pett Ridge might find it a
source of inspiration; Mr H. M. Bateman a rich field of comic
ideas, The point is that to every one every human experience means
something different. It is not the coward who dies a hundred
deaths; it is the man of imagination, because he can visualize the
whole thing in detail before it happens. It is often the dolt who
"only tastes of death but once."</p>

<p>One cannot force ideas, though they may be sometimes lured over
the borderland, One has to lie in wait. Sometimes they creep out
and gambol like rabbits at sundown. Then you have to seize one of
the little rascals by the scruff of the neck and carry him off. And
there is this to be said for them. Like rabbits they breed rapidly.
It may be the tiniest suggestion, but once born they are&mdash;like
everything that lives&mdash;a complete entity.</p>

<p>The strange part about it is that an idea need not be
original&mdash;it seldom is&mdash;but it must be original to
oneself. One often hears a statement of a truth which Comes to one
in the form of a revelation. And one says: "Why, of course, I've
always thought that!" At the same time, it has not been revealed to
us before. It is as though there were a great common pool of ideas
into which we are all allowed to dip. We draw out the ideas and
they flow through our minds, and when we have done with them they
flow back again. And the pool is unfathomable, inexhaustible, and
terribly mysterious.</p>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>Summer Melancholy</h2>

<p>During the long winter months the average Londoner puts his
emotions away into cold storage. He grouses and grumbles about the
weather, but he doesn't really mind it. He doesn't notice it,
except as a convenient subject to grouse and grumble about. He gets
on with his work and business and is quite happy.</p>

<p>And then one day he is conscious of something stirring, he feels
it in his bones. He looks out of the window and sees the buds. The
young shoots are appearing. He regards them with surprise as though
he never expected to see them again. He feels strangely restless,
The weeks pass, and the gardens and the parks are aglow with white
and pink blossoms. The shutters are opened in the great house in
the square. The exquisite people have returned, Thin, tanned,
beautifully groomed old gentlemen appear in Piccadilly. Exquisite
ladies, with weary eyes, bearing the perfume of foreign lands, step
from the upholstered sanctuary of their limousines on to the flags
of Bond Street. He knows then that the summer is upon him, and his
heart is filled with melancholy.</p>

<p>The contemplation of beauty in any form produces a sense of
melancholy, because the possessive sense is outraged, Seeing it all
he wants to possess it all. Health and wealth, the flowers at his
feet, love, beauty, wisdom, and the stars above him. He wants to
take them in his arms in one supreme moment that is somehow made to
last for ever. And because it is all unattainable, because he is so
poor, so insufficient a thing in this vast fecundity, his heart is
heavy within him. If only it would all keep still, be his very own.
But it is shifting, shifting, and he is being left behind.</p>

<p>He shakes himself and goes on with his work, but it is difficult
to concentrate. A starling awakes him in the twilight of dawn.
Strange surgings and desires pass through him, surgings and desires
that are always freshly unfamiliar, and yet older than the earth.
New friendships entice him, old affections quicken to the beat of
unfamiliar rhythms, He is wretchedly unhappy, but desperately in
love with life. Perhaps the lover is always unhappy, because
something tells him that satiety is an illusion.</p>

<p>London in the early summer! is there anywhere richer in the
things that matter? Music and laughter, wise men and beautiful
women, old trees, old traditions, majestic squares, good wine, the
thrill of sport, the pageantry of royalty&mdash;already he
envisages the flashing by of the familiar signposts that mark the
accustomed course, from the first cricket match at Lord's to the
Derby, Henley, Wimbledon, Eton and Harrow, and so on to that remote
affair known as Goodwood, when the whole thing blows up. The
exquisite people vanish then like dead leaves in an autumn wind, He
himself goes away with his wife and family to the sea for a week or
two, but the glory has already begun to fade. He lies on the beach,
with his legs wide apart, staring at the sea. And he thinks to
himself: "It's a rum funny business!"</p>

<p>And then the evening comes on, and the vast immensity of sea and
sky becomes flooded with orange and amber! He regards it with awe
and a kind of soul-hunger which he knows will never be satisfied.
It terrifies him and makes him sad again. And so one day he packs
his bag and returns to London. And he takes up his pen, or his
tools, or his brushes, and he bends once more over his work. And he
is happy again&mdash;until the next summer. Here is something which
he may possess entirely. Here is a little niche in the cosmic
universe he may fill completely, something which is his own,
perhaps the only thing which is his own&mdash;the right to
serve.</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>East or West?</h2>

<p>To compare one civilization with another it is an obvious
advantage to know something of both. Nevertheless there are certain
generalizations concerning Eastern and Western people discernible
to the eye. And the difference largely centres round what may be
called mobility. I went to a little Mozabite town in Southern
Algeria called Ben-is-Guen. It is the most spectacularly immobile
place I have ever visited. In the first place it was built in the
second century, and nothing has altered since. There are the same
people living in the same buildings, wearing the same clothes,
thinking the same things, having the same mental outlook for two
thousand years. And you have only to look at them to know
that&mdash;unless through some external pressure&mdash;they will be
just the same two thousand years hence.</p>

<p>The Mozabite, you must understand, is a perfect gentleman,
Ben-is-Guen is a holy city. You are not even allowed to smoke a
cigarette there, nor is any alcoholic liquor allowed to enter the
town. At sundown every Arab, Christian, or Jew has to leave it. No
Arab, Christian, or Jew has ever spent a night at Ben-is-Guen. The
Mozabite gets up early in the morning in order to go out and sit in
the sun and do nothing. He does this until it is time to go home to
lunch. After this he has his siesta. About three or four o'clock in
the afternoon you see crowds of Mozabites emerge from their houses
with enormous keys, about a foot long. They look like benign
Blue-beards, They lock up their houses (and their wives) and amble
up to the market-place. And there they sit on their haunches, five
deep, for the rest of the day and do absolutely nothing.
Occasionally a stranger will rush round the market with a shawl or
a rug, but nobody buys it, and so he goes home. The market is
presided over by the Caid, who sits on a chair and does nothing.
Nobody does anything. It is marvellous. No women or children are
allowed in the market-place. I presume because they might introduce
an element of mobility. Women&mdash;when they do appear&mdash;are
swathed in miles of <i>haik</i>, with only one eye showing.
According to the Mohammedan religion they have no souls. 'They just
die. 'They are treated on the same plane as donkeys, or rather on a
lower plane, because you may talk to a Mozabite about his donkey,
but he regards it as an insult if you refer to his wife. As though
you had referred to something unclean. He held these views in the
second century, and you know quite well he will hold them in the
year 3925.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he is for the most part clean, moral,
and&mdash;a point that must impress any Westerner&mdash;he takes
his religion very seriously. There is about him an extraordinary
air of benevolent detachment.</p>

<p>Now as a social proposition which of these two civilizations is
one to regard as the better?</p>

<p>Personally I would plump for the Western every time. The West,
with its external ugliness, its commercialism, lack of religion,
its sordid problems, cocktails, night-clubs, shingled smoking
girls, its restlessness, its craze for excitement&mdash;well, it
has in any case the genius of being dissatisfied. It marches. The
self-complacency of the East is a thing to be seen to be believed.
The West doesn't know what it wants, But it is always groping out,
feeling its way toward something, inventing new religions, new
philosophies, twisting its mental outlook, shifting and reforming
its social groups. It is terribly mobile, dangerously so to itself
sometimes.</p>

<p>When I sat in the market-place at Ben-is-Guen and thought of the
tortuous history of Europe during all those two thousand years
while these dear old gentlemen had just been sitting there, looking
kind and thinking nice thoughts, I shuddered. To attempt to
perpetuate a static condition is to deny God and Nature. I might
conceivably believe that the incompetent plumber who comes to mend
my lavatory basin has a soul, but that Rebecca West hasn't. But I
couldn't go on believing this for thousands of years. Oh, no,
East!</p>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>The Absurdity Of Facts</h2>

<p>The writer of fiction is always handicapped by the crudity and
absurdity of facts. His business is to strike a sane balance in a
mad world. He has to create situations which are not only probable,
but which convince the reader as being probable; whereas the most
fantastic, unlikely, bizarre, improbable things are happening in
real life every day. If he does create such a situation the Knowing
One comes along and says:</p>

<p>"Ah! this is all right, but it is bad psychology. A woman
wouldn't have done so-and-so under such-and-such
circumstances."</p>

<p>As though anyone could dogmatize with regard to how a woman
would act under any circumstances! Or a man either, for that
matter. Now a dictionary defines psychology as "the science of mind
on the data of consciousness." The only trouble with this
definition is that there is no such thing as a "science of mind."
People talk airily of psychology as though it were a thing you
could learn, like chemistry or algebra. But the mind of man Is too
elusive, too complex, and too fluid to be circumscribed by the
tenets of a defined science. For one thing, it is always changing,
always moving on, both individually and collectively. The ideals of
yesterday are the commonplaces of to-morrow. The psychology of one
generation is unrecognizable in the next. The psychology of one
individual may convey nothing to another.</p>

<p>The individual and the herd interpret the data of consciousness
in a subtle and ever-varying language. One person is unable to
conceive the mentality which would lead to murder, quite unaware
that the man he is dining with, and who is talking so charmingly
about Chinese porcelain, murdered a woman in Australia last year.
This is a perfectly conceivable situation, but presented in fiction
people would say: "No. A man who murdered a woman in Australia last
year wouldn't talk about Chinese porcelain. He would always be
looking furtively around, and you could tell by his eyes that he
had committed a dreadful crime."</p>

<p>Fiction must have form, but facts are amoeboid. Ina novel or a
story everything must take its place and contribute to the
structure of the whole. Facts are for the most part unrelated. Try
and consider your own life as it would appear in the form of
fiction. You may have had romances and strange experiences, but
they are all disconnected. The facts that have cumbered your way
would make very dull reading. We have probably all at some time,
for instance, found "the time, the place, and the loved one all
together." And then perhaps when you turn up you get a piece of
grit in your eye, or the girl has raging neuralgia. 'These absurd
facts would ruin fiction. People don't get grit in their eyes or
have neuralgia in fiction. It is indeed astonishing what wonderful
health people in fiction enjoy. You never read of a hero who gets
pyorrhoea, and who has to have all his teeth out, but there are
many heroes in real life who do. Heroines are particularly healthy.
They often get up at dawn&mdash;a horrid hour!&mdash;and go for a
ramble through the meadows picking flowers. Have you ever seen a
woman at dawn? She looks her worst. And if she is young&mdash;as
all heroines must be&mdash;she likes to sleep till at least eight
o'clock, and even then she is likely to be catty till you have
plied her with hot tea and eggs and bacon.</p>

<p>But to return to your own life, can you say that it has form? Is
there any working up to a climax, and then letting down gently to
the end? I think not You are indeed hardly connected with what you
were yourself twenty years ago. Memory fades, and desires and
convictions change. You are a queer nebulous mass of passions,
emotions, prejudices, and desires linking the dead with the
unborn.</p>

<p>If you were fiction you would be rounded and complete, but
because you are only just a bundle of facts you are really rather
absurd, you know.</p>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>The Season of Hope</h2>

<p>Faith and Charity may be greater, but Hope is the girl of grit.
She is a born fighter, tenacious and unbeatable, with inexhaustible
powers of 'coming back.' This morning I saw her heralds, little
yellow and violet things sprouting in the grass between the graves
of the cemetery. I suddenly realized then that while we have all
been talking the back of the thing has become broken.</p>

<p>Hope did it. The Londoner emerges, like a sparrow that has been
out all night in the rain, shaking its feathers and chirruping upon
the window-sill. Soon the boys will begin to oil their bats and
dream of centuries. The rich will come trailing back from Spain and
Switzerland, and mighty glad they'll be to come. The long months of
darkness, rain, and fog are penetrated by the sword of this
persistent goddess. The Londoner is faithful to her. He grouses and
grumbles and loves it all, because she is ever by his side. He is
sustained not only by her but her thousand children. His heart is
warmed by their little clinging arms, his senses quickened by their
little whispers. For sometimes he hardly dare listen. The pictures
they draw are so dazzling, the visions they conjure up so
bright.</p>

<p>Bills and debts accumulate and he dreams of winning the Calcutta
Sweepstake. He is ageing and broken in health, but there is always
that beautiful woman who will one day love him passionately. The
incurable knows that to-morrow a miracle will happen.</p>

<p>Every one goes through the day fortified by the little gifts of
Hope. But with more than anything perhaps does she play with the
dreams of wealth. People could not live under the appalling
conditions that so many do, were it not that, at the back of their
minds, there is always this established idea that they will one day
be, not only better off, but romantically rich. The ways and means
are of no consequence. The thing will happen somehow. Destroy the
millionaire, and you rob the working-man of his choicest idol.</p>

<p>Man plays with the dreams of wealth because he knows that wealth
can give him the things he understands, material comforts,
security, even romance. But deeper down than this Hope is also
busy. The man understands wealth, but he only vaguely understands
himself...where he is joined up at either end. He knows his actions
have reactions, and that the reaction has a sharper recoil than the
force of the action. And this is always disconcerting him. For he
perceives that in the train of the goddess there follow also
unpleasant little imps called disappointments. And right deep down
in his heart he nurtures the greatest dream of all&mdash;the dream
of a vague and ultimate satiety, that shall have no reaction, that
shall be in fact a condition of perfection.</p>

<p>Well, let him. He may be right. Hope is a liberal mistress, and
withholds her goods from no one. The more you take the more she
tempts you. 'The crocuses are out in the park for anyone to see. Mr
Shaw has come back from Madeira. 'The world didn't end on February
6. England has won a Test match. A friend returned me a book the
other day. He had only had it two years.</p>

<p>I know that everything now is going to be all right. There will
be no more wars. Mr Kirkwood will accept a peerage. No one will
send me 'final demand notes' (printed in red) saying that unless I
pay some mysterious sum&mdash;which is never explained how arrived
at&mdash;under Schedule P.Q. within three days, I shall be cut off
or cut up, or in some other way dismembered. That girl in the
flesh-coloured stockings, whom I pass on the way to the pillar-box,
will smile at me pleasantly for once, No one will write anonymous
and abusive letters telling me what silly nonsense I write for an
evening newspaper. And then J shall win the Calcutta Sweepstake,
and every one will be kind and charitable and companionable, and
Well, really, my <i>dear</i> Hope!</p>

<p><i>What</i> a hope!</p>
