<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>This book is an attempt to compress into one volume a very large
subject, and must, of necessity, be only an outline-sketch of a
century of our sea story. A practical knowledge of the sea,
considerable acquaintance with ships, sailors, and seaports, a good
library, and twenty years' study of sea literature, are the
qualifications I possess to write upon the subject. I ask readers
to accept these things, as in some measure, a set-off against the
faults I am well aware the book must have. I think it fair to
myself to state, that although this volume treats of a well-worn
subject, there is much new matter in it, at all events much that is
new so far as modern books are concerned. In certain of the
chapters, such as that on Naval War and that on Exploration, it was
essential for the completeness of the work to write them; but the
subjects have been so often and so well treated that I have seen no
other way of dealing with them, than to make the chapters a summary
of the century's annals. In other chapters, such as those on sea
customs and the sea language, and that on the story of the south
seas, I think most of the matter will be new to book readers. All
through this work I have shaped a course for myself, and where I
have dredged in the same waters as others, I have done so
consciously, but only so far as was necessary in the process of
crossing their tracks.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I. SHIPS AT THE BEGINNING OF
THE CENTURY.</h2>

<h3>The Royal Navy and its Armament&mdash;The Merchant
Service.</h3>

<p>A COMPANY of King Alfred's archers in a war galley, and a
torpedo gun-boat and her crew, are not more unlike than the navy of
what has been aptly called "eighteen hundred and wartime," and the
navy of to-day. Yet so close to us is this "bow and arrow" period
of our naval service, that Provo Wallis, who brought the
<i>Shannon</i> out of action in 1813, died an Admiral of the Fleet
in 1892. Born in 1791, he joined the <i>Cleopatra</i> in 1804, when
some of the men of Anson's squadron were still living. Here is a
suggestion of service links in a chain, stretching from 1900 down
to the twilight of English Royal Naval History, when the ships of
the Cinque Ports were the war navy on which Englishmen placed their
chief dependence.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 2</p>-->

<p>To picture to oneself the ships, the seamen, how they lived, and
fought, and died&mdash;the sea-life as it was before the peace, as
it was, in fact, for a hundred years before, and for a generation
in this century&mdash;I know no better reading than the <i>Naval
Crononicle</i>. Not those parts of it printed in big type,
biographies of naval heroes, descriptions of sea-fights, and the
like, which have all been reprinted often enough in modern books,
but the insignificant little paragraphs that tell of what one may
call the domestic history of ships and seamen. The first number of
the magazine was printed in January 1799, when folks were still
talking of "Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson's engagement of the
Nile." They fired salutes and used much oil in illumination when
the news reached England, but even the young people were hardly so
enthusiastic as we are on these occasions now&mdash;there was much
more talk over the taking of Khartoum&mdash;but then such
rejoicings were not novelties. Since the Peace of Ryswick in 1697,
no child had grown to man's estate without more than once seeing
some ceremony of the kind, for in a hundred years England, during
more than half the period, had been at war.</p>

<p>What the ships in the first half of the century were like, and
the story of the changes in shipbuilding, will, I hope, unfold
itself as this book proceeds, without much quoting of tonnage and
dimension figures. The Englishmen who every summer visit
Portsmouth, and from the deck where Nelson fell, look around them
at the modern war-vessels anchored near the <i>Victory</i>, can
take in at a glance most of what it would require many pages to
express in print. If the form of expression may be permitted.
Nelson's <i>Victory</i>, launched in 1765, still afloat and an
Admiral's flagship, in her name personifies the navy of two past
centuries, and remains a living comparison wath the ships of the
beginning of a third.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 3</p>-->

<p>On the night of October 4th, 1744, the <i>Victory</i>, Sir John
Balchen's flagship, and the finest and largest ship of her time,
was lost off the Caskets. If a man who had never looked at
pictures, or heard, or read of what has happened in the last
hundred years, were shown Nelson's <i>Victory</i> and the modern
battle-ship <i>Implacable</i>, his mind could no more take in the
idea that both were ships, than he could be made to understand that
a big water-boiler on wheels was the successor to a team of
coach-horses. Yet between Balchen's <i>Victory</i> and Nelson's,
the eye of a shipwright or a sailor is needed to find a difference;
between Balchen's <i>Victory</i> and the men-of-war of a century
still earlier, the difference is still only great in the eyes of
experts; between Nelson's <i>Victory</i> and the ships that many
men still at sea first sailed in, the contrast is scarcely
greater.</p>

<p>In 1802 <i>Le Commerce de Marseilles</i> was broken up, and she
was then the largest ship in the King's service. Hood brought her
out of Toulon in 1793, and sailed her to Portsmouth, but the docks
there were not large enough to accommodate her, and so she was sent
to Plymouth, where she was used as a prison ship. Her greatest
length was 211 ft. 7 in., but figures express little. If she were
afloat and converted into a coal hulk, three like her could lie
ahead of each other alongside the latest White Star steamer, the
<i>Oceanic</i>, of 704 ft, and the liner would overlap by nearly 70
ft., more than the length of the first British passenger steamer.
The displacement of <i>Le Commerce de Marseilles</i> was 2800 tons,
far ahead of anything then afloat or until the thirties. The
displacement of the <i>Implacable</i> is 15,000 tons, that of the
<i>Oceanic</i> 28,500 tons.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 4</p>-->

<p>The navy at the beginning of the century counted II battleships,
mounting from 100 to 112 guns. The thirty-two pounder was the
standard weapon, a few forty-twos existed, and sixty-eight pounders
were cast, but this was a rare gun, seldom seen on ship board. The
carronadc, a short range gun throwing a heavy shot for its size,
had since 1797 been largely used on poop and forecastle in place of
the nine-pounder which a century before had displaced the Falcons,
Sakers, and Minions, names old-fashioned, though not strange in the
ears of sailors a hundred years ago, but familiar to us only as
ancient history. For a forty-two, 14 lbs. of powder was a charge,
and 10 lbs. 11 oz. for a thirty-two, and men handled such
quantities of gunpowder with more care than is apparent in the
modern gunner's ways with a fifty-pounds weight cartridge of
"cocoa" powder.</p>

<p>A distinguished authority writing on ships and their armaments
in 1800 shows us what he thought was the limit of possibility in
these things. Mr R. Willett wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"The size of our ships seems now to have
reached nearly its ultimatum; for nature herself, in some measure,
fixes its limits. It is man who is to navigate and manage them, and
unless our bodily strength could be increased likewise, every
manoeuvre on board them must be conducted with difficulty and
delay. For though the mechanic powers are almost boundless, the
application of them, for the purposes of navigation, is more
confined. The cordage, when made larger, will be rendered difficult
to pass through the pulleys, and so large, at last, as not to pass
at all. Timber, the growth of nature, as much as man, cannot be
made to grow larger, and the very element (in harbours at least) in
which they are to navigate, have only certain depths, that cannot
be increased. And let it be remembered, as a certain axiom in
mechanics, that what we gain in power we must be contented to lose
in time. Every operation on board will therefore become laborious,
dilatory, and even uncertain. The French, indeed, have latterly
built a ship of most extraordinary size, 172 ft. keel for tonnage,
by 55 ft. 9 in. by the beam, tonnage about 2850 tons, but she is
pronounced to be entirely unfit for service, and hath never been
out of harbour; and the Spaniards are said (and that by such a
respectable authority as that of the Marquis Del Campo) to have
built one still larger; but the Spaniards, on sending this unwieldy
monster to sea, found that she must have been lost, if they had not
had the precaution to send out two other ships with her, which
towed and brought her back again."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 5</p>-->

<p>The propelling power of ships, that is the sails, the area of
them, and the method of setting the canvas and handling it
generally, was the same at the beginning of the century as it had
been a hundred years earlier, and as it remained for all practical
purposes to within a generation of the present. Anchors and cables,
steering gear, running and standing rigging, in the time of Anson,
were the same things in the time of Nelson, and officers still
holding Queen Victoria's commission would find no difficulty in
handling the warships of Queen Anne.</p>

<p>If a landsman looks at a model or a picture of a battleship of
the forties of this century, and of the time of Anson, he can take
in at a glance the changes. Beak-head bows, and heavy stern
galleries in tiers, sometimes of three one above another, the
lateen mizzen, the high poop with big lanterns in which a man could
stand upright, a towering forecastle and a bowsprit with the
sprit-mast erected upon it, these are the readiest ways of
identifying the ships of the earlier period. In the present century
the stern was rounded, and small stern-walks took the place of the
heavy galleries, the bows were lightened, and the beak-head
removed; the spanker-boom and gaff came in, and the lateen sail
went out; and the sprit-topsail disappeared from the bowsprit,
leaving only the sprit-sail yard in its place. The jack-staff on
the bows of steamers remains to-day a last link, with the
picturesque sprit-mast and its rigging. In those days they painted
warships black outside and blood-red inside. Nelson introduced the
coloured streak, and in 1805 painted the <i>Victory</i> black with
yellow streaks round her, and in that year she was painted inside a
dull green and red; now she is the regulation white inside, and
black and white outside.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 6</p>-->

<p>In addition to 11 first rates, there were in the service at the
close of the century, 24 second rates mounting from 98 guns to 84
guns, 150 third rates mounting from 80 to 64 guns, 28 fourth rates
mounting from 60 guns to 50 guns, 150 fifth rates mounting from 50
to 32 guns, and 72 sixth rates mounting from 30 to 20 guns. Besides
these rated vessels there were 190 vessels mounting from 18 guns to
6 guns not rated, 10 yachts, 72 hired armed vessels, 15 luggers,
and 38 revenue cutters. Among the yachts was the <i>William and
Mary</i>, 8 guns, built at Blackwall in 1694, the oldest vessel in
the navy. Altogether, then, there were on the <i>Navy List</i> at
the beginning of this century, 435 rated ships, and 325 vessels not
rated&mdash;more than 700 ships.</p>

<p>Our present <i>Navy List</i> only shows about 550 ships. No
wonder when the peace came there were so many unemployed seamen,
for within a few months after the conclusion of the war only 160
ships were left in commission.</p>

<p>A first rate of the old navy, not counting the poop and
forecastle, had five decks, though she was technically a
"three-decker," because her main armament was carried upon three
decks only. These were the batteries from which a broadside of from
1700 to 2030 lbs. could be fired. I have by me Sir Home Popham's
books of <i>Instructions</i>, etc., published in 1805,
<i>Regulations and Instructions relating to His Majesty's Service
at Sea</i>, 1796, and many similar works dating from the eighties
of last century, and comparing these with Mile's <i>Epitome of the
Royal Navy</i>, published in 1841, and with a personal knowledge
from the early seventies, it is remarkable how in their internal
economy and in anything except from the technical point of view,
the ships of any date from the middle of the seventeenth century to
nearly the middle of the eighteenth, differ from each other. The
hulks in Portsmouth harbour still afloat, whether built in 1805 or
in 1850, to the landsman's eye are alike.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 7</p>-->

<p>The five decks of the three-decker were named upper, main,
middle, lower, and orlop. The poop (<i>Castilla de Poppa</i>) was a
Spanish word, and we learnt it from the Spaniards&mdash;we learnt
much of our sea knowledge from the Dutchmen and Spaniards&mdash;the
poop was, and still is, that part of the ship especially allotted
to the officers, and some of the customs of the sea presently to be
stated peculiarly belong to it and still survive, even in the
modern iron tank cargo carrier. It occupied a great part of the
upper deck, extending from the stern about half-way to the
mainmast, the space between the break of the poop and the mainmast
being the quarter-deck, the parade ground of the floating barracks,
the spot where Nelson fell. The quarter-deck is still sacred to the
officers, and a place of many ceremonies; but much of its glory has
departed, for though the great steering wheels of modern men-of-war
are sometimes still upon the quarter-deck, the helmsman is on the
bridge guiding the steam-steerinsc wheel with his finfjer. Between
the mainmast and the foremast were the gangways, and forward of the
foremast, the forecastle.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 8</p>-->

<p>The main deck, as its name implies, was the principal "storey"
of the structure. It communicated with the quarter-deck by several
ladders, its after end was portioned off, and the space given to
the admirals' or senior officers' quarters. Outside this, round the
stern, and also from two other decks, ran those galleries called
stern walks, familiar in the pictures, and of which there still
remain slight substitutes on the larger modern ships. Amidships,
upon the main deck, the space was reserved for carrying on the
mechanical work of the ship. Here sailmakers, ropemakers,
blacksmiths, armourers, coopers, and carpenters wrought at their
several trades. Forward of this was the galley, where the meals for
a thousand persons were cooked, and forward of this again were
enclosures for the officers' live-stock&mdash;if they were lucky
enough to have any. Along the whole length of the deck on both
sides were the rows of "thirty-twos," seventeen on either
side&mdash;grim reminders that from this deck and from all others,
when the roll of the drum beat to quarters, carpenters,
blacksmiths, and the rest of them dropped their tools, and from
peaceful artisans rushed to their stations and became sail-trimmers
or gunners. Below the main deck was the middle deck, reached by a
double ladder amidships; at the bottom of the ladders were the
entry ports on either side&mdash;the main entrances to the ship. In
the after-part of this deck was the wardroom, the wardroom
officers' cabins occupying spaces between the guns aft. Petty
officers, landsmen, and marines lived amidships, and forward and up
in the bows was the sick bay or hospital. From seventeen ports on
either side, just as on the deck above, the muzzles of the
thirty-twos pointed, and besides these there were probably a couple
of eight-inch guns.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 9</p>-->

<p>Below the middle was the lower or gun deck, sustaining the
heaviest of the guns, 4 eight-inch and 28 thirty-two pounders. In
the after-part was the gun-room, separated from the rest of the
deck by a row of muskets and marines' bayonets, and within the
barricade the great ship's tiller traversed. Volunteers, masters,
assistants, and similar ranks of officers messed here, and the
sleeping cabins of some of the junior wardroom officers were on
either side. Before the barricade of small arms lived the main body
of seamen, their mess tables slung by long iron hooks from the
beams above, and between the guns at meal times&mdash;at nights the
hammocks in place of the mess tables. Amidships were the ship's
four main pumps, equal to clearing her well of water at the rate of
9 tons a minute, and forward were the ranges of cables for sheet
and bower anchors&mdash;the great sheet-anchor hempen cable 26
inches in circumference.</p>

<p>Below the middle deck was the orlop, forward the fore cockpit,
and many storerooms, and gunner, boatswain, and carpenter's cabins.
And below these again, the principal magazine containing about 35
tons of powder, guarded from fire by arrangements of water-tanks
and pipes for flooding; no light was admitted to the magazine,
except through the light room, an apartment adjoining but well
separated, and a sentry was on duty day and night at the passage to
the entrance. The after cockpit&mdash;where Nelson died&mdash;was
the home of the youngsters when the ship was not in action, and in
the hour of battle was the operating room of the surgeons. Below
this was the after magazine for small arms, and filled cartridges
for the great guns, and more storerooms; and below the orlop
amidships were the holds for ballast and the wells.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 10</p>-->

<p>The captain who commanded a line of battle ship of the class
described had every reason to walk his quarter-deck with the air of
a great personage. If nowadays the modern battleship costs more in
money to build, the old ship carried in her timbers the growth of
ninety or a hundred years of English oak, and a fifty-acre forest
was needed for the two thousand well-grown trees required to find
the timber for a seventy-four. The cost of building her with all
equipment, exclusive of provisions, was about £120,000, and a
couple of hundred shipwrights took a year to do the work.</p>

<p>Quite as beautiful, if less imposing in their appearance, were
the little vessels at the bottom of the <i>Navy List</i>. Brigs
with a complement of sixty men and a broadside of 90 lbs. Schooners
with raking masts, when a rake was needed to keep their bows out of
water as they were driven along, reeling beneath the weight of fore
and aft canvas, bearing home news of victory from the scene of
action; and cutters with thirty or forty men of a crew, commanded
by some "sucking Nelson" of tender years, but with heart great
enough to attack an enemy's frigate if luck would only bring him
athwart one, so that he might use his six-pounder pop-guns&mdash;a
broadside that his second in command, a grey-headed boatswain's
mate, could carry in his arms.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 11</p>-->

<p>The largest and best of the East India Company's cruisers
differed very little from ships of the line in the Royal Navy, just
as the brigs of war and such small vessels in the service of the
King only differed from merchant vessels in that they carried no
cargoes, and were commanded by a lieutenant in the navy, instead of
a merchant shipmaster. In the modern royal and merchant navies,
ships, officers, and men are entirely unlike; a hundred years ago
almost all the difference lay in the ownership of the vessels. Now,
the only connecting link between ships flying the red and the white
ensigns&mdash;traders and fighting ships&mdash;are those entitled
to display the blue ensign, the mark of the Royal Naval Reserve, of
vessels subsidised, or otherwise liable to be used by the
Government in time of war.</p>

<p>Early in the century nearly every merchant ship carried guns,
and there were regular "armed merchantmen," "letters of marque,"
"privateers," expressions having practically the same meaning,
viz., vessels privately owned but equipped to fight, and authorised
to do so by the State. War being the normal condition brought about
this state of affairs. The trader, however peacefully inclined he
might be, could not sail in any sea without risk of falling in with
an enemy, and convoy could not always be obtained. Where there was
no danger from the ships of an unfriendly power, pirates and
savages had to be reckoned with, and besides considerations of
self-defence, a well-armed merchantman often earned something for
her owners and crew, by the capture of vessels of her own class
belonging to the enemy.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 12</p>-->

<p>The Company's Eastern monopolies were the source of enormous
riches, but the cost was in proportion. A return of the losses in
the naval service by wreck and capture at sea, shows that for a
period of two financial years, 1807-8 and 1808-9, 14 vessels had
been lost or captured, their value, including money expended in
manning them, etc., exceeding £1,200,000 sterling. The Accountant
General of the Company estimated that if this sum had not been lost
to the service it would have earned for the shareholders upwards of
£1,000,000. The Company, therefore, had every inducement to arm
their vessels and supply them with capable officers and drilled
crews. The records of the time give accounts of many well-fought
actions between Company's ships and French war-vessels, and when
one of the enemy's privateers fell foul of an East Indiaman under
the impression that she had an easy capture in a peaceful
merchantman, it more often than otherwise ended in the Frenchman
getting a sound thrashing, if not in his capture.</p>

<p>The North Country collier was <i>the</i> type of our merchantmen
at the beginning of the century, and you can see the North Country
collier still afloat, with very small difference, the same kind of
hull that Cook went to sea in. The East and West Indiamen were the
crack vessels of the time&mdash;ships ranging from 300 tons to 800
tons, but they were no more types of our merchant service as a
whole, than are the Atlantic Greyhounds of our Mercantile Marine
now. Down to the sixties folks talked with pride of uncle George,
who commanded a fine East or West Indiaman, much as they do now of
uncle Adolphus, who is captain of a P. &amp; O. or Cunard Liner,
"and belongs to the Naval Reserve, you know."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 13</p>-->

<p>In those days there were rigs whose very names are nearly
forgotten. Pinks, Snows, Hermaphrodite, and Jackass brigs, and the
like, merely varieties of two-masted or barque-rigged vessels,
differing so slightly that in these days of steam we cannot
understand why sailors had such fancies. Why, for example, should a
man put a small trysail-mast abaft his brig's mainmast, and call
his vessel a Snow? Did such an alteration make a perceptible
difference in her speed, her steering, or her capacity to sail
close to the wind? Contemporary reading only informs us that
experts differed then on such matters, just as engineers differ now
over boiler and fuel questions, and certainly the modern sailor
knows too little of sailing to be able to enlighten us on
technicalities which our forefathers disputed.</p>

<p>Rope-rigging, heavy spars, and big single topsails in the
beginning of the century, common to all ships, made it difficult,
even for a sailor, to distinguish between a merchantman and a
war-vessel when a ship was sighted hull down. Hulls, too, were not
as they now are, absolutely unlike. No one now could mistake any
merchant steamer afloat for any ship on the <i>Navy List</i>. But
the wooden hulls of the smaller frigates and inferior rates
differed in no material respect from those of the better class of
merchantmen&mdash;it was even quite possible in the present reign
to mistake Geordie's collier <i>Sarah Jane</i> of Hull, for Her
Majesty's brig of war <i>Mutine</i>.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 14</p>-->

<p>But inboard things were different. Merchant ships were much
smaller than they are now, yet carried many more men, and these
were crowded together in an ill-ventilated forecastle, which, if
below the one deck, was so evil-smelling and foul, that in fine
weather even old salts preferred to sleep on the forehatch; and if
on deck was so ill-protected from the sea that it was continually
awash, and the crew, as often as not, slept in their oilskins. The
outward aspect of the merchant-ship has changed, that is apparent
to every one; but the accommodation of the seamen remains much the
same, and in the modern man-o'-war, with every desire on the part
of his superiors to treat the bluejacket well, the limited space in
which he is quartered leaves him in this respect no better off, if
so well, as were the sailors of the old line of battle ships.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II. SEAPORTS AND
DOCKYARDS.</h2>

<h3>The Old Seaside Population&mdash;Shipwrights and
Thieves&mdash;The Story of Some Ships&mdash;The Great Timber
Question&mdash;"What's in a Name?"</h3>

<p>The story of the changes in ships and in the people who live on
them and by them is nowhere more clearly written than in the
history of the growth or decline in importance of our seaports.
Take for a text Portsmouth, Chatham, or Plymouth, London, Bristol,
Liverpool, Glasgow, Hull or Southampton, at the beginning of the
century, and the story of the changes in ship-building and what has
happened in the dockyards is, of itself, a whole view of the
century's sea story.</p>

<p>In Portsmouth, when the century opened, the men of Anson's
squadron were just dying out, and the townsfolk were reading in the
papers (one paper, perhaps, between twenty or thirty customers of
the "George" or the "Blue Posts") obituary notices such as
these:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"On the 13th February 1804, at the age of 109,
George Gregory, the last of the <i>Centurion's</i> crew, died at
Kingston. He was pressed from the brig <i>Mary of North Shields</i>
when in the Downs, and he first went to sea in 1714. Lately, at
Portsmouth, Captain Hall, aged 91. He was a surgeon's mate of the
<i>Centurion</i>, and went round the world with Lord Anson in the
year 1740, when the Manilla galleon was taken. Mr Hall came home
surgeon of her. It was after this voyage, which lasted three years
and nine months, that Lord Anson, when he landed here on the Point,
fell upon his knees and offered an ejaculatory prayer to Him who
had preserved him from such imminent dangers. Captain Fortescue is
the only person living who went on that voyage."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 16</p>-->

<p>Penny a mile excursion trains now carry Manchester and
Birmingham operatives on holidays to view the sights of Portsmouth.
A hundred years ago there were things quite as wonderful for such
people to look upon, if they had then had the time and money, or
the audacity and extravagance, to journey such a distance
sight-seeing in a market-waggon or on a stage-coach.</p>

<p>If they had walked upon Southsea beach, for example, they might
have seen lying at Spithead as many ships as were assembled at the
last Jubilee Review. A couple of hundred sail waiting for convoy
was not unusual, and fifty King's ships, from the towering
three-decker to a little dispatch cutter, were much prettier sights
to look upon, and not a whit less imposing than a modern fleet.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 17</p>-->

<p>There were no pleasure piers for bands to play upon then, and no
steamboats calling at them, but there were hundreds of watermen's
wherries, bumboats, tailors' boats, Jew dealers' boats, and
men-o'-war cutters continually going to and fro the fleet off the
Motherbank. There were no fine monuments to sea and soldier heroes
along the sea front; the <i>Victory's</i> anchor was not esteemed
beyond its value in wood and iron, and so far from standing on an
ornamental pedestal for folks to gaze at, hung at the
<i>Victory's</i> bows or lay in Anchor Row, of no more account then
than was <i>The Ship</i> among the other first rates of His
Majesty's fleet.</p>

<p>Nelson, arriving at the George Inn in High Street about daybreak
on the 14th September 1805, ate his breakfast, then chancing to
look out of the window, saw an enormous crowd waiting for him in
the street below, so he slipped quietly out a back way in Penny
Street, and so made his way to Southsea Common, and there, from the
spot on which the <i>Victory's</i> anchor is now erected as a
monument, he embarked for Trafalgar. Thus wrote Southey at a time
(1813) when the Portsmouth crowd and Southsea beach and the George
Inn were as they were when Nelson knew them:&mdash; "A crowd
collected in his train, pressing forward to obtain sight of his
face; many were in tears, and many knelt before him and blessed him
as they passed...They pressed upon the parapet to gaze after him
when his barge pushed off, and he was returning their cheers by
waving his hat. The sentinels who endeavoured to prevent them from
trespassing upon this ground were wedged among the crowd, and an
officer, who not very prudently upon such an occasion ordered them
to drive the people down with their bayonets, was compelled
speedily to retreat; for the people would not be debarred from
gazing till the last moment upon the hero&mdash;the darling
hero&mdash;of England."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 18</p>-->

<p>On Southsea beach there were two monuments of a kind. Felton's
Gibbet still stood, a guide for little vessels making the harbour,
and upon the Gosport shore some ghastly remains of Jack the
Painter's body still swung in chains from the <i>Arethusa's</i>
mainmast, upon which curious gallows, many then living, had seen
the incendiary hanged for his attempt to burn the dockyard. The
Round Towers of the Blockhouses on either side the harbour were
then kept garrisoned, the men in them ready t. "heave taught from
towre to towre the mighty chain of Yron to block an enemy's
entrance," a means of defence put there first in Henry VIII.'s
time, and which remained, some parts of it, until almost the
present.</p>

<p>Cumberland Fort was just built, and Southsea Castle was being
put in order to resist the invader, and all over the town were
walls and ramparts, and gates, and moats, and drawbridges,
separating the civil town from the military one, and devised to
protect the yard, the gunwharf, the victualling office, and the
rest of the important Government establishments, so these things
remained until the seventies. The visitor, if he had taken an
interest in the townsfolk and had poked about among them during the
war period, would have found none but seafaring people, or persons
who lived honestly, or otherwise, by sailors. Jews, seamen, and
harlots crowded the streets, and talked of nothing but the French,
prize money, the press-gang, and the French prisoners.</p>

<p>Marryat has so well described it all, that the Logs and Point
and the Blue Posts are familiar to people all over the world.
Between the stories he tells and the stories in the local papers of
the time, I can find no difference. For instance, the Portsmouth
inns were notorious for their extortions, and a report in a local
paper about 1810 tells of a landlord who charged a gentleman a
guinea a day for the use of three rooms for himself and family, and
would not let them unless they were taken for a week certain. The
guest only wanted the rooms for a few hours until the coach for
London was ready. A captain in the navy hearing the discussion
between landlord and guest, asked leave to take over the rooms, and
this was agreed upon.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 19</p>-->

<p>"Now, landlord," says the captain, "I want all three rooms got
ready for me to-night."</p>

<p>"What, all three, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, haven't I paid for them?"</p>

<p>In the evening the gallant officer returned, bringing with him
his boatswain and two mates. These men were ordered to keep watch
and watch, and every half-hour to report the time, and every four
hours pipe the watch on deck, each man in his particular room.
After one night of this treatment the landlord returned the three
guineas.</p>

<p>True stories of press-gangs collected would of themselves make a
good-sized and very readable book. In 1803 an impress officer at
ten at night assembled a party of marines at Gosport, making as
much fuss as possible, and giving out that there was a serious riot
on the Fort Moncton side of Haslar Creek, marched his men over the
bridge. Thousands, of course, rushed across to see the fun, then
the officer drew up his men across the road and pressed every man
likely to be useful. Dozens were released next day on their
presenting proofs that they were apprentices or masters. I wonder
what an apprentice or a master would say now if he was taken off in
this fashion, and only released after spending the night in a
receiving-ship. Imagine the scene in Smock Alley or Bathing-House
Square when a press-gang appeared at the door of the "Jolly
Sailors" or the "Help the Lame Dog over the Stile," and took from
Pol and Bet and Sue their fancy men!</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 20</p>-->

<p>The history of Portsmouth Point would, if it were written, be
more than half the history of the navy. What embarkations and
debarkations have taken place there, and there have been other
sensations. Thirty or forty persons were blown to pieces there in
1809 by the explosion of several barrels of powder, belonging to
the stores of a regiment then about to embark. An old woman, a
soldier's wife, was smoking her pipe, and she knocked the ashes out
on the pebbles, when&mdash;puff! half Point was blown away. Fancy
handling ammunition in such fashion now; and what fights with the
press there were! The men surprised, half-drunk in some low tavern,
fought with their fists, with wooden benches, with pewter pots, the
women with mops and brooms and with their talons. These forces
combined disputed with the marines and seamen the way to the boats
inch by inch, while the little Jew rascal who, for a consideration,
had betrayed the sailors to the press, slunk off wuth his
blood-money and such trifles as, in the excitement, the combatants
had left on the floor of the pot-house.</p>

<p>Another of the sights of Portsmouth was the prizes lying in the
harbour. A picture of the time shows a whole fleet of them; and as
a companion to it there is a view of Southampton that makes of that
important seaport a tiny fishing village. And what is written of
Portsmouth applies equally well to Plymouth and our other royal
naval seaports. We could even then boast of big naval
establishments abroad, at Bermuda, at Malta, and at Halifax, for
instance; though that at Sydney, now one of the most important, had
not then been thought of. The breakwater at Plymouth was begun in
1812, and took half the century to finish, and they have been
adding to the other dockyards acres of basins, docks, and "works,"
until the dock walls now enclose a town.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 21</p>-->

<p>The French prisoners in the hulks and the temporary Government
prisons were not the least curious of the sights. The cost of their
keep in England ran to £1000 a day. In Porchester Castle there were
at one time as many as 5000, and at Forton and the hulks in
Portsmouth Harbour 13,000 more. These men frequently escaped, and
in a very remarkable manner; for example, in April 1808 eleven
Frenchmen cut a hole in the <i>Vigilant</i> hulk, swam to another
ship, and there secured a boat, clothed themselves in the
greatcoats of the boat's crew, then pulled to the master
attendant's tender, a fine little cutter worth £1000, and sailed
coolly out of Portsmouth Harbour, taking the cutter's anchor-watch
of three men with them to Cherbourg.</p>

<p>We did not treat the prisoners badly, though we were accused of
doing so, and a great deal of correspondence took place between the
French and English Governments on the subject. We had prisoners of
our own in France, and their stories of French prisons were not
calculated to allay the anti-French feeling in the seaports. Sir
Sydney Smith's treatment, and Captain Wright's death in the Temple
at Paris, and other stories of the kind, can be set off for
anything alleged against us. Our prisoners of war led an easy life
of it, carving toys out of the beef bones that they saved from
their rations, to sell to the children of the villages near their
prisons; and a generation ago you could meet any number of people
who had seen the Frenchmen doing this work and plaiting straw hats
from their straw beds in the rooms and grounds of Porchester
Castle. In 1810 there was a long correspondence over a proposed
exchange of prisoners, to which we would not agree, as the French
wanted to exchange 12,000 Englishmen for our 50,000 prisoners. We
would have even agreed to this, though many of their prisoners were
women and children detained in violation of the laws of nations,
but the French had a number of our Spanish allies in their prisons,
and we refused terms because the French would not release them.
Though from 1803 to 1815 the cost of maintaining French prisoners
to us was about six and a half million sterling, and only one and a
half per cent, of the 50,000 were sick, it has always been said in
France that we allowed prisoners to die of hunger and cold.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 22</p>-->

<p>There were naval as well as military volunteers when the fear of
Bonaparte's invasion was upon us, though the Sea Fencibles, as they
were called, were not thought any too highly of, to judge from
contemporary accounts of them; thus a writer in 1809:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The public benefit derived from the Sea Fencibles, a force
costing £200,000 a year, I have never been able to learn, as they
are enrolled only to serve in case of invasion. Their officers have
no command over them, and the amount of their present service is
only to muster once a week, for which each man receives one
shilling. According to the lists they are round the coasts of the
three kingdoms, and doing nothing, while their officers are paid
much more than are the officers of ships in commission."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 23</p>-->

<p>The great trading ports and their population have changed no
less than the royal seaports. There are columns of figures showing
the values of imports and exports, ships owned, and the rest of it,
but they look so dry and uninteresting, and can so easily be got
from books of reference, that I will not quote them. London was in
1800, as now, the first of our seaports, and Liverpool came next.
London did two-thirds of the whole trade of the kingdom, and there
were 2666 vessels owned in the port. Shortly, the three principal
ports, London, Liverpool, and Bristol, measured by their customs
duty, stood thus:&mdash;London, £5,000,000; Liverpool, £649,684;
Bristol, £334,909.</p>

<p>The docks of London, as we know them, have grown up entirely in
the present century. Fifty years ago you might have talked with men
who could remember when the landmarks of Blackwall Reach were grim
gibbet posts for the bodies of pirates. When the century opened
ships lay in the river, and discharged into lighters at Blackwall,
whence the goods were carried to rotting old wooden quays at London
Bridge. These were the times when river robbery was a thriving
trade, and fortunes were built on the proceeds of thievery. The
great seaports in the North were at the beginning of the century of
no more account than Falmouth is now, compared with their
present-day importance.</p>

<p>Generations of Government dockyard men have been born in the
great naval seaports, have served their apprenticeships, grown grey
in the service of the yards, retired on their pensions and died,
knowing no more of actual wartime, having no more real idea of what
a state of naval war means, than if they had been born, brought up,
and worked out their lives in the heart of the Australian bush.
When these men talked shop&mdash;of the refitting of this vessel,
the docking of that&mdash;they might, have been builders of market
waggons for all that their conversation had to do with naval glory.
You might have mingled with them any time these last fifty years
and have never heard mention of prizes, privateers, press-gangs,
prisoners of war&mdash;words that were in the mouths of everyone a
hundred years ago, and are still rightly to be found in ninety per
cent, of the naval books published now.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 24</p>-->

<p>They were building ships in the little English seaports early in
the century, launching fine frigates and sloops of war in places
that would to-day go wild with excitement if the local boat-builder
had a moderate-sized schooner on his slips. The supply of timber
was the one great question agitating the shipbuilding interest, and
the adjacency of suitable timber regulated the position of a
shipbuilding yard, just as that of coal and iron influence a
"works" now. But the situations of the King's yards at Portsmouth,
at Plymouth, and at Chatham, and at the other dockyards and naval
establishments, were, of course, chosen for strategic reasons, and
"our natural enemy" had decided these things for us long before the
beginning of the century.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 25</p>-->

<p>There is much to see, of course, at the Royal Yards at
Portsmouth or Plymouth now, and when a party of visitors is shown
round by a constable of the dockyard division of the metropolitan
police, a non-expert leaves the place, after walking over some
miles of ground, with a confused notion that he has seen more
machinery in an hour than he will ever be likely to see again in a
lifetime. Steam, hydraulics, and electricity leave him wondering
what they want with nine thousand men in Portsmouth Yard. In 1801
there were only four thousand shipwrights employed in all the
King's yards. The old dockyard was under the general
superintendence of a Commissioner, chosen from the captains of the
Royal Navy, who occupied a position similar to that of the present
Admiral Superintendent. The principal officers under him were the
Master Shipwright, two Master Attendants, a Clerk of the Check, a
Storekeeper, a Clerk of the Survey, a Clerk of the Rope Yard. The
Master Shipwright was the most important officer in the yard,
having four assistant master shipwrights under him, one of whom,
called the Timber Master, had charge of all stores of timber, and
directed what pieces should be used, and the order of their uses.
The Master Attendant and his assistant controlled the sail lofts
and rigging houses, and saw to the mooring and unmooring of ships,
and the moving of them about the harbour. The Clerk of the Check
kept the men's time, paid them, and did, or rather superintended
the clerks who did, the clerical work. He, too, with the aid of the
Clerk of the Survey and the Storekeeper, bought new stores and sold
condemned stores, jobbing as much as he could, which came easy and
was natural at the time to every one. The Clerk of the Rope House
was a very important person, having full charge of all the hemp,
tar, and similar materials used in the rope-walks, and having many
ropcmakers under him, as may be imagined in the days when wire
rigging was not thought of.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 26</p>-->

<p>Up to 1805 wages were paid only once a quarter, and it was the
end of the succeeding quarter before the calculations were
completed and payment made. Meanwhile, the men lived by obtaining
advances from people called "dealers," shop and tavern keepers, who
made the most of the credit they gave. The 1805 reform instituted
the payment of subsistence money, by which the dockyard matey, as
he was called, was allowed to draw from the Clerk of the Check from
three-fourths to seven-eighths of his week's earnings on the first
Saturday in each month.</p>

<p>These distinguished persons were paid salaries ranging from £650
to a Builder or a Clerk of the Check, or a Master Attendant, and
£500 to a Clerk of the Rope-walk, down to £100 a year to a common
clerk, whose business it was to add two and two together, and who
might have been Mr Dickens, the father of Charles Dickens, who, it
will be remembered, was a pay clerk in the yard at Portsmouth.</p>

<p>The workmen were divided into artificers and labourers; these
were shipwrights, sail-makers, ropemakers, joiners, mast-makers,
boat-builders, blacksmiths, riggers, and a dozen others whose
titles still remain, while their duties are as similar as those of
the driver of the fast express from Euston to Liverpool and the
driver of the Mail Coach <i>Red Rocket</i>.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 27</p>-->

<p>The wages of these workmen were practically the same as they
were in the reign of Queen Anne, and the hideous complications
involved in paying them, by job, by piece, by tides, by task, and
by a dozen other different methods, have defied the efforts of a
Cambridge mathematical scholar, whose aid I have sought, to explain
them. This much is clear, Scavelmen got 3d. a day in lieu of chips,
and I shall presently explain that chips were important. Scavelmen
were labourers who pumped out docks, and they were paid 3s. 6d. a
day when outside labour was only getting los. 6d. a week. A Board
appointed to economise, and, if possible, also put a stop to
swindling, could not understand why. The average earnings of a
shipwright were 7s. 6d. a day. From 6 A.M. till 6 P.M. in the
summer, and from daylight till dark in the winter, were the regular
working hours; but overtime, working on Sunday, during the dinner
half-hour, and at night, brought up their wages. A list of wages
published in 1806 shows that a working shipbuilder got 2s. 1d. a
day, a foreman or quarterman 2s. 2d., labourers is. 2d., pitch
heaters is. 6d., joiners 1s. 8d., oakum boys 8d. The quarterman was
a sort of ganger of shipwrights who delivered an account of works
into the office, where it was classed and priced, and it was in the
interest of the quarterman and of the clerks to increase the
general earnings of a gang, so that when all were friendly, and
things went smoothly, no one was short of a pound or two. Foremen
of different branches were allowed also to take apprentices,
two-thirds of whose pay went to the foreman, and one-third to the
parents of the apprentice, a perquisite then of considerable value.
The clerical work involved in the complicated system of payment
cost at Plymouth, in 1801, £1040 per annum, and the workmen's wages
for the same year amounted to £200,064.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 28</p>-->

<p>A visitor to Portsmouth to see the dockyard in 1801 would not
have had the difficulty in getting in that he would have now. No
policeman or sentry would trouble himself in the least about him.
There was an old one-legged porter in a lodge, whose only business
was to ring the bell morning and evening. The interior immediately
after entering has not much altered. Mast-houses and ponds, and
neat red brick buildings, residences of the senior officials, the
Commissioner's house, and the Royal Academy, now the Naval College,
all remain pretty much the same. But away to the left, where the
building slips ran down to the water, you could see the rows of
French prizes lying in the harbour, where now lie the hulks of
ships that were the pride of the navy fifty years ago.</p>

<p>Anchor Row was there, and they boasted of the great thirty
hundredweight anchors that were forged in the yard; on an old hulk
a visitor could any time in daylight see the ropemakers stretching
hempen cables, with the aid of these weighty anchors, forged in a
smithy, where there was a marvellous pair of bellows, so big that
the apparatus was worked by a windlass, which was driven by a man,
who, slung by the armpits, trod a treadmill, which in its turn
revolved the windlass! But this remarkable device was becoming
antiquated; people were thinking of steam. Brunei, the father of
another of that name to be heard of later, in 1804 introduced his
wonderful block-making machinery driven by steam. Fourteen
principal little machines did the work; five of these made the
shell, and nine the pin and sheave; the man put in some wood and
iron, and out came a block, and they have not beaten Brunei
senior's idea even at this end of the century.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 29</p>-->

<p>Another great sight in the yard was the rope-walk, 1100 ft.
long, 54 ft. wide, and three storeys high, where they spun hemp
into rope, right from making spun-yarn, to a 7-tons weight cable,
requiring eighty men to work the job, taking care ahvays to spin
into it the "rogues' yarn," that coloured heart-yarn that
distinguishes Government from private property in rope, and which
in those days merely served to guarantee the receiver of stolen
property that the rope offered was of the best make. Then, not to
mention the sail-lofts and rigging-houses, mast-ponds, mast-houses,
and the building-slips&mdash;the last-named much as they appear
to-day, except in the matter of what is building in
them&mdash;there was the copper foundry. It required 4000 sheets of
copper to cover the bottom of a ship of the line, and a ton weight
of nails to fasten it on. During the French war they worked up old
copper after recasting it; in one year making about 1200 tons of it
in this way.</p>

<p>In 1817 a Plymouth newspaper described an operation at the local
dockyard that at that time exceeded anything that had ever been
done before in the annals of shipbuilding. Without quoting the
rapturous language of the local scribe, this great achievement
shall be told in a few words. The <i>Kent</i>, an 80-gun ship, was
hauled up on a repairing slip. The job was, in truth, a big
operation, and the whole dockyard took a week working all day, and
by candle-light at night, to prepare for it. The <i>Kent</i>
weighed 1964 tons, and in forty minutes she was hauled high and dry
out of the water on to the slip. The means employed was a long pull
and a strong pull; 1400 men operated the power, and they worked
with fourteen capstans, thirty-two treblefold blocks, with tackle
of 7-, 8-, and 9-inch rope, eight 23-inch cables lashed to the ship
with selvegee strops of 1500 yarns each (no wonder Jasper, Mr W. S.
Gilbert's old sailor, was such a bore on the value of the
selvegee), and she was buoyed up at her after-end by four lighters.
Any number of anchors and chains to hold the standing parts of the
tackles were buried in the ground. Then all being ready, the
chronicler relates that the word was given, and, in the presence of
thousands of spectators, and cheered by bands of music and
inspiring shouts, the 1400 men hauled on the tackles, and hove on
the capstan bars, and the <i>Kent</i> began to move up the inclined
plane at the rate of 8 or 10 inches at a time, as the purchases
acted!</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 30</p>-->

<p>People no doubt remember the disaster in the Thames in June
1898, when the <i>Albion</i>, a first-class battleship of 12,950
tons, was launched by the Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding
Company. She was the largest man-o'-war ever built on the Thames,
and the Duchess of York touched the electric button that sent her
sliding down the ways. Everything had, apparently, passed off
happily, and cheers were being raised in celebration of the event,
when a staging which had been erected around a Japanese warship in
course of construction was swept away by the backwash raised by the
<i>Albion</i>. More than one hundred people were suddenly thrown
into the water, of whom thirty-five are known to have been drowned.
There was a curious parallel to this disaster in Septemiber 1825 at
Portsmouth, when the <i>Princess Charlotte</i>, of 110 guns, was
launched. Prince Leopold performing the ceremony. A great concourse
of spectators had gathered upon one of the 20-feet bridges crossing
one of the basins in the yard. The crowd caused the bridge to sway,
and the great disturbance of the water when the <i>Princess
Charlotte</i> slid down the ways completed the mischief, the bridge
gave way, and about twenty persons were drowned. This is the only
serious accident that is remembered in the Royal yards in many
years, notwithstanding that such wonderful operations as that
described in connection with the <i>Kent</i> were going on by no
means infrequently.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 31</p>-->

<p>As I have hinted, people in the King's yards were not
particularly honest in the beginning of the century. In the Court
of King's Bench, in July 1801, two partners in one of the largest
copper-working firms in London were found guilty of embezzling the
King's stores from Portsmouth. In the course of the evidence, it
was shown that the loss of Royal Naval stores by embezzlement
amounted to not less than £500,000 annually. An officer of the
dockyard discovered several casks filled with copper sheathing and
bolts marked with the broad arrow, publicly exposed for sale by
these "merchants," who were proved to have carried on a system of
thieving for years, by which the workmen of the yard carried out
the copper, and disposed of it to a local receiver, who in turn
sent it to London.</p>

<p>An old writer on the town of Portsmouth stated:&mdash;"The poor
people among us are chiefly supported by their labour in the
dockyard. These men are much eased in housekeeping by the beef and
pork they procure from the ships, and the firing they consequently
bring home with them once a day from the yard." This was the time
when every one employed in the public service had his perquisites:
for example, the shipwrights were entitled to take home
chips&mdash;it may be depended upon that they took care to make
plenty of them, and make them large enough for their domestic
fires.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 32</p>-->

<p>Mr Colquhoun, the Thames Police magistrate, attacked this state
of affairs. A hundred years ago he wrote:&mdash;"Many vessels in
the coasting trade, and even ships of foreign nations, are said to
touch at Portsmouth and Plymouth merely for the purpose of
purchasing cheap stores; and it is well known that many dealers in
naval stores in the neighbourhood of the dockyards are chiefly
supplied in this way. The system which prevails at present with
regard to the sale of old stores not only proves a kind of
safeguard to these fraudulent dealers, but it is also subject to
great abuses in the delivery of larger quantities not included in
the public sales, by which the parties perpetrating this species of
plunder are said to pocket considerable sums of money. The
artificers of the dockyards, availing themselves of their
perquisites of chips, not only commit great frauds through this
medium, by often cutting up useful timber, and wasting time in
doing so, but also in frequently concealing within their bundles of
chips, copper bolts, and other valuable articles which are removed
by their wives and children, and afterwards sold to itinerant Jews,
or to the dealers in old iron and stores, who are always to be
found in abundance wherever the dockyards are situated."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 33</p>-->

<p>Mr Colquhoun then goes on to estimate the cost to Government of
the chips perquisite, which, with the articles concealed in the
bundles, he calculated came to £140,000 a year. Give the men 6d.
per day extra instead of the chips, said Mr Colquhoun, and a saving
will be effected of £117,500 a year. And the Government took his
advice, first considering the subject for a decade. Another remark
of Mr Colquhoun's explains the "rogues yarn," reference to which I
made a few sentences back:&mdash; "Among the multitude of criminal
people who are concerned in it, some are said to keep men
constantly employed in untwisting cordage, for the purpose of
removing the King's mark or coloured strand which is introduced
into it as a check against fraud: while others are, in like manner,
employed in knocking the broad arrow out of copper bolts, nails,
bar-iron, and other articles on which it is impressed, so as to
elude detection."</p>

<p>It is but bare justice, however, to state that they turned out
good work in both the Government and private shipbuilding yards.
Ships, it is true, were sometimes reported bad before they were
clear of the riggers' hands, but this was owing to defective
planks, or badly pickled timber. Examples of sound work are still
afloat. Take the history of one or two ships as an
illustration.</p>

<p>The <i>St Vincent</i>, launched at Plymouth in 1815, was the
second of her name in the service, for a century before a ship
named after the saint was captured from the French. This second
<i>St Vincent</i>, long a flagship for the later years of her life,
did duty as a training ship for seamen boys at Portsmouth, but in
1899 the Admiralty thought she was too old to be healthy, and at
the time of writing a plan is under consideration for giving the
youngsters other quarters.</p>

<p>The <i>Foudroyant</i> was launched in 1798, and would have been
afloat now, but for an accident. It will be remembered that she was
sold a few years ago to a German firm of shipbrokers; bought back
again by an English syndicate who had the idea of exhibiting her at
all the English seaports; was caught in a gale when anchored off
Blackpool in June 1897; was driven ashore, and in the course of a
few weeks went to pieces.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 34</p>-->

<p>In private yards shipbuilding for the King was carried on much
more extensively than is generally known. For example, there were
afloat in 1800 sixteen King's ships which had been built in
Liverpool during the previous twenty years, the ships varying from
32- to 50-gun frigates. In 1813 a list of King's ships, building in
Government and in private yards, shows vessels on the stocks at
Deptford, Woolwich, Chatham, Portsmouth, Plymouth, and Milford
(King's yards), and on private slips at Dartmouth, Brighton,
Ipswich, Sandwich, Lynn, Bursledon, Southampton, Bridport, Shields,
Bideford, Rochester, Hythe, Redbridge, Topsham, and several others,
besides many yards on the Thames and Medway. On the Thames alone in
1814, twenty-two yards were in existence, with between them
forty-one building slips, but the peace threw most of them idle,
and only eighteen of the slips were occupied. In 1806, of merchant
ships alone, returns show the following figures:&mdash; Building on
contract, 50 vessels, equalling 8961 tons; on speculation, 124,
equalling 21,300 tons; and launched and for sale, 22, equalling
4725 tons. In the port of London alone, 77 ships, with a tonnage of
18,000, were for sale.</p>

<p>They were beginning to build ships in the Colonies, too. In
1814, at the request of the Admiralty, 150 shipwrights volunteered
from Plymouth Yard to go to the Lakes in Canada to build vessels.
They were to receive pay and allowances equal to about 13s. per
day. <i>The Sydney</i> (New South Wales) <i>Gazette</i> of April
17th, 1819, says:&mdash; "We had the pleasure, on the 7th of the
present month, to witness the launch of the new schooner, built at
His Majesty's dockyard at Sydney, by command of His Royal Highness
the Prince Regent, as a present for the King of the Sandwich
Islands, and named by His Excellency the Governor, <i>The Prince
Regent</i>. The novelty of the sight attracted a great number of
spectators, as well on shore as on the water; and the stately
manner in which she first saluted the retiring wave afforded great
satisfaction. She is a very fine vessel; her burthen 40 tons; and
will be despatched to the King of the Sandwich Islands as soon as
completely rigged and properly equipped for so long a voyage."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 35</p>-->

<p>But long before this time they had built capital little vessels
on the shores of Sydney Harbour. Convict shipwrights were
plentiful, and the art of stealing copper, as the records show, got
a new life in the young Colony; one prisoner's name has been handed
down to posterity for his skill in thieving copper bolts. In 1805
they refitted, in Sydney dockyard, Flinders's old surveying ship,
the <i>Investigator</i>, in such a fashion that she was navigated
to England after all the naval experts had condemned her as only
fit to be broken up. The little 29-ton <i>Cumberland</i>, in which
Flinders would have reached England if he had not been made
prisoner at the Mauritius by the French, and the <i>Francis</i>, a
schooner of 40 tons, which took part of the shipwrecked crew to
England, were both built in Sydney when the century was a year old.
Now, beside the great iron shipyards on the shores of Sydney
Harbour, you can still hear the caulkers' mallets, and see the
chips fly from the adzes of shipwrights working in little yards
where shipbuilding, as distinct from boiler-making, still goes on.
Pearling luggers are being launched for the South Seas, year in and
year out, and so late as 1899 I saw within six months a little
10-ton lugger laid down, built, launched, and rigged, and read of
her coming safely through a hurricane, which had battered and
half-wrecked more than one 4000-ton steamer, and which she had
weathered in waters a thousand miles away from her birthplace.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 36</p>-->

<p>India had long been building teak ships, men-of-war for the East
India Company, as well as merchantmen. In 1799 there arrived in the
Thames the <i>Scalby Castle</i>, of 1200 tons, built at Bombay by
Parsees, for John Company, and in March of the same year, a Parsee
shipowner launched from his own yard, in the same port, a vessel of
1400 tons. Down to 1848 they were building men-of-war for the
English Royal Navy in Bombay. Cursetjee Rustomjee, the Parsee head
builder of the Hon. Company's yard in Bombay, was a famous builder.
He entered the yard in 1800 as an apprentice to the shipwrights,
under his uncle Framjee, then master builder. He was made fourth
assistant in 1805, and was rapidly promoted, until in 1844 he
became head builder. In the course of that period, there had been
built at the yard 100 ships, large and small, for the Company, and
for the Crown 10 line of battle ships, 5 frigates, and 6 brigs,
besides 2 frigates and 5 sloops for the Sultan of Muscat, and any
number of merchant vessels for English and Indian shipowners.</p>

<p>The British working man has a deservedly high reputation all the
world over, but he will have to exert himself if he is to retain
his pride of place. In Bombay in the seventies I saw an old Scotch
shipwright rather astonished when he saw Parsees come on board a
ship and caulk her decks, just as well and quite as quickly as
Glasgow caulkers could have done the work. It was a year or two
after the first visit of the Shah of Persia to England, and the
Parsees in their Persian head-dress, long-pointed shoes, and clean
white garments, quite shocked the old ship-carpenter, who said they
were not shipwrights, but Persian noblemen; but the ring of their
mallets sounded true in his ears, and he was too honest a man not
to recognise that they knew their business.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 37</p>-->

<p>I have said that timber was the vexed question in the early part
of the century, for we were denuding our forests rapidly, and in a
state of war there was no telling how long we might successfully
import it. In Surrey, in one year, 15,000 trees were cut down, and
in the fifteen years ending 1808, the price of oak had risen from
is. 6d. to 2s. 6d and 3s. a foot. To find timber, they had taken to
building from the forests at the foot of the Grampians. The trees
were floated by means of sluices and dams to sawmills on the banks
of a rivulet (the Drue), thence to the river Spey, where the logs
were made up in rafts of about 15,000 logs, and sold in the English
market. Mr W. Osbourne of Hull, who had for £10,000 bought the
right to cut timber on the Duke of Gordon's forest estates,
converted his privilege into ships, varying from 130 to 600 tons,
and by the year 1802 this shipbuilder had turned out some fifty
vessels. The timber was Highland pine, and every ship built from it
proved a great success.</p>

<p>The cost of building by contract, in 1805, a 74-gun ship was
about £36 a ton, just three times what it was a century earlier,
and about half what it is to build the corresponding class of
up-to-date steel battleship. Some tenders were received in 1804 for
building a seventy-four at £25 per ton, but this was unusually low.
The average time occupied in building such a vessel was three and a
half years.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 38</p>-->

<p>Without discussing technicalities any further, there is some
interest in noticing that in 1804 they launched a royal yacht for
King George, called the <i>Royal Sovereign</i>, "with every modern
improvement, ship-rigged, and handsomely furnished," just as at the
end of the century they have launched a new royal yacht for Queen
Victoria. Sliding keels or centre-board vessels, the invention of
Captain Schanck, were creating a mild sensation. Lieutenant Grant
sailed to survey the Australian coast in the <i>Lady Nelson</i>, a
little brig of 60 tons, fitted with the new idea.</p>

<p>Modern sailors think they see something comparatively original
in the four-masted and five-masted sailing-ships, but in 1799
Richard Hall Gower, of the East India Company, exhibited in London
a model of a five-master. The vessel was launched in May of the
following year at Itchenor, in Sussex, but after a trial trip her
fifth mast was taken out. She was soon after taken up by
Government, and appears on the official list of the time as the
"<i>Transit</i>, four-masted advice boat."</p>

<p>One George Matthews, in 1804, wrote from Wales to the <i>Naval
Chronicle</i>, suggesting plans for building four-, five-, and
six-masted ships, and with his letter enclosed a picture of a
five-masted square-rigged ship on the principle of a modern
double-ended screw ferry steamer. Mr Matthews explains that he is
not a sailor, but he thinks his idea could be carried out. The
picture he sent saved the necessity of the explanation.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 39</p>-->

<p>But a four-masted square-rigged ship was afloat a hundred years
ago, and between her and the present-day four-masted cargo tank,
the comparison is all in favour of the former, although the 1801
ship was built by Frenchmen at Bordeaux. The <i>Naval Chronicle</i>
gives a picture of her in 1804, accompanied by this
description:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"This is an accurate representation of
<i>L'Invention</i>, captured by the <i>Inimortalite</i>, Captain
Hotham, off Cape Ortigal, on 27th July 1801. She belonged to
Bordeaux, carried 24 long six-pounders, 2 twelve-pounders, and 220
men...Independent of her being as fine a ship of her class as ever
was seen for war, she is a great curiosity, being fitted with four
masts, at nearly equal distances from each other. The first
mainmast, taken from forward, is the largest, the foremast and the
second mainmast are nearly of a height, and the mizzen-mast is the
shortest of the whole: she has four top-gallant yards, rigged
aloft, is a great length, having thirteen ports on each side on a
flush deck, and carries her guns very high from the water; she is a
well-equipped ship, and her outfit as a privateer must have been
very expensive, as she is finished in a style superior to ships of
her description; she had been launched only three weeks, was on her
first cruise, had been eight days at sea, and made no
captures."</p>

<p>All over the world, in every seaport, can be seen some remains
of ships built in the small English shipyards during the first half
of the century. Good, honest work was put into them, as the hulks
of these ships afloat to-day prove. But, sometimes, owing to the
custom of perpetuating names and the confusion arising therefrom, a
belief in the age of our old wooden walls is carried a little too
far. For example: lying off Hobart is a red-painted powder-hulk
belonging to the Tasmanian Government. On her bows she is named the
Aladdin, under her stern is painted <i>Mutine</i>. On August 1st,
1898, the Tasmanian Government decorated her with flags from stem
to stern because it was the centenary of the battle of the Nile,
and the brig <i>La Mutine</i> brought the first news of the great
victory to Naples. To prevent confusion let us call this carrier of
Nelson's despatches <i>Mutine</i> No. 1.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 40</p>-->

<p>She was formerly <i>La Mutine</i>, a French war brig which had
been cut out by Hardy (Nelson's Hardy) from Santa Cruz in 1797, and
Hardy, then a lieutenant, was given the command of her. In 1803
orders were given for <i>Mutine</i> No. 1 to be sold out of the
service, and she was purchased in 1807 by Mr David Beatson of
Rotherhithe. In 1846 a Mr M'Arthur of Hobart-Town, who was largely
interested in whaling, went to England and bought from a well-known
London shipowner named Bennett a vessel called the <i>Aladdin</i>,
which the purchaser was assured was the very same <i>Mutine</i>
that had carried the Nile despatches. Every one in Tasmania has
ever since believed this yarn, as is very natural, unless one has
that special knowledge only to be acquired by much study of musty
papers and uninteresting books. The Tasmanian Government does not
seem to have pursued this study, and so they decorated their
powder-hulk, as I have said, and gaily dressed her with flags on
the Nile anniversary. But the truth is, <i>Mutine</i> No. 1 sold
out of the service; <i>Mutine</i> No. 2, a brig-rigged sloop of
war, was built at Bideford by Tucker in 1806, and duly
commissioned, and was at the bombardment of Algiers&mdash;then, in
1825, she was condemned and sold out of the service; and
<i>Mutine</i> No. 3 was built at Plymouth Dockyard as a brig of war
in February 1842, she was condemned and sold to Bennett, the London
shipowner, who registered her as the <i>Aladdin</i>, and sold her
to Mr M'Arthur, her registration being transferred to Hobart in
February 1847, and this is the powder-hulk now lying in the
Derwent.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 41</p>-->

<p>The name has been perpetuated in the service. <i>Mutine</i> No.
4, one of certain famous experimental brigs, was launched at
Chatham in 1844, and she was lost four years later; <i>Mutine</i>
No. 5, a steam sloop of the sixties, took her place, and, by 1870,
was sold, to be replaced by <i>Mutine</i> No. 6, built at Devonport
in 1879, and until recently a harbour service vessel in Southampton
waters; and <i>Mutine</i> No. 7, an up-to-date triple expansion
steel sloop of war, has just been built.</p>

<p>This link-connecting is a fascinating pursuit, but not always
interesting, though the story of the seven <i>Mutines</i> is here
told as showing the danger of growing sentimental over the name of
a ship without making sure of her identity; but though
<i>Mutine</i> No. 3, still afloat, is not <i>the Mutine</i>, to the
everlasting honour of Plymouth shipwrights, she, though launched 75
years ago, remains a staunch hulk, a living testimony to the
honesty of the West Country dockyardmen.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III. OFFICERS AND
SEAMEN.</h2>

<h3>The Royal Navy and the Merchant Service&mdash;The
Press-Gang&mdash;Types of Seamen&mdash;Women Sailors.</h3>

<p>Yarns of the cockpit are familiar enough to readers of Marryat
and Michael Scott; there is more truth in their fiction than in
most history. Here, done in verse in 1804, and if published since,
very rarely, is a "complaint" which, as a description of a
youngster's life in the service, will stand good for any period to
the sixties, and perhaps is not very far out even at the present
time:&mdash;</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 43</p>-->

<p>A MIDSHIPMAN'S COMPLAINT.</p>

<p>When in the cockpit all was grim,<br>
And not a mid. dared show his glim,<br>
A youth was all alone;<br>
He scratched his sconce, surveyed his clothes.<br>
Then took the other cheering dose,<br>
And thus began his moan:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A curse light on that fatal day.<br>
When I from home was led astray.<br>
In this dire hole to dwell;<br>
If I had in my country staid,<br>
I then had learnt some useful trade,<br>
And scorned the white lappel.</p>

<p>"When first on board the ship I went,<br>
With belly full I was content,<br>
No sorrow touched my heart;<br>
I view'd my coat, so flash and new,<br>
My gay cockade and hanger, too,<br>
And thought me wond'rous smart.</p>

<p>"But soon, too soon, my cash was spent.<br>
My hanger pawn'd, my coat was rent.<br>
My former friends I missed;<br>
And when of hardship I complain.<br>
My messmates swear 'tis all in vain.<br>
And ask what made me, list?</p>

<p>"Shiv'ring I walk the quarter-deck.<br>
And dread the stern lieutenant's check,<br>
Who struts the weather side;<br>
With glass and trumpet in his hand.<br>
He bellows forth his harsh command<br>
With arrogance and pride.</p>

<p>"But hark! I hear the caitiff tread;<br>
Another dose and then to bed,<br>
Of ev'ry joy bereft."<br>
He shakes his bottle with a flout.<br>
The poor half-pint was quite strain'd out,<br>
Not one kind drop was left.</p>

<p>The youth with rage indignant burns,<br>
Into his hated hammock turns,<br>
Alas! not long to sleep;<br>
The quartermaster, with hoarse tongue.<br>
Shakes him, and says the bell has rung;<br>
He's roused the watch to keep.</p>

<p>Rising, he cries, "Tip us a light.<br>
Old Square-toes, here, how goes the night?"<br>
"Why, sir, it rains and blows;"<br>
"O, damn my eyes, I hear the rout!<br>
D'ye spy a stray great-coat about?"<br>
Then, swearing, up he goes.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 44</p>-->

<p>Some letters written in 1818 show how little of exaggeration
there was in Marryat's most eccentric character sketches. The
writer of the letters is a naval officer, and he is supposed to be
addressing a youngster on his first voyage. "I am sorry," writes
the naval officer, "the ship's schoolmaster is not the kind of man
you can derive any knowledge from, but don't play pranks on him;
how can his greasy coat, high cheek bones, and slouched hat affect
you?" The modern chaplain and naval instructor would be justly
indignant if such an insinuation appeared in print now-a-days about
him. But the modern cadet is not expected to be able to set his
superiors right on the matter of taking a lunar, as this youngster
is encouraged to do. "Your attention to the different methods of
working the lunar observations, I hope, is strict and regular.
Never for one moment allow yourself to think that because perhaps
not more than one or two officers on board your ship are conversant
with them that they are of little real service; a few months will
convince you how impossible it is to ascertain correctly the
situation of the ship without their assistance, particularly when
she is not making a direct course, but cruising, as is often the
case, in one given latitude and longitude, for weeks together,
without seeing the land; and I hope to see the time when no
midshipman shall be allowed to pass his examination for a
lieutenant unless he fully understands them."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 45</p>-->

<p>The knowledge of seamanship is still well kept up, but I doubt
very much if there could be found many lieutenants to-day handy at
splicing a cable, as is required by this injunction:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are, I have no doubt, by this time fully acquainted not
only with the names, but the use and direction of every rope in the
ship; and have long since, to use the seaman's term, 'paid your
footing' in each top; for it is in the tops, and on the mast-heads,
that you must qualify yourself thoroughly to understand the duties
of a working seaman: a knowledge absolutely necessary to make
yourself respectable as an officer in their eyes. You may be a good
disciplinarian, a good navigator in every bearing of the word, know
how to rig and work your ship upon scientific principles, and to
fight her to the best advantage, for these are the peculiar duties
of an officer; still, unless the seaman thinks that you are equally
well acquainted with his minor duties, that in a case of emergency
you could take his place on the yard, or assist him in knotting a
shroud, or splicing a cable, he would be apt to think lightly of
your other qualifications, valuable as they really are, because he
finds you deficient in those which come more immediately within the
sphere of his own comprehension."</p>

<p>The pay and prospects of youngsters entering the service in 1801
stood thus:&mdash;By the rules they were compelled to serve three
years before they were entitled to the pay of an able seaman, and
they must have been four years in the service before they could be
rated as midshipmen, when, if of the highest grade, viz., serving
on a flagship, the pay was something less than £30 a year, and
mighty lucky was the young man who after four or five years'
service had friends enough to find a vacancy for him. A midshipman
was compelled to serve six years before he was given a lieutenant's
commission, and more often served twelve years, when he was paid
4s. 6d. a day; a post-captain was paid 8s. a day; a colonel of a
land regiment, 24s.; a rear-admiral received when on actual
service, 17s. 6d.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 46</p>-->

<p>The whole system of wages was so devised that military officers
materially increased their pay by perquisites; naval officers
invariably reduced theirs by penalties imposed upon them by
mistakes in the book-keeping of ships' clerks. For example, it was
said by an authority that the real emoluments rising from the
command of a regiment were underestimated at £1000 a year. In case
a captain of a man-o'-war neglected to send every two months a
complete muster book of his ship to the Navy Office, the penalty
was the forfeiture of his whole wages for the period, trial by
court-martial, and dismissal from the service! Mistakes were
punished in this way&mdash;not only wilful errors, but involuntary
mistakes!</p>

<p>I am afraid, from the court-martial reports in the first quarter
of the century, that drunkenness was rather common with naval
officers. Reports of it are very frequent, and a naval officer
writing just after the conclusion of the war gives some very sad
instances of youngsters sent to sea with drunken captains and
lieutenants, whose careers were ruined by the vices they learned
from their superiors. Here is the description of a captain of a
man-o'-war written in 1818:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Unfortunately for himself, the career of young B&mdash;&mdash;
was destined to commence in a small vessel, commanded by a man who
had risen from the lowest offices in the ship to his present rank
by perseverance alone, unassisted by talent, enterprise, or
knowledge of his profession, beyond that which constitutes the mere
able seaman. Educated in a merchant ship, and impressed into the
service, his knowledge of the hold gave him his first step to the
quarter-deck; length of servitude made him a lieutenant, and the
same recommendation, at the age of sixty, a commander.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 47</p>-->

<p>"Such was a merchant seaman raised to the command of a
man-o'-war; and such, or nearly such, are too many of those who,
suddenly raised, they scarcely know how, above the heads of their
former associates, become a pest both to them and to the officers
into whose society they are transplanted. Among those who have
obtained the higher ranks of the service are certainly some rare
exceptions to this censure, but they exist in the persons of men
whose talents and enterprise would have distinguished them in any
situation; and who have likewise thought it necessary to assume the
manners of a gentleman with the rank of an officer."</p>

<p>I hope that this extract makes it clear that this kind of
officer was the exception rather than the rule, as were young
B&mdash;&mdash;'s messmates thus described:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A master's mate, who had been second mate of a West India
trader, but was impressed in a drunken excursion on shore; and
after some time, from his knowledge of stowing the hold, elevated
to the quarter-deck; a clerk, who was seldom sober after his twelve
o'clock dinner, and two ragged youths who filled the situation of
midshipmen."</p>

<p>After three years' service in this vessel, during which his
character was formed in such fashion as utterly ruined him, the
subject of these extracts was appointed to another ship "commanded
by a man who combined, in every respect, the officer and the
gentleman; polished in his manners, yet not without that free and
open carriage for which our naval officers are in general
distinguished, and at the same time thoroughly conversant in
everything which regarded his profession."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 48</p>-->

<p>But the young man was too far gone, and he was soon after
dismissed with disgrace, and was lost among the dregs of the
population of some seaport town.</p>

<p>One of the current popular ideas about the naval officer of
Nelson's time is that he entered the service very frequently
through the hawsepipe, and that Smollett's caricature of a captain
in the navy held good as a type until a comparatively recent
period. Marryat, though, draws an altogether different picture, and
however much he might exaggerate, for the fun of the thing, the
eccentricities of his types, his knowledge of the service would not
permit him to put lower-deck seamen on quarter-decks as
commissioned officers, and Marryat's naval officers were the
officers of his time, just as Smollett's pictures are types of a
century earlier.</p>

<p>In the old navy, flag-officers and post-captains were allowed to
enter upon the ship's books a certain number of boys as "servants,"
but who were really "followers" in that sense in which the word was
used not many generations earlier, when knights went to sea with
their men-at-arms and other "followers." An officer in command
(with modifications), until quite recent times, could take with him
to sea his sons or his nephews, or his poor relations' sons, where
they could learn their business, and in due course become mates,
and lieutenants, having served their apprenticeship much as they
would have done in a merchantman if they had been bound to the
master instead of to the owner. They could not enter these boys on
the ships' books in any of the ordinary ratings, so it became
convenient to put them down as "servants." The system was reformed
in 1794, but it was many years later before it was entirely done
away with.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 49</p>-->

<p>Entering the Royal Navy as a "follower" of some naval commander
was not the only way to a commission. The Admiralty had provided a
legitimate school for breeding officers in the Royal Academy at
Portsmouth Dockyard. By the rules of the Academy, sons of noblemen
and gentlemen from twelve years to fifteen years of age, and sons
of commissioned officers of the fleet from eleven years, were
eligible. The headmaster of the Academy was to receive £25 per
annum for each boy, and was in return for this sum to find all
those things usually supplied at boarding-schools. The instruction
was in writing, arithmetic, drawing, navigation, fortification,
French, dancing, fencing, and the firelock exercise. Besides these
subjects the master-shipwright and boatswain of the yard gave the
boys lessons in seamanship, and they went out for occasional trips
in the commissioner of the yard's sailing tender. After three years
at the Academy the boys were given berths in sea-going ships as
vacancies occurred, and were rated as "Volunteers by order,"
receiving able seamen's pay, and quarters in the midshipmen's
berth. Volunteers educated at the Academy were qualified in point
of time to serve as lieutenants after six years' service, counting
sea-time and school-time, provided two years of that service had
been as a mate or a midshipman in a sea-going ship, and they were
not under twenty years of age. The Admiralty gave special
privileges to, and paid the fees for, sons of poor officers in the
navy.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 50</p>-->

<p>In a first rate, such as the <i>Victory</i>, the whole ship's
complement would amount to from 900 to 1000 persons, of whom about
30 were officers. These would be the captain, commander, and seven
lieutenants, holding commissions, and then, in order of precedence,
would come the "appointed" and "warrant" officers thus:&mdash;
master, chaplain, surgeon, purser, naval instructor, eight mates,
second master, three assistant surgeons, gunner, boatswain, and
carpenter.</p>

<p>The system of dividing the officers into "commissioned,"
"appointed," and "warrant" officers remained until late in the
century. Admirals, captains, and lieutenants were the only officers
holding commissions, all other ranks were either appointed or
warrant officers. To-day all but the gunner, boatswain, and
carpenter, who are warrant officers, hold commissions. The masters
used to be the highest grade of the warrant branch, they being
specially appointed by the Trinity House as competent to take
charge of the navigation and pilotage of ships, and it was in this
branch of the profession that men <i>did</i> occasionally rise from
the lower deck, or more often from the position of merchant service
officers to the distinction of a commission. Captain Cook is an
illustrious example, and Bligh, of <i>Bounty</i> mutiny fame, who
died a Vice-Admiral in 1817, another.</p>

<p>In the old line of battle ships, the youngsters were called
quarter-deck petty officers, and there would be about twenty-four
of them on board, including midshipmen, master's assistants, and
the purser's clerks. First-class volunteers were young gentlemen
who had entered to qualify for commissions, and second-class
volunteers those who had entered to qualify for officers of the
masters, or civil branches. All these distinctions have now so
entirely disappeared, that in the smaller ships of the present day
there is no separate mess for the wardroom and the gunroom, and you
will find the pay master's clerk dining at the same table with the
first lieutenant.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 51</p>-->

<p>In the old ship there would be about forty inferior petty
officers corresponding to non-commissioned officers in « the army.
The various grades of these petty officers were bewildering in the
number of them. There were admirals' coxswains, captains'
coxswains, captains of the tops, captains of the forecastle, yeomen
of signals, gunners, boatswains, and carpenters' mates, and any
number of others. With the disappearance of sails and rigging, all
these distinctions have gone, and there are now chief, second, and
third-class petty officers, any of whom may be doing duty as
boatswains' mates in one ship, and as gunners' mates in the next;
they are in fact sergeants, corporals, and lance-corporals. Besides
petty officers, the old line of battle ship's complement was made
up of about 500 or 600 seamen, and 60 or 70 seamen boys, 150
marines, with a marine captain and two subalterns.</p>

<p>Officers of the Mercantile Marine, the East India Company's
Service excepted, were apprentice boys, and seamen who had been
taught the three R's in their youth&mdash;a by no means common
degree of learning in their walk of life then&mdash;and who by
industry and sobriety, through the interest of friends, were
appointed mates, and so became masters of vessels. There were no
Board of Trade examinations, and the knowledge these men had of
navigation was very limited. Dead reckoning, the log, chart, and
the compass, were, as a rule, the sum of their knowledge.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 52</p>-->

<p>For example, eighty years ago it was solemnly discussed in a
newspaper correspondence whether a h'eutenant of a man-o'-war could
take a vessel from the Downs to Spithead without a pilot, and
admitted by both parties to the discussion that a navigating
officer, <i>i.e.</i>, a master of a King's ship, could certainly be
more safely entrusted with this great responsibility than masters
of merchant vessels or fighting officers of the Royal Navy.</p>

<p>The East India Company's officers were probably the best class
of sea-going officers then afloat. The Company's ships carried
cargoes too valuable for them to be entrusted to ignorant or
drunken commanders and watch keepers, and they sailed in seas that
required men of nautical science and seamanlike quality to navigate
safely. It was a fighting as well as a carrying service, but it was
governed commercially more than politically, so that its ships
could not afford to carry one set of officers to navigate and
another to fight. So efficient was its system in this respect, that
its regulations for the promotion of mates from cadets up to
commanders, compelling men to serve stated periods in each rank, in
order to gain promotion to a higher, dating from 1793, exact no
less from Company's officers than is exacted from merchant service
officers by the Board of Trade to-day. But though technically
classed as Mercantile Marine, service in the Company's armed
cruisers was very different to employment in merchant
ships&mdash;was, in fact, a branch of the sea life for which there
is now-a-days no equivalent. The officers were a superior class of
men, and the crews were regularly drilled and well-disciplined.
Service in the Company was a career for a youngster, from a social
point of view, only a very little below service in the Royal Navy,
while the emoluments of a sea captain of the Hon. East India
Company amounted, with the perquisites of an average voyage, to
more in one year than the captain of a man-o'-vvar often earned in
a lifetime. And as to the dignity of the rank, when a vessel
arrived at her port in India, she was received with a salute of
thirteen guns, and the guards at a fort turned out and presented
arms to her commander.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 53</p>-->

<p>The routine of sea duties of naval officers was very much as it
is now, excepting, of course, that great difference brought about
by the almost total disappearance of sails. Mates, a rank
corresponding to the present sub-lieutenant, and midshipmen were
divided into watches subordinate to the lieutenants in charge. Then
there was a mate under the master in charge of the hold, and
another under the first lieutenant who was all day on duty, and
whose business it was to superintend the cleaning of the decks and
look after the berthing of the crew. The midshipmen under the mates
and lieutenants kept division books, saw that the men of their
sub-divisions had their hammocks marked and stowed properly, and
that their clothes were in good order. Their boat and signal duties
are well known to every reader of nautical novels, and we know how
in war time a smart youngster often obtained an independent command
when his ship had the good fortune to fall in with more prizes than
there were lieutenants and mates available for the command of
them.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 54</p>-->

<p>The first lieutenant, when he joined his ship, allotted the men
their separate stations, dividing them into two or three watches
for sea duty, and four watches for harbour duty. The men were also
divided into as many divisions as there were commissioned officers
in the ship. The several stations were laid down upon watch-bills,
quarter-bills, station-bills, and a fire-bill, and every one was
expected, from these documents, which were hung in some conspicuous
place, to know his station. The first lieutenant kept no watch, but
having a general supervision over every department of the ship, was
busy enough all day to justify his sleeping in all night, provided,
of course, all hands were not called. The first thing a first
lieutenant did when he came on deck in the early morning was to
make sail. Men-o'-war always used to shorten sail at sunset, a
custom that many old-fashioned merchant skippers followed till
quite recent times. A lieutenant in charge of a watch now paces the
bridge, one eye on the compass, the other on the look-out for
vessels; almost his whole duty as a watch-keeper is comprised in
watching the steering and keeping clear of collision. This, of
course, becomes complicated when manoeuvring in a fleet, or keeping
station under the eye of an admiral at night, or in thick weather,
but in mail steamers or in war vessels going straight from port to
port, it should be comparatively easy, except, perhaps, in a fog in
the English Channel, when it is as much of a science as cab-driving
in Fleet Street in a November fog. But in the old sailing ship,
with 7000 yards of canvas to keep full, or the chance of a sudden
squall coming upon him unawares, which might take the three
top-gallant masts out of the ship, leaving a hideous mass of
wrecked spars, torn canvas, and tangle of rigging to bear witness
to his slackness, the lieutenant of the watch had indeed to keep
his weather eye lifting.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 55</p>-->

<p>The master of the ship was the pilot and navigator, as he had
been from ancient times, but gradually his importance fell away as
the commissioned officers grew more scientific. The Naval Academy
by the beginning of the century was bearing fruit, and soon it
began to be understood that the captain and lieutenants had joint
responsibility with the master for the navigation of the ship,
though charts, log, lead, and even canvas, rope, and spars were in
the special charge of the master assisted by the boatswain until
long after the service had grown familiar with steam.</p>

<p>In the civil departments of the ship at the beginning of the
century, the chaplain, surgeon, and purser may be said to rank with
the same class of men on shore, but were inferior to them, and
vastly inferior to men of the same rank now. Engineers were not
officers, but were only of warrant rank until after the Crimean
War, and pursers who are now paymasters, were always hucksters and
very often rogues&mdash;there is more than one instance of them
being stood in the pillory. The surgeons did not materially differ
from the surgeons of Smollett's time, and the chaplains more often
distinguished themselves by their courage in battle than by their
piety and good example in the daily life of the ship.</p>

<p>Of the chaplain, by the way, there are certain verses&mdash;"The
Chaplain's Petition"&mdash;to be found in the Annual Register for
1758, reprinted in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> in 1796, and
again in the <i>Naval Chronicle</i> in 1817, of which I can only
quote one verse. These verses were a petition from the chaplain to
be permitted certain privileges of the wardroom from which he had
been excluded, and which it appears from this verse the cobbler was
granted:&mdash;</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 56</p>-->

<p>"Ah! what avails it that in days of yore,<br>
The instructive lashes of the birch I bore,<br>
For four long years with logic stuffed my head,<br>
And feeding thought, went supperless to bed;<br>
That last enrolled in Alma's graduate band,<br>
I felt the hallowing load of Hoadly's hand,<br>
Since you with whom my lot afloat is thrown,<br>
(O sense! O elegance! to land unknown!)<br>
Superior reverence to the man refuse,<br>
Who mends your morals, than who mends your shoes."</p>

<p>The indifference of England to the seamen who fought her battles
was shameful, but officers fared no better, unless the monuments to
flag officers, erected after their death, is to be taken as a
set-off for the heroic service of all ranks. Soon after the peace,
hundreds of naval lieutenants&mdash;whose brilliant records of
services would, nowadays, judged by the way we honour public
service, have earned them peerages, Victoria Crosses, and good
incomes&mdash;were literally left to starve. Mighty lucky was the
man who could get the command of a mail packet or a signal station
when he was put on half pay. I have before me the recorded services
of a lieutenant who was fortunate. This was how he spent his life,
and this is how his country rewarded him. Lieutenant Blank entered
the service as midshipman and A.B. in 1793, and served in the
Channel, North Sea, Ireland, and Jamaica to 1802, when he was
promoted lieutenant. From 1802 till 1811 he was continually afloat,
serving in the West Indies, Mediterranean and English waters. Then
he was given the charge of a signal station at a wage of 8s. a day
and "find himself." His service altogether amounted to twentyone
years and four months, eighteen of those years spent at sea, the
remainder on half pay and at the signal station. During this time
he was in action about eight times, and was wounded on five
occasions. From 1814 to his death he was on the half pay of a
commander, and thought himself very well treated in getting 8s. 6d.
a day for the remainder of his life when there were any number of
equally deserving officers who had served fifty years in the
service thankful for less.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 57</p>-->

<p>The manning of the navy at the beginning of the century is
summed up in one word, "Impressment." I think most of us are
accustomed to associate the idea of the press-gang with Midshipman
Easy and Peter Simple times, but orders to impress are still in
existence from at any rate the thirteenth century, and between
these King's mandates for impressing ships and men, as given in Sir
Nicholas Harris Nicholas's <i>History of the Royal Navy</i>, and an
Admiralty warrant of impressment I have now before me, there is
very little difference. The warrant, after the usual formal
preliminaries, sets forth that:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"We do hereby Impower and Direct you to
impress or cause to be impressed so many Seafaring Men and Persons
whose Occupations and Callings are to work upon Vessels and Boats
upon Rivers as shall be necessary either to Man His Majesty's
Ships, giving unto each Man so impressed One Shilling for Prest
Money. And in the execution hereof you are to take care that
neither yourself nor any Officer authorised by you do demand or
receive any Money, Gratuition, Reward, or other Consideration
whatsoever for the Sparing, Exchanging or Discharging any Person or
Persons impressed or to be impressed, as you will answer it at your
Peril. You are not to entrust any Person with the execution of this
Warrant but a Commission Officer and to insert his Name on the
other side hereof and set your Hand and Seal thereto. This Warrant
to continue in force till the Thirty-First Day of December 1810,
and in the due execution thereof all Mayors, Sheriffs, Justices of
the Peace, Bailiffs, Constables, Head-boroughs and all other His
Majesty's Officers and subjects whom it may concern are hereby
required to be aiding and assisting unto you, and those employed by
you as they tender His Majesty's Service, and will answer the
contrary' with their Peril."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 58</p>-->

<p>This is addressed to the captain of a frigate at Spithead, and
is duly signed and counter-signed by the officials of the
Admiralty. At the back of the document half-a-dozen lines of type
set forth that:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do hereby depute Lieutenant &mdash;&mdash; under my command
to impress seamen," etc., etc., and this is signed by the captain
of the frigate.</p>

<p>This particular warrant is dated December 24th, 1809. Picture
what sort of Christmas this meant for some Portsmouth families.
Does it not make very real that song of Marryat's which Mistress
Nancy Corbett of Portsmouth Hard sings:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who ever heard in the sarvice of a frigate made to sail<br>
On Christmas Day, it blowing hard with sleet and snow and hail?<br>
I wish I had the fishing of your back that is so bent,<br>
I'd use the galley poker hot unto your heart's content.<br>
<br>
"You've got a roaring fire, I'll bet.<br>
In it your toes are jammed,<br>
Let's give him a piece of our mind, my Bet,<br>
Port Admiral, you be d&mdash;&mdash;d!"</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 59</p>-->

<p>The personal experience of Mr Thomas Urquhart, an ex-master of a
West Indiaman, as told by himself in a pamphlet that attracted
considerable notice when it was published in London in 1816, gives
an idea of the manner in which these impressment warrants were
sometimes executed. Says Mr Urquhart:</p>

<p>"I shall mention a circumstance which occurred to myself. While
walking in a street in the east of London in the year 1808, in the
month of July, about nine o'clock in the evening, with my wife
holding by one of my arms, and her sister by the other, I was
stopped by a man who demanded who I was, on which I desired to be
informed by what authority he dared to ask me that question. I had
hardly uttered the words, when I was brutally seized by him and two
or three more. My wife received a violent blow on the breast, which
compelled her to quit her hold, and laid her up for many
weeks."</p>

<p>Mr Urquhart was rescued from the gang by the bystanders, and
appealed to the law, but was told that his remedy, if he thought
himself ill-treated, was against the impress officer in a civil
action. So he went to law and got a verdict for £50, which did not
pay even a small proportion of his doctor's bill. Urquhart issued
his pamphlet in the form of a letter to Wilberforce, and winds up
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Had a negro slave sustained a similar
outrage, and the circumstance had come to your knowledge, would it
not have awakened all your indignation, and called forth the
strongest powers of your eloquence; the public, inflamed by your
means into a sense of the outrage, would have been unable to sleep
soundly until they had brought the delinquent to a trial."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 60</p>-->

<p>In the life of Captain Robert William Eastwick (Unwin 1891)
there is a good example of the impress system. Eastwick, when chief
officer of a ship lying in the Thames in 1790, went on shore on
leave, and was impressed and sent to the <i>Inconstant</i> frigate,
though legally exempt from impressment. Eastwick offered to produce
a substitute, pointing out that as he was the mate of the ship his
owners would be seriously inconvenienced. He was only eighteen
years of age, and the man-o'-war captain's answer was a demand for
two men in exchange, for there was too great need of good men to
let such a capable young fellow go in a merchant ship. To do this
particular captain justice, however, he made the merchant seaman a
master's-mate, and if he had remained in the service, instead of
leaving it at the end of the commission, Eastwick might, like Cook,
have ended as a post captain.</p>

<p>This violent impressment was as a matter of fact an every-day
occurrence, and so remained until the war was over. The papers of
the time contain any number of instances of it, and cases are
frequently adduced, and officers wrote justifying the
practice&mdash;stating, in fact, that the only way to man the fleet
was to kidnap men in the public streets. Fine old fellows with good
conservative ideas, these men! Their successors in the navy fifty
years later were writing letters on the madness of introducing
steam into the service.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 61</p>-->

<p>The King's ships were often in such straits for men that
"butchers and bakers and candlestick makers" were frequently
kidnapped and sent to sea to complete the complements of
short-handed ships, and when landsmen were pressed to man warships
it may be taken for granted that merchant vessels either went to
sea short-handed, inefficiently manned, or were laid up in the
seaports, unable to get men. Yet the mercantile marine flourished,
and the ships of the time earned a profit for their owners. But our
boys were not encouraged to take to the sea for a profession, if
one may judge from the fact that, in the last year of the war, only
four boys were apprenticed to the merchant service in the port of
London.</p>

<p>The pay of a merchant seaman at this period varied from £3 to £5
per month, and when the navy impressed him the Government paid him
£1, 8s. 6d. a month, allowing him to make over to his relatives on
shore, to draw while he was at sea, the munificent amount of 14s.
6d. a month out of his 28s. 6d. So that in return for the
additional risk to life and limb, and as an encouragement to come
forward and fight for his domestic hearth, he was taken by force
from his lawful occupation and paid by Government £30 a year less
for his services. At the height of the war about 140,000 men were
required for the fleet, and of this number it was estimated that
60,000 were pressed men.</p>

<p>The press was not confined to the shore. It was a very common
occurrence for a man-o'-war to make a merchant vessel bring to,
send a boat and take every likely man off the vessel, leaving her
just enough hands to make the nearest port, and this was often done
to homeward bound vessels, so that men, after suffering the
hardships of a long voyage, looking forward to a run on shore, and
to seeing their families, after perhaps a couple of years absence
from England, were made prisoners, and as likely as not killed in
action or died in a French prison, and their relatives heard no
more of them.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 62</p>-->

<p>After Buonaparte's removal to Elba, a sloop of war that had been
engaged in that service went on to India, and when on her way,
lying off Madeira, the captain of the sloop sent his boats to two
South Seamen lying in the roads, and took nearly all the sailors
off them. The masters of the two ships manned their boats with
apprentice boys and rowed off to the sloop to beg the captain to
leave them, at any rate, enough men to navigate the vessels. On
coming alongside the captain hailed the boats, asking what was
wanted, and on being told, ordered the apprentices to come on
board, and as soon as they were up the ship's side, he cast off the
boats and made sail, taking with him the men and boys, and leaving
the two merchant skippers in their boats to make their way back as
best they could. This man was celebrated in the service as a
martinet. On this particular voyage, he had both his lieutenants
prisoners at one time, one for six and the other for nine months;
one of these officers became so ill through his treatment that he
never recovered, and the gunner of the ship actually died through
the captain's cruelty.</p>

<p>At this time, as Mr Urquhart reminds us in his pamphlet, we were
greatly concerned about the poor slaves in the West Indies.</p>

<p>At the height of the war period the press could not find sailors
enough to man our ships, and the Government offered bounties for
seamen, often very large sums, and frequently magistrates, instead
of committing thieves to gaol, gave them the option of entering on
board a King's ship; so that in the same ship could be found poor
but respectable men kidnapped in the streets, highly bribed "bounty
men," and the scum of the gaols.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 63</p>-->

<p>In the beginning of the century, therefore, there was no
difference between merchant seamen and men-o'-war's men. A man
might be peacefully engaged in the coal trade on the coast one
year, and fighting his country's battles under Nelson the next. At
the end of the ship's commission, if there were plenty of sailors,
he might starve for all the Government would do for him, and he was
lucky if he could get back to his collier and die in harness, for
hundreds of his shipmates at Copenhagen, at the Nile, and at
Trafalgar, were begging for bread in the public streets.</p>

<p>Yet Jack was a happy-go-lucky fellow, not, perhaps, quite such a
delightful character as Dibdin's sea songs paint him, but Dibdin's
"Tar" and Kipling's "Tommy Atkins" may very well stand together as,
if not exactly the real thing, very good types for the great
British public to believe in. For example, a newspaper in 1806
reports the death at Portsea of an old salt named Covey; and Dr
Duncan, chaplain of the <i>Venerable</i>, is responsible for this
story of Covey's behaviour at the battle of Camperdown. Covey was
brought to the cockpit with both legs shot away, and the surgeon
approached him with his implements to trim off the remains of his
limbs.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Covey, "those d&mdash;&mdash;d scissors will
finish the business of the bullet, master mate?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, my brave fellow," said the surgeon, "there is some fear
of it."</p>

<p>"Well, never mind," cried Covey, "I've lost my legs, to be sure,
and mayhap, may lose my life; but we beat the Dutch;
d&mdash;&mdash;n me, we have beat the Dutch. This blessed day my
legs have been shot off, so I'll even have another cheer for it,
huzza! huzza!"</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 64</p>-->

<p>Covey being no longer of any use for any other purpose, they
made a cook of him, and he was serving on board a ship in
Portsmouth harbour up to the time of his death. According to Dr
Duncan, "he was awful as a swearer, as he afterwards felt and
acknowledged, but long before his death, his oaths were turned into
praises, and his last words were, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!"</p>

<p>But a police report of a case at the Guildhall, in which a
shoemaker charged a bluejacket with attempting to defraud him of a
pair of shoes, reads uncommonly like a scene from Marryat:</p>

<p>Jack being called on for his defence, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="newspaper">
<p>"I was paid off from his Majesty's ship <i>Northumberland</i>
yesterday, and I came into this London for the first time this
morning. I am bound for Bristol, and set sail at three o'clock, in
the stage coach for that port. I saw the old man that lubber talks
of (pointing to the shoemaker) standing at the corner of a street.
I hove-to, and asked him if he could recommend me to a good place
to get a good pair of shoes. He took me under his convoy, and
brought me to that lubber's shop. After I had shipped the shoes on
me, I offered the old man my old ones that I had unshipped, as a
reward for his trouble, which he refused. I had not silver enough
to pay for them, and I lugged out of my pocket a parcel of
bank-notes, just in this way (putting his hand in his pocket, and
producing a parcel of notes rumpled up, as if they were dirty waste
paper), some of them for £5, £2, and others for £1. I gave the
lubber one of the notes; he had not change, and handed it to the
old man to get change. He made sail, but was not able to keep his
reckoning, so as to make the port again. That lubber, thought I,
had never doubled Cape Horn. Then the shoemaker asked me to unship
the shoes; I told him I had not been at sea all my life for
nothing, and that I was not to be taken aback that way, and
insisted on his giving me my change; on which he said he would send
for an officer: that made me contented, as I thought it was one of
his Majesty's officers; he laughed at me, and said he was a city
officer. He behaved very civil to me, and said he would introduce
me to your Honour, who was a civil magistrate, and that you would
do me justice. I have only one word more to say, which is, that I
never saw the old man before I asked him to shape my course to a
shoemaker's shop, but if ever I again come across his hawse, and
can lay my grappling irons on him, I will have him before your
Honour, or some other civil magistrate."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 65</p>-->

<p><i>Alderman Thorpe</i>.&mdash;"You unfortunately got into bad
company."</p>

<p><i>Jack</i>.&mdash;"I do not know what you call it, but this I
know, that that lubber wants to bamboozle me out of my note; he
handed it to the old man."</p>

<p><i>Clerk to the Aldermen</i>.&mdash;"The old man called you his
son in the complainant's shop, which you did not deny; and it was
natural for him to suppose he was right in giving him the note to
get change."</p>

<p><i>Jack</i>.&mdash;"If he did call me his son, I did not hear
him; and if he is my father, it is without my knowledge; and if I
am his son, all I can say is, that I have a d&mdash;&mdash;d old
rogue of a father."</p>

<p><i>Alderman Thorpe</i>.&mdash;"I wish you had some person to
take care of the rest of your money."</p>

<p><i>Jack</i>.&mdash;"As to the matter of that, I can take care of
it myself: but who would have supposed that the first civil man I
spoke to in London should be a rogue. Your Honour won't think I
mean any allusions."</p>

<p><i>Alderman Thorpe</i>.&mdash;"I would recommend you to pay the
shoemaker for the shoes, and continue your journey to Bristol."</p>

<p><i>Jack</i>.&mdash;"I am bound beyond that, and for twenty years
I have been trying to come at the wish of my heart, that is, to see
my parents once more, with some money in my pocket. I would have
gone to have seen them before, but I could not assist them. I ran
away from them fifteen years back, and I suppose they think I have
gone to Davey's Locker; but if ever I reach Kilmacthomas, in the
County of Waterford, I will make their old hearts leap with joy,
and prove to them that Jack has still a soul to be saved. But I do
not think I ought to pay for the shoes again, as the lubber himself
gave the pound note to the old rogue."</p>

<p><i>Alderman Thorpe</i>.&mdash;"I honour your intentions, and I
trust you will again see your parents, who will, I am sure,
appreciate your good intentions. Do not mistake me; I did not order
you to pay for the shoes, I only recommended it to you; in fact, I
have no power to make such an order."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 66</p>-->

<p><i>Jack</i>.&mdash;"The officer was right when he told me you
were a civil magistrate, and there is no advice you can give me
that I will not follow."</p>

<p><i>Alderman Thorpe</i>.&mdash;"I can say no more. Follow the
course you have intimated with prudence, and I am sure you will do
right, but you must not stop on the road."</p>

<p><i>Jack</i>.&mdash;"Your Honour may depend I will not; if I
could go all the way by sea I would never be out of my latitude;
but those stages bring up so often, it makes seven bells thirty
times a day: I will never forget what your Honour has said to me;
and if ever I hear any one speak of a civil magistrate, I will be
sure to tell them that they will find one in London. Will your
Honour tell me what I am to do with the lubber?"</p>

<p><i>Mr Payne</i>.&mdash;"He will depend on your honour."</p>

<p><i>Jack</i>.&mdash;"He won't; he does not know what it is. Will
your Honour tell me what to do?"</p>

<p><i>Alderinan Thorpe</i>.&mdash;"I have already told you what I
recommend."</p>

<p>One of the Marshal men spoke to Jack, and he turned on him quite
in an indignant manner; "I want none of your advice; I have had it
from a civil magistrate, and here is another pound note, and let
the lubber give me change; at the same time it is d&mdash;&mdash;d
hard to pay £1, 12s., for a pair of shoes."</p>

<p>Jack having received his change, said to the Alderman, "I wish
your civil Honour was not so far from me, for I should have wished
to have shaken flippers with you; but if ever I come this way again
you may depend upon it I will give you a call, and that by my own
doing."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 67</p>-->

<p>In the "good old times" long after the war was over, it was
possible for the traveller over Portsdown Hill to meet a sailor
riding on horseback, steering his steed by its tail and carrying a
boat's anchor slung to his saddle with which to anchor the horse
when brought up abreast of the roadside taverns; or he might have
fallen in with a specially chartered coach with thirty or forty
sailors with their girls aboard, riding on every part of the
turn-out, from the necks of the horses to the boot of the vehicle,
all noisily drunk and all with more money in their pockets (for the
few days they would keep it) than in these days of ship savings
banks and decent homes could be found on a whole ship's company,
and these things were, even well into the second half of the
century, I have seen merchant seamen in the seventies come on board
for a twelve months' voyage, possessing nothing but the clothes
they stood upright in, and these garments absolutely nothing but a
canvas jacket and a pair of trousers, I have seen a man in this
state finding that by an accident he had still a sovereign in his
pocket, throw it on the wharf to be fought for by street arabs.</p>

<p>At the close of the last century, the evils of the advanced note
system were so apparent that Parliament made some attempts to
remedy them, and amendments of the statutes covering the payment of
seamen were passed, and provision made to keep men on full pay when
they had been wounded in action, or if declared incurable, to
pension them, or take them to Greenwich Hospital. But all the law
in the world could not save Jack from the landsharks; and the Jews
on the Hard continued to make fortunes by the sale of gilded
watches, until many years later. The mutinies, a few years before
the century opened, forced the Government into paying a sailor
regularly his shilling a day, putting a stop to the frauds of
clerks and pursers, who by ingenious systems of deductions, had
hitherto been pocketing twenty-five per cent, of the sailor's
earnings, but the Government could not teach Jack to be careful of
his own when he came by it.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 68</p>-->

<p>All books on the sea are full of stories of Jack and his
extravagances, the yarn of Admiral Kempenfelt and his waistcoat,
which is supposed to have happened twenty years before the century
opened, might have occurred within the last fifty years. Jack much
admired his commanding officer's gold-laced velvet waistcoat, so as
soon as the ship reached Portsmouth he made for the Admiral's
tailor and ordered a similar garment&mdash;"And, hark'ee, you swab,
back and front alike, none of your half-cloth, half-velvet
dodge."</p>

<p>Jack got his waistcoat, and looked out for the Admiral, who
laughed heartily at his get-up, in tarpaulin hat, canvas trousers,
and greasy jumper, flapping open, and displaying the gorgeous
undergarment.</p>

<p>"What do ye think of me, yer honour?" says Jack, lifting up the
hind part of the jumper. "D&mdash;&mdash;n me, old boy, no false
colours, do ye see stem and stern alike, by the Lord."</p>

<p>When seamen were wanted to complete a vessel's complement, it
was, and so remained until past the middle of the century, the
custom to post likely seaports with alluring placards. Here is an
actual copy of one that was stuck about on the walls of the Thames
docks in 1816:&mdash;</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 69</p>-->

<p class="newspaper">"Who would enter for a small craft? whilst the
<i>Leander</i>, the finest and fastest sailing frigate in the
world, with a good spar deck overhead to keep you dry, warm, and
comfortable; and a lower deck like a barn, where you may play at
leap-frog when the hammocks are hung up; has room for 100 active,
smart seamen, and a dozen stout lads for royal yard men. This
wacking double-banked frigate is fitting at Woolwich to be flagship
on the fine, healthy, full-bellied Halifax station, where you may
get a bushel of potatoes for a shilling, a cod-fish for a biscuit,
and a glass of boatswain's grog for twopence. The officers' cabins
are building on the main deck, on purpose to give every tar a
double berth below. Lots of leave on shore; dancing and fiddling on
board; and 4 lbs. of tobacco served out every month. A few
strapping fellows, who would eat an enemy alive, wanted for the
admiral's barge. The officers already appointed are Captain
Skipsey, late <i>Maidstone</i>; Lieutenant J. P. Baker, late
<i>Royal Sovereign</i>, <i>Rippon</i> and <i>Barham</i>; H. Walker,
late <i>Courageaux</i>, and <i>Menelaus</i>; J. S. Dixon, late
<i>Caledonia</i>, and <i>San Joseph</i>; A. P. Le Neve, late
<i>Maidstone</i>; E. A. Haughton, late <i>St Lawrence</i>, and
<i>Princess Charlotte</i> (on the Lakes), who will give every
encouragement to their old shipmates. Every good man is almost
certain of being made a warrant officer, or getting a snug berth in
Halifax dockyard. All brave volunteers whom this may suit must bear
a hand, and apply either on board the <i>Leander</i>, at Woolwich;
at her rendezvous, the Half Moon and Seven Stars, Ratclifife
Highway, nearly opposite Old Gravel Lane; on board the
<i>Enterprise</i>, off the Tower; or at any other general
rendezvous in the kingdom, from whence they will be immediately
forwarded to the <i>Leander</i>.<br>
God save the King!!<br>
The <i>Leander</i>, and a full-bellied station!!!"</p>

<p>It is curious the number of women who took a fancy to the sea in
the first years of the century. I came across three different cases
reported in as many years. There is what the lawyers would call a
leading case&mdash;that of Mary Anne Talbot, whose adventures would
fill a chapter, and who early in the century was receiving a
pension of £20 a year for wounds received in action, when she was
before the mast in the navy; in another instance, Rebecca Anne
Johnson was apprenticed by her father to a Whitby collier, and
served seven years before, in 1808, her sex was discovered. Her
mother had served at sea before her, and fell, one of a gun's crew,
fighting at Copenhagen.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 70</p>-->

<p>And here, to end the chapter, is the announcement of a wedding
in London in which sailors of both sexes were united:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"At St Dunstane's in the East, in May 1802,
David Jones was married to Anne Robinson. They had been old
shipmates on board <i>La Seine</i>, frigate on the West Indian
station during most part of the war, where the lady bore a most
conspicuous part in the different actions in which the frigate was
engaged. She was always an attendant in the surgeon's department,
and waited upon Jones in his wounded state. An attachment took
place which ended in their union."</p>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV. THE SEA LIFE.</h2>

<h3>How Seamen were, and are, Fed, Clothed, and Quartered.</h3>

<p>To-day, an officer in the Royal Navy has almost as many separate
suits of uniform for his own particular use as would have served to
clothe all the commissioned officers in an old line of battle ship.
Even the merchant service officer in most companies is now decked
out with gold braid enough to have served Howe or Nelson for a full
dress uniform, and the less important the line, the more plentiful
the gold lace. On this subject I have heard a story:&mdash;</p>

<p>The owners of a certain steamship company wrote to the Admiralty
for permission to decorate the officers of their steamers with
epaulets. It is alleged that my lords sent this reply: "By all
means we permit your officers to wear epaulets, with this one
condition: that they do not wear them on the shoulders."</p>

<p>Both Marryat and Michael Scott drew pictures of officers and men
that give an excellent idea of how very far from uniform was the
dress of the service until after the war was over, and the
Admiralty began to devote a great deal of attention to questions of
gold lace and buttons. Without going into detail, it may be said
that the pictures of groups of officers on quarterdecks&mdash;the
picture of the scene where Nelson fell on the <i>Victory</i>, for
example&mdash;are accurate enough to give us a good idea of the
naval officers' dress early in the century. The senior officers
wore three-cornered hats, blue coats with white facings, white
breeches, and white waistcoats, and sometimes hessian boots.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 72</p>-->

<p>The number and pattern of the buttons were the chief distinctive
marks, and so remained until well down in the present reign. Now,
the familiar crown and anchor is common to all ranks; it is the
only item in the tailoring line that has escaped the attention of
the Admiralty during the last few years. But for a generation, or
longer, after the dawn of the century, there were elaborate
distinctions in buttons. One could, for instance, tell a surgeon by
his buttons bearing the seal of the Sick and Hurt Office&mdash;a
snake curling itself round an anchor; a master by the seal of the
Navy Office&mdash;three anchors; a purser by that of the
Victualling Office&mdash;two anchors and cables crossed. These
warrant officers also wore blue facings in place of white, and the
grips of their sword hilts were black; this last distinction is now
confined to the three remaining warrant officers, the gunner,
boatswain, and carpenter.</p>

<p>Gold rings on the coat cuffs, the number of rings according to
the rank of the officer, a curl distinguishing the executive
branch, and a slight strip of red, white, or purple, the three
different civil branches, the chief modern distinguishing marks,
had their origin more than a hundred years ago, when rear-, vice-,
or full admirals were distinguished by one, two, or three rings
according to their rank. But for the first quarter of the century,
rank was distinguished chiefly by the epaulet, and the lop-sided
idea of one epaulet for officers under the rank of captain, lasted
for many years longer. Regulations published in the <i>Naval
Chronicle</i> in 1807 quote former regulations relating to uniform
in 1787, and show no material alterations, except in the matter of
epaulets, which were introduced at the request of the naval
officers, who complained that while army officers could always be
recognised by their epaulets, naval officers were frequently
mistaken by military men for petty officers by the absence of this
sign of rank.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 73</p>-->

<p>Some verses published in 1812 refer to the concession, and
incidentally tell something of uniform.</p>

<p>No more shall captain, vain and stern,<br>
Nor flippant army subaltern,<br>
Alone the 'bullion' wear.<br>
No more marine subordinate<br>
On deck display the epaulet<br>
The while your shoulders bare.</p>

<p>No more shall merchant skipper dare<br>
Your button late usurped to wear<br>
Now more respected grown.<br>
That button, late an anchor plain.<br>
The regal crown surmounts again<br>
To prove you the King's own.</p>

<p>The poet goes on to sing of "Slashed sleeve and epaulet, trim
cock'd hat with neat rosette," and to wish "each luff" success with
his epaulet, and speedy promotion to a pair of them.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 74</p>-->

<p>I think the present white lappel on midshipmen's collars, which
irreverent youngsters have called the "mark of the beast," is about
the oldest unaltered distinction mark in the service. William IV.
took a fancy to dress executive officers with red facings on their
uniforms, but the Admiralty soon came back to white, and it has not
since been altered, the only bit of red now-a-days is the
distinction mark on the surgeon's sleeves, and the red velvet in
the crown of a cap badge. For executive officers the swords were
much as they are now, but for the civil branches of the service
there was a sensible regulation by which this branch wore dress
swords with rapier blades, the kind of weapon worn now by the
diplomatic service, and stage kings and courtiers.</p>

<p>The marines supplied the colour, their red coats and white
cross-belts made the quarter-deck look uniform. A set of
regulations for 1805 lays down that "the marines are to be paraded
every morning at ten o'clock when the men's hair is to be well tied
and clubbed, their faces and hands washed, and shoes cleaned. They
are to have clean shirts on Sundays and Thursdays. A guard is to be
ready every morning at half-past eight, when the men are in every
respect to be well-dressed, their great-coats neatly rolled and
well slung, and their arms and accoutrements in high order and
well-appointed."</p>

<p>This was written by an officer in 1818:&mdash;</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 75</p>-->

<p>"A blood is known by his costume, for an attention to the
regulated uniform is wholly beneath his notice, with a surtout to
hide the coat he disgraces, a round hat, and a formidable cudgel in
his hand, he is equipped for the field; and with the assistance of
as much port as he can conveniently carry, is fully prepared,
either to attack or defend any one so that it leads to a row. The
naval uniform is by no means inelegant, but even if it were so, no
individual is authorised to alter it, or introduce innovations in
his own person; if it has a fault, it is that of not being
sufficiently marked; this is particularly exemplified in the
side-arms worn in the service, to say nothing of the infinite
variety of belts to which they are attached; you will see one tied
to a sword as long as himself, another with a dirk so small, you
would swear it had been some bodkin purloined from a lady's head;
and not one officer in twenty wearing the sword appointed for him
by the regulations of the service. Custom has sanctioned wearing
the dirk in lieu of the sword on ordinary duty; the latter, in a
small boat, being frequently found an awkward encumbrance; but it
was never contemplated such fantastic articles would be introduced,
as may now be seen stuck to the sides of our young officers, of all
shapes and sizes; nay, some are so peaceably inclined, that their
side-arms were never made to draw, but consist merely of a hilt
stuck to an ornamented scabbard. The dirk or dagger has frequently
been found a formidable weapon in boarding, when carried in the
left hand, and may be used as a weapon both of offence and defence;
for if laid back along the arm, a blow might be received upon it
which could not other ways be warded; were this weapon, therefore,
officially sanctioned and directed to be worn not as an apology,
but an appendage to the sword, and its length regulated together
with a sling or knot, to prevent its being lost from the hand on
service, it would at once put an end to the ridiculous toys at
present worn under the name of side-arms, form a handsome addition
to the uniform, inform our young men of its real use, and, placed
in the front of the sword belt, might be allowed (as it is at
present) to be worn on ordinary duty, instead of the more cumbrous
sword, while on real service both would be found useful; thus one
belt only would be necessary for the sword and dirk which might be
regulated both as to breadth and ornament."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 76</p>-->

<p>When the Queen came to the throne, the dress regulations were
pretty clear and not unlike what they are now, except that an
undress and a full-dress uniform were considered variety sufficient
for an officer. As to the seamen, it was not until 1851 that
uniform for them was established, and the men of Nelson's time, as
can be seen from the pictures, decked themselves as their fancy
pleased them. But the sea has a way of teaching men how to clothe
themselves sensibly, and Jack, because the wind would blow away an
awkwardly shaped hat, soon took to wearing caps, and because he
wanted freedom in his limbs, to loose trousers, and for ease in his
feet, high-lows, or "purser's crabs," as the low shoes were called.
Pigtails were, of course, the mode when the century opened, but
soon went out, except with the marines, who, being more than half
soldiers, and not having to go aloft and lay out on yards, kept up
their military stiffness.</p>

<p>There are some remarkable examples of how lax, or rather, how
entirely absent, were dress regulations in the dress of Royal Naval
seamen. A famous sporting admiral, I have been assured by an
officer who sailed with him, selected his crew for their physical
and fisticuff capabilities: his boat's crew could, as a schoolboy
would put it, "whop" any other men in the ship's company, and the
coxswain of his gig could "whop" the gig's crew, and the midshipmen
of the boat could lick any other youngster in the gun-room. These
men were dressed in a fancy rig composed of the gallant officer's
racing colours. While another well-known similar case is that of
the <i>Harlequin's</i> gig's crew, a sloop of war of Crimean war
time, who were all dressed as harlequins.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 77</p>-->

<p>The dress of seamen down to the establishment of uniform was by
reason of their own common sense, generally blue jacket, white duck
trousers, and tarpaulin hat; men in the tropics soon learnt the
value of the straw hat and so took to wearing it, while those in
the Channel stuck to the warm flannel and fear-nought petticoats of
their father's time. Soft cloth and knitted caps, common to
merchant seamen, then, as now, do not seem to have been general in
the navy, and so, I infer, men on King's ships went aloft and
jammed their hats so hard upon their heads as not to lose them.
Sea-dandies wore striped shirts, and decorated their pantaloons
with little tags of canvas, as costers do their garments with pearl
buttons.</p>

<p>In the Royal Navy during the last half of the century, the food
of the seamen has been vastly improved, but I do not think the
bluejacket's quarters are as comfortable as they were in the old
days. The old line of battle ship was not crowded with a thousand
men on board as is the modern ship with fewer men. Men could find a
quiet corner somewhere on her, that is, of course, when the
hammocks were stowed, but at night the men's deck, then, as now,
was closely packed. The hammocks were slung in parallel rows fore
and aft the ship, right from one side of her to the other, the rows
being only fourteen inches apart, leaving no passage between them
unless a man stooped or pushed them apart with his shoulders.
Readers of Smollett will remember what unpleasant adventure befell
Roderick Random when he went to attend a sick man, and got jammed
between two hammocks.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 78</p>-->

<p>Evidence on the state of the Mercantile Marine given before a
Royal Commission in 1853, shows how our merchant seamen were
quartered. A witness on the subject said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In British ships the men are not treated as they ought to be. I
have taken particular notice of their place of abode, which is on
almost every ship of small size, a small dark cave, without light
or warmth, or not such a kind of place wherein they may rest and
repose themselves; and in point of size it is sometimes six or
seven feet square, for six or seven men, stowed half-full of rope
and sails, damp and wet. The very small accommodation the poor men
have in bad weather, completely enervates them; they are thus
rendered unable to perform their duty, and shipwrecks follow from
the inability of the men. I went into the forecastle of ten
different ships and measured them, and I have the measure here.
There was no proper accommodation where they could stretch
themselves out, there was room for the hammocks, but in several of
them there was no skylight, and if they shut the hatches of the
forecastle, there was no air and no light. I also consider that the
want of accommodation in the forecastle of the ship may be one of
the causes of intemperance, because if the men have no place to
repose themselves in a seaport after arriving at the port, the men
are compelled to go to a public house, and thus becomie
intemperate. Comparing them with foreign ships, the contrast is
most obvious. There is ample space for every foreign seaman; they
have box-beds (standing, or fixed bed-places, which our large ships
also have), and uniformly a painted cabin for the seamen. They can
sit round the fire and talk and read, and amuse themselves, and
they have a place of repose whenever they retire from their work;
but in nine-tenths of smaller British ships it is quite the
contrary; indeed, I have the particulars here of the various sizes
of different forecastles; I believe there was only one in ten
vessels that I measured that was painted; the others were all bare
wood.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 79</p>-->

<p>"This is a serious reflection on the shipowner, and should be
remedied. There is such heartlessness in consigning human beings to
the dog-holes that are but too often appropriated to the use of
seamen, as to create much surprise in those who are not aware of
what an absorbing principle the love of gain is. There is one thing
that has been pointed out to me frequently by shipmasters, namely:
the insufficiency of the crews in number; the present proportions
may be said to be from 100 to 150 (tons) six; from 150 to 200,
eight; from 200 to 250, ten. Now, I do not say that these
proportions exist in all shipping; but that they do exist
frequently, I know; whereas it is thought the proportion ought to
be at least a fifth or sixth more, namely: from 100 to 150, eight;
150 to 200, ten; 200 to 250, twelve. Of course I am not speaking
dictatorially; I am only saying what a proper marine board ought to
have the power of fixing."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 80</p>-->

<p>The food on board men-of-war has vastly improved in quality and
quantity, and Jack is now given facilities to add to his dietary
scale by the purchase of little luxuries. The messes by clubbing
their money, and a judicious expenditure of a small amount, can
considerably improve on the regulation allowance, although there is
very little to growl at in the Government rations, and trained
cooks in place of worn-out old sailors now make the food palatable.
By one of the many Acts of Parliament passed for the benefit of
seamen, the merchant shipowner was compelled to give sailors
certain rations, and I know that in very many ships this "pound and
pint" law has resulted in the men being infinitely worse fed.
Biscuit and salt beef one day, biscuit and salt pork the next,
peas, oatmeal, beer or wine, or rum, flour, and vinegar, were, and
(omitting the beer and wine) still are, the principal rations. The
water is the only ration that has improved in quality, for before
the twenties, the water carried in wooden casks was sometimes very
foul drinking, and the ration was very small, a couple of quarts a
day, instead of three quarts as at present, being the quantity
usually allowed.</p>

<p>"Cracker hash" and "dandyfunk" are names of food messes now made
by sailors, the first from biscuits steeped in water and mixed with
pork fat; the second, biscuits mixed with molasses; sensible
sailors, when the meat is very bad, contrive to disguise some of
its vileness by thus mixing it. Not twenty years ago I was in a
ship, that, owing to the bad meat on board had nearly all her crew
ill with scurvy, and the few who escaped owed their immunity to
"cracker hash." There was, and is, no other reason for an outbreak
of scurvy but the neglect and meanness of owners and shipmasters.
Some of the men died on this voyage of a year's duration, from a
disease that Captain Cook contrived to avoid in all his long
voyages. I am happy to say the captain got heavily fined, and the
owners long since became bankrupt and no longer send ships to
sea.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 81</p>-->

<p>One method of husbanding water forty or fifty years ago, has
been described to me at different times by old men-o'-war's men.
The men's drinking allowance for the day was put in a scuttle-butt,
such as most of us have seen in small coasters. To obtain a drink
it was necessary to use the dipper, a long, narrow, tin cup, the
only vessel that would fit the bung-hole of the cask. This dipper
was kept at the main royal-mast-head, and any one who wanted a
drink had to climb the rigging, bring down the cup, take his drink
and return the dipper to its place aloft. A sentry was put over the
cask to see that this double journey was performed for each drink,
and it may be taken for granted that, even on a hot day in the
tropics, men did not quench their thirst very often&mdash;between
parched lips, and a double run up and down to the main-truck of a
seventy-four, there was not much to choose.</p>

<p>I believe the stories that are told of men carving tobacco boxes
out of their allowance of beef I have seen beef that could be used
for this purpose, and that shore people could not have detected
from wood; and I have seen biscuits that could not be broken
without the use of an implement such as a hammer or the thick end
of a marlinespike. This kind of bread is good; it is too hard to
harbour vermin. I have seen it printed somewhere that a
distinguished naturalist has said that the yarns of sailors about
weevily biscuits are untrue, that no insect of the kind gets into
sea biscuits. If that naturalist had ever been to sea in a ship
where the softer quality of biscuit was in the stores, he would
have obtained an ounce weight of experience out of every biscuit,
that would have for ever knocked the bottom out of his theorising.
Not once but a hundred times have I seen men skim the maggots in
spoonfuls from the tea in which their biscuits were soaked. But I
think the worst form of food on shipboard is the pork, sometimes
still so vile that I have in recent years seen the hardest old
shellbacks retch violently at the smell of it cooking in the
galley. Men use the fat of it in slush lamps instead of oil in
places where the shipowner is too mean to supply the crew with
enough lamp oil, and the smell of the lamp in the forecastle is so
bad that it is only lit when absolutely necessary.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 82</p>-->

<p>The bill of fare in harbour is often roast beef and boiled
potatoes and soup. It sounds good, but the soup is just greasy, hot
water, in which a few bones have been boiled for two or three days,
and this mess is strengthened by boiling the joints in it. When
certain of the joints are about half-cooked, they are taken out of
the great copper and baked brown in the galley oven&mdash;thus is
the sailor supplied with his roast and boiled. The potatoes, it may
be depended upon, are of the worst possible quality, and are served
in their skins, about two to each man. The food is served in a
disgusting fashion in small, wooden tubs or mess "kids," the meat
and vegetables huddled together in one, the soup in another. At
sea, a tub of peasoup and a tub of meat one day; soft bread, viz.,
the sailor's allowance of flour made up into rolls, and beef, the
next. The allowance for a watch is dumped into a tub, and each man
cuts off his "whack" with his jack-knife.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 83</p>-->

<p>Of course all merchant ships are not alike, and on steamers,
particularly on the better class of them, the food is very good
indeed. It comes cheaper to feed the crew on fresh food than on the
Act of Parliament rations on board such steamers, but on many of
the sailing ships lying in foreign seaports, a visitor can easily
see for himself how atrociously the crew are lodged and fed. Of
course, when the ship has been some days in port, the salt meat
disappears, but a day after entering port, before the harness-casks
are cleaned, as they call the tubs in which the ration for a period
is kept, a visitor can see and smell the quality of the meat. But
this experience is as nothing to what it would be if landsmen could
visit the ship when she is lying becalmed on the equator. Then the
steep-tub, in which the meat is soaked all night in salt water
before being boiled next day in salt water, gives forth an odour
that would betray the sailing-ship's vicinity to the passengers on
a mail-boat, when the vessels were hull down to each other. In such
ships, with such accommodation and such food, parents are still
foolish enough to pay premiums to have their sons apprenticed. The
boys are supposed to be separately lodged from the seamen, and to
be taught the trade of the sea with a view to their becoming
officers. As a matter of fact they are lodged in a house on deck,
very often more uncomfortable than the forecastle, and in company
no better than that of the seamen, and they are taught nothing.
What little they learn is picked up by chance, and because, though
their masters chiefly employ them in polishing brasswork and
cleaning pigsties, the ships are now so short-handed that the
seamen in the forecastle take care to make the apprentices do as
much work as possible.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 84</p>-->

<p>The monotony of the sea life, in peace or in war, in
trading-vessel or in warship, in the beginning or at the end of the
century, can be little understood by shore-going folk. Readers of
sea-books are told of the weariness of that time, when we were
blockading the French ports, but a chapter or two describing an
action dispels the impression, and we think only of the drum
beating to quarters and of all the excitement of battle. But the
routine life on a man-o'-war in the old days was the dullest life
it is possible to imagine. Often as ships were in battle, there
were many ships, and there were not battles enough to go round,
even though the fighting had been evenly distributed, which it was
not. The modern fighting ship is even duller, and certainly no one
who wants change ought to take to the sea now, any more than
then.</p>

<p>The nine hundred or a thousand persons on an old line of battle
ship were every day employed doing the same thing that they were
doing the day before. The excitement of beating to quarters must
have been a welcome change to the dullness of cruising. When the
order "Clear ship for action" was given, the boatswain's whistle
sounded shrilly at the hatchways, and the boatswain's mates
hoarsely cried, "Clear lower deck, up all hammocks." Every sailor
ran to his hammock, and in it stowed his bedding in a neat roll,
and passed the lashing round it&mdash;the art of passing a
hammock-lashing properly is still one of the first technicalities
taught to seaman boys. The hammocks were then carried to the upper
deck and stowed by the quarter-masters in the hammock
nettings&mdash;a double network supported by iron stanchions
running along each side of the ship from the forecastle to the
poop&mdash;and, thus arranged, the seamen's beds made an excellent
barrier against shot.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 85</p>-->

<p>Meanwhile parties of men were rigging preventer braces, slings,
and so on, upon the yards, so that should the ordinary gear be
carried away by the fire of the enemy, the spars would not come
tumbling down on deck, entangling the men in piles of torn canvas,
fathoms of rigging, and debris of splintered wood. The carpenter
and his crew prepared plugs to stop shot holes in the ship's hull,
and got upon deck spare gear for the chain-pumps in case they
should be injured in the engagement. The gunner and his mates saw
that the guns were clear and ready for use, opened the magazine and
stationed men in it to pass along the charges, and saw that plenty
of cartridges were ready filled. The master and his mates took
charge of the sail-trimming and steering, prepared to make or
shorten sail, and brace the yards under the orders of the captain;
and the lieutenants, according to their number and the size of the
ship, took charge each of a deck or battery, and generally
supervised. This was the exciting break in the routine, and is the
same to-day, except that engineers and stokers have taken the place
of sail-trimmers; and torpedo nets, searchlights and such gear have
to be manipulated in addition to the guns. But the regular round
now is paintwork cleaning, and, apparently, for some reason best
known to the authorities, comparatively little drill, considering
how important drill is.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 86</p>-->

<p>In the old days, trimming the sails, pulling the yards first
this way, then that, to catch the breeze, what is known to seamen
as "pulley-hauley," in light, variable winds was, and is, only
comparable to the treadmill, and when a man-o'-war was keeping her
station, this kind of work was going on continually night and day.
There was very little drill, the cutlass exercise was not even
taught until the teens of the century, and great gun exercise was
too often looked upon by captains as a waste of time. Serving out
provisions and water, getting the salt beef and pork from the hold,
bringing the casks on deck to renew the brine pickle and restoring
them to the hold, weighing the meat and steeping it, serving out
slop clothes, overhauling men's kits, and keeping the ship clean,
all occupied much time when 500 to 1000 men were crowded together
in a confined space, and with the frequent interruptions of "All
hands about ship," or shorten sail or make sail, with the endless
round of rope-making, spun-yarn twisting, setting up rigging,
rope-splicing, and knotting, and making of chafing gear, there was
not much idle time on the sailing ship. In the days of
studdingsails and of cracking on to overhaul a possible prize, the
carrying away of spars from the press of canvas, and the loss of
canvas when the spars went by the board, gave plenty of work to
carpenters and sailmakers; and wooding and watering, two words now
almost obsolete, in the days of oak and hemp, took just that place
in the routine of ships as coaling does in steel and steam.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 87</p>-->

<p>It was then that men learnt how to handle a boat, a branch of
the profession in merchant ships, now fast becoming a lost
art&mdash;the average deep-water merchant seaman cannot pull a boat
properly, and though in the navy the sailor is taught to sail and
row, steam cutters and pinnaces are continually in use, and their
use increasing, makes it less and less important for sailors to
remember the teaching of the training-ship.</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V. NAVAL ENGAGEMENTS.</h2>

<h3>The French War Period&mdash;How our Merchantmen
Fought&mdash;The South Seamen&mdash;The Crimea&mdash;Modern
Affairs.</h3>

<p>When the eighteenth century went out and the new one came in
England's greatest naval warriors were in the fullness of their
glory. During 1800 there were enough brilliant frigate and boat
actions fought to fill a book with the story of them. It was in
that year that Cochrane played such havoc on the Spanish coast in
the little <i>Speedy</i>, whose broadside of 28 lbs. Cochrane used
to say he could carry in his coat pockets. Most Englishmen remember
the action in May with the Spanish frigate, whose broadside was 190
lbs. Cochrane's little brig could not stand up against a weight of
metal like this, and so he laid her alongside the Spaniard, and
then boarded with every officer and man, leaving only the surgeon
to look after the <i>Speedy</i>. When the Spaniards were driven
below and the casualties were counted, only 44 British were left
unwounded to guard the 260 Spanish prisoners, but Cochrane managed,
nevertheless, to take his brig and her prize into Port Mahon.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 89</p>-->

<p>On April 2nd, 1801, came Copenhagen. When we have forgotten the
exact cause of the quarrel with the Danes, when the number of ships
engaged, their names and every other detail shall have so passed
from our minds, that we shall have to refer to one of the thousand
or more books on the subject to see what it was all about, the fact
that Nelson won the battle by his courage to disobey, when
disobedience was generalship, will still be fresh in our
memories.</p>

<p>"The signal of recall is hoisted on the flagship."</p>

<p>"Is our signal for close action still hoisted?"</p>

<p>"Mind you keep it so."</p>

<p>Pacing the deck, moving the stump of his lost arm in a manner
which with him always indicated great emotion. Nelson presently
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Leave off action now! Damn me if I do! You know, Foley,"
turning to the captain, "I have only one eye, and I have a right to
be blind sometimes;" and then putting his glass to his blind eye in
that mood which sports with bitterness, he said, "I really do not
see the signal!" Presently he exclaimed, "Keep my signal for close
action flying! That is the way I answer such signals. Nail mine to
the mast."</p>

<p>Admiral Sir Hyde Parker, there is no doubt, hoisted the signal
from chivalrous motives. The fire, he said, was too hot for Nelson
to oppose, a retreat he thought must be made. He was aware of the
consequences to his own personal reputation, but it would be
cowardly in him to leave Nelson to bear the whole shame of the
failure, if shame it should be deemed. But Nelson won the battle,
and we only half remember the Commander-in-chief, or Graves, the
Rear-Admiral, who nobly supported Nelson, and, like him, refused to
see the signal.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 90</p>-->

<p>Then the message to the Danes and the sealing of the letter is
another of the personal incidents by which Copenhagen is
remembered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The brave Danes are the brothers and should never be the
enemies of England," sealing the letter with wax and not with the
proffered wafer, "for this is not the time to appear hurried or
informal."</p>

<p>There was one of Nelson's captains at Copenhagen who is
remembered to-day by some people in that portion of Greater
Britain, then the newly-made convict settlement at Botany Bay. This
was Edward Riou, who in 1789 encountered shipwreck in the
<i>Guardian</i>, taking stores to the new settlement. Those who saw
the ship successfully navigated to the Cape, after running upon an
iceberg, described Riou as having achieved "the most wonderfully
heroic act ever performed." There is a monument in St Paul's to
Riou, who died thus: Unwillingly he was drawing off his ship, the
<i>Amazon</i>, from under the guns of the Trekroner Battery, having
seen the Commander-in-chief's signal of recall. "What will Nelson
think of us!" he said sorrowfully. The blood was then streaming
from a wound in his head, and as his ship came round, exposing her
stern to the fire of the battery, a round shot came on board and
cut him in two. Nelson said "what he thought of us" when he wrote
his despatch and told of the loss of the "good and gallant
Riou."</p>

<p>Bligh, too, was there, gallantly fighting his ship, the
<i>Glatton</i>, little dreaming then that he would be forgotten for
this, and only remembered for the <i>Bounty</i> mutiny, or in
connection with some lying statement traducing his personal
courage. "Bligh, I thank you, you have supported me nobly," said
Nelson.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 91</p>-->

<p>A year later the Treaty of Amiens was signed, and we reckoned up
the cost to ourselves and to our enemies. The loss to our enemies
in ships, taken, lost, or destroyed, stood thus:&mdash;</p>

</pre>

<p>We had lost 20 ships of the line, 145 frigates and smaller
vessels, and of this number only 42 vessels were captured, and 9
destroyed by our enemies, the rest had been burned, wrecked, or
foundered at sea.</p>

<p>War broke out again in the spring of 1803, and until Trafalgar,
Buonaparte was getting ready his invasion flotilla, 150,000 men,
2300 vessels, and six hours command of the channel were all the
conditions he wanted to make a success of it. The last condition
was the only one that prevented the landing. A noteworthy event in
this connection was Lord Keith's "Catamaran expedition, designed to
destroy the flotilla assembled at Boulogne to invade England."
Copper vessels containing combustibles were arranged to explode in
a given time by clockwork, and were to be towed into position under
the enemy's ships by one-man catamarans or small canoes, the attack
to be made under a heavy fire, and to be aided by fire-ships. This
was the state of torpedo warfare at the beginning of the century,
and the expedition ended as feebly as might be expected from the
weapons employed. No damage was done to the French ships, and our
fleet went home again, to be laughed at.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 92</p>-->

<p>The capture of the Spanish treasure ships with £100,000 on board
them, in October 1804, made an open enemy of the Spaniards, and
this and Sir Robert Calder's action in July 1805 were the two
principal naval battles previous to Trafalgar, but between these
events, John Company distinguished itself&mdash;the homeward bound
China fleet engaged, and beat a French squadron under Admiral
Linois. This action more than any during the century illustrates
how our sea battles were fought by British sailors in the general
sense of the word, and how little distinction there was between
men-o'-war's men and merchant seamen. Even Marryat, in <i>Newton
Forster</i>, makes an old Greenwich pensioner say of the battle,
"I've worked my way clean through the whole yarn, and I seed the
report of killed and wounded, and I'll take my affi-davy that there
warn't an ossifer of the whole fleet as lost the number of his mess
in that theer action, and a clipping affair it was! Only think of
the moun-seer a-tarning tail to marchant vessels! Damn my old
buttons! What will our jolly fellows do next?" Now, though the
affair is one of the most creditable in our history, it is scarcely
just to the French to write of Linois running away from merchant
vessels, and as we have everything to gain by the truth, it is a
pity to exaggerate.</p>

<p>The want of an intelligence department at home enabled Linois to
leave Batavia with his flagship the <i>Marengo</i>, 80 guns,
<i>Belle Poule</i>, 40, <i>Semillante</i>, 36, <i>Berceau</i>, 22,
and the 16-gun brig <i>Aventurier</i>; the French admiral
calculating on the capture of the East India fleet in the China
Sea.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 93</p>-->

<p>Nathaniel Dance commanded the East India ships. The Company's
armed cruisers and merchantmen numbered 16, mounting from 30 to 36
guns; each vessel had a great many Lascar seamen on board; there
were also Europeans, numbering on the average 100 to each vessel.
Besides the 16 large ships, there were about a dozen smaller
merchantmen.</p>

<p>Linois fell in with the English ships off the Straits of
Malacca, and when Commodore Dance sighted the French squadron at
eight o'clock on the morning of February 14th, finding by sunset,
that the French ships were rapidly overhauling him, he decided to
offer them battle, but the Frenchmen then kept away. The next
morning at nine. Dance put his ships again on their course under
easy sail. The rest of the story is thus told in his
despatch:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"The enemy then filled their sails, and edged
towards us. At 1 P.M., finding they proposed to attack and
endeavour to cut off our rear, I made the signal to attack and bear
down upon him, and engage in succession, the <i>Royal George</i>
being the leading ship, the <i>Ganges</i> next, then the <i>Earl
Camden</i>. This manoeuvre was correctly performed, and we stood
towards him under a press of sail. The enemy then formed in a very
close line, and opened their fire on the headmost ships, which was
not returned by us till we approached him nearer. The <i>Royal
George</i> bore the brunt of the action, and got as near the enemy
as he would permit him; and the <i>Ganges</i> and <i>Earl
Camden</i> opened their fire as soon as their guns could have
effect; but before any other ship could get into action, the enemy
hauled their wind, and stood away to the eastward under all the
sail they could set. At 2 P.M. I made the signal for a general
chase, and we pursued them till 4 P.M., when, fearing a longer
pursuit would carry us too far from the mouth of the Straits, and
considering the immense property at stake, I made the signal to
tack, and at 8 P.M. we anchored in a situation to proceed for the
entrance of the Straits in the morning. As long as we could
distinguish the enemy, we perceived him steering to the eastward
under a press of sail. The <i>Royal George</i> had one man killed,
and another wounded, many shot in her hull, and more in her sails,
but few shots touched either the <i>Camden</i> or the
<i>Ganges</i>, and the fire of the enemy seemed to be ill-directed,
his shot either falling short or passing over us."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 94</p>-->

<p>Flinders on his way to England in the <i>Porpoise</i> was
wrecked on the Barrier Reef on the Australian coast, the
<i>Cato</i>, another vessel accompanying the <i>Porpoise</i>, also
coming to grief The crews of these two ships having made their way
to the East Indies were on the voyage to England in this East India
fleet, and helped to beat the Frenchmen. Young Franklin, afterwards
Sir John, was among the officers, and acting as signal midshipman
on the <i>Lord Camden</i>, he made the signal to engage. Flinders
was not there; he had tried to reach England in a little
colonial-built schooner, and putting into Madagascar, had been
taken prisoner by Du Caen, but that is another story.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Naval Pioneers of Australia</i>. Becke
&amp; Jeffery, John Murray, 1899.]</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 95</p>-->

<p>Without in the least detracting from the gallantry of the
Englishmen, which was gratefully recognised at home, Dance being
knighted, and all hands receiving a money grant from the Company,
it is apparent that sixteen ships, each armed with from 30 to 36
guns, and with crews well accustomed to the use of them, was not
such a very weak force against four vessels, only one of which was
of a very superior force to the Englishmen. Even now, when a
man-o'-war's man's trade is altogether different to a merchant
seaman's, we may possibly hear of some case in the future not
altogether dissimilar. But the 80-gun ship of Linois had not longer
range guns or weightier projectiles than her opponents, she had
only more guns. The modern ship may actually have fewer guns than
any one of a fleet of modern armed merchantmen, but one shot from
the battleship's big weapon, if truly aimed, would effectually
settle the business of a cruiser.</p>

<p>Frigate and boat actions went on just as regularly as the days
of the week came round, and the <i>Naval Chronicle</i> contains
hundreds of Gazette letters telling of them. And we were fighting
everywhere, West and East Indies, Mediterranean, and English
Channel. At last, in October 1805, came Trafalgar. The
<i>Victory</i>, with every stitch of canvas set, bearing down upon
the enemy; Nelson's prayer and his last petition to his King and
country, the famous signal; "England expects every man will do his
duty"&mdash;these preliminaries of the great battle will never be
forgotten while the English language lives. But it is the tragical
ending of the day that men think of most. Those three hours and a
quarter in the grim death-chamber where, surrounded by wounded,
Nelson lay dying, his last words in two sentences expressing all
that has ever been written of the private littleness and the public
greatness of his life: "Remember that I leave Lady Hamilton and my
daughter Horatia as a legacy to my country. Thank God, I have done
my duty."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 96</p>-->

<p>Trafalgar, though the last great naval battle, was by no means
the end of the fighting; frigate actions and small sea-fights were
still frequent enough, and Cochrane, fresh from his release from a
French prison, in the 38-gun frigate <i>Pallas</i>, made, in the
year 1806, a chapter of war history of his own.</p>

<p>In 1808, we were fighting the Russians, the Turks, and the
Danes, while the French still kept our navy on the alert, right up
to the eve of Waterloo. The war with America broke out in 1812, the
main cause of it being our assertion of the right to search
American ships for deserters, driven to the crime by our own
neglect and ill-treatment of them. The actions were nearly all
fought between single ships, or small squadrons, and there is no
doubt that our ships were outclassed by the Americans, and that
their best gunners were the men who had fought on our side at the
Nile, at Copenhagen, and at Trafalgar; it was even asserted that
among the seamen on one of the American ships were some of the crew
of Nelson's barge, and certainly 5000 English deserters were known
to be in the American Navy when the war broke out.</p>

<p>Our one great success was in the action between the
<i>Shannon</i> and the <i>Chesapeake</i>. The details of that
engagement have been discussed and argued about more times in
English and American books and magazines, than any other battle
that was ever fought. It will be remembered that Captain Broke
being severely wounded, and the first lieutenant killed, the second
lieutenant broucfht the victorious <i>Shannon</i> out of action,
and sailed her and her prize to Halifax. This officer was Admiral
of the Fleet, Provo Wallis, who died so recently as 1892, in a
Hampshire village, close to a spot where the blood-stained timbers
of the <i>Chesapeake</i> can still be seen. After the battle she
was sailed to Portsmouth, and there sold for £500 to a shipbreaker.
Her timbers were distributed, and a great part of them bought by a
builder, who built them into a flour-mill at Wickham, 9 miles from
Portsmouth. The floors of that mill still show the stains of the
fight, and the beams that support the floorboards are full of shot
holes.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 97</p>-->

<p>Not so well remembered are the circumstances of our last
sea-fight with the French, fought in the Mediterranean on the eve
of Waterloo, between the 18-gun English brig of war <i>Pilot</i>
and the 22-gun French frigate <i>La Legere</i>. Captain John Toup
Nicholas, the commander of the <i>Pilot</i>, in his despatch thus
describes the fight:&mdash;</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 98</p>-->

<p class="newspaper">"At daylight, on the 17th June 1815, a frigate
was observed which, from not answering our signals, I concluded to
be an enemy. I approached her until I could see her waterline from
the deck, then, having ascertained that she had only twelve ports
of a side on the main deck, I thought she was not more than a match
for the <i>Pilot</i>, consequently did my best to get alongside of
her. At two in the afternoon, the stranger having taken in all his
small sails, and apparently prepared for action, he hauled towards
us and fired a gun to windward, hoisting a tri-coloured pendant and
ensign. Half-an-hour later, after some manoeuvring on both sides to
endeavour to gain the weather gage, I placed the <i>Pilot</i> close
on his weather beam, and hoisted our colours. Observing that he was
preparing to make sail to pass us, and an officer having hailed in
a menacing tone, desiring me 'to keep further from him,' and his
people continuing to train their guns at us, I ordered a shot to be
fired through his foresail to stop his progress. The flash of our
gun proved the signal for the general discharge of his broadside.
The action then commenced within pistol range. Our shot being from
the lee-guns, and directed low, evidently striking his hull in
quick succession, and his disabling our rigging greatly. By four
o'clock the fire of our opponents had slackened considerably, and I
sanguinely looked and expected every instant to see the
tri-coloured ensign hauled down. After two hours he hauled up his
mainsail, and backed his mizzentopsail in order to drop astern. I
endeavoured to shorten sail also, to retain our position on his
beam, but I found every brace, bowline, and clue-garnet cut away.
We thus unavoidably ran ahead of him, and as the only alternative I
then put the helm up to rake his bows, of which he took the
immediate advantage by hauling close to the wind, and making off
with all the sail he could carry. With deep regret I saw that I had
it not in my power to follow him immediately, the yards being
wholly unmanageable, the main topgallant mast over the side, the
main topsail yard shot away in the slings, and our stays, and the
greater part of our standing and all our running rigging gone. Thus
situated, it was some time before we could secure the masts and
yards, so as to follow the French ship; however, in less than an
hour we had another main topsail yard across, and the sails set,
and by seven o'clock we were going nearly 7 knots, by the wind, in
chase of our opponent, with the hope of forcing him to a renewal of
the contest. He was then on our weather bow, distant from us about
six miles. We continued in pursuit until the 18th, at daylight,
when it was with real sorrow I discovered that the enemy had eluded
us during the night, and as we were near to Antibes, I concluded
that she must have got into some port thereabouts. The wind being
fresh from the wrong quarter, and not having any hope of again
meeting the object of our pursuit, I most reluctantly steered to
resume my station."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 99</p>-->

<p>In the fight two seamen were killed, and fourteen officers and
men wounded; the enemy's loss, as was ascertained afterwards, was
twenty-two killed and seventy-nine wounded.</p>

<p>From the outbreak of war in 1803 till Waterloo we lost 83
frigates captured, and 7 destroyed, and no line of battle ships.
Our enemies during that period were the French, Spanish, Dutch,
Danes, Russians, Turks, and Americans, and their united losses
amounted to 173 ships of the line and frigates captured or
destroyed, of which loi were added to the English navy.</p>

<p>With Waterloo ended that state of war which has been aptly
termed "eighteen hundred and war time." It is impossible to
conceive such conditions now. After the twenties a boat action with
pirates or with slavers was something to talk over in the village
ale-houses, but before then these small affairs were of such common
occurrence that the prints of the time scarce gave them a
half-dozen lines of space. Turn up at random the Portsmouth and
Plymouth reports or the <i>Gazette</i> letters anywhere between
1803 and 1816 and fights are reported as frequently, and in as
matter of course a fashion, as are cricket and football matches now
in a sporting newspaper. And it must be remembered that no sailor
could dodge fighting, even though he might escape the press and
ship on board a merchantman. The merchant skippers generally showed
a good stomach for an encounter with any enemy who was in the least
degree near them in weight of metal. Even the very passengers
showed a readiness to take a hand that must have put heart into the
least warlike of merchant seamen. Here, for example, are one or two
incidents taken at random from contemporary prints:&mdash;</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 100</p>-->

<p>The ship <i>Planter</i> of Liverpool, bound from Hampton Roads
to London, was in 1799 nearing the mouth of the channel, when she
was chased and overtaken by a French privateer. Finding that he
could not escape, the skipper of the <i>Planter</i> backed his main
topsail, ran up the British ensign, cleared for action, and called
upon the crew to give three cheers. The <i>Planter's</i> armament
was 12 nine-pounders and 6 six-pounders, her crew forty-three men.
The privateer had 22 guns, twelves, nines, and sixes, with small
arms in the tops, and her decks were crowdded with men. When she
saw the little merchantman heave to, and heard the cheer, the cool
impudence of the Englishman so astonished the other that he just
popped one of his twelve-pound shots across the bows of the
merchantman, expecting an instant surrender in the face of such an
imperative warning. But the privateer was soon undeceived.
According to the skipper of the <i>Planter</i>:&mdash;</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 101</p>-->

<p>"We immediately rounded to and gave her a broadside, which
commenced the action on both sides. The first broadside we received
cut away all our halliards, topsail sheets, and braces, and killed
three men on the quarterdeck. We kept up a constant fire for two
glasses and a half, when she sheered off to repair damages, and in
about one glass returned to board us. We were all in readiness to
receive him, got our broadsides to bear upon him, and poured in our
langrage and grape shot with great success. A heavy fire kept up on
both sides for three glasses this second time; in all, the
engagement continued for five glasses. At last he found we would
not give out, and night coming on, sheered off and stood away. His
loss, no doubt, was considerable, as for the last two glasses we
were so nigh each other that our fire must have done great
execution. When he sheered off we saw him heaving dead bodies
overboard in abundance. Our ship is damaged in the hull; one
twelve-pound shot under the starboard cat-head splintered the sides
much; one double-headed shot through the long boat; sails, rigging,
spars, prodigiously injured. We had four killed, and eight wounded.
My ship's company acted with a degree of courage which does credit
to the flag. I cannot help mentioning the good conduct of my
passengers during the action. Mr M'Kennon and Mr Hodgson, with
small arms, stood to their quarters with a degree of noble spirit;
my two lady passengers, Mrs M'Dowell and Miss Mary Harley, kept
conveying the cartridges from the magazine to the deck, and were
very attentive to the wounded, both during and after the action, in
dressing their wounds and administering every comfort the ship
could afford."</p>

<p>When the <i>Planter</i> got into port, the merchants of
Liverpool subscribed a sum of money for the two ladies who had
behaved with such courage, and a local print reports that they also
set on foot inquiry for the parents of one "William Aickin, a
native of that town, who was killed in the action, after
signalising himself in the most exemplary manner."</p>

<p>Early in the conflict he received two wounds, one of which
almost separated his hand from the arm, notwithstanding which,
without any other assistance than the application of some styptic
and a bandage by Mrs M'Dowell and her companion, he returned to his
station and continued his exertion in defence of the ship till he
fell in a manner covered with wounds from a broadside too
successfully directed by the adversary. He was then carried below,
where he expired, in a few minutes, after requesting Mrs M'Dowell
to convey his duty to his parents, and to let them know that "he
died in a good cause."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 102</p>-->

<p>On the 4th July 1799 the <i>Townley</i> of Liverpool, a small
merchantman, was captured by a French privateer of 14 guns. The
privateer took out all the English seamen except the mate and one
other, and put a prize crew of six men on board, with orders to
take the prize into the nearest French port. As soon as the
privateer was out of sight, the two Englishmen seized an
opportunity to make prisoners of three Frenchmen who were below,
then rushed on deck and secured the other three, headed the ship
for an English port, and brought her in in safety.</p>

<p>In the same year a West Indiaman, the <i>Benson</i>, beat off a
French corvette that had attempted her capture; while the <i>Earl
St Vincent</i>, a Falmouth schooner, engaged two French privateers
and four Spanish gunboats off Cape Spartel. The Frenchmen were
vessels mounting from 8 to 12 guns, and having from sixty to eighty
men each. The English schooner was fitted for privateering, having
18 guns, though they were only four- and six-pounders, and her crew
numbered only 40 men. Surrounded by six vessels, the Englishman was
getting the worst of it, and the report states: "Finding it useless
to contend with such superior forces, he ordered his stern and
quarters to be cut, and made a battery of his stern chace, from
which he kept up a constant fire on the enemy, making at the same
time all the sail he could to reach Tangier Bay, which he did after
an action, in the whole, of five hours and a quarter."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 103</p>-->

<p>Even so far away as in the South Seas, our merchant seamen were
carrying on the war. The South Sea whalemen were nearly all
provided with letters of marque, and before the port of Sydney was
twenty years old a prize court was sitting in it to dispose of
prizes captured by whalers from the Spaniards and the Dutch.</p>

<p>For example, in 1799, the whalers made prizes of a couple of
Spaniards, and Captain Hunter, then Governor of New South Wales,
wrote to England explaining certain precautions he had taken in
mounting guns on Sydney Heads, when, as he expected, the enemy
would make reprisals. The Spaniards were duly condemned and sold in
the prize court, and no more was heard of the matter, although one
of them, the <i>Infanta Amelia</i>, was a fine new vessel not long
launched from the Spanish dockyard at Bilbao.</p>

<p>Another interesting privateering affair in Australian waters was
the capture by the <i>Policy</i> of the Dutch privateer
<i>Swift</i>. The <i>Swift</i> was originally <i>La Minerve</i>, a
French privateer which by her captures of English merchantmen in
the English Channel had become quite famous. Then she was sold to
the Dutch, and in 1804 was owned by a Batavian firm.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 104</p>-->

<p>She fell in with the <i>Policy</i>, a South Sea whaler, in
September 1804, off Timor, and being well armed, imagined it would
be easy to take the Englishman. Captain Forster of the
<i>Policy</i>, thinking the Dutchman was too big for him, tried to
run away, but the <i>Swift</i> overhauled the <i>Policy</i>, so the
Englishman turned about, and in the course of an hour's fighting
thrashed the Dutchman, and a few days later brought her to an
anchor as his prize in Sydney Harbour.</p>

<p>When the <i>Policy</i> was on her way to Sydney, she fell in
with the <i>Iris</i>, another South Sea whaler, and cautioned her
to be on the look out for Dutch privateers, as the Batavian
merchants had fitted out several vessels with the express intention
of driving the Englishmen out of the Dutch Archipelago. "Very
well," said Captain Clark of the <i>Iris</i>, "I will be on the
look out for them, and if I fall in with any Dutchmen, I know
who'll have to go." A day or two later, when off the Island of
Omba, sure enough, the <i>Iris</i> sighted a privateer nearly twice
her size and' complement of crew and guns. Then Clark called upon
his men to support him, and stood right down to the Dutchmen. The
rest of the story I will quote from a contemporary report in the
<i>Sydney Gazette</i> of 1804. "Captain Clark gave chace, and in a
few hours coming up, commenced engaging. Impatient to decide a
contest in which her weight of metal was overmatched, the
<i>Iris</i> ran aboard of her antagonist, and must have carried her
had not her complement of men been also most unequal. An incessant
fire of musketry from the Batavian, which the <i>Iris</i> was not
sufficiently manned to answer, forced the people to shelter beneath
her bulwarks, but her brave commander maintained his post and, deaf
to the entreaties of his people, gloriously fell, covered with
wounds and bathed in his blood. Then the chief officer took charge
of the <i>Iris</i>, and, seeing that it was futile to continue the
contest, made sail from the enemy and succeeded in escaping."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 105</p>-->

<p>The bombardment of Algiers in 1816 gave the old sailors of the
French war a last chance to smell powder burnt in earnest. The
expedition was under the command of Lord Exmouth who, as Sir Edward
Pellew, had in the previous wars become famous as a fighting man.
Five sail of the line, five frigates and twelve bomb vessels and
brigs of war were put under his command, and the Dutch, wishing to
take part in destroying the Barbary pirates, who for generations
had been a danger to merchants of all nations, joined the
expedition with a fleet of four frigates and two sloops of war.</p>

<p>Although this expedition was against an uncivilised power, it
was one of the hardest fought naval battles of the century, leaving
out, of course, the great actions of the French war. The
bombardment opened at half-past two in the afternoon and lasted
nearly twelve hours. The total British loss was 128 killed and 690
wounded, and the Dutch had 32 killed and 50 wounded.</p>

<p>The reduction of Algiers released many unfortunate Christians,
whose stories of their slavery would, if such were needed, be an
ample justification of this "little war." A youth, named Dupont, at
the age of 15, was a groom in the service of the Count d'Artois,
and followed that nobleman to the siege of Gibraltar.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 106</p>-->

<p>Having joined a vessel conveying orders to Count d'Estaing, he
was wrecked on the coast of Africa and carried prisoner to the
Algerians, where he was kept a slave thirty-four years, working
during that time yoked to a plough. When the English bombarded the
city, he was among the released prisoners, and was sent home to his
own country. At the same time, an Englishman, belonging to
Brighton, who had been twenty-six years a prisoner, was restored to
his home. During his absence, three fields of which he was the
owner had been sold, and part of the Pavilion and some other
buildings erected upon them.</p>

<p>In 1827 the combined English, French, and Russian squadron
destroyed the Turkish fleet at Navarino with a loss to the allies
of 177 killed and 480 wounded, of whom the British lost 75 killed
and 197 wounded. In 1840 we bombarded Acre. Our squadron included
the <i>Cyclops</i> and the <i>Gorgon</i> paddle steamers, and this
is the first occasion in our war history on which steamers were
engaged. There were about five-and-twenty ships employed, from the
<i>Princess Charlotte</i> of 104 guns down to brigs of war, but
only two steamers. Sir Robert Stopford, who was in command of the
squadron, was ordered to support the Syrians in their endeavours to
expel the troops of Mehemet Ali. This little war cost us 12 killed
and 32 wounded.</p>

<p>In 1842, and again in 1856, we were at war with China, while the
Indian Mutiny saw our fleet landing seamen and marines, and taking
such active part in its suppression, that the Naval Brigade, under
Peel, by 1858 had won for itself the right, which it has ever since
kept, to a considerable space in our war story.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 107</p>-->

<p>But there were to be no more big naval battles during this
century. The historians of the Crimea generously make the most of
the services of the Naval Brigade, but, in spite of their
endeavours, they cannot glorify the achievements of our fleets in
the Baltic and the Black Sea. Six months before the war a review
was held at Spithead, when the newspapers gave a full account of
the tremendous might of England.</p>

<p>The fleet reviewed consisted of 7 screw line of battle ships,
their speed varying from a fraction over 10 knots an hour to 7
knots; 3 sailing line of battle ships, 4 screw frigates, speed 10
knots to 7 knots; 4 screw sloops, 10 knots to 6 knots; and one
paddle corvette of 9 knots. The tonnage of the <i>Duke of
Wellington</i>, then the pride of the service, was 3771, and 980
was her horse power; she was armed with 131 guns. The rest of the
vessels were from 3000 tons to 1000, and their horse power was from
600 down to 300, and that of the paddle corvette was only 60.</p>

<p>When the first division of the Baltic Fleet was on the eve of
sailing from Portsmouth in March 1854, Sir Charles Napier, in the
course of a reply to an address presented by the mayor of the town,
said, "I warn you not to expect too much. The fleet is a new one,
the system of warfare is new; great consideration is required to
ascertain how it is best to manage a fleet urged by steam."</p>

<p>This fleet comprised 8 screw line of battle ships and 4 screw
and 4 paddlewheel frigates and sloops, and included the earliest
and latest specimens of ship-building. The <i>Duke of
Wellington</i>, the flagship, was new, the <i>Royal George</i> was
built in 1827, and the <i>Amphion</i> and <i>Arrogant</i> were two
of the first ships to be converted into steamers, and were only
eight years old.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 108</p>-->

<p>The <i>Tribune</i>, a paddle steamer, was the newest vessel,
having been launched at Sheerness only a few months before. The
strength of the whole fleet represented 7570 horse power, and when
the second division sailed later, the whole Baltic Fleet of 44
vessels represented only 16,000 horse power. In this fleet many of
the crew had never been to sea before they were enlisted, the new
system of continuous service had not been more than a couple of
years in existence, and we had not trained enough men in the time
to go round. But though it was expected that to carry on the war we
should soon have the old bounty and impressment systems in full
swing, sufficient volunteers came forward, and for the first time
in our sea history our ships went into action manned without
recourse to the old methods.</p>

<p>A year after the war broke out, sailing ships were replaced by
steamers. Ten years later, iron-clad steamers were not novelties,
so that the Crimean war, in the middle of the century, very clearly
marks the boundary between the old and the new navy in the ships
and the personnel of the service. The bombardment of Sebastopol
demonstrated that wooden ships with the guns of the
time&mdash;sixty-eight pounders at the heaviest&mdash;were worse
than useless against the forts with their long range and heavy
artillery.</p>

<p>The story of the American Civil War, and the doings of the
<i>Merrimac</i> and <i>Monitor</i> has been told often enough; our
first experience with the new class of ships and weapons was in
1877, in the affair between the <i>Shah</i> and <i>Amethyst</i>
against the Peruvian rebel iron-clad turret ship, the
<i>Huascar</i>. She carried 2 three-hundred pounders and 3 shell
guns; the <i>Shah</i> was an unarmoured vessel, but she was armed
with 2 twelve-ton and 16 six-and-a-half ton guns, and after three
hours blazing at one another at ranges from 400 to 3000 yards, no
material damage was done to the hulls of either of the vessels, and
the Peruvian got away under cover of the night.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 109</p>-->

<p>In the suppression of the slave trade, our navy has been
continually engaged all through the century, and many brilliant
boat actions have been fought between bluejackets and slavers.
Writing from Kingston, Jamaica, in 1857, on the capture of a slaver
by the pinnace of H.M.S. <i>Arab</i>, a correspondent of an English
newspaper said that on an average two vessels a week left Africa
with slaves on board, varying in number from 500 to 700, and that
owing to the smallness of the vessels&mdash;about 140-ton
schooners&mdash;a couple of hundred of the poor wretches died on
each voyage. In the 130-ton vessel captured by the <i>Arab</i>,
there were 370 slaves, and 170 of them had died on the trip. In
1845, a Spanish slaver was captured off Lagos by the <i>Wasp</i>,
and a prize crew was put on board. When the vessels parted company,
the Spaniards suddenly rose on the Englishmen and murdered eleven
of them including the young officer in charge. Soon afterwards
another English cruiser fell in with the vessel and retook her, and
brought the murderers to England, where they were tried, and seven
of them hanged at Exeter.</p>

<p>The bombardment of Alexandria in July 1882 by eight of what were
then modern battleships, and six smaller vessels, is the only
modern experience of war our navy has had, and so rapid have the
changes been, that most of the eight ships that took part in that
invasion are now ranked as non-effective. Yet so great was the
change in the armament in the less than thirty years that elapsed
between Sebastopol and Alexandria, that our ships stood off at long
ranges, and with their 81-ton, 25-ton, and 18-ton guns, destroyed
the forts, with the trifling loss to us of six killed and about
five-and-twenty wounded.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 110</p>-->

<p>During the action, the men of the navy made the most of their
small opportunities, and gave a comforting assurance that under new
conditions of service the old spirit existed. Lord Charles
Beresford ran his little gunboat, the <i>Condor</i>, close up to
one of the forts, and by good shooting silenced two very annoying
ten-inch guns; and Mr Harding, the gunner of the <i>Alexandra</i>,
hearing that a live shell had fallen on the deck of his ship, ran
up from below, extinguished the fuse, and threw the shell into a
tub of water, for which gallant deed he was given the Victoria
Cross.</p>

<p>In our little wars the Naval Brigade has been continually
employed of late years, and the service of the marines unexcelled
<i>per mare per terram</i>. In the attempt to relieve Gordon in
1885, the Naval Brigade particularly distinguished itself, and
there is one incident in that campaign, that for its gallantry will
long be remembered to the honour of the new service. Lord Charles
Beresford, in the Nile steamer <i>Sofia</i>, on his way to the
relief of Sir Charles Wilson and party, who had been wrecked, and
were encamped on an island up the river, encountered a very severe
fire from the banks, and one of the shots at last went through the
boiler. For many hours the steamer remained under fire, gallantly
defended by the bluejackets, the marines, and a party of mounted
infantry, who had been specially chosen by Beresford to accompany
him.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 111</p>-->

<p>Then, when the boiler cooled, Mr Benbow, the chief engineer, set
to to repair it. What this work meant can be judged by the fact
that it took ten hours to accomplish, and Mr Benbow had to shape
the plate, bore the holes in plate and boiler, and fit the screws
and nuts, almost entirely with his own hands, as every one of his
assistants had been severely scalded by the explosion. Lord Charles
Beresford accomplished his object successfully, owing to his own
splendid energy and resourcefulness, and to the courage, coolness,
and skill of those under him. This incident&mdash;not by any means
the only noteworthy one that has occurred in modern times&mdash;has
a cheering significance to us. Sometimes, perhaps, we do in our
heart of hearts have slight misgivings as to whether steam and
steel is not a dangerous leveller. We won battles once, we think,
because our men were handy in getting aloft, and our sail trimmers
could box the yards about in such smart fashion as is only possible
to a Sea Race. How, now that the days of oak and hemp have gone,
will fare the Sea Race? Mr Benbow&mdash;significant name for such a
man to bear&mdash;shaping boiler plates and fitting screws and nuts
on board the crippled <i>Sofia</i>, did in manner very satisfying,
go a long way towards answering this question.</p>

<p>While this book is going through the press, the newspapers of
the world are recording how much the intelligence, skill, and
common-sense of naval officers, and the energy and good training of
their men, have done in South Africa towards mitigating the
scandalous administrative blunders that have so hampered the sister
service.</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI. THE GROWTH OF OUR SEA
CARRYING.</h2>

<h3>Whalers&mdash;"Geordie" Colliers and American Packet
Ships&mdash;The Old-Fashioned Trader and the New&mdash;Emigrant
Ships and Ocean Liners&mdash;Tea and Wool Clippers and Modern Cargo
Steamers.</h3>

<p>Early in the century our ocean traders assembled in fleets, and
East Indiamen or West Indiamen by hundreds lay in the Downs or at
Spithead, sometimes for weeks together, waiting for convoy or for
fair wind. With the peace, of course, the need of convoy no longer
hampered the movements of ships, but it was late in the fifties
before colonial developments, steam, and the abolition of
monopolies, together combined to lay the foundation of present
conditions. For more than fifty years of the century the East India
Company monopolised the trade of the East, for more than fifty
years the Hudson's Bay Company controlled the trade of the British
possessions in North America. Rival companies were formed to
compete with the India Company, but it reformed itself so as to
swallow them; and the Hudson's Bay Company by the end of the
thirties, so far from being injured by rivalry, extended its
agencies across the Continent from Labrador to British
Columbia.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 113</p>-->

<p>The coal trade and the fisheries were, as has been often said,
the nurseries of our seamen, and more sailors were trained in
"Geordie" colliers than in all other branches of the sea-carrying
trade together. The colliers, though lacking in beauty, and
justifying the American description of them: "Stem and starn sawed
off square like a sugar-box," were faithfully built&mdash;there are
vessels afloat to-day that were launched when the century was in
its teens. Not only in the coal trade, but in the Baltic and the
Mediterranean, such vessels did the bulk of our carrying, and it is
only during the last decade that steam has so gained the ascendancy
as to bring the last day of the last sailing-ship within measurable
distance.</p>

<p>One important branch of the sea trade was whaling&mdash;steadily
declining now, and destined, probably before many years have
elapsed, to die. The price of whale oil has so fallen, owing to the
use of other illuminants, that it scarcely pays to obtain it; and
though whalebone has risen in price from £25 per ton early in the
century to £2500 a ton at the close, the scarcity of the right
whale has had the result of leaving the trade none the better off,
for the average price of oil is not a fourth of what it was in the
heyday of the industry.</p>

<p>From Hull, in 1814, no fewer than 58 whalers sailed for the
Greenland and Davis Straits Fisheries; and from Dundee, Peterhead,
and Aberdeen the whaling fleets in the four years 1814-18 made 192
voyages, catching 1682 whales. By the time that steam-whaling began
in 1858, the right whales of the north and the sperm whales of the
southern fisheries were growing scarce, and now statistics show
that it is not unusual for a whole fleet to make a loss on the
season's whaling. What a pride they used to take in the old
whale-ships, and what rivalry there was between Aberdeen, and
Peterhead, and Dundee. The Editor of the <i>Dundee Advertiser</i>
of forty years ago wrote in his paper:</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Ours is a small but very efficient fleet;
five of the craft cost on an average £15,000 each, and the total
value of the 8 ships is about equal to that of the 28 owned by our
friends of Peterhead."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 114</p>-->

<p>The Dundee whaling fleet in 1861 consisted of 6 steam-vessels
and 2 sailing-ships, varying from 660 tons to 325 tons. In the
sailing days the ships were painted in gay colours, and flew red
and green and blue ribbons from their mast-heads, some whalemen
taking special pride in green and black hulls, or painted ports
with imitation guns sticking through them. But steam altered all
this, and black paint everywhere to hide the dirt of coal smoke
took the place of former brightness.</p>

<p>What catches they made, and what disappointments they met with!
In 1855 the gross produce of 27 Peterhead whalers exceeded in value
£125,000, and for three years following averaged more than £70,000
a year; while in the same year the Dundee ships only averaged £600
each, and were so discouraged that in the following season they
only sent out 3 ships, and when these three came home, each brought
cargo worth more than £10,000. In the decade 1850 to 1860, the
whalers earned for the Scotch ports to which they belonged upwards
of a million sterling. The Hull Greenlanders and whalemen from
other ports in the North of Enerland were as srood men, and sailed
in as good ships as ever left the Scotch ports. Those famous
whalers and Arctic explorers, the Scoresbys, father and son, in the
ten years they sailed the <i>Resolution</i>, from Whitby, between
1803-13, earned for the owners £70,077, which made a clear profit
for the proprietor, on an original advance of £8000, of £20,718.
But it is probable the Americans were more skilful than the British
North Sea whalers, and it is certain that they were, and are, far
cleverer than our South Seamen, while the South Sea Islanders, who
were largely employed in the boats, after a short training were
infinitely better than any Europeans.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 115</p>-->

<p>Portuguese were the best harpooners afloat, though they were
little good in any other work except steering. I saw an instance of
the truth of this in a sailing-ship in the Indian Ocean some time
in the seventies. A school of fish played round the bows as the
vessel lay almost becalmed; they were bonito or albacore, or some
deep-water fish of the kind, and the whole ship's company spent
hours trying to catch them with hooks and lines, but in vain.
Thereupon some one suggested an attempt with the <i>grains</i>, a
trident with barbed points, but when the sailors one after another
had tried their hands at this without spearing a single fish,
"Portugee Joe" was relieved from the wheel where he nearly always
was, for steering was the sum of his knowledge of seamanship. He
went forward and watched the fishing, then said: "Give me zee
grains, I will catch zee feesh for you." Taking the weapon, he
arranged for himself a comfortable position in the bowsprit
rigging, and in a couple of hours had landed on the deck nearly a
hundred fish. He never missed a fish and there were so many that
all hands for a week afterwards were suffering from some mild form
of fish poisoning&mdash;over-eating themselves,
probably&mdash;though the moon rays falling on the fish, as the
catch was slung in rows along the deck, was said by the old salts
to be the cause of the trouble.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 116</p>-->

<p>Sperm whaling in the South Seas is now practically dead,
although it was at one time the principal sea trade of Sydney, for
the export of oil was a greater source of prosperity than that of
wool. Enderby, a well-known London shipowner, leased from the
Imperial Government, in the forties, the Auckland Islands, using
them as a station for the whale and seal fisheries, and Enderby's
vessels were in the South Seas twenty years before the century
opened. The Americans were there as soon, or before, and American
whale ships are now doing what little whaling there is. Herman
Melville has well described the life, and Mr Bullen has recently
written an entertaining book on the subject. The cruising grounds
extended north and west to the Sandwich Islands and the coast of
Japan, and south to New Zealand.</p>

<p>Convict transports on their way to Australia carried whaling
gear in their holds, and when the ships had discharged their
freights of misery, "departed for the fisheries." Some sporadic and
desultory experiments conducted by one or two vessels before the
century opened, developed, twenty years later, to such an extent
that Enderby found himself contending with any number of rivals,
and by 1852 American and Australian owned whale-ships, drove him
out of the trade, and the Auckland Islands were abandoned. Hobart,
Tasmania, or Hobart-Town, as it was then called, was up to the
sixties a head centre of the trade, and the long-shore men on the
banks of the Derwent talked oil and blubber just as a New South
Welshman talked wool and sheep.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 117</p>-->

<p>A year or two ago in Hobart I was shown in a ship-chandler's
shop the present state of the fisheries. "Much whaling nowadays,
eh?" said the proprietor of the store. "Come wuth me, I'll show
you," He led me to a room at the back of the premises where lay
dozens of coils of silky manila line, heaps of harpoons, bombguns,
lances, and all the other gear familiar to readers of whaling
yarns. "There," said he, "there's £600 or £700 worth of gear; if
you could find a purchaser for it at the price of old iron, I'd be
satisfied." Whaling, as I have said, is a branch of the sea trade
that is disappearing altogether, but it is, I think, the only one;
in all others the whole system of carrying is changed, but the
carrying goes on multiplied by many hundreds.</p>

<p>The China tea trade is an example: the China tea clipper has
disappeared, and the wool clipper will soon be as much a thing of
the past as the old-fashioned Atlantic packet ship; in place of the
tea and wool clippers we have fine fast steamers, and every one now
speaks and thinks of the Atlantic steamer service as a huge ferry.
The packet ships went first, driven out in our fathers' time, but
quite young men can remember the last of the China tea clippers.
The ocean race home with the first of the season's teas, between
the fifties and the seventies, was talked of and written about, as
much as, and was more interesting to read of than, Atlantic
greyhound records. The Americans cut in at it, and there was great
rivalrv between the builders of both countries, thousands of pounds
in bets and offers of prizes sometimes depending on the result of a
race between American and English ships&mdash;the honours, on the
whole, being pretty equally divided.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 118</p>-->

<p>The race of 1868&mdash;an ocean race of 13,000 miles between 40
of the finest clippers of the world&mdash;was an event to be
remembered. The ships all sailed from Foo-Choo-Foo or neighbouring
ports within a space of twenty-five days, their cargoes averaging
from a million to a million and a half pounds of tea, and the
ships, famous in previous and later voyages, all got into port
within a few hours of each other, allowing for the difference in
their time of sailing. The <i>Spindrift</i> made the quickest
passage&mdash;ninety-four days; the <i>Ariel</i>, the
<i>Taeping</i>, the <i>Sir Lancelot</i>, the <i>Serica</i>, and the
<i>Fiery Cross</i>, all famous ships, were not far behind. This was
the first year in which there was no money prize to be gained by
winning the race, as had been the custom in former times, but the
skippers were influenced by no sordid motives, and they drove their
ships for all they were worth. My friend John Arthur Barry, who was
on board of one of these clippers in this very race, has thus
pictured a scene off the Cape of Good Hope:&mdash;</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 119</p>-->

<p>"To windward a limitless expanse of greenish-grey, mingled here
and there with tufts and curls of white, seethes, rolls, and dashes
itself in thunderous billows against the good ship, then in foiled
fury crawls snarling away to leeward in broken masses of white
foam. Aloft, three swelling patches of dirty white appear to hang
against the lowering sky in the dim light of that Southern evening;
these are the three reefed topsails of the Ymig-Tze; listen to the
shrill voice of the blast as it howls in and around their bosoms,
stretched like iron from the sharply braced-up yards, or whistles
and hums through the running gear as if it were playing on some
immense Aeolian harp.</p>

<p>"Swish-swosh, with a loud roar at intervals, comes a green sea
over the bows, falling in a glittering cascade across the break of
the forecastle, then rushing irresistibly away aft. The tall masts
creak and groan and sway and bend, as the vessel now throws her
bows high in the air, now brings them down with a sounding thump;
one moment riding on the summit of an abyss deep and narrow, in
another with a long, swift, sickening slide, plunged to its very
bottom enclosed by the threatening and lofty walls of foam-flecked
water.</p>

<p>"Run your eye now along the weather bulwarks, and you will see,
through the gloom, two or three black knots, looking for all the
world like some ocean fungi that have attached themselves to the
ship's rail, so motionless and without sign of life are they,
except that every now and again from the midst of one of the black
knots flies a red spark away down to foaming, hissing leeward.
These are groups of the watch on deck; the largest one seems to be
opposite to where a bright gleam from a crack in the closed door of
the galley throws a flickering pencil of light athwart the wet
deck, and is feebly reflected from shining oilskins and dripping
sou'-westers. Four men are holding on by some of the running gear.
Two of them are smoking, and now and again their weather-beaten,
salt-encrusted faces are lit up under their sou'-westers by the red
spark of light from the mouths of their short pipes. They seem
absorbed in silent contemplation, their gaze only turning from the
sea out to leeward to the topsails overhead."*</p>

<!--<p class="a">Page 120</p>-->

<p>Presently the captain comes leisurely on deck and takes a look
aloft and then to windward. The officer of the watch is making his
first voyage in a tea clipper, and now he thinks at last will come
the order to call all hands to shorten sail. But the captain turns
quietly towards him and says: "Shake out the reefs in the topsails,
Mr Blank, and set the main-topgallant-sail!"</p>

<p>The opening of the Suez Canal and the progress of steam, from
the seventies, drove many of these clippers into the Australian
wool trade, and steamers took up the running. But even they
continued to race, and in a more expensive fashion, for a steamer,
after making two or three voyages, was often eclipsed by a rival,
and had to be taken off the trade, and a new and faster vessel put
in her place. This kind of racing drove at least one firm of
shipowners into private life. The tea race still goes on, some of
the finest steamers afloat being in this service, but there is less
excitement about it now, owing to the common-sense, modern view, of
looking at a high average of results rather than one remarkably
smart passage.</p>

<p>The wool clippers were no less famous than the tea clippers.
They sailed from London, usually with a valuable general cargo, and
the name and performances of every ship were known then to most
Australians; for these were the vessels that brought from home many
of the best and most useful class of colonists. And many a "leading
citizen," or proprietor of thousands of acres of sheep-lands, with
a family of young colonials now writing regularly to English
cousins they have never seen, came out "first cabin" in one or
other of these ships. These old colonists look down the shipping
news in the pajaers to-day, and catching sight of a familiar
name&mdash;now, alas! sailing under the Norwegian or German
flag&mdash;remember that time, thirty or more years ago, when they
first saw Sydney Heads from the deck of the <i>Salamis</i>, the
<i>Windsor Castle</i>, or the <i>Ocean Queen</i>.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 121</p>-->

<p>The ships raced out around the Cape of Good Hope, and often did
the passage as quickly as the earlier steamers; then loading wool,
screwed into their holds so that a cockroach could scarcely find a
space between the bales or the deck beams, raced round Cape Horn
back to London again to catch the sales. Well manned and well found
in every respect were these ships, and their skippers carried on
sail till the canvas blew from the bolt ropes, or the good spars
bending almost double could no longer stand the strain, and,
snapping, left a tangle of wreckage to clear away, giving the
youngsters lessons in the mysteries of rigging, now not
obtainable.</p>

<p>But to the shipmasters and strong-handed ships of those days, a
few sails or spars more or less meant nothing. Freights were high,
and owners liberal with respect to stores; also they encouraged
their captains to make fast passages by the offer of handsome
premiums. The vessels, too, were, in many cases, elaborately fitted
up to carry passengers in two or even three classes; and when
steamers often took fifty days to come out, and a clipper rattled
along at her heels in seventy-three, the advertisement covered the
cost of a lot of gear.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 122</p>-->

<p>A pleasant sight it was to see the spacious saloon of an A I
clipper, in fine weather, with its soft carpet and easy chairs and
lounges, ferns and flowers, pictures and piano; and at meal times
the well-appointed table, with the old skipper at its head, stout
and bluff and weather-beaten, doing the honours of the ship
generally, with one of the handsomest lady passengers at each side
of him. Then, when the soft warm trades blew the huge pyramid of
shining canvas along with everything set from her skysails down,
"bonnets" on her top sails, "save-alls," "watersails," and other
contrivances for holding wind, whose very names are now almost
forgotten, swelling out here and there about her, it was almost
like yacht sailing.</p>

<p>Not so pleasant, perhaps, when the "Old Man" was "sending her"
close hauled into a head sea; fiddles on the table, wash-boards at
the saloon doors, the carpets rolled up, stewards falling in heaps
to the sound of broken crockery; boys baling out boats, and green
combers popping their crests over the fo'c's'le head, and roaring
away right aft to the break of the poop. Not over and above
pleasant, of course, but even then better than any floating steam
coffee palace that was ever built! And now there are no ships like
unto them, nor ever will be any more. The cargo carrier of to-day
is simply a huge iron or steel box, with three or four iron or
steel sticks stuck into her, and an iron or steel spike protruding
from her nondescript bows in place of the stout bowsprit and long,
lancing, graceful jib-boom of the old clipper. Her stowage capacity
must be enormous to counteract the low freight; and the last idea
in her skipper's mind is that he should attempt to make a record
passage. In fact, he couldn't do so if he wished, in the majority
of cases, because the ponderous and heavily-weighted fabric he
commands takes little heed of her acres of canvas unless in a heavy
gale; she will do ten or eleven knots till the poor canvas blows
away. Then she stops, while the "crowd" of fourteen ordinary seamen
gather the remnants together. This, remember, is the cargo sailer
pure and simple&mdash;the tramp that takes anything that offers,
from guano to coal, railway iron to lumber, at rates that about pay
wear and tear and the crew's wages. There are, however, a few
<i>bona-fide</i> wool clippers yet left unsold to Scandinavian or
Italian buyers, and running home with passengers and cargo from
both Sydney and Melbourne.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 123</p>-->

<p>What becomes of these fine ships as they drop out of the
running? Twenty years seems to be about the extreme life of an
English clipper, as an English clipper; then she is sold to foreign
owners, or is discovered unexpectedly a hulk in some foreign or
colonial port.</p>

<p>I remember seeing in Liverpool in 1876 the <i>Khersonese</i>,
then a full-rigged sailing ship. She was launched in 1855 from
Robert Hickson &amp; Co.'s yard at Belfast as an auxiliary screw
steamer, and was 222 ft. long, and of about 1700 tons register, and
at the time of her launch was reported to be the largest and finest
vessel built in Ireland up to that date. Even in 1876 she was
looked upon as a very fine ship, and people were saying what a pity
she could get no better freight than coal to the East Indies. An
old sailor looking at her told his mate that she was the finest
vessel afloat when she was launched. "Pooh," answered the other,
who belonged to a younger generation, "that old collier! she was
never considered a fine ship, that's only your imagination."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 124</p>-->

<p>More than one of these fine vessels that twenty years ago used
to be given the pride of place in the berthing at Circular Quay,
Sydney, can still often be seen in its vicinity, but under what
changed conditions. To-day some gigantic 10,000-ton ocean liner
lies alongside the quay, arrogantly taking up more space than two
of the old clippers, now become coal hulks; creaking derricks and
iron gins in place of their tapering spars and graceful rigging.
Thus they lie along the outer side of the mail steamer, discharging
coal for her bunkers, and so blotted out from the quay by her
towering bulwarks as to be shut out of even a sight of it.</p>

<p>The Western Islands fruiterers were another class of beautiful
little vessels soon to be forgotten. From May to November every
year, from the Azores, Italy, Malta, and other orange-growing
countries, they carried fruit to the London markets, and in the
fifties nearly three hundred of these vessels were engaged in the
trade, most of them schooners, and several of them three-masted.
They lasted till the eighties&mdash;a few of them are still
left&mdash;but steam has driven the bulk of them out, and they are
now foreign coasters, and more than one famous Western Island
schooner is carrying coal on the Australian coast. Southern-going
sailors, looking forward, after a long voyage to Australia or the
East, to paying-off day, knew they were nearly home after passing
the Azores, when with the strong westerly behind, and the Gulf
Stream weed drifting past on the current, the fruit schooners began
to show up on the horizon.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 125</p>-->

<p>In the forties, emigration to America in fine-looking
frigate-built clippers, carrying three skysails and a moonraker,
with all kinds of fancy kites in studding-sails and save-alls, and
sometimes flying the American "gridiron" or the red ensign, looked
very pretty when this aspect of it was shown by pencil of artist or
by pen of song writer. But there was need to sing "Cheer, Boys,
Cheer," when the interior of the ship was looked at. Emigration
came under Government supervision only by slow degrees, as the
gross abuses that were prevalent made noise enough to wake very
sleepy Honourable Members. One feature of the business was for a
number of rascals to band themselves together, calling themselves
emigration agents, who regularly touted for passengers, taking them
for what they could get.</p>

<p>From 60,000 in the year 1837, in 1847 the number of emigrants
from England to America, Canada, and Australia had increased to
121,000; then came the gold rush, and in 1852 the number reached
within a few of 88,000 persons to Australia alone, and still more
than 100,000 every year went to America. Most of these people were
quartered in the hold of the ship&mdash;that is to say, on the
'tween decks&mdash;the lower hold being filled with cargo. The
so-called accommodation consisted of as many bunks of unplaned deal
boards as could be crowded together by every device an ingenious
carpenter could think of, the bunks often three tiers high, and so
thickly packed that the people had to crawl over each other to get
into the inner ones. Married and single, families from
grand-parents to infants in arms, were indiscriminately put into
one compartment of the hold with nothing but curtains to divide
them, and in many cases on the Atlantic voyage a few biscuits and a
bag or two of oatmeal was all the food provided. The ship supplied
three quarts of water to each adult, but beyond this the emigrants
found themselves in absolutely everything, bedding, food,
attendance, and all else. Many of them came from the heart of
Ireland, and had never seen a ship before they embarked, and the
scene below in rough weather, when a couple of hundred of people of
all ages and both sexes were battened down and left to their own
devices, can be imagined. As a matter of fact, with all the
regulations that, as time went on, were devised for the better
carrying of these people, the condition of the steerage passenger
remained almost as bad, and even now it is occasionally
disgraceful.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 126</p>-->

<p>In the seventies I have personal knowledge of a ship that took
about fifty or sixty steerage passengers to Australia&mdash;too
small a number to bring her within the regular category of an
emigrant ship. She was four months on the voyage out, and was
overrun with vermin, contracted by the filthy condition of the
'tween decks, where the passengers were stowed, according to Act of
Parliament, in bunks of only two tiers, with so many cubic feet of
space, and all the rest of it, but of plain unpainted deal. A
careless shipmaster, indifferent to the cleansing or regulation of
this place, left these people to their own devices, and the only
cleansing it got on the long voyage was an occasional careless
sweep when one or other of the emigrants became desperately hard up
for amusement.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 127</p>-->

<p>On this ship, in accordance with the advertisement, "a duly
qualified medical man" was carried. As soon as the ship got into
fine weather, this gentleman, every morning, in company with a
kindred spirit, ascended to the main-top, and sitting there, played
euchre most of the day, he and his partner refreshing themselves
from time to time from the bottle of brandy they had taken aloft
with them. The doctor was a "shilling-a-month man," that is a
person who, for that nominal wage and his services, worked his
passage. If any emigrant wanted his advice, the patient had to hail
the main-top, and relate his symptoms in a voice loud enough to be
heard a hundred feet from the deck, and, as the doctor remarked,
this kept people from bothering him about trifles, and ship
passengers, as a rule, <i>do</i> revel in free advice and
medicine.</p>

<p>On the same ship was an old woman apparently nearly eighty. She
had managed, no one knew how, to make her way from the interior of
Ireland to the ship at Liverpool, embarking a few hours before the
vessel left the wharf, and seating herself quietly on the
after-hatch, a bundle, apparently all her belongings, beside her.
The voyage lasted four months, and no one during the whole of it
could remember seeing the after-hatch without the old woman sitting
upon it; when the pitch was boiling out of the deck seams in the
intervals of tropic rains, as the ship lay becalmed on the equator,
when the vessel rolled green seas on board as she drove before the
cold gales of the roaring forties, that old woman seemed always in
the same place nervously fingering her rosary, and waiting, waiting
wearily for the end of the voyage and the sight of her son. For we
found, in time, that she was going to Victoria to end her days with
her son, who had emigrated thirty years before, and who was to meet
her at Melbourne. When the ship arrived he was not on the wharf,
and for two days longer she remained on board, not knowing where
else to go. Then, through the ship's agents, the news came that the
son was dead. The old woman was absolutely without a friend in the
world, and she was taken away to some benevolent asylum, where she
died before the ship sailed on the return voyage.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 128</p>-->

<p>Emigrants, when the gold fever was at its height, sailed from
nearly every port in the kingdom. In 1852 ships were built and
fitted out at Sunderland, Barnstaple, Southampton, and a dozen
other places, of tons register often not exceeding 500, and were
frequently only small brigs. A ship of 800 tons burden, with 250
emigrants on board, was considered luxurious. When the <i>Great
Britain</i> sailed for Australia in 1852 with 630 passengers she
was spoken of as a floating hotel. Yet Australian waters were then
considered dangerous enough to justify her in carrying 6 heavy deck
guns and small arms for 100 men, "in case of attack by savages in
these distant seas." She was so long on the trip, eighty odd days,
that sailing ships beat her.</p>

<p>Charles Dickens in <i>American Notes</i> describes another
famous passenger steamer, the <i>Britannia</i>, in which he went to
America in 1842. He was eighteen days in making the passage to
Boston, and he regarded his stateroom, the saloon, and the whole
passenger accommodation, and the hardships of the voyage, as of a
character, judging from his description of it, that would have
shaken even Mark Tapley's philosophy. But the accommodation in the
first class of the <i>Britannia</i>&mdash;no better than in the
best of modern third class&mdash;was Buckingham Palace to
Pentonville Prison compared with the average emigrant quarters.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 129</p>-->

<p>The packet ships treated their passengers well, judged, of
course, by the standard of the time. The famous Black Ball and
similar lines of ships must not be confused with the cargo tramps
hired by emigration agent swindlers. The Black Ball liner, <i>James
Baines</i>, before leaving Portsmouth with troops for India, for
which service she had been chartered by the Government, was visited
by Queen Victoria, who is said to have declared that she had no
idea such a splendid merchant ship was owned in her dominions. The
<i>James Baines</i> was 243 feet long and of 2093 tons register;
her owners, Messrs Baines of Liverpool, also owned many other
vessels famous in the annals of the sea. Two of these, the
<i>Lightning</i> and the <i>Champion of the Seas</i>, were among
the smartest clippers ever built. When the <i>James Baines</i> had
all her sails set, the whole numbered thirty-six, and she carried
three skysails and a moonscraper; the last tiny kite has long
become only a tradition in ships. This was the kind of vessel that
only forty years ago occupied the pride of place in our merchant
service, now filled by the Cunarder or White Star steamer of 12,000
tons and twenty-knot speed. Many of the famous Black Bailers
remained afloat until quite recently, ending their days under a
foreign flag or as colliers, but the <i>James Baines</i> was spared
this ignoble ending&mdash;she was burned while in dock at Liverpool
in 1858. The traditions of the line have been perpetuated in sea
song and story, and even now occasionally can be heard a capstan
shanty singer rolling out as the anchor is being
weighed:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"In the Black Ball Line I served my time,<br>
Oh rise and shine in the Black Ball Line."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 130</p>-->

<p>When Washington Irving crossed the Atlantic in 1833 in a crack
American packet ship, he was sixteen days to the Channel, and five
more days before he landed at Portsmouth. Then the ship stayed a
day or two, landed mails which were sent on by coach, and the
voyage was resumed to London, the ship arriving at the docks in
just about the same length of time as is now occupied in the
steamer passage home from Australia. Irving incidentally mentions
that the packet preceding his had run down an English brig in the
night and drowned her captain, and he writes:</p>

<p>"These encounters are necessarily very common in so frequented a
sea where the weather is so often thick. Our packets, which run in
all weathers and never heave to, are especially liable to accidents
of this nature, and it is a curious commentary upon the received
opinions in England, by which the people seek to console themselves
for that superiority in model, equipment and speed, which is not
easy to deny to us, in insisting that if our ships are handsomer,
theirs are strongest; that in all these encounters Brother Jonathan
passes on as if nothing had happened to him, and John Bull goes
uniformly to the bottom."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 131</p>-->

<p>A chapter in the history of the famous White Star Line
illustrates the passenger carrying trade during the last half
century in a very remarkable manner. More than fifty years ago the
White Star Line ran a regular fleet of clippers from Liverpool to
the Australian Colonies&mdash;fine wooden vessels, among the
fastest afloat, the <i>Red Jacket</i>, a record breaker, is
remembered to-day. In 1868, when iron was the fashion, this company
built a new fleet, beginning with the <i>Explorer</i>, "a fast iron
clipper of 750 tons;" then competition and the rush of emigration
induced the company to plunge into larger vessels, and in a couple
of years ships of more than a thousand or fifteen hundred tons were
laid on. In the seventies, the White Star Line having established
itself as an Atlantic ferry, sold the last of its sailing vessels,
the four-masted clipper <i>California</i>, the last sailing ship
built by Harland &amp; Wolff, and abandoned the Australian trade.
But in the year 1899 the flag was once more seen in Australian
waters flying from the <i>Medic</i>, a 12,000-ton steamer, the
first of a fleet of nine great steamships intended to carry
third-class passengers to and from Australia in a fashion hitherto
unknown, providing them with accommodation considerably more
luxurious than anything ever conceived for the saloon passengers of
the <i>Red Jacket</i> days. Incidentally, it may be mentioned,
though the White Star people do not hint at it anywhere, these big
steamers will, without doubt, put the final extinguisher on the
wool clipper, and therein will the enterprise of the great company
find perhaps a greater reward than in the passenger carrying. With
the last of the wool clippers is the end of the clipper ship, and
thenceforward the word clipper will be but a tradition of the
past.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 132</p>-->

<p>A branch of the "passenger" carrying trade now extinct is the
old convict transport service. The thousands of prisoners carried
to Australia in the first fifty years of the century made of this
no unimportant industry, for the ships that took prisoners out had
to take cargoes home to make the voyage profitable, and this
developed our trade in remote places that would otherwise have
remained for another generation or two unheard of. The convict
transport has often been described. The prisoners were confined
between decks, the prison being barricaded off from the quarters of
the crew by strong wooden partitions, and the hatches guarded in
similar fashion. Mutinies were frequent on board these ships. Here
is a report selected from any number which I could
quote:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Captain Wilson in command of the guard, my
first officer, surgeon, and purser, with two ladies, were at
dinner, when suddenly we were alarmed by the cries of convict
women. We rushed on deck, and found the ship temporarily in
possession of the male prisoners. On deck one man presented a
blunderbus at me, and I shot him with my pistol. Some more of the
insurgents were killed by others of our party. The convicts, seeing
their intentions frustrated, ran forward as speedily as they came
aft, and the ship's company and troops, now being collected
together, began to vent their rage upon such of the convicts as
were to be found on deck, in beating them with cutlasses and the
butts of their muskets, until they were forced into the prison
below. When the tumult had subsided we found twelve of the convicts
killed and ten wounded, two of whom subsequently died."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 133</p>-->

<p>The telegraph and the rapid mail services give shipowners a
control over their ships which was wanting fifty years ago. This
considerably reduces the responsibilities of shipmasters abroad,
very much to the advantage of the owner and the detriment of the
ship-masters' perquisite money; when it is possible for the captain
of a ship to receive orders within twenty-four hours of asking for
them, though 13,000 miles distant from his owners, there can be no
excuse for blunders, and such a voyage as the following would not
be possible at this end of the century when the movements of a ship
are known at Lloyd's almost every day while she is within sight of
land.</p>

<p>The British ship <i>Lady Montague</i> returned to London in 1852
after a voyage of four years in duration. She was a vessel of 760
tons burden, and left Southampton in May 1848 laden with coals for
Aden. Six weeks out the master died and the mate succeeded to the
command. After discharging the coals, the ship proceeded to Bombay,
thence to China, and at Cumsingmoon she embarked Chinese emigrants
for California, <i>via</i> Callao, the whole number of persons on
board when she sailed amounting to 500. Soon after sailing, the
provisions turned putrid, and the water in wooden casks became
foul, with the result that dysentery and fever broke out, and 193
persons died, 26 of them English seamen&mdash;only three of the
crew survived. The ship having put into Hobart, Tasmania, to
recruit, proceeded on her voyage, but illness broke out again, and
by the time she reached Callao, the total of deaths was 274. Many
of the Chinese jumped overboard to escape the horrors of the
passage. At an inquiry held by the Board of Trade, the owner
exonerated himself from blame by showing that he had only received
one letter from the mate since the ship sailed, and that the
officer had undertaken this passenger carrying entirely on his own
responsibility.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 134</p>-->

<p>Strangely enough, in 1899, notwithstanding advanced education,
cable services, and all the other wonders of the age, the
newspapers reported this singular mistake. A ship sailed from
Antwerp in December 1898 for Port Los Angeles, California. The
master, either through insufficient care or obsolete charts, sailed
his ship to Port Angeles, Washington, only discovering when he went
to enter his ship at the Customs that he was 1200 miles north of
his port of discharge!</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the opening of the Suez Canal was
worth a century of time in its influence upon our carrying trade.
The Canal route has converted the whole Eastern, trade into another
Atlantic ferry. The opening of the Canal in November 1869, and the
passage through it, has been often described. To-day, even this
detail of navigation has been entirely altered from what it was a
decade ago. The time in making the passages has been reduced from
an average of about two and a half days to eighteen hours.
Formerly, steamers could only travel by daylight, but now by the
aid of gas buoys and electric lights, big steamers can keep moving
all night. The tonnage passing through the Canal in 1870 did not
exceed 500,000 tons; 9,000,000 is now about the figure. The value
of the shares bought by Lord Beaconsfield at £4,000,000 sterling in
1875, has more than quadrupled, and 80 per cent, or more of the
tonnage passing through the canal flies the English flag. What
enormous money value this carrying trade of ours represents can be
imagined when £1000 in canal dues is paid by any number of our mail
steamers, the tolls being levied at the rate of 7s. 6d. a ton on
the ship and 10 francs a passenger. The canal dredges to-day are as
large as many of the great steamers that formed the opening
procession, and there is a dredge&mdash;the largest in the
world&mdash;now cleaning the canal bottom at the rate of 1500 tons
an hour, each bucket lifting two tons of material at a time.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 135</p>-->

<p>Steamers, now, are built expressly for particular trades.
Nothing shows the growth of our sea carrying organisation more than
this. There are live cattle steamers designed to give all the deck
space to the cattle, with just gangway enough for the crew to move
about the ship to carry on the necessary work, which consists
almost exclusively in keeping the ship clean. There are dead meat
carriers built to stow thousands of tons weight of sheep in cold
chambers, the refrigerating machinery of such vessels being as
complicated and important to the voyage as is that of the main
engines. There are bulk grain steamers, and actually bulk petroleum
steamers! In the last, the petroleum is said to be safer than when
carried in cases. The hold is divided into huge tanks well
barricaded from the engines, and the tanks' bulkheads carried from
the upper deck to the keelson, and always filled to the brim, the
great object being to prevent the accumulation of vapour, as would
occur if there was an air space. The crews of these vessels sign
special articles by which they agree not to smoke on the voyage,
and they load and unload the steamers by pumping the oil direct
into or out of the tanks. There have been very few accidents on
board of them&mdash;carrying coal from Newcastle, New South Wales,
to San Francisco is proved by statistics to be much more dangerous,
and there have been more ships on fire in this trade than in any
other.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 136</p>-->

<p>Sum up the changes that have taken place in a hundred years in
cargo and passenger carrying and the results are these:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the first quarter of the century specie and mails were
carried in war-vessels, and the passenger trade, as a trade, did
not exist. People who wanted to travel on the sea took passage in a
sailing-vessel much as they would have got a lift in a carrier's
cart. The well-to-do traveller engaged a "state-room" in the cuddy,
and took care before he sailed to purchase a stock of fowls and the
like for his table. Poor folk did not travel, or if they did, got
on as best they could, stowing themselves among the cargo, or
sleeping in blankets on the deck. Now, people take their passage in
steamers, studying the shipping time-tables as they study train
timetables, and going by that steamer whose appointed date of
arrival is at the most convenient hour for landing. Goods ordered
by cable from ports 13,000 miles away from London, can be sent off
the same night and delivered at their destination within six weeks
of the receipt of the order. Fifty years ago six months would have
been thought a remarkably short period within which to complete the
transaction. Fifty years ago a hundred Americans crossed the
Atlantic in the season, and half of them wrote to the papers an
account of their voyage. Now thirty steamer lines cross the ferry,
carrying every summer 150,000 Americans.</p>

<p>The difference in the tonnage of the mercantile marine of the
British Empire in 1800 and 1899 is the difference between one
million eight hundred thousand, and thirteen and a half millions.
In 1800 we owned fewer than 18,000 ships: 2666 of them belonged to
London, 796 of them to Liverpool, and 2161 to our colonies, Canada
and the West Indies.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 137</p>-->

<p>Australia was of too little importance to be counted. The
tonnage owned in the Colonies to-day equals that of the parent
state in 1800, and Australia alone, which in 1822 owned 3 vessels,
now owns 500,000 tons of shipping.</p>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII. STEAM.</h2>

<h3>Earliest Steamers&mdash;Beginning of the Atlantic
Ferry&mdash;Steam War Vessels.</h3>

<p>When peace was established, men had time to look around, and
suddenly&mdash;for it was suddenly, considering how slowly people
moved then&mdash;it dawned upon the minds of shipowners that steam
was something more than a plaything.</p>

<p>Twenty years before the century opened, a Shropshire ironmaster
had a small iron steam-vessel plying on the Severn, and
half-a-dozen experimenters were ruining themselves and their
friends by trying patents of their own in steam propulsion; but in
March 1802 William Symington <i>did</i> undoubtedly inaugurate the
era of steam.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 139</p>-->

<p>The story of the <i>Charlotte Dundas</i>, the little tug built
by Symington for Lord Dundas for use on the Forth and Clyde Canal,
has often been told. There is a detailed history of her, and of
much besides that is curious on the subject, in <i>A Sketch of the
Origin and Progress of Steam Navigation</i>, by Bennett Woodcroft.
The story of this, the first practical steamer, suggests a picture
of Symington hopefully trying his best to keep cool that nothing
might go wrong; not doubtful of his steamer, but horribly nervous
in the presence of the gentlefolk, who would probably laugh and
sneer at him as a dreamer of dreams, if presently, when he put her
full-speed ahead in the face of the gale and with the heavy barges,
a piston or a crank, or something should give way, and the whole
business turn out an abject failure. But he had experimented a
little before, having made a tiny steamer for an Edinburgh
banker&mdash;her engines can still be seen in a Glasgow
museum&mdash;and so he was pretty sure of the capabilities of the
<i>Charlotte Dundas</i>.</p>

<p>The run to Port Glasgow was 19½ miles; it was blowing hard,
right ahead, and many large vessels were lying at anchor, wind and
weather bound, yet in six hours, at the rate of 3½ miles an hour,
the steamer towing two barges of 70 tons weight made the passage,
delighting Lord Dundas and his friends so much that his Lordship
wrote directly in enthusiastic fashion to his Grace of Bridgewater
of young Symington's invention. Not altogether Symington's though,
for the engine was a combination of patents, thus: Steam acted on
both sides of the piston, this was Watt's patent; the piston worked
a connecting rod and crank, Pickards' invention; but the union of
the crank to the axis of Miller's stern paddle-wheel was
Symington's own idea, and the blending of these inventions and the
practicable application of them on this occasion was Symington's.
To Lord Dundas is due the credit of having faith and enterprise to
support the engineer. The point to be remembered is that Symington
had, for the first time, given rotatory motion to his paddle by the
attachment of the crank to its axis without the interposition of a
beam, the germ this of all that has come since in adapting steam to
the propulsion of ships.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 140</p>-->

<p>The Duke of Bridgevvater forthwith ordered six tugboats for his
canals, and Symington thought he was made for life; but the Duke's
co-directors disagreed with such new-fangled notions, and, without
doubt, the paddlewheel would stir up the canal mud. Just then the
Duke of Bridgewater died; no one seemed to want any more steamers;
presently enthusiasm died out, and the <i>Charlotte Dundas</i> was
laid up in a creek of the canal, an object of curiosity to the
idle. Symington died in 1831, having received £125 from the Privy
Purse as a reward for his public services.</p>

<p>Fulton, meanwhile, having come across from America, seen
Symington, and been shown by him everything there was to see, in
August 1807 the public hear of the <i>Clermont</i> making her
successful 5 miles an hour trip, from New York to Albany, and there
is much talk of Mr Fulton, the clever American who has invented a
practicable steamboat. Then these inventors say and write bitter
things of one another, and much ink is wasted by their friends as
to how many ideas have been filched, and how many legitimately
conceived.</p>

<p>There is no doubt Fulton made the most of his visit to Glasgow,
but the <i>Clermont</i> was so great an improvement on the
<i>Charlotte Dundas</i> that Fulton was certainly to all intents an
originator, however much he may have learned from the other. Eight
years later Fulton died, having, in the meanwhile, invented the
torpedo, and seen, ready for launching, an American steam war
vessel, built from plans designed by himself, and having
experimented with, and actually built, a submarine boat, that if
not as great a success as the modern attempts in this direction are
reported by their inventors to be, was no more a dream than our
English engineers represent modern submarine vessels to be.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 141</p>-->

<p>Fulton's <i>Clermont</i> set our people to work again, and in
1812 came Henry Bell of Helensburgh, with the Comet, "that elegant,
safe, and commodious steam vessel to ply between Glasgow and
Greenock, 40 ft. long, of 30 tons burden, and with an engine of
three horse power."</p>

<p>Between Robert Fulton and Henry Bell there are conflicting
claims. Certainly Bell did, in 1800, submit a memorial to the
Admiralty on the "practicability and utility of steam as a marine
propelling power for use against wind and tide in rivers or in
seas," and certainly the Admiralty did reply that after careful
consideration, "my Lords are of opinion that the idea is of no
value in trans-marine navigation." So Bell sent his plans to
America, and from that day to this people argue and adduce proofs
on both sides as to whether Fulton or Bell or Symington was the
inventor of the steamer. Fulton, though an American by birth, was a
Scotsman by descent, and Symington and Bell were both Scotsmen, so
that Scotland can with some reason claim the real honour of the
invention, and beyond this point I am not authority enough to
express an opinion.</p>

<p>Four years after the <i>Comet</i> started, people were
outgrowing the fear of being blown up by boilers, 600 passengers
journeying daily on the Clyde in steamers, and from this date
onward, steam ferry boats increased in number rapidly. In 1814 the
first steamboat was launched on the Thames, and in America and
Canada many such vessels were running.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 142</p>-->

<p>In the same year steamers began to put to sea, and William
Denny, of Dumbarton, engined the <i>Marjory</i>, which steamed from
Dumbarton to the Thames, and was plying on the river until Russian
war time. A year later the Mersey had its steamer, and in 1819 the
<i>Savannah</i>, a full-rigged ship of 300 tons, fitted with an
auxiliary paddle steam-engine, made the passage from Savannah to
Liverpool in 29 days, the first ocean-going steamship. She was
built in New York for a sailing ship, but was later fitted with an
engine, and used her steam only when the wind failed. After
discharging her cargo she sailed and steamed to St Petersburg, and
thence back to Savannah, and was wrecked a year later.</p>

<p>In 1826 the <i>Enterprise</i> was built on the Thames, engined
with a "beautiful copper boiler" by Maudslay, and taking her
departure from Falmouth, made Calcutta in 113 days, the first
steamer to reach India, and this was the first long steamer
voyage.</p>

<p>Told in this way, the progress of steam would make of the
chapter a mere list of dates, yet the figures are expressive in
their way. The boy, creeping unwillingly to school, who stopped on
the canal bank to see Symington's tug start upon her experimental
trip, looked on at what was then no less a wonder of the age, than
a successful aerial passenger vessel would be to us; the lover
taking his mistress for an afternoon trip upon the Clyde in one of
a dozen steamers, might have pointed out the <i>Charlotte
Dundas</i> lying rotting in a creek, and told the story of how he
had seen this steamer make her first trip when he was a schoolboy;
the fathers of many people who will read this book were born before
it was considered safe for a steamer to go out of sight of
land.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 143</p>-->

<p>In a newspaper of 1814 a description of a new steamer to run
between Glasgow and Greenock is given. She was called the
<i>Clyde</i>, was 75 ft. long, had an engine of 12 horse power, and
could steam four and a half miles an hour. The paper tells us with
wonderment how it costs £40 a day to work her, the engines
consuming twelve hundredweight of coal each day, and that the
"apparatus" complete cost about £700. She had accommodation for 250
passengers and a crew of five men. Her paddles, sixteen in number,
were in two wheels of 9 ft. in diameter, and this vessel and two
others, then forming the Clyde fleet of steamers, had played such
havoc with road travelling that the service of post chaises was
being reduced, the tolls let for £1400 less than formerly, four out
of eight stage coaches had been laid aside, and sixty less horses
were on the road. The cost of travelling was, in the after cabin,
10s., and in the fore cabin, 2s. 6d., the distance travelled 22
miles, and the fares by mail and stage coaches, 10s. and 12s.</p>

<p>In the same paper an account is given of a new invention, which
it was evidently thought would presently do away with these nasty,
dangerous, paddle steamers. An excise officer of Wick had designed
a vessel to be propelled by oars instead of paddles. These oars
were so constructed that they could be worked by hand or by the aid
of a small engine, "the engine being connected by a series of
levers with the oars which row the boat just as men do! A much
safer plan!"</p>

<p>Three years later, another paper records with certain
satisfaction a disaster to a venturesome steamer. No one was
injured, and the accident might serve as a warning to people not to
trust themselves in such dangerous vessels. This is what
happened:&mdash;</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 144</p>-->

<p>The <i>Regent</i>, steam packet, bound from the Thames to
Margate&mdash;a rash voyage to undertake in 1817&mdash;was burnt to
the water's edge off Whitstable. The reporter of the time
wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"The gale of wind being strong, blew the
chimney flue away, and the woodwork that is nearly breast high from
the deck at the bottom of the flue, for the purpose of keeping the
people near the chimney from burning themselves, caught fire, then
the captain made for the land and got every one safely on
shore."</p>

<p>In 1818 readers were informed "that the time is fast approaching
when the grand intercourse with Europe will not be, as at present,
through Eastern America, but through the great rivers that
communicate with the ocean. The navigation of these rivers is fast
coming under the control of the steamboat, an invention that
promises to be a great advantage. Their average speed, heavily
laden, is 60 miles a day, and about 25 of them of from 50 to 400
tons burden are navigating American rivers. On the Clyde, in
Scotland, they have during the past summer been extensively used,
even as many as 20 of them being employed. Some of them actually
voyaged from Glasgow to Inveraray, partly through a stormy sea,
performing the journey of 110 miles in sixty hours, and touching at
stopping places with almost the regularity of a stage coach. No
serious accident has yet occurred, and if the boilers of cast-iron
should give way, a piece of cloth is firmly wedged into the hole,
and the vessel proceeds without any danger to the passengers."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 145</p>-->

<p>Such was the passenger steamer in the first quarter of the
century. What was the Admiralty (slower to move than the merchant
shipowner) doing with the new invention? When George III. died in
January 1820, the navy estimates from £18,000,000 sterling in the
middle of the last war, dropped to £2,500,000, the number of seamen
and marines from 145,000 fell to 20,000. Now was the chance for the
naval constructor to give less attention to questions of armament
and more to improvements in the speed and sailing qualities of
ships.</p>

<p>By 1827 the <i>Enterprise</i> had made her voyage to Calcutta,
the <i>Curacoa</i> had made a trip to the West Indies, the
<i>United Kingdom</i> was trading regularly between London and the
Clyde, and there were harbour and river steamers enough to diminish
sensibly the receipts of the toll-bars. Then the Admiralty decided
that the steamer was beyond the experimental stage, and could be
made of some use, though by no means so reliable as to occupy
anything but a very minor place in the scheme of naval defence.
Half-a-dozen years before this period, fourteen or fifteen small
tugboats and harbour-steamers had been introduced into the navy,
and steam in the mail packet service was tolerated. Brunel (he who
laid down the blockmaking machinery) was responsible for this
innovation. The <i>Comet</i>, says one authority, was the first of
these little steamers, the <i>Monkey</i>, tug, of about 200 tons
and 80 horse power, afloat until the sixties, was, if not the
first, the second.</p>

<p>It is equally doubtful which was the first regular steam war
vessel. Miles, writing in 1841, says the <i>African</i>, about
1827, was the first steamer to appear on the official list. Between
1823 and 1827 Maudslay engined half-a-dozen steamers for the
Government, and one of these at least (the <i>Dee</i>) was afloat
till the seventies. In 1827 an order was given for thirty steam
brigs of war and one steam frigate. Of course all these vessels
were driven by paddles, and their engines were on the well-known
side lever principle.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 146</p>-->

<p>When George IV. died in June 1830, out of 588 ships on the
<i>Navy List</i> in commission, building and in ordinary, there
were 12 steamers; and when William IV. died, seven years later, out
of 575 ships, 54 were steam vessels. In the same year 1 steamer was
on the stocks, while 14 line of battle ships and 43 smaller sailing
vessels were building.</p>

<p>During the second quarter of the century steamers made such
rapid progress that, from building with doubt and hesitation,
ocean-going wooden paddle-wheel steamers in the early thirties,
merchant shipowners were adopting the new-fangled screw propellers
in the early forties, accepting iron as a material for ships before
the fifties, and at the close of the half century were beginning to
regard sails as of secondary consideration for the fast passenger
and mail service.</p>

<p>In the Colonies steam early came into use, the <i>Royal
William</i> in 1831, a 350-ton steamer of 240 horse power, was
built in Canada, and she took about six weeks on the passage from
Quebec to Liverpool, sailing part of the way. In the same year a
steamer called the <i>Sophia Jane</i> went a longer voyage. I have
not seen her name mentioned in any book, yet she made the first
steam voyage to Australia and the longest trip under steam, down
almost to the fifties.</p>

<p>Her history is worth telling, because it is part of the story of
Thames shipbuilding. She was the joint property of Messrs Barnes
&amp; Miller, and was built to run between London Bridge and
Gravesend by Mr Evans.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 147</p>-->

<p>When the little steamer (she was of 256 tons burden with engines
of 50 horse power) was first placed on the ferry service, her
owners were involved in an action at law, to prove their right to
navigate the vessel, not being free of the river. They won their
action from the Watermen's Company, and soon the first Gravesend
steam ferry was started. In Leigh's "New Picture of London" (1825)
we are told that the <i>Thames</i> was the first steamer to ply on
the river, and she was brought from Glasgow by Mr Dodd, "and since
then several boats are employed during the summer season." The
<i>Sophia Jane</i>, up to 1828, was one of these, then she took
longer trips, running for some time between Portsmouth and
Plymouth, then from Liverpool to the Isle of Man, then from London
to Calais, and finally made her great voyage, arriving at Port
Jackson Heads in May 1831, three months after leaving the Thames;
and she was running on the Australian coast until wrecked in the
fifties. No fuss was made of this long voyage, though it was not
until 1838 that the Atlantic crossing by steam grew into a
service.</p>

<p>Between the voyage of the <i>Savannah</i> and the year 1838, at
irregular intervals, steamers had made the passage&mdash;one
vessel, the <i>Royal William</i>, taking forty days to do the trip.
This was in 1833; in 1838 a second <i>Royal William</i>, the first
steamer to sail from Liverpool, made her first voyage, and was
succeeded a few months later by the <i>Liverpool</i>. This vessel
made one or two good passages, doing the homeward trip on one
occasion in a few hours over the fortnight.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 148</p>-->

<p>Two companies were now formed, and the beginning of the great
Atlantic service was at hand. The Great Western Company was floated
for the express purpose of building at Bristol and despatching
therefrom at regular intervals the steamship <i>Great Western</i>,
designed as the largest and most powerful ship afloat. She was
built of wood, was 212 ft. long, of 1340 tons and 700 horse power,
engines by Maudslay. The largest ship afloat to-day is the White
Star steamer <i>Oceanic</i>, considerably more than twice the
length of the <i>Great Western</i>, nearly thrice her speed, and
more than twelve times her tonnage. As soon as it became known that
the <i>Great Western</i> was laid down, a company was formed to
establish an Atlantic line from Liverpool. This was the British and
American Steam Navigation Company, who ordered the <i>British
Queen</i> from Curling &amp; Young, Thames shipbuilders, with which
to inaugurate the service. This vessel could not be launched in
time to start with the Bristol Line, so John Laird, who was the
working Director of the Liverpool Company, chartered the
<i>Sirius</i>. She belonged to the Irish Channel Steam Packet
Company, and was built at Leith by Menzies, was of 703 tons, 270
horse power, and a speed of eight and a half knots.</p>

<p>The <i>Sirius</i> sailed from Liverpool on April 4th, and from
Queenstown on April 5th, 1838, and arrived at New York on the 23rd.
The Great Western left Bristol three days later than the
<i>Sirius</i>, and arrived in New York harbour less than two hours
after her, the race and the arrival of the two ships creating the
greatest excitement. This was the first and last Atlantic voyage of
the little <i>Sirius</i>, and she was sent back to the less
important Irish Channel service in which she remained until 1847,
when she was wrecked near Queenstown, drowning many persons. The
country people, where she went ashore, were such accomplished
wreckers, that in a day or two after the disaster they had carted
away from the sea coast nearly every plank of her timbers.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 149</p>-->

<p>The <i>Great Western</i> may be regarded as the first regular
Atlantic steamer. She made altogether 64 trips, after her first
voyage reducing her average time to twelve days some few hours. The
<i>British Queen</i> for the rival Company took the place of the
<i>Sirius</i>. She was of 1860 tons, 275 ft. long, and of 700 horse
power; and a second steamer, the <i>President</i>, was a year or
two later put on the service. In 1840 this steamer was lost, and
her loss led to the winding-up of the Company; the <i>British
Queen</i> was sold to a foreign firm, and the <i>Great Western</i>
with another famous steamer, the <i>Great Britain</i>, next
encountered more formidable rivalry arising from the enterprise of
Samuel Cunard, George Burns, and David Maclver, the founders of the
Cunard Company.</p>

<p>The service was begun with four wooden paddle steamers, the
<i>Britannia</i>, <i>Arcadia</i>, <i>Columbia</i>, and
<i>Caledonia</i>. They were each about 230 ft. long, 1100 tons, and
700 horse power; and the <i>Britannia</i> made the first trip,
sailing from Liverpool for Boston on July 4th, 1840. This was the
first regularly subsidised line of sail steamers, the annual
subsidy being £60,000, the passage money was thirty-eight guineas,
and the steamers called at Halifax <i>en route</i>. The
<i>Britannia</i> made her first outward trip in fourteen days,
eight hours, this time including a few hours' stay at Halifax. From
this time onward the steam traffic rapidly increased, and the rest
of the story records the change from paddles to screw, from wood to
iron, from a passage of more than a fortnight to one of less than a
week, from the rivalry of two companies to that of more than a
score.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 150</p>-->

<p>The monument at Boulogne to Frederick Sauvage, truthfully or
not, tells the world that a Frenchman invented the screw propeller,
and there are, at least, half-a-dozen other claimants&mdash;Petit
Smith, Ericsson, Woodcroft, are the three names best known to
Englishmen. Ericsson was a Swede living in England, and in 1837 he
built the <i>F. B. Ogden</i> as an experiment, but our Admiralty
would have nothing to do with him, so he then built the <i>Robert
F. Stockton</i> for the Americans, and she propelled herself across
the Atlantic. Her inventor spent the rest of his life turning out
screw steamers and other inventions for the country that had
welcomed him. Then, in 1839, Petit Smith built the
<i>Archimedes</i>, and in three years the thing was an accepted
fact.</p>

<p>The Admiralty had long seen the danger as a target of a
paddle-wheel steamer, and so, when the screw was in early use the
navy adopted it, almost keeping pace with the merchant steamer in
this respect. Our naval experts were, however, much more backward
in <i>trusting</i> the screw without sails, preferring to stick to
wind and canvas, as, after all, affording the most natural,
reliable, and desirable means of propulsion, if only on account of
its antiquity; the propeller was accordingly long used as an
auxiliary only.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 151</p>-->

<p>Three years after the Queen came to the throne, we had in
commission fifteen steamers and seven others building, and in 1842,
after a series of trials between the <i>Rattler</i>, a screw
steamer of 200 horse power, and the <i>Alecto</i>, a paddle steamer
of similar power, the Admiralty led off grandly by ordering the
<i>Ajax</i> and the <i>Blenheim</i> to be fitted with screws, and
the <i>Dauntless</i>, <i>Encounter</i>, and <i>Arrogant</i> to be
built as screw frigates. In the same year the steam sloop of war
<i>Driver</i> left England, and circumnavigated the globe with her
screw propeller; and then the merchants, who up to this period
were, as a body, in favour of paddles, soon changed their opinions,
and the propeller henceforth was applied to all new steamers of
large size.</p>

<p>In 1845 the largest vessel to date, having six masts, five of
them fore-and-aft rigged, left Liverpool for New York. She was
fitted with the screw propeller, and made the passage in fifteen
days. This was the <i>Great Britain</i>, remembered by every old
sailor, and argued about in every ship's forecastle. Her tonnage,
the number of her masts, her rig, and every part of her from truck
to keelson, to judge from the talk of men who claim to have sailed
in her, having been altered in every voyage she made. There is
reason to remember her, for she was one of the first big iron
steamships. She only made three voyages across the Atlantic. In
September 1846, on the homeward voyage, she ran ashore in Dundrum
Bay, and lay there till the following summer. She was got off and
refitted as a three-masted steamship, and created a sensation for a
time, as the crack ship in the Australian trade, but in her old age
she was converted into a sailing-vessel, and ultimately ended as a
coal hulk at the Falkland Islands. She was of 2984 tons, was 322
ft. long, 51 ft. breadth of beam, and her engines were of iocxd
horse power. Nothing like her had been seen, or was to be
attempted, till Brunei designed his <i>Leviathan</i>.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 152</p>-->

<p>Having reached the middle of the century and the beginning of a
new departure in shipbuilding, it is worth while putting on record
the progress in figures of steam from 1815, when it may fairly be
said to have begun, to 1850, when the screw propeller and the use
of iron brought about a new order of things. In 1815 there were 10
steamers afloat, their united tonnage 1633 tons; in 1820 there were
43, with a tonnage of 7243 tons; in 1825, 168, tonnage 20,287; in
1830, 315, tonnage 33,444. The increase went on, the steamers and
the tonnage nearly doubling every five years, until in 1850 there
were 1350 steamers afloat with a tonnage of 187,631 tons.</p>

<p>Among others, Mr Ditchburn, a well-known builder of wooden ships
on the Thames, early in the forties, saw that iron was to be the
material of the future. He took into partnership Mr C. Mare, and
started a Thames iron shipbuilding works. In ten years the partners
had built in iron, from small ferry boats to big ocean-going
steamers, some hundreds of vessels. This firm built the little
Royal yacht <i>Fairy</i>, one of the first screw steamers in the
service. She was 312 tons, 128 horse power, was engined by Penn,
and was the yacht on board which the Queen reviewed the Baltic
Fleet in 1854.</p>

<p>She remained on the <i>Navy List</i> until 1868, when she was
replaced by the <i>Alberta</i>. By 1840 the Napiers had built
several iron steamers for use on the Thames. In 1843 the <i>Great
Britain</i> was laid, in 1850 the <i>City of Glasgow</i> made her
first voyage from Glasgow to New York&mdash;an iron screw steamer
of 1600 tons, soon after to be transferred to the Liverpool and New
York service as the first vessel of the Liverpool and Philadelphia
Steamship Company. This Company was afterwards called by the name
of the founder, the Inman Line, was converted early in the nineties
into the American Line, and the firm are owners of the <i>City of
Paris</i> and the <i>City of New York</i>, steamers which during
the late Spanish-American war became the American cruisers
<i>Yale</i> and <i>Harvard</i>.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 153</p>-->

<p>The first regular iron screw steam-collier&mdash;a type of
vessel to be seen in every harbour in the world, and more
plentiful, I suppose, than any build of ship afloat&mdash;was the
<i>James Bowes</i>, launched from Palmer's Yard (Jarrow), on the
Tyne, in July 1852. For six hundred years sailing vessels had
carried coal from Newcastle; the trip between that port and the
Thames frequently occupied a month and more, to carry and deliver
the cargo. The <i>John Bowes</i> carried 600 tons of coal, and
discharged it at Blackwall between midnight on a Wednesday and the
following Saturday afternoon. The Palmers were proud of the great
undertaking. The steamer, says a contemporary paper, required no
less than 160 tons of iron and 200,000 rivets to build her.</p>

<p>The first of a set of five screw steamers to carry the mails
between England and Africa was the <i>Forerunner</i>. The points
worth remembering in her history are these:</p>

<p>She was built on the banks of the Mersey by Mr Macgregor Laird,
at his yard at Birkenhead. This was in 1852, and the
<i>Forerunner</i> was the beginning of the revival of iron
shipbuilding on the Mersey, where it had originated more than
twenty years before. The <i>Forerunner</i> was a barque-rigged iron
screw steamer 160 ft. long, and had two engines of 50 horse power
each. She made the round voyage between Plymouth and Sierra Leone
in 57 days, having in that time called at five intermediate ports,
encountered severe weather, and caused people to shake their heads
at the idea of wire rigging&mdash;the first mention I can find of
wire being depended upon in an ocean-going ship.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 154</p>-->

<p>Four days from Gibraltar some of her standing gear carried away
in the gale, and her foremast, mainmast, and funnel went by the
board. They made shift for a funnel with headless casks, and at
half-speed reached the Rock, where the steamer was detained a week
refitting&mdash;and how the old fogies <i>did</i> rail about the
dangers of the new-fangled wire rigging!</p>

<p>In 1852 the firm of Denny Brothers, of Dumbarton, were building
steamships for the Australian Mail Company's Service, The
<i>Sydney</i>, launched in July, was a good type of these screw
steamers. She was 216 ft. long, 300 horse power, and 1500 tons
register. The vessels were, of course, square-rigged, placing much
dependence on their sails; the average number of saloon passengers
carried was 150. They coaled at St Vincent and the Cape of Good
Hope, the average length of their passage being 65 days.</p>

<p>Some of the best and prettiest types of passenger ships, lasting
from the sixties to the early eighties, were those built for the
Australian trade, and named after the English counties, the
<i>Somersetshire</i>, <i>Hampshire</i>, etc. They were fine
frigate-built, square-rigged, auxiliary screw vessels, of about 300
horse power, and with a gross tonnage of 2400, and were the
"correct thing" for well-to-do Australians and Englishmen bound out
from home to take passage in before the Orient Liners and similar
mail steamers ran them off.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 155</p>-->

<p>The <i>La Plata</i>, built for the Messrs Cunard to compete with
the Collins Line in the Atlantic service, was one of the crack
steamers in the early fifties. The Cunarder's <i>Asia</i> and
<i>Africa</i> had been beaten by the Collins steamers by a few
hours, so the Cunard Company built on the Clyde, at a cost of
£125,000, the <i>Arabia</i> and <i>Persia</i> to compete. Then the
<i>Amazon</i> was burnt at sea, and the Royal Mail Company bought
the <i>Arabia</i> to take her place, and renamed her the <i>La
Plata</i>. She could steam fifteen miles an hour, was a brig-rigged
paddle-boat of about 2300 tons burden, and her length was 285 ft.
In 1852 she was the fastest ocean steamer in the world.</p>

<p>The launch of the <i>Wave Queen</i> at Millwall in 1852, as an
iron coastal passenger steamer, marked a considerable advance, for
though more than 200 ft. in length, she was only 13 ft. in breadth,
and her fine lines made her a fast and very handsome vessel.</p>

<p>How long these vessels of the forties and early fifties remained
afloat, and in what remote parts of the world we hear of their
endings! In the thirties the Hudson's Bay Company ordered the
<i>Beaver</i> to be built for them on the Thames. She was a little
vessel of only about 110 tons, and was engined by Boulton &amp;
Watt of Birmingham with two 35 horse power side-lever engines. She
made the first steamer passage round Cape Horn, doing the passage
from London to Astoria, Oregon, in 163 days, and was the pioneer
steamer of the Pacific. She ran for years carrying fur for the
Company; it was on one of these trips that coal was discovered by
her at Vancouver Island, and in the gold rush to California in 1849
she carried thousands of miners. In 1888 she struck a rock off
Barrant Inlet, and in the early nineties her timbers and her copper
were made into souvenirs by a Vancouver firm.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 156</p>-->

<p>Let us go back to what the Admiralty was doing, and see how the
Royal dockyards looked, and what progress we had made since that
great engineering feat, when 1400 men with the aid of blocks and
tackle hauled the <i>Kent</i> up on a landing slip. It is going
back, for the Admiralty would not have iron&mdash;the screw
propeller was adopted at a comparatively early date by "My Lords,"
but in the first half of the century iron warships were not dreamt
of in Admiralty philosophy.</p>

<p>In September 1852 was launched at Pembroke H.M.S. <i>Windsor
Castle</i>, 140 guns, at this date "the largest ship afloat in the
whole world." Her length between perpendiculars was 240 ft. 6 in.,
her burden in tons 3759, and her displacement when ready for sea
5571 tons. Her engines for driving the screw propeller were 800
horse power. She was originally intended for a 120-gun sailing
ship, but while building it was determined to adopt the new means
of propulsion and increase her armament. To do this, it was
necessary to cut her in two. A newspaper of the time thus describes
the operation:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"This remarkable and unheard-of process was
accomplished by cutting the ship asunder at 'dead flat' or the
midship section, launching the after half, weighing 2000 tons, 23
ft., and building the new part in." This was a sign of the times.
The Admiralty had determined that steam, as an auxiliary to
sailing, was in future to be on all their ships; the screw
propeller had done away with the exposed paddle-wheels, and that
other defect, the paddle-boxes, practically depriving the ship of
her broadside armament; while Sir Charles Napier's suggestion to
put the engines below the water-line overcame another serious
objection&mdash;the danger from shot&mdash;though the Admiralty
still remained dubious as to the possibility of steering a ship
with a propeller in her stern.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 157</p>-->

<p>But dockyards remained practically the same&mdash;the men
employed were still wood-workers. They built wooden ships in
covered slips, and so many acres of docks and basins were added to
the Royal dockyards; but the visitor in 1800, in 1810, in 1825, in
1835, in 1845, in 1850, would have seen much the same at the last
date as he would have seen at the first. I have read descriptions
and studied books and plans of each of these dates, and can find no
difference worth recording in them. In 1817 they hauled the
<i>Kent</i> upon a slip to repair her; ropes, and blocks, and
capstans, and plenty of men were the means employed; in 1852 they
cut the <i>Windsor Castle</i> in halves and hauled her apart, and
shipwrights with handsaws, and ropes, and blocks, and capstans, and
men to pull, were still the means. Lieutenant Miles, in 1844,
summarising the progress made since the peace, writes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"In our dockyards, ships, and arsenals, the
genius of metamorphosis was at work; masts, rigging, sails,
ordnance, implements, and instruments underwent revision; the cable
started from its tough hempen coils into links of solid iron;
everything, in fact, of a tangible nature, to which the zealous
inventor could attach a new idea, was remodelled or remade, from
the patent dock and floating lighthouse to the patent floating
buoy; from transom bolts and fastenings to the copper sheathing
nail. In naval architecture, also, improvements of an important
nature had been effected; the weak, defenceless stern, the
ill-fortified bow, gave place to forms uniting strength, solidity,
and beauty; and as regards construction, certain arrangements were
made in the disposition of the materials which compose the frames
of ships, by substituting for the rectangular system a series of
triangles united by riders and trusses, the openings between the
timbers being filled in with pieces of wood, and caulked over."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 158</p>-->

<p>But observe, no mention of iron, no mention of great rifled
guns, no suspicion that masts, sails, and rigging were to be in a
generation reformed out of existence. There were at this time
fifty-two dockyards and naval establishments. These were at
Woolwich, Chatham, Sheerness, Portsmouth, Plymouth, and Pembroke;
at Deal, Yarmouth, Gibraltar, Malta, Canada, Halifax, Bermuda,
Antigua, Jamaica, the Cape of Good Hope, Trincomalee, and Bombay
were smaller establishments. There were the packet establishments,
the chief at Falmouth, besides the victualling, medical, transport,
and marine departments. The men employed in the dockyards were
conductors of wood-mills, lead-mills, saw-mills, foremen of
shipwrights, plumbers, and so on, but never a mention of
iron-workers&mdash;if we except a chief engineer at Woolwich and
his assistant, the only official of this branch of whom mention is
made&mdash;but Woolwich was at this time provided with "an
extensive manufactory for the construction of steam machinery, and
at Pembroke a regular department was just instituted for the
building of steam vessels."</p>

<p>At Portsmouth there was a basin of two acres in area, with four
large dry docks opening into it and two others open to the harbour.
There were covered building slips, wood and slate roofed, with
plenty of windows in them, built on the principle of diagonal
trussing, introduced by Sir Robert Seppings. These were the pride
of the yard&mdash;the ships and the block-making machinery were
still its sights.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 159</p>-->

<p>At Plymouth the breakwater, of which the first stone was laid in
1812, was still being completed in the later forties, and at
Devonport wooden ships were repairing, and new ones building, and
so with all the yards. The "Commissioners of the Naval Inquiry,"
appointed in 1805, after three years' work, sent in fifteen reports
in which the whole want of system in the civil departments of the
service, the chicanery, the ignorance, and the extravagance of
those responsible were exposed, and from 1808 the work of reform
began. In 1832 the different civil departments were organised into
five separate branches with responsible heads, and a number of
useless subordinate officials were abolished, the business of
selling and buying being put into one department, that of the
Director of Naval Contracts. The fruits of this can be best
understood by the difference between two sets of figures as given
in the <i>Naval Chronicle</i> for 1817 and in the <i>Times</i> for
1853. In the first period the establishment of officers in
Portsmouth Yard cost the country £50,000; in the second period,
though there was a steam factory with six higher grade officials in
it, the cost was only £22,600. From paying the workmen in a dozen
different ways, in 1850, a permanent staff was established entitled
to a pension for long service and good conduct. In Portsmouth,
where the dockyard has grown until it has become a town of 300
acres of basins, docks, building slips, workshops and factories,
there are 13 large docks; now nearly 9000 men are employed.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 160</p>-->

<p>In an article on Portsmouth in war-time, published in 1854, the
writer tells of the bustle of the yard, of the crowds of shipping
at Spithead, of the dozens of wherries, of bumboats, of men-o'-war
cutters darting hither and thither all over the harbour&mdash;but
it all amounts to a crowd of ships and boats alongside the yard
jetties, or lying off the Motherbank; the steamer is scarcely
mentioned in the article, and the date when it was written might as
easily have been 1804 as 1854.</p>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII. CUSTOMS OF THE
SEA.</h2>

<h3>Old Ceremonies&mdash;Sea
Songs&mdash;Etiquette&mdash;Punishments&mdash;Superstitions&mdash;The
Sea Language.</h3>

<p>The customs of the sea life are, of course, changing with the
change in ships. The language of the sailor, sea traditions, laws
unwritten but, hitherto, severely-observed, governing life on
ship-board, the etiquette of the sea, in fact, are dying with the
century, but some yet survive: the steel sailing ship is still a
"wind-jammer"; and though so many of our merchant seamen are
foreigners, they are mostly of nationalities that are free of the
masonry of the ocean.</p>

<p>Men no longer object to going to sea on a Friday, nor do they
prefer Sunday because it is lucky. With owners Sunday is the
favourite sailing day, for to arrive or to leave port on this day
means no time lost in unloading or loading, and on the coast it is
contrived as much as possible that small steamers should be at sea
on this day. Can it be that, after all, this Friday and Sunday
superstition was invented, or at all events encouraged, by bygone
generations of shipowners for mercenary reasons? I have known
sailors and the sea for five-and-twenty years, and never met a man
who would not sooner have sailed every voyage on a Friday than be
hauling h'nes and making sail on Sunday.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 162</p>-->

<p>Occasionally, though very seldom, the ceremony of shaving on
crossing the Equator is observed. It was always an objectionable
piece of buffoonery, but the wretched imitations which nowadays
sometimes take place on some outward-bound Australian passenger
ships are mostly got up by the passengers themselves; the modern
forecastle sailor having too much work and too little to eat, to
have heart enough to originate anything that would deprive him of
an hour or two of his watch below. The performance has been much
too often described to justify me wasting space upon it, but the
ceremony, as we read of it now, is gentle fun compared with this
custom of making a crew free of the Tropics on first crossing the
line, as described in some verses written by J. Kirkpatrick, M.D.,
in 1750:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why should the Muse the Tropic past omit,<br>
Or sailors' custom of observing it<br>
Where travellers, when first arrived, advance<br>
To buy their freedom, sugar, rum, and nantz;<br>
But if pale poverty the wight surround.<br>
Or surly he refuse his quart and pound.<br>
If he assert the hardship of his cause,<br>
And rave of British rights and English laws;<br>
With little form his slender plea they try,<br>
Who must be moisten'd if his jury's dry.<br>
Strait on a well-pois'd pole is culprit swung,<br>
His arms embrace the rope by which it's slung.<br>
Aloft! they cry, and lo, aloft he's soar'd,<br>
The highest mortal we survey on board;<br>
But let his future fate inform us all,<br>
The highest have the greatest height to fall.<br>
Amain! they cry, and downward swift he slides,<br>
Cuts the thin air, and wond'ring flood divides;<br>
Again aloft he does not long remain.<br>
Alas! he rises but to fall again;<br>
Thrice the blithe crew the diving miser see,<br>
And the third plunge completely sets him<br>
free. Joyous I yield my mulct, with this remark,<br>
'I'll treat ten crews, ere I'll invite a shark.'"</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 163</p>-->

<p>I have not heard of any instance of "burning the dead horse"
within the last few years, nor have I seen the ceremony so often
described in print as that of shaving, common both on men-of-war
and merchantmen fifty years ago. "The dead horse" is typical of one
month's pay advanced to a seaman when he ships, and which after
twenty-eight days at sea has been worked out. The horse's body is
made out of a cask, sometimes covered with old tarred canvas; swabs
and oakum form the tail and the mane; and, if the thing is meant to
be very elaborate, a couple of bottles, with their hollow ends
filled with phosphorus, are inserted for eyes. Then comes a
procession round the deck, usually in the second dog watch, to the
sound of a well-known chanty, sung as a dirge. After the
procession, the horse is put up to auction, when the sailors have
an opportunity of displaying their wit. Finally, a rope is passed
round the horse, and to the rude melody of the long-drawn chorus,
it is pulled slowly up to the foreyard-arm, while both watches join
in singing:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, old horse, your time has come,<br>
And we say so, for we know so!<br>
Altho' many a race you've won.<br>
Oh, poor old man!<br>
You're going now to say good-bye,<br>
And we say so, for we know so;<br>
Poor old horse, you're going to die!"</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 164</p>-->

<p>And thus through many verses until it reaches the yardarm, where
a hand is waiting to cut it adrift Sometimes as the horse leaves
the rail it is set on fire; but this detail depends on
circumstances. Anyhow, as it splashes into the sea, the men's
hearts grow lighter with the knowledge that their dead horse has
gone, and that pay has begun. Essentially a rite belonging wholly
to the forecastle hands, "the after guard" seldom or never took
notice of or part in it. A ghastly story is still extant of how, on
one dark night of storm, an unpopular and tyrannical officer,
coming forward while the ceremony was in full swing, and foolishly
attempting to stop the proceedings, was promptly knocked on the
head by the exasperated men, lashed to the horse, and then swung
aloft to where the sailor crouched, knife in hand; the rope was
cut, and the officer thus met his doom.</p>

<p>Sea chanties are peculiar to the merchant service. Some of these
songs go back to the time of the French War, but many of them have
an American origin&mdash;the New Orleans cotton trade, when niggers
were "screwing cotton all de day," having taught our sailors many
good choruses. The American Civil War inspired several other songs,
or rather, as for example, in "Marching through Georgia," the
sailors finding the adaptability of a marching chorus to a capstan
tramp, took to singing soldiers' songs on shipboard.</p>

<p>Music in the Royal Navy is now confined to an admiral's band or
the calls of a marine bugler; from Marryat we know how the anchor
used to be weighed with a fiddler sitting on the capstan, but the
boatswain's pipe and the words "One, two, three," or some similar
unmusical sounds, are all that for ordinary rope pulling the
discipline of the service now permits. Occasionally, in the
half-occupied East and West India docks, or in a foreign harbour, a
chorus can still be heard from some merchantman weighing her
anchor, but the steam winch is rapidly displacing the capstan and
the windlass, and long before the end of the twentieth century
chanty singing will have become a memory.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 165</p>-->

<p>I am well assured that, but for the chanty singers, the modern
sea-story writers&mdash;Russell, Conrad, J. A. Barry, Bullen, and
the rest of them&mdash;would never have told their delightful
stories. It is impossible to conceive any one finding an atom of
romance in the sea-life as seen from the forecastle of a merchant
ship. The sordid round of rust-chipping, painting, and polishing
that makes up the work on board a modern steel cargo-carrier, soon
kills the imagination of the sea-apprentice. These men who have
been to sea, and from their experience have spun yarns, weaving
bright coloured threads into them, have been inspired to think and
feel by the lilt and the roll of the music of the waters.</p>

<p>How different are these sea songs to the rubbish of the music
halls! Girls in tights waving Union Jacks, and talking of
"Shivering my timbers"&mdash;an expression unheard of in the annals
of the sea&mdash;sing such rubbish as "Hilley hauley ho!" which is
Greek in the ears of sailors, but is popularly supposed to be a sea
song! Chanties are mainly composed for their usefulness, and not
for the beauty of their music or the sense of their verses; but
there are songs that from their literary value are worthy of being
sung anywhere. Here is a capstan chanty that comes from the States.
Imagine a stalwart nigger rolling out this address to the
Shenandoah River:&mdash;</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 166</p>-->

<p>Oh Shanadore, I love your daughter,<br>
A'way, you rolling riv-er!<br>
Oh Shanadore, I long to hear you,<br>
Across the wild Missouri.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>Oh Shanadore, I'll ne'er forget you,<br>
A'way, you rolling river!<br>
Till the day I die, I'll love you ever;<br>
Across the wild Missouri.</p>

<p>And no more beautiful sea song has been written than the wail of
the north country sailor:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And it's home, deary home! Oh! it's home I want to be,<br>
My topsails are hoisted, and I am bound to sea,<br>
For the oak, and the ash, and the bonny birchen tree,<br>
They are all growing green in the North Countree!"</p>

<p>The usefulness of these songs is in getting a long or a short
pull, a strong pull, and a pull altogether. For instance, even
landsmen can understand how at the word "haul" in this verse, every
man puts his weight on the rope.</p>

<p>"Haul on the bowline, the bonny main-top bowline.<br>
Haul the bowline, the bowline. <i>Haul!</i><br>
Haul on the bowline, oh bully for the bowline.<br>
Haul the bowline, the bowline. <i>Haul!</i>"</p>

<p>On a moonlight night, across the placid waters of Sydney
harbour, the green-clad hills of its shores echoing the chorus of
the chanty singer, I heard, not many weeks ago, from the room in
which I was writing, this old familiar anchor-weighing
song:&mdash;</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 167</p>-->

<p>"We are homeward bound to Liverpool town,<br>
Good-bye, fare ye well. Good-bye, fare ye well.<br>
Get up, Jack, and let John sit down.<br>
Good-bye, fare ye well,<br>
We are homeward bound, good-bye, fare ye well."</p>

<p>The same singer had opportunity, before the anchor came home,
still further to show his vocal accomplishments, and presently when
"We are homeward bound" was finished, he struck up:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then fare ye well, my bonny fair maid,<br>
We are bound to the Rio Grande."</p>

<p>And followed this with a third:&mdash;</p>

<p>Old Stormy's dead and gone to rest;<br>
To my ay, ay, ay. Mister Storm Along!<br>
When Stormy died I dug his grave,<br>
A&mdash;a&mdash;way you Storm Along!</p>

<p>I dug his grave with a silver spade;<br>
To my ay, ay, ay. Mister Storm Along!<br>
And I lowered him down with a golden chain.<br>
A&mdash;a&mdash;way you Storm Along!</p>

<p>Into his grave so deep and wide<br>
To my ay, ay, ay, Mister Storm Along!</p>

<p>These songs have all fine rolling choruses that must be heard to
be appreciated, and, though the sense of them is difficult to
understand, some glimmering of a meaning can still be found. For
example, when furling a big sail the men on the yard roll up the
heavy canvas to a chanty given in quick time, thus:&mdash;</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 168</p>-->

<p>"Way, hey, hey, yah: and we'll pay Paddy Doyle for his
boots."</p>

<p>This seems senseless enough, but Paddy Doyle was a famous
boarding-house master, and all he ever gave Jack out of an advance
note was a pair of sea boots, so that the sailor, in bitter mood,
thus mockingly refers to the reward in store for the labours of the
voyage.</p>

<p>Here is a song, still sung, that dates from the time when
Buonaparte was fresh in English memory:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Boney was a warrior,<br>
A-way a yah:<br>
O Boney was a warrior,<br>
John France swore:<br>
Boney went to Mos-cow,<br>
A-way a yah:"</p>

<p>And so on, giving a history of Boney's campaigns till his
arrival at St Helena.</p>

<p>Some of the songs tell a story such as that of&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pity Reuben Ranzo,<br>
Ranzo, boys, Ranzo,<br>
Oh Ranzo was no sailor.<br>
He shipped on board of a whaler,<br>
And could not do his duty."</p>

<p>The song goes on to tell of what he endured in consequence of
being a "New York tailor" instead of a seaman, and incidentally
gives a picture, perfectly true and possible even to-day, of what
will befall a landsman who ships as an able seaman.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 169</p>-->

<p>There is considerable humour in some of the songs, such
as:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Leave her, Johnny, leave her,<br>
For the food is poor and the wages low,<br>
And it's time to leave her, Johnny.<br>
A hungry ship and a hungry crew.<br>
Leave her, Johnny, leave her,<br>
A hard captain and chief mate too,<br>
It's time for us to leave her."</p>

<p>This is sung when the men are pumping out the ship, their last
duty after making fast to the wharf before being paid off, and in
the song they take the opportunity of expressing their opinions of
the officers in very plain language.</p>

<p>Probably one of the finest of these songs, though in print it
does not look well, is "Blow the man down." After a gale, when the
reefs are shaken out, and all hands are hoisting the topsails, the
ship still rolling in the heavy sea, making it difficult to stand
upon the wet and slippery decks, the men's oilskins glistening with
spray as the long row of them stretch along the deck with the fall
of the halliards, one fine fellow bellows out, the roar of his
strong voice sometimes lost in the greater thunder of the bellying
canvas:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh blow the man down, bullies, blow the man down.<br>
Give us some time to blow the man down;<br>
Blow the man down, you darlings lie down.<br>
Blow the man down for fair London town.<br>
Give us some time to blow the man down."</p>

<p>As the time and tune of the songs are adapted to the particular
kind of work, it is impossible to play the music of any of them;
nothing but the clank of windlass pawls or the rattle of blocks
makes fitting accompaniment. Though some of them are silly in their
wording and meaningless nowadays, many are more truly and better
songs of the sea, with perhaps the single exception of "Tom
Bowling," than anything written by Dibdin.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 170</p>-->

<p>There are other customs of the sea that will survive so long as
vessels navigate the waters, and some of these fashions, born of
the winds, one can well imagine, will even be adopted in the air
ships of the future&mdash;if they are in the womb of futurity. For
example:&mdash;The officer in charge of the ship for the time,
whether on man-of-war, or merchantman, on steamer, or sailing
vessel, on the bridge of the one or the poop of the other, keeps to
the weather side where he can feel the wind and weather upon his
cheek, can sniff the land, or sight the coming squall. They rig up
"dodgers," or weather-cloths, on steamers' bridges, to keep off the
severity of the weather from the officer's lookout&mdash;they used
to lash a bit of canvas in the weather rigging in the old days,
provided it hailed and blew great guns; but now on small
provocation a regular "cab," as locomotive drivers would call it,
with glass bull's eyes, is erected, but even mail steamer officers
and modern battleship lieutenants have not yet, when in charge,
taken to walking to leeward.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 171</p>-->

<p>When the captain or a senior officer comes on deck, the officer
of the watch walks to leeward, thus silently resigning the command
to his superior. Any seaman who has been to sea a week always goes
on the poop or bridge by the lee ladder, and woe betide the
youngster who does not quickly get into his head that rule of the
ship, that the weather gangways and ladders are for his superiors.
The starboard side, when the wind is right aft or the ship is at
anchor, is the post of honour, and the starboard ladder and
gangways then become the sacred ground. This is because in a
merchant ship the captain is supposed to command the starboard
watch, the chief mate the port, though the second mate really
commands the watch, the captain being "all night in."</p>

<p>In a man-o'-war "the usage of the sea," as it was at one time
aptly called, dates from the earliest times. Up to the present
century we compelled foreigners to lower their topsails to our
men-o'-war, only doing away with the regulation about 1806. Our own
merchantmen were liable to be proceeded against if they "so far
forgot their duty as to attempt to pass any of His Majesty's ships
without striking their topsails," and though even dipping the
ensign is now a mere act of courtesy. Commander Robinson, in <i>The
British Fleet</i>, relates that about 1894 he saw the skipper of a
west country barque let fly his top-gallant halliards to H.M.S.
<i>Royal Sovereign</i>.</p>

<p>The ceremony of relieving the wheel is exactly what it has been
for much longer than a hundred years, and it is of too practical
utility, even with the modern gear, to ever disappear. The new
helmsman goes by the lee ladder to the quarter-deck or bridge, then
steps across to the weather side on to the wheel grating behind the
steersman; as he takes the spokes of the wheel the man he is about
to relieve states the course, "Sou'-West a half West." "Sou'-West a
half West," the new man repeats, and the officer of the watch, who
is standing near, thus ascertains that the course is correctly
given and repeated. In a sailing ship, close hauled, the words will
be "By the wind," or "Full and by"; the first expression explains
itself, the second means to keep the sails full, and the ship as
near as possible to her course. In steamers the course is now given
in degrees, as "South four degrees East." "Relieve the wheel and
look out" is the form of words used by the captain, or whoever is
in temporary command, to signify that one watch may go
below&mdash;welcome order, when in bad weather some of the gear has
carried away, and all hands have, perhaps, been on deck for twenty
hours at a spell, clearing away wreckage.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 172</p>-->

<p>There are, moreover, laws unwritten, but the practical common
sense of them too apparent for lawyers to have had a hand in their
making. The law of not carrying a knife to the wheel, or a sheath
knife at all, or a marlinespike aloft without a hitch on the end of
its lanyard; of the smallest boys going to the highest points; of
landsmen and greenhorns, no matter their age or land-wisdom, rating
below the youngest ordinary seaman, or one voyage boy, are sensible
examples. A marlinespike falling from aloft point downwards on a
man's head would leave the ship short of a hand; a sheath-knife is
too handy a weapon for a "Dago" sailor to keep about him, and a
knife at the wheel a perplexing thing to the magnetised compass
needles. Manning the yards in the navy has become a ceremony of the
past, because there are now no yards to man; but, in 1811, a
sensible man wrote to the <i>Naval Chronicle</i>, pointing out the
folly and danger of the practice, though the danger was not, as he
said, from the men falling, half so much as from the system of
carrying out the order, a system which remained until quite recent
times. At the word of command, "Clear lower deck," the men were
expected to run from the lower deck to the mast-heads and "lay" out
on the yards without stopping, and this was done on all occasions
of going aloft. The violent exertion without a breather often
injured the men, for it was a common practice to punish the last
man aloft. This was humanely altered, so that the duty was divided
into three parts, "clear lower deck," "tops," "mast-heads."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 173</p>-->

<p>The boatswain's whistle, still used, though almost supplanted by
the bugle on men-o'-war, was worn by distinguished sea officers in
the reign of Henry VIII., and it seems a pity that it should be
thought of too little importance to be retained as a mark of
distinction now that boatswains and their mates have fallen off in
importance. But their falling away is nothing to that of the
lowering of the ship's cook's dignity, who, early in the century,
was an official of great importance, if only for this custom,
reported in 1815:&mdash;</p>

<p>"According to an established custom in the navy, when a ship is
paid off no officer must quit the port or consider himself
discharged until the pennant is struck, which can only be done by
the cook, as the last officer, at sunset, and should he be absent,
no other person can perform the office however desirous the
officers may be of taking their departure, and although there may
not be a single seaman or marine on board. A curious instance of
this took place on the <i>Caledonia's</i> being paid off. When the
time arrived for hauling down the pennant no cook could be found,
from which cause the officers were under the necessity of waiting a
day or two until he made his appearance."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 174</p>-->

<p>The cruelty of punishments in the navy is a stock subject. I
have heard less of the brutality of merchant service officers,
though it was, and still occasionally is, quite as bad as anything
that could be quoted, except the worst flogging cases. Hanging men
by the thumbs in the rigging, beating them with iron belaying pins,
knocking them senseless with knuckle-dusters, are incidents not
absolutely confined to, although more common on American merchant
ships, where if they are handy with their weapons, they do not half
starve their men as we do ours. Flogging in the navy has been so
often described that I shall only quote an authentic instance or
two to show that the novelists have not exaggerated. Though Marryat
in the <i>Dog Fiend</i>, it will be remembered, gives us pictures
of keel-hauling, I do not think that there is a single
authenticated instance of keel-hauling in the history of the navy,
but the gallant author of the best sea novels ever written was
often, historically, absurdly inaccurate. It is just possible,
though, that a Vanderslyperken, in a revenue cutter of William
III.'s time, <i>did</i> keel-haul a "Smallbones," for Sir William
Monson, the famous Elizabethan admiral, wrote his <i>Naval
Tracts</i> in 1640, and he suggests the punishment, but at the same
time, just as Marryat did with good effect two hundred years later,
he wrote that punishment should never be given in hot
blood&mdash;the captain should always take a night's rest before
passing sentence. Here is what Monson says:&mdash;</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 175</p>-->

<p class="newspaper">"The seaman is willing to give or receive
punishment deservedly, according to the laws of the sea, and not
otherwise, according to the fury or passion of a boisterous,
blasphemous, swearing commander. Punishment is fittest to be
executed in cold blood the next day after the offence is committed
and discovered. A captain may punish according to the offence
committed, viz., putting men in the bilboes during pleasure; keep
them fasting; duck them at the yardarm, or haul them from yardarm
to yardarm, under the ship's keel; or make them fast to the capstan
and whip them there; or at the capstan or mainmast hang weights
about their necks; or gag or scrape their tongues for blasphemy or
swearing. This will tame the most rude and savage people in the
world."</p>

<p>Of course some of this sounds savage, but it was not worse than
flogging round the fleet. And the difference in the treatment of
officers and men in the decisions of court-martials was atrociously
unfair. For instance, at a court-martial held at Portsmouth in
1804, a purser, for embezzling two firkins of butter, was sentenced
to forfeit double the value of the goods he had stolen. At the same
time and place the same court sentenced a seaman, for disobedience
of orders, to 300 lashes. But officers were not always so leniently
treated. For example:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the summer of 1810 a midshipman of the <i>Edgar</i>, then
cruising in the Belt, having been disrated for some offence, was
sent to row guard during the night, and in an endeavour to recover
favour with his captain, he landed on the island of Sayer. Here he
fell in with a party of Danish soldiers, whom he attacked with the
utmost gallantry, and defeated, but one of the boat's crew was
killed. Finding no vessels or boats to carry off, he re-embarked,
bringing away with him some fowls and two sheep. This was his
reward: Immediately on coming on board, he was put both legs in
irons, and after remaining thus for a fortnight, was tried by
court-martial, and received the following sentence, which was
carried out in every detail:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And the court do hereby sentence you to be stripped of your
uniform publicly on the quarter-deck, muleted of all your pay,
rendered incapable of ever serving His Majesty as an officer, and
finally, on the arrival of your ship in England, you are to be
drummed ashore."</p>

<p>He was a mere boy, had behaved with the greatest gallantry on
several occasions during his short career in the service, and his
offence was leaving his boat without orders, beating a detachment
of the enemy's soldiers, and carrying off some of the enemy's
live-stock!</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 176</p>-->

<p>In 1802 Sir Edward Hamilton was tried by court-martial for
cruelty to the gunner of his ship. The court dismissed the gallant
captain from the service&mdash;public opinion was too strong for it
to do otherwise&mdash;but after the excitement had died out, the
officer was reinstated. At the trial the first lieutenant stated
that Sir Edward Hamilton, on going out of the ship in the forenoon,
gave orders to the gunner to have the guns cleaned; that when Sir
Edward returned he declared his commands had not been complied
with; d&mdash;&mdash;d the gunner for an old rascal, and instantly
ordered him and his whole crew to be seized up in the shrouds. The
lieutenant said that the guns appeared to him to have been
remarkably well cleaned. The gunner, an elderly man with a family,
remained seized up about an hour and a half; then, in consequence
of the surgeon's representation, he was taken down and brought aft,
where he fainted, having previously requested Sir Edward to try him
by a court-martial. This circumstance happened during frosty
weather. The gunner's crew remained lashed in the rigging for about
four hours.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 177</p>-->

<p>A court-martial could flog a man round the fleet, or sentence
him to death, and a captain could punish at his own discretion,
subject to the usage of the service, about as wide a limitation as
it is possible to imagine, and this state of affairs remained until
nearly the middle of the century. On January 9, 1844, at Hong-Kong,
for example, two men for desertion were each sentenced to receive
100 lashes, and to be flogged round the fleet. In flogging at the
gangway, a grating was rigged, and the man spread-eagled to it, as
is often described in books, and the boatswain's mate laid on the
cat, the punishment seldom exceeding two or three dozen. In
flogging round the fleet, the culprit was lashed to a grating
rigged in one of the ship's boats, and was rowed from ship to ship
in the squadron; alongside of each ship he was given so many lashes
out of the whole number to which he had been sentenced. I have,
within the last few years, witnessed prisoners flogged in gaols,
and have seen the back of a strong man after 25 lashes,
scientifically given, look as if a broad purple sash had been
crossed upon it; this was raw flesh. The man was a garotter, and
the pity is that prisoners of this kind are not oftener sentenced
to such punishment. If 25 lashes with a modern gaol cat can flog a
man's back raw, 500 with the old service instrument of torture, it
can be understood, often killed the victim. I could quote many
cases of men flogged to death in the first decade of this century.
At a flogging inflicted at Port Mahon in the Island of Minorca in
1811, when a sailor was flogged round the ships of the
Mediterranean fleet under the command of Admiral Sir C. Cotton, an
old monk said to a naval officer:&mdash;</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 178</p>-->

<p>"You boast of humanity: what is there in all the tortures that
your nation falsely imputes to the Inquisition more protracted or
inhuman than this proceeding? Why do you suspend the lashes but to
increase the agony? The culprit has already fainted twice, yet your
surgeon authorises a continuance of the whipping. Is not the poor
wretch's back entirely flayed from his neck to the loins? Yet the
scourging still goes on, and will frequently be suspended and
renewed again before the sentence is fulfilled. What worse torture
than this could disgrace the prisoners of the Inquisition, or even
the dungeons of Algiers?"</p>

<p>So that the credit of the navy for severe punishments early in
the century, is not affected very much if keel-hauling cannot be
proved against it.</p>

<p>The case of Jeffrey the sailor is a singular example of the
trend of public sentiment in matters of this kind. The history of
this case, as told in the House of Commons Reports and the public
newspapers, shows that Jeffrey was pressed in the harbour of
Falmouth in 1807, from the Plymouth privateer schooner, <i>Lord
Nelson</i>, by the brig of war, <i>Recruit</i>, commanded by
Captain the Hon. Warwick Lake. The <i>Recruit</i> sailed for the
West Indies, and Jeffrey, in the course of the passage, stole some
drink from the gunner's cabin. Captain Lake, some days after the
theft was committed, being off the desert island of Sombrero in the
West Indies, lowered a boat and marooned Jeffrey upon the island,
leaving him nothing but what he stood upright in. News of the
affair reached England, and it created a sensation, and was the
subject of several parliamentary debates.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 179</p>-->

<p>The captain was tried by court-martial and dismissed the
service, but the trial did not take place until February 1810, the
fate of Jeffrey remaining all this time uncertain. Government
ordered a strict search to be made for Jeffrey, but nothing was
heard of him until the middle of 1810, when news came from America
that he had been rescued and landed in Boston. He had been on the
island, which is a barren rock in the Leeward group, for nine days,
and had subsisted on shell-fish and on rain-water found in the
hollows of the rock. In due course he returned to England to his
native village, Polperro, where he was met by his relatives and the
relatives of Captain Lake, who compensated him for his misfortunes
with a sum of £600, and all might have ended happily, but Jeffrey
preferred to exhibit himself at the small theatres in London, soon
lost his money, and before long died a pauper.</p>

<p>Many men have been flogged to death in the service, and the
voice of public opinion was never heard in protest, but the case of
Jeffrey set all England by the ears, and is often quoted to-day as
an example of the most awful cruelty ever perpetrated. The
captain's defence was that he thought the island was inhabited, a
statement in some measure confirmed by that of one or two officers
in the House of Commons, who said that the place was frequented by
American schooners after turtle; an American schooner <i>did</i>
find Jeffrey. If the captain really believed what he said, it does
not seem that his punishment was very much worse than that other,
perfectly legal, form of torture upon which the old monk at Minorca
expressed his sentiments.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 180</p>-->

<p>The old yarn that persons born at sea all belong to the parish
of Stepney is still believed by sailors. One old sailor proudly
introduced another old salt to me only a few weeks ago, and
announced that his friend was born in the Pacific and was a native
of Stepney! "How do you make that out?" I asked. "Well, you see,
'tis like this; my friend 'ere was born at sea, and every sailor
born at sea belongs to the parish of Stepney "; and so on, the old
yarn that I have heard a hundred times; so old that I can give
chapter and verse for it nearly a hundred years back. It has been
often explained as arising from the duty of masters of vessels of
entering in their logs all births at sea, and reporting those
births to the registrar at the first port of arrival, but why
<i>always</i> Stepney? And how is it that a learned English judge
had no explanation of it in 1813? In the Court of King's Bench in
February 1813, "a rule to show cause" was moved for against a
magistrate of Cheshire for sending a pauper who had been born at
sea to the parish of Stepney.</p>

<p>It appeared from the affidavits that a pauper having been found
in Stockport, was examined by the magistrate, who asked him where
he was born.</p>

<p>"At sea, your worship."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, if this man was born on the high seas, he
belongs to the parish of Stepney."</p>

<p>Counsel had no wish to press the matter, but the overseers of
the parish of Stepney were getting tired of this sort of thing. No
fewer than twenty-five paupers during the past year had been thrust
upon them in this fashion.</p>

<p>Lord Ellenborough presumed that all these people had not come
from Cheshire, and counsel replied no, that it was a common idea
among magistrates in all parts of England. Lord Ellenborough and Mr
Justice le Blanc said it was very curious, and it was difficult to
understand how the erroneous idea had got abroad.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 181</p>-->

<p>The language of the sea is of course altering to fit propellers,
funnel-stays, steam-winches and all the rest of the up-to-date
gear, but much of it still remains the same, and the sailor of a
hundred years ago would not be so lost in the company of the modern
men of his craft as some people imagine. The language of the sea,
if coarse, is always expressive; users of foul language ashore
swear, nearly always, meaninglessly. I wish I could print some of
Jack's sayings in proof of his wit. Here, for example, softened to
suit shore folk, is an expression of contempt for a man who is not
pulling his share on a rope, "Pull you &mdash;&mdash; etc.,
soldier; Pull&mdash;you couldn't pull fleas off a wet tarpaulin!"
The contempt of Jack for the foreigner, who by this time has all
but driven him out of the merchant service, is summed up in the way
he addresses his deadliest enemy, "Why, you
miserable-black-and-white-spotted Ethiopian, you're no better than
a &mdash;&mdash;, etc., Rooshian Finn!"</p>

<p>On a wet night, when Jack turns out in his watch below he growls
with sarcasm, "Who'd sell a farm and go to sea?" and though the
sailor is heedless of spray, and cares little for even a green sea
that wets him from head to foot, woe betide the ship's boy who has
carelessly capsized water on some place where an able seaman wants
to sit down, for as he says, to be wet <i>thus</i> is to be wet all
over. There is a delicate humour, too, in the sailor's remark when
a shipmate suggests that he should go into some particularly
dangerous part of the ship, "Ah, I see you want my clothes."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 182</p>-->

<p>The proverbial philosophy of the forecastle is better than that
of Martin Tupper. Where can be found a neater definition of a
nearly drunken man than "two sheets in the wind and the other
shivering "? And what a comical picture of slowness and indecision
is conveyed by the remark that "the fellow is backing and filling
like a billy goat in stays." I hope that the position of a ship in
stays, undecided which way to point her head, and the attitude of a
goat, doubtful where to plant his horns, are familiar enough to the
reader for him to comprehend the true inwardness of the above. "As
black as the Earl of Hell's riding-boots" is expressive if not
elegant, but "As cold as the top hank of a Greenlander's jib" is
poetic. "Soldiers' pulls" are short, useless pulls on a rope, such
as are given by a "bunt reefer and a yardarm furler"&mdash;a
description of a sailor who is the reverse of smart, for the smart
men are at the yardarms when reefing, and the duffers at the bunt
of the sail, the positions being reversed in furling.</p>

<p>Jack classes the whole human race thus:&mdash;"Dutchmen, Dagos,
Niggers, and Whitemen." I despair of making any but a sailor
understand: "Like Paddy's foresail, both tacks over the foreyard,"
or "Jammed in a clinch like Barney's bull," or the meaning of, "To
ride him down like a Yankee's main tack "; but most people will
comprehend what a badly-made garment is that which fits "like a
purser's shirt on a handspike, all over and touching nowhere"; and
what poor pudding is, "Railway duff&mdash;a plum at every station."
A saying in the bitterly reflective and self-conscious mood by the
occupants of a dirty forecastle is: "Hogs, dogs, and sailors"; and
a fellow in longshore clothes is said to be dressed in "a square
mainsail coat and a long hat with a rake aft," Certain small
coasters are sometimes accused of obtaining stores by pretending to
be in distress, and there is a story of a Welshman used to typify
these cadgers, who signalled:&mdash;"Two days, come to-morrow, from
Carnarvon, short of water and provisions." There is also a good
story of an Irish mate who, with too much rum in him, undertook to
heave the log. In mistake he handed a young countryman of his the
hour instead of the minute glass to hold.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 183</p>-->

<p>"Is it out yet, Mickey?"</p>

<p>"No, sur, nor the devil an out."</p>

<p>"Then haul in the line, by jabers, she is goin'
ninety-nine."</p>

<p>A coasting sailor is spoken of as one whose deck promenade only
affords him space for "two turns round the galley and one round the
long boat with a pull at the scuttle butt."</p>

<p>Jack's contempt for a soldier is well known. Here is one way he
has of expressing it: "A messmate before a shipmate, a shipmate
before a dog, but a dog before a soldier."</p>

<p>"You call that water fresh!" said the mate of a merchantman to a
boy who brought him a bucket of brackish water. "That fresh! why it
is as salt as Lot's wife," thus, as I heard a passenger remark who
was standing by, combining religious with nautical instruction for
the benefit of apprentices.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 184</p>-->

<p>In the sea language there are many words brought in by the
Dutch. "Schut him aft," grunts the sailor as he hauls aft a sheet,
an expression evolved thus: Order from the quarter-deck, "Haul aft
the mainsheet"; as repeated by a Dutch seaman, "De man schut haul
him aft"; then "schut him aft" grew into a regular expression.
Merchant seamen, as they pull on ropes when no chanty is being
sung, make strange discordant cries to mark the time. And it is out
of these rude, but, to the seaman, perfectly intelligible
expressions that the idiotic music hall "Yo heave ho" choruses have
been coined. "Ugh! tauten her leach! Show her foot," grunts the
sailor, as the men swing on a rope, tight as a fiddle string. The
meaning is plain; tighten the halliards till the leaches or sides
of the sail stretch again with the strain, and the foot of the
sail, hauled down tightly at its clues or corners, makes that
pretty arch or "roach" in the canvas that goes for so much in the
beauty of a ship under sail.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," is still the seaman-like way of answering an
officer, and on board of a man-o'-war the other day I heard the
lieutenant in command of the watch give orders to "belay the steam
cutter" and to "carry on the whaler," meaning he had finished with
the steamer, but he wanted the rowing-boat, called a whaler, still
kept handy. "Well the main yard," "Well all," and similar uses of
the word "well" are not so frequently heard now in the trimming of
sails, but the word is not dead. "Watch there, watch!" when the
deep-sea lead is dropped from the bows and the row of men from
forward to aft take up the cry, as they drop the coils of line to
warn the officer aft to stand by to plumb the lead, will soon no
longer be heard anywhere, for Lord Kelvin's patent sounding-machine
dropped over a steamer's stern, and getting soundings from a vessel
steaming full speed through the water, has superseded the old
deep-sea lead; and, anyhow, men seldom take soundings now, trusting
to their superior wisdom, and sometimes attempting to steam
overland in consequence.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 185</p>-->

<p>"Grog ho!" after all hands have been called in a merchant ship
is only to be found in a few, though the "she-oak net" is still an
institution in the Australian colonies where sailors are supposed
to come on board drunk more often than elsewhere, and so need a net
to catch them when they tumble off the gangway. Three or four years
ago a captain in Port Melbourne was fined for not hanging his
she-oak net under the gangways, that being a port regulation.
"She-oak" is the slang for a horrible concoction, miscalled beer,
sold in Victoria. But there is less drunkenness among seamen
nowadays. Modern Board of Trade Regulations have almost done away
with the evils of the advance note and boarding-house keepers,
runners, and the rascals who used to "shanghai" sailors have almost
disappeared, for the modern English merchantman is mostly to be
found on steamers&mdash;married men, steady fellows who very often
have served an apprenticeship to the sea in their youth, but for
some reason have not passed the "Board" as officers.</p>

<p>In my time, the story of a certain boarding-master celebrated in
Liverpool, was still possible. The qualifications for an A.B. are,
shortly, that he should be able to "hand, reef, and steer!" Paddy
the something&mdash;I forget his full name&mdash;was in the habit
of finding waifs in the street, and shipping them on outward
bounders for a commission and the advance note. He prepared his men
thus: He had a room in which they were taught the art of reefing
and furling a sail by means of a blanket rigged across two sticks;
they were taught to steer with a cart-wheel, and their education
was completed by making them walk three times round a table on
which was placed a ram's horn. Paddy would go before the
shipping-master then and swear with a clear conscience that here
was a man who had learnt to hand and reef, had taken his trick at
the wheel, and been three times round the Horn!</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 186</p>-->

<p>Nowadays, a sailor if he wants employment in a sailing ship, can
get along without a boarding-master, provided that he can prove
that he is not an Englishman, and that he is handy in the use of a
rust-chipping hammer; if he wants a berth on a crack mail steamer,
higher qualifications are looked for. He must be able to make rope
quoits for the passengers' amusement, be ready with some musical
instrument for concert purposes, have a knowledge of the management
of deck-chairs; and if to these accomplishments he can add that of
being able to slack away a boat's fall without letting her into the
water too suddenly, why so much the better for the passengers, if
an accident should happen.</p>

<p>Of course, this is all very right and proper, for the
old-fashioned merchant seaman was scarcely the kind of person to
make passengers at home by his courtesy. Here is an example: I was
shipmates with an old boatswain, so old that I should not be
believed if I stated in print what was his age. A weak-kneed young
man, having a cast in his eye, and only one arm, was among the
passengers. He was an assistant schoolmaster from an inland town,
and was on his way to New Zealand "to rough it in the colonies," as
he was fond of saying.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 187</p>-->

<p>From the time the ship cast off the tug, this poor creature was
sick, and remained so, until he had been a couple of months at sea.
Then he began to crawl about the deck, tumbling over everything and
everybody. There is no one your sailor hates more than the man who
"clutches." This fellow at every roll of the ship clutched anybody
handy from the captain to the cabin-boy, and of course the person
clutched rolled with him to leeward in the scuppers. This kind of
creature never gets his sea-legs, and is for ever an object of
contempt to sailors. The weather was clearing up after a blow, and
the passenger was sprawling about the deck, rather proud of the
improvement in his condition. Presently he caught sight of the old
weather-beaten boatswain watching him with a curious look.</p>

<p>"Ah, I see you're looking at me, boatswain; don't you think I've
improved? I am getting to be quite a seaman."</p>

<p>"Um! I calls yer a reg'lar Nelson!"</p>

<p>"Hee-hee-hee! and why a Nelson, boatswain?"</p>

<p>"Why! why! 'cause he had one arm, one eye, same as you, and
you're a dashed sight deader nor he is, long as 'tis ago since he
became a halbatross."</p>

<p>Which reminds me of a superstition that when old sailors die,
their spirits, it was once believed, took on the likeness of an
albatross; and from my own knowledge, I think this is the one old
superstition that survived until quite lately. I have met old
sailors who had a perfect horror of catching an albatross, though
they had never heard of the "Ancient Mariner." Cross-examined on
the point, they admitted, half laughing at their own folly, that
there might be something in the old yarn, and the beautiful bird
might, for all we humans knew, contain the soul of some old
salt.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 188</p>-->

<p>When I have seen sailors, the ship hove to in a gale, sleeping
out a whole watch on deck, lying in the lee scuppers with a lump of
wood for a pillow, protected, 'tis true, by their oilskins, but
with the water actually washing over them, and rain pouring down on
their faces, I have thought that their earthly pilgrimage was a
fitting preparation for the albatross stage of their existence. If
this is really what becomes of the old-time sailor, it may be
depended upon that the soul of the modern quarter-master, who
spends two hours of his watch in a comfortable wheel-house at a
steam-steering wheel, and the other two hours adjusting deck
chairs, will in a future state enter the body of a "dicky bird,"
and be quartered in a canary cage in a lady's boudoir.</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX. THE WRECK LIST OF THE
CENTURY.</h2>

<h3>Naval Disasters&mdash;Fires at Sea&mdash;Emigrant
Ships&mdash;Panic&mdash;Modern Wrecks.</h3>

<p>A STUDY of the list of wrecks for the last hundred years ought
to re-assure the nervous. The perils of the sea are the same, and
the men who encounter them as human as ever; steam has not altered
these two factors for better or for worse, stress of weather,
accident, and careless shipmasters are still the chief causes of
disaster, but these causes are less frequent now than they ever
were, and would be still less if carelessness were more adequately
punished.</p>

<p>In the first twenty years of the century, a greater number of
lives were lost by shipwreck in the Royal Navy than have been lost
in men-o'-war during the whole reign of Queen Victoria. In the
first fifty years of the century very many masters of merchant
vessels, whatever high qualities of seamanship they possessed, were
astoundingly ignorant of navigation, and drunkenness in this class
of men was looked upon as an amiable weakness inseparable from the
profession. Committees of inquiry into the causes of wrecks were
appointed by the House of Commons in 1834 and again in 1843. In
1836 the first committee reported upon the general question of
causes of shipwreck, and came to the following
conclusion:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Defective construction of ships;<br>
(2) Inadequate equipment;<br>
(3) Imperfect state of repair;<br>
(4) Improper or excessive loading;<br>
(5) Inappropriateness of form;<br>
(6) Incompetency of masters and officers;<br>
(7) Drunkenness of officers and men;<br>
(8) Operation of marine insurance;<br>
(9) Want of harbours of refuge;<br>
(10) Imperfection of charts.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 190</p>-->

<p>The second committee's report was much to the same purpose, and
the evidence upon which these reports were based was just as
contradictory as it always is when a number of experts are called
whose interests bias their statements. Of the causes stated in
these reports, I have no hesitation in asserting almost the only
preventable one now remaining is that of careless navigation; while
the want of proper discipline and training is responsible for loss
of life in merchant vessels in nine cases out of ten when accident
happens.</p>

<p>But at the end as at the beginning of the century the
<i>accident</i> remains, sudden disasters will happen, and no human
devices will avert them.</p>

<p>Disasters in the present Royal Navy&mdash;notwithstanding
certain well remembered calamities&mdash;are wonderfully rare
compared with the wooden period of the service, and some of the
horrors of a hundred years ago are to-day almost an impossibility.
Take, for example, the case of the <i>Queen Charlotte</i>, Howe's
flagship, in June 1794, and remembered, not for this fact only, but
as being one of the worst disciplined ships in the service. She
caught fire in March 1800 through carelessness&mdash;a slow match
on the lower deck among loose straw&mdash;in half-an-hour she was
burning fiercely, yet remained afloat for four hours. Though this
happened on a fine morning in sight of Leghorn, and there were
plenty of boats about, and the officers behaved with the greatest
courage and coolness, the captain and many others going down with
the ship, out of 900 persons on board only 120 were saved. It would
be practically impossible to parallel this case in a modern steel
battleship. From fire there is hardly any danger, and if in a
modern war vessel those on board are given fine weather and four
hours' grace when disaster comes to them, it is difficult to
imagine how a single life could be sacrificed.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 191</p>-->

<p>What a contrast to this story is that of the <i>Magicienne</i>
in 1831. A fire was discovered close to the magazine, at night,
many miles from land. The ship's corporal, who found it, went
quietly and reported the matter to the officer of the watch, who in
turn reported it to Captain Plumridge, who, coming on deck in his
night-gown, ordered the drummer to beat to quarters, and sent a man
aloft to see "what that ship is to leeward."</p>

<p>"I see no ship, sir," sang out the man when he got aloft.</p>

<p>"You do, sir, I can see her," then turning to the man at the
wheel the captain added, "and so can you, I am sure," and the
helmsman, afraid to say no, agreed.</p>

<p>"Then put your helm up and bear down to her," ordered the
skipper; meantime fire hose had been ranged along the decks, the
men had fallen in quietly at their stations, and in ten minutes the
fire, which had gone within three inches of the powder, was
extinguished, many of the people on board not knowing until all was
over that the affair was anything more than a fire drill, while
those who had seen the fire and were inclined to be nervous, were
quite reassured at the prospect of relief in the imaginary ship to
leeward created by the happy idea of the captain.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 192</p>-->

<p>In the first ten years of the century we lost thousands of
seamen by shipwreck, I could run off a long catalogue of our
losses, many of them, of course, a consequence of putting to sea in
bad weather, and in such circumstances only justified by a state of
war, but many of them undoubtedly from want of discipline and the
unseaworthiness of ships. The <i>Brazen</i> sloop of war went
ashore off Newhaven in 1800 and drowned 119 of her crew. The
<i>Invincible</i>, a seventy-four, next year, drowned 400 when she
stranded off Yarmouth. The <i>Apollo</i> frigate, in 1804, with the
greater part of the West India convoy, about forty sail of merchant
vessels, was driven on the coast of Portugal with a loss of life of
200. Six years later the <i>Nymph</i> and the <i>Pallas</i> were
lost in the Firth of Forth, drowning many; the <i>Minotaur</i>
stranded on the Dutch coast, losing 500 of her crew, and the
<i>Satellite</i> foundered at sea with all hands. The years 1810-11
were the most disastrous of the century to the navy. In November
and December of the first year, violent storms prevailed in the
Atlantic, and the wreck list, leaving out all merchant vessels and
minor casualties, runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>The <i>Saldanha</i>, frigate, went ashore on the Irish coast,
200 drowned; the <i>Hero</i> and the <i>Grasshopper</i> were driven
on to the Haak Sand in the Texel; the <i>St George</i> and the
<i>Defiance</i> on to the Jutland coast, and a convoy of 100 ships
bound from Sweden to England went with the first two, the whole
loss of life amounting to about 4000.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 193</p>-->

<p>I suppose in a chapter on wrecks, one <i>must</i> re-tell old
stories; though I should hope the narratives of the <i>Kent</i>,
the <i>Birkenhead</i>, and the <i>Sarah Sands</i> disasters are in
every barrack library, one cannot write the sea story of the
century without some mention of them. A wooden sailing-ship on fire
in a gale of wind with 640 people on board, more than 100 of them
women and children, and 569 saved&mdash;this is the story of the
<i>Kent's</i> loss in the Bay of Biscay in 1825. The ship was
outward bound to the East Indies with troops, and the perfect
discipline of the soldiers in the face of three alternatives of
death&mdash;by drowning, by burning, or by being blown up when the
fire reached the magazine&mdash;enabled the little brig
<i>Cambria</i> to rescue so many. The only available boat, in the
face of the heavy sea, and the distance it was necessary for the
<i>Cambria</i> to keep away from the burning ship, took
three-quarters of an hour to make the trip between the two vessels,
and while this boat was carrying the women and children from the
ship to the rescuing vessel, the soldiers sat about on hatches and
waited quietly for the end.</p>

<p>Some miserable idiot in a theatre cries "Fire!" and the whole
house becomes a body of lunatics, men trampling women under foot,
and tearing each other to pieces to escape from a safe building. In
momentary expectation of being blown to pieces by gunpowder, the
soldiers of the 31st Regiment, for something like twelve hours on
the burning <i>Kent</i>, in no instance forgot the teaching of the
parade ground.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 194</p>-->

<p>Again, the <i>Birkenhead</i>&mdash;ever to be remembered and
quoted&mdash;a Government paddle steamer bound to the Cape of Good
Hope with reinforcements for the troops at the Caffre War, struck a
rock near Simon's Bay on February 26, 1852, and out of 638 people
on board only 184 were saved. Of the number drowned 358 were
soldiers, 9 of them officers. They were drafts of the 2nd Queens,
6th Royals, 12th Lancers, 12th Foot, 43rd, 45th, the 60th Rifles,
73rd, 74th, and 91st Regiments. Captain Wright, the senior
surviving soldier officer, in his official report, said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"The order and regularity that prevailed on
board from the time the ship struck till she totally disappeared
far exceeded anything that I thought could be effected by the best
discipline, and it is the more to be wondered at, seeing that most
of the soldiers had been but a short time in the service. Every one
did as he was directed, and there was not a murmur or a cry among
them until the vessel made the final plunge. I could not name any
individual officer who did more than another. All received their
orders and had them carried out as if the men were embarking,
instead of going to the bottom; there was only this difference,
that I never saw embarkation with so little noise and
confusion...One fact I cannot omit mentioning: when the vessel was
just going down, the commander called out, 'All those that can
swim, jump overboard and make for the boats.' Lieutenant Girardot
and myself were standing on the poop, and we begged the men not to
do so as the boat with the women would be swamped. Not more than
three made the attempt. All the women and children were saved."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 195</p>-->

<p>The last scene remembered by the survivors, and by millions,
generations later, was that of the soldiers drawn up on the poop,
at their head Colonel Seton, the commanding officer, the ship
breaking in halves, the waters closing over her, and the men still
quietly waiting for the end&mdash;-a picture in the minds of men in
the beauty of its unselfish heroism unsurpassable on sea or
land.</p>

<p>The story of the <i>Sarah Sands</i>, an iron steamer that left
Portsmouth with 300 of the 54th Regiment, bound for India in
November 1857, is a more fortunate instance. Good seamanship on the
part of Captain Castles was aided by the magnificent bravery and
discipline of the soldiers, and the ship, though so badly on fire
that a small magazine aft exploded and blew her port quarter out,
was navigated for ten days in this state and made the Mauritius
without the loss of a life. We have in the case of the trooper
<i>Warren Hastings</i> in 1897 a similar instance. Every one was
saved, and the commanding officer in his despatch, telling of the
wreck, explains what happened in these words:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"From my position on the bridge, where I could
see distinctly, I was particularly struck by the way in which, when
the disembarkation of the men was stopped to allow the ladies,
women, and children to get ashore, the former stood quietly on one
side to permit them to pass, and then resumed their own
disembarkation in perfect order, when all the time it appeared to
be a question of moments when the vessel would heel over."</p>

<p>In the old navy, unseaworthy ships were common; nowadays they
are rare, perhaps unknown. It was natural that while the service
was in a transition stage such an unfortunate experiment as that of
the <i>Captain</i> should be possible, but, with the one exception
of the <i>Megaera</i>, I can recall no instance where the Admiralty
can be seriously blamed for sending unseaworthy ships to sea.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 196</p>-->

<p>Captain Cowper Coles designed the <i>Captain</i>, in the later
sixties, when it was an indispensable condition for the naval
constructor to build men-o'-war to sail as well as steam, and yet
to be what we then called modern ironclads. The ship had two heavy
turrets, and only 9 ft. of freeboard, and along the turrets ran a
light hurricane deck.</p>

<p>On the night of September 7, 1870, the <i>Captain</i> was off
Cape Finisterre in company with a squadron; it was blowing a gale,
and, though steam was up, the propeller was not moving, or was
revolving at dead slow, but three double-reefed topsails and the
fore-topmast stay-sails were set&mdash;canvas that, in the
circumstances, in a seaworthy ship would have been perfectly safe.
At midnight, when the starboard watch was mustering, the ship
lurched heavily to leeward, and the captain gave orders to let go
the topsail halliards and sheets, but before the men could reach
the belaying pins, the ship heeled far enough to starboard for the
wind to act upon the under side of the hurricane deck; the top
hamper of turrets did the rest, and in a few moments she turned
completely bottom upwards. The gunner and seventeen seamen were all
that escaped out of about 490.</p>

<p>There had been no time to launch boats, and many of the
survivors actually saved themselves by crawling out of the ship's
ports on to her bottom, and getting into a boat that happened to
float near them. Captain Burgoyne, who commanded the ship, was seen
clinging to another boat that was floating bottom upwards; the
survivors in the launch tried to reach him, but failed to pull the
heavy boat against the head sea. One of the men offered to throw
his commanding officer an oar.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 197</p>-->

<p>"For God's sake keep your oars, men, you will need them." These
were Burgoyne's last words, and he was not seen again.</p>

<p>The boat made Finisterre at daylight; at about the same time the
remainder of the squadron missed the <i>Captain</i> and saw, where
she should have been, the evidence of floating wreckage that told
of her fate. Though very young at the time, I well remember the
sensation at Portsmouth when the news arrived. From one street
alone thirty widows stood among the crowd of weeping women outside
the dockyard gates, in the vain hope of hearing that another boat
had turned up.</p>

<p>The <i>Captain's</i> unseaworthiness, as I have said, was an
unfortunate error born of the peculiar transition conditions in
which the building of warships then was. The wreck of the
<i>Megaera</i>, an iron steamer, cannot be excused on these
grounds. In the spring of 1870 she was sent to Australia with
relief crews for the squadron on the station, her total complement
making altogether about 330 men. A few days after sailing she was
compelled to put back, owing to her leaky state, and was patched up
and sent off again. After leaving the Cape of Good Hope, and when a
thousand miles from the island of St Paul's, the leak broke out
again, and steadily gained, so that the captain, finding that he
could not keep her afloat, ran the ship for St Paul's, and on June
19, she was beached in such poor harbour as the almost barren rock
affords. The ship's company were landed and remained a month before
communication was made with a passing vessel, but two months longer
elapsed, owing to weather conditions and the remoteness of the
place, before the people could be embarked.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 198</p>-->

<p>During this time the castaways had fared well through the
forethought of the captain and the perfect discipline of all hands.
Everything that could be removed from the ship was saved, and the
men were kept well employed in building huts, husbanding water,
fishing, and similar occupations. At the time of the wreck, St
Paul's was occupied by a few fishermen, whose half-dozen huts
formed the only settlement, but the industry of the crew of the
<i>Megaera</i> converted the place into quite a large canvas and
wood township; among other things they constructed a regular water
supply, bringing the water from a reservoir on a hill by the aid of
machinery from the wreck and 800 ft. of the ship's fire hose.</p>

<p>In an official report on the loss of his ship, Captain Thrupp
said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"The edges of the hole in one of the iron
plates through which water leaked into the ship were so thin that
they could easily be bent with two fingers. Many of the girders
were eaten through at the bottom and others nearly so." Said the
captain: "Breaking up as the ship was, the girders separating from
the bottom, that bottom leaky in one place and very thin in many
more, the pumps continually being choked with pieces of iron, and
those thick pieces, I could not with so many lives at stake persist
in proceeding on the voyage."</p>

<p>The ship was twenty-two years old when she started, was placed
at the bottom of the <i>Navy List</i>, and had been reported
unseaworthy for any but short trips. At an inquiry the captain was
honourably acquitted, and those responsible for sending her to sea
severely censured.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 199</p>-->

<p>In the old navy there was no lack of courage to meet disaster,
but in the modern service the behaviour of the men of the
<i>Vanguard</i>, of the <i>Victoria</i>, and in that happier
instance of the <i>Calliope</i>, for the perfect discipline and
magnificent self-control of all ranks, will be remembered so long
as England has a navy. When the <i>Vanguard</i> was rammed by the
<i>Iron Duke</i> in the Irish Channel in September 1875, the
<i>Vanguard</i>, having a quality of seaworthiness that enabled her
to keep afloat a reasonable time, her crew, owing entirely to this
fact and their perfect discipline were, every one of them, saved.
The ship kept afloat a little more than an hour from the time she
was rammed, and rather less than twenty minutes of that period were
devoted to saving the 400 persons that made up the ship's
complement&mdash;the remainder of the time was given to endeavours
to save the ship. The court-martial found fault with those
responsible for not giving more time to the last operation, and the
finding of that court-martial was very likely in Admiral Tryon's
thoughts in his last moments on the bridge of the
<i>Victoria</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Victoria</i> was rammed by the <i>Camperdown</i> in June
1893, off Tripoli, and she went down in less than fifteen minutes,
yet nearly half (359 out of 650) the ship's company were saved,
though most of the short time given to them was spent in trying to
save the ship, and the boats of the ships in her company were kept
back until the last moment. At the court-martial, it was found
"with the deepest sorrow and regret that the collision was due to
an order by the late Commander-in-Chief, Vice-Admiral Sir George
Tryon, to turn the divisions of the fleet sixteen points inwards,
when the columns were only six cables apart." Captain Bourke, when
before the court, read a defence that in every line of it showed a
chivalrous desire to screen the blunder of his dead superior, and
the last few sentences of this paper best describe how the modern
British sailor can die:&mdash;</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 200</p>-->
<!--<p class="a">Page 201</p>-->

<p class="newspaper">"When the crushing blow delivered by the ram
of the <i>Camperdown</i> was felt, the impression that passed
through every one's mind must have been one of serious
apprehension. No one in the ship, knowing what had happened, could
have failed to appreciate that the conditions were certainly
serious. With this in view, I should like to lay before the court a
few remarks on what, I submit, was the discipline and self-control
exhibited by all. There was absolutely no panic, no shouting, no
rushing aimlessly about. The officers went quietly to their
stations. Everything was prepared, and the men were all in their
positions for hoisting out the boats or performing any duty they
may have been ordered to carry out. The men on the forecastle
worked with a will until the water was up to their waists, and it
was only when ordered aft that they left their work to fall in on
the upper deck with the remainder of the ship's company. In the
case of the men working below, I was a witness of their coolness
when the order was passed down for every one to go on deck. There
was no haste or hurry to desert the flat. I can further testify to
the men below in the engine-rooms. In the starboard one and all
were in their stations. The engineer officer was there, the
artificers and stokers also. I am sure that those in the port
engine-room and the boiler-rooms were equally true to themselves,
to the country they were serving, and to the trust reposed in them.
In all the details of this terrible accident one spot especially
stands out, and that is the heroic conduct of those who to the end
remained below, stolidly, yet boldly, at their place of duty. All
honour to them especially. The men fallen in on the upper deck
showed the same spirit. I would recall to you what I described in
my evidence. When the men were turned about to face the ship's
side, it must have passed through the minds of many that to look
out for oneself would be the best thing to do. The men must have
seen the others coming wet from forward, which, in itself, might
have increased their apprehensions. This order to turn about was
given apparently about a minute before the end, and I can hear of
not one single instance of any man rushing to the side. It only
wanted two or three to start a panic, but I think it should be on
record that not one was found who had not that control over himself
which characterises true discipline and order.<br>
<br>
"It has been shown in evidence that no one jumped from the ship
until just as she gave the lurch which ended in her capsizing. I
imagine there is not a single survivor who can give any clearer
reason for his being saved than that he was more fortunate than his
neighbours. There is one deeply sad circumstance connected with the
accident, and that is the very large proportion of midshipmen who
lost their lives. These young officers at the commencement of their
career were thus 'cut off,' but it will be to their undying honour
that, young as they were, they also showed that spirit of trust and
bravery, and one and all remained at their posts on deck till the
end. There is, no doubt, that among those lost many individual acts
of heroism and disregard of self must have been displayed, but I
regret that I am only in a position to state one. This is the case
of the Rev. Samuel Norris, Chaplain of the <i>Victoria</i>, than
whom no one in the ship was more beloved and respected. It is his
words, 'Steady, men, steady,' when the end came, which bring before
one the appreciation of his coolness and valour, even at the moment
of the ship capsizing. We only hear of him, careless of his own
safety, exhorting the men to be cool and calm. In his daily life on
board, he mixed with the men, and knew all their thoughts, and
advised them in their troubles. A noble character like this
inculcates by his example the discipline and obedience which were
shown on board the <i>Victoria</i>. Amongst those saved, equal acts
of bravefy and coolness were displayed."</p>

<p>A few months ago, I talked with a man who was saved from the
<i>Victoria</i>, and he, not knowing I had the least idea of
printing his words, described what he saw of the last moments of
those on the upper bridge of the ship.</p>

<p>"She was heeling over at such an angle that the Admiral was
compelled to grasp firmly with both hands the bridge railing. Then
he caught sight of a midshipman standing beside him and let go one
hand to wave the boy away, saying as survivors have reported:
'Don't stop there, youngster, go to a boat.' These were his last
words."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 202</p>-->

<p>The boy to whom he spoke was Herbert Marsden Lanyon of Belfast,
seventeen years of age, and only entered on the <i>Britannia</i> in
1890. The next moment the ship capsized. The Admiral and the
midshipman when last seen were still waiting quietly for the end.
What less could a nation expect from Tryon? But what noble
inspiration braced this boy to face death thus, and make an ending
of, at least, an equal greatness!</p>

<p>Of other naval disasters, that of the <i>Eurydice</i> most
nearly resembles, in the manner of its happening and its
suddenness, that of the <i>Captain</i>. Out of her complement of
300 only 2 were saved. She was a sailing frigate, used as a
training ship for ordinary seamen and boys, and she capsized off
the Isle of Wight in a sudden squall in 1878. Before sail could be
reduced, the ship fell on her beam ends, then filled and went down.
That a ship of her class should be lost in such circumstances is
wholly irreconcilable with any principles of seamanship. The
captain was a man of large experience in sailing ships, but the
<i>Eurydice's</i> lower deck ports were open, and when she lay over
the water poured in, and completed the mischief. It is alleged that
she was known to be crank, yet was carrying every stitch of canvas,
and the state of the weather certainly did not justify doing this
with the lower deck ports open.</p>

<p>The <i>Atlanta</i>, a similar class of vessel employed in the
same service, left Bermuda in 1880 with 280 people on board, and
she was never afterwards heard of; it is surmised that she went
down in one of the heavy gales prevailing in the Atlantic at that
period, in which many merchantmen were lost.</p>

<p>The escape of the <i>Calliope</i> from the hurricane in 1889 at
Samoa has been often described; all that I shall write of it here
was related to me on the deck of the ship when she came into Sydney
harbour to repair damages.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 203</p>-->

<p>When ship after ship had gone ashore, and it was plain the
<i>Calliope's</i> anchors could not be expected to hold much
longer, there came a moment when Captain Kane had to decide upon
one of two courses of action. Such a moment as this is the test of
all others of the fitness of a man to command. It was necessary to
act without faltering, immediately. The life teaching of a naval
commander is directed towards preparing him for such a crisis, and
Captain Kane did honour to his training. To risk the lives of all,
slip the cables and head straight out, taking the chances of the
machinery breaking down, the engine-room being swamped, a lack of
power in the engines to drive the ship through the sea, the rudder
breaking and the ship becoming unmanageable; or to beach her in a
sandy place where the ship would probably be wrecked, but the lives
of the crew saved&mdash;these were the alternatives.</p>

<p>Captain Kane decided. The cables were slipped, the engines were
put full speed ahead, every pound of steam and every revolution of
the screw that the best of engineers and stokers could bring to the
aid of the ship were there, and the fight began.</p>

<p>The American flagship, the <i>Trenton</i>, had at this time so
dragged that she lay right in the channel, leaving insufficient
room for the <i>Calliope</i> to clear her. It was necessary to pass
to leeward of the American. The movement needed delicate skill and
the steadiest nerve to direct the steering. To collide with the
<i>Trenton</i> would be as fatal as to touch the reef.</p>

<p>Slowly the engines of the <i>Calliope</i> forced her ahead. She
plunged and rolled, and the seas broke over her decks, washing away
the boats and all that was moveable, every instant threatening to
flood the engine room. Then at last came the moment when she was
abreast of the <i>Trenton</i>. For an instant the vessels were so
close together that it seemed as if their yards would interlock.
Just in time, the <i>Calliope</i> rolled outward from the
<i>Trenton</i>, and when she recovered and rolled the other way the
danger was over. The shave was so close that the <i>Calliope</i> as
she forged ahead carried away some of the <i>Trenton's</i> gear,
leaving part of her figure-head in the <i>Trenton's</i> cabin.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 204</p>-->

<p>Upon the vessel's bridge beside his commander stood
Navigating-lieutenant Henry Pearson, and the tremendous
responsibility of this time was upon the lieutenant's shoulders as
well as upon those of the captain. Apia harbour is difficult to
navigate at all times&mdash;a vessel's course has to be steered by
certain marks upon the land, which are none too easily
distinguishable in the best of weather, but, with all the added
difficulties of the storm at this supreme moment there was the
danger of collision. The writer was told by an eye-witness that
Captain Kane, as the <i>Calliope</i> drove towards the
<i>Trenton</i>, turned to his lieutenant and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, Mr Pearson, what do you think of it? Shall we clear
her?"</p>

<p>"We must&mdash;or go over her," answered the other.</p>

<p>And the <i>Calliope did</i> clear the American. As she passed
out to sea leaving the <i>Trenton</i> driving helplessly towards
the reef to share the fate of the other vessels, Admiral Kimberley
of the <i>Trenton</i>, who was on the bridge of his ship, waved his
cap. Then the American sailors, seeing the Britishers forging their
way from danger to safety, forgot their own peril, and manned the
rigging and gave three hearty cheers.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 205</p>-->

<p>Then the outer reef was cleared, leaving less than sixty yards
of sea room to spare. Outside it blew harder even than it was
blowing in the harbour; but outside there was sea-room, and the
<i>Calliope</i>, now safe, stood off the coast until the weather
moderated.</p>

<p>Upon the good seamanship and steady nerves of those on deck the
issue of that day depended; but below, in the engine-room and
stokehold, courage, skill, and faithful service in no less degree
were needed. From the gold-laced chief engineer upon whom the
responsibility rested, to the youngest grimy coal trimmer whose
sole duty it was silently to shovel coal even though his last
moment had come to him while doing it, all did their allotted tasks
in a manner well worthy of the brave man who commanded them. Every
one belonging to this department was on duty, and there remained
for sixteen hours. The pitching and rolling of the ship were so bad
that, in firing the boilers, the men nearest the furnace doors were
in no small danger of being pitched headlong into the furnace, and
so a man held a ringbolt with one hand, and with the other grasped
a comrade's waistbelt, while he threw coal upon the fires.</p>

<p>The engineer in charge told me that the power developed by the
machinery was equal to, if not greater than, would propel the ship
at 15 knots an hour in smooth water, and yet in the hurricane the
<i>Calliope</i> at no time made more than steerage way. In the
stokehold not a sound was heard but the ring of the fire shovels,
and in the long hours of suspense and danger no man murmured, nor
by any man below was a question asked as to the progress of the
ship, or the chances of Hfe and death.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 206</p>-->

<p>There are plenty of naval disasters from which I might go on
selecting instances of individual courage as well as collective
coolness, and make a book of the subject. The <i>Orpheus</i>, a new
screw steam corvette, commissioned for service as flagship of
Commodore Burnett of the Australian squadron, went ashore on the
bar, at the entrance of Manukau harbour, New Zealand, and out of
her complement of 280, the commodore, 22 officers, and 167 men were
lost. The cause of the disaster was a shifting shoal that the local
pilots did not seem to have taken account of The great loss of life
was caused by the heavy sea running on the bar, breaking right over
the ship, and the absence, for many hours, of any efficient
life-saving appliances. With the <i>Orpheus</i> went down many
valuable early records of the Australian naval station. In 1847,
the <i>Avenger</i> was lost off Galita; out of 250 only 4 were
saved, and among the drowned, Lieutenant Marryat, son of the
novelist, died bravely endeavouring to launch a boat. In the latter
half of the century, besides the ships I have mentioned, there
have, of course, been numerous wrecks of men-o'-war. The
<i>Wasp</i> went ashore in a gale on Tory Island, off the
north-west coast of Ireland in 1884, and 52 lives were lost; and
the <i>Serpent</i> met with a similar disaster in 1890, off the
coast of Corunna, drowning 173 persons. With the exception of the
instances I have quoted, the loss of life in the last fifty years
has, however, been very small, and in every single instance all
hands have behaved perfectly.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 207</p>-->

<p>We have been fortunate, considering all things, in our immunity
from accidents with steam and gunpowder on modern war vessels.
Quite as many men have been killed by accidents with the old
thirty-two pounders as have been injured by the modern weapons. The
<i>Thunderer</i> has been the unluckiest ship in the service in
this respect. In 1876, one of her boilers burst, killing 45 men and
injuring 50 others, and four years later one of her big guns
exploded, killing 2 officers and 8 men, and injuring about 35
others. Coal gas was the cause assigned for the blowing up of the
<i>Dotterel</i> in the Straits of Magellan in 1881, by which about
145 of the ship's company were drowned. On the <i>Cordelia</i> in
1891, while on the Australian station, a gun burst, killing 2
officers and 4 men. On the torpedo-destroyer <i>Bullfinch</i>, in
July 1899, 10 men were killed by an accident to the machinery, when
she was on her trial trip.</p>

<p>Men have done their duty nobly in the merchant service as well
as in the Royal Navy. The British merchant skipper has almost
invariably been the last to leave his ship. With none of the pride
of rank and commission to inspire him in the hour of peril, he has
gone down with his passengers, when the resources of his courage
and skill, unaided by little else, alas! have availed nothing; when
the boats have been washed away, or smashed in unskilful launching,
or rushed by panic-stricken mobs, he has stood on the bridge of the
liner, or hung on to the weather rigging of the clipper, dying at
his post with dignity and calm courage.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 208</p>-->

<p>The number of American and Australian emigrant ships burnt at
sea, run ashore, or foundered, between the forties and the
seventies, and the terrible loss of life involved, when one looks
down the wreck list, makes it easy to understand why a generation
ago, people were so much more chary of undertaking a sea voyage
than they are now. In the years when emigration was in full swing,
one loss succeeded another so rapidly that the "nine days' wonder"
created by the disaster was quite fresh in the memory of the public
when the next occurred. It would be tedious to describe
them&mdash;they are nearly all alike. If the catastrophe was
sudden, a panic set in, boats were smashed or washed away in the
lowering of them, and those who were saved owed nothing for their
deliverance to any such readiness for emergencies as people have a
right to expect from public carriers. Fires at sea occurred with
great frequency, and when they did take place the proportion of
persons lost was shocking. In the case of the steamer
<i>Austria</i>, for example, bound from Hamburg to New York, which
caught fire in 1858 by the extraordinary incapacity of those
responsible, 67 out of 530 on board were all that were saved.</p>

<p>Early in the century, the crews of some of the wrecked
merchantmen often thought more of breaking into the spirit-room
than rescuing the passengers, and what else could be expected from
the class of men then available? When the <i>Earl of
Abergavenny</i>, East Indiaman, went down off Portland, in 1805,
taking with her 250 people, among them her captain, Wordsworth,
brother of the poet, and seemingly of similar temperament to the
verse maker, one of the last scenes remembered is that of riotous
sailors endeavouring to break into the spirit-room, and the chief
officer standing there with a brace of pistols sternly ordering
them to die like men, and not like drunken cowards; but many of the
crew, notwithstanding, died drunk.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 209</p>-->

<p>The burning of the <i>Amazon</i> in the Bay of Biscay in January
1852, taught a lesson in the danger of wooden steamships. When she
was launched, in 1851, on the Thames, she was the largest wooden
merchant steamer in the world, and the fact that she was 300 ft.
long and had paddle-wheel engines of 800 horse power, created a
sensation. She left England with the West Indian mails on January
2, having on board 50 passengers and no crew. Three days later a
store locker in the engine-room, filled with such inflammables as
oil, tallow, and cotton waste, caught fire, and in the gale that
was blowing the ship was soon ablaze, and, worse than all, the
engines were going full speed, and no one could enter the burning
engine-room to stop them. In such circumstances it was impossible
safely to launch boats, of which there were plenty, though so
stowed that they were difficult to get at, and fitted with a patent
lowering apparatus that no one seems to have understood, or any one
ever thought about, until the disaster happened. Notwithstanding
the speed of the ship, attempts were made to lower the boats, but
in the wild scramble most of them were capsized. Ultimately, about
sixty persons escaped in three boats, the ship blowing up a few
hours later. These survivors were picked up by passing vessels,
after suffering many hours of exposure and hardship.</p>

<p>The owners of the <i>Amazon</i>, the Royal West India Mail
Company, were very unfortunate in the beginning of their history.
The Company was established in 1841, and the records of its losses
in ten years runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 210</p>-->

<p>The <i>Medina</i>, wrecked on 12th May 1844, on a coral reef,
near Turk's Island; the <i>Isis</i>, on the 8th October 1842, sunk
off Bermuda, having previously struck on a reef; the <i>Solway</i>,
wrecked off Corunna, on the 8th April 1843; the <i>Tweed</i>, on
12th February 1847, on the Alacranes rocks, Gulf of Mexico; the
<i>Forth</i>, likewise on the same rocks, on 15th January 1849; the
<i>Actaeon</i>, lost in 1844 on the Negrellos, near Carthagena; the
steamer <i>Demerara</i>, stranded in the river Avon, near Bristol,
in 1850. The wrecks of the <i>Tweed</i> and <i>Solway</i> were
attended with peculiarly distressing circumstances, involving the
loss of nearly 120 lives, and, in the case of the survivors of the
<i>Tweed</i>, accompanied by an extent of hardship and suffering
which has rarely found a parallel in the records of disasters at
sea. The surviving passengers of the <i>Tweed</i>, with little on
but their night apparel, remained for a week on a barren rock
before they could be rescued, and 72 out of 151 persons lost their
lives.</p>

<p>The modern steel passenger ship, lit by electricity, does not
catch fire, so that of late years we have had no parallel case with
that of the <i>Amazon</i>, but the modern, steel, cargo-carrying
sailing-ship has been very unfortunate in this way. I have personal
knowledge of two typical cases. In the one an iron sailing-ship,
loaded fore and aft with jute, was set on fire by the steward
carrying a naked light into the storeroom. The captain, as good a
sailor as ever stepped a deck, as soon as the alarm was given, lost
his head and opened the hatches, with the result that the ship's
hold was soon a furnace of blazing jute. Fortunately she was in a
river, and was just getting under sail. The captain in the greatest
state of excitement gave a dozen contradictory orders, and the next
thing that happened, the ship drifted ashore on the soft river bank
and there toppled on her beam ends. Her safe position enabled the
men to pay attention to the fire and obtain help from the shore,
and in the course of some hours the fire was put out. This skipper
was exactly the man one would have expected to behave well in a
critical moment at sea, yet the fire seemed to throw him entirely
off his balance, and this condition, it is more than likely,
prevailed in many of the disasters to emigrant ships.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 211</p>-->

<p>A second case shows an entirely different kind of shipmaster. A
few years ago a steel sailing-ship left Newcastle, New South Wales,
for San Francisco with the usual cargo of coals. In this particular
trade there have been an extraordinary number of cases of coal
taking fire, and no satisfactory explanation of the cause has been
found, although considerable inquiry has been made in the matter.
About two-thirds of the voyage was completed when this particular
ship's cargo was found to be burning. The captain battened down the
hatches and smothered every place where there was the least
possibility of air reaching the fire, then he got his boats all
ready for lowering, stocking them with food, water, compasses, and
such things; for at any moment the gases confined in the ship's
hold might blow up the deck, as he knew very well. Then, having
appointed men to their stations in the boats, he employed the watch
in pumping water down the hold to keep the ship as cool as
possible, and in pumping it out again as soon as the weight of it
began to tell. For many days the ship was kept steadily on her
course in this state, the iron deck sometimes getting so hot that
the men could not stand upon it, until at last the coast of
California was reached, and a tug-boat picked up just in time to
tow the ship into the bay. She was such a furnace, by this time,
that the harbour master was compelled to have her sunk on a mud
shoal, to extinguish the fire. When the tug first saw the ship with
her boats all towing astern, and looking as if something had
happened, the tug master thought he had fallen in with a stroke of
fortune in the way of salvage. But the captain of the ship was cool
enough when the tug hailed him to reply that he was all right;
there was nothing the matter, and that he intended, as there was a
fair wind, to sail to the Heads; and, ultimately, he bargained with
the tug to take him at ordinary towing rates.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 212</p>-->

<p>When emigration to Australia was at its height, an appalling
number of lives were lost, generally through panic, or want of
skill in the launching of boats. The wreck of the <i>Northfleet</i>
was awfully sudden, but panic drowned most of her passengers. She
was a wooden sailing-ship, and was run into by a steamer in the
middle of the night in January 1873, when at anchor off Dungeness
before sailing for Tasmania. On board her were about 350 persons,
mostly railway navvies, and of this number 293 were drowned. The
Spanish steamer <i>Murillo</i> was responsible for the disaster;
after cutting the <i>Northfleet</i> in two she steamed away, and
left the sinking ship to her fate. At a subsequent inquiry the
captain of the <i>Murillo</i> escaped punishment. He declared that
he believed at the time that no damage had been done by the
collision. The <i>Northfleet</i> went to the bottom within
half-an-hour&mdash;time enough to have saved most of the people if
they had not gone mad with fear, the navvies rushing to the boats,
though the captain, revolver in hand, did his best, firing at and
wounding one man, in an endeavour to save the women and children,
among them his wife, who escaped and was granted a pension from the
Civil List in recognition of her husband's bravery, for Captain
Knowles went down at his post, and most of his officers went with
him.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 213</p>-->

<p>The scene on the deck of the <i>Northfleet</i> was lamentable,
but though men shoved women aside and crowded the boats, they were
rough labourers; many of them, likely enough, had never seen a ship
before, and they behaved more like frightened sheep than like men.
Though it is a bad page in our sea story, there are worse ones in
our modern history. Italian emigrants, when the <i>Utopia</i>, in
1891, ran into H.M.S. <i>Alison</i> lying off Gibraltar, behaved
far worse, and 550 out of 830 of them were drowned through their
own fault, for there was no want of assistance; two British
bluejackets were also drowned in trying to rescue the poor
frightened creatures, and ten minutes' coolness would have saved
hundreds. Again, we cannot parallel the horrors of the
<i>Burgoyne</i> disaster when, in July 1898, she was run down by
the <i>Cromartyshire</i> off the Nova Scotian coast, drowning more
than 500 persons, only one woman, out of the hundreds on board,
being saved. The emigrants, and it is alleged some of the crew, in
their rush, drove the passengers away with boat-hooks and oars.
Some of them even used their knives to drive women and children
away from the boats, and hacked the arms of those who were holding
on to the rafts to compel them to loosen their grasp. We have
nothing like this recorded under the British ensign, but we should
be careful not to cry shame too loudly upon our neighbours. The
horrors of a sinking ship on a dark night, a thousand men and women
at a moment's notice confronted with death, and perhaps not a
hundred cool heads in the mob, are circumstances conceivable under
any flag. The burning of the sailing-ship <i>Cospatrick</i>, in
1875, was another terrible disaster. She was taking about 450
emigrants to New Zealand, and caught fire at sea. The flames were
fore and aft the ship in less than half-an-hour after they were
discovered; then the usual panic set in, and the people were
drowned by scores in attempts to launch the boats. About a dozen
persons managed to get into a boat, and after many days of
frightful suffering, three poor creatures, the only survivors, were
picked up by a passing vessel.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 214</p>-->

<p>The <i>Northfleet</i> was wrecked before fairly starting on her
voyage; the <i>Royal Charter</i> went down in sight of the home so
many of her passengers had spent the best years of their lives in
patient toil and weary waiting to see again. She was a
sailing-ship, and out of 500 persons on board, 459 were drowned,
among them many returning diggers bringing home their Australian
gold. Charles Dickens has told the story in a beautiful tribute to
the clergyman of the little Welsh village where the bodies washed
up by the sea were buried.</p>

<p>The <i>London</i>, iron screw steamer, foundered in the Bay of
Biscay in January 1866, outward bound to Melbourne. Her loss is
best remembered for the fortitude displayed by the passengers. Two
of these men, in life probably as far apart as the poles, died in
such fashion, that their names to-day live in the memory, linked
together for the likeness of their great ending.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 215</p>-->

<p>The Rev. D. J. Draper, a Wesleyan missionary, returning to
Melbourne, the scene of thirty years of his mission work, right up
to the moment of the ship sinking, with his wife, stood by the
passengers in the saloon, praying with them and exhorting them to
die quietly. "The captain tells us there is no hope," said Mr
Draper, "but I tell you there is hope for all," and by his calm
demeanour and fearless readiness to die, giving such comfort in his
words that no pulpit utterance of them could convey. On the deck,
the while, G. V. Brooke, in his time a popular tragedian, so nobly
played his last part that all England still cherishes his memory.
For hours he, in his shirt sleeves, worked at the pumps, setting an
example to the seamen, until at last the <i>London</i>, overwhelmed
by the seas, filled and made her final plunge; then the last seen
of him, he was leaning quietly on the after-hatch, swinging one of
the doors of it idly to and fro, thus waiting for the curtain.</p>

<p>No less bravely died the officers of the ship, working to the
end to save her; then, when the only boat successfully launched
shoved off, one of those in her urged the captain to join them.</p>

<p>"No," replied Captain Martin, "there is not much chance for the
boat; there is none for the ship, your duty is done, mine is to
remain here, and I will go down with the passengers, but I wish you
God-speed and safe to land."</p>

<p>These are all often-told stories&mdash;that of the wreck of the
<i>Dunbar</i> was told to me by the only survivor, still alive, and
now the chief lighthouse-keeper at Newcastle, New South Wales. The
<i>Dunbar</i>, on a wild night in August 1857, went ashore on the
South Head of Sydney Harbour, and out of 121 persons on board, one
only escaped.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 216</p>-->

<p>The vessel was a crack clipper, her passengers were mostly
well-to-do Australians returning to their homes after a trip to the
old country, and the cargo lost in her was worth £22,000. Exactly
how the disaster happened no one can tell, but it appears that the
captain, finding the ship dangerously close to the towering
sandstone cliffs, attempted to wear, but it was too late; she
struck, and a heavy sea toppled her over, broadside outwards. This
happened at ten at night, and nothing was known on shore until the
following midday when men saw floating wreckage and mangled dead
bodies jammed between the rocks. What happened to able seaman
Johnston is here told in his own words:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"I was eventually washed off the wreck, and
driven up under the cliffs, where I succeeded in securing hold of a
projecting rock. I remained there until such time as the ship broke
up. Up to this time the <i>Dunbar</i> acted as a breakwater, but as
she broke up I had to clear out. I managed to scramble from one
ledge of a rock to another, till I reached one 20 ft. high from
where I was washed up. It was about midnight on a Thursday when I
first caught the rock, and I remained there till noon on the
following Saturday (in all thirty-six hours). On the Saturday the
sea went down, and I dropped from one ledge of rock to another,
till I could see the top of the cliffs overhead. I saw one man
there in the morning, but before I could attract his attention, I
was forced to return to my retreat owing to three big seas
following one another, looking as if they would wash me away. When
I next returned I saw about a dozen men on the cliff, and soon
after a rope was lowered, which, at first attempt, did not reach
me. It was hauled up again and weighted, and on being lowered I
caught hold of it, and made it fast to myself, and was hauled
up."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 217</p>-->

<p>A more remarkable escape even than that of Johnston's was that
of a passenger in the British India steamer <i>Quetta</i>, which
struck a rock in Torres Straits in February 1890, when about 150
out of 282 persons were drowned. Two women only out of the many on
board were saved, and one of them, Miss Lacy, was picked up after
keeping herself afloat by swimming and floating on her back for
twenty hours! And here is another curious instance: In August 1852,
the ship <i>Maise</i> of Queenstown, when off Malta, was struck by
lightning and foundered instantly. The lightning passed down the
mainmast, literally cutting the vessel in two. The master by a
lucky accident caught a spar and kept himself afloat for seventeen
hours, when he was picked up by a Maltese sailing vessel; he was
the only survivor. This is an accident that we never hear of now,
but which was quite common a hundred years ago, before it was
thought worth while to run a lightning conductor from the royal
masthead to the water.</p>

<p>The wrecks of convict transports between 1833 and 1835 were of
so terrible a character that even Government was awakened to the
fact that the wretched prisoner had some claims to considerations
of common humanity. The <i>Amphitrite</i>, in 1833, went ashore on
the coast near Boulogne, the captain and surgeon refusing to
release the prisoners from their irons until too late to save them,
lest they should incur the monetary penalty that was then inflicted
for the escape of each prisoner. Men, women, and children were kept
below at the point of the bayonet; a hundred and more of their
bruised bodies washed upon the French coast was an appeal not
strong enough to move the authorities to frame better
regulations.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 218</p>-->

<p>Two years later, the <i>George the Third</i> discovered the
danger of D'Entrecasteaux's Channel leading to the harbour of
Hobart, Tasmania, by running upon a rock. The prisoners rushed to
the hatchway to try and save themselves, and were fired upon by the
guard, and more than half the 200 on board were drowned. Within a
month the Neva struck upon King's Island in Bass Straits; 22 out of
240 were saved. The <i>Governor Phillip</i>, in 1848, struck a
sandbank off Cape Barren Island on the Tasmanian coast, when by the
courage of one man most of those on board were saved. The convicts
rushed on deck, and the seamen who were getting out the boats were
surrounded by a panic-stricken mob. Lieutenant Griffiths, the
officer in command of the guard, addressed them kindly and calmly,
solemnly promising to remain on the vessel until the last man was
clear of her. The boats were lowered and the convicts rowed to the
shore, while Griffiths remained quietly knocking the irons off his
prisoners. All but four men were in safety when the vessel sank,
and the last seen of the soldier was while trying to save these
four; but he went down with them.</p>

<p>Particularly dangerous points on coasts would, one might
reasonably expect, be given a wide berth by shipmasters, but the
modern mail steamer goes ashore on them just the same as in the
time of sails, when a lee shore was dangerous&mdash;the Manacles
during fifty years has been responsible for the loss of hundreds of
lives. The <i>Mohegan</i> drowned more than a hundred people when
she went ashore on them in 1898, and the <i>Paris</i> followed not
many months later. Fortunately, owing to fine weather, no lives
were lost, and the last-named ship was ultimately got off.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 219</p>-->

<p>The P. &amp; O. Company's <i>China</i>, in the same fashion,
came to grief off the island of Perim in the Gulf of Aden, in March
1898; everybody still wonders how the disaster could have happened,
as the danger was seen by many of her passengers, and by no one
else until too late. Again, no lives were lost, and the ship by
wonderful skill in salving was got afloat again after many
months.</p>

<p>Lascar crews are sometimes objected to as inferior to other
merchant-seamen, but whatever objections there are to Lascars for
political reasons, from a personal knowledge of the true Lascar
seamen I would sooner have them than many other foreigners. Between
the Lascar, however, and the coolie, there is a considerable
difference. Wretched coolies who know nothing of the sea are often
shipped on the inferior tramp steamers, and they are dangerous. I
have seen them run below and hide themselves when a heavy sea broke
on board a steamer; but I have seen Lascars obedient and cheerfully
doing their duty when English seamen have hidden in the forecastle,
or in place of going to the ropes have stopped to argue with their
officers. The P. &amp; O. steamer <i>Aden</i>, in 1897, bound from
Yokohama to London, got into very bad weather soon after leaving
Colombo, and ended by striking the eastern end of the island of
Socotra. For seventeen days the ship, though a wreck, kept afloat,
and during that time about seventy-five persons were either washed
off or died of their sufferings.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 220</p>-->

<p>The passengers, many of them women and children, were no less
courageous. On June 22nd they celebrated the Queen's Jubilee to
keep their spirits up, though the banquet spread in the wave-washed
saloon consisted of a few nuts, a small quantity of whisky, and two
or three bottles of soda water. The captain, four officers, and the
surgeon were drowned; besides many of the Lascar crew, in
attempting to bring succour, or in moving about the wreck to find
provisions, were washed overboard, and when the <i>Mayo</i>, the
rescuing steamer, arrived, the Lascars were the last men to leave
the wreck.</p>

<p>The loss of the <i>Drummond Castle</i> off Ushant, in 1896 when
only 3 out of 250 persons were saved, is a terrible example of the
suddenness with which a good ship, belonging to a company that has
ever studied the safety of its passengers as a first consideration,
can come to disaster. Fog is the reason alleged for the ship
striking the rocks, and she sank in less than a quarter of an hour.
There was very little panic, and fifteen minutes at eleven at night
in a fog is not much time in which to launch boats. But it is quite
unaccountable how so few escaped. The Breton fishermen and their
wives, as the sea cast the bodies on shore, tenderly prepared them
for burial, supplying their finest linen and most cherished
flowers. The whole island population mourned at the simple funeral,
and by their kindly acts of thoughtful sympathy did evoke such
sentiment of English gratitude as should make more for a good
understanding between the two nations than the speech-making of a
century of Peace Societies.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 221</p>-->

<p>In the early sea story of the Pacific, the Barrier Reef, and
Bass Strait, and other dangerous points on the little-known
Australian coast, were hidden dangers, until ship after ship left
her ribs as a beacon for the whalers and sealers. Now, when the
coast should be, and is, well-known, with the greatest regularity
every year one or more of the fine coastal steamers come to
grief&mdash;the current is always stronger than was expected; or
something must have gone wrong with the compasses&mdash;the excuse
always amounts to the same thing, the land is too close, the ship
never too close to the land. But when the disaster does happen,
whatever lack of care or unforeseen cause has led to it, the spirit
of the British sailor in Australian waters is the same, and I could
name many instances of masters and officers bred on the Pacific who
have died at their posts as bravely as the older race of seamen at
home.</p>

<p>The loss of the Channel Island steamer <i>Stella</i>, in March
1899, is still fresh in the memory. Of about 180 persons on board
no were saved, though after the ship struck she did not remain
afloat a quarter of an hour. From the captain, who went down with
his ship, to the smallest boy of the crew, every one's first
thought was for the passengers. This inscription upon a recently
erected monument shows how one member of the crew
behaved:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"In memory of the heroic death of Mary Ann
Rogers, stewardess of the <i>Stella</i>, who, amid the confusion
and terror of shipwreck, aided all the passengers under her charge
to quit the vessel in safety, giving her own life-belt to one who
was unprotected. Summoned in her turn to make good her escape, she
refused, lest she might endanger the heavily-laden boat. Cheering
the departing crew with the friendly cry of 'Good-bye! Good-bye!'
she was seen a few moments later, as the <i>Stella</i> went down,
lifting her arms upward with the prayer, 'God have me!' then sank
in the water with the sinking ship. Actions such as
these&mdash;steadfast perfonnance of duty in face of death, ready
self-sacrifice for the sake of others, reliance on
God&mdash;constitute the glorious heritage of our English race.
They deserve perpetual commemoration; because among the trivial
pleasures and sordid strife of the world they recall to us for ever
the nobility and love-worthiness of human nature."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 222</p>-->

<p>When the <i>Wairarapa</i> ran full speed in a fog on the Great
Barrier Island, New Zealand, in October 1894, drowning 115 persons,
the stewardess, Miss M'Quaid, went quietly about her duty in the
saloon, serving out life-belts to the women passengers. At the same
moment as the ship was going down, she caught sight of a little
child without a belt. Taking her own off, she stooped over the
child, and was fastening the belt around its waist when a sea came
and swept them both away.</p>

<p>Occasionally we hear of cases when sailors do not seem to have
forgotten how to handle boats. On August 25th, 1896, the steamer
<i>Patrician</i>, when 400 miles east of Australia, encountered a
gale that left her a wreck, and Captain Stirling enclosed in a
bottle and threw overboard a farewell message to his friends. On
the 28th the masts were cut away, the boats all stove in, the gale
blew as hard as ever, and the ship, a dismal wreck, lay helpless in
a sea that all on board agreed no boat could live in&mdash;if boat
there had been to launch. Then the steamer <i>Fifeshire</i>,
Captain Wilson, bound from Sydney to New Zealand, hove in sight.
The captain of the <i>Patrician</i> hoisted a signal, asking if the
steamer would risk taking the crew off. The <i>Fifeshire</i>
answered, "We will do so if possible." Then the steamer was
skilfully manoeuvred, and an attempt was made to lower a boat, but
owing to the terrible sea and the rolling of the steamer, the boat
was crushed, the bridge, the bulwarks, and other fittings smashed,
and Mr Ross, the chief officer, injured. Mr Forder, the third
officer of the <i>Fifeshire</i>, offered to swim off to the sinking
ship with a line, but Captain Wilson, knowing that the attempt must
end in death, refused to allow him. After further manoeuvring,
another attempt to launch a boat was successful. Notwithstanding
his injuries, Mr Ross took charge, but he had to push off with only
two men&mdash;Mouatt, the boatswain, and Martin, a
quartermaster.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 223</p>-->

<p>These three men persevered in their heroic work, and after
tremendous exertion approached the <i>Patrician</i>. When nearing
her a tremendous sea caught the boat and took her right over the
taffrail of the <i>Patrician</i>, but the backwash fortunately
carried her back into the sea without having touched anything. By
means of a line the crew of the <i>Patrician</i> were got on board
the boat, and by the same means transferred to the
<i>Fifeshire</i>, this necessitating two journeys. The crew of the
boat had to be taken on board in the same manner, and as it would
have been hazardous to have attempted to take the boat on board, it
was abandoned.</p>

<p>Captain Stirling thus described his rescue:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Notwithstanding the injuries the chief
officer had received, and quite forgetful of himself, he again
bravely offered to risk his life in saving those of his fellowmen
by taking charge of the boat. The boatswain and the quartermaster,
were equally willing to sacrifice their lives, and they seemed to
be going to certain death by facing such a sea. One may imagine it,
when at times, the hull of the <i>Fifesshire</i>, as seen from the
wreck, would entirely disappear in the trough of the waves. It was
solely due to their wonderful courage and perseverance, and the
skilful manner in which Mr Ross and his crew handled the boat, that
they reached the wreck. Had it not been for Captain Wilson, who
handled his ship in such seaman-like manner, rendering valuable
assistance to the lifeboat, all efforts would have proved
fruitless, as the <i>Fifeshire</i> is a very large ship, and having
a heavy gale and high sea to contend with, it was extremely
difficult to keep her in position."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 224</p>-->

<p>Careless navigation of coastal and ferry steamers has led to
great loss of life during the century. The wreck of the <i>Rothsay
Castle</i>, running between Liverpool and Anglesea in 1831, by
which 130 lives were lost, was a shocking example of gross neglect
on the part of those responsible. The vessel was a sixteen years
old wooden paddle-boat. She put to sea in rough weather, was
carelessly navigated by a drunken skipper, and was ultimately
allowed to drift ashore on the Dutchman's Bank, where she fell to
pieces, and her panic-stricken passengers and cowardly crew were
drowned in shallow water, and in such circumstances that if the
steamer had possessed a boat that would have kept together, or her
crew had done their duty in the least degree honestly, every one
might have been saved.</p>

<p>The <i>Princess Alice</i>, an iron paddle excursion steamer,
running between London and Gravesend, was cut down in September
1878 by the steamer <i>Bywell Castle</i>. The excursion steamer was
abreast of Woolwich on her return trip at about eight o'clock in
the evening, and the <i>Bywell Castle</i>, an iron screw steam
collier, was outward bound. By some mistake the rule of the road
was not observed, and, too late, the steamers went astern. The
disaster was so sudden&mdash;the <i>Princess Alice</i> sinking the
moment after she was struck&mdash;that 670 out of 800 persons on
board were drowned, many of them crushed to death in their frantic
attempts to make their way up the narrow staircase from the saloon
to the deck. Whatever error of judgment brought about the disaster,
one man at anyrate&mdash;Branksome, the second mate of the
<i>Bywell Castle</i>&mdash;deserves praise for his courage and
coolness; by his exertions a score at least of people were
saved.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 225</p>-->

<p>One new form of accident which has sprung from the going out of
sails, is that of the helpless steamer with the broken propeller
shaft. As late as 1899, iri a modern ocean-going steamer the people
on board had an experience, if not so tragic, almost as dreary, as
that undergone by the Ancient Mariner. The steamer
<i>Perthshire</i> broke her propeller shaft when about midway
between New Zealand and New South Wales, and drifted helpless for
seven weeks. Fortunately there was plenty to eat on board, and the
weary waiting for help was the worst hardship suffered by those on
the ship, which was searched for by at least a dozen vessels, and
ultimately picked up just as the shaft was repaired well enough to
move the propeller and make steerage way. There have been two or
three similar instances within the last couple of years, and until
twin screws and duplicate engines become universal, it is difficult
to see how such accidents can be guarded against.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 226</p>-->

<p>The New Zealand Shipping Company's steamer, <i>Waikato</i>, left
London on May 4, 1899, bound for New Zealand ports. On June 5, when
she was about 180 miles south of Cape Agulhas, her tail-shaft
broke, and the subsequent proceedings on board are here told in the
words of the second officer:--</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Sail was set, but, thereafter, for many days
the vessel drifted hither and thither, and often crossed her old
tracks. On July 28 we sighted the barquentine <i>Tukora</i>. She
promised to give us a tow, but after having got the line aboard it
parted, and she stood off until the following day. Next day we got
another line aboard. It was then dead calm, with a moderate swell.
Unfortunately she started to bear down on us, forcing her captain
to cut the tow-line, and attempt to get her upon the port tack. The
sternway she had, however, forced her to crash into us. Very
luckily but little damage was done to either ship. No one was to
blame for the collision, which was inevitable. She then signalled
us she could render no more assistance, and after promising to
report us as soon as possible, stood away. On August 2 we sighted
the Danish ship <i>Aalbuy</i>, bound to Lyttelton, N.Z.; the
captain refused to tow us, but waited till we could send a boat
aboard with letters. He also furnished us with spare biscuits. As
our company's <i>Ruahine</i> might be in that locality about the
evening of the 16th, we determined to get on the track, if
possible, and keep a good lookout for her.<br>
<!--<p class="a">Page 227</p>-->
<br>
"Provisions now giving out, we overhauled the cargo for something
to replace them. Tinned herrings and sardines, Dutch cheeses, and a
quantity of seed peas were all we could get, and we felt the want
of flour very keenly. From the 9th to the 15th we drifted about 160
miles due east. We were 40 miles from the company's track on the
16th, but were unfortunately in a thick fog. We missed the
<i>Ruahine</i>. On the 22nd, with a fresh wind, we were running
along with all sails set, when, suddenly, a terrific gust came down
on us and carried everything before it save the foresail. The
fore-topsail and the staysail were the only sails repairable.
Luckily, we had a spare lower-topsail. Good and bad weather
followed alternately until September 1, when we sighted the barque
<i>Banca</i>, but she could not help us. The holds were frequently
rummaged for provisions, but little else could be found than fish,
peas, and cocoa, of which we had got heartily tired. On September 8
the barque <i>Alice</i> was sighted, and gave us a generous
contribution to our stores, consisting of two barrels of beef,
three of flour, and five spare sails. We had now come so far east
as to be as near to Australia as to the Cape, and we decided to
make for the former. On the 15th the steamer <i>Asloun</i> was
sighted, and, responding to distress signals, came alongside, and
promised to give us a tow to Fremantle, whither she was bound. On
the 18th, in a heavy sea, the towline parted, and was replaced with
great difficulty, the men in the boat having many narrow escapes
from being dashed to pieces against the vessel's side. When we
reached Amsterdam Island the <i>Asloun</i> required re-coaling, so
we coaled her with 110 tons by means of our boats, using the
lifeboats as lighters. It was a very difficult job, and all hands
worked right through the night, almost without food, and until noon
next day. No one aboard either ship had ever heard of such a thing
as this coaling having been done at sea before with ship's boats.
On the 28th a heavy gale was met with, and there was a big strain
on the tow-rope. At 8.30 A.M., when the gale was at its height, the
line suddenly snapped, then we fell off rapidly before the wind.
The decks were flooded with water.<br>
<!--<p class="a">Page 228</p>-->
<br>
"There was no sign of the <i>Asloun</i>, and great fears were
entertained for her safety. Next day the wind decreased; but the
<i>Asloun</i> was not sighted until the afternoon. Another tow-line
was taken aboard her, when it was ascertained she had a very narrow
escape, having started her funnel and sustained other damage. Heavy
weather was experienced between then and the 7th October, but the
Hne held till the latter date. Rottnest Island, off Fremantle, was
reached, and the pilot boarded the <i>Asloun</i>. The tow-rope then
touched bottom, and parted, and we had to anchor. The
<i>Penguin</i> towed us to the roads. We had travelled 4452 miles
after having broken down, and before being picked up. We were towed
2521 miles. Altogether the passage from port to port occupied 157
days, and we consider it a record one. All are well on board. The
<i>Waikato</i> was picked up by the <i>Asloun</i> in latitude 39°
30' S., longitude 64° 40'. Captain Barnet, of the <i>Asloun</i>,
states that it was the most trying voyage of its kind on record. He
would not go through the same experience for all the money in the
Bank of England."</p>

<p>But the people on such a steamer are better off than were
certain sailors I took some small part in succouring about twenty
years ago. We were in a sailing ship and were about half-way
between the Azores and the mouth of the Channel. A severe gale had
left us pretty well battered, but on the morning, when it had gone
down enough for us to make sail, we sighted a ship evidently worse
off, for she was flying signals of distress. We bore down and
hailed her to send a boat; all but one of ours had been smashed to
matchwood in the gale.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 229</p>-->

<p>The distressed ship was a big Nova Scotiaman, and as we passed
under her stern her captain answered our hail so feebly, that we
could only just make out words to the effect that the ship's
company had not strength enough in them to lower their boat. We
could see this for ourselves, for the men were almost crawling on
all fours to trim the makeshift sails that were rigged upon their
jury masts. In time we got a boat out and heard the story. The ship
had been "pooped"&mdash;that is, been overtaken when running before
the sea by a great wave&mdash;and this had smashed in her whole
stern. All the stores carried were in a lazarette under the cabin,
and every particle of food had been destroyed by the water washing
about in the storeroom. For nine days the timber cargo keeping the
ship afloat, all hands lived in the forecastle, sustaining life on
some substance that was shown to us to guess its nature. Our people
guessed all sorts of things, from pump-leather to dead rats; and
were wrong. This food was fished for in buckets from the storeroom,
and was the mud lying at the bottom of it, accumulated by the wash
of the sea upon the stores. The Nova Scotia skipper came off in our
boat, and was requested by the steward to take a seat at the cabin
table&mdash;breakfast would be on in a few moments; and our skipper
was shaving. I was in the storeroom getting up biscuits for the
starving crew, and my head was just level with the feet of the
cabin table, and I looked curiously at the tall half-starved "Blue
Nose" who had gone through such an experience. We had killed our
last pig the day before, and pork chops were for breakfast. The
steward put them on the table and went back to the galley for
coffee. The visitor sniffed the dish with satisfaction and longing;
the smell tempted him to raise the cover and peep at the delights
to come; the sight of the chops was too much, he snatched
one&mdash;it was swallowed in a moment&mdash;there were two others;
the Nova Scotiaman looked furtively at the closed door of the
captain's room, hesitated an instant, then put the cover back on an
empty dish.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 230</p>-->

<p>"Glad to be of service to you, captain," said our skipper,
coming out of his room.</p>

<p>"Guess I am mighty glad to hev fell in with yer," answered the
Nova Scotiaman.</p>

<p>"Well, you came at the right time, sir, I have two or three pork
chops for breakfast, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You hed, cap'an, you hed, but for a nine days hungry man to
smell 'um while you shaved was&mdash;well, you know&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Not so hungry was the half-starved old salt to whom I offered
food, and who said "if 'twas all the same to me he'd wait, but
would be glad of a chaw of terbaccer fust;" and still hungrier was
the young sailor who was handed an eight-pound tin of Danish butter
to hold a moment while some one brought him biscuits, and who,
before he could be stopped, had ladled, with his hand, down his
throat, half the contents of the tin, and was never the worse of
it. The ship was supplied with stores, sails, spars, and nautical
instruments, all of which, except her lower-masts, had gone in the
storm, and, curiously enough, her men so effectually rigged her up
again, that falling in with a lucky slant of wind which we missed,
she reached London before we did.</p>

<p>The chapter is already too long, and yet not half long enough to
be a complete wreck list of the century.</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X. EXPLORATION.</h2>

<h3>Arctic and Antarctic Expeditions&mdash;The North-West and the
North-East Passages&mdash;The Search for Franklin.</h3>

<p>"Cook's old ship, the <i>Discovery</i>, has been removed from
Woolwich, and is now moored off Deptford as a receiving hulk for
convicts." The extract is from a newspaper of 1834, and a year
later the wife of the great navigator died, having survived long
enough to see the continent her husband may be said to have
discovered a flourishing British colony. In the closing years of
the eighteenth and in the beginning of the nineteenth centuries,
most of our sea exploration was a continuation of the work of Cook,
Vancouver, and other famous discoverers.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 232</p>-->

<p>Nearly every ship bound to Australia, upon its departure from
the penal settlements, returned <i>via</i> the East, or went
whaling among the islands, continually making fresh South Sea
discoveries, or verifying the surveys of former ships. There is an
intimate connection between the discoverers and the discovered,
from Cook down to the middle of the century. Bligh served under
Cook, and long after Cook was dead Bligh was again in the Pacific,
adding something to our knowledge of that ocean. The Kings, father
and son, the Shortlands, father and son&mdash;two generations of
naval officers, in two families&mdash;charted many miles of the
Australian coast, and Sir John Franklin, who was afterwards
Governor of Tasmania, and became one of the most famous Arctic
explorers, served as a midshipman under Flinders, who, with Bass,
first discovered that Tasmania was an island. By land and sea,
naval officers, early in the century, were exploring; the names of
Clapperton and of Tuckey are important in the story of African
exploration, and are only two of many.</p>

<p>Guthrie's Geography of 1808 sums up "the islands of the South
Sea, and late discoveries" in a dozen pages; mentions Sandwich,
Tahiti, the Society Islands, the Navigators, the Friendly, the
Pelews, and New Guinea, as savage islands; gives a paragraph to New
Zealand, with a short description of the Maoris, and states a
belief that if the country were settled by Europeans they could
live in comfort there. Of New Holland it affirms that it is the
largest island in the world, that Van Diemen's Land has just been
discovered to be a separate island, and that the eastern part of
the big island has been taken possession of by England for a penal
settlement on the sea coast, "but beyond this fact nothing is known
of the country."</p>

<p>By the end of the first fifty years of the century our naval
officers had done such surveying work that, excepting certain small
islands, and detailed charts of the groups in remote parts of the
Pacific, there was little left to be charted. At this end of the
century it is practically correct to state that there are no
undiscovered islands left, no group without its chart, and the work
now going on is merely that of keeping up to date.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 233</p>-->

<p>Of important voyages of discovery, or for scientific purposes,
as understood by the term a century ago, there are few within the
last hundred years. Captain Murray Maxwell, in H.M.S.
<i>Alceste</i>, in company with a store-ship, and the <i>Lyra</i>,
brig-of-war. Captain Basil Hall, in 1816, left England to convey an
embassy to China. After landing the British Ambassador, Lord
Amherst, the two war-vessels sailed on a surveying cruise. On this
voyage the principal fruits were minute surveys of Corea and the
Foo-Chow Islands.</p>

<p>The voyage of the <i>Beagle</i>, 1826-36, on the survey of
Magellan Strait and the west coast of South America, was made
famous by Darwin's account of it. In voyages of scientific
investigation, such as deep-sea sounding, examining the bottom of
the ocean, and mapping it, the voyage of the <i>Challenger</i>,
1872-73, is the principal.</p>

<p>But in Arctic and Antarctic explorations the work of this
century far eclipses all that was done in the last. A comparison
between the maps of Sir John Barrow, 1818, and Delisle, 1715, shows
that between those dates practically no progress had been made in
Arctic exploration. When the century opened, the problem of the
North-West and North-East Passages, the outlining of the northern
coast of America, and the discovery of the islands on the north of
the northern continents, the search for the Pole and the magnetic
Pole, were what remained to be accomplished; and there could be no
thought of attempting it while we were at war. But interest in this
branch of science was renewed in 1817, when William Scoresby,
junior, transmitted to Sir Joseph Banks the results of his
discoveries in northern regions. Young Scoresby was the son of a
Scotch whaling skipper, and with his father made several voyages to
the Greenland seas. He afterwards attended Edinburgh University,
and later Cambridge, where he was ordained. The results of the work
of the Scoresbys, father and son, were the discovery of "about 2000
square leagues of the Greenland or (Spitzbergen) Sea between 74°
and 80°, perfectly void of ice." The report further stated that the
navigator had been enabled "to penetrate within sight of the
Eastern coast of Greenland to a meridian usually considered
inaccessible."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 234</p>-->

<p>This discovery of an open sea caused a sensation in the
scientific world, and gave Sir Joseph Banks, President of the Royal
Society, and Sir John Barrow, Secretary of the Admiralty, strong
argument in favour of an expedition; and the Government decided to
equip two. One of these under Captain John Ross, in the
<i>Isabella</i>, and Lieutenant W. E. Parry, in the
<i>Alexander</i>, was to search for a North-West Passage; the
other, the <i>Dorothea</i>, under Captain D. Buchan, and the
<i>Trent</i>, under Lieutenant John Franklin, was to attempt an
approach to the North Pole.</p>

<p>Ross! Parry! Franklin! How familiar are the names to us now.
Ross, then forty-one years of age, the son of a Scotch minister,
had served with distinction in the French wars, and was now to make
his first voyage in the ice regions. Parry, also forty-one years of
age, the son of a Bath physician, had served against the Danes in
1808, and two years later Avas protecting North Sea whalers; in
this duty, at twenty years of age, navigating for the first time in
ice regions, and now he was to sail on the first of five famous
Arctic voyages. Franklin, thirty-two years old, having fought at
Copenhagen and surveyed under Flinders, having been shipwrecked on
the Barrier Reef, and having fought in a notable sea fight on his
way home, and again at Trafalgar, and yet again at New Orleans, was
to begin his career as an Arctic explorer, and twenty-five years
later end it, leaving his name an imperishable remembrance in the
hearts of his countrymen.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 235</p>-->

<p>Ross, in company with many afterwards distinguished
scientists&mdash;J. C. Ross, his nephew, Sabine, and Hoppner, among
them&mdash;sailed on May 3, 1818, and overtaking the ice-bound
whaling fleet at Hare Island in 70° 43' N., 57° W., pushed
northwards, until he reached north of Melville Bay, where he met
the northernmost Greenlanders, Eskimo, or, as Ross aptly called
them, Arctic Highlanders. The voyage is remembered for Ross's
discovery of that mirage he named the "Croker Mountains," the site
of which was a year later sailed over by Parry.</p>

<p>Buchan, with whom were Franklin, Frederick Beechy, and George
Back, after battling with the pack north of Spitzbergen for some
weeks and getting the ships badly knocked about, abandoned the
attempt on the Pole and returned to England. Beechy, describing an
incident of the voyage when the vessels were forced by a furious
gale to take refuge among the ice, wrote: "If ever the fortitude of
seamen was fairly tried, it was aspuredly not less so on this
occasion, and I could not conceal the pride I felt in witnessing
the bold and decisive tone in which Franklin, the commander of our
little vessel, issued his orders, and the promptitude and
steadiness with which those orders were carried out by the
crew."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 236</p>-->

<p>Directly Ross returned, it was decided to despatch another
expedition, and the command of it was given to Parry, who was in
the <i>Hecla</i> of 375 tons, accompanied by the <i>Griper</i> of
180 tons, commanded by Lieutenant Liddon. Captain Sabine, the
leading magnetic observer of the day, was one of the officers of
this expedition.</p>

<p>The ships sailed in May 1819, and after examining Lancaster
Sound, and sailing over the site of Ross's "Croker Mountains," on
September 4, 1819, Parry crossed the meridian of 110° W., thus
securing the bounty offered by the British Government to "such of
His Majesty's subjects as might succeed in penetrating thus far to
the westward, within the Arctic circle."</p>

<p>Parry went into winter quarters at Melville Island, his crew
having in three days cut a channel in the ice to admit the ships
for a distance of two and a third miles. During the winter,
amusements were organised, theatrical performances, a weekly
newspaper, The <i>North Georgia Gazette and Winter Chronicle</i>,
edited by Sabine, being two features of the many devices by which
"the gloomy prospects which would sometimes obtrude on the stoutest
hearts" were diverted; and in this care for his crew. Parry set the
example which has happily been followed by his successors. The cold
was so intense that the thermometer sometimes registered 55°, and
it was often 76° below freezing point. On one of the coldest nights
the house on shore caught fire, and in the work of saving the
instruments sixteen men incurred frost bite, notwithstanding that
while the men were working at the fire the surgeons kept
continually going from man to man, and rubbing their faces with
snow.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 237</p>-->

<p>Before wintering. Parry had opened up Lancaster Sound,
discovering many fine waterways; Barrow Strait, Wellington Channel,
Melville Sound and Island, are his discoveries, and he reached,
before turning east again, 114° W. The ships were freed on August
8, 1820, and the expedition arrived in England in November, having
made such an unprecedented success that, in May 1821, Parry was
again sent out to continue the work.</p>

<p>The vessels, this time, were the <i>Fury</i>, under Parry, the
<i>Hecla</i>, under Lyon, and the officers included Ross, Buchan,
Hoppner, and Crozier. Parry's orders were to penetrate to the
westward through Hudson's Strait, reach the coast of the continent
of America, and following it northward, seek a passage to the
westward from the Atlantic to the Pacific. It had been held since
1742 that the North-West Passage was through Frozen Strait, but the
error of this route Parry settled by proving that it was completely
landlocked.</p>

<p>Early in September Parry's ship lost an anchor after being
nearly wrecked, and the vessel was driven to almost the same
position she had been in a month earlier. New ice and increasing
cold being experienced in October, Parry was compelled to take up
winter quarters at Winter Island. On July 12, 1822, he sailed north
again, and after discovering Hecla and Fury Strait, wintered again
in Arctic regions. Parry intended to send the <i>Hecla</i> home,
and in the <i>Fury</i>, with a picked crew, once more go north, but
owing to the continued exposure telling on the health of his men,
he was obliged to abandon the idea, and the two ships were headed
for home, and arrived on October 10, 1823.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 238</p>-->

<p>The third voyage, in 1824-25, proved unsuccessful; one of
Parry's vessels&mdash;the <i>Fury</i>&mdash;was lost, and with this
disaster the expedition came to an end. Parry did not again attempt
the North-West Passage, although in 1827 he tried to reach the
North Pole. He sailed in the <i>Hecla</i> in April, and leaving his
vessel at Turenberg Bay, started in boats fitted on runners, with
which the party made a thirty-five days' journey over the ice,
encountering enormous difficulties from drift ice. They reached 82°
45' N. on July 23, the farthest north till Markham's record
forty-five years later. Then the party turned and gained the ship
after being absent from her sixty-one days. This was the last
expedition Parry made; he afterwards went to Australia, and there
very successfully managed a great agricultural company, returning
to England in 1835, where he received at different times several
civil appointments. He died in 1855.</p>

<p>In 1827, Sir John Ross suggested another attempt to discover the
North-West Passage, this time in a steamer, but the Admiralty would
offer no encouragement, soon afterwards withdrawing the offer of
£20,000, which had been for some years held out as an encouragement
for the discovery of the Passage. Then Felix Booth, Sheriff of
London, came forward, and chiefly at his private expense fitted out
the <i>Victory</i>, a paddle steamer of 150 tons&mdash;the first
steam vessel to enter ice regions, and probably the least suitable
design of ship for cruising among ice. She left England in May
1829, and returned in October 1833&mdash;this expedition of four
and a half years having cost the London distiller who had made it
possible £17,000, and earned him a baronetcy.</p>

<p>The <i>Victory</i> during her voyage entered Lancaster Sound and
passed to Prince Regent Inlet. Three winters were spent on the most
northern peninsula of America, appropriately named by the explorers
Boothia Felix; and during the intervening time young James Ross,
nephew of Sir John, determined the position of the North Magnetic
Pole, where the Union Jack was hoisted on June 1, 1831. In May 1833
Sir John Ross was compelled to abandon his vessel, and after a
journey of great hardship, the expedition, by means of open boats,
reached Baffin Bay, where, in August, they were picked up by a
whaler and brought to England.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 239</p>-->

<p>While Parry was exploring by sea, Franklin had been despatched
to examine, in sledges and canoes, the north coast of America
eastward from the Copper Mine River. Franklin's companions were
Back, Hood, Dr Richardson, and a seaman named Hepburn. They left
England in May 1819, and started from York Factory, Hudson's Bay,
in August. After a most extraordinary journey of hardship&mdash;in
which starvation, wolves, and Eskimos were encountered with
indomitable courage&mdash;Franklin succeeded in exploring 550 miles
of coast line to the eastward, reaching Point Turnagain (68° 18'
N., 109° 25' W.)on August 16, 1821.</p>

<p>At this time the situation was so serious that after a three
days' fast the last food was cooked, one of the canoes furnishing
wood for the fire; the remaining canoe became so damaged that it
was abandoned, the men refusing to assist Franklin in carrying it
further. The expedition had now reached within forty miles of Fort
Enterprise, and Back and two men pushed on ahead for aid. Meanwhile
two noble examples of bravery and self-denial were given: Dr
Richardson volunteered to swim across a stream, carrying a line by
which a raft could be hauled over. The doctor was a mere skeleton,
and at the moment of making the attempt he had stepped on some
sharp instrument, cutting his foot to the bone, and it was only
with the greatest difficulty his life was saved; the other instance
was that of Perrault, a Canadian, who, as his comrades were one
night seated round a fire starving, produced a piece of meat that
he had saved from his former allowance and divided it between
all.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 240</p>-->

<p>Two Indians died of sheer starvation&mdash;they had been living
for days upon lichens and scraps of leather. Some of the carriers
were caught stealing from the scanty stores; and Indian hunters,
sent out to forage, concealed from the party what they discovered,
and when caught, fired upon the explorers, killing Lieutenant Hood,
and it is suspected they had previously murdered and eaten three
fellow-countrymen. With great difficulty, owing to his weakness, Dr
Richardson contrived to hold a court-martial with his companion,
and then shot the culprits to save Hepburn and himself A partridge,
shot at this time, was divided between Franklin and three
companions, the first flesh they had tasted for thirty-one days. At
last Back arrived with relief, and the expedition, in due course,
reached home. In spite of the terrible hardships encountered, the
only deaths were those of two Canadians from starvation, and of
Hood, and the Indian hunters who were killed.</p>

<p>Immediately upon their return, Franklin, Richardson (afterwards
Sir John), and Back volunteered for another expedition. This time
they successfully reached the mouth of the Mackenzie River, and
from there made many interesting discoveries, performing the work
without sensational incidents, and, owing to excellent
arrangements, in comparative comfort. Then in 1832, the non-return
of Sir John Ross's expedition causing great anxiety in England,
Back, partly financed by Government and partly by Ross's friends,
set out to succour him. The Hudson's Bay Company contributed
generous support, and by its liberality. Back, who, soon after he
started, was informed of Ross's safe return, was able to devote
considerable time to exploring. In July 1834, Back discovered and
explored the Great Fish River, following it to the Arctic Ocean;
his most northern camp was made at the eastern entrance of Simpson
Strait in 68° 14' N., 94° 58' W. After naming King William's Land,
Back turned south, wintering at Reliance, and then returning to
England.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 241</p>-->

<p>The Hudson's Bay Company, in 1837, endeavoured to fill what gaps
remained in the explorations of Franklin and Back, and they chose
for the work Messrs Thomas Simpson and P. W. Dease, who in a boat
succeeded in connecting Return Reef with Cape Barrow, a space of
about 150 miles. Later, the same explorers reached the mouth of
Back's River from Cape Turn-again, and pushed to the east to Castor
and Pollux Bay. In 1846-47 an expedition planned by Sir George
Simpson, and commanded by Dr John Rae, succeeded in travelling
round the Gulf of Akkoolee, and connecting Hudson's Bay with the
discoveries of Ross, and with those of Parry during his second
voyage; and in 1854, during the search for Franklin, Dr Rae united
the work of Ross with that of Simpson, thus completing the
exploration of the whole of the northern coast of America.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 242</p>-->

<p>During 1823-24 the <i>Griper</i> penetrated to the east coast of
Greenland in 76° N., and about this time a Russian expedition,
under Lieutenant (afterwards Admiral Lutke) surveyed the west coast
of Nova Zembla; and Urangell, the great Russian explorer, made four
famous journeys over the ice from North Siberia; in 1832-35
Pachtussow surveyed the east coast as far as 74° 24' N.; several
other foreign expeditions added considerably to the world's
knowledge of Nova Zembla; in 1869 Palliser, an English sportsman,
sailed half a degree north of Cape Nassau; in 1870 another
expedition reached 76° 47' N., and 59° 17' E., 50 miles north-east
of Cape Nassau; in 1871 Quale sailed east as far as 75° 22' N., 74°
35' E. Johannsen, a Norwegian hunter, discovered and
circumnavigated Lonely Island (77° 31' N., 86° E.) in the sixties;
and in 1871, Captain Elling Carlsen circumnavigated Nova Zembla,
his ship, the Solid being the first vessel to enter Ice Haven since
Barent's voyage, 275 years before. Many other scientists and
explorers have spent much time in exploring Nova Zembla, and the
result is that we have now a considerable knowledge of it.</p>

<p>In 1836, the Royal Geographical Society petitioned the British
Government to survey the coast between Regent Inlet and Point
Turnagain, with the result that the <i>Terror</i> was placed under
the command of Back, who had, meanwhile, been knighted, and for his
exploring services raised to the rank of captain by an order in
council.</p>

<p>The <i>Terror</i> sailed on June 14, 1836, and her voyage,
geographically considered, was a failure, but because of the
startling experiences of the explorers, was remarkable. Six weeks
after leaving England, in Davis' Strait an iceberg not less than
300 ft. high was sighted, and this was the forerunner of
innumerable ice-floes in which the ship soon became hopelessly
wedged. For nine months they were thus imprisoned, and for four of
these months they were in an ice-cradle high out of water, and in
continual expectation of the ship falling through and being
shattered to pieces. But the <i>Terror</i> was destined for another
fate, and Back and his comrades were ultimately released and
returned home, none the worse for their experience.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 243</p>-->

<p>Antarctic exploration began when Captain Cook first crossed the
Antarctic Circle in 1773, crossing it again in 1774, and a third
time in 1775; his longitudes being respectively 40° E., between
100° and 110° W., and between 135° and 148° W., and his highest
latitude reached 71° S.</p>

<p>Bellinghausen, a Russian, was the next voyager to enter the
Antarctic circle, discovering Alexander Island (68° S., 72° W.) and
Petra Island (68° S.,91° W.). This was in 1821, and the explorer
sailed through several degrees of longitude, keeping just on the
edge of the circle.</p>

<p>Few people have any idea of what Southern Ocean sailing in these
high latitudes means. In 60° S. I have seen at one time, and
counted for myself, eighty-five icebergs; thirty-five of these
bergs were upwards of 300 ft. in height. It was hours before we
were clear of the ice, and a long while before we could see a way
out. The hopeless condition of a ship pinched in these regions, the
absolute certainty that in such cases her crew have no escape,
makes one reflect with wonder and admiration on the skill and
courage of the men who pushed the frail little vessels of sixty or
seventy years ago into the seventies of the Southern
Hemisphere.</p>

<p>In 1823 Weddel, an ex-master of the Royal Navy, the peace having
left him without employment in the King's service, took a small
sealing brig, the <i>Jane</i>, and a cutter, the <i>Beaufoy</i>, as
far south as 74°; though his professed object was sealing, not
exploring, his account of the trip added not a little to our
knowledge. Again, in 1830-32, Biscoe, another sealing captsin in
charge of one of Enderby's vessels, discovered Enderby and Graham's
Islands on the Antarctic Circle; and in 1839 Balleny, another of
Enderby's sealers, discovered Balleny's Island (66° 44' S.), and
Sabrina Island, (65° 10' S.). Dumont d'Urville, in 1840, went as
far south as 66° 30' and discovered Adelie Land; and the United
States Exploring Expedition, under Commodore Wilkes, went over the
ground and amplified the discoveries of the French explorer.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 244</p>-->

<p>Then came <i>the</i> Antarctic Expedition, that of the
<i>Erebus</i> and the <i>Terror</i>, under the command of Sir James
Ross. Ross, it will be remembered, had accompanied Parry in all his
Arctic voyages, and under his uncle, Sir John Ross, fixed the
position of the North Magnetic Pole. The expedition left England in
1839, and after calling at Hobart, Tasmania, left that port on
November 20, 1840, entering the Antarctic Circle on New Year's Day,
1841, in 170° E.</p>

<p>The main object of the expedition was the discovery of the South
Magnetic Pole, and soon after the Circle was crossed the course was
shaped accordingly. Then Ross met with a barrier&mdash;high land
rising in lofty peaks. The highest point, 10,000 ft, was named
Mount Sabine after the distinguished scientist. Fine weather
enabled Ross to coast along the land until, in latitude 72° S.,
longitude 171° E., a landing was made on an island which he named
Possession Island, where the British flag was hoisted and the usual
ceremony of taking possession was performed. The weather now grew
stormy, but notwithstanding this, the explorers pushed on until
they reached 75° S., 170° E., on January 25th. Ross wrote that in
this latitude "two of the mountains of this magnificent range,
named Melbourne and Monteagle, were here seen to great advantage;
the immense crater of the former, and the more pointed summit of
the latter, rose high above the contiguous mountains, forming two
of the many remarkable objects of this most wonderful and
magnificent mass of volcanic land."*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Sir James Ross's <i>Voyage to the Southern
Seas</i>. (John Murray, London, 1847.)]</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 245</p>-->

<p>Three days later, Franklin Island (76° S., 168° E.) was
discovered and named, and Mount Erebus, an active volcano, was
discovered, its estimated height more than 12,000 ft., while near
it was an extinct volcano nearly as high, named by the explorers
Mount Terror. The explorers traced land to 79° S. This southernmost
point they named after Parry, and the whole continent was
appropriately named Victoria Land. Then they discovered the great
southern ice barrier&mdash;a wall of ice from 150 to 200 ft. high,
extending from 78° S. in an easterly direction about 450 miles from
Mount Erebus, and estimated from the soundings to be 1000 ft. in
thickness; the temperature at this season, the depth of summer, was
18° below freezing point.</p>

<p>It was impossible to do more; no suitable winter quarters could
be found, and so the ships' heads were turned north, Balleny's and
Biscoe's discoveries were confirmed, and the ships, after a severe
handling in the ice, returned to Hobart, where they arrived on
April 6.</p>

<p>What narrow escapes they had may be gathered from the fact that
in a gale encountered in the pack both vessels lost their rudders,
and the ships took fifty-six days, heading north, to cover the same
distance they had made in four days heading south. At one time the
<i>Erebus</i> was an hour alongside a berg, and was compelled to
set her mainsail aback in a heavy gale to make a stern board and
free herself After wintering at the Falkland Islands the ships
sailed again on September 4, 1842, and made observations as far
south as 71° and to longitude west 14° 29'. Then the ships returned
to England, being paid off at Woolwich on September 23, 1843.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 246</p>-->

<p>Meanwhile the Royal Geographical Society was renewing its
agitation for the search for the North-West Passage, and the
completion of the exploration of the north coast of America. Sir
John Franklin at this time was fifty-nine years of age, and had
just returned from Tasmania after governing the island for seven
years. The return of the <i>Erebus</i> and the <i>Terror</i>, and
of Franklin, suggested the ships and the man to command them. And
in May, 1845, Franklin sailed with a party of 134 persons, of whom
9 left the expedition before it entered the ice; he commanded the
<i>Erebus</i>, and Captain F. R. M. Crozier took charge of the
<i>Terror</i>, both ships having, in the interval, been thoroughly
overhauled and fitted with auxiliary screws. The last despatches
from the expedition were dated Whale Fish Island, July 12, 1845. A
whaler, on July 26, saw the ships moored to an iceberg, waiting for
a favourable opportunity to enter Baffin's Bay. This was the last
seen of them. Nothing of their fate was known until 1854. No
certain traces of the explorers reached England until M'Clintock
wrested from the awful silence of the polar regions the story of
their ending.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 247</p>-->

<p>The history of Arctic exploration from 1848 to 1859 is
practically a record of the search for Franklin. Between these
years, numerous expeditions, equipped at public and private
expense, by sea and by land, joined in the search, and not one of
them returned without adding considerably to our knowledge of the
Arctic regions. Provisions and clothing were deposited in various
places in the Arctic seas by the British and by the United States
Governments. The Hudson's Bay Company lent its valuable aid, and
Lady Franklin and her friends, from their private means, and of
their own energy, persevered when the British Government abandoned
the search as hopeless. Here is a short summary of what was
done:&mdash;</p>

<p>The first expedition sent out by the Admiralty was H.M.S.
<i>Plover</i>, first under Captain Moore, and later under Captain
Maguire. She sailed from Sheerness for Behring Straits on ist
January 1848. Three months later, on 25th March a land expedition
under Sir John Richardson and Dr Rae, of the Hudson's Bay Company,
left England. Richardson returned in 1849, but Dr Rae continued the
search till 1851. In June 1848, Sir James Ross, with the
<i>Enterprise</i> and <i>Investigator</i>, sailed from England,
discovered the western side of North Somerset, and returned in
November 1849. Sir Leopold M'CHntock served his Arctic
apprenticeship in that expedition. Two or three months after the
return of Ross, the two ships sailed again under Collinson and
M'Clure to search for Franklin, and M'Clure discovered the
long-sought-for North-West Passage, making an honoured place for
himself in the roll of Arctic explorers. Collinson, meanwhile, made
a remarkable voyage along the north coast of America. Captain
Austin's expedition, consisting of the <i>Resolute</i>, the
<i>Assistance</i>, Captain Ommanney, the <i>Intrepid</i>,
Lieutenant Bertie Cator, and the <i>Pioneer</i>, Lieutenant Sherard
Osborn, sailed in April 1850, and wintered almost in the centre of
the region discovered by Parry on his first voyage. M'Clintock was
with this expedition, and developed and put into practice the
system of sledge travelling, which has since achieved such success.
Some remarkable journeys in various directions were made by
Ommanney, M'Clintock, Sherard Osborn, Frederick Mecham, Robert
Aldrich, and Vesey Hamilton.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 248</p>-->

<p>In April, 1850, the <i>Lady Franklin</i>, Captain Penny, sailed
from Aberdeen for Barrow's Strait, and a month later the first
American expedition in the <i>Advance</i> and the <i>Rescue</i>,
under Lieutenant De Haven and Dr Kane, sailed for Lancaster Sound.
<i>The Lady Franklin</i> expedition returned to England in
September 1851, having discovered some small traces of the lost
ship; and the American vessels, after drifting with the pack down
Baffin's Bay, returned during the same year. The <i>Felix</i>,
fitted out chiefly by the Hudson's Bay Company, sailed in May 1850,
and returned in the following year. Captain Kellet, C.B., sailed in
H.M.S. <i>Herald</i>, in 1848, and after making three voyages to
Behring Strait, returned in 1851. When Austin's expedition returned
in September 1851, the <i>Assistance, Resolute, Intrepid</i>, and
<i>Pioneer</i>, together with H.M.S. <i>North Star</i>, were fitted
out under Sir Edward Belcher, C.B. The expedition arrived at Beechy
Island in August 1852, and the <i>Assistance</i> (Belcher) and
<i>Pioneer</i> (Sherard Osborn) proceeded through Wellington Sound,
while the <i>Resolute</i> (Kellet) and <i>Intrepid</i> (M'Clintock)
went to Melville Island, the <i>North Star</i> (Pullen) remaining
at Beechy Island.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 249</p>-->

<p>In April 1854, Sir Edward Belcher, after mature deliberation,
finding that there was no chance of release from the ice, abandoned
his ships, for which step, on their return to England, the captains
were tried by court-martial and honourably acquitted. The
<i>Resolute</i> was subsequently picked up by an American whaler a
thousand miles from the spot where she was abandoned. She was taken
to New York, and the United States Congress gave orders for her
purchase. The American Government then thoroughly repaired and
equipped the ship, and sent her across the Atlantic as a present to
the Queen. When the <i>Resolute</i> was broken up in 1880, a desk
was made of a portion of her hull, and the Queen presented it to
the United States President.</p>

<p>Lady Franklin, aided by a few friends, equipped her first
expedition in 1850, the <i>Prince Albert</i>, under Forsyth. She
sailed in June, and returned the same year. The same vessel left
again, in June 1851, for Prince Regent's inlet. This was the voyage
on which Lieutenant Bellot of the French Navy volunteered and lost
his life. The third of Lady Franklin's expeditions sailed, under
Inglefield, in the <i>Isabel</i>, in July 1852, and returned in
November of the same year. H.M.S. <i>Rattlesnake</i>, under
Trollope, was despatched to assist the <i>Plover</i> at Point
Barrow, returning with her to England in August 1853, and the
<i>Isabel</i> made another voyage to Behring Straits in the same
year. Even this list does not make mention of every attempt; yet so
far no trace of the missing had been found.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 250</p>-->

<p>Then, in 1853, the second American expedition in the
<i>Advance</i> sailed, and Dr Rae shed the first ray of light upon
the mystery of Franklin's disappearance. He reported to the British
Admiralty that he had purchased from a party of Eskimos a number of
articles which had belonged to Sir John Franklin and to members of
his expedition. The relics included Sir John's star, part of a
watch, some silver plate and other articles. Dr Rae also reported
that Eskimos stated they had met with a party of white men about
four winters previously, and had sold them a seal; and that four
months later, in the same season, they had found the dead bodies of
about thirty men. Dr Rae made out the spot where this meeting was
said to have taken place, to have been in the near neighbourhood of
the Fish River. For their discovery, Dr Rae and his companions were
awarded the £10,000 offered by Government for the first
intelligence of the fate of the lost explorers.</p>

<p>The news gave a fresh zest to private enterprise, though the
Government now ceased its efforts. In May 1854, the <i>Phoenix</i>,
<i>North Star</i>, and the <i>Talbot</i> searched until October. A
third American expedition sailed to look for Dr Kane, who, after a
journey of 1300 miles over ice to a Danish settlement, was on his
way home in a Danish vessel, when Hartstene, in charge of the
American ships, fell in with him. The Hudson's Bay Company, in June
1855, sent out an overland canoe party, which returned in the
following September, bringing a few more Franklin relics. Then, in
1857, came the last of Lady Franklin's expeditions in the Fox,
under M'Clintock.</p>

<p>M'Clintock's little party altogether numbered only twenty-five
persons, of whom the names of Captain (now Sir Allen) Young, and
Hobson, the first lieutenant, were made famous by the good service
they performed under their able commander.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 251</p>-->

<p>The traces discovered by M'Clintock, aided by Dr Rae's report,*
enabled the English officer in his account of the <i>Fox</i>
expedition to explain, with almost certain exactness, what befell
Franklin's party from the time they were last seen by the whaler in
July 1845.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Fate of Franklin and his
Discoveries</i>&mdash;M'Clintock. John Murray, London, 1859.]</p>

<p>The <i>Erebus</i> and <i>Terror</i> passed on to Lancaster Sound
and entered Wellington Channel, the southern entrance of which had
been discovered by Parry in 1819. The ships sailed up that strait
150 miles, and having reached 77° N., turned southward again,
either blocked by ice, or because Franklin considered it a mistake
to follow a route which seemed to lead away from the known sea of
America. Re-entering Barrow's Strait, the ships passed by a new
channel between Bathurst and Cornwallis Islands, and then lay up
for the winter of 1845-6 at Beechy Island. In 1846 they were again
afloat, heading south-west, and reached to within twelve miles of
the northern extremity of King William's Land, where they wintered
for 1846-7. Then Lieutenant Gore was despatched with a
land-exploring party, probably to connect the unknown coast line of
King William's Land between Point Victory and Cape Herschel. At
Point Victory, Lieutenant Hobson, of M'Clintock's search
expedition, on 6th May 1859, found an ordinary Admiralty current
paper on which Gore had written that all was well, and that a small
party had left the ships on a land expedition. This paper was dated
28th May 1847. But around the margin of this document, in the
handwriting of Fitzjames, the last ten words added by Crozier, the
following had been written:&mdash;</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 252</p>-->

<p class="newspaper">"April 25, 1848.&mdash;H.M. Ships
<i>Terror</i> and <i>Erebus</i> were deserted on April 22nd, 5
leagues N.N.W. of this, having been beset since September 12, 1846.
The officers and crews, consisting of 105 souls, under the command
of Captain F. R. M. Crozier, landed in latitude 69° 37' 42" N.,
longitude 98° 41' W. This paper was found by Lieut. Irving under
the cairn supposed to have been built by Sir James Ross in 1831, 4
miles to the northward, where it had been deposited by the late
Commander Gore in June 1847. Sir James Ross's pillar has not,
however, been found; and the paper has been transferred to this
position, which is that in which Sir James Ross's pillar was
erected. Sir John Franklin died on June II, 1847, and the total
loss by death in the expedition has been to this date, 9 officers
and 15 men.<br>
<br>
(Signed) F. R. M. Crozier, Captain and Senior Officer. James
Fitzjames, Captain H.M.S. <i>Erebus</i>.<br>
<br>
<br>
And start on to-morrow, 26th, for Back's Fish River."</p>

<p>The <i>Erebus</i> and <i>Terror</i> were only provisioned up to
July 1848, and these simple words, a message from the grave, in
that sentence, "Start to-morrow for Back's Fish River," told more
than could a volume that the explorers, rather than perish without
an effort, were about to make a last bold and painfully hopeless
struggle to reach civilisation.</p>

<p>M'Clintock, following his lieutenant Hobson's tracks at the
western extremity of King William's Land, came to a deserted boat,
containing two incomplete human skeletons, many articles of
clothing, some books, nautical instruments, silver plate, and other
relics, which, with those found by Dr Rae, are now treasured in the
Museum of Greenwich Hospital and that of the United States Service
Institution. No traces of the ships were seen, only these personal
belongings&mdash;sad evidence that, as was told by an Eskimo old
woman, "they fell down and died as they walked along."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 253</p>-->

<p>Twenty years later, in 1879, Lieutenant Schwatka, in an overland
expedition, discovered more remains of Franklin's party, and the
bones of Lieutenant John Irving, of the <i>Terror</i>, were brought
away and buried at Edinburgh in January 1881. This was the last of
the search for Franklin&mdash;a quest that had lasted for nearly
forty years, and in the course of it had trained more than one
generation of Arctic explorers.</p>

<p>The object of Franklin's expedition was the discovery of the
North-West Passage, and Franklin, on the evidence, did undoubtedly
complete the discovery by filling the gap between Parry's Melville
Island and Back's Fish River; but before this evidence of
Franklin's success was brought to light, M'Clure, on October 26,
1850, when with his sledge party he saw from Bank's Land away to
the north, "the frozen waters of Melville Straits, with no land
between us and Melville Island," had discovered a North-West
Passage.</p>

<p>For fifteen years after the return of M'Clintock, England
neglected polar exploration, but in that time several foreign
expeditions were sent out. In 1853-55 the American brig
<i>Advance</i> wintered within the entrance of Smith Sound, and an
exploring party from her went for some distance up the east side of
the channel. In 1860 Dr Hayes wintered near the same spot, and made
a sledge journey up the west side. Ten years later, in 1871,
Captain Hall, in the <i>Polaris</i>, succeeded in passing up the
channels leading north from Smith Sound. Hall died in the autumn,
but the expedition attained 82° 11' N., and wintered in 81° 38' N.,
up to that date the highest latitude reached.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 254</p>-->

<p>Then the British Government woke up again and equipped the
<i>Alert</i> and <i>Discovery</i>. The command was given to Captain
(afterwards Sir George) Nares, and the expedition sailed in 1875.
The ships reached Cape Sabine without difficulty, passed Cape
Leiber on August 25, crossed Lady Franklin Bay, and discovered
Discovery Harbour, a fine land-locked inlet. Here Nares placed the
<i>Discovery</i> in winter quarters, and in the <i>Alert</i> pushed
northward, reaching Floeberg Beach in 82° 25' N. and 62° W. Thus
Nares beat Hall's record, the <i>Alert</i> having reached farther
north than the <i>Polaris</i>. The <i>Alerts</i> company wintered
on the shores of the Polar Sea, and sledging parties were engaged
preparing depots for the Spring, eight men being frost-bitten in
carrying on the work. Lieutenant Pelham Aldrich exceeded Parry's
latitude of 1827, the modern explorer reaching 82° 48'. In the
early spring Nares opened communication with the <i>Discovery</i>,
and then attempted to accomplish the object of the expedition.</p>

<p>He divided his plan into two distinct undertakings, the first
that of a direct sledge journey towards the Pole, and the other the
exploration of the north shore of Grinnel Land. The first
undertaking was intrusted to Commander (now Rear-Admiral) Markham,
who, with two sledges and seventeen men, took to the Frozen Sea on
April 10, 1876. The party reached 83° 20' N., and 64° W. on May 12,
1876, and later, due to the energy of the leader, several of whose
men had been disabled by disease, 83° 20' 26" N. was gained, and
the Union Jack hoisted on the spot, the most northerly point
attained to that date, and until Lockwood of the American Greely
expedition in 1881-84 reached 83° 24'. The serious troubles of the
party began before they turned back, and nothing but the
extraordinary march of twenty-four hours' duration, made by
Lieutenant A. C. Parr to the <i>Alert</i> for help, saved the whole
party from death.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 255</p>-->

<p>From the <i>Discovery</i> good work was meanwhile carried on in
the exploration of Grinnel Land. Aldrich and his party traced 220
miles of new coast; and the shores of Grinnel Land were extended
from Archer Fiord to Cape Columbia, and the Coast of Greenland was
extended to Cape Britannia.</p>

<p>During recent years there have been several expeditions of more
or less importance, fitted out by private enterprise and under
foreign flags, the object being to reach the North Pole; that of
Nansen and the unfortunate André are too recent to need
description. Nansen proved how thoroughly correct was his drift
theory, for the Fram reached 84° 4' N. and 102° E., and Nansen and
his companion Johansen succeeded, after surmounting incredible
difficulties, in making a sledge journey to 86° 14' N, longitude,
95° E., the highest latitude ever reached. This was on April 6,
1895.</p>

<p>While several expeditions were with varying success exploring
other parts of the Arctic regions, the question of a North-East
Passage remained dormant, the general opinion being that the
existence of such a passage was impossible. Adolf Erik
Nordenskiöld, a Finn, who had taken part in Swedish Arctic
expeditions of 1858-61-64-68 and 72, and in a voyage to Greenland
in 1870, was confident that he could find a channel; and in 1875,
in the <i>Proven</i>, a vessel of 70 tons, he sailed on an
expedition which was thoroughly successful. The <i>Proven</i>
visited Nova Zembla, passed through Jugor Strait, and anchored in
the mouth of the Yenese.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 256</p>-->

<p>Here Nordenskiöld left the ship, and with a party ascended the
Yenese, and came back overland, the <i>Proven</i>, meanwhile,
having returned to Tromso. In the following year Nordenskiöld led
another expedition to the mouth of the Yenese, and repeated
successful voyages have since been made. The Swedish Government
then fitted out an expedition, in response to a petition from
Nordenskiöld, with the object of penetrating from the Yenese to
Behring Strait, and the attempt was begun in July 1878. After much
trouble the vessel reached Kolyuchin Bay, but it was impossible
owing to the ice pack to proceed further. The expedition wintered
off Pitlekai in 67° 7' N., 123° E., and on July 30, 1879, the ice
having broken up two days previously, the <i>Vega</i> rounded the
East Cape and thus made the North-East Passage.</p>

<p>The exploration of Spitzbergen has been by no means the least
important or uninteresting object of many expeditions. Although the
Archipelago is uninhabited, parties have spent long periods on its
shores examining its extensive flora, or killing in thousands the
reindeer with which it abounded. Russians and Norwegians hunted its
shores two centuries ago. Scoresby, the English explorer, made
seventeen voyages to Spitzbergen, and in his Polar <i>Regions</i>,
published in 1823, wrote the best account of it that had been
published since Marten's in 1671. Buchan and Franklin in 1818 made
pendulum and other observations on Dane Island; Clavering and
Sabine followed some years later; and Parry in 1827, at Turenberg
Bay, continued the work. In 1838, a French expedition, <i>La
Rechère</i>, Captain Fabvre, occupied Bell Sound, and, the
following year, Magdalen Bay; but to Sweden, more than to any other
country, is due our early knowledge of the Archipelago, and
Nordenskiöld, in many voyages, thoroughly examined a large area of
ground. Germany, in 1868-71, made several successful explorations;
and an Austrian expedition, in 1872, eclipsed all other. Frantz
Josef Land commemorates the voyage which was made by Weyprecht and
Payer in the Austrian steamer <i>Tegethoff</i>. The explorers made
a sledge journey to Cape Fligely in 82° 5' N., were eventually
compelled to abandon their ship, and reached Norway in September
1874. In modern times, English yachtsmen have done a great deal of
exploring in the Archipelago, and they have been the only
representatives of the flag engaged in this work.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 257</p>-->

<p>In recent years we have in the North, the Jackson-Harmsworth
expedition, and that of Peary in the <i>Windward</i>; what they
have done is still part of the news of the day; and in the South we
have the Antarctic expedition under Borchgrevink organised by Sir
George Newnes, the results of whose work cannot be known until the
year 1900 is well advanced.</p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI. PIRATES AND
MUTINEERS.</h2>

<h3>The Last of the Pirates&mdash;Mutinies in the
Navy&mdash;Foreigners in the Merchant Service&mdash;Remarkable Gold
Robbery&mdash;Broaching Cargo.</h3>

<p>By the beginning of the eighteenth century, the Buccaneers of
the Spanish Main had degenerated into out-and-out pirates. The
regular walk-the-plank, skull-and-cross-bones fellows, such as
Avery, Teach, Roberts, and similar rascals, all earned their
notoriety at this period, and by the beginning of the nineteenth
century the true pirate, like the true highwayman, was becoming
scarce, and the word "piracy" began to carry a different meaning.
Blackguard merchant-seamen in ill-disciplined ships occasionally
mutinied and seized the vessel on which they were serving, but in
time of peace there were too many war-vessels available for such
ruffians to remain long unpunished, and before they could do much
mischief they were captured, and Execution Dock saw the last of
them. The nearest approach in this century to the pirate proper was
in the person of Benito de Soto, a Portuguese, who began his career
in a slaver belonging to Buenos Ayres in 1827. The vessel left
Buenos Ayres for the coast of Africa with a crew made up chiefly of
Spanish, French, and Portuguese rascals, and the mate of the ship
was a notorious ruffian. De Soto was before the mast, and the mate
for some reason took a fancy to him as being a Hkely fellow to help
him in a design to seize the ship, which was put in execution at an
hour when the captain was on shore arranging with the slave-agent
for the charges on the freight of slaves.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 259</p>-->

<p>Twenty-two of the crew joined the mutineers and eighteen
refused; De Soto then served out arms to his companions, declared
the mate was now in command, and compelled the loyal men to enter a
boat. They were then cut adrift, and the vessel, which had been
hove to about ten miles from the land, was put to sea. A strong
breeze sprang up and a heavy surf rolled upon the beach, and those
in the boat were all drowned in attempting to effect a landing. The
sun was setting as the ship left the land, and by nightfall most of
the pirates were drunk, the newly-elected commander having himself
set the example by breaking into the spirit-room. This exactly
suited De Soto's purpose; as soon as the mate had drunk himself
into a stupor, and most of the crew were incapable of protesting,
De Soto deliberately put a pistol to the head of his leader and
shot him dead, threatening to serve the first man who should
protest in the same manner. The drunken crew, so far from
protesting, hailed him as a fine fellow, and promised to follow De
Soto to the death. Their first business was to get rid of the
slaves, and this they did by taking the vessel to the West Indies
and there successfully selling them. De Soto renamed his ship the
<i>Defensor De Pedro</i>, and having refitted and provisioned her,
sailed out in quest of prey.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 260</p>-->

<p>In a few months' cruising in West Indian waters he fell in with
several vessels, plundering them, and generally murdering the
crews; in one instance, that of an American brig, the pirates
accomplished this by battening all hands below and then setting
fire to the ship. Then De Soto, cruising off Ascension, fell in
with the <i>Morning Star</i>, an English vessel bound from Ceylon
to England. He overhauled this ship, and the captain of her, having
no weapons, struck his colours. De Soto thereupon sent a party to
take possession, and with orders to kill all the people. The
pirates, however, after committing most horrible atrocities on men,
women, and children who were passengers, and killing a few,
battened the rest below, and then got drunk. Having lost a good
deal of time in these proceedings, they loaded their boats with
such valuables as they could collect, and boring several holes in
the ship's bottom, returned to their own vessel.</p>

<p>De Soto, imagining that his men had killed the people on the
<i>Morning Star</i>, sailed away; but a day later, learning what
had really occurred, put about with the intention of murdering any
survivors, but he could find no trace of the <i>Morning Star</i>,
and so inferred that she had gone down. As a matter of fact,
however, the unfortunate creatures had managed to break open the
hatches, and a passing vessel had seen them just in time and taken
them on board. The <i>Morning Star</i> went to the bottom, but most
of her people eventually reached England and made public their sad
story. De Soto, meanwhile, shaped his course for Spain, intending
to make the harbour of Corunna. Off the port he fell in with a
small merchantman, boarded, plundered, and sank her, drowning all
the crew but one man, whom he retained to act as pilot.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 261</p>-->

<p>As they were nearing the harbour with this man at the helm, De
Soto said to him:</p>

<p>"Is this the entrance?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Very well, my man, you have done well, I am obliged to
you."</p>

<p>Taking a pistol from his belt, he shot the pilot dead. At
Corunna the pirate succeeded in selling his plunder; and obtaining
ship's papers in a false name, he set sail for Cadiz, but on a dark
night, in bad weather, his vessel missed stays, and went ashore.
The crew succeeded in escaping in the boats, and De Soto then
arranged that they should march overland to Cadiz, there represent
themselves as honest shipwrecked mariners, and sell what remained
of the wreck. At Cadiz, however, in some way, the authorities grew
suspicious and arrested six of the pirates, but were not quick
enough with the others, who escaped, De Soto managing to reach
Gibraltar, where a few weeks later his identity was discovered, and
he was brought to trial, and hanged. The story of his life is told
in the <i>Military Sketch Book</i>, and the author of the account,
who saw the wretch executed, says he died truly repentant, but
without fear.</p>

<p>A like villain to De Soto was an American, Charles Gibbs, who
first went to sea in the American sloop <i>Hornet</i>, and was in
the engagement in which she captured the English sloop of war
<i>Peacock</i>. Then he joined the <i>Chesapeake</i>, and when that
ship was captured by the <i>Shannon</i>, was brought a prisoner of
war to England, and confined in Dartmoor Prison until exchanged.
Then he set up a low tavern in Boston, until, having drunk and
gambled his money away, he again went to sea in the <i>John</i> of
Buenos Ayres. The crew of this vessel mutinied, carried her to the
West Indies, and set up in those waters as pirates, making prizes
of many small vessels until they acquired a regular fleet.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 262</p>-->

<p>A British sloop of war destroyed the stronghold of these
miscreants at Havana, when it was found that they had murdered the
crews of the vessels they had captured, and it was proved that 150
persons at least had so lost their lives. The pirates escaped to
the mountains, Gibbs eventually making his way back to Boston, and
thence to Liverpool, where he lived for some time a dissipated life
on the proceeds of his piracy. In 1826 he went back to the United
States, and there succeeded in joining the Buenos Ayres rebels. In
November 1830 he shipped at New Orleans in the brig
<i>Vineyard</i>, and hearing there was money on board, he induced
some of the crew to join him in murdering the master and the mate
of the vessel, and taking possession of her. After this, certain of
the crew who had taken no part in the crime were compelled by the
pirates to navigate the vessel to Long Island, where, one rascal
informing on another, the arrest of the murderers soon followed,
and Gibbs and another ringleader were taken to New York, tried for
murder, and, in April 1831, were hanged.</p>

<p>In the first half of the century, vessels navigating the
Mediterranean and Grecian seas were in frequent danger from Greek
pirates; and the files of the <i>Times</i>, fifty years ago,
contain many reports of vessels attacked by them. In 1843 H.M.S.
<i>Locust</i> made an unsuccessful search for a reported pirate
schooner, that had actually been seen to attack a small brig off
Malaga. The schooner was laid alongside the merchantman, and thirty
armed Greeks boarded her. A little while later the brig was
scuttled, and nothing more was heard of her crew.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 263</p>-->

<p>The newspapers of 1844 report nine cases of piracy within as
many months, in Greek waters; in each instance the vessels were
scuttled and nearly all on board murdered; in one case shocking
atrocities were committed upon a girl who was taken away by the
pirate schooner, and was afterwards thrown overboard. In the same
year the <i>Times</i> reported that "Letters from Athens announce
that some pirate boats in the Channel of Andros had captured two
merchant vessels&mdash;one a royal cutter with four men and
carrying 16,000 drachmas belonging to the Greek
Government&mdash;and put their crews to death. The headless bodies
of twenty of the pirates' victims were washed ashore on the coast
of Andros."</p>

<p>This is just the sort of rascality practised, even at the
present day, by Chinese pirates; and ships in some of the rivers
are never safe from attacks of the kind. In July 1899, for example,
the Portugese steamer <i>Taiping</i>, on a voyage from Macao to
Samohui, was coming down the west river and was attacked by a gang
of pirates, who ran alongside her in a steam launch! The pirates
opened fire on the steamer with a nine-pounder gun and rifles, and
then boarded, killing the purser, who seems to have been the one
man who offered serious resistance. There were forty passengers on
board, and these were robbed of everything they possessed of any
value; but, except the purser, no one was injured. Before leaving
the ship, the pirates damaged the engines, so that they should have
time to make good their escape before the steamer could report the
affair.</p>

<p>The <i>Taiping</i> was specially prepared against the usual form
of attack by having iron rails fixed across the gangway-ports,
stairways, and so on, to prevent a sudden rush to the upper deck by
pirates who had shipped as passengers&mdash;an old trick of the
Chinese. This is a true story. Here is another from the <i>Shipping
Gazette</i> and <i>Lloyd's List</i> of May 26, 1899:&mdash;</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 264</p>-->

<p class="newspaper">"News has been received here (<i>i.e.</i>, San
Francisco) that H.M.S. <i>Torch</i> on her way from Sydney to
Samoa, destroyed a fleet of pirate sloops. (Signed) REUTER."<br>
<br>
The people of H.M.S. <i>Torch</i> have not yet been able to account
for this story, and it would be interesting to know how the yarn
originated. There is as much chance of speaking the <i>Flying
Dutchman</i> as of falling in with pirates between Sydney and
Samoa, and the regular old-fashioned pirates have, nowadays, no
more chance against steamers than have highwaymen against
locomotives, except in such instances as occur on the Chinese
rivers, where reasonable precaution, such as a half-a-dozen rifles
in the hands of as many resolute men, would settle the business of
most Chinese pirates.</p>

<p>The great mutinies at Spithead and the Nore did not end the
record of mutinies on men-o'-war. The class of men recruited in war
time led to many desperate attempts at mutiny on King's ships, but
since the long peace we have been saved this disgrace. Occasionally
Jack will make a protest, such as throwing his mess-traps or the
gun-sights overboard, for some real or imaginary injustice, and
when we read of this in the newspapers, it can be pretty well taken
for granted that injudicious officers, or even one officer who does
not "play the game fairly," is at the bottom of the trouble. One of
the most serious mutinies occurred in Bantry Bay, on board the
<i>Temeraire</i>, in December 1801. Fourteen seamen were tried and
five executed for an attempt to take the ship, which was overcome
by the resolution of the officers.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 265</p>-->

<p>In November of the following year, the men of the
<i>Gibraltar</i>, an 84-gun ship, took her from the officers on the
passage to Malta. The <i>Gibraltar</i> was in company with a
squadron of three other vessels, and when the mutineers captured
the ship they ran her under the sterns of the others, cheering and
calling upon the crews of the squadron to join them. But they
received no support, and, meanwhile, the officers, being backed by
the loyalty of the marines, soon regained possession of their ship,
and the ringleaders of the mutiny were soon afterwards hanged at
Gibraltar. In the same year the crew of the <i>Hermione</i>
murdered some of their officers, and took the ship into La Guaira;
but she was afterwards retaken and the murderers hanged.</p>

<p>In 1800 the crew of the <i>Danae</i> rose suddenly on their
officers and carried the ship into Brest, where the French treated
them as they deserved, exchanging the officers and those of the men
who had remained loyal to our flag, and handing the mutineers over
to the English Government. The ringleader of this affair was a man
named Jackson, who had been secretary to Parker, the head of the
1797 mutiny. Jackson and most of the gang were afterwards
hanged.</p>

<p>In the merchant service men often refuse duty, and, in
consequence, are sent to gaol on the arrival of their ship in port,
but beyond this offence there have been very few serious crimes of
the kind, and those that have occurred have invariably been
committed by foreigners. It is well to remember this, now that the
British merchant service is to such a great extent manned by
foreigners.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 266</p>-->

<p>The three worst mutinies in the merchant service were those of
the <i>Lennie</i>, the <i>Flowery Land</i>, and the <i>Caswell</i>.
The <i>Flowery Land</i>, in 1863, was bound from London to
Singapore, and, on September 10, seven foreigners, who formed part
of the crew, suddenly attacked the officers, murdering the captain,
his brother, the mate, the Chinese steward, and the Chinese cook.
The mutineers surprised the mate at daybreak, battering his brains
out with a handspike, then throwing him overboard. The captain and
his brother, hearing the disturbance, ran on deck and were stabbed
to death. The second mate was then compelled to navigate the ship
to the Brazilian coast, where she was scuttled, and the cook and
the steward drowned in her. The mutineers, taking the second mate
with them, landed in the boat; then the officer managed to
communicate with the authorities, and the mutineers were arrested,
sent to England, and five of them were hanged.</p>

<p>Seamen of the Latin races, known to English sailors as Dagos,
have been the criminals in every case of serious mutiny in the
merchant service during the present century. In 1830 the
<i>Vittoria</i> shipped half-a-dozen Spaniards at the Philippines,
for the passage home to London. A few days after leaving Manila,
the Spaniards suddenly attacked their shipmates in the forecastle,
stabbing three Englishmen, then they went aft and killed the
captain, the second mate, and the carpenter, but spared the chief
mate and the steward. After throwing the bodies overboard the
mutineers compelled the mate to navigate the ship to the
Californian coast; but the mate and the steward watched their
opportunity, and the mutineers a week later, having got drunk, were
attacked, three or four of them killed, the rest secured, and the
ship retaken, and sailed into port, in due course, by the aid of
two or three English among the crew, who had been kept prisoners by
the mutineers and were released by the mate and his party. The
Spaniards were in due course hanged, as were seven others who, in
the same year, mutinied on a Liverpool schooner bound home from the
same port, and luckily fallen in with by a British man-o'-war, just
after the mutineers had murdered the only three Englishmen on board
of her. One of the Spaniards betrayed his fellows, and so the crime
was discovered.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 267</p>-->

<p>The <i>Lennie</i> was a Nova Scotia ship, and she sailed from
Antwerp on October 22, 1875. Her captain was a Canadian named
Hatfield; the mate, Wortley, and the second mate, Macdonald, were
both Englishmen; the steward. Van Hoydek, was a Belgian, and the
cabin boy, Henry Trusillo, was a fellow-countryman and relation of
the steward. Besides these men there were eleven seamen, ten Greeks
and one Frenchman, a notorious ruffian. At four o'clock in the
morning, when the ship had been five days at sea and was in the Bay
of Biscay, the steward was disturbed in his sleep by a great noise
on deck. He ran to the companion, but found it fastened, then
through the closed doors he heard five shots fired, and noises as
of men falling from aloft, then he heard groans and cries of
murder, these terrifying sounds lasting for more than an hour.</p>

<p>Then the hatch was opened, and some of the Greek seamen entered
the cabin. One of them said to the steward, "Well, we are finished
now, and you can take charge of the ship."</p>

<p>"Very well," answered Van Hoydek, "where do you wish to go, and
what have you finished?"</p>

<p>"To Greece; but take the ship to Gibraltar, and we'll find our
way from there. The captain and both mates are dead."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 268</p>-->

<p>The steward promised to do this, but set a course for the
English Channel, and so steered for several hours, when one of the
mutineers discovered his intention, and he was solemnly warned that
he would be killed if he deviated from his orders. Meanwhile the
mutineers had thrown overboard the bodies of the two mates and the
captain; one of the officers had run up the rigging to escape, but
had been shot dead before he could mount half-a-dozen ratlines.
After cleaning away the horrible traces of their crime, the
murderers rigged a stage over the stern and cut out the ship's
name; they then broke into the sea-chests of their victims, and
dressed themselves in the dead men's clothes.</p>

<p>Again the steward attempted to head the ship for the Channel,
and again he was suspected, and the mutineers seriously discussed
whether they should kill him, but he with great coolness told them
if they thought they knew more navigation than he did, to navigate
the ship for themselves. One of the Greeks then took charge for two
days, and the steward was sent below.</p>

<p>In the cabin he found the boy and said to him, "Now look here,
Harry, if we take these fellows to where they want to go, there is
no knowing what they may do. When they know where they are, they
will be very likely to murder us and throw us over too. Let us try
to save the ship and our own lives as well. Now, can I trust you?"
"Yes, all right," replied the boy. "Well, then," said the steward,
"now you go down into the cabin and I will lock you in. Then you
write twenty-four notes in French and in English, stating that the
captain and officers on board of the <i>Lennie</i> are all
murdered, and that the crew have seized the ship, and that we two
are waiting assistance. While you are doing that I will go and get
twenty-four empty bottles to put them in, and then we'll throw them
overboard, and see what they send us."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 269</p>-->

<p>The boy did as he was told, and when everything was ready, the
steward again altered the course of the vessel towards the French
coast, and arriving there on the 8th of November, he threw the
bottles over, hoping that they would drift towards the coast, or
that they might attract the attention of the French authorities.
The weather became very rough, and the steward told the men that it
would be no use for them to go to sea to lose their sails, and if
they chose to go on shore, he would put them near land at a small
place he knew of where there were no police. Six of the mutineers,
approving of this suggestion, took one of the ship's boats and
landed at Les Sables d'Olonne. The steward, by this strategy having
got rid of six of the most dangerous, lay for two days near the
coast.</p>

<p>In the meantime, some of the bottles had been picked up, and two
days afterwards a pilot boat came alongside, followed by the
<i>Travailleur</i>, a French man-o'-war. The assistance had
promptly been sent by the French Government. Van Hoydek, the
steward, and the boy Harry Trusillo now came forward, and, claiming
the immediate protection of the French authorities, at once told
the whole story of the mutiny. The remaining five of the mutineers
who were on board were charged with complicity in the murder,
arrested, and placed in irons, and taken on shore by the
<i>Travailleur</i>. In the meantime the news of the occurrence was
privately communicated to the French gendarmes.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 270</p>-->

<p>While all this had been going on, the six who had landed at
Sables d'Olonne had attracted the attention of the French police
there, they having with them their officers' clothes and other
things they had seized to sell. Eventually they applied to the
Commissioners of Marine, represented themselves as being destitute,
and as having belonged to the Greek brigantine <i>St Georges</i>,
which had foundered with all hands but themselves. By this time the
news of the murder had spread through the French provinces, and
being suspected, the six rascals were soon arrested. The whole of
the eleven having undergone a preliminary examination in a French
court, were sent to England. Two of them turned Queen's evidence,
and four were convicted and hanged in Newgate.</p>

<p>Mr F. J. Dunn, one of the crew of the <i>Caswell</i>, now living
in Sydney, New South Wales, retains a remarkably vivid recollection
of the terrible experience he went through on that ship in 1875. I
have compared the story as related by him to me in 1899, with the
evidence given at the trial of the mutineers, and there is no
material difference in it. Mr Dunn is probably now the only
survivor of that affair whose whereabouts can be ascertained. Dunn
left London for Buenos Ayres in March 1875, and on arrival at that
port, his ship was condemned as unseaworthy, and so he joined the
<i>Caswell</i>, which was then on the eve of sailing for Valparaiso
to load for England. In due course the vessel arrived at her port
of loading, nothing eventful happening on the passage, then she
sailed for Queenstown on New Year's Day 1876. The crew was made up
of the captain, mate, second mate, carpenter, two apprentices, two
able seamen, Carrick and Dunn, all English or Scotsmen, a negro
steward, three Greek and two Italian seamen. The evening of the
ship's sailing, "Big George," a powerful Greek, was insubordinate,
and three days later, at eight on a Tuesday morning, just as the
wheel was being relieved, Mr Dunn describes what
follows:&mdash;</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 271</p>-->

<p class="newspaper">"I was getting the gear to ratline down the
fore-rigging, when I heard a cry and the report of a shot. On
turning round and looking aft, I saw the captain and 'Big George'
on the main deck close to the ship's side, while George was
repeatedly stabbing him with his sheath-knife; Joseph Pistolo had
left the wheel, and was standing at the end of the quarter-deck
with a revolver in his hand. The chief mate, on hearing the cry
from the captain, started to run aft to his assistance, but on
passing the galley door, the Greek cook ran out of the galley, and
forcing the mate against the rail of the ship, plunged a large
knife into his breast twice. The mate fell without a struggle. The
captain was lying under the main rigging with a revolver shot in
his forehead, and terribly wounded by knife stabs. On the second
mate seeing what was happening (he was aloft at the time) he ran
down, and started to go aft, crying, 'Put the ship back, men, and
stop this,' He was met by Gaspar Pistolo, who shot him in the arm,
and Christopher Bambos stabbed him in the back. He ran from them
and came where I was standing amidships, holding his arm. He seemed
to have completely lost his head, and was crying like a child, I
took off my neck handkerchief and started to bind up his arm. The
whole of the Greeks had gone on the quarter-deck by this time.<br>
<!--<p class="a">Page 272</p>-->
<br>
"The steward, being in the cabin, had not heard any of the trouble;
so Joseph Pistolo called down the companion to the steward that the
captain wanted him. On the steward coming up, 'Big George' seized
him by the hair, and fairly hacked him to pieces, all of them
taking part in it. 'Big George' then, with a cry of 'Maclean,
Maclean,' together with some words in their own language, rushed
off the poop on to the main deck towards Maclean. On seeing them
coming Maclean rushed forward, while I ran up the fore-rigging,
Gaspar and Joseph Pistolo firing at him as he ran. On getting a few
yards abaft the body of the skipper Maclean fell, and George and
the cook finished him with their knives. They then started to look
for M'Gregor, the carpenter, who had shut himself up in the
deckhouse, but they could not force open the door. On Joseph
Pistolo saying something to them in their own language, they
stopped trying to force it, and Joseph Pistolo called to him that
they would do him no harm if he would come out. They put their
knives up, and walked aft to the quarterdeck. The carpenter, on
their going aft, came out, where I joined him, having come down
from the foretop.<br>
<br>
"The two apprentices were just turned fourteen years of age; it was
their first voyage, and they had gone down the forepeak at the
commencement of the trouble, while Carrick, the other AB., had shut
himself up in the forecastle. The whole of the affair did not last
ten minutes from start to finish. On seeing us two
together&mdash;that is myself and the carpenter&mdash;J. Pistolo
came to us and said, 'Well, carpenter, you see what has happened.
The skipper said he would do for us before he got home, but his
turn has come first. I am sorry that Maclean got in our way, for he
was not a bad man. I have had a job to get George to spare the rest
of you, as he says dead men tell no tales, but I think there has
been enough bloodshed, so does my brother Gaspar. If you will kneel
down and swear to help us take the ship where we intend to leave
her, we won't interfere with you.'<br>
<!--<p class="a">Page 273</p>-->
<br>
"There being nothing else for it, the carpenter and I did so.
Joseph then told me to go to the wheel, as the ship was without a
helmsman since Joseph had left it to attack the captain. They then
threw overboard the dead and washed the decks. Joseph Pistolo took
command, while the cook navigated, Joseph not understanding
navigation. All of them took up their quarters in the cabin, taking
the carpenter's tools from him, and everything they thought would
serve us as weapons. They let Carrick and me come aft and take our
turns at the wheel, Carrick steering her one watch and me the
other, the rest of them attending to the trimming of the sails when
they required it. They made the carpenter do the cooking, and they
did not trouble the boys. They were too young, I suppose. This
state of affairs went on for five or six weeks. We had rounded the
Horn, and were off the South American coast. We noticed they did
not agree very well together. Joseph and his brother did not seem
to be on very friendly terms with the other three, while 'Big
George' took every opportunity to provoke us to give him and his
mates, Bambos and the ex-cook, a chance to put us out of the way.
They being well armed with revolvers, and knives stuck in their
sashes, and not allowing us to come on the quarter-deck, we had no
chance at all.<br>
<!--<p class="a">Page 274</p>-->
<br>
"Joseph Pistolo came forward in the forecastle one day, and told us
himself and brother intended to take a boat and leave us, and that
we must do the best for ourselves, as he and his brother had
prevented us from being killed up to then, the other three being of
the opinion that while we were alive they would not be safe, but
with us dead, they could scuttle the ship and go on shore where
they liked, saying they intended to take the ship to some island in
the Mediterranean, where George thought they could land without any
trouble, first getting rid of us and the ship. Joseph finished up
by saying, 'Now, boys, mind I am telling you when we are gone your
lives are in your own hands, for you will never leave the ship
alive if you don't get the best of them.' We thanked him, and the
next day Joseph and his brother left, taking with them their share
of the cabin plunder. George took charge of one watch with me and
the carpenter&mdash;me at the wheel, and the carpenter on the main
deck with one of the boys; while Bambos and the ex-cook took the
other watch, with Carrick to steer, but not allowing us to come off
the main deck for anything; while they did nothing but try to get
us to do something for an excuse to murder us, throwing boiling tea
over us when we were getting our meals, also scalding rice. At last
M'Gregor, Carrick, and myself managed to get together without them
seeing us, and we determined to end it one way or the other. 'Big
George' told me and the carpenter that he would send us to look for
the captain before the morning. He could speak a little broken
English. It was on a Saturday, and the only chance we had was in
the middle watch. It was a fine night. I was at the wheel. 'Big
George' was walking the weather side of the quarter-deck. Bambos
and the ex-cook were asleep in the cabin. It was their watch below.
We had arranged a plan between us&mdash;Carrick. M'Gregor, and
myself 'Big George' would get tired of walking about the whole of
the watch; he would lean over the weather rail sometimes for ten
minutes or so. If we could only get within striking distance of him
we should be right. He being well armed and always on the watch, it
would have been all wrong should he have seen us coming. I had
secured a heavy soldering iron a few days before, while the
carpenter had got hold of a short axe that was left in the
galley.<br>
<!--<p class="a">Page 275</p>-->
<br>
"About 2.30 A.M. I noticed George leaning over the weather rail. I
gave the signal to the carpenter, who was watching on the main deck
as near aft as he could get. I took the soldering iron from the leg
of my trousers, where I had it concealed from the time I went to
the wheel, let go the wheel, and rushed at George, hitting him over
the head, and as he turned, the carpenter gave him another blow
with the axe that settled him; but he had alarmed the other two in
the cabin. We left him and jumped down in the cabin. As we entered,
the cook fired a shot at us, but it missed, and went through the
deck. After a bit of a rough-and-tumble for five minutes or
so&mdash;Carrick coming to our assistance&mdash;we got the best of
them, the cook being killed and Bambos wounded. On reaching the
deck we found 'Big George' dead. We put them over the side, and
next saw to Christopher Bambos' wounds, and confined him in a cabin
until we arrived at Queenstown, where he was tried and hanged.
Joseph Pistolo was arrested at Monte Video two years after, and
shared the same fate. Carrick, M'Gregor, and myself sailed the ship
home, Carrick navigating. We passed a ship on the Equator and told
them of the affair. They reported us on arrival, so it was known a
fortnight before we got to Queenstown. On arrival off the Irish
coast, H.M.S. <i>Goshawk</i> was on the look-out for us, and put an
officer and crew on board, and our troubles were at an end. The
underwriters and owners recompensed us for bringing the ship
home."</p>

<p>The <i>Caswell</i> had an unfortunate history: the mutiny
occurred on her first voyage; a few years later she was nearly lost
on a lee shore: and in 1899 she sailed from Newcastle, New South
Wales, for Guayaquil with a cargo of coal, and was never afterwards
heard of.</p>

<p>One of the most extraordinary stories of this kind is that of
the ship <i>Tory</i>. She arrived in the West India Docks from
Hong-Kong in November 1845, when the Thames police arrested sixteen
of her crew, one of them badly cut about the head, and took a
seventeenth under arrest to the hospital, he having been shot in
the leg by the master of the ship, George Johnson, who appeared at
the police court to charge the crew with mutiny and murder. The
ship was a vessel of 608 tons, owned by Duncan of Liverpool, and
she brought a cargo worth £30,000 in tea and silks, besides several
passengers, among them some women; her crew consisted of twenty-six
men and boys. The master on his arrival reported that the second
mate had jumped overboard, and the first mate had been murdered,
that the crew had conspired together to take his life and run away
with the ship, and that it was only by the free use of firearms and
cutlasses, which accounted for the wounded men, that he preserved
the command. Before the case had been long under inquiry, the
evidence of the passengers and the statements of the crew put an
entirely different complexion upon it, and the crew were taken out
of the prisoner's dock, the master put in their place, and he was
ultimately committed for trial for murder. When nearing St Helena
the provisions had run very low, and the whole crew were put on
short allowances, the captain announcing that he intended to call
at St Helena for stores; but he passed this island, and when
remonstrated with, said he had made up his mind to go on to
Ascension, but, instead of doing so, kept on his course; then, a
few days later&mdash;partially, it was alleged, through
drink&mdash;he went mad, and attacked his officers and men,
indiscriminately slashing and stabbing some with cutlasses, and
wounding others with firearms, driving one officer overboard at the
point of a bayonet. On one occasion, he sent for three men to his
cabin, receiving them there one at a time, and then attacking them
with such ferocity that a beam running across the cabin ceiling was
cut several inches deep by the force of the blows from his cutlass.
Johnson was found not guilty on the ground of insanity.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 277</p>-->

<p>I do not think the story of the <i>Indefatigable</i> mutiny has
been printed in any book. This vessel was on a voyage from Chili to
Sydney with a cargo of wheat. On July 22, 1828, she was three or
four days' sail from the Low Archipelago. Loftgreen, the mate, had
the middle watch, and on the forecastle Antonio Mancillo kept the
look-out. The vessel a few years before this time had been a crack
Australian trader; she was then called the <i>Calder</i>, and was
commanded by Dillon, the man who afterwards solved the La Perouse
mystery; she was, on this voyage, the property of a Mr John Duncan
of Valparaiso, and six of her crew were Chilians, picked up at the
last moment before sailing. The master, Joseph Hunter, and the
mates had had frequent cause to speak sharply to the Chilians, who
were both lazy and incompetent; but there was no suspicion in the
minds of the Englishmen that any dangerous disaffection existed. It
was a clear starlight night, with only just enough wind to keep the
sails from flapping, and the mate, as he walked the short poop, had
all he could do to keep awake; suddenly the look-out man cried in
broken English that there was an island right ahead&mdash;"Come
forward, sir, and look!"</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 278</p>-->

<p>The mate ran forward to the forecastle, and just as he reached
it two men dashed out and pinioned his arms, while Mancillo held
the point of a knife to his throat, whispering in his ear, the
while, that if he uttered a word he was a dead man. But Loftgreen
struggled desperately, and, without heeding the threats, cried
murder several times. In the scuffle the mutineers dropped their
knives, and when for a moment they relaxed their hold and stooped
to pick them up, Loftgreen managed to shake them off and run aft;
then he found that he had been stabbed several times in the right
arm and was bleeding profusely, but he reached his cabin, took a
pair of pistols from his bunk, and crying loudly for help, prepared
to fight the mutineers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the noise first awakened the steward, who, as he came
hurrying up the companion, was met by a Chilian, who struck him
over the shoulder with a cutlass, and he fell severely wounded at
the foot of the ladder. Captain Hunter, armed with pistols and
cutlass, hearing the mate's cries, opened his cabin door just as
some of the mutineers reached it. Then the skipper, in his
excitement taking no aim, fired both pistols, hitting no one, but
for some minutes he fought desperately with his cutlass, then,
covered with wounds, fell dead.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 279</p>-->

<p>Another party of the Chilians had during this time attacked
Loftgreen, who had been joined by the second mate, and who fought
well, but they were soon overpowered, ironed, and, with the
steward, lashed to stanchions.</p>

<p>Before the mutineers began their work, they had battened down
the fore-scuttle, confining the carpenter, the cook, and the three
other seamen, so that the vessel was now in possession of the
Chilians. Having thrown the body of the captain overboard, the
mutineers broke open the spirit room and drank freely, but kept
sober enough to set a guard over their prisoners, and to steer the
ship and trim the sails. The next morning they had a consultation,
and, as a result, hove the ship to, and hoisted out a boat, storing
it with a couple of breakers of water, a bag of biscuits, and some
salt meat.</p>

<p>Loftgreen was then sent for, and ordered to draw a rough chart,
showing the course and distance to the nearest land, Mancillo
standing over him with a loaded pistol the while. The mate
remonstrated, saying that the nearest land was a cannibal island,
and was answered, "so much the better."</p>

<p>Loftgreen, notwithstanding that he was wounded and very much
agitated, remembered that the mutineers could not in all
probability read English. "Mancillo," said he, "see I have drawn a
chart of this savage island, and written on the back of it the
course and distance. I have also warned them to look out for the
natives, they are cannibals; you do not object to this, I
hope."</p>

<p>Mancillo looked critically at the writing, and then said, "We
are not murderers, and do not object if the words are as you
say."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 280</p>-->

<p>But Loftgreen had really drawn a chart showing the course and
distance to Tahiti, and the words he had written were, "Coast all
the islands, they are dangerous; land nowhere till you reach
Tahiti. Don't show this to any one; I am forced to take the ship to
Manila, but will try to retake her; I think I can gain over Jose
and the cook."</p>

<p>Loftgreen was then put in irons, and one of the mutineers kept
guard over him, while the others lowered a boat, and forced Todd,
the second mate, the carpenter, the steward, and a Swedish seaman
into her. Then Mancillo handed the second mate a compass and said:
"We give you a fine chart made by the mate, who has written sailing
directions. We do not wish to injure you."</p>

<p>Todd looked at the writing and adroitly replied that there was
mighty little chance of escaping the savages with such means; then
the boat was cut adrift, the mutineers ran up the Chilian flag and
flung jeers at the castaways as the boat dropped astern, crying to
them to keep in condition, as cannibals liked plump men. Poor Todd,
though the nearest land was 600 miles away, kept his heart up.
"Better the open sea," he said, "than the brig and these
cut-throats." Then he took the tiller, the three others hoisted the
sail, and the boat was headed due west, which, according to the
mate's chart, would bring them to the eastermost of the
Paumotus.</p>

<p>They had enough biscuits, raw meat, and water to last them with
great economy for three weeks, their boat was a good one, they were
provided with a compass, and the course to be steered; the men were
on good terms with each other and submissive to their officer, so
that they had much to be thankful for, and their chief sorrow on
leaving the ship was their fear for the safety of Loftgreen.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 281</p>-->

<p>On August 7&mdash;after fifteen days in the open boat&mdash;they
made Resolution Island, almost the centre of the Paumotu
Archipelago, having passed, without sighting them, several islands
which lie further to the East. To their joy, on reaching Resolution
Island the natives put off in canoes and treated them with great
kindness, so that they were induced to land, staying a day and a
night, and receiving a stock of cocoanuts and fresh water. Then
they continued on their course, encountering a severe gale in which
they lost their rudder and were nearly swamped, and the compass was
so badly damaged as to be rendered useless. Fortunately they soon
made Tahiti, after having been altogether twenty-four days in the
boat. Here, to their surprise, instead of being received cordially,
they were instantly made prisoners. Luckily, an American whaler
happened to be lying in the port, and her master, seeing the
commotion from the deck of his ship, landed to inquire the cause;
explanations followed, and the castaways were then treated with
every kindness. It appeared that a party of runaway convicts had
called at the island a few days before in a ship's longboat; they
had stolen a missionary's whaler that had been lying in the harbour
and put to sea in her. Canoes gave chase, the convicts fired upon
the Tahitians, killing some of them. The natives at first thought
that Todd and his companions were another party of similar rascals.
The castaways, after a short stay at Tahiti, were taken on board
the whale ship <i>Tiger</i> and conveyed in licr to Sydney, where
they told their story.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 282</p>-->

<p>Meanwhile, as soon as the boat was clear of the brig, Loftgreen
was sent for and ordered to navigate the vessel to Guam, one of the
Ladrone Islands. The voyage, thus began, lasted from the 22nd July
till the 12th December. Fine calm weather prevailed the whole time,
and it was fortunate that it was so, for the mutineers would only
furl or trim the sails just when the humour took them, and four out
of the six rascals were drunk during the whole time. The four
drunkards soon took it into their heads that it was necessary for
their safety that Loftgreen should be murdered; but the two sober
men, knowing the need of his navigation, defended him; and as the
mate was taking his observations with the sextant every day, he
heard the discussion as to when and how he should be killed. The
mutineers seemed to have no idea that the Ladrones were at all
civilised, and were under the impression that on arrival there they
could sell the ship to the natives.</p>

<p>In due course they sighted Guam, and as the ship sailed into the
harbour, the mutineers remarked to one another that the buildings
looked as if there were Europeans living there, but they supposed
it would be all right. The ship's anchor was let go and a boat
lowered; Mancillo and another man got in her and pulled ashore to
strike a bargain, when they were surprised to find themselves taken
in charge by an Alcade and a guard of Spanish soldiers. The
officers closely questioned them, and not considering their answer
satisfactory, he put them in a boat, and with a guard rowed off to
the ship.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 283</p>-->

<p>The men on the brig, seeing the boat approach with a party of
soldiers in it, concluded that their comrades had betrayed them,
and they ran below to hide themselves, leaving Loftgreen on deck to
receive the Alcade, who was soon in possession of the whole story.
Thereupon the brig was seized and every one on board taken to a
guard-house. Next day the Spanish governor heard the mate's
evidence, and believing it, the mutineers were placed in irons, and
Loftgreen treated with every kindness. Soon afterwards H.M.S.
<i>Rainbow</i>, then commanded by Captain Rous (afterwards the
famous racing admiral), entered the port, and she took Loftgreen
and the mutineers to Manila, where, after trial before a Spanish
court, the murderers were hanged, the <i>Indefatigable</i>
condemned as a prize to the Government, and Loftgreen sent to
Sydney.</p>

<p>The gold robbery business is managed now with considerable
skill. In recent years it has been nothing uncommon for a mail
steamer from Australia, on arrival at her destination, to find the
specie room short of a box or two of gold; and no trace is ever
afterwards found of the thieves. They went at it in rougher fashion
fifty years ago; the <i>Nelson</i> gold robbery is an example.</p>

<p>The <i>Nelson</i>, a sailing ship, in 1852, was lying at anchor
in Hobson's Bay the night before sailing for England, with an
amount of gold bullion on board to the value of £25,000. On the
evening of April 2 the captain was on shore at the agent's office,
and the officers and crew, with the exception of the mate, three
seamen, and a boy, were on shore for the night. At midnight, two
boats containing twenty-two persons, some of them dressed as women,
pulled quietly alongside the ship. These people gained the main
deck and the forecastle without waking any one; then suddenly
seized the three seamen and the boys, and securely lashed and
gagged them, threatening instant death if they made a cry;
meanwhile another party went aft to where the mate and the
carpenter were sleeping, and attacked them in like manner.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 284</p>-->

<p>The mate fought desperately, but was shot in the thigh by one of
his assailants, and ultimately secured. Then the robbers proceeded
to the storeroom, and deliberately hoisted up the twenty-three
boxes of gold it contained, and lowered them into the boats. The
thieves then carefully threw overboard everything that could be
used as a weapon, and carried all the prisoners into the storeroom,
closing and battening the hatch upon them, then they got into their
boats and rowed away. During these proceedings, one of the crew had
been sleeping on deck, and had been overlooked by the thieves, and
he, waking and seeing what was going on, hid himself until the
thieves had cleared out, then he released the prisoners from the
storeroom, and the mate, wounded as he was, lowered a boat and
rowed ashore to alarm the authorities. Water police and harbour
master's boats were sent in search, but no trace was discovered
until daylight, when on the shores of the bay, half-a-dozen miles
away, an abandoned boat was seen, and on the sand were the wheel
tracks of a waggon. What became of the gold has never been
discovered; but, subsequently, four men were arrested, and three of
them convicted, the crew swearing to them as having taken part in
the crime; and a Melbourne storekeeper is alleged to have bought
the gold at thirty shillings an ounce, and afterwards to have left
for England.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 285</p>-->

<p>In 1856, the <i>Strebon Heath</i>, a sailing ship, was carrying
about £250,000 worth of bullion to England, and soon after leaving
England, a man named William Lewis unfolded to other members of the
crew a plot he had arranged, to take the ship and carry her to the
South American coast. For his purpose he, after swearing some of
the men to secrecy, showed them a supply of firearms and daggers he
had stowed in his bunk, and a couple of bottles of laudanum with
which he proposed to doctor the soup for the cabin dinner, and
poison the twenty-two passengers on board. Fortunately the other
seamen were honest fellows, and they reported the whole affair to
the captain, who promptly put Lewis in irons and carried him thus
to London, where he was tried at the Central Criminal Court and
sentenced to transportation for life.</p>

<p>Broaching cargo is another form of sea crime carried on to this
day. Some years ago I was on board of a ship carrying a valuable
general cargo, in which the steerage passengers and one watch of
the crew combined to steal property worth altogether about £800.
The business was carried on so well that it was not suspected until
the ship was nearly at her destination. As soon as this watch came
on deck at night, certain of the men were told off to keep guard,
while others who had in some way secured the keys of the locked
fore-hatch, went below and rummaged the cargo, emptying case after
case of jewellery, beer, spirits, drapery, cutlery, and preserved
foods, such as pickles, jams, condensed milk, and similar articles.
The extraordinary part of the affair was the fact that the officer
in charge of the watch never appears to have had the slightest idea
of what his men were doing, and none of the men were tempted to get
drunk, notwithstanding the quantity of liquor that was among the
goods stolen. There is no doubt the steerage passengers had a hand
in the business, for many of them were afterwards seen on shore
wearing clothing known to have been in the cargo, but the police
could not obtain evidence enough to convict them. The thieves
burrowed like rabbits into the ship's hold, leaving the top of the
cargo undisturbed, so that when, occasionally, the hatch was opened
there were no traces of anything unusual.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 286</p>-->

<p>On arrival in port, the ship, having about fifty tons of
explosives on board, was anchored some distance below the usual
anchorage to discharge the dangerous part of her cargo. The place
was at that time a quiet little sleepy hollow, and a glimmering of
suspicion having got into the captain's head that something was
wrong, when the pilot left the ship late in the evening he was told
to send the police boat to her as soon as possible. The police boat
duly came the following morning at about seven o'clock and found
the officers asleep in their beds, and the whole crew, including
the anchor watch, missing. They had made a raft during the night of
odd planks, and thus got on shore, and not one of them was ever
afterwards heard of. When what remained of the ship's cargo was
discharging, it was seen what a remarkable escape from disaster
those on board of her had experienced.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 287</p>-->

<p>The thieves had so burrowed in the hold that if we had come in
for any serious rolling, the heavy cargo would have shifted and
capsized the ship&mdash;but this was not the worst. The magazine,
as it was called, was merely a deal plank compartment in the hold
amidships, and in this the fifty tons of powder and fireworks were
stowed in kegs and wooden cases. The bulkhead of this compartment
was covered with candle-grease, and burnt black in several places
where the thieves had stuck candles to light them at their
work.</p>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII. THE SOUTH SEAS.</h2>

<h3>How the Islands were Populated&mdash;Castaways among the
Blacks&mdash;True Stories of Strange Adventures.</h3>

<p>When the century opened, the story of the South Seas could be
told in a chapter. An Englishman's knowledge of the Pacific for
generations later can be summed up in the phrase that it was dotted
with coral reefs, peopled by savages, and ruled by the "King of the
Cannibal Islands." But the long peace drove adventurers, men who if
they had lived a century earlier would have been buccaneers, out of
civilised waters. Steam made of ocean routes crowded highways of
commerce, too well policed for any but respectable travellers to
journey upon, and vagabond sea rovers, and men with a past to be
buried, or with the love of adventure, abandoned the regular
furrows of the propeller-ploughed Atlantic for the trackless wastes
of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 289</p>-->

<p>It was not until 1809, nearly twenty years after the mutiny of
the <i>Bounty</i>, that the first news of the lost mutineers
reached England, when Captain Folgar of the American ship
<i>Topaz</i>, reported to Sir Sydney Smith at Rio de Janeiro his
re-discovery of Pitcairn, peopled by a half-caste race of
thirty-five persons and by one Englishman, calling himself
Alexander Smith, the only mutineer remaining alive. Six years
longer elapsed before the English Government had a vessel in these
seas, and Sir Thomas Staines, in H.M.S. <i>Briton</i>, sighted it
by mere accident. "I fell in with an island where none is laid down
on the charts," he writes to the Admiralty, being on his passage
from the Marquesas to Valparaiso; "the island must undoubtedly be
that called Pitcairn," he adds, and then relates his meeting with
Smith, then calling himself Adams, and with Thursday October
Christian, the son of the ringleader of the mutineers.</p>

<p>When the century opened, the only settlement in the South
Pacific was the convict station at Sydney; the islands of New
Zealand were still "savage;" the discovery that Tasmania was a
separate island from the main Australian continent was a year old,
and Flinders and Bass, the discoverers, had gone their several
ways, and were within sight of their ending: Flinders upon the
survey of the continent, which was to end in his shipwreck,
followed by captivity, and soon after, in 1814, death; Bass in a
trading voyage to the South Seas, there to go out of history, no
man knows whither.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Their romantic story is told in <i>The Naval
Pioneers of Australia</i>: Louis Becke and Walter Jeffery (John
Murray, London, 1899).]</p>

<p>Missionary work in the Pacific&mdash;if the planting of the
cross by the Spaniards in the far north-west, in the Philippines
and adjacent islands, be excepted&mdash;was still so much in its
infancy that the account of the second voyage of the <i>Duff</i>,
related in the <i>Journal of a Captured Missionary</i>, was only
published in 1800, and the mission was then always described as to
"cannibals," while dozens of islands, now well-known <i>copra</i>
trading stations, whence the native races have disappeared, were
then undiscovered.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 290</p>-->

<p>For nearly forty years the fate of La Perouse and his comrades
remained a mystery. The French admiral in the <i>Astrolabe</i>,
with the <i>Boussole</i> in company, in continuation of his voyage
of discovery, left Botany Bay in 1788, just as the first fleet for
the colonisation of New South Wales was leaving the bay for Port
Jackson; and the English officers were the last Europeans to speak
with the Frenchmen. In 1791 Captain Hunter, on his way from Sydney
to England, reported that he had seen natives in canoes off the
Admiralty Islands, dressed in portions of European clothing, and
wearing French naval sword belts. In the same year Admiral
D'Entrecasteaux was despatched by the French Government upon an
expedition of discovery, with orders to search for traces of the
missing ships&mdash;in the course of his voyage sighting, but not
searching, the island of Vanikoro in the Santa Cruz group.</p>

<p>In 1813 the East India Company's ship <i>Hunter</i>, cruising in
the South Seas, left two sailors, a Prussian and a lascar, upon the
island of Tucopia in the Santa Cruz group. And, in 1826, Mr Peter
Dillon, the officer in charge of the boat which had landed the
seamen, being in command of a ship in this quarter of the world,
determined to call at <i>Tucopia</i>, and see if his old shipmates
were still alive. They were; and they informed him that on the
neighbouring island of Vanikoro, so late as 1820, there were living
two survivors of the La Perouse expedition, besides a great
quantity of stores and wreckage from the ships.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 291</p>-->

<p>Dillon was unable to make the island to satisfy himself of the
truth of these statements, but he prevailed upon the East India
Company, upon his return, to send him in the <i>Research</i> to the
island. He reached Vanikoro in September 1827, and there, though
the two men were dead, he learned from the natives the solution of
the mystery. The ships had been wrecked on Vanikoro reefs forty
years before; some of the crews had met their deaths by drowning or
at the hands of the natives, others had built a brig from the
timbers of the wrecks, and in her, with La Perouse, had sailed in
search of help. The brig was never more heard of, and it was
conjectured that she was wrecked at the Admiralty Isles, the relics
seen by Captain Hunter in 1791 being those of her people.</p>

<p>Dumont D'Urville, in April 1826, was sent by the French
Government, who had heard of Dillon's expedition, to join the
search in a new <i>Astrolabe</i>, but he arrived after Dillon had
completed his discovery. Dillon ruined himself in the enterprise,
and the East India Company gave him nothing in return for the
honour he had conferred upon it; but France made him a Chevalier,
and he died one of her most honoured men.</p>

<p>During the first half of the century the South Sea Islands were
slowly populated by the "civilised" from three great sources:
castaways, deserters from whalers and traders, and runaway
convicts. This two-to-one proportion of rascals to unfortunates was
not altogether counterbalanced by the small number of decent men
who then settled in the islands, nor were the convicts in many
cases a worse leaven than the deserters; nor the castaways, in all
instances, a better than the other two elements. Prisoners at the
penal settlements often stowed away on board whalers, and
notwithstanding the heavy penalties imposed for harbouring convicts
the masters of the ships were often short-handed, therefore glad to
get these men, for there were many seamen among them, or at least a
majority, with a knowledge picked up on the long sea voyage in the
transport, that would serve their purpose.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 292</p>-->

<p>Such men when they got to sea, of course, pretty soon fell out
with the master or the mates; then the "bolters," as the runaways
were called, were either marooned, or deserted at the first island
where the whaler, or the trader, stopped to wood and water. What
fearful crimes, what horrible incidents, could be told and have
been printed of these people! Many of the tragic stories of the
South Seas told by Louis Becke are true.</p>

<p>On February 1, 1843, the <i>Giraffe</i>, bound from Sydney to
Manila, was off Pleasant Island. It is only a dot on the largest
map, lying to the west of the Gilbert group, close to the Equator,
about twenty degrees to the eastward of New Guinea. Simpson, master
of the <i>Giraffe</i>, reported that this island, like many others
with which he was acquainted, was infested with a gang of rascals,
comprising runaway convicts, time-expired men, or deserters from
whalers. On his ship bringing-to off the island, she was boarded by
George Lovett, who said he was a deserter from the <i>Offley</i>,
whaler, of London. Lovett informed him that there were seven
Europeans with him, all deserters. On January 31 one of these men
shot another in a drunken quarrel; they manufactured the drink by
distilling stuff from the cocoanut trees. Not long before this,
several runaway convicts had landed there, among them a fellow who
became known to posterity as "Monster Jones." In October 1841 there
were eleven deserters and bolters on the island, and Jones decided
that this was too many for comfort, so he invited them all to a
feast. The food had previously been prepared by him, and seven died
poisoned; the remaining four refused to eat, so, waiting
opportunities of catching them alone, Jones shot them one at a
time. After this the natives cut him, thinking he was dangerous
even to them; so he left in a whaler, and the last heard of him was
that he had shipped at Guam on a vessel bound to England.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 293</p>-->

<p>The capture of the <i>Cyprus</i> was adapted by Marcus Clarke
for the main incident of <i>For the Term of His Natural Life</i>;
the true story was little altered in the novel. In August 1829 the
<i>Cyprus</i>, while lying in Recherche Bay, Tasmania, was captured
by the thirty-one prisoners on board, led by a man named Swallow,
who eighteen years before had cut out a schooner in Port Jackson,
and was a man of considerable intelligence and great courage. The
transport in which he had come out to Australia was caught in a
hurricane and lay on her beam ends. The captain called for
volunteers to cut away the masts. No man moved, the danger appalled
them. Then Swallow stepped forward, saying that his life was of no
value, pushed aside the captain who was himself about to undertake
the dangerous task, and did what was necessary. For his conduct on
that occasion, although he had made more than one attempt to
escape, he had been treated with leniency. On board the
<i>Cyprus</i> was Lieutenant Carew in charge of a guard of ten
soldiers, Mrs Carew, and a child. Carew imprudently left the ship
in a boat to go fishing, accompanied by a prisoner named Popjoy,
the surgeon, the mate, and a soldier. Just after the boat was clear
of the brig, the convicts, led by Swallow, suddenly rose upon the
remainder of the guard.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 294</p>-->

<p>The prisoners had been left without irons, and nine of them were
allowed on deck for exercise with only two soldiers in charge. The
vessel was taken without bloodshed, and, after a great deal of
parleying, the mutineers set on shore the remainder of the guard,
and thirteen prisoners who refused to join them, with Mrs Carew and
her child. Altogether forty-five persons were landed, and a supply
of food was given to them. They were upon a desolate coast, and
during the thirteen days they remained, suffered great hardships.
They constructed a coracle of wicker work from wattle branches
covered with canvas, and in this frail barque two prisoners, Morgan
and Popjoy, put to sea, happily meeting with a vessel in a
neighbouring bay, 20 miles distant. Meanwhile, the mutineers
carried the <i>Cyprus</i> to the Friendly Islands and thence to
Japan, where seven of them left, and the rest took the brig to
China. At Canton, having scuttled the vessel off the coast, they
landed in the character of shipwrecked seamen in a boat with the
name <i>Edward</i> painted on her stern; their story was believed,
and Swallow and three others were given a free passage to England.
A few days after they sailed, a second boat came in, but the men in
her had forgotten their parts, and gave wrong names and dates. The
whole story was then suspected, and these men were arrested, sent
to England as prisoners, and advice of the real character of
Swallow was despatched home. Swallow, however, was clever enough to
land at Margate, and escaped for the time, but on the ship entering
the Thames his two companions were arrested, tried, and executed.
Swallow was later on captured, and for want of evidence would have
been acquitted, but Popjoy, who had meanwhile been released in
consequence of his good conduct, happened to be in the Thames
Police Court under arrest for a trifling offence, and his evidence
convicted Swallow as an escaped prisoner, but was not considered
strong enough to justify hanging him, and he was sent out to Port
Arthur, where he subsequently died.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 295</p>-->

<p>Another case of the kind is that of the brig <i>Frederick</i>,
seized in January 1834 at Macquarie Harbour. The ringleader, John
Barker, understood navigation, and several of the prisoners were
sailors by profession. After a very rough voyage of six weeks, they
succeeded in making Valdivia in South America, where they scuttled
the vessel, and landed and made a clean breast of their story to
the governor, who received them kindly, and eventually they settled
in the place, marrying and becoming decent citizens. Then H.M.S.
<i>Blonde</i> put into the port; her captain discovered them, and
demanded that they should be delivered to him. The governor refused
to give them up, and the <i>Blonde</i> departed, returning later
when a new governor had been appointed. This man put them under
arrest while he was negotiating with the British officer, but
Barker and three others, who had just built a boat for the use of
the governor, managed to launch her and escape; the rest were put
on board the English warship, taken to England, and again
transported for life to Van Dieman's land, arriving there four
years from the date of their escape. Barker and his companions were
never afterwards heard of.</p>

<p>In another case, in 1833, an ex-lieutenant in the navy, named
Darby, who had fought at Navarino, carried off a 25-ton schooner,
the <i>Badger</i>, and in company with a convict clergyman and
half-a-dozen convict seamen, made good his escape, and there is
reason to beheve the whole party reached one of the South Sea
Islands and lived out the remainder of their lives there.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 296</p>-->

<p>These cases could be multiplied till the story of them filled a
book, which would be in effect the biographies of a great many of
the first colonists of the coral islands of the Pacific. Commodore
Wilkes, in charge of the United States Exploring Expedition, the
first and only American enterprise of the kind, relates his
meetings at one of the islands of the Fiji group, in 1840, with
Paddy Connel of County Clare. Connel had belonged to the army, and
was in one of the regiments sent to oppose the French landing; but
the regimental band, in an incautious moment, struck up a White
Boy's tune, and Paddy deserted and joined the enemy. When Lord
Cornwallis won his battle, Paddy was among the prisoners, and his
accent showing he was not a Frenchman, he was mercifully not
hanged, but transported. From New South Wales he managed, after
getting a ticket of leave, to stow away on a ship bound to Tonga,
where he arrived soon after the cutting off of the <i>Port au
Prince</i> at that island. The ship then went to Fiji, and there
Paddy left her, and when Wilkes met him he had been nearly forty
years living with the natives&mdash;a man of good repute, the
husband of a hundred wives, the father of forty-eight half castes.
At the same island Commodore Wilkes met an Englishman, or what was
once an Englishman, calling himself James Housman, who occupied the
dignified position of cup-bearer to the King of Fiji.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 297</p>-->

<p>Mr Becke, who knows the South Seas better than most men, has
well retold many old stories of the cutting off of traders in the
islands. The adventures of Mariner, who was one of the crew of the
<i>Port au Prince</i>, which was seized by the natives of Lefuka in
the Friendly Islands in 1805, is an instance among many, and the
cutting off of the <i>Boyd</i>, in 1809, is also an old story. The
Maoris at Whangaroa, it will be remembered, murdered her European
complement of some sixty persons, sparing only three, who were
afterwards rescued with much difficulty and only by the exercise of
great diplomacy. The timbers of the <i>Boyd</i> are still to be
seen protruding from the harbour mud at low water.</p>

<p>In May 1826 the <i>La Fayette</i>, an American whaler, was in
the Tongan group when some of her crew, while wooding and watering
at a small island, met a Hawaiian native, who informed them he was
one of the survivors of the <i>Port au Prince</i>. This man said
that the <i>La Fayette</i> was the second vessel to visit the
island; in the first that had called, about ten years before, there
was a very big stout woman who had with her a little girl of about
eight years of age. The woman told him she was an Englishwoman who
had escaped from the Maoris. Description and date leave little
doubt that this was a woman named Charlotte Badger, and here is her
story: The <i>Venus</i>, a colonial brig, sailed from Sydney for
Hobart in November 1800, having on board some male prisoners and
two women. While at anchor in Twofold Bay <i>en route</i>, the
captain being on shore, a quantity of rum was smuggled on board,
and when the master returned to his ship he found all hands, from
the mate down, drunk, and the two convict ladies entertaining them
with a dance. After some difficulty the master restored order, and
proceeded to his destination.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 298</p>-->

<p>A few days later, while the ship was in a small bay near Hobart,
Kelly the mate, and three others, assisted by the two women,
suddenly rose on the crew, and with firearms drove them into the
boat, cut her adrift, and sailed off with the brig. As soon as the
alarm was given the vessel was chased; but nothing was heard of her
for more than a year. Then it was reported in Sydney by the master
of a vessel that he, while at the Bay of Islands, New Zealand, had
met with traces of the <i>Venus</i>, and by degrees the rest of the
story was unfolded. After committing all sorts of atrocities, the
pirates made friends with the Maoris, burnt the ship, and went to
live with them. In 1808 a British man-o'-war came across Kelly,
captured him, and he was hanged in England; an American whaler met
with another of the mutineers, and he came to the same end. All the
others except Badger and her child were lost trace of, but Badger
was met with in 1808, when she was offered a passage to Sydney, but
declined it, saying she preferred to die with the Maoris; then no
more was heard of her until the <i>La Fayette</i>, in 1826, arrived
in Sydney with the report from Tonga.</p>

<p>In the year 1693 <i>The Adventures of Jaques Sadeur</i> was
published, and a few months later an English translation was
printed in England, entitled <i>A New Discovery of Terra
Incognita&mdash;Australia or the Southern World</i>. This
publication purported to be the story of a Frenchman who had been
wrecked on the Great Southern Continent, and had spent thirty-five
years among the savages. It was fictitious from beginning to end;
among the adventures Sadeur relates is one in which he rode
cross-legged upon a dragon, mistaking, perhaps, a turtle for this
creature! Sadeur seems to have written a couple of hundred years
too soon; he was disbelieved, and no learned societies or
distinguished persons patronised him; there was no enterprising
magazine to give him bold advertisement.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 299</p>-->

<p>It is curious how unlucky Frenchmen have been in the South Seas.
There are plenty of very remarkable true stories of adventures of
French castaways, and not the imagination of a Defoe, but the
industry of a reader and compiler, is all that is required to
construct thrilling narratives of shipwreck and strange adventures
among blacks.</p>

<p>In 1858 Narcisse Pellatier sailed from Bordeaux as cabin boy on
the <i>St Paul</i> of that port, bound to China, where she shipped
350 emigrants for Sydney. On the way to Sydney, the <i>St Paul</i>
struck a reef on the Louisiade group of Islands, and became a
wreck. All hands reached the shore in safety, but the savages
showed signs of attacking them, and the Chinese emigrants were so
frightened of the islanders that the Europeans saw that they would
be of no use for defence. Thereupon the crew seized the best boat
and left the island, in the hope of making the Australian coast It
was afterwards discovered that the Chinese were then seized and
penned off in pairs by the savages, who deliberately fattened, then
ate them; one Chinaman was kept for some unknown reason, and he was
afterwards rescued and told the story. Meanwhile the Europeans,
after great suffering, reached the northern coast of Australia,
near Cape Direction. The captain, seven seamen, and the boy
Pellatier, were all that now remained alive of the European
crew.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 300</p>-->

<p>These persons landed and made a search for water, finding only
enough to give some of them a sip. At the moment of discovering the
water, a party of blacks was seen in the distance; the seamen ran
to their boats, jumped in, and rowed away, leaving Pellatier lying
exhausted on the ground. The boat ultimately reached New Caledonia
and reported all that had happened, and that there was no doubt
Pellatier had perished. In 1875 a pearling vessel was lying under
the lee of Night Island, within the Great Barrier Reef, and some of
her crew made friends with the blacks on the shore of the mainland.
Among these natives was one of lighter colour than the others, and
the crew were informed "this fellow a white fellow." He was induced
to come on board the schooner's boat, though not without
difficulty, and as the boat pushed off from the beach, he seemed
half inclined to spring overboard and rejoin the natives. Some
incoherent French words escaped from his lips, and his affrighted
eyes, as he glanced from one to the other of the boat's crew,
showed that he was under strong excitement. As soon as he stood
upon the schooner's deck, however, his alarm seemed to subside, and
he tried to express his satisfaction at again being among white
men, by gestures and other signs of approval. The schooner set sail
for Somerset, on Cape York, which in those days was the
headquarters of the Torres Strait pearling fleet. As the little
vessel made her way northward along the coast, the strange white
man began to speak, and to eat his food like a Christian, losing
his fear.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 301</p>-->

<p>A fortnight later he was able to tell his rescuers that his name
was Narcisse Pellatier, that he was a Frenchman, and had been
seventeen years living among the blacks. Pellatier, after his
return to France, published a little book of his adventures, which
seems to have gone out of print, and is now quite forgotten.</p>

<p>The ship <i>Charles Eaton</i> left Sydney in 1834, bound to
Singapore. She struck a rock in Torres Straits, in the month of
August, and the ship's complement, consisting of twenty-six men and
six passengers, were compelled to take to the boats. Although there
was no need for haste, the crew made a rush, and after swamping one
boat, made off with the other. There were only five men in her, and
they safely reached Timor. There remained on the wreck the captain,
the surgeon, Captain D'Oyly of the Bengal Artillery, Mrs D'Oyly,
two children and an ayah, the mate, and several seamen. These
people set about building a raft, and when it was finished, all but
the mate and the seamen pushed off from the wreck, leaving those on
board to complete a second raft and follow.</p>

<p>Nothing more was heard of the <i>Charles Eaton</i> or her people
until the New South Wales Government schooner <i>Isabella</i>, sent
in search of them, found two survivors in July 1836. This was their
story: A cabin boy named John Ireland was among those of the second
raft party; he related how, when the first raft was out of sight,
the second was launched, and after two days and nights upon it, in
which the people were up to their middles in water, and without
food, they fell in with a canoe containing ten natives. These
people, by signs, invited the white men to leave their raft for the
canoe, and this they did, and were presently landed upon a small
island, afterwards discovered to be Boydan, not far from Cape
Camisade on the Queensland coast. The exhausted castaways were just
able to crawl on shore, then as soon as they were landed, the
savages set upon them and clubbed them all to death, except
Ireland, who, for some unaccountable reason, was spared. A few days
later the savages re-embarked in their canoe, taking Ireland with
them. Presently they landed upon another island nearer to New
Guinea, where Ireland saw one of Captain D'Oyly's children. This
little fellow was just old enough to comprehend, and to explain
what had happened to the party on the first raft. The child was the
only survivor. The blacks were not cannibals, they seemed to kill
for the mere lust of blood.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 302</p>-->

<p>The two white boys remained with the natives on this island
about two months, when the savages again took to their canoes and
sailed to the northward. On their way they called at several places
for food; and, at last, at Murray's Island a native bought them
from their captors for some bunches of bananas. This Murray Island
black took the white boys home with him and treated them kindly for
several months; then, when the <i>Isabella</i> was making her
search, he saw her, and putting off in his canoe, restored the
children. The schooner, from the boys' description, was enabled to
find the scenes of the murders of the rest of the <i>Charles
Eaton's</i> people, and there discovered the bleached bones of the
victims, brought them to Sydney, and they were interred in what is
now an old disused graveyard.</p>

<p>A similarly horrible affair was that of the <i>Stirling
Castle</i>, wrecked, in 1836, in Torres Straits. The survivors of
that wreck were nearly six months among the blacks. Seven persons
were recovered out of eighteen who got ashore from the wreck, and
the tortures and deaths of the castaways is one of the most
heartrending chapters in the story of the South Seas.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 303</p>-->

<p>Mrs Fraser, the wife of the captain, was compelled by the blacks
to climb trees for honey, the blacks forcing her to do this by
applying fire-sticks to her person. She had witnessed her husband
beaten to death because he was too exhausted to drag great branches
of trees to which the blacks had harnessed him. One of the crew
during their captivity managed to escape, and by singular good
fortune to make his way to what was then the small penal settlement
at Moreton Bay, and is now the Queensland capital, Brisbane. He
brought help, and by good management and bribes, Mrs Fraser, the
second mate, and five seamen were rescued from the blacks.
Lieutenant Otter, who effected the rescue of Mrs Fraser, said: "The
woman was a skeleton, the skin literally hanging upon her bones,
whilst her legs were a mass of sores, where the savages had
tortured her with firebrands. Notwithstanding her miserable plight,
it was absolutely necessary for us to start homewards, though she
had already come nine or ten miles, as there were about 300 natives
in the camp, who would most likely attack us in the night, for many
of them had been unwilling to give her up. Graham, our guide, had
fortunately met with one of his former friends, a kind of chief,
through whose influence he had succeeded. So treacherous are the
natives that it is impossible to trust one of them for a moment.
When we met her she had been two days without food, and had
subsisted the most part of the time on a kind of fern root which is
found in the swamps. Now and then she would get the tail or fin of
a fish, when the savages had a superabundance, and this she was
obliged to earn by dragging heavy logs of wood and fetching water.
She was not allowed to enter their huts; but, naked as she was, she
was obliged to lie out the whole night, even in the heaviest rains.
This is but a slight sketch of what she went through. When we had
got about half-way to our boats, we were obliged to carry her in
turn. We did not arrive until next morning, when she begged for hot
water, as she was anxious to restore her face and person to their
natural colour. The natives, in order to bring her as near as
possible to their own complexion, had rubbed her skin every day
with charcoal."</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 304</p>-->

<p>In 1823 four men in a little cutter left Sydney for Illawarra,
fifty miles to the southward, to load cedar. When within sight of
their destination they were caught by a heavy gale and driven to
sea. They had no knowledge of navigation, and not even a compass,
so that when the weather moderated they had not the least idea of
their position; and the only man with any sea experience, after the
boat had been drifting for a week, through drinking salt water,
died, raving, in a few hours. For twenty-one days they drifted,
living on a few biscuits and such water as they could collect from
the rain, which fortunately fell pretty frequently after the first
week. At last land was seen, and the men succeeded in making it,
landing, and abandoning their cutter. Seven months later the
Government cutter <i>Mermaid</i> put into Moreton Bay, and found
two of the three men on an island living with the blacks, who had
treated them kindly. The third man was away on a hunting
expedition, but a bottle was left with a message informing him that
he would be called for later, but it was not until September 1824
that he was rescued; so remote was the place at this time.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 305</p>-->

<p>The barque <i>Peruvian</i> was, in 1846, wrecked near Cape
Cleveland on the North Queensland coast, and many of her people,
including some women and children, drifted about on a raft for six
weeks, until all but four perished, when they were washed upon the
coast. The survivors were the master of the vessel and his wife, a
boy, and a seamen named Murrel. They fell in with blacks, who
treated them kindly, but in two years all died but Murrel.
Seventeen years later, in January 1863, an Australian stock-keeper,
sitting in his hut, on an outback station on the Burdekin river,
near where there is now a railway bridge, was startled by the
sudden appearance of a man whom he took to be a black. The stockman
levelled his gun to shoot&mdash;in those days men fired first and
challenged afterwards. "Don't shoot, I'm a British object"
(<i>sic</i>), said the man. It was Murrel, who afterwards became a
customs officer, and whose descendants still own valuable country
in the vicinity.</p>

<p>In the Islands of Bass Straits, and off the main continent, the
sealers earned for themselves a reputation more evil than that of
the buccaneers of the West Indies. Convicts on ticket-of-leave, and
deserters and bolters, went sealing. Soon the Americans, getting
wind of the seal fisheries, sent vessels cruising in these waters,
and more than one French vessel attempted to cut in, but was driven
out by the local vested interests. The sealers, as sealers, were
harmless enough, but they did not stop at sealing. It was not safe
for a small vessel to cruise in the vicinity of outlying islands,
for the outlaws upon them cut off cutters and schooners at every
opportunity, thus making good their escape from the penal
settlements, landing either upon the Islands of Polynesia, or even
making the South American coast. This was not all; the women
belonging to the now extinct tribes of Tasmanian blacks were
kidnapped, and every sealer had his native wife. This state of
affairs lasted down to the forties. At Preservation Island, in
1841, Captain Stokes of the <i>Beagle</i> met James Munro, "King of
the Eastern Straitsmen," who had been a sealer for twenty-three
years, and had three wives and a dozen half-caste children.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 306</p>-->

<p>On Kangaroo Island, down to the twenties, there was a regular
nest of pirates, most of them escaped prisoners. This gang had for
a leader a scoundrel named Williams. One of the gang, named
Antonio, got drunk and boasted to the crew of a passing vessel of
the exploits of himself and his companions. A few weeks later this
man was employed by Williams to obtain seal-skins by being lowered
from a high cliff. After Antonio had been at work several hours
sending up skins, the time came for him to be hauled up by the
rope. When he was swinging a hundred feet in the air, Williams
leant over the cliff, and reminding him that he was a fellow who
could not keep his tongue quiet, coolly severed the rope, and
Antonio was dashed to pieces on the rocks below. Williams and part
of his gang ultimately built a schooner, in which they left the
island and were never afterwards heard of.</p>

<p>Not thirty years ago the brig <i>Maria</i> sailed from Sydney in
most remarkable circumstances. A party of young men, seduced by
exaggerated stories of gold to be found in New Guinea, formed
themselves into a company, and purchased an unseaworthy old vessel
lying in Sydney harbour. The party consisted of seventy-five
persons of all classes of society, and each subscribed £10 to the
undertaking.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 307</p>-->

<p>They elected a captain on the "one man one vote" principle, and
the brig sailed in January 1872. This captain had absolutely no
knowledge of navigation, there was no chart of the Barrier Reef on
board the ship, and no nautical instruments. The idea was to steer
north and reach New Guinea somehow. In due course the vessel struck
on Bramble Reef, thirty miles east of the then new settlement at
Cardwell, and twenty miles from Hinchinbrook Island&mdash;the
Hinchinbrook Channel is one of the show places now on the
Queensland coast, and the tourist in a fine intercolonial steamer,
if he should decide to go north, will be shown the spot.</p>

<p>When the brig struck, the elected captain got out the best boat
and announced his intention of going for help. He took six seamen
with him and made the mainland, where a party of blacks attacked
him and killed him and three of his men, wounding the other three,
who, however, managed to escape, and reached Cardwell a week later.
At Cardwell, Mr Sabben, a midshipman belonging to H.M.S.
<i>Basilisk</i>, with eight blue-jackets, happened to be on board
of a captured South Sea slaver, and he made a brave attempt to
rescue the remainder of the party, while information of the
disaster was sent in all directions. Meanwhile the people on the
brig, by the aid of rafts and the remaining boat, got on shore, all
but nine, who were drowned in making the land. When in due course
the rescuing parties reached the scene they found a few survivors;
some had been murdered by the blacks, some had gone mad from thirst
and exposure, and, strange to relate, some had fallen in with
blacks who had treated them kindly. Within a space of half-a-dozen
miles the savages in one place had clubbed to death, and, it is
believed, eaten fourteen persons, and in another had fed and
treated with the greatest kindness the other castaways. The total
number of the survivors of the seventy-five persons who went out in
the brig was forty&mdash;twelve were drowned on the wreck, fourteen
killed by blacks, and nine were drowned off the rafts.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 308</p>-->

<p>On March 11, 1887, the <i>Tamaris</i> of Bordeaux, bound to
Noumea, ran on Penguin Island, one of the Crozets. The thirteen men
of the crew managed in their boats to land safely upon another
island of the group. They were then well off, for H.M.S.
<i>Conus</i>, in 1880, had left upon Hog Island, in a hut built for
the purpose, a stock of tinned provisions. On September 22 an
albatross was picked up on the beach near Fremantle, West
Australia. Scratched upon a piece of tin hung round its neck were
these words: "Thirteen shipwrecked Frenchmen are refugees on the
Crozets, August 4." In consequence of this message a French war
vessel went to the Crozets to rescue the men. In the shelter hut on
Hog Island the captain of the French ship found a letter written by
the captain of the <i>Tamarus</i>, giving particulars of the wreck,
and stating that, after seven months of waiting, they had consumed
what little food had been saved from the wreck and most of the
tinned provisions left by the <i>Comus</i>; they had therefore
determined to leave in their boat for Possession Island, where they
thought they could find food enough until they were rescued by a
passing vessel. The French searching ship then proceeded to
Possession Island, and there found that the shelter hut had never
been occupied; the food left by the <i>Comus</i> was untouched, the
castaways had evidently not reached the place, and must have been
wrecked again on the passage, for they were never afterwards heard
of.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 309</p>-->

<p>The schooner <i>Bobtail Nag</i>, in 1875, when off the Island of
Malayta, succeeded by means of bribes in inducing the savages to
give up a white man who had been living among them for seven years.
In the year 1868, at St Francisco, John Renton, a native of
Stromness, nineteen years of age, ran away from the vessel in which
he had shipped as cabin boy; a couple of days later he was
hocussed, put on board the <i>Renard</i> of Boston, and knew
nothing of what had happened until he was well clear of the land,
bound to M'Kean's Island for guano. On the voyage the ship called
at the Sandwich group to refresh, and there, owing to the
ill-treatment of the ship's company, and the persuasive influence
of an old sailor known as "Boston Ned," certain of the crew
determined to desert. The conspirators, numbering altogether five
persons, secretly stocked a small whale-boat, that was hanging by
her painter to the stern of the vessel as she lay at anchor, with
some provisions and water, but at the last moment were unable to
secure a compass. Then in the dead of night they embarked in the
boat and cut adrift, intending to make an island some distance from
the one off which their ship was lying. By dawn, however, they had
lost sight of land; it fell dead calm, and they could make no
headway; soon they lost all idea of their position, and thus they
drifted.</p>

<p>At the expiration of ten days they were still out of sight of
land, their food was nearly all gone, and they were beginning to
despair. Five days more elapsed, then it came on to blow a gale,
the little boat flew before a mountainous sea, every soul in her
expecting the next moment would be his last. For a whole day and
night "Boston Ned," lashed to the steer oar, kept his post, and
while the other men baled, steered the boat with a skill only to be
acquired by a man who has served an apprenticeship in a whaler.
Then fine weather came, and the men had time to realise that they
had eaten their last crumb and drunk their last mouthful of
water.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 310</p>-->

<p>Three more days and nights passed like this, then young Renton
saw "Boston Ned" whispering in the ear of another sailor, looking
curiously at him the while. Ned produced a sheath knife and began
testing its edge. Renton for a whole day and night kept awake,
never taking his eyes from "Boston Ned," and crouching in the bows
of the boat, as far as possible from the steersman. Then early one
morning the youngster caught sight of a shark; it followed the boat
as if waiting&mdash;a horrible suggestion to its occupants; then
Renton was struck with an idea, and he whispered it hurriedly to
"Boston Ned."</p>

<p>They had fortunately a harpoon in the boat, and Ned, with this
attached to the painter, stood ready to strike when the shark could
be induced to come close enough. Renton now stripped, and lying
along the gunwhale of the boat, put one leg over the side, trailing
it in the water. The shark presently caught sight of the bate,
hesitated once or twice, then darted for it. Renton withdrew his
leg just in time, and Ned launched the harpoon. The shark was
caught, and the food supply renewed; the same night rain fell, and
they got fresh water enough to fill the breaker. But their
sufferings were not yet ended, and the shark's flesh became too
putrid even for starving men to eat. On the thirty-fourth day from
leaving the ship they sighted land, and twenty-four hours later ran
their boat into a little harbour, where they were instantly
surrounded by savages, who, seeing them unable to walk, carried
them ashore and treated them with great kindness. Ultimately,
however, Renton's four companions were killed, but Renton having a
powerful friend in a young chief, was spared and rescued by the
<i>Bobtail Nag</i>.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 311</p>-->

<p>This story of the Auckland Islands is only one of many that
could be told of that desolate group of rocks nearly two hundred
miles south of New Zealand. The schooner <i>Grafton</i>, in 1864,
drove ashore there, and the crew narrowly escaped with their lives.
The crew numbered five persons&mdash;the master, Musgrave, the
mate, Racqual, a Frenchman, and three seamen. They got on shore all
the provisions, some old sails, and a battered boat from the wreck.
A few herbs grew on the rocks, and with these and the flesh of
seals they were compelled to sustain life for many months, for the
stock of provisions on the schooner was very small, and it was
eighteen months before they were rescued. After being more than a
year on the island, Racqual undertook to build a boat from the
remains of the wreck and the frame of the schooner's dingey. They
took six months at the work, Musgrave the while keeping a journal
written in blood&mdash;his substitute for ink. Although it was calm
when she was launched she nearly capsized, she was so frail and
tender in the water. After some patching, Musgrave, Racqual, and
one seaman ventured to put to sea in her, the others remaining
behind in the hope that their comrades would reach Stewart Island,
the nearest land, and send succour.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 312</p>-->

<p>After five days at sea, Musgrave and his companions succeeded in
making Port Adventure, and from there obtained help and returned
for the other two men. These were brought off, and all landed
safely in New Zealand.</p>

<p>While the Grafton was ashore on one island of this group, the
<i>Invercauld</i> was ashore on another. Nineteen persons belonging
to this vessel succeeded in getting a footing on the desolate
rocks, where they remained for fourteen weeks before the survivors,
three men, were taken off by a passing vessel. The limpets on the
rocks, stray roots, and two seals was all the food the
<i>Invercauld's</i> crew could succeed in finding. Everything in
the ship had gone down with the wreck. It is singular that during
the time both crews were castaways on this group, they saw nothing
and knew nothing of each other being there. The schooner sent to
the rescue of the <i>Grafton's</i> crew, the <i>Flying Scud</i>,
while she was in the group, came across the skeleton of a man,
evidently one of the <i>Invercauld's</i> crew, who had wandered
from his fellows, and had fallen, exhausted, to die on the rocks,
but there was nothing by which he could be identified.</p>

<p>The American ship <i>General Grant</i> was wrecked among this
group, in May 1866, on a voyage from Melbourne to England, carrying
many diggers as passengers, and many thousands of pounds in gold.
The ship went ashore in the middle of the night on one of the small
islets, and in a most extraordinary manner was driven by the sea
into a kind of cavern in the rocks. Of the eighty-three souls on
board, only fifteen, among them one woman, managed, by the aid of
the boats, to make a landing on Disappointment Island. James Tier,
one of the passengers, during the trying time between the
occurrence of the disaster and the eighteen months that elapsed
before the ten unfortunate castaways who survived were rescued,
showed the courage and resourcefulness of a great leader.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 313</p>-->

<p>The captain and many of the crew had ascended the rigging of the
ship when she ran into the awful opening in the rocks. Tier,
meanwhile, succeeded with the aid of others in getting out a boat,
and as this boat with the survivors pulled past the mouth of the
cavern, they saw the ship with all who had remained on board go to
the bottom. Four men, about eight months after the wreck occurred,
fitted up the boat and sailed away in an endeavour to bring help.
They were never afterwards heard of In November 1867 a whaling brig
happened to touch at the island, and a boat's crew from her came
across Tier and his party. They were clothed in sealskins, and were
in such a condition that the captain of the whaler believed them to
be mad, and was at first frightened to take them on board. But one
of the crew of the ship happening to recognise Tier, the castaways
were ultimately embarked, treated with every kindness, and landed
at Melbourne. Tier spent the remainder of his life in Australia,
organising many expeditions to attempt the recovery of the gold
from the sunken wreck, but nothing came of these ventures, and
Tier, about ten years ago, just as he had completed a plan to make
one more venture, was one morning found dead in his bed. An
American expedition was, some months ago, reported as about to
attempt the recovery of the gold.</p>

<p>Tier thus describes how the ship, after she struck, was sucked
into the cave:&mdash;</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 314</p>-->

<p class="newspaper">"In the darkness we saw nothing save the dark
mass above and around us. Lamps were held over the side, as the
ship was lying very easily; we could then see the overhanging
rocks, and no place where a bird could rest upon them. Soundings
were taken, and there were 25 fathoms under her stern, but she kept
working into the cave. The boats were thought of, but the captain
thought it best to wait for daylight, as great lumps of rock were
falling in all directions. As the ship was carried in, she caught
the overhanging rocks with her fore-royal mast, and carried it
away, then the other masts followed. At last daylight came, and
with great difficulty I and some others managed to get away with
one boat, launched over the stern by means of a projecting spar,
rigged for the purpose, for there was no room between the ship's
side and the walls of the cave, which appeared to be about 400 ft.
high, and overhanging."</p>

<p>The story of Benjamin Boyd, who sailed the schooner yacht
<i>Wanderer</i> under the flag of the Royal Yacht Squadron to New
South Wales, is curious. Boyd came out to Sydney in 1841 in
connection with some important banking business, and purchased a
great quantity of land in more than one of the Australian Colonies,
speculating largely in the South Sea trade. He owned many whale
ships, and was the first man to introduce the South Sea Islander,
or Kanaka, to the Australian labour market; he was also the first
to import camels for crossing the dry country with supplies for his
outlying stations. His speculations at length grew to such a scale,
including the building of a town and making of a harbour, Boydtown,
on the south-western coast of New Wales, for his whalers, that the
shareholders in the great financial concerns, in which he was the
chief manipulator, disagreed with him, and he resigned from the
concerns, setting sail in the <i>Wanderer</i> for the new gold
diggings in California in 1850. A year of this life was enough for
him, and he sailed for Sydney, calling at Guadalcanar, in the
Solomon Islands, on the way. Boyd went ashore in the yacht's boat,
sculled by a Kanaka, was attacked by the natives and killed, the
yacht and those who remained on board being attacked by savages in
canoes, and only beating them off after a desperate engagement.
After an unsuccessful endeavour to recover Boyd's remains, the
yacht sailed, and was wrecked coming up the New South Wales coast,
only a few of her company escaping to tell their story.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 315</p>-->

<p>Christian and his companions in the <i>Bounty</i> are sometimes
said to have been incited to mutiny by the beauty of the Tahitian
women, but in more than one instance where sailors have lost their
ships in the South Seas, a white woman has been the cause of the
mischief. Early in the century, a brig owned by Mr Kerr, American
Consul at Manila, and commanded by a man named Melton, was
despatched with a cargo to Batavia, with orders to bring back goods
from that port suitable for disposal at the Philippines. Melton was
provided with a letter of credit entitling him to draw against a
Batavian house for £4000. On arriving at his port. Melton, having
sold his cargo and cashed his letter of credit, sold the brig and
purchased a ship called the <i>Duke of Portland</i>, and sailed, as
he wrote to Kerr, for the South American coast, stating in his
letter not to expect him for some time, as he had gone on a good
trading expedition. The letter of credit was duly presented and
taken up by Kerr, who was much respected at Manila. Meanwhile
Melton got a charter from the Dutch Company at Batavia to carry
rice to one of the islands in the Dutch Archipelago, but instead of
carrying out his charter, he sailed to the Mauritius and there sold
the cargo; whence he took the ship to Cape Town, and there embarked
a woman named Elizabeth Morey. He then sailed, intending to make
Lima, there sell the ship, and settle in South America; but, on the
voyage, he called at the Friendly Islands. At Tonga the ship was
boarded by large numbers of natives, and among them was an Irishman
named Doyle, a castaway who had been wrecked a year or two
previously, and had become a sort of chief; and also a Malay
calling himself Charley. At a signal given by these two scoundrels,
the natives suddenly attacked the crew of the <i>Duke of
Portland</i>, and murdered nearly all hands, including the master,
and carrying off the woman, who was three years kept prisoner.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 316</p>-->

<p>In 1804 the American ship <i>Union</i> was off the island, when
Doyle and the Malay boarded her and induced her crew to lower boats
and land. The woman Morey was put in a canoe and ordered to assure
the strangers of the friendly intentions of the natives. She went
off to the ship, and was at first too well watched to do other than
she was ordered, and in consequence some of the <i>Union's</i>
people landed and were murdered. A second trip was made to the ship
to induce others to come; then Morey sprang out of the canoe and
swam to the ship, crying out to the people on board for help, and
telling them the truth. The woman was taken on board just in time
to save her life, and the <i>Union's</i> anchor being apeak, and
her topsails hoisted, the remainder of the crew managed with their
firearms to drive off the canoes and get the ship to sea, and in
due course she arrived in Sydney.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 317</p>-->

<p>The crimes of the Kanaka slave trade&mdash;"black-birding" was
the slang word for it&mdash;are quite equal in their atrocity to
anything that is recorded in the stories of the "Middle Passage."
In the forties, two British owned vessels, because the natives of
one of the Pacific Islands objected to them cutting wood, shot a
score or more of the islanders, and driving a number of others into
a cave, filled it with wood and burnt the natives alive. The murder
of Bishop Patterson in the Swallow Isles, Santa Cruz group, in
1871, is attributed to the exasperation of the islanders by some
outrage committed by a labour vessel that had called there a short
time previously. Kidnappers have been known to land disguised as
missionaries; and it is a fact that native chiefs have contracted
to supply skippers of traders with human heads, these being at one
time of commercial value in the South Seas; so many heads from one
group sold at another group would purchase so many Kanakas. The
"Carl" atrocities took place so late as 1871. The chief scoundrel
in that horrible series of murders was permitted to turn Queen's
evidence, and from his own words, as reported at the trial of his
accomplices, natives were kidnapped in the New Hebrides group in
the following manner: The brig was hove to off an island, her boats
were lowered, and the natives were encouraged to come off in their
canoes. Then pig-iron was dropped into the boats, and the natives,
as they struck out to clear themselves of their sinking canoes,
were stunned by the men in the Carl's boat and hauled out of the
water as fast as possible. After this had gone on for some time at
various islands, the ship's hold was filled with slaves, and one
night, while at sea, the poor creatures made an attempt to break
out and gain the deck. Then the Carl's crew, led by one Dr James
Patrick Murray, part owner of the vessel, and, later on, "Queen's"
witness, opened fire with revolvers and rifles on the people below.
Fifty were killed, and about sixteen badly wounded.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 318</p>-->

<p>The vessel was at this time out of sight of land, but killed and
wounded alike were hoisted up from below and thrown overboard. Some
of the wounded, when they were thrown overboard, were still tied by
the legs and hands, as they had been deposited in the hold, and it
was sworn at the trial that Dr Murray sat on the coambing of the
hatchway and sang, "Marching through Georgia," while he emptied his
revolvers on the islanders below. Two men were convicted and
sentenced to death for the crimes, but the sentence was afterwards
commuted to penal servitude for life; others of the crew got off
with two years, two others were acquitted on a legal technicality,
and Murray, by turning informer, entirely escaped punishment.</p>

<p>Labour vessels still import Kanakas to Queensland, but under
regulations and Government supervision, so that the public, when
objection is offered, are assured that it is impossible that the
Kanakas can suffer any injustice; it is, however, well to remember
that the Carl atrocities occurred not thirty years ago, and a
man-o'-war fell in with that slaver a few hours after the murders,
and could find nothing wrong on board, so beautifully regular and
innocent did everything appear.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 319</p>-->

<p>More than enough has been written of missionary work in the
South Seas. That it has been a strong civilising influence in the
islands, as elsewhere, there can be no doubt; it is equally certain
that in a few generations the missionary business of the present
century will be ranked with the Tulip Mania, the South Sea Bubble,
and other popular delusions; and our descendants will read with
amazement of that amiable public who subscribed its thousands for
mission steam yachts and similar agreeable enterprises for the
benefit of the well-fed savages in the Pacific, while hundreds of
men, women, and children, their winter shelter the dry arches of
Thames bridges, year in year out, starved in the sight of their
fellow Christians.</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII. ON OUR COAST.</h2>

<h3>The Lifeboat&mdash;The Lighthouse&mdash;Coasting
Seamen&mdash;Smugglers and Wreckers&mdash;Yachts and
Fishermen&mdash;Lloyd's and Insurance Frauds.</h3>

<p>In the seventies of last century, a young man named Henry
Greathead, belonging to Shields, having completed his
apprenticeship to a boatbuilder, was "bitten with the sea fever,"
so shipped himself as carpenter on a vessel supposed to be bound
for the West Indies. But the master of this ship had quite another
object than honest trading in view. His design was to put the
vessel ashore in some place where the boat could comfortably land
the crew; then report the loss of the vessel, and secure as reward
some portion of the fraudulently obtained insurance money. The
master and crew could not agree on the means to attain this end,
with the result that the crime was bungled, the ship was stranded
on the French coast, and her people were taken prisoners by the
French. The captain made out a claim on behalf of the owners for
the insurance money, and he asked the crew to sign the document.
Greathead objected, and so influenced the crew that they also
refused to do so; further, Greathead wrote to Lloyd's, and told the
underwriters the whole circumstances of the attempt to defraud
them.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 321</p>-->

<p>The French people, hearing of all this business, for the
correspondence had to pass through the hands of the military
authorities, kept the master of the ship prisoner, but sent
Greathead home to England with a message to the effect that he was
an honest fellow, who deserved better than to be kept in Calais
town jail.</p>

<p>Greathead, on his arrival at Portsmouth, heard that the
pressgang was capturing every seafaring man entering the port; so
to escape the press, he shipped immediately on board a vessel bound
to the West Indies. This ship on her way out was captured by an
American privateer, and Greathead was offered rank and pay to join
the "rebels," but refused, and was exchanged with others for some
American prisoners. Landing in New York, before he had time to
leave the wharf, he was impressed on an English sloop of war, and
remained in the service until 1784, when he returned to Shields,
married, settled down as a boatbuilder, and invented, or rather
perfected a lifeboat, launching her in 1789. The original patentee
of the lifeboat was Lionel Lukin, a London coachbuilder, who was
granted his patent in 1785; but Greathead's boat was, to a large
extent, original in design, the principal feature being the
curvature of the keel, which Greathead devised after a long series
of experiments.</p>

<p>Greathead was a poor man, and, in 1801, he petitioned the House
of Commons for a grant, and his petition was backed by many
philanthropists who were anxious to obtain funds to build more
boats. They had good reason to believe in the boat, for, by 1801,
she had saved between four hundred and five hundred lives; but the
House of Commons said that it was a work that should be left to
private enterprise, and having taken a lot of evidence before a
Select Committee, got rid of Greathead by making him a grant of
£1200.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 322</p>-->

<p>Meanwhile, the public spirit of some leading citizens had set on
foot a movement to supply funds. The committee of Lloyd's
remembered that this Greathead was the man who, a few years before,
had written to them, exposing an attempt to obtain insurance money
fraudulently, and certain of the underwriters thereupon "took up"
the man and backed him with money and influence, as also did the
Trinity House. The Duke of Northumberland, before this time, had
supplied the money for the first boat, named after him, and
stationed at North Shields. This boat was 30 ft. long by 10 ft.
broad, pulled ten oars, double-banked, and was whaleboat shaped,
much the same in appearance as the present ordinary lifeboats. By
1803 Greathead had built thirty boats, and he, giving evidence
before the Select Committee, said that the profit made by him was
from £10 to £15 on each boat, and the cost of the largest boats
£165.</p>

<p>From this beginning sprang the Royal National Lifeboat
Institution, founded in 1824, whose honourable boast it is to-day,
that it is supported entirely by voluntary contributions. Its
revenue averages £80,000 a year, spent in keeping up about three
hundred lifeboat stations on the coasts of the United Kingdom. The
average cost of each boat is £1000, and its yearly expense £100. On
the coasts of most of our colonies there are boats maintained at
the public expense, and abroad, early in the century, Greathead
built many lifeboats to the order of foreign governments. The boat
dependent on oars developed into the larger sailing boat; then, in
1894, steam was tried, and there are now several steam lifeboats in
use.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 323</p>-->

<p>There is no end to the list of inventions, some admirable, some
possible of development into useful purposes, and many silly, that
have been brought before the public to save shipwrecked persons.
Breakwaters, lifeboats, lifebelts, and the rocket apparatus are the
most practical, and these have been developed more than others
during the century. Watertight compartments on shipboard, when they
act, which is nearly as often as when they do not, are likely to
save vessels from disaster by collision. The only useful watertight
compartments are permanent ones. A ship should be built with
compartments that cannot be opened by the crew&mdash;water-tight
doors cannot be depended upon&mdash;and so-called compartments, in
some ships, are too frequently used for storage or cargo
purposes.</p>

<p>Breakwaters, during the century, have in many cases converted
dangerous seaports into safe harbours of refuge&mdash;that of
Plymouth, begun in 1812, took more than a quarter of a century to
build, and now, to keep it in order 25,000 tons of masonry every
year are required. Convicts began the Portland breakwater in 1849,
and completed it in 1872, and similar work is now being carried out
at other ports.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 324</p>-->

<p>In like fashion to the growth of the lifeboat service, the
rocket apparatus and similar devices have been improved, and are
now in very general use on most civilised coasts; from Captain
Manby's mortar, whence a ball carrying a line attached was fired,
we have D'Arcy Irvine's shoulder-line-throwing gun, worked on the
same principle, the object being to establish communication with a
vessel ashore by means of a small line&mdash;an object too often
defeated, even when the line is fired over the ship, by the
stupidity, ignorance, or want of nerve of the men on board, who,
though supposed to be well acquainted with the working of the
apparatus, have, in very many instances, never in their lives seen
one.</p>

<p>A good deal of the coast life can be seen from the tower of a
lighthouse or the deck of a light-vessel. During some months spent
in the Trinity House service, I saw something of the hardships, not
to speak of the danger incurred in the lifeboat service. A vessel
was ashore on the Maplin Sands in a January gale, when, though
within sight of the mouth of the Thames, there was a sea running
that the oldest seamen on the light-vessel on which I was declared
no lifeboat could live in. But the lifeboat came out, and, after
many hours of terribly hard work, saved all the shipwrecked crew.
Nearly all the lifeboat crew when they returned were carried out of
their boat frost-bitten, and that severely!</p>

<p>The coxswain of this boat was Robert Legerton, who died in 1892.
He was originally a Deal boatman&mdash;perhaps the finest of our
boat sailors&mdash;and his record of fourteen years in charge of
the Clacton-on-Sea lifeboat was: "saved 216 lives and 14 ships."
Even that record is beaten by Mr C. Fish, late of the Ramsgate
lifeboat, who, during twenty-six years' service, put out 591 times
and saved 877 lives.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 325</p>-->

<p>"Putting out" on our coast in a boat, even in a life-boat, in
bad weather, is a test of seamanship that few deep-water sailors
would survive. I have seen men who have never been seasick,
downright ill on board a light-vessel, through the terrific
pitching and tossing of her, as she strained at the end of a couple
of enormous cables, with four hundred and odd fathoms of chain and
two mushroom anchors keeping her on her station.</p>

<p>There is a story of an American schooner that was such a good
sea-boat that one night she capsized and turned completely over,
coming up the other side without wetting anybody, and not a man on
board would have known what had happened if it had not been that
the clews of the sailors' hammocks had a round turn in them! Such
an accident as this only happens in American waters; but from
personal experience I can vouch for it that a light-vessel, not far
from the Thames' mouth, will roll a half-filled can empty, and will
lie at such an angle that men can only walk on all fours on her
decks, or she will pitch so violently that a kettle will literally
jump off the galley stove.</p>

<p>Lighthouses, light-vessels, buoys, and all the rest of the
"finger posts" of our coast, have grown with the century, from the
fire <i>chauffer</i>, to the electric flash, visible thirty miles
distant; from the primitive blaze of a bucket full of coals, extant
down to the twenties, to the present-day lighthouses, that have
sometimes cost £100,000 to erect. There are about three hundred and
sixty light-houses on the coasts of the United Kingdom and Ireland,
the oldest of them, the Eddystone, dating from Winstanley's wooden
tower of 1699&mdash;though this was not a true lighthouse, as we
understand the word now&mdash;until Smeaton completed his tower of
1759, which lasted till replaced in 1882. Smeaton's structure was
not then worn out, but the rock on which it was built had been
undermined by the waves. From half-a-dozen lights at the beginning
of the century we have about seventy now, and the oldest of them is
the Nore, dating from 1732.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 326</p>-->

<p>The history of the lighthouse and the stories of
lighthouse-keepers have been too often told to bear
re-telling&mdash;every schoolboy remembers who Grace Darling was,
and what she did; but a word on the excellence of the present
Trinity House Service. Early in the century old men, incapable of
doing anything else, were usually given charge of such poor lights
as then existed&mdash;a system still pursued in many parts of the
world, where old sailors are provided for in this fashion, living
with their families in houses adjacent to the light-towers. In
England the Trinity House erects beacons and lighthouses, and
maintains them, and buoys all channels and rivers, subject to
certain exceptions in harbours and rivers controlled by local
authorities, and besides these duties the corporation examines and
licenses pilots, and controls many kindred matters relating to
shipping, including the duty of piloting the Queen whenever she
makes a sea voyage. In Scotland and in Ireland, there are boards
having charge of these affairs, but the Trinity House has much to
say in advising and regulating lights in all parts of the British
Dominions, and the advice and assistance of the corporation is
often sought by foreign Governments.</p>

<p>The Trinity House divides the English coasts into districts;
each district is in charge of a superintendent, who has under him a
staff of light-keepers, light-vessel crews, crews of tenders, fog
signalmen, and others. The principal district is the Thames,
extending from Harwich on the north, to Ramsgate on the south, the
head-quarters of the station and of the working service being at
Blackwall, while the head-quarters of the corporation at Trinity
House, Tower Hill, is almost as well known as the Tower itself.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 327</p>-->

<p>The men of the service are all now properly graded, entering the
lighthouse or light-vessel service as young men in the capacity of
assistant lighthouse-keepers, or as able seamen of light-vessels,
and gradually learning their business, until they are too old to
work, when they are pensioned. They serve regular periods of two
months on duty at the lights, and one month on shore, working on
the Trinity House wharves. At a few of the shore lighthouses, the
men are permanently quartered with their families in houses near
the light-towers, but in most cases the light-keepers serve, as do
seamen in light-vessels, in regular terms, two men on duty at a
time and one on shore; in the more isolated lighthouses three
keepers on duty are considered necessary. A light-vessel's crew, as
a rule, consists of a master and a mate, on duty alternate months,
three light-keepers, and six or seven seamen, of whom two
light-keepers and four or five seamen are always on board the ship.
On board a floating light the duty of a crew includes keeping a
look-out for vessels running into danger, and warning them off by
firing signals, communicating with shore life-saving stations by
means of rockets and signal guns, and, thanks to wireless
telegraphy, also, now, in some cases, by telegraph; and, of course,
the chief duty of looking after the lantern.</p>

<p>To keep the light trimmed, and, if it is of the revolving
description, regularly to wind the clockwork of the revolving
apparatus, needs, at night, constant and intelligent attention, and
when there is a fog, the crew of the light-vessel have plenty to
keep them employed in sounding fog signals.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 328</p>-->

<p>Sometimes the fog-horn is a syren driven by a hot-air engine, an
apparatus that sends forth such horrible noises that, while it is
going, men on board can never sleep, no matter how long they have
been familiar with it; at other times the fog signal is merely a
big gong sounded by one of the crew, who, perched on the bridge
where it is hung, during the fog, continually hammers away&mdash;an
antiquated and tedious process, unworthy of this end of the
century.</p>

<p>Not only in the interests of passing vessels, but in that of the
light-ship, is the fog signal important. On several occasions I
have been roused from my sleep by the cry of "all hands on deck,
there is a vessel upon us," a rush from below, half-dressed, to the
boat davits follows, and the crew of the light-ship are just in
time to see through the gloom of the fog the outline of the hull,
and hear the thrash of the propeller, of some steamer that has thus
shaved past their floating home.</p>

<p>Trimming the light, regulating the ventilation of the lantern,
and cleaning its glass windows, is a difficult job in bad weather,
when you have to keep your footing on the rigging of the lantern
mast, and use both hands to cut wicks, holding the lantern door
open the fewest possible inches the while, and taking very
particular care that you do not stop the revolution. There is
always danger of your light blowing out, and pilots are, properly,
ever ready to report at head-quarters that the <i>Mouse</i>, or the
<i>Gunfleet</i>, or the <i>Nore</i>, was at such and such a time
stopped for so many seconds, or was showing white instead of red or
green, because the coloured glass door of the lantern was opened
too wide.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 329</p>-->

<p>It is not pleasant either, when it is blowing hard, to hear the
report that the so-and-so mail-boat has run over the so-and-so gas
buoy, and that it is your business to go off and relight it. These
gas buoys are very handy inventions for places where it is not
worth while to put a regular light. A buoy&mdash;a big iron
cylinder&mdash;is so constructed as to contain gas for several
weeks, and has a gas burner giving a fair light, enclosed in a
lantern. The light will serve admirably until, sooner or later, it
is run into by some vessel and damaged, and then it is the business
of the nearest light-vessel to lower a boat and repair damages. For
onlookers there is a good deal of fun to be got out of this job.
First there is a long pull to reach the buoy, then there is the
extreme nicety of management required to keep the boat alongside
the cylinder, which bounds about in the water much as a big rubber
ball bounces on a paving stone; then there is the crowning piece of
fun when a man succeeds in jumping upon the buoy and tries to
balance himself while effecting repairs. Standing on a buoy is just
such a feat as the circus clown performs when he walks on a ball:
when the clown falls off he rolls on the sawdust; when the man
slips or his weight topples the buoy, he goes overboard altogether,
and gets a ducking. A regulation of the Trinity House is that all
servants should insure their lives.</p>

<p>In lighthouses the lights are much more complicated than are
those on light-vessels, and it requires a good mechanic to be chief
light-keeper in charge of the beautiful dioptric lanterns with all
their complicated arrangements of fine lenses and delicate
machinery of burners. Sperm oil was the chief illuminant during the
first half of the century, then came rape oil, and now mineral oil
is almost universal. Gas and electricity are in use, but not to a
large extent. In fogs these lights have no material advantage over
other lights, and the cost of the plant necessary to keep them
going does not justify their general use.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 330</p>-->

<p>The old-fashioned smuggler was old-fashioned fifty years ago.
For stories of smuggling and of wreckers it is necessary to go back
to the close of the last century. Wreckers, during the nineteenth
century, have generally been persons who stole wreckage, but who
were not criminal enough to bring about the disaster by such means
as false lights and similar tricks, for which the Irish and the
Cornish coasts were, perhaps, more notorious than other parts of
the United Kingdom; though, to do justice to the South, the folks
at the back of the Isle of Wight did understand the trick of tying
a lantern to a horse's tail on a stormy night, as can be seen by
the reports of the newspapers a hundred years ago.</p>

<p>But if bringing about a wreck was not a common crime, making the
most of the disaster was never neglected, and even going to the
length of murder in the pursuit of valuable flotsam and jetsam was
by no means infrequent. The century was well into its first
quarter, and a good many rascals were hanged or transported, before
the established custom of plundering first, and rescuing last of
all, was altered for the better.</p>

<p>Wrecking, in the criminal sense, must not be confused with
hovelling, a means of turning an honest penny still pursued upon
our coasts. The hovellers take risks in all sorts of weather, in
all sorts of boats, in a search for what they can legally salve
from wrecks; sometimes sailing so close to the wind as to put the
coastguard into a very suspicious humour with them. Here, for
example, is an instance which occurred at the mouth of the Thames
in 1852, and which is possible now, though not likely to happen in
such crowded waters.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 331</p>-->

<p>The schooner <i>Renown</i> went ashore on the Nore Sand at
midnight on a Saturday in July; the crew landed at Sheerness at 4
A.M. on the Sunday to look for help, and returning in a few hours
to unbend the schooner's sails and remove her stores, found her
surrounded by ten or twelve boats crowded with men, who, under the
plea of rendering help, boarded the schooner as she lay, her deck
just above water. The helpers then set to work, and, taking no heed
of the remonstrances of the schooner's crew, with axes, saws, and
knives, began to cut down spars, rigging, and sails, and even to
saw up what they could reach of the hull. The master of the
schooner then went back to Sheerness and asked for help from the
dockyard, and a small steamer, with a force of blue-jackets and
marines, was sent to protect the wreck. When the Government steamer
arrived on the scene, the wreckers rowed away for the Essex shore,
and were chased, but not caught, by the man-o'-war's men. Then the
Government steamer went back to Sheerness, and, as soon as she was
out of sight, the wreckers returned to their plunder. Later on a
guard-boat was sent down to look after the wreck, but before this
arrived, everything valuable of cargo and gear had been stolen.</p>

<p>The coastguard and revenue cutters still find some work to do,
but much of their time is usefully employed in keeping a look-out
for vessels in distress, and in manning lifeboats and rocket
apparatus. The old-fashioned smuggler, who got himself transported
and afterwards, in many cases, became "a leading colonist," is now
as extinct as the buccaneer.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 332</p>-->

<p>Johnston, who flourished late enough to be accused of having
organised a scheme for rescuing Napoleon from St Helena, but who
died before he could put it into execution, was about the last of
the notables.</p>

<p>In August 1797 Johnston was a prisoner convicted of smuggling,
and hearing of the expedition to Holland, he succeeded in making
his escape from prison and getting on board one of the ships. He
did such good service on this occasion that Sir Ralph Abercromby
and the Duke of York interceded for him with Pitt, and he was
pardoned. Soon after he received his pardon he was at the old game
again, was captured, and lodged in the Fleet, making his escape
from that gaol in a very clever manner, and got across to Holland,
where he managed a big system of smuggling which employed many men
and vessels. When war was renewed, the French thought so much of
him that they first persuaded, then tried to force, him into their
service, and on account of his refusal to turn traitor, put him in
gaol, whence he subsequently escaped and made his way to
America.</p>

<p>The coastguardsman now, in the sight of the seaside visitor,
seems quite superfluous, his spy-glass being of little more
apparent use than to relieve the monotony of dawdling about the
beach by making out the rig of passing vessels; but apart from his
valuable life-saving services, the coastguardsman still has
occasional chances of setting his wits, if not his weapons, against
smugglers. Fishermen and small coasting-vessels still smuggle in a
mild way, but present-day methods are as unlike to the
old-fashioned as are area sneak thieves to Hounslow Heath
highwaymen, and the cargoes that are run now are seldom worth the
risk incurred.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 333</p>-->

<p>In a newspaper report, in the year 1818, it is stated that a
French rowing boat was captured, landing goods on Southsea beach,
near Fort Cumberland. Her cargo consisted of 1132 yards of French
silk, 19 Angola shawls, 11 dozen pair Angola gloves, 36 pair silk
stockings, 42 snuffboxes, 56 dozen kid gloves, 225 yards of
cambric, 1 petticoat of fur, and 16 silk sashes. In the same paper
another paragraph states that:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"The produce of the <i>Fox</i> smuggling
cutter, captured a short time ago, on the coast of Ireland, by the
<i>Vendeleur</i> revenue cruiser, amounted to £85,791, 15s. 10d.
after deducting all expenses, which have been thus
divided:&mdash;Sir Benjamin Hallowell, admiral of the station,
£10,721 9s. 5d.; Mr Hoskings, commander of the <i>Vendeleur</i>,
£21,441, 18s. 11d.; Mr Spencer, first mate, £10,721, 9s. 5d.; Mr
Collins, purser, £4251, 15s. 8d.; the gunner, boatswain, and
carpenter, £2251, 15s. 8d.; to the remainder of the crew, £112,
17s. 10d. each."</p>

<p>At this end of the century most of the smuggling is done by
well-to-do continental tourists, who defraud the revenue by
smuggling scents and silks concealed on their persons when
travelling; but even this kind of thing is going out of fashion,
and ingenious devices on shipboard, once common, of stowing tobacco
in strange places, have by frequent use of them become familiar to
revenue officers. I have seen examples of this within recent years.
An angle-iron beam, supporting the roof of a ship's deck-house, was
filled with plugs of tobacco by the petty officers living in the
house. A light lathe of wood was fixed on to this, and a coat of
paint given to it, with the result that the iron beam looked very
natural, and no one thought a man not in the secret could possibly
detect the deception.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 334</p>-->

<p>The ship duly arrived in the Thames, and the searchers went to
the forecastle and deck-houses, overhauled the men's kits and
bedding, and found nothing. One of the two men searching the
deck-house cast his eyes round for a possible corner of
concealment, and looked at the roof "What is that?" he said to his
mate; "a solid wooden beam running across the deck-house in an iron
ship! No, no, that won't do;" the next moment he had mounted on a
sea-chest, and with the aid of the searchers' tool, a long
"pricker," had pierced the iron beam in several places, discovering
by the smell of the instrument that the beam was stuffed with
tobacco. A jack-knife soon prised out the cakes, and the whole plot
was blown. Of course, every one denied knowledge of the matter, and
the tobacco was forfeited.</p>

<p>Filling the chines on the bottoms of wooden deck buckets with
tobacco, and stowing it in the man-holes of boilers, in the coils
of ropes, and similar dodges, have long since been played out. But
within my own knowledge, a good deal of smuggling was done some
years ago in Zuyder Zee schuts bringing eels to Billingsgate. The
skippers of these vessels stowed tobacco and other contraband goods
in watertight tins among the eels in the water-washed double
bottoms of their vessels, and disposed of it to small boats, met
with on their way up the coast. Not much harm was done to the
revenue by the trade, as the receivers were mostly coasting seamen
and fishermen, who only purchased enough tobacco for their own use,
paying half-a-crown a pound for seventeen ounces of inferior Dutch
shag, the smuggler making about two shillings on each pound he
sold.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 335</p>-->

<p>Lloyd's opened as a coffee-house in 1688, by 1788 had grown into
an important association of marine insurance underwriters, with
offices at the Royal Exchange, and in 1811 became a Corporation by
Act of Parliament, it being then established for the "carrying out
of marine insurance, for the interests of the members of the
Association, and for the collection and diffusion of intelligence
and information relating to shipping." The amount of property
insured at Lloyd's now amounts to £4,000,000 or £5,000,000
sterling, and to this Corporation we owe much of the excellent
system of regulations derived for the purpose of sending seaworthy
ships to sea; we owe to the same Corporation the extensive and
reliable service of signal stations on our coast, so complete, even
early in the century, that the British Government was indebted, and
confessed its indebtedness to it, for receiving war news earlier
than it reached ministers through official channels.</p>

<p>Lloyd's Register of Shipping, for some years managed by a
committee altogether separate from the underwriters, is the most
complete record of the world's shipping in existence, giving, as it
does, not only a complete account of all British ships, but a
history of shipmasters, thus enabling insurance brokers to
calculate their risks, with not only the particulars of the vessels
before them, but with the records for trustworthiness, or
otherwise, of the men chiefly responsible for their navigation.
There are, as a matter of fact, several other registers and
classifiers of ships, though Lloyd's Register does most of the
English business, and a good deal of the foreign, for to be
classified "A1 at Lloyd's" is to a ship "a first-class life" in
insurance business.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 336</p>-->

<p>The history of Lloyd's has been well and often written, and some
pages of it make very entertaining reading; for example, the story
of the loss of the <i>Lutine</i>, which begins with the close of
the last and runs through the present century. The <i>Lutine</i>,
one of the North Sea Squadron under Admiral Duncan, was a 32-gun
frigate, and she left Yarmouth with a quantity of bullion on board
for Hamburg on the morning of October the 9th, 1799, and, for some
unexplained reason, eighteen hours later, went ashore on the
dangerous shoals ofif the Zuyder Zee. One man only was saved from
the wreck, and he expired soon after being picked up, being unable
before he died to give an explanation of the disaster.</p>

<p>Through the whole of the present century runs the curious story
of the search for the sunken treasure in the <i>Lutine</i>,
computed, after careful calculation, to amount to upwards of
£1,175,000, of which sum about £100,000 has been recovered in gold
and silver bars and Dutch guilders. The salvors have at different
times been Dutch and English companies, Lloyd's agents and the
Dutch Government, not to speak of the hundreds of Zuyder Zee
fishermen who have informally joined in the search. Lloyd's, a few
weeks after the wreck, paid the insurance claims in full, but their
agents recovered less from the wreck than would pay for the expense
incurred in searching for it. After much trouble, the Netherlands
Government, who claimed the wreck, granted the underwriters a half
share in it&mdash;an arrangement so hampered by conditions as to be
scarcely worth accepting&mdash;but the whole story has been often
told before, and the mementos recovered in 1859, still to be seen
at Lloyd's rooms, in the shape of a table and chair made from the
wreck, and the bell and rudder-chain of the frigate, form the text,
at regular intervals, of magazine articles on the wreck of the
<i>Lutine</i>.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 337</p>-->

<p>Other pages in Lloyd's history record curious stories of
attempts to defraud the underwriters. Here are some of
them:&mdash;</p>

<p>At daybreak on a November morning, in 1802, William Codlin,
ex-master of the brig <i>Adventure</i>, was taken out of Newgate,
placed on a cart, and, amid the jeers of the crowd, slowly driven
to Execution Dock, where he was duly hanged for attempting to
defraud Lloyd's by scuttling his vessel. But the greater rascals in
this crime had escaped justice, owing to the imperfect state of the
law and the skill of their counsel. Two London shipowners, named
Easterly and Macfarlane, purchased the <i>Adventure</i> in May
1802. In June she was loaded with a general cargo, alleged to
consist of plate, cutlery, watches, etc., and was cleared for
Gibraltar and Leghorn, her owners having insured her for about
£5,000. The vessel left the Thames on July 8, and took just a month
to get off Brighton, having, in the meanwhile, called at Yarmouth,
landed some of her crew, who did not approve of the captain's
proceedings, and shipped others less scrupulous. Off Brighton, a
man named Cooper, under the instructions of Captain Codling,
deliberately bored a number of holes in the ship's bottom, and the
brig, being close in to Brighton beach, began to sink. Several
fishermen came alongside in their boats and offered assistance, but
Codling ordered them off. The revenue-cutter <i>Swallow</i> then
came along, and the lieutenant in charge of her took the brig in
tow, and endeavoured to beach her, but she sank two miles off the
land, leaving only her topmasts above water. Codling and his crew,
meanwhile, had got into their boat, and, it being a perfectly calm
and fine Sunday, rowed ashore comfortably, and walked up to the
nearest tavern.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 338</p>-->

<p>This was such a barefaced piece of rascality, every one on
Brighton beach having witnessed it, that the matter soon got
abroad, and the underwriters at Lloyd's sent a reliable man to
investigate. This man arrived from London on the Tuesday, and,
producing his authority, ordered Codling and his men to remain in
the tavern until he gave further orders; the owners, meanwhile,
having been interviewed in London, gave a promise to assist in
making inquiries. Instead of keeping their promise, Macfarlane went
down to Brighton and arranged secretly for the escape of Codling.
The brig in a day or two was hauled high and dry on the beach, and
the surveyors then discovered the cause of her sinking. In the
course of a week or two Codling was captured while attempting to
make his way to the Continent; the sailor who had scuttled the ship
turned King's evidence; without any difficulty several additional
witnesses were obtained, and Codling, the two owners, and the
supercargo were brought to trial. The last three were acquitted on
technical points, though there was plenty of undoubted proof that
they were the chief scoundrels. The two owners were defended by
Thomas Erskine, the future Lord Chancellor, but Codling was
sentenced to death.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 339</p>-->

<p>The brig <i>Colina</i>, in July 1840, was insured for £1250.
William Simpson, her master, deliberately, in fine weather, ran her
ashore a few months later off the Texel. The owner was proved to be
a highly respectable person. But Simpson was transported for life.
The owner was put on his trial, but Simpson declared that he had
cast the ship away for no other reason than that he had a mind to
it, and as Mr Justice Maule said, he richly deserved to be
punished, seeing that by his own showing he had committed the crime
at the instigation of no one, and the owner was quite innocent.</p>

<p>The case of the <i>Dryad</i>, in 1841, was another instance. Her
owners insured the brig for £2000 with one firm of underwriters,
and for a further £2000, secretly, with another, pretending by
means of false bills of lading to have put on board cargo which was
never shipped. The captain, with a great deal of difficulty,
managed to wreck the ship in the West Indies. The swindle, in due
course, was discovered, and the two owners were transported for
life.</p>

<p>This sort of crime was by no means uncommon during the first
half of the century, and we have not been free from it in later
years. In 1867, for example, Lloyd's prosecuted, and secured the
conviction of an insurance broker, the mate, and another man who
had scuttled the Severn, which, had been insured for £15,000, a sum
greatly in excess of her value. The captain of the ship, in this
case, turned informer, so that the first villain in the piece was,
on this occasion, duly punished; one of the men convicted was
proved to have been concerned in the suspicious loss of fifteen
vessels.</p>

<p>The evidence in all these cases, as indeed right through the
history of Lloyd's, shows that the Association of Underwriters as a
body have been thoroughly honourable men, perfectly fitted to be
entrusted (as the peculiar growth of the institution has brought
about) with practically the whole responsibility for the
seaworthiness of our maritime shipping&mdash;a condition of affairs
unknown in any other country. Our Board of Trade represents such
government interference as exists in England, but Lloyd's surveyors
make the extent of that interference, or the necessity for it, very
slight indeed.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 340</p>-->

<p>It used to be the vulgar idea that unseaworthy ships were sent
to sea to be lost for the sake of the insurance, with the full
knowledge of the broker, who was largely responsible for the crimes
of shipowners. There is nothing further from the truth; the most
searching investigations have proved that while insurance brokers
have to take risks of all kinds, and there have been dishonest men
among them, the system, as a whole, slowly built up in the course
of a couple of hundred years, is the most effectual in protecting
the public, provides the best safeguards possible, and does a great
part of the business of shipping, much better in every way than it
could be done if undertaken by Government.</p>

<p>The fisheries of the British Isles have changed wonderfully
during the century. The facilities of ice packing, of railway
carriage, and of steamers to convey the fish from the fishing
grounds to the markets, have made it much easier to regulate supply
to demand. Until the fifties fishermen were, for a market,
practically confined to the immediate neighbourhood of the
sea-ports to which their fishing vessels belonged. Now we have
steam trawlers, decked, and well-boats, instead of open boats and
sailing-smacks, although both of the last two classes of vessel
still outnumber the steamers. About 14,000 men and boys are
employed in the North Sea fisheries alone.</p>

<p>Yachting practically dates from the beginning of this century,
for although the Cork Harbour Water Club, now the Royal Cork Yacht
Club, was formed in 1720, yacht-racing as a sport, as we understand
it, did not take regular form, until a party of Cowes yacht owners
started the Royal Yacht Squadron Club at Cowes in 1812. In the
twenties, the Thames, the Clyde, and Plymouth started clubs, and
the Mersey, the Harwich, the Southampton, and many others were
formed by the forties, William IV. having helped to make the sport
popular by his institution of the Royal Yacht Squadron Cup in
1834.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 341</p>-->

<p>The Americans took up the sport in 1844, and in 1851 won their
first race from the English with the <i>America</i>, and the
America Cup has since been an institution. The Americans still hold
the Cup in spite of our endeavours, ending with that of Sir Thomas
Lipton in 1899, to win it back. We have, however, not much to
regret in this. From small vessels suitable for trading, yet
sailing fast, in which builders took as much pride for their
seaworthiness as for the speed of their craft, the modern racing
yacht has become a mere speed machine. And while we are still an
easy first in the building of steel sea-going vessels, we need not
regret that we are only a good second in the science of racing
machine construction.</p>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV. END OF THE CENTURY
SHIPS AND SAILORS.</h2>

<h3>The Development of Iron and Steel&mdash;Modern
Shipbuilders&mdash;The Future&mdash;Present-Day
Seamen&mdash;Conclusion.</h3>

<p>Within the last two or three years, the <i>Hector</i>, the
<i>Resistance</i>, the <i>Warrior</i>, and the <i>Canada</i>, types
of our earliest ironclads, have been towed to a last resting-place
in "Rotten Row," and now lie hulks at moorings where less than a
generation ago lay three-deckers, whose timbers yet litter the
yards of the shipbreakers; and within sight of these ironclad
hulks, the <i>Trafalgar</i> of 1806, disguised as the <i>Pitt</i>,
still floats, a coal hulk, while the <i>Victoria and Albert</i> of
1899 is lying alongside the third George's yacht, the old
sailing-ship <i>Royal George</i>. These, and other hulks still
afloat, were ships before the iron age was thought of, and it is
quite possible they will still be floating when the last of our
ironclads has become a hulk, supplanted by the modern steel
war-vessel.</p>

<p>Sir William White, K.C.B., F.R.S., who was born at Devonport,
and served in the dockyard there as a shipwright's apprentice, has
only this year retired from the position of Director of Naval
Construction. He designed our first ironclads and our most recent
battleships. In the period 1883-85 he temporarily left the
Admiralty and joined the Elswick Works; but when the Government
awoke to its duty and began the construction of the new fleet, Sir
William White was recalled to the Queen's service, and, in about a
dozen years, he built nearly £50,000,000 worth of war vessels.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 343</p>-->

<p>As a material for shipbuilding, iron had been experimented with
long before the century opened. But the thing was preposterous. For
any sane man to go afloat in an iron vessel was to fly in the face
of nature. This was said by a leading naval architect of a period
well within this century, and in this sentence he expressed the
world's opinion of the proposition.</p>

<p>I have some particulars of a proposal, made as early as 1809,
not only to build iron ships, but to rig them with iron masts and
yards and chain rigging; the <i>Vulcan</i>, a small iron steamer,
was running on the Clyde nine years later, but it was not until
1821, when the <i>Aaron Manby</i> crossed the channel, that iron
ship-building was fairly started.</p>

<p>The introduction of the screw propeller gave an impetus to the
use of new material, for the screw demanded greater length of hulls
and greater strength and lightness of construction. Before another
decade, Ditchburn and Mare on the Thames (how many people will
recognise in the names the present great Thames Iron Works and
Shipbuilding Company!), the Lairds of Birkenhead, the Napiers on
the Clyde, and others began building iron vessels. The scarcity of
timber and the growing cheapness of iron, the constant danger of
fire in wooden steamers, all appealed to the minds of naval
architects open to conviction, and, in a very few years, iron had
practically superseded wood as a material for shipbuilding, though
not for war-vessels, for it was some years later before the
Admiralty paid serious attention to the change.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 344</p>-->

<p>Before, however, iron became general, a compromise was tried.
This was the composite ship. Jordan and Getty, of Liverpool, built
a schooner on this principle in 1850, and in February of the
following year they launched the barque <i>Marion Macintyre</i>,
for Macintyre &amp; Co. of Liverpool. The merit of the invention,
as set forth by Mr John Jordan, junior, who claimed to be the
inventor, lay in the fact that a composite ship possessed a perfect
and rigid iron frame, completely independent of the material with
which it was covered, be that material wood or any other; and in
the disposition and arrangement of the principal timbers and
planking, whereby secure and perfect joinings of wood with wood,
and iron with iron, were formed throughout the structure.</p>

<p>Such method of construction was also much cheaper than in the
case of either wood or iron ships, and the wooden bottom, in the
still existing difficulty of fouling, was, of course, an advantage,
since the wooden outer skin could be covered with copper. Without
going into further technicalities of construction, it is fair to
mention that Mr Jordan foresaw one of the serious objections to
composite shipbuilding. Galvanic action was set up whenever iron
came into contact with copper. Jordan, to prevent this, between the
iron frame and wood sheathing, laid a lining of gutta percha, but
this was not altogether successful, and the composite ship never
became popular in the merchant service. In the Royal Navy, however,
the composite vessel has lasted till the present day, being useful
for surveying purposes on foreign stations, where scraping a reef
and tearing off plates would be awkward to repair, but a started
plank comparatively easy. The fact, too, has always to be
remembered that an iron or steel steamer should be docked, at
least, once in six months&mdash;for the perfect anti-fouling paint
has yet to be invented, useful as are those now employed. The
composite ship, with her coppered bottom, where dry docks are not
handy and when vessels are long in commission, is therefore
commonly employed by the Admiralty for surveying service in distant
parts of the world.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 345</p>-->

<p>The <i>Great Britain</i>, in 1845, was the first iron steamer to
cross the Atlantic, and the <i>Adriatic</i>, of the Collins line,
was the last wooden steamer built for this service. She was running
from 1857 to 1861, when she was sold for a hulk. The first iron
Cunarder was the <i>Persia</i>, and the last of the iron
paddle-boats the <i>Scotia</i>; the last of the wooden steamers the
<i>Arabia</i>. Their dates are all between the fifties and sixties,
but the <i>Scotia</i> continued running until the later seventies,
when she was sold to a telegraph cable company. In the later
fifties came that sensational blunder, the often described <i>Great
Eastern</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Great Eastern</i> was designed by Isambard Brunei (son of
the inventor of the block-making machine), and laid down in Scott,
Russell &amp; Co.'s yard at Milwall on May 1, 1854. She was at
first called the <i>Leviathan</i>, and was built to the order of
the Eastern Steam Navigation Company for the Indian and Australian
trade. Her propelling powers were six masts for sails, and screw
and paddle engines. This combination, it was supposed, would work
wonders, but it proved totally inadequate to her size. The Thames
at Mihvall not being wide enough to launch her end on&mdash;she was
691 ft. long, and 83 ft. wide&mdash;she was built broadside on to
the water, on a floor, inclined one in twelve, down which she was
to be pushed a distance of 260 ft. by hydraulic rams along the
broadside.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 346</p>-->

<p>The launch, attempted in November 1857, was a failure; some of
the workmen were killed in the operation, and the ship was not got
afloat until January 1858. She had cost, so far, with hull and
engines, about £700,000, and the original Company was glad to sell
her, within twelve months of her launch, for £160,000. Her engines,
the paddles of 1200 horse power, and the screw of 1600 horse power,
though inadequate to her burden of 22,500 tons, were more than
enough to move all the cargoes and passengers she could obtain. No
port in the world could at that time, within any convenient period,
collect cargoes enough for such a vessel, and her many misfortunes
made passengers nervous of travelling in her. Her double shell of
two skins of half-an-inch thick iron, though making her safer than
many of her con-temporaries, caused her, in conjunction with her
rounded canoe-like bottom, to roll horribly, and in spite of her
great height out of water, she shipped green seas, even in moderate
gales.</p>

<p>On her trial trip an explosion of steam occurred, by which ten
firemen were killed and several others injured, and from this time
her career was a series of misfortunes. Her designer took her
failure so much to heart that he died of grief soon after her trial
trip. In 1864, after unsuccessful voyages to India, to Australia,
and across the Atlantic, she began laying Atlantic telegraph cable,
the most useful and only successful work done by her. Then she was
laid up on the Clyde, and, in 1888, was sold for old metal for
about £16,000. In August of that year she was towed from the Clyde
to the Mersey, and beached on the Cheshire shore, and the ship
breakers, before the year was ended, had entirely broken her up.
Brunei, so far as the size of his ship was concerned, was about
half a century ahead in his ideas. The <i>Oceanic</i>, launched in
1899, exceeds the <i>Great Eastern</i> in length by a few feet, but
is much narrower in beam, while in speed the new steamer is twice
as fast as the old one.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 347</p>-->

<p>One may roughly describe the process of iron ship-building as in
the experimental stage in the twenties, begun in the thirties,
progressing slowly till the fifties, and rapidly in the sixties and
seventies; its progress slackening by the growing use of steel in
the eighties, and now practically superseded by the last-named
material.</p>

<p>In 1875 the Admiralty was paying £20 a ton for iron plates for
shipbuilding, and in that year no steel vessels were building in
the United Kingdom&mdash;although 6 steamers, 200 wooden sailing
ships, 125 iron steamers, and 115 iron sailing ships were on the
stocks. Twenty years later the only wooden vessels building were
small coasters; the only iron vessels, 27 steamers and 1 sailing
ship; while 282 steamers and 23 sailing ships of steel were on the
stocks. At the end of 1899, in all the big shipbuilding yards,
steel had practically superseded iron, while the cost of steel
plates was about half that of iron.</p>

<p>Building in private yards or in Government dockyards does not
now differ materially, except that in the Government dockyards much
of the material used has to be fashioned by contract elsewhere,
whereas in many of the private yards nearly every one of the
details of the work can be done on the spot; nor is there much
difference in the cost to the public of the work done in private or
royal yards. The cost for the most recent types of vessels of a
first-class battleship in a Government yard is about £66 per ton,
the tonnage is about 12,950 tons, so that the price is roughly
£861,284; a similar vessel built in a private yard would cost about
£64 a ton. A third-class cruiser built in a royal yard costs about
£147,899, or £67 per ton, her tonnage being about 2135 tons; in a
private yard the cost is about £64 per ton. These figures are for
ships complete in every detail except armament.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 348</p>-->

<p>Besides being cheaper, a steel ship can be built of equal
strength, while fifteen per cent, lighter in weight of metal than
an iron ship. In the mercantile service it is usual to make some
parts of the structure of steel vessels of iron those parts being
where the surface is most exposed to corrosion, viz., underneath
the engines and boilers, the exposed weather decks, inside the
bunkers, etc. But in war-vessels iron has practically become
extinct. The great increase in the size of vessels in the last year
or two is very marked; this increase still goes on, and no modern
constructor will undertake to say what will be the maximum, or when
that maximum will be reached. The largest cargo steamers are
principally built for the Transatlantic service, for carrying
cotton, grain, and cattle. It is quite usual for them to return in
ballast when suitable cargo is not available, so that economy in
working has to be greatly studied; with a very slight increase in
crew it is possible to work a very large increase in tonnage, hence
the popularity with shipowners of big careo steamers.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 349</p>-->

<p>There is an agitation now going on in Parliament in regard to
the necessity for legislation on the matter of ballasting these
large vessels. The question has arisen within the last few years,
and is a direct consequence of the substitution of steel for iron,
and the introduction of the present large, flat-bottomed,
broad-beamed vessels, with a flat keel in place of the projecting
bar-keel, common fifteen years ago. The bar-keel projected
considerably below the bottom plate of the ship, and as ships
became larger, drawing more water, to lessen their draught this was
abandoned. The question of draught is, of course, of major
importance in the designing of the cargo steamer. The
narrow-beamed, unstable, dangerous type of ships, usually built
from fifteen to twenty years ago, was based upon the, now admitted,
fallacy that narrowness of beam was an important factor in the
speed of a vessel, whereas length is really the main consideration.
This change of opinion has led to a reaction, and many present-day
steamers have an excessively broad beam. These changes have
necessitated a modification of the old plan of carrying all water
ballast in a double bottom, and the fitting of additional spaces
for carrying ballast at a higher level, so as not to make the
vessel too stiff. The Board of Trade permits the double bottom to
be excluded from tonnage measurement, thereby giving the shipowner
more space to carry his cargo, and on the same principle, other
spaces, if used exclusively for carrying water ballast, should be
excluded, but the Board declines to recognise this, and the
shipowner who provides a large water ballast capacity suffers for
doing so. From this has arisen the unsatisfactory practice of
arranging these ballast compartments, so that they can also be used
for carrying cargo. This has led to the desire for legislation. But
shipowners and shipbuilders both recognise the difficulty, and if
left to themselves would probably soon devise a means to overcome
it.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 350</p>-->

<p>The Admiralty constructors lay down the plans for warships, and
Lloyd's rules regulate, with very few exceptions, the building of
merchant ships. Lloyd's surveys and classes most British ships,
therefore owners and shipbuilders design vessels to meet Lloyd's
requirements. Building begins with the "constructional drawings,"
and from these main plans, plans of all the various parts are laid
off in the mould lofts. The keel is laid, often now, in the case of
a big warship, in a graving dock, so that when completed she can be
floated out, and the delicate operation of launching avoided. To
the keel are riveted the angle-irons forming the frame; the ribs
while at a white heat are then bent to the exact curves required,
this part of the work being a distinct branch of the shipbuilders'
business, just as the rolling of the steel plates is another; the
plates for the cellular double bottoms are laid, then follow the
decklaying and the skin or outer plating; the armour, if a war
vessel, and the upper works. The whole preparation of the material
is the work of the forge, or the lathe, or the steel plane, or of
some similar tool belonging to the blacksmiths' department, the
blacksmithing being on the scale that uses a steel hammer of ninety
tons force on the anvils. The work of putting the materials
together is done by riveters&mdash;the shipwrights are riveters,
and their assistants are riveters' labourers&mdash;and riveting by
hand or by machine-driven riveters, using electricity, seems, to
the uninitiated onlooker, the sole operation involved in putting
the ships together.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 351</p>-->

<p>In the modern shipbuilding yard the adze is almost an unused
tool, and chips of wood are rarely seen. The agreeable odours of
newly cut timber, and the wholesome smell of boiling pitch, have
been replaced by stifling fumes of sulphur and the gases of molten
metal; in place of the music of caulkers' and shipwrights' mallets,
the noises of the yard are now combined in one hideous
clangour&mdash;the din of the boiler-maker; the dust of the casting
boxes is now the litter of the shops; the steel shaving from a
steel-driven planing machine the least ugly object in the
factory.</p>

<p>With the expiring century the wood-worker, cunning to see
<i>shakes</i> or <i>rends</i>, and learned upon <i>cups</i> that
would split planks when trenails came to be driven, is dying; and
the sail-loft, where workers with palm and needle and fid plied
their trade, making single sails with a thousand yards of canvas in
them, will soon be a curiosity.</p>

<p>What a chapter in the history of the sea is written in the
office ledgers of the great shipbuilding yards! In most of them are
entries beginning sixty or seventy years ago, when the launch of a
500-ton wooden sailing ship was the event of a year, and its
successful accomplishment good reason for rejoicing. The names of
some of the great builders are as familiar to the British public as
are the names of many statesmen, and the services of the builders
have been quite as important in the furtherance of their country's
prosperity. Some materials for the story of iron and steel
shipbuilding, and of the builders who have become great during the
Victorian era, have been very kindly given to me at first hand by
firms whose names are famous throughout the shipping world. Such
short summary of this material as the limits of this book allows
does but poor justice to the importance of the subject.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 352</p>-->

<p>By the graceful lines of their hulls and the smart passages of
clippers, by the rapid steaming and beauty of the great ocean
liners, Clyde-built vessels, for the last half century, have given
in seaports, the world over, bold advertisement to Scotch
shipbuilders.</p>

<p>The Dennys of Dumbarton is essentially a historic shipbuilding
firm. Nearly seventy years ago William Denny, the founder, built
the <i>Rob Roy</i> and the <i>Marjery</i>, pioneer steamers on the
Clyde, launching the little vessels from a small yard on the east
bank of the Leven. William Denny died in 1833, leaving seven sons,
and three of them, William, Alexander, and Peter, continued the
business. In 1844 they began building iron vessels; in 1851 Dr
Peter Denny, the sole survivor, entered into partnership with
Messrs Tullock and M'Ausland, marine engineers of Dumbarton, and in
1871 Mr Walter Brock joined the partnership, and these gentlemen
and their sons brought the firm to its present high position. In
1867, owing to the growth of trade, the Leven shipyard was removed
to the opposite bank of the river, where it now occupies 40 acres
in workshops and docks. The Dennys are famous for their
experimental tank, 300 ft. long by 10 ft. deep, in which, with
models cut from paraffin wax, by ingenious methods devised by the
late Mr Froude of Torquay, various designs of ships are
experimented with. The only other tank of its kind is near
Portsmouth Dockyard, and the Dennys' fame for beauty of lines, and
great speed in their ships, is largely attributed to their careful
experiments with what many people at first looked upon as an
expensive toy. The Dennys employ about 3000 workmen. They have a
direct interest in a steel works at Dumbarton, which enables them
to be almost independent of outside work, and their present yearly
output is about 36,000 tons. Since 1844 they have launched about
633 vessels of all classes, from shallow draught river and channel
steamers, and stern wheelers of large size, drawing only 15 in., to
Atlantic greyhounds of 18,000 tons register, and 22-knot Irish
Channel passenger steamers.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 353</p>-->

<p>Robert Napier began life in a blacksmith's shop in Glasgow in
1815; eight years later he built his first engine, which for many
years propelled a Clyde ferry steamer. The blacksmith's shop soon
became a marine engineering establishment; then, in 1839, Napier
was entrusted with the important undertaking of supplying the
engines for the <i>British Queen</i>, the first of the Cunarders;
and, soon after, four other steamers for the same company. He
engined the <i>Duke of Wellington</i>, the pride of the English
navy forty years ago, and he built the <i>Black Prince</i>, the
second of the four first iron-clads. The name of Robert Napier can
be seen now on brass plates on ships in every seaport in the
world.</p>

<p>John Elder served his apprenticeship with Napier; then, in 1852,
he joined the firm of Randolph, Elliot &amp; Company, constructing
the first compound engine (his invention) for a screw steamer, the
<i>Brandon</i>, in 1854, and, in 1868, he became the owner of the
Fairfield Ship-building Company. Sir William Pearce, in conjunction
with the heirs of John Elder, in 1870, joined the Fairfield Works,
and became sole partner eight years later. Since then Fairfield has
turned out more than £7,000,000 worth of shipping, among them some
of the most celebrated ocean liners.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 354</p>-->

<p>The firm of Harland &amp; Wolff of Belfast, less than fifty
years ago, proudly launched an occasional steamer; and this
shipyard was then just beginning to call attention to itself,
surprising the Clyde shipbuilders, who thought serious competition
in Belfast was not to be feared. Something like 8000 men are now
employed by Harland &amp; Wolff, and the Belfast shipbuilders, in
the middle of 1899, had, at one time, upon the stocks or under
repair, ten of the largest ships in the world, representing 100,000
tons. The <i>Oceanic</i>, the largest British steamer afloat, was
launched from Harland &amp; Wolff's yard in 1899.</p>

<p>The history of the Lairds of Birkenhead is practically the
history of steamships. William Laird, grandfather of the present
senior partner, was one of the promoters of the St George Steam
Packet Company, running between Glasgow and Liverpool; later on, Mr
Laird provided a steamer service between the principal ports of
Scotland and Ireland, and in 1824 he founded a shipbuilding firm,
the celebrated <i>Sirius</i> being one of the first vessels built
in the yard. In 1829, John Laird, son of the founder of the
Birkenhead Iron Works, began building in iron, and this Laird, from
that time, became an ardent believer in the new material, in which
belief he was actively supported by his brother, Macgregor Laird,
who, in 1831, took the iron steamer <i>Alburka</i> up the Niger,
and he was the first master to make an ocean voyage in an iron
vessel. The Lairds, from then on, built dozens of vessels whose
names became famous in the annals of shipping&mdash;among the
earliest the <i>Robert F. Stockton</i> is perhaps the best
remembered.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 355</p>-->

<p>By the later thirties, the Lairds were building ships for the
East India Company, and the names of the armed flotilla constructed
in 1839 for service on the Tigris and Euphrates&mdash;the
<i>Nimrod</i>, <i>Nitocris</i>, and <i>Assyria</i>, and later, the
<i>Nemesis</i> and <i>Phlegethon</i>&mdash;can be found in English
history. These were the first war-vessels built at the yard. In the
same year came the first order from the Admiralty; and the
<i>Dover</i> for the Government Mail Packet Service, launched in
1840, was probably <i>the</i> first iron vessel built for the
Admiralty. Three gun-boats were ordered in the next year&mdash;the
<i>Soudan</i>, <i>Albert</i>, and <i>Wilberforce</i>&mdash;for
service on the Niger, and shortly afterwards came the first foreign
order, the <i>Guadaloupe</i>, an iron paddle-wheel war-vessel of
800 tons burden for the Mexican Government. In 1842, the
<i>Nun</i>, an iron ferry steamer built by the Lairds, grounded on
the stone pier at Birkenhead, her stern resting on the pier and her
bows on a rock, leaving a hollow space between the two points of
eighty-one feet. The whole of this intervening space, in which her
sixty-five tons weight of machinery was situated, was unsupported,
yet she floated off next tide uninjured. This was a triumphant
demonstration of the strength of iron vessels that went far to
encourage faith in them, and orders came freely to the yard. On the
outbreak of the Crimean war, the Lairds were in great request, and
they were equal to all demands, completing within eight months 29
vessels, chiefly gunboats and light draft mortar vessels; one of
these, the <i>Cupid</i>, of 102 tons burden, and of iron, was begun
and launched within three weeks. Then came orders from the
Admiralty, from private shipowners, and from foreign governments:
Vanderbilt's 17-knot steam-yacht <i>Valiant</i>; the Irish Channel
steamers, <i>Ulster</i>, <i>Munster</i>, and <i>Connaught</i>; the
British ironclads. <i>Captain, Agincourt, Vanguard</i>; the foreign
war-vessels, <i>Huascar, Almirante Landell, Almirante Lynch</i>;
and famous ocean liners too numerous to mention; and more famous
than all, the Confederate cruiser <i>Alabama</i>, which was
launched from the yard in August 1862.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 356</p>-->

<p>In modern times the Lairds have built every kind of war-vessel,
from the 27-knot torpedo-destroyers of 1893 to the up-to-date
33-knot type; and the <i>Royal Oak</i> and the <i>Glory</i>, 14,000
tons displacement, battleships. The present members of the firm are
the direct descendants of the original brothers Laird, in the
fourth generation. Up to the last quarter of the year 1899, Laird's
yard had built about 467,000 tons of shipping, employing constantly
about 3000 men and occasionally as many as 5000. Their 20 acres of
works include five graving docks and four building slips. From the
first iron vessel built in 1829 to the present, about 650 iron and
steel ships have been launched, with machinery equal to 640,000
horse power; and for the half century the firm have been
contractors to the Admiralty, they have launched 80 vessels for the
Royal Navy, and more than a score for foreign governments.</p>

<p>William Armstrong, founder of the Elswick Works of Armstrong,
Whitworth &amp; Company, on the Tyne, was born in 1810; while
articled to an attorney he made a hobby of electricity, thinking
out several important inventions. Then he turned his attention to
hydraulics&mdash;the hydraulic crane and a great many other
applications of hydraulic power were devised by him. In the middle
of the century, a small works was established at Elswick to make
Armstrong's patents, and, in 1854, he built the rifled gun that
bears his name. Patent after patent was taken out by the firm,
until the works grew in extent and importance, and now this
shipyard, forging its own steel, making its own tools and
materials, turns out warships complete, from the operation of
laying the keel plates to furnishing the armament.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 357</p>-->

<p>From that famous firm of shipbuilders, Palmers, Jarrow, whose
rolling mills, blast furnaces, and building slips extend for a mile
and a half along the Tyne bank, I have received an interesting
document which illustrates, without further comment, the change
from iron to steel, and the increase of size in the steamers.</p>

<p>Approximate mercantile tonnage launched at Jarrow:&mdash;</p>

1891  " 1898      65    226,000        3500
</pre>

<p>Before 1883 all the ships were of iron; after 1885 all the ships
were of steel.</p>

<p>The firm have built every kind of war-vessel, from the floating
battery <i>Terror</i>, launched in 1856, to the modern battleship
<i>Resolution</i> of 1891; from the old-fashioned cruiser
<i>Defence</i> of 1860, to three 30-knot torpedo boat destroyers in
1899.</p>

<p>Barrow-in-Furness, down almost to the fifties, had a population
of about three hundred and fifty persons, though the veins of pure
haematite iron in the district have been worked for a hundred
years. Then railways opened up the country, and from an export of
1000 tons yearly of iron-ore, the figures rose, until now the great
Bessemer Steel Works annually use hundreds of thousands of tons. On
a group of islands situated off the Peninsula of Furness are the
great Naval Construction Works of Vickers Sons and Maxim.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 358</p>-->

<p>In July 1899, from this yard was launched the <i>Vengeance</i>,
the first battleship built by the firm, though not by any means the
first big warship, for the <i>Powerful</i>, one of the two largest
and fastest cruisers afloat, was handed over by these builders to
the Admiralty within twenty-nine months of her keel being laid.
This company builds every kind of ship afloat, and employs 14,000
men, whose wages' bill amounts to £1,000,000 sterling a
year&mdash;nearly half that sum is represented by the wages of what
was fifty years ago the hamlet of Barrow. The <i>Vengeance</i> was
completed in every detail, from her keel-plates to her armament, a
broadside of four 50-ton guns, of six 6-inch quick-firers, of six
12-pound guns, and of six Maxims: the whole representing a fire, if
concentrated, of 11,000 pounds of metal, with a collective energy
at the muzzle of 600,000 foot tons. Twenty such ships could fire,
every five minutes, a weight of metal equal to 190 tons. The
Company has now under construction about 70,000 tons of armoured
warships for our own and foreign governments, and has gun and
armour contracts for nearly every government in the world.</p>

<p>From the comparatively small shipbuilding firm of Charles and
William Earle, Earle's Shipbuilding and Engineering Company,
Limited, Hull, has grown up within the last eight-and-twenty years.
The present premises occupy about thirty acres, with a fine
frontage to the Humber, where it is three miles in width. At this
yard some five hundred high-class men-of-war and merchant ships
have been built, including cruisers, gunboats, torpedo boat
destroyers, and royal yachts, for our own or foreign navies. The
firm, of which Mr A. E. Seaton is the managing director, employs
about four thousand men, and such well-known English cruisers as
the <i>Endymion</i> and the <i>St George</i> were launched from
Earle's, who have also supplied many of our warships, built
elsewhere, with machinery. During 1898 their output equalled about
eighteen thousand tons, and they built machinery equal to 48,550
horse power. In 1899 they launched H.M. ships <i>Perseus</i> and
<i>Prometheus</i>, and the torpedo boat destroyers <i>Bullfinch</i>
and <i>Dove</i>.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 359</p>-->

<p>Messrs Ditchburn &amp; Mare began iron shipbuilding at Blackwall
in the forties&mdash;the royal yacht <i>Fairy</i>, as I have
elsewhere stated, was launched by them in 1845. In a description of
Blackwall, published three years before Ditchburn launched the
<i>Fairy</i>, it is stated that:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Blackwall is celebrated for its sumptuous
whitebait dinners, and Lovegrove's West India Dock Tavern is much
resorted to during the season by private parties, corporate bodies
from the City, and occasionally by Cabinet Ministers, for the sake
of the peculiar delicacies there provided." When Cabinet Ministers
go to Blackwall now, their visit is more often connected with the
launching of battleships than with dining on whitebait; for the
firm of Ditchburn &amp; Mare has grown into the Thames Iron Works
Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, occupying 34 acres on the
banks of the river, and employing 3000 workmen. In the last quarter
of 1899, besides a great number of small vessels, the Company were
building four first-class battleships, three for the British, and
one for the Japanese Governments. The firm has recently taken over
the engineering works of John Penn &amp; Sons, and besides its
shipbuilding, carries on boiler-making, marine and electrical
engineering, and in addition to these departments it has a civil
engineers' branch, which has constructed some of the most important
engineering works in the world. The firm has built warships and
merchant vessels of every type; from the <i>Warrior</i>, our first
sea-going ironclad, to the modern 14,000-ton battleship
<i>Albion</i>, from 18-knot mail-steamers to steam lifeboats. One
remarkable vessel by this Company was the <i>Cleopatra</i>, which
conveyed the celebrated obelisk from Alexandria to the Thames
Embankment.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 360</p>-->

<p>The firm of John L. Thorneycroft &amp; Co. of Chiswick, on the
Thames, consists of two partners, both of whom are distinguished in
the scientific world: Mr John Donaldson, as chief of the Ordnance
Department at Dum Dum in India, and Mr John Thorneycroft, of whom
the late chief constructor of the navy. Sir Nathaniel Barnaby,
said: "Out of the four great steps in speed-making which will make
the last quarter of the century illustrious, Mr Thorneycroft must
be credited with three. Mr Thorneycroft in his several successes
has given us a new form of boat, a new system of construction, a
new form of propeller, and an effective way of generating steam by
methods which had often been tried unsuccessfully, and abandoned."
The Thorneycroft water tube boilers are now well known the world
over, but the firm is no less famous for other engineering patents,
and as builders of small fast steamers, torpedo boats, and similar
vessels for our own and foreign governments.</p>

<p>Yarrow &amp; Co., Limited, is a type of the firms that have
grown from the specialisation of modern shipbuilding. The Company
have constructed craft for nearly every government in the world,
their specialty being torpedo boats and torpedo boat destroyers,
steam launches and light draft steamers, such as the Stern wheelers
so famous on African rivers, and well remembered in connection with
military operations on the Nile. They have built light stern
wheelers so large that they might be classed as regular channel
steamers, yet drawing no more than sixteen inches; and they have
recently completed a number of torpedo boat destroyers with a speed
of 32 knots. The works are at Poplar, and employ about 1000
men.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 361</p>-->

<p>There are at least half a dozen other first-class shipbuilding
firms, such as Messrs J. &amp; G. Thomson, and the London and
Glasgow Shipbuilding Company of the Clyde; Hawthorn, Leslie, &amp;
Co. of Newcastle-on-Tyne; Doxford &amp; Sons of Sunderland, and
others, who are continually building war-vessels and merchant
steamers of the largest size.</p>

<p>To the skill and enterprise of these shipbuilders the people of
Great Britain owe a big debt of gratitude; for whatever has been
done by the commercial instincts of shipowners and the seaman-like
qualities of our sailors to establish our sea supremacy, the
British shipbuilder has been more than equal to the occasion. He
has risked enormous capital in experimentalising; he has never for
a moment allowed the question of profitable building to be anything
but secondary to his reputation for good honest workmanship, and
to-day he has the whole world for his customer.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 362</p>-->

<p>Meanwhile Germany has become such a formidable competitor that
the well-known Vulcan Works of Stettin have, at time of writing,
the honour of being the builders of the fastest Atlantic
steamer&mdash;the Norddeutscher Lloyd Company's <i>Kaiser Wilhelm
der Grosse</i>, of 14,349 tons and a sea speed of 24 knots. From
having most of their ships built in England in the seventies, the
Germans, now, not only build their own vessels, but are obtaining
many foreign orders; from 147 merchant steamers in 1871, the German
mercantile steam fleet, in 1898, had grown to the number of 1171
steamers, and the difference in the tonnage had become from, in
1871, 82,000, in 1897, 967,000 tons. He would be a rash prophet who
would predict how much or how little within the next quarter of a
century Germany will have affected our shipbuilding trade; the last
quarter of a century's lesson in other branches of national
industry is, however, apparent to all but those who cannot, or who
will not, see.</p>

<p>He would be a rash prophet, too, who would predict at what
points the yearly increase in speed and in size of ships will have
reached their limits. There are three factors, now in the
experimental stage, and the practical utilisation of any one of
these is as fraught with possibilities as those that came from the
perfection of the screw propeller; the successful application of
all three, or even of two, it is safe to say, will make the
present-day steamer as antiquated a vehicle of sea travelling as is
the present-day sailing ship.</p>

<p>The three factors are the use of aluminium in place of steel in
shipbuilding; of petroleum for fuel; of the turbine propeller. The
turbine system of propulsion is already more than an experiment;
the cheapening of petroleum fuel is practically the only bar to the
substitution for coal fuel; aluminium is one-third the weight of
steel, and when an inventor succeeds in giving it, by an alloy, the
strength of steel, a saving of half the weight will have been
effected in shipbuilding material. This reduction of weight, and
the displacement of coal, are all that is needed to break down the
present limit to the size and speed of steamers.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 363</p>-->

<p>It is pretty generally agreed that the present method of manning
the Royal Navy is about as perfect as it could well be. The
<i>Britannia</i> training school for cadets, and the Royal Naval
Engineers College at Keyham, are perfect institutions for training
young officers. The system of training seamen, catching them young,
and breeding them up to the ways of the service on board training
ships, is excellent, and lovers of the service, anxious to see it
above reproach, have only one serious fault to find with the
present routine. Men having been well trained, and having acquired
a fair knowledge of gunnery, are, in due course, sent to foreign
stations, where they are chiefly employed, year in, year out, in
painting and cleaning their ships, the least possible time allowed
by the Admiralty regulations being devoted to drill. As a
consequence of this, the best rifle team in a fleet on a foreign
station very often figures lowest in a rifle shooting match, and
British seamen and marines landed at foreign and colonial ports too
often suffer badly by comparison with foreigners, and even with
local volunteer forces. Many officers know this and lament it, but,
as they say, their men can beat the world at painting and brass
polishing! This weakness is, for obvious reasons, not so apparent
on the Mediterranean and Home stations, and it ought still less to
be seen further away.</p>

<p>From the merchant service, there being no longer need for
skilled seamen, the sailor, as a sailor, is rapidly disappearing.
The few British seamen still afloat are, as a rule, shamefully
lodged and fed, and, as a consequence, those men who are worth
anything either desert, or soon get employment in the better class
of steamship lines, there to forget their sailor-knowledge and
become what are now significantly known as "deck hands"&mdash;an
apt description of the unskilled labourers now usually carried on
steamers.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 364</p>-->

<p>Parents still pay premiums to shipowners for sending their sons
to sea to become officers in the merchant service. The indentures
of these lads set forth that the boys are to be taught the business
of the sea in return for the premium paid. The shipowners who
honestly carry out their part of the contract are so few, that most
people who know the merchant service well could name them off-hand.
The business, like that of paying for young men to obtain colonial
experience, is, in short, too often a swindle; yet it flourishes in
the face of frequent exposure. The late Thomas Gray, C.B.,
Assistant Secretary of the Board of Trade, did his best, in a
little book published some years ago, called <i>Under the Red
Ensign</i>, to warn parents against the absurdity of paying large
sums of money to shipowners, who, in return for the premiums,
employ educated boys of gentle breeding, in cleaning pigsties;
lodge and feed them worse than pauper cabin boys; work them day and
night beyond their strength; and at the end of four years'
service&mdash;supposing, as is too frequently the case, they have
not, meanwhile, deserted&mdash;turn them adrift so ignorant of
their trade that those who become officers almost invariably are
compelled to go to sea before the mast to learn seamanship, and to
spend weeks on shore at school, learning even the small amount of
navigation required to enable them to pass the Board of Trade for
second mates' certificates.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 365</p>-->

<p>The navigation laws, founded, it is said, by Richard I.,
imposing certain wise and unwise restrictions upon merchant
shipping, became clearly established in the reign of Charles II. as
an Act, among others of similar import, restricting the carrying of
goods to English ships, of which the master and three-fourths of
the crew were to be English. These, and similar laws, were
consolidated in 1833, and in the whole or part repealed by the Act
of 1849, which was passed, as its preamble set forth, "For the
Encouragement of British Shipping and Navigation."</p>

<p>Logic and figures prove that, since 1849, we have made such
strides, as carriers, as more than justifies the wisdom of the
legislature. But no amount of political sophistry can alter the
fact that the British merchant seaman is fast disappearing, and
that the ships of the greatest maritime nation in the world are
largely manned by foreigners. And a further unpleasant truth is the
wholesale desertion of seamen from our ships in all parts of the
world.</p>

<p>A British Board of Trade report, presented to the House of
Commons in 1899, containing information from our consuls at the
principal American, French, and other ports, and from all the
colonial governments, endeavours to supply information on the
subject. The primary cause of desertion in America is said to be
the boarding-master and his crimps, together with the higher rate
of wages ruling. Drink is assigned as the principal cause at
Marseilles. At the port of Melbourne, in addition to high wages,
the Local Department of Trade states that the poor and insufficient
food supplied on British sailing ships is the cause of 258 cases of
desertion, 132 of them British seamen, down to the year ending June
30, 1898. This is only half the truth. The real trouble, as is
known to every merchant sailor, comes of insufficient food,
atrocious lodging, and deliberate intent on the part of many
shipmasters, who make it a regular practice, to overwork and
generally ill-treat their men during the voyage, thus driving them
to desert at the first port of arrival, leaving their accrued wages
to go to the profits of the voyage, and saving the cost to the ship
of the maintenance of a crew while she is lying in harbour waiting
cargo.</p>

<p>In 1849, when the Navigation Laws were repealed, the shipping in
our home and foreign trade, exclusive of river steamers and similar
vessels, amounted in tonnage to a little more than three millions,
and in number of ships to 18,221; in a dozen years the number of
ships had increased by 2000, and the tonnage by 1,000,000; in 1871
there were 22,207 ships, and the tonnage of them exceeded
5,500,000; and now the British Empire, owning more than half the
tonnage of the world, owns 11,000 ships, of a total registered
tonnage of more than 13,500,000. In 1800 our tonnage amounted to
1,855,879, and our colonies have since then so grown, that the
Australian group alone, which, in 1822, owned only 163 tons of
shipping, now owns more than 500,000.</p>

<p>These figures are flattering to the national pride; but not so
the statistics relating to our seamen. In 1800 the 138,271 men who
manned our merchant ships could and did fight their country's
battles; not five per cent, of our merchant seamen to-day are of
the least use, beyond the value of unskilled labour, as crews for
our war-vessels.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 367</p>-->

<p>The number of officers, seamen, and marines provided for in the
estimates of 1898-99 was 106,390, of whom 18,000 were marines and
4200 coastguard. The strength of our naval reserve of merchant
seamen is about 27,000. In ten years we have increased the
complement of the Royal Navy to 40,000 men, and in the same period
we have added only 8000 men to the reserve. Strong in men as the
navy is, every man will be needed to man our fleet whenever we
engage in naval war, and the most sanguine believer in our prowess
cannot but have misgivings of what will happen when the inevitable
chances of war compel us to call for reserves to replace
casualties.</p>

<p>The skilled men-o'-warsmen of to-day differ from the men of the
wooden age, no less than the ships differ; the seamen-gunners of
the modern fleet have only become highly trained by many months of
careful work; and the fishermen and coasting seamen, who form such
a large portion of our small reserve, are a long way behind
efficiency in this respect. At the beginning of the century these
men, who more than any others fought our battles, learnt their
business in a week. The cutlass exercise, and the working of a
32-pounder, were then the only arts of war; at sail trimming, then
the chief duty of the sailor, they were in their element.</p>
<!--<p class="a">Page 368</p>-->

<p>English merchant seamen have been mostly driven out by
Scandinavians, who are just as good sailors, and are more sober,
obedient, and respectable than the average present-day forecastle
Englishmen. And for these reasons, when shipowners and politicians
assert that the foreigner is inevitable, it is very difficult to
contradict the assertion. A weak attempt has been made recently in
the House of Commons, at the expense of the shipowner, to improve
matters. This was in the direction of a suggestion to encourage
shipowners to carry British seamen, by excusing the owners some
portion of the light dues&mdash;a tax upon shipping that ought long
ago to have been charged against the public revenue. But not this
way lies the remedy.</p>

<p>In the great steamship lines belonging to France and Germany,
nearly every seaman on board is a trained man-o'-warsman, and the
companies are heavily subsidised. In our own great companies, a
subsidy, barely sufficient to pay for the added expense involved in
carrying mails and keeping up to time, holding ships at the
disposal of the Government, and many other conditions, is granted.
But in our steamers it is the exception, rather than the rule, to
see the blue ensign at the peak, denoting that ten per cent, of the
crew are naval reserve men, and one of our largest companies is
chiefly manned by lascars. In the great steamers of at least two
first-class foreign powers, the whole two hundred or more of each
ship's crew will, oftener than not, be found to be trained
men-o'-warsmen. There is only one way to alter this, which is to
recognise that if a naval reserve is needed, it must be paid for;
that steamship companies must be liberally subsidised, and in
return for the money, their ships must be compelled to carry
thoroughly well-drilled crews of naval reserve men.</p>

<p>Here ends my attempt to sketch the changes of a century. The
enormous increase in our floating wealth has, of course, brought
enormously increased anxiety and responsibility for its protection.
The wooden walls that were our bulwarks, and the race of seamen in
whom we put our trust, have gone for ever; there are those who
think that the new order of steam and steel, and seamen-gunners,
and stokers, has so levelled the nations as to threaten our empire
of the sea. To those who have such misgivings, it is solid comfort
to remember that the ocean is still, as when Shakespeare wrote, our
natural ally, and "Britain is a world by itself."</p>

<p class="newspaper">"The natural bravery of our isle which
stands,<br>
As Neptune's park, ribbed and paled in<br>
With rocks unscaleable, and roaring waters;<br>
With sands that will not bear your enemies' boats,<br>
But suck them up to the topmast. A kind of conquest<br>
Csesar made here, but made not here his brag<br>
Of "Came," "Saw," and "Overcame" with shame;<br>
(The first that ever touched him) he was carried<br>
From our coast twice beaten; and his shipping<br>
(Poor ignorant baubles!) on our terrible seas.<br>
Like egg-shells moved upon their surges, cracked<br>
As easily 'gainst our rocks."</p>
