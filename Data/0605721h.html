<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p>The "Leopold," a splendid Tuscan steamer plying between Marseilles
and Naples, had just doubled Procida Point. The passengers, cured of
their sea-sickness by the sight of land, most efficacious of all
remedies, were all out on deck. On the part reserved for the
first-class passengers, stood a number of Englishmen endeavoring to
get away as far as possible from each other and to trace around
themselves a circle none might venture to enter. Their splenetic
faces were carefully shaven, their cravats had not a wrinkle, their
shirt collars, white and stiff, looked like triangles of Bristol
board, their hands were protected by brand-new Suede gloves, and
their new boots shone with Lord Elliot's blacking. They looked as if
they had just emerged from one of the compartments of their
dressing-cases, for in their correct get-up there were visible none
of the little disorders of dress which are the usual consequences of
travel.</p>

<p>There were noblemen, members of Parliament, city merchants,
tailors from Regent Street, and cutlers from Sheffield, all proper,
grave, motionless, and bored. Nor were ladies wanting, for
Englishwomen are not sedentary like the women of other lands, and the
smallest pretext suffices to justify their leaving their island. By
the side of the great ladies and of the wives of commoners, somewhat
ripe beauties, with blotchy faces, bloomed, their faces half
concealed by their blue veils, maidens with complexions of milk and
roses, with shimmering golden tresses, and long white teeth,
recalling the favourite types of "Keepsakes," and proving that
english engravings are not so untrue to life as if often said. These
lovely creatures repeated, each in turn, with the most delightful
British accent, the obligatory "Vedi Napoli e poi mori;" perused
their Murray or wrote down their impressions of travel upon their
note-books, without paying the least attention to the glances of a
number of would-be Don Juans from Paris who roamed about in their
vicinity, while the angry mammas grumbled about French
impropriety.</p>

<p>On the edge of the aristocratic quater-deck, strolled, while
smoking their cigars, three or four young fellows whose straw or felt
hats, sack-coats with huge horn buttons, and duck trousers, made it
easy to recognise as artists, a fact confirmed by the mustaches a la
Rubens, or cropped short a la Paolo Veronese. Inspired by very
different motives they also were tying, like the dandies, to catch a
glimpse of the beauties whom their lack of wealth forbade their
approaching more closely, and these efforts somewhat interfered with
their enjoyment of the magnificent panorama outspread before
them.</p>

<p>In the bows of the vessel, leaning against the bulwarks or seated
on coils of rope, were grouped the third-class passengers, engaged in
consuming the provisions uneaten on account of the sea-sickness, and
casting not one glance upon the finest view in the world, for the
feeling of nature is the privilege of cultivated minds which are not
absorbed wholly by the material needs of life.</p>

<p>The weather was fine; the blue waves rolled broadly on with scarce
power enough to efface the ship's wake. The smoke from the funnel,
forming clouds in the glorious heavens, blew away softly in cottony
flakes, and the paddle-wheels, revolving in an iridescent diamond
spray, churned the water with joyous activity as if aware of the
proximity of the harbour.</p>

<p>Already the purple lines of hills that, from Posilipo to Vesuvius,
encircle the wondrous gulf at the upper end of which Naples lies like
a sea-nymph resting and drying herself after her bath, were becoming
more distinct and stood out more plainly against the brilliant azure
of the heavens. Already a few white spots, showing on the darker
background of the land, indicated the presence of towns scattered
along the countryside. The sails of the homeward-bound fishing-boats
slipped along the smooth blue waters like swans' feathers blown by
the breeze, and spoke of human activity upon the majestic solitude of
the sea.</p>

<p>Very soon the Castle of Saint-Elmo and the Convent di San Martino
came out distinctly on the crest of the mountain on which stands
Naples, showing about the domes of the churches, the terraces of the
hotels, the fronts of the palaces, and the verdure of the gardens,
that were yet but faintly visible through a luminous haze. Then the
Castello dell' Ovo, squatting on its foam-flecked reef, seemed to
approach the steamer, and the pier with its lighthouse drew near like
an arm holding a torch.</p>

<p>At the end of the bay, Vesuvius, now nearer, changed its blue
tints, due to distance, for more vigorous and solid tones; its sides
were seen to be furrowed with gullies and streams of lava grown cold,
and from it truncated cone, as from the holes of a perfume-burner,
plainly issued little jets of white smoke that wavered in the
wind.</p>

<p>Chiatamone, Pizzo Falcone, the hotel-bordered quay of santa Lucia,
the Palazzo Nuovo, flanked with its balconied towers, the Arsenal,
and ships of all nations, mingling their masts and spars like the
trees of a leafless wood, were plainly to be seen, when there emerged
from a cabin a passenger who hand not shown up once during the whole
trip, either because sea-sickness had kept him in confinement, or
because his reserve prevented his mingling with his
fellow-travellers, or again because the prospect, new to most of
them, had long been a familiar sight to him and had ceased to excite
his interest.</p>

<p>He was a young fellow of twenty-six, to twenty-eight years. At
least such was the age one felt tempted to give him at the first
glance, though when he was examined attentively he seemed to be
either younger or older, than that, so curiously mingled were
weariness and youthfulness upon his enigmatical countenance. His
hair, of that dark fairness called auburn by the English, shone in
the sunlight with coppery, metallic sheen, and in the shade seemed
almost black. His profile was clear cut, his brow would have called
forth the admiration of a phrenologist, thanks to its protuberances,
his nose was nobly aquiline, his lips well formed, and his chin had
that powerful roundness that recalls the medals of antiquity. Yet,
these various features, individually handsome, did not form an
agreeable whole. They lacked the mysterious harmony that softens
contours and makes them melt one into another. There is a legend of
an Italian painter who, seeking to represent the rebellious
archangel, composed a face of dissiimilar beauties and thus attained
an effect of terror far beyond what is possible by the use of horns,
arched eyebrows, and unholy grin. The stranger's face produced a
similar impression. His eyes, in particular, were extraordinary. The
black lashes that edged them contrasted with the pale gray colour of
the pupils and the auburn shade of hair; the thinness of the nose
caused them to look nearer each other than allowed by the rules of
drawing, and as for their expression it was quite undefinable. When
the young man's gaze did not consciously rest upon anything, it was
moist with vague melancholy and soft tenderness, but if he looked at
any one or anything, his brows bent, and formed a perpendicular
wrinkle on this forehead; the pupils lost their gray colour and
turned green, spotted with black spots and striated with yellow
lines; his glance then flashed sharply, almost painfully, after which
he would resume his former placidity, and from a Mephistophelian
individual turn into a young man of the world--member of the Jockey
club, if you like--on his way to spend the season in Naples, and glad
to step on a lava floor less mobile than the "Leopold's" deck.</p>

<p>His dress was elegant and did not draw the eye by any striking
details, He wore a dark blue frock coat, a black cravat with polka
dots, which was tied in a way that avoided both carelessness and over
carefulness; a waistcoat of the same pattern as the tie, a pair of
light gray trousers, and neat boots. His gold watch chain was of the
plainest pattern, and the cord of his eye-glasses was of silk,
tressed flat. In his well-gloved hand he carried a slender cane, made
of a twisted vine-stem, mounted in sliver.</p>

<p>He took a few steps along the deck, his glance wandering idly over
the shore, now drawing closer, and on which one could see the
carriages driving along, the people crowding and the collecting of
those groups of idlers to whom the arrival of a stage-coach or a
steamer is an ever interesting and ever novel sight, even though they
have gazed upon it a thousand times.</p>

<p>Already a flotilla of boats and other craft was starting for the
quay, with the intention of boarding the "Leopold." They bore
waiters, guides, facchini and other assorted samples of the rabble
which is accustomed to look upon strangers as its natural prey. The
various craft were rowing hard in order to be the first to reach the
ship, and, as usual, the crews were exchanging insults in a loud tone
of voice fit to terrify people unused to the manners and customs of
the lower classes in Naples.</p>

<p>The auburn haired young man had, in order to grasp more readily
the details of the prospect unrolled before him, put on his
eye-glasses, but his attention, distracted from the sublime prospect
of the bay by the concert of yells that rose from the flotilla, was
drawn to the boats. No doubt he was annoyed at the noise, for his
brows bent, the wrinkle on his brow became marked, and his gray eyes
turned yellowish.</p>

<p>An unexpected billow, running in from sea, with a fringe of foam
on its crest, passed under the steamer which it raised and let fall
again heavily, broke on the quay in blinding spray, wetted the
promenaders surprised by the suddenness of the douche, and with its
backwash dashed the boats together so roughly that a number of
facchini fell overboard. The accident had no serious consequences,
for the rascals swam like fishes or marine deities, and reappeared a
few seconds later, with the salt water running out of their mouths
and their ears, their hair plastered against their temples, and
assuredly as much astonished at the unexpected dive as was
Telemachus, the son of Ulysses, when Minerva, under the guise of the
sage Mentor, threw him into the sea from the top of a rock in order
to withdraw him from the love of Eucharis.</p>

<p>At a respectful distance behind the strange traveler, there stood
by a pile of trunks a small groom, a sort of old man of fifteen, a
liveried gnome, who looked like one of the dwarfs whom the Chinese
patiently bring up in porcelain jars to prevent their growing. His
flat face, on which the nose scarcely showed, seemed to have been
compressed in earliest childhood, and his protruding eyes had the
sweetness of look which certain naturalists attribute to the toad's
eye. Neither his chest nor his back was deformed, and though one
would in vain have looked for a hump on him, he gave the impression
of being a hunchback. In a word, he was a very proper groom, who
might have ridden at Ascot or Chantilly without first going into
training; his queer looks would have determined any gentleman-rider
to engage him on the spot. He was repulsive, but irreproachable in
his own way, like his master.</p>

<p>The passengers landed, and, with their luggage, fell a prey to the
porters after the latter had exchanged insults that were more than
Homeric, and proceeded to the various hotels with which Naples is
abundantly provided.</p>

<p>The traveler with the eye-glasses and his groom went to the Hotel
de Rome, followed by a numerous company of robust facchini who
pretended to groan and sweat under the burden of a hat-box or a small
parcel, guilelessly expecting a heavy tip, which four or five of
their comrades, who exhibited muscles as powerful as those of the
"Hercules" so much admired in the Studj, pushed a handcart on which
had been placed two trunks of moderate size and equally moderate
weight.</p>

<p>When the hotel was reached and the padron di casa had shown the
newcomer to his apartment, the porters, although they had received
about three times their legal fare, indulged in the most frantic
gesticulations and in speeches in which supplications and threats
were mingled in the most comical fashion, all shouting at one and the
same time with terrific volubility, claiming additional pay and
swearing by all that was holy that they had not been sufficiently
rewarded for their exertions. Paddy, who had to face them alone,--for
his master, unheeding the noise, had already gone upstairs--looked
like a monkey surrounded by a pack of hounds. In order to still the
tumult, he attempted to harangue in his mother tongue, that is, in
English, but his speech proved unacceptable. Then, closing his fists
and placing his arms breast high, he assumed, to the great hilarity
of the facchini, a very correct boxing attitude, and with a blow
straight from the shoulder, worthy of Adams or Tom Cribb, he landed
on the breadbasket of the biggest fellow in the crowd, and sent him
flying heels over head on the lava pavement.</p>

<p>This exploit put the rabble to flight; the hulking fellow picked
himself up with difficulty, feeling very sore, and, without seeking
to have his revenge on Paddy, went off with endless contortions,
rubbing with his hand the blue-black mark that was already showing on
his skin, and convinced that a devil must be hiddn under the jacket
of the monkey-like groom, who looked as if he were fit to ride
nothing bigger than a dog and as if a breath of wind would blow him
away.</p>

<p>The stranger, having summoned the padron di casa, asked him if any
letters had come for Mr. Paul d'Aspremont. The hotel-keeper replied
that a letter so addressed had been lying for a week in the
letter-rack, and he hastened to fetch the epistle. The letter,
enclosed in a thick envelope of blue cream laid paper, and sealed
with aventurine sealing-wax, was addressed in a sloping, angular hand
with cursive strokes, denoting a high aristocratic education, and
common, too uniformly perhaps, to English young ladies of good
family.</p>

<p>The contents of the note, which Mr. d'Aspremont opened with an
eagerness due apparently to something more than mere curiously, were
as follows:---</p>

<p>"Dear Mr. Paul,--We reached Naples two months ago, travelling by
short stages. Uncle complained bitterly of the heat, the mosquitoes,
the wine, the butter, the beds. He swore he must have been crazy to
leave his comfortable home near London, to travel on dusty roads
lined with wretched inns, in which no decent English dog would
consent to pass the night; but, for all his grumbling, he accompanied
me and I could have taken him to the world's end. He is none the
worse for his trip, and I am a great deal better. We have settled
down on the sea-shore, in a whitewashed house hidden in a sort of
virgin forest of orange, lime, myrtle, and rose laurel trees, and
other exotic plants. From our terrace we have a wonderful view, and
every afternoon you will find there a cup of tea or a glass of
lemonade, whichever you may prefer. Uncle, whom you have fascinated,
I know not how, will be delighted to see you again; and need I add
that I shall not be sorry to do so either, although you did cut my
fingers with you ring when you bade us good-bye on the pier at
Folkstone?</p>

<p>"Alicia W."</p>

<h3>Chapter Two</h3>

<p>Paul d'Aspremont, after he had dined in his room called for a
carriage. There are always plenty of them round the large hotels on
the look-out for travellers, so that his wish was at once gratified.
By the side of Neapolitan cab horse, Rosinante itself would seem in
excellent condition; their skinny heads, their ribs showing like the
hoops of a barrel, their protruding backbones, always raw, seem to
implore as a kindness the knacker's knife, for the careless
Southerner deems it a piece of needless attention to feed animals.
The harness, usually broken, is mended with bits of cord, and when
the coachman has gathered up his reins and calls on his horses to
start, one feels sure that the horses will vanish into thin air and
the vehicle disappear in smoke, after the manner of Cinderella's
carriage when she returned from the ball after midnight, contrary to
the fairy's orders. But it is not so; the poor brutes stiffen their
limbs, and after a few struggles, start on a gallop which they keep
up steadily. The coach man inspires them with his own ardour, and the
lash of his whip brings out the last spark of life concealed within
their skeleton frames. They prance, throw their heads up and down,
try to look spirited, open their eyes and their nostrils, and go at a
pace that the fastest English trotters could not equal. To what this
phenomenon is due, and what is the mysterious power than enables dead
animals to gallop at full speed, I cannot explain, but the fact is
patent that this miracle is of daily occurrence in Naples and that no
one is in the least surprised at it.</p>

<p>Mr. Paul d'Aspremont's carriage was flying through the dense
crowd, shaving the citron-wreathed acquajoli shops, the open-air
stalls of vendors of stews and macaroni, the fishmongers' stalls, and
the heaps of water-melons ranged on the highway like piles of
cannonballs in an artillery park. Scarcely did the lazzaroni, lying
along the walls wrapped up in their mantles, deign to draw their legs
out of the way of the equipages. From time to time a corricolo, with
its great scarlet wheels, dashed past bearing a crowd of monks,
nurses, facchini, and ragamuffins, and scraping the wheels of
d'Aspremont's carriage in the mist of a cloud of dust and noise.
Corricoli are now proscribed, and it is forbidden to build any new
ones, but it is permitted to put a new body on an old pair of wheels,
or to fit new wheels to an old body, an ingenious method which will
enable these quaint vehicles to last a long time yet, to the great
delight of amateurs of local colour.</p>

<p>Our traveller, however, paid but scant attention to the animated
and picturesque sights that would certainly have attracted any
tourist who had not found awaiting him at the Hotel de rome a note
addressed to him and signed "Alicia W." He looked with inattentive
gaze at the blue, limpid sea, on which could be made out, in a
brilliant light, and coloured by distance with amethyst and sapphire
tints, the lovely isles scattered in the fan shape at the entrance of
the bay: Capri, Ischia, Nisida, Procida, the harmonious names of
which resound like Greek dactyls. But his soul was not there; it was
flying away in the direction of Sorrento, towards the little white
house nestling in the greenery, and spoken of by Alicia in her
note.</p>

<p>At this moment d'Aspremont's face had not the indefinably
unpleasant expression it bore when some inward joy did not harmonise
its dissonant perfections. It was positively handsome and
sympathetic, as the Italians are fond of saying. The corners of his
mouth were not drawn down disdainfully, and his quiet eyes were
filled with tender light. It was easy to understand, on seeing him
thus, the feelings from him apparently indicated by the half tender,
half mocking words on the cream laid paper. His individuality, backed
up by his high breeding, must have proved attractive to a young girl
brought up with much freedom in the English fashion by an old and
very indulgent uncle.</p>

<p>Thanks to the pace at which the coachman drove his horses, Chiaja
and La Marinella were soon left behind, and the carriage drove
through the open country on a road now replaced by a railway line.
Black dust, like triturated coal, imparts a Plutonian aspect to the
whole of this shore, over which shines a dazzling sky and which is
laved by a sea of the loveliest azure. It is the soot of Vesuvius,
sifted by the wind, that dusts the beach and makes the houses of
Portici and Torre del Greco look like Birmingham factories. But
d'Aspremont did not concern himself with the contrast between the
ebon earth and the sapphire heaves; he was in too great a hurry to
reach his destination. The finest roads are long when a Miss Alicia
is waiting for one at the end of them, and when it is six months
since one parted from her on the pier at Folkestone. The sky and the
sea of Naples fail to work their spell under these circumstances.</p>

<p>The carriage left the highway, turned down a cross-road, and drew
up in front of a gate formed of two whitewashed brick pillars,
surmounted with vases in terra cotta, in which bloomed aloes with
leaves like tin and sharp as daggers. It was closed by an open-work
green-painted swinging gate, the angular stems of which had
inextricably interlaced their thorny fronds. Above the hedge, three
or four huge fig-trees spread out their broad metallic leaves in
compact masses, growing vigorously like African vegetation. A great
umbrella pine waved its crown of leaves, and one could scarcely make
out, through the luxuriant growth, the white facade of the house
gleaming in spots behind the thick curtain of foliage.</p>

<p>A dark-complexioned servant, with curling hair so thick that it
would have broken a comb, hastened up at the sound of the wheels,
opened the gate, and, walking in front of Mr. d'Aspremont down a rose
laurel walk, the blooms of which caressed his cheeks, led him to the
terrace where Miss Alicia was having tea with her uncle.</p>

<p>Yielding to a very justifiable caprice in a young lady, tired of
comfort and elegance, and mayhap also to tease her uncle, whose
commonplace tastes she made fun of, Miss Alicia had chosen, in
preference to a more civilised dwelling, this villa, the owners of
which were travelling, and which had remained uninhabited for a
number of years. She found in this abandoned garden, that had almost
returned to a state of nature, a wild poetry that pleased her; in the
quickening Neaopolitan climate everything had grown with prodigious
activity. Orange trees and myrtles, pomegranates and lime trees had
thoroughly enjoyed themselves, and not having the fear of the
gardener's pruning-knife before their eyes, had clasped hands across
the walk from one end to the other, or penetrated familiarly into the
rooms wherever there was a broken pane. The place did not have the
sad look of a deserted Northern abode, but was marked by the mad joy
and happy carelessness of Southern nature left to itself. In the
owner's absence, the exuberant vegetation had indulged in the debauch
of leaves, flowers, fruits, and scents, and re-conquered the ground
man had deprived it of.</p>

<p>When the Commodore, for so Alicia familiarly called her uncle, saw
the impenetrable thicket, through which a machete was needed to cut a
way, he broke out into the liveliest remonstrances and swore his
niece was crazy. But Alicia gravely promised to have cut from the
entrance-door to the drawing-room and from the drawing-room to the
terrace a passage wide enough for the bringing in of a butt of
Malmsey wine, this being the only concession she would grant to her
uncle's positivism. The Commodore had to give in, for he could never
resist his niece, and at this very time he was on the terrace, seated
opposite to her, sipping a big glass of rum, which he called tea.</p>

<p>The terrace, which had mainly attracted the young lady, was, in
point of fact, very picturesque and merits the detailed description,
for paul d'Aspremont will often return to it, and one ought to paint
the setting of the scenes one describes.</p>

<p>The terrace, the precipitous walls of which overhung a hollow
road, was reached by steps formed of broad disjointed stones, between
the interstices of which grew luxuriantly vigorous wild plants. Four
broken pillars, brought from some antique ruin, their lost capitals
replaced by square stones, support a trellis of poles intertwined and
covered with vines. From the parapet fell in sheets and wreaths wall
plants and wild vines. At the foot of the walls Indian figs, aloes,
and arbutus grew in delightful disorder, while beyond a wood topped
by a palm tree and three Italian pines, the view extended over
rolling ground on which were scattered while villas, embrace the
violet outlines of Vesuvius, or was prolonged over the blue distance
of the sea.</p>

<p>When Paul d'Aspremont appeared at the top of the steps, Alicia
rose with an exclamation of pleasure, and came forward to meet him.
Paul shook hands with her in English fashion, but the young lady
raised her prisoned hand to the lips of her friend with a motion full
of youthful grace and ingenuous coquetry.</p>

<p>The Commodore tried to raise himself on his gouty legs, and
managed to do so after a few grimaces due to pain, which contrasted
comically with the look of delight that illumined his broad face. He
approached, alertly enough for him, the two young people, and grasped
Paul's hand in a way to crush his fingers against each other, which
is the highest outward mark of good British cordiality.</p>

<p>Miss Alicia Ward belonged to that class of English brunettes who
realise an ideal of the very conditions of which seem to be
irreconcilable; that is a skin so dazzlingly fair as to make milk,
snow, lilies, alabaster, virgin wax, and whatever poets use by way of
comparisons of whiteness, look almost yellow by the side of it,
cherry lips, and hair as black as the darkness of night on a raven's
wing. The effect of this contrast is irresistible, and results in a
singular loveliness which has no equivalent. It may be that some
Circassians, brought up in the Seraglio from childhood possess the
same wonderful complexion, but on this point I have no information to
go by save the exaggerations of Oriental poetry and the water-colour
painting by Lewis that represent the harems of Cairo. Alicia was
assuredly the most perfect type of this style of beauty.</p>

<p>The long oval of her face, her incomparably pure complexion, her
well-shaped, delicate, transparent nose, her dark blue eyes fringed
with long lashes that fluttered on her rosy cheeks like black
butterflies when she lowered her eyelids, her lips coloured with
dazzling crimson, her hair falling in long, shimmering ringlets like
satin ribbons on either side of her face and of her swan-like neck,
testified in favour of the romantic female faces by Maclise which, at
the Universal Exhibition, looked like delightful impostures.</p>

<p>She wore a flounced grenadine dress, the flounces themselves
festooned and embroidered with red sprigs that harmonised wonderfully
well with the small grained strings of coral that formed her
head-dress, her necklace, and her bracelets. Five pendants, hung from
a facetted coral pearl, quivered in each of her small, delicately
convoluted ears. If the reader feels like blaming this wealth of
coral, let him remember that he is in Naples, where the fishermen
come up out of the sea on purpose to present you with these branches
that the air turns red.</p>

<p>I owe that reader of mine, were it but by way of contrast to the
portrait of Alicia which I have just drawn, at the very least a
Hogarthian caricature of her uncle.</p>

<p>The Commodore, who was some sixty years old, was noticeable for
his uniformly crimson face, on which stood out his white eyebrows and
mutton-chop whiskers, so that he looked like an old redskin tattooed
with chalk. Sunstrokes, unavoidable on a trip to Italy, had added a
few more layers to that ardent colouring. He was dressed from head to
foot, jacket, waistcoat, trousers and gaiters, in a reddish-gray
vicuna, which no doubt his tailor had assured him was the most
fashionable shade and that most worn, wherein perchance he lied not.
Yet, in spite of his brilliant complexion and his eccentric dress,
the commodore looked by no means vulgar. His thorough cleanliness,
his irreproachable neatness and his fine manner pointed him out as a
perfect gentleman, even though he had more than one external
resemblance to the Englishmen in farces which Hoffmann and Levassor
are fond of parodying. As for his character, he adored his niece and
drank much port and wine and Jamaica rum to keep up the humid root,
after the manner of corporal Trim.</p>

<p>"See how well I am now, and how lovely! Look at my colour; I am
not yet up to uncle, and I hope I shall never be. But I have roses
here, real roses," said Alicia, as she drew across her cheek a
slender finger tipped with a nail polished as agate. "I have grown
stouter, too, and those horrid salt-cellars that caused me so much
trouble when I went to balls have vanished. Now, must not a woman be
a coquette to part with her lover for three months, so that at the
end of the time he may find her blooming and splendid!"</p>

<p>As she spoke this tirade in the playful and sparkling tone
familiar to her, Alicia stood before Paul as if to challenge him to
examine her.</p>

<p>"She is as robust and full of health now," added the Commodore,
"as those Procida girls who carry amphorae on their heads, is she
not?</p>

<p>"Unquestionably, Commodore," answered Paul; "it was impossible for
Alicia to be more lovely, but she is plainly in better health than
when, through coquetry, as she claims, she compelled me to endure a
painful separation."</p>

<p>As he said this, his glance rested with strange fixity upon the
young girl who stood before him. Suddenly the lovely rosy flush she
had boasted of having acquired faded from Alicia's cheeks as the
flush of evening fades from the snowy mountain slopes when the sun
sinks in the west. Trembling all over, she put her hand to her heart,
and her lovely lips paled and were contracted with pain.</p>

<p>Paul, much alarmed, rose, as did the Commodore. Alicia's bright
colour had returned, though her smile still cost her an effort.</p>

<p>"I promised you a cup of tea or a sherbet, and, although I am
English, I advise you to have the sherbet. Snow is better than hot
water in this country, so near to Africa that the sirocco comes
straight from it."</p>

<p>The three sat down round the stone table, under the vine-leaf
bower. The sun had sunk into the sea, and the azure day, called night
in Naples, followed the golden day. The moon scattered slivery spots
upon the terrace through the interstices of the foliage; the sea
rippled with kissing sound upon the beach, and from a distance came
the sound of the tambourines that accompanied the tarantella.</p>

<p>By and by paul had to take his leave. Vice, the dark-complexioned,
wavy-haired maid, came with a lantern to show Paul his way through
the mazes of the garden. While serving the sherbet and snow water,
she had fized [sic] upon the new-comer a glance in which curiosity
was mingled with fear. Doubtless the result of this examination had
been unfavourable to Paul, for Vice's brow, already as brown as a
cigar, had darkened still more, and as she accompanied the stranger,
she directed towards him, but so that he should not notice it, her
first and fourth fingers, while the other two, folded back under the
palm met the thumb as if to form some cabalistic sign.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<p>Alicia's friend returned to the Hotel de Rome by the same road he
had come. The night was incomparably beautiful; the bright, splendid
moon cast upon the diaphanous blue waters a long trail of silvery
spangles, the perpetual motion of which, due to the lipping of the
wavelets, increased their brilliancy. In the offing, the fishing
boats, each bearing in the bows an iron cradle filled with lighted
tow, studded the sea with read stars and left ruddy wakes behind
them. The smoke from Vesuvius, white by day, had changed into a
pillar of fire and also cast its reflection upon the bay, that, at
his moment, had that appearance which strikes Northern eyes as
improbable, and which it has in those Italian water-colours, in the
black frames, so widespread a few years ago, and which were more
accurate than one would have supposed, judging by their crude
exaggeration.</p>

<p>A few noctambulistic lazzaroni still mooned about the beach,
unconsciously moved the the wondrous prospect, and looked out into
the blue distance with their great black eyes. Others, seated on the
rail of some boat hauled up on the shore, were singing the aria from
"Lucia" or the then popular romance, "Ti voglio ben' assai," in a
voice that many a highly paid tenor would have envied. Naples sits up
late, like all southern cities, yet the lights in the windows were
going out one by one, and only the lottery offices, with their
coloured paper decorations, their favourite numbers, and their bright
lights, remained open, ready to receive the money of capricious
gambles who, as they wended homeward, might be seized with the fancy
of wagering a few carlini or a few ducats upon some number they had
dreamed of.</p>

<p>Paul turned in, drew the gauze mosquito-netting about his bed, and
speedily fell asleep. As happens to travellers after a sea trip, his
couch, though motionless, seemed to him to pitch, scend, and roll,
just as if the Hotel de rome had been the "Leopold." This feeling
caused him to dream that he was still at sea, and that on the pier he
saw Alicia, looking very pale by the side of her red-faced uncle,
signing to him not to land. The face of the young girl expressed deep
grief, and she seemed, as she motioned him back, to be obeying much
against her will some imperious fatality.</p>

<p>The dream, to which recent images lent extraordinary reality, so
troubled the sleeper that he awoke, and he was glad to find himself
in his room, in which quivered the opaline reflections of a
night-light that illumined a small porcelain tube round which the
mosquitoes buzzed and swarmed. In order not again to have such a
painful dream, Paul struggled against sleep and began to think of the
beginning of his acquaintance with Alicia, going over, one after
another, the innocently charming scenes of first love.</p>

<p>He saw again the red brick house in Richmond, covered with rose
and honeysuckle, where dwelt Alicia and her uncle, and to which he
had gone, on his first visit to england, with one of those letter of
introduction the sole result of which is usually and invitation to
dinner. He recalled the white Indian muslin dress, with a single
ribbon for sole ornament, which Alicia, who had just left
boarding-school, wore on that day, and the spray of jasmine which
twined in the wealth of her hair like a floweret from Ophelia's
wreath borne away by the stream, her velvet blue eyes and her half
opened mouth which allowed a glimpse of her pearly teeth, her slender
neck that turned like that of a bird whose attention is awakened, and
her sudden blush when the glance of the young French gentleman met
hers.</p>

<p>The dark wainscotted sitting-room, hung with green cloth, and
adorned with fox-hunting scenes and steeple-chasing incidents,
coloured in the crude English way, came up in his mind as in a camera
obscura. There was the piano with its row of keys like the set of
teeth of some old dowager. Under the mantelpiece, round which grew a
spray of ivy, shone the black-leaded grate; he could see the oaken
arm-chairs, covered with morocco, the carpet with its rose pattern,
and Alicia, trembling like a leaf, singing in the most adorably
out-of-tune voice, the romance from "Anna Bolena," "deb, non voler
costringere," while he, not less moved than she, accompanied her,
entirely out of time, and the Commodore, dozing in slow digestion,
and redder than ever, let slip to the ground a bulky "Times" and it
"Supplement."</p>

<p>Then the scene changed. Paul, who had been admitted to the
intimacy of the family, was invited by the commodore to spend a few
days in their Lincolnshire home. An old feudal castle, with
crenelated towers and Gothic windows, half-covered with ivy, but
arranged internally with all modern comforts, rose at the end of the
lawn, the turf of which, carefully watered and rolled, was smooth as
velvet. Round the sward ran a sanded walk, which served Alicia for a
riding-ground, and on which she cantered on one of the wild-maned
Scottish ponies, which Sir Edward Landseer love to pain, and to which
he give an almost human glance. Paul, mounted on a bright bay lent
him the the Commodore, accompanied her on her circular ride; for the
physician, who found her lungs rather weak, had ordered her to take
exercise.</p>

<p>Or again a light boat glided over the pond, brushing aside the
water lilies and sending the kingfishers scurrying away to the refuge
of the silvery willows. Alicia rowed and Paul held the yoke-lines.
How lovely she looked in the golden halo formed round her head by the
sunbeams that shone through her straw hat! She pulled her oars well
back, pressing the tip of her gray shoe against the thwart. Alicia's
foot was not short and round like a smoothing iron, the Andalusion
shape so much admired in Spain; she had a neatly turned ankle, a high
instep, and if the sole of her shoe was a shade long, it was not two
inches wide.</p>

<p>The Commodore remained on shore,--not that his rank kept him
there, but his weight, which would have proved too much for the light
craft. He waited for his niece at the landing-place, and carefully
wrapped her in a mantle, lest she should take cold; then the boat
having been made fast to the mooring post, the trio returned to the
castle to lunch. It was delightful to see Alicia, who usually ate no
more than a wren, put her pearly teeth into a slice of York ham cut
thin as paper, and make away with a roll without leaving a single
crumb for the gold fish in the basin.</p>

<p>How swiftly pass away happy days! Every week Paul postponed his
departure; the glorious foliage in the park began to wear the russet
livery of autumn, and light white mists rose in the morning from the
lake. In spite of the constant raking in which the gardener indulged,
the dead leaves strewed the gravel of the drive; innumerable little
pearls of frost glittered upon the sward of the bowling green, and in
the evening the magpies might be seen squabbling in the tops of the
leafless trees.</p>

<p>Paul's anxious gaze saw Alicia growing paler, and her colour
diminish to two little spots on her cheeks, she often felt chilly,
and the hottest coral fire failed to warm her. The doctor seemed
anxious, and his last prescription was to the effect that Alicia must
spend the winter in Pisa and the spring in Naples.</p>

<p>Paul had been recalled to France by family affairs; Alicia and the
Commodore were on their way to Italy, and the party had separated at
Folkestone. No word had been spoken, but Alicia looked on herself as
engaged to paul, and the Commodore had squeezed his hand in
significant fashion. It is only a son-in-law's fingers that one
squeezes so unmercifully.</p>

<p>Paul, compelled to wait six long months, which to his impatience
seemed six centuries, had had the delight of finding Alicia freed
from the languor from which she had been suffering, and radiant with
health. The child had made way wholly to the maiden, and he though
with intoxicating happiness that the Commodore would raise no
objection when he should ask for her hand.</p>

<p>Lulled by these pleasant thoughts, he fell asleep and slept until
day. Naples was already beginning its riot of noise; the sellers of
iced water were shouting their ware; the keepers of cook-shops held
out to the passers-by meats stuck on poles; bending from their
windows, the lazy housekeepers lowered with a string their market
baskets, which they drew up again laden with provisions, tomatoes,
fish, and great pieces of pumpkin. The public scriveners, in rusty
black coats and a pen behind their ear, sat down at their tables; the
money changers were arranging in little piles, on their boards,
grani, carlini, and ducats; the coachmen drove their skeleton horses
at a gallop in quest of early customers, and the bells in every
belfry were joyously ringing out eh Angelus.</p>

<p>Paul, wrapped in his dressing-gown, leaned on the rail of the
balcony. From his window he could see Santa Lucia Castello dell' Ove,
and an immense stretch of sea as far as Mount Vesuvius and the blue
promontory on which showed white the vast casini of Castellamare and
the distant villas of Sorrento. The sky was free from clouds, save on
light fleck that drew nearer the city, driven onwards by a faint
breeze. Paul fixed upon it that strange glance to which I have before
drawn attention. Forthwith other vapours united with the single
cloudlet, and soon a dark pall of cloud stretched out over Castle
Saint Elmo. Great drops of rain pattered down upon the lava pavement,
and in a few minutes turned into on of the torrential rains which
transform the streets of Naples into torrents, and sweep dogs, and
even donkeys into the gutters. The surprised multitude of pedestrians
scattered in search of shelter; the open-air stalls moved in haste,
not without the loss of of a part of their wares, and the rain, left
in possession of the battle-field swept in white gusts upon the
deserted quay of Santa Lucia.</p>

<p>The huge facchino whom Paddy had smitten with such vigour, and who
as leaning under a balcony, somewhat sheltered by eh projection, had
not joined the universal rout and gazed with deeply meditative glance
upon the window whereon Paul d'Aspremont was leaning.</p>

<p>His thoughts found expression in words which he grumbled out with
an angry look:---</p>

<p>"The skipper of the 'Leopold' would have done better to chuck that
forestiere overboard."</p>

<p>And putting his hand into the opening of his coarse linen shirt,
he touched the bag of amulets hung round his neck by a string.</p>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<p>The weather speedily cleared, in a few minutes the bright sunshine
had dried the last drips of the shower, and the multitude again
swarmed joyously upon the quay. But Timberio, the porter, seemed not
to change his opinion of the young Frenchman, and prudently
transported his penates beyond the range of the hotel windows. When
some lazzaroni of his friends expressed surprise at his giving up a
good stand in favour of one much less advantageous, he replied,
shaking his head with a look of mystery:--</p>

<p>"Whoever wants it can have it; I know what I know."</p>

<p>Paul breakfasted in his room either through reserve or disdain,
for he did not care to mix with the public. Then he dressed, and
while waiting until it was time for him to call on Miss Ward, he
visited the Studj Museum. He admired rather inattentively the
valuable collection of Campanian vases, the bronzes found in the
ruins of Pompeii, the verdigrised brazen Greek helmet which still
contains the head of the soldier that wore it, the piece of hardened
mud that has preserved, like a mould, the imprint of the lovely torso
of a young woman surprised by the eruption of Vesuvius in the country
house of Arrius Diomedes, the Farnese of Hercules and his wonderful
muscles, the Flora, the archaic Minerva, the two Balbi, and the
magnificent statue of Aristides, the most perfect work perhaps that
antiquity has handed down to us. But a lover is not one to appreciate
very enthusiastically the monuments of art; to him, the least glimpse
of the beloved head is worth more than all the marbles of Greece and
Rome.</p>

<p>Having managed somehow to wear out two or three hours in the
Studj, he sprang into a carriage and started for the country house
where dwelt Miss Ward. The coachman, with the quick perception of
love that is characteristic of Southern natures, drove his Rosinantes
at break-neck speed, and soon the carriage drew up in front of the
pillars, surmounted by vases with aloes growing in them, that I have
already described. The same servant came to open the gate; her hair
still curled rebelliously, and, as before, her dress consisted simply
of a coarse linen chemise with coloured thread embroideries on the
sleeves and round the neck, and of a skirt of thick stuff, with
transversal stripes, such as is worn by the women of Procida. Her
legs, I must own were bare, and she trod the dust with feet that a
sculptor would have admired. On her breast hung from a black cord a
bundle of curiously shaped charms of horn and coral, on which, to
Vice's evident satisfaction, Paul's glance rested.</p>

<p>Miss Alicia was on the terrace, that being her favourite spot. An
Indian hammock, of red and blue cotton, ornamented with feathers, was
suspended from two of the pillars that supported the vine-leaf roof,
and in it was swinging the young girl, dressed in a light wrapper of
ecru China silk, the accordion pleats of which she was pitilessly
crushing. On her feet, the tips of which showed through the netting
of the hammock, she wore slipper of aloe fibre, and her lovely bare
arms were crossed above her head in the attitude of the Cleopatra of
antiquity, for, although it was only the beginning of May, the heat
was already extreme, and innumerable crickets were singing in shrill
chorus in the neighbouring bushes.</p>

<p>The Commodore, in planter's dress, and seated on the cane
arm-chair, pulled with great regularity the rope that set the hammock
swinging, and the group was completed by a third personage, Count
d'Altavilla, a young Neapolitan dandy, whose presence caused Paul's
brows to contract in the fashion that gave him an expression of
diabolical wickedness.</p>

<p>The Count, indeed, was one of those men whom one does not much
care to see by the side of the woman one loves. He was of high
stature and perfectly proportioned; his hair, as black as jet, and
clustering thick masses, set off his smooth and well-shapen forehead;
the brilliant Neapolitan sun sparkled in this eyes, and his large,
strong teeth, clears as pearls, shone the brighter by contrast with
his crimson lips and his olive complexion. The one objection which a
person of fastidious taste could have made to the Count was that he
was too handsome.</p>

<p>As for his clothes, d'Altavilla sent to London for them, and the
severest dandy would have approved of his get-up. The one Italian
touch in his whole dress was his shirt studs, which were too costly
and showy, betraying the Southerner's love of jewelry. It may be also
that anywhere but in Naples people might have thought it in bad taste
for him to be wearing a collection of bifurcated branches of coral,
of hands, in Vesuvius lava, with closed fingers or brandished dagger,
of dogs lying down with outstretched paws, of bits of horn, black or
white, and other similar trifles suspended from his watch chain by a
ring but it needed only a turn down the Strada di Toledo (Via di
Roma), or along the Villa Reale to ascertain that the wearing of
these charms was not a mark of eccentricity on the Count's part.</p>

<p>When Paul d'Aspremont came up, the Count, as Miss Ward's urgent
request was singing one of those exquisite Neapolitan popular airs,
whose author is nameless, and a single one of which picked up by a
composer, suffices to secure the success of an opera. Gordigiani's
charming romances may give some idea of them to those who have not
heard such airs sung by a lazzarone, a fisherman, or a trovatella on
the Chiaja beach or on the pier. They are composed of the sigh of the
breeze, a moonbeam, the scent of an orange tree and the beating of
the heart.</p>

<p>Alicia, with her pretty English voice, which was not quite true,
hummed the motive, that she wished to remember, and nodded in
friendly fashion to Paul, who, annoyed at the presence of the
handsome young man, looked at her with no very amiable glance.</p>

<p>One of the cords of the hammock broke, and Miss Ward slipped to
the ground, through without hurting herself, and six hands were
simultaneously outstretched towards her. The young lady was already
up, blushing rosy red, for it is "improper" to fall when men are
present. Yet not one of the chaste folds of her dress was
disarranged.</p>

<p>"I do not understand it," said the Commodore; "I tested the ropes
myself, and Alicia is light as a feather."</p>

<p>Count d'Altavilla shook his head in a mysterious fashion, and
though it was plain that he attributed the breaking of the rope to a
very different cause than Miss Ward's weight, he kept silence, like a
well-bred man that he was, and contented himself with rattling the
bunch of charms on his chain.</p>

<p>Like all men who turn sulky and cross when in the company of a
rival they fear may prove dangerous, instead of becoming more
gracious and amiable, Paul d'Aspremont, although well used to
society, could not manage to conceal his ill-temper. He replied in
monosyllables, let the conversation fall, and when he looked at
d'Altavilla, his glance assumed its sinister expression, and the
yellow streaks twisted and writhed under the gray transparency of his
eyes like water-snakes in a spring.</p>

<p>Every time Paul looked at him in that way, the Count, with a
gesture apparently mechanical, plucked a flower from the jardiniere
that stood near him and threw it in such a way that it should cross
the direction of the angry glance.</p>

<p>"What are you ravaging my jardiniere for?" exclaimed Miss Ward,
who observed his action. "What harm have my poor flowers done to you
that you should behead them?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, Miss Ward; it is purely a nervous affection," answered
the Count as he nipped off a superb rose which he sent flying after
the other blooms.</p>

<p>"You make me dreadfully nervous," said Alicia, "and without
knowing it, you are shocking one of my fancies. I have never picked a
single flower; a bouquet inspires me with a short of terror; the
blooms of which it is composed are dead flowers, the bodies of roses,
vervain or periwinkles, and their scent has something
sepulchral."</p>

<p>"By way of expiating the murders I have just committed," said the
Count with a bow, "I shall send you a hundred baskets of living
flowers."</p>

<p>Paul had risen, and was twisting the brim of his hat with a
constrained look as though he intended to take leave.</p>

<p>"Surely you are not going already?" said Miss Ward.</p>

<p>"I have letters to write; important letters.</p>

<p>"That is a pretty thing to say," returned the young girl with a
pout. "Are there any letters of importance save those you write to
me?"</p>

<p>"Do stay, Paul," said the Commodore. "I have laid out a plan for
the evening, subject to the approbation of my niece. I propose that
we shall first go to drink a glass of water at the Santa Lucia
fountain; it is true the water smells like rotten eggs, but it gives
one an appetite. Then we shall go and eat a dozen or two of oysters,
both white and red, at the fish house, and dine in some thoroughly
Neapolitan osteria, under an arbour, and drink Falernium and Lacryma
Christi, winding up with a visit to Signor Pulcinello. The Count
could explain to us the fine points of the dialect."</p>

<p>Mr. D'Aspremont did not seem to be much taken with the plan, and
he withdrew with a cold bow. D'Altavilla remained a few moments
longer, but as Miss ward, put out at Paul's departure, did not adopt
the Commodore's proposal, he also took his leave.</p>

<p>Two hours later, Alicia received an immense number of pots of the
rarest plants in bloom, and what surprised her much more, a huge pair
of horns of the Sicilian ox, transparent as jasper, and polished as
agate, fully three feet in length and ending in menacing black
points. They were splendidly mounted in gilded bronze, so that they
could be placed, tips up, on a mantelpiece, a bracket, or a
cornice.</p>

<p>Vice, who had helped the porters to unpack both the flowers and
the horns, seemed to understand the object of this curious gift, and
placed the superb crescents, which might have been thought to have
belonged to the divine bull that bore away Europa, full in sight of
the stone table, and said:--</p>

<p>"Now we are properly protected."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Vice?" asked Miss Ward.</p>

<p>"Nothing, except that the French signor has very queer eyes."</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>

<p>The hour for meals had long since passed, and the coal fires that
during the day turned the kitchen of the Hotel de Rome into a crater
of Vesuvius, were slowly dying out in glowing embers under the
sheet-iron extinguishers. The stew-pans had ben hung on their
respective nails and glittered like a row of bucklers on the rail of
a trireme. A yellow brass lamp, like those found in the ruins of
Pompeii, was suspended by a triple chain to the main beam in the
ceiling, and with its three wicks dipping into the oil, lighted up
the centre of the great kitchen, the corners of which remained in
shadow.</p>

<p>The luminous beams falling from above illumined, with most
picturesque play of light and shade, a group of characteristic
figures collected around the thick wooden table, cut and slashed in
every direction with knife marks, and that stood in the centre of the
great hall whose walls the smoke of the cooking had turned to the
dark brown so dear to the painters of Caravaggio's school.
Unquestionable neither Spagnoletto nor Salvator Rosa, with their bold
love of truth, would have disdained the models collected there by
chance, or, to be more accurate, by nightly custom.</p>

<p>First, there was the chef, Virgilio Falsacappa, a very important
personage, of colossal stature and tremendous size, who, had he but
worn a Roman toga instead of a white duck jacket, might have passed
for one of the guests of Vitellius. His strongly marked features
formed a sort of serious caricature of the types of certain medals of
antiquity; his eyes, cut like those in stage masks, were topped by
bushy black eyebrows sticking out half an inch; an enormous nose
over-shadowed a broad mouth apparently provided with three rows of
teeth like a shark's. A dewlap, as deep as that of the Farnese bull,
joined the chin--in which was a dimple fit to hold a fist--with a
muscular neck, heavily veined and athletic-looking. Bushy whiskers,
each of which would have sufficed to provide a sapper with a
reasonable beard, framed in the face, which was marked with violet
spots. His hair was black, curly, and shiny, mingled with a few
silvery threads, and clustered on his head in short curls, while his
bull neck, with its three deep wrinkles, overlapped the collar of his
jacket. In the loves of his ears, pushed up by the protuberances of a
pair of jaws capable of chewing up and ox in the course of a day,
glittered sliver rings as large as the dic of the moon, such was
Master Virgilio Falsacappa, who, with his apron pulled up on the hip
and his knife stuck in a wooden sheath, looked more like a torturer
than a cook.</p>

<p>Next came Timberio, the porter, who, thanks to the exercise
necessitated by his trade and the sobriety of his
regimen,--consisting of a handful of half cooked macaroni, dusted
over with cacio-cavallo, a slice of water-melon and a glass of
snow-water,--was comparatively thin, but who, if will-fed, would
certainly have been as stout as Falsacappa, so truly did his huge
frame seem intended to upbear an enormous bulk of flesh. His dress
consisted simply of a pair of drawers, a long brown stuff vest, and a
coarse cloak thrown over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Striking also was the appearance of Scazziga, the coachman who
drove paul d'Aspremont, who was leaning against the table. He had a
clever face, but irregular features with an expression of simplicity
and craftiness combined; a feigned smile flitted on his mocking lips,
and his agreeable manners showed that he was constantly serving well
bred people. His garments, purchased from a dealer in second-hand
clothing, had a look of livery about them of which he was
particularly proud, and which, in his opinion, placed him a long way
higher up the social scale than the rough Timberio. He sprinkled his
talk with English and French words that did not always fit in with
the meaning of his remarks, but which none the less excited the
admiration of the kitchen maids and scullions, who were amazed at his
wonderful knowledge.</p>

<p>Somewhat in the background stood two young maids whose features,
though of course less noble, recalled the well known type of the
heads on Syracusan coins: the low forehead, the nose running straight
from the brow, the somewhat thick lips, and broad, full chin. The
blackish blue hare as dressed in bandeaux, which met behind their
head in heavy chignons, stuck with coral-headed pins, and triple
necklaces of the same material were wound round their caryatid-like
necks, the muscles of which were strengthened by their habit of
carrying their burdens upon their heads. No doubt dandies would have
looked with contempt at these poor girls in whose veins ran the
untainted blood of the splendid races of fair Greece, but an artist,
on seeing them, would at once have pulled out his sketch-book.</p>

<p>If my reader has ever seen that painted by Murillo in which angels
are cooking, I need not describe the head heads of the three or four
curly-headed scullions who completed the group.</p>

<p>The company was discussin a serious question which concerned Mr.
Paul d'Aspremont, the French traveller who had come in the steamer.
The kitchen was sitting in judgment upon the guest.</p>

<p>It was Timberio, the porter, who was speaking, and he paused
between each of his remarks, like a popular orator, in order to allow
his hearers to thoroughly grasp their full meaning, and to express
assent or dissent.</p>

<p>"Follow me carefully," the orator was just then saying. "The
'Leopold' is an honest Tuscan steamer, against which there is nothing
to be said, save that it carries round too many English
heretics."</p>

<p>"English heretics spend their money freely," put in Scazziga, whom
the receipt of tips rendered more tolerant.</p>

<p>"No doubt; the least a heretic can do when a Christian works for
him, is to reward him handsomely, so as to diminish the
humiliation."</p>

<p>"It does not humiliate me to drive a forestiere in my carriage. I
do not follow the trade of beast of burden like you."</p>

<p>"Am I not just as good a Christian as you?" replied the porter,
frowning and clenching his fists.</p>

<p>"Let Timberio have his say," chorused the rest of the company,
afraid of seeing the interesting account turn into a dispute.</p>

<p>"You will allow," continued the orator, soothed by this, "that the
weather was superb when the 'Leopold' entered the harbour."</p>

<p>"Certainly, Timberio," said the chef with majestic
condescension.</p>

<p>"The sea was smooth as glass," continued the facchino; "yet a huge
billow tossed Gennaro's boat so roughly that he fell overboard with
two or three of this comrades. Is that no out of the way? For Gennaro
is a seaman and could dance the tarantella on a yard without the help
of a balancing-pole."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he had drunk a little too much Asprino," put in Scazziga,
the rationalist of the company.</p>

<p>"He had not eve had a glass of lemonade," went on Timberio. "But
there was on board that steamer a gentleman who looked at him in a
peculiar fashion. You take me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," replied the chorus, every one of them extending the
first and fourth fingers together as if drilled to the business.</p>

<p>"Now that gentleman was no other than Mr. Paul d'Aspremont," added
Timberio. "The one in number three," asked the chef, "who has his
dinner in his room?"</p>

<p>"The very same," replied the younger and prettier of the maids.
"Never have I come across a sourer, more disagreeable and more
conceited man; he never said a word to me or even looked at me, and
yet I am well worth looking at, say all the gentlemen."</p>

<p>"You are worth a good deal more than that, my lovely Gelsornina,"
said Timberio gallantly; "but it is lucky for you that the stranger
did not look at you."</p>

<p>"You are altogether too superstitious," interjected Scazziga,
whose intercourse with foreigners had made him something of a
sceptic.</p>

<p>"And by dint of frequenting heretics, you will end in not
believing in Saint Januarius."</p>

<p>"Because Gennaro happened to tumble overboard, that is no reason
for attributing an evil influence to Mr. Paul d'Aspremont," went on
Scazziga, standing up for his customer.</p>

<p>"You want more proof, do you? Well, this morning I saw him at the
window, looking at a cloudlet no larger than a down-flake out of a
burst pillow, when at once black clouds collected and it rained so
hard that the dogs could drink standing up."</p>

<p>But Scazziga was not yet convinced and shook his head
incredulously.</p>

<p>"And the servant is no better than his master," went on Timberio.
"The booted monkey must be in league with the devil, or he could
never have knocked me out, when I could kill him with a flip of the
finger."</p>

<p>"I am of Timberio's opinion," said the chef, majestically. "The
stranger eats little; he sent down the stuffed zucchetti, the chicken
stew, and the macaroni and tomatoes which I had myself prepared for
him. There must be some reason for such sobriety. Why should a rich
man refuse tasty dishes and content himself with egg soup and a slice
of cold meat?"</p>

<p>"He is red-haired," said Gelsomina, as she passed her hand through
her own thick raven locks.</p>

<p>"And a bit goggle-eyed," added Pepita, the other maid.</p>

<p>"And his eyes are very close to his nose," went on Timberio.</p>

<p>"And the wrinkle between his eyebrows is in the shape of a
horse-shole," said, by way of completing the indictment, the huge
Virgilio Falsacappa. "Therefore he is---"</p>

<p>"Do not say the word; there is no need of it," cried the chorus,
saved and except the still incredulous Scazziga. "We shall be on our
guard."</p>

<p>"And to think that I should get into trouble with the police,"
said Timberio, "if I were to let drop a three-hundred pound trunk on
the head of that accursed forestiere."</p>

<p>"It is pretty risky in Scazziga to go about driving him," put in
Gelsomina.</p>

<p>"I am on my box; he can see by back only, and his glance cannot
cross mine at the right angle. Besides, I do not believe in the whole
business."</p>

<p>"You are a heathen, Scazziga," said the huge Palforio, the
Herculean cook. "You will come to a bad end."</p>

<p>While the servants were thus engaged in discussing him, Paul,
whose temper had been upset by finding Count d'Altavilla with Miss
Ward, hand gone for a walk at the Villa Reale, and more than once the
wrinkle between his brows deepened and his glance became fixed. He
thought he caught sight of alicia in a carriage with the Count, and
he hurried to the carriage door, putting on his eye-glasses to make
sure he was not mistaken. It was not Alicia, however, but a lady who,
at a distance, resembled her. The horses, no doubt startled by Paul's
rush, bolted.</p>

<p>Paul sat down to eat an ice at the Cafe de l'Europe, on the Palace
Square. A number of persons looked at him attentively, and then
changed their seats, making a curious gesture at the same time.</p>

<p>He entered the Pulcinella Theatre, where a play tutto da ridere
was being performed. The actor got confused in the middle of his
comic improvisation and remained dub. He pulled himself together,
however, but in the very middle of one of his by-plays, his black
false nose came off and he found it impossible to replace it. By way
of excusing himself he explained the cause of the accident by a rapid
gesture, for Paul's glance, now fixed upon him, prevented his going
on. The spectators nearest paul vanished on after another. He rose to
go out, unconscious of the effect he was producing, and in the lobby
he heard people whispering a strange word, and meaning of which he
did not understand:--</p>

<p>"A jettatore! a jettatore!"</p>

<h3>Chapter 6</h3>

<p>THE day after he had sent her the horns, Count d'Altavilla paid
Miss Ward a visit.. He found the young English lady drinking tea with
her uncle, exactly as if she had been in a yellow brick house at
Ramsgate, instead of in Naples upon a whitewashed terrace, and
surrounded by fig trees, cacti, and aloes, for one of the
distinguishing traits of the Anglo-Saxon race is the persistence of
its habits, however contrary to the climate they may be. The
Commodore was beaming. By means of artificial ice, manufactured with
the aid of a chemical apparatus for snow only is brought from the
mountains behind Castellamare he had succeeded in keeping the butter
in a solid condition, and he was just then engaged in spreading a pat
of it upon a thin slice of bread.</p>

<p>After the first commonplaces which form the preface of every
conversation, and which resemble the preludes with which pianists try
an instrument before they begin their performance, Alicia, suddenly
breaking away from conventionalities, abruptly asked the young
Neapolitan Count:</p>

<p>"What do you mean by the strange gift of a pair of horns that came
with the flowers? All I could get out of my maid Vice was that they
are a preservative against the fascino."</p>

<p>"Vice is right," replied the Count d'Altavilla with a bow.</p>

<p>"But what is the fascino?" went on the young lady. "I am not
familiar with your superstitions your--African notions, for no doubt
it has to do with some popular belief."</p>

<p>"The fascino is the pernicious influence exercised by a person
endowed, or afflicted rather, with the evil eye."</p>

<p>"I am pretending to understand you, so that you will not have too
low an opinion of my capacity if I confess that the meaning of your
words escapes me" said Alicia. "You explain the unknown by the
unknown, and evil eye is, so far as I am concerned, as unintelligible
as the expression fascio. Like the character in the plays I
understand Latin, but please speak as if I did not."</p>

<p>"I shall explain myself as clearly as possible," replied
d'Altavilla; "only pray do not, with British contempt, mistake me for
a barbarian, and do not wonder whether under my clothes my skin is
tattooed red and blue. I am a civilised man; I was educated in Paris;
I speak both French and English; I have read Voltaire; I believe in
steam engines, in railways, and in a double Chamber, just like
Stendhal; I eat macaroni with a fork; in the morning I wear Suede
gloves, coloured kid in the afternoon, and straw-coloured kid in the
evening."</p>

<p>The Commodore, who was buttering a second slice of bread, was
attracted by this strange preface, and he remained with his knife in
the air, gazing at d'Altavilla with his Northern blue eyes, the shade
of which contrasted so funnily with his brick-like complexion.</p>

<p>"Your account of yourself is quite reassuring," said Miss Ward
with a smile, "and it would be very rude of me to suspect you of
being a barbarian. But surely you must have something very dreadful
to tell me, or else something very absurd, to indulge in such
circumlocutions before coming; to the point."</p>

<p>"You are right; it is very terrible, very absurd, and even very
ridiculous, which is worse," answered the Count; "it and were I with
you in London or Paris, I dare say I should laugh at it with you, but
here in Naples--"</p>

<p>"You will remain serious. Is not that what you were going to
say?"</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"Well, let us get to the fascino," said Miss Ward, impressed, in
spite of herself, by the Count's gravity.</p>

<p>"The belief is one that goes back to the farthest antiquity; it is
alluded to in the Bible. Vergil mentions it as one who firmly
believes in it; the bronze amulets found in Pompeii, Herculaneum,
Stabiae, the protective signs drawn on the houses that have been
cleared out, show how widespread that superstition was formerly."
D'Altavilla slyly laid stress upon the word superstition. "The whole
of the East still credits it to-day. Red or green hands are placed
upon each front of Moorish houses in order to avert the cvil
influence. On the Gate of Judgment, in the Alhambra, there is a hand
carved on the keystone, which is a proof that if the belief is not
well grounded, it is at least very ancient. When an opinion has been
held by millions of men for thousands of years, it is probable that
it rests upon some positive facts, upon a long series of observations
borne out by events. However well I may think of myself, I find it
somewhat difficult to believe that so many persons, some of whom,
unquestionably, were illustrious, enlightened, and learned, should
have been so egregiously mistaken in the matter and that I alone
should see it clearly."</p>

<p>"There is an obvious retort to your argument," broke in Miss Ward.
"Was not polytheism the religion believed in by Hesiod, Homer,
Aristotle, Plato, Socrates himself,-as witness his sacrificing a cock
to Esculapius,-and numberless other men of undoubted genius?"</p>

<p>"That is true; but no one nowadays sacrifices bulls to
Jupiter."</p>

<p>"They are better made into beefsteaks and rump-steaks," sagely
remarked the Commodore, who had always been shocked at the custom of
burning the fat legs of victims upon coals, as related by Homer.</p>

<p>"I can understand that the ignorant multitude should fear such an
influence," said Miss Ward; "but that a man of your rank and
education should share the belief is what amazes me."</p>

<p>"Many who claim to be strong-minded," replied the Count, "hang
horns in their windows, nail antlers above their door, and go about
covered with amulets. For my part, I make no bones about it, and I am
not ashamed to own that when I meet a jettatore, I prefer to cross
over to the other side of the street, and that if I cannot avoid his
glance, I do my best to conjure it by making the conventional sign; I
do it just as readily as would a lazzarone, and I am the safer for
it. Numerous misadventures have taught me not to disdain such
precautions."</p>

<p>Miss Alicia Ward was a Protestant, brought up in great
philosophical freedom of thought, and trained to admit nothing save
after examination, so that her lucid reasoning powers rebelled
against whatever could not be mathematically explained. The Count's
remarks caused her surprise, and at first she assumed that he was
merely trying to be amusing, but his calm and convinced manner showed
her she was mistaken, though he failed to convince her.</p>

<p>"I grant you," she said, "that the prejudice exists and that it is
very widespread; that you are sincerely afraid of the evil eye, and
that you are not toying to play upon the credulity of a stranger. But
you must give me some physical reason for the existence of this
superstitious idea, for, even at the cost of being considered by you
wholly devoid of poetic feeling, I am very incredulous. The
fantastic, the mysterious, the occult, the inexplicable have very
little hold upon me."</p>

<p>"You surely admit, Miss Ward," went on the Count, "the power of
the human eye? The light of heaven mingles in it with the reflection
of the soul; the pupil is a lens which concentrates the beams of
life, and intellectual electricity gashes forth from that small
opening. Does not a woman's glance pierce the hardest heart? Does not
a hero's inspire a whole army? Does not the physician's look tame a
madman as effectually as a cold douche? Does not a mother's glance
repel lions?"</p>

<p>"You plead your cause eloquently," answered Miss Ward, shaking her
pretty head. "But you must forgive me if I still entertain
doubts."</p>

<p>"What of the bird, then, that, fluttering with terror and uttering
pitiful cries, descends from the top of the tree whence it might fly
away, to fall into the maw of the serpent that heard fascinates it?
Is it impelled by a prejudice? Has it stories of jettatura told in
the nests of the feathery gossips? Is not the cause of many an effect
beyond the grasp of our organs? Are the miasmata of malaria, of
plague, of cholera visible? No eye can see the electric fluid on the
lightning rod, yet the electricity is drawn down it. Why is it absurd
to suppose that from the black, blue, or gray disc called the eye
there issues a beam that may be beneficent or deadly? Why should not
that effluvium be fortunate or unfortunate according to the mode of
its emission and the angle at which it impinges upon the object it
strikes?"</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said the Commodore, "that there is something to
be said in favour of the Count's argument. For my part, I have never
been able to look at a toad's yellow eyes without feeling intolerable
heat in the stomach, just as if I had swallowed an emetic; yet the
poor reptile had more reason to fear than I, since I could crush it
with my heel."</p>

<p>"Ah! uncle," said Miss Ward, "if you are going to side with Count
d'Altavilla, I shall have the worst of it. I am not fit to cope with
the two of you. Although I might raise many an objection to that
ocular electricity of which no physicist has spoken, I am willing,
for the sake of argument, to admit its existence; but I do not
perceive in what way the huge horns with which you have presented me
can efficaciously protect one against its fatal effects."</p>

<p>"Just as the point of the lightning-rod diverts the lightning, so
do the sharp points of the horns upon which the jettatore's glance
falls divert the malevolent fluid and deprive it of its dangerous
electricity. Outstretched fingers and coral amulets perform the same
service." "What you have been telling me, Count," returned Miss Ward,
"is very mysterious, but so far as I can make it out, I am under the
spell of a most dangerous jettatore, and you sent me the horns to
protect me against him." "I fear that is the case," replied the
Count, with an accent of deep conviction. "I should just like to see
one of those squinting rascals trying to fascinate my niece,"
exclaimed the Commodore. "I am over sixty, but I have not yet
forgotten how to strike straight from the shoulder."</p>

<p>And as he said this, he closed his fist pressing his thumb against
the folded fingers.</p>

<p>"Two fingers are enough, sir," said d'Altavilla; at the same time
placing the Commodore's fingers in the correct position. " is usually
an unconscious act, and is exercised unwittingly by those who possess
the fatal gift. Often, indeed, jettatori deplore its effects more
than any one else, once they have become aware of their deadly power.
They should therefore be avoided, not ill treated. Besides, their
influence may be neutralized or at least attenuated, by horns,
outstretched fingers, or forked branches of coral."</p>

<p>"Very strange, in truth," said the Commodore, impressed in spite
of himself by d'Altavilla's seriousness.</p>

<p>"I was not aware that I was so greatly haunted by jettatori. I
scarcely ever leave the terrace, save, in the evening, to drive with
my uncle along the Villa Reale, and I have never noticed anything
that might justify your belief," said the young lady, whose curiosity
was awakened, though she was as incredulous as ever.</p>

<p>"They are not suspicions, Miss Ward; I am absolutely certain,"
replied the Neapolitan Count.</p>

<p>"Pray, then, reveal to us the name of the fatal being," returned
Miss Ward, with a trace of mockery.</p>

<p>D'Altavilla remained silent.</p>

<p>"It is well to know whom we should be on our guard against," added
the Commodore.</p>

<p>The young nobleman appeared to be thinking deeply; then rose,
walked up to Miss Ward's uncle, bowed respectfully to him, and
said:</p>

<p>"Sir, I have the honour to ask for your niece's hand in
marriage."</p>

<p>At this unexpected request, Alicia blushed rosy red and the
Commodore's face turned scarlet, from red that it had been.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly Count d'Altavilla might be a suitor for Miss Ward's
hand; he belonged to one of the oldest and noblest families in
Naples; he was handsome, young, wealthy, and in favour at Court; he
was thoroughly well bred, and irreproachable in demeanour. His
request, therefore, was entirely proper, but it came so suddenly, so
strangely, it had apparently so little to do with the conversation
that had been going on, that the amazement of uncle and niece was
justified. Nor did d'Altavilla appear either surprised or discouraged
by it, and he awaited the reply with firm mien.</p>

<p>"My dear Count," at last said the Commodore, when he had somewhat
recovered from his surprise, "your request astonishes as well as
honours me. The truth is that I do not know how to answer you; I have
not consulted my niece. We were talking of fascino, jettatura, horns,
amulets, open and closed hands, of all sorts of things that have
nothing to do with marriage, and then all of a sudden you ask me for
Alicia's hand! That is not logical, and you must not be annoyed if I
am somewhat mixed. The match would certainly be quite suitable, but I
fancied my niece had other intentions. It is true, on the other hand,
that an old seadog like me is not one to read fluently a young girl's
heart."</p>

<p>Alicia, perceiving that her uncle was floundering about, profited
by his pausing for breath to put an end to a situation that was
becoming embarrassing, and said to the Neapolitan:</p>

<p>"Count, when a gentleman loyally asks for an honest girl's hand,
she has no right to take offense, but she may feel surprise at the
strange manner in which the request is made. I was asking you to tell
me the name of the jettatore whose influence, according to you, may
prove fatal to me, and you suddenly prefer to my uncle a request the
motive for which I do not clearly perceive."</p>

<p>"My reason is," answered d'Altavilla, "that a gentleman does not
care to denounce another man, and that a husband alone has the right
to defend his wife. But pray take some time before deciding. Until
then the horns, placed in a sufficiently conspicuous place, will, I
believe, avail to protect you against any unfortunate
consequences."</p>

<p>Whereupon the Count rose, bowed low, and went out.</p>

<p>Vice, the crinkly-haired maid, who was coming to clear away the
tea things, had heard the end of the conversation as she was slowly
ascending the terrace steps. She nourished against Paul d'Aspremont
the fullest aversion natural in an Abruzzi peasant, scarcely tamed by
two or three years of domestic service, for a forestiere suspected of
jettatura. Besides, she thought Count d'Altavilla a splendid man, and
could not understand that Miss Ward should prefer to him a pale,
meagre fellow whom she, Vice, would not have had anything to do with,
even had he not had the fascino. There--fore, unappreciative of Count
d'Altavilla's delicate methods, and desiring to withdraw her
mistress, whom she loved, from a hurtful influence, Vice bent to Miss
Ward's ear and said to her:</p>

<p>"I know the name that Count d'Altavilla will not tell you."</p>

<p>"And I forbid you to speak it, Vice, if you care to retain my
favour," answered Alicia. "Such superstitions are positively
shameful, and I shall brave them like a Christian girl who fears God
alone." 7</p>

<h3>Chapter 7</h3>

<p>"JETTATURA! Jettatore! These words were certainly addressed to
me," said Paul d'Aspre--mont to himself, as he returned to his hotel.
"What they mean I do not know, but they were evidentlv intended for
an insult or a mockery. What is there strange, peculiar, or
ridiculous about me that attracts such unpleasant attention? Though
one is not a good judge of one's self, it seems to me that I am
neither handsome nor ugly, neither tall nor short, neither stout nor
thin, and that I ought to be able to go about without attracting
notice. There is nothing eccentric in my dress; I am not adorned with
a turban with lighted tapers, like Mr. Jourdain in the cere--monial
scene in the Bourgeois gentilhomme; I do not wear a jacket with a sun
embroidered in gold on the back; I do not go about with a negro in
front of me playing on the cymbals. My personality, which, for the
matter of that, is wholly unknown in Naples, is concealed under the
ordinary dress, the domino of modern civilisation, and I am in every
respect like the dandies who walk up and down the Strada di Toledo or
on the Largo del Palazzo Reale, save that I have a rather quieter
necktie, not so large a breastpin, a less gorgeously embroidered
shirt-front, not so loud a waistcoat, not so many gold chains, and
that my hair is very much less curled.</p>

<p>"That may be it! My hair is perhaps not curled enough. To-morrow I
shall have it done up by the hair-dresscr in the hotel."</p>

<p>"Yet the people here are used to seeing strangers, and a few
slight differences in my dress do not account for the mysterious word
and the strange gesture called out by my presence. Besides, I have
noticed an expression of antipathy and terror on the faces of the
people who drew out of my way. What can I possibly have done to them,
since I have never met them before? Everywhere a travellerwho is but
a passing shadow that returns notexcites indifference only, unless he
happens to come from some distant place and is of an unknown race;
and every week the steamers land on the pier thousands of tourists in
every respect like me. Nobody troubles about them, save the facchini,
the hotel-keepers, and the guides. I have not killed my brother, nor
I never had one; consequently I cannot be bearing about the brand of
Cain upon my brow, yet men are startled at sight of me and move away.
I do not remember having ever produced such an effect in Paris,
London, Vienna, or in any of the towns where I have lived. I have
been thought proud, disdainful, reserved at times. I have been told
that I affected the English sneer, that I was aping Lord Byron, but
everywhere I have been received as a gentleman should be, and my
advances, though infrequent, have been all the more appreciated on
that account. Surely the three days' trip from Marseilles to Naples
cannot have altered me to the extent of having become odious or
grotesque, for more than one woman has ere now singled me out, and I
have won the heart of Alicia Ward, a charming girl, a heavenly
creature, one of Thomas Moore's angels!"</p>

<p>These reflections, undoubtedly quite sensible, some--what calmed
Paul d'Aspremont, and he succeeded in convincing himself that he had
attached to the exag--gerated pantomime of the Neapolitans, who
gesticulate more than any other people, a wholly gratuitous
meaning.</p>

<p>It was late. All the guests, save Paul, had retired to their
rooms, and Gelsomina, one of the servants whose portrait I sketched
in the account of the kitchen council presided over by Virgilio
Falsacappa, was waiting to lock the doors as soon as Paul should have
returned. Nanella, the other maid, whose turn it was to sit up, had
begged her braver companion to take her place, as she herself desired
to avoid the foresiere who was suspected of jettatura. Gelsomina,
therefore, was armed at all points; a huge bunch of amulets bristled
on her bosom; five little coral horns hung, instead of vine leaves,
from the facetted pearls in her ears; her hand, ready outstretched,
extended its fore and fourth fingers in a position so accurate that
it would certainly have met with commendation from the reverend
Father Andrea de Jorio, author of the Mimieba degli antichi
investigata Ned gestire napoletano.</p>

<p>The brave Gelsomina, concealing her hand behind a fold of her
skirt, handed the candlestick to Mr. d'Aspremont, and fixed upon him
a sharp, steady, almost provocative glance, so singular in its
expression that the young man cast down his eyes, a result that
appeared to give remarkable pleasure to the handsome girl. As she
stood there, motionless and erect, holding out the candlestick with a
statuesque gesture, her profile brought out by the light, her glance
fixed and assuming the look of thee the Nemesis of antiquity
overawing a criminal.</p>

<p>When d'Aspremont had ascended the stairs and the sound of his
footsteps had died out, Gelsomina threw back her head with an air of
triumph, and said:</p>

<p>"Well, I fairly looked him down, that ugly fellow, whom may Saint
Januarius confound. I am sure no harm will come to me."</p>

<p>Paul had a bad night of it, and his slumbers were troubled by all
sorts--of strange, tormenting dreams connected with the thoughts that
had filled his mind during the course of the evening. He seemed to be
surrounded by monstrous, grimacing faces expressing hatred, anger,
and terror; then these would vanish, and he saw himself threatened by
long, lean, bony fingers, with knotty joints, that came out of the
dark--ness, reddened by a light of Hell, and making cabalistic signs.
The nails on these fingers, curved like tigers' claws and vultures'
talons, came closer and closer to his face and appeared to seek to
tear his eyes out. By a supreme effort he managed to brush aside
these hands that were winged like bats, but the hands were followed
by heads of bulls, buffaloes, and stags, the whitened skulls filled
with a life that was death, and which goring him with horns or
anuers, torced him to leap into the sea, where he tore his limbs upon
a forest of coral with pointed or bifurcated branches. Then a billow
would cast him ashore, worn out, broken, half dead, and, like Byron's
Don Juan, he seemed to see, in his fainting condition, a lovely head
bending down over him. It was that, not of Haidee, but of Alicia,
more beautiful than the imaginary being created by the poet. The
maiden strove in vain to draw up on the sand the body the sea
endeavoured to snatch back, and called on Vice, the tawny maid, to
help her, but the latter refused with ferocious laughter. Alicia's
strength gave way, and Paul fell back into the waters.</p>

<p>These confused and terrifying fancies, horrible in their
vagueness, and others still more vague, and re--calling the shapeless
phantoms that half emerge from the dense shadows of Goya's
aquatintas, tortured the dreamer until early dawn. His soul, freed by
the exhaustion of the body, appeared to divine what his waking
thought failed to understand, and strove to translate its
presentiments into images in the camera obscura of dreams.</p>

<p>Paul rose tired out, uneasy, dimly conscious of some mystery in
these nightmares, but not daring to sound it. Fle turned round and
round the tatal secret, closing his eyes in order not to see, and
closing his ears in order not to hear it. Never had he felt so
depressed. He even lost faith in Alicia; the Count's air of satisfied
conceit, the complaisant manner in which the young girl listened to
him, the approving air of the Commodore, all these things recurred to
him fizll of painful particulars, filled his heart with bitterness,
and deepened his melancholy.</p>

<p>Day has the power to dispel troubles caused by the visions of the
night. When the dawn's golden shafts flashe into the room through the
parted curtains, Smarra, annoyed, flees away flapping its bat-like
wings. The sun was shining joyously, the sky was clear, and the blue
sea sparkled with innumerable spangles. Little by little Paul grew
calmer; he forgot his painful dreams and the strange impressions felt
the evening before, or, when he did give a thought to them, he blamed
himself for his folly in dwelling upon them.</p>

<p>He took a turn round Chiaja to enjoy the Neapolitan excitability.
The dealers were crying their wares in queer musical phrases in a
popular dialect unintelligible to Paul, who knew Italian only and
with excited gestures and a fury of pantomime unknown in the North.
But every time he stopped before a shop, the dealer looked alarmed,
murmured an imprecation in a low voice, and stretched out his first
and fourth fingers as if he were about to stab Paul with them. The
women, bolder, overwhelmed him with insults and shook their fists in
his face.</p>

<h3>Chapter 8</h3>

<p>On hearing himself insulted by the Chiaja people, Mr. d'Aspremont
imagined that they were addressing to him the coarsely burlesque
litanies to which fishwives treat well-dressed persons who happen to
traverse the market, but the lively repulsion, the genuine terror
visible on every face compelled him to seek some other explanation.
He heard once more, but with a threatening accent, the word
jettatore, which had already struck upon his ear at the San Carlo
Theatre; he therefore slowly walked away without letting his glance,
the cause of so much trouble, rest upon anything.</p>

<p>As he passed along the houses trying to escape attention, he came
upon a second-hand book-stall. He stopped, turned over and opened
some of the books, by way of pulling himself together. He thus turned
his back upon the passers-by, and as he half-concealed his face
within the pages of the volume, he avoided insult. He had for one
moment thought of using his shoulders of the rabble, but an
undefinable supterstitious terror that was beginning to lay hold of
him had restrained him. He remembered that once, having struck an
insolent driver with a light switch, he had hit him on the temple and
killed him on the spot, an involuntary murder he had never got
over.</p>

<p>Having picked up and put back a number of books in the boxes, he
came upon Signor Niccolo Valetta's treatise on jettaura, the title of
which seemed to flash up before him, as if the book had been placed
there by the hand of Fate. He threw to the dealer, who was looking at
him with a sarcastic expression of countenance, and rattling the
three or four black horns that hung with other charms upon his
watch-chain, the six or eight carlini he asked for the book, and
hurried back to his hotel to begin the study which was to clear away
the doubts which had worried him since his arrival in Naples.</p>

<p>Valetta's book is as widely read in Naples as the Secrets of
Albertus the Great, Etteila or the Key to Dreams in Paris. Valetta
gives a definition of jettatur, shows by what means it may be
recognised, and what are the methods to be resorted to for
protection. He divides jettatori into several classes, in accordance
with their power for evil, and discusses every point in conection
with this important subject.</p>

<p>If d'Aspremont had come across this book in Paris, he would have
glanced carelessly through it as through an old almanac stuffed full
of nonsensical tales, and have laughed at the serious manner in which
the author treated of such absurdities. But in his present condition
away from his usual surroundings, prepared to credulity by numberless
trifling incidents, he perused it wilth secret horror, like some
profane person spelling out of a black-letter folio formula for the
evocation of spirits and other cabalistic performances. Though he had
not sought to penetrate them, the secrets of of Hell were being
revealed to him, and he was now aware of his fatal gift; he was a
jettatore! He had own it to himself, for he possessed every one of
the distinctive marks described by Valetta.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that a man who believes himself to be
enjoying the best of health, opens by chance a medical work and, on
reading the pathological descrription of some disease, perceives that
he is suffering from it. Enlightened by the dread knowledge, he
feels, as he notes each symptom in the tale, some hidden portion of
his organs, some concealed fibre, the play of which he was ignorant
of, quiver with pain, and he turns pale at the thought that death,
which he had fancied far distant, is near. Paul experienced just such
a feeling.</p>

<p>He went to the mirror and looked at himself with terrifying
intensity. The dissonant perfection of features, composed of beauties
not usually found together, made him more than ever like the fallen
archangel and gleamed with sinister fire out of the dark depths of
the mirror. The rays in his pupils writhed like vipers; his eyebrows
quivered like a bow from which the deadly shaft has just been shot;
the white line in his forehead recalled a cicatrice due to a
thunderbolt, and flames of Hell seemed to burn in his auburn hair,
while the marble pallor of his complexion brought out more
startlingly still each feature of his absolutely terrifying face. He
was frightened at himself. It seemed to him that his glance,
reflected by the mirror, returned to him like a poisoned arrow.
Imagine Medusa looking at her own hideous, yet charming face in the
ruddy reflection of a brazen shield!</p>

<p>It may be objected that it is difficult to believe that a young
man of the world, educated in the truths of modern science, and who
had lived in the very midst of a sceptical civilisation, could accept
seriously a popular prejudice, and fancy himself endowed with a
mysterious deadly power; but to that I answer that common belief
exercises an irresistible power of magnetism which masters a man in
spite of himself, and with which the individual will cannot always
cope successfully. A man may arrive in Naples laughing jettatura to
scorn, and end by surrounding himself with horned preventives and by
fleeing from every individual whose glance he suspects of evil. But
Paul d'Aspremont was in a much more serious situation: he was himself
possessed of the fascino, and every one avoided him or made in his
presence the protective signs recomended by Signor Valetta. His
common-sense rebelled at the thought, yet he could not help
acknowledging that he bore every mark characteristic of a jettatura.
The human mind, even when most enlightened, has always some dark nook
in which crouch the hideous monsters of credulity and where cling the
bats of supertition. Ordinary life itself is so full of problems that
cannot be solved that impossibility becomes probability. A man may
deny everything or believe in everything; from a certain point of
view dreams are as ture as reality.</p>

<p>Profound melancholy overpowered Paul. He was a monster! Though
endowed with a most affectionate disposition and the kindest of
hearts, he nevetheless bore misfortune wherever he went. His glance,
unconsciously filled with venom, was fatal to those upon whom it
rested, even when he looked kindly upon them. He suffered from the
horrible privilege of colecting, concentrating, and distilling the
morbid miasmas, the dangerous electricity, the fatal influences of
the ambient air and scattered them around. A number of incidents in
his life, which until now had been unintelligible to him and which he
had attributed to chance, now stood out in hideous clearness. He
remembered all manner of strange misadventures, of unexplained
misfortunes, of causeless catastrophes the reason of which he now
understood. Startling coincidences occurred to his mind and confirmed
the unhappy opinion he now had of himself.</p>

<p>He went back over his life year by year. He recalled his mother
who had died in giving him birth; the unfortunate fate of his young
schoolfellows: the one he loved best had been killed by a fall from a
tree while he, Paul, was watching him climb it. He recalled the
boating excursion on which he had started so joyously with two of his
comrades, and from which he had returned alone, after making
desperate efforts to drag from the weeds the bodies of the two poor
lads drowned by the upsetting of the craft; the assault at arms in
which his foil, the button of which had broken off and transformed
the weapon into a sword, had so dangerously wounded his opponent, a
young man whom he loved dearly. Unquestionably there could be no
rational explanation of these events, although Paul had hitherto
believed there was. Now, however, the apparently fortuitous and
accidental character of these events appeared to him to depend upon
another cause, which he had learned since he had read Valetta's book.
The deadly influence, the fascino, the jettatura had evidently a
share in these catastrophes. Such a persistent series of misfortunes
in connection with one and the same individual was unnatural.</p>

<p>A still more recent circumstance recurred to his memory in all its
horrible details, and contributed largely to strengthen his unhappy
belief.</p>

<p>He often used to attend the performances at Her Majesty's Theatre,
in London, having been struck by the grace of a young English
ballet-dancer. Without being more taken with her than a man is with a
charming figure in a painting or an engraving, he had into the habit
of following her with his eyes in midst of her companions in the
ballet, through the wildering maze of the evolutions of the dance. He
had got fond of her sad, gentle face, of her delicate pallor which
the exertion of the dance never flushed, of her beautiful silky,
shining fair locks, crowed, as the case might be, with stars or
flowers, of her glance that lost itself in space, of her limbs that
shyly lifted the clouds of gauze and shone under the silk like the
marble limbs of some statue of antiquity. Every time she flashed past
the footlights, he saluted her with a quiet, furtive sign of
admiration, or put up glasses in order to see her better.</p>

<p>One night, in the circular flight of a waltz, the dancer swept
closer to the dazzling line of fire that, in a theatre, separates the
world of reality from the realm of fancy. Her airy sylph-like
draperies fluttered like the wings of a dove about to take to flight,
when a tongue of flame shot up, blue white, and reached the light
stuff. In an instant the young girl was wrapped in flames; she danced
on for a second like a will o' the wisp in the midst of a ruddy
blaze, and then, terrified, rushed to the wings, crazed with fright
and was burned alive in her blazing garments.</p>

<p>Paul had been deeply grieved by the accident, of which the
newspapers of the day all spoke, and in which the name of the victim
may be found by any one curious to know it. But his sorrow was
unmixed with remorse, and he did not suppose he had in the least
degree contributed to an accident which he regretted more than any
one else. Now, however, he was convinced that his insistent habit of
following her with his glance had had something to do with the death
of the lovely girl. He looked on himself as her murderer; he felt a
horror of himself and wished he had never been born.</p>

<p>This state of prostration was followed by a violent reaction. Paul
broke into a nervous laugh, threw away Valetta's book, and
exclaimed:--</p>

<p>"Upon my word, I am going crazy or turning into in idiot. The
Naples sun must have affected my brain. What would the men at my club
say if they knew that I have seriously discussed whether or not I am
a jettatore?"</p>

<p>Paddy here knocked discreetly at the door. Paul opened, and the
groom, conscientiously performing his duties, presented to him upon
the shining leather of cap, a letter from Alicia, excusing himself
the while for not having a silver salver.</p>

<p>D'Aspremont broke the seal and read as follows:</p>

<p>"Are you annoyed with me, Paul? You did not come last night, and
your lemon sherbet melted sadly away on the table. I kept looking for
you until nine o'clock, trying to make out the sound of your carriage
wheels amid the din of the cicalas and the rumbling of the
tambourines. Then I gave up hope and quarrelled with the Commodore.
Are not women wonderfully just? Pulcinella's black nose, Don Limon,
and Donna Pangrazia must have a wonderful attraction for you, for I
know by my secret police that you spent the evening at San Carlino.
You did not write a single one of those letters you said were so
important. Why do you not simply confess that you were stupidly
jealous Count d'Altavilla? I thought you had more pride, and your
modesty is touching. You need have no fear; Count d'Altavilla is too
handsome, and I do not for Apollos that wear watch charms. I ought to
treat you with haughty disdain, and inform you that I not notice your
absence, but the truth is that the time hung very heavily on my
hands, that I was in a very bad temper, very nervous, and that I
nearly beat Vice who was laughing as if she were crazy, though what
it was at, I have not the faintest idea.</p>

<p>,,A. W."</p>

<p>Paul completely recovered the feeling of real life on reading this
playfully sarcastic letter. He dressed, ordered the carriage, and
soon the incredulous Scazziga was cracking his whip at his horses
that dashed at a gallop down the lava-paved street, through the crowd
that is ever dense on the Santa Lucia quay.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you, Scazziga?" asked Paul; "you will
have a smash presently."</p>

<p>The coachman turned sharply round to reply, and Paul's angry
glance fell full upon him. A stone he had not perceived forced up one
of the fore wheels and the violence of the shock caused him to fall
from his box, though he managed to keep hold of the reins. He
clambered back as nimbly as a monkey, with a bump the size of a hen's
egg on his forehead.</p>

<p>"The devil take me if I turn round again when you speak to me," he
grumbled low. "Timberio, Falsacappa, and Gelsomina were right. He is
a jettatore. To-morrow I shall buy a pair of horns; it can do harm
and may do good."</p>

<p>Paul was disturbed by the incident, for it brought him back within
the magic circle he was trying escape from. Of course the fact that a
stone hapenes to be struck by the wheel of a carriage and that the
driver tumbles off his seat, is of daily occurrence, but the effect
had followed so closely upon the cause, Scazziga's fall had coincided
so exactly with the look he cast upon him, that all his fears
returned.</p>

<p>"I have a great mind," he said to himself, "to leave this
extravagant country to-morrow, for as long as I stay in it I feel my
brain rattling around in my head like a dried nut in its shell. But
if I were to acquaint Alicia with my fears, she would laugh at me,
and the climate of Naples is beneficial to her. But, by the way, she
was in excellent health before she made my acquaintance! Never had
that swan's nest, England, floating on the waves, given birth to a
fairer and rosier child. Life sparkled in her glorious eyes and
bloomed upon her satiny fresh cheeks; a rich clean blood coursed in
the azure veins under her transparent skin, and her beauty made
itself felt under her grace and strength. But once my glance fell
upon her, she grew pale, thin, and altered; her delicate hands became
more slender; her brilliant eyes were circled with dark rings, and it
seemed as though consumption had touched her with its bony fingers.
During my absence, she quickly regained her lovely colour; her breath
came freely from the lungs which the physician had sounded with
anxiety. If she were freed freed from my fatal influence, she would
live long. I believe I am killing her. The other evening, while I was
there, she experienced such acute pain that her cheeks became pallid
as though death bad breathed upon her. I wonder whether I unknowingly
cast jettatura upon her? Of course the whole thing may be explained
in the most natural manner, for many English girls have a
predisposition to consumption."</p>

<p>Paul d'Aspremont turned these thoughts over in his mind all the
way. When be appeared on the terrace, where the Commodore and Alicia
spent most of their time, the huge Sicilian ox-horns, given by Count
d'Altavilla, outspread their jasper-like crescents in the most
conspicuous place. The Commodore, observing Paul's glance fall upon
them, turned blue, which was his way of blushing. Less delicately
minded than his niece, he had listened to Vice's confidences.</p>

<p>Alicia, with a gesture of profound disdain, signed the servant to
remove the horns, and cast upon Paul adorable glance full of love, of
courage, and of faith.</p>

<p>"Leave them where they are," said Paul to Vice. "They are very
handsome."</p>

<h3>Chapter 9</h3>

<p>PAUL'S remark upon the horns presented by Count d'Altavilla
appeared to give the Commodore pleasure. Vice smiled, exhibiting a
row of teeth of which the canines, separate and sharp, shone with
ferocious whiteness. Alicia's swift look asked of her friend a
question that remained unanswered, and an awkward silence fell upon
the company.</p>

<p>The first moments of a visit, even when it is cordial, familiar,
and the repetition of a daily call, are usually embarrassing. During
the time of absence, wven though it be of a few hours' duration only,
an invisible atmosphere has gathered about each one and bars
confidence. It is like a perfectly clear pane of lass through which
one can see the landscape but that a fly cannot traverse. There is
apparently nothing the matter, yet an obstacle makes itself felt.</p>

<p>An unspoken thought, kept well in the background, for all three
were well seasoned people of the world, caused each member of the
party to be more preoccupied than was the wont of persons usually so
much at their ease. The Commodore was mechanically twiddling his
thumbs; d'Aspremont could not take his eyes off the black, polished
points of the horns he had forbidden Vice to remove, studying them as
though he were a naturalist seeking to classify some hitherto unknown
species; Alicia was toying with the bow of the broad ribbon that she
wore as a belt round her wrapper, and pretended to be refastening
it.</p>

<p>She was the first to break the ice, with the playful freedom of
English girls, who are, however, so modest and reserved once they are
married.</p>

<p>"Really, Paul, you have not been very amiable of late. Is your
love a cold-house plant which can bloom in England only, and the
development of which the high temperature of this climate interferes
with? You were so attentive, so thoughtful, so ready to forestall my
least wishes when you were with us at our Lincolnshire place. You
presented yourself with smiling lips, your heart on your sleeve, your
hair irreproachably curled, and ready to bend the knee before the
goddess of your soul; such, in a word, as lovers are depicted in the
illustrations to novels."</p>

<p>"And I still love you, Alicia," replied d'Aspremont, in a voice
full of feeling, but without removing his eyes from the horns hanging
on one of the antique pillars that supported the vine-leaf roof.</p>

<p>"You say it in so lugubrious a tone," returned Alicia, "that it
taxes my self-conceit to believe it. I fancy that what you liked in
me was pallor, my diaphaneity, my Ossianic and vaporous grace. My
state of ill-health bestowed upon me a certain romantic charm that I
have now lost."</p>

<p>"You were never lovelier, Alicia."</p>

<p>"Words, words, words, as Shakespeare says. I am so lovely that you
do not condescend to look at me."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact d'Aspremont's eyes had not once rested upon
the girl.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, with a comically exaggerated sigh, "I see
plainly that I have turned into a stout, sturdy peasant girl,
blooming, high-coloured and blowzy, without a trace of breeding, and
unfit to appear at Almack's or in the 'Book of Beauty,' with a sheet
of tissue paper between my portrait and a sonnet."</p>

<p>"Miss Ward, you take pleasure in gratuitously slandering
yourself," said Paul with downcast glance.</p>

<p>"You had better own at once that you think horrid. It is your
fault, Commodore," she went on. "You have been feeding me up on
chicken wings, choice chops, fillet of beef and Canary wine, and with
your rides on horseback, your sea-bathing and your gymnastic
exercise, you have worked me up to state of rude country health that
has scattered to the winds Mr. d'Aspremont's poetic illusions."</p>

<p>"You are teasing Mr. d'Aspremont and making of me," said the
Commodore. "It is quite certain that fillet of beef is strengthening
and that Canary wine never hurt any one."</p>

<p>"What a disappointment it must be for you, Paul, to have parted
with a nixie, an elf, a willis, and come upon what physicians and
parents call a healthy lass! But since you have not the courage to
look me, shudder with horror--I am seven ounces heavier than when I
left England!"</p>

<p>"Eight ounces," proudly corrected the Commodore, who tended Alicia
as carefully as the most ten mother could have done.</p>

<p>"Is it eight ounces exactly? Oh, you dread uncle; you want to
disenchant Mr. d'Aspremont for good."</p>

<p>While the young girl was thus rallying him with a coquetry she
would not have permitted herself to indulge in had she not had
serious reasons for doing so, d'Aspremont, a prey to his fixed notion
and resolved not to harm Miss Ward with his deadly glance, kept his
eyes resolutely upon the talismanic horns or let his gaze wander over
the vast blue horizon visible from the terrace. He asked himself
whether he was not in duty bound, even at the cost of passing for a
man false to his word and to the dictates of honour, to flee from
Alicia and to spend the rest of his life on some desert island where
at least his jettatura would die out for lack of a human glance that
could absorb it.</p>

<p>"I see," continued Alicia, keeping up her raillery, "what is
making you so sombre and so grave. Our wedding is only a month hence,
and you are startled at the thought of becoming the husband of a poor
country girl who has lost all trace of elegance. I willingly give you
back your plighted word, and you may marry my friend Sarah Templeton,
who eats pickles and drinks vinegar in order to get thin."</p>

<p>And she laughed with the silvery, bright laughter of youth at the
notion, Paul and the Commodore joining in heartily.</p>

<p>When the last burst of her nervous gaiety had spent itself, she
went up to d'Aspremont, took him by the hand, led him to the piano
placed in the corner the terrace, and opening a music book on the
desk said:---</p>

<p>"My dear Paul, you evidently do not feel up to talking to-day, and
what is not worth saying is sung. You shall therefore take your part
in this duettino, the accompaniment of which is not difficult; it
consists chiefly of chords."</p>

<p>Paul sat down on the stool; Alicia stood behind in such a way as
to read the song upon the score. The Commodore leaned back, stretched
out his legs, and assumed a pose of anticipated beatitude, for he
claimed to be somewhat of a dilettante and affirmed that he adored
music. After the sixth bar, however, he slept the sleep of the just,
and insisted, in spite his niece's sarcasms, in giving the name of
ecstasy to his dozing, although he not infrequently snored, which is
not a usual sign of ecstasy.</p>

<p>I</p>

<p>The duettino was a bright and lively air set to words by
Metastasio, and in the taste of Cimarosa, which I can best liken to a
butterfly flitting to fro in a sunbeam.</p>

<p>Music hath power to cause the evil spirits to depart. Paul had not
been playing long before he had forgotten everything about conjuring
fingers, magical horns, and coral amulets. He had forgotten Valetta's
terrible work and all he had read about jettatura. His soul was
rising joyously, borne on the accents of Alicia's voice, into a pure
and harmonious atmosphere. The cicalas were silent, as if listening,
and the sea breeze, that had just risen, bore the notes away with the
petals of the flowers that fell from the vases on the edge of the
terrace.</p>

<p>"Uncle is as sound asleep as the Seven Sleepers in their grotto,
and if it were not his habit, it might be painful to our self-love as
artists. Shall we take a turn round the garden while he is resting? I
have never yet shown you my Paradise."</p>

<p>So saying, Alicia took down from a nail driven into one of the
pillars, on which it was hung by the long ribbons, a broad-brimmed
Florentine straw hat.</p>

<p>In matters of horticulture Alicia held the most eccentric
opinions; she would not allow flowers to be picked or the shrubbery
to be trimmed. It was, as I have said, the wild, uncultivated
appearance of the garden that had attracted her. So the two young
people had to make a way for themselves through dense bushes that
immediately closed in behind them. Alicia went first and laughed to
see the branches of the rose laurels which she displaced lash Paul's
face, but hardly had she gone twenty steps when, as if to play a
botanical practical joke, a green bough caught and lifted her bat so
high that Paul was unable recover it. Fortunately the foliage was
thick and the sun cast scarce a few golden sequins upon the sand
through the interstices of the branches.</p>

<p>"This is my favourite retreat," said Alicia, showing Paul a
picturesquely broken rock protected by a dense growth of orange
trees, lime trees, lentisks, and myrtles.</p>

<p>She sat down on a part of the rock cut to the shape of a seat, and
signed to Paul to kneel down in front her upon the dry moss that
carpeted the foot of the rock.</p>

<p>"Put both your hands in mine, and look straight into my eyes," she
said. "In another month I shall be your wife. Why does your glance
avoid mine?"</p>

<p>Paul, indeed, again a prey to his thoughts of jettatura, had
looked away.</p>

<p>"Are you afraid of reading in it any rebellious or guilty thought?
You know my heart has been yours since the day you brought the letter
of introduction to my uncle in our drawing-room at Richmond. I am of
those Englishwomen who are tender, romantic, and proud, and who love
in a moment with a lifelong love, a love more than lifelong, it may
be, and she who can love can die too. Look straight into my eyes; I
insist upon it; do not try to look down, or I shall be compelled to
believe that a gentleman who ought to fear God alone allows himself
to be frightened by wretched superstitions. Fix on me your eyes,
which you fancy so dangerous and which are so sweet to me, for I read
your love in them. Then tell me if you still think me pretty enough
to drive with me, when we are married, in an open carriage in Hyde
Park."</p>

<p>Paul, bewildered, looked long at Alicia with a glance filled with
love and enthusiasm. Suddenly the girl turned deadly pale; a sharp
pain shot through her heart like an arrow; something seemed to give
way in her breast, and she put her handkerchief quickly to her lips.
A red drop stained the fine cambric, which Alicia swiftly
concealed.</p>

<p>"I thank you, Paul. You have made me very happy, for I believed
you had ceased to love me."</p>

<h3>Chapter 10</h3>

<p>ALICIA'S gesture, as she strove to hide her handkerchief, had not,
quick as it had been, escaped d'Aspremont's notice. He turned pale in
his turn, for this was an unmistakable proof of his fatal power. His
brain was filled with the most sinister thoughts, and for a second
suicide occurred to him. Was it not, indeed, his duty to destroy
himself as being a maleficent creature, and thus to remove the
involuntary cause of so many misfortunes? He would willingly have
endured the hardest trials and borne courageously the burden of life,
but the thought of dealing death to the woman he loved best was
horrible beyond expression.</p>

<p>The heroic girl had mastered the feeling of pain, the consequence
of Paul's glance, and which coincided so strangely with the warning
given her by Count d'Altavilla. A less strong-minded person might
have been struck the result, which, if not supernatural, was at least
difficult of explanation; but, as I have said, Alicia was religious
and not superstitious. Her faith, unshakable in matters of belief,
rejected as old women's tales every story of mysterious influences,
and she laughed at the most deeply rooted popular beliefs. Besides,
even had she admitted the existence of jettatura, and had she
recognised in Paul its evident signs, she was too tender-hearted and
too proud to hesitate for a moment. Paul had done nothing to which
the most delicate susceptibility could take exception, and Miss Ward
would rather have fallen dead--under his so-called fatal glance than
have rejected a love she had accepted with her uncle's consent and
which marriage was soon to crown. She resembled somewhat the chastely
bold, virginly resolute heroines of Shakespeare, whose sudden love is
none the less pure and true, and who unhesitatingly bind themselves
for life. Her hand had pressed Paul's and no other man on earth was
henceforth to hold it in his. Shel ooked upon her life as linked to
his, and her maidenly modesty would have revolted at the mere thought
of any other hymen.</p>

<p>She therefore exhibited genuine happiness, or at least so
admirably simulated it that the keenest observer would have been
deceived, and raising Paul, still kneeling at her feet, she led him
through the flower-tangled and shrub-obstructed walks of her wild
garden to a where the vegetation, less dense, allowed the sea to show
like an azure dream of the infinite. The luminous serenity dispelled
Paul's dark thoughts. Alicia leaned upon his arm as if they were
already man and wife, and in this mute and pure caress, meaningless
in any other woman but decisive in her case, she gave him herself to
him more formally still, reassured him, and gave him to understand
how little she feared the dangers with which she was said to be
threatened. Although she had at once imposed silence on Vice, and on
her uncle, and although Count d'Altavilla had refused to name any
one, she had quickly understood it was Paul d'Aspremont who was
meant, for the mysterious remarks plainly pointed to him. She had
noticed that Paul himself, sharing the prejudice so widespread in
Naples that turns into a jettatore any man whose face is somewhat out
of the common, had through incredible weakness on his part, to
believe himself a victim of the fascino, and that he deliberately
avoided looking at her in order not to hurt her by his glance. It was
in order to react against this incipient mania that she had brought
about the scene I have just described, but which had a result very
different from that she had intended, since it confirmed, even more
than before, Paul's sad conviction.</p>

<p>They returned to the terrace, where the Commodore, still under the
influence of the music, was melodiously sleeping in his rattan
arm-chair. Paul took leave, and Alicia, imitating the Neapolitan
gesture of farewell, blew a kiss to him on her finger tips, and said,
in a voice full of suave caresses, "Good-bye till to-morrow, Paul.
You will be sure to come, will you not?"</p>

<p>The Commodore, aroused by Paul's departure, was struck by Alicia's
radiant, alarming, almost supernatural beauty. The whites of her eyes
had a burnished silver tone in which flashed her pupils like luminous
black stars; her checks were ideally rosy, and of a purity and warmth
no painter ever knew; her temples, transparent as agates, were veined
with a network of delicate blue lines, while her flesh seemed to be
interpenetrated by sunbeams, so that her soul appeared to be breaking
out of her.</p>

<p>"How beautiful you are to-day, Alicia," said the Commodore.</p>

<p>"You flatter me, uncle. It is not your fault if I am not the most
conceited girl in the United Kingdom. Happily I do not believe
flatterers, even when disinterested."</p>

<p>"Beautiful, dangerously beautiful," went on Commodore, speaking to
himself. "She is the living image of her poor mother, Nancy, who died
at nineteen. Angels like them cannot remain on earth. A mere breath
blows them away, and invisible wings seem to grow on their shoulders.
They are too fair, too pure, too perfect; they lack the red, coarse
blood of life, and God, who lends them to this earth for few days,
hastens to recall them to Himself. Her supreme brilliancy of beauty
saddens me as though it were a farewell."</p>

<p>"Well, uncle," said Miss Ward, who noted darkening of her uncle's
brow; "if I am so pretty, is time I were married. The veil and orange
wreath will become me."</p>

<p>"Marry! Are you in such a hurry to leave your old uncle?"</p>

<p>"I shall not leave you, for it is agreed with Mr. d'Aspremont that
we are to live all together. You know very well that I cannot do
without you."</p>

<p>"Mr. d'Aspremont is all very well, but he is not your husband
yet."</p>

<p>"Your word and mine are both pledged to him, and you have never
broken yours."</p>

<p>"He has my pledged word, there is no doubt of that," replied the
Commodore, somewhat embarrassed.</p>

<p>"And is it not some days since the six months' delay you wished
for came to an end?" said Alicia, whose rosy checks became rosier
yet.</p>

<p>"So you have been counting the months, my girl. Well, there is no
trusting you demure ones."</p>

<p>"I love Mr. d'Aspremont," replied Alicia, gravely.</p>

<p>"There's the rub," jerked out Sir Joshua Ward, who, filled with
the notions put into his head by Vice and Count d'Altavilla, did not
at all care to have a jettatore for a son-in-law.</p>

<p>"I have but one heart," returned Alicia, "and but one love, even
if, like my mother, I were to die at nineteen."</p>

<p>"Die!" exclaimed the Commodore; "pray do not utter such a horrible
thing."</p>

<p>"Have you anything to urge against Mr. d'Aspremont?"</p>

<p>"Nothing whatever."</p>

<p>"Has he shown himself dishonourable in any way? His be once proved
cowardly, vile, untruthful, or perfidious? Has he ever insulted a
woman backed down before a man? Is there any secret stain upon his
crest? Would a girl, entering society as his wife, have to blush for
him or cast her eyes down?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Paul d'Aspremont is a perfect gentleman, and absolutely
respectable."</p>

<p>"You may be sure, uncle, that, if he were not, I should at once
give him up, and bury myself in some inaccessible retreat; but I
shall not break my plighted word for any other reason. You understand
me?" said Miss Ward, gently but firmly.</p>

<p>The Commodore was twiddling his thumbs, his recourse when
bothered.</p>

<p>"Why are you so cool towards Paul nowadays?" went on Miss Ward.
"You used to be so fond him; you could not do without him when we
were in Lincolnshire; and when you shook hands with him, crushed his
fingers in doing so, you said he was a fine fellow, to whom you would
not hesitate to confide girl's happiness."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, I was very fond of him," said Commodore, moved by
the remembrances called up niece. "But what is not so plain when
shrouded in English fogs, is plain enough in the Neapolitan
sunshine."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Alicia, whose bright colour suddenly
faded away and who turned as white as an alabaster statue upon a
tombstone, while her voice trembled.</p>

<p>"I mean that Paul is a jettatore."</p>

<p>"What, uncle! you, Sir Joshua Ward, a Christian gentleman and a
subject of Her Majesty; you, a retired naval officer, and an
enlightened and civilised man, so often consulted on so many matters;
you who have education and wisdom, and who daily read your Bible, you
do not hesitate to accuse Paul of jettatura? Oh! I did not expect
that from you."</p>

<p>"I may be all you say, my dear Alicia," replied the Commodore,
"when your happiness is not at stake, but when a danger, even if
imaginary only, threatens you, I become more superstitious than a
peasant of the Abruzzi, a lazzaroni on the Mole, a Chiaja ostricajo,
a maid servant of Terra di Lavoro, or even a Neapolitan Count. Paul
may glare at me as much as he likes with his cross look; I shall
remain as cool as in front of a rapier point or a pistol barrel.
Fascino can have no hold on me, who have been burned, tanned, and
baked by every sun. It is only where you concerned, my dear, that I
am credulous, and I confess that I feel a cold sweat all over me when
that unfortunate fellow's glance rests upon you. I know very that he
has no evil intentions and that he loves you better than his own
life, but it seems to me that when he does look at you your features
change, your color goes, and you strive to hide keen pain. Then I do
feel like tearing out his eyes with the Count's horns."</p>

<p>"Poor dear uncle," said Alicia, moved by the Commodore's warmth.
"Our lives are in God's hands. Not a prince dies on his state bed,
not a sparrow under the slates, unless the appointed time has come.
Fascino has nothing to do with it, and it is wicked to suppose that a
more or less oblique glance can have any influence upon our fate.
Come, nunky," continued she, using the term of familiar endearment of
the jester in King Lear, "you were not serious in what you just now.
Your love for me biassed your judgment, usually so sound. I am sure
you would never dare say to Paul that you cannot now give him your
niece's hand and that you do not want him to marry into family
because he is a jettatore."</p>

<p>"By Joshua, my namesake, who stopped the the sun, I shall not
hesitate to speak my mind to your hand--some Paul," cried the
Commodore. "What do I care whether I am ridiculous and absurd, or
whether I break my word even, when it is a question of your health? I
pledged my word to a man, not to a jettatore. I have promised, it is
true, and I shall simply not keep my promise, If he is not satisfied,
I am ready to give him satisfaction."</p>

<p>And the exasperated Commodore lunged out without thinking of the
gout that tortured him.</p>

<p>"Sir Joshua Ward, you will not do so," said Alicia, with calm
dignity.</p>

<p>The Commodore fell back in his arm-chair quite out of breath, and
remained silent.</p>

<p>"Granting that the shameful and stupid charge were true, uncle, is
it a reason for dismissing Mr. d'Aspremont and turning his misfortune
into a Crime? You acknowledge yourself that the harm he may do is
done unconsciously, and that no man was ever more loving, generous,
and noble."</p>

<p>"One does not marry a vampire, however good his intentions may
be," replied the Commodore.</p>

<p>"But that is all nonsense and extravagant superstition. The one
bit of truth in the whole business is that Paul has taken it
seriously, and is terrified under the spell of a hallucination. He
has come believe in his fatal power, is afraid of himself, for every
slight accident, unnoticed by him formerly, confirms his belief, for
he now fancies it is caused by him. It is not my part, since I am his
wife before God and shall be so before men, with your blessing, uncle
dear, is it not my part, I say, to calm his over excited imagination,
to drive away these vain shadows, to dispel, apparent and real
trustfulness, his haggard anxiety, sister of monomania, and to save,
by making him happy, his troubled soul and his imperilled mind?"</p>

<p>"You are right, as usual, Alicia," answered Commodore, "and I am
only an old fool. I do believe Vice is a witch, who has upset me with
her stories. As for Count d'Altavilla, he strikes me at present, with
his horns and his cabalistic gimcracks, as being very ridiculous. No
doubt it was a trick to get Paul out of the way so that he might get
you himself."</p>

<p>"It is possible that Count d'Altavilla has acted in good faith,"
said Miss Ward, smiling. "But now you were of his opinion."</p>

<p>"Do not hit a man when he is down, my dear. Besides I might fall
away again, for I have not quite got rid of my erroneous ideas. The
best thing we can do is to leave Naples by the next steamer, and go
quietly back to England. When Paul ceases to see around him bulls'
horns, stags' heads, pointed fingers, coral amulets, and all the rest
of these diabolical inventions, he will grow calmer, and I also shall
forget the nonsense which nearly led me to break my word and to act
as no gentleman should act. You shall marry Paul, since you have
agreed to do so; you shall keep for me the sitting-room and bedroom
on the ground-floor of our Richmond home, and the octagonal tower in
our Lincolnshire castle, and we shall live happily together. If your
health requires that you should go to a milder climate, we shall rent
a country house near Tours, or else at Cannes, where Lord Brougham
has a fine property, and where these damnable jettatura superstitions
are unknown, thank God! What say you to that, Alicia?"</p>

<p>"You do not need my approval; am I not the most obedient of
nieces?"</p>

<p>"Yes, when you have your own way, you minx," said the Commodore
with a smile as he retired to his own room.</p>

<p>Alicia remained a few moments longer on the terrace, but, whether
the scene she had gone through had induced feverishness in her, or
whether Paul really exercised over the young girl an influence such
as the Commodore dreaded, she shivered with cold as the evening
breeze blew upon her gauze-covered shoulders, and that night, feeling
unwell, she begged Vice to spread over her feet, cold and white as
marble, one of those Harlequin rugs that are manufactured in
Venice.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the glow-worms sparkled in the grass, the cicalas were
chirping, and the great golden moon rose in the heavens out of a haze
of heat.</p>

<h3>Chapter 11</h3>

<p>THE next day, Alicia, who had had a bad night, scarcely touched
the drink brought her by Vice, as was her daily habit, and she placed
it languidly upon the table at her bedhead. She did not suffer from
any pain in particular; it was rather that she felt worn out, that
she found it difficult to live; and she would have experienced some
difficulty in stating the symptoms of her trouble to a physician.</p>

<p>She ordered Vice to bring her a mirror, for girls are more
concerned with the change in their looks due to suffering than with
suffering itself. She was extremely pale; two little spots only, like
two rose leaves fallen upon a cup of milk, showed on her pallid
cheeks. Her eyes shone with unaccustomed brilliancy, filled with the
last flashes of fever, but her cherry lips had paled and, in order to
restore their brightness, she bit them with her pearly teeth.</p>

<p>She rose, put on a white cashmere wrapper, twisted a gauze scarf
around her head, for, in spite of the heat that kept the cicalas
chirping, she felt shivery, and went out on the terrace at her
accustomed time in order to avoid awaking the ever watchful
solicitude of the Commodore. She barely tasted her breakfast, though
she forced herself to do so, as the least symptom of illness would
have been attributed by the Commodore to Paul's influence, and this
Alicia desired above all things to avoid. Then, under pretext that
the blinding light of day tired her, she withdrew to her room, after
having several times repeated to her uncle, who was very suspicious
in such matters, that she was particularly well that morning.</p>

<p>"Particularly well," said the Commodore to himself when she had
gone; "I am not so sure of that. She had pearly tones round the eyes
and a bright colour on her cheeks, exactly like her poor mother, who
also used to insist that she had never felt better. What had I best
do? If I were to make her break off her engagement to Paul, I should
be merely killing her in another way. Best leave Nature to herself;
Alicia is young yet. True, but it is the young that old Mob attacks;
it is as jealous as a woman. I might send for a physician; but what
can medicine do for an angel? Yet all the bad symptoms had
disappeared. Ah! if it be indeed you, you cursed Paul, whose breath
is withering that heavenly flower, I will strangle you with my own
hands. But Nancy did not suffer from a jettatore's glance, and yet
she died. Suppose Alicia were to die! No, no; it is impossible. What
have I done that God should inflict such pain upon me? Long ere she
dies I shall be under the sod, in the shadow of the church in my
native place, with Sacred to the Memory of Sir Joshua Ward upon my
tombstone. And Alicia will come and weep upon the gray stone over the
old Commodore. I do not know what is the matter with me this morning;
I am as low-spirited and dull as it is possible to be."</p>

<p>By way of dispelling these dark thoughts, the Commodore added a
little Jamaica rum to his cup of tea, now grown cold, and called for
his hookah, an innocent indulgence he allowed himself only when
Alicia was absent, for her sensitiveness might have suffered even
from that light-scented smoke.</p>

<p>He had already got the perfumed water bubbling and had puffed a
few bluish wreaths of smoke, when Vice appeared and announced Count
d'Altavilla.</p>

<p>"Sir Joshua," said the Count, after the exchange of the ordinary
civilities, "have you thought over the request I had the honour of
making of you the other day?"</p>

<p>"Ihave thought it over," replied the Commodore, "but, as you are
aware, I am pledged to Mr. Paul d'Aspremont."</p>

<p>"I am aware of the fact. Yet there are cases in which a pledge may
be withdrawn. For instance, when the person to whom it has been made
turns out to be different from what he was believed to be."</p>

<p>"Speak more plainly, Count."</p>

<p>"I dislike speaking ill of a rival, but after the conversation we
had, you cannot help understanding me. If you were to refuse Mr. Paul
d'Aspremont's suit, would you allow me to come forward?"</p>

<p>"For my own part I can answer in the affirmative but it is not
quite as sure that Miss Ward would approve of the change. She is very
much in love with Paul, and it is somewhat my fault, for I favoured
his suit myself before hearing all this nonsense. Pray forgive me,
Count, for putting it in that way, but I am all upset."</p>

<p>"Do you want your niece to die?" said d'Altavilla, in a tone of
deep emotion.</p>

<p>"Blood and thunder! My niece die!" exclaimed the Commodore,
springing from his arm-chair and dropping the morocco tube of his
hookah, for he was very sensitive on this point. "Is she dangerously
ill?"</p>

<p>"Do not be so easily alarmed, sir. Miss Ward may live a long time
yet." "I am glad to hear that; you terrified me."</p>

<p>"On one condition, however," continued Coun d'Altavilla, "that she
shall cease to see Mr. Paul d'Aspremont."</p>

<p>"The jettatura again! Unfortunately, Miss Ward does not believe in
it."</p>

<p>"Listen to me," said the Count quietly. "The first time I met Miss
Alicia at the Prince of Syracuse's ball, and began to love her with a
love as respectful as it was deep, I was struck at once by the
brilliant health, the joy of life, and the bloom of strength which
radiated from her. Her beauty was positively luminous and seemed to
float in an atmosphere of well-being. She shone in that
phosphorescence like a star; Englishwomen, Russians, and Italians
paled by her side. I could look at no one but her. To her English
high-breeding she united the clean, strong grace of the goddesses of
antiquity. Forgive my indulging in mythology, but I am descended from
one of the Greek colonies."</p>

<p>"She was indeed splendid. Miss Edwina O'Hara, Lady Eleanor Lilly,
Mrs. Jane Strangford, and Princess Vera Federeovna Bariatinski turned
yellow with envy," returned the delighted Commodore.</p>

<p>"And now do you not notice that her beauty has become somewhat
languid, that her features have acquired a morbid delicacy, that the
veins on her hands show bluer than they should, and that the sound of
her voice has a troubled vibration and a painful charm? The earthly
in her is vanishing and making way for the angelic. She is attaining
an ethereal perfection that, at the cost of your thinking me too
materialistic, I must own I do not care to see in the daughters of
our earth."</p>

<p>The Count's words corresponded so accurately with the secret
preoccupation of Sir Joshua Ward that the latter remained for some
moments silent and apparently sunk in deep thought.</p>

<p>"I have not yet done," went on the Count. "Had Miss Ward's health
caused you any anxiety previous to the arrival of Mr. d'Aspremont in
England?"</p>

<p>"Never once. She was the brightest and most blooming girl in the
kingdom."</p>

<p>"You see, then, that Mr. d'Aspremont's presence coincides with the
periods of ill-health that are undermining Miss Ward's life. I do not
ask you, a northerner, to credit implicitly a belief, a prejudice, a
superstition, if you please, that prevails throughout our Southern
lands, but you must confess that the facts are startling and deserve
attention."</p>

<p>"May there not be a natural cause in her case?" said the
Commodore, shaken by the Count's specious reasoning, but held back by
his English conservatism from adopting the popular belief.</p>

<p>"Miss Ward is not ill; she is poisoned, as it were, by Mr.
d'Asprernont's glance. If he is not a jettatore, he is at the least
maleficent."</p>

<p>"But what can I do? She is in love with him, laughs at jettatura,
and pretends that one cannot refuse an honourable man for such a
reason."</p>

<p>"I have no right to interfere on behalf of your niece. I am
neither her brother, her relative, nor her betrothed; but if I could
get your consent, there is one thing I might try in order to withdraw
her from that fatal influence. Do not be afraid; I shall no commit
any extravagance. Young though I am, I am well aware that a woman
must not be talked about. Permit me only not to reveal my plan to you
and believe me when I say that it does not involve anything that the
most punctiliously honourable man might not confess openly."</p>

<p>"You are very much in love with my niece, are you not?" said the
Commodore.</p>

<p>"I am, and my love is hopeless. But do you grant me leave to
act?"</p>

<p>"You are a terrible fellow, Count d'Altavilla. Well, try to save
Alicia in your own way; not only do I not object, I approve."</p>

<p>The Count rose, bowed, got into his carriage, and ordered the
coachman to drive to the Hotel de Rome.</p>

<p>Paul was leaning on the table, his head in his hands, plunged in
the most painful reflections. He had caught sight of the two or three
drops of blood on Alicia's handkerchief, and still under the spell of
his conviction, he blamed himself for his deadly love and reproached
himself for accepting the devotion of the lovely girl who was ready
to die for him; and he was wondering what superhuman sacrifice he
could accomplish that would repay such sublime unselfishness.</p>

<p>His groom Paddy interrupted his meditations as he brought in Count
d'Altavilla's card.</p>

<p>"Count d'Altavilla! What can he possibly want with me?" said Paul,
greatly surprised. "Show him in."</p>

<p>When the Neapolitan gentleman appeared at the door d'Aspremont had
already masked his astonishment with the look of cold indifference
under which men of the world conceal their feelings.</p>

<p>"Sir," began the Count, while toying with the charms on his watch
chain, "what I am about to say to you is so strange, so improper, so
out of place, that you would be justified in throwing me out of the
window. Spare yourself so brutal a proceeding, for I am ready to give
you satisfaction as a gentleman."</p>

<p>"I am listening, sir; reserving to myself the right of availing
myself of your offer later, in the event of a your remarks proving
unpleasant to me," replied Paul, steadfastly.</p>

<p>"You are a jettatore."</p>

<p>At these words d'Aspremont's face suddenly turned ashy green, and
a red ring formed around his eyes; he bent his brows, the wrinkle in
his forehead deepened, and a sulphurous light flashed from his eyes.
He half rose, scoring with his nails the mahogany arms of his chair.
It was so--terrible that d'Altavilla, brave though he was, seized one
of the tiny forked branches of coral hanging on his watch chain, and
instinctively directed the points of it towards Paul.</p>

<p>By a supreme effort of the will, d'Aspremont sat down again and
said:--</p>

<p>"You were right, sir; I ought to throw you out of the window for
your insult, but I shall have the patience to await another form of
reparation."</p>

<p>"Believe me," went on the Count, "when I say that I should not
offer such an insult, which blood alone can wash out, to a gentleman
were I not impelled to it by the gravest of motives."</p>

<p>"What is that to me?"</p>

<p>"It matters little to you, as you say, for you are fortunate in
your love, but I, Don Felipe d'Altavilla, I forbid you to see Miss
Alicia Ward again."</p>

<p>"I take no orders from you."</p>

<p>"I know that," answered the Neapolitan Count, "and I do not,
therefore, expect that you will obey me."</p>

<p>"Then what is your reason for acting as you are doing?"</p>

<p>"I am convinced that the fascination with which you are
unfortunately endowed acts fatally upon Miss Alicia Ward. It is an
absurd notion, a prejudice worthy of the Middle Ages, which no doubt
strikes you as profoundly ridiculous. I do not propose to discuss
that side of the question with you. Your eyes when turned upon Miss
Ward cast upon her, in spite of yourself, a fatal glance which will
be her death. I have no other means of preventing that sad result
than picking an apparently causeless quarrel with you. In the
sixteenth century I should have had you killed by one of my highland
peasants, but that sort of thing is not good form nowadays. I did
think of begging you to return to France, but it was too absurd. You
would have laughed at a rival, who, under pretext of jettatura,
requested you to depart and to leave him alone with your future
bride."</p>

<p>While the Count was speaking, Paul d'Aspremont felt himself a prey
to a secret horror. He, a Christian, was then really the plaything of
the powers of Hell, and the Evil One in person looked out of his
eyes! Catastrophes followed in his train, and his love was deadly!
For a moment his reason tottered on its throne, and madness fluttered
in his brain.</p>

<p>"On your honour, Count, do you believe what you have just said to
me?" He exclaimed after a few minutes' reflection during which the
Neapolitan spoke no word.</p>

<p>"On my honour, I do believe it."</p>

<p>"Then it is true," murmured Paul, "and I am a murderer, a fiend, a
vampire. I am killing that heavenly girl and driving that old man to
despair."</p>

<p>He was on the point of promising the Count not again to see
Alicia, but human respect and jealousy awaking in his heart kept back
the words he was about to utter.</p>

<p>"I will not conceal from you, Count, that I am even now going to
call on Miss Ward."</p>

<p>"I shall not take you by the scruff of the neck to prevent your
doing so. You refrained from assaulting me a moment since, and I am
grateful to you for that, but I shall he delighted to see you
to-morrow, at six o'clock, in the ruins of Pompeii, let us say in the
Thermx; it is a very suitable spot. What weapons do you prefer? You
have the choice, as it is I who have insulted you. Shall it be
rapiers, swords, or pistols?"</p>

<p>"We shall fight with knives, blindfolded, and separated by the
length of a handkerchief of which we shall each hold one end. We must
even up the chances; I am a jettatore, and I should only have to look
at you to kill you, Count."</p>

<p>And Paul laughed stridently, threw open a door, and
disappeared.</p>

<h3>Chapter 12</h3>

<p>ALICIA had settled herself in a low room in the house, the walls
of which were decorated with the landscapes in fresco, that, in
Italy, take the place of wall-papers. The floor was covered with
Manila matting. A table, on which was thrown a Turkish cloth, whereon
lay volumes of verse, Coleridge, Shelley, Tennyson, and Longfellow, a
mirror in an antique frame, and a few cane chairs formed the
furniture. Blinds of China reeds, adorned with pagodas, rocks,
willows, storks, and dragons, fitted to the openings and half drawn
up, allowed a soft light to filter in. The branch of an orange tree'
laden with flowers that the swelling fruit caused to fall, entered
the room familiarly and spread like a garland above Alicia's head,
scattering upon her its perfumed blooms.</p>

<p>The young girl, somewhat unwell, was lying upon a narrow sofa by
the window, supported by two or three morocco cushions and her feet
wrapped up in the Venetian rug. The book she had been reading had
slipped from her hands; her eyes, under their long lashes, had a
far-away look and seemed to be gazing into the world beyond. She was
experiencing that almost voluptuous weariness that follows upon an
attack of fever, and she was busy chewing the orange blossoms she
picked up on her coverlet and of which she enjoyed the bitter savour.
Schiavone has painted a Venus chewing roses, and a modern artist
might have made a companion piece to the old Venetian master's
painting by representing Alicia biting away at the orange
blossoms.</p>

<p>She was thinking of Paul d'Aspremont, and wondering whether she
would really live long enough to become his wife; not that she
believed in the influence of jettatura, but that she was, in spite of
herself, a prey to the gloomiest presentiments. That very night she
had had a dream the impression of which had not been dispelled by her
waking.</p>

<p>In that dream she had seen herself lying down, but awake, and
looking at the door of the room with the feeling that some one was
about to enter. After a few moments of anxious waiting, she had
perceived against the dark background of the door a slender white
form which, transparent at first, and allowing the various objects to
be seen through it as through a faint mist, had acquired greater
consistency as it approached her.</p>

<p>The shade wore a muslin dress the long folds of which dragged on
the ground; long black curls, half undone, hung mournfully down
either side of her face, on the cheek-bones of which showed two
bright red spots. The bosom and neck were so white that they could
scarcely be distinguished from the dress, and it was impossible to
say where the skin ended and where the stuff began. A very fine
Venetian necklace circled the slender neck with its golden line, and
in the delicate, blue-veined hand she held a tea-rose, the petals of
which were falling to the ground like tears.</p>

<p>Alicia had never known her mother, who had died a year after
giving birth to her, but she often gazed long at a faded miniature,
the ivory tone and the almost vanished colouring of which, wan as the
resemblance of the dead, made one think of the portrait of a shadow
rather than of that of a living woman, and she understood that the
woman who had entered the room was her mother, Nancy Ward. The white
dress, the Venetian necklace, the flower in the hand, the black hair,
the cheeks with their red spots,--nothing was lacking.</p>

<p>It was indeed the original of the miniature, taller and larger,
moving in the reality of a dream.</p>

<p>Love and terror made Alicia's heart beat fast. She tried to hold
her arms out to the shade, but they were heavy as lead and she could
not raise them from the couch on which she lay. She strove to speak,
but could only utter confused sounds.</p>

<p>Nancy, having placed the tea-rose upon the table, knelt by the bed
and laid her cheek against Alici's breast, listening to the working
of the lungs and noting the beating of the heart. The shade's cold
cheek felt like ice to the young girl, terrified by the silent
auscultation.</p>

<p>The apparition rose, cast a sorrowful glance upon the maiden, and
counting the petals of the rose, some of which had fallen since she
had placed it on the table, said, "There is but one left." Then sleep
had interposed its dark gauze between the sleeper and the shade, and
night had swallowed up everything.</p>

<p>Had her mother's soul come to warn her and to fetch her? What was
the meaning of the mysterious words that had dropped from the shadowy
lips, "There is but one left?" Was the fading rose with the falling
petals a symbol of her own life? The strange dream, with its graceful
terrors and its awesome charm, the lovely spectre draped in muslin
and counting the petals of the flower had taken fast hold of the
girl's imagination. A shadow of melancholy brooded upon her lovely
brow, and the sombre wings of dread presentiments swept across her
face.</p>

<p>Had not the orange branch that shook its blooms down upon her also
a funereal meaning? Were the little virginal stars not to open under
her bridal veil? Sorrowful and preoccupied, Alicia withdrew from her
lips the bloom she was biting; the bloom was already yellowed and
faded!</p>

<p>It was nearly the hour when Paul d'Aspremont would call. Alicia
pulled herself together, smoothed her face, curled her ringlets,
arranged the folds of her somewhat rumpled gauze scarf, and picked up
her book to give herself the air of being occupied.</p>

<p>Paul entered and Miss Ward welcomed him with a playful glance, for
she did not wish him to feel any alarm at seeing her lying down, as
he would infallibly have believed himself to have caused her illness.
The scene with Count d'Altavilla had left on Paul's face a look of
irritation and fierceness which led Vice to make the sign of
protection, but Alicia's loving smile speedily dispelled the cloud on
her lover's face.</p>

<p>"You are not seriously ill, I trust," he said as he sat down by
her.</p>

<p>"It is nothing; I am a little over tired; the African sirocco that
was blowing yesterday wore me out, but you shall see how well I shall
be when we get back to Lincolnshire. Now that I am strong again, we
shall take turns in rowing upon the lake."</p>

<p>But even as she spoke, she could not keep back a fit of coughing.
D'Aspremont turned pale and looked away, and for a few moments
silence reigned in the room.</p>

<p>"I have never given you anything, Paul," went on Alicia, removing
from her wasted finger a plain gold ring. "Take this ring and wear it
in remembrance of me. I dare say it will go on your finger, for your
hand is almost as small as a woman's. And now, good-bye; I feel tired
and I should like to try to sleep. Be sure to come to see me
to-morrow."</p>

<p>Paul went away broken-hearted. Alicia had in vain tried to conceal
her sufferings; he loved her madly, and he was killing her. The very
ring she had just given him, was it not the symbol of their betrothal
in another life?</p>

<p>He wandered along the beach, nearly out of his senses, planning
flight, bethinking himself of entering a Trappist monastery and
awaiting death seated on a coffin without ever raising the cowl of
his frock. He called himself a coward and an ingrate for not having
the strength to sacrifice his love, and taking a mean advantage of
Alicia's love; for it was plain that she knew everything, that he was
a jettatore, as Count d'Altavilla had said; yet, full of angelic
pity, she would not repel him.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said to himself, "that handsome Neapolitan, that Count
whom she disdains, is really in love. His love shames mine, since, in
order to save Alicia, he did not fear to attack and challenge me, a
jettatore, that is, as he sees it, a being as much to be dreaded as
the fiend himself. While he spoke to me, he was toying with his
amulets, and the glance of that famous duellist who has slain three
men fell before mine."</p>

<p>On his return to the Hotel de Rome, Paul wrote a few letters, drew
up a will in which he left all he possessed, save a legacy to Paddy,
to Miss Ward, and took the various precautions which a gentleman
takes when about to engage in a duel to the death.</p>

<p>He opened the rose-wood cases in which he kept his weapons in
compartments lined with green serge, turned over the rapiers, the
pistols, and the hunting-knives, and at last came upon a couple of
Corsican stilettoes, absolutely identical, which he had purchased
with the intention of giving them to his friends. The blades were of
pure steel, stout near the hilt, and double edged towards the point,
damascened, curiously terrible, and carefully mounted. He also
selected three silk handkerchiefs and made a bundle of the lot. Then
he sent word to Scazziga to be ready very early in the morning for an
excursion into the country.</p>

<p>"May the duel prove fatal to me," said he as he threw himself on
the bed. "If I am only lucky enough to be killed, Alicia will
live."</p>

<h3>Chapter 13</h3>

<p>POMPEII, the dead city, does not awake in the morning like living
cities, and although it has partially thrown back the covering of
ashes that has lain over it for so many centuries, it remains asleep
on its funereal couch even when the night has passed away.</p>

<p>At that time the tourists of all nations who visit it during the
day are still in their beds, worn out by their fatiguing excursions,
and dawn, as it lights up the of the mummy-city, does not behold a
single human face. The lizards alone, with quivering tails, crawl
along the walls, skurry across the disjointed mosaics, heedless of
the Cave canem inscribed on the threshold of the deserted houses, and
joyously hail the beams of the rising sun. They are the dwellers who
have taken the places of the former inhabitants, it seems as though
Pompeii bad been exhumed their special benefit.</p>

<p>Strange indeed is it to see in the rose and azure of morn the dead
city that was surprised in the midst of its pleasures, of its work
and its civilisation, and which has not undergone the slow decay of
ordinary ruins. One cannot help thinking that the owners of the
houses, preserved in their smallest parts, are about to issue forth
clad in their Roman or Greek dresses; that the cars will presently be
tearing along the ruts in the pavement made by them of old; that the
topers will in a moment enter the taverns on the counters of which
the stains made by the drinking cups are still visible. One walks as
in a dream amid the scenes of the past; on the street corners may be
seen the red letter posters advertising the shows of the day--only,
the day has passed away more than seventeen centuries ago. In the
early light of morn, the dancing girls painted on the walls seem to
be clinking their crotalae, and with the tip of their white feet to
raise the rosy, foam-like edge of their draperies, believing no doubt
that the lamps are being relighted for the orgies in the triclinium.
The Venuses and the satyrs, heroic or grotesque figures, animated by
a sunbeam, attempt to take the place of the vanished inhabitants and
to provide the dead city with a painted population. The coloured
shadows tremble along the walls, and the mind may, for a few minutes,
indulge in the fancy of an evocation of antiquity.</p>

<p>On that day, however, to the great dismay of the lizards, the
matutinal serenity of Pompeii was broken by a strange visitor. A
carriage drew up at the entrance to the Street of Tombs; Paul
alighted, and walked on foot to the meeting-place.</p>

<p>He was early, and though he must have been thinking of anything
but archaeology, he could not help noticing, as he went along,
innumerable little details he probably would not have observed had he
been in his usual frame of mind. When the brain relaxes its vigilance
over the senses, these, acting for themselves, acquire occasionally
singular lucidity. A man condemned to death and on his way to the
scaffold, will mark a little flower blooming between the cracks of
the pavement, the number on the button of a soldier's uniform, a
misspelt word on a sign, and many another trifling circumstance which
becomes suddenly of enormous importance.</p>

<p>D'Aspremont passed by the Villa of Diomedes, Mamia's tomb, the
funeral hemicycles, the antique gate of the city, the houses and the
shops that line the Consular Way, almost without glancing at them,
yet the coloured and brilliant images of these monuments reached his
brain with wonderful clearness. He saw everything: the fluted pillars
overlaid half-way up with red or yellow stucco, the fresco paintings,
and the inscriptions traced on the walls. An advertisement of a house
to rent had even engraved itself so deeply in his mind that he
mechanically kept on repeating the Latin words without attaching any
meaning to them.</p>

<p>Was it the thought of the approaching duel that thus absorbed
Paul? By no means. He did not even dwell upon it; his mind was
elsewhere--in the drawing-room at Richmond. He was presenting to the
Commodore his letter of introduction, and Alicia was watching him.
She had on a white dress and--asinine blossoms in her hair. How
lovely, young, and strong she was then!</p>

<p>The old baths are at the end of the Consular Way, near the Street
of Fortune, so that d'Aspremont had no difficulty in finding them. He
entered the vaulted hall surrounded by a series of niches formed by
terra-cotta Atlases, that upbear an architrave ornamented with
foliage and figures of children. The marble overlaying, the mosaics,
and the bronze tripods have disappeared. Of the former splendour
nothing is left save the terra-cotta Atlases and the walls, bare as
those of a tomb. A faint light, filtering through a little round
window in which shows a disk of blue sky, shimmers on the broken
slabs of the pavement.</p>

<p>Here it was that the women of Pompeii were wont to come, after the
bath, to dry their lovely wet bodies, to dress their hair, to resume
their tunics, and to smile at their own beauty in the burnished brass
of the mirrors. A very different scene was about to take place there,
and blood was about to flow on the ground formerly drenched with
perfumes.</p>

<p>Presently Count d'Altavilla appeared, carrying a case of pistols
in his hand and a couple of swords under his arm, for he had taken it
for granted that d'Aspremont had not made his proposal seriously. He
had merely looked upon it as a piece of Mephistophelian raillery, of
infernal sarcasm.</p>

<p>"What do we want with those pistols and swords, Count?" said Paul
when he perceived him. "Did we not agree upon another mode of
fighting?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, but it occurred to me that you might change your mind.
No one ever fought a duel in that way."</p>

<p>"Even were we equally skilful, my position gives me too great an
advantage over you," answered Paul, with a bitter smile. "I do not
propose to avail myself of it. Here are stilettoes that I have
brought with me. Examine them; they are absolutely alike. Here are
handkerchiefs with which to blindfold ourselves; they are thick, as
you see, and my glance cannot pierce through them."</p>

<p>Count d'Altavilla bowed in acquiescence.</p>

<p>"We have no seconds," went on Paul, "and one of us must not emerge
alive from this vault. Let, us, therefore, each write a note
certifying that the fight was a fair one, and the victor shall place
it on the breast of the dead."</p>

<p>"A good idea," replied the Count, with a smile, as he wrote a few
lines on a leaf torn from Paul's book.</p>

<p>Paul did the same.</p>

<p>Then the two adversaries threw off their coats, blindfolded
themselves, seized their stilettoes, and took hold each of one end of
the handkerchief, the link between their respective hatreds.</p>

<p>"Areyou ready?" asked d'Aspremont of Count d'Altavilla.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the Neapolitan, in a perfectly cool voice.</p>

<p>Don Felipe d'Altavilla was a man of tried courage, who feared
nothing on earth save jettatura, and this duel in the dark, that
would have caused any other man to tremble with terror, did not in
the least trouble him. He was simply staking his life on the issue,
and he was saved the unpleasantness of seeing his opponent glare at
him with his yellow eyes.</p>

<p>The two combatants brandished their knives, and the handkerchief
which linked them in the thick darkness drew taut. Paul and the Count
had instinctively thrown themselves back, that being the only parry
possible in so strange a duel, and their arms fell back after a
useless stab in the empty air.</p>

<p>This obscure struggle, in which each one felt death without being
able to see it approach, was horrible. Grim and silent the two
adversaries retreated, twisted around, sprang aside, struck against
each other at times, missing their stroke, or sending it too far.
There was no sound but that of the trampling of their feet and the
panting of their breasts. Once d'Altavilla felt the point of his
stiletto strike something. He stopped, thinking he had slain his
rival, and listened for the fall of the body; but it was the wall he
had struck.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" he said, as he fell on guard again. "I made sure I had
run you through."</p>

<p>"Do not speak," answered Paul; "your voice guides me."</p>

<p>And the duel went on as before.</p>

<p>Suddenly the two opponents felt the taut hand kerchief fall. A
stroke of Paul's stiletto had severed it.</p>

<p>"A truce," cried the Neapolitan. "We are loose; the handkerchief
is cut."</p>

<p>"No matter; let us go on," replied Paul.</p>

<p>A dead silence fell upon the scene. Like loyal adversaries that
they were, neither d'Aspremont nor the Count wished to take advantage
of the knowledge of the other man's position gained by the exchange
of words. They therefore took a few steps to disconcert each other,
and then be an to grope for each other in the darkness.</p>

<p>D'Aspremont stumbled on a stone. The slight sound told the
Neapolitan, who was brandishing his knife in space the direction in
which be must go. Bending low in order to spring with greater force,
he leaped forward like a tiger and struck full upon d'Aspremont's
stiletto.</p>

<p>Paul felt the point of his weapon, and felt it wet. He heard
staggering steps upon the pavement; heard a deep groan, and a body
falling heavily to the earth.</p>

<p>Horrified, he snatched off the handkerchief and beheld Count
d'Altavilla, pale and motionless, stretched on his back, and a great
red stain on his shirt just above the heart. The handsome Neapolitan
was dead!</p>

<p>Paul placed upon the Count's breast the note that certified to the
fairness of the duel, and left the baths paler in the broad daylight
than is in the moonlight the criminal whom Prud'hon has represented
as pursued by the avenging Erinnyes.</p>

<h3>Chapter 14</h3>

<p>AT about two o'clock that afternoon, a company of English
tourists, in charge of a cicerone, was visiting the ruins of Pompeii.
The island tribe, composed of a father, a mother, three tall girls,
two small boys, and a cousin, had already traversed with dull,
lack-lustre eyes, in which could be read the profound weariness
characteristic of the British race, the amphitheatre, the Tragic
Theatre, and the Comic Theatre, so quaintly collocated, the military
quarter, full of the caricatures sketched by the idle guardsmen, the
Forum, destroyed while it was undergoing repairs, the Basilica, the
Pantheon, the Temples of Venus and of Jupiter, and the shops which
line them. They all followed silently in their "Murray" the prolix
explanations of the guide, scarcely casting a look at the pillars,
the fragments of statues, the mosaics, the frescoes, and the
inscriptions.</p>

<p>They at last reached the Baths, discovered, as the guide pointed
out, in 1824. "Here stood the vapour baths; here was the furnace, and
there the cooling room." These details, imparted in Neapolitan
dialect, mingled with a few English terminations, did not appear to
greatly interest the visitors, who had already turned round in order
to go out, when Miss Ethelwina, the eldest of the young ladies, a
maiden with tow-like fair hair, and a very much freckled complexion,
started back, half-shocked, half-frightened, exclaiming:--</p>

<p>"There's a man!"</p>

<p>"No doubt some workman employed in the work of digging, who
thought this was a good place in which to enjoy a siesta, as it is
cool and shady in this vault," answered the guide. "You need not be
afraid, Miss." And he kicked the prone body. "Here, you fellow, wake
up and let their ladyships pass."</p>

<p>But the supposed sleeper did not budge.</p>

<p>"He is not sleeping, he is dead," said one of the lads, who, owing
to his smaller stature, could better make out the look of the body in
the darkness.</p>

<p>The guide bent down to examine the body and started up quickly,
his face full of terror.</p>

<p>"The man has been murdered!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Oh! how shocking to come upon such a thing," exclaimed Mrs.
Bracebridge. "Come away, Ethelwina, Kitty, and Bess," she went on.
"It is not proper for young ladies who have been well brought up to
look at so unpleasant a sight. Is there no police in this country?
Why has not the coroner removed the body?"</p>

<p>"Here is a paper," said the cousin, who was tall, stiff, and
awkward as the Laird of Dumbiedikes in "The Heart of Midlothian."</p>

<p>"True," said the guide, picking up the note placed upon
d'Altavilla's breast.</p>

<p>"Read it out," cried the islanders in a body, their curiosity
fully awakened.</p>

<p>"Let no one be sought out or prosecuted on account of my death. If
this note is found on my wound, I shall have fallen in a fair
duel.</p>

<p>"FELIPE, COUNT D'ALTAVILLA."</p>

<p>"He was a man of rank. It is most sad," said Mrs. Bracebridge,
impressed by the dead man's title.</p>

<p>"And handsome," whispered Miss Ethelwina the freckled.</p>

<p>"You cannot complain any longer of not meeting with anything
startling on our trip," said Bess to Kitty, "for if we have not been
stopped by brigands on the road from Terracina to Fondi, to come upon
a young nobleman stabbed with a stiletto in the ruins of Pompeii is
surely an adventure. There must have been some love affair at the
bottom of it, and we shall now have something Italian, picturesque,
and romantic to tell our friends. I shall make a sketch of the scene
in my album, and you can add to it some mysterious stanzas in the
Byronian style."</p>

<p>"All the same," said the guide, "the stroke was a good one, from
below upwards, quite according to rule, and no mistake."</p>

<p>Such was the funeral discourse pronounced over the body of Count
d'Altavilla.</p>

<p>Some workmen, summoned by the guide, proceeded to fetch the
police, and poor d'Altavilla's remains were conveyed to his family
seat near Salerno.</p>

<p>As for d'Aspremont, he had returned to his carriage with staring
eyes, seeing no more than a somnambulist would have done. He looked
like a statue walking along. Although the sight of the body had
filled him with the religious awe inspired by death, he did not feel
guilty and there was no remorse in his despair. Insulted in a way
that admitted of no refusal, he had accepted the duel only in the
hope of losing in it a life that was henceforth odious to him. Gifted
with a deadly glance, he had insisted upon the blindfolding in order
that fatality alone should bear the responsibility of the outcome. He
had not even struck the blow; his foe had rushed upon the blade. He
felt as sorry for d'Altavilla as if he had had nothing to do with his
death.</p>

<p>"It was my stiletto that slew him," he said to himself. "Now, if I
had looked at him in a ball-room, a chandelier would have fallen from
the ceiling and broken his head. I am as innocent as the thunderbolt,
the avalanche, the manchineel tree, as all destructive, unconscious
forces. My will has never been maleficent, my heart is full of love
and kindliness, but I know that I am a harmful being. The thunderbolt
does not know that it inflicts death, but I, who am a man, an
intelligent creature, have I not a hard duty to fulfil towards
myself? I am bound to summon myself to the bar of my own conscience
and to examine myself. Have I the right to remain on this earth where
I do nothing but work woe? Would God damn me if I were to kill myself
for love of my fellow-creatures? It is a terrible and difficult
question I dare not solve. Yet it seems to me that suicide is
excusable in a man situated as I am. But if I am mistaken? Then
throughout eternity I should be deprived of the sight of Alicia, whom
then I could gaze upon without hurting her, for the eyes of the soul
are free from the fascino. That is a risk I shall not run."</p>

<p>A sudden thought flashed through the brain of the unfortunate
jettatore, breaking in upon his mental monologue. His features
relaxed, and the peace that comes of a great resolution smoothed his
pale brow. He had come to a supreme decision.</p>

<p>"Be ye condemned, ye eyes of mine, since ye are murderous. But
before closing for ever, saturate yourselves with light, gaze upon
the sun, the blue sky, the mighty sea, the green trees, the far
horizons, the palace colonnades, the fishers' buts, the distant isles
in the bay, the white sails flitting over the deep, Vesuvius and its
plume of smoke; gaze upon all these lovely sights that you shall
never again behold, so that you may remember them. Study every form
and every tint, feast on them for the last time. To-day, whether ye
be deadly or not, ye shall rest upon every thing and intoxicate
yourselves with the glorious spectacle of creation. Come! look
around, for the curtain is about to fall between you and this earthly
scene!"</p>

<p>The carriage, at this moment, was driving along the shore. The
azure bay glittered in the light; the sky seemed made of a single
sapphire; a splendour of beauty was on all things. Paul ordered
Scazziga to pull up; he alighted, sat down upon a rock, and looked
long, long, long, as though he were striving to imbibe the infinite.
His eyes plunged into space and light, rolled as though in ecstasy,
filled themselves with the colour, and absorbed the sunshine. The
night that was about to fall upon him was to have no morrow.</p>

<p>Tearing himself away from his contemplation, d'Aspremont
re-entered his carriage and had himself driven to Miss Ward's.</p>

<p>He found her, as on the previous day, lying upon her narrow couch
in the lower room I have already described. Paul sat down opposite
her, and this time he did not keep his eyes on the ground as was his
habit since he had learned he was a jettatore.</p>

<p>Alicia's wondrously perfect beauty had become idealised through
suffering; the woman in her had almost disappeared and made way for
the angel. Her flesh had become transparent, ethereal, luminous. Her
soul shone through it as the flame through an alabaster lamp. Her
eyes were filled with the infinity of the heavens and scintillated
like stars; scarce did the mark of life show in her crimson lips.</p>

<p>A heavenly smile, like a sunbeam in a rose, illumined those lips
when she saw her lover's glance envelop her like a long caress. She
thought Paul had at last got rid of his fancies and was returning to
her happy and trustful as in the early days of their love. She held
out to him her little white, slender hand, and he kept it in his
own.</p>

<p>"So you are no longer afraid of me," she said with sweet raillery
to Paul, who still kept his glance fixed upon her.</p>

<p>"Oh! let me gaze upon you," replied d'Aspremont in a strange tone
of voice as he knelt down by her. "Let me drink in your ineffable
beauty."</p>

<p>And he eagerly contemplated Alicia's lustrous black hair, her
lovely brow as pure as that of a Greek statue, her eyes dusky blue as
a lovely night, her delicately modelled nose, her mouth with the
pearly teeth revealed by a languorous smile, her willowy, swan-like
neck, and he seemed to note each detail, each perfection as might a
painter preparing to draw a portrait from memory. He was sating
himself with the sight of the beloved one, making a collection of
remembrances, assuring himself of the outlines, going over the
contours.</p>

<p>Under his burning gaze, Alicia, fascinated and charmed,
experienced a voluptuously painful sensation, pleasantly deadly. Her
life seemed to become more intense and to be leaving her; she blushed
and paled, turned hot and cold by turns. In another moment her soul
would have fled.</p>

<p>She put her hand on Paul's eyes, but his glance traversed the
transparent and frail fingers like a flame.</p>

<p>Now my eyes may close for ever, for in my heart I shall see her
for ever, said Paul to himself as he rose to his feet.</p>

<p>That night, after having looked at the sunset--the last he was to
behold--he ordered, on his return to the Hotel de Rome, a brazier and
charcoal.</p>

<p>"Does he propose to asphyxiate himself?" wondered Virgilio
Falsacappa, as he handed Paddy the required articles. "It is the best
thing that cursed jettatore could do."</p>

<p>Alicia's betrothed opened the window, contrary to Falsacappa's
expectation, lighted the coals, plunged the blade of a dagger into
them, and waited until the steel had become red hot.</p>

<p>The thin blade soon showed white-hot in the burning coals. Paul,
as if to bid himself farewell, leaned on the mantelpiece in front of
a tall mirror that reflected the light of a candelabrum with a number
of candles. He gazed with melancholy curiosity upon that sort of
spectre that was himself, that envelope of his thought he was never
again to see.</p>

<p>"Farewell," he said, "farewell, pale phantom that for so many
years I have dragged through life; farewell, sinister failure in
which beauty mingles with horror; mould of clay stamped on the brow
with a fatal sign; contorted mask of a tender and gentle soul! Thou
art about to vanish for ever from my sight. Living, I plunge thee
into eternal darkness, and soon I shall have forgotten thee as one
forgets the dream of a night of storm. In vain shalt thou say, thou
wretched body, to my inflexible will, 'Hubert, Hubert, my poor eyes!'
Thou shalt not soften it. Come, let me to work, for I am both the
victim and the executioner."</p>

<p>And he left the chimneypiece to seat himself on his bed.</p>

<p>He blew upon the coals in the brazier that stood on a table near
by, and seized by the hilt the blade, from which flew with a
crackling sound bright, white sparks.</p>

<p>At this crucial moment, firm as was his resolve, d'Aspremont felt
himself turn faint; a cold sweat bathed his temples; but he soon
overcame this purely physical weakness and put the burning steel
close to his eyes.</p>

<p>He nearly screamed as he felt a sharp, lancinating pain. It seemed
to him that two jets of molten lead were entering his eyes and
penetrating to his very brain. He let fall the dagger, which rolled
to the floor and charred it.</p>

<p>A dense, opaque darkness, in comparison with which the deepest
night is as brightest day, shrouded him in its black veils. He turned
his head in the direction of the mantelpiece where the tapers must
have been still burning, but met only profound, impenetrable
obscurity, in which did not even show the faint gleams which seeing
people behold when with closed eyes they find themselves in presence
of a light. His sacrifice was accomplished.</p>

<p>"Now," said Paul, "thou noble and charming creature, I may become
thy husband without becoming a murderer. No longer shalt thou waste
away under my destructive glance; thou shalt regain thy health. Alas!
I shall see thee no more, but thy celestial image shall shine with
immortal brilliancy in my memory; I shall behold thee with the eyes
of the soul; I shall hear thy voice, more harmonious than the
sweetest music; I shall feel the air displaced by thy motions; I
shall notice the silken rustling of thy dress, the faint creaking of
thy shoes; I shall breathe the soft scent that emanates from thee,
forming an atmosphere round thee. At times thou shalt leave thy hand
in mine to make me feel thy presence; thou wilt deign to guide thy
poor blind lover when his steps hesitate upon their dark way; thou
shalt read him the poets, and tell him of the paintings and the
statues. Thy speech shall restore to him the vanished universe; thou
shalt be his one thought, his one dream. Freed from the distraction
of things and the dazzling light, his soul shall fly to thee on
unwearying wings. So I regret nothing, since thou art saved. What
have I lost, indeed? The monotonous spectacle of the seasons and the
days; of the more or less picturesque setting of the scenes in which
the many differing acts of the sad human comedy are played, earth,
heaven, waters, mountains, trees, and flowers: vain appearances,
wearisome repetitions, unchanging form s. He who possesses love,
possesses the true sunshine, the light that never fails."</p>

<p>Thus did the unfortunate Paul d'Aspremont commune with himself, a
prey to lyrical excitement mingled with the delirium due to pain.
Little by little the acute suffering was dulled, and he fell into
dark sleep, brother of death and like it a consoler.</p>

<p>When daylight penetrated into the room, it did not wake him.
Midnight and noon were henceforth the same to him, but the bells,
ringing out the Angelus with joyous peals, sounded faint through his
sleep and, gradually becoming more distinct, drew him from his
condition of somnolence.</p>

<p>He opened his eyelids, and, ere his soul had recollected,
experienced a horrible sensation. His eyes opened out upon the void,
the darkness, the nothingness, as if, having been buried alive, he
had awakened out of a trance and found himself in his coffin. He soon
recovered, however, for was it not to be always thus? Was he not, day
by day, to pass from the darkness of sleep to the darkness of
waking?</p>

<p>He groped round for the bell-rope. Paddy hastened to answer his
ring, and as he manifested surprise at seeing his master rise with
the hesitating movements of a blind man,---</p>

<p>"I was imprudent enough to sleep with the window open," said Paul,
in order to cut short all explanations, "and I think I have got
amaurosis. I shall soon be better. Lead me to my arm-chair and put a
glass of fresh water by my side."</p>

<p>Paddy, with true English discretion, made no comment, carried out
his master's orders, and withdrew.</p>

<p>Left alone, Paul dipped his handkerchief in the cold water and
held it to his eyes to deaden the inflammation due to the
burning.</p>

<p>But let me leave d'Aspremont in his painful immobility, and let me
turn to the other characters in my story.</p>

<p>The strange news of Count d'Altavilla's death had quickly spread
through Naples and furnished food for innumerable conjectures, each
more absurd than the others. The Count was famed for his skill as a
swordsman; he had the reputation of being one of the most expert
fencers of the Neapolitan school, so dangerous on the
duelling-ground. He had killed three men and had grievously wounded
five or six. His reputation in this respect was so well known that he
was no longer called out; the most insolent duellists saluted him
respectfully, and, if he happened to look insultingly at them,
avoided treading on his toes. Had one of these swashbucklers slain
d'Altavilla, he would not have failed to brag of the victory.</p>

<p>There remained the possibility of murder, but that was removed by
the paper found on the dead man's breast. The authenticity of the
note was at first called in question, but the Count's handwriting was
vouched for by persons who had received many letters from him. The
fact that he had been blindfolded, for the body was found with a
handkerchief fastened round the head, proved an insurmountable
difficulty. Besides the stiletto driven into the Count's breast, a
second one was found, which no doubt had fallen from his hand. On the
other hand, if the duel had been fought with knives, what was the
purpose of the swords and pistols which were recognised as having
been the Count's property? The coachman, on being questioned, stated
that he had driven his master to Pompeii, and had been ordered to
return home if the latter did not reappear within an hour. The
mystery could not be solved.</p>

<p>The report of the death speedily reached the ears of Vice, who
informed Sir Joshua Ward. The Commodore, who at once recollected his
mysterious conversation with d'Altavilla about Alicia, suspected that
some dark attempt, some horrible and desperate struggle had taken
place between him and d'Aspremont, with or without the consent of the
latter. As for Vice, she did not hesitate to attribute the death of
the handsome Count to the atrocious jettatore, her hatred of the
latter acting as second sight. Yet Mr. d'Aspremont had paid his visit
to Miss Ward at the usual time, and his countenance did not betray
the least sign of emotion after a terrible drama; indeed, he appeared
calmer than usual.</p>

<p>The fact of the death was concealed from Miss Ward, whose
condition had become critical, though the English physician summoned
by Sir Joshua could not perceive that she was suffering from any
definite malady. Her life seemed to be ebbing away; her soul seemed
to be fluttering its wings in an attempt to escape; she appeared to
be suffocating, like a bird in a vacuum, rather than to be attacked
by a real disease, capable of being treated by ordinary means. She
looked like an angel kept back on earth and dying of home-sickness of
heaven,---her loveliness so suave, so delicate, so diaphanous, so
immaterial, that the coarse atmosphere of earth could no longer
sustain her. One could only imagine her soaring in the golden light
of Paradise, and the little lace pillow that supported her head shone
like an aureole. As she lay on her bed, she resembled Schoorel's
dainty Virgin, the most delicate gem of Gothic art.</p>

<p>Mr. d'Aspremont did not call that day. In order to conceal his
sacrifice, he had resolved not to appear with his eyelids inflamed,
reserving to himself to explain his blindness by some other cause.
But the next morning, the pain having ceased, he entered his
carriage, guided by his groom Paddy.</p>

<p>The carriage drew up as usual at the open-work gate. The
self-blinded man pushed it open, and feeling the ground with his
foot, entered the well-known walk. Vice had not, as her custom was,
hastened up on hearing the bell which was rung by the opening of the
gate. None of the innumerable joyous sounds that form, as it were,
the breathing of an inhabited house, reached Paul's attentive car. A
gloomy, deep, terrifying silence reigned in the dwelling, which might
have been thought abandoned. This silence, sinister even to a seeing
person, became still more dread in the darkness that surrounded the
new-made blind man.</p>

<p>The branches, which he could no longer perceive, seemed to try to
hold him back like the arms of suppliants and to prevent his going
farther. The laurels barred his way; the rose-bushes caught at his
clothing; the creepers clung to his limbs; the garden said to him in
its mute voice: "Unfortunate man, what doest thou here? Do not force
the obstacles that I oppose to thee; return, return!" But Paul did
not listen, and tormented by dreadful presentiments, lurched into the
foliage, pushed back the clumps of verdure, broke the branches, and
kept on towards the house.</p>

<p>Torn and bruised by the angry shrubs, he at last reached the end
of the walk. A gust of free air struck him on the face, and he
continued on his way with outstretched hands. He came up against the
wall, and found the door by groping for it.</p>

<p>He entered. No friendly voice welcomed him. Hearing no sound by
which he might guide himself, he hesitated for a moment upon the
threshold. A smell of ether, the perfume of aromatics, the odour of
burning wax, all the faint scents of a room of death came to the
blind man breathless with terror. A dreadful idea came into his mind,
and he entered the room.</p>

<p>He had scarcely proceeded a few steps when he knocked up against
something that fell with much noise. He bent down, and recognised by
the feel a metal candlestick like those in churches, and fitted with
a tall candle.</p>

<p>Bewildered, he went on his way through the darkness. He thought he
heard a voice repeating prayers in a low tone. He took another step
forward and his hands touched the edge of a couch. He bent over it,
and his trembling fingers first came in contact with a motionless
body lying stiff and stark under a fine tunic; then they felt a
wreath of roses and a face as pure and cold as marble.</p>

<p>It was Alicia lying on her death-bed.</p>

<p>"Dead!" shrieked Paul in a choking voice. "Dead! And I have killed
her!"</p>

<p>The horror-stricken Commodore bad seen the blind phantom stagger
in, grope his way about and stumble against Alicia's death-bed. He
had understood at once, and the grandeur of the sacrifice,
unfortunately useless, brought the tears to the reddened eyes of the
old gentleman who had believed himself incapable of weeping
again.</p>

<p>Paul threw himself on his knees by the bedside and covered
Alicia's ice-cold band with kisses, while convulsive sobs shook his
frame. His grief softened the fierce Vice herself, as she stood
silent and sombre by the wall, watching over her mistress' last
sleep.</p>

<p>When his adieux were over, d'Aspremont rose and walked to the
door, stiffly, like an automaton moved by springs. His sightless
eyes, wide open and staring, had a supernatural expression, and
though they were blinded they seemed still endowed with vision. He
traversed the garden with the heavy tread of a marble statue, went
out into the country and walked on straight ahead, stumbling against
the stones, staggering at times, listening intently as if to catch a
distant sound, but ever advancing.</p>

<p>The sea's great voice sounded more and more distinct. The billows,
lashed by a storm wind, broke on the shore with mighty sobs,
expressing unknown griefs, and under the foam fringe swelled their
despairing breasts; millions of bitter tears streamed upon the rocks,
and the restless gulls uttered plaintive cries.</p>

<p>Presently Paul reached the edge of an overhanging rock. The roar
of the waves, the salt spray torn from the billows by the gusts of
wind and which lashed his face, should have warned him of his danger,
but he heeded it not. A strange smile flitted over his blanched lips
and he kept on his sinister walk, although he felt the void beneath
his lifted foot.</p>

<p>He fell; a huge billow seized him, rolled him over and over for a
moment and then swallowed him up.</p>

<p>Then the storm broke out in its fury; the waves swept up the shore
in serried files, like soldiers storming a fort, and threw the spray
of their crests fifty feet into the air. The black clouds were torn
open as though they were the walls of hell, and through the fissures
showed the burning furnace of the lightnings; sulphurous, blinding
flashes illumined space; the summit of Vesuvius glowed, and its sable
plume of smoke, beaten down by the wind, curled around the volcano's
brow. The vessels at anchor collided with lugubrious sounds, and the
tautened rigging moaned dolorously. Then the rain came down, its
drops like driven bolts, and it seemed as though chaos were striving
to reassert its supremacy over nature and once again to confound the
elements.</p>

<p>All the efforts set on foot by the Commodore failed to bring about
the recovery of Paul d'Aspremont's body.</p>

<p>A silver-mounted, satin-lined, ebony casket, like the one
concerning which Clarissa Harlowe wrote so touchingly to Master
Undertaker, was shipped on board a yacht under the Commodore's
superintendence, and subsequently deposited in the family vault in
the Lincolnshire seat. It contained the mortal remains of Alicia
Ward, lovely even in death.</p>

<p>As for the Commodore, a great change has taken place in him. He is
no longer stout, puts no rum in his tea, eats very little, talks
less, and has lost his crimson and white look--for he has become
pale.</p>
