  <p>In offering this little tract to the public, it is equally the writer&rsquo;s
    wish to conduce to their amusement and information.</p>
  <p>The expedition on which he is engaged has excited much curiosity, and given
    birth to many speculations, respecting the consequences to arise from it.
    While men continue to think freely, they will judge variously. Some have
    been sanguine enough to foresee the most beneficial effects to the Parent
    State, from the Colony we are endeavouring to establish; and some have not
    been wanting to pronounce the scheme big with folly, impolicy, and ruin.
    Which of these predictions will be completed, I leave to the decision of
    the public. I cannot, however, dismiss the subject without expressing a hope,
    that the candid and liberal of each opinion, induced by the humane and benevolent
    intention in which it originated, will unite in waiting the result of a fair
    trial to an experiment, no less new in its design, than difficult in its
    execution.</p>
  <p>As this publication enters the world with the name of the author, candour
    will, he trusts, induce its readers to believe, that no consideration could
    weigh with him in an endeavour to mislead them. Facts are related simply
    as they happened, and when opinions are hazarded, they are such as, he hopes,
    patient inquiry, and deliberate decision, will be found to have authorised.
    For the most part he has spoken from actual observation; and in those places
    where the relations of others have been unavoidably adopted. He has been
    careful to search for the truth, and repress that spirit of exaggeration
    which is almost ever the effect of novelty on ignorance.</p>
  <p>The nautical part of the work is comprized in as few pages as possible.
    By the professional part of my readers this will be deemed judicious; and
    the rest will not, I believe, be dissatisfied at its brevity. I beg leave,
    however, to say of the astronomical calculations, that they may be depended
    on with the greatest degree of security, as they were communicated by an
    officer, who was furnished with instruments, and commissioned by the Board
    of Longitude, to make observations during the voyage, and in the southern
    hemisphere.</p>
  <p>An unpractised writer is generally anxious to bespeak public attention,
    and to solicit public indulgence. Except on professional subjects, military
    men are, perhaps, too fearful of critical censure. For the present narrative
    no other apology is attempted, than the intentions of its author, who has
    endeavoured not only to satisfy present curiosity, but to point out to future
    adventurers, the favourable, as well as adverse circumstances which will
    attend their settling here. The candid, it is hoped, will overlook the inaccuracies
    of this imperfect sketch, drawn amidst the complicated duties of the service
    in which the Author is engaged, and make due allowance for the want of opportunity
    of gaining more extensive information.</p>
  <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watkin Tench, Capt. of the
      Marines.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sydney
  Cove, Port Jackson, New South Wales, 10 July, 1788.</i> </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter1"></a>Chapter 1</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="note">From the Embarkation of the Convicts, to the Departure of
    the Ships from England.</p>
  <p>The marines and convicts having been previously embarked in the River, at
    Portsmouth, and Plymouth, the whole fleet destined for the expedition rendezvoused
    at the Mother Bank, on the 16th of March 1787, and remained there until the
    13th of May following. In this period, excepting a slight appearance of contagion
    in one of the transports, the ships were universally healthy, and the prisoners
    in high spirits. Few complaints or lamentations were to be heard among them,
    and an ardent wish for the hour of departure seemed generally to prevail.</p>
  <p>As the reputation, equally with the safety of the officers and soldiers
    appointed to guard the convicts, consisted in maintaining due subordination,
    an opportunity was taken, immediately on their being embarked, to convince
    them, in the most pointed terms, that any attempt on their side, either to
    contest the command, or to force their escape, should be punished with instant
    death; orders to this effect were given to the centinels in their presence;
    happily, however, for all parties, there occurred not any instance in which
    there was occasion to have recourse to so desperate a measure; the behavior
    of the convicts being in general humble, submissive, and regular: indeed
    I should feel myself wanting in justice to those unfortunate men, were I
    not to bear this public testimony of the sobriety and decency of their conduct.</p>
  <p>Unpleasant as a state of inactivity and delay for many weeks appeared to
    us, it was not without its advantages; for by means of it we were enabled
    to establish necessary regulations among the convicts, and to adopt such
    a system of defence, as left us little to apprehend for our own security,
    in case a spirit of madness and desperation had hurried them on to attempt
    our destruction.</p>
  <p>Among many other troublesome parts of duty which the service we were engaged
    on required, the inspection of all letters brought to, or sent from the ships,
    was not one of the least tiresome and disagreeable. The number and contents
    of those in the vessel I was embarked in, frequently surprised me very much;
    they varied according to the dispositions of the writers: but their constant
    language was, an apprehension of the impracticability of returning home,
    the dread of a sickly passage, and the fearful prospect of a distant and
    barbarous country. But this apparent despondency proceeded in few instances
    from sentiment. With too many it was, doubtless, an artifice to awaken compassion,
    and call forth relief; the correspondence invariably ending in a petition
    for money and tobacco. Perhaps a want of the latter, which is considered
    a great luxury by its admirers among the lower classes of life, might be
    the more severely felt, from their being debarred in all cases whatever,
    sickness excepted, the use of spirituous liquors.</p>
  <p>It may be thought proper for me to mention, that during our stay at the
    Mother Bank, the soldiers and convicts were indiscriminately served with
    fresh beef. The former, in addition, had the usual quantity of beer allowed
    in the navy, and were at what is called full allowance of all species of
    provisions; the latter, at two thirds only.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="note">From the Departure, to the Arrival of the Fleet at Teneriffe.</p>
  <p>Governor Phillip having at length reached Portsmouth, and all things deemed
    necessary for the expedition being put on board, at daylight on the morning
    of the 13th, the signal to weigh anchor was made in the Commanding Officer&rsquo;s
    ship the Sirius. Before six o&rsquo;clock the whole fleet were under sail;
    and, the weather being fine and wind easterly, proceeded through the Needles
    with a fresh leading breeze. In addition to our little armament, the Hyena
    frigate was ordered to accompany us a certain distance to the westward, by
    which means our number was increased to twelve sail: His Majesty&rsquo;s
    ships &lsquo;Sirius&rsquo;, &lsquo;Hyena&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Supply&rsquo;,
    three Victuallers with two years stores and provisions on board for the Settlement,
    and six Transports, with troops and convicts. In the transports were embarked
    four captains, twelve subalterns, twenty-four serjeants and corporals, eight
    drummers, and one hundred and sixty private marines, making the whole of
    the military force, including the Major Commandant and Staff on board the
    Sirius, to consist of two hundred and twelve persons, of whom two hundred
    and ten were volunteers. The number of convicts was five hundred and sixty-five
    men, one hundred and ninety-two women, and eighteen children; the major part
    of the prisoners were mechanics and husbandmen, selected on purpose by order
    of Government.</p>
  <p>By ten o&rsquo;clock we had got clear of the Isle of Wight, at which time,
    having very little pleasure in conversing with my own thoughts, I strolled
    down among the convicts, to observe their sentiments at this juncture. A
    very few excepted, their countenances indicated a high degree of satisfaction,
    though in some, the pang of being severed, perhaps for ever, from their native
    land, could not be wholly suppressed; in general, marks of distress were
    more perceptible among the men than the women; for I recollect to have seen
    but one of those affected on the occasion, &ldquo;Some natural tears she
    dropp&rsquo;d, but wip&rsquo;d them soon.&rdquo; After this the accent of
    sorrow was no longer heard; more genial skies and change of scene banished
    repining and discontent, and introduced in their stead cheerfulness and acquiescence
    in a lot, now not to be altered.</p>
  <p>To add to the good disposition which was beginning to manifest itself, on
    the morning of the 20th, in consequence of some favorable representations
    made by the officers commanding detachments, they were hailed and told from
    the Sirius, that in those cases where they judged it proper, they were at
    liberty to release the convicts from the fetters in which they had been hitherto
    confined. In complying with these directions, I had great pleasure in being
    able to extend this humane order to the whole of those under my charge, without
    a single exception. It is hardly necessary for me to say, that the precaution
    of ironing the convicts at any time reached to the men only.</p>
  <p>In the evening of the same day, the Hyena left us for England, which afforded
    an early opportunity of writing to our friends, and easing their apprehensions
    by a communication of the favourable accounts it was in our power to send
    them.</p>
  <p>From this time to the day of our making the land, little occurred worthy
    of remark. I cannot, however, help noticing the propriety of employing the
    marines on a service which requires activity and exertion at sea, in preference
    to other troops. Had a regiment recruited since the war been sent out, sea-sickness
    would have incapacitated half the men from performing the duties immediately
    and indispensably necessary; whereas the marines, from being accustomed to
    serve on board ship, accommodated themselves with ease to every exigency,
    and surmounted every difficulty.</p>
  <p>At daybreak, on the morning of the 30th of May we saw the rocks named the
    Deserters, which lie off the south-east end of Madeira; and found the south-east
    extremity of the most southerly of them, to be in the latitude of 32 deg
    28 min north, longitude 16 deg 17 1/2 min west of Greenwich. The following
    day we saw the Salvages, a cluster of rocks which are placed between the
    Madeiras and Canary Islands, and determined the latitude of the middle of
    the Great Salvage to be 30 deg 12 min north, and the longitude of its eastern
    side to be 15 deg 39 min west. It is no less extraordinary than unpardonable,
    that in some very modern charts of the Atlantic, published in London, the
    Salvages are totally omitted.</p>
  <p>We made the island of Teneriffe on the 3d of June, and in the evening anchored
    in the road of Santa Cruz, after an excellent passage of three weeks from
    the day we left England.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="note">From the Fleet&rsquo;s Arrival at Teneriffe, to its Departure
    for Rio de Janeiro, in the Brazils.</p>
  <p>There is little to please a traveller at Teneriffe. He has heard wonders
    of its celebrated Peak, but he may remain for weeks together at the town
    of Santa Cruz without having a glimpse of it, and when its cloud-topped head
    emerges, the chance is, that he feels disappointed, for, from the point of
    view in which he sees it, the neighbouring mountains lessen its effect very
    considerably. Excepting the Peak, the eye receives little pleasure from the
    general face of the country, which is sterile and uninviting to the last
    degree. The town, however, from its cheerful white appearance, contrasted
    with the dreary brownness of the back ground, makes not an unpleasing coup
    d&rsquo;oeil. It is neither irregular in its plan, nor despicable in its
    style of building; and the churches and religious houses are numerous, sumptuous,
    and highly ornamented.</p>
  <p>The morning of our arrival, as many officers as could be spared from the
    different ships were introduced to the Marquis de Brancifort, Governor of
    the Canary Islands, whose reception was highly flattering and polite. His
    Excellency is a Sicilian by birth, and is most deservedly popular in his
    government. He prefers residing at Teneriffe, for the conveniency of frequent
    communication with Europe, to the Grand Canary, which is properly the seat
    of power; and though not long fixed here, has already found means to establish
    a manufactory in cotton, silk, and thread, under excellent regulations, which
    employs more than sixty persons, and is of infinite service to the common
    people. During our short stay we had every day some fresh proof of his Excellency&rsquo;s
    esteem and attention, and had the honour of dining with him, in a style of
    equal elegance and splendor. At this entertainment the profusion of ices
    which appeared in the desert was surprising, considering that we were enjoying
    them under a sun nearly vertical. But it seems the caverns of the Peak, very
    far below its summit, afford, at all seasons, ice in abundance.</p>
  <p>The restless importunity of the beggars, and the immodesty of the lowest
    class of women, are highly disgusting. From the number of his countrymen
    to be found, an Englishman is at no loss for society. In the mercantile houses
    established here, it is from gentlemen of this description that any information
    is derived, for the taciturnity of the Spaniards is not to be overcome in
    a short acquaintance, especially by Englishmen, whose reserve falls little
    short of their own. The inland country is described as fertile, and highly
    romantic; and the environs of the small town of Laguza mentioned as particularly
    pleasant. Some of our officers who made an excursion to it confirmed the
    account amply.</p>
  <p>It should seem that the power of the Church, which has been so long on the
    decline in Europe, is at length beginning to be shaken in the colonies of
    the Catholic powers: some recent instances which have taken place at Teneriffe,
    evince it very fully. Were not a stranger, however, to be apprized of this,
    he would hardly draw the conclusion from his own observations. The Bishop
    of these islands, which conjunctively form a See, resides on the Grand Canary.
    He is represented as a man in years, and of a character as amiable as exalted,
    extremely beloved both by foreigners and those of his own church. The bishopric
    is valued at ten thousand pounds per annum; the government at somewhat less
    than two.</p>
  <p>In spite of every precaution, while we lay at anchor in the road, a convict
    had the address, one night, to secrete himself on the deck, when the rest
    were turned below; and after remaining quiet for some hours, let himself
    down over the bow of the ship, and floated to a boat that lay astern, into
    which he got, and cutting her adrift, suffered himself to be carried away
    by the current, until at a sufficient distance to be out of hearing, when
    he rowed off. This elopement was not discovered till some hours after, when
    a search being made, and boats sent to the different parts of the island,
    he was discovered in a small cove, to which he had fled for refuge. On being
    questioned, it appeared he had endeavoured to get himself received on board
    a Dutch East Indiaman in the road; but being rejected there, he resolved
    on crossing over to the Grand Canary, which is at the distance of ten leagues,
    and when detected, was recruiting his strength in order to make the attempt.
    At the same time that the boats of the fleet were sent on this pursuit, information
    was given to the Spanish Governor of what had happened, who immediately detached
    parties every way in order to apprehend the delinquent.</p>
  <p>Having remained a week at Teneriffe, and in that time completed our stock
    of water, and taken on board wine, &amp;c. early on the morning of the 10th
    of June we weighed anchor, and stood out to sea with a light easterly breeze.
    The shortness of our stay, and the consequent hurry, prevented our increasing
    much any previous knowledge we might have had of the place. For the information
    of those who may follow us on this service, it may not, however, be amiss
    to state the little that will be found of use to them.</p>
  <p>The markets afford fresh meat, though it is neither plentiful nor good.
    Fish is scarce; but poultry may be procured in almost any quantity, at as
    cheap a rate as in the English sea-ports. Vegetables do not abound, except
    pumpkins and onions, of which I advise all ships to lay in a large stock.
    Milch goats are bought for a trifle, and easily procured. Grapes cannot be
    scarce in their season; but when we were here, except figs and excellent
    mulberries, no fruit was to be procured. Dry wines, as the merchants term
    them, are sold from ten to fifteen pounds a pipe; for the latter price, the
    very best, called the London Particular, may be bought: sweet wines are considerably
    er. Brandy is also a cheap article. I would not advise the voyager to
    depend on this place for either his hogs or sheep. And he will do well to
    supply himself with dollars before he quits England, to expend in the different
    ports he may happen to touch at. Should he, however, have neglected this
    precaution, let him remember when he discounts bills, or exchanges English
    money here, not to receive his returns in quarter dollars, which will be
    tendered to him, but altogether in whole ones, as he will find the latter
    turn to better account than the former, both at Rio de Janeiro and the Cape
    of Good Hope.</p>
  <p>The latitude of the town of Santa Cruz is 28 deg 27 1/2 min north, the longitude
    16 deg 17 1/2 min west of Greenwich.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="note">The Passage From Teneriffe To Rio De Janeiro, In The Brazils</p>
  <p>In sailing from Teneriffe to the south-east, the various and picturesque
    appearances of the Peak are beautiful to the highest degree. The stupendous
    height, which before was lost on the traveller, now strikes him with awe
    and admiration, the whole island appearing one vast mountain with a pyramidal
    top. As we proceeded with light winds, at an easy rate, we saw it distinctly
    for three days after our departure, and should have continued to see it longer,
    had not the haziness of the atmosphere interrupted our view. The good people
    of Santa Cruz tell some stories of the wonderful extent of space to be seen
    from the summit of it, that would not disgrace the memoirs of the ever-memorable
    Baron Munchausen.</p>
  <p>On the 18th of June we saw the most northerly of the Cape de Verd Islands,
    at which time the Commodore gave the fleet to understand, by signal, that
    his intention was to touch at some of them. The following day we made St.
    Jago, and stood in to gain an anchorage in Port Praya Bay. But the baffling
    winds and lee current rendering it a matter of doubt whether or not the ships
    would be able to fetch, the signal for anchoring was hauled down, and the
    fleet bore up before the wind. In passing along them we were enabled to ascertain
    the south end of the Isle of Sal to be in 16 deg 40 min north latitude, and
    23 deg 5 min west longitude. The south end of Bonavista to be in 15 deg 57
    min north, 23 deg 8 min west. The south end of the Isle of May in 15 deg
    11 min north, 23 deg 26 min west; and the longitude of the fort, in the town
    of Port Praya, to be 23 deg 36 1/2 min west of Greenwich.</p>
  <p>By this time the weather, from the sun being so far advanced in the northern
    tropic, was become intolerably hot, which, joined to the heavy rains that
    soon after came on, made us very apprehensive for the health of the fleet.
    Contrary, however, to expectation, the number of sick in the ship I was embarked
    on was surprisingly small, and the rest of the fleet were nearly as healthy.
    Frequent explosions of gunpowder, lighting fires between decks, and a liberal
    use of that admirable antiseptic, oil of tar, were the preventives we made
    use of against impure air; and above all things we were careful to keep the
    men&rsquo;s bedding and wearing apparel dry. As we advanced towards the Line,
    the weather grew gradually better and more pleasant. On the 14th of July
    we passed the Equator, at which time the atmosphere was as serene, and the
    temperature of the air not hotter than in a bright summer day in England.
    From this period, until our arrival on the American coast, the heats, the
    calms, and the rains by which we had been so much incommoded, were succeeded
    by a series of weather as delightful as it was unlooked for. At three o&rsquo;clock
    in the afternoon of the 2nd of August, the &lsquo;Supply&rsquo;, which had
    been previously sent a-head on purpose, made the signal for seeing the land,
    which was visible to the whole fleet before sunset, and proved to be Cape
    Frio, in latitude 23 deg 5 min south, longitude 41 deg 40 1/4 min west.</p>
  <p>Owing to light airs we did not get a-breast of the city of St. Sebastian,
    in the harbour of Rio de Janeiro, until the 7th of the month, when we anchored
    about three quarters of a mile from the shore.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="note">From the Arrival of the Fleet at Rio de Janeiro, till its
    Departure for the Cape of Good Hope; with some Remarks on the Brazils.</p>
  <p>Brazil is a country very imperfectly known in Europe. The Portugueze, from
    political motives, have been sparing in their accounts of it. Whence our
    descriptions of it, in the geographical publications in England, are drawn,
    I know not: that they are miserably erroneous and defective, is certain.</p>
  <p>The city of St. Sebastian stands on the west side of the harbour, in a low
    unhealthy situation, surrounded on all sides by hills, which stop the free
    circulation of air, and subject its inhabitants to intermittents and putrid
    diseases. It is of considerable extent: Mr. Cook makes it as large as Liverpool;
    but Liverpool, in 1767, when Mr. Cook wrote, was not two-thirds of its present
    size. Perhaps it equals Chester, or Exeter, in the share of ground it occupies,
    and is infinitely more populous than either of them. The streets intersect
    each other at right angles, are tolerably well built, and excellently paved,
    abounding with shops of every kind, in which the wants of a stranger, if
    money is not one of them, can hardly remain unsatisfied. About the centre
    of the city, and at a little distance from the beach, the Palace of the Viceroy
    stands, a long, low building, no wise remarkable in its exterior appearance;
    though within are some spacious and handsome apartments. The churches and
    convents are numerous, and richly decorated; hardly a night passes without
    some of the latter being illuminated in honour of their patron saints, which
    has a very brilliant effect when viewed from the water, and was at first
    mistaken by us for public rejoicings. At the corner of almost every street
    stands a little image of the Virgin, stuck round with lights in an evening,
    before which passengers frequently stop to pray and sing very loudly. Indeed,
    the height to which religious zeal is carried in this place, cannot fail
    of creating astonishment in a stranger. The greatest part of the inhabitants
    seem to have no other occupation, than that of paying visits and going to
    church, at which times you see them sally forth richly dressed, en chapeau
    bras, with the appendages of a bag for the hair, and a small sword: even
    boys of six years old are seen parading about, furnished with these indispensable
    requisites. Except when at their devotions, it is not easy to get a sight
    of the women, and when obtained, the comparisons drawn by a traveller, lately
    arrived from England, are little flattering to Portugueze beauty. In justice,
    however, to the ladies of St. Sebastian, I must observe, that the custom
    of throwing nosegays at strangers, for the purpose of bringing on an assignation,
    which Doctor Solander, and another gentleman of Mr. Cook&rsquo;s ship, met
    with when here, was never seen by any of us in a single instance. We were
    so deplorably unfortunate as to walk every evening before their windows and
    balconies, without being honoured with a single bouquet, though nymphs and
    flowers were in equal and great abundance.</p>
  <p>Among other public buildings, I had almost forgot to mention an observatory,
    which stands near the middle of the town, and is tolerably well furnished
    with astronomical instruments. During our stay here, some Spanish and Portuguese
    mathematicians were endeavouring to determine the boundaries of the territories
    belonging to their respective crowns. Unhappily, however, for the cause of
    science, these gentleman have not hitherto been able to coincide in their
    accounts, so that very little information on this head, to be depended upon,
    could be gained. How far political motives may have caused this disagreement,
    I do not presume to decide; though it deserves notice, that the Portuguese
    accuse the Abbee de la Caille, who observed here by order of the King of
    France, of having laid down the longitude of this place forty-five miles
    too much to the eastward.</p>
  <p>Until the year 1770, all the flour in the settlement was brought from Europe;
    but since that time the inhabitants have made so rapid a progress in raising
    grain, as to be able to supply themselves with it abundantly. The principal
    corn country lies around Rio Grande, in the latitude of 32 deg south, where
    wheat flourishes so luxuriantly, as to yield from seventy to eighty bushels
    for one. Coffee also, which they formerly received from Portugal, now grows
    in such plenty as to enable them to export considerable quantities of it.
    But the staple commodity of the country is sugar. That they have not, however,
    learnt the art of making palatable rum, the English troops in New South Wales
    can bear testimony; a large quantity, very ill flavoured, having been bought
    and shipped here for the use of the garrison of Port Jackson.</p>
  <p>It was in 1771 that St. Salvador, which had for more than a century been
    the capital of Brazil, ceased to be so; and that the seat of Government was
    removed to St. Sebastian. The change took place on account of the colonial
    war, at that time carried on by the Courts of Lisbon and Madrid. And, indeed,
    were the object of security alone to determine the seat of Government, I
    know but few places better situated in that respect than the one I am describing;
    the natural strength of the country, joined to the difficulties which would
    attend an attack on the fortifications, being such as to render it very formidable.</p>
  <p>It may be presumed that the Portuguese Government is well apprized of this
    circumstance and of the little risque they run in being deprived of so important
    a possession, else it will not be easy to penetrate the reasons which induce
    them to treat the troops who compose the garrison with such cruel negligence.
    Their regiments were ordered out with a promise of being relieved, and sent
    back to Europe at the end of three years, in conformity to which they settled
    all their domestic arrangements. But the faith of Government has been broken,
    and at the expiration of twenty years, all that is left to the remnant of
    these unfortunate men, is to suffer in submissive silence. I was one evening
    walking with a Portuguese officer, when this subject was started, and on
    my telling him, that such a breach of public honour to English troops would
    become a subject of parliamentary enquiry, he seized my hand with great eagerness, &ldquo;Ah,
    Sir!&rdquo; exclaimed he, &ldquo;yours is a free country&mdash;we&rdquo;!&mdash;His
    emotions spoke what his tongue refused.</p>
  <p>As I am mentioning the army, I cannot help observing, that I saw nothing
    here to confirm the remark of Mr. Cook, that the inhabitants of the place,
    whenever they meet an officer of the garrison, bow to him with the greatest
    obsequiousness; and by omitting such a ceremony, would subject themselves
    to be knocked down, though the other seldom deigns to return the compliment.
    The interchange of civilities is general between them, and seems by no means
    extorted. The people who could submit to such insolent superiority, would,
    indeed, deserve to be treated as slaves.</p>
  <p>The police of the city is very good. Soldiers patrole the streets frequently,
    and riots are seldom heard of. The dreadful custom of stabbing, from motives
    of private resentment, is nearly at an end, since the church has ceased to
    afford an asylum to murderers. In other respects, the progress of improvement
    appears slow, and fettered by obstacles almost insurmountable, whose baneful
    influence will continue, until a more enlightened system of policy shall
    be adopted. From morning to night the ears of a stranger are greeted by the
    tinkling of the convent bells, and his eyes saluted by processions of devotees,
    whose adoration and levity seem to keep equal pace, and succeed each other
    in turns. &ldquo;Do you want to make your son sick of soldiering? Shew him
    the Trainbands of London on a field-day.&rdquo; Let him who would wish to
    give his son a distaste to Popery, point out to him the sloth, the ignorance,
    and the bigotry of this place.</p>
  <p>Being nearly ready to depart by the 1st of September, as many officers as
    possible went on that day to the palace to take leave of his Excellency,
    the Viceroy of the Brazils, to whom we had been previously introduced; who
    on this, and every other occasion, was pleased to honour us with the most
    distinguished marks of regard and attention. Some part, indeed, of the numerous
    indulgencies we experienced during our stay here, must doubtless be attributed
    to the high respect in which the Portuguese held Governor Phillip, who was
    for many years a captain in their navy, and commanded a ship of war on this
    station: in consequence of which, many privileges were extended to us, very
    unusual to be granted to strangers. We were allowed the liberty of making
    short excursions into the country, and on these occasions, as well as when
    walking in the city, the mortifying custom of having an officer of the garrison
    attending us was dispensed with on our leaving our names and ranks, at the
    time of landing, with the adjutant of orders at the palace. It happened,
    however, sometimes, that the presence of a military man was necessary to
    prevent imposition in the shopkeepers, who frequently made a practice of
    asking more for their goods than the worth of them. In which case an officer,
    when applied to, always told us the usual price of the commodity with the
    greatest readiness, and adjusted the terms of the purchase.</p>
  <p>On the morning of the fourth of September we left Rio de Janeiro, amply
    furnished with the good things which its happy soil and clime so abundantly
    produce. The future voyager may with security depend on this place for laying
    in many parts of his stock. Among these may be enumerated sugar, coffee,
    rum, port wine, rice, tapioca, and tobacco, besides very beautiful wood for
    the purposes of household furniture. Poultry is not remarkably cheap, but
    may be procured in any quantity; as may hops at a low rate. The markets are
    well supplied with butcher&rsquo;s meat, and vegetables of every sort are
    to be procured at a price next to nothing; the yams are particularly excellent.
    Oranges abound so much, as to be sold for sixpence a hundred; and limes are
    to be had on terms equally moderate. Bananas, cocoa nuts, and guavas, are
    common; but the few pineapples brought to market are not remarkable either
    for flavour, or cheapness. Besides the inducements to lay out money already
    mentioned, the naturalist may add to his collection by an almost endless
    variety of beautiful birds and curious insects, which are to be bought at
    a reasonable price, well preserved, and neatly assorted.</p>
  <p>I shall close my account of this place by informing strangers, who may come
    here, that the Portuguese reckon their money in rees, an imaginary coin,
    twenty of which make a small copper piece called a &lsquo;vintin&rsquo;,
    and sixteen of these last a &lsquo;petack&rsquo;. Every piece is marked with
    the number of rees it is worth, so that a mistake can hardly happen. English
    silver coin has lost its reputation here, and dollars will be found preferable
    to any other money.</p>

  <p align="center" class="note">The Passage from the Brazils to the Cape of Good Hope; with
    an Account of the Transactions of the Fleet there.</p>
  <p>Our passage from Rio de Janeiro to the Cape of Good Hope was equally prosperous
    with that which had preceded it. We steered away to the south-east, and lost
    sight of the American coast the day after our departure. From this time until
    the 13th of October, when we made the Cape, nothing remarkable occurred,
    except the loss of a convict in the ship I was on board, who unfortunately
    fell into the sea, and perished in spite of our efforts to save him, by cutting
    adrift a life buoy and hoisting out a boat. During the passage, a slight
    dysentery prevailed in some of the ships, but was in no instance mortal.
    We were at first inclined to impute it to the water we took on board at the
    Brazils, but as the effect was very partial, some other cause was more probably
    the occasion of it.</p>
  <p>At seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening of the 13th of October, we cast anchor
    in Table Bay, and found many ships of different nations in the harbour.</p>
  <p>Little can be added to the many accounts already published of the Cape of
    Good Hope, though, if an opinion on the subject might be risqued, the descriptions
    they contain are too flattering. When contrasted with Rio de Janeiro, it
    certainly suffers in the comparison. Indeed we arrived at a time equally
    unfavourable for judging of the produce of the soil and the temper of its
    cultivators, who had suffered considerably from a th that had happened
    the preceding season, and created a general scarcity. Nor was the chagrin
    of these deprivations lessened by the news daily arriving of the convulsions
    that shook the republic, which could not fail to make an impression even
    on Batavian phlegm.</p>
  <p>As a considerable quantity of flour, and the principal part of the live
    stock, which was to store our intended settlement, were meant to be procured
    here, Governor Phillip lost no time in waiting on Mynheer Van Graaffe, the
    Dutch Governor, to request permission (according to the custom of the place)
    to purchase all that we stood in need of. How far the demand extended, I
    know not, nor Mynheer Van Graaffe&rsquo;s reasons for complying with it in
    part only. To this gentleman&rsquo;s political sentiments I confess myself
    a stranger; though I should do his politeness and liberality at his own table
    an injustice, were I not to take this public opportunity of acknowledging
    them; nor can I resist the opportunity which presents itself, to inform my
    readers, in honor of M. Van Graaffe&rsquo;s humanity, that he has made repeated
    efforts to recover the unfortunate remains of the crew of the Grosvenor Indiaman,
    which was wrecked about five years ago on the coast of Caffraria. This information
    was given me by Colonel Gordon, commandant of the Dutch troops at the Cape,
    whose knowledge of the interior parts of this country surpasses that of any
    other man. And I am sorry to say that the Colonel added, these unhappy people
    were irrecoverably lost to the world and their friends, by being detained
    among the Caffres, the most savage set of brutes on earth.</p>
  <p>His Excellency resides at the Government house, in the East India Company&rsquo;s
    garden. This last is of considerable extent, and is planted chiefly with
    vegetables for the Dutch Indiamen which may happen to touch at the port.
    Some of the walks are extremely pleasant from the shade they afford, and
    the whole garden is very neatly kept. The regular lines intersecting each
    other at right angles, in which it is laid out, will, nevertheless, afford
    but little gratification to an Englishman, who has been used to contemplate
    the natural style which distinguishes the pleasure grounds of his own country.
    At the head of the centre walks stands a menagerie, on which, as well as
    the garden, many pompous eulogiums have been passed, though in my own judgment,
    considering the local advantages possessed by the Company, it is poorly furnished
    both with animals and birds; a tyger, a zebra, some fine ostriches, a cassowary,
    and the lovely crown-fowl, are among the most remarkable.</p>
  <p>The table land, which stands at the back of the town, is a black dreary
    looking mountain, apparently flat at top, and of more than eleven hundred
    yards in height. The gusts of wind which blow from it are violent to an excess,
    and have a very unpleasant effect, by raising the dust in such clouds, as
    to render stirring out of doors next to impossible. Nor can any precaution
    prevent the inhabitants from being annoyed by it, as much within doors as
    without.</p>
  <p>At length the wished-for day, on which the next effort for reaching the
    place of our destination was to be made, appeared. The morning was calm,
    but the land wind getting up about noon, on the 12th of November we weighed
    anchor, and soon left far behind every scene of civilization and humanized
    manners, to explore a remote and barbarous land; and plant in it those happy
    arts, which alone constitute the pre-eminence and dignity of other countries.</p>
  <p>The live animals we took on board on the public account from the Cape, for
    stocking our projected colony, were, two bulls, three cows, three horses,
    forty-four sheep, and thirty-two hogs, besides goats, and a very large quantity
    of poultry of every kind. A considerable addition to this was made by the
    private stocks of the officers, who were, however, under a necessity of circumscribing
    their original intentions on this head very much, from the excessive ness
    of many of the articles. It will readily be believed, that few of the military
    found it convenient to purchase sheep, when hay to feed them costs sixteen
    shillings a hundred weight.</p>
  <p>The boarding-houses on shore, to which strangers have recourse, are more
    reasonable than might be expected. For a dollar and a half per day we were
    well lodged, and partook of a table tolerably supplied in the French style.
    Should a traveller&rsquo;s stock of tea run short, it is a thousand chances
    to one that he will be able to replenish it here at a cheaper rate than in
    England. He may procure plenty of arrack and white wine; also raisins, and
    dried fruits of other sorts. If he dislikes to live at a boarding-house,
    he will find the markets well stored, and the price of butcher&rsquo;s meat
    and vegetables far from excessive.</p>
  <p>Just before the signal for weighing was made, a ship, under American colours,
    entered the road, bound from Boston, from whence she had sailed one hundred
    and forty days, on a trading voyage to the East Indies. In her route, she
    had been lucky enough to pick up several of the inferior officers and crew
    of the Harcourt East-Indiaman, which ship had been wrecked on one of the
    Cape de Verd Islands. The master, who appeared to be a man of some information,
    on being told the destination of our fleet, gave it as his opinion, that
    if a reception could be secured, emigrations would take place to New South
    Wales, not only from the old continent, but the new one, where the spirit
    of adventure and thirst for novelty were excessive.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="note">The Passage from the Cape of Good Hope to Botany Bay</p>
  <p>We had hardly cleared the land when a south-east wind set in, and, except
    at short intervals, continued to blow until the 19th of the month; when we
    were in the latitude of 37 deg 40 min south, and by the time-keeper, in longitude
    11 deg 30 min east, so that our distance from Botany Bay had increased nearly
    an hundred leagues since leaving the Cape. As no appearance of a change in
    our favour seemed likely to take place, Governor Phillip at this time signified
    his intention of shifting his pennant from the Sirius to the &lsquo;Supply&rsquo;,
    and proceeding on his voyage without waiting for the rest of the fleet, which
    was formed in two divisions. The first consisting of three transports, known
    to be the best sailors, was put under the command of a Lieutenant of the
    navy; and the remaining three, with the victuallers, left in charge of Captain
    Hunter, of his Majesty&rsquo;s ship Sirius. In the last division was the
    vessel, in which the author of this narrative served. Various causes prevented
    the separation from taking place until the 25th, when several sawyers, carpenters,
    blacksmiths, and other mechanics, were shifted from different ships into
    the &lsquo;Supply&rsquo;, in order to facilitate his Excellency&rsquo;s intention
    of forwarding the necessary buildings to be erected at Botany Bay, by the
    time the rest of the fleet might be expected to arrive. Lieutenant Governor
    Ross, and the Staff of the marine battalion, also removed from the Sirius
    into the Scarborough transport, one of the ships of the first division, in
    order to afford every assistance which the public service might receive,
    by their being early on the spot on which our future operations were to be
    conducted.</p>
  <p>From this time a succession of fair winds and pleasant weather corresponded
    to our eager desires, and on the 7th of January, 1788, the long wished for
    shore of Van Diemen gratified our sight. We made the land at two o&rsquo;clock
    in the afternoon, the very hour we expected to see it from the lunar observations
    of Captain Hunter, whose accuracy, as an astronomer, and conduct as an officer,
    had inspired us with equal gratitude and admiration.</p>
  <p>After so long a confinement, on a service so peculiarly disgusting and troublesome,
    it cannot be matter of surprise that we were overjoyed at the near prospect
    of a change of scene. By sunset we had passed between the rocks, which Captain
    Furneaux named the Mewstone and Swilly. The former bears a very close resemblance
    to the little island near Plymouth, whence it took its name: its latitude
    is 43 deg 48 min south, longitude 146 deg 25 min east of Greenwich.</p>
  <p>In running along shore, we cast many an anxious eye towards the land, on
    which so much of our future destiny depended. Our distance, joined to the
    haziness of the atmosphere, prevented us, however, from being able to discover
    much. With our best glasses we could see nothing but hills of a moderate
    height, cloathed with trees, to which some little patches of white sandstone
    gave the appearance of being covered with snow. Many fires were observed
    on the hills in the evening.</p>
  <p>As no person in the ship I was on board had been on this coast before, we
    consulted a little chart, published by Steele, of the Minories, London, and
    found it, in general, very correct; it would be more so, were not the Mewstone
    laid down at too great a distance from the land, and one object made of the
    Eddystone and Swilly, when, in fact, they are distinct. Between the two last
    is an entire bed of impassable rocks, many of them above water. The latitude
    of the Eddystone is 43 deg 53 1/2 min, longitude 147 deg 9 min; that of Swilly
    43 deg 54 min south, longitude 147 deg 3 min east of Greenwich.</p>
  <p>In the night the westerly wind, which had so long befriended us, died away,
    and was succeeded by one from the north-east. When day appeared we had lost
    sight of the land, and did not regain it until the 19th, at only the distance
    of 17 leagues from our desired port. The wind was now fair, the sky serene,
    though a little hazy, and the temperature of the air delightfully pleasant:
    joy sparkled in every countenance, and congratulations issued from every
    mouth. Ithaca itself was scarcely more longed for by Ulysses, than Botany
    Bay by the adventurers who had traversed so many thousand miles to take possession
    of it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heavily in clouds came on the day&rdquo; which ushered in our arrival.
    To us it was &ldquo;a great, an important day,&rdquo; though I hope the foundation,
    not the fall, of an empire will be dated from it.</p>
  <p>On the morning of the 20th, by ten o&rsquo;clock, the whole of the fleet
    had cast anchor in Botany Bay, where, to our mutual satisfaction, we found
    the Governor, and the first division of transports. On inquiry, we heard,
    that the &lsquo;Supply&rsquo; had arrived on the 18th, and the transports
    only the preceding day.</p>
  <p>Thus, after a passage of exactly thirty-six weeks from Portsmouth, we happily
    effected our arduous undertaking, with such a train of unexampled blessings
    as hardly ever attended a fleet in a like predicament. Of two hundred and
    twelve marines we lost only one; and of seven hundred and seventy-five convicts,
    put on board in England, but twenty-four perished in our route. To what cause
    are we to attribute this unhoped for success? I wish I could answer to the
    liberal manner in which Government supplied the expedition. But when the
    reader is told, that some of the necessary articles allowed to ships on a
    common passage to West Indies, were withheld from us; that portable soup,
    wheat, and pickled vegetables were not allowed; and that an inadequate quantity
    of essence of malt was the only antiscorbutic supplied, his surprise will
    redouble at the result of the voyage. For it must be remembered, that the
    people thus sent out were not a ship&rsquo;s company starting with every
    advantage of health and good living, which a state of freedom produces; but
    the major part a miserable set of convicts, emaciated from confinement, and
    in want of cloaths, and almost every convenience to render so long a passage
    tolerable. I beg leave, however, to say, that the provisions served on board
    were good, and of a much superior quality to those usually supplied by contract:
    they were furnished by Mr. Richards, junior, of Walworth, Surrey.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter 8</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="note">From the Fleet&rsquo;s Arrival at Botany Bay to the Evacuation
    of it; and taking Possession of Port Jackson. Interviews with the Natives;
    and an Account of the Country about Botany Bay</p>
  <p>We had scarcely bid each other welcome on our arrival, when an expedition
    up the Bay was undertaken by the Governor and Lieutenant-Governor, in order
    to explore the nature of the country, and fix on a spot to begin our operations
    upon. None, however, which could be deemed very eligible, being discovered,
    his Excellency proceeded in a boat to examine the opening, to which Mr. Cook
    had given the name of Port Jackson, on an idea that a shelter for shipping
    within it might be found. The boat returned on the evening of the 23rd, with
    such an account of the harbour and advantages attending the place, that it
    was determined the evacuation of Botany Bay should commence the next morning.</p>
  <p>In consequence of this decision, the few seamen and marines who had been
    landed from the squadron, were instantly reimbarked, and every preparation
    made to bid adieu to a port which had so long been the subject of our conversation;
    which but three days before we had entered with so many sentiments of satisfaction;
    and in which, as we had believed, so many of our future hours were to be
    passed. The thoughts of removal banished sleep, so that I rose at the first
    dawn of the morning. But judge of my surprize on hearing from a serjeant,
    who ran down almost breathless to the cabin where I was dressing, that a
    ship was seen off the harbour&rsquo;s mouth. At first I only laughed, but
    knowing the man who spoke to me to be of great veracity, and hearing him
    repeat his information, I flew upon deck, on which I had barely set my foot,
    when the cry of &ldquo;another sail&rdquo; struck on my astonished ear.</p>
  <p>Confounded by a thousand ideas which arose in my mind in an instant, I sprang
    upon the barricado and plainly descried two ships of considerable size, standing
    in for the mouth of the Bay. By this time the alarm had become general, and
    every one appeared lost in conjecture. Now they were Dutchmen sent to dispossess
    us, and the moment after storeships from England, with supplies for the settlement.
    The improbabilities which attended both these conclusions, were sunk in the
    agitation of the moment. It was by Governor Phillip, that this mystery was
    at length unravelled, and the cause of the alarm pronounced to be two French
    ships, which, it was now recollected, were on a voyage of discovery in the
    southern hemisphere. Thus were our doubts cleared up, and our apprehensions
    banished; it was, however, judged expedient to postpone our removal to Port
    Jackson, until a complete confirmation of our conjectures could be procured.</p>
  <p>Had the sea breeze set in, the strange ships would have been at anchor in
    the Bay by eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning, but the wind blowing out,
    they were driven by a strong lee current to the southward of the port. On
    the following day they re-appeared in their former situation, and a boat
    was sent to them, with a lieutenant of the navy in her, to offer assistance,
    and point out the necessary marks for entering the harbour. In the course
    of the day the officer returned, and brought intelligence that the ships
    were the Boussole and Astrolabe, sent out by order of the King of France,
    and under the command of Monsieur De Perrouse. The astonishment of the French
    at seeing us, had not equalled that we had experienced, for it appeared,
    that in the course of their voyage they had touched at Kamschatka, and by
    that means learnt that our expedition was in contemplation. They dropped
    anchor the next morning, just as we had got under weigh to work out of the
    Bay, so that for the present nothing more than salutations could pass between
    us.</p>
  <p>Before I quit Botany Bay, I shall relate the observations we were enabled
    to make during our short stay there; as well as those which our subsequent
    visits to it from Port Jackson enabled us to complete.</p>
  <p>The Bay is very open, and greatly exposed to the fury of the S.E. winds,
    which, when they blow, cause a heavy and dangerous swell. It is of prodigious
    extent, the principal arm, which takes a S.W. direction, being not less,
    including its windings, than twenty four miles from the capes which form
    the entrance, according to the report of the French officers, who took uncommon
    pains to survey it. At the distance of a league from the harbour&rsquo;s
    mouth is a bar, on which at low water, not more than fifteen feet are to
    be found. Within this bar, for many miles up the S.W. arm, is a haven, equal
    in every respect to any hitherto known, and in which any number of ships
    might anchor, secured from all winds. The country around far exceeds in richness
    of soil that about Cape Banks and Point Solander, though unfortunately they
    resemble each other in one respect, a scarcity of fresh water.</p>
  <p>We found the natives tolerably numerous as we advanced up the river, and
    even at the harbour&rsquo;s mouth we had reason to conclude the country more
    populous than Mr. Cook thought it. For on the Supply&rsquo;s arrival in the
    Bay on the 18th of the month, they were assembled on the beach of the south
    shore, to the number of not less than forty persons, shouting and making
    many uncouth signs and gestures. This appearance whetted curiosity to its
    utmost, but as prudence forbade a few people to venture wantonly among so
    great a number, and a party of only six men was observed on the north shore,
    the Governor immediately proceeded to land on that side, in order to take
    possession of his new territory, and bring about an intercourse between its
    old and new masters. The boat in which his Excellency was, rowed up the harbour,
    close to the land, for some distance; the Indians keeping pace with her on
    the beach. At last an officer in the boat made signs of a want of water,
    which it was judged would indicate his wish of landing. The natives directly
    comprehended what he wanted, and pointed to a spot where water could be procured;
    on which the boat was immediately pushed in, and a landing took place. As
    on the event of this meeting might depend so much of our future tranquillity,
    every delicacy on our side was requisite. The Indians, though timorous, shewed
    no signs of resentment at the Governor&rsquo;s going on shore; an interview
    commenced, in which the conduct of both parties pleased each other so much,
    that the strangers returned to their ships with a much better opinion of
    the natives than they had landed with; and the latter seemed highly entertained
    with their new acquaintance, from whom they condescended to accept of a looking
    glass, some beads, and other toys.</p>
  <p>Owing to the lateness of our arrival, it was not my good fortune to go on
    shore until three days after this had happened, when I went with a party
    to the south side of the harbour, and had scarcely landed five minutes, when
    we were met by a dozen Indians, naked as at the moment of their birth, walking
    along the beach. Eager to come to a conference, and yet afraid of giving
    offence, we advanced with caution towards them, nor would they, at first
    approach nearer to us than the distance of some paces. Both parties were
    armed; yet an attack seemed as unlikely on their part, as we knew it to be
    on our own.</p>
  <p>I had at this time a little boy, of not more than seven years of age, in
    my hand. The child seemed to attract their attention very much, for they
    frequently pointed to him and spoke to each other; and as he was not frightened,
    I advanced with him towards them, at the same time baring his bosom and,
    shewing the whiteness of the skin. On the cloaths being removed, they gave
    a loud exclamation, and one of the party, an old man, with a long beard,
    hideously ugly, came close to us. I bade my little charge not to be afraid,
    and introduced him to the acquaintance of this uncouth personage. The Indian,
    with great gentleness, laid his hand on the child&rsquo;s hat, and afterwards
    felt his cloaths, muttering to himself all the while. I found it necessary,
    however, by this time to send away the child, as such a close connection
    rather alarmed him; and in this, as the conclusion verified, I gave no offence
    to the old gentleman. Indeed it was but putting ourselves on a par with them,
    as I had observed from the first, that some youths of their own, though considerably
    older than the one with us, were, kept back by the grown people.</p>
  <p>Several more now came up, to whom, we made various presents, but our toys
    seemed not to be regarded as very valuable; nor would they for a long time
    make any returns to them, though before we parted, a large club, with a head
    almost sufficient to fell an ox, was obtained in exchange for a looking-glass.
    These people seemed at a loss to know (probably from our want of beards)
    of what sex we were, which having understood, they burst into the most immoderate
    fits of laughter, talking to each other at the same time with such rapidity
    and vociferation as I had never before heard. After nearly an hour&rsquo;s
    conversation by signs and gestures, they repeated several times the word
    whurra, which signifies, begone, and walked away from us to the head of the
    Bay.</p>
  <p>The natives being departed, we set out to observe the country, which, on
    inspection, rather disappointed our hopes, being invariably sandy and unpromising
    for the purposes of cultivation, though the trees and grass flourish in great
    luxuriancy. Close to us was the spring at which Mr. Cook watered, but we
    did not think the water very excellent, nor did it run freely. In the evening
    we returned on board, not greatly pleased with the latter part of our discoveries,
    as it indicated an increase of those difficulties, which before seemed sufficiently
    numerous.</p>
  <p>Between this and our departure we had several more interviews with the natives,
    which ended in so friendly a manner, that we began to entertain strong hopes
    of bringing about a connection with them. Our first object was to win their
    affections, and our next to convince them of the superiority we possessed:
    for without the latter, the former we knew would be of little importance.</p>
  <p>An officer one day prevailed on one of them to place a target, made of bark,
    against a tree, which he fired at with a pistol, at the distance of some
    paces. The Indians, though terrified at the report, did not run away, but
    their astonishment exceeded their alarm, on looking at the shield which the
    ball had perforated. As this produced a little shyness, the officer, to dissipate
    their fears and remove their jealousy, whistled the air of Malbrooke, which
    they appeared highly charmed with, and imitated him with equal pleasure and
    readiness. I cannot help remarking here, what I was afterwards told by Monsieur
    De Perrouse, that the natives of California, and throughout all the islands
    of the Pacific Ocean, and in short wherever he had been, seemed equally touched
    and delighted with this little plaintive air.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="note">The taking Possession of Port Jackson, with the Disembarkation
    of the Marines and Convicts</p>
  <p>Our passage to Port Jackson took up but few hours, and those were spent
    far from unpleasantly. The evening was bright, and the prospect before us
    such as might justify sanguine expectation. Having passed between the capes
    which form its entrance, we found ourselves in a port superior, in extent
    and excellency, to all we had seen before. We continued to run up the harbour
    about four miles, in a westerly direction, enjoying the luxuriant prospect
    of its shores, covered with trees to the water&rsquo;s edge, among which
    many of the Indians were frequently seen, till we arrived at a small snug
    cove on the southern side, on whose banks the plan of our operations was
    destined to commence.</p>
  <p>The landing of a part of the marines and convicts took place the next day,
    and on the following, the remainder was disembarked. Business now sat on
    every brow, and the scene, to an indifferent spectator, at leisure to contemplate
    it, would have been highly picturesque and amusing. In one place, a party
    cutting down the woods; a second, setting up a blacksmith&rsquo;s forge;
    a third, dragging along a load of stones or provisions; here an officer pitching
    his marquee, with a detachment of troops parading on one side of him, and
    a cook&rsquo;s fire blazing up on the other. Through the unwearied diligence
    of those at the head of the different departments, regularity was, however,
    soon introduced, and, as far as the unsettled state of matters would allow,
    confusion gave place to system.</p>
  <p>Into the head of the cove, on which our establishment is fixed, runs a small
    stream of fresh water, which serves to divide the adjacent country to a little
    distance, in the direction of north and south. On the eastern side of this
    rivulet the Governor fixed his place of residence, with a large body of convicts
    encamped near him; and on the western side was disposed the remaining part
    of these people, near the marine encampment. From this last two guards, consisting
    of two subalterns, as many serjeants, four corporals, two drummers, and forty-two
    private men, under the orders of a Captain of the day, to whom all reports
    were made, daily mounted for the public security, with such directions to
    use force, in case of necessity, as left no room for those who were the object
    of the order, but to remain peaceable, or perish by the bayonet.</p>
  <p>As the straggling of the convicts was not only a desertion from the public
    labour, but might be attended with ill consequences to the settlement, in
    case of their meeting the natives, every care was taken to prevent it. The
    Provost Martial with his men was ordered to patrole the country around, and
    the convicts informed, that the severest punishment would be inflicted on
    transgressors. In spite, however, of all our precautions, they soon found
    the road to Botany Bay, in visits to the French, who would gladly have dispensed
    with their company.</p>
  <p>But as severity alone was known to be inadequate at once to chastize and
    reform, no opportunity was omitted to assure the convicts, that by their
    good behaviour and submissive deportment, every claim to present distinction
    and future favour was to be earned. That this caution was not attended with
    all the good effects which were hoped from it, I have only to lament; that
    it operated in some cases is indisputable; nor will a candid and humane mind
    fail to consider and allow for the situation these unfortunate beings so
    peculiarly stood in. While they were on board ship, the two sexes had been
    kept most rigorously apart; but, when landed, their separation became impracticable,
    and would have been, perhaps, wrong. Licentiousness was the unavoidable consequence,
    and their old habits of depravity were beginning to recur. What was to be
    attempted? To prevent their intercourse was impossible; and to palliate its
    evils only remained. Marriage was recommended, and such advantages held out
    to those who aimed at reformation, as have greatly contributed to the tranquillity
    of the settlement.</p>
  <p>On the Sunday after our landing divine service was performed under a great
    tree, by the Rev. Mr. Johnson, Chaplain of the Settlement, in the presence
    of the troops and convicts, whose behaviour on the occasion was equally regular
    and attentive. In the course of our passage this had been repeated every
    Sunday, while the ships were in port; and in addition to it, Mr. Johnson
    had furnished them with books, at once tending to promote instruction and
    piety.</p>
  <p>The Indians for a little while after our arrival paid us frequent visits,
    but in a few days they were observed to be more shy of our company. From
    what cause their distaste arose we never could trace, as we had made it our
    study, on these occasions, to treat them with kindness, and load them with
    presents. No quarrel had happened, and we had flattered ourselves, from Governor
    Phillip&rsquo;s first reception among them, that such a connection might
    be established as would tend to the interest of both parties. It seems, that
    on that occasion, they not only received our people with great cordiality,
    but so far acknowledged their authority as to submit, that a boundary, during
    their first interview, might be drawn on the sand, which they attempted not
    to infringe, and appeared to be satisfied with.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter 10</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="note">The reading of the Commissions, and taking Possession of
    the Settlement, in form. With an Account of the Courts of Law, and Mode of
    administering Public Justice in this Country</p>
  <p>Owing to the multiplicity of pressing business necessary to be performed
    immediately after landing, it was found impossible to read the public commissions
    and take possession of the colony in form, until the 7th of February. On
    that day all the officers of guard took post in the marine battalion, which
    was drawn up, and marched off the parade with music playing, and colours
    flying, to an adjoining ground, which had been cleared for the occasion,
    whereon the convicts were assembled to hear His Majesty&rsquo;s commission
    read, appointing his Excellency Arthur Phillip, Esq. Governor and Captain
    General in and over the territory of New South Wales, and its dependencies;
    together with the Act of Parliament for establishing trials by law within
    the same; and the patents under the Great Seal of Great Britain, for holding
    the civil and criminal courts of judicature, by which all cases of life and
    death, as well as matters of property, were to be decided. When the Judge
    Advocate had finished reading, his Excellency addressed himself to the convicts
    in a pointed and judicious speech, informing them of his future intentions,
    which were, invariably to cherish and render happy those who shewed a disposition
    to amendment; and to let the rigour of the law take its course against such
    as might dare to transgress the bounds prescribed. At the close three vollies
    were fired in honour of the occasion, and the battalion marched back to their
    parade, where they were reviewed by the Governor, who was received with all
    the honours due to his rank. His Excellency was afterwards pleased to thank
    them, in public orders, for their behaviour from the time of their embarkation;
    and to ask the officers to partake of a cold collation at which it is scarce
    necessary to observe, that many loyal and public toasts were drank in commemoration
    of the day.</p>
  <p>In the Governor&rsquo;s commission, the extent of this authority is defined
    to reach from the latitude of 43 deg 49 min south, to the latitude of 10
    deg 37 min south, being the northern and southern extremities of the continent
    of New Holland. It commences again at 135th degree of longitude east of Greenwich,
    and, proceeding in an easterly direction, includes all islands within the
    limits of the above specified latitudes in the Pacific Ocean. By this partition
    it may be fairly presumed, that every source of future litigation between
    the Dutch and us will be for ever cut off, as the discoveries of English
    navigators alone are comprized in this territory.</p>
  <p>Nor have Government been more backward in arming Mr. Phillip with plenitude
    of power, than extent of dominion. No mention is made of a Council to be
    appointed, so that he is left to act entirely from his own judgment. And
    as no stated time of assembling the Courts of justice is pointed out, similar
    to the assizes and gaol deliveries of England, the duration of imprisonment
    is altogether in his hands. The power of summoning General Courts Martial
    to meet he is also invested with, but the insertion in the marine mutiny
    act, of a smaller number of officers than thirteen being able to compose
    such a tribunal, has been neglected: so that a Military court, should detachments
    be made from headquarters, or sickness prevail, may not always be found practicable
    to be obtained, unless the number of officers, at present in the Settlement,
    shall be increased.</p>
  <p>Should the Governor see cause, he is enabled to grant pardons to offenders
    convicted, &ldquo;in all cases whatever, treason and wilful murder excepted,&rdquo; and
    even in these, has authority to stay the execution of the law, until the
    King&rsquo;s pleasure shall be signified. In case of the Governor&rsquo;s
    death, the Lieutenant Governor takes his place; and on his demise, the senior
    officer on the spot is authorised to assume the reins of power.</p>
  <p>Notwithstanding the promises made on one side, and the forbearance shewn
    on the other, joined to the impending rod of justice, it was with infinite
    regret that every one saw, in four days afterwards, the necessity of assembling
    a Criminal Court, which was accordingly convened by warrant from the Governor,
    and consisted of the judge Advocate, who presided, three naval, and three
    marine officers.</p>
  <p>As the constitution of this court is altogether new in the British annals,
    I hope my reader will not think me prolix in the description I am about to
    give of it. The number of members, including the judge Advocate, is limited,
    by Act of Parliament, to seven, who are expressly ordered to be officers,
    either of His Majesty&rsquo;s sea or land forces. The court being met, completely
    arrayed and armed as at a military tribunal, the Judge Advocate proceeds
    to administer the usual oaths taken by jurymen in England to each member;
    one of whom afterwards swears him in a like manner. This ceremony being adjusted,
    the crime laid to the prisoner&rsquo;s charge is read to him, and the question
    of Guilty, or Not guilty, put. No law officer on the side of the crown being
    appointed, (for I presume the head of the court ought hardly to consider
    himself in that light, notwithstanding the title he bears) to prosecute the
    criminal is left entirely to the party, at whose suit he is tried. All the
    witnesses are examined on oath, and the decision is directed to be given
    according to the laws of England, &ldquo;or as nearly as may be, allowing
    for the circumstances and situation of the settlement,&rdquo; by a majority
    of votes, beginning with the youngest member, and ending with the president
    of the court. In cases, however, of a capital nature, no verdict can be given,
    unless five, at least, of the seven members present concur therein. The evidence
    on both sides being finished, and the prisoner&rsquo;s defence heard, the
    court is cleared, and, on the judgement being settled, is thrown open again,
    and sentence pronounced. During the time the court sits, the place in which
    it is assembled is directed to be surrounded by a guard under arms, and admission
    to every one who may choose to enter it, granted. Of late, however, our colonists
    are supposed to be in such a train of subordination, as to make the presence
    of so large a military force unnecessary; and two centinels, in addition
    to the Provost Martial, are considered as sufficient.</p>
  <p>It would be as needless, as impertinent, to anticipate the reflections which
    will arise in reading the above account, wherein a regard to accuracy only
    has been consulted. By comparing it with the mode of administering justice
    in the English courts of law, it will be found to differ in many points very
    essentially. And if we turn our eyes to the usage of military tribunals,
    it no less departs from the customs observed in them. Let not the novelty
    of it, however, prejudice any one so far as to dispute its efficacy, and
    the necessity of the case which gave it birth.</p>
  <p>The court, whose meeting is already spoken of, proceeded to the trial of
    three convicts, one of whom was convicted of having struck a marine with
    a cooper&rsquo;s adze, and otherwise behaving in a very riotous and scandalous
    manner, for which he was sentenced to receive one hundred and fifty lashes,
    being a smaller punishment than a soldier in a like case would have suffered
    from the judgement of a court martial. A second, for having committed a petty
    theft, was sent to a small barren island, and kept there on bread and water
    only, for a week. And the third was sentenced to receive fifty lashes, but
    was recommended by the court to the Governor, and forgiven.</p>
  <p>Hitherto, however, (February) nothing of a very atrocious nature had appeared.
    But the day was at hand, on which the violation of public security could
    no longer be restrained, by the infliction of temporary punishment. A set
    of desperate and hardened villains leagued themselves for the purposes of
    depredation, and, as it generally happens, had art enough to persuade some
    others, less deeply versed in iniquity, to be the instruments for carrying
    it on. Fortunately the progress of these miscreants was not of long duration.
    They were detected in stealing a large quantity of provisions at the time
    of issuing them. And on being apprehended, one of the tools of the superiors
    impeached the rest, and disclosed the scheme. The trial came on the 28th
    of the month, and of four who were arraigned for the offence, three were
    condemned to die, and the fourth to receive a very severe corporal punishment.
    In hopes that his lenity would not be abused, his Excellency was, however,
    pleased to order one only for execution, which took place a little before
    sun-set the same day. The name of the unhappy wretch was Thomas Barret, an
    old and desperate offender, who died with that hardy spirit, which too often
    is found in the worst and most abandoned class of men. During the execution
    the battalion of marines was under arms, and the whole of the convicts obliged
    to be present. The two associates of the sufferer were ordered to be kept
    close prisoners, until an eligible place to banish them to could be fixed
    on; as were also two more, who on the following day were condemned to die
    for a similar offence.</p>
  <p>Besides the Criminal court, there is an inferior one composed of the Judge
    Advocate, and one or more justices of the peace, for the trial of small misdemeanours.
    This court is likewise empowered to decide all law suits, and its verdict
    is final, except where the sum in dispute amounts to more than three hundred
    pounds, in which case an appeal to England can be made from its decree. Should
    necessity warrant it, an Admiralty court, of which Lieutenant Governor Ross
    is judge, can also be summoned, for the trial of offences committed on the
    high seas.</p>
  <p>From being unwilling to break the thread of my narrative, I omitted to note
    in its proper place the sailing of the &lsquo;Supply&rsquo;, Lieut. Ball,
    on the 15th of the month, for Norfolk Island, which the Governor had instructions
    from the ministry to take possession of. Lieut. King of the Sirius was sent
    as superintendent and commandant of this place, and carried with him a surgeon,
    a midshipman, a sawyer, a weaver, two marines, and sixteen convicts, of whom
    six were women. He was also supplied with a certain number of live animals
    to stock the island, besides garden seeds, grain, and other requisites.</p>

  <p align="center" class="note">A Description of the Natives of New South Wales, and our
    Transactions with them</p>
  <p>I doubt not my readers will be as glad as I feel myself, to conclude the
    dull detail of the last chapter. If they please, they may turn from the subtle
    intricacies of the law, to contemplate the simple, undisguised workings of
    nature, in her most artless colouring.</p>
  <p>I have already said, we had been but very few days at Port Jackson, when
    an alteration in the behaviour of the natives was perceptible; and I wish
    I could add, that a longer residence in their neighbourhood had introduced
    a greater degree of cordiality and intermixture between the old, and new,
    lords of the soil, than at the day on which this publication is dated subsists.</p>
  <p>From their easy reception of us in the beginning, many were induced to call
    in question the accounts which Mr. Cook had given of this people. That celebrated
    navigator, we were willing to believe, had somehow by his conduct offended
    them, which prevented the intercourse that would otherwise have taken place.
    The result, however, of our repeated endeavours to induce them to come among
    us has been such as to confirm me in an opinion, that they either fear or
    despise us too much, to be anxious for a closer connection. And I beg leave
    at once, to apprize the reader, that all I can here, or in any future part
    of this work, relate with fidelity of the natives of New South Wales, must
    be made up of detached observations, taken at different times, and not from
    a regular series of knowledge of the customs and manners of a people, with
    whom opportunities of communication are so scarce, as to have been seldom
    obtained.</p>
  <p>In their persons, they are far from being a stout race of men, though nimble,
    sprightly, and vigorous. The deficiency of one of the fore teeth of the upper
    jaw, mentioned by Dampier, we have seen in almost the whole of the men; but
    their organs of sight so far from being defective, as that author mentions
    those of the inhabitants of the western side of the continent to be, are
    remarkably quick and piercing. Their colour, Mr. Cook is inclined to think
    rather a deep chocolate, than an absolute black, though he confesses, they
    have the appearance of the latter, which he attributes to the greasy filth
    their skins are loaded with. Of their want of cleanliness we have had sufficient
    proofs, but I am of opinion, all the washing in the world would not render
    them two degrees less black than an African negro. At some of our first interviews,
    we had several droll instances of their mistaking the Africans we brought
    with us for their own countrymen.</p>
  <p>Notwithstanding the disregard they have invariably shewn for all the finery
    we could deck them with, they are fond of adorning themselves with scars,
    which increase their natural hideousness. It is hardly possible to see any
    thing in human shape more ugly, than one of these savages thus scarified,
    and farther ornamented with a fish bone struck through the gristle of the
    nose. The custom of daubing themselves with white earth is also frequent
    among both sexes: but, unlike the inhabitants of the Islands in the Pacific
    Ocean, they reject the beautiful feathers which the birds of their country
    afford.</p>
  <p>Exclusive of their weapons of offence, and a few stone hatchets very rudely
    fashioned, their ingenuity is confined to manufacturing small nets, in which
    they put the fish they catch, and to fish-hooks made of bone, neither of
    which are unskilfully executed. On many of the rocks are also to be found
    delineations of the figures of men and birds, very poorly cut.</p>
  <p>Of the use or benefit of cloathing, these people appear to have no comprehension,
    though their sufferings from the climate they live in, strongly point out
    the necessity of a covering from the rigour of the seasons. Both sexes, and
    those of all ages, are invariably found naked. But it must not be inferred
    from this, that custom so inures them to the changes of the elements, as
    to make them bear with indifference the extremes of heat and cold; for we
    have had visible and repeated proofs, that the latter affects them severely,
    when they are seen shivering, and huddling themselves up in heaps in their
    huts, or the caverns of the rocks, until a fire can be kindled.</p>
  <p>Than these huts nothing more rude in construction, or deficient in conveniency,
    can be imagined. They consist only of pieces of bark laid together in the
    form of an oven, open at one end, and very low, though long enough for a
    man to lie at full length. There is reason, however, to believe, that they
    depend less on them for shelter, than on the caverns with which the rocks
    abound.</p>
  <p>To cultivation of the ground they are utter strangers, and wholly depend
    for food on the few fruits they gather; the roots they dig up in the swamps;
    and the fish they pick up along shore, or contrive to strike from their canoes
    with spears. Fishing, indeed, seems to engross nearly the whole of their
    time, probably from its forming the chief part of a subsistence, which, observation
    has convinced us, nothing short of the most painful labour, and unwearied
    assiduity, can procure. When fish are scarce, which frequently happens, they
    often watch the moment of our hauling the seine, and have more than once
    been known to plunder its contents, in spite of the opposition of those on
    the spot to guard it: and this even after having received a part of what
    had been caught. The only resource at these times is to shew a musquet, and
    if the bare sight is not sufficient, to fire it over their heads, which has
    seldom failed of dispersing them hitherto, but how long the terror which
    it excites may continue is doubtful.</p>
  <p>The canoes in which they fish are as despicable as their huts, being nothing
    more than a large piece of bark tied up at both ends with vines. Their dexterous
    management of them, added to the swiftness with which they paddle, and the
    boldness that leads them several miles in the open sea, are, nevertheless,
    highly deserving of admiration. A canoe is seldom seen without a fire in
    it, to dress the fish by, as soon as caught: fire they procure by attrition.</p>
  <p>From their manner of disposing of those who die, which will be mentioned
    hereafter, as well as from every other observation, there seems no reason
    to suppose these people cannibals; nor do they ever eat animal substances
    in a raw state, unless pressed by extreme hunger, but indiscriminately broil
    them, and their vegetables, on a fire, which renders these last an innocent
    food, though in their raw state many of them are of a poisonous quality:
    as a poor convict who unguardedly eat of them experienced, by falling a sacrifice
    in twenty-four hours afterwards. If bread be given to the Indians, they chew
    and spit it out again, seldom choosing to swallow it. Salt beef and pork
    they like rather better, but spirits they never could be brought to taste
    a second time.</p>
  <p>The only domestic animal they have is the dog, which in their language is
    called Dingo, and a good deal resembles the fox dog of England. These animals
    are equally shy of us, and attached to the natives. One of them is now in
    the possession of the Governor, and tolerably well reconciled to his new
    master. As the Indians see the dislike of the dogs to us, they are sometimes
    mischievous enough to set them on single persons whom they chance to meet
    in the woods. A surly fellow was one day out shooting, when the natives attempted
    to divert themselves in this manner at his expense. The man bore the teazing
    and gnawing of the dog at his heels for some time, but apprehending at length,
    that his patience might embolden them to use still farther liberties, he
    turned round and shot poor Dingo dead on the spot: the owners of him set
    off with the utmost expedition.</p>
  <p>There is no part of the behaviour of these people, that has puzzled us more,
    than that which relates to their women. Comparatively speaking we have seen
    but few of them, and those have been sometimes kept back with every symptom
    of jealous sensibility; and sometimes offered with every appearance of courteous
    familiarity. Cautious, however, of alarming the feelings of the men on so
    tender a point, we have constantly made a rule of treating the females with
    that distance and reserve, which we judged most likely to remove any impression
    they might have received of our intending aught, which could give offence
    on so delicate a subject. And so successful have our endeavours been, that
    a quarrel on this head has in no instance, that I know of, happened. The
    tone of voice of the women, which is pleasingly soft and feminine, forms
    a striking contrast to the rough guttural pronunciation of the men. Of the
    other charms of the ladies I shall be silent, though justice obliges me to
    mention, that, in the opinion of some amongst us, they shew a degree of timidity
    and bashfulness, which are, perhaps, inseparable from the female character
    in its rudest state. It is not a little singular, that the custom of cutting
    off the two lower joints of the little finger of the left hand, observed
    in the Society Islands, is found here among the women, who have for the most
    part undergone this amputation. Hitherto we have not been able to trace out
    the cause of this usage. At first we supposed it to be peculiar to the married
    women, or those who had borne children; but this conclusion must have been
    erroneous, as we have no right to believe that celibacy prevails in any instance,
    and some of the oldest of the women are without this distinction; and girls
    of a very tender age are marked by it.</p>
  <p>On first setting foot in the country, we were inclined to hold the spears
    of the natives very cheap. Fatal experience has, however, convinced us, that
    the wound inflicted by this weapon is not a trivial one; and that the skill
    of the Indians in throwing it, is far from despicable. Besides more than
    a dozen convicts who have unaccountably disappeared, we know that two, who
    were employed as rush cutters up the harbour, were (from what cause we are
    yet ignorant) most dreadfully mangled and butchered by the natives. A spear
    had passed entirely through the thickest part of the body of one of them,
    though a very robust man, and the skull of the other was beaten in. Their
    tools were taken away, but some provisions which they had with them at the
    time of the murder, and their cloaths, were left untouched. In addition to
    this misfortune, two more convicts, who were peaceably engaged in picking
    of greens, on a spot very remote from that where their comrades suffered,
    were unawares attacked by a party of Indians, and before they could effect
    their escape, one of them was pierced by a spear in the hip, after which
    they knocked him down, and plundered his cloaths. The poor wretch, though
    dreadfully wounded, made shift to crawl off, but his companion was carried
    away by these barbarians, and his fate doubtful, until a soldier, a few days
    afterwards, picked up his jacket and hat in a native&rsquo;s hut, the latter
    pierced through by a spear. We have found that these spears are not made
    invariably alike, some of them being barbed like a fish gig, and others simply
    pointed. In repairing them they are no less dexterous than in throwing them.
    A broken one being given by a gentleman to an Indian, he instantly snatched
    up an oyster-shell, and converted it with his teeth into a tool with which
    he presently fashioned the spear, and rendered it fit for use: in performing
    this operation, the sole of his foot served him as a work-board. Nor are
    their weapons of offence confined to the spear only, for they have besides
    long wooden swords, shaped like a sabre, capable of inflicting a mortal wound,
    and clubs of an immense size. Small targets, made of the bark of trees, are
    likewise now and then to be seen among them.</p>
  <p>From circumstances which have been observed, we have sometimes been inclined
    to believe these people at war with each other. They have more than once
    been seen assembled, as if bent on an expedition. An officer one day met
    fourteen of them marching along in a regular Indian file through the woods,
    each man armed with a spear in his right hand, and a large stone in his left:
    at their head appeared a chief, who was distinguished by being painted. Though
    in the proportion of five to one of our people they passed peaceably on.</p>
  <p>That their skill in throwing the spear sometimes enables them to kill the
    kangaroo we have no right to doubt, as a long splinter of this weapon was
    taken out of the thigh of one of these animals, over which the flesh had
    completely closed; but we have never discovered that they have any method
    of ensnaring them, or that they know any other beasts but the kangaroo and
    dog. Whatever animal is shewn them, a dog excepted, they call kangaroo: a
    strong presumption that the wild animals of the country are very few.</p>
  <p>Soon after our arrival at Port Jackson, I was walking out near a place where
    I observed a party of Indians, busily employed in looking at some sheep in
    an inclosure, and repeatedly crying out, &lsquo;kangaroo, kangaroo!&rsquo; As
    this seemed to afford them pleasure, I was willing to increase it by pointing
    out the horses and cows, which were at no great distance. But unluckily,
    at the moment, some female convicts, employed near the place, made their
    appearance, and all my endeavours to divert their attention from the ladies
    became fruitless. They attempted not, however, to offer them the least degree
    of violence or injury, but stood at the distance of several paces, expressing
    very significantly the manner they were attracted.</p>
  <p>It would be trespassing on the reader&rsquo;s indulgence were I to impose
    on him an account of any civil regulations, or ordinances, which may possibly
    exist among this people. I declare to him, that I know not of any, and that
    excepting a little tributary respect which the younger part appear to pay
    those more advanced in years, I never could observe any degrees of subordination
    among them. To their religious rites and opinions I am equally a stranger.
    Had an opportunity offered of seeing the ceremonies observed at disposing
    of the dead, perhaps, some insight might have been gained; but all that we
    at present know with certainty is, that they burn the corpse, and afterwards
    heap up the earth around it, somewhat in the manner of the small tumuli,
    found in many counties of England.</p>
  <p>I have already hinted, that the country is more populous than it was generally
    believed to be in Europe at the time of our sailing. But this remark is not
    meant to be extended to the interior parts of the continent, which there
    is every reason to conclude from our researches, as well as from the manner
    of living practised by the natives, to be uninhabited. It appears as if some
    of the Indian families confine their society and connections within their
    own pale: but that this cannot always be the case we know; for on the north-west
    arm of Botany Bay stands a village, which contains more than a dozen houses,
    and perhaps five times that number of people; being the most considerable
    establishment that we are acquainted with in the country. As a striking proof,
    besides, of the numerousness of the natives, I beg leave to state, that Governor
    Phillip, when on an excursion between the head of this harbour and that of
    Botany Bay, once fell in with a party which consisted of more than three
    hundred persons, two hundred and twelve of whom were men: this happened only
    on the day following the murder of the two convict rush cutters, before noticed,
    and his Excellency was at the very time in search of the murderers, on whom,
    could they have been found, he intended to inflict a memorable and exemplary
    punishment. The meeting was unexpected to both parties, and considering the
    critical situation of affairs, perhaps not very pleasing to our side, which
    consisted but of twelve persons, until the peaceable disposition of the Indians
    was manifest. After the strictest search the Governor was obliged to return
    without having gained any information. The laudable perseverance of his Excellency
    to throw every light on this unhappy and mysterious business did not, however
    stop here, for he instituted the most rigorous inquiry to find out, if possible,
    whether the convicts had at any time ill treated or killed any of the natives;
    and farther, issued a proclamation, offering the most tempting of all rewards,
    a state of freedom, to him who should point out the murderer, in case such
    an one existed.</p>
  <p>I have thus impartially stated the situation of matters, as they stand,
    while I write, between the natives and us; that greater progress in attaching
    them to us has not been made, I have only to regret; but that all ranks of
    men have tried to effect it, by every reasonable effort from which success
    might have been expected, I can testify; nor can I omit saying, that in the
    higher stations this has been eminently conspicuous. The public orders of
    Governor Phillip have invariably tended to promote such a behaviour on our
    side, as was most likely to produce this much wished-for event. To what cause
    then are we to attribute the distance which the accomplishment of it appears
    at? I answer, to the fickle, jealous, wavering disposition of the people
    we have to deal with, who, like all other savages, are either too indolent,
    too indifferent, or too fearful to form an attachment on easy terms, with
    those who differ in habits and manners so widely from themselves. Before
    I close the subject, I cannot, however, omit to relate the following ludicrous
    adventure, which possibly may be of greater use in effecting what we have
    so much at heart, than all our endeavours.</p>
  <p>Some young gentlemen belonging to the Sirius one day met a native, an old
    man, in the woods; he had a beard of considerable length, which his new acquaintance
    gave him to understand, by signals, they would rid him of, if he pleased;
    stroaking their chins, and shewing him the smoothness of them at the same
    time; at length the old Indian consented, and one of the youngsters taking
    a penknife from his pocket, and making use of the best substitute for lather
    he could find, performed the operation with great success, and, as it proved,
    much to the liking of the old man, who in a few days after reposed a confidence
    in us, of which we had hitherto known no example, by paddling along-side
    the Sirius in his canoe, and pointing to his beard. Various arts were ineffectually
    tried to induce him to enter the ship; but as he continued to decline the
    invitation, a barber was sent down into the boat along-side the canoe, from
    whence, leaning over the gunnel, he complied with the wish of the old beau,
    to his infinite satisfaction. In addition to the consequences which our sanguine
    hopes led us to expect from this dawning of cordiality, it affords proof,
    that the beard is considered by this people more as an incumbrance than a
    mark of dignity.</p>

  <p align="center" class="note">The Departure of the French from Botany Bay; and the Return
    of the &lsquo;Supply&rsquo; from Norfolk Island; with a Discovery made by
    Lieutenant Ball on his Passage to it</p>
  <p>About the middle of the month our good friends the French departed from
    Botany Bay, in prosecution of their voyage. During their stay in that port,
    the officers of the two nations had frequent opportunities of testifying
    their mutual regard by visits, and every interchange of friendship and esteem.
    These ships sailed from France, by order of the King, on the 1st of August,
    1785, under the command of Monsieur De Perrouse, an officer whose eminent
    qualifications, we had reason to think, entitle him to fill the highest stations.
    In England, particularly, he ought long to be remembered with admiration
    and gratitude, for the humanity which marked his conduct, when ordered to
    destroy our settlement at Hudson&rsquo;s Bay, in the last war. His second
    in command was the Chevalier Clonard, an officer also of distinguished merit.</p>
  <p>In the course of the voyage these ships had been so unfortunate as to lose
    a boat, with many men and officers in her, off the west of California; and
    afterwards met with an accident still more to be regretted, at an island
    in the Pacific Ocean, discovered by Monsieur Bougainville, in the latitude
    of 14 deg 19 min south, longitude 173 deg 3 min 20 sec east of Paris. Here
    they had the misfortune to have no less than thirteen of their crews, among
    whom was the officer at that time second in command, cut off by the natives,
    and many more desperately wounded. To what cause this cruel event was to
    be attributed, they knew not, as they were about to quit the island after
    having lived with the Indians in the greatest harmony for several weeks;
    and exchanged, during the time, their European commodities for the produce
    of the place, which they describe as filled with a race of people remarkable
    for beauty and comeliness; and abounding in refreshments of all kinds.</p>
  <p>It was no less gratifying to an English ear, than honourable to Monsieur
    De Perrouse, to witness the feeling manner in which he always mentioned the
    name and talents of Captain Cook. That illustrious circumnavigator had, he
    said, left nothing to those who might follow in his track to describe, or
    fill up. As I found, in the course of conversation, that the French ships
    had touched at the Sandwich Islands, I asked M. De Perrouse what reception
    he had met with there. His answer deserves to be known: &ldquo;During the
    whole of our voyage in the South Seas, the people of the Sandwich Islands
    were the only Indians who never gave us cause of complaint. They furnished
    us liberally with provisions, and administered cheerfully to all our wants.&rdquo; It
    may not be improper to remark, that Owhyee was not one of the islands visited
    by this gentleman.</p>
  <p>In the short stay made by these ships at Botany Bay, an Abbe, one of the
    naturalists on board, died, and was buried on the north shore. The French
    had hardly departed, when the natives pulled down a small board, which had
    been placed over the spot where the corpse was interred, and defaced everything
    around. On being informed of it, the Governor sent a party over with orders
    to affix a plate of copper on a tree near the place, with the following inscription
    on it, which is a copy of what was written on the board:</p>
  <p>Hic jacet L. RECEVEUR, E.F.F. minnibus Galliae, Sacerdos, Physicus, in circumnavigatione
    mundi, Duce De La Perrouse. Obiit die 17 Februarii, anno 1788.</p>
  <p>This mark of respectful attention was more particularly due, from M. De
    Perrouse having, when at Kamschatka, paid a similar tribute of gratitude
    to the memory of Captain Clarke, whose tomb was found in nearly as ruinous
    a state as that of the Abbe.</p>
  <p>Like ourselves, the French found it necessary, more than once, to chastise
    a spirit of rapine and intrusion which prevailed among the Indians around
    the Bay. The menace of pointing a musquet to them was frequently used; and
    in one or two instances it was fired off, though without being attended with
    fatal consequences. Indeed the French commandant, both from a regard to the
    orders of his Court as well as to our quiet and security, shewed a moderation
    and forbearance on this head highly becoming.</p>
  <p>On the 20th of March, the &lsquo;Supply&rsquo; arrived from Norfolk Island,
    after having safely landed Lieutenant King and his little garrison. The pine-trees
    growing there are described to be of a growth and height superior, perhaps,
    to any in the world. But the difficulty of bringing them away will not be
    easily surmounted, from the badness and danger of the landing place. After
    the most exact search not a single plant of the New Zealand flax could be
    found, though we had been taught to believe it abounded there.</p>
  <p>Lieutenant Ball, in returning to Port Jackson, touched at a small island
    in latitude 31 deg 36 min south, longitude 159 deg 4 min east of Greenwich,
    which he had been fortunate enough to discover on his passage to Norfolk,
    and to which he gave the name of Lord Howe&rsquo;s Island. It is entirely
    without inhabitants, or any traces of any having ever been there. But it
    happily abounds in what will be infinitely more important to the settlers
    on New South Wales: green turtle of the finest kind frequent it in the summer
    season. Of this Mr. Ball gave us some very handsome and acceptable specimens
    on his return. Besides turtle, the island is well stocked with birds, many
    of them so tame as to be knocked down by the seamen with sticks. At the distance
    of four leagues from Lord Howe Island, and in latitude 31 deg 30 min south,
    longitude 159 deg 8 min east, stands a remarkable rock, of considerable height,
    to which Mr. Ball gave the name of Ball&rsquo;s Pyramid, from the shape it
    bears.</p>
  <p>While the &lsquo;Supply&rsquo; was absent, Governor Phillip made an excursion
    to Broken Bay, a few leagues to the northward of Port Jackson, in order to
    explore it. As a harbour it almost equals the latter, but the adjacent country
    was found so rocky and bare, as to preclude all possibility of turning it
    to account. Some rivulets of fresh water fall into the head of the Bay, forming
    a very picturesque scene. The Indians who live on its banks are numerous,
    and behaved attentively in a variety of instances while our people remained
    among them.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter13"></a>Chapter 13</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="note">Transactions at Port Jackson in the Months of April and May.</p>
  <p>As winter was fast approaching, it became necessary to secure ourselves
    in quarters, which might shield us from the cold we were taught to expect
    in this hemisphere, though in so low a latitude. The erection of barracks
    for the soldiers was projected, and the private men of each company undertook
    to build for themselves two wooden houses, of sixty-eight feet in length,
    and twenty-three in breadth. To forward the design, several saw-pits were
    immediately set to work, and four ship carpenters attached to the battalion,
    for the purpose of directing and completing this necessary undertaking. In
    prosecuting it, however, so many difficulties occurred, that we were fain
    to circumscribe our original intention; and, instead of eight houses, content
    ourselves with four. And even these, from the badness of the timber, the
    scarcity of artificers, and other impediments, are, at the day on which I
    write, so little advanced, that it will be well, if at the close of the year
    1788, we shall be established in them. In the meanwhile the married people,
    by proceeding on a more contracted scale, were soon under comfortable shelter.
    Nor were the convicts forgotten; and as leisure was frequently afforded them
    for the purpose, little edifices quickly multiplied on the ground allotted
    them to build upon.</p>
  <p>But as these habitations were intended by Governor Phillip to answer only
    the exigency of the moment, the plan of the town was drawn, and the ground
    on which it is hereafter to stand surveyed, and marked out. To proceed on
    a narrow, confined scale, in a country of the extensive limits we possess,
    would be unpardonable: extent of empire demands grandeur of design. That
    this has been our view will be readily believed, when I tell the reader,
    that the principal street in our projected city will be, when completed,
    agreeable to the plan laid down, two hundred feet in breadth, and all the
    rest of a corresponding proportion. How far this will be accompanied with
    adequate dispatch, is another question, as the incredulous among us are sometimes
    hardy enough to declare, that ten times our strength would not be able to
    finish it in as many years.</p>
  <p>Invariably intent on exploring a country, from which curiosity promises
    so many gratifications, his Excellency about this time undertook an expedition
    into the interior parts of the continent. His party consisted of eleven persons,
    who, after being conveyed by water to the head of the harbour, proceeded
    in a westerly direction, to reach a chain of mountains, which in clear weather
    are discernible, though at an immense distance, from some heights near our
    encampment. With unwearied industry they continued to penetrate the country
    for four days; but at the end of that time, finding the base of the mountain
    to be yet at the distance of more than twenty miles, and provisions growing
    scarce, it was judged prudent to return, without having accomplished the
    end for which the expedition had been undertaken. To reward their toils,
    our adventurers had, however, the pleasure of discovering and traversing
    an extensive tract of ground, which they had reason to believe, from the
    observations they were enabled to make, capable of producing every thing,
    which a happy soil and genial climate can bring forth. In addition to this
    flattering appearance, the face of the country is such, as to promise success
    whenever it shall be cultivated, the trees being at a considerable distance
    from each other, and the intermediate space filled, not with underwood, but
    a thick rich grass, growing in the utmost luxuriancy. I must not, however,
    conceal, that in this long march, our gentlemen found not a single rivulet,
    but were under a necessity of supplying themselves with water from standing
    pools, which they met with in the vallies, supposed to be formed by the rains
    that fall at particular seasons of the year. Nor had they the good fortune
    to see any quadrupeds worth notice, except a few kangaroos. To their great
    surprize, they observed indisputable tracks of the natives having been lately
    there, though in their whole route none of them were to be seen; nor any
    means to be traced, by which they could procure subsistence so far from the
    sea shore.</p>
  <p>On the 6th of May the &lsquo;Supply&rsquo; sailed for Lord Howe Island,
    to take on board turtle for the settlement; but after waiting there several
    days was obliged to return without having seen one, owing we apprehended
    to the advanced season of the year. Three of the transports also, which were
    engaged by the East India Company to proceed to China, to take on board a
    lading of tea, sailed about this time for Canton.</p>
  <p>The unsuccessful return of the &lsquo;Supply&rsquo;  cast a general damp
    on our spirits, for by this time fresh provisions were become scarcer than
    in a blockaded town. The little live stock, which with so heavy an expense,
    and through so many difficulties, we had brought on shore, prudence forbade
    us to use; and fish, which on our arrival, and for a short time after had
    been tolerable plenty, were become so scarce, as to be rarely seen at the
    tables of the first among us. Had it not been for a stray kangaroo, which
    fortune now and then threw in our way, we should have been utter strangers
    to the taste of fresh food.</p>
  <p>Thus situated, the scurvy began its usual ravages, and extended its baneful
    influence, more or less, through all descriptions of persons. Unfortunately
    the esculent vegetable productions of the country are neither plentiful,
    nor tend very effectually to remove this disease. And, the ground we had
    turned up and planted with garden seeds, either from the nature of the soil,
    or, which is more probable, the lateness of the season, yielded but a scanty
    and insufficient supply of what we stood so greatly in need of.</p>
  <p>During the period I am describing, few enormous offences were perpetrated
    by the convicts. A petty theft was now and then heard of, and a spirit of
    refractory sullenness broke out at times in some individuals: one execution
    only, however, took place. The sufferer, who was a very young man, was convicted
    of a burglary, and met his fate with a hardiness and insensibility, which
    the grossest ignorance, and most deplorable want of feeling, alone could
    supply.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter14"></a>Chapter 14</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="note">From the Beginning of June, to the Departure of the Ships
    for Europe</p>
  <p>Hours of festivity, which under happier skies pass away unregarded, and
    are soon consigned to oblivion, acquire in this forlorn and distant circle
    a superior degree of acceptable importance.</p>
  <p>On the anniversary of the King&rsquo;s birthday all the officers not on
    duty, both of the garrison and his Majesty&rsquo;s ships, dined with the
    Governor. On so joyful an occasion, the first too ever celebrated in our
    new settlement, it were needless to say, that loyal conviviality dictated
    every sentiment, and inspired every guest. Among other public toasts drank,
    was, Prosperity to Sydney Cove, in Cumberland county, now named so by authority.
    At day-light in the morning the ships of war had fired twenty-one guns each,
    which was repeated at noon, and answered by three vollies from the battalion
    of marines.</p>
  <p>Nor were the officers alone partakers of the general relaxation. The four
    unhappy wretches labouring under sentence of banishment were freed from their
    fetters, to rejoin their former society; and three days given as holidays
    to every convict in the colony. Hospitality too, which ever acquires a double
    relish by being extended, was not forgotten on the 4th of June, when each
    prisoner, male and female, received an allowance of grog; and every non-commissioned
    officer and private soldier had the honor of drinking prosperity to his royal
    master, in a pint of porter, served out at the flag staff, in addition to
    the customary allowance of spirits. Bonfires concluded the evening, and I
    am happy to say, that excepting a single instance which shall be taken notice
    of hereafter, no bad consequence, or unpleasant remembrance, flowed from
    an indulgence so amply bestowed.</p>
  <p>About this time (June) an accident happened, which I record with much regret.
    The whole of our black cattle, consisting of five cows and a bull, either
    from not being properly secured, or from the negligence of those appointed
    to take care of them, strayed into the woods, and in spite of all the search
    we have been able to make, are not yet found. As a convict of the name of
    Corbet, who was accused of a theft, eloped nearly at the same time, it was
    at first believed, that he had taken the desperate measure of driving off
    the cattle, in order to subsist on them as long as possible; or perhaps to
    deliver them to the natives. In this uncertainty, parties to search were
    sent out in different directions; and the fugitive declared an outlaw, in
    case of not returning by a fixed day. After much anxiety and fatigue, those
    who had undertaken the task returned without finding the cattle. But on the
    21st of the month, Corbet made his appearance near a farm belonging to the
    Governor, and entreated a convict, who happened to be on the spot, to give
    him some food, as he was perishing for hunger. The man applied to, under
    pretence of fetching what he asked for, went away and immediately gave the
    necessary information, in consequence of which a party under arms was sent
    out and apprehended him. When the poor wretch was brought in, he was greatly
    emaciated and almost famished. But on proper restoratives being administered,
    he was so far recovered by the 24th, as to be able to stand his trial, when
    he pleaded Guilty to the robbery with which he stood charged, and received
    sentence of death. In the course of repeated examinations it plainly appeared,
    he was an utter stranger to the place where the cattle might be, and was
    in no shape concerned in having driven them off.</p>
  <p>Samuel Peyton, convict, for having on the evening of the King&rsquo;s birth-day
    broke open an officer&rsquo;s marquee, with an intent to commit robbery,
    of which he was fully convicted, had sentence of death passed on him at the
    same time as Corbet; and on the following day they were both executed, confessing
    the justness of their fate, and imploring the forgiveness of those whom they
    had injured. Peyton, at the time of his suffering, was but twenty years of
    age, the greatest part of which had been invariably passed in the commission
    of crimes, that at length terminated in his ignominious end. The following
    letter, written by a fellow convict to the sufferer&rsquo;s unhappy mother,
    I shall make no apology for presenting to the reader; it affords a melancholy
    proof, that not the ignorant and untaught only have provoked the justice
    of their country to banish them to this remote region.</p>

  <p class="note">&ldquo;With a heart oppressed by the keenest sense of
      anguish, and too much agitated by the idea of my very melancholy condition,

  <p class="note">&ldquo;My  mother! with what agony of soul do I dedicate

      promises of that Saviour who died for us all, I trust to receive that mercy
      in the world to come, which my offences have deprived me of all hope, or

      the Almighty will enable you to bear. Banish from your memory all my former
      indiscretions, and let the cheering hope of a happy meeting hereafter,
      console you for my loss. Sincerely penitent for my sins; sensible of the
      justice of my conviction and sentence, and firmly relying on the merits
      of a Blessed Redeemer, I am at perfect peace with all mankind, and trust

  <p>After this nothing occurred with which I think it necessary to trouble the
    reader. The contents of the following chapters could not, I conceive, be
    so properly interwoven in the body of the work; I have, therefore, assigned
    them a place by themselves, with a view that the conclusions adopted in them
    may be more strongly enforced on the minds of those, to whom they are more
    particularly addressed.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter15"></a>Chapter 15</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="note">The Face of the Country; its Productions, Climate, &amp;c.</p>
  <p>To the geographical knowledge of this country, supplied by Captain Cook,
    and Captain Furneaux, we are able to add nothing. The latter explored the
    coast from Van Diemen&rsquo;s land to the latitude of 39 deg south; and Cook
    from Point Hicks, which lies in 37 deg 58 min, to Endeavour Streights. The
    intermediate space between the end of Furneaux&rsquo;s discovery and Point
    Hicks, is, therefore, the only part of the south-east coast unknown, and
    it so happened on our passage thither, owing to the weather, which forbade
    any part of the ships engaging with the shore, that we are unable to pronounce
    whether, or not, a streight intersects the continent hereabouts: though I
    beg leave to say, that I have been informed by a naval friend, that when
    the fleet was off this part of the coast, a strong set-off shore was plainly
    felt.</p>
  <p>At the distance of 60 miles inland, a prodigious chain of lofty mountains
    runs nearly in a north and south direction, further than the eye can trace
    them. Should nothing intervene to prevent it, the Governor intends, shortly,
    to explore their summits: and, I think there can be little doubt, that his
    curiosity will not go unrewarded. If large rivers do exist in the country,
    which some of us are almost sceptical enough to doubt, their sources must
    arise amidst these hills; and the direction they run in, for a considerable
    distance, must be either due north, or due south. For it is strikingly singular
    that three such noble harbours as Botany Bay, Port Jackson, and Broken Bay,
    alike end in shallows and swamps, filled with mangroves.</p>
  <p>The general face of the country is certainly pleasing, being diversified
    with gentle ascents, and little winding vallies, covered for the most part
    with large spreading trees, which afford a succession of leaves in all seasons.
    In those places where trees are scarce, a variety of flowering shrubs abound,
    most of them entirely new to an European, and surpassing in beauty, fragrance,
    and number, all I ever saw in an uncultivated state: among these, a tall
    shrub, bearing an elegant white flower, which smells like English May, is
    particularly delightful, and perfumes the air around to a great distance.
    The species of trees are few, and, I am concerned to add, the wood universally
    of so bad a grain, as almost to preclude a possibility of using it: the increase
    of labour occasioned by this in our buildings has been such, as nearly to
    exceed belief. These trees yield a profusion of thick red gum (not unlike
    the &lsquo;sanguis draconis&rsquo;) which is found serviceable in medicine,
    particularly in dysenteric complaints, where it has sometimes succeeded,
    when all other preparations have failed. To blunt its acrid qualities, it
    is usual to combine it with opiates.</p>
  <p>The nature of the soil is various. That immediately round Sydney Cove is
    sandy, with here and there a stratum of clay. From the sand we have yet been
    able to draw very little; but there seems no reason to doubt, that many large
    tracts of land around us will bring to perfection whatever shall be sown
    in them. To give this matter a fair trial, some practical farmers capable
    of such an undertaking should be sent out; for the spots we have chosen for
    experiments in agriculture, in which we can scarce be supposed adepts, have
    hitherto but ill repaid our toil, which may be imputable to our having chosen
    such as are unfavourable for our purpose.</p>
  <p>Except from the size of the trees, the difficulties of clearing the land
    are not numerous, underwood being rarely found, though the country is not
    absolutely without it. Of the natural meadows which Mr. Cook mentions near
    Botany Bay, we can give no account; none such exist about Port Jackson. Grass,
    however, grows in every place but the swamps with the greatest vigour and
    luxuriancy, though it is not of the finest quality, and is found to agree
    better with horses and cows than sheep. A few wild fruits are sometimes procured,
    among which is the small purple apple mentioned by Cook, and a fruit which
    has the appearance of a grape, though in taste more like a green gooseberry,
    being excessively sour: probably were it meliorated by cultivation, it would
    become more palatable.</p>
  <p>Fresh water, as I have said before, is found but in inconsiderable quantities.
    For the common purposes of life there is generally enough; but we know of
    no stream in the country capable of turning a mill: and the remark made by
    Mr. Anderson, of the dryness of the country round Adventure Bay, extends
    without exception to every part of it which we have penetrated.</p>
  <p>Previous to leaving England I remember to have frequently heard it asserted,
    that the discovery of mines was one of the secondary objects of the expedition.
    Perhaps there are mines; but as no person competent to form a decision is
    to be found among us, I wish no one to adopt an idea, that I mean to impress
    him with such a belief, when I state, that individuals, whose judgements
    are not despicable, are willing to think favourably of this conjecture, from
    specimens of ore seen in many of the stones picked up here. I cannot quit
    this subject without regretting, that some one capable of throwing a better
    light on it, is not in the colony. Nor can I help being equally concerned,
    that an experienced botanist was not sent out, for the purpose of collecting
    and describing the rare and beautiful plants with which the country abounds.
    Indeed, we flattered ourselves, when at the Cape of Good Hope, that Mason,
    the King&rsquo;s botanical gardener, who was employed there in collecting
    for the royal nursery at Kew, would have joined us, but it seems his orders
    and engagements prevented him from quitting that beaten track, to enter on
    this scene of novelty and variety.</p>
  <p>To the naturalist this country holds out many invitations. Birds, though
    not remarkably numerous, are in great variety, and of the most exquisite
    beauty of plumage, among which are the cockatoo, lory, and parroquet; but
    the bird which principally claims attention is, a species of ostrich, approaching
    nearer to the emu of South America than any other we know of. One of them
    was shot, at a considerable distance, with a single ball, by a convict employed
    for that purpose by the Governor; its weight, when complete, was seventy
    pounds, and its length from the end of the toe to the tip of the beak, seven
    feet two inches, though there was reason to believe it had not attained its
    full growth. On dissection many anatomical singularities were observed: the
    gall-bladder was remarkably large, the liver not bigger than that of a barn-door
    fowl, and after the strictest search no gizzard could be found; the legs,
    which were of a vast length, were covered with thick, strong scales, plainly
    indicating the animal to be formed for living amidst deserts; and the foot
    differed from an ostrich&rsquo;s by forming a triangle, instead of being
    cloven.</p>
  <p>Goldsmith, whose account of the emu is the only one I can refer to, says, &ldquo;that
    it is covered from the back and rump with long feathers, which fall backward,
    and cover the anus; these feathers are grey on the back, and white on the
    belly.&rdquo; The wings are so small as hardly to deserve the name, and are
    unfurnished with those beautiful ornaments which adorn the wings of the ostrich:
    all the feathers are extremely coarse, but the construction of them deserves
    notice&mdash;they grow in pairs from a single shaft, a singularity which
    the author I have quoted has omitted to remark. It may be presumed, that
    these birds are not very scarce, as several have been seen, some of them
    immensely large, but they are so wild, as to make shooting them a matter
    of great difficulty. Though incapable of flying, they run with such swiftness,
    that our fleetest greyhounds are left far behind in every attempt to catch
    them. The flesh was eaten, and tasted like beef.</p>
  <p>Besides the emu, many birds of prodigious size have been seen, which promise
    to increase the number of those described by naturalists, whenever we shall
    be fortunate enough to obtain them; but among these the bat of the Endeavour
    River is not to be found. In the woods are various little songsters, whose
    notes are equally sweet and plaintive.</p>
  <p>Of quadrupeds, except the kangaroo, I have little to say. The few met with
    are almost invariably of the opossum tribe, but even these do not abound.
    To beasts of prey we are utter strangers, nor have we yet any cause to believe
    that they exist in the country. And happy it is for us that they do not,
    as their presence would deprive us of the only fresh meals the settlement
    affords, the flesh of the kangaroo. This singular animal is already known
    in Europe by the drawing and description of Mr. Cook. To the drawing nothing
    can be objected but the position of the claws of the hinder leg, which are
    mixed together like those of a dog, whereas no such indistinctness is to
    be found in the animal I am describing. It was the Chevalier De Perrouse
    who pointed out this to me, while we were comparing a kangaroo with the plate,
    which, as he justly observed, is correct enough to give the world in general
    a good idea of the animal, but not sufficiently accurate for the man of science.</p>
  <p>Of the natural history of the kangaroo we are still very ignorant. We may,
    however, venture to pronounce this animal, a new species of opossum, the
    female being furnished with a bag, in which the young is contained; and in
    which the teats are found. These last are only two in number, a strong presumptive
    proof, had we no other evidence, that the kangaroo brings forth rarely more
    than one at a birth. But this is settled beyond a doubt, from more than a
    dozen females having been killed, which had invariably but one formed in
    the pouch. Notwithstanding this, the animal may be looked on as prolific,
    from the early age it begins to breed at, kangaroos with young having been
    taken of not more than thirty pounds weight; and there is room to believe
    that when at their utmost growth, they weigh not less than one hundred and
    fifty pounds. A male of one hundred and thirty pounds weight has been killed,
    whose dimensions were as follows:</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="e00083-images/table01.png" width="850" height="309"></p>
  <p>After this perhaps I shall hardly be credited, when I affirm that the kangaroo
    on being brought forth is not larger than an English mouse. It is, however,
    in my power to speak positively on this head, as I have seen more than one
    instance of it.</p>
  <p>In running, this animal confines himself entirely to his hinder, legs, which
    are possessed with an extraordinary muscular power. Their speed is very great,
    though not in general quite equal to that of a greyhound; but when the greyhounds
    are so fortunate as to seize them, they are incapable of retaining their
    hold, from the amazing struggles of the animal. The bound of the kangaroo,
    when not hard pressed, has been measured, and found to exceed twenty feet.</p>
  <p>At what time of the year they copulate, and in what manner, we know not:
    the testicles of the male are placed contrary to the usual order of nature.</p>
  <p>When young the kangaroo eats tender and well flavoured, tasting like veal,
    but the old ones are more tough and stringy than bullbeef. They are not carnivorous,
    and subsist altogether on particular flowers and grass. Their bleat is mournful,
    and very different from that of any other animal: it is, however, seldom
    heard but in the young ones.</p>
  <p>Fish, which our sanguine hopes led us to expect in great quantities, do
    not abound. In summer they are tolerably plentiful, but for some months past
    very few have been taken. Botany Bay in this respect exceeds Port Jackson.
    The French once caught near two thousand fish in one day, of a species of
    grouper, to which, from the form of a bone in the head resembling a helmet,
    we have given the name of light horseman. To this may be added bass, mullets,
    skait, soles, leather-jackets, and many other species, all so good in their
    kind, as to double our regret at their not being more numerous. Sharks of
    an enormous size are found here. One of these was caught by the people on
    board the Sirius, which measured at the shoulders six feet and a half in
    circumference. His liver yielded twenty-four gallons of oil; and in his stomach
    was found the head of a shark, which had been thrown overboard from the same
    ship. The Indians, probably from having felt the effects of their voracious
    fury, testify the utmost horror on seeing these terrible fish.</p>
  <p>Venomous animals and reptiles are rarely seen. Large snakes beautifully
    variegated have been killed, but of the effect of their bites we are happily
    ignorant. Insects, though numerous, are by no means, even in summer, so troublesome
    as I have found them in America, the West Indies, and other countries.</p>
  <p>The climate is undoubtedly very desirable to live in. In summer the heats
    are usually moderated by the sea breeze, which sets in early; and in winter
    the degree of cold is so slight as to occasion no inconvenience; once or
    twice we have had hoar frosts and hail, but no appearance of snow. The thermometer
    has never risen beyond 84, nor fallen lower than 35, in general it stood
    in the beginning of February at between 78 and 74 at noon. Nor is the temperature
    of the air less healthy than pleasant. Those dreadful putrid fevers by which
    new countries are so often ravaged, are unknown to us: and excepting a slight
    diarrhoea, which prevailed soon after we had landed, and was fatal in very
    few instances, we are strangers to epidemic diseases.</p>
  <p>On the whole, (thunder storms in the hot months excepted) I know not any
    climate equal to this I write in. Ere we had been a fortnight on shore we
    experienced some storms of thunder accompanied with rain, than which nothing
    can be conceived more violent and tremendous, and their repetition for several
    days, joined to the damage they did, by killing several of our sheep, led
    us to draw presages of an unpleasant nature. Happily, however, for many months
    we have escaped any similar visitations.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="note">The Progress made in the Settlement; and the Situation of
    Affairs at the Time of the Ship, which conveys this Account, sailing for
    England</p>
  <p>For the purpose of expediting the public work, the male convicts have been
    divided into gangs, over each of which a person, selected from among themselves,
    is placed. It is to be regretted that Government did not take this matter
    into consideration before we left England, and appoint proper persons with
    reasonable salaries to execute the office of overseers; as the consequence
    of our present imperfect plan is such, as to defeat in a great measure the
    purposes for which the prisoners were sent out. The female convicts have
    hitherto lived in a state of total idleness; except a few who are kept at
    work in making pegs for tiles, and picking up shells for burning into lime.
    For the last time I repeat, that the behaviour of all classes of these people
    since our arrival in the settlement has been better than could, I think,
    have been expected from them.</p>
  <p>Temporary wooden storehouses covered with thatch or shingles, in which the
    cargoes of all the ships have been lodged, are completed; and an hospital
    is erected. Barracks for the military are considerably advanced; and little
    huts to serve, until something more permanent can be finished, have been
    raised on all sides. Notwithstanding this the encampments of the marines
    and convicts are still kept up; and to secure their owners from the coldness
    of the nights, are covered in with bushes, and thatched over.</p>
  <p>The plan of a town I have already said is marked out. And as freestone of
    an excellent quality abounds, one requisite towards the completion of it
    is attained. Only two houses of stone are yet begun, which are intended for
    the Governor and Lieutenant Governor. One of the greatest impediments we
    meet with is a want of limestone, of which no signs appear. Clay for making
    bricks is in plenty, and a considerable quantity of them burned and ready
    for use.</p>
  <p>In enumerating the public buildings I find I have been so remiss as to omit
    an observatory, which is erected at a small distance from the encampments.
    It is nearly completed, and when fitted up with the telescopes and other
    astronomical instruments sent out by the Board of Longitude, will afford
    a desirable retreat from the listlessness of a camp evening at Port Jackson.
    One of the principal reasons which induced the Board to grant this apparatus
    was, for the purpose of enabling Lieutenant Dawes, of the marines, (to whose
    care it is intrusted) to make observations on a comet which is shortly expected
    to appear in the southern hemisphere. The latitude of the observatory, from
    the result of more than three hundred observations, is fixed at 33 deg 52
    min 30 sec south, and the longitude at 151 deg 16 min 30 sec east of Greenwich.
    The latitude of the south head which forms the entrance of the harbour, 33
    deg 51 min, and that of the north head opposite to it at 33 deg 49 min 45
    sec south.</p>
  <p>Since landing here our military force has suffered a diminution of only
    three persons, a serjeant and two privates. Of the convicts fifty-four have
    perished, including the executions. Amidst the causes of this mortality,
    excessive toil and a scarcity of food are not to be numbered, as the reader
    will easily conceive, when informed, that they have the same allowance of
    provisions as every officer and soldier in the garrison; and are indulged
    by being exempted from labour every Saturday afternoon and Sunday. On the
    latter of those days they are expected to attend divine service, which is
    performed either within one of the storehouses, or under a great tree in
    the open air, until a church can be built.</p>
  <p>Amidst our public labours, that no fortified post, or place of security,
    is yet begun, may be a matter of surprise. Were an emergency in the night
    to happen, it is not easy to say what might not take place before troops,
    scattered about in an extensive encampment, could be formed, so as to act.
    An event that happened a few evenings since may, perhaps, be the means of
    forwarding this necessary work. In the dead of night the centinels on the
    eastern side of the cove were alarmed by the voices of the Indians, talking
    near their posts. The soldiers on this occasion acted with their usual firmness,
    and without creating a disturbance, acquainted the officer of the guard with
    the circumstance, who immediately took every precaution to prevent an attack,
    and at the same time gave orders that no molestation, while they continued
    peaceable, should be offered them. From the darkness of the night, and the
    distance they kept at, it was not easy to ascertain their number, but from
    the sound of the voices and other circumstances, it was calculated at near
    thirty. To their intentions in honouring us with this visit (the only one
    we have had from them in the last five months) we are strangers, though most
    probably it was either with a view to pilfer, or to ascertain in what security
    we slept, and the precautions we used in the night. When the bells of the
    ships in the harbour struck the hour of the night, and the centinels called
    out on their posts &ldquo;All&rsquo;s well,&rdquo; they observed a dead silence,
    and continued it for some minutes, though talking with the greatest earnestness
    and vociferation but the moment before. After having remained a considerable
    time they departed without interchanging a syllable with our people.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter17"></a>Chapter 17</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="note">Some Thoughts on the Advantages which may arise to the Mother
    Country from forming the Colony.</p>
  <p>The author of these sheets would subject himself to the charge of presumption,
    were he to aim at developing the intentions of Government in forming this
    settlement. But without giving offence, or incurring reproach, he hopes his
    opinion on the probability of advantage to be drawn from hence by Great Britain,
    may be fairly made known.</p>
  <p>If only a receptacle for convicts be intended, this place stands unequalled
    from the situation, extent, and nature of the country. When viewed in a commercial
    light, I fear its insignificance will appear very striking. The New Zealand
    hemp, of which so many sanguine expectations were formed, is not a native
    of the soil; and Norfolk Island, where we made sure to find this article,
    is also without it. So that the scheme of being able to assist the East Indies
    with naval stores, in case of a war, must fall to the ground, both from this
    deficiency, and the quality of the timber growing here. Were it indeed possible
    to transport that of Norfolk Island, its value would be found very great,
    but the difficulty, from the surf, I am well informed, is so insuperable
    as to forbid the attempt. Lord Howe Island, discovered by Lieut. Ball, though
    an inestimable acquisition to our colony, produces little else than the mountain
    cabbage tree.</p>
  <p>Should a sufficient military force be sent out to those employed in cultivating
    the ground, I see no room to doubt, that in the course of a few years, the
    country will be able to yield grain enough for the support of its new possessors.
    But to effect this, our present limits must be greatly extended, which will
    require detachments of troops not to be spared from the present establishment.
    And admitting the position, the parent country will still have to supply
    us for a much longer time with every other necessary of life. For after what
    we have seen, the idea of being soon able to breed cattle sufficient for
    our consumption, must appear chimerical and absurd. From all which it is
    evident, that should Great Britain neglect to send out regular supplies,
    the most fatal consequences will ensue.</p>
  <p>Speculators who may feel inclined to try their fortunes here, will do well
    to weigh what I have said. If golden dreams of commerce and wealth flatter
    their imaginations, disappointment will follow: the remoteness of situation,
    productions of the country, and want of connection with other parts of the
    world, justify me in the assertion. But to men of small property, unambitious
    of trade, and wishing for retirement, I think the continent of New South
    Wales not without inducements. One of this description, with letters of recommendation,
    and a sufficient capital (after having provided for his passage hither) to
    furnish him with an assortment of tools for clearing land, agricultural and
    domestic purposes; possessed also of a few household utensils, a cow, a few
    sheep and breeding sows, would, I am of opinion, with proper protection and
    encouragement, succeed in obtaining a comfortable livelihood, were he well
    assured before he quitted his native country, that a provision for him until
    he might be settled, should be secured; and that a grant of land on his arrival
    would be allotted him.</p>
  <p>That this adventurer, if of a persevering character and competent knowledge,
    might in the course of ten years bring matters into such a train as to render
    himself comfortable and independent, I think highly probable. The superfluities
    of his farm would enable him to purchase European commodities from the masters
    of ships, which will arrive on Government account, sufficient to supply his
    wants. But beyond this he ought not to reckon, for admitting that he might
    meet with success in raising tobacco, rice, indigo, or vineyards (for which
    last I think the soil and climate admirably adapted), the distance of a mart
    to vend them at, would make the expense of transportation so excessive, as
    to cut off all hopes of a reasonable profit; nor can there be consumers enough
    here to take them off his hands, for so great a length of time to come, as
    I shall not be at the trouble of computing.</p>
  <p>Should then any one, induced by this account, emigrate hither, let him,
    before he quits England, provide all his wearing apparel for himself, family,
    and servants; his furniture, tools of every kind, and implements of husbandry
    (among which a plough need not be included, as we make use of the hoe), for
    he will touch at no place where they can be purchased to advantage. If his
    sheep and hogs are English also, it will be better. For wines, spirits, tobacco,
    sugar, coffee, tea, rice, poultry, and many other articles, he may venture
    to rely on at Teneriffe or Madeira, the Brazils and Cape of Good Hope. It
    will not be his interest to draw bills on his voyage out, as the exchange
    of money will be found invariably against him, and a large discount also
    deducted. Drafts on the place he is to touch at, or cash (dollars if possible)
    will best answer his end.</p>
  <p>To men of desperate fortune and the lowest classes of the people, unless
    they can procure a passage as indented servants, similar to the custom practised
    of emigrating to America, this part of the world offers no temptation: for
    it can hardly be supposed, that Government will be fond of maintaining them
    here until they can be settled, and without such support they must starve.</p>
  <p>Of the Governor&rsquo;s instructions and intentions relative to the disposal
    of the convicts, when the term of their transportation shall be expired,
    I am ignorant. They will then be free men, and at liberty, I apprehend, either
    to settle in the country, or to return to Europe. The former will be attended
    with some public expense; and the latter, except in particular cases, will
    be difficult to accomplish, from the numberless causes which prevent a frequent
    communication between England and this continent.</p>

  <p align="center">Sydney Cove, Port Jackson, New South Wales.<br>
    October 1st, 1788.</p>
  <p>Little material has occurred in this colony since the departure of the ships
    for England, on the 14th July last. On the 20th of that month His Majesty&rsquo;s
    ship Supply, Captain Ball, sailed for Norfolk Island, and returned on the
    26th August. Our accounts from thence are more favourable than were expected.
    The soil proves admirably adapted to produce all kinds of grain, and European
    vegetables. But the discovery which constitutes its value is the New Zealand
    flax, plants of which are found growing in every part of the island in the
    utmost luxuriancy and abundance. This will, beyond doubt, appear strange
    to the reader after what has been related in the former part of my work:
    and in future, let the credit of the testimony be as high as it may, I shall
    never without diffidence and hesitation presume to contradict the narrations
    of Mr. Cook. The truth is, that those sent to settle and explore the island
    knew not the form in which the plant grows, and were unfurnished with every
    particular which could lead to a knowledge of it. Unaccountable as this may
    sound, it is, nevertheless, incontestably true. Captain Ball brought away
    with him several specimens for inspection, and, on trial, by some flax-dressers
    among us, the threads produced from them, though coarse, are pronounced to
    be stronger, more likely to be durable, and fitter for every purpose of manufacturing
    cordage, than any they ever before dressed.</p>
  <p>Every research has been made by those on the island to find a landing-place,
    whence it might be practicable to ship off the timber growing there, but
    hitherto none has been discovered. A plan, however, for making one has been
    laid before the Governor, and is at present under consideration, though (in
    the opinion of many here) it is not such an one as will be found to answer
    the end proposed.</p>
  <p>Lieut. King and his little garrison were well when the &lsquo;Supply&rsquo; left
    them: but I am sorry to add, that, from casualties, their number is already
    five less than it originally was. A ship from hence is ready to sail with
    an increase of force, besides many convicts for the purpose of sawing up
    timber, and turning the flax-plant to advantage.</p>
  <p>So much for Norfolk. In Port Jackson all is quiet and stupid as could be
    wished. We generally hear the lie of the day as soon as the beating of the
    Reveille announces the return of it; find it contradicted by breakfast time;
    and pursue a second through all its varieties, until night, welcome as to
    a lover, gives us to sleep and dream ourselves transported to happier climes.</p>
  <p>Let me not, however, neglect telling you the little news which presents
    itself. All descriptions of men enjoy the highest state of health; and the
    convicts continue to behave extremely well. A gang of one hundred of them,
    guarded by a captain, two subalterns and 20 marines, is about to be sent
    up to the head of the harbour, at the distance of 3 leagues, in a westerly
    direction, from Sydney Cove, for the purpose of establishing a settlement
    there. The convicts are to be employed in putting the land around into cultivation,
    as it appears to be of a more promising nature than that near the encampment.
    Indeed this last hitherto succeeds but very indifferently, though I do not
    yet despair, that when good seeds can be procured, our toil will be better
    rewarded. But as this is an event at a distance, and in itself very precarious,
    Governor Phillip has determined on procuring a supply of flour and other
    necessaries from the Cape of Good Hope, as our stock on hand is found to
    be, on examination, not quite so ample as had been reckoned upon. To execute
    this purpose his Excellency has ordered the Sirius to prepare for the voyage;
    by which conveyance the opportunity of writing to you is afforded me. It
    was at first intended to dispatch the Sirius to some of the neighbouring
    islands (the Friendly or Society) in the Pacific Ocean, to procure stock
    there, but the uselessness of the scheme, joined to the situation of matters
    here, has, happily for us, prevented its being put into execution.</p>
