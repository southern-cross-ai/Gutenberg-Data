<p><b>The following is the correct and authorized translation of
the dogma of infallibility. It is from advance sheets of the
<i>Catholic World</i> for September:</b>
</p>

<p><i>Pius, Bishop, Servant of the Servants of God, with the
Approbation of the Holy Council, for a Perpetual Remembrance
Hereof.</i>
</p>

<p>The eternal Shepherd and Bishop of our souls, in order to render
perpetual the saving work of His redemption, resolved to build the
Holy Church, in which, as in the house of the living God, all the
faithful should be united by the bond of the same faith and
charity. For which reason, before he was glorified, he prayed the
Father, not for the apostles alone, but also for those who through
their word would believe in Him, that they all might be one, as the
Son himself and the Father are one. (John, xvii. 1-20.) Wherefore,
even as He sent the apostles, whom He had (chosen from the world as
He had been sent by the Father, so He willed that there should be
pastors and teachers in His Church even to the consummation of the
world. Moreover to the end that the Episcopal body itself might be
one and undivided, and that the entire multitude of believers might
be preserved in oneness of faith and of communion, through priests
cleaving mutually together, He placed the blessed Peter before the
other apostles and established in him a perpetual principle of his
twofold unity, and a visible foundation on whose strength "the
eternal temple might be built, and in whose firm faith the Church
might rise upward, until her summit reach the heavens," (St Leo the
Great, Sermon iv. (or iii.) chapter 2, on Christmas.) Now, seeing
that in order to overthrow, if possible, the Church, the powers of
hell on every side, and with a hatred which increases day by day,
are assailing her foundation, which was placed by God, we,
therefore, for the preservation, the safety and the increase of the
Catholic flock, and with the approbation of the sacred Council,
have judged it necessary to set forth the doctrine which, according
to the ancient and constant faith of the universal Church, all the
faithful must believe and hold, touching the institution, the
perpetuity, and the nature of the sacred apostolic primacy, in
which stands the power and strength of the entire Church; and to
proscribe and condemn the contrary errors so hurtful to the flock
of the Lord.</p>

<p class="cpb">CHAPTER I.</p>

<p><i>Of the Institution of the Apostolic Primacy in the Blessed
Peter.</i>
</p>

<p>We teach, therefore, and declare that, according to the
testimonies Of the Gospel, the primacy of jurisdiction over the
whole Church of God was promised and given immediately and directly
to blessed Peter, the apostle, by Christ our Lord. For it was to
Simon alone to whom he had already said, "Thou shalt be called
Cephas," (John, i, 42) that, after he had professed his faith,
"Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God," our Lord said,
"Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona; because flesh and blood hath not
revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in heaven; and I say to
thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my
Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it; and I
will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatsoever
thou shalt bind upon earth it shall be bound also in heaven; and
whatsoever thou shalt loose upon earth, it shall be loosed also in
heaven." (Matthew, xvi., 16-19.) And it was to Simon Peter alone
that Jesus, after his resurrection, gave the jurisdiction of
supreme shepherd and ruler over the whole of his fold, saying,
"Feed my lambs; feed my sheep." (John, xxi., 15-17.) To this
doctrine so clearly set forth in the sacred Scriptures, as the
Catholic Church has always understood it, are plainly opposed the
perverse opinions of those who, distorting the form of government
established in his Church by Christ our Lord, deny that Peter alone
above the other apostles, whether taken separately one by one or
all together, was endowed by Christ with a true and real primacy of
jurisdiction; or who assert that this primacy was not given
immediately and directly to blessed Peter, but to the Church, and
through her to him, as to the agent of the Church. If, therefore,
any one shall say that blessed Peter, the apostle, was not
appointed by Christ our Lord, the Prince of all the apostles, and
the visible head of the whole Church militant; or, that he received
directly and immediately from our Lord Jesus Christ only the
primacy of honor, and not that of true and real jurisdiction, let
him be anathema.</p>

<p class="cpb">CHAPTER II.</p>

<p><i>Of the Perpetuity of the Primacy of Peter in the Roman
Pontiffs.</i>
</p>

<p>What the prince of pastors and the great shepherd of the sheep,
our Lord Jesus Christ, established in the person of the blessed
apostle Peter, for the perpetual welfare and lasting good of the
Church, the same through his power must needs last forever in that
Church, which is founded upon the rock, and will stand firm till
the end of time. And, indeed, it is well known, as it has been in
all ages, that the holy and most blessed Peter, prince and head of
the apostles, pillar of the faith and foundation of the Catholic
Church, who received from our Lord Jesus Christ, the Savior and
Redeemer of mankind, the keys of the kingdom of heaven, to this
present time, and at all times lives and presides and pronounces
judgment in the person of his successors, the Bishops of the holy
Roman See, which was founded by him, and consecrated by his blood.
(Council of Eph. sess. iii. St. Peter Chrys, Ep, an Eutych.) So
that whoever succeeds Peter in this chair, holds, according to
Christ's own institution, the primacy of Peter over the whole
Church. What, therefore, was once established by Him who is the
truth, still remains, and blessed Peter, retaining the strength of
the rock, which has been given to him, has never left the helm of
the Church originally intrusted to him. (S. Leo, Serm. iii. chap.
iii.) For this reason it was always necessary for every other
Church, that is, the faithful of all countries, to have recourse to
the Roman Church on account of its superior headship, in order that
being joined, as members to their head, with this See, from which
the rights of religious communion flow unto all, they might be
knitted into the unity of one body. (St. Irenaeus against Heresies,
book iii. chap. iii. Epist. of Council of Aquileian, 381 to
Grattian, chap. iv. of Pius VI, Brief. Super Ibid. itate.) If,
therefore, any one shall say that it is not by the institution of
Christ our Lord Himself, or by divine right, that blessed Peter has
perpetual successors in the primacy over the whole Church; or, that
the Roman pontiff is not the successor of blessed Peter in this
Primacy, let him be anathema.</p>

<p class="cpb">CHAPTER III.</p>

<p><i>Of the Power and Nature of the Primacy of the Roman
Pontiff.</i>
</p>

<p>Wherefore, resting upon the clear testimonies of Holy Writ, and
following the full and explicit decrees of our predecessors, the
Roman Pontiffs, and of general councils, we renew the definition of
the Ecumenical Council of Florence, according to which all the
faithful of Christ must believe that the Holy Apostolic See and the
Roman Pontiff hold the primacy over the whole world, and that the
Roman Pontiff is the successor of blessed Peter, the prince of the
apostles, and the true vicar of Christ, and is the head of the
whole Church, and the father and teacher of all Christians; and
that to him, in the blessed Peter, was given by our Lord Jesus
Christ full power of feeding, ruling and governing the universal
Church, as is also set forth in the acts of the Ecumenical
Councils, and in the sacred canons. Wherefore we teach and declare
that the Roman Church, under divine Providence, possesses a
headship of ordinary power over all other churches, and that this
power of jurisdiction of the Roman Pontiff, which is truly
Episcopal, is immediate, toward which the pastors and faithful of
whatever rite and dignity, whether singly or all together, are
bound by the duty of hierarchical subordination and of true
obedience, not only in things which appertain to faith and morals,
but likewise in those things winch concern the discipline and
government of the Church spread throughout the world, so that being
united with the Roman Pontiff, both in communion and in profession
of the same faith, the Church of Christ may be one fold under one
chief shepherd. This is the doctrine of Catholic truth, from which
no one can depart without loss of faith and salvation.</p>

<p>So far, nevertheless, is this power of the Supreme Pontiff from
trenching on that ordinary power of Episcopal jurisdiction by which
the Bishops, who have been instituted by the Holy Ghost, and have
succeeded in the place of the apostles, like true shepherds, feed
and rule the flocks assigned to them, each one his own; that, on
the contrary, this, their power, is asserted, strengthened and
vindicated by the supreme and universal pastor, as St. GREGORY the
Great saith; my honor is the honor of the universal Church; My
honor is the solid strength of my brethren; then am I truly honored
when to each one of them the honor due is not denied. (St. Gregory
Great ad Euloguius, Eplat. 30.) Moreover, from that supreme
authority of the Roman Pontiff to govern the universal Church,
there follows to him the right, in the exercise of his office, of
freely communicating with the pastors and flocks of the whole
church, that they may be taught and guided by him in the way of
salvation.</p>

<p>Wherefore, we condemn and reprobate the opinions of those who
say that this communication of the supreme head with the pastors
and flocks can be lawfully hindered, or who make it subject to the
secular power, maintaining that the things which are decreed by the
Apostolic See, or under its authority for the government of the
church, have no force or value unless they are confirmed by the
approval of the secular power. And since, by the divine right of
apostolic primacy, the Roman Pontiff presides over the universal
churches, we also teach and declare that he is the supreme judge of
the faithful, (PIUS VI, brief super. soliditate,) and that in all
causes calling for ecclesiastical trial, recourse may be had to his
Judgment, (second Council of Lyons;) but the decision of the
Apostolic See, above which there is no higher authority, cannot be
reconsidered by any one, nor is it lawful to any one to sit in
judgment on his Judgment. (NICHOLAS I, Epist. ad Michalem
Imperatorem.) Wherefore, they wander away from the right path of
truth who assert that it is lawful to appeal from the judgments of
the Roman Pontiff's to an Ecumenical Council, as if to an authority
superior to the Roman Pontiff. Therefore, if any one shall say that
the Roman Pontiff holds only the charge of inspection or direction,
and not full and supreme power of jurisdiction over the entire
Church, not only in things which pertain to faith and morals, but
also in those which pertain to the discipline and government of the
Church spread throughout the whole world; or that he possesses only
the chief part and not the entire plentitude of this supreme power;
or that this, his power, is not ordinary and immediate, both as
regards all and each of the Churches, and all and each of the
pastors and faithful, let him be anathema.</p>

<p class="cpb">CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p><i>Of the Infallible Authority of the Roman Pontiff in
Teaching.</i>
</p>

<p>This Holy See has ever held, the unbroken custom of the Church
has proved, and the Ecumenical Councils&mdash;those especially in
which the East joined with the West in union of faith and of
charity&mdash;have declared that in this apostolic primacy, which
the Roman Pontiff holds over the universal Church, as successor of
Peter, the prince of the apostles, there is also contained the
supreme power of authoritative teaching. Thus the fathers of the
fourth Council of Constantinople, following in the footsteps of
their predecessors, put forth this solemn profession:</p>

<p>"The first law of salvation is to keep the rule of true faith.
And whereas the words of our Lord Jesus Christ cannot be passed by,
who said: Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my
Church, (Matt. xvi, 18.,) these words, which he spoke, are proved
true by facts; for in the Apostolic See, the Catholic religion has
ever been preserved unspotted, and the holy doctrine has been
announced. Therefore, wishing never to be separated from the faith
and teaching of this See, we hope to be worthy to abide in that one
communion which the Apostolic See preaches, in which is the full
and true firmness of the Christian religion." (Formula of St.
Hormisdas Pope, as proposed by HADRIAN II. to the fathers of the
eighth general Council, (Constantinop. IV.,) and subscribed by
them.)</p>

<p>So, too, the Greeks, with the approval of the second council of
Lyons, professed that the holy Roman Church holds over the
universal Catholic Church, a Supreme and full primacy and headship
which she truthfully and humbly acknowledges that she received from
the Lord himself in blessed Peter, the prince or head of the
apostles of whom the Roman Pontiff is the successor; and as she,
beyond the others, is bound to defend the truth of the faith, so,
if any questions arise concerning faith, they should be decided by
her judgment; And finally, the Council of Florence defined that the
Roman Pontiff is the true vicar of Christ, and the head to the
whole Church, and the father and teacher of all Christians, and
that to him in the blessed Peter, was given by our Lord Jesus
Christ full power of feeding and ruling and governing the universal
Church. (John xxi., 15, 17.)</p>

<p>In order to fulfill this pastoral charge, our predecessors have
over labored unweariedly to spread the saving doctrine of Christ
among all the nations of the earth, and with equal care have
watched to preserve it pure and unchanged where it had been
received. Wherefore the Bishops of the whole world, sometimes
singly, sometimes assembled in synods, following the long
established custom of the Churches, (8. Cyril, Alex., ad S.
Coelest, Pap.,) and the form of ancient rule (St. Innocent I, to
Councils of Carthage and Milevi,) referred to this Apostolic See
those dangers especially which arose in matters of faith, in order
that injuries to faith might best be healed there, where the faith
could never fail. (St. Bernard, Ep. 120.) And the Roman Pontiffs,
weighing the condition of times and circumstances, sometimes
calling together general Councils, or asking the judgment of the
Church scattered through the world, sometimes consulting particular
synods, sometimes using such other aids as Divine Providence
supplied, defined that those doctrines should be held, which, by
the aid of God, they knew to be conformable to the holy Scriptures,
and the apostolic traditions. For the Holy Ghost is not promised to
the successors of Peter, that they may make known a new doctrine
revealed by him, but that through his assistance they may sacredly
guard, and faithfully sot forth, the revelation delivered by the
apostles, that is, the deposit of faith. And this their apostolic
teaching all the venerable fathers have embraced, and the holy
orthodox doctors have revered and followed, knowing most certainly
that this See of St Peter ever remains free from all error,
according to the divine promise of our Lord and Savior, made to the
prince of the apostles: I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail
not, and thou, being once converted, confirm thy brethren, (Conf.
St. Agatho, Ep. ad Imp: a Conc. Oecum vi. approbat.)</p>

<p>Therefore, tide gift of truth, and of faith which fails not, was
divinely bestowed on PETER and his successors in this chair, that
they should exercise their high office for the salvation of all,
that through them the universal flock of Christ should be turned
away from the poisonous food of error, and should be nourished with
the food of heavenly doctrine, and that the occasion of schism
being removed, the entire Church should be preserved one, and
planted on her foundation, should stand firm against the gates of
hell. Nevertheless, since in this present age, when the saving
efficacy of the apostolic office is exceedingly needed, there are
not a few who carp at its authority, we judge it altogether
necessary to solemnly declare the prerogative which the only
begotten Son of God has deigned to unite to the supreme pastoral
office.</p>

<p>Wherefore, faithfully adhering to the tradition handed down from
the commencement of the Christian faith, for the glory of God our
Saviour, the exaltation of the Catholic religion, and the salvation
of Christian peoples, with the approbation of the sacred Council,
we teach and define it, to be a doctrine divinely revealed; that
the Roman Pontiff, when he speaks <i>ex Cathedra</i>, that is, when
in exercise of his office of pastor and teacher of all Christian
peoples, and in virtue of his supreme apostolical authority, he
defines that a doctrine or faith or morals is to be held by the
universal Church, possesses, through the divine assistance promised
to him in time blessed Peter, that infallibility with which the
divine Redeemer willed his Church to he endowed, in defining a
doctrine of faith or morals; and therefore that such definitions of
the Roman Pontiff are irreformable of themselves, and not by force
of the consent of the Church thereto, And if any one shall presume,
which God forbid, to contradict this our definition, let him be
anathema.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>The Last Hours of the Council. Futile
Efforts of the Opposition to the Dogmatic Definition.</h2>

<h3>From the Rome Correspondent of the London Times, 23 July 1870.</h3>

<h3>Published: 6 August, 1870, The New York Times</h3>

<hr>

<p><b>Roma, July 18, 1870.</b> The great event so anxiously expected by
zealous Roman Catholics, is now accomplished. In the midst of
thunder, lightning, and rain, Pius IX, pro-theosized himself, if I
may be allowed to coin a word, and is now registered among the Dii
Majores. The event has been hurried on by the apprehension which
war has awakened, and by the great anxiety of the Bishops to get
away, for had all the formalities been observed, it is scarcely
likely that the dogma would have been proclaimed before the end of
the month. The efforts to turn the Pope from his purpose have been
unceasing up to the last moment. On Friday, in consequence of a
resolution of the International Committee, a deputation, consisting
of five of their number, sought and had an audience of the Pope,
They were, as I am informed, Cardinal Schwartzenburg, Monseigneur
Darboy, Archbishop of Paris; Monseigneur Ginouillhac, recently
created Archbishop of Lyons; Monseigneur Calabriano, Archbishop of
Milan, and Monseigneur Conolly, Archbishop of Halifax. The
Archbishop of Paris is stated to have thrown himself at the feet of
the Pope and entreated him not to make himself infallible&mdash;all
to no purpose, as the event has proved. His Holiness received them
kindly, begged them to leave in writing a statement of what they
desired, and then dismissed them&mdash;not, however, before
Cardinal Schwartzenburg. as I am told, declared that the dogma
would not be worth the paper on which it was written. On Saturday
the Fathers met again in a general congregation to consider the
votes of "Placet juxta modum," as I have already reported, and
later in that day or yesterday, the Opposition Fathers met at the
Archbishop of Paris' and Cardinal Raucher's apartments. Instead of
adhering to their original proposition to attend the Council and to
declare votes, it was decided to draw up a protest, sign it, and
then, absenting themselves from the Council, leave Rome as soon as
possible. Yesterday, therefore, was a busy day. One might have
counted no fewer than fifteen carriages at a time at the door of
Cardinal Rauscher, and last evening, nearly twenty of the Fathers
left Rome, and seven or eight this morning. There were ninety-six
absentees from the Public Session this morning, as far as I can
collect, at present, while 547 who were present voted "Placet," and
two, Neapolitans, had the pluck to cry "Non placet." The request of
the deputation from the International Committee was, that His
Holiness would omit to say that the infallibility of the Pope was
the tradition of the Church, and that he would cause the anathema
to be removed, but that is the bonne bouche of the whole affair,
and it was rather too much to expect that Christians so fond of
cursing could abstain from one curse more. There was a little
episode at the Congregation, on Saturday, worth nothing. At the
close of the proceedings, I believe a Cardinal read a protest
against the "putidissimas calummas" which have been published by
journalists and pamphleteers, not merely "the heterodox and open
enemies of the Cross of Christ," but "those who call themselves the
sons of the Catholic Church." Two copies of a protest were
therefore sent to each of the Fathers, who were invited to express
their sentiments regarding the "base lies" and "false and
caluminious statements" which had been spread to the dishonor of
the Church and the august person of our Most Holy Lord (Pius IX.)
Moreover, they were invited to sign it, which it was said was done,
and those papers were placed in the archives of the Council. Many,
however, certainly did not sign the protest, and could not honestly
sign it, for I know those among the Fathers who declared that every
word in La Dernière Heure du Concile, one of the works condemned,
was true. And now all who call are leaving. On Saturday the Papal
commission to start on their travels was given to the Fathers. who
have been dispersing ever since. They came, say the Romans, as
pastori, and leave as pecore. Nor is that all the truth, for they
leave as pecore shorn of all authority and independence.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>Scenes in the Council at
Rome&mdash;Efforts of the Minority Bishops.</h2>

<h3>The Rome correspondent of the Pall Mall Gazette, writes under
date of 18 July, 1870.</h3>

<h3>Published 8 August, 1870, The New York Times</h3>

<hr>

<p>This morning the Council of the Vatican hold its fourth public
session in the presence and under the presidency of the Pope. There
were very few spectators, and but two or three of the minor powers
were represented in the diplomatic tribune, the rest of the
diplomatic body having followed the example of the representatives
of France, Austria, and Prussia, who, in accordance with the
intention mentioned in my last, absented themselves from the
ceremony. The Vatican made a strong whip for the majority, and
brought together 533 prelates, though the number was largely made
up of Bishops in partibus. A hundred and ten Bishops now in Rome
refused to attend the sitting, the bold policy of signifying their
dissent by a public veto having, as I anticipated, been given up.
The dogmatic constitution, De Ecclesia Christi, with a chapter
defining infallibility, was put to the vote, and only two BIshops
were found courageous enough to exclaim aloud, "Non placet." Those
dissentients were Monsignor Riccio, Bishop of Cajaezo, in Sicily,
and an American Bishop, whose name I was unable to learn. The
superstitious consider it ominous that a violent storm burst over
the cathedral at the commencement of the proceedings and lasted
till their close. The orders for a salvo from Fort St. Angelo and a
jubilant peal from all the bells of Rome had been countermanded,
but the solemnity was not unheralded, and the Pope proclaimed
himself infallible amid peals of thunder and terrific flashes of
lightning. The Pope closed the proceedings with a short allocution.
Immediately after the proclamation of the dogma the Austrian
Ambassador quitted Rome, The officers and soldiers of the Roman
legion have, since the outbreak of the war, unanimously demanded
permission to return to France. On Saturday, the Bishops of the
minority held a conference in the apartments of Cardinal RAUSCHER,
and after a long debate sent a deputation to the commission for
dogma with a conciliatory proposition relative to Infallibility.
This was rejected by the Commission, and the deputation then
obtained an interview with the Pope. Here they were equally
unsuccessful, and the Holy Father peremptorily refused to make the
slightest modification in the scheme. He was no doubt well informed
as to the wavering spirit of the Bishops, which soon showed itself
clearly in a resolution to absent themselves from the public
sitting, where, in fact, they had but to vote non placet to achieve
all they desired. They are meeting the proclamation of the dogma by
a protest which they sign stante pede, but in Rome they and their
protest are alike regarded with indifference.</p>

requesting permission to include it in this document.
However, I include the ISBN for the benefit of people requiring
something more authoritatively edited than the account that was at
the disposal of the New York Times in the nineteenth century. The
book is available from Amazon at the time of my preparing the
document, and no doubt many academic libraries have copies at their
disposal.</p>

<p>Enjoy,</p>
