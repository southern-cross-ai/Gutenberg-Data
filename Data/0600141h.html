<h2>Mrs Miniver<br>
<br>

<hr>

<h2>MRS. MINIVER COMES HOME</h2>

<p>It was lovely, thought Mrs. Miniver, nodding good-bye to the
flower-woman and carrying her big sheaf of chrysanthemums down the
street with a kind of ceremonious joy, as though it were a
cornucopia; it was lovely, this settling down again, this tidying
away of the summer into its box, this taking up of the thread of
one's life where the holidays (irrelevant interlude) had made one
drop it. Not that she didn't enjoy the holidays: but she always
felt&mdash;and it was, perhaps, the measure of her peculiar
happiness&mdash;a little relieved when they were over. Her normal
life pleased her so well that she was half afraid to step out of
its frame in case one day she should find herself unable to get
back. The spell might break, the atmosphere be impossible to
recapture.</p>

<p>But this time, at any rate, she was safe. There was the house,
as neat and friendly as ever, facing her as she turned the corner
of the square; its small stucco face as indistinguishable from the
others, to a stranger, as a single sheep in a flock, but to her
apart, individual, a shade lighter than the house on the left, a
shade darker than the house on the right, with one plaster rosette
missing from the lintel of the front door and the first-floor
balcony almost imperceptibly crooked. And there was the square
itself, with the leaves still as thick on the trees as they had
been when she left in August; but in August they had hung heavily,
a uniform dull green, whereas now, crisped and brindled by the
first few nights of frost, they had taken on a new, various beauty.
Stepping lightly and quickly down the square, Mrs. Miniver suddenly
understood why she was enjoying the forties so much better than she
had enjoyed the thirties: it was the difference between August and
October, between the heaviness of late summer and the sparkle of
early autumn, between the ending of an old phase and the beginning
of a fresh one.</p>

<p>She reached her doorstep. The key turned sweetly in the lock.
That was the kind of thing one remembered about a house: not the
size of the rooms or the colour of the walls, but the feel of
door-handles and light-switches, the shape and texture of the
banister-rail under one's palm; minute tactual intimates, whose
resumption was the essence of coming home.</p>

<p>Upstairs in the drawing-room there was a small bright fire of
logs, yet the sunshine that flooded in through the open windows had
real warmth in it. It was perfect: she felt suspended between
summer and winter, savouring the best of them both. She unwrapped
the chrysanthemums and arranged them in a square glass jar, between
herself and the light, so that the sun shone through them. They
were the big mop-headed kind, burgundy-coloured, with curled
petals; their beauty was noble, architectural; and as for their
scent, she thought as she buried her nose in the nearest of them,
it was a pure distillation of her mood, a quintessence of all that
she found gay and intoxicating and astringent about the weather,
the circumstances, her own age and the season of the year. Oh, yes,
October certainly suited her best. For the ancients, as she had
inescapably learnt at school, it had been the eighth month;
nowadays, officially, it was the tenth: but for her it was always
the first, the real New Year. That laborious affair in January was
nothing but a name.</p>

<p>She turned away from the window at last. On her writing-table
lay the letters which had come for her that morning. A card for a
dress-show; a shooting invitation for Clem; two dinner-parties;
three sherry-parties; a highly aperitive notice of some
chamber-music concerts; and a letter from Vin at school&mdash;would
she please send on his umbrella, his camera, and his fountain-pen,
which leaked rather? (But even that could not daunt her
to-day.)</p>

<p>She rearranged the fire a little, mostly for the pleasure of
handling the fluted steel poker, and then sat down by it. Tea was
already laid: there were honey sandwiches, brandy-snaps, and small
ratafia biscuits; and there would, she knew, be crumpets. Three new
library books lay virginally on the fender-stool, their bright
paper wrappers unsullied by subscriber's hand. The clock on the
mantelpiece chimed, very softly and precisely, five times. A tug
hooted from the river. A sudden breeze brought the sharp tang of a
bonfire in at the window. The jig-saw was almost complete, but
there was still one piece missing. And then, from the other end of
the square, came the familiar sound of the Wednesday barrel-organ,
playing, with a hundred apocryphal trills and arpeggios, the "Blue
Danube" waltz. And Mrs. Miniver, with a little sigh of contentment,
rang for tea.</p>

<h2>THE NEW CAR</h2>

<p>Mrs. Miniver woke up one morning with a sense of doom, a
knowledge that the day contained something to be dreaded. It was
not a crushing weight, such as an operation, or seeing one's best
friend off to live in Tasmania; nor was it anything so light as a
committee meeting, or a deaf uncle to tea: it was a kind of
welter-weight doom.</p>

<p>At first it puzzled her. So far as she knew, she had no
appointments that day, either pleasant or unpleasant, and that in
itself was good. To be entirely at leisure for one day is to be for
one day an immortal: according to the Chinese proverb she ought to
have been feeling god-like. But the small, dull weight continued to
drag and nag.</p>

<p>Clem put his head in, dishevelled from a bath. Not for the first
time, she felt thankful that she had married a man whose face in
the ensuing sixteen years had tended to become sardonic rather than
sleek. It was difficult to tell, when people were young and their
cheek-lines were still pencilled and delible. Those beautiful long
lean young men so often filled out into stage churchwardens at
forty-five. But she had been lucky, or had a flair; Clem's good
looks were wearing well. The great thing, perhaps, was not to be
too successful too young.</p>

<p>At the moment his expression was anything but sardonic.</p>

<p>"She ought to be here by nine," he said eagerly, and
vanished.</p>

<p>Mrs. Miniver remembered with a bump, felt dismayed, knew that
her dismay was unreasonable, and tried to argue it out of
existence. A new car was a thing to be pleased over; it was high
time they had one. The old Leadbetter had got to the stage when
nothing less than an expensive overhaul would do any good; it had
developed sinister fumes, elusive noises, incurable draughts; it
was tiring for Clem on his long drives. And a week ago, when Clem,
straight from the Motor Show, had spent the whole evening musing
happily over catalogues, she had realized that the game was up. Her
usual attitude&mdash;that they didn't really need a new
car&mdash;was plainly untenable, and this time she could not even
fall back upon a plea for economy. They could perfectly well afford
it now. Clem's plans for the new building estate had gone through;
and there was the Vanderhoops' country house as well&mdash;a plum.
Besides, this scene had been replayed, with variations, many times,
and they both knew that the basis of her invariable reluctance
about new cars was not thrift but sentiment. She simply could not
endure the moment when the old one was driven away.</p>

<p>Mrs. Miniver was a fool about inanimate objects. She had once
bid furiously at an auction for a lot described as "Twelve kitchen
chairs; also a small wicker knife-basket." Clem, knowing the size
of their kitchen, made urgent signals to her across the room. She
stopped bidding, and the lot was knocked down to someone else for
more than its value by a grateful but mystified auctioneer.</p>

<p>"You got mixed up in the lot numbers, didn't you?" Clem said
afterwards.</p>

<p>"No," she said, guiltily. "I'm awfully sorry. It was that
knife-basket. I suddenly thought&mdash;so wretched not to be grand
enough to be in a lot by itself. Just tagged on to kitchen chairs
like that. Clem&mdash;a small wicker knife-basket..."</p>

<p>As for cars, they were in a class apart, somewhere between
furniture and dogs. It wasn't, with her, a question of the pathetic
fallacy. She did not pretend to herself that cars had souls or even
minds (though anybody, seeing the difference that can exist between
one mass-produced car and another, might be excused for believing
that they have at least some embryonic form of temperament). No, it
was simply a matter of <i>mise en scène</i>. A car, nowadays, was
such an integral part of one's life, provided the aural and visual
accompaniment to so many of one's thoughts, feelings,
conversations, decisions, that it had acquired at least the status
of a room in one's house. To part from it, whatever its faults, was
to lose a familiar piece of background.</p>

<p>She got up and turned on her bath. Even through the rushing of
the water she could hear the old Leadbetter coming down the square:
a garage-hand brought it round every morning just before nine. She
listened for the gear-change as it picked up speed after the
corner, then for the squeal of the brake, the stopping of the
engine, the slamming of the door, the man's footsteps receding up
the square. It was really ridiculous, she thought, to mind so much;
and gave herself an extra handful of bath-salts as a futile
antidote to woe. Almost at once there was the sound of another car
drawing up, a smooth virile purring, the discreet opening and
closing of a solid well-fitting door. Then Clem's voice in the
square and Judy's feet jigging on the pavement. It was intolerable.
Old horses one pensioned off in a paddock, where one could go and
see them occasionally. Or one even allowed them to pull the
mowing-machine in round leather boots. But this part-exchange
business&mdash;</p>

<p>Judy came racing upstairs and hammered on the door, shrill with
excitement.</p>

<p>"Mummy! The new car's come!"</p>

<p>"Lovely," called Mrs. Miniver.</p>

<p>"And I've been helping Daddy clear the maps and things out of
the old one before they drive it away."</p>

<p>Heavens, how relentlessly children dotted the i's!</p>

<p>"Run along," called Mrs. Miniver. "I'll be down quite soon."</p>

<p>She turned both the taps full on again, put thick lather of soap
over her ears, and began to sing, noisily.</p>

<h2>GUY FAWKES' DAY</h2>

<p>They didn't take the children down to Starlings much in the
winter, until the Christmas holidays. When the days were short a
week-end was scarcely worth while. They made an exception, however,
for Guy Fawkes' Day, that kindly and prescient spirit having
planned his crime to coincide&mdash;or as nearly as makes no
difference&mdash;with the autumn half-term.</p>

<p>The Miniver family had a passion for fireworks; and a fireworks
display in a small London garden is an emasculate thing, hampered
at every turn by such considerations as the neighbours, the police,
and the fragility of glass and slate. So on Saturday morning they
picked up Vin at Eton and drove across country to Starlings. Mrs.
Miniver was relieved to find that public school had not made him
too grand to enjoy playing road competitions with the two younger
children. He was, like his father, a timeless person, uninfluenced
by his own age and unconscious of other people's. Judy was quite
different. She was as typically nine now as she had been typically
six, and three. Age, to her, was an important and exciting quality:
she was never quite at ease with other children until she had asked
them how old they were. As for Toby, he remained, in this as in
most other matters, unfathomable.</p>

<p>In childhood the daylight always fails too soon&mdash;except
when there are going to be fireworks; and then the sun dawdles
intolerably on the threshold like a tedious guest. There were no
clouds that day, and even after sunset the western sky remained
obstinately full of pearl-grey light. It was not so bad for Vin,
who was helping his father to pin Catherine-wheels on to the fence
and to prop up rocket-sticks in bottles on the lawn; but Judy and
Toby, their noses pressed against the inside of the window-panes,
were rampant with impatience long before Clem decided that darkness
had officially fallen and the show could begin.</p>

<p>Swathed in coats and scarves, they went out and sat in a row on
the little flagged terrace. The evening might have been ordered
with the fireworks; it was cold, still, and starry, with a
commendable absence of moon. And when the first rocket went up Mrs.
Miniver felt the customary pricking in her throat and knew that
once again the enchantment was going to work. Some
things&mdash;conjurers, ventriloquists, pantomimes&mdash;she
enjoyed vicariously, by watching the children's enjoyment; but
fireworks had for her a direct and magical appeal. Their attraction
was more complex than that of any other form of art. They had
pattern and sequence, colour and sound, brilliance and mobility;
they had suspense, surprise, and a faint hint of danger; above all,
they had the supreme quality of transience, which puts the keenest
edge on beauty and makes it touch some spring in the heart which
more enduring excellences cannot reach.</p>

<p>It was certainly the best display they had ever had. Mrs.
Miniver herself, when buying fireworks, was apt to be led away by
fantastic titles; she would order Humming Spiders, Witches'
Cauldrons, Mines with Serpents, Bouquets of Gerbes, and Devils
among the Tailors, largely in order to see what they were like. But
Clem knew that with fireworks, as with cocktails, the sober,
familiar names usually produced the most interesting results. He
laid out a certain amount on Roman Candles, Catherine-wheels, and
Tourbillions, but for the most part he rightly concentrated on
rockets.</p>

<p>There was one bursting now, a delicate constellation of
many-coloured stars which drifted down and lingered in the still
air. Watching it, she thought that of all the arts this was the one
which showed the greatest contrast between the raw materials and
the finished work. Words, pigments, notes of music&mdash;all of
these, unmarshalled, possessed a certain beauty of their own; a
block of marble had at least an imaginable relationship with the
statue which it was to become; stone, brick, and concrete, Clem's
materials, did not seem impossibly remote from the houses which he
would make of them. But this fiery architecture, these fragments of
luminous music, these bright, dreamlike, and impermanent pictures
in the sky&mdash;what had they to do with nitre, sulphur and
charcoal, with gummed paper, cotton-wick, and a handful of mineral
salts?</p>

<p>The show was nearly over. Vin and his father were letting off
the last few rockets. Their faces, occasionally lit up, were
absorbed, triumphant, serene. Judy was shivering with cold and
excitement. Toby, his feet sticking out over the edge of the seat,
was completely immobile, but whether from profound emotion or too
many coats it was impossible to tell. As for Mrs. Miniver, she was
having a race with time. Some half-remembered words had been
haunting her all the evening, a line of poetry, perhaps, or an old
saying, something about brightness, something exquisitely
appropriate. "Brightness..." What was it? The rest of the phrase
eluded her, though she felt the rhythm of it; and she knew that she
must remember it before the fireworks were finished, or it would be
no use.</p>

<p>The final rocket went up, a really large one, a piece of
reckless extravagance. Its sibilant uprush was impressive,
dragonlike; it soared twice as high as any they had had before; and
the moment it had burst, Mrs. Miniver remembered. "Brightness falls
from the air"&mdash;that was it! The sparks from the rocket came
pouring down the sky in a slow golden cascade, vanishing one by one
into a lake of darkness.</p>

<blockquote>Beauty is but a flower<br>
Which wrinkles will devour;<br>
Brightness falls from the air;<br>
Queens have died young and fair;<br>
Dust hath closed Helen's eye&mdash;</blockquote>

<p>It was quite irrelevant, really, a lament by Nashe in time of
pestilence, nothing to do with fireworks at all. But she knew that
it was just what she had needed to round off the scene for her and
to make its memory enduring. Words were the only net to catch a
mood, the only sure weapon against oblivion.</p>

<h2>THE EVE OF THE SHOOT</h2>

<p>Every year without fail Mrs. Miniver received an invitation
written in a sloping Victorian hand on lavishly stout cream-laid.
The right-hand top corner was embossed in heavy black Gothic with
the address "Chervil Court, Crampton." On the left were three tiny
formalized sketches&mdash;a telegraph-pole, an upright telephone,
and a railway engine of the Stephenson period, stocky and
high-funnelled&mdash;followed respectively by the words, "Great
Yettingford," "Buntisley 3," and "Slape Junction." The letter began
with old Lady Chervil's unvarying formula:</p>

<blockquote>My dear Mrs. Miniver,<br>
<br>
Chervil and I shall be delighted if you and your Husband will stay
with us from Friday 19th to Monday 22nd November.</blockquote>

<p>(She would have gone to the guillotine sooner than use the
expression "week-end.")</p>

<p>Mrs. Miniver tossed the letter over to Clem. There must, he
remarked, be an air-port near there by now, and sketched in under
the other pictures a little pre-War biplane, single-engined and
very short in the wing, followed by the words, "Market Bumbleton."
There was no need for them to discuss whether they were going to
accept the invitation. They always went to Chervil. The shooting
was excellent, the food beyond praise; and it was soothing, for a
short time, to slow oneself down to the pace of its old-fashioned
ritual, and to spend three days in inverted commas.</p>

<p>"And what," said the Colonel, turning to Mrs. Miniver at dinner
on the night of their arrival, "is your opinion...?"</p>

<p>She had been afraid of this ever since, over the
<i>vol-au-vent</i>, that woman in the wrong shade of green, on
being asked whether she was coming out with the guns to-morrow, had
shut her eyes and ever so delicately shuddered: thus plunging
everybody around her into what was bound in that company to be a
tedious and unprofitable discussion. Tedious because neither side
possessed any currency but cliches, and unprofitable because it was
clear from the outset that neither side was going to budge an inch.
Besides, what a hare to start at a shooting party! You might with
as much sense and propriety get up at a Lord Mayor's banquet and
give a harangue on vegetarianism. If you felt as strongly as that,
the only thing to do was to have 'flu and stay away.</p>

<p>It raged, if such a stale controversy could be said to rage, all
through the quail, the ice-pudding, and the mushrooms on toast.
Well-worn coins rang in Mrs. Miniver's ears. "After all, the birds
get a sportin' chance..." "Animals may not have souls, but
still..." "Now take huntin'..." "Oh, bull-fightin'&mdash;that's
quite a different kettle of fish..." Italics bred italics. Dropped
g's fell as thick as confetti. Sooner or later the tide of argument
was almost certain to reach her end of the table, but she made up
her mind that she would not be drawn in. She had been through it
all too many times before, and even in circles where one could
speak freely the subject had become too hackneyed to be borne. Her
own attitude, she knew, was unethical but honest. She did not
happen to be personally squeamish, which was merely a matter of
chance. She enjoyed any display of skill; she enjoyed bare trees,
rimy pastures, breath made visible by frost, the smell of dead
leaves, and the intricate detail of winter hedgerows; above all,
she enjoyed that element of woodcraft, that sense of "playing
Indians," which games fail to supply and which the detractors of
hunting, shooting, and fishing so often mistake for bloodlust. And
although she admitted that all shooting was cruel and that all
cruelty was wrong, it seemed to her that to abolish shooting before
you had abolished war was like flicking a speck of mud off the top
of a midden.</p>

<p>For the moment the conversation on either side of her had flowed
away, leaving her on a blessed little island of peace and silence.
She had time to study the heraldic beauty of the pineapple (for
they had now reached dessert), to speculate on the second footman's
private life (he had a studious, enigmatic face and probably read
philosophy), and to reflect how unpleasing, musically, is the sound
of a pack of upper-class English voices in full cry.</p>

<p>Lady Chervil, however, was a watchful and tidy-minded hostess of
the old school, who regarded a dinner-party as a quadrille and
disapproved of islands. With a masterly verbal tweak she readjusted
the guests who had got out of step. "And what," said the Colonel,
turning to Mrs. Miniver, "is your opinion of all these blood
sports?"</p>

<p>"I think they are indefensible, but irresistible," she answered.
She had found through long experience that this remark usually
closed the subject pretty quickly. It left very little to be said.
Besides, she meant it.</p>

<p>"Ha!" said the Colonel. She noted with delight that he really
did say "Ha!" This made a valuable addition to her collection. She
had lately acquired a "Humph!" and two "Whews!" but she was still
waiting in vain for a "Pshaw!"</p>

<p>"Tell me," she said, "weren't you with an uncle of mine in
Singapore&mdash;Torquil Piggott?"</p>

<p>"Piggy!" exclaimed the Colonel, beaming gratefully, and plunged
into reminiscence. Thank God for colonels, thought Mrs. Miniver;
sweet creatures, so easily entertained, so biddably diverted from
senseless controversy into comfortable monologue: there was nothing
in the world so restful as a really good English colonel. She
nailed her smile to the mast and reverted to the pineapple and the
second footman. Clem caught her eye across the table. It seemed to
her sometimes that the most important thing about marriage was not
a home or children or a remedy against sin, but simply there being
always an eye to catch.</p>

<h2>CHRISTMAS SHOPPING</h2>

<p>One of the minor arts of life, thought Mrs. Miniver at the end
of a long day's Christmas shopping, was the conservation of energy
in the matter of swing doors. With patience and skilful timing it
was very seldom necessary to use your strength on them. You could
nearly always follow close behind some masterful person who had
already done the pushing; and if you were too late for that and the
door had begun to swing towards you, then it was well worth pausing
for a second until it swung away again and needed only a gentle
encouragement. This seemed obvious enough; but there was an
astounding number of people who seemed to glory in taking the line
of most resistance, hurling themselves against an approaching door
and reversing its direction by brute force, as though there were
virtue in the act. They must lead, she reflected, very
uncomfortable lives.</p>

<p>Placing herself neatly in the wake of a bull-necked woman in
tweeds, she slipped out of the shop. There was a raw wind; sleety
rain was beginning to fall, blurring the lamplight; the pavements
were seal-sleek; it was settling down into one of those nasty wet
evenings which the exiled Londoner longs for with a quite
unbearable nostalgia.</p>

<p>She tumbled all her parcels into the back of the car, slid,
happy but exhausted, into the driving-seat, and set off for home.
The double screen-wiper wagged companionably, uttering over and
over again the same faint wheedling word, which she could never
quite make out. It was a dissyllable, something like "receive" or
"bequeath." She was glad, at any rate, that they now had a
screen-wiper which moved at a constant speed. Their last had been
one of those which work off the induction: lively and loquacious
when you are at a standstill, sulky and slow as soon as you get
going and really need its help&mdash;like the very worst type of
human being.</p>

<p>She felt a little guilty: it was the first time she had caught
herself comparing the beloved old car unfavourably in any way with
the usurping new one.</p>

<p>Getting home was evidently going to be a long job. The usual six
o'clock home-going stream was in spate with Christmas crowds, and
Oxford Street was a solid jam. It was her own fault, she had to
admit, as she sat back and waited for the lights to change. Every
year the same thing happened. At the beginning of November she made
up her mind that this time, for once, she would get her Christmas
shopping done early. She went as far as writing out a
list&mdash;and there, for several weeks, the matter rested. At
intervals she tried to pretend that Christmas Day fell on the 5th
of December, or, alternatively, that all her friends and relations
lived in South Africa and that she had to catch an early mail; but
it was no use. The feeling of temporal urgency cannot be
artificially produced, any more than the feeling of financial
distress. The rich young man who determines to work his way round
the world may gain many things, but the experience of poverty is
not one of them. He knows that in the ultimate emergency he can
always cable home for funds; and Mrs. Miniver knew perfectly well
that Christmas was not until the 25th of December, and that all the
people on her list lived in England.</p>

<p>(The screen-wiper wagged steadily. "Sea-green...sea-green..."
Perhaps that was nearer the mark?)</p>

<p>Besides, successful present-choosing depends very largely upon
the right atmosphere, upon the contagious zest of crowds, upon
sudden inspirations and perceptions, heightened rather than
otherwise by a certain sense of pressure in space and time. To do
it cold-bloodedly, in a half-empty shop, without any difficulty or
competition, is as joyless as a marriage <i>de convenance</i>. So
perhaps it was just as well, she told herself consolingly, that she
had, as usual, left it till the middle of December.</p>

<p>("Wee Free...Wee Free..." Warmer. She'd get it yet.)</p>

<p>The lights changed. She put the car into bottom gear, paused,
then let in the clutch. It occurred to her as she did so that it
was not only people's physical reactions to those three colours
that had become automatic but their mental ones as well. Red,
yellow, green&mdash;frustration, hope, joy: a brand-new conditioned
reflex. Give it a few more years to get established, and
psychiatrists would be using coloured rays, projected in that
sequence, for the treatment of melancholia; and to future
generations green would no longer suggest envy, but freedom. In
such haphazard ways are symbolisms born and reborn.</p>

<p>At the next crossing, red again. Frustration&mdash;but somehow
one accepted it without resentment, simply because it was not
imposed by a human hand. One could be annoyed with a policeman, but
not with a tin hollyhock. The same was true of automatic
telephones: ever since the dialling system had come in the world's
output of irritation must have been halved. It was an argument for
the mechanization of life which had not previously struck her.</p>

<p>She got home at last. Clem was already in, with his legs
stretched out in front of the fire.</p>

<p>"Successful?" he asked, seeing her festooned with parcels.</p>

<p>"Look here," she said, "that screen-wiper&mdash;I think what it
says is 'Beef Tea.'"</p>

<p>"My goodness," said Clem. "I believe you're right."</p>

<h2>THREE STOCKINGS</h2>

<p>However much one groaned about it beforehand, however much one
hated making arrangements and doing up parcels and ordering several
days' meals in advance&mdash;when it actually happened Christmas
Day was always fun.</p>

<p>It began in the same way every year: the handle of her bedroom
door being turned just loudly enough to wake her up, but softly
enough not to count as waking her up on purpose; Toby glimmering
like a moth in the dark doorway, clutching a nobbly Christmas
stocking in one hand and holding up his pyjama trousers with the
other. (He insisted upon pyjamas, but he had not yet outgrown his
sleeping-suit figure.)</p>

<p>"Toby! It's only just after six. I did say not till seven."</p>

<p>"But, Mummy, I can't tell the time." He was barefoot and
shivering, and his eyes were like stars.</p>

<p>"Come here and get warm, you little goat." He was into her bed
in a flash, stocking and all. The tail of a clockwork dog scratched
her shoulder. A few moments later another head appeared round the
door, a little higher up.</p>

<p>"Judy, darling, it's too early, honestly."</p>

<p>"I know, but I heard Toby come in, so I knew you must be
awake."</p>

<p>"All right, you can come into bed, but you've got to keep quiet
for a bit. Daddy's still asleep."</p>

<p>And then a third head, higher up still, and Vin's voice, even
deeper than it had been at Long Leave.</p>

<p>"I say, are the others in here? I thought I heard them."</p>

<p>He curled himself up on the foot of his father's bed. And by
that time, of course, Clem was awake too. The old transparent
stratagem had worked to perfection once more: there was nothing for
it but to switch on the lights, shut the windows, and admit that
Christmas Day had insidiously but definitely begun.</p>

<p>The three right hands&mdash;Vin's strong and broad, Judy's thin
and flexible, Toby's still a star-fish&mdash;plunged in and out of
the three distorted stockings, until there was nothing left but the
time-hallowed tangerine in the toe. (It was curious how that
tradition lingered, even nowadays when children had a good supply
of fruit all the year round.) Their methods were as different as
their hands. Vin, with little grunts of approval, examined each
object carefully as he drew it out, exploring all its possibilities
before he went on to the next. Judy, talking the whole time, pulled
all her treasures out in a heap, took a quick glance at them and
went straight for the one she liked best&mdash;a minikin nigger
baby in a wicker cradle. Toby pulled all his out, too, but he
arranged them in a neat pattern on the eiderdown and looked at them
for a long time in complete silence. Then he picked up one of
them&mdash;a big glass marble with coloured squirls
inside&mdash;and put it by itself a little way off. After that he
played with the other toys, appreciatively enough; but from time to
time his eyes would stray towards the glass marble, as though to
make sure it was still waiting for him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Miniver watched him with a mixture of delight and
misgiving. It was her own favourite approach to life: but the
trouble was that sometimes the marble rolled away. Judy's was
safer; Vin's, on the whole, the wisest of the three.</p>

<p>To the banquet of real presents which was waiting downstairs,
covered with a red and white dust-sheet, the stocking-toys, of
course, were only an aperitif; but they had a special and exciting
quality of their own. Perhaps it was the atmosphere in which they
were opened&mdash;the chill, the black window-panes, the unfamiliar
hour; perhaps it was the powerful charm of the miniature, of toy
toys, of smallness squared; perhaps it was the sense of limitation
within a strict form, which gives to both the filler and the
emptier of a Christmas stocking something of the same enjoyment
which is experienced by the writer and the reader of a sonnet; or
perhaps it was merely that the spell of the old legend still
persisted, even though for everybody in the room except Toby the
legend itself was outworn.</p>

<p>There were cross-currents of pleasure, too: smiling glances
exchanged by her and Vin about the two younger children (she
remembered suddenly, having been an eldest child, the unsurpassable
sense of grandeur that such glances gave one); and by her and Clem,
because they were both grown-ups; and by her and Judy, because they
were both women; and by her and Toby, because they were both the
kind that leaves the glass marble till the end. The room was laced
with an invisible network of affectionate understanding.</p>

<p>This was one of the moments, thought Mrs. Miniver, which paid
off at a single stroke all the accumulations on the debit side of
parenthood: the morning sickness and the quite astonishing pain;
the pram in the passage, the cold mulish glint in the cook's eye;
the holiday nurse who had been in the best families; the pungent
white mice, the shrivelled caterpillars; the plasticine on the
door-handles, the face-flannels in the bathroom, the nameless
horrors down the crevices of armchairs; the alarms and emergencies,
the swallowed button, the inexplicable earache, the ominous rash
appearing on the eve of a journey; the school bills and the
dentists' bills; the shortened step, the tempered pace, the
emotional compromises, the divided loyalties, the adventures
continually forsworn.</p>

<p>And now Vin was eating his tangerine, pig by pig; Judy had
undressed the nigger baby and was putting on its frock again back
to front; Toby was turning the glass marble round and round against
the light, trying to count the squirls. There were sounds of
movement in the house; they were within measurable distance of the
blessed chink of early morning tea. Mrs. Miniver looked towards the
window. The dark sky had already paled a little in its frame of
cherry-pink chintz. Eternity framed in domesticity. Never mind. One
had to frame it in something, to see it at all.</p>

<h2>THE NEW ENGAGEMENT BOOK</h2>

<p>Twelfth Night was over; the decorations were down; Christmas
(which, like all extremes, dates easily) seemed as demode as a hat
in a passport photograph: and still Mrs. Miniver had not bought
herself a new engagement book, but was scribbling untidy notes on
the fly-leaf of the old one.</p>

<p>As usual, she had meant to buy one before leaving London for
Starlings; but as usual, there hadn't been time. It is a thing, she
knew, which must never be done in a hurry. An engagement book is
the most important of all those small adjuncts to life, that tribe
of humble familiars which jog along beside one from year's end to
year's end, apparently trivial, but momentous by reason of their
terrible intimacy. A sponge, a comb, a tooth-brush, a
spectacle-case, a fountain-pen&mdash;these are the things which
need to be chosen with care. They become, in time, so much a part
of one that they can scarcely be classed as inanimate. Insensitive,
certainly&mdash;but so are one's nails and hair. And although some
of them can be given away if one takes a dislike to them, with
others the only remedy is destruction; and there is no case on
record of anybody, however rich, being strong-minded enough to
throw an almost new sponge into the fire. Meekly, one puts up with
its inconvenient shape, its repulsive texture, and the cretinous
face which is discernible among its contours when it is lightly
squeezed. Eventually, thank goodness, it will wear out; or with any
luck one may leave it behind in an hotel.</p>

<p>But an engagement book, once used, is a far worse problem. To
give it away is impossible, to lose it is disastrous, and to scrap
it and start a new one entails a laborious copying out of all the
entries that have already been made. Unless, of course, one is
prepared to leave the first part of the new book blank and risk
giving one's biographers&mdash;if any&mdash;the impression that one
has suffered from a prolonged attack of leprosy. Or worse.</p>

<p>So it wasn't until well into January that Mrs. Miniver, up for
the day from Starlings to go to the dentist, found herself in a
stationer's shop with enough leisure to give the matter the
attention it deserved. She stopped in front of the rack marked
"Diaries" and prepared to enjoy herself.</p>

<p>The first book she picked up was bound in scarlet morocco.
Rather nice; but it turned out to be one of those unnatural affairs
which show two weeks at an opening. A fortnight, she always felt,
was an impossible division of time, relevant neither to God's
arrangements nor to man's. Days were the units which mattered most,
being divided from each other by the astounding phenomenon of
losing and regaining consciousness. (How brave, how trustful people
are, to dare to go to sleep!) But a day at an opening was no
good&mdash;too much for an engagement book, not enough for a real
diary. A week was what she wanted: a nice manageable chunk of time
with a beginning, a middle, and an end, containing, if desired, a
space for each of the wonders of the world, the champions of
Christendom, the deadly sins, or the colours of the rainbow.
(Monday was definitely yellow, Thursday a dull indigo, Friday
violet. About the others she didn't feel so strongly.)</p>

<p>Of the week-at-an-opening kind, there were only three left. That
was the worst of leaving it so late. One was bound in crimson
leatherette, one in brown calf, and one in green lizard-skin. She
rejected the leatherette at once. In a spasm of post-Christmas
economy, she had once bought a very cheap engagement book, and it
had annoyed her for twelve months; everything she put down in it
looked squalid. The green lizard, on the other hand, was marked
seven-and-sixpence, which seemed a fabulous price to pay. She
decided on the brown calf, at three-and-nine: a smooth, pleasant
little volume, an honest and sturdy companion for a year's march.
It would wear well; she could not possibly, she knew, take a
dislike to it. She paid, put it into her bag, left the shop and
stepped on to a No. II bus. She would catch the train back to
Starlings with twenty minutes to spare.</p>

<p>Half-way down the Pimlico Road she suddenly pressed the button
and jumped off the bus.</p>

<p>"Forgotten something," she said, smiling apologetically at the
conductor. There was no other bus in sight, so she walked back to
Sloane Square as fast as she could. At this very moment, perhaps,
the green lizard-skin diary was being bought by somebody
else&mdash;some wholly unsuitable person who merely wanted to get
one in a hurry; a rich, earnest woman who would fill it with
committee meetings, or a business man who would not even glance at
the binding when he opened it to jot down the words "Dine George."
While she herself with all her dearest activities soberly confined
in brown calf, would be thinking about it in an agony of
regret.</p>

<p>But it was still there. She produced another three-and-ninepence
and bore it away delighted. After all, the difference was very
little more than the price of a taxi. (But she had to take a taxi
to Charing Cross as well.)</p>

<p>In the train she pulled out the little green shining book and
entered in it, from memory, the few and simple appointments which
the year had so far contained. "Meet Clem, 2.27." "Pike-fishing
with Vin." "Lunch Bucklands." "Bridget for week-end." Bare and
laconic; yet those first days had been crammed, like all other
days, with feelings, ideas and discoveries. And so it would go on
until the book was complete&mdash;a skeleton map of her year, which
to anybody else's eye would convey no picture whatever of her
mental landscape. But she, glancing through it twelve months hence,
would be able to fill in many, though not all, of the details; how,
on the way out from the station, Clem had told her about the new
Gloucestershire job; how she and Vin had seen a heron; how the
Bucklands had given them home-cured gammon with pickled peaches;
and Bridget's fascinating story about her cousin, the
threepenny-bit, and the deaf chimney-sweep.</p>

<h2>THE LAST DAY OF THE HOLIDAYS</h2>

<p>The last day of the holidays dawned relentlessly wet. The last
day down at Starlings, that is, which for Vin was what counted.
Judy liked London equally well, and Toby lived in a landscape of
his own; but for Vin the twenty-four hours in London on his way
back to school were only a kind of twilight, with one foot already
in the grave. There was always some treat to mitigate it&mdash;the
circus, a theatre, or a music-hall; but even this, enjoyable as it
was, had a tinge of the macabre in its glory, like the pomps and
splendours of a funeral feast.</p>

<p>Not that he disliked school; but it had to be regarded, he
found, as another life, to be approached only by way of the Styx.
You died on the station platform, were reborn, not without pangs,
in the train, and emerged at the other end a different person, with
a different language, a different outlook, and a different scale of
values. That was what the stray grown-ups you met in the holidays
did not seem to understand when they asked you the fatuous and
invariable question, "How do you like school?" It was impossible to
answer this properly, because the person of whom they asked it
never, strictly speaking, arrived at school at all.</p>

<p>The reverse process&mdash;getting back into his home
skin&mdash;though not in the least painful, was almost as
difficult. For one thing, he had always outgrown it a little, and,
like his home clothes, it had to be adjusted. Sometimes, before it
was a comfortable fit, nearly a week had gone by; he was almost
half-way to the half-way mark&mdash;that significant water-shed
beyond which the days raced downhill in a heartless torrent.</p>

<p>However full the children packed them, however early they got
up, however late, by various ruses, they contrived to go to bed,
the holidays were always far too short. There was never time to
carry out more than three-quarters of the plans they made. Some of
these&mdash;such as building a tree-hut or exploring the
mill-stream to its source&mdash;never got started at all; others
they had to leave half done, such as the cardboard castle which had
been lurking for two years in a corner of the boxroom, roofless,
but with a practicable portcullis. Somehow it never seemed possible
to finish things like that during the next holidays. There was
always some newer craze.</p>

<p>This time their main occupation had been fitting up one of the
outhouses like the cabin of a ship, with built-in bunks, straw
palliasses, and a locker full of imaginary charts. (Vin drew the
charts, Judy painted them, and Toby put in the casual dolphins.)
But they had also made a brick-kiln in the kitchen garden and baked
in it at least a dozen quite satisfactory bricks. Not enough to
build anything with, it is true, but enough to give them a
reassuring feeling that if they were ever wrecked on a desert
island they would soon be able to run up a house or two: always
provided, of course, that the island had a clay soil. And they had
dammed the stream, and undammed it again; and watched the woodmen
cutting and splitting young chestnuts for palings; and watched the
blacksmith, and the wheelwright, and the man who came to mend the
roof; and walked over to Loddenden to have tea with Old Jane; and
had a bonfire, the day Vin caught a bream, so that they could cook
it in the embers, wrapped in wet paper.</p>

<p>For the last day they had made at least six different plans, but
they were all out-of-door ones and it was obvious that they would
all have to be abandoned. The sky was black and sagging, like an
old tarpaulin. A big cross-channel plane was labouring unsteadily
southward against the gale, flying so low that it looked as though
it would barely clear the chimneys. Below the high wooded ridge on
which their house stood the green and silver network of the Marsh
lay blurred with rain, its dikes swollen and many of its pastures
already merged in flood.</p>

<p>It had evidently got to be an indoor day. And because it was the
last one they took turns, in order of age, at choosing what to do.
Clem, who came first, chose darts; they played Round the Clock, and
Nannie, as usual, won. Mrs. Miniver chose Letter Bags (a game which
is to all other letter-games as dry-fly fishing is to a string and
a bent pin). Nannie, most popularly, chose toffee-making on the
nursery fire; and by the time that was set aside in biscuit-tin
lids to cool, lunch was ready.</p>

<p>Afterwards they took another look at the weather. It was quite
hopeless. The wind, no longer squally, had risen to a steady roar.
The trees were straining, the lawn sodden, the Marsh completely
blotted out. Vin chose charades, and Judy said she had been going
to choose dressing up, so they combined the two; and that, of
course, lasted them easily till tea-time.</p>

<p>Next it was Toby's turn. But all he wanted, apparently, and he
wanted it with a consuming urgency, was to be left alone in a
corner with eight elastic bands and an old photograph frame: he
said he had had a good idea at tea. So the rest of them had a
concert, with Clem at the piano. They sang "Camptown Races" and
"The Ash Grove" and "Rolling Down to Rio" and "Alfonso Spagoni" and
"Cockles and Mussels" and "A Bicycle Made for Two." They were going
to sing "Home, Sweet Home," but Vin suggested that it ought to be
pronounced "Hume, Sweet Hume," like the surname; and after that,
because they were just in the right mood for silly jokes, they
laughed too much to be able to sing it at all, so the concert came
to an end.</p>

<p>So far as they knew, Toby had been paying no attention. But when
the noise of their own laughter had died away they became aware of
a small reedy voice singing in the far corner, accompanied by a
confused twangling sound. It was Toby, blissfully sweeping the
strings of his good idea.</p>

<p>"'Carry me hume'" (he sang) "'to Old Virginny...' Tck! That end
band's come loose again."</p>

<p>When the two younger ones had been taken off to bed, Vin went to
the window and peered out at the dripping garden. The rain had
stopped at last; a few torn clouds were racing past in a clear
moonlit sky. But it was too late now. The holidays were over.</p>

<h2>IN SEARCH OF A CHARWOMAN</h2>

<p>About once a year Clem rather ruefully suggested, and Mrs.
Miniver reluctantly agreed, that it was about time they asked the
Lane-Pontifexes to dinner.</p>

<p>There was nothing really the matter with the Lane-Pontifexes.
They were quite nice, intelligent, decent people; she was
personable, and he was well-informed: yet for some mysterious
reason one's heart sank. Their company, as Clem said, was a
continual shutting of windows. They asked the Minivers to dinner
about every two months; it was impossible, without being churlish,
to get out of it more than three times running; and eventually, of
course, they had to be asked in return. This acquaintanceship had
lasted, neither waxing nor waning, for nearly ten years, and there
seemed to be no particular reason why it should ever come to an
end. Clem said it was part of the white man's burden.</p>

<p>Undiluted Lane-Pontifex was not to be thought of, so they
generally made it an excuse for asking as many people as their
dining-room table would hold, and that meant getting Mrs. Jackman
in to help with the washing-up. On the morning of the dinner-party
Mrs. Jackman sent a message to say that she couldn't come after
all, as her mother was queer. So Mrs. Miniver, fervently wishing
that the queerness of Mrs. Jackman's mother had not happened to
coincide with the imminence of the Lane-Pontifexes, set off in
search of a substitute.</p>

<p>She crossed the King's Road, turned up Skelton Street (which is
not one of the streets that Chelsea shows to American visitors),
and approached the towering red-brick jungle which is known as "the
Buildings." Among the branches of this forest, theoretically at any
rate, desirable and efficient charwomen hang in ripe clusters for
the plucking; but the plucking is not so simple. The architectural
style of the Buildings is Late Victorian Philanthropic. Each clump
is named after a different benefactor, and each block in each clump
is distinguished by a large capital letter. Mrs. Miniver entered
the maze by the nearest gateway and then hesitated. She had heard
of Mrs. Burchett through a friend, and she thought her address was
No. 23 Platt's Dwellings; but she had reckoned without the
alphabetical factor. She tried No. 23 in D Block, which happened to
be near at hand, and after that she tried No. 23 in Blocks E, F,
and G. But either the inhabitants genuinely did not know Mrs.
Burchett's address, or else some esoteric code forbade them to
reveal it. No. 23 was in every case on the fourth floor; and as she
climbed up the steep stone stairs of Block H Mrs. Miniver felt
inclined, quite unfairly, to blame the whole business on to the
Lane-Pontifexes.</p>

<p>This time, however, she was more successful. A large, neat,
cheerful woman came to the door, with her hair piled up on the top
of her head like a whipped cream walnut. Obviously a pearl among
charwomen&mdash;a capable pearl. Yes, she was Mrs. Burchett. Yes,
she had often worked for Miss Ducane, and was glad that Miss Ducane
had recommended her. Yes, she would certainly come along this
evening and give a hand.</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth," she added with gusto, "I was just
wishing summing like this would turn up. Not that I need to do
cleaning at present, really, Burchett and the boys all being in
work. In fact, my son Len, 'e says I've no business to go out to
work at all, when there's others wanting it more. But there&mdash;I
don't know whatever I should do if I didn't. Every now and then I
just feel I've got to 'ave a bit of a fling." She tossed the
whipped cream walnut so that it quivered. "Of course, charing...I
suppose it's on'y like clearing up somebody else's mess instead of
your own, but it does make a change, and you do get a bit of
company. Burchett, 'e says, 'You let 'er go, Len, and never mind
the rights and wrongs. Coop 'er up too long, she gets 'ipped. And
goodness knows,' 'e says, 'when your mother gets 'ipped there's no
peace for any of us till she's worked it off summow.'"</p>

<p>She gave a large, good-humoured laugh. Mrs. Miniver liked her
more and more, recognizing in her that most endearing of qualities,
an abundant zest for life. It was rare, that zest, and it bore no
relation to age, class, creed, moral worth, or intellectual
ability. It was an accidental gift, like blue eyes or a
double-jointed thumb: impossible to acquire, and almost impossible,
thank heaven, to lose. To be completely without it was the worst
lack of all&mdash;and it dawned on her in a flash that that was
what was the matter with the Lane-Pontifexes.</p>

<p>"You'll come at seven, then?"</p>

<p>"I shan't be late," said Mrs. Burchett, beaming reliably. It was
evident that in spirit her sleeves were already rolled up.</p>

<p>Threading her way back between the serried barrows of Skelton
Street, Mrs. Miniver asked herself which of them was
right&mdash;Burchett or Len. Economically, Len, of course. But
psychologically, Burchett: for pent-up volcanoes can do almost as
much harm in the world as empty purses.</p>

<p>On the hall table there was a telephone message. Mr. and Mrs.
Lane-Pontifex were extremely sorry, but they had both gone down
with 'flu. Mrs. Miniver's heart gave a leap, and she immediately
felt ashamed of herself. As an act of penitence she went out to the
flower shop and sent the Lane-Pontifexes a big bunch of jonquils
and a note. But nothing could undo the leap; and as she walked home
for the second time, she reflected what possibilities the evening
now held; how many lovely people there were from among whom they
could fill the two empty places&mdash;people whom they really
wanted to see, who were merry or wise or comforting or revealing,
whose presence either heartened the spirit or kindled the mind;
people who opened windows instead of shutting them. And she
reflected, also, how many of the most enjoyable parties were
achieved by taking away the number you first thought of.</p>

<h2>THE FIRST DAY OF SPRING</h2>

<p>It was a Wedgwood day, with white clouds delicately modelled in
relief against a sky of pale pure blue. The best of England,
thought Mrs. Miniver, as opposed to countries with reasonable
climates, is that it is not only once a year that you can say,
"This is the first day of spring." She had already said it twice
since Christmas&mdash;once in January, when they had driven across
the Marsh to the sea and it had been warm enough to lie on the sand
without a coat; and once in February, when she had taken the
children for a lunch picnic in Kensington Gardens. The grass had
been scattered with twigs from the previous night's gale, and by
the next afternoon it was snowing: but while it lasted that day had
been part of the authentic currency of spring&mdash;a stray coin
tossed down carelessly on account.</p>

<p>But this time, she thought (though she knew quite well that one
said that every time), it really was spring. On her way downstairs
she paused in the drawing-room to look at the plane branches which
she had picked up on the Embankment when the men were lopping the
trees. She did this every year, but she could never quite believe
her eyes when they actually burst into bud. It seemed impossible
that those neat emerald bobbles, those velvety, milky-green leaves,
should have been implicit in the soot-black sticks&mdash;so much
deader-looking than the polished brown twigs of the
countryside&mdash;which she had brought in a month ago. She bent
closer to look at one of the newest leaves (it was soft and
half-spread, like a little pointed paw), got a cloud of yellow
pollen from the flowers on to her nose, and went downstairs
sneezing.</p>

<p>Outside the air was delicious. She could feel it stroking her
face as she moved through it, but there was no sensation of either
warmth or chill. Walking towards Westminster (she was going to meet
Clem for lunch near his office), she wondered why she found this
particular temperature so charming; and decided that it was
because, on a day like this, she came nearer than usual to losing
her sense of separate identity. Extremes of heat and cold she
enjoyed too, but it was with a tense, belligerent enjoyment. When
they beat against the irregular frontiers of the skin, with all its
weak angles and vulnerable salients, they made her acutely
conscious of her own boundaries in space. Here, she would find
herself thinking, is where I end and the outside world begins. It
was exciting, but divisive: it made for loneliness. But on certain
days, and this was one of them, the barriers were down. She felt as
though she and the outside world could mingle and interpenetrate;
as though she was not entirely contained in her own body but was
part also of every other person in the street; and, for that
matter, of the thrush singing on a tree in Eaton Square, the roan
dray-horse straining to take up the load at Grosvenor Place, the
cat stepping delicately across Buckingham Palace Road. This was the
real meaning of peace&mdash;not mere absence of division, but an
active consciousness of unity, of being one of the mountain-peak
islands on a submerged continent.</p>

<p>Just beyond the entrance to the royal stables she became aware
that she was walking behind, and gradually overtaking, a small,
ragged boy. He was about Toby's size, but probably older. His
shorts, even though they had been hauled well up under his armpits,
were still far too long for him, and they had a big cobbled patch
on the seat; his grey jersey was dirty, skimpy, and threadbare; his
legs were spindly, his hair mouse-coloured and closely cropped. He
was not an attractive urchin: but what caught her eye were his
accoutrements. He wore a sword made out of two pieces of broken
lath, hung round his middle with string; his helmet was a brown
paper bag with a pigeon's feather stuck through it and "Brooks's
Stores" printed on it upside-down; and on his left arm he carried a
home-made cardboard shield. His step was jaunty yet purposeful, as
though he was setting off on some secret campaign in which he was
confident of victory. (There were dragons in St. James's Park, she
knew, for those who needed them: she had lived near it herself as a
child.)</p>

<p>By the time he reached the front gates of the Palace she had
drawn almost level with him: she could see that the shield was
roughly coloured with red chalk and tied to his arm with a
boot-lace. She was about to pass him when he caught sight of
another urchin, similarly equipped, on the opposite pavement. It
was evidently going to be a combined expedition. He gave a shrill
yell of greeting and stepped off the kerb.</p>

<p>"Look out!" cried Mrs. Miniver, grabbing him by the shoulder. A
taxi swerved with screaming brakes and avoided him by perhaps an
inch. But the boy was unimpressed.</p>

<p>"I'm awright," he protested impatiently; shook himself free, and
dashed out again into the road. Mrs. Miniver watched him till he
got safely over to the other side. Then she discovered that her
knees were trembling and that she felt extremely sick. Behind her
the sentries stamped and strode, met, turned, and parted, carrying
out with beautiful precision their antique ritual. Sentries and
cardboard shields: parallel gestures, it seemed, in a world of
bombing planes and motor traffic. But perhaps the making of the
gesture was what mattered.</p>

<p>She pulled herself together and walked on. The water, a bright
translucent curve, flowed steadily into the marble basin; the
tritons, nereids, and dolphins gambolled along the frieze; the
symbolic bronze statues held, a trifle sententiously, their heroic
poses; and high above them all the gilt Queen sat calmly in the

<h2>ON HAMPSTEAD HEATH</h2>

<p>They went away nearly every week-end, either to Starlings or to
other people's houses, but about once a month they made a point of
staying in London. On Saturday afternoon they would drive down to
see Vin at school, and on Sunday the two younger children would
take it in turns to choose a treat. This time it was Toby's turn,
and he chose Hampstead Heath because he wanted to sail his boat on
the pond. Judy wasn't particularly keen on boats, but her favourite
doll Christabel had a new spring coat and she was quite glad of a
chance to take her out in it.</p>

<p>It was a clear, clean, nonchalant kind of day, with a billowy
south wind. The scene round the pond, as they burst upon it
suddenly up the hill, would have made an admirable opening for a
ballet&mdash;a kind of English Petrouchka or Beau Danube. The blue
pond, the white sails, the children in their Sunday clothes, the
strolling grown-ups, the gambolling dogs, the ice-cream men
(hatched out prematurely by the unseasonable heat) tinkling slowly
round on their box-tricycles&mdash;it all had an air of having been
rehearsed up to a perfection of spontaneity. The choreography was
excellent, the decor charming: it remained to be seen whether any
theme would develop.</p>

<p>When they got out of the car Toby discovered that he had left
the key of his motor-boat at home. It was much too late to go back,
of course: there was nothing to be done except wait and see how he
would take it. One never knew, when setting out to comfort Toby,
whether to prepare first aid for a pinprick or a broken heart. He
was not yet old enough to be able to grade his own misfortunes: it
is one of the maturer accomplishments. Fortunately he was in a
philosophical mood. He just said: "oh, well, we can watch the
others," and trotted off to the pond with Clem, his feet beating
crotchets against his father's minims.</p>

<p>Mrs. Miniver found a deck-chair and sat down in the sun. Judy
walked about, carrying Christabel rather ostentatiously so that
people could see her new coat. It was really magnificent&mdash;pale
yellow tweed with a brown velvet collar and brown buttons. Watching
her, Mrs. Miniver wondered whether the modern unbreakable dolls,
which lasted for years, were more, or less, precious to their
owners than the old china ones, whose expectation of life had been
a matter of months. The old ones had had the agonizing charm of
transience: the modern ones held the promise of a reliable and
enduring companionship&mdash;you could make plans for their future,
think out their next winter's wardrobe. But it was a silly problem,
after all. For love is no actuary: and a new-born baby was probably
neither more, nor less, treasured three hundred years ago than it
is now, in spite of all our statistics about infant mortality.</p>

<p>The sun was getting quite hot. From where she sat Mrs. Miniver
could see two street orators setting up their flimsy platforms and
angling for an audience. Judging by their clothes and general
demeanour she guessed that the one on the right was Left-wing and
the one on the left Right-wing: but she was too far away to read
the wording on their notice boards, and when they began to speak
nothing reached her except a confused gabble, like a mix-up of
stations on the wireless. Seeing Clem and Toby leave the pond and
walk over towards the speakers, she collected Judy and joined them.
As soon as she got near she found that her guess had been wrong:
the right-hand speaker was extreme Right and the left extreme Left.
But how many of their audience, she wondered, would have noticed if
they had got up behind the wrong placards by mistake?</p>

<p>It was hard to take in the sense of what the speakers were
saying, so confusing was the double clamour. But one thing was
certain, that the fabric of both speeches was shot through and
through with the steely tinsel of war. "To combat the forces of
tyranny..." one of them ranted. "To crush down the menace of
revolution..." mouthed the other just as glibly. "Is any sacrifice
too great...?" "Which of us would not willingly lay down...?"</p>

<p>And now, from somewhere behind them, came the sound of a third
voice, so shrill, reedy and raucous that it made itself heard even
through the babel nearer at hand. It seemed only half human, and
for a moment Mrs. Miniver had a sense of nightmare; but as soon as
she realized what it was she grabbed Clem by the arm. "Come on!"
she said. "There's a Punch and Judy!" Clem's face lit up. He
hoisted Toby on to his shoulder and they all four edged their way
out of the crowd.</p>

<p>The rest of the morning was pure bliss. For over an hour they
stood, absorbed, while the immortal melodrama unfolded itself
before their eyes. The proscenium was shabby, the properties crude,
the puppets battered almost featureless by the years of savage
slapstick they had undergone: but the performance was superb. The
baby yelled and was flung out of the window; Judy scolded and was
bludgeoned to death; the beadle, the doctor, and the hangman tried
in turn to perform their professional duties and were outrageously
thwarted; Punch, cunning, violent and unscrupulous, with no virtues
whatever except humour and vitality, came out triumphant in the
end. And all the children, their faces upturned in the sun like a
bed of pink daisies, laughed and clapped and shouted with
delight.</p>

<p>"So what?" said Mrs. Miniver at the end, to Clem.</p>

<p>"So nothing," said Clem, shrugging his shoulders. "It's great
art, that's all. Come on, I'm hungry."</p>

<h2>A COUNTRY HOUSE VISIT</h2>

<p>They went to Cornwall for Easter, to stay with the Edward
Havelocks.</p>

<p>People who didn't know Mrs. Miniver very well, and even some of
those who did, would have found it difficult to believe what a
feeling of leaden oppression always came over her during the last
few miles of the approach to a strange country house visit. If they
were arriving in their own car she could comment on it
half-jokingly to Clem, which helped to dispel it: but if, as now,
they had come by train and been met at the station, she could only
watch the back of the chauffeur's neck in dumb dismay, or at the
most make some cryptic reference to her state of mind.</p>

<p>"These modern tumbrils are so fast," she said in an agonized
murmur to Clem as the car swept them all too rapidly towards
Penzarron.</p>

<p>"Look!" said Clem. "More standing stones. This place must have
been stiff with Druids." He was not unfeeling, but he thought,
quite rightly, that she ought to have grown out of this by now.
Also he knew that her panic would disappear the moment she set foot
in the house, and that she would most likely end by enjoying
herself. Mrs. Miniver knew all this, too, in her mind, but she
could never quite succeed in transferring the knowledge to the pit
of her stomach.</p>

<p>It wasn't shyness: she had never experienced that. She got on
easily with strangers, and there were few things she enjoyed more
than that first tentative groping among wave-lengths,
followed&mdash;if you were unlucky&mdash;by a Talk on Accountancy,
but far more often, thank heaven, by a burst of music. No, it
wasn't shyness. It was more like a form of claustrophobia&mdash;a
dread of exchanging the freedom of her own self-imposed routine for
the inescapable burden of somebody else's. She must be prepared to
adjust herself all day to an alien tempo: to go out, to come in, to
go to bed, to sit, to stride, to potter (oh! worst of all, to
potter), whenever her hostess gave the hint. There was always a
chance, of course, that the Havelocks' tempo might turn out to be
the same as her own: that they might hate sitting long over meals;
walk quickly or not at all; enjoy arguments, jokes, and silences,
but detest making conversation; and realize that a day without a
chunk or two of solitude in it is like a cocktail without ice.</p>

<p>There was certainly a chance: but at moments like this it seemed
a very remote one. They had come out on to the coast road now, and
Cornwall was out-postering itself, as usual, with rocky headlands
and sandy coves and fishing villages that spilled themselves down
the cliff face like cascades of mesembryanthemum. The year was
older here: the oak-woods were rounded, cushiony and mustard-gold,
the grass under the fruit trees was already scattered with petals,
the cottage gardens were little glowing squares of rich embroidery.
It was being a lavishly lovely spring, almost frightening in its
perfection, as though for some reason it was meant to be a final
performance. "Positively the last appearance on any stage..." She
suggested this to Clem, wondering whether by any chance it had
struck him, too.</p>

<p>"But that's what I feel every spring," said Clem unexpectedly.
And I've known him through seventeen of them, thought Mrs. Miniver,
without knowing that. But it was quite natural really: she had long
ago discovered that whereas words, for her, clarified feelings, for
Clem, on the whole, they obscured them. This was perhaps just as
well. For if they had both been equally explicit they might have
been in danger of understanding each other completely; and a
certain degree of un-understanding (not mis-, but un-) is the only
possible sanctuary which one human being can offer to another in
the midst of the devastating intimacy of a happy marriage.</p>

<p>She saw every relationship as a pair of intersecting circles.
The more they intersected, it would seem at first glance, the
better the relationship; but this is not so. Beyond a certain point
the law of diminishing returns sets in, and there aren't enough
private resources left on either side to enrich the life that is
shared. Probably perfection is reached when the area of the two
outer crescents, added together, is exactly equal to that of the
leaf-shaped piece in the middle. On paper there must be some neat
mathematical formula for arriving at this: in life, none. She
breathed surreptitiously on the window of the car and drew two
circles with her finger; but they hardly intersected at all&mdash;a
mere moonlight infatuation which would soon peter out&mdash;so she
added ears and whiskers and turned them into Siamese-twin cats.
(But would that count, she wondered, as being Siamese cats?) Then
she met the chauffeur's eye in the driving-mirror and hurriedly
rubbed the whole thing out, pretending to peer at the view.</p>

<p>"But it's all right," said Clem, pursuing his own train of
thought. "She always decides to stage another come-back."</p>

<p>"Who? Oh&mdash;spring. Yes." But she could not respond with much
gaiety, for they were actually turning in at the gates of
Penzarron. This was the worst moment of all. There was no escape
now. In four days' time, she told herself, they would be on their
way back to London, having probably made several new friends: but
somehow this was no comfort to her at all. At any rate, she
thought, clinging to a straw, she had just bought herself a really
grand dressing-gown, the kind one always caught glimpses of,
exquisitely laid out, through other women's bedroom doors. The
vision of it sustained her all the way up the drive between the
mountainous rhododendron combers which never quite broke on top of
the car.</p>

<p>And all of a sudden the ordeal was over, and they had arrived,
and Leila Havelock was introducing them to their fellow-guests; and
the tuning-knobs were turning, turning, in broad preliminary arcs,
ready for more delicate adjustment as soon as the first faint
throbbing of music should beat upon the ear.</p>

<h2>MRS. DOWNCE</h2>

<p>The first week-end after the school holidays were over, the
Minivers kept away from Starlings, so as to let Mrs. Downce give
the house a thorough turning out. By the time they went down again
it was well into May. A noticeable change had come over the
countryside: it had lost the coltish uncertain grace of spring and
taken on a more poised, though still virginal, loveliness.</p>

<p>As soon as Mrs. Downce appeared at the door Mrs. Miniver knew,
with that morbid sensitiveness to emotional atmosphere which is
common to lovers and housewives, that something was amiss. She was
not sure which of the two possible types of bad weather the omens
portended&mdash;the subjective (or dudgeonly) or the objective (or
catastrophic). On the whole, knowing that it couldn't be anything
to do with the children, she hoped that it would turn out to be the
latter. Burst water-mains were so much easier to deal with than
injured feelings. But mightn't it, after all, be something to do
with the children? There might have been a telephone message while
they were on their way down&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is everything all right?" she asked in a casual voice, pulling
off her gloves.</p>

<p>"Well, no, madam, I'm afraid I couldn't hardly say that." Mrs.
Downce paused ominously.</p>

<p>("Oh, come on, you old fool, don't keep me on tenterhooks like
this&mdash;which of them is it? Toby? Judy? Vin?) I'm sorry to hear
that. What's happened?"</p>

<p>"Well, madam, there's nothing what you could call happened, it's
just there's a norrible smell."</p>

<p>Mrs. Miniver nearly laughed out loud with relief.</p>

<p>"Smell? Where?"</p>

<p>"Everywhere, madam. All over the back part of the house, that
is. A norrible smell."</p>

<p>Mrs. Miniver crossed the hall, opened the door which led to the
kitchen premises, and shut it again very quickly.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" she said. "It's unspeakable."</p>

<p>Mrs. Downce's face bore the triumphant look peculiar to those
who, suspected of hyperbole, are found to have been employing
meiosis.</p>

<p>"Downce thinks it's the drains. His mother died of typhoid."</p>

<p>Clem came in from putting away the car.</p>

<p>"Look here, Clem, you ought to know&mdash;is this drains, or
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I'm an architect," said Clem, "not a sanitary inspector. Still,
I'll have a sniff&mdash;oh, Lord!" He, too, shut the passage door,
appalled.</p>

<p>"Me and Downce have been sitting in the library, sir, and
cooking on a spirit lamp. We thought you wouldn't mind."</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Clem. "But why on earth didn't you get in
a plumber?"</p>

<p>"We thought at first it might go off," Mrs. Downce explained.
"But when it got too bad we did ring up Mr. Bateman. But that's
three days ago now&mdash;he's putting in a new bathroom up at the
Hall, and you know what the tradesmen are like down here when
they're busy. Independent. They don't care who gets typhoid." She
was a Cockney, but had married into Kent; and the last twenty-five
years had only strengthened her conviction that anywhere outside
London was virtually Central Africa.</p>

<p>"Nobody's going to get typhoid," said Clem impatiently, striding
over to the telephone.</p>

<p>"It's Saturday afternoon, sir," Mrs. Downce reminded him with
melancholy relish. "You won't get nobody now till Monday."</p>

<p>"Come on," said Mrs. Miniver, in whom curiosity had at last
overcome squeamishness. "Let's try and find out what it is. It may
not be drains at all. It may be a dead rat under the floor."</p>

<p>"Bore like a dead sheep," said Clem, as, holding their noses,
they proceeded down the kitchen passage.</p>

<p>"Bore like a dead babboth," said Mrs. Miniver. They tracked the
smell past the kitchen, scullery, and larder, until they came to
the small wash-place and cloakroom just inside the garden door,
where it seemed to be at its worst.</p>

<p>"I suppose that beads it bust be draids," said Mrs. Miniver. But
Clem, after looking round suspiciously among the litter of
waterproofs, walking-sticks, nets, rods, and golf-clubs, took down
Vin's fishing haversack from a hook on the wall.</p>

<p>"Bait," he said briefly. "Dab the boy." They carried the
haversack out into the garden and emptied it. Among the floats,
leads, and other paraphernalia there were two tins. The first
contained earthworms, the second lugworms, both in an indescribable
state.</p>

<p>"Really," said Mrs. Miniver, "this is a bit much. Such waste,
too," she added. "I helped him dig those lugworms the day we went
over to Dungeness. They took us nearly two hours to get."</p>

<p>Clem's face was grim. He got a spade from the tool-shed and
buried the bait very deep in the kitchen garden. Then he went
indoors and wrote a letter to Vin. From the time it took, and the
look of his shoulder-blades, Mrs. Miniver was afraid that for once
in a way he was being over-stern; but when he leant back in his
chair to re-read the letter she saw that it was profusely
illustrated down the margin with his own particular brand of
pin-man picture: so she knew it was all right. And Mrs. Downce, as
she brought in the tea, remarked amiably and with an air of
discovery that boys would be boys. Mrs. Miniver breathed more
freely. The trough of low pressure was already over: it was going
to be a fine week-end.</p>

<h2>MARRIED COUPLES</h2>

<p>"We might get the Danbys," said Mrs. Miniver, looking through
her address-book over early morning tea. Clem's father had just
sent them a salmon, and it seemed a good opportunity to ask a few
people to dinner.</p>

<p>"We-ell," said Clem, "I'd love to have Nigel, but I don't feel
like coping with Helen. She yatters."</p>

<p>"What about the Pritchards?"</p>

<p>"There again," said Clem. "Only the other way round. It would be
grand to see Sara again, but Clive'll talk nothing but shop. It's
too hot for Clive. Look&mdash;I must go and shave. Call out if you
get any other ideas."</p>

<p>Mrs. Miniver put down the address-book and poured out some more
tea. As she did so her eye fell on an article in the newspaper
which Clem had just thrown aside. "Problems of Marriage," ran the
title. She glanced through the first paragraph.</p>

<p>"I am not setting out to decry marriage. Nobody pretends that it
is a perfect institution, but nobody has yet suggested a better
one. At the worst it is seldom quite beyond repair: at the best it
can be delightful. Most married people are neither more nor less
happy than they would have been if they had remained single. They
may not be able to go round the world on a tramp steamer: but there
is not that start in the evening when the coal falls out of the
grate."</p>

<p>Good of its kind, she thought; written, at any rate, with more
restraint and a lighter touch than most articles on that well-worn
subject: though, like all the rest of them, it bristled with
three-quarter truths. She would finish reading it later, when she
had settled the dinner question.</p>

<p>She applied herself again to the address-book. The Frants? The
Palmers? Really, it was lamentable, the unevenness of most married
couples. Like those gramophone records with a superb tune on one
side and a negligible fill-up on the other which you had to take
whether you wanted it or not. Only in this case you could not
simply ignore the vapid backing, but were forced to play it through
to the bitter end exactly the same number of times as the side
which you treasured. How silly it was, this
convention&mdash;relaxed a little nowadays but still surprisingly
obstinate&mdash;that you must not invite one half of a married
couple to dinner without the other. Even when both were equally
charming, she often wished she could ask them on different days.
For in order that the game of dinner-table conversation may be
played to its best advantage, it is essential that every player
should have a free hand. He must be at liberty to assume disguises,
to balance precariously in untenable positions, to sacrifice the
letter of the truth to the spirit of it. And somehow the partner's
presence makes this difficult. She does not, if she is civilized,
chip in with "No, darling, it was Tuesday"; but she is apt to
crumble the bread, and to have a look in her eye. The pronouns, of
course, can be reversed, thought Mrs. Miniver hastily, remembering
Clive and Sara.</p>

<p>"Any luck?" said Clem, reappearing.</p>

<p>"No, none whatever. All the couples we owe dinners to are
hopelessly lopsided."</p>

<p>"I wish to goodness," said Clem, "we were as brave as old Lady
J. She simply asks all the nice halves to one party and all the
boaks to another."</p>

<p>"I know. And as often as not she has a cold and cancels the boak
party at the last minute. But anyway, old Lady J.'s a Character.
You can't do that sort of thing unless you're a Character."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, better ask both lots, and then you can talk to Nigel,
and I can talk to Sara, and Helen and Clive can go into a boakish
huddle."</p>

<p>"All right," said Mrs. Miniver, shutting up the address-book
with relief. But why, oh why, she wondered, do writers of articles
on marriage always confine themselves to the difficulties which it
presents to those who are actually involved in it, and never
mention the problems which it raises for their friends? To
everybody except the protagonists, she thought for the thousandth
time, marriage is nothing but a nuisance. A single person is a
manageable entity, whom you can either make friends with or leave
alone. But half of a married couple is not exactly a whole human
being: if the marriage is successful it is something a little more
than that; if unsuccessful, a little less. In either case, a fresh
complication is added to the already intricate 'business of
friendship: as Clem had once remarked, you might as well try to
dance a tarantella with a Siamese twin.</p>

<p>That had been years ago, before they were married; but the
phrase had stuck, and to avoid, so far as their friendships were
concerned, turning into Siamese twins had been one of their private
marriage vows. How well, she wondered, had they kept it? Only their
friends could judge: but even to have been aware of the danger was
something.</p>

<h2>A DRIVE TO SCOTLAND</h2>

<p>Although they had driven up to Scotland every summer for fifteen
years, they still felt a little stab of excitement when they came
to the signpost at the top of Finchley Road which pointed to the
left and simply said "The North." It made a kind of chapter-heading
to their holiday.</p>

<p>They always started at seven after an early breakfast and shared
the driving between them, changing over every fifty miles or so.
This year it had been Clem's turn to take the wheel first, of which
Mrs. Miniver was rather glad. It meant that during the dreary flat
expanse between Biggleswade and Stamford she would be pleasantly
preoccupied with driving, whereas she would be free, as passenger,
to look about her at the beauty of the next stretch, which lay
along the eastern fringe of the Dukeries. It was an ample, rolling,
opulent beauty; Georgian, somehow, with a suggestion of
full-bottomed wigs and old port. A trifle oppressive to live with,
perhaps: but, as a rich dark-green tapestry drawn smoothly and
swiftly past one, very satisfying. At Retford they changed places
again. This landed Mrs. Miniver with Doncaster, the only big town
on the whole route; but after that she had an easy drive across the
Plain of York to Boroughbridge, where they stopped for lunch. The
great point was that Clem now came in for Leeming Lane, a fast
fifteen-mile stretch, as straight as an arrow, which he loved and
could do justice to: while she herself could sit back, enjoying the
speed but thankful that she wasn't at the wheel.</p>

<p>At Scotch Corner they swung off to the left towards Bowes; and
this, they always felt, was where "The North" really began,
spiritually if not geographically. For they were out of the plain
at last and climbing up into a completely different country, a
country of small steep tumbled fields, rough stone walls, crying
sheep, skirling plover, and lonely farm-houses sheltered by clumps
of sycamore.</p>

<p>"This," said Clem as they topped a rise, "is where we passed
those gipsies two years ago."</p>

<p>"I know," said Mrs. Miniver. "I was just thinking that. With the
skewbald horse." It was amazing, the number of little memory-flags
with which, on their minds' map, the road was studded. There were
dozens of them now, and every year added a few more. There was one,
for instance, near Colsterworth, where their first car (a
two-cylinder roller-skate with overhead valves and partially
exposed viscera, very sweet and willing but extremely second-hand)
had dropped a push-rod; which, after a long search, they had
recovered from the gutter a quarter of a mile behind. And there was
another flag at the point where their third car (a meretricious
black beast of an obscure continental make, the only really
disloyal one they had ever owned) had venomously run a big end,
stranding them for fourteen hours at a tin garage by the roadside.
It had rained nearly the whole day; they had played countless games
of piquet on the top of a packing-case, and Clem had scored repique
and capot twice running. There were flags, too, at all the places
where they had ever stopped to picnic; and one at the place where
they had seen a particularly fine double rainbow; and one at the
place where, after rounding a sharp bend, they had come upon a man
in a stationary car hurriedly removing his false black beard. An
enigmatic flag, that, five years old. They had, of course, lurked
in the next side-turning to let him pass, and then trailed him for
miles; but he took the Rotherham fork at Barnby Moor, so they never
discovered whether what they had seen was the aftermath of a
practical joke or part of a real-life Buchan.</p>

<p>They were climbing steadily now; and presently the bones of the
earth began breaking through the grass in rocky scars and outcrops;
and higher still there were no fields at all, but only bare moors.
At the summit of the road, half-way between Bowes and Brough, they
stopped, according to their invariable custom, and got out to
stretch, smoke, and enjoy the view. They were standing on the spine
of England, nearly fifteen hundred feet above the sea. Yorkshire
lay behind, Westmorland in front; Hunderthwaite Moor and Teesdale
to the north of them, Stainmore Forest and Arkengarthdale to the
south. The silence, after the monotonous hum of the car, was almost
startling. The air was knife-keen and as fresh as lettuce. It
seemed a far cry from the lush, matronly, full-blown landscape of
the south through which they had set out that morning. Moving
northward in space, thought Mrs. Miniver, they had moved backward
in time; reversed the irreversible, recaptured in late summer the
feeling of spring. By what analogous mental journey, she wondered,
what deliberate pilgrimage of the heart, could one&mdash;but she
did not pursue that metaphor: it would give her the slip, she felt,
like the man with the false beard.</p>

<p>Clem finished his cigarette and ground it out carefully with his
heel: the grass was tinder-dry. They got into the car again,
conscious that one of their most cherished flags was now stuck in
more deeply than ever. Mrs. Miniver let the clutch in and set off
on the long descent to Appleby. In the convex driving-mirror she
could see, dwindling rapidly, the patch of road where they had
stood; and she wondered why it had never occurred to her before
that you cannot successfully navigate the future unless you keep
always framed beside it a small clear image of the past.</p>

<h2>THE TWELFTH OF AUGUST</h2>

<p>"Well," said Archie McQuern, knocking out his pipe on the lowest
stone of the dyke and brushing a crumb of pastry off his kilt. "I
suppose we'd better be moving on."</p>

<p>He hoisted himself out of the heather and blew his whistle.
Bess, the young black pointer, leapt to her feet; Duke and Reiver,
the two liver-and-white ones, got to theirs more circumspectly, as
befitted their age and experience. They all three stood looking up
at him with their queer angular faces. It just shows, thought Mrs.
Miniver, leaning back against the dyke and watching her
brother-in-law, how careful one ought to be about what animals one
gets mixed up with. Archie, tall, bony, and chestnut-headed, had
been breeding pointers for twenty years and was now almost
indistinguishable from Duke; while Alison, his eldest daughter, who
was black-haired and who helped him to train them, was beginning to
have a distinct look of Bess, especially about the eyes. Oh, well,
there were worse things to look like: at any rate pointers had
interesting faces, more intellectual and less sentimental than
those of other gun-dogs. And she wondered, in passing, whether the
narrow jaws and protruding teeth which are so distressingly
prevalent among the English might not be due less to heredity than
to their being encouraged to keep rabbits in their impressionable
youth. Change a nation's pets and you might change its physiognomy:
but she could not think, off-hand, of a nice prognathous
substitute.</p>

<p>"No, thank you," she said, in answer to a question from her
brother-in-law. "I don't think I'll walk the Laosgainn
beats&mdash;I'll stay here with Susan and join you again when
you're doing the Low Moor."</p>

<p>The morning had been enjoyable but strenuous. Archie never
dreamed of driving until he had had at least a fortnight of the
subtler sport of shooting over dogs, so that the Twelfth at Quern,
for onlookers, was not a ladylike affair of lolling in a
grouse-butt with a well-powdered nose. It entailed a long and
stiffish walk, some of it through very deep old heather. Mrs.
Miniver loved it, especially now that she had Vin's shooting to
watch as well as Clem's; but she was always glad enough to drop out
while they did the two steepest beats of all, above the hill
loch.</p>

<p>The guns trudged off up the lee side of the dyke. The van,
loaded with empty luncheon-baskets and the morning's bag, blundered
away down the cart-track like a drunken bee. The two women moved
over to a little grassy knoll shaded by rowan trees. The wind had
dropped entirely; it was as hot as one always forgets the Highlands
can be. Ben Cailleach and the other high tops were shimmering.
Below, they could see the grey roof of Quern House jutting out of
its fir plantation, with a column of smoke going up from the
kitchen chimney as straight as a wand. Beyond lay the little strath
dotted with haycocks, and beyond that again Judy and Toby and their
two youngest cousins were busily damming the burn. It was good for
them, thought Mrs. Miniver, to be for a time part of a large
family, with the greater complexity, but lower intensity, of its
relationships.</p>

<p>She brought her eyes back again from the hazy middle distance to
the near, clear presence of Clem's sister, who had planted her back
firmly against one of the rowans and begun to knit.</p>

<p>"Susan," said Mrs. Miniver, "where did that knitting come from?
I swear you didn't have any on you a minute ago. I believe you
materialize bits of knitting out of thin air, the way conjurers do
with lighted cigarettes."</p>

<p>"No," said Susan, "they grow out of my finger-tips, like a
thread out of a spider. As a matter of fact my whole inside is made
of wool. One gets like that, you know, living in the Highlands all
the year round."</p>

<p>"The great thing about you," said her sister-in-law, "is that
you've never let it spread from the neck up."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said Mrs. McQuern elliptically, "there's always
Douglas and Foulis."</p>

<p>Mrs. Miniver lay down on her side to make the colours of the
hills clearer. Across the foreground of her picture was a spray of
whin in full bloom, upon which two chaffinches were swinging. Above
them a pair of white butterflies were weaving quick flirtatious
patterns in the air. It was idyllic&mdash;a Chinese painting on
silk; an exquisite, peaceful oasis in a day of organized death.</p>

<p>"It's all very well to talk like that," she said. "But you know
you wouldn't live anywhere else for the world. I believe you're
completely and utterly contented."</p>

<p>Susan chuckled. "Not always. Not when the cook breaks her leg on
the eleventh of August."</p>

<p>"Oh, everybody has catastrophes. The only thing that matters is
to be properly cast, so that you get the kind of catastrophes you
can deal with. I think that's what I meant, more than contented.
You're quite perfectly cast, Susan."</p>

<p>"Bah-hah," said Susan. "So are you, for that matter. I'd hate
your sort of life just as much as you'd hate mine."</p>

<p>"Except for a holiday&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"In fact," said Susan, "it's just as important to marry the
right life as the right person."</p>

<p>Well, no, thought Mrs. Miniver, not quite. But near enough for a
hot day, after lunch. She shut her eyes, taking the Chinese picture
with her inside the lids.</p>

<p>"Listen!" said Susan, presently. "I heard a shot."</p>

<p>Mrs. Miniver opened her eyes again for a moment. Eight white
wings lay scattered on the grass under the gorsebush. The
chaffinches were looking as though butterflies wouldn't melt in
their mouths. It was too hot to work out the moral. She shut her
eyes again and went to sleep.</p>

<h2>AT THE GAMES</h2>

<p>They all went over to the Crurie Games, though not all for the
same reason. Archie McQuern went because he thought he ought to,
and Susan went because Archie thought she ought to. The three
Miniver children and the four younger McQuerns went because of the
Fun Fair in the next field. Alison, the eldest, went because the
Ardbennie party were sure to be there, and she knew that Jock
Murray was home on leave. Miss Bates, the English holiday
governess, who had never been in Scotland before, went because her
great-grandmother's name had been Gillespie, and the sound of
pipe-music always made her feel pleasantly queer. Clem went because
he would generally rather do things than not, and Mrs. Miniver went
because for some obscure reason she liked watching Highland
Games.</p>

<p>"I can't understand it," said her sister-in-law. "I shouldn't
have thought it was your line at all. Just look how you go on about
cricket."</p>

<p>But the whole point was, Mrs. Miniver tried to explain, that the
Games weren't cricket. In fact, they weren't games at all, but
athletics. There was no team spirit about, and no holiness and
winning of Waterloo, but only a lot of ordinary men, each one out
for himself, trying to run faster or vault higher or throw a weight
farther than any of the others for the sake of thirty or forty
shillings in prize-money and a mention in the <i>Crurie Herald</i>.
It might not be very heroic, but it was agreeably
straightforward.</p>

<p>And beautiful, too, she thought with a lift of pleasure as one
of the vaulters soared smoothly upwards at the end of his banded
pole, cleared an improbable height, and dropped to the ground as
lightly as though he were falling through water. (For some reason,
pole-vaulting always gave the impression that it was being
performed in slow-motion.) He was a lean, lantern-jawed man in a
darned sweater and faded blue shorts. He straightened himself up,
strolled back to the starting-point, and pulled on his trousers.
The next-but-one competitor was just taking his off. They were all
completely unconcerned. Miss Bates looked as though she wasn't
quite sure of her ground.</p>

<p>"It must be dreadfully cold for them, poor things," she said at
last, taking the broader view.</p>

<p>It certainly was cold for the middle of August. The occasional
gleams of sun were as unconvincing as a forced smile, and most of
the time a bitter little wind enfiladed the grandstand, sending
coat-collars up and hands into pockets. There was a burst of
applause. An announcement boomed out from the four loud-speakers
which clustered back to back like the florets of moschatel. Mrs.
Miniver turned to her brother-in-law.</p>

<p>"What was that? I missed it."</p>

<p>"Heavy hammer," said Archie. "Willie Muir is going to try and
break the ground record. He's the local blacksmith."</p>

<p>Mrs. Miniver touched Miss Bates on the arm and pointed to the
farther side of the field. Muir was a huge man. His chest muscles
stood out through his thin singlet and his kilt was the size of a
barrel. He stepped forward, rubbed his hands, stamped his toes into
the ground to get a firm stance, and gripped the haft of the
hammer.</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" said Miss Bates, appalled, as he began to whirl
the hammer round his head and shoulders, slowly at first but with
increasing speed. "Look, there are some people sitting quite close
to him&mdash;supposing he let go at the wrong moment?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Miniver had often supposed this, with horrified
fascination; but it never seemed to happen. The hammer was whirling
now at a great speed, and at last Muir swung right round with a
kind of grunting groan, and twenty-two pounds of brute metal flew
through the air, landing with a thump a few feet from the judges.
Mrs. Miniver relaxed. There was a storm of applause. Two men
measured the distance with a tape. It was announced as ninety-four
feet&mdash;three inches longer than the ground record. The applause
redoubled.</p>

<p>"Well," said Miss Bates, "I suppose that's what they call
tossing the caber. Or is it cabber?"</p>

<p>"Caber," said Mrs. Miniver. "No, that wasn't it, but you'll see
it in a minute, I expect."</p>

<p>Meanwhile several other things were going on in the picture
which was framed by the heather-trimmed pillars of the grand-stand
(stuck here and there, incongruously enough, with dahlias). The
competitors were just assembling for the 600 yards handicap,
looking, as runners so often do before a race, like the criminal
line-up in a gangster film&mdash;to be transformed by the starter's
pistol into Greek gods. In another corner of the field a pair of
wrestlers were interlocked in one of the more intimate holds of the
catch-as-catch-can style. Miss Bates looked away rather quickly.
The quadruple loud-speaker was announcing that the lantern-jawed
man had won the pole-vaulting with a height of ten feet nine
inches. In the far distance the steam organ of the roundabout was
playing, sweetly and puffily, "My Lily of Laguna." And on the
wooden platform in front of the grand-stand two men in full
Highland dress were poised for a sword-dance. One of them was small
and spare, with light eyes, like Alan Breck. He wore the striking
black-and-yellow of the MacLeods; there was a sprig of juniper in
his bonnet. The second was younger and taller. He was wearing a
dark greenish tartan, and his lips were parted all the time in an
almost imperceptible smile.</p>

<p>The pipes struck up their sharp thrusting rhythm, drowning the
faint noises of the fair-ground. The two men danced neatly and
vigorously, with a passionate precision. Their pointed soft-shod
feet twinkled unerringly between the crossed blades and scabbards,
in and out and over and round, going through the old intricate
ritual with which their forebears had woven themselves a cloak of
security on the eve of battle. But now, if toe touched steel, it
would mean only the forfeiting of prize-money, not a chill in the
heart at the certainty of impending death.</p>

<p>The younger man, as nimble as a cat for all his height, was
still smiling a little as he danced. The Alan Breck one was
flashing like a wasp in his black-and-yellow. The music began to
quicken intolerably for the final steps: and Mrs. Miniver saw the
rest of it through a mist. For I defy anyone, she thought in
self-defence, to watch a sword-dance through to the end without
developing a great-grandmother called Gillespie.</p>

<h2>THE AUTUMN FLIT</h2>

<p>"Where on earth is Vin?" asked Mrs. Miniver. The car was
standing at the door of Starlings, ready to take them all back to
London. The luggage-boot was filled to overflowing with the
well-known paraphernalia of a nursery flit: even Clem's genius for
stacking had been unable to make it look like anything but a cubist
cornucopia. Clem was in the driving seat; Nannie was at the back,
with Toby on her knee and Judy sitting close up beside her to make
room for Vin. But Vin himself was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>"Wretched boy," said Clem amiably. "I told him what time we were
starting."</p>

<p>"He went off on his bike directly after breakfast," said Judy,
"to fetch his knife. He left it over at Pound Mill yesterday when
he was fishing."</p>

<p>"He may have come in through the garden door," said his mother.
"Mrs. Downce, you might go and see if he's in the kitchen, and I'll
try the nursery."</p>

<p>She went back into the house. It had already begun to acquire
that out-at-grass, off-duty look which houses get as soon as their
owners go away; it was quite obviously preparing to take off its
stays and slip into something loose.</p>

<p>The day nursery was empty, but around it, like a line of salt
wrack, lay unmistakable traces of the children. As they grew older
the flotsam of the holidays, without diminishing in quantity,
changed a little in character. There were fewer stones and pieces
of wood, though Toby still collected flints with holes through them
and sticks which had been spirally grooved by honeysuckle. On the
other hand there were now things like empty cartridge-cases (spent
by Vin on rabbits and retrieved by Toby for use in a vast
chess-like game which he played, by himself, on the squares of the
nursery linoleum); and on the edge of the windowsill lay some
bright shreds of wool, silk, and tinsel, some broken feathers, and
the clamp-marks of a small vice. Vin, the evening before, had been
tying flies; having run out of proper materials, he had had to fall
back on the contents of the toy-cupboard, and with great ingenuity
he had produced something which looked at first sight like an
Alexandra, but which was really, he admitted, a
Red-Indian-and-Gollywog.</p>

<p>Of Judy the traces were less conspicuous: her activities were
mostly personal and required little gear. But just occasionally she
too was bitten with the boys' mania for making things, and when
that happened she got it badly. A few days ago, someone had
described in the "Children's Hour" how to make a reed-pipe out of a
jointed wheat-stalk, or, failing that, out of a drinking straw with
a blob of sealing wax at one end. The farms immediately round
Starlings were all pasture and hops: so she begged a packet of
straws from Mrs. Downce and used up every one of them. To make the
vibrating tongue was fairly easy, but to space the six finger-holes
so as to get a <i>sol-fa</i> scale proved to be a matter of trial
and error, exasperating to herself and excruciating to her hearers.
She cut her left hand and burnt her right one. The floor became
littered with small square chips of straw: there was one now,
lurking under the table. Every half-hour or so there would be heard
a tentative tweedling cadence, full of quarter-tones and other
exotic intervals; then a sigh as she snipped off the unsuccessful
part of the pipe and threw it away. (The top half she thoughtfully
preserved as a squeaker for Toby.) Just before bed-time the next
day she managed to produce a pipe on which, by overblowing a little
on the la, she could give a recognizable rendering of "Drink to Me
Only."</p>

<p>As it happened, that day had been for the grown-ups one of great
tension and anxiety, with the threat of war hanging like a leaden
nimbus in the air. And Mrs. Miniver had drawn a curious comfort
from watching Judy's small intent face, bent hour after hour over
her delicate and absorbing task. International tempers might flame
or cool; the turning kaleidoscope of time might throw mankind's
little coloured scraps of belief into new patterns, new ideologies;
but the length of the vibrating column of air which, in a tube of a
given calibre, would produce C natural&mdash;that was one of the
fixed things. And it wasn't the fault of the scientists, was it, if
the people for whom they made the pipes chose to play dangerous
tunes?</p>

<p>She went back to the car, and at the same moment Vin appeared
from the direction of the bicycle-shed, very much out of
breath.</p>

<p>"Sorry," he said shortly, and scrambled into place beside Judy.
Mrs. Miniver got in too. The car moved off through winding lanes
towards the arterial road. It was certainly a heart-breaking day on
which to leave the country. It was warm and yet fresh; blindfold,
one could have mistaken it for a morning in early May: but this
kind of day, she reflected, had a more poignant loveliness in
autumn than in spring, because it was a receding footfall, a waning
moon. The woods were just beginning to turn, the different trees
springing into individuality again, demobilized from the uniform
green of summer. There had been a heavy dew. From the row of fires
in front of the hop-pickers' huts the smoke rose blue and pungent.
The hops were nearly all in, the stripped bines lay tumbled and
tangled on the ground. One campaign at least was over without
bloodshed.</p>

<h2>GAS MASKS</h2>

<p>Clem had to go and get his gas mask early, on his way to the
office, but the rest of them went at half-past one, hoping that the
lunch hour would be less crowded. It may have been: but even so
there was a longish queue. They were quite a large party&mdash;Mrs.
Miniver and Nannie; Judy and Toby; Mrs. Adie, the Scots cook, lean
as a winter aspen, and Gladys, the new house-parlourmaid: a pretty
girl, with complicated hair. Six of them&mdash;or seven if you
counted Toby's Teddy bear, which seldom left his side, and
certainly not if there were any treats about. For to children, even
more than to grown-ups (and this is at once a consolation and a
danger), any excitement really counts as a treat, even if it is a
painful excitement like breaking your arm, or a horrible excitement
like seeing a car smash, or a terrifying excitement like playing
hide-and-seek in the shrubbery at dusk. Mrs. Miniver herself had
been nearly grown-up in August 1914, but she remembered vividly how
her younger sister had exclaimed with shining eyes, "I say! I'm in
a war!"</p>

<p>But she clung to the belief that this time, at any rate,
children of Vin's and Judy's age had been told beforehand what it
was all about, had heard both sides, and had discussed it
themselves with a touching and astonishing maturity. If the worst
came to the worst (it was funny how one still shied away from
saying, "If there's a war," and fell back on euphemisms)&mdash;if
the worst came to the worst, these children would at least know
that we were fighting against an idea, and not against a nation.
Whereas the last generation had been told to run and play in the
garden, had been shut out from the grown-ups' worried conclaves:
and then quite suddenly had all been plunged into an orgy of
licensed lunacy, of boycotting Grimm and Struwwelpeter, of looking
askance at their cousins' old Fr&auml;ulein, and of feeling towards
Dachshund puppies the uneasy tenderness of a devout churchwoman
dandling her daughter's love-child. But this time those
lunacies&mdash;or rather, the outlook which bred them&mdash;must
not be allowed to come into being. To guard against that was the
most important of all the forms of war work which she and other
women would have to do: there are no tangible gas masks to defend
us in war-time against its slow, yellow, drifting corruption of the
mind.</p>

<p>The queue wormed itself on a little. They moved out of the
bright, noisy street into the sunless corridors of the Town Hall.
But at least there were benches to sit on. Judy produced pencils
and paper (she was a far-sighted child) and began playing
Consequences with Toby. By the time they edged up to the end of the
corridor Mr. Chamberlain had met Shirley Temple in a Tube lift and
Herr Hitler was closeted with Minnie Mouse in an even smaller
rendezvous.</p>

<p>When they got into the Town Hall itself they stopped playing.
Less than half an hour later they came out again into the sunlit
street: but Mrs. Miniver felt afterwards that during that half-hour
she had said good-bye to something. To the last shreds which
lingered in her, perhaps, of the old, false, traditional conception
of glory. She carried away with her, as well as a litter of black
rubber pigs, a series of detached impressions, like shots in a
quick-cut film. Her own right hand with a pen in it, filling up six
yellow cards in pleasurable block capitals; Mrs. Adie sitting up as
straight as a ramrod under the fitter's hands, betraying no signs
of the apprehension which Mrs. Miniver knew she must be feeling
about her false fringe; Gladys's rueful giggle as her elaborate
coiffure came out partially wrecked from the ordeal; the look of
sudden realization in Judy's eyes just before her face was covered
up; the back of Toby's neck, the valley deeper than usual because
his muscles were taut with distaste (he had a horror of rubber in
any form); a very small child bursting into a wail of dismay on
catching sight of its mother disguised in a black snout; the
mother's muffled reassurances&mdash;"It's on'y Mum, duck.
Look&mdash;it's just a mask, like at Guy Fawkes, see?" (<i>Mea
mater mala sus est</i>. Absurdly, she remembered the Latin catch
Vin had told her, which can mean either "My mother is a bad pig" or
"Run, mother, the pig is eating the apples.")</p>

<p>Finally, in another room, there were the masks themselves,
stacked close, covering the floor like a growth of black fungus.
They took what had been ordered for them&mdash;four medium size,
two small&mdash;and filed out into the street.</p>

<p>It was for this, thought Mrs. Miniver as they walked towards the
car, that one had boiled the milk for their bottles, and washed
their hands before lunch, and not let them eat with a spoon which
had been dropped on the floor.</p>

<p>Toby said suddenly, with a chuckle, "We ought to have got one
for Teddy." It would have been almost more bearable if he had said
it seriously. But just as they were getting into the car a fat
woman went past, with a fatter husband.</p>

<p>"You did look a fright," she said. "I 'ad to laugh."</p>

<p>One had to laugh.</p>

<h2>BACK TO NORMAL</h2>

<p>"&mdash;and a Welsh rabbit," said Mrs. Miniver. "Vin'll be
spending the night here, and he likes that. Why, Mrs. Adie, what's
the matter?"</p>

<p>"It's nothing, madam," said Mrs. Adie, fumbling in vain for a
handkerchief and finally wiping her eyes on her apron. "It's only,
it's so nice to be back to normal again." A wintry smile
re-established itself on her thin lips; she went out of the room,
sniffing. It was the first sign of emotion she had shown since the
Crisis began.</p>

<p>Back to normal. No, thought Mrs. Miniver, standing by the window
and looking out into the square, they weren't quite back to normal,
and never would be; none of them, except perhaps Toby. He was at an
age when shapes, colours, and textures still meant more to him (as
they do to some people throughout life) than human relationships.
Therefore, his treasure was safe: there would always be warm moss
and pink shells and smooth chestnuts. But the rest of
them&mdash;even, to a slight degree, Judy&mdash;would never be
exactly the same again. Richer and poorer, but not the same. Poorer
by a few layers of security, by the sense of material permanence,
by the conviction, when planting a bulb, that one would pretty
certainly be there to see the daffodil in flower. But richer by
several things, of which the most noticeable was a quickened
eyesight. On the drive up from Starlings, a casual glimpse through
the window had reminded her of De La Mare's "Fare Well":&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>May the rusting harvest hedgerow<br>
Still the Traveller's Joy entwine<br>
And as happy children gather<br>
Posies once mine.</blockquote>

<p>And when things grew really serious&mdash;when Clem had gone off
with his Anti-Aircraft Battery, and Vin had been sent up to Quern,
and the children's day school had been evacuated to the west
country, and the maids had gone down to Starlings to prepare it for
refugees, and she herself, staying at her sister's flat, had signed
on as an ambulance driver&mdash;during all the rather grim little
bouts of staff-work which these arrangements entailed, she had been
haunted day and night by the next two lines of the same
poem:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>Look the last on all things lovely<br>
Every hour...</blockquote>

<p>For even if none of them was killed or injured, and even if
their house did not, after all, attract one of the high-explosive
bombs intended for the near-by power station, yet these
possibilities had been abruptly and urgently mooted: and they had
found themselves looking at each other, and at their cherished
possessions, with new eyes. Small objects one could send to the
country&mdash;a picture or two, the second edition of Donne, and
the little antelope made of burnt jade; others, like the furniture,
one could more or less replace: but one couldn't send away, or
replace, the old panelling on the stairs, or the one crooked pane
in the dining-room window which made the area railings look bent,
or the notches on the nursery door-post where they had measured the
children every year. And these, among their material belongings,
were the ones that had suddenly seemed to matter most.</p>

<p>Another thing they had gained was an appreciation of the value
of dullness. As a rule, one tended to long for more drama, to feel
that the level stretches of life between its high peaks were a
waste of time. Well, there had been enough drama lately. They had
lived through seven years in as many days; and Mrs. Miniver, at any
rate, felt as though she had been wrung out and put through a
mangle. She was tired to the marrow of her mind and heart, let
alone her bones and ear-drums: and nothing in the world seemed more
desirable than a long wet afternoon at a country vicarage with a
rather boring aunt. A mountain range without valleys was merely a
vast plateau, like the central part of Spain: and just about as
exhausting to the nerves.</p>

<p>The third and most important gain was a sudden clarifying of
intentions. On one of the blackest evenings of all several of their
friends had dropped in to listen to the news and exchange plans.
Among them were Badgecumbe, the old bio-chemist, and a young man
called Flint, who wrote poetry and rather neat essays. When Mrs.
Miniver switched off the set on a note of gloom they sat for a few
moments too stunned to speak. Then Johnny Flint said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I suppose that play of mine won't get written now. I've been
talking about it for years. Oh, God. Nothing but a slim vol. and a
bunch of light middles."</p>

<p>And old Badger said in a tired growl from the depths of his
armchair:&mdash;</p>

<p>"At least you'll still be young, Johnny, if you come through it
at all. But I wish I'd left all the small stuff and concentrated on
the I.P. experiments."</p>

<p>"I know," said Mrs. Miniver. "I haven't got a pen like you,
Johnny, or a laboratory like Badger. But there were a lot of things
I wanted to do, too, that seemed fairly important. Only one never
got around to them, somehow."</p>

<p>"'Time's winged chariot,'" said Johnny bitterly. "It's caught us
up this time all right."</p>

<p>"Looks like it," said Mrs. Miniver. "But if by any miraculous
chance it hasn't..."</p>

<p>Well, it hadn't, after all. As she turned away from the window
the date on her writing-table calendar caught her eye. Just a year
ago, she remembered, she had stood at that same window putting the
summer away and preparing to enjoy the autumn. And here she was
again: only this time it wasn't chrysanthemums she was rearranging,
but values.</p>

<h2>BADGER AND THE ECHIDNA</h2>

<p>Mrs. Miniver left the committee meeting about four o'clock in a
mood half-way between exasperation and despair. The subject (a
privately run, rather Utopian scheme connected with slum clearance)
had fired her imagination when she had first heard of it: but why,
she wondered, leaving the Comfreys' ample portico behind her and
crossing over into Regent's Park, why must Pegasus always be
harnessed to a dray, with a ham-handed cretin at the reins? By what
mismanagement, what mistaking of bulk for importance, of bonhomie
for goodwill, had a project like this been saddled with Lord
Comfrey as chairman? And how could it succeed, if the meetings were
always to be held in that moss-carpeted mausoleum of a house, at
that smug post-prandial hour? If I had my way, she thought, walking
very quickly so as to create a wind past her temples, I'd arrange
the scene of every conference to suit its subject: and this
particular committee ought to meet in a damp basement bedroom in
Shoreditch, sitting on upturned soap-boxes. Rats, black beetles,
and all.</p>

<p>She decided to go to the Zoo. It would be a relief to her
feelings. As she passed the still open trenches she caught sight of
old Badgecumbe standing among a little knot of sightseers, his vast
head bent, his eyes hidden as usual beneath jutting, grizzled
brows.</p>

<p>"Badger! You, rubber-necking?"</p>

<p>"I've been working with pyridine all day, and I need a breath of
air."</p>

<p>"So do I. Not pyridine&mdash;people. I was just going to do a
Whitman. Why not come too?"</p>

<p>Badger nodded towards the trenches. "Woolley and the rest of 'em
dig to uncover past civilizations. We dig to bury our own."</p>

<p>"I hear they're going to roof them in and put flower-beds on
top."</p>

<p>"Very suitable," said Badger drily. "To remind us, I suppose,
that 'this flower, safety,' is still growing in pretty shallow
soil."</p>

<p>"Come mee-yer, Alf-ay!" A woman standing at the foot of a gravel
mountain beckoned with peevish urgency to her child. "You'll fall
in and break your neck, and serve you right. And besides," she
added, "you'll get them new boots in a muck."</p>

<p>"'I'm the King of the Castle,'" chanted the urchin from the
topmost pinnacle.</p>

<p>"I'll give you Castle..." She breasted the foot-hills briskly.
But her son had already slithered to the ground on the other side,
and was bearing down upon some new sightseers with outstretched
palm.</p>

<p>"This wye to the trenches, lidy. Penny to show you round..."</p>

<p>"I think perhaps you're right," said Badger, taking Mrs.
Miniver's arm. "It'll be a relief to go and look at creatures who
only behave grotesquely because they can't help it."</p>

<p>"Let's choose the funniest," said Mrs. Miniver. "The mandrills.
And the giraffes."</p>

<p>They made their way towards the main entrance of the Zoo.</p>

<p>"On second thoughts," said Badger, "we'll go straight to the
echidna. You know the echidna?"</p>

<p>"I've seen its cage, but it's never been actually on view."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be. It's nocturnal; but we'll get them to rout it
out. It's worth seeing, as a horrible warning. Zaglossus bruijnii.
My unfavourite of God's creatures. If indeed it is one, which I
sometimes doubt."</p>

<p>There was no gainsaying Badger. Mrs. Miniver relinquished her
hopes of the brilliant, sneering mandrills, the gentle, bowing,
improbable giraffes. But she liked the Small Rodent House, anyway.
It contained three of the most engaging animals in the
Zoo&mdash;the Indian Fruit Bat, which was like a doll's umbrella;
the Golden Hamster; and, best of all, the Fat Sand Rat.</p>

<p>But Badger marched her straight past these to the low cages at
the end. The keeper opened the door of the sleeping-hutch; and
there, huddled in one corner, was what looked like a sack-shaped
lump of clay about two feet long. On closer investigation, however,
it proved to be covered with short, sparse, dirty-white spines; and
between the spines there was some coarse greyish-brown hair. The
keeper reached over and lifted it out of the hutch by one hind leg.
("It's the only way," Badger explained. "There's no other approach
to an echidna.") The under-side of the creature was even less
attractive than its top view. It had tiny pig's eyes, squeezed
tightly shut. Its face, almost non-existent, was extended into a
pipe-shaped snout, so long and thin that it looked far more like a
tail than did the short spatulate appendage at the other end of its
body. Through this snout, which it kept pressed down against its
belly in a vain attempt to curl up, it emitted a prolonged,
petulant hissing. As soon as the keeper put it down it hunched
itself back into its corner again, squirming with distaste for
light and activity.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Mrs. Miniver, trying to be fair, "I suppose
it's more lively at night."</p>

<p>"Not much," said the keeper. "Waddles out just far enough to get
its food, then back it goes."</p>

<p>("Habitat: West End," murmured Badger.)</p>

<p>"Sucks it in through that snout. No teeth."</p>

<p>"Tell me," said Mrs. Miniver, "I see it's been here for a good
many years: have you ever managed to get up any affection for
it?"</p>

<p>"Not much," said the keeper, apologetically. "It's just about
alive, and that's all you can say for it."</p>

<p>"Let's get out of here," said Badger abruptly. "It's as bad as
pyridine. Besides, that animal gives me the horrors."</p>

<p>"It's certainly not pretty," said Mrs. Miniver.</p>

<p>"Pretty? It's criminal. It's what's been peopling half the
world. Lowest sub-class of mammal. Barely alive. The incarnation of
accidie."</p>

<p>"Accidie? oh, yes&mdash;one of the seven deadly sins."</p>

<p>"The only deadly one," said Badger. "Well, here we've all been.
Some of us less than others, but all of us to a certain extent. No
vision. No energy. No discrimination. Spiritual monotremata."</p>

<p>Mrs. Miniver had often noticed that when Badger got worked up
his sentences grew shorter and his words longer. They stepped out
into the fresh autumn sunshine.</p>

<h2>A WILD DAY</h2>

<p>Looking up casually in the middle of writing a letter, Mrs.
Miniver saw, through the back window of the drawing-room, something
that she had never consciously seen before: the last leaf being
blown from a tree. One moment it was there, on the highest bough of
all, wagging wildly in the wind and the rain. The next moment it
was whirling away across the roof tops, a forlorn ragged speck. The
line of its flight was the arabesque at the end of a chapter, the
final scroll under the death-warrant of summer. Once more the
lime-tree stood bone-naked.</p>

<p>So that was that: and a good thing, too. At first, like most
people, Mrs. Miniver had enjoyed the amazing spell of warm weather
which had lasted throughout October and most of November. It had
been pleasant and comforting; it had helped to heal the scars which
the last fortnight of September had left behind. But later, as day
after day broke close and windless, and night after night failed to
bring any refreshing chill, she began to feel oddly uneasy. The
year, now, seemed like an ageing woman whose smooth cheeks were the
result, not of a heart perennially young, but of an assured income,
a sound digestion, and a protective callousness of spirit. Out of
those too-bright eyes there looked, now, not youthfulness, but
infantilism; and the smile which accompanied the look was growing a
little vacant.</p>

<p>Therefore, it had been a great relief when, a few days before,
the weather had broken with a spectacular gale. The old beautiful
painted aristocracy of the leaves, already tottering, had fallen in
a night, overthrown by outward pressure and inward decadence. What
remained were the essential masses of the tree, bare and sober,
with a workaday beauty of their own. Through them, after a while,
the sap would rise into a new aristocracy, which would flourish
until it, too, had lost its freshness; and then fall. There is no
other way, it seems, in a deciduous world. True evergreenness does
not exist: the word is only another term for the ability to overlap
the old with the new.</p>

<p>By the time she had finished her letter (which was a long one to
Vin) the rain had nearly stopped, though the gale was as strong as
ever. She put on a mackintosh and struggled up the square to the
pillar-box. Outside the little newsagent's the evening paper
placards were flapping under their wire grids like netted geese.
The lower half of one of them had been folded upwards by the wind,
hiding everything except the word "JEWS." Mrs. Miniver was
conscious of an instantaneous mental wincing, and an almost
instantaneous remorse for it. However long the horror continued,
one must not get to the stage of refusing to think about it. To
shrink from direct pain was bad enough, but to shrink from
vicarious pain was the ultimate cowardice. And whereas to conceal
direct pain was a virtue, to conceal vicarious pain was a sin. Only
by feeling it to the utmost, and by expressing it, could the rest
of the world help to heal the injury which had caused it. Money,
food, clothing, shelter&mdash;people could give all these and still
it would not be enough: it would not absolve them from the duty of
paying in full, also, the imponderable tribute of grief.</p>

<p>She turned down the next street towards the river. It was
Nannie's day out and she was going to fetch the children from
school. The Royal Hospital, with bare straining trees in front of
it and black flying clouds behind, stood sombrely magnificent, a
fitting backcloth for the latest tragedy of the world. And here,
perhaps, she thought as she battled along St. Leonard's Terrace
under the lee of the wall, was a clue to the uneasiness which she
had felt at the lingering on of summer. All the associations of
November, the traditional flotsam left upon its shore by the
successive tides of history, went ill with halcyon weather. It was
the wind-month, the blood-month, Brumaire, the month of darkness:
its sign was the evil scorpion, who, when surrounded by a ring of
fire, was said to sting itself and die of its own poison. It was
ushered in by the Vigil of Saman, Lord of Death, by the witches and
warlocks of Hallowe'en. A later tide had left a later
mark&mdash;the ritual bonfires of Guy Fawkes' Day, round which
children still stood in primitive excitement, their innocent eyes
reflecting unconsciously the twin flames of sadism and
fire-worship. This year, down at Starlings, the farmer's children
next door had made an extra large bonfire, and for the Guy's face
they had used a mask representing the wicked Queen out of Disney's
"Seven Dwarfs," which Joey Iggulsden had bought at the village
shop. This blend of two nursery ideologies, three hundred years
apart, had particularly appealed to Clem. It showed, he said, that
children had an inborn knowledge that evil was evil, irrespective
of time or place: but Vin said it only showed that Joey Iggulsden
had a sense of humour. Anyway, it had been a grand bonfire, of a
terrifying heat and redness. Mrs. Miniver had tried for a few
moments to treat the scene as a reality, and had found herself
wondering whether there was any cause or conviction in the world
for which she would have the courage to go to the stake. She could
think of several for which she would make the attempt: but, as the
effigy lurched forward suddenly from the waist, with forked flames
writhing out of its sleeves like burning fingers, and its painted
leer crumpling up in the heat, she shuddered, and admitted humbly
enough that she herself would probably recant at the crackling of
the first twig.</p>

<p>However, nobody nowadays was burnt at the stake. The unfortunate
ones of the world were subjected to a more lingering torment, and
the fortunate ones were merely condemned to watch it from a front
seat, unwilling tricoteuses at an execution they were powerless to
prevent. The least they could do was not to turn away their eyes;
for with such a picture stamped upon the retina of their memory
they would not be able to lie easy until they had done their best
to ensure that it could never happen again. But it was going to
leave yet another ineffaceable watermark on the bleak shores of
November.</p>

<p>When she reached the Embankment she met the full force of the
gale, and exulted in it. Yes, this was the kind of weather that the
events of the world called for: a wild, dark day, suitable for a
wild, dark mood. From the two tall chimneys of the power station
the smoke streamed out horizontally, a black banner and a white
one. The river was at the three-quarter flood. It looked like a
battlefield, water and wind meeting angrily in a thousand small
hand-to-hand contests. But in an hour or so the tide would
turn.</p>

<h2>NEW YEAR'S EVE</h2>

<p>New Year's Eve was the only day of the year on which Mrs. Adie
really unbent. Christmas she held to be of little account, though
she cooked the turkey and the mince-pies faithfully enough and took
a benign interest in the children's presents. Boxing Day made her,
if anything, more tight-lipped than usual, for on that day the
Minivers were in the habit of eating a "June dinner" as a respite
from Christmas food: a practice which Mrs. Adie looked upon as
unnatural and faintly sacrilegious. There was a
no-good-can-come-of-this expression on her face as she served up
the clear soup, the fish mayonnaise, and the summer pudding (made
of bottled currants and raspberries); but up till now nobody had so
much as choked on a fish-bone.</p>

<p>On New Year's Eve, however, Mrs. Adie always invited the whole
family into the kitchen for a Hogmanay tea. There were scones and
oatcakes and shortbread and rowan jelly; and a Melrose sponge-cake
sent down by her brother, and a Selkirk bannock sent down by her
sister; and in addition to all these she managed to provide a
constant supply of fresh drop-scones all through the meal. She let
the children take turns in pouring spoonfuls of batter on to the
hot girdle, and in watching each little sizzling yellow pool go
beautifully brown round the edges. She even let Gladys make a few,
on condition that she gave up her regrettable Sassenach habit of
calling them "flapjacks."</p>

<p>After tea came an even greater treat&mdash;the fortune-telling.
Clem and Vin pushed the table back, and they all settled down round
the kitchen fire, while Mrs. Adie produced a large iron saucepan,
seven bowls of cold water, and a box full of pieces of lead which
she had somehow collected during the past twelve months from
various sources, such as plumbers and roof-menders. (At this time
of year Vin always took care to lock up the cupboard in which his
sea-fishing tackle was kept: he was afraid that Mrs. Adie might
have her eye on the weights.)</p>

<p>While the lead was still melting in the saucepan the children
were allowed to peer over it and watch. But when all the dull grey
lumps had dissolved into a pool of liquid silver Mrs. Adie made
everybody move back to a safe distance. Then she arranged the seven
bowls of water in a row on the hearth, pulled on a pair of old
leather gauntlets, lifted the pan off the fire, and poured a
generous dollop of lead into each bowl. The noise it made as it
entered the water was peculiar, and rather
frightening&mdash;something between the crack of a pistol-shot and
the hiss of an angry swan. Toby always blocked his cars and stood
very close to Clem; and Gladys, who was new to this ceremony, gave
a shrill "Oo!" and retreated into the scullery.</p>

<p>"C'm out o' there," said Mrs. Adie contemptuously. "It'll not
hurt you. If you run from your lead you'll run from your luck."</p>

<p>Obedient to the power of rhythm and alliteration, Gladys came
back. Marvellous, thought Mrs. Miniver, the way almost any Scot, in
almost any situation, can coin a phrase which has the authentic
ring and cogency of an ancient proverb.</p>

<p>And now Mrs. Adie knelt down on the hearth, took off her gloves,
fished the bright silvery "fortunes" out of the water, and began to
interpret them. The lead had hardened into the most fantastic
shapes: shapes like groups of statuary, like fern-fronds, like
intricate machinery, like outstretched wings, like gnarled
olive-trees. To the uninitiated, they might have meant anything or
nothing; but Mrs. Adie&mdash;helped, it is true, by a pretty close
knowledge of her hearers&mdash;contrived to give each of them a
detailed and appropriate meaning.</p>

<p>"My word now!" she would say, speaking to Judy but at Clem,
because it was easier that way, "look at all these fine new houses
your daddy's going to be architecting. And one of them's got a
terrible tall tower to it&mdash;aye, it'll be a kirk he's to build
next, sure enough." And then, to Vin: "Here's you with a
fishing-rod in your hand and a great big fish on the other end of
it and a wheen more o' them lying round about your feet. Oh, it's
going to be a grand year for the fishing, and no mistake." And to
Toby: "Now there's two wee wheels in this one, as plain as plain.
That'll be that bicycle you're wanting for your birthday, my
lamb...And whatever's this I can see in yours, Nannie? My lands! I
believe it's a wedding-cake!"</p>

<p>"It's no such thing," said Nannie primly. "It's a nice big new
work-basket, that's what it is. Just the thing I need, with the
amount of stockings they all manage to wear out down here."</p>

<p>"Well, well, we'll see," said Mrs. Adie darkly. "Wedding-cake or
work-basket, what will be will be, and one thing leads to
another."</p>

<p>There she goes again, thought Mrs. Miniver with an inward
chuckle. Rhythm and alliteration: the phrase-makers always get the
last word. She herself was sitting in a big wicker armchair at one
side of the range. She had drawn back a little because of the heat,
and from where she sat, half in shadow, the scene looked
wonderfully theatrical. Mrs. Adie, with a flush on her high
cheek-bones and her usually neat hair quite dishevelled, was
reaching forward to fish out Judy's "fortune"; and, opposite, the
six fire-fit faces were awaiting, with varying degrees of
credulity, her next pronouncement. It didn't much matter, after
all, whether the fortunes came true, or whether anybody believed in
them; what mattered was that here at least was one small roomful of
warmth and happiness, shut in by frail window-panes from a
freezing, harsh, and inexplicable world. All one could do was to be
thankful for moments like these. During the next twelve months,
perhaps, the remaining odds and ends of their civilization would
have been tipped into the melting-pot; and not even Mrs.
Adie&mdash;</p>

<p>But she became aware that her own fortune had just been told out
of the seventh bowl and that she had not heard a word of it.</p>

<p>"Thank you so much, Mrs. Adie," she said with a smile, taking
the cold, queer-shaped lump of metal on to her palm. So far as she
could remember, it was almost exactly the same shape as the one she
had had last year. So that was all right: for herself, she could
think of nothing better.</p>

<h2>CHOOSING A DOLL</h2>

<p>It was Judy's birthday. For some reason, her presents this year
included an unusually large proportion of money. There were several
postal orders, a half-crown or two, a ten-shilling note from Clem's
father, and fourpence-halfpenny from Toby, who had bought her a
purse as a present and thoughtfully put into it everything that he
happened to have got left. Altogether it came to nearly thirty
shillings, which was an unprecedented amount.</p>

<p>Judy had long ago discovered that the chief problem about
spending present-money was to choose between quality and quantity;
between the satisfaction of buying something really worth while,
far beyond the scope of her weekly allowance, and the excitement of
returning home with an armful of smaller parcels: so she had worked
out a form of compromise which she called Crust and Crumb. This
time she decided to lay out about fifteen shillings on Crust, in
the shape of a new doll, and to spend the rest later on Crumb. So
the day after her birthday she persuaded her mother to come on a
shopping expedition.</p>

<p>The choice of a doll, Judy found, was unexpectedly difficult.
They were things you didn't usually get a chance to choose for
yourself: they arrived as presents, chosen for you by other people,
and you had to get to know them and love them as they were. But
when you saw rows and rows of them together it was almost
impossible to be sure which you liked best. She explained this to
her mother.</p>

<p>"You see, it would be so awful to pick the wrong one. I mean,
suppose you could have gone and bought me in a shop instead of just
having me; you might have made a mistake and chosen Marigold
Thompson instead."</p>

<p>Mrs. Miniver's mouth twitched. She couldn't somehow imagine
herself choosing Marigold Thompson. A nice child, but
pudding-faced.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "I like Marigold."</p>

<p>"Oh, so do I. But what I mean is, she wouldn't have done for
you. And what's more," pursued Judy, "Marigold's mother wouldn't
have done for me. At all." she added with conviction.</p>

<p>"Why don't you like Marigold's mother?" asked Mrs. Miniver.
"She's always very kind to you. And she's frightfully fond of
children."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know. She told me so. But you see, when people are
frightfully fond of children you never know whether they really
like you or not, do you?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Miniver felt a quick glow of sympathy. It was exactly what
she had so often thought about the boringness of the sort of man
who "likes women."</p>

<p>"And besides," Judy went on, "she makes such a Thing about
everything, if you know what I mean."</p>

<p>Mrs. Miniver knew only too well. She had been at school with
Marigold's mother.</p>

<p>"And do you happen to know," she asked, "what Marigold thinks of
me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she likes you," said Judy. "She says you leave people
alone."</p>

<p>Mrs. Miniver cast her mind back, trying to remember whether she
and her contemporaries had discussed one another's parents so
freely and with such perception. Not till much later, she felt
sure&mdash;fourteen or fifteen, perhaps; at Judy's age one had more
or less taken them for granted, comparing them only in degree of
strictness. And to discuss them with one's own parents would have
been quite impossible: horizontal divisions were far stronger in
those days than vertical ones. Perhaps the psychologists were
right, and the "child mind"&mdash;that convenient
abstraction&mdash;matured earlier nowadays. On the other hand, she
herself had outgrown dolls by the age of nine, and here was Judy,
at eleven, buying a new one.</p>

<p>One thing was certain: the ultra-modern dolls, with felt
features realistically modelled, had no appeal for Judy at all.
Mrs. Miniver, quite early in the expedition, had pointed one of
them out. "Look, it's exactly like a real child&mdash;isn't it
lovely?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Judy with unexpected vehemence. "I don't like it
at all. You see, it's not in the least like a real doll." And she
turned away again to the ringlets, the huge eyes, and the tiny
rose-bud mouths. It was odd, thought her mother: dolls, which had
begun by being crude imitations of men and women, had ended by
developing a racial type of their own; and now apparently they
could not stray from this without becoming less lovable.</p>

<p>Judy eventually managed to narrow her field of choice down to
two&mdash;a blonde in blue silk and a brunette in pink organdie;
but between these she was quite unable to decide. "Better toss up,"
said her mother at last. They tossed with Toby's halfpenny, and the
blonde doll won. Judy stood staring at the two open boxes, her eyes
round with surprise.</p>

<p>"Mummy, how extraordinary! I thought I liked them both exactly
the same, but now I know for certain it's the dark one I want. Have
you ever noticed that about tossing up?"</p>

<p>"Often," said Mrs. Miniver, smiling. She remembered with what
astonishment, in her own childhood, she had stumbled upon that
particular piece of knowledge; and reflected once more how much of
the fun of parenthood lay in watching the children remake, with
delighted wonder, one's own discoveries.</p>

<h2>AT THE DENTIST'S</h2>

<p>"Quite comfortable?" asked Mr. Hinchley when he had played his
usual little overture upon the various pedals and handles of his
adjustable chair.</p>

<p>"Quite, thank you," said Mrs. Miniver. Horribly, she felt
inclined to add. For really it was the refinement of civilized
cruelty, this spick, span, and ingenious affair of shining leather
and gleaming steel, which hoisted you and tilted you and fitted
reassuringly into the small of your back and cupped your head
tenderly between padded cushions. It ensured for you a more
complete muscular relaxation than any armchair that you could buy
for your own home: but it left your tormented nerves without even
the solace of a counter-irritant. In the old days the victim's
attention had at least been distracted by an ache in the back, a
crick in the neck, pins and needles in the legs, and the uneasy
tickling of plush under the palm. But now, too efficiently
suspended between heaven and earth, you were at liberty to
concentrate on hell.</p>

<p>"A lit-tle wi-der," said Mr. Hinchley indulgently, dividing the
words into separate syllables as though he were teaching a very
small child to read. He was a kind, brisk, blond young man who
smelt (thank heaven) of nothing except rather good shaving-soap.
Mrs. Miniver obeyed meekly and resigned herself to the exquisite
discomfort of the electric drill. It was a pity, she felt, that
this instrument had been invented during a period when scientific
images in poetry were out of favour. To the moderns, who had been
brought up with it, it was presumably <i>vieux jeu</i>. They took
it for granted; it did not fire their imagination like the pylons
and the power-houses which were now the fashionable emotive
symbols. But oh, what Donne could have made of it, if it had been
invented in his time! With what delight he would have seized upon
it, with what harsh jostling and grinding of consonants he would
have worked out metaphor after metaphor, comparing its action to
that of all the worst tormentors of the heart: to jealousy, to
remorse, to the sharp gnawing of a bad conscience and the squalid
nagging of debt.</p>

<p>"Are you quite all right?" Mr. Hinchley inquired
solicitously.</p>

<p>"Eye aw eye," said Mrs. Miniver. Oh, quite all right. Grand. I
love it. This is just my idea of the way to spend a fine afternoon
in early spring. For early spring it undoubtedly was, even though
there might be a chunk of late winter still to come. Although they
were not yet in bud. the bare trees outside Mr. Hinchley's window
had a quickened, bloomy look like the expression on the face of
somebody who has just had a good idea but has not yet put it into
words; and the sky behind them was as clearly, flatly blue as the
sky in an aunt's water-colour. Mrs. Miniver kept her eyes focused
as long as possible upon the far distance, hoping that they would
take her other senses with them. But they didn't. The drill was too
insistent. So presently she brought them back and cast a
reproachful spaniel-glance upwards at Mr. Hinchley, which he was
too much absorbed to see. She devoted the next few minutes to
making a slow, dispassionate study of his left eyebrow, which was a
good enough shape as eyebrows go; and then decided that nothing but
a deep romantic love could make the human face tolerable at such
close quarters.</p>

<p>The far and the near having both failed her, she explored the
middle distance: the embossed plaster patterns on the ceiling; the
round, white lamp&mdash;an albino moon&mdash;which hung between her
and the window; the X-ray machine; the sterilizer; the glass bowl
on her left with the tumbler of pink mouth-wash beside it; and on
her right the large composite fitment, so absurdly like a porcelain
snowman, out of which burgeoned, among other things, this
insufferable, this inescapable, this altogether abominable
drill.</p>

<p>"Don't forget," said Mr. Hinchley brightly, "you can always
switch it off yourself if it gets unpleasant."</p>

<p>"Ank," said Mrs. Miniver. Gets unpleasant...Understatement could
be carried too far. She felt with her forefinger for the small cold
knob on the right arm of the chair, which would, if she pressed it,
silence the monster at once. This, at any rate, was a humane
provision which did not exist in the case of jealousy and the other
tormentors. But so far as Mrs. Miniver was concerned it might just
as well not have been there, for she had never yet been able to
bring herself to use it. Something always held her back&mdash;some
vague blend of noble and ignoble motives, of pride and masochism
and noblesse oblige and the Spartan Boy and Kate Barlass and a
quite unreasonable feeling of hostility towards the white-veiled,
white-coated young woman who hovered all the time behind Mr.
Hinchley waiting for him to say "Double-ended spatula" or "Pink
wax." There was nothing whatever wrong with Miss Bligh, who was
civil, decorative, and efficient: but somehow her presence made the
use of the merciful switch a psychological impossibility.</p>

<p>And now, at last, Mr. Hinchley turned off the drill of his own
accord.</p>

<p>"Finished?" asked Mrs. Miniver with a hopeful, lopsided
smile.</p>

<p>"Afraid not. But I thought you'd had about as much as you could
do with. I'd better give you a local."</p>

<p>Miss Bligh, as though by prestidigitation, suddenly held a
syringe between her scarlet finger-tips. She could just as easily,
Mrs. Miniver felt, have produced a billiard ball, a white rabbit,
or an ace-high straight flush. The prick of the injection was
sharp, but its effect was magical. In an instant the left-hand side
of her face ceased to belong to her. She put up one finger and
stroked her cheek curiously. It was like stroking somebody else's;
and therefore it was, tactually, like seeing herself clearly for
the first time. Not in a mirror, where the eyes must always bear
the double burden of looking and being looked into; but from
outside, through a window, catching herself in profile and
unawares.</p>

<p>Oh! page John Donne, she thought again impatiently. Run,
buttoned cherubim, through the palm lounges and gilt corridors of
heaven, turning his name (as is your habit) into a falling,
drawling dissyllable. "Meess-tah Dah-ahnne...Meess-tah
Dah-ahnne..." And tell him that there are at least two poems
waiting to be written in Mr. Hinchley's surgery. Miss Bligh will
hand him a pen.</p>

<h2>A POCKETFUL OF PEBBLES</h2>

<p>As she walked past a cab rank in Pont Street, Mrs. Miniver heard
a very fat taxi-driver with a bottle nose saying to a very old
taxi-driver with a rheumy eye: "They say it's all a question of
your subconscious mind."</p>

<p>Enchanted, she put the incident into her pocket for Clem. It
jostled, a bright pebble, against several others: she had had a
rewarding day. And Clem, who had driven down to the country to
lunch with a client, would be pretty certain to come back with some
good stuff, too. This was the cream of marriage, this nightly
turning out of the day's pocketful of memories, this deft habitual
sharing of two pairs of eyes, two pairs of ears. It gave you, in a
sense, almost a double life: though never, on the other hand, quite
a single one.</p>

<p>She found herself involuntarily rehearsing her pebble as she
walked. "It was pure New Yorker. Just as I went past, the fat one
said to the old one..." And then it would be Clem's turn: "There
was a superb horsy man there, like a prawn with a regimental tie.
He said: 'What I always say is, there's gone in the wind
and&mdash;er&mdash;gone in the wind.'" And then she could bring out
Mary's engagement, heard of by telephone after Clem had left the
house; and the joke which Toby had made on the way to school; and,
best of all, a beautiful saga about the woman who had sat next to
her at lunch. Mrs. Miniver had not heard her name at all, but if
she had invented her she would have called her Burfish. Lady
Constance Burfish, probably: or perhaps Mrs. Charles Burfish would
be subtler. Anyway, it appeared that she lived in Gloucestershire:
where did Mrs. Miniver live? In London, but they had a small house
in Kent.</p>

<p>"In Kent? How nice," said Mrs. Burfish. Her tone conveyed that
Kent was not quite out of the top drawer.</p>

<p>The talk turned, inevitably, on to the evacuation and billeting
of children. Mrs. Miniver said they had offered to take six at
Starlings, or more if the Government would provide enough beds to
turn the oast-house playroom into a dormitory.</p>

<p>"Wonderful of you," said Mrs. Burfish. "But, you know, a small
house is rather different. I mean, one doesn't expect&mdash;does
one?&mdash;to keep up quite the same standards..."</p>

<p>Mrs. Miniver, whose standards of comfort, like Clem's, were
almost reprehensibly high, mentally compared the compact warmth of
Starlings with some of the bedrooms she had occupied in large
country houses. But she said nothing: she did not want to interrupt
what promised to be an enjoyable turn.</p>

<p>"Of course," went on Mrs. Burfish (no, she would have to be Lady
Constance after all), "I was perfectly civil to the little woman
they sent round. In fact, I felt quite sorry for her. I said: 'What
an unpleasant job it must be for you, having to worm your way into
people's houses like this.' But you know, she didn't seem to mind.
I suppose some people aren't very sensitive."</p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Miniver, "I suppose not."</p>

<p>"And I said to her quite plainly, 'If there's a war you find me
only too willing to do my duty. But I cannot see the point,' I
said, 'of tying oneself down publicly beforehand and upsetting the
servants.'"</p>

<p>What luck I do have, thought Mrs. Miniver gratefully. She had,
of course, read about this kind of thing in the papers, but a
friend of hers who had helped with the billeting survey had assured
her that it was mercifully rare. So that now, face to face&mdash;or
rather, elbow to elbow&mdash;with an authentic example of it, she
was filled with the same sense of privileged awe which had overcome
her when, emerging suddenly from a painful encounter with a juniper
thicket in Teesdale, she had once seen a startled woodcock
unmistakably carrying off its young between its feet. Looking,
fascinated, at Lady Constance, she almost felt that she ought to
write a letter to The Field. Moreover, Lady Constance seemed bent
upon giving good measure. For she went on:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And, of course, I said to her before she left: 'Even if the
worst does come to the worst, you must make it quite clear to the
authorities that I can only accept Really Nice Children.'"</p>

<p>"And where," Mrs. Miniver could not restrain herself from
asking, "are the other ones to go?"</p>

<p>"There are sure to be camps," said Lady Constance firmly.</p>

<p>The talk swung in the opposite direction. A few minutes later
Mrs. Miniver heard Lady Constance's other neighbour, who bore one
of the famous Norfolk surnames, saying politely: "In
Gloucestershire? How nice."</p>

<p>Kent was avenged.</p>

<h2>BRAMBLES AND APPLE-TREES</h2>

<p>"The worst of gardening," said Mrs. Miniver, lying along one of
the upper boughs of an apple-tree and reaching out to snip with a
satisfying crunch through a half-inch-thick bramble, "is that it's
so full of metaphors one hardly knows where to begin."</p>

<p>"I know," said Clem from the ground below. He severed the root
of the bramble with a billhook and began to haul it down hand over
hand like a rope. "This is a prize one. It must have been about
thirty feet long when it was whole."</p>

<p>They had just bought the tiny white weather-boarded cottage on
the far side of Starlings Wood, which had been standing empty ever
since old Parsloe, the hurdle-maker, had died there a year ago. For
at least two years before that he had been almost bedridden, so
that the little garden and orchard had become a wilderness. The
Minivers had bought it partly because they were afraid that
Bateman, the local builder, might get hold of it first and spoil
it, and partly because, having made Starlings as nearly perfect as
they could, they were both filled with a restless longing for new
material: a state of mind which is as natural in the sphere of
house-property as it is in that of human relationships, but which
those who do not share it are apt to mistake for inconstancy. Of
this there was no question, for they both adored Starlings and
would not have exchanged it for any other house in England: but
just at the moment they were frankly enjoying a pretty shameless
flirtation with old Parsloe's cottage. When it was finished, as
Clem said, they would probably marry it off to one of their
friends; in the meanwhile it was the making of the Easter holidays.
They came over with the children nearly every day, working indoors
when the weather was bad, and out of doors when it was fine:
painting and whitewashing and carpentering and digging and weeding
and planting, without too deeply inquiring why, and for whom, they
were doing it.</p>

<p>Beyond the potato-patch, close under the high-banked hedge which
separated the garden from Carter's Lane, there stood three
apple-trees. These, during the last few years, had been stealthily
but steadily invaded by an army of brambles. Some had pressed
downwards from the bank in a solid phalanx, smothering the hinder
branches almost to death; others had thrust upwards from the
ground, looping themselves over the topmost boughs and falling to
take root again on the other side, so that the trees were bound to
the earth with criss-cross cords, like haystacks on a windy
headland. The job of rescuing them&mdash;combining as it did all
the most attractive features of a crusade and a demolition
contract&mdash;was one which the Minivers particularly enjoyed.
Constructive destruction is one of the most delightful employments
in the world, and in civilized life the opportunities for it are
only too rare. Also, a bonfire is always fun; and here was an
excellent excuse for the children to keep one going all day and
every day, piling it high with Clem's big bramble-faggots and
roasting potatoes (very unevenly) in the intervals. As for Mrs.
Miniver herself, she only regretted that circumstances had never
before led her to discover that the way to spend the spring was up
an apple-tree, in daily intimacy with its bark, leaves, and buds.
In early spring, as in the early years of children, there are times
when the clock races, the film runs in swift motion, and the
passionate watcher does not dare to glance away for fear he should
miss some lovely and fleeting phase. The present week was one of
those times. She looked, and the buds were as tightly, rosily
clenched as a baby's fist; she looked again, and they were half
uncurled. To-morrow they would be nearly open; the next day,
perhaps, in full bloom, like those of the pear-tree on the other
side of the garden, which towered up in the sunlight as tall,
rounded and dazzling as a cumulus cloud.</p>

<p>"Time for beer," said Clem, and went into the cottage to get
it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Miniver stuck her secateurs into her belt and disposed
herself more comfortably among the branches. She was determined not
to come down to earth before she need; if possible, never. Peering
downwards through the young leaves, she could see Toby making an
elaborate entanglement with twigs and cotton over some newly sown
grass. He trod on the seeds a good deal, because his soul was bent
on getting the pattern of the network symmetrical. Vin and Judy
were eating potatoes and racing snails up the gate-posts. In the
field beyond, two lambs&mdash;the only living creatures which never
fail to come up to expectation&mdash;were authentically gambolling.
Their whiteness rivalled the pear-blossom's. The smoke of the
bonfire drifted, blue and sweet, across the potato-patch. An
invisible, indefatigable blackbird went on saying "Doh-mi!" from
somewhere on the other side of Carter's Lane; he had made this
remark so many hundreds of times every day that they were all
beginning to ignore it.</p>

<p>Clem, coming out of the cottage, paused for a moment to take a
critical look at what they had done.</p>

<p>"We've made a lot of difference to-day," he said, as he handed
her glass up to her through the branches. "One is really beginning
to see the shape of the trees."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Mrs. Miniver between gulps, "the brambles
would try to make out that the apple-trees had been practising
encirclement."</p>

<p>"That reminds me," said Clem. "We ought to be getting home
pretty soon if we don't want to be late for the news."</p>

<h2>THE KHELIM RUG</h2>

<p>"Professor Badgecumbe has just telephoned to say that he is very
sorry indeed, but he can't get back for another twenty minutes."
Behind his secretary's air of apology crouched a protecting
tigress, ready to spring if Mrs. Miniver showed the least sign of
vexation. To Miss Perrin Badger was a god, and luncheon guests whom
he kept waiting had no right whatever to complain. The privilege of
knowing him ought to be enough for them.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter in the least," said Mrs. Miniver, who rather
agreed with her. "I'm sure he must have been unavoidably
detained."</p>

<p>"I'm sure he must." The tigress relaxed, mollified.</p>

<p>Unavoidably detained my foot, thought Mrs. Miniver. He had
probably been messing about in his laboratory and had simply
forgotten the time; or else he had been struck by a brilliant new
idea in the Tube and had been carried on to the terminus. She knew
this perfectly well, and so did Miss Perrin, and each knew that the
other knew it. But they both loved Badger: so the Professor was
unavoidably detained, and Mrs. Miniver sat down to wait in his
study.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact she was glad. She had been living for
several weeks through one of those arid stretches of life which lie
here and there between its more rewarding moments; where there is
neither nobility nor gaiety, neither civic splendour nor country
peace, but only allotments and rubbish-tips, the gasworks on one
side and a row of dilapidated hoardings on the other. As a rule she
managed to keep household matters in what she considered their
proper place. They should be no more, she felt, than a low
unobtrusive humming in the background of consciousness: the
mechanics of life should never be allowed to interfere with living.
But every now and then some impish poltergeist seemed to throw a
spanner into the works. Everything went wrong at once: chimneys
smoked, pipes burst, vacuum-cleaners fused, china and glass fell to
pieces, net curtains disintegrated in the wash. Nannie sprained her
ankle, the cook got tonsilitis, the house-parlourmaid left to be
married, and the butterfly nut off the mincing-machine was nowhere
to be found.</p>

<p>At such times, she knew, you must just put on spiritual
dungarees and remain in them until things are running smoothly
again. Every morning you awake to the kind of list which
begins:&mdash;Sink-plug. Ruffle-tape. X-hooks. Glue...and
ends:&mdash;Ring plumber. Get sweep. Curse laundry. Your horizon
contracts, your mind's eye is focused upon a small circle of
exasperating detail. Sterility sets in; the hatches of your mind
are battened down. Your thoughts, once darling companions, turn
into club bores, from which only sleep can bring release. When you
are in this state, to be kept waiting for half an hour in somebody
else's house is nothing but the purest joy. At home the footstool
limps, legless, thirsting for its glue; the curtain material lies
virginally unruffled; the laundry, unconscious of your displeasure,
dozes peacefully at Acton: while you yourself are free. Yet you
have not played truant: truancy has been thrust upon you, thanks to
the fact that elderly professors so obligingly live up to their
reputation for absent-mindedness.</p>

<p>She leant back in Badger's armchair and prepared to let her mind
stray wherever it liked. But it had got into spiritless habits,
like a dog which has been kept on a lead, and for several minutes
it would do nothing but potter about sniffing at the kind of object
it had grown accustomed to. There was a handle, it informed her,
missing from Badger's desk; the bookcase had a cracked pane, and
the glass finger-plate on the door was hanging by a single screw.
Look here, said Mrs. Miniver, haven't I had enough of this sort of
thing lately? Run away and bring me something interesting. That's
what any decent mind ought to do for its owner when she lets it off
the leash&mdash;just go bounding away into the long grass and bring
back a really profound thought, laying it at her feet all furry and
palpitating. C'mon, now. Hey los'!</p>

<p>Her gaze wandered to the floor. The hearth-rug was an old Khelim
strip, threadbare but still glowing. Its border was made up of a
row of small lozenges, joined by their acute angles. Beginning on
the extreme left, she let her eye run idly along this row, naming
the colours to herself as she came to them. Blue, purple, red.
Blue, purple, re&mdash;but here she was checked, for the second red
was different from the first. So she had to begin again. Blue,
purple, scarlet. Blue, purple, crimson. Blue, purple, sc&mdash;,
but here was yet a third red, which made the first one look almost
orange. Blue, purple, flame, then. Blue, purple, crimson. Blue,
purple, scarlet...</p>

<p>And this, it occurred to her, is one of the things that make
life so difficult. The linked experiences of which it is composed
appear to you one at a time; it is therefore impossible to gauge
their relative significance. In how much detail ought you to notice
each one before it slips into the past? Will "red" do, or must you
cudgel your brains for a more exact description, hesitating between
claret and magenta, vermilion and cardinal? This grief, that joy,
this interview, that relationship, this motor-smash, that
picnic&mdash;can you weigh it up once for all and assign to it a
fixed position in your scale of memories, or will you sooner or
later be forced to take it out again and reclassify it? This dusty
and tedious little patch of time&mdash;could she safely label it
"drab" and have done with it, or would she find herself one day
living through a period so relentlessly subfusc that this present
lozenge would seem, by contrast, gay?</p>

<p>The door opened and Badger came in. His beard arrived first, his
eyebrows next, then the rest of his vast yet twinkling bulk.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'm a little late," he said. It was five minutes
past two.</p>

<h2>ON THE RIVER</h2>

<p>"Water-rat," said Vin, jerking his head in the direction of the
bank. His mother looked round just in time to see the bright eyes
and sleek furry body before it disappeared behind a clump of
reeds.</p>

<p>"Oof!" said Clem. "Let's take it a bit easier. You're in
training and I'm not. I'd forgotten how far it was to Aunt Hetty's
by river."</p>

<p>"It's only about a mile now," said Vin, slacking off a little.
Mrs. Miniver, lying back and trailing one hand in the water,
wondered what Vin thought of, consciously or subconsciously, when
he said the word "mile." Probably the stretch of road between the
house and the village at his grandfather's; that was where they had
spent most of their summer holidays when he was small, before they
bought Starlings. "It's just a mile to the post office," somebody
was certain to have said in his hearing: so that from then onwards,
for the rest of his life, all his miles would be measured against
that one. Judy's private mile, most likely, was the cart-track
through the fields from Starlings to Brickwall Farm&mdash;her
favourite walk. Toby's might be this, too, eventually, but Toby was
not yet mile-conscious. He still measured his distances by true and
not by artificial reckoning: he knew quite well that Brickwall Farm
was a long way off when you were tired and no distance at all when
you weren't. It was the same with time. "Ten minutes," for Mrs.
Miniver herself, would always mean the length of the mid-morning
break in her lessons with her first governess; and "an hour" was
the formal time after tea in her grandmother's drawing-room, in a
clean frock and sash.</p>

<p>Aunt Hetty was sitting in her summer-house at the water's edge,
knitting a sock and keeping a look-out for them. They moored the
boat at her little landing-stage and stepped ashore.</p>

<p>"My dears! Lovely to see you," said Aunt Hetty, rolling up her
wool and impaling the ball on her needles as though she was
skewering a piece of mutton to make a shashlik. "Come
along&mdash;we're having tea in the strawberry-bed."</p>

<p>"In the strawberry-bed?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It's a new idea that occurred to me last time Vin was
here. You know how much better they always taste when you eat them
straight off the plants? Only the drawback is, there's never any
cream and sugar. So I thought, why not take the cream and sugar
under the nets with us? We tried it, and it's a capital plan. I
can't imagine why I never thought of it before." She took Vin's arm
and led the way across the lawn. The others followed, exchanging
telegraphically, with a smile, their amused affection for Aunt
Hetty. Glorious woman: nobody else would have had an idea like
that&mdash;or rather, nobody else would have put it seriously and
efficiently into practice, complete with table, chairs, silver
tea-pot, and cucumber sandwiches. She had even had the nets
heightened on poles to give more head-room.</p>

<p>When tea was over, Vin took Clem off to show him the place where
he had hooked (but lost) a monster trout the week before. With any
luck, he said, it might still be there.</p>

<p>"Sure to be," said Clem. "I don't mind betting it's the same one
I used to see. They're immortal, these Thames trout."</p>

<p>Mrs. Miniver and Aunt Hetty strolled down to the summer-house
again.</p>

<p>"My supply of great-nephews is running low," said Aunt Hetty,
unskewering the shashlik. "Margaret's youngest boy leaves at the
end of this half, and then I shall only have Vin. And when he
leaves, I suppose there'll be a two years' gap before Toby
comes."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so. Although from a financial point of view that's
rather a relief."</p>

<p>Aunt Hetty snorted.</p>

<p>"From an aunt's point of view it's unpardonable. Between the lot
of you, you ought to have arranged things better. What on earth
d'you think I'm here for, I should like to know?"</p>

<p>To be a pattern and example to all aunts, thought Mrs. Miniver;
to be a delight to boys and a comfort to their parents; and to show
that at least one daughter in every generation ought to remain
unmarried, raise the profession of auntship to a fine art, and make
a point of having a house within the five-mile limit, preferably
between Boveney and Queen's Eyot.</p>

<p>Aunt Hetty threw a piece of cake to a swan. She always brought
some down for them after tea.</p>

<p>"Not that I like swans," she admitted. "But they're one's
neighbours, and I think it's best to keep in with them."</p>

<p>"I know. Conceited brutes. They always look as though they'd
just been reading their own fan-mail."</p>

<p>It was not long before the others came back. They had seen the
trout, and Clem swore that it had looked up and given him a leer of
recognition.</p>

<p>"We'll have to be going," said Vin regretfully. "There isn't a
Queen's Eyot Absence to-day, worse luck."</p>

<p>Looking back as they rounded the next bend of the river, they
could see Aunt Hetty still waving good-bye to them, sock in hand,
the sun glinting on her needles.</p>

<p>It had been a lovely afternoon, thought Mrs. Miniver as they
moved smoothly downstream between the low green banks. In most
parts of England this was the season of the year that she liked the
least&mdash;this ripe, sultry time when the trees were no longer
jade but malachite, and the hedges looked almost black against the
pale parched fields. In the country round Starlings, especially,
spring was the real apex of the year. Summer was bathos,
degringolade: one waited longingly for autumn, which would bring
back colour and magic. But in this sort of landscape, high summer
was the perfect time. Here, the grass of the water-meadows was
fresh, cool, and green; the steady onward sweep of the river, the
quivering reflections in its depths and the play of light on its
surface, gave movement and variety, so that one felt none of that
brooding stillness which mars July in unwatered countrysides. Even
the rank and ramping vegetation of summer (such a come-down, in
most places, after the delicate miraculous experiments of spring)
seemed here to be superbly appropriate, like large jewellery on a
fine, bold, handsome woman. Down by the water's edge there were
coarse clumps of comfrey and fig-wort, hemp agrimony and giant
dock; on the banks, a tangle of vetch and convolvulus,
moon-daisies, yarrow, and bedstraw; while from higher up still came
the heavy, heady sweetness of elder flowers.</p>

<p>"Gosh!" said Vin suddenly, after a long spell of silence. "Long
Leave's the end of next week. This half seems to have gone most
frightfully quick."</p>

<p>"Summer halves do," said Clem.</p>

<h2>LEFT AND RIGHT</h2>

<p>The conversation at dinner had been so heated that by the end of
it Mrs. Miniver had developed mental, moral, and physical
indigestion. Teresa Frant, usually a brilliant mixer of unlikely
human ingredients, had experimented for once a little too boldly.
Or perhaps (for one never knew with Teresa) she had done it out of
mischief. She had never had any use for her rich diehard
sister-in-law Agnes Lingfield; but if she really wanted to bait her
she could have chosen a more effective, because less far-fetched,
opponent than little Neish. For in addition to the personal
antipathy which had struck almost visible sparks from their
finger-tips at the moment of introduction, these two people were so
irrevocably separated by race, class, age, sex, religion, politics,
and cast of mind that it seemed absurd to classify them both as
human beings. The Zoo authorities had clearly put one or the other
of them into the wrong cage. Therefore the argument which had
sprung up between them during dinner had ended by being not so much
a duel as a brawl: and while duels with food are both entertaining
and eupeptic, brawls are neither.</p>

<p>It began by Lady Lingfield turning to Neish and saying through
impalpable lorgnettes, "I hear you're one of these Layba people:
I've always wondered what it feels like to be a Socialist." To
which Neish replied with savage dryness: "Mebbe ye'd better j'st
try it some time and see?" Oh dear, oh dear, thought Mrs. Miniver;
from that moment on she resigned herself to a headache, and got it.
Silly of Teresa. She herself, if Teresa had asked her to, could
have battled with Agnes far more effectively, because from a closer
range. But between a woman who thought that for her kitchenmaid to
use face-powder was the beginning of Bolshevism, and a man who
believed that the 30-mile speed limit was the thin end of the
Totalitarian wedge, there could be no useful interchange of
ideas.</p>

<p>Besides, Mrs. Miniver was beginning to feel more than a little
weary of exchanging ideas (especially political ones) and of
hearing other people exchange theirs. It's all very well, she
reflected, when the ideas have had time to flower, or at least to
bud, so that we can pick them judiciously, present them with a bow,
and watch them unfold in the warmth of each other's understanding:
but there is far too much nowadays of pulling up the wretched
little things just to see how they are growing. Half the verbal
sprigs we hand each other are nothing but up-ended rootlets, earthy
and immature: left longer in the ground they might have come to
something, but once they are exposed we seldom manage to replant
them. It is largely the fault, no doubt, of the times we live in.
Things happen too quickly, crisis follows crisis, the soil of our
minds is perpetually disturbed. Each of us, to relieve his
feelings, broadcasts his own running commentary on the preposterous
and bewildering events of the hour: and this, nowadays, is what
passes for conversation. For once in a way Mrs. Miniver felt glad
when her hostess, with a scythe-like sweep of the eye, mowed down
the women and carried them off (unprotesting Sabines) to the
drawing-room. Agnes Lingfield, her very shoulder-blades expressing
a sense of outrage, preceded the others up the stairs and retired
at once, in rather marked silence, to powder her nose.</p>

<p>"Teresa, you are very naughty. How could you?"</p>

<p>"Put Neish next to Agnes? My dear, she's a joke woman; cross
between a Wallis Mills and a Helen Hokinson. She's got fatty
degeneration of the soul. Do her a lot of good to be shaken
up."</p>

<p>"Up to a point, yes. But not quite so violently as that. It's
probably made her think that everybody who is even faintly
progressive is like Neish. And it's certainly made him think that
everybody who doesn't belong to the extreme Left is like Agnes. I
shall have to spend the rest of the evening trying to convince him
that they aren't."</p>

<p>"Do, darling," said Teresa impenitently. "That'll be just your
line. As a matter of fact," she added, "I very much doubt whether
people like Neish and Agnes ever think at all. They just feel."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Mrs. Miniver. "They do both, I'm certain. But the
trouble is, they keep the two processes entirely separate. They've
never learnt to think with their hearts or feel with their
minds."</p>

<p>"That sounds grand," said Teresa ironically (they were old
friends). "Does it mean anything, or were you just trying it out to
see what it sounded like?"</p>

<p>"It either means nothing at all," said Mrs. Miniver, "or else
it's the discovery of the century. I'll think it over and let you
know."</p>

<p>Agnes Lingfield came back into the room, her face more nearly
matt but her eyes still gleaming.</p>

<p>"Well, Teresa. I must say, your Left-wing friends..."</p>

<p>Oh, Lord, thought Mrs. Miniver, we're off again; and, anyway,
I'm sick and tired of being offered nothing but that same old
choice. Left wing...Right wing...it's so limited; why doesn't it
ever occur to any of them that what one is really longing for is
the wishbone?</p>

<p>"</p>

<h2>DOING A MOLE"</h2>

<p>Mrs. Miniver, having dropped the younger children at the seaside
bungalow where they were going to stay with a school friend of
Judy's, decided to spend an hour in the neighbouring town before
driving back to London. It was to this town that she had been sent
for a fortnight every year as a small child, and she felt a sudden
desire to do a Mole. ("Doing a Mole" was Vin's phrase&mdash;coined
after reading The Wind in the Willows&mdash;for a revisitation of
old haunts.)</p>

<p>Having parked the car, she walked along the front in the fresh
dancing sunlight. This part of the town was almost
unrecognizable&mdash;a street of angular lettering and neon strips,
with ice-cream tricycles instead of the old painted hokey-pokey
barrows. As for the children's clothes&mdash;she tried to imagine
what her old nurse would have said if she had wanted to walk from
their lodgings to the beach in a wisp of a cotton sun-suit. She
herself had worn no fewer than ten separate garments, including
woollen combinations (folded thickly above the knee because they
were too long) and baggy blue serge knickers into which all the
rest of her clothes were tucked when she paddled, so that her
shadow on the sand was always that of a gnome. Even in the sea she
had worn blue serge, and on cold days a white Shetland spencer on
top of her bathing-dress. She could still remember what it felt
like when her nurse pulled it off over her wrists, wet.</p>

<p>At the pier she stopped and leant over the railings, hardly
daring to draw a breath for fear of not finding what she was hoping
for. She gave a cautious sniff, and then a luxurious one. It was
all right. Evidently the most progressive of Town Councils could
not do away with the peculiar, complex, deliciously nasty smell
which is to be found under piers around high-water mark; a mixture
of salt, rust, and slime, of rotting seaweed, dead limpets, and
dried orange-peel. For a few moments, breathing it in, Mrs. Miniver
could almost hear the creaking of her nurse's stays as she settled
her broad back against the breakwater for the afternoon.</p>

<p>But presently the sight of a concert-party announcement brought
her back again to the present day: for the name she read there was
that of a sophisticated ensemble which she had often heard on the
wireless. This was a far cry from the seaside entertainments of her
childhood&mdash;the slightly shop-soiled-looking pierrots, and the
sham nigger minstrels with straw hats, banjos, and bones.</p>

<p>It was one of these, curiously enough, who had first introduced
her to death. He sang a song which began:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>What's (plonk!) the use (plonk!) of saving up your
money,<br>
If you can't take it with you when you die?
(plink-plonk!)</blockquote>

<p>and ended:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>But if (plonk!) you've got (plonk!) a wart upon your
nose,<br>
Well, you must take it with you when you die
(plink-plonk!)</blockquote>

<p>This, for some reason, pierced her to the heart with a shaft of
realization. She burst into tears and flung herself across her
nurse's grey tweed lap. "I don't want to die!" she sobbed. "Oh,
Nannie, I don't ever want to die!" The nurse, horrified, picked her
up and carried her out of the pavilion. "There, there," she kept
saying helplessly; "there, there." And that night she gave her a
dose of magnesia.</p>

<p>Just beyond the pier Mrs. Miniver turned up a steep, curved
street with a church in it. This was where their lodgings had been.
She had no idea of the number, but she felt certain she would know
the house when she came to it. Here again her nose had a good
memory, for a breath of sickly-sweet scent brought her to a sudden
standstill. Of course: she had quite forgotten about the privet
hedge. And with that memory came another: there had been four panes
of coloured glass in the middle of the front door&mdash;green, red,
yellow, and blue. Looking through them in turn from the hall, you
could make it be whatever season you liked in the front
garden&mdash;spring, summer, autumn, or winter: but when you opened
the door there was never anything but the hard white glare of July.
She pushed the gate open and walked quietly up the path, to make
sure whether those coloured panes were still there. They were: but
as she bent down (she had once stood on tiptoe) to look at them,
the door was opened by a woman with a shopping basket on her
arm.</p>

<p>"Oh!" Mrs. Miniver tried to look self-possessed. "I was just
going to ring. I&mdash;I'm looking for rooms. But if you're going
out, it doesn't matter a bit."</p>

<p>"No trouble," said the landlady. So Mrs. Miniver had to go
through with it, peering into room after room. In the second floor
front she paused and looked round very carefully.</p>

<p>"This is a nice one," she said. "So big and airy." But she was
thinking, How low, how small; how time contracts the rooms of one's
childhood, drawing the walls inwards and the ceilings down. What
with the shrinkage and the redecoration (for now, of course, it had
a porridgy modern wallpaper with an orange frieze) she would not
have known it was the same room, if it hadn't been for the
fireplace. This, she was relieved to see, was untouched. There was
the same ornate ironwork, the same rather bad imitation Dutch
tiles; and the lowest tile on the left was still loose. By wiggling
it gently, she had discovered, you could slip this tile right out
and put it back again; and once, on their last day, she had dug a
hole in the plaster behind it with her nurse's nail-scissors and
hidden a new farthing, in order to have some buried treasure to
look for the next time they came. But there had been no next
time.</p>

<p>"I wonder," she thought, eyeing the loose tile&mdash;but no, it
was ridiculous, things didn't happen like that. Besides, one really
couldn't...</p>

<p>"There now!" said the landlady. "That's the bell. Excuse me a
moment."</p>

<p>Mrs. Miniver made a bee-line for the fireplace, knelt down and
wiggled gently. Her heart was thumping: she knew now what burglars
must go through. The tile came out quite easily: the hole was still
there, but the farthing was gone. She slipped the tile back, stood
up, and managed to get her knees dusted just before the landlady
reached the top of the stairs.</p>

<p>Afterwards, walking down the steep street towards the beach, she
thought about that farthing with an absurd and unreasonable pang.
It would have made such a wonderful ending to her Mole. But she was
comforted when she imagined with what incredulous delight some
later child, exploring, must have found it.</p>

<h2>THE NEW DIMENSION</h2>

<p>It may or may not be true that conscience makes people cowardly:
but it was certainly sea-sickness that made Mrs. Miniver brave, so
far as air travel was concerned. Though you can hardly claim to be
brave, she told herself ashamedly as she fastened the safety-strap
across her knees, if your inside feels like curds and whey and your
mouth is as dry as pumice. Resigned was a more suitable word for
her state of mind. She had always had an exaggerated dread of the
air: the reassuring statistics in the newspapers made no difference
to her whatever. She was ready to admit that flying was safer than
driving a car or crossing a crowded street; but she was
irrationally convinced that if she herself went up in an aeroplane
it was perfectly certain to crash. If it be not safe for me, she
said in effect, what care I how safe it be? And so far neither the
enthusiasm of her air-minded contemporaries, nor the calm
assumption by the younger generation that it was the only possible
way to travel, had ever been able to tempt her into the sky.</p>

<p>But, as every human being knows (for that term automatically
excludes anybody who is "a perfect sailor"), there are some sea
journeys which can revolutionize all your feelings about death: and
one of these is a crossing in bad weather from Kyle of Lochalsh to
the Outer Isles. Mrs. Miniver had had the misfortune, ten days
before, to coincide with a summer gale: and, crawling weakly ashore
at Lochmaddy, she had sworn that nothing would induce her to cross
the Little Minch again, unless the weather changed.</p>

<p>The weather did change, of course. The wind dropped suddenly.
For more than a week the days were hot and still, the water lapped
gently, the narrow sickles of sand between the headlands shone
white in the sunlight and whiter under the moon. The smaller
islands looked like water-lily leaves floating on a pool. The sea,
all day, was blue; but at sunset it was stained and streaked with
rose, crimson, and purple, as though some long-foundered ship with
a cargo of wine had suddenly broken open in its depths. But the
evening before she was due to leave, the wind rose as suddenly as
it had fallen. It blew and rained hard all night, and although by
next morning the sun was out again the sea was still heaving
unattractively. Mrs. Miniver took one look at it and wired to
Sollas Airport. It seemed to be the only thing to do; unless indeed
she was prepared to spend the rest of her life in the Hebrides,
nostalgically beholding in dreams the King's Road, Chelsea.</p>

<p>Peering out of the small rhomboidal window of the plane, she
wished, first, that some other passengers would come, to give her
confidence; and, second, that no other passengers would come, so
that her poltroonery might be unobserved. For her face, she felt
certain, must by now be noticeably green.</p>

<p>It seemed as though her second wish at any rate was going to be
granted, for there were only two minutes to go and she was still
alone. But at the last moment a ramshackle pony-cart came down the
road at full canter, and an enormous farmer, followed by a young
sheep-dog, clambered into the plane. He turned at the door, shouted
something in Gaelic to the woman who drove the cart, and lowered
himself gingerly into a seat which seemed far too frail to hold
him. The dog, with vast unconcern, curled up on the floor and went
to sleep.</p>

<p>"I thought I would be loossing the plane," observed the farmer
pleasantly. "It wass my watch that wass fall-ty." He tugged out an
old silver turnip and adjusted it with care.</p>

<p>"Do you often fly?" asked Mrs. Miniver. He looked so
marvellously incongruous.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;yess." He seemed mildly surprised at the question. "I
have a brother in Barra. It iss very convenient." His
matter-of-factness was reassuring; and she needed reassurance
badly, for the plane was now lumbering forward over the rough grass
of the landing-field.</p>

<p>"This is my first flight," she yelled above the noise of the
engines. She felt rather desperately that she had to tell somebody.
"As a matter of fact, I'm scared stiff." She smiled, to pretend she
was exaggerating; but she knew that she wasn't. "I suppose," she
added, "I shan't mind so much when it's actually up."</p>

<p>"But it iss up," said the farmer. And sure enough, looking out
of the window, she saw that the incredible had happened. They were
in the air. She could see the rocky headlands edged with a white
frill of foam; the deserted crofts, the drystone dykes, the green
ridge-and-furrow of the lazy-beds whose only harvest nowadays was
the wild iris; and, as they gained height, the whole extraordinary
pattern of North Uist, so netted and fretted with lochs that it
looked like a piece of lace.</p>

<p>Some hours later, in the train between Glasgow and Stirling, she
tried to sort out her impressions. How hopelessly people fail, she
thought, when they try to describe flying to someone who has never
done it. They leave out all the really important things. They tell
you that it saves time and (taking everything into account) money;
they tell you that it makes the earth look like a map, cows like
ants, and cars like beetles. But they don't tell you that it is
staggering, tremendous; that it is not merely an experience but a
re-birth; that it gives you for the first time in your life the
freedom of a new dimension (for although we know that there are
three of them, we are forced to move mainly in two: so that our
sense of up-and-downness is necessarily dim and undeveloped
compared with our acute perception of the to-and-fro). They don't
tell you that when you are up there it is the aeroplane that seems
to be the safe solid core of things, while the earth is a distant
planet upon which unfamiliar beings move among unthinkable dangers.
They don't tell you, either, that you will be torn all the time
between an immense arrogance and an immense humility, so that you
are at one moment God and at the next a nameless sparrow. Nor do
they tell you what it feels like to thread your way among the noble
and exciting architecture of the clouds; nor how&mdash;best of
all&mdash;you may suddenly find a rainbow arched across the tip of
your wing, as though you had caught it in passing and carried it
along with you.</p>

<p>If only they had told her these things, she would have flown
long ago: for the promise of so much enchantment would have
overcome fear.</p>

<h2>LONDON IN AUGUST</h2>

<p>The woman at the far end of the Park seat kept on nervously
twisting and untwisting her handkerchief as though in acute mental
distress. She was muttering to herself, too, under her breath. Mrs.
Miniver glanced at her sideways once or twice, wondering what was
wrong and wishing there was something she could do about it; but
all of a sudden the woman, noticing her glances, looked up and
smiled quite cheerfully.</p>

<p>"It's me First Aid," she explained. "I do get so muddled up with
them knots. The lecturer, she says, 'Right over left, left over
right,' see? But it never seems to come out the same, not when I do
it meself."</p>

<p>"I wonder," suggested Mrs. Miniver tentatively, "whether you'd
find it any easier if you thought about it as 'back and
front'?"</p>

<p>The woman experimented with this idea for a few moments, and
then her brow cleared as if by magic.</p>

<p>"Well, that's funny! So it is! It all depends on how you look at
things, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>She laid the knotted handkerchief on the palm of her hand and
beamed at it as proudly as though she had just made a successful
cake. Oh, well, thought Mrs. Miniver; even if no other good comes
out of the present condition of the world, at least there soon
won't be a person left in England who doesn't know how to tie a
reef-knot. And that's always something.</p>

<p>"I must say," the other woman confided, "I do enjoy me First Aid
classes. It's like being back at school again&mdash;makes you feel
quite young."</p>

<p>"I know," said Mrs. Miniver. Yes, she thought, that's the whole
point. That is the one great compensation for the fantastic way in
which the events of our time are forcing us to live. The structure
of our life&mdash;based as it is on the ever-present contingency of
war&mdash;is lamentably wrong: but its texture, oddly enough, is
pleasant. There is a freshness about, a kind of rejuvenation: and
this is largely because almost everybody you meet is busy learning
something. Whereas in ordinary times the majority of grown-up
people never try to acquire any new skill at all, either mental or
physical: which is why they are apt to seem, and feel, so old.</p>

<p>She looked at her watch, got up, and walked on towards
Kensington Gardens, where Clem had said he would meet her for tea
if he could. His latest job was a big new school on Campden Hill
which had to be finished early in September: this gave him a
reason, and Mrs. Miniver an excellent excuse, for spending a good
deal of August in London. The children were away, and so were the
maids; Mrs. Burchett came in every morning to do their breakfast,
and they had the rest of their meals out.</p>

<p>London in August, Mrs. Miniver had long ago discovered, is bleak
in theory but enjoyable in practice. For one thing, your circle of
acquaintances, without any of the pangs of bereavement or
estrangement, is arbitrarily reduced to half its normal size, with
some interesting results. You find yourself knowing better, quite
suddenly, people with whom you have been at a standstill for years;
understudies blossom into stars; even boaks occasionally reveal an
unsuspected jewel in the head. And the town itself too, has a
strange charm, in spite of the shuttered houses, the empty
window-boxes, the dusty plane-trees, and the smell of hot asphalt.
Or perhaps, in a way, because of these. For young Johnny Flint
(whose poems, she noticed, had lately been getting more personal
and less political) had said yesterday that anybody who had a
genuine passion for London got a particular pleasure out of being
there at this time of year, "as you do out of being with somebody
you're really in love with when they're looking very tired and
rather plain." So that was it. Thank goodness, Mrs. Miniver had
thought, as she always did when any of her friends came into love
or money. She wondered idly who it could be, but knew that with
poets this didn't really matter. Beatrice, Fanny Brawne, Ann More,
the Dark Lady of the Sonnets&mdash;they are all one and the same
person: or perhaps no person at all. Happy or unhappy, kind or
unkind, they are nothing but bundles of firewood.</p>

<blockquote>And it will matter little, in after days,<br>
Whether this twig, or that, kindled the blaze.</blockquote>

<p>It was four o'clock. This was the hour when at any other time of
year the great tide of perambulators, which is drawn up into the
Park twice a day by some invisible and unvarying moon, would have
been on the ebb. They would have been streaming steadily out
through every gateway, back to the nursery tea-tables of Bayswater,
Kensington, Brompton, Belgravia and Mayfair: sleek, shining,
graceful, expensive perambulators, well-built, well-sprung,
well-upholstered, pushed by well-trained nurses and occupied by
well-bred, well-fed children. What that woman at the luncheon-party
had called Really Nice Children: the sort of children who had
rocking-horses, and special furniture with rabbits on it, and hats
and coats that matched, and grandmothers with houses in the
country. But in August the shores of the Park were forsaken by this
tide, and another one took its place. They straggled over the worn,
slippery grass in little processions&mdash;whey-faced, thin,
ragged, merry and shrewd. The boys carried nets and jam-jars. The
eldest girl, almost always, was lugging a dilapidated push-chair
with an indeterminate baby in it; and sometimes an ex-baby as well,
jammy-mouthed and lolling over the edge.</p>

<p>These were the other children. With any luck, if there was a war
before they grew up, they would one day see cows, and running
streams, and growing corn. But not otherwise. Unless, of course, a
miracle happened; unless the structure could be changed without
altering the texture, and the people of England, even after the
necessity for it had been averted, remembered how to tie a
reef-knot.</p>

<h2>BACK FROM ABROAD</h2>

<p>"<i>Partir, c'est mourir un peu...</i>" How shrewdly the French
language can drive home a nail, thought Mrs. Miniver, seeing again
in her mind's eye the row of smiling faces to which she had waved a
regretful good-bye, the evening before, from the window of the
little Alpine train. At her sister-in-law's request she had
travelled out with her niece Alison, who was going to spend six
months living with a Swiss family; and she had stayed on for a week
at a pension in the same village, just to see that Alison was
happily established. The whole family had come to see her off at
the station. The solitary porter, standing beside his yellow toy
barrow, had had a grass stalk between his teeth; and the moon, just
topping the Mittelhorn, had looked for the space of a breath or two
like a vast snow-ball which was about to roll down the glacier.</p>

<p>But why, she wondered, as the serene but unjoyful landscape of
northern France slid past the dining-car windows&mdash;the white
horses, the dun cattle, the red farms, the grey shutters, the
beaded cemeteries, the hedgeless fields like foreheads without
eyebrows&mdash;why has nobody ever made the parallel observation:
"<i>Revenir, c'est savoir ce que c'est que d'&ecirc;tre un
revenant</i>"? That would be no less shrewd: for when you first
come home from a strange place you are always something of a ghost.
They were sorry when you went away, and they welcome you back with
affection: but in the meanwhile they have adjusted their lives a
little to your absence. For the first meal or two, there is not
quite enough room for your chair. They ask, "Where did you go? What
was it like?"; but for the life of you you cannot tell them. You
can say, "It was like a large, neat Scotland"; or "They use
<i>nonante</i> instead of <i>quatre-vingt-dix</i>"; or, "They trim
all their buildings with wooden lace"; or, "There was a nice little
German boy staying at the pension"; or "I made friends with a
charming farmer at the village f&ecirc;te." But however eagerly
they listen they do not really take in what you are saying. For you
cannot make them understand the essential point, which is that when
you went away you took the centre of the universe with you, so that
the whole thing went on revolving, just as usual, round your own
head. How could they, indeed, be expected to believe this, when
they know quite well that all the time the centre of everything
stayed at home with them? It is a day or two, as a rule, before
your universe and theirs (like the two images in a photographic
range-finder) merge and become concentric: and when that happens,
you know you are really home.</p>

<p>But that moment, for Mrs. Miniver, was still far ahead. She had
not even quite detached herself yet from the place she had just
left. Like the earth-bound spirit of one who has recently died, she
still thought in terms of the life she had been leading. Glancing
up at the clock of the dining-car, she reflected: "Hansi's mother
will just be tying the napkin round his neck; and he will be saying
'<i>Bit-te, Mama, keinen Blumenkohl</i>.'" The first time she had
heard him say this she had caught his mother's eye and smiled: for
the tone and the sentiment were so exactly Toby's. She had smiled,
too, when she overheard at breakfast the so familiar question:
"<i>Aber du, Hansi, hast du dir die Z&auml;hne gut geputzt?</i>"
But she had done more than smile when Hansi, after a day or two's
distant politeness, had taken her by the hand and led her to a row
of curiously-shaped pebbles in a secret hiding-place between the
wood-stacks.</p>

<p>"<i>Meine Sammlung</i>," he said briefly. "My c'lection," echoed
Toby's voice in her memory. Her heart turned over: how could there
be this ridiculous talk of war, when little boys in all countries
collected stones, dodged cleaning their teeth, and hated
cauliflower?</p>

<p>Indeed, what always struck her when she went abroad was how much
stronger the links are between people of the same calling than
between people of the same race: especially if it is a calling
which has more truck with the laws of nature than with the laws of
man. The children of the world are one nation; the very old,
another; the blind, a third: (for childhood, age and blindness are
all callings, and hard ones at that). A man who works with wood, a
man who works with iron, a man who works with test-tubes, is more
akin to a joiner, a smith, a research chemist from the other end of
the earth than to a clerk or a shopkeeper in his own town. A
fisherman from Ushant and a fisherman from Stornoway are both
citizens of the same relentless country; and Nicollier, the farmer
with whom Mrs. Miniver had made friends at the village f&ecirc;te,
had expressed in a different tongue precisely the same feelings and
opinion as Tom (Brickwall) Iggulsden.</p>

<p>If only, she thought, sipping her black coffee, one could
somehow get them together&mdash;not the statesmen and the
diplomats, but Toby and Hansi, Iggulsden and Nicollier. If only all
governments would spend the price of a few bombers on exchanging
for the holidays, free of charge, a certain number of families from
each district...</p>

<p>The attendant brought her bill. She paid it, burying her last
thought as a dog buries a bone, to be returned to later. They had
passed Boulogne now and were on the last lap of the journey to
Calais. As one does when there are only a few minutes to go and it
is not worth while embarking on anything new, she let her gaze
wander round the carriage, idly seeking the titillation of the
printed word. On the window sill she read:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><i>Ne pas se pencher en dehors.<br>
Nicht hinauslehnen.<br>
E pericoloso sporgersi.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly, she thought. "What I tell you three times is true." But
the trouble was, it still had to be said in three different
languages...</p>

<h2>AT THE HOP-PICKING</h2>

<p>Brickwall Farm consisted mostly of fruit and pasture: so few
acres were under hops that Tom Iggulsden did not engage any
professional pickers from London. He did the picking himself with
the aid of his wife, his mother, his five children, and any of the
neighbours who cared to lend a hand: which generally included the
whole Miniver family.</p>

<p>This time the Minivers were enjoying it even more than usual.
Before, they had always been mere casual helpers, doing it for fun
and leaving off whenever they felt inclined. But this year they
knew that Tom Iggulsden was really counting on them, for he was
short of his three best workers. Both his sons had been called up,
and his eldest daughter Ivy had gone off to try and get a job in a
munition factory.</p>

<p>Old Mrs. Iggulsden, who was picking into the same bin as Mrs.
Miniver, disapproved of Ivy's behaviour and was saying so with some
force.</p>

<p>"She never 'ad naow sanse, diddn' Ive. Gooin' arf jus' 'fore de
'aapin', 'an leavin' 'er Dad short'anded...Reckon I'd 've prin'nigh
flawed 'er alive, if I'd 'a' bin Taam."</p>

<p>"Now den, Ma," said Tom Iggulsden with a grin, stretching up his
long-poled knife to cut down a bine. He laid the thick twisted swag
of greenery across the canvas bin and winked at Mrs. Miniver behind
his mother's back.</p>

<p>"You git aan wid y'r owan jaab, Ma, an' leave Ivy be. If she
rackoned she ought to goo, she 'ad to goo, diddn' she?"</p>

<p>"I don' see naow sort o' sanse in it," mumbled the old woman,
quite unconvinced. "She'd be doin' more good a-pickin' o' dese 'ere
'aaps fer to goo into folk's bellies, dan a'makin' o' dem old
bullets fer to goo into deir 'eads."</p>

<p>Tom Iggulsden's wife, overhearing this from the next bin, shot
an apologetic glance at Mrs. Miniver. She had a light hand with
pastry but was a little inclined to be genteel; and her
mother-in-law's robustness of speech often made her uncomfortable,
especially in front of "foreigners."</p>

<p>"Of course," put in Mrs. Miniver diplomatically, "some people
would try to make out that hops were nearly as bad as bullets.
Teetotallers, I mean."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;dem!" said old Mrs. Iggulsden with royal scorn. She
stripped off her next handful of cones almost vindictively: they
fell into the half-full bin without a sound, light, soft and
ghostly, a dozen little severed heads of teetotallers.</p>

<p>Presently there came the familiar cry of the bin-man, who walked
round every so often to ladle the hops out into ten-bushel
pokes.</p>

<p>"Git your 'aaps ready, please!"</p>

<p>Warned of his approach, they left off picking and set to work to
clear out all the odd leaves and pieces of stalk which had dropped
in by mistake. This was the part that the children enjoyed most,
because it meant leaning right over the edge and plunging one's
arms elbow-deep into the feathery goldy-green mass.</p>

<p>The role of bin-man, this year, was played by Tom Iggulsden
himself, in the intervals of cutting down bines; and his assistant,
who held the mouth of the poke open, was Vin. When the two of them
arrived everybody stopped working and tried to guess how many
measures there would be in the bin.</p>

<p>"Twalve, I rackon," said old Mrs. Iggulsden.</p>

<p>"Fifteen," said Judy hopefully. But Tom, taking the first scoop
with his wicker basket, said "Thirteen." And thirteen it turned out
to be.</p>

<p>It was certainly a relief to knock off for a bit, to straighten
one's back and stretch out one's fingers. They had been going hard
at it ever since lunch-time, with the effortless industry which is
born of working with good company, in pleasant surroundings, at a
perceptibly progressing task. It was like knitting: you couldn't
bear to stop until you had done one more row, one more bine. But it
was also like watching the sea come in on a calm day, as the soft
green tide crept steadily up the brown cliffs of the bin.</p>

<p>Old Mrs. Iggulsden reached under her stool for a bottle and took
a generous swig.</p>

<p>"Ma...!" said her daughter-in-law, going through hell.</p>

<p>"'Aaps outside needs 'aaps inside," said the old woman
cheerfully. "Ain't that right, Mrs. Miniver?" She wiped her mouth
on the back of her hand. Her briar-root fingers, which could still
strip a bine more quickly than most people's, were stained black
with juice and covered with scratches from the rough clinging
stems. So indeed were everybody's, except for those who were not
too proud to wear gloves. But though gloves could protect one from
stains and scratches, nothing could protect one from the
drowsiness, the nearly irresistible drowsiness, which comes over
all but the most hardened towards the end of a long day's picking.
It seems to be more than a scent that emanates from the hops: it is
almost a visible miasma, sweet yet agreeably acrid, soothing yet
tonic, which blurs the edges of one's thoughts with a greenish-gold
glow.</p>

<p>"Where's Toby?" said Mrs. Miniver suddenly. Nobody knew.</p>

<p>"I 'a'n't seen nothin' of 'im since dinner-time," said Mrs.
Iggulsden. "Ver' like 'e'll be down at the fur bin along o'
Molly."</p>

<p>But he was not at the far bin, nor at any of the others. Mrs.
Miniver, always a little uneasy about the main road, went off to
look for him. It was extraordinary how soon, wandering through the
narrow leafy aisles, one got out of sight of the others. For a
short time their voices followed her: the broad vowels, the clipped
consonants, the unvarying parabolas of the Kentish speech. But from
a few rows further on she could neither see nor hear them. She was
alone in the heart of a silent, orderly jungle; a jungle which was
like one of the most advanced patterns in a gigantic game of cat's
cradle. Wherever she stopped to call or listen for Toby, she found
herself at the converging point of eight green alleys; and from the
root of every plant four strings stretched upwards and outwards to
the wire trellis overhead, each with two bines climbing round it
the way of the sun. (And why, in the name of an inscrutable
providence, should hops always twine with the sun, while scarlet
runners invariably went a-widdershin?)</p>

<p>Getting no answer to her cries, she walked back towards the
pickers. And there, just out of sight of the last bin, lay Toby,
fast asleep on a pile of pokes, with a leafy bine trailing right
across him: a small rosy Bacchus with juice-stained hands. She
smiled, and covered him up with an empty sack. There was no need to
wake him until it was time to go home.</p>

<h2>"FROM NEEDING DANGER"</h2>

<p><i>Starlings</i>, 25th September 1939.</p>

<p><i>Dearest Susan</i>,</p>

<p>Thank you for your long letter. I began one to you the day
before war broke out, but until this evening I haven't had time to
sit down and finish it. And when I re-read it just now it was like
reading a letter by a different person, so much has one's mood
changed in the last few weeks. So I tore it up.</p>

<p>You say, tell you facts and feelings. Well, facts first, they're
easier. Clem's A.A. Battery is quartered in a girls' school, from
which he writes superbly funny letters. The girls are absent, of
course, but their school-stories are there, and he is finding these
a fascinating study. His favourite chapter-heading, so far, is
"Monica Turns Out a Decent Sort"; but at present he is absorbed in
a last-war one about a games mistress who was a spy in disguise and
used to write code messages on tennis-balls and throw them into the
North Sea. He says he can hardly wait to get to the end. He is also
making a collection of graffiti, which are all quite touchingly
mild. Things like "Gwenny T. is a Big Pig" and "Molly B. is a
Brat." There is a very dignified one, which simply says: "I think
Gwenny T. is the most hateful person I have ever met." And another,
arranged like an equation: "Violet W.+ Gwenny T. = Lovey-dovey. Ha!
ha!" Clem says he was so relieved to find that somebody liked poor
Gwenny T. after all.</p>

<p>The children are down here, having the time of their lives with
our seven tough and charming evacuees&mdash;but I'll tell you more
about that next time I write. Mrs. Downce has played up admirably.
I was rather afraid she might be pot-faced, but not a bit of it. To
tell you the truth I think she is delighted to have some Cockney
voices in the house. It makes her feel at home after her
twenty-five years in Darkest Kent. She had quite a
Dr.-Livingstone-I-presume expression on her face when she welcomed
them in.</p>

<p>Ellen (our present incarnation of the cosmic principle of
house-parlourmaid, successor to Gladys, who got married) is down
here, too, helping Nannie and Mrs. D. Mrs. Adie is in London,
sleeping in the kitchen so as not to have to traipse downstairs
when the raid-warning goes. "Well, Madam," she said with a wry
smile, "I never thought I'd live to be glad that I couldna persuade
ye to shift into one o' yon new non-basements. The Lord," she added
solemnly, "doesna seem to care how much trouble He gies Himself in
order to bring us to our senses." I was amused at the time, and
sent Clem an elaborate picture in coloured chalk of guns, tanks,
and aeroplanes charging across Europe, with a jovial bearded face
directing operations from a cloud in the left-hand top corner, and
a repentant Mrs. Adie in the right-hand bottom one. But during the
last fortnight I've begun to feel&mdash;N.B., we are now on to
feelings&mdash;that she may be right, after all. As you know, she
has a real Scots genius for coining phrases, and it is
extraordinary how often they ring true.</p>

<p>The thing is, we're all so buoyed up just now with the crusading
spirit, and so burningly convinced of the infamy of the Government
we're fighting against (this time, thank goodness, one doesn't say
"the nation we're fighting against")&mdash;that we're a little
inclined to forget about our own past idiocies. The fact that we
are now crusaders needn't blind us to the fact that for a very long
time we have been, as Badger would say, echidnas. I can think of a
hundred ways already in which the war has "brought us to our
senses." But it oughtn't to need a war to make a nation paint its
kerbstones white, carry rear-lamps on its bicycles, and give all
its slum children a holiday in the country. And it oughtn't to need
a war to make us talk to each other in buses, and invent our own
amusements in the evenings, and live simply, and eat sparingly, and
recover the use of our legs, and get up early enough to see the sun
rise. However, it has needed one: which is about the severest
criticism our civilization could have.</p>

<p>I wonder whether it's too much to hope that afterwards, when all
the horrors are over, we shall be able to conjure up again the
feelings of these first few weeks, and somehow rebuild our
peace-time world so as to preserve everything of war which is worth
preserving? What we need is a kind of non-material war museum,
where, instead of gaping at an obsolete uniform in a glass case, we
can press a magic button and see a vision of ourselves as we were
while this revealing mood was freshly upon us. I know that this
sounds silly and that there are no such magic buttons. The nearest
approach to them, I think, are the poems and articles&mdash;and
even the letters and chance phrases&mdash;which are struck out of
people like sparks at such moments as this. So write all the
letters you can, Susan, please (to me, if you feel like it, but at
any rate to somebody), and keep all the ones you get, and put down
somewhere, too, everything you see or hear which will help later on
to recapture the spirit of this tragic, marvellous, and eye-opening
time: so that, having recaptured it, we can use it for better ends.
We may not, of course, ever get the chance: but if we do, and once
more fail to act upon it, I feel pretty sure we shan't be given
another one.</p>

<p>As usual in all moments of stress, I've been falling back on
Donne. It's a pity preachers never seem to take their texts from
anything but the Bible: otherwise they could base a perfectly
terrific sermon for the present day on verse 16 of his
Litany&mdash;the one which begins "From needing danger..." Do look
it up&mdash;I know there's a copy in the library at Quern, in the
little bookshelf just on the left of the fireplace.</p>

<p>Yours ever, with much love,</p>

<h2>MRS. MINIVER MAKES A LIST</h2>

<p>"Will ye be wanting anything more tonight, mem?" asked Mrs.
Adie, putting the coffee down by the fire and picking up Mrs.
Miniver's supper-tray.</p>

<p>"No, thank you, nothing at all. As soon as I've made out my list
of Christmas presents, I'm going straight to bed."</p>

<p>Mrs. Adie paused at the door, tray in hand.</p>

<p>"Ay," she said. "This is going to be a queer kind of Christmas
for the bairns, with their Daddy away."</p>

<p>"I dare say he'll get leave," said Mrs. Miniver hopefully.</p>

<p>"Mebbe ay, mebbe no." Mrs. Adie was not one to encourage wishful
thinking. "To say nothing," she added, "of having ten bairns in the
house, instead of three. My! it'll take me back to when I was a
wean myself."</p>

<p>"Why, there weren't ten of you, were there?"</p>

<p>"Thirteen," said Mrs. Adie, wearing the particular expression
that Clem always called "Scotland Wins."</p>

<p>Mrs. Miniver was surprised, not so much by the information
itself as by the fact that Mrs. Adie had vouchsafed it. She was not
in the habit of talking about her own childhood. Indeed, she rather
gave the impression that she had never had one, but had simply
risen from the foam, probably somewhere just off the East Neuk of
Fife.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll say good night, mem."</p>

<p>"Good night, Mrs. Adie. That was a lovely Welsh rabbit."</p>

<p>Left alone, Mrs. Miniver poured out a cup of coffee and sat on
the fender-stool to drink it, roasting her back. Yes, it was going
to be a queer Christmas for everybody this year. To the parents
left behind in the big cities it would seem only half a Christmas;
to the hard-pressed foster-parents in the country, a double one.
Out of her own seven evacuees at Starlings, only two, she knew, had
ever had a tree of their own. And Reen, the eldest&mdash;a shrill,
wizened, masterful little creature of twelve, who in the last two
months had become so touchingly less shrill and wizened (though no
less masterful)&mdash;had never even hung up her stocking. She was
inclined to scoff at the idea of taking to this custom so late in
life.</p>

<p>"Only kids do that," she said. "It's sissy."</p>

<p>"Vin still does it," said Mrs. Miniver. "He's nearly sixteen,
and he's not in the least sissy."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" asked Reen suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Quite sure," said Mrs. Miniver, without a twitch. (She must
tell Vin this, next time she wrote.)</p>

<p>But it was too early yet to make plans about stockings. First of
all, she must get on with that list of presents. She put down her
coffee-cup and went resolutely over to the writing-table.</p>

<p>One of Mrs. Miniver's bad habits&mdash;which, like many bad
habits, was only an exaggeration of a good one&mdash;was that she
was apt to begin by being methodical and to end by being a magpie.
It was, for instance, quite a sound idea to keep one's Christmas
present list until the following year, so as to make sure that one
didn't leave people out or give them the same thing twice running.
But the worst of it was, she never could bring herself to throw
away the old lists when they were done with; and as she had started
the habit when she first married, she had now accumulated no less
than seventeen of them. Not only did they take up an unnecessary
amount of space in an already overcrowded drawer, but they caused
her to waste time at a season of the Year when time was most
valuable: for whenever she opened the drawer to consult last year's
list, she found herself quite unable to resist browsing through the
earlier ones.</p>

<p>For the last eight years the opening names had not varied at
all: Clem, Vin, Judy, Toby, Nannie, Mrs. Adie, Mrs. Downce, Downce.
The ninth name had changed, at intervals of about two years, from
Norah to Jessie, from Jessie to Gladys, and from Gladys to Ellen:
for there seemed to be something fatally marriageable, as well as
incurably trochaic, about the Minivers' house-parlourmaids. Even
Ellen, as unglamorous a girl as you could wish to meet, who had
come to them a few months ago completely heart-whole, had already
acquired a young man. Clem, to whom Mrs. Miniver had broken this
news in a letter, had written back saying, "For heaven's sake, next
time, go for a dactyl or a monosyllable. They may have less
S.A."</p>

<p>As the lists went farther back, however, important gaps
appeared. Nine years ago there had been no Toby; twelve years ago,
no Judy. Yet at each of these Christmases, she remembered, her
universe (which would now be unthinkable without them) had seemed
complete. As for Vin, he figured in all the lists except the first
two; and as she traced his presents backwards from last year's
spinning-rod through conjuring sets and Red Indian outfits to the
woolly rabbit of fifteen years ago, she felt that she was seeing
the whole story of his childhood in reverse, like one of those
trick films where the spilt milk pours itself back into the
jug.</p>

<p>She laid down the sheets on top of each other, one by one. Vin
grew up again before her mind's eye: became three, four, in a
sun-suit and a floppy linen hat; became seven, eight, in grey
flannel shorts (so like, and yet so unlike, Toby); became twelve,
thirteen, in long trousers; shot upwards past her elbow, her
shoulder, her head; and finally grinned down at her from six inches
above it (so like, and yet so unlike, Clem).</p>

<p>Parallel with this memory-film ran another, whose only visible
track was the column of prices on the right-hand side of the page.
Amplified by her recollection, these scribbled figures made a
pretty accurate record of the Miniver family's material ups and
downs. There was the lavishness of the first two years, based on
youthful ignorance, a fixed salary, and a regular parental
allowance; there were the soberer standards which became necessary
when Clem started out on his own; there were the deceptive early
successes, the too optimistic move to a larger house. Then the
slump, the difficult years; the years when an acute appendicitis
seemed to take a malevolent pleasure in coinciding with an
ultimatum from the bank; when they tossed on the horns of the
professional classes' eternal dilemma whether to retrench openly,
or to bluff things out for the sake of keeping up appearances in
front of potential clients. The years when, after dining out, they
said No, thanks, they'd rather walk and pick up a taxi, it would be
so nice to get a breath of air; and when their Christmas presents
to each other (since they couldn't cut down too drastically on
anybody else's) dwindled by mutual consent into mere tokens, which
they exchanged in front of the children with elaborate ceremony,
delighted exclamations, and a great deal of coloured
wrapping-paper. Not that they needed tokens; but it would have
shocked the children if they had exchanged nothing at all.</p>

<p>Things had looked up again, eventually. Clem built an unusual
country house for Sandro Baltman, and Sandro talked, and that set
the ball rolling fast. By the time Toby was born they had been able
to buy Starlings and to get the Downces to look after it. The
tokens had expanded into proper presents again and ever since then
the total at the bottom of the right-hand column had been getting a
little larger every year. But both of them, fortunately, had good
memories: and when young married couples came to dine with them,
they always said, "Yes, of course; you're sure to find one on the
rank just round the corner."</p>

<p>Mrs. Miniver put the last sheet back on top of the others and
clipped them all together again. No, she could not possibly throw
them away: they contained too much of her life. Besides, however
clear one's memories seemed to be, it did one no harm to polish
them up from time to time. One is what one remembers: no more, no
less.</p>

<p>She took a clean sheet of paper and wrote across the top in neat
block capitals:</p>

<blockquote>"CHRISTMAS 1939."</blockquote>
