<h1>Trial Trip of the 'Flying Cloud'</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>J. R. Orton</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>"THROUGH in four days to San Francisco," repeated I. "Marvellous
age!"</p>

<p>I hastily computed the distance by an air-line, and placed the speed
of the craft at some thirty miles an hour. That seemed reasonable
enough. Indeed, the whole statement cohered marvellously well; all the
parts harmonized with each other and looked plausible, even reasonable,
as I have said, except the grand fact itself, which was too momentous
for belief. But why should it not be true? What new achievement of the
human mind ought to startle one in this nineteenth century, after
having witnessed the wonders of steam and electro-magnetism? I
determined to sift the matter, but immediately remembered that all the
knowledge I had of it had been imparted to me in the strictest
confidence. The ingenious inventors, as was clearly their right, had
reserved it to themselves to choose the time and way of making their
invention public, when it was to break on the world, some fine morning,
like the discovery of a second moon performing its orbit round the
earth. I sunk into a brown study.</p>

<p>In the evening, Mr. Bonflon called again, as he had promised. He
brought with him a large roll of plans and drawings, for the purpose of
illustrating more clearly the principles and method of construction and
operation of his aerial ship. They were projected on a large scale, and
the workmanship was superb. Months of hard labor by a finished
draughtsman must have been devoted to their execution. "And what an
additional outlay of time and brains," thought I, "must have been
required, to devise the scheme and construct the machine itself, so as
to elevate the ingenious ideal into an absolute working reality!" These
drawings, Mr. Bonflon informed me, were duplicates of others which had
been privately deposited in the Patent-Office at Washington.</p>

<p>The one which chiefly attracted my attention was that which
represented the monster steamer complete, with all its appendages and
complement of passengers, in its majestic flight through the air. Below
it were the drifting clouds. Its course lay quite above the storms and
hurricanes and conflicting wind-currents which vex the lower strata of
the atmosphere, where it comes in contact with the earth's uneven
surface, and is kept in motion by the contractions and expansions of
alternate cold and heat, and is broken and set whirling by the forests
and gorges and mountain-tops among which it is compelled to force its
way. Above all this, Mr. Bonflon assured me, as aeronauts report, there
is ever a smooth, quiet atmospheric sea.</p>

<p>"But how is life to be sustained for any considerable time in that
rarefied medium?" inquired I, "when it is asserted that even in
ascending high mountains, the texture of the soft parts of the human
body becomes so loose and flabby from diminished atmospheric pressure
as to cause one, so to speak, to sweat blood,--which oozes perceptibly
from the mouth and nose and eyes, and even from under the
finger-nails?"</p>

<p>Mr. Bonflon pointed to a long, narrow line which floated rearward at
an angle of about forty-five degrees from the point of its attachment
to his ship.</p>

<p>"That," said he, "is an India-rubber tube several thousand feet
long, extending down into the respirable atmosphere, and keeping the
cabins always supplied with fresh and wholesome air."</p>

<p>"But would the heavier nether air flow in that direction?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"With a little help from the engine," he replied, "a constant
current, whenever needed, is kept up; and the process of breathing is
rendered as easy and agreeable in the cabins of the 'Flying Cloud' as
in one's own parlors at home. On the upper deck, which is not inclosed,
you see, it is different. In the first trial-trip to California, Mr.
M----insisted on remaining above on this deck for six consecutive
hours, and the result was an attack of hemorrhage from the lungs. On
his going below, however, it almost instantly ceased."</p>

<p>I must now endeavor to give the reader some definite idea of this
extraordinary machine, as exhibited in the drawings. Its buoyant power
was, of course, on the principle of the balloon. But the gas-chamber,
or part to be inflated, instead of being globular in form, consisted of
two horizontal cones joined at the base; or more accurately still, it
resembled an immense barrel extended at both ends to a point, and
resting on its side. This shape was given it, according to Mr. Bonflon,
that it might offer the least possible resistance to the element in
which it was intended to move. In structure it was composed of a strong
flexible frame of whalebone and steel, covered with silk, strengthened
and rendered air-tight and water-proof by a coating of India-rubber.
Its size, of course, would depend on the proposed tonnage of a
particular ship. That of the working-model, as nearly as I remember,
was about six hundred feet long, by some seventy or eighty in breadth
in the middle, which was calculated to be amply sufficient to sustain
the immense car beneath, with its engine, and fuel for a week, and
three hundred passengers with their baggage; leaving still a
considerable margin for freight.</p>

<p>Mr. Bonflon here pointed out, with great minuteness, the simple, but
ingenious method devised for the inflation of this enormous machine,
and the regulation of the gas; which I pass over, from an inability to
render it intelligible by mere description.</p>

<p>The car or vessel suspended below, and to which the balloon part
bore the relation of masts and sails, was fashioned after the best
model of a clipper ship, but still farther elongated. Below deck, it
was divided into sitting and dining cabins, state-rooms, kitchen,
engine-room, and so forth; and above was a long, railed, promenade
deck. The attachment between the two parts was by means of a network of
ropes, extending from every quarter, and from the whole circumference
of the ship, connecting with staples in the framework of the balloon,
and finally embracing its entire body in its folds. Two enormous
paddle-wheels, made of oiled silk stretched on delicate frames, and
driven by a steam-engine of the lightest structure possible, furnished
the propelling power; while at the stern, like a vast fin, played the
helm, of a similar material and construction to the paddle-wheels.</p>

<p>All this was explained to me in much fuller detail than I can here
repeat, by Mr. Bonflon, who added, that the materials employed combined
lightness with strength to a much greater degree than had ever before
been achieved,--that the fuel used was of the fluid kind, a new
combination of concentrated combustibles invented by himself,--and that
the weight of the entire machine had been carefully calculated
beforehand, together with its buoyant power, and the results had
demonstrated the accuracy of the mathematics.</p>

<p>I turned on Mr. Bonflon and looked him squarely in the face. He was
a modest man and blushed slightly, but did not shrink. There could be
no dishonesty there. His countenance bore the unmistakable stamp of
integrity, as well as intelligence; and his whole appearance and
bearing were those of a true man.</p>

<p>Had he brought me the newspaper he promised, not yet eight days old,
from San Francisco?</p>

<p>No. He had been detained down-town all day in the whirl of our New
York Babel, and had not yet been home. He would hand it in
to-morrow.</p>

<p>Mr. Bonflon had been introduced to me that morning by a friend on
whose acuteness and judgment I felt I had many good reasons to rely.
Without pretending any precise knowledge of the man, or, indeed, any
knowledge at all, beyond what had been gathered from the individual
himself in a very brief acquaintance of Mr. Bonflon's own seeking, he
expressed a warm interest in him personally, as also in the startling
discovery he professed to have made.</p>

<p>In that interview, Mr. Bonflon had informed us in brief, that, after
ten years of patient and toilsome experiment, of disappointment, of
perishing and reviving hope, he had at length achieved the grand object
of his life. He had solved the problem of the navigation of the air. He
had proved by actual results, that the great ocean of atmosphere above
us could be ploughed as successfully and safely as the waters beneath,
and with much greater facility and pleasure. He stated that the first
trial--trip, after the completion of the ship, had been made in the
night from an obscure point in the State of Maryland, and extended
north and northeast, along the Atlantic coast, to New York,--whose glow
of light from a great height, like a phosphorescent mist, was plainly
distinguishable,--and thence to the neighborhood of Boston, and back to
the place of starting; and that a second, with equally favorable
results, had been made from the same point by a more inland route,
northwest to Buffalo and the Canada line; and he named several
well-known persons who were on board at one or the other of these
times, and related some little anecdotes illustrative of their states
of mind and apprehensions while drifting above the earth on the
occasion of these novel voyages.</p>

<p>He said, further, that the President and heads of departments at
Washington were fully cognizant of the matter; and that a third grant
trial-trip, in the interest of government, had been secretly made, with
important dispatches to California, relating to the security of our
rights in the Pacific. Four days had been consumed in the passage out,
including a stoppage of a couple of hours on a fine plateau, near the
head waters of the Missouri, at the foot of the Rocky Mountains; and
the same in the return. They had landed in the night in a deep valley a
few miles out of San Francisco, and remained two days in that city;
which gave a period of ten days to the entire voyage, out and back.
Forty selected individuals, all bound to secresy, had participated in
the risks and excitements of the extraordinary occasion. Mr. Bonflon
was not of the number. An heroic daughter of his was. His partner,
Mons. De Aery, a French gentleman of great mechanical skill, had
managed the affair; and the craft, in the same hands, was now absent on
her second expedition across the American continent.</p>

<p>Such was the sum of Mr. Bonflon's revelations of the morning. What a
discovery! How the announcement would astonish the world! How the
practical fact would overturn the world, upset commerce, and transform
the habits and relations of mankind! America, the pioneer in many
valuable discoveries and reforms, was still ahead,--still destined to
lead the van in the development of the powers and resources of Nature,
and the onward march of nations.</p>

<p>Hurriedly recalling all these points to mind, I requested to know of
Mr. Bonflon how it had been possible, with so many confidants and the
prying propensities of the press, whose agents, like an invisible
police, are everywhere, to keep the matter from becoming public,--at
least, to cover the affair so completely that no hint of the existence
of his machine should have been given in any quarter, or of the vast
changes which its introduction as a power in the world could not fail
to effect.</p>

<p>To this he replied, that the press had behaved very handsomely; that
the principal papers of the country had attaches aboard on the first
trip to the Pacific; but that all parties--the government, the editors,
together with De Aery and himself--were agreed that the matter should
be kept strictly private, until its practicality and value should be
established beyond the possibility of question.</p>

<p>I now remembered, that, several years ago, a good deal of noise had
been made about a flying-machine which had been constructed in some of
the suburbs of the city,--and that a day had been advertised when it
was to make an ascent, but it failed. I mentioned the circumstance to
Mr. Bonflon.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied. "It was at Hoboken. De Aery and myself spent
years in the construction of that machine, and a large amount of money.
On the day when the trial of its powers was to have taken place, the
weather proved unfavorable, and we met with unexpected delays. The
spectators, who had congregated by the thousands, became impatient; and
the mob, breaking in upon us, destroyed in an hour property which had
cost us five thousand dollars and the labor of years."</p>

<p>I felt obliged to sympathize with Mr. Bonflon. He had met with the
usual fortune of public benefactors, and particularly of inventors. His
success, however, should it prove real, in the unexampled brilliancy of
its results, would more than compensate him for all his disappointments
and losses. He would rank as the greatest of discoverers,--as the
master mind of this master century.</p>

<p>Leading him off from this one topic into general conversation, I
held him thus engaged for an hour. I was charmed with his comprehensive
intelligence, and with the scope and liberality of his views. In
everything relating to mechanics, his opinions were marked with
originality. This had evidently been his favorite field, where his
quick perceptions and powers of concentration and analysis had elevated
him to an eminence where he stood almost alone. I had never met his
equal. In plausible suggestions relative to the possibilities of the
future, he took me quite above my level, and left me floating in a maze
of glittering bewilderment. But I could discover no breaks, no
confusion in his mind, on the themes he presented. His premises were
apparently well considered, and his conclusions the fair and natural
sequences flowing from them.</p>

<p>On the following day, Mr. Bonflon called on me again. In the
interval, my friend and myself had held extended consultations. My
friend, while externally calm as the surface of a summer sea, as was
his wont, it was plain for me to see, was internally deeply stirred and
excited by the extraordinary nature of Mr. Bonflon's revelations.
Acknowledging a mutual and increasing interest in the intelligent
inventor, we nevertheless parted in a wilderness of doubt. There was a
mystery in the matter,--a surprise for the world or a surprise for
ourselves,--which time, it would seem, with its busy thumb and finger,
must be left to unravel at its leisure.</p>

<p>Mr. Bonflon had not brought the California paper with him. The two
or three copies only which had come into his possession had been handed
around among his confidential friends, and he had not been able to lay
his hand on one. He informed me that the "Flying Cloud" was expected to
return in three days, and, after remaining two days on the Atlantic
side of the continent, would then start on her third experimental trip
to the Pacific. At that time he expected to make one of the party
himself, and he invited me to accompany him.</p>

<p>I accepted the invitation, and received from him particular
instructions as to the nature of my outfit. It was in the midst of the
heats of summer. He advised, however, a full supply of thick clothing,
on account of the increased chill and coldness of the atmosphere at
high altitudes; and, indeed, recommended a mail of flannel next the
skin. Everything else--the supply of the larder, with an excellent
cook, beds, and so forth--would be found amply provided by De Aery and
himself for the comfort and accommodation of their guests. The station,
or point of departure, Mr. Bonflon informed me, was a retired spot but
a few miles out of the city of Baltimore; and he promised to be at hand
at the proper time to accompany me in person, and see me safely on
board the "Flying Cloud."</p>

<p>I saw nothing more of Mr. Bonflon for several days. Meanwhile I
arranged my affairs for a brief absence, and, as my family were all off
in the country, prepared a special letter for use, if needed, to be
dated and mailed at the last moment, notifying them of a probable gap
in my correspondence, on account of some pressing business which would
take me out of the city for a few days and keep me constantly
employed.</p>

<p>In three or four days I received a note from Mr. Bonflon, advising
me to hold myself in readiness; and at the proper time, he presented
himself before me. But he came to apologize. The "Flying Cloud" had
returned. The second trip had been as successfully and safely performed
as the first. Nothing had occurred to mar the pleasure of the voyage;
but, unfortunately, before coming on to New York, De Aery had filled
out the complement of guests for the third grand expedition. Even he
(Mr. Bonflon) should remain behind; but he should see that seats were
reserved for us both, without fail, for the next succeeding trip.</p>

<p>Mr. Bonflon took his leave; and I found myself more deeply involved
in doubt and perplexity than ever. I could hardly say that I was
disappointed, or that I was not. I had thrown myself on a wave, with no
look-out or means of judging where I was to be cast, and had formed no
opinions. As yet, everything looked fair with Mr. Bonflon. His face was
as honest as the morning sun, and it was next to impossible to doubt
him. He might be the prey of some strange phantasm, some monomania; but
the evidences did not show it. The account he had given of himself was
manly and coherent; his claims as a discoverer had been modestly
presented, and were not wholly unsupported by circumstances, or
unreasonable in themselves. Indeed, they must be regarded as coming
within the range of probabilities fully as much as, to human seeming,
had once the established, but ceaseless, wonders of steam locomotion
and electric telegraphing.</p>

<p>Singularly enough,--and it illustrates the constantly shifting
scenes in the kaleidoscope of life,--within an hour, Mr. Bonflon
returned with a new message, and with the programme of the "Flying
Cloud" changed, if not reversed. He had seen De Aery again. One or two
of the expected passengers had telegraphed that untoward circumstances
would compel them to remain behind, and there would be room for us. But
no time was to be lost; the air-steamer would weigh anchor before
daylight of the following morning, and we must start for Baltimore by
the next train. De Aery and several others were already flying over the
rail on their way to Philadelphia.</p>

<p>I did not allow myself to hesitate. With an unusual degree of
excitement, made up of the mingled emotions of wonder, doubt, and, I
frankly confess, apprehension, I dated and superscribed the letter to
my absent family; and, taking my carpet-bag in my hand, packed to
plethora several days before in readiness for the occasion, set out on
the strange and questionable adventure.</p>

<p>The run to Baltimore was made without accident or delay. Mr. Bonflon
and myself conversed a good deal, and I found additional cause to
admire the discriminating character of his mind and the curious and
wonderful stores it contained. Some of the time we dozed, or sunk into
a mental confusion like that to which the body was subjected by the
motion of the cars, and called it sleep. My own most impressive
visions, however, were those of silent wakefulness, and were connected
with the morrow and the "Flying Cloud."</p>

<p>We stopped in the chief city of Maryland only long enough to obtain
some slight refreshments, such as could be furnished readily in the
middle of the night, and proceeded at once to the wharf or station of
our sky-sailer. Ah, how shall I describe my sensations on first
beholding this most wonderful achievement of the age, and thus
satisfying myself that it was an actual existence, and not the mere
chimera of a diseased brain? There she sat like a majestic swan,
floating, as it were, in the pure empyrean, and crowned with a diadem
of stars. The Moon, Arcturus, and the Pleiades might well all make
obeisance to her, and the Milky Way invite her to extend her flight and
plough its snowy fields. I was astonished at her size, the symmetry of
her parts, and the harmony of her proportions, as she lay there at a
great height, which I was quite unable to estimate, in bold relief
against the sky.</p>

<p>But Mr. Bonflon could afford me but a brief time for observation and
the indulgence of my wonder. The stores and most of the passengers were
already on board; and taking me by the arm, he hurried me forward, and
seated me in the small car or tender, by means of which, and the agency
of ropes and pulleys, we were to reach her decks. Our upward movement
immediately commenced. It was steady and gentle, not calculated to
create alarm; and still the notion of quitting Mother Earth for an
indefinite number of days, to rove in the blue unknown of space, was
attended with some apprehensions and regrets. I gazed anxiously at the
receding objects below; but my feelings underwent a change as we
approached the "Flying Cloud" herself, were pulled into her gangway,
and I found myself standing on her solid decks. A brief further period
intervened, and our anchor was loosed; the tremendous machine became
instinct with life; she began to move; and, hurrah! we were under
way.</p>

<p>The thoughts and emotions of this bewildering moment it is
impossible to describe. Our craft moved off majestically, like some
huge water-fowl rising from the sea. Her course was westward and
upward, like the eagle with his face turned toward the palace of the
sun. At first the lights in the city of Baltimore became more numerous
and distinct, as intervening objects were surmounted and overlooked.
Next they began to fade, shrinking down into twinkling points like
fireflies, until they disappeared. Forests, hills, and mountains
followed after, as our altitude was increased, blending together like a
hazy landscape, until, on passing above the cloud region, and finding
the level of our track, the earth was wholly lost to our view, and our
course lay through the blue serene of space, without a lighthouse or a
landmark, and nothing but the constant lamps of heaven to guide us in
our passage.</p>

<p>What a sea! The ocean has its visible surface on which move the
ships; but we had none. The heavens were beneath us as well as above.
We were floating in the great circle of the systems and the suns. We
were of the universe; but were to be numbered with the constellations
and the stars. We could compare ourselves to a company of immortals
quitting the earth and traversing the electric seas which lead to
brighter homes. Or we were voyagers to the sun, or to the nearer Venus,
or to the far distant Centaurus. What a world of new thought was forced
upon us by the fancies and realities and charm and awe of our
extraordinary condition, combined with the profound consciousness we
could not fail to entertain of the effects which this crowning
discovery of Messrs. Bonflon and De Aery must produce on travel, on
commerce, on art, and the common destiny of mankind!</p>

<p>I found the atmosphere of the cabins, as my friend Bonflon had
asserted, agreeable and healthful. I could also occupy the promenade
deck for half an hour with little inconvenience, so far as the levity
of the air was concerned; but the cold was severe; while the system, in
consequence of an undue expansion of its particles, solid and fluid,
from the diminished pressure of the atmosphere, was rendered doubly
susceptible to its influence. The advice given by Mr. Bonflon to case
myself in flannels, with an armament at hand of outer winter-clothing,
proved well-timed; and yet a period of lassitude, verging on faintness,
invariably followed every considerable exposure to the open air.</p>

<p>But the pleasure of gazing on those fields of space without
obstruction, without the intervention of so much as a plate of crystal
glass, repaid me for every risk and every ill. Though it might be said
there was no scenery there, where nothing was visible but the stars,
yet far beyond the power of mountain and valley, forest and lake,
waterfall and ocean, did that scene, which was no scene, or next to
none, bind me in the spell of its fascination. The motion of our craft,
as we careered noiselessly through the shoreless and objectless void,
without sense of effort or friction, was a charm of itself,--bringing
to a flower, crystallizing into refulgent stars, the dim, obscure,
however glorious, poetry of life. Here were the wildest imaginations of
the dreamer melted in a crucible, and reproduced in living forms of
usefulness and beauty. In my own years of widely diversified
experience, what had I met with to compare with this? Nothing. The
force of steam was marvellous,--talking over a wire mysterious; but
here I was in a great ship riding among the planets and the stars. I
had likened Niagara to a vast mill-dam, because I could find no peer to
set beside it; so now, in my weakness, the sublime pageant of the
"Flying Cloud" could search out nothing higher in my recollection with
which to compare it than a wild ride of my youth in a canoe, for a
half-mile or so, down the rapids of a river.</p>

<p>But morning was at hand. The rich golden glow of night, to which the
dwellers on the earth's surface are accustomed, as we passed to higher
altitudes, had given place to a thin inky blue. This was obscured by no
fleck or mist, and yet the stars shone through it faint and dim,
despoiling the firmament of its glory. The same loss of power was
manifest on the ushering in of day. The auroral flame, which ordinarily
greets us in the east with such a ruddy laugh, was now nothing better
than a wan and dismal smile; and even the sun, as he struggled up from
what seemed a bed of leaden mist, brought with him only a pallid,
lifeless twilight. It was not that his rays were impeded by cloud or
haze; he had lost his power to shine. He hung there in the heavens like
a great white shield, and looked down on us as rayless and powerless
and devoid of life as a dead man's eye.</p>

<p>Having at length wearied myself with gazing, and feeling chill and
weak from the coldness and tenuity of the atmosphere, I subsided into
the comfort and companionship of the cabins below. Among the passengers
I recognized attaches of the press, besides several gentlemen of
Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, with whom I was somewhat
acquainted. More circumspect, or less slaves to the imagination than
myself, they had contented themselves with in-door observations. But
their enthusiasm was none the less inflamed. In astonishment they
looked at each other; in restless bewilderment they glanced out of the
windows on the desert, trackless plane traversed by the "Flying Cloud,"
and spoke with a species of awe of the shock which the announcement of
what they were then witnessing would give to sober men's minds; and
suggested, in broken sentences, some of the consequences which would be
likely to flow from the grand invention.</p>

<p>What with the excitement and lack of sleep, we all found ourselves a
little nervous. Coffee and Havanas failed to allay the feeling; and, in
the absence of the morning papers, we resorted to whist, chess, and our
pocket supplies of the "Atlantic Monthly," "Harper," and so forth, and
to the very select library provided by Messrs. Bonflon and De Aery, the
proprietors, for the use of the passengers,--and at last to our beds.
It could not be denied that we were nervous. With all the smoothness
and beauty of our running, there was a sensation, an uncertain
quivering motion, not at first noticed and not at all definable, about
our craft, that constantly suggested the idea that we were standing on
nothing, or, at best, nothing better than dissolving quicksands, which
were liable at any moment wholly to slide away and leave us; and it
required some strength of mind to resist the vagary, and prevent it
from effecting a troublesome lodgment in the imagination.</p>

<p>Thus passed the day, which fortunately, in my case, was succeeded by
a night of repose. The restlessness of mind and body once subdued,
Nature asserted her empire, and I slept profoundly until morning.
Another day and night followed, with little variation from the first;
and by this time, the strangeness and mystery of my situation had quite
worn away, and the feeling of security was established. I trod the
upper deck with all the pride, and more than the composure, of a modern
monarch on his throne.</p>

<p>But the sameness of the scenery of the vast aerial ocean, in which
we were sailing alone, without consort, without ever descrying a sail,
or even keeping a lookout, without so much as ever discovering a
floating plank to remind us of a wreck, or a seaweed to tell us of the
land, was already beginning to pall on the senses, when there appeared
in the distance before us, and multiplying to the right and the left, a
succession of white, sparkling pyramids and cones, resting on the
clouds and flashing in the nether light, like crystal monuments set to
mark the boundaries of space. These were crests of the Rocky Mountains,
covered with perpetual snow.</p>

<p>I gazed on them with rapture. Right in our eye, nearly due west,
stood out Long's Peak, James's Peak, and the Spanish Peaks, at first
small in size, but momently swelling in dimensions; while, far to the
north, were just discernible the more lofty summits of Mount Hooker and
Mount Brown. Lying between Mount James and the Spanish Peaks, inclining
to their eastern slope, lay the green plateau, not yet visible, where
we were to land. Its position was carefully pointed out to Mr. Bonflon
and myself by Mr. De Aery, but we strained our eyes and used our
glasses in vain. No strength of sight could penetrate the clouds and
haze which covered the body of the mountains, and hid the earth, with
the exception of those lofty silver pinnacles, from our view.</p>

<p>Though these high peaks, like distant masts at sea, were first seen
early in the day, the meridian of noon overtook us before we came up
with them. At length, in increasing numbers and a thousand diversified
shapes, they lay spread out before us, and soon thereafter were
directly under our feet. Our magical machine, coming to a halt,
fluttered like a great bird above them, and gave us an opportunity,
such as probably had never been enjoyed by voyagers before, to spy out
their beauty, their mystery, and their strength.</p>

<p>On nearing the mountains, we had left behind us the twilight of the
void, and come again into the full flood of day. This enabled the sight
to rest upon the scene with pleasure, to examine its diversified
splendors, and penetrate its chasms and gorges, otherwise inaccessible
to man. But to describe them is impossible. Broad fields of sparkling
snow, pyramids of ice, wide fissures shining like steel
mirrors,--produced by some unimaginable convulsion, possibly a thousand
or ten thousand years ago, and large enough to ingulf a city,--with
black humps or spires of granite here and there projecting through the
white; while afar down the rocky sides of interminable swells and
precipices came up a sound of water and a blush of green, betokening
the direction in which we were to look for the generative body of
Mother Earth; all these, and much more which I cannot stop to name,
were grouped in the rough, but magnificent landscape before us.</p>

<p>No cabin could confine me at such a time as this. I stood out on the
upper deck in the extreme bow of the boat; and from an unobstructed
point of view, nearly over the figure-head, in the very abandonment of
daring, feasted my senses on the wondrous glories of this
mountain-scene of enchantment.</p>

<p>De Aery was at the helm. But I have scarcely introduced this
extraordinary gentleman to the reader. He was a tall, black--haired,
mercurial Frenchman, with an eye like a falcon, who, with only an
occasional Gallicism purposely indulged in, spoke American like a
native. I had every confidence in his prudence and skill in the
management of his craft; and still, as I perceived that we were
gradually settling down in the direction of the loftiest of those
snow-peaks, until scarcely fifty feet intervened between us and its
round, polished brow, to all appearance as solid as feldspar, I raised
my voice and accosted him.</p>

<p>"Halloo! Captain!" said I, "are you intending to land us on this
Atlas-top?"</p>

<p>"Effectivement," replied he. "Mon Dieu! B---, come here."</p>

<p>I went to him.</p>

<p>"This," said he, "is the very Old Man of the Mountain. I intend to
plant the stars and stripes in the centre of his bald head."</p>

<p>"Capital!" replied I. "But can you achieve it safely?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I can manage my bird with as much ease as a pigeon poises
himself on his wings, or an Indian steers his canoe. See! we are
approaching the crown of the pinnacle."</p>

<p>I watched the experiment with an interest not unmingled with fear.
He held in one hand a handsome American flag, of moderate size, and
occasionally, with a slight motion of his arm, and a glance of pride,
spread out its silken folds on the motionless air. Gradually the
"Flying Cloud," under his skilful hands, closed upon the bleak,
glittering summit, which, rounding off like the bald head of some
venerable giant, was, at its apex, scarcely ten feet in diameter.</p>

<p>"No eagle, even, has ever set his foot here," said De Aery. "There
is not a track, or feather, or mark of any living thing to be seen. The
'Flying Cloud' will be the first to explore many mysteries and to
explode others. Not even do the winds reach this height. Boreas and the
bird of Jove,--I will vanquish them both. I will step out upon that icy
peak."</p>

<p>"No, no, Captain," I expostulated. "You might lose your foothold and
perish."</p>

<p>"Not at all," rejoined he, with a laugh. "I am as sure-footed as a
goat. But if you think it risky, Monsieur, I forbear. But the snow
looks solid as adamant. I fear I shall not be able to erect this flag,
unless I have a firm spot for my feet."</p>

<p>By this time our craft had reached a proper position,--her stern
alongside and almost in contact with the jutting peak,--to answer the
ambitious purpose of the Frenchman. Raising the flag of the Republic in
his hand, he requested us all to do it proper honor,--to salute it with
a "three times three,"--as he should succeed in securing it in its
place. Cautiously extending the staff, he brought it in contact with
the snow, and gave it several light blows, for the purpose of
ascertaining its solidity. It seemed of almost icy texture, and emitted
a half-sharp and half--muffled sound in reply. Then, elevating the
standard aloft in both hands, he brought it down with force as the
farmer urges a stake into the ground; not doubting, as would seem, that
a succession of such blows would be needed in order to achieve his
purpose.</p>

<p>A single stroke of the shaft, however, proved more than enough. To
the surprise and dismay of us all, the firm ringing surface turned out
but a shell, and all beneath, a loose bed of sparkling snow-crystals,
like white sand. The flag sunk down and disappeared, and De Aery,
losing his balance, plunged over and went with it.</p>

<p>We gazed after him in speechless horror. Before any one of us had
sufficiently recovered himself to speak, we were startled by a dull
sound, like a rushing wind, or distant, rumbling thunder; and an
immense mass of snow, many hundred feet in depth, and covering a third
of the cone, parted from its place, and, like a great, foaming wave,
broken and shapeless, rushed down the mountain's side. For the moment,
all eyes were fixed upon it. At first, it swept on without cohering,
like a cataract of sand; but, on coming in contact with the moister
snow below, it formed into a thousand balls and masses, some rolling
and some sliding, but each gathering bulk and velocity as it went.</p>

<p>By the aid of our glasses we were able to sweep the rough slopes and
precipitous descents below, to the distance of many miles; and,
forgetting De Aery, we watched the development of the phenomenon with
terror. The larger slides gradually absorbed the smaller ones, as
common fish are swallowed by sharks; but those which remained, fattened
and expanded by what they fed on, assumed enormous dimensions. Choosing
different paths, they pursued their course in smoking tracks of
devastation. Rocks, precipices, forests, furnished no obstruction.
Roaring, crashing onward, as though Mars or the Sun had opened its
batteries upon us, those sliding, whirling worlds of snow swept through
valleys large enough to have furnished sites for cities, without a
check, and bore down or overleaped all obstacles, as easily as a man
would walk over an ant-hill, or some hollow where a toad had burrowed.
Finally they were lost to sight, passing behind intervening spurs or
ridges of the mountain, or becoming hidden in the cloud-mists which lay
heavily about its base; but the sound continued to roll back upon us
for some time, like the roar of distant artillery. I could no longer
wonder at the terror with which the cry of an avalanche is said to fill
the dwellers among the Alps.</p>

<p>As this absorbing pageant of the mountains disappeared, our thoughts
reverted to De Aery. Had he been carried away by the snow-slip? or was
his mangled corse below us among the black crags laid bare by that
catastrophe? Turning my gaze beneath, I discovered, far down, many
hundred feet, a moving object, scarcely bigger than a fly, and, on
bringing my glass to bear upon it, perceived that it was the Frenchman.
He was standing on a bare rib of rock, with his flag still in his hand,
and apparently unharmed. Waving the ensign to attract our attention, at
the same time he shouted with the whole strength of his lungs. But his
voice scarcely reached us, and probably would not alone have attracted
our notice. We replied with encouraging cheers; and the "three times
three," which we had intended for the American eagle, was given on the
spot to De Aery.</p>

<p>But how to rescue him from his perilous condition was indeed a
serious question. The "Flying Cloud," it was obvious, with her great
size and spreading pinions, could not venture among those ticklish
quicksands, whose insecure foundations had just been so strikingly
illustrated before us. Indeed, the slightest jar might precipitate
another fall of snow, and bury the object of our solicitude five
hundred feet deep in its bosom. The sagacity of Mr. Bonflon relieved us
from our dilemma. He hoisted out the small car or tender, and, letting
it down with great care and precision, safely accomplished the object.
In the space of half an hour, De Aery, without a scratch, and, like a
gallant Gaul, rather proud of his adventure than frightened at it, was
again restored to our arms.</p>

<p>Drawing off from our dangerous proximity to the "Old Man of the
Mountain," which had so nearly proved fatal to at least one of our
number, but astonished beyond measure at the novelty of our experiences
and the grandeur of the scenes we had witnessed, we retraced our course
for a short distance, and, gradually lessening the interval between us
and the earth, soon had the satisfaction of hearing the cry of "Land,
ho!" from the look-out man. The valley was in sight where we were to
take in water and enjoy a little picnic on the green grass, ere the
form and smell of Mother Earth, with her homely but blessed realities,
should be quite forgotten.</p>

<p>We effected our landing in complete safety. The spot was a little,
luxurious nook among the lesser hills, with few trees, but full of wild
flowers, wild fruits, and wild grasses. Everything about it was wild,
but cheering and charming, especially to air--wanderers like us. The
foot of the white hunter, or even of the roving Indian, had perhaps
never visited it, nor foraging-parties of the buffalo or deer, for we
saw no signs of them; but birds of varied plumage and song, and troops
of squirrels, with footprints here and there of the grizzly bear, and a
drove of wild turkeys, with red heads aloft, rushing over an eminence
at our left as we approached, and an occasional whir of a rattlesnake
at our feet, sufficiently indicated the kind of denizens by which the
plateau was inhabited.</p>

<p>Here, on the rich sward and delicate mosses, under the shadow of
some willows, we spread out our repast by the side of a clear
mountain-spring; and, to say nothing of old Otard and Schiedam
Schnapps, opened some bottles of Sparkling Catawba, and old Jersey
Champagne, of a remote vintage, which I have now quite forgotten. With
the flow of these beverages flowed our speech, in jovial words and
songs and raillery enough, if not in wit. De Aery, as having by a
hair's breadth just escaped with his life, and in virtue of his
extraordinary feat in leaping five hundred feet or more through a bank
of snow, now that the danger was over, was made the butt of much
pleasantry, which he bore with his usual equanimity and grace.</p>

<p>When these arrowy flights at the expense of the light-hearted
Frenchman had exhausted themselves, I took occasion to inquire of him
what his sensations were during his brief burial. He replied as
follows:---</p>

<p>"I thought nothing at all about it. I remember feeling chagrined
because I was making a failure, and clung tight to my flag, fearing to
lose that too. Mon Dieu! It might be expected that one would feel cold,
buried up in ice; but such was not the case. I was hot. The snow burned
my face, as it came in contact with it. As to the ride, it was pleasant
enough, but rather rapid and perplexing to the breath. It was like
sinking into a pit of quicksand, where everything gives way below one,
as though the bottom of the world had fallen out. There was the
struggle of a moment to keep the fine snow out of my mouth and
nostrils, as I drew in my breath, and the next instant my feet came in
contact with the solid rock, where you discovered me. The magnificent
avalanche you describe I know nothing about. I neither heard nor saw
anything of it, only as I afterward examined the marks it had left
behind it. This leads me to suppose that I was a good deal confused at
the time, though I was not aware of it. Indeed, I have an impression of
seeming to turn somersets in my descent, and this may account for it.
But, for the honor of France, I saved my adopted country's flag."</p>

<p>High-minded Gaul! We all praised and honored him, and comforted him
for his disappointment. It was a noble attempt he had made, to nail the
American banner to the head of Mount James, impelled by the loftiest of
motives,--and, like many others of its kind, had for the present
failed. At some other time he might prove more successful; or some
other might achieve the object in his place, and so appropriate his
laurels; but no one would be likely to excel him in his flying leap. In
this he had distanced even the famous traveller at Rhodes.</p>

<p>Having given a couple of hours to this species of recreation, we
weighed anchor, and again got under way. Slowly and smoothly, without a
ripple or a jar, we ascended through the blue ether to our former
altitude, and floated off over those majestic mountain--tops, toward
the west. Loath to part from scenes of such impressive beauty,--scenes,
alone paralleled in our recollection by fabulous tales of Oriental
enchantment,--we gazed behind us at those flashing crests of alabaster,
until they grew small in the distance, and finally were wholly lost to
our sight. With them disappeared the last vestige of the solid earth,
and we were again afloat in space.</p>

<p>The following night and day were passed like their predecessors.
Another night came, and we were over the eastern bound of the State of
California. A few hours more, without accident, would terminate our
remarkable voyage, and set us down in the city of San Francisco. All of
us were brimming high with hope. Though we did not anticipate reaching
the station before one or two o'clock in the morning, and probably
should not disembark before dawn, we were loath to retire to rest. It
was near midnight before all of us were in our berths.</p>

<p>But when at length there, I found it impossible to sleep. The
excitement attendant on the beginning of the trip seemed to have
returned on me with a double force. I listened for some sound to
relieve the awful stillness which, like the wing of Death, seemed to
have settled over the "Flying Cloud"; but there was no soughing of the
wind, as at sea, and no noise to be heard, save the monotonous movement
of the engine and the paddle-wheels; and this, so evenly did they play,
was rather a motion than a sound.</p>

<p>This period of restlessness was succeeded by one of strange
bewilderment, which might have been sleep, or might not. Rapidly
changing scenes and fantastic figures some of them beautiful and some
horrible, flitted before me like a dissolving panorama. A band, as
though of steel wire, seemed to encircle my brain, and to compress it
closer and closer; and the spine, for its whole length, felt as though
subjected to a like crushing pressure.</p>

<p>How long this state of hallucination continued I have no means of
knowing. From it, by a great effort, I suddenly aroused myself, and
returned to my proper senses. Where I was, and all the extraordinary
events of the last few days, were clear in my recollection. But I was
weighed down with weakness, and found, on attempting to speak, that I
had no voice.</p>

<p>Suspecting that I had been stricken by some terrible disease, I
attempted to rise; and, loath to disturb any of my fellow-travellers,
undertook to crawl out upon the upper deck. This, after a good deal of
effort, I accomplished. Lying, therefore,--I could not stand,--I prayed
for a breath of air to relieve my hot and oppressed brow; but in vain.
The atmosphere seemed gone. Chill and dark, the heavens spread out
above me without a twinkle or a smile. The full-moon was there, and
there was no cloud or haze to obscure her light; but she did not shine.
Her white, rayless face was a mockery to the night. The same was true
of the stars. The dazzling canopy was faded out, and Cygnus and the
Great Bear were subdued to pallid points, like patches of white-gray
paper stuck upon a wall.</p>

<p>Floating by the side of the "Flying Cloud," and nearly of her size,
I discovered a dark, irregular object, and dragged myself to the edge
of the deck to investigate it more closely. The two came together, but
without damage or friction. They touched and parted, like substances
nearly at rest in still water. I put out my hand on the strange
visitor, and received a pretty severe shock, as though I had been
subjected to the action of an electric battery. At the same time, a
light, bluish flame ran over it surface, showing me more accurately its
form and dimensions. To the touch, it was solid and cold, like iron or
granite. I pressed upon it, and it yielded like a floating dish. I
tried to break off a fragment, but was unable to separate so much as a
scale.</p>

<p>A moment's reflection convinced me of the nature of this apparent
island in the air. It was an immense aerolite; and with this conviction
came the solution of my own painful state. We had unconsciously passed
beyond the controlling power of the earth's gravitation, into the
region of the upper atmosphere, where, science informs us, these
meteoric stones float in equilibrium, until some accidental impulse
throws them from their balance, when they are precipitated to the
surface of the earth. I must be dying for lack of air. And the man at
the helm, where was he? He must have fallen asleep, and left our vessel
to her own buoyant fancies. And my companions! Bonflon! De Aery! All
ere this might have perished, and the "Flying Cloud," aside from
myself, be bearing into these upper altitudes nothing but a load of
death.</p>

<p>Terror-struck, I dragged myself, with all the speed I could
accomplish, to the stern. There sat the helmsman at his post, but
asleep or insensible. I shook him, but he gave no signs of life. I
shouted with what little strength I had, but in vain.</p>

<p>"Wake up! wake up!" I cried, "or we are lost!"</p>

<p>At length he opened his eyes, but did not move.</p>

<p>"Wake up!" I screamed again. "Breakers ahead, and worse. You have
let the craft run wild. We are above our level. We are all dying for
lack of air."</p>

<p>"Oh, let me sleep!" he murmured. "I must sleep a little while
longer. It can't--can't be morning yet."</p>

<p>"By this time, fright, or the necessity of the occasion, was
renewing my strength.</p>

<p>"Dick!" I shouted in his ear, "Dick, you scoundrel! you will murder
us all. Do your duty, or I will shoot you!"</p>

<p>With this I discharged a barrel of my revolver above his head,
which, like my voice in my efforts at hallooing, sounded only as a
faint echo of itself, but, nevertheless, proved sufficient to give his
dormant faculties a shock. He started up, and, though still but
half-conscious, took the helm and gave it the direction I bade him.</p>

<p>From him I hastened to the engineer, whom I found in a like state of
insensibility. I succeeded in arousing him; but it was necessary that
he should be made to comprehend the difficulties of our
situation,--that our craft, water-logged as it were, would float
forever where she was, for all anybody could say to the contrary, until
forced down by the power of the engine alone to lower and life-giving
atmospheric planes. To get him to understand this was not so easy. But
I succeeded in part, and, in my anxiety for my friends, rushed below to
look after their condition.</p>

<p>As I anticipated, I found every one of them in a state of incipient
asphyxia. But the "Flying Cloud" was already descending into denser
air. Oxygen and pressure were performing their mystic work; and within
half an hour I had the pleasure of seeing them all restored to
consciousness and rapidly returning strength. But the renewed lights
exposed a sight almost too frightful to mention. Every man of us was
crimson from escaped blood, which seemed to have oozed forth, like a
pale-red dew, from every pore of our bodies.</p>

<p>Messrs. Bonflon and De Aery, when they came to realize the danger
from which we had so narrowly escaped, were nearly dumb with horror.
The lively Frenchman exhibited a sensibility which the extremity of his
single peril, a day or two before, had failed to call up. He wept
aloud. Mr. Bonflon was circumspect and thoughtful. He did not lose his
Yankee balance; but both of them, each in his own way, overwhelmed me
with expressions of obligation.</p>

<p>But the dangers of this dreadful night--a night which can never pass
from my recollection--were not yet over. We were all gathered in the
main cabin, congratulating each other, next after our escape, on our
rapidly returning strength,--happy in the thought that our trip out,
though sprinkled with danger, was so near a prosperous completion, and
almost momently expecting to hear the stroke of the bell which should
announce to us that the red light to designate our place of landing was
in sight, when, instead of the silver ring of this messenger of peace,
we were startled and horrified by an alarm of fire.</p>

<p>Bonflon and De Aery rushed to the engine-room. A cloud of smoke
poured out from the door by which they disappeared. They were gone only
for a moment; for no man could remain in the hell of flames and vapors
into which they ventured and live. They came out dragging with them the
half-suffocated, scorched, and blazing engineer. How the accident
occurred, it was impossible to divine and useless to inquire. Closing
the door tightly after them to confine the flames, where confinement,
except for the briefest period, among matter so combustible, and
partitions scarcely more formidable than those of a paper bandbox, was
clearly impossible, they threw the burning engineer into our arms, and
themselves took the management of the craft.</p>

<p>De Aery, in this crisis, rose from the man to the hero, almost to a
demigod. His orders rung through the startled air clear and round like
the voice of a golden bell. Bonflon seconded him with coolness and
decision. With us a moment sufficed to extinguish the burning garments
of the engineer; but by that time the flames had burst from the
engine-room, and that part of the beautiful boat was a ragged,
crackling ruin.</p>

<p>Fleeing to the upper deck, and taking refuge in the bow, we became
sensible that we were descending through the air with frightful
rapidity. When the accident occurred, we were already at a low level,
on the look-out for the signal at our station. This circumstance was in
our favor, if anything could be, when a danger so imminent and dreadful
was pressing. Land, like a hazy shadow, was just discoverable in the
dim distance below us; and oh for one foot of it as a place of rest!
But if it were possible to escape the flames, it was clear enough that
we must be dashed in pieces against the solid earth.</p>

<p>De Aery was now the only one remaining in the stern. He was exposed
to great peril, but refused to quit his post while it remained possible
to control in any degree the motions of the vessel. The flames played
about him without shaking his courage or his coolness, and broke
through upon the upper deck and separated him from us with a seething
hedge and whirlpool of fire. We lost sight of him, and supposed he had
perished, when suddenly his voice, issuing from the midst of the
furnace, rung on our ears like a trumpet.</p>

<p>"Up the ropes! quit the ship, or you die, every man of you!" he
shouted; and at the same time we discovered him emerging from the
flames and smoke, and ascending the network which enveloped the balloon
and connected it with the ship. We followed his example; some of our
number--the more timid or the more daring, it would be difficult to say
which--continuing the ascent until they had reached the upper surface
of the gas-chamber, and placed its entire fragile bulk between them and
the hazard they most dreaded.</p>

<p>The momentary refuge afforded by these upper works was scarcely
attained, when the bow, where we had stood but a minute before, and the
whole hull of the "Flying Cloud" with it, blended together in one mass
of surging fire. The appearance in the heavens of this strange sight,
to a watcher at some rancho, or in the not distant city of San
Francisco, if such there were, must have afforded a more vivid
illustration of the fall of a blazing star or meteoric wonder than
astronomer has ever put on record.</p>

<p>But I delay the catastrophe. Land and water soon became
distinguishable from each other beneath us, and hills from valleys, and
forests from bare plains. There was little wind, except the fierce
currents rushing upward, produced by the heat of our own conflagration.
This, for the time, subdued everything to itself, and, as we approached
the ground, served by its direction to modify the fury of our descent.
The denser lower atmosphere also contributed to the same end; and, most
fortunately, when we reached the earth, and the collision came, we
struck in water instead of on the land.</p>

<p>Still, the collision was a fierce one. With the mass of fire between
us and the ground directly below, blinded by the smoke and half
suffocated by the heat, we were not conscious of the good fortune that
awaited us, until, with a swoop and a plunge, we found ourselves
submerged, and, with an equal velocity, immediately thrown back again
by the buoyant force of the balloon into the open air. The flood of
fire in which we had descended was instantly extinguished; and we awoke
to a sense of our possible safety in darkness rendered doubly profound
by the contrast.</p>

<p>Daylight was near at hand. By a careful adjustment of our weights we
kept the balloon from rolling, and sustained ourselves above the water
among the netting. As morning came, we discovered we had landed in a
small lake, hardly large enough to be dignified with the name, but
obviously of considerable depth. The shore was not distant; and as the
day was sultry, with a little grateful labor at swimming and towing, on
the part of a few of us, we soon reached it. There we examined into
each other's condition. Scarce one of us but was able to show damage by
fire, or from too rough contact with the fragments of the "Flying
Cloud," which preceded us in our plunge into the lake. But no bones
were broken, and no one badly flayed. The case of the engineer was the
worst; but even he was able to keep upon his feet, and pronounced in no
danger.</p>

<p>No hut or field or sign of inhabitants was to be seen. With mixed
feelings, in which, for the present at least, the sense of personal
safety triumphed over all regrets, even with Messrs. Bonflon and De
Aery, at the shipwreck of so many brilliant hopes, we scuttled that
part of our craft still afloat, and sunk it in the lake; and with weary
footsteps, but unobstructed with baggage, as near as we could determine
by the aid of a compass, took the direction toward San Francisco. A
couple of hours brought us to the rancho of Senor Jose Dianza, who
received us as a band of pilgrims over the Plains, who, at the hands of
robbers and the elements, had lost everything but life, and helped us
on to the city of the land of gold.</p>

<p>It is needless to detain the reader with the particulars of our
return. They were such only as occur to thousands in the rough and
circuitous transit between San Francisco and New York. We came home by
the Isthmus route, and in ships that ploughed the honest waves. We
explained our absence to our disturbed families and friends as best we
might; and some will remember--and if they do not, they can refresh
their recollection by a reference to the public prints--that several
missing gentlemen of some importance in the world, about that time,
suddenly reappeared upon the stage of action.</p>

<p>We resolved that the whole affair in which we had been engaged
should remain forever buried in oblivion. But time and reflection have
wrought a change with me, though I shall not presume to disturb the
veil which covers my associates. I have come to consider the adventure
quite too good to be lost, and the experiment in aerial navigation,
which came so near proving successful, of too much importance to
science to be suppressed. Hence, conquering my repugnance, I have
decided, on my own responsibility, to give these interesting and
valuable particulars to the world.</p>
