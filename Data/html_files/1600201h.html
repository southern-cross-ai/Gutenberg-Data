<h2><a name="preface" id="preface"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p>I WOULD fain deprecate the censure of severe critics, which the
superficial character of the following pages might otherwise call
forth, by a few words of explanation as to my motives and objects
in publishing them.</p>

<p>Knowing that very many persons at "Home" are deeply interested
in these distant Colonies, as being the residence of dear friends
and relatives, and that, as in the case of my own home-connexions,
they really understand very little of the general aspect of things
here, I believed that a few simple sketches from nature, however
devoid of scientific lore, would be a welcome addition to the
present small fund of information on common every-day topics
relating to these antipodean climes; and of such belief, this
little work is the result.</p>

<p>My aim has been simply to give my own impressions of whatever
appeared worthy observation. I cannot for a moment flatter myself
with the idea of conveying information to those skilled in
scientific detail; my desire was to give true and general
descriptions of scenery, people, and the various objects which
strike a new-comer as novel or remarkable; just, in fact, as they
appeared to myself. I have sketched every-day things with a
faithful and homely pencil; and if the learned find nothing new in
my unvarnished narrative, let them not condemn the unambitious
attempt to amuse and interest the general, and more especially the
young reader. Books of reference I have none, nor can I here obtain
the use of any. My own observation, aided by my husband's long
experience in these Colonies, is my sole resource; therefore,
however defective may be the finish of my picture in detail, the
outline is at least original.</p>

<p>As it is necessarily impossible that I can correct the press
myself, numerous typographical errors are almost unavoidable, and
for which I can only entreat the kind indulgence of my readers.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

Voyage&mdash;Fellow-passengers&mdash;Observance of Character&mdash;Devonshire
Coast&mdash;Pilots&mdash;Land Luxuries&mdash;H.M.S. <i>Hercules</i>&mdash;Eddystone
Lighthouse&mdash;Last Land.</p>

<p>Early in the month of June, 1839, we left England for New South
Wales; and although at the time the voyage seemed to me very
monotonous and devoid of incident, yet, in writing any account of
the interesting objects these colonies present, I cannot pass
altogether silently over the events, however few or trifling, that
served in some measure to vary the tedium of a four months' passage
hither, which I can assure my readers is far more irksome than any
one would imagine who has not endured that unpleasant
captivity.</p>

<p>It is now more than three years since that time, but I remember
most vividly my feelings of disgust on stepping from the chair in
which I was hoisted on board the <i>Letitia</i>, amidst the strange
mêlée on deck. I was too ignorant of nautical matters to make
proper allowance for the slovenly aspect of things in their then
incomplete state of arrangement.</p>

<p>Dirt and confusion seemed to share the sovereignty between them,
and the heterogeneous assemblage of trunks, chests, cases, bags,
hampers, hen-coops, pigs, dogs, coils of rope, sailors and
passengers on deck, made me gladly retreat to our own cabin, where
the final disposal of our various goods and chattels occupied us
the remainder of the evening.</p>

<p>I was greatly amused and puzzled by Mr. Meredith's extreme
caution in lashing every article with ropes to the sides of the
cabin, as well as by having deep cleats of wood nailed to the floor
to keep our chest of drawers, &amp;c. in place. Even my
dressing-case and work-box were tied fast, like a couple of
terrible wild animals, lest they should make a sudden rush at us,
and the candlestick was securely confined in their company. A
convenient shelf, with a strong rail in front, formed an excellent
bookcase; and by the time our various little arrangements were
completed, our apartment, which was considered a most spacious one,
being eight or nine feet square, began to look more snug and
habitable than I had believed possible.</p>

<p>Having a stern-cabin, we had the advantage of half the skylight
and two stern-windows, which enabled us to enjoy more air and
light, and be less annoyed by unpleasant odours, than in any other
part of the vessel.</p>

<p>Contrary winds rendered our progress very slow for some days,
and that miserable visitation, sea-sickness, kept me almost wholly
in my berth, where I lay wearily listening to the novel and strange
noises all around me, and hearing with some impatience of our
repeated approaches to the French coast, as we slowly beat down the
Channel.</p>

<p>To a novice at sea, every hour, nay, every moment, brings some
greater or less misery. Even in comparatively still weather, the
motion of the vessel, however slight, seems almost intolerable, and
you helplessly roll from side to side of your narrow berth, with
many a thump and bruise&mdash;the best preventive of the latter being a
pretty tight wedge, consisting of a desk or box, and pillows. You
watch the swing; tray, cloaks, towels, or whatever else is hung up
in the cabin, performing various extraordinary gyrations, that make
you most unpleasantly giddy as you contemplate the extempore
waltzing party, enlivened perhaps by the gentle melody of a couple
of sailors holy-stoning the deck overhead, and you are fain to
believe your discomfort at its height; but be not too sanguine;
skylights <i>will</i> sometimes have broken panes, and
"bull's-eyes"* are notoriously apt to be leaky, in either of which
cases your toilet, such as it is, or your bed, becomes saturated
with dirty salt-water. Perhaps a cup of some inexplicable
sea-compound, called, by a stretch of courtesy, tea or coffee, is
brought to you, and, with the most laudable intention of conveying
it to your lips, you feel a sudden jerk, and perceive an empty cup
fast grasped in your trembling hands, and find that its former
contents are communicating an agreeable warmth and moisture to your
feet, not much to the improvement of the white counterpane, but
greatly to the diversion of your more experienced companion, who,
with provoking coolness, inquires, "Why do you pour your breakfast
down there?"</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Thick glasses inserted in a ship's deck to
light the cabins, and favourite spots for people to stand upon when
you are reading below.]</p>

<p>At length, with a heroism not to be lightly appreciated, you
resolve to have done playing the invalid, and to go on deck; in an
agony of fear, and great dubiousness respecting the relative
positions of horizontal and perpendicular you perform a painful
toilet, and may be considered fortunate in escaping any serious
hurt. The extraordinary activity of all inanimate articles is a
great annoyance and puzzle for a while; nothing can stand still
where you put it. Every comb and brush seems possessed, going
jumping about in the most inconvenient manner the moment you
require them, and are nearly certain to hop into some impossible
corner, as though on purpose to perplex their distressed and
unsteady owner in the recovery. When, after all these trials, you
cautiously open the door, prepared to make a resolute sally to the
"companion" stairs, ten to one but some unlucky bucket, lantern, or
other obstacle, lies in wait to embarrass your wavering steps; or a
sudden lurch of the ship plunges you headlong into that singular
combination of unpleasantnesses, the steward's pantry! At length,
faint and bewildered, you gain the deck, and sink down on the first
resting-place you see, glad to feel the fresh invigorating breeze,
and enjoy the clear cheering sunshine. Such at least were my own
feelings on this my first voyage, and I doubt not that most novices
have a like ordeal of the uncomfortable to pass through.</p>

<p>As soon as I began to recover, and take a glance around, there
were the faces and aspects of our fellow-passengers to be perused
with something of anxiety, as it is a point of no trivial
importance on such a voyage, that the few persons with whom you can
associate, and with whom you cannot avoid coming in daily contact
for four months, should at least be companionable. I cannot
conceive any situation in life more favourable to the exposure of
real characters and dispositions than a long voyage. Assumed
manners of refinement, counterfeit blandness and courtesy, and, in
fact, every species and form of affectation, are insensibly
forgotten. Those who are really ill-tempered, find so much for
their humour to feed on, that the surly countenance remains
uncontradicted by the soft and obsequious manner; the truly vulgar
are too much engrossed by dear self to seek the favour of others by
pretended refinement; and the harmless little arts of "pretty
virginities," finding how vain is the hope of stimulating to
admiration beings whose every faculty and thought are engrossed by
their own petty distresses, are fain to reserve their efforts for a
more favourable season. But when all the counterfeits have lost
their gilding, the true metal is the precious coin still; and how
valuable in so narrow a circle is unfeigned good-temper, and that
only true politeness which springs from kindness of heart, none
will perfectly understand who have not had specimens of both kinds
in their "compagnons de voyage."</p>

<p>We were fortunate in being able to select a very pleasant circle
from the small community on board, as one by one they shook off the
prevalent indisposition, and reduced their unhappy, pale, elongated
faces to their wonted fair proportions.</p>

<p>When I came on deck on the 8th day of our voyage, I found we
were running along the Devonshire coast before a light breeze,
under as bright a blue sky as ever made England look thrice lovely
in the eyes of those who were leaving her, perhaps for ever. Many
vessels which, like ourselves, had been detained by the adverse
winds, were now in sight, their white wing-like sails fairly
spread, and taking all advantage of the welcome change. Sea-gulls
swept majestically by, their arched and outspread wings glancing
brightly in the sunlight, and their easy, graceful motion seeming a
scornful reproach to the unsteady awkward movements of such novices
at sea as myself. As we neared Plymouth, where we had to put in for
some passengers, a pilot came on board, and the careless yet secure
activity with which he sprang from his boat up the ship's side and
on deck seemed worthy of Ducrow himself, unable as <i>I</i> was to
go three steps without holding on by something.</p>

<p>I felt quite a respect for that bronzed weather-beaten seaman,
as I thought of the inestimable services he and his fellows, the
Channel pilots, render both to our own and foreign shipping. In
rough or foggy weather, when vessels ignorant of the difficult
navigation of the Channel would, but for their guidance, be
inevitably lost, they are out in their boats braving such seas,
that it does seem almost miraculous such mere boats can live in
them. But however stormy the weather or dark the night, there are
the pilots ready at the known signal to run alongside and leap upon
the stranger's deck. They are most brave and gallant fellows, and
many a good ship owes to them the lives of her crew and the safety
of her rich freight.</p>

<p>We entered Plymouth Sound in the evening, and for the last time
watched the sun set on English hills and woods. I felt as if to set
foot on land only for a few minutes would be the greatest
imaginable treat; but we cast anchor so late, that I was compelled
to forego the pleasure, and sat on deck watching the boats as they
went ashore, thinking their passengers must be almost too happy. A
late repast of fresh bread, clean, land-made bread, fresh butter,
strawberries, and clouted cream, however, almost consoled me for my
previous disappointment. A lucky mortal, permitted to taste the
ambrosia of the Gods, would not find it half so delicious as would
a poor sea-sick creature, a victim to the unknown atrocious
compounds of a dirty black sea-steward, think such a feast as
mine!</p>

<p>We were up and on deck early the following morning, unwilling to
lose a minute's view of the beautiful scenery around. A man-of-war,
the <i>Hercules</i>, lying in the harbour, sent a boat to
reconnoitre our crew, greatly to the discomfort and apprehension of
our captain, but fortunately without depriving him of any "hands."
I listened to the morning music on board the <i>Hercules</i>, and
thought that our grand national air, "Rule Britannia," much as I
ever admired it, never sounded so beautiful as then; and I wept to
think I should perhaps never more hear it in my own beloved native
land.</p>

<p>We weighed anchor between six and seven o'clock, and in passing
the <i>Hercules</i> made a polite nautical salutation, by lowering
our royals (an obeisance always expected by ships of war from the
humbler body of merchantmen); and the officer on duty ordered the
band aft to give us a cheering and melodious farewell as we left
the harbour.</p>

<p>We had a fine view for some time of the lovely shores of Devon,
and of that noble effort of human science and perseverance, the
Eddystone Lighthouse. How mean and contemptible, beside such a
fabric, erected for so great and good a purpose, seem by comparison
the mere gewgaw palaces of luxury and ostentation, so profusely
scattered over our fair country! and yet how few, how very few
erections of a like kind are there, inestimable as is their value
in the saving of human <i>life</i>, to say nothing of less precious
matters!*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Why was not the "Nelson Monument" a
Lighthouse? I can can conceive no fabric of more grandeur and
costliness half so acceptable to the spirit it is designed to
honour, as the humblest erection devoted to such a service.]</p>

<p>A short time before sunset I went below, intending to return on
deck and watch the <i>last land</i> fade on the horizon, but on my
coming to look for it, an envious bank of clouds hung over the
spot, and totally hid it. Some one began singing, "Isle of Beauty,
fare thee well!"&mdash;had they <i>felt</i> half as much as I did, they
could not have uttered a single note.</p>

the <i>Cherub</i>&mdash;Fear of Pirates&mdash;Porpoises&mdash;Flying Fish&mdash;Capture
of a Boneto&mdash;Dolphins.</p>

<p>We were now fairly "at sea," with no chance of any
<i>pleasant</i> variety of scene, as, unluckily for us, our "good
ship Argo" was to make a direct passage to Sydney, without touching
at any intermediate port. Like true philosophers, we consoled
ourselves by the reflection that, as some compensation for the
disappointment, our voyage would be the more speedy from having no
interruption; though to sail half round the world, and be
<i>near</i> so many interesting and beautiful spots, of which I had
heard and read so much, and not to see even one of them&mdash;not
Madeira, with its vine-clad hills&mdash;nor Teneriffe, nor even the
Cape, that general "half-way house" for poor exiles like
ourselves&mdash;certainly appeared rather hard, and, as I considered it,
great waste of time and travelling.</p>

<p>The Bay of Biscay, so renowned in song and story for its stormy
winds and waves, was happily in a most pacific mood when we crossed
it with a fair light breeze and sunny weather; and though the fine
old song was often quoted at the time, we had no disastrous
consequences to remind us</p>

<p class="poem">"Of the day<br>
When we lay<br>
In the Bay of Biscay O!"</p>

<p>We "sighted" the Spanish and Portuguese coasts, and with glasses
could discern trees and white houses or cottages; and as wishful
imagination converted every green thing into an orangery or a
vineyard, our distant gazes made us still more anxious for a nearer
investigation of the good things we fancied there. But the
inexorable ship sailed on, and hills, vineyards, and cottages faded
into mist again.</p>

<p>I passed every day on deck, busy with that most pleasant of all
"fancy-work," wool embroidery; and to it I owe my exemption from
much of the overpowering ennui so general on a long voyage. To
<i>study</i> is, I think, impossible, and I very soon disposed of
all the light reading to be found on board, when compelled by
illness or bad weather to remain below. But my work-basket and
frame were my daily companions, and I was often told how enviable
was my happiness in having something to employ me.</p>

<p>Many evenings we spent in watching the beautiful phosphoric
appearance of the sea after dark, and trying to reconcile the
various theories advanced by naturalists respecting it. That it is
caused by floating animalcula is the general opinion; but if so,
they must be as innumerable as motes in the sunshine, or as grains
of sand upon the sea-shore, else how are the myriad millions of
glittering lights to be accounted for that sparkle in a single
wave? Some are much larger and brighter than the rest, bearing
about the same proportion to each other as do stars of the first
and sixth magnitude, and these larger points may, by close
watching, be traced for several seconds, whilst the smaller ones
flash and disappear simultaneously. I know of nothing to which I
can compare this most beautiful and wonderful appearance, unless I
have recourse to Sindbad's Diamond Valley, and beg you to fancy
millions of millions of jewel-sparks, and a few thousands of larger
brilliants, all rapidly whirling and glancing in one vivid
glittering mass: but even diamonds would not shine alone in a dark
night, so <i>that</i> simile will not do. The bright creatures&mdash;if
creatures they are&mdash;do not seem to extend far down into the sea,
because I have observed, in looking over the stern, that
<i>immediately</i> following the rudder there always remained a
small dark space beyond which the separated waves full of lights
united again, and formed a long bright pathway on the water in the
wake of the ship. The phosphoric lights seemed roused to life by
the passage of the vessel through them; a fish swimming past
produced the same effect on a smaller scale; a bucket of water from
the brightest part lost all the glittering appearance almost
instantly when hoisted on deck. The colour of the lights was
bluish, or just what a purely white light would be, seen through
the blue water. Perhaps the spray of a "jet d'eau," seen in a
strong moonlight, would give the best idea of this most
indescribable phenomenon. I was never weary of watching it, and
often, after leaving my usual evening-seat by the taffrail, could
not help returning again and again for one more dazzled, earnest
gaze.</p>

<p>I first saw those carious and beautiful little animals the
Portuguese men-of-war, <i>Physalus pelagicus</i> of naturalists, in
about 36° N. lat., and for many days they were very numerous,
robbing my work of nearly all my attention in gazing at their
elegant forms and colours. I had a few caught, to examine them more
closely. They consist of a flat, thin, transparent membrane, from
one and a half to two inches long, of an oval shape and on the
upper side of this, down the centre, runs a similar membrane
standing erect, at right angles with the flat one. A whole wafer
laid on the table, and the half of another placed edgewise upon it
(the straight side downwards, of course), will give some idea of
the form of the animal, or rather of the tiny ship's deck and sail.
The under part is furnished with several rows of tentacula
spreading out like a beautiful flower, varying in colour in
different specimens, and sometimes even in one, through many shades
of blue, pink, and soft purple. A slight coloured film also
envelops the transparent membrane above described, giving it a
beautiful iridescent appearance when sailing along in the sunshine.
By putting them in a basin of sea-water, I was enabled to keep and
observe them for some time; but when taken out of their natural
element, the delicate tentacula shrink and dissolve away very soon;
though with care the thin glassy membrane with its fragile sail may
be permanently preserved by drying.</p>

<p>Their method of navigation is not the least interesting point to
notice in these fairy-mariners. I have frequently observed one
sailing complacently along, his arms, like the many oars of an
ancient galley, spread around him, and his delicate glassy sail set
full to the breeze; when a sudden puff of wind has overset him
altogether, and plunged the whole fabric under water: the next
instant he is up again as gay as before, but at first only presents
his sail <i>edgewise</i> to the wind, and then seems to tack about
very cautiously, as if to try how much canvas he can carry in
safety. This <i>may</i> not be really the case, but I have watched
many do exactly as I describe, and must therefore believe in their
nautical skill. Like other creatures of their class, they no doubt
feed on minute molusca and animalcula, which they entrap in their
numerous tentacula, or arms. Their lower side very much resembles
some of the beautiful sea anemones* so common on rocks covered at
high-water on this coast,** and, from what I remember, there are
similar ones on those of England.***</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Actinia anemone</i>, or <i>Actinia
calendula</i>, probably.]<br>
<br>
[** Oyster Bay, Van Diemen's Land.]<br>
<br>
[*** I believe De Blainville mentions six species of Physalus; and
from, having seen descriptions of <i>P. pelagicus</i> differing in
many points from my own observation of the animal, I am induced to
believe that various species are described as the same by different
persons. In the 'Tasmanian Journal of Science,' a paper (by A.
Sinclair, Esq., Surgeon, R. N.) descriptive of a <i>Physalus
pelagiqus</i>, mentions, among other features I did not observe in
it, the property of stinging severely, possessed by the tentacula,
and retained even after the animal has been dried; also that the
water in which it had floated had caused violent pain and
inflammation in the hands and arms of two boys employed to wash out
the tub. As I repeatedly handled the specimens I had caught, both
before and after death, and received no injury, there must be an
essential difference in the species.]</p>

<p>Some poor little swallows, apparently worn out with fatigue,
alighted on the rigging one day, and hovered about the ship. The
sailors caught and tried to feed some of them; and one that flew
into our cabin through the stern-window, I endeavoured to tempt
with soaked biscuit, crumbs, and water, but could not prevail on my
poor little patient to eat anything. I left him alone, hoping he
would grow more assured, but he escaped, and was found lying dead
on the deck a day or two after. I imagine the poor birds had either
been blown off the land, or, having been baffled by contrary winds
in their migratory voyage, had become too much exhausted to fly any
farther: no doubt many thousands of them must perish at sea from
similar causes. I have heard Mr. Meredith mention that on his
voyage home (to England) in 1838, a beautiful little bird, of a
species he was quite unacquainted with, flew on board the ship, and
fed greedily on soaked biscuit; <i>so</i> greedily indeed,
forgetting the needful precautions to be observed by starving
people, that he literally died from repletion.</p>

<p>Finding we should pass tolerably near Teneriffe, I became
extremely anxious for a good day-view of the Peak, and only feared
sailing by in the night and losing it. We certainly passed by day,
about midway between Teneriffe and the "Great Canary," but the
mountain was thickly veiled in clouds, nearly to the water's edge,
so that a mere shoal or sandbank had been as fine an object. If I
could only have seen the merest point of the summit, I had not
cared; I sat "like (im-)patience on a monument," wailing for one
clear loophole in those gloomy morose clouds, but in vain&mdash;and I
still have to take on credit all the grand and inflated
descriptions of other more fortunate travellers.</p>

<p>As I did not at the time think I should ever require any
memoranda of our monotonous voyage, I kept no regular "log-book,"
or journal, which now I much regret, as I am without exact data for
many occurrences. About the beginning of July we spoke a
homeward-bound vessel, the <i>Cherub</i> and gladly availed
ourselves of the opportunity to send letters home. The prudent ones
had all letters ready written, but I confess I was not one of that
number, and a few hurried words of love and greeting were all the
homeward-bound <i>Cherub</i> bore from me.</p>

<p>There is something peculiarly grand, and withal touching, in
that meeting of ships on the wide ocean. People who never heard of
each other before, who might live in the same street of the same
city for years without knowing each other's face, thus meeting on
that trackless highway of the world, the sea, look on one another
as if some mysterious communion between them were at once
established. I do not mean individually, but generally, for,
although I might not accurately observe the face of any one human
being on board that vessel, yet I felt as if they were
<i>friends</i> whom we had met; and as she afterwards went on her
way, and we on ours, I looked after her lessening sails with real
regret.</p>

<p>After being for days and weeks at sea without any object to
break the line of the horizon, that seems to shut in the same
eternal circle of water, it is absolutely a treat, an indescribable
delight to the eye, to see so beautiful an object as a vessel in
full sail gradually nearing, and so occupying a greater portion of
the wearisome sea-view. Everything about her is busily discussed,
and not unfrequently the inexperienced are gravely informed that
she is an "ill-looking craft," "a rakish-looking brig," "very much
the cut of a privateer," &amp;c., and mysterious hints are given
about muskets, cutlasses, and ammunition, till the well-known
ensign with its union-jack is seen spreading to the breeze as they
hoist it on board the stranger, and in reply to "Ship ahoy! What
ship's that?" a gruff English accent, made thrice gruffer and
rougher by bawling into a speaking-trumpet, informs you that the
suspicious craft is the <i>Mary</i> or <i>Betsey</i>, or some other
good old household name, of London or Liverpool, bound from &mdash;&mdash;;
whereupon the captain of our ship returns a like series of
explanations, latitudes and longitudes are compared, and the
interview closes.</p>

<p>As we neared the line, I confess I used to pay most especial
attention to the various conjectures raised on the approach of a
strange sail, especially if those learned in such matters seemed
suspicious of her aspect or manoeuvres; but I am most happy to say
I have no thrilling narratives of fearful engagements or
providential escapes to relate, as we were never molested by any of
the piratical fraternity. This was fortunate, as our ship, like
most merchantmen, carried her guns snugly and securely stowed away
in the hold along with her cargo; which arrangement, though
doubtless originating in a praiseworthy care of her means of
defence, was not exactly calculated to facilitate the use of them,
had it been needed. A few rusty muskets, and some pistols of most
pacific temperaments, were ostentatiously ranged round the
mizzen-mast in the mess-cabin; but, like the broken teacups on the
alehouse chimney-piece, were, I fear, only "kept for show."</p>

<p>Porpoises were a frequent source of amusement to me; for I
exceedingly enjoy watching their ponderous gaiety as they leap and
flounce about, and the agility with which they bound out of the
water is most astonishing. We often saw them leap as high as the
fore-yard, and I used to think they would fairly alight on the
forecastle; but I fancy they knew better than to trust their lives
and oleaginous bodies to the tender mercies of the sailors, who
would infallibly have despatched and eaten them very speedily.
Prodigious shoals of them often crossed our track, and might be
seen in thousands gambolling as far as their black bodies were
visible above the water. My admiration of their elephantine frolics
became so well known, that if I chanced to he below when a shoal
was seen, I immediately received a message informing me of the
event, and lost no time in hastening to see the sport.</p>

<p>What a contrast to the unwieldy monsters I have just mentioned
are the elegant little flying-fish <i>(Exocetus volitans)</i>! I
had no idea they were so beautiful, having been misled by bad
engravings, which represented them as thin, shrivelled,
starved-looking things, while in reality they are beautifully
proportioned, and quite plump, with shining bluish silvery scales,
that flash brightly as they glance in the sun. They are about nine
or ten inches long, the pectoral fins, or wings, about six inches,
and capable of expanding to about three inches and a half at the
broadest part; and from tip to tip, when spread, must measure above
twelve inches. The eyes are remarkably large and fine, giving an
expression to the head more like the glance of a bird than a fish;
"fishy eyes" being proverbially dull and lustreless. Only one fell
on board, which was brought to me, and, in justice to the memory of
the poor defunct, I must confess that, after preserving his wings
and tail, I found his remains very delicate eating.</p>

<p>So many arguments have been held with respect to these curious
creatures, as to whether they really <i>fly</i>, that is, flutter
and turn in the air, or merely leap from the top of one wave to
fall on the top of another, that nothing but positive proof could
induce me to say a word on the subject. I have attentively observed
them rise from the water, flutter their fins rapidly, not unlike a
lark when first rising; then sail along a short time, <i>turn</i>,
at various angles from their course, whether in a breeze or calm;
and, after being many seconds in the air, dip again into the sea,
preparatory to another flight. I have continually mistaken them for
birds, being quite deceived by their fluttering motion, so
different from what I should have supposed any fish capable of.
Some very eminent naturalists affirm that they can neither turn nor
flutter; having <i>seen</i> them do both repeatedly, I am greatly
inclined to differ from them in opinion, and to suppose that they
must have observed these beautiful little creatures under some
circumstances which prevented or disguised their real
movements.</p>

<p>With all their beauty and accomplishments, the poor little
flying-fish seem to lead a most restless and unhappy life. As they
swim through the sea, the swift and hungry boneto pursues them with
a keen and deadly purpose, seeming quite as well aware as myself of
their delicate flavour; the dolphin also wages war against them;
and the moment they quit the water to escape these ravenous foes, a
voracious sea-bird is nearly sure to pounce upon some of the
quivering fugitives.</p>

<p>We were sailing for three days through shoals of boneto, and all
kinds of murderous devices were adopted for the capture of some,
but to no purpose. Fish-hooks, harpoons, &amp;c., were all in
request, and the excitement became extreme, to see shoals of fish
all around, darting hither and thither in hundreds, all "fit to
eat," as the sailors declared, and none to be got! It was terribly
exciting, and figures might be seen in every direction, attired in
all imaginable variety of costume, and in more than every
imaginable attitude, most perseveringly hurling among and hauling
in again their innocent weapons. At last, Mr. Meredith, who had
constantly told them it was of no use, that the fish were scarcely
ever taken, &amp;c., went out on the lower studding-sail boom with
a grains (a large strong fork of five barbed points) and a long
line attached; he had scarcely sat five minutes, when he struck and
hauled up a fine boneto, to the exceeding great delight of the
spectators, whose mania for the sport was tenfold increased by the
seeming ease of the achievement. But it was a lucky accident that
was not repeated by any one, and Mr. Meredith, being quite
satisfied with having caught one, did not make another attempt.</p>

<p>It was a large handsome fish, very much the shape of a salmon,
and presenting a succession of rich iridescent colours, such as are
described in the dolphin when dying. It was cooked, and served, at
least part of it, at our table; but being fried, and rather dry and
hard, it was not much admired.</p>

<p>I was extremely curious to see a real live dolphin, for my ideas
of the creature were such a singular medley of classical-picture
dolphins as big as calves, with fat tritons astride upon them; and
spouting-fountain dolphins, much of the same character, with heads
bored like the rose of a watering-pot; and public-house sign-board
dolphins, something between St. George's dragon, and a legless,
curly-tailed pig&mdash;that I wished to have my wavering notions
somewhat settled: and one bright day in the tropics, as we lay
becalmed or nearly so, I was leaning over the vessel's side,
looking deep, deep into the bluest of all blue water, clear and
bright as crystal, when three fish, of a kind quite new to me, came
close to the ship, swimming to and fro, as if examining, the state
of our coppering; some one said very quietly, "Hush! those are
dolphins," and so I guessed, but not from any resemblance they bore
to my ancient friends of the name. These were really very
beautiful; their size I cannot accurately tell, for I found myself
so often deceived in the relative proportion of things seen in a
similar manner. The boneto, as it swam past, only seemed to me the
size of a large mackerel, and when brought on deck I found it
exceeded that of a salmon. The dolphins might be four feet long, or
more, of a slender shape, with a head rather blunt than pointed,
but not in the least heavy or clumsy-looking: on the contrary, I
never saw anything more elegant than their form and motion; their
long bodies, as they swam, making a perfect "line of beauty" of
several curves, and their large fins and tails waving like fans in
the water.</p>

<p>Their colour appeared a delicate silvery blue, deepening by
parts into purple; and as they partially turned up their bright
sides to the sun, a gleam of prismatic colours gave evidence of
there being at least some truth in the story of their rainbow hues
when dying.</p>

<p>Much to my satisfaction, no attempt was made to capture any of
these; I noticed them for some time sporting round the vessel, and
then they passed on, having most permanently established my faith
in the beauty of the dolphin and the ignorance of his carvers and
limners.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">Calm in the
Tropics&mdash;Sharks&mdash;Turtle&mdash;Ianthins&mdash;Shovel-board&mdash;"Crossing the
line"&mdash;Loss of the North Star&mdash;Southern Constellations&mdash;Moonlight
in the Tropics&mdash;Sunsets&mdash;Waterspouts&mdash;"Sun-dogs."</p>

<p>A CALM at sea in the tropics, though by no means desirable for a
continuance, is yet very beautiful for a short time; one may well
endure a few hours' delay, even in such a climate, for the sake of
observing the novel expression of the face of nature. The usually
restless sea, the very emblem of life and vigour, seems in a deep
slumber; not a ripple nor the tiniest wave that ever broke ruffles
its glassy smoothness; it might now serve to typify death rather
than life, but for a slow, long, heavy swell, that seems to lift up
the drowsy waters as it rolls along; now and then the peculiar
dorsal fin of a shark cuts through the still, sluggish mass, or a
turtle, fast asleep, floats by, basking in the fervid sunshine.</p>

<p>On such a day as this, when every one felt particularly disposed
to envy the fishes, and the life of a frog in a cool brook seemed
the height of luxury, a boat was lowered, and a party of five,
including Mr. Meredith, put off a considerable distance for the
purpose of bathing, though the ostensible reason was "merely to see
how the ship looked." I sat at work under the awning, looking from
time to time at the boat, until it was so far away that the swell
hid it from my view, and then heard those who could still see it
from the shrouds say that the five were bathing, and some of them
far away from the boat, among whom I very justly supposed was my
husband, from his being an excellent swimmer.</p>

<p>The next instant one of the men aloft screamed out, "Oh God!
there are two large sharks close to them!" <i>My</i> feelings
<i>may</i> perhaps be imagined&mdash;certainly not expressed. The
probability was that the swell would hide the monsters from their
victims until too late for escape. <i>I</i> could see the sharks,
which were on the top of a swell, but not the boat, which lay in
the hollow beyond; and, almost wild With terror, joined my weak
voice to the shouts of warning sent from the ship, till I heard the
welcome cry, "They are all safe." The bathers had not seen the
sharks till after they returned to the boat, when immediately the
huge monsters rose alongside and followed for some distance,
doubtless in the hope of another chance, in which, I scarcely need
say, they were disappointed.</p>

<p>Several turtle were seen that day: the boating party nearly
captured a large one, but it escaped; with a smaller one they were
more adroit, finding it soundly</p>

<p class="poem">"Sleeping on the water,<br>
And by good fortune, gliding softly, caught her,"</p>

<p>much to the satisfaction of the "gastronomes;" but either the
cook or the turtle was deficient in good qualities, for it was
greatly inferior to the same article as dressed on shore.</p>

<p>During the morning's excursion many of those beautiful and
delicate shells the <i>Ilanthina fragilis</i> were observed
floating about. Mr. Meredith brought me two fine ones with the
animal in, and I put them in a basin of sea-water to observe them.
The head of the creature, instead of being close to the aperture of
the shell, seemed some distance within, half a whorl at least, and
the intervening space filled by a quantity of bubbly membrane,
which likewise protruded from the aperture, of a deep violet
colour; the shell was a lighter shade of the same lovely hue, and
on removing the animal from it after death, my hands were so deeply
stained with purple that it was some days before they lost the
marks. The bubbles, which occupied the mouth of the shell, appeared
only filled with air, and I supposed them to be employed by the
creature as a float; most probably he has the power of discharging
the air from them (in the same way that the nautilus is supposed to
do, from the inner chambers of his shell) when he wishes to sink,
although I did not observe any effort of the kind; but very
possibly some of the delicate organs might have been injured, and
their power destroyed, before the fragile things reached me.</p>

<p>Every one remembers the wise and cogent reason which worthy
"Master Slender" assigns for his "not abiding the smell of roast
meat," namely, that he once broke his shins when playing at
<i>shovel-board</i> with a master of fence for a dish of stewed
prunes;" but perhaps many, like myself, have been long in ignorance
of the nature of this renowned game. One of our friends on board
having proposed it as a good amusement in calm days, and when the
ship was tolerably steady, it became very popular among the
gentlemen, and proved a source of much diversion to me as a
looker-on.</p>

<p>A square of about three feet diameter, divided into nine small
squares, is chalked on the deck, forward, and a figure marked in
each square, from 1 up to 9. The players have each two or three
"boards," being circular pieces of inch-thick wood, about four
inches wide; these are thrown slidingly along the deck, and of
course aimed at the highest numbers; if they are lucky enough to
rest there, the next player endeavours to <i>shovel</i> them out,
and leave his own in; those counting most at the end winning the
game. Any one standing in the way of a well-thrown shovel-board,
and feeling the keenness of the blow, will fully commiserate poor
Master Blender's mischance.</p>

<p>As we neared the "line," many grave discussions were held as to
the degree of licence to be allowed the sailors in their usual
commemorative sports on the occasion of crossing it; and poor
Neptune's humble and complimentary petition lay so long unanswered
at head-quarters, that few or no preparations were made among the
crew. Unfortunately the harmony and good feeling which
uninterruptedly pervaded our own especial "coterie" was far from
universal in the small community on board; and any general
participation in the mummery and somewhat rough usage of the
sea-king's visit was therefore refused, the maskers being forbidden
to come on the quarter-deck.</p>

<p>This being understood, the usual ceremony of Neptune's hailing
the ship was effectively performed overnight, the god taking his
departure in a fiery chariot, which matter-of-fact people will
persist in explaining to be only a tar-barrel lighted and set
afloat. The next day his Majesty, gorgeously attired in a painted
canvas crown, and robes to correspond, with a magnificent display
of oakum in the shape of hair and beard, accompanied by his
secretary, chaplain, coachman, and other general officers of state
similarly accoutred, approached the quarter-deck, on which we were
all assembled, and made a very clever speech. Mr. Meredith, as
spokesman of our party, replied with due form and etiquette, and
begged to offer, as a token of our allegiance and duty, a tribute
of certain monies, which his Majesty most graciously ordered his
secretary to receive with all due acknowledgments. Mr. Meredith
then ventured a supposition that his Majesty was fond of sporting,
and expressed a hope that he was not much annoyed by poachers in
his kingdom.&mdash;"Why, no, sir," replied the god, "not much; but
<i>you</i> know, sir, there are <i>some</i> daring rascals who
don't care whose fish they catch;" and in the laugh that followed
this attack on the captor of the boneto, his Majesty and suite,
which included a nondescript dragon-like monster, with a very
extensive canvas tail, whom Neptune termed his dog, turned towards
their allotted scene of action; and the uproar and riot that
followed, caused by the determined resistance of the "intermediate"
passengers to his godship's baptismal ceremonies of shaving and
washing, soon drove me to my own cabin, where I remained till order
was restored.</p>

<p>Our Neptune on the occasion was a fine tall fellow, usually
known as "Long Bill," who had served some years in a man-of-war,
and was a general favourite on board; and being rather a genius in
his way, would no doubt have "got up" the "masque" much more
effectively, had he known it would be permitted.</p>

<p>We happened to cross the line on my birthday, July 20th, so that
I began my new year in a new hemisphere.</p>

<p>Among the many strange changes which a passage from one side of
the world to the other has shown me, I do not know one thing that
<i>felt</i> so much as the loss of the North Star. Night after
night I watched it, sinking lower&mdash;lower; and the well-known "Great
Bear" that I had so gazed at even from a child, that it seemed like
the face of an old friend, was fast going too; it was like parting
from my own loved home-faces over again. I thought of so many times
and places associated in my mind with those bright stars; of those
who had gazed on them beside me, some of whom had for ever passed
from earth,&mdash;and of the rest, who might say that we should ever
meet again? Those stars seemed a last link uniting us, but it was
soon broken&mdash;they sunk beneath the horizon, and the new
constellations of the southern hemisphere seemed to my partial eyes
far less splendid.</p>

<p>The Magellanic clouds made me constantly wish for a view of
their starry hosts through a good astronomical telescope, as I
believe they are among the "resolvable" nebulae. The southern
portion of the galaxy, too, is very beautiful, tracing its double
path of glory over the heavens, and showing so much brighter in the
clear atmosphere of the tropics. The Southern Cross scarcely
satisfied my expectations: I hardly knew myself what those were,
but it seemed less clearly defined than the celestial maps had
represented it. I think many other groups of stars form quite as
perfect crosses. But the crowning glory of tropical nights is the
moon. I remember an enthusiastic friend, on his return from the
shores of the Mediterranean, telling me I had never seen
<i>&gt;moonlight</i>&mdash;that there never was such a thing in England;
and I now began to believe him. There is certainly as much
difference between moonlight in England and in the tropics, as
between twilight and sunshine. The full flood of radiance that is
shed on every object renders all as plainly visible as in broad
noon-day, but the soft colour of the light is delightfully
refreshing to the eye wearied by the insupportable glare of a
tropical sun. It almost seemed as if we ought to follow the moon's
bright example, and "turn night into day," for it was by far the
pleasantest time to be awake.</p>

<p>Having an excellent common telescope, we enjoyed tracing out the
well-known map of the moon's disc, much more clearly than I ever
saw it before. The same glass enabled us to observe well the belts
and satellites of Jupiter, the moon-like form of Venus, and, more
indistinctly, Saturn and his ring. We frequently saw beautiful
meteors and "shooting stars;" and the bright silent lightning,
flashing in the horizon, beguiled many a weary half-hour.</p>

<p>The sunsets too! the indescribably glorious sunsets, so swiftly
changing, and so splendid in every change, were among my constant
enjoyments. Pen and ink are vain to tell their wondrous beauty;
nothing but the pencils of Turner or Danby, in their most inspired
moods, could give a shadow of it. I remember one evening a most
singular appearance; a dense bank of dark clouds had totally
obscured the sun whilst yet high in the heavens, and behind which
he sunk, leaving, as a record of his past glory, golden lines
traced on the higher ridges of the thick vapoury screen. Some
minutes afterwards a strange light gleamed redly forth; and on
looking towards the sunset clouds, we saw, as through small windows
in the dark wall, close to the water's edge, the sun's fiery eye,
glaring along the sea in a track of molten flame. The effect was as
strange as it was new to me; and we never after saw a similar
appearance.</p>

<p>Frequently the sunset sky seemed a celestial "Field of the Cloth
of Gold," with regal banners of purple streaming across it. At
other times bright landscapes of fairy cloud-realms spread forth,
where</p>

<p class="poem">"Hills above hills, and Alps on Alps arose,"</p>

<p>glowing in gem-like hues, as fleeting as they were fair. How
often have I exclaimed, "<i>This</i> is the loveliest sunset we
have had!" for all were so beautiful, the present one seemed ever
the brightest.</p>

<p>We had comparatively few of the heavy falls of rain common in
the tropics, but one day they visited us pretty liberally, in
sudden squalls, between which the sun blazed out with double
intensity. On that day several waterspouts appeared, traversing the
sea with great velocity, but fortunately they only permitted us a
distant view of their dangerous performances. One seemed to travel
a considerable way in the wake of the ship, and we almost feared
would overtake us. We could clearly see the column of whirling
water, ending in a cloud above, and the churning foam at its base,
as it rapidly advanced, but it apparently dispersed in a sudden
squall that crossed its path.</p>

<p>Many of the appearances called by sailors "sun dogs" occurred
during the showery weather. They exhibit the prismatic colours, and
I used to think them portions of rainbows, which they exactly
resemble, but are broad and short, and always rest on the water. A
lunar rainbow was seen one evening, but it was fast fading before I
observed it, and had then but little more colour than a halo.</p>

<p>It is curious to notice how much more we observe the aspects and
objects of the sea and sky when our own especial element, the
<i>earth</i>, is absent from our view; how much more desirous we
feel to cultivate our acquaintance with the sun, moon, and stars;
the clouds, rainbows, meteors; the ocean and its mighty mysteries,
when thus severed from accustomed scenes, pursuits, and
speculations. In the monotony of all days at sea, any variation is
an event; a new fish seen swimming by, or an oddly shaped cloud,
makes a white day in one's calendar; and the remembrance of their
comparative greatness at the time has perhaps caused me to invest
with undue importance many trivial matters scarcely worth the
recital.</p>

<p>Very different from the doubtful notions I held about dolphins
were my ideas of a whale as seen at sea, for in the representation
of these huge monsters of the deep, all painters and gravers are
unanimous in opinion, and alike in their mode of portraiture.
Accordingly I knew perfectly well, when summoned from my cabin by
the report of a whale being in sight, that I should behold an
enormous black mass standing far out of the water, with a huge
semicircular mouth surmounted by two trumpet-like apertures, from
which a double stream of clear water was perpetually flung some
forty or fifty feet into the air, falling again in a graceful
curve, precisely like the "jets-d'eau" in ancient gardens. With
such a foregone conclusion as to what was to be seen, I came on
deck, and gazed round in search of the living fountain I describe;
my inability to discover it being rendered tenfold more vexatious
by hearing the sailors and others exclaim, "There she spouts!" "She
spouts again!" till Mr. Meredith, seeing me vacantly scanning the
whole horizon, drew my attention to one particular spot, where,
after looking intently for about a minute, I observed something
like a puff of steam rise gently from the water; and this was the
<i>spouting</i> of a whale! Many a time since have I laughed at the
recollection, but the shock my faith then received it, will never
recover, nor shall I ever forget the useful lesson I then learned,
not to take too much on credit.</p>

<p>This absurd habit which people have got into, of depicting the
whale as spouting distinct streams of water to such a height,
though it may have originated in ignorance, cannot in these days of
universal knowledge be permitted that apology for its continuance.
But having once created so charming a fiction, I imagine these good
folks are loth to rob the poor whales of the childish admiration
our school-book pictures receive, and so doubtless they will spout
steeple high till the whole real race is extinct&mdash;a palpable proof
of the triumph of romance over reality.</p>

<p>The spout-holes are simply the nostrils of the animal and when,
as he swims along, these chance to be below the surface of the
water at the moment he breathes, the act of respiration blows the
water from within and above the nostrils into the air in the form
of vapour or steam.</p>

<p>The only time when anything like a stream proceeds from the
blow-holes is when the creature is severely wounded; then he
sometimes spouts blood. Frequently a thin haze is observed by
whalers, blowing along the sea like the foamy crest of a wave
scudding before the wind; and following back the course of this
with the eye, the "blow" of a whale is often observed, sending off
these whiffs of vapour. If seen between the boats and the shore, an
inexperienced person would often mistake it for smoke on land.</p>

<p>A parasitical polype, peculiar to the whale, is generally found
firmly attached to the skin of the animal when full-grown,
especially about the head and lips; but it is a curious fact, and
one which I do not remember ever to have seen noticed, that at the
time of birth (and even previously) the young whales are marked
with exact impressions or scars, of the precise form of the
polypes, in those parts where afterwards the real parasites
invariably appear.</p>

<p>We had hitherto seen very few birds; one day a beautiful white
one, with two very long tail-feathers, flew over and round the
ship, and many murderous proposals were made by the idlers to shoot
it; but my entreaties for its life, strengthened by the
superstitious warnings of the sailors, who seemed to regard it as a
good omen of something or other, preserved the poor thing, and I
had the happiness of seeing it fly away unharmed. It was the
boatswain, or frigate-bird. We only saw that one bird of the kind
during the passage, and certainly it was the most beautiful as well
as the rarest of our feathered visitants.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards two or three boobies paid us a flying call, very
possibly to see some relatives on board; of course the ties of
affinity preserved them from molestation. Lord Byron, in his
inimitable description of Juan's shipwreck, very aptly associates
the <i>noddy</i> with the boobies, but no noddy accompanied ours,
that I am aware of.</p>

<p>We fell in with numbers more of the feathered people, as we
increased our distance from the equator; most abundant were the
Cape pigeons, or "passenger's friend" <i>(Procellaria
capensis)</i>. Had the <i>sobriquet</i> been "passenger's
<i>victim</i>," it had been far more appropriate, for it appears
the universal custom&mdash;shame on those who make it so!&mdash;to massacre
these poor, harmless and really beautiful birds for the mere wanton
love of destruction. Every one possessed of a gun, powder, and shot
aids in the slaughter, or at least does his worst; and besides the
killed, I have watched many and many a poor wounded bird, disabled
from flying or procuring food, float helplessly away to perish in
pain and starvation, because some heartless blockhead had no other
resource to kill time than breaking its leg or wing. Often did I
think of the line in the good old nursery hymn,</p>

<p class="poem">"For Satan finds some mischief still<br>
For idle hands to do;"</p>

<p>and never was its truth more fully exemplified.</p>

<p>Hooks, baited with pork, were also used to <i>fish</i> for them;
but as very few were caught in this manner, it proved a far more
harmless amusement, and the exhibition of their natural voracity,
which it occasioned, somewhat dulled one's sympathy with them. The
moment a freshly-baited hook was flung astern, a crowd of pigeons
would assemble round it, flying, swimming, scuffling through the
water, as the tempting morsel skipped along the surface, scolding
and driving each other away with most expressive cries. Very
probably a great albatross is watching the result, as he hovers
with a still, solemn aspect above the bustling, squabbling crowd.
The pigeons succeed in pulling the pork from the hook, and the
tumult is redoubled when, in the heat of the battle, the booty is
dropped, and the wary albatross, with a sudden and sure plunge,
relieves them from all further contention by appropriating the
dainty morsel to his own use. Such a scene is acted twenty times a
day; sometimes the bird greedily swallows the bait and hook
together, and flies high into the air, whence the fisher gradually
winds him down; but this is no warning to the survivors, who are as
eager for the next throw of the treacherous bait as if none of
their number had suffered by its deception.</p>

<p>The Cape pigeon is a small kind of albatross, much larger in the
body than a pigeon, and with a great span of wing for its size. The
plumage is white, beautifully marked with black on the back and
wings, and their black eyes have a very peculiar, but soft and
pleasing expression. The various attitudes of a group of these
pretty birds, as they are seen closely following the ship&mdash;some
swimming, others sitting on the water, or running along it with
outspread wings, or just lighting down&mdash;are really very graceful
and beautiful, and were a constant source of amusement to me,
whenever their valorous enemies allowed them a truce.</p>

<p>A sportsman of the "Winkles" school is quite dangerous enough on
shore, but when to all the awkwardness of such characters is added
their utter helplessness at sea, and their invariable rule of
stumbling along, with a loaded gun on full cock aimed directly at
the nearest person's head, it may easily be conceived what perilous
chances occur. Of this class were several violent specimens on
board our vessel, all most determined, but most innocent foes of
the unfortunate pigeons, as it most frequently happened that they
hit a rope or a sail, instead of the bird, having no idea of
allowing for the motion of the vessel. The appearance of these
gentry on the quarter-deck, weapon in hand, soon became my signal
of retreat.</p>

<p>The Cape pigeons are very rarely met with beyond their peculiar
track, which extends from 35° to 55° south latitude, within which
boundaries they encircle the globe as with a living zone.</p>

<p>The great white albatross <i>(Diomedia exulans)</i> fully
realized all my ideas of its grandeur and solemnity. I never saw it
without thinking of Coleridge's wild and wondrous tale of the
"Ancient Mariner," nor can there possibly be any creature more
fitted to take part in such a dread and ghostly narrative than this
melancholy, grave, and most majestic bird. It soars along with
widely-expanded wings that often measure fifteen or eighteen feet
between the tips, with an even, solemn flight, rarely seeming to
stir, but as if merely floating along. Now and then a slow flapping
motion serves to raise him higher in the air, but the swift
movement and busy flutter of other birds seem beneath his dignity.
He sails almost close to you, like a silent spectre. Nothing of
life appears in his still, motionless form, but his keen piercing
eye, except that occasionally his head turns slightly, and betrays
a sharp, prying expression, that somewhat shakes your belief in the
lordly indifference he would fain assume; and if you fling
overboard a piece of rusty pork, the disenchantment is complete,
and you see that long curiously-crooked beak exercising its
enormous strength in an employment so spectral a personage could
scarcely be suspected of indulging. There is another kind of
albatross, nearly as large as the "great" one, with a small portion
of black on its wings, that appears exactly similar in habits to
its more renowned relative; but these pied ones are more
numerous.</p>

<p>Another kind, that the sailors called "Nelly" <i>(Diomedia
fuliginosa?)</i>, of a dusky, smoky hue, was very abundant and, I
am sorry to say, very frequently destroyed, although, by the great
thickness of the plumage or some other protecting cause, their
lives were often most strangely preserved. After falling plump into
the water, to all appearance shot <i>dead</i>, many would float
away a short distance, and then, turning ever to their proper
position, perting up the head, and giving their wings an
experimental flutter, as if to ascertain that no damage was done,
away they flew unharmed, greatly to my delight and the confusion of
their enemies. These surprising resuscitations gained for them,
with us, the name of "immortals."</p>

<p>All the various species of albatross have the same kind of
expressive eye I mentioned in describing the Cape pigeon; a gentle,
yet withal shrewd glance, and in some a few darker feathers round
the eye, add to the soft expression, just as long dark eyelashes do
in a human face.</p>

<p>What the flying-fish is, compared with the porpoise, such is the
light, swift little petrel beside the slow, solemn albatross.
Glancing, dipping, skimming about, or running along the water with
half-spread wings, they are all life and activity:</p>

<p class="poem">"Up and down, up and down,<br>
From the base of the waves to the billow's crown;"</p>

<p>they appear mere happy little birds; whilst those awful,
funereal creatures give one the idea of unhappy disembodied
spirits, condemned to sail about these inhospitable seas till their
penance is done.</p>

<p>There are two species of petrel in the vicinity of the Cape:
one, the common kind, is nearly black and, I believe, is the same
which frequents the northern British islands; the other, far more
beautiful, is a very delicate blue, and more slight in form than
the dark one. The two kinds keep in separate flocks, and I could
only obtain a good view of the blue ones with a glass, as they are
very shy, and never ventured near the ship&mdash;a very wise
precaution.</p>

<p>Nothing comes amiss to sailors in the way of eatables; nor, when
we consider the wretched fare on which they usually subsist in
merchant vessels, can their ready adoption of anything that
promises a variety create surprise. The rank, oily, disgustingly
high-scented sea-birds that were caught by the passengers, were all
begged and eaten by the crew. One day a very large gull or
albatross was handed over to them, and duly demolished; and on some
one's inquiring how it tasted, a steerage passenger very gravely
declared it to be "very like partridge!" When the bird came on
deck, quantities of pure oil poured from its beak,&mdash;and then to
hear of its eating "<i>like partridge</i>!"</p>

<p>Very soon after passing the Cape, wet, cold, stormy weather set
in, and banished me from my accustomed place on deck to my cabin,
where, with dead-lights securely stopping the stern-windows and the
skylight closely shut, I slept away as much of the weary day as I
could, and sat shivering in cloaks and furs the remainder, for
there was not a stove on board. That was a weary time; tremendous
gales blowing, seas being constantly shipped, and streaming into
the mess-cabin, though rarely into ours; the galley-fire
continually being put out; and, worst of all, the ship rolling and
pitching so violently that one would think each plunge must be her
last. Often in the night, when the roaring din around drove away
all chance of sleep, I have had a light struck to lie awake by, the
darkness seemed so terrible amid those horrid noises. The howling
and screaming of the wind, the roaring and dashing water sounding
close in one's ears, and every part of the vessel complaining, in
its own particular tone of creaking, cracking, or groaning, made up
such a frightful uproar, that it seemed sometimes as if a whole
legion of fiends were aboard.</p>

<p>Frequent terrific crashes among the crockery and glass ware
produced crashes of words, not "writ in choice Italian," but spoken
in a rough and wrathful tone, from captain and steward; the result
being a sad diminution of cups and wine-glasses. Such was our
dilapidated condition, that two or three old powder-canisters and
preserve-jars formed the entire drinking equipage of the cabin
table, when the last wine-glass, long the innocent cause of direst
jealousy, was lamentably broken. Being rich in the possession of
two small white respectable-looking marmalade jars, we took
especial care of our valuable "breakfast service," and, until one
of our treasures went to pieces in a squall, were the envy of our
less fortunate fellow-voyagers; but this general poverty in
conveniences was productive of so much merriment, that I doubt if
the finest services of china and cut-glass would have served half
as well to while away the slowly passing time. A little wit, as of
any other good thing, must go a great way at sea, where any change
of the too-often grumbling tone of conversation is acceptable.</p>

<p>It is very common for people to talk and write of waves running
"<i>mountains</i> high," but I confess I always used to make a very
liberal allowance for exaggeration and imagery in these cases; and
I well remember once joining in the laugh of incredulity, when a
gentleman told myself and other young people that he had seen waves
of which two would fill the breadth of the Menai Strait, where we
then were. I had not then been a long voyage myself; I had not
looked and trembled at the scene I witnessed one Sunday morning
after a two days' gale, during which I had remained below. The wind
had abated considerably, but we could only carry a close-reefed
mainsail, and were "scudding" along. Any attempt to describe the
vast, awful grandeur of the scene seems absurd&mdash;it is so impossible
for anything but the eye itself to represent it to the mind; I feel
dizzy with the mere remembrance.</p>

<p>When I came on deck, the ship lay as in an immense valley of
waters, with huge waves, <i>mountain</i> waves, indeed (one of
which would have flooded both shores of the Menai), circling us all
around: then slowly we seemed to climb the ascent, and, poised on
the summit of the rolling height, could look along the dark and
dreary waste of ocean heaving with giant billows far and wide;
then, plunging down into the next frightful abyss, the labouring
vessel seemed doomed;&mdash;I fancied already the rush of water in my
ears, when, with a violent pitch and shudder, the ship bounded
along again, over another mountain, and down another valley, in
long and slow succession again and again, till I grew accustomed to
the scene, and could gaze without thinking I looked upon our vast
and miserable grave.</p>

<p>There were the ghost-like albatrosses sailing solemnly above the
tops of the towering billows, or diving beside us into the yawning
gulf,&mdash;sailing about with the same unruffled plumes, the same
quiet, wary eye, and majestic demeanour, that they wore in the
brightest calm. Who could doubt their supernatural attributes?
Certainly not a spirit-chilled landswoman, with Coleridge's magic
legend perpetually repeating itself to her. I wish some of its good
and beautiful lines were as familiar and impressive in the minds
and thoughts of others as they are in mine:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%">"Farewell, farewell&mdash;but this I tell<br>
To thee, thou wedding guest!<br>
<i>He prayeth well, who loveth well</i><br>
Both man and bird and beast.<br>
<br>
He prayeth best, who loveth best<br>
All things, both great and small;<br>
For the dear God, who loveth us,<br>
He made and loveth all."</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">Island of St
Paul's&mdash;Islands in Bass's Straits&mdash;Mutton-birds&mdash;Botany Bay

Life&mdash;George Street, Sydney&mdash;The Domain&mdash;Eucalyptus,
&amp;c.&mdash;Wooloomooloo&mdash;Government Gardens.</p>

<p>A VIEW of the little volcanic island of St. Paul's was the only
thing that served to vary the tedium of our stormy passage across
the Indian Ocean; and our view being rather a distant one, the only
benefit we derived from it was the introduction of a new topic of
conversation.&mdash;I believe excellent fish are very abundant there:
and, as the story goes, you may stand and pull your dinner out of
the cold salt-water with one hand, and drop it into a hot fresh
spring to cook with the other! I know not if the renowned Baron
Munchausen ever visited St. Paul's, but this savours something of
his quality. A few wild pigs are there now likewise; but the island
is a mere volcanic rock, or rather the crater of an extinct
volcano, with no trees or bushes, and but very scanty vegetation of
any kind. The hot springs show that volcanic agency is still busy
there.</p>

<p>Violent gales, cold and rainy weather, were long our portion,
but a favourable change occurred in time to decide our route to be
through Bass's Straits, which would not have been prudent in the
more boisterous weather; and the longer passage round Van Diemen's
Land seemed an intolerable prolongation of our most irksome
captivity.</p>

<p>Never shall I forget the feeling of intense pleasure with which
I greeted the sight of land again, as we passed among the numerous
islands in the Straits. Bare, barren as they were, I thought them
lovely as the Elysian fields, for they were <i>land</i>, solid,
firm, dry land. How we leaned over the vessel's side,
<i>smelling</i> the shore!&mdash;enjoying the fine earthy, fragrant
smell that our sea-seasoned noses were so quick to detect in every
puff of wind that came over the islands. We passed several very
singular rocks* early in the morning of this most happy day, and
went sailing on, with a fair breeze, a bright sunny blue sky, and
an ever-changing, ever-new prospect around. We passed so near the
islands of "Kent's Group," and another called the "Judgment," as to
discern flocks of seal sleeping on the rocks; thousands of
sea-birds, named by sailors "mutton-birds," were flying or floating
around us, and often diving for a considerable distance; and, most
beautiful of all in this bright picture, numerous vessels were in
sight, all bound for the same port as ourselves; and after each
traversing a different path, were here, as it were, idling into the
common high road for the Australian metropolis.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Called, I <i>think</i>, the Judge and
Clerks.]</p>

<p>Those "mutton-birds" I have just mentioned form a most curious
and interesting community. I know not if their habits have been
observed by naturalists, being myself totally out of the reach of
books of reference on all similar subjects; but the particulars I
have heard from my husband, whose early wanderings familiarised him
with many of the native creatures of the Australian islands, struck
me as being very curious. The birds are about the size of a
wild-duck, with handsome black plumage, shot with metallic shades
of green or brown, accordingly as the light fells on it; they are
web-footed, and the beak is similar in form to that of the
albatross family. They live wholly at sea the chief part of the
year, but on one particular day in spring&mdash;November 1st, never
varying many hours in the time&mdash;they come in from sea in countless
myriads, filling the air with clouds of their dark wings as they
hurry ashore on some of the islands in Bass's Straits, where their
"rookeries," as the sealers term them, are made. These are burrows
in the earth, covering many of the islands; and the first care of
the birds on returning is to scratch them out clean from any
rubbish that has accumulated, and put them in order for habitation,
and often to make new ones. This preparatory business occupies
about a fortnight, and then the swarming squadrons put to sea again
for another fortnight or three weeks, not a bird remaining behind.
At the end of this time they return in a body as before, and with
much noise and bustle take up their abode in the rookeries, and
there lay their eggs and sit. The parent birds share between them
the "domestic duties," taking it in turns to remain on the nest or
go out to seek their food, which chiefly consists of a green slimy
matter like sea-weed. They remain on shore until the young ones are
a third part grown, and immensely fat, like masses of blubber, when
the old birds leave them and go off to sea. The young ones, unable
to leave the rookeries, are sustained meanwhile by their own fat;
and by the time that is tolerably reduced, their wings are grown
strong enough for flight, and they also quit the rookery and go to
sea.</p>

<p>The men employed in sealing on these islands derive their chief
sustenance from the mutton-birds, which they take in various ways.
One very successful method of snaring them is thus practised:&mdash;A
high pen of stakes wattled together is made on a low part of the
coast, into which the poor mutton-birds, who always run down to the
water to take wing, are driven with dogs and shouting, and there,
as they cannot rise off the land, they can be killed at leisure. An
extensive trade in their feathers is also carried on, but these
have generally a strong and unpleasant smell; so that a
"mutton-bird pillow" is spoken of as something proverbially
disagreeable. Great quantities of the birds are cured by the
sealers for sale, and I am told that their flavour is similar to
that of a red-herring.</p>

<p>Very early on the morning of September 27th, Mr. Meredith was
requested to go on deck and identify the land we were then passing,
cloudy weather for two days having prevented any observation being
taken, and our exact whereabouts being therefore doubtful. The
unknown cliffs were immediately pronounced to be the headlands of
Botany Bay!&mdash;Our weary wayfaring was nearly done, the next break in
the iron-bound coast that rose dark and threateningly before us
would be our welcome haven, Sydney Cove!</p>

<p>In an absolute whirl of delight and excitement, with bright
looks and quick eager voices all around, I hastened to put up a few
packages ready to take ashore, continually interrupting myself to
go on deck and mark our progress. The agitation on board was
universal, and the transformations little short of miraculous;
passenger-chrysalids were turning into butterflies every instant.
Gentlemen, whose whole outer vestments for the past month would
have scarcely brought half-a-crown in Rag-Fair, suddenly emerged
from their cabins, exquisites of the first water; and ladies, whose
bronzed and scorched straw-bonnets would have been discarded long
before by a match-girl, now appeared in delicate silks or satins of
the latest London fashion. Gala dresses and holiday faces were the
order of the day; perhaps a child going home from school may feel
as happy as I did, but the degree of delight could scarcely be
excelled.</p>

<p>The entrance to Port Jackson is grand in the extreme. The high,
dark cliffs we had been coasting along all morning, suddenly
terminate in an abrupt precipice, called the South Head, on which
stand the lighthouse and signal-station. The North Head is a
similar cliff, a bare bluff promontory of dark horizontal rocks;
and between these grand stupendous pillars, as through a colossal
gate, we entered Port Jackson.</p>

<p>The countless bays and inlets of this noble estuary render it
extremely beautiful; every minute, as we sailed on, a fresh vista
opened on the view, each, as it seemed, more lovely than the last;
the pretty shrubs, growing thickly amid the rocks, and down to the
water's edge, added infinitely to the effect, especially as they
were really green, a thing I had not dared to expect; but it was
spring, and everything looked fresh and verdant.</p>

<p>Here and there, on some fine lawny promontory or rocky mount,
white villas and handsome cottages appeared, encircled with gardens
and shrubberies, looking like the pretty "cottages ornées" near
some fashionable English watering-place; and perched amid as
picturesque, but less cultivated scenery, were the cottages of
pilots, fishermen, &amp;c., making, to my ocean-wearied eyes, an
Arcadia of beauty. Near the North Head is the quarantine-ground,
off which one unlucky vessel was moored when we passed; and on the
brow of the cliff a few tombstones indicate the burial-place of
those unhappy exiles who die during the time of ordeal, and whose
golden dreams of the far-sought land of promise lead but to a lone
and desolate grave on its storm-beaten shore.</p>

<p>We very narrowly escaped a serious accident even in the port. A
large vessel was moored in mid-channel, and our pilot could not
decide on which side he would pass her, until we were so near that
a collision seemed inevitable, but we fortunately cleared her, with
not two feet to spare, and pursued our course.</p>

<p>During a light shower which fell shortly after, amid the bright
sunshine, a most beautiful rainbow appeared, seeming like a smile
of welcome to my new country. It spanned over one of the many
lovely little bays, and was very broad, so that, although the
centre had a considerable elevation, it wholly rested on the water,
which, with the rocks, trees, and hills beyond, and the snow-white
sands of the bay, shone in all the graduated shades of the bright
prismatic colours. It was beautiful beyond description.</p>

<p>The pure white silvery sand which forms the beach in several of
these picturesque coves, gives them a peculiarly bright appearance;
it is much valued, I believe, by glass-makers at home, and often
taken as ship's ballast, for that purpose.</p>

<p>As we neared Sydney, several rocky islets appeared, some rising
like ruined forts and castles, and richly adorned with verdant
shrubs down to the edge of the bright, clear, deep blue water, that
reflected them so perfectly, one could scarcely tell where
substance and shadow joined. One of them is named Shark Island;
another larger one, Garden Island; and a little one, bearing the
unmeaning and not very refined name of "Pinchgut," is now the site
of a small fort or battery.</p>

<p>The remarkable clearness of the atmosphere particularly struck
me, in looking at distant houses or other objects, everything,
however remote, seeming to have such a clean, distinct outline, so
different to the diffused effect of an English landscape; not that
I should like it in a <i>picture</i> so well as our softer and more
rounded perspective, but in a new place, where one likes to see
everything plainly, it is very pleasant. The bright white villas
seemed almost to cut into their surrounding trees, so sharp the
corners appeared; and the universal adjunct of a veranda or piazza
in front, served to remind us that we were in a more sunny clime
than dear, dull Old England, where such permanent sun-shades would
be as intolerable as they are here necessary.</p>

<p>The harbour-master's boat was soon alongside, and he, with the
physician, came on board, to perform their respective duties of
inquiry and examination, and to hear the last news from
<i>home</i>. No vessel had arrived from thence for a month, an
unusually long interval, and intelligence was anxiously expected;
but during the day of our arrival and the following one, above a
dozen English vessels poured in.</p>

<p>The pilot had informed us that wheat was at an enormous price in
Sydney then, but his statement was not credited; it was, however,
only too correct, <i>twenty-seven shillings per bushel</i> being
the average price, in consequence of the severe droughts, which had
for two successive seasons destroyed the crops.</p>

<p>The crew of the harbour-master's boat were New Zealanders, fine
intelligent-looking, copper-coloured fellows, clad in an odd
composite style, their national dress and some British articles of
apparel being blended somewhat grotesquely. The New Zealanders are
much the noblest specimens of "savages" that I have ever met with.
During our residence in Sydney I saw a chief walking along one of
the principal streets, with his wife following him. I had often
heard of and seen what is called majestic demeanour, but this
untutored being, with his tattooed face and arms, and long shaggy
mantle, fairly outdid even my imaginings of the majestic, as he
paced deliberately along, planting his foot at every step as if he
had an emperor's neck beneath it, and gazing with most royal
indifference around him. There was the concentrated grandeur of a
hundred regal mantles of velvet, gold, and ermine in the very sway
of his flax-fringed cloak; I never beheld anything so truly
stately. I cannot say so much for his lady, a black-haired,
brown-faced body, in a gaudy cotton-print gown, and (so far as I
could judge) nothing else. She trotted after her lordly
better-half, staring with unsophisticated curiosity at everything,
apparently quite a novice in the busy scene; but I verily believe,
had you placed the man amidst the coronation splendours of
Westminster Abbey, that he would not have been so "vulgar" as to
betray surprise. Nor is their courtesy of manner in any degree
inferior to their magnificent demeanour. I have heard my husband
say, that when at New Zealand, he was treated by the chiefs with
such kind, anxious hospitality, and true gentlemanly bearing, as
might put to shame many an educated but less civilized
European.</p>

<p>About noon we cast anchor opposite Fort Macquarie, a neat stone
building, with a few cannon planted around it. Close alongside of
us lay a Scotch emigrant ship, her deck thronged with crowds of
both sexes and all ages, enlivened by the fearful din of some
half-dozen bagpipers, who were all puffing, squeezing, and elbowing
away with incomparable energy and perseverance, though, as they all
seemed to be playing different airs, the melody produced was rather
of a complex character.</p>

<p>Behind, or rather to the right of Fort Macquarie, was Government
House, a long low building with a spacious veranda, in which
sentinels were pacing to and fro; before it lay a fine green lawn,
sloping towards, though not to, the water's edge, (quays
intervening,) and around it grew noble trees, both European and
Colonial, the English oak in its early spring garb of yellow green
being here and there overtopped by the grand and more sombre
Norfolk Island pine. A few other good houses were in view, but the
chief of the town, or, as it must now be called, city, is built on
the sides and at the head of a cove running at right angles with
the stream in which we lay, which prevented the best parts from
being observed, and the main portion of what was visible had an air
of "Wapping" about it, by no means engaging.</p>

<p>The opposite or north shore of Port Jackson, here about two
miles across, is of rather a monotonous character. Hills of no
great elevation and very tame outline rise from the beach, dotted
here and there with villas and cottages, their adjoining gardens
making a pleasant green contrast with the uniform brown hue of the
scrub. Numberless boats were pulling and sailing about, giving
animation to the scene, and several of the vessels we had passed in
Bass's Straits were working up the port; the life and bustle all
around making a delightful change after our long solitary voyage;
and when the boat came to take us ashore, my joy was complete. Once
more seated in the slung chair, wrapped in the British flag, I
gladly bade adieu to the good ship that had so long seemed to me a
weary "prison-house," and soon, with a delight that must be felt to
be understood, stepped again on <i>land</i>.</p>

<p>And how happy a time it is&mdash;the first few days on shore after
such a voyage! Every action of life is an enjoyment. I could walk,
without the floor jumping about and pitching me over; could use
<i>both</i> hands to brush my hair, instead of keeping one to hold
on by; could absolutely set my wine-glass on the table without fear
of its upsetting into my plate, though, by the bye, I often caught
myself carefully propping it up against something, or looking above
for the swing-tray to put it out of danger. Then the abundant
supply of water for ablutionary purposes is a priceless luxury when
first enjoyed after the limited allowance on board ship; and I
often made the chambermaid smile by asking if she could
<i>spare</i> me another ewer-full. It is <i>fresh, clean</i> water
too, not flavoured either by a vinegar or rum cask, and can be used
without being "left to settle!" Perhaps few ship-stewards are
<i>very</i> clean, but all are not <i>extremely</i> dirty, and
therefore our exquisite enjoyment of clean cups, glasses, plates,
and forks, may not be imagined by the generality of voyagers.
Vegetables too, after a long diet of pork and rice, were most
acceptable. Fruit was not in season, except loquats, a pleasant
acid berry, the size and shape of a gooseberry, with large
kernel-like pippins. The tree is a very handsome one, bearing large
long leaves, and drooping clusters of white, deliciously fragrant
blossoms, which are succeeded by the golden-coloured fruit.</p>

<p>When we remember that Sydney has risen within little more than
fifty years from the first settlement of the colony, its size,
appearance, and population are truly wonderful. It is a large busy
town, reminding me of portions of Liverpool or Bristol, with many
good buildings, though few have any pretension to architectural
beauty. The newer portions of the town are laid out with regularity
and advantage. One long street traverses its whole length, about a
mile and a half, full of good shops exhibiting every variety of
merchandise; and in the afternoon, when the ladies of the place
drive out, whole strings of carriages may be seen rolling about or
waiting near the more "fashionable emporiums," that being the term
in which Australian shopkeepers especially delight. The vehicles
are sometimes motley enough in their equipment. Here and there
appears a real London-built chariot, brilliant in paint and
varnish, and complete in every luxury; with a coachman, attired
something like worthy Sam Weller, "as a compo of footman, gardener,
and groom," sitting on a box innocent of hammercloth, and driving a
pair of mean-looking, under-sized horses terribly out of proportion
with the handsome, aristocratic-looking carriage behind them.
Sometimes, but very rarely, you see a consistent, well-appointed
equipage; I think the tandem is more frequently turned out in good
style than any other kind: and as no "lady" in Sydney (your
grocers' and butchers' wives included) believes in the possibility
of walking, the various machines upon wheels, of all descriptions,
are very numerous; from the close carriage and showy barouche or
britzka, to the more humble four-wheeled chaise and useful gig. Few
ladies venture to risk their complexions to the exposure of an
equestrian costume, and accordingly few appear on horseback.</p>

<p>George Street seems to be by common consent considered as the
Pall-Mall, or rather as the "Park" of Sydney, and up and down its
hot, dusty, glaring, weary length go the fair wives and daughters
of the "citizens," enjoying their daily airing; whilst close to the
town is the beautiful Domain, a most picturesque rocky promontory,
thickly wooded and laid out in fine smooth drives and walks, all
commanding most exquisite views of Sydney and its environs, the
opposite shore, and the untiring ever-beautiful estuary of Port
Jackson. It was our favourite spot; even after driving elsewhere
out of town (for alas! the splendour of George Street had no charms
for me) we generally made one circuit round the Domain and, as
generally, found ourselves the only visitors. It was unfashionable,
in fact, not the proper thing at all, either to walk or drive in
the Domain. It was a notorious fact, that maid-servants and their
sweethearts resorted thither on Sundays, and of course that
shocking circumstance ruined its character as a place for their
mistresses to visit; the public streets being so much more
select.</p>

<p>Lady Macquarie had this Domain laid out after her own plans;
walks and drives were cut through the rocks and shrubs, but no
other trees destroyed; seats placed at intervals, and lodges built
at the entrances. On the high point of the promontory some large
horizontal rocks have been slightly assisted by art into the form
of a great seat or throne, called Lady Macquarie's Chair, above
which an inscription informs the visitor to whose excellent taste
and benevolent feeling he is indebted for the improvement of this
lovely spot. It always reminded me of Piercefield in Monmouthshire,
but is far more beautiful, inasmuch as, instead of the black-banked
Wye, here the bright blue waves of the bay wash the lower crags,
and in place of looking only at one opposite bank, here is a noble
estuary with countless bays and inlets, pretty villas and cottages,
and dainty little islands, all bright and clear and sunny, with a
cloudless sky above them.</p>

<p>The trees are chiefly different species of Eucalyptus, or
"gum-tree," some of which bear large and handsome flowers, having a
remarkably sweet and luscious scent, like honey, with which they
abound. The name Eucalyptus is admirably descriptive of the flower,
meaning covered well with a lid; and each closed blossom is shaped
like a goblet, with a pyramidal cover, which in due time fills, or
is thrust off, by the crowd of squeezed-up stamens within, that
quickly expand into a starry circle when released from their
verdant prison. The leaves are mostly of a dull green, with a dry
sapless look about them, more like old specimens in a herbarium
than fresh living and growing things, and, being but thinly
scattered on the branches, have a meagre appearance. They are,
however, "evergreens," and in their peculiarity of habit strongly
remind the observer that he is at the antipodes of England, or very
near it, where everything seems topsy-turvy, for instead of the
"fall of the leaf," here we have the stripping of the bark, which
peels off at certain seasons in long pendent ragged ribands,
leaving the disrobed tree almost as white and smooth as the paper I
am now writing on. At first I did not like this at all, but now the
clean stems of a young handsome gum-tree seem a pleasing variety
amidst the sombre hues of an Australian forest.</p>

<p>Several species of tea-tree <i>(Leptospermum)</i> form the chief
portion of the shrubbery here, producing their small pretty
blossoms very abundantly, whilst various other shrubs and many
species of <i>acacia</i> (generally called Mimosa or Wattle here)
display innumerable novelties of leaf and flower to the admiring
eyes of an English visitor. One beautiful shrub grows on some of
the low rocks, which I have not observed elsewhere: the leaves are
large, and not unlike those of a Camellia; the flower, in form,
size, and colour, resembles a fine single yellow rose.</p>

<p>Opposite the south shore of the Domain, and forming the other
boundary of a beautiful cove, is another similar point or
promontory, called still by the native name of Wooloomooloo (the
accent being on the first and last syllables), on which a number of
elegant villas have been erected by the more wealthy residents in
Sydney, being to that place what the Regent's Park is to London.
The views from many of these are beautiful in the extreme, looking
down into two bays, one on either side, and beyond these to the
town and port, with the magnificent heads of the harbour closing
the seaward prospect. Vines flourish here luxuriantly, and many
tropical plants and trees mingle with those of European growth.
Hedges are often formed of geraniums, and sometimes of the
fruit-bearing cactus, called the prickly pear (<i>C. opuntia</i>,
or C. <i>nana?</i>), a detestable thing, which if touched, even
with strong leathern gloves, so penetrates them with its fine long
spines, that the hands of the unlucky meddler are most annoyingly
hurt by them. Some of our rarest greenhouse passion-flowers grow
here unsheltered, and flower profusely; and the Brugmansia often
forms the centre of a grass plot, with its graceful tent-like white
bells hanging on it in hundreds. Geraniums thrive and grow very
rapidly, but I did not see any good ones; none that I should have
thought worth cultivating in England. A Horticultural Society has
now been established some years, and will doubtless be the means of
much improvement.</p>

<p>The Government Gardens are tastefully laid out round the sloping
head of a small bay between the Domain and Government House, and
contain (besides abundant vineries, and all other productive
matters) a strange and beautiful assemblage of dwellers in all
lands, from the tall bamboo of India to the lowly English violet. A
group of graceful weeping-willows overhang a pretty shady pool,
where a statue, by an English sculptor (Westmacott, I think), is
now erected to General Bourke, formerly governor of New South
Wales. It had not arrived when we left Sydney, or I should have
much rejoiced to see the first specimen of high art which the
colony has obtained, placed in so lovely and, with us, so favourite
a spot. The grand Norfolk Island pine, the fig, orange, mulberry,
and countless trees, shrubs, and flowers new to me, add to the gay
beauty of these gardens; and when tired of roaming about the sunny
and fragrant walks, there are grassy lawns and shaded seats&mdash;and
such a lovely prospect around that, much as I should dislike to
dwell in Sydney, I left its beautiful gardens with great regret.
Yet, will it be believed, that even these are very little
frequented by the inhabitants? They are evidently, from some cause
unknown to me (but doubtless nearly allied to the cause of the
Domain's desertion), not considered correctly fashionable by the
fancied "exclusives" of the place, though constantly frequented by
all new-comers; at all events, the former prefer the hot, glaring,
dusty pavement of a town street for their promenade, to these
delicious gardens.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Since writing the above, I have seen some
remarks in a Sydney newspaper which imply a more general resort to
the "Domain" than was the case at the time of which I speak. I
rejoice to find that the beauties of so delightful a spot are
becoming more properly estimated.]</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">Sydney Market&mdash;Fish,

Lighthouse&mdash;Flowers&mdash;Parrots&mdash;Black Cockatoos&mdash;Hyde
Park&mdash;Churches&mdash;Libraries&mdash;"Currency" Population&mdash;Houses&mdash;Balls,
&amp;c.&mdash;Inns&mdash;Colonial Newspapers.</p>

<p>The market in Sydney is well supplied, and is held in a large
commodious building, superior to most provincial market-houses at
home. The display of fruit in the grape season is very beautiful.
Peaches also are most abundant, and very cheap; apples very dear,
being chiefly imported from Van Diemen's Land, and frequently
selling at sixpence each. The smaller English fruits, such as
strawberries, &amp;c., only succeed in a few situations in the
colony, and are far from plentiful. Cucumbers and all descriptions
of melon abound. The large green water-melon, rose-coloured within,
is a very favourite fruit, but I thought it insipid. One approved
method of eating it is, after cutting a sufficiently large hole, to
pour in a bottle of Madeira or sherry, and mix it with the cold
watery pulp. These melons grow to an enormous size (an ordinary one
is from twelve to eighteen inches in diameter), and may be seen
piled up like huge cannon-balls at all the fruit-shop doors, being
universally admired in this hot, thirsty climate.</p>

<p>There are some excellent fish to be procured here, but I know
them only by the common Colonial names, which are frequently
misnomers. The snapper, or schnapper, is the largest with which I
am acquainted, and is very nice, though not esteemed a proper dish
for a dinner-party&mdash;why, I am at a loss to guess; but I never saw
any native fish at a Sydney dinner-table&mdash;the preserved or cured
cod and salmon from England being served instead, at a considerable
expense, and, to my taste, it is not comparable with the cheap
fresh fish, but being expensive, it has become "fashionable," and
that circumstance reconciles all things. The guard-fish is long and
narrow, about the size of a herring, with a very singular head, the
mouth opening at the top, as it were, and the lower jaw, or nose,
projecting two-thirds of an inch beyond it. I imagine it must live
chiefly at the bottom, and this formation enables it more readily
to seize the food above it. They are most delicate little fish. The
bream, a handsome fish, not unlike a perch in shape (but much
larger, often weighing four or five pounds), and the mullet, but
especially the latter, are excellent. The whiting, much larger than
its English namesake, is perhaps the best of all; but I pretend to
no great judgment as a gastronome. I thought the rock-oysters
particularly nice, and they are plentiful and cheap; so are the
crayfish, which are very similar to lobsters, when small, but the
large ones rather coarse. I must not end my list of fish that we
eat without mentioning one that is always ready to return the
compliment when an opportunity offers, namely, the shark, many of
whom are habitants of the bright tempting waters of Port Jackson.
Provisions vary much in price from many circumstances. Everything
was very dear when we landed in New South Wales, and at the present
time prices are much too low to pay the producers.</p>

<p>The dust is one main source of annoyance in Sydney. Unless after
very heavy rain, it is always <i>dusty</i>; and sometimes, when the
wind is in one particular point, the whirlwinds of thick fine
powder that fill every street and house are positive miseries.
These dust-winds are locally named "brick-fielders," from the
direction in which they come; and no sooner is the approach of one
perceived than the streets are instantly deserted, windows and
doors closely shut, and every one who can remains within till the
plague has passed over, when you ring for the servant with a
duster, and collect enough fine earth for a small garden off your
chairs and tables.</p>

<p>Flies are another nuisance; they swarm in every room in tens of
thousands, and blacken the breakfast or dinner table as soon as the
viands appear, tumbling into the cream, tea, wine, and gravy with
the most disgusting familiarity. But worse than these are the
mosquitoes, nearly as numerous, and infinitely more detestable to
those for whose luckless bodies they form an attachment, as they do
to most new comers; a kind of initiatory compliment which I would
gladly dispense with, for most intolerable is the torment they
cause in the violent irritation of their mountainous bites. All
houses are furnished with a due attention to these indefatigable
gentry, and the beds have consequently a curious aspect to an
English eye accustomed to solid four-posters, with voluminous
hangings of chintz or damask, and a pile of feather-beds which
would annihilate a sleeper in this climate. Here you have usually a
neat thin skeleton-looking frame of brass or iron, over which is
thrown a gauze garment, consisting of curtains, head, and tester,
all sewn together; the former full, and resting on the floor when
let down, but during the day tied up in festoons. Some of these
materials are very pretty, being silk, with satin stripes of white
or other delicate tints on the green gauze ground. At night, after
the curtains are lowered, a grand hunt takes place, to kill or
drive out the mosquitoes from within; having effected which
somewhat wearisome task, you tuck the net in all round, leaving one
small bit which you carefully raise, and nimbly pop through the
aperture into bed, closing the curtain after you. This certainly
postpones the ingress of the enemy, but no precaution that my
often-tasked ingenuity could invent will prevent it effectually.
They are terrible pests, and very frequently aided in their
nocturnal invasions of one's rest by the still worse and
thrice-disgusting creatures familiar to most dwellers in London
lodgings or seaport inns, to say nothing of fleas, which seem to
pervade this colony in one universal swarm. The thickest part of a
town, or the most secluded spot in the wild bush, is alike replete
with these small but active annoyances.</p>

<p>One day we drove out to the lighthouse on the South Head, about
eight miles from Sydney. Soon after leaving the town the road
passes the new court-house and gaol, and its handsome front, in the
Doric or Ionic style (I forget which), is the only architectural
building the "city" could boast when I was there, though I suppose
that ere this the new Government House, a mansion in the
Elizabethan-Gothic style, is completed. We began shortly to ascend
a hill, the road being all sea-sand apparently, and nothing but
sand was visible all around. Great green mat-like plats of the
pretty <i>Mesembryanthemum aequilaterale</i>, or fig-marigold,
adorned the hot sandy banks by the road-side. It bears a bright
purple flower, and a five-sided fruit, called by children
"pig-faces." A very prickly species of solanum also grew here, with
large green spiky leaves, more difficult to gather even than holly,
and pretty bluish potato-like blossoms. The universal tea-tree, and
numberless shrubs which I knew not, adorned the sandy wastes in all
directions. As we continued to ascend, the road became very rough,
huge masses of rock protruding like gigantic steps, over which the
wheels scraped and grated and jumped in a way that made me draw
rather strong comparisons between the character of roads at home
and abroad. As we approached the summit, the hollow formed by the
road was suddenly filled by a background (forgive the paradox) of
deep blue water; it was the open sea that gradually rose before us,
seen over the rocks, and spreading out bright and blue, with small
waves sparkling in the fervid sunshine, and the white
diamond-crested spray dashing high against the iron-bound coast,
here broken into a low craggy amphitheatre, into which the rolling
waves came surging on, breaking over the groups of rocks, and
forming bright little basins among them. On either side the rocks
rose again in large masses, presenting a precipitous face to the
sea, being part of the dark formidable cliffs we had seen in
approaching the Heads by sea.</p>

<p>The road, after descending the hill, turned to the left, through
some sandy scrub, crowded with such exquisite flowers that to me it
appeared one continued garden, and I walked for some distance,
gathering handfuls of them&mdash;of the same plants that I had cherished
in pots at home, or begged small sprays of in conservatories or
greenhouses! I had whole boughs of the splendid metrosideros, a
tall handsome shrub, bearing flowers of the richest crimson, like a
large bottle-brush; several varieties of the delicate epacris;
different species of acacia, tea-tree, and corraea, the brilliant
"Botany-Bay lily," and very many yet more lovely denizens of this
interesting country, of which I know not even the name. One, most
beautiful, was something like a small iris, of a pure ultra-marine
blue, with smaller petals in the centre, most delicately pencilled;
but ere I had gathered it five minutes, it had withered away, and I
never could bring one home to make a drawing from. Surely it must
have been some sensitive little fay, who, charmed into the form of
a flower, might not bear the touch of a mortal hand!</p>

<p>Numbers of parrots, those</p>

<p class="poem">"Strange bright birds, that on starry wings<br>
Bear the rich hues of all glorious things,"</p>

<p>were flying from tree to tree, or crossing the road in
chattering, screaming parties, all as gay and happy as splendid
colours and glad freedom could make them. Often they rose close
before us from the road, like living gems and gold, so vividly
bright they shone in the sun; and then a party of them would
assemble in a tree, with such fluttering, and flying in and out,
and under and over; such genteel-looking flirtations going on, as
they sidled up and down the branches, with their droll sly-looking
faces peering about, and inspecting us first with one eye, then
with the other, that they seemed quite the monkeys of the feathered
tribes.</p>

<p>On nearing the lighthouse, after ascending one or two slight
hills, we passed several small houses, and others were building;
the views from thence are doubtlessly very grand, but it must be a
most exposed situation, with nothing to break the force of the
strong sea-breezes, and but little vegetation to moderate the glare
of the sun.</p>

<p>The view from the cliffs is indeed grand,</p>

<p class="poem">"O'er the glad waters of the dark-blue sea;"</p>

<p>and looking down over the dizzy height, the eye glances from
crag to crag, till it catches the snowy puffs of foam flung up from
the breakers that roar and dash in the cavernous chasms below,
booming among them like subterranean thunder. As I fearfully gazed
down, something leaped between me and the dark water&mdash;it was a
goat, and there were some half-dozen of the agile creatures far
down the slippery precipitous crags, leaping, jumping, and
frolicking about, with scarcely an inch of foot-room, and only the
boiling surf below.</p>

<p>Opposite to us rose the corresponding cliff, called the North
Head, bluff and bare, and wearing on its hoary front the hues with
which thousands of storms have dyed it. Myriads of sea-fowl were
soaring and screaming around, and several vessels in the offing,
and nearer shore, were apparently shaping their course to the port,
but too distant for us to wait their entrance through these most
grand and stupendous gates. The lighthouse itself is not in any way
remarkable; close by is the signal-staff, by means of which the
intelligence of vessels arriving is speedily transmitted to Sydney
and Parramatta.</p>

<p>We drove back by a different road, nearer to the port, and less
hilly, but equally beautiful with that by which we came. It led us
through a moister-looking region, with more large trees, greener
shrubs, and more luxuriant herbage, and commanding most lovely
views, that appeared in succession like pictures seen through a
natural framework of high white-stemmed gum-trees and tall acacias.
Here and there peeped forth a prettily situated residence, with its
shady garden and cool piazza, looking down into one of the small
bays I have before mentioned, and beyond that to the estuary.</p>

<p>On one large dead gum-tree a whole council of black cockatoos
was assembled in animated debate, sidling up and down the branches,
erecting and lowering their handsome gold-tipped top-knots, as if
bowing to each other with the politest gestures imaginable; and
accompanying the dumb show with such varied intonations of voice as
made it impossible to doubt that a most interesting discussion was
going on, all conducted in the most courteous manner: perhaps a
reform of the grub laws was in agitation, for the business was
evidently one of grave importance, and we respectfully remained
attentive spectators of the ceremony until "the House" adjourned,
and the honourable members flew away. These birds are by no means
common in the neighbourhood of Sydney, nor did I see any more
during my stay in the colony.</p>

<p>The same deep sandy road continued: it appeared to me that this
part of the country must have been gradually elevated from the sea,
and a long succession of beaches consequently formed, and left
inland by the retreating waters; for the prodigious accumulation of
true sea-sand here seems difficult to account for in any other way.
In the Domain, too, and many other situations, are raised beaches,
consisting wholly of sea-sand and shells (recent ones, so far as I
examined them), above which, in a thin stratum of soil, great trees
are growing; so that, although these beaches have formed part of
the dry land long enough for a body of soil to be deposited upon
them, and for aged trees to have grown in that, they are still of
modern elevation.</p>

<p>Sydney boasts her "Hyde Park;" but a park utterly destitute of
trees seems rather an anomaly. It is merely a large piece of brown
ground fenced in, where is a well of good water, from which most of
the houses are supplied by means of water-carts. There is also a
racecourse between the town and Botany Bay, racing being a
favourite amusement among the gentlemen of the colony, and
sometimes among the ladies, for I was told of a race somewhere "up
the country," in which two "young ladles" were the riders, the
prize being a new side-saddle and bridle, which was won in good
style by one of the fair damsels; the horse of the other receiving
a severe castigation from his gentle mistress, for having swerved
and lost the race.</p>

<p>Most of the country gentlemen near Sydney, and for many miles
round, are members of the "Cumberland Hunt;" they have a tolerable
pack of hounds, and the destructive native dog, or dingo, serves
them for a fox. So long as they hunt the really wild ones, the
sport is certainly useful; but when, as frequently happens, a
<i>bagged dog</i> furnishes the day's amusement, I cannot but think
the field of mounted red-coats as something less than children.
Dinners and balls of course form a part of the arrangements for the
races and hunts, and everything is conducted in as English a manner
as can be attained by a young country imitating an old one.</p>

<p>There are several large churches in Sydney, plainly, but
substantially built; and one was in progress when we were there,
which promised a more architectural appearance. The Bishop of
Australia is a resident in Sydney. The Roman Catholics, and various
dissenting congregations, have also neat and commodious
chapels.</p>

<p>I heard that there was a Museum of Natural History; and the
"Australian Library" contains an excellent selection of books for
so young an institution. The circulating libraries are very poor
affairs but, I fear, quite sufficient for the demand, reading not
being a favourite pursuit. The gentlemen are too busy, or find a
cigar more agreeable than a book; and the ladies, to quote the
remark of a witty friend, "pay more attention to the adornment of
their heads <i>without</i> than <i>within</i>." That there are many
most happy exceptions to this rule, I gladly acknowledge; but in
the majority of instances, a comparison between the intellect and
conversation of Englishwomen, and those of an equal grade here,
would be highly unfavourable to the latter. An apathetic
indifference seems the besetting fault; an utter absence of
interest or inquiry beyond the merest gossip,&mdash;the cut of a new
sleeve, or the guests at a late party. "Do you play?" and "Do you
draw?" are invariable queries to a new lady-arrival. "Do you
<i>dance</i>?" is thought superfluous, for everybody dances; but
not a question is heard relative to English literature or art; far
less a remark on any political event, of however important a
nature:&mdash;not a syllable that betrays <i>thought</i>, unless some
very inquiring belle ask, "if you have seen the Queen, and whether
she is <i>pretty</i>?" But all are dressed in the latest known
fashion, and in the best materials, though not always with that
tasteful attention to the accordance or contrast of colour which an
elegant Englishwoman would observe.</p>

<p>The natives (not the aborigines, but the "currency," as they are
termed, in distinction from the "sterling," or British-born
residents) are often very good-looking when young; but precocity of
growth and premature decay are unfortunately characteristic of the
greater portion. The children are mostly pale and slight, though
healthy, with very light hair and eyes&mdash;at least such is their
general appearance, with of course many exceptions. They grow up
tall; the girls often very pretty and delicate-looking whilst young
(although very often disfigured by bad teeth); but I have seen
women of twenty-five or thirty, whose age I should have guessed to
be fifty at least. They marry very young, and the consequent "olive
branches" are extremely numerous. The boys grow up long, and often
lanky, seldom showing the strong athletic build so common at home,
or, if they do, it is spoiled by round shoulders and a narrow
chest, and, what puzzles me exceedingly to account for, a very
large proportion of both male and female natives <i>snuffle</i>
dreadfully; just the same nasal twang as many Americans have. In
some cases English parents have come out here with English-born
children; these all speak clearly and well, and continue to do so,
whilst those born after the parents arrive in the colony have the
detestable snuffle. This is an enigma which passes my sagacity to
solve.</p>

<p>Of course a large proportion of the population are emancipists
(convicts who have served their allotted years of transportation),
and their families or descendants; and a strong line of demarcation
is in most instances observed between them and the free emigrants
and settlers. Wealth, all-powerful though it be,&mdash;and many of these
emancipists are the richest men in the colony,&mdash;cannot wholly
overcome the prejudice against them, though policy, in some
instances, greatly modifies it. Their want of education is an
effectual barrier to many, and these so wrap themselves in the love
of wealth, and the palpable, though misplaced importance it gives,
that their descendants will probably improve but little on the
parental model. You may often see a man of immense property, whose
wife and daughters dress in the extreme of fashion and finery,
rolling home in his gay carriage from his daily avocations, with
face, hands, and apparel as dirty and slovenly as any common
mechanic. And the son of a similar character has been seen, with a
dozen costly rings on his coarse fingers, and chains, and
shirt-pins, glistening with gems, buying yet more expensive
jewellery, yet without sock or stocking to his feet; the
<i>shoes</i> to which his <i>spurs</i> were attached, leaving a
debatable ground between them and his trowsers! Spurs and shoes
are, I imagine, a fashion peculiar to this stamp of exquisites, but
among them very popular.</p>

<p>Many instances occur of individuals of this class returning to,
or perhaps for the first time visiting England, with the purpose of
remaining there to enjoy their accumulated wealth, and after a
short trial, coming back to the colony, heartily disgusted with the
result of their experiment. Here, as "small tritons of the
minnows," they are noted <i>by</i> their riches, and courted
<i>for</i> them; but at home, shorn of their beams by the thousands
of greater lights than their own, and always subject to unpleasant
prejudices and reflections touching "Botany Bay," and other like
associations, they find their dreams of grandeur and importance
woefully disappointed, and gladly hasten with all speed from the
scenes of mortified vanity. One of these adventurous worthies made
the voyage to England, landed, and remained in London a very brief
space,&mdash;not more, I believe, than one or two weeks,&mdash;when, fully
satisfied, he took ship and set forth back again. On arriving in
Sydney, his friends inquired his opinions of England;&mdash;Did he not
admire the magnificent buildings and streets in London? "Oh! very
well; but nothing like George-street!" At all events, the
extraordinary perfection and beauty of the English, horses
<i>must</i> have delighted him?&mdash;"No, not at all; nothing to be
compared with Mr. Cox's breed."</p>

<p>The good people of Sydney have yet many wise things to learn,
and many silly ones to unlearn, before they can attain that
resemblance to the higher middle classes at home which is their
anxious aim; and the shallow petty pride, or rather vanity, which
causes so many heart-burnings and such eager rivalry among those
who can often but ill afford its cost, is the mainspring of their
follies. The existence of such feeling in a colony, where all, with
very rare exceptions, have sprung from needy emigrants or
transported criminals, is too absurd to require a comment. Yet
pride, of a right kind, <i>might</i> be the best agent a new
country could possess; but it must be a generous, not selfish
pride; it must strive for renown in a general good, not an
individual aggrandisement; it must show a wise and liberal, not (as
is too much the case at present) an ignorant and sordid spirit; its
effort must be, not to rise above its neighbours, and, if possible,
thrust them lower still, in contrast to its own exaltation, but
aid, by an example of strict integrity and honour, careful
industry, increasing knowledge, and true morality, the interests of
the community at large.</p>

<p>The distinctions in society here remind me of the "Dock-yard
people," described by Dickens, that keen and kindly satirist of
modern follies. Thus&mdash;Government officers don't know merchants;
merchants with "stores" don't know other merchants who keep
"shops;" and the shopkeepers have, I doubt not, a little code of
their own, prescribing the proper distances to be observed between
drapers and haberdashers, butchers and pastry-cooks. The general
character of the invitations to the entertainments at Government
House has caused much discussion and animadversion; the citizens
who drive chariots not liking to be mingled in company with their
tradespeople who only keep gigs. But all this pride of place is so
very ridiculous and unbecoming in such a community, that were not
its tendency so mischievous, it could only provoke a smile.</p>

<p>English customs and fashions are carefully followed, and
frequently outdone by the more wealthy and (if I may be allowed the
phrase, in speaking of commoners) <i>aristocratic</i> of the
colonists. Their extravagant mode of living, combined with the
mania for speculation, has greatly contributed to the late and
still existing embarrassments of the colony. Many of their houses
are elegant villas, with rooms of noble dimensions, expensively
furnished with almost every luxury to be found in a gentleman's
residence in England, and environed by beautiful gardens, where
every description of fruit, both European and tropical, is
cultivated. The numerous servants too are a great and universal
expense. The smaller houses of merchants, and various professional
and official men, have much the style of those in suburban streets
in England, standing alone or in pairs, all protected from the sun
by verandas from six to twelve feet wide, with pretty gardens in
front, often fenced by high hedges of gay geraniums. Several of
these villa-streets are very pretty, and a most refreshing contrast
to the dust, dirt, noise, and closeness of the lower part of the
town, which is, from the climate and other causes, some shades more
unpleasant than any place I ever was in before.</p>

<p>These rambling "Sketches" of mine are fortunately not required
to be a complete "Guide" to all the lions, wonders, and beauties of
Sydney and its vicinity, for of many I am totally ignorant. I know
it possesses a pretty theatre, and that frequent concerts and
public balls are given at all seasons; but as my health did not
allow of my partaking in any amusement which demanded attendance in
close and heated assemblies, I cannot speak of them from
experience. Three annual "national" balls were given whilst I was
in the colony, which those present described as very gay affairs;
the tutelar saints of the three kingdoms being made patrons
extraordinary on the occasion&mdash;St. George presiding over the
English ball, St. Andrew over the Scotch, and St. Patrick, that
"gentlemanly" saint, over the Irish entertainment. A fourth ball
was then arranged, being a combination of the forces, and at this
fancy dresses were very generally worn, and some well supported.
All these balls were very numerously attended, it being quite a
matter of course for families to come above two hundred miles, even
in that climate, and over <i>such</i> roads, to attend a ball. How
any one at home would laugh at the idea of journeying an equal
distance on a like errand! even with all the aids of rail and
turnpike-roads, stage-coaches and post-chaises! But young ladies
are so numerous, and balls so comparatively rare, that it seems an
act of policy not to lose these occasional opportunities for the
display of charms that must otherwise "waste their sweetness on the
desert air."</p>

<p>There are several good inns in Sydney, much frequented by
bachelor settlers, and one, to which the married ones take their
families, at about double the expense of accommodation in a
first-rate English hotel; and whilst you are served with "King's
pattern" plate, and by half a dozen waiters, you miss many of the
commonest comforts to be found in every wayside hostel at home.
These and similar inconsistencies are perpetually striking a
new-comer, in every circumstance of life and every grade of
society.</p>

<p>A stranger cannot fail to notice the prodigious number of
public-houses in this place, and, judging from general appearances,
I fear they are only too well supported, and receive the greater
part of the earnings of the lower classes, among whom habits of
intemperance are unhappily very prevalent. The advocates of the
temperance and tee-total societies have, I believe, effected
considerable good, but much more remains to be done.</p>

<p>My readers doubtless remember the inimitable passages in
'Pickwick,' descriptive and illustrative of the "Eatanswill
Gazette," and "Independent," with their rival editors, Mr. Pott and
Mr. Hurk. It is my sincere opinion that some of the colonial
editors here have mutually resolved on attempting an exact
imitation of the style and manner of these renowned papers, for
their leading articles bear a most curious resemblance, fraught
with the most deadly hatred of each other, and the same unmeasured
powers of abuse and wholesale condemnation. Such terms as "Our base
and mendacious contemporary;" "That tissue of ignorance and
conceit, the &mdash;&mdash;;" "That mean-spirited creature, whose vile
insinuations we despise;" together with torrents of "rascal, liar,
scoundrel, booby, fool, venom, viper, toad," &amp;c. &amp;c., give
an indescribable piquancy and interest to their charming
productions; their brethren of Port Phillip, Hobarton, &amp;c.,
often zealously emulating their spirit and incomparable choice of
language; though some are of a very different stamp, and, strange
to say, are preferred by many persons who have the curious taste to
peruse with more satisfaction European news, and quiet discussions
of general topics, than the most fluent and animated harangues of
these eloquent opponents.</p>

<p>In the last chapter I have given my general impressions of
Sydney; the result of our entire residence in the town and
neighbourhood, rather than a mere first view, which could only
observe the surface of things, my first sojourn there being only
for a fortnight, when, our baggage being landed and stored, and all
other arrangements completed, we prepared for a journey "up the
country." My husband required to visit his sheep-stations on the
Murrumbidgee; but my travels were not to extend further than
Bathurst, about 120 miles.</p>

<p>Our first day's journey was merely an afternoon drive to
Parramatta, fifteen miles from Sydney, through alternate cleared
land and "bush," but all enclosed. The chief of the way-side houses
were those of publicans, round which drays and carts were usually
assembled, whilst their drivers refreshed themselves within, and
swarms of flies added to the torment and weariness of the miserable
horses and oxen, who often wait for hours the return of their
brutal and drunken guide.</p>

<p>The system of "clearing" here, by the total destruction of every
native tree and shrub, gives a most bare, raw, and ugly appearance
to a new place. In England we plant groves and woods, and think our
country residences unfinished and incomplete without them; but here
the exact contrary is the case, and unless a settler can see an
expanse of bare, naked, unvaried, shadeless, dry, dusty land spread
all around him, he fancies his dwelling "wild and uncivilized."
About some of the older houses in the colony a growth of
fruit-trees, and often British forest-trees, has succeeded the
despised aboriginal productions, and sometimes a few of the grand
Norfolk Island pines tower above the lower groups. Ungrafted quince
and peach trees form hedges in many places; and when not hidden in
the thick coat of dust which covers everything near a public road,
their greener hue is a pleasing change amidst the brown landscape.
Where land is not required for the plough, the trees are frequently
only cut down within a yard of the ground, which remains thickly
encumbered with the ugly blackened and burned stumps, giving the
appearance at a little distance of a large and closely occupied
graveyard; grubbing, or taking up the roots, being a far more
expensive operation. Many large trees are destroyed by a ring of
bark being taken off the trunk, when they die in the course of a
year, and their huge leafless skeletons have an indescribably
dreary and desolate aspect.</p>

<p>Maize, or Indian corn, which I here saw growing for the first
time, is a most ornamental crop, each plant being placed by itself,
and its long, broad, green leaves and crowning spire of blossoms
having a very graceful appearance. It is generally cultivated here
in lieu of other grain, for which the climate is less adapted, and
is always understood by the term <i>corn</i>, all other corn, such
as wheat, barley, &amp;c., being called grain.</p>

<p>The habitations of the working classes, for <i>poor</i> there
are none, are the least pleasing objects one meets with in this
colony. Instead of the neat clean cottage of an English labourer,
with its little glazed windows, and tidy though old curtains looped
on one side; its small garden-plot of vegetables, pot-herbs, and
sweet flowers, and cheerful, though humble aspect,&mdash;here you pass a
wretched hut or hovel, built of heaped turf, or more frequently of
"slabs" (rough pieces of split timber, set on end, like a strong
paling), and thatched, and which, if plastered with mud, would be
weather-proof and comfortable; but, for the most part, the slabs
are all falling asunder, the thatch half torn off, the window, or
rather the place for one, stopped with pieces of wood, hides, and
old rags; and the door, without hinges, inclining against the wall.
A heap of ashes and chips usually lies in front; broken bottles,
old casks, old rags, bones, and shoes, and various similar articles
are scattered around. Not a herb, not a cabbage is to be seen; no
attempt at making a garden, although a fence might be had for the
trouble of cutting it, and, by very little labour, abundant crops
of vegetables and fruit produced. Unfortunately, at the time I
speak of, wages were so high, that by working only a third or
fourth part of his time, a man could gain an ample livelihood, and
consequently those disposed to be idle had both time and money to
spend in drunkenness; the improvement and comfort of their homes
had no share in their thoughts; and the wife in many cases was as
bad as her husband; whilst the unfortunate children, growing up
without instruction, and under such examples, cannot be expected to
adopt any very moral or religious ideas. The rate of wages is no
doubt now much lowered by the increased number of emigrants; and
this, by compelling many to acquire more industrious habits, will
do immense good. I remember the wife of a turnpike-keeper near our
house, who was scarcely ever seen sober, and as rarely without a
broken head or a black eye. One day Mr. Meredith was driving a
friend to the races at Parramatta, and, on reaching the turnpike,
this engaging female was discovered seated at a table by the door,
with a cup and a half-gallon bottle of rum beside her, the effect
of which was already evident; she offered Mr. Meredith a ticket,
which he told her was not required, as she knew him so well from
his passing constantly&mdash;"Oh, sir, you'd better take it, for I
shan't know anybody by the time you come back!"</p>

<p>It is amusing enough, in traversing this colony, to come upon a
spot in the midst of the wild bush, where a great finger-post
stands to inform you that you are in the "township" of Monmouth, or
Rutland, or some other old country name, with other posts at
certain distances, bearing the names of streets, squares, &amp;c.,
where not the semblance of a human dwelling is visible, though all
arrangements seem made for a large and populous town. These, I
imagine, are some of the "town allotments," in which such extensive
and fatal speculations have been made in all parts of the
colonies.</p>

<p>We passed several "chain-gangs" working on the road; these are
convicts, who, from their great and repeated crimes, are sentenced
for various periods to work in irons in the service of the
government; and the villainous countenances of the greater number,
the clank of their chains, and the thought of how awful an amount
of crime had led to this disgraceful punishment, made me positively
dread passing or meeting a band of the miserable wretches. Very
erroneous opinions relative to the state of convicts in these
colonies exist at home as to the degree of hardship they endure. I
think I can in the course of these pages relate enough from my own
observation, to prove how much very many humane persons are misled
in their ideas on the subject. Even the chain-gangs, the lowest
grade of this class, do not perform on an average the third part of
the labour which any English mechanic or labourer does gladly and
cheerfully. Their rations of food are wholesome and abundant, and
their huts or barracks provided with every necessary. When sick,
they have the best medical care, and whatever additional luxuries
their state may require; and when I apply to them the term
"miserable wretches," I would be understood as applying it to their
crimes and social degradation, not to their corporal sufferings.
They work under the superintendence of overseers, and sentinels
with loaded muskets, who would shoot any one attempting to escape;
but notwithstanding every precaution, they do frequently evade the
vigilance of their guards, and, "taking the bush," that is, running
away into the forests, they often become formidable in their
attacks on travellers in the lonely roads up the country. Not long
ago, I saw an account of <i>eleven</i> murders having been
committed by one of these desperadoes, and accompanied by such
horrors of mangling, burning, and otherwise disposing of his
victims, as far exceed all the fearful tragedies of a like kind we
read of in the English papers. Several parties of bushrangers were
out at the time of our journey, but as that is generally the case,
it made no difference in our arrangements.</p>

<p>Parramatta is a straggling and extensive place, with good wide
streets, containing houses and shops of every size and description,
which are most agreeably diversified by the pretty gardens
encompassing many of them, shadowed with fine mulberry, orange, and
fig trees, and gay with luxuriant shrubs and flowers, among which
the large American aloe forms a prominent feature, and frequently
one appears in bloom. From its low situation, Parramatta is many
degrees warmer than Sydney, and though seated on the shores of Port
Jackson (here called the Parramatta river), it feels little if any
benefit from the sea-breeze, which in Sydney is so great a relief.
I may here add another link to the chain of antipodean absurdities
enumerated by Mr. Baron Field,* by asserting that all the rivers
are creeks, and all the creeks rivers; thus you hear people
continually talking of the Parramatta <i>river</i>, which is
neither more nor less than the higher portion of the estuary of
Port Jackson, and perfectly salt: whilst if by chance you meet with
a precious little stream of fresh water far inland, rest assured it
is nothing but a "<i>creek</i>," I was most amusingly puzzled by
hearing of "creeks" far away from the coast, and began to suspect
my geography to be in fault, when I soon found them to be what in
England we should call a brook or rivulet.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* "It is New Holland&mdash;where it is summer with
us, when it is winter in Europe, and <i>vice versâ</i>; where the
barometer rises before bad weather and falls before good; where the
north is the hot wind, and the south the cold; where the humblest
house is fitted up with cedar <i>(Cedrela toona)</i>; where the
fields are fenced with mahogany <i>(Eucalyptus robusta)</i>; and
myrtle-trees <i>(Myrtaceae)</i> are burnt for fuel; where the swans
are black, and the eagles are white; where the kangaroo, an animal
between the squirrel and the deer, has five claws on its fore-paws,
and three talons on its hind-legs, like a bird, and yet hops on its
tail [It is almost needless to say that this absurd idea has long
been exploded.&mdash;L.M.]; where the mole <i>(Ornithorhynchus
paradoxus)</i> lays eggs, and has a duck's bill; where there is a
bird <i>(Meiliphaga)</i> which has a broom in its mouth, instead of
a tongue; where there is a fish, one half belonging to the genus
<i>Raia</i>, and the other to that of <i>Squalus</i>; where the
pears are made of wood <i>(Xylomelum pyriforme)</i>, with the stalk
at the broader end; and where the cherry <i>(Exocarpus
cupressiformis)</i> grows with the stone on the outside."]</p>

<p>Orange-groves and vineyards are numerous in the vicinity of
Parramatta, and supply the "metropolis" with the chief of its
fruit. Various kinds of oranges are grown, both sweet and bitter;
among the latter, a very small one, called the mandarin orange, is
a pretty and fragrant fruit, and makes a delicious preserve. The
lemons are very different from those used in England, being much
the shape of an ill-formed Seville orange, but well-flavoured and
juicy.</p>

<p>Some of the houses are covered with vines, and the verandas of
others richly tapestried with jasmine, woodbine, roses, and
climbing plants of every description. The church is a
singular-looking edifice, having two blunt spires, one of which
only is surmounted with the usual vane and weathercock. The
Court-house has a handsome Grecian portico of cut stone, and the
"factory," or house of correction for female prisoners, the
hospital, schools, and other public institutions are large
establishments, but I never was within any of them, although
subsequently residing in the neighbourhood for some time.</p>

<p>After passing a particularly pretty garden, in which stood a
long low house, with a spacious piazza in front, I was surprised by
Mr. Meredith's driving up to the door, and still more so on finding
that this was our inn, where we had engaged rooms. My belief that
it was a private residence was natural enough, for the sign of the
"Red Cow" on the roof had escaped my notice; but we were most
comfortably accommodated in every way. The garden was full of
beautiful flowers, particularly the bright scarlet blossoms of the
pomegranate, the soft and fragrant oleander, and quantities of pink
and crimson china-roses. An enormous prickly-pear <i>(Cactus
opuntia?)</i> grew near the house (I think it must be twenty feet
high), and was full of yellow blossoms and dark red fruit, in
picking up some of which to taste, I stuck my gloves so full of the
fine penetrating prickles that it was some days before I extracted
them all from my hands.</p>

<p>Two beautiful birds were living tame in the garden; they were
called curlews, but I doubt if correctly. They were much the shape
of the avosetta, with long straight legs, long straight bill, a
prettily-marked brown plumage, and the finest eyes I ever saw in
any but the eagle or hawk tribe. The female was very shy, having
had her nest and eggs repeatedly destroyed by mischievous boys and
visitors; but the male was very familiar, following us all about,
uttering a plaintive cry, which I afterwards used to hear
frequently at night near our own residence, where they were very
numerous, though scarcely ever seen.</p>

<p>Several of the native parrots were caged in the veranda, and
talked a little; one kind, as large as the grey and green parrots
so often seen in England kept as pets, had a most elegant plumage,
the back, wings, and upper part of the tail being pale
lavender-colour, and the breast and tail-<i>linings</i> the most
delicate pink. Beside these hung the prison of a lovely little
creature, called the Bathurst parrot or parroquet, or, as I named
it then, and have done ever since, the "painted lady," as on each
cheek (or whatever ornithologists call the part of a bird's face
which corresponds to that human feature) there is a round spot of
soft crimson orange-colour; the rest of the fair lady's attire
being bluish lavender, with a pale primrose-coloured breast; a long
tail, and pretty sly eyes, make her one of the most beautiful of
this numerous and gay tribe of birds. In the streets, too, we met a
"native companion," or gigantic crane, walking about perfectly tame
and fearless, being a sort of general pet among the inhabitants; he
was between three and four feet high, and his enormous bill, keen
eyes, and grave demeanour gave him a most sapient and dignified
appearance as he stalked along, peering about, and sometimes
pausing before one of the shop-doors, to take a more minute survey
of matters within. But the chief glory of Parramatta in the
bird-line is now, alas! no more. This was a tame magpie at one of
the inns, of whose fluent conversation and wonderful ventriloquism
I have heard most surprising stories, but I never saw the prodigy
myself.</p>

<p>On quitting Parramatta the following day, we passed near
Government House, which is beautifully situated in a fine domain,
and frequently visited by the governor. Sir Maurice O'Connell,
commander of the forces in Australia, now resides there. The road
to Penrith passes occasionally through pleasant scenery, though
chiefly monotonous enough, and the intense heat made me almost
incapable of enjoying anything; added to which, the indescribable
chirruping, creaking, and whirring of myriads of grasshoppers
(<i>dust</i>-hoppers more properly), that seemed to fill all space
around us, was almost intolerable; and what was very extraordinary,
these unwelcome musicians were wholly invisible, nor could the most
rigid observation detect them. They seemed to be a little below the
surface of the loose dusty soil, and ceased their noise when I
approached them. I afterwards detected some of their kindred at
Bathurst, at least the voices were the same, and found them to be
insects of the true grasshopper shape, with small wings, and about
an inch long; but these colonies swarm with an immense variety of
these long-legged insects of all sizes, from a quarter of an inch
to two inches in length, and of all colours; brown in every shade
(particularly the tints of withered grass and dead gum-leaves),
green of the brightest hues, grey, black, reddish, and purple. Many
of the large ones are very handsome and curious creatures.</p>

<p>Penrith is a long village, containing a few pretty, and many
new, raw-looking houses, profusely adorned with green paint on the
windows, shutters, verandas, and railings, and some had very nice
flower-gardens in front. We drove through the town to an inn some
distance beyond it, close to the ferry over the Nepean, the first
<i>river</i> I had seen in the colony, and the only one I did see
there. The fine view of the Blue Mountains, rising beyond the level
Emu Plains on the other side the river, beguiled me into walking in
a garden on the banks till driven away by the clouds of mosquitoes;
and as we sat in the veranda after dusk, I observed a single bright
fiery spark glancing swiftly about in front of the house, now
rising high into the air, and again falling, darting quickly to and
fro, and occasionally resting a few seconds. On inquiry, I was told
it was a fire-fly; but I was not aware that the bright creatures
were found in New South Wales, nor did I ever observe more than
this one.</p>

<p>I was told of an amusing incident which occurred to a new
arrival during our stay. The traveller in question, putting on a
most important aspect, walked into the stable, where the ostler was
busy in his various duties, and pointing to a horse, inquired if he
had been fed. "Yes, sir." "Give him another feed now directly." It
was done. "Now, ostler, let that horse be ready for me at six
o'clock to-morrow morning. Do you hear?" "<i>That</i> horse, sir?
That isn't your horse, sir!" "No? Then which <i>is</i> my horse?"
The steed was pointed out, and the proprietor departed. "Who is
that person?" asked Mr. Meredith of the grinning functionary.
"Can't say, sir; but I reckon he's a gen'leman wot's newly
cotched!"</p>

<p>Early the following morning we resumed our journey, in company
with a friend with whom we had arranged to travel the remainder of
the way. Ourselves, carriages, and horses were safely ferried over
the Nepean in a large punt, or railed raft, and landed on the
opposite bank, when we drove merrily along the Emu Plains, so named
no doubt from the flocks of emu formerly found there; but as
civilized, and therefore doubly destructive, man advances in a new
country, he invariably exterminates or scares away the timid
creatures that have for ages dwelt there undisturbed; and now these
noble birds have become unknown, except in the almost untrodden
districts of the interior. I saw two tamed ones in a part of the
government domain at Sydney; they are most noble-looking birds, and
seemed quite happy in the comparative freedom they enjoyed. Their
eggs are of a rich dark-green colour, with a rough surface, like
the rind of a coarse orange, or shagreen, and are about the size of
those of an ostrich, which bird the emu resembles in general
appearance, though handsomer and less awkward.</p>

<p>We had a fine view of the long range of the Blue Mountains
before us, and of the abrupt gorge through which the Nepean flows
before reaching Penrith. This pass is described as being extremely
grand on a nearer approach, as indeed it must be, from the
perpendicular height of the mountains, and the large volume of
water pouring through so narrow a channel.</p>

<p>After driving for about two miles over the level plains, we
reached the foot of Lapstone Hill, the first ascent, up which an
excellent road has been made, winding along the side of the
mountain, with high overhanging rocks on the left hand and a deep
wooded ravine on the right. The wild scenery and the zigzag road
reminded me of some of the "passes of the Alps," as drawn by
Brockedon, save that our ravine had no foaming torrent roaring down
it; and it was only by most intent observation that I could detect
something like moisture trickling over the rocks, where an opening
in the trees left the far-down stony bed visible.</p>

<p>It was October, and, as I have before remarked, the spring
months are by far the <i>greenest</i> in this land of ever-browns;
so that I saw the country under rather favourable circumstances,
although the severe droughts of the two preceding years had
destroyed the artificial crops, and even the native grasses, to a
deplorable extent. Still, among these lofty mountains and in their
shady recesses the trees and shrubs grew in unchecked luxuriance,
and yielded me many a new and beautiful flower. As we slowly wound
up the steep ascent, and the folding hills narrowed the view behind
us, the scene was most picturesque and striking. Far on before us
we could see the white-gleaming road still climbing higher and
higher; looking back, the plains, reduced to a triangular section
by the closing hills, were fast receding from the landscape;
gigantic crags, piled high overhead, were mingled with an endless
variety of tree, shrub, and flower; and far below, from the depths
of the ravine, the opposite side of the pass rose almost
perpendicularly, till its upper trees seemed to cut against the
bright, unclouded, blue sky. I was quite delighted, and thought
that if all our progress over the dreaded Blue Mountains were as
pleasant and interesting as the commencement, the journey would be
much less wearisome than I anticipated.</p>

<p>I had often been told of the "waratah" <i>(Telopea
speciocissima)</i> and its grand appearance when growing; and as we
drove along, instantly recognised from the description the first of
these magnificent flowers we saw, and soon after came more into
their especial region, which is about half-way up the height of the
mountains, few being seen either far above or below this range.
From the temperature, I should think their cultivation at home
would be easy, and it would well repay some pains to have such
noble flowers added to the treasured wealth of English gardens. The
stem is woody, and grows perfectly straight, from three to six feet
in height, about the thickness of a walking-cane, and bearing rich
green leaves (something like those of the oak, but much larger) all
the way up. At the top of this stem is the flower, entirely of the
brightest and richest shade of crimson-scarlet. A circle of large
spreading petals forms its base, from which rises the cone or
pyramid of trumpet-like florets, three, four, or five inches high;
the whole flower being much the size and shape of a fine artichoke.
Sometimes the stems branch off like a candelabrum, but more
generally the flowers grow singly, one on each stalk, and look like
bright flambeaux amidst the dark recesses of these wild forests.
Unfortunately I had no opportunity of making a drawing of one,
having no materials at hand on our journey, and failed to procure a
flower during our stay in Sydney. The few plates I have seen give
but a very faint idea of this most stately and regal flower.</p>

<p>After driving for some miles nearly all up-hill, we stayed to
breakfast at a small way-side public-house, where the slovenly
slipshod women, dirty floors, and a powerful odour of stale
tobacco-smoke, gave me no very favourable expectations of
cleanliness or comfort. On the smoke-stained walls hung some very
highly coloured and showily framed prints, representing young
gentlemen with red cheeks and very blue coats trying to look very
hard at young ladies in pink gowns with very large sleeves; and
severally inscribed, "The Faithful Lovers;" "The Betrothed;" "The
False One," &amp;c.; ingenious distinctions of character, which it
would have been extremely difficult to discover from the portraits
alone.</p>

<p>In many places you find some particular dish more generally in
vogue than others, but in New South Wales one universal, reply
follows the query of "What can you give us to eat?" and this is,
"'Am an' eggs, Sir;" "mutton-chops" forming the usual
accompaniment, if required. So ham and eggs we had, and
mutton-chops too; but from their being fried all together, in the
same dark-complexioned fat, the taste of these viands was curiously
similar, and both of impenetrable hardness. Unless great care is
taken, meat spoils so soon in this climate, that the custom among
most persons is to cook it almost as soon as killed, which of
course precludes the possibility of its being tender. Tea, with
black sugar, but no milk, and bread without butter, completed the
repast, with the addition of "damper," a composition respecting
which there are divers opinions, some persons preferring it to
bread, whilst I think it the worst way of spoiling flour. The
etymology is perhaps "Dampier," this indigestible food (an
excellent damper of a good appetite) being supposed by some persons
to have been invented by the great circumnavigator, and the
manufacture is this:&mdash;A stiff dough is made of flour, water, and
salt, and kneaded into a large flat cake, two or three inches
thick, and from twelve to eighteen broad. The wood-ashes are then
partially raked from the hot hearth, and the cake being laid on it,
is heaped over with the remaining hot ashes, and thus bakes. When
cut into, it exceeds in closeness and hard heaviness the worst
bread or pudding I ever tasted, and the outside looks dirty, if it
is not so: still, I have heard many persons, conversant with every
comfort and luxury, praise the "damper;" so I can only consider my
dislike a matter of taste. In "the bush," where brewer's yeast
cannot be procured, and people are too idle or ignorant to
manufacture a substitute for it (which is easily done), this
indurated dough is the only kind of bread used, and those who eat
it constantly must have an ostrich's digestion to combat its
injurious effects.</p>

<p>At the period of which I am writing, wheat in Sydney had reached
the exorbitant price of 10<i>l</i>. 16<i>s</i>. per quarter, to
which every mile of distance from thence added cost, and this
naturally induced every one to economize flour as much as possible;
accordingly ground maize, boiled rice, and other things were added
to the bread for this purpose, making it hot, bitter, or
unpleasantly moist, as the case might be, but I do not remember
seeing one instance of the flour being used unsifted, as it is in
so many families at home, from motives of health or preference,
although it might have been so used at such a time of dearth with
manifest advantage.</p>

<p>Adjoining to this comfortless habitation (called an inn) was a
small plot of potato-ground, but no attempt at neatness or
improvement was visible; all was slovenly and neglected. The dirt
and indescribable combination of ill smells within, was but a type
of the state of things without. In the rear of the house one vast
undistinguished rubbish-heap spread around, bounded only by some
wretchedly dilapidated outhouses and stables, and reeking with foul
exhalations, on which, and its more tangible delicacies, a large
conversazione of pigs seemed to luxuriate most satisfactorily.
Several children were lying or lounging about in close
companionship with the pigs, equally dirty, but apparently less
lively. Miserable creatures! I thought of the contrast between them
and children in a similar station at home, for this wretched place
would rank with the "Lion" or "Traveller's Best" of a country
village in England, with its couple of clean white-draped spare
chambers, and its gay best parlour as neat and bright as a new pin.
The landlady, a rosy comely dame with a cap of driven snow and
smart flowered gown; the landlord, in cords and blue stockings,
velveteen coat, and sturdy figure, a beau ideal of an English
yeoman; and the children&mdash;most of them are at school, but the rest,
what clean, shiny, red, laughing, frolicsome young rogues they are!
Look on this picture and on that! No&mdash;not again; so whilst my
companions enjoyed their cigars in the cobwebbed veranda, I crossed
the road, and was, at once in the wild bush, where I rambled for
some time, interested by everything around me, though careful to
keep tolerably near the house. Strange birds were fluttering and
whistling in the trees; thousands of grasshoppers, large and small,
leaped up wherever I went, tumbling down again in their helpless
way, with all their legs abroad, and taking a few seconds to gather
themselves into place again for a fresh jump; myriads of ants, of
various sizes and species, were as busy as ants always are, running
hither and thither, up and down the smooth-barked gum-trees, in
long lines reaching from the ground far beyond my sight into the
tall branches; and here and there, near some old or fallen tree, a
swift little lizard would dart into his hole, giving me barely time
enough to see that he was not a snake, of which fearful creatures I
have a just and most intense terror.</p>

<p>In the course of this and the following day's journey we passed
many of the gigantic ant-hills common in some parts of New South
Wales. They are great conical heaps of finely worked earth cemented
into a hard mass, and from six to ten feet high, with no visible
orifice outside, nor did I see a single ant about them, though I
closely examined several. I have been told they are the work of a
white ant, and, from their magnitude, should suppose them the
habitation of a species of termite. When cut open, they display
numerous small cells, but on our journey I had neither time nor
inclination to destroy and investigate their domestic arrangements
myself. The earth of which these ant-hills are formed, is so finely
prepared by the little architects that it is used by the settlers
in the neighbourhood as plaster, and frequently as cement for
floors.</p>

<p>Many various kinds of ants inhabit New South Wales and Van
Diemen's Land; I know about a dozen species myself. One is a very
formidable-looking personage, full an inch long, with a shiny coat
of mail gleaming purple and blue, and a threatening sting, which I
am told inflicts a most painful wound, as severe as that of the
hornet. Besides these are several other large kinds, some entirely
black, others with red heads, bodies, or legs. One, with black body
and yellow forceps, not only acts on the defensive, but openly
attacks any one passing too near him, by jumping at them, and
stinging or biting severely; I have often been surprised to observe
the distance they can spring when irritated or disturbed. Of the
smalls kinds the numbers "are as the sands upon the sea-shore."
They swarm in every part of the bush, and infest houses to an
intolerable degree. In our house near Sydney, and also our present
residence in Van Diemen's Land, I have been excessively annoyed by
them; not an atom of anything sweet can be hidden from their
attacks: sideboard, pantry, storeroom, cellar, and kitchen, are all
alike besieged by the industrious little torments.</p>

<p>They bury themselves in sugar, and drown in jam, cream,
custards, or tarts; and their odour and taste are so indescribably
nauseous, that their repeated visitations become rather expensive.
Setting the forbidden viands in vessels of water seemed a perfect
remedy, but still the ants gained access to them, and to my
amazement I saw whole squadrons of the tiny black army deliberately
marching across the water, and climbing the dishes within. Some
particles of dust had no doubt fallen on the surface, and enabled
them to step over dry. Ants are certainly most interesting
creatures (always providing they preserve a respectful distance
from one's grocery and sweetmeets), and in the bush I often watch
them with great pleasure and without an idea of disturbing them.
One day I observed a bright yellow circle on the ground, and on
stooping to see what it might be, discovered a quantity of the
golden-coloured petals of a small kind of cistus which grew near,
neatly cut up into little bits (about the sixteenth of an inch
wide), heaped all round an ant-hole, and crowds of my tiny
household foes or their relatives busy in various ways.</p>

<p>Some were running about the low branches of the cistus bushes,
carrying fragments of the petals towards the heap; others, busy
"getting in" the harvest, would come up the hole, seize on a bit of
the treasure, and, with the aid of four or five more, pull it down
below. Sometimes two parties would bring their burden just to the
opening at the same moment, and as the passage was only wide enough
for one set at a time, a furious and determined struggle took place
as to which should first succeed, which, like many disputes among
larger animals, seemed to make up in violence what it wanted in
magnitude. I watched the indefatigable little creatures for some
time, until I became quite cramped from my crouching position, and
still the same routine of business went on with unabated
activity.</p>

<p>"Mais revenons à nos moutons!"&mdash;We continued our journey through
a wild and barren country, utterly destitute of herbage; the
inhospitable Blue Mountains were before, behind, and on either side
of us, rising in grand and dreary monotony of form and colour.
Forests of tall gum-trees covered them from base to peak, but
instead of a beauty in the landscape, these were a deformity. All
bore the marks of fire far up their branchless, blackened stems,
and in many places the burning had been so recent, that for miles
the very earth seemed charred, and not even a stunted shrub had
sprung up again. The trees, huge masses of charcoal to all
appearance, had no branches till very near the summit, and these
bore only a few scattered tufts of rusty leaves, scarcely casting a
visible shadow, and affording no shade. The steepest ravines had
not the semblance of water in their dry dreary depths, and but for
the fearful quagmires and deep holes in the road (which made the
utmost care in driving requisite to avoid an upset over the
precipice), one would not have thought that rain or dew ever
visited this desert region.</p>

<p>The main portion of the road is <i>bad</i> beyond an English
comprehension; sometimes it consists of natural step-like rocks
protruding from the dust or sand one, two, or three feet above each
other, in huge slabs the width of the track, and over these
"<i>jumpers</i>" as they are pleasantly termed, we had to jolt and
bump along as we best might. How our springs stood such unwonted
exercise is an enigma still; but as a vehicle of the barouche
species, crammed in every imaginable corner with live freight and
luggage, had passed the inn whilst we were at breakfast, I am
inclined to think that springs in colonial use must be made of
sterner stuff than I had hitherto given them credit for.</p>

<p>The track we were now traversing usually winds terrace-wise
along the side of a steep mountain, and is barely wide enough
anywhere to allow of two vehicles passing each other. All the
produce of the settlers in the upper country is conveyed to Sydney
by this road, and farm supplies taken up from thence: therefore it
is no uncommon thing to meet a train of six or eight heavily laden
drays (for the continual depredations of bush-rangers render it
advisable that several should travel in company), each drawn by
eight, ten, or twelve oxen; and to encounter such a caravan on the
narrow mountain road is by no means a desirable incident. The
patience and docility of the ox are justly proverbial, but
unfortunately colonial drivers are less gifted with these virtues,
and their violence, ill-temper, and brutal usage often seem to
bewilder the poor weary creatures, who, having no harness but bows
and yokes, twist round and entangle themselves, much to their own
peril and that of any passing horses or carriages. We once narrowly
escaped a serious accident from this cause, by driving down the
bank, steep as it was, out of the way.</p>

<p>Two years of desolating drought had preceded our arrival in
Sydney, and the melancholy proofs of its ravages among the brute
creation met us here at every turn, in the remains of unfortunate
oxen, that had perished of want in their toilsome journeys over the
mountains, where neither food nor water remained for them; and as
the dray-journeys from the distant stations to Sydney occupy from
three to six weeks, the lingering, protracted misery endured, even
by the wretched animals who survived, is horrible to contemplate.
In some places by the road side white skeletons alone remained;
farther on we saw other carcasses still covered with hide; then
bones again; and so on, continually meeting these terrible proofs
of the poor brutes' sufferings and death. It recalled to my mind
descriptions I have read of the caravan-tracks in the sandy deserts
of Africa, where the bleached bones of animals that have perished
in the journey serve as guides to future travellers.</p>

<p>The climate changed materially as we gained the higher regions
of the mountains, becoming quite cold, and I gladly wrapped up in
cloaks and furs; our companion, who usually drove within hail of
us, retired into a grotesque cloak-hood-and-coat sort of a garment,
made of the thick furry opossum-skins of the Colony, and looked
like an exaggerated Esquimaux, as we caught a glimpse of his portly
figure now and then through the thick flurries of sleety rain that
swept round us, the sudden squalls being too furious for any
umbrella to live in them.</p>

<p>So, laughing merrily (when the wind did not take our breath
away), we drove briskly on, our destination for the night being the
"Weatherboard" inn (so named from its being built, like many houses
in the Colony, wholly of wood, the walls consisting of thin boards
lapped one over another, nailed to upright slabs or posts, and
lathed and plastered within). What was my dismay, as I was just
ready to alight, cold, tired, and hungry, at the door of this
mountain refuge for the destitute, on our being informed that the
house was full and not a sleeping-place to be had! A native settler
returning from Sydney to Bathurst with his wife and family were in
possession of all the accommodation. These were the occupants of
the loaded carriage I had seen, who, with more foresight than
ourselves, had pushed on as rapidly as possible in advance, and
seized upon the whole establishment.</p>

<p>After a short debate it was determined to go on six miles
further, to a smaller hostel, known as "Blind Paddy's," though it
was nearly dark, and raining fast. However, on we went, "through
bush and through brier," to say nothing of holes and rocks in the
road; and in process of time, long after dark, reached our little
inn, very wet, and colder and hungrier than ever. A couple of
decent elderly women appeared to do the honours, and ushered us
into a small but clean whitewashed room, gaily adorned with
feathers, shells, and the droll little pictures usually found in
such houses: a bright wood-fire was soon crackling and blazing
merrily on the white hearth; the homely table was quickly spread
with a coarse but snowy cloth, and supper most expeditiously
prepared, consisting of the never-failing dish "ham and eggs,"
chops, damper, tea, and&mdash;crowning luxury of all&mdash;a dish of hot
mealy potatoes, smiling most charmingly through their cracked and
peeling skins. Wine in such houses as this is rarely drinkable, but
excellent English ale (at 3<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per quart bottle)
is generally found in them, so that our repast was by no means
contemptible, and the air of plain homely cleanliness about the
arrangements added to all an unwonted relish.</p>

<p>A tolerable night's rest in a room about the size of our
ship-cabin, with a clean dimity bed and window-curtains, and no
worse nocturnal visitants than a moderate party of the universal
"light infantry," left me quite recruited and ready for setting
forth again on our onward journey, after a breakfast very similar
to our supper, or rather dinner, of the preceding evening.</p>

<p>Our route still lay through the same wild, monotonous scenery as
the day before. The sight of vast mountain-ranges spread all
around, folding in and behind each other as if they filled all
space, could not be otherwise than <i>grand</i> in the extreme, but
it was most dreary, desolate grandeur. Trees without foliage, hills
and valleys alike destitute of verdure, chasms and ravines yawning
beside us, without a thread of water in their arid, stony depths,
made up such a world of desolation, that the contemplation of it
became absolutely oppressive, and I gladly listened to glowing
descriptions of the green and beautiful plains of Bathurst, which
we were to reach the following day.</p>

<p>In one place we came to an almost precipitous descent in the
road, called "Soldier's Pinch," or "Pitch," most probably from some
accident which has happened there. It was a mass of loose stones,
continually rolling from under the horses' feet, and so steep as to
be very fatiguing even to walk down, which I preferred doing, not
being quite reconciled to such roads for driving on. At the foot
lay huge masses and heaps of wood, trees of all sizes having been
hooked on to the drays at the summit of the Pitch, to prevent their
rushing down suddenly, despite locked wheels, and overrunning the
unfortunate oxen. If Major Mitchell, when Colonial Surveyor, had
turned his attention and directed his men's labour to such places
as this, and remedied their dangerous character, he would have
rendered great and essential service to the colonists; but in the
generality of instances his road has been made where a <i>good</i>
bush-track formerly existed, and the really bad and dangerous
portions remain in very many instances untouched&mdash;at least such was
the case when I crossed the mountains. I could not avoid noticing
likewise, that Major Mitchell's road, wherever originally marked by
him, was almost invariably carried over the summits of hills,
whilst level valleys lay within a few hundred feet; and as we
proceeded, I looked out for the highest peaks ahead of us, knowing
by experience that the surveyor's road would lead us over them. I
was informed that a determination to adopt no other person's
suggested line of road was the reason of this most inconvenient and
fatiguing route being resolved on, and I have since heard that a
new survey is to be made, and a more level and rational track
marked out.</p>

<p>The only portion of the present road for which I can give Major
Mitchell great credit is the Pass of Mount Victoria, by far the
most grand and striking scene in this mountain region. As we
approached it, a huge barrier of rocks seemed to close up the
onward path, till a sudden turn showed us a gorge cut in them,
through which we drove, with a high wall of crags on the right hand
and the lofty summit of the mount towering up on the left. Another
turn brought us out of the chasm, and in full view of a most grand
and beautiful landscape. The road was carried (from the opening of
the chasm) by an arch and embankment across a deep valley that lay
below, called the Vale of Clwydd, and along the side of the
opposite mountain, till it gradually reached the level of the
valley beyond. We stayed some minutes on the embankment to enjoy
the prospect, so refreshing to eyes weary of the dark desolate
sterility of the scenes we had just emerged from. On the left hand,
the high rocky range of which Mount Victoria forms a part nearly
enclosed the narrowing valley, the lower portions being overgrown
with gum and wattle <i>(Acacia)</i> trees, amidst which grotesque
rocks rose up here and there like fantastic ruins. From the deep
water-courses that were plainly visible on the mountain-sides, the
stream running through the vale must sometimes be considerable; but
at the time we passed it was dry, and its tolerably green banks,
shadowed by groups of graceful young gum-trees, had quite a smooth
and lawn-like aspect as compared with the rough country around. On
the right hand the same long range of precipitous rugged heights
continued, stretching away to the north-east; and safely girdled by
their fortress-like and frowning walls lay the pretty vale of
Clwydd.</p>

<p>Clustering richly about the shrubs near Mount Victoria I first
observed the lovely "native indigo" of New South Wales <i>(Kennedia
ovata?)</i>. It is a delicate little climbing plant, with slender
stems, long, narrow, blunt leaves, and a profuse quantity of small,
violet-blue pea-shaped flowers, growing in long sprays, and
completely clothing any bush or fence where it flourishes. We had
alighted on the archway, to enjoy the view at leisure, and I, as
usual, indulged my rambling and scrambling propensities by a
descent into the ravine below, where I found many lovely flowering
shrubs, including some dozen species of acacia, some of them very
fragrant.</p>

<p>A large gang of convicts were stationed here road-making, and
several of than importuned us for money or tobacco, showing such
truly villainous countenances that the idea of being waylaid by
bush-rangers gained tenfold horror, and the knowledge that many
were out made me often look very earnestly at a misshapen gum-log
or crooked tree, fancy transforming it to "a highwayman, with
pistols as long as my arm." In one place, we met a couple of
soldiers in search of some newly-escaped convicts; they were
running about in a half-stooping position, peeping and thrusting
their fixed bayonets into every thin bush and low tussock of grass
where a man could not by any possibility be hidden, with most
valorous resolves no doubt, but cutting rather a ludicrous figure.
I am not aware if they succeeded in their chase, but have strong
suspicions that they did not.</p>

<p>A comparatively level road succeeded to the grand mountain pass,
and we journeyed on to our mid-day resting-place, called the
"Rivulet," the little stream at this place being by some remarkable
accident rightly named. A new, glaringly smart-looking inn here
promised tolerable accommodation; it was as fine as twenty
differently coloured kinds of paint could make it. Panellings and
"pickings-out" of rainbow hues were set off by pillars of imitative
and varnished marble, the like of which no quarry ever knew; and
these again, touched up with bronze-paint and gilding, gleamed in
the sun with almost dazzling lustre. A good veranda led by French
windows to the two front rooms, into which I walked, without seeing
any inhabitants or attendants. A few gaudily painted chairs, a
small bad mirror in a large gilt frame thickly shrouded in yellow
gauze, and a new cedar table covered with tobacco-ashes and
liquor-stains, composed the furniture of either apartment.</p>

<p>After a long and ineffectual sonata on the hand-bell (no other
description being seen, save in a very few of the very best
colonial houses), just as I began to despair of its power, a young
girl shuffled along the hall from some of the back settlements, and
holding fast by the door-handle, for she was almost too much
intoxicated to stand, took my orders for luncheon, and after many
vain attempts at length succeeded in wiping the table with a
ragged, very dirty apron. Her dull light-coloured hair hung in
matted tangles about her neck and ears; her dress was disordered,
torn, and dirty; and her face bloated and stupid from the effects
of drink;&mdash;never did drunkenness wear a more revolting aspect, and
I felt relieved when the wretched creature left the room. My
companions had a similar tale to tell of the male portion of the
establishment; every soul was drunk, and it was some time before
they could arouse any one to attend to the horses. The same
unfortunate girl I had before seen, laid our cloth, and brought
what we wanted, or rather what we could get, for I imagine the
copious libations indulged in by the whole household had made them
regardless of eating, and the larder was accordingly very ill
supplied. Bread and a few eggs (positively without ham!), which our
ministering Bacchante rolled on the floor as she staggered in with
them, formed our repast, but she took pains to impress upon us the
pleasing assurance that "There was plenty o' ale an' sperrits."</p>

<p>We strolled down to the banks of the little rivulet, where I
found many beautiful flowering shrubs, and the verdure of the
adjacent little flats showed how excellent a garden might be made
there, but I fear never will; idleness and drinking are such
besetting sins, and money to provide them both so easily earned by
"keeping a public" in this Colony, that nothing demanding bodily
exertion is attempted. Meat can run about and feed itself on the
wild hills, and flour they can buy; fruit and vegetables they
"don't heed," as they would demand some little labour to
produce.</p>

<p>As we returned towards the house, I looked at it again, as it
stood in raw, shiny, comfortless newness, like a great toy freshly
unpacked. Behind it lay a crowd of dirty, old, ruinous hovels, that
formerly served in its stead, and still were used as outhouses,
stables, &amp;c, all broken, and half unthatched. All the fences
within sight exhibited the same dilapidated aspect, whilst
ash-heaps and other less sightly things lay all around. How
different would be the state of almost everything in this Colony,
were that greatest curse man ever created out of God's good gifts,
intoxicating liquor, less easily obtained by those who <i>ought</i>
to be the industrious and prosperous, but, alas! too generally are
the idle and worthless, part of the community. Time, money,
character, decency, feeling, principle, ambition, and honesty&mdash;all
are sacrificed to the demoralizing passion for rum, when once it
gains the ascendency; and to know how often that is, we need only
observe and listen to the sad evidence so continually passing
around us. I perhaps praise the tidy appearance and good cookery of
a friend's servant: "Ah! yes, she is an excellent cook, but we can
so seldom keep her <i>sober</i>."</p>

<p>The coachman of another seems quite a model for his class, till
you hear he is so confirmed a drunkard that his mistress dares not
trust him to drive her home alone from a party. Another family have
an honest old "major-domo," faithful and good in every other point;
may be trusted with "untold gold," but not with a bottle of rum. It
is a universal failing, and a really sober servant or mechanic may
consequently be held as a pearl of great price. Age and sex make no
difference; your dainty lady's-maid or pretty young nurse-girl is
just as likely to be over-liberal in her libations to Bacchus as
your groom or shoeblack; and no threats, no bribes, no punishments
avail to keep the besotted creatures from the dram-bottle, if it be
by any means or in any shape accessible. I have known a female
servant drink camphorated spirits of wine, and suspect the same
individual of consuming a pint of hartshorn which mysteriously
disappeared about the same time from my room; its evident strength
being no doubt too tempting. Eau de Cologne and lavender-water, I
know, they drink whenever they are left about, or anything else
believed to contain spirit. The universality of this vice is most
dreadful to contemplate, and far worse to witness and endure.
Almost the only exceptions among the lower classes are the families
of English emigrants, who, accustomed to poor living and hard work
at home, continue sober and industrious, thankful for the many
hitherto unknown comforts and luxuries they can enjoy, and
carefully and fearfully abstaining from all excess. Of this class I
have known excellent examples, both old and young, male and female,
and can only hope that in time their better and wiser course may be
appreciated and emulated by other portions of this now numerous
population.</p>

<p>OUR road now lay over hilly ground again, sometimes skirted by
live trees and a slight semblance of herbage, and often approaching
in wild and sterile grandeur the scenery we had before traversed. A
singular range of perpendicular cliffs form a striking feature in
the landscape at a place called "Hassan's Walls." These walls or
cliffs rise, I should think, to a height of about 300 feet
perpendicularly above the road, and their summits, broken and
fissured in various fantastic forms, exactly resemble a ruined
castle crowning the brow of the sheer precipice, with here and
there a stunted tree or graceful shrub growing from crevices in the
dark rock. Had I been travelling in an old country, I should at
once have decided that these were truly the ruins of some mighty
mountain-fortress of former days; loop-holes, arches, battlements,
and buttresses were, as it seemed, so clearly remaining, and
extending far along the airy heights of these genii-haunted crags,
for such I half fancied them, especially when a turn in the road
gave to view a colossal head standing well out against the clear,
bright, blue sky, and bearing a strong resemblance to the venerable
and veteran Duke of Wellington.</p>

<p>We paused to contemplate the rude though striking likeness; and
then, as we slowly drove on, the features changed, and a judge with
a flowing wig stood frowning down on us; another turn, and another
change came over the mountain statue, and then it again resolved
itself into a mere turret of the hoary ruin. I thought of the
mysterious castle of St. John,* with its wizard transformations,
and of how much romance would attach to these fantastic crags in a
romantic or legendary country; but the existence of poetry or
imagination in New South Wales is what none who know and have felt
the leaden influence of its ledger and day-book kind of atmosphere
would believe it guilty of suffering.</p>

<p>The grass-tree <i>(Xanthorrhoea arborea?)</i> is one of the most
strikingly novel plants I observed in our mountain journey, and is
common in most hilly or rocky places both in New South Wales and
Van Diemen's Land. A young grass-tree appears merely a large
reedy-leaved plant without a stem, the leaves being very long,
narrow, and sharp, and growing erect for a foot or more, then
curving over and nearly touching the ground, forming a thick boss
or circle; but as the tree becomes older, the lower circles of
leaves drop off, the young growth all rising from the centre; and
in time a thick stem appears, from one to eight or ten feet in
height, and two feet in circumference, rough with the scars left by
the fallen leaves, and bearing on its summit an immense drooping
cluster of foliage, which reminded me of a palm-tree (although it
must be confessed, by rather a clumsy resemblance). From the centre
of this cluster the scape rises like an enormous bullrush or typha,
frequently measuring ten feet and more in height, the spike being
about a foot long, of a yellowish brown colour. Groups of this very
singular plant often give a picturesque and somewhat Oriental
aspect to an otherwise uninteresting landscape, some being old,
crooked and deformed, hump-backed and knobby; others erect and
stately, bearing their verdure like a royal diadem; whilst the
young ones, sitting close to the ground in all humility, look up to
their patriarchal neighbours with the patient hope of one day
rivalling their nobler growth. A resinous gum exudes from the
grass-tree, said to resemble in great measure the dragon's blood
prepared from the Pterocarpus and Calamus. Boiled with oil, it has,
I believe, been successfully used for covering the bottom of
vessels, instead of pitch. I have also heard that the natives cut
out the pith of the trunk to eat.</p>

<p>The next point of our route having any claim to the picturesque
was the rocky ravine at Cox's River; the sight of clear running
water is always pleasant, but nowhere more delightful than in so
dry and thirsty a clime as this. The ruins of numerous huts,
formerly occupied by a convict-gang at this spot, gave it rather a
desolate look; but the clear little brook (for such in England
should we call this river) gurgling merrily over its pebbly bed,
had a sweet music in its voice that made me forget all
disagreeables. We tasted, and then crossed it, and immediately
began the steep ascent of Mount Lambey, which rises abruptly from
the river's bank. This mount had been the highest point in our
landscape all day, and accordingly, despising all humbler and
easier tracks, over its very summit passes Major Mitchell's vaunted
road. Seven long miles of climbing were before us, up as bare,
sterile a mountain as ever gloomed on a wayfarer's path. The rock
is a splintery slate, not unlike many in old South and North Wales,
and its dark grey and purple hue, stained in places with a rusty
tinge, gave a dismal monotony to the scene, which scarcely a shrub
or herb appeared to relieve.</p>

<p>An inn has very wisely been built half-way up this inhospitable
mountain, and there, at the auspicious sign of the Queen Victoria,
we purposed remaining the night, which was fast approaching, for
the rapid departure of twilight leaves little time after sunset
available for travelling. After a weary pull of four miles, the
gracious countenance of our fair Queen (somewhat libelled by the
artist, it is true) beamed on our most loyal and rejoiced eyes from
amidst a chaos of crown, sceptre, red drapery, and ermine; and our
tired horses, after a last resolute effort, stopped at the inn
door. At the same moment we heard a hand-bell sharply and loudly
rung within, and after a minute's delay the landlord appeared at
our summons, with the pleasing intelligence that he was very sorry
indeed, but he could not accommodate us. As it was impossible to
proceed farther in this case, there being no other habitation
within a long stage, and our horses knocked up, Mr. Meredith and
Mr. Campbell declared their determination to stay at all events;
and again questioned the landlord, who then admitted his own
willingness to receive us (and who of his class ever voluntarily
rejected good customers?), which he could easily do at some
trifling inconvenience, but Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; (whose party had, the
preceding evening, excluded us from the "Weather-board") was there,
and the instant we stopped had <i>ordered</i> that no one else
should be admitted, as they had taken <i>all the house!</i></p>

<p>This most overbearing monopoly, however, did not prevent our
being comfortably installed in a snug little parlour, and a
tolerable bed-room, which some of the landlord's family vacated for
us, whilst the sofa in the sitting-room was made up into a bed for
our companion. I am well aware that had we been known at the time,
the conduct of this "lady" would have been very different; but at
such an hour, and in such a place, no woman possessed of common
humanity would have desired to turn a beggar from the door. The
pride of wealth, unmixed with aught of better or nobler feeling, is
too often the sole and engrossing principle and characteristic of
persons raised by some fortunate chance to that kind of rank which
in these Colonies, where the worship of Mammon reigns triumphantly,
is at once accorded to the <i>rich</i>: "What <i>has</i> he?" not
"What <i>is</i> he?" being the test; and this petty superiority is
often the foundation of absurd and selfish importance, of which the
above trifling incident is an apt illustration.</p>

<p>I am happy to say we found the members of this royal
establishment sober, industrious, and civil; a most welcome
contrast to the inn at the Rivulet, and, despite our unpropitious
reception, were tolerably comfortable.</p>

<p>The following morning we again set forth, and after completing
the ascent of Mount Lambey, proceeded to descend its opposite side,
a far more pleasing task, especially as the surrounding country
gradually assumed a less wild and inhospitable aspect. There is one
little peculiarity in Colonial bridges, at least those usually met
with on roads like the one of which I am treating, which it may be
proper to mention; namely, that it is always safer to plunge into
the stream, morass, or ravine they stretch across, and wade or
scramble out the best way you can, horses, carriage, and all, than
to trust their treacherous and far more dangerous conveniency, for,
like the celebrated bridge planned by Jack the Giant-killer for the
destruction of the two-headed Thundel, they are apt to part company
just as the passenger has passed too far to recede. In one place I
remember seeing men erecting a stone bridge, with strong, good
masonry; but the usual contrivance of a few long poles, covered
with turfs, is far from satisfactory.</p>

<p>We rested about mid-day at a tidy public-house, which, although
the fair hostess is believed to suffer from the prevailing thirst
after strong drinks, we found very neat and clean; the miniature
apartments set forth with bright Birmingham tea-trays,
conch-shells, and the beautiful tail of the lyre pheasant, whilst
the whitewashed walls and dimity curtains preserved their purity
most surprisingly in this fly-tormented country. We had experienced
the effects of the drought in the exorbitant charges made for the
horses at every place we stopped at; and here, for a few handfuls
of bad hay, ten shillings were added to the other items of the
bill.</p>

<p>Journeying on, we arrived in process of time at the spot whence
the first view of those lovely and verdant plains of Bathurst, of
which I had heard so much, was to greet my delighted eyes.</p>

<p>"There, look! Do you not see them through the trees?"</p>

<p>I did look, anxiously and eagerly, directing my eye-glass
towards every point of the compass in succession; still nothing
green could I discern, but on a nearer approach beheld a wide
extent of brown earth, with occasional flurries of dust passing
across it; and this was all that remained of the so-vaunted
Bathurst Plains! Every blade of grass and every green herb had
disappeared during the drought, and a dry desert usurped their
place, whilst a few thin, weak, widely-separated little roots of
dry, withering everlastings <i>(Gnaphalium)</i> were the only
things bearing the semblance of vegetation. It was very dreary!</p>

<p>We drove along the tedious road across the plains, which just
undulate enough in places to prevent a person from seeing entirely
over them, and that is all; no hill, grove, or tree, scarcely a
bush, breaks the heavy, weary monotony, till the tired eye rests on
the dim outline of the distant hills. At length a few straggling
houses and a church showed us that we approached the settlement;
but as this is divided into two portions about a mile asunder, with
the deep channel which is sometimes (water permitting) the river
Macquarie between them, we had yet farther to go. The second
division of the township contains the gaol, police-office, female
factory, barracks, Scotch chapel, and bank, with several stores and
small shops of a most heterogeneous character, where you may find
iron pots, writing-paper, blonde lace, fire-arms, Dutch cheese, "P.
coats," crockery, and various other commodities, though very rarely
the one article you require. The private dwellings are of all
grades, but chiefly of the smaller class; and the public-houses, as
compared with the others, very numerous.</p>

<p>The bank, then the residence of near relatives, was our
destination, and most welcome to me were the happy quiet and rest
of the next few days, after our not very long, but tedious and
fatiguing journey.</p>

<p>Bathurst, being the last township on the "up-country road," is
comparatively a place of some importance, and frequently visited by
settlers from the less civilized districts beyond, to whom it is a
kind of half-way metropolis, as well as being in their direct road
to Sydney, whence there is a mail-cart twice a week (the distance
being 120 miles); a strange-looking two-wheeled vehicle, carrying
the post, the driver, and two passengers when required. Travelling
both night and day, and over the chief part of the delectable roads
I have faintly described, at a hand-gallop, it is not exactly the
conveyance to be selected by nervous or comfortable persons. How
the whole concern escapes destruction, at least once a week, seems
miraculous; but with the favourite bush assurance of "No fear,
Sir!" away they go, driving at the pace of a hunt over ground that
would make a steeple-chaser look twice; and if there be no fear,
there is certainly far less danger than might be supposed, for I do
not remember hearing of above half a dozen accidents during our
residence in the Colony.</p>

<p>We found Bathurst still suffering severely from the devastating
and ruinous consequences of the terrible drought. Every article of
food was extremely dear, and nothing good could be procured at any
price. Meat was lean to starvation, and flour liberally adulterated
with various cheaper ingredients; vegetables there were none;
butter and milk had long been but a name; and all horse corn, hay,
&amp;c., so extremely scarce, and exorbitantly dear, that the
neighbouring families had for some time ceased to use their
carriage-horses, the poor animals not having strength to perform
any work. The cost of a horse at livery was then one pound per
night, and it had recently been two pounds. Visiting Bathurst under
such peculiarly unfavourable circumstances, I could not be expected
to form any very high opinion of its beauties or advantages; every
one told me how very charming a place it had always been, and so I
am bound to believe it was, and may be again; but as I saw it, the
inevitable impression on my mind was of a most dreary and
unpleasing character. Its position, in the middle of a large plain,
some twenty miles across, combines many disadvantages, one of the
greatest being the distance which all the fire-wood used in the
settlement has to be brought, and its consequent high price; one
pound being given for a small load, which in most places in the
Colony, where it costs nothing, would not serve for more than a
winter day's consumption in a moderately-sized household (indeed I
believe <i>more</i> is burned in our kitchen alone), but here a
much greater economy is necessary; and as the cold is often as
extreme here in winter as the heat is in summer, the scarcity of
fuel is a serious evil.</p>

<p>I found the climate of Bathurst still less pleasant than that of
Sydney, as in the latter place, however oppressive be the heat, the
mid-day sea-breeze moderates it in some degree; but the plains of
Bathurst (although considerably elevated), being shut in on all
sides by lofty ranges of mountains, must endure without any relief
their own oven-like atmosphere, the temperature of which is
frequently increased tenfold by a "hot wind," when it seems as if a
fiery blast from a huge furnace pervaded all space around, rushing
into the house through every opening with the force of a hurricane.
My English habit of flinging wide open all doors and windows in
warm weather, I here found (as a matter of course, so near the
antipodes) a most imprudent course to pursue, as the only chance of
preserving a moderately endurable existence during the continuance
of the sirocco is, immediately on its approach to shut every door
and window, and with closely-drawn blinds to await, as patiently
and movelessly as half-suffocated mortals may be expected to do,
the abatement of the terrible visitation. With us, however, a few
hours of faintness, thirst, and misery generally comprise the whole
evil (though sometimes the hot winds blow almost without
intermission for several days), but the luckless fields and gardens
escape not so easily. Every green thing looks as if a salamander
had been held over it, either drooping and dying, or dried up like
half-burned paper. I have seen large tracts of cultivated land,
covered with luxuriant green crops of wheat, barley, or oats just
going into ear, scorched, shrivelled, absolutely blackened by the
heat, and fit for nothing but to cut as bad litter. Less important,
though extremely vexatious, is the destruction caused in gardens,
where the most delicate and beautiful flowers are ever the first to
wither under the burning breath of this fervid Air-king.</p>

<p>These siroccos always blow from the north-west, and by some
persons are supposed to derive their heat from tracts of unknown
deserts in the intertropical regions of this island-continent.
Their power is felt strongly, though less frequently, in Van
Diemen's Land. One might almost fancy the Ancient Mariner to have
experienced one during his ghostly voyage, he so accurately
describes their aspect:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">"All in a hot and copper sky<br>
The bloody sun at noon<br>
Right up above the mast did stand,<br>
No bigger than the moon."</p>

<p>I several times observed at Bathurst a phenomenon by no means
unusual on the large plains of New South Wales, in dry weather,
being a procession across them of tall columns of dust&mdash;whirl-winds
in fact, which preserve a nearly uniform diameter throughout their
whole length, the upper end seeming to vanish off, or puff away
like light smoke, and the lower apparently touching the earth. They
move in a perpendicular position, quietly and majestically gliding
along one after another, seeming, at the distance I saw them, to be
from seventy to a hundred feet high, and about twenty broad. Thus
viewed, they do not appear to travel particularly fast, but Mr.
Meredith tells me he has vainly endeavoured to keep pace with them
for a short time, even when mounted on a fleet horse. When they are
crossing a brook or river, the lower portion of the dust is lost
sight of, and a considerable agitation disturbs the water, but
immediately on landing the same appearance is resumed. As some
vanish, others imperceptibly arise, and join the giant-waltz; and
when I first observed this most singular display, I amused myself
by fancying them a new species of genii relaxing from their more
laborious avocations, and having a sedate and stately dance all to
themselves. When the dance ends, these dusty performers always
appear to sit down among the neighbouring hills.</p>

<p>I never heard of these gregarious whirlwinds being at all
mischievous; they only pick up dust, leaves, little sticks, or
other light bodies, which whirl round in them with great velocity;
but other and far more terrible visitations occur in the
hurricanes, which, like those of the western world, devastate the
tract of country over which they pass. Mr. Meredith, in returning
from his visit to the Murrumbidgee, encountered one of the most
fearful of these terrific tempests. At Bathurst on the same day we
had a violent thunder-storm, with a heavy fall of rain and large
hailstones, but the fury of the tempest passed chiefly near the
river Abercrombie. I shall avail myself of my husband's
observations in his own words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have often seen the effects of former hurricanes in New South
Wales, the indications being the total destruction of all trees in
the course the hurricane had taken, which course I generally
observed to be from the north-west. The length to which the
devastation extended I had no opportunity of estimating, but the
breadth averaged from 400 to 800 yards. On one occasion I saw the
spot where a hurricane had terminated in a whirlwind. My companion
and myself had ridden for some distance along the path it had
pursued, the direction of which was plainly indicated by the trees
it had uprooted in its course all lying one way; the termination
was as plainly shown by a circle, in which the trees lay <i>all</i>
ways; and such is their partiality, or rather, so clearly are the
boundaries of both hurricane and whirlwind defined, that in cases
where the blast did not reach the trunk of a tree, the branches
ware torn off from one side, without uprooting the stem.</p>

<p>"In the beginning of November, 1839, I was journeying from
Goulburn to Bathurst by the direct route of the Abercrombie river,
through a wild country, covered almost entirely with forests of
very lofty gum-trees. On my departure from Mr. McAllister's station
in the morning, the wind was blowing strong, and the sky betokened
tempestuous weather. As the day advanced, the gusts of wind became
more and more violent, occasionally bringing down the branch of a
tree. When I had arrived within three or four miles of the
Abercrombie river the air became suddenly warm, and a few flashes
of vivid lightning accompanied by loud thunder denoted the approach
of a storm. A strong instinctive sensation of fear came over me,
such as I never before experienced; and in a short time, perhaps a
minute, I heard a strange, loud, rushing noise; the air grew
rapidly dark and thick, and my horse was evidently, like myself,
under the influence of intense fear, and trembling violently. I
exclaimed (although alone), 'This is a hurricane!' and jumped off
my horse at the <i>end</i> of a fallen tree; the poor animal
endeavoured to shelter himself by backing under a growing tree,
which I prevented by a violent pull at his bridle, and then for the
space of a minute or two saw nothing; the hurricane, for such it
was, had reached me, and everything was in total darkness. I fell
on my knees, still holding my horse's bridle. The roaring, crashing
sound was deafening, but it soon passed by, and the atmosphere
again became clear enough to admit of my observing surrounding
objects. My horse and myself stood alone in what a few seconds
before had been a high and dense forest; every tree was prostrate,
either broken or uprooted, including the one from under which I had
luckily pulled my horse, its ponderous trunk lying within a few
feet of us. Fortunately the track of the hurricane was in the same
direction as that in which the fallen tree lay at the end of which
I dismounted, and thus the small space was left which saved us
both. Immediately that the hurricane had swept by, the rain fell in
torrents, exceeding anything I ever witnessed in the tropics, and a
heavy gale continued for two days."</p>

<p>The horse Mr. Meredith had with him then, a beautiful creature,
and a great favourite, retained an evident recollection of
<i>his</i> terror in the hurricane long after&mdash;indeed, until we
parted with him, on leaving the Colony. If a branch of a tree only
lay before him in the road, or a twig blew across him, he would
look fearfully at it, start, snort, and tremble, which, as he never
used to notice such things before the occasion above mentioned, we
believed to be the result of some remembrance or association in his
mind. Perhaps the term <i>mind</i> is wrong as applied to a brute,
however noble in nature, but this evident memory seems something
above instinct.</p>

<p>It savours strongly of an Irishism to say so, but the chief
inhabitants of Bathurst live at some distance from it; many of the
wealthy, and also higher class of settlers, having farms and good
residences within a few miles, which renders the society superior
to that of Colonial settlements in general. Nearly all are situated
on the verge of the plains, combining both the flat and hilly
country in their surrounding scenery, and their gardens and
vineyards, which at the time we were there were slowly recovering
their former verdure and luxuriance, seemed morsels of a brighter
world, when compared with the arid waste around the township. Among
these the pretty and picturesque residence of our good and
venerable friend Captain Piper is as much distinguished by its
beautiful situation as by the long-proved worth and hospitality of
its owner, than whom I heard of no person in New South Wales more
universally respected. Hospitality is so general a feature in
Australian society, and I remember with so much pleasure the kind
attentions which I, as a "stranger in the land," received for my
husband's sake, that only a very remarkable pre-eminence would
induce me to break my prescribed rule of abstaining from all
personal allusions in these pages.</p>

<p>About three miles from Bathurst, near a pretty cottage on the
Macquarie (in a district chiefly granite), is a singular group of
low rocks rising abruptly from the turf of the plains, and
perfectly white; they appeared to me to be masses of pure quartz,
of which many specimens occur a few miles higher up the river.
Pebbles of very clear quartz crystal are sometimes found in the
neighbourhood, but the natives search for them so successfully,
that I only picked up one or two small ones.</p>

<p>These crystals, although by no means rare, are preserved as
"charms" by the Aborigines, being given to them by their doctors,
or "Crodjees," after a variety of ceremonies, which Mr. Meredith
describes to me as highly absurd, he having been present at the
rites, when performed by a tribe at Dundunemawl on the Macquarie,
about forty miles below Wellington Valley. Great preparations were
made, as for a grand Corrobbory, or Festival, the men divesting
themselves of even the portions of clothing commonly worn, and
painting their naked black bodies in a hideous manner with
pipe-clay. After dark they lit their fires, which are small, but
kept blazing with constant additions of dry bark and leaves, and
the sable gentry assembled by degrees as they completed their
evening toilettes, <i>full dress</i> being painted nudity. A few
began dancing in different parties, preparatory to the grand
display, and the women, squatting on the ground, commenced their
strange monotonous chant, each beating accurate time with two
boomerangs. Then began the grand corrobbory, and all the men joined
in the dance, leaping, jumping, bounding about in the most violent
manner, but always in strict unison with each other, and keeping
time with the chorus, accompanying their wild gesticulations with
frightful yells and noises. The whole "tableau" is fearfully grand:
the dark wild forest scenery around&mdash;the bright fire-light gleaming
upon the savage and uncouth figures of the men, their natural dark
hue being made absolutely horrible by the paintings bestowed on
them, consisting of lines and other marks done in white and red
pipe-clay, which give them an indescribably ghastly and fiendish
aspect&mdash;their strange attitudes, and violent contortions and
movements, and the unearthly sound of their yells, mingled with the
wild and monotonous wail-like chant of the women, make altogether a
very near approach to the horribly sublime, in the estimation of
most Europeans who have witnessed an assembly of the kind. In the
midst of the performance on this occasion, two men advanced,
bearing between them a large piece of bark, about six feet high and
three feet wide, rudely painted with red and white clay, the design
consisting of a straight line down the middle, and diagonal ones
thickly marked on each side. The exhibition of this wonderful and
mystic specimen of art caused extreme excitement and admiration,
and the bearers held it in the midst of the dancers, who bounded
and yelled around it with redoubled energy. Presently the oldest
"Crodjee" present approached the charmed bark, and walked slowly
round and round, examining it in every part, and then carefully
smelling it, up and down, before, behind, and on all sides, with
grave and reverential demeanour. This was to "find where the charms
lay," which charms, consisting of small crystals, he had of course
concealed about his person. After a great deal of smelling and
snuffing, he commenced violently sucking a part of the bark, and,
after some other manoeuvres, spat out a "charm" into his hand, and
went on sucking for as many as were then required.</p>

<p>These charmed crystals are kept with great care by the
possessor, his wife usually having charge of the treasure, which
she carries in the family "wardrobe," and the loss of one is
esteemed an awful calamity. The charm-sucking ceremony takes place
at the full moon, the time generally chosen by the natives for such
celebrations. In this instance the Crodjee's part of the
performance was very clumsily done, and Mr. Meredith asked one of
the men, the following day, "if he were such a fool as to believe
that the Crodjee really sucked the crystals out of the bark?" The
fellow winked, nodded, and looked wondrously wise, and intimated
that <i>he</i> certainly <i>knew</i> better, but that it would not
do to <i>say</i> so. And thus is fraud perpetuated, alike by savage
and by civilized men, and thus ever do policy and expediency take
the place of truth and honesty!</p>

<p>One of the aboriginal dances is called "the Kangaroo dance," and
one man, wearing a long tail, drops down on his hands and feet,
pretending to graze, starting to look about, and mimicking the
demeanour of the animal as nearly as possible; the others, in the
character of dogs and hunters, performing their part of the play in
a circle round him, at a very short distance.</p>

<p>The natives I saw at Bathurst were less ugly and better
proportioned than I expected; the men being far superior to the
women, though none of them are tall or largely made; six feet is a
most extraordinary size among them. The sable picanninies were
naked, long-armed, large-stomached, little bodies, giving one the
idea of a new sort of spider; I never had seen a black child
before, and did not see enough of them then to familiarize me with
the novelty. Several of the men knew Mr. Meredith, and whilst I was
one day making some purchase in a store, one of them accosted him
at the door, pointing at the same time to me. "Lady there, that Gin
'long o' you?&mdash;Ay, Ay?" "Yes, that's my Gin."&mdash;"Ay, Ay?" Then
somewhat banteringly, "Bel you got Gin (you have no Gin); poor
fellow you&mdash;you no Gin!" A "poor fellow" meaning a bachelor, and
the possession of a wife, among them, being in fact equivalent to
keeping a servant, as the unfortunate Gins perform all the
labour.</p>

<p>Judging from what I have heard, I imagine that their marriage
customs are as truly <i>savage</i> as any other of their strange
ceremonies. Polygamy is general among all who can attain the
desirable wealth of several wives, though few have more than two
living with them at one time.</p>

<p>Female children are sometimes "promised" in infancy to their
future husbands (frequently decrepit old men), and others appear to
be taken by means of force and ill usage, as is the case among many
savage nations. The men are always tyrannical, and often brutally
cruel to their unfortunate wives, who really seem to occupy as
miserable and debased a position, in every respect, as it is
possible for human beings to do. I never before heard of, or could
have conceived, any state so pitiable and so utterly degraded. If
some of the zealous Missionaries of whom we hear so much were to
endeavour to raise the moral and social condition of these wretched
creatures, and to teach them a few of the simple principles and
virtues of Christianity, they would indeed be worthily
employed.</p>

<p><i>Severe</i> personal chastisement is among the lesser
grievances of the poor Gins. One day Mr. Meredith saw one of them
crying most bitterly, and asked what was the matter. She replied,
that she was going to get a beating because she had accidentally
broken her husband's "pyook" (pipe). Mr. Meredith directly went to
the fellow, and tried to dissuade him from his brutal purpose; but
in vain, unless another pyook were given him, on which condition he
would let her off. Unfortunately there was not one to be procured;
and notwithstanding all my husband's persuasions, and his
representations to the black tyrant of the simple fact, that even
if he killed his wife, that would not make him a new pipe, he
remained doggedly sulky, and the next morning the poor Gin appeared
with her <i>arm broken</i>, from the cruel beating he had given her
with a thick stick. Such instances are of frequent occurrence.</p>

<p>These poor unhappy wretches are <i>slaves</i>, in every social
sense, and are not even permitted to feed but at their husband's
pleasure, and off the offal he may choose to fling them, although
on them devolves the chief care of providing the materials for the
repast. Two meals a day is the full allowance of the natives; but
as they cook all they have for supper, and gorge themselves then to
their utmost ability, breakfast depends on the possible remains of
the feast. Their usual food consists of kangaroos and opossums
roasted whole, without any portion being rejected; and they
greedily devour garbage, entrails, &amp;c. of any kind they can
pick up, quantity rather than quality being the desideratum as
regards provisions. Sometimes they feed more daintily, procuring
turtle, fish, wild turkeys' eggs, guanas, snakes, 'and some large
kinds of grubs, which are reckoned great luxuries. Occasionally the
women dig up a bitter hot root, not unlike a bad radish, which
serves them for a meal, in default of better viands.</p>

<p>Each family have their own fire, round which they sit to eat.
The husband first takes the opossum, &amp;c., tears it to pieces
and gnaws off his own favourite morsels from the joints, which he
then hands over his shoulder to his wife, who waits patiently
behind him; and should food be scarce, her supper is a tolerably
light one. The children are "helped" much in the same manner; and
when, either from having eaten as much as they can, or all they
have, the family have finished their repast, they crouch round the
fire and go to sleep.</p>

<p>The single men, emphatically termed "poor fellows," have one
fire in common; and with them, as with the family group, it is a
point of etiquette to hand round their half-gnawed bones to one
another.</p>

<p>Great fondness is usually displayed by parents for their
children (if they survive the perils of infancy), and instances
have often occurred of a couple, who had several little ones of
their own, adopting some poor friendless orphan, and freely
bestowing on it an equal share of their scanty food. Such cases I
have known frequently among the <i>poor</i> at home: they who have
least to give, and are consequently most intimate with the misery
of want, have the greatest compassion and charity for
fellow-sufferers.</p>

<p>Although they appear to treat their children kindly when they
can in some measure help themselves, yet infanticide is frequent
among the women, who often dislike the trouble of taking care of
their babies, and destroy them immediately after birth, saying that
"Yahoo," or "Devil-devil," took them. One woman, whom Mr. Meredith
saw a day or two after the birth of her baby, on being asked where
it was, replied with perfect nonchalance, "I believe Dingo
patta!"&mdash;<i>She believed the dog had eaten it!</i> Numbers of the
hapless little beings are no doubt disposed of by their unnatural
mothers in a similar manner.</p>

<p>I never could make out anything of their religious ideas, or
even if they had a comprehension of a beneficent Supreme Being; but
they have an <i>evil</i> spirit, which causes them great terror,
whom they call "Yahoo," or "Devil-devil:" he lives in the tops of
the steepest and rockiest mountains, which are totally inaccessible
to all human beings, and comes down at night to seize and run away
with men, women, or children, whom he eats up, children being his
favourite food; and this superstition is used doubtless as a cloak
to many a horrid and revolting crime committed by the wretched and
unnatural mothers, who nearly always, when their infants disappear,
say "Yahoo" took them. They never can tell which way he goes by his
tracks, because he has the power of turning his feet in any
direction he pleases, but usually wears them heels first, or, as
they express it, "Mundoey that-a-way, cobbra <i>that</i>-a-way"
(feet going one way, and head or face pointing the other). The name
Devil-devil is of course borrowed from our vocabulary, and the
doubling of the phrase denotes how terrible or intense a devil he
is; that of Yahoo, being used to express a bad spirit, or
"Bugaboo," was common also with the aborigines of Van Diemen's
Land, and is as likely to be a coincidence with, as a loan from,
Dean Swift; just as their word "<i>coolar</i>," for anger, very
nearly approaches in sound our word <i>choler</i>, with a like
meaning.</p>

<p>I have seen a vocabulary of the language used by the native
tribes near Adelaide, together with a few particulars touching
their superstitions and customs*, but the words wholly differ from
those used to express the same thing by the tribes about Bathurst,
Goulburn, and the Murrumbidgee. I have been told by a friend of Mr.
Meredith's, who had made himself thoroughly acquainted with many of
the tribes, and was known among them as the "chief who spoke their
tongue," that great diversity of dialects exists among them&mdash;not
slight variations merely, but a distinctly different vocabulary, of
which he gave me many striking instances. As my few examples of
their patois will show, the natives who are acquainted with the
settlers soon acquire a curiously composite tongue, where English
words sometimes masquerade in most novel meanings, but so arranged
as to be very soon understood, especially if used to beg
anything.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* In a paper by John Philip Gell, Esq., of
Hobart Town, published in the Second Number of the 'Tasmanian
Journal.']</p>

<p>In all the tribes some particularly solemn ceremonies are
performed previously to a youth's being permitted to rank among the
warriors, or "men;" but these take place in a very secret manner,
not even the women being present. One of the initiatory rites, as
practised among some tribes, is the knocking out one of the
novice's front teeth.</p>

<p>The natives pay great respect to old age; that, and valour,
comprising the only distinctions of rank allowed among them. The
best fighting man is the chief or head of his tribe, and in case of
his death, the next best takes his place, and inherits his wives.
The other warriors and the old men form a sort of council, which is
convened as occasion demands, when peace, war, and all other points
of importance are discussed and decided upon.</p>

<p>A man named Hougong was some time chief of a Maneroo tribe, and
another, called Jimmy the Rover, was second-best man. Jimmy
mortally hated Hougong, but contrived to conceal his animosity
under the mask of extreme friendliness, which, as his chief was no
doubt as great an adept at hypocrisy as himself, was of little
consequence. One day Jimmy went to a stock-keeper in the
neighbourhood, to propose that he should ask them both to go
duck-shooting, and requesting the loan of two guns, one of which
should be loaded with ball, for himself, the other with powder
only, for Hougong. "Well, me and Hougong go out look for duck, ay,
ay. Bel make-a-light duck!&mdash;Den me pialla Hougong&mdash;'Good many time
you want fight along o' me; <i>now</i> fight, like it white man,
along o' musket.' Well, me pialla&mdash;'You shoot first time.' Well,
that fellow shoot. 'Ah! you 'tupid fellow, bel hit it!' Den me
shoot; directly tumble down Hougong!"</p>

<p>Which notable speech, rendered into English, would be, "Well, I
and Hougong shall then go and look for ducks. Ay, ay&mdash;we don't see
any ducks. Then I say to Hougong, 'You have wanted to fight me many
times; let us fight now, like white men, with muskets.' Well, I
say, 'You shoot first.' He shoots.&mdash;'Ah, you stupid fellow, you did
not hit me!' Then I shoot, and Hougong falls dead!"</p>

<p>Shortly after the failure of this most treacherous and
cold-blooded scheme of murder (for of course he was refused the
guns) Jimmy heard that Hougong was dead. Great were the
lamentations raised for their brave chief by his tribe, and most
vehement and vociferous of all were the howlings and groanings of
Jimmy the Rover. A friend of Mr. Meredith's, who was present at
part of the mourning, found Jimmy full of public woe and private
exultation, venting the latter in theatrical <i>asides</i> to those
in his confidence, during the impetuous outpourings of his
tumultuous stage-effect grief, beginning at the top of his voice,
and howling most hideously down its whole gamut, more like the
yelling of a discontented dog than any other vocal performance I am
acquainted with.</p>

<p>"Oh! oh! oh! oh! Ooo-oo-oo-oo-ah! [Cabou (big) rogue that fellow
Hougong!] Oh! oh! oh! oh! Oo, oo, oo-oo. [Now he dead, directly me
maan (take) his Gins!] Oh! oh!" and <i>DaCapo</i>.</p>

<p>Accordingly, as soon as decorum and etiquette permitted, the
triumphant Jimmy prepared to go and take possession of his new
honours, when who should arrive, alive and well, but the defunct
and bemoaned Hougong himself!&mdash;and who, on hearing of Jimmy's kind
intentions, promised him a sound beating for his pains.</p>

<p>The various expression conveyed by the peculiar "Ay, ay," so
constantly used by the natives in speaking, is perfectly
indescribable. It is used doubtfully, positively, interrogatively,
or responsively, as the case may be, and contains in itself a whole
vocabulary of meanings, which a hundred times the number of words
could not convey in writing. Suppose you inquire of a native if he
have seen such and such a person pass, as he has gone that
way:&mdash;"Ay, ay?" (interrogatively.) "Yes, a tall man."&mdash;"Ay, ay"
(thoughtfully). "A tall man, with great whiskers." "Ay, ay
(positively). Good way up cobbra, cabou grasse; ay, ay"
(corroboratively).</p>

<p>"Good way up cobbra," means "head high up;" <i>grasse</i> is
used to express hair, beard, or moustache; and <i>cabou</i> means
great deal, or very much. The aborigines wear no beards themselves,
but a friend of ours, who had cultivated a most patriarchal growth
of that commodity, excited great awe and admiration among them.</p>

<p>The labour and pains they bestow on their corrobbory toilets
prove them by no means insensible to the advantages of personal
beauty, although their manner of enhancing their natural charms, in
adding a thick stratum of pipe-clay to their usual coating of
grease and other accumulations, seems indeed "<i>as</i> wasteful
and ridiculous excess" as "to paint the lily, or throw a perfume on
the violet." In lieu of</p>

<p class="poem">"Rowland's inestimable oil Macassar,"</p>

<p>their black elvish locks are always plentifully loaded with
opossum or snake fat, which unsavoury unguent, as maybe imagined,
adds its share to the powerful and not too-pleasing odour natural
to them.</p>

<p>A sable exquisite preparing for an evening party first
undresses, then thrusts a large lump of pipe-clay into his mouth to
soften, and when of a proper consistency uses his forefinger as a
pencil, dipping it into the composition, and carefully dispensing
the cherished ornament over his person. Having, with infinite
regard to the general effect of the pattern, accurately striped and
crossed, and wavy-lined and dotted every accessible part of his
figure, he selects a trusty friend on whom devolves the important
and responsible office of finishing off the work of adornment; and
this done, no reigning belle of the season ever entered Almack's
with more consciousness of all-powerful beauty than he feels in
taking his place among the equally elaborate costumes of his
companions. I fear the poor young squaws, or "Gins," have but
little to do with their own disposal in marriage; but doubtless
many a tender heart must be touched by these D'Orsays of the
wilderness; and many a pipe-clayed hero is painted in indelible
tints on the memory of love. My husband's animated and pantomimic
descriptions of these scenes have often made me laugh heartily; but
a second-hand detail must of necessity lose much, if not all the
interest.</p>

<p>The aboriginal songs which I have heard are far from unpleasing
in sound, and some have considerable melody, with much more tune
and variety than those of the New Zealanders, which surprised me,
as the latter people are so immeasurably superior to the natives of
New South Wales in everything else. The words which the latter sing
usually celebrate some great feast, nearly all being about eating.
One (translated) runs nearly thus:&mdash;"Eat great deal; eat, eat, eat:
eat again, plenty to eat! eat more yet; eat, eat, eat!" &amp;c.
&amp;c; and this is sung to a rather plaintive, pretty air! Another
song consists of a like repetition of "Wind blow, blow; wind blow,"
&amp;c.; the air being really pretty. The events celebrated by
these songs are seldom of a very dignified description. On one
occasion a bullock-driver, known to some of a tribe, got drunk,
fought his companions, and had a black eye, which occurrence was
immediately immortalized by his black friends in a ditty, of which
the burden, chiefly English, was "Black-eye, black-eye," with
repetitions endless, the remainder being in their own language. I
remember once hearing some one say of modern fashionable songs,
"What <i>is</i> the use of saying the same thing so many times
over?" but these native troubadours far exceed the most echo-weary
of drawing-room ballads, for, as I conceive, the self-same reason,
a lamentable paucity of ideas.</p>

<p>Most of the natives are shrewd and clever mimics; one learned to
waltz very correctly in a few minutes; and the slightest
peculiarity of face or figure never escapes their observation, so
that in speaking of any person you know, although his name be not
mentioned, their accurate impersonation of his gait, expression of
countenance, or any oddity of manner, is so complete as to leave no
doubt of the identity. Their fondness for portions of European
clothing is well known, and I have heard of many amusing instances
of its display. One Wellington boot was sometimes worn,
unaccompanied by any other article of apparel, and great was the
pride and grandeur of him who could button his upper man in a
dress-coat, that alone being considered an ample costume. Other
garments were subjected to various modes of wearing, for which they
were never intended, legs being inserted where arms should be, and
<i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

<p>The gift of a brass medal, formerly a rare distinction, is now
made so frequently by settlers to natives who have served them well
in any way, that the honour of the badge is somewhat diminished;
but the pride with which the possessor wears and displays the
insignia of his order is most amusing. The "medal" consists of a
piece of brass in the form of a crescent, not much less than a
cheese-plate, engraven with the name and style of both owner and
donor, and worn hung round the neck by a brass chain.</p>

<p>Some of the native "attachés" to the establishments of settlers
become useful servants, and are comfortably attired in suitable
clothes, and their more than erect carriage (for a plumb-line
dropped from the top of the head would fell some inches behind the
heel) is still more striking in their civilized than savage
costume. These men often accompany their masters' drays to Sydney,
and sometimes join the long and toilsome stock-driving expeditions
across to Adelaide; but even after a sojourn of many months with
Europeans, and in a comparatively civilized state, they invariably
return to their old habits, and relinquish their smart and
comfortable clothes for the corrobbory costume of nudity and
pipe-clay.</p>

<p>The companionship of natives in the overland journeys above
alluded to might perhaps be supposed of service in preventing
injury or attacks from other natives, but this is far from being
the case. The whole of the aborigines, as hitherto known, maintain
most rigid laws touching all boundary questions, each tribe having
a certain allotted portion of country, beyond which they cannot
pass but in peril of their lives, or at least without risk of a
battle; and when, even in company with and under the protection of
their white masters, they traverse these forbidden climes, and meet
parties of the rightful inhabitants, the adventurous travellers
manifest the most intense fear, which, judging from the threatening
and angry aspect of their foes, is tolerably well grounded.</p>

<p>Neighbouring tribes are generally at war, some of the chief
causes being acts of trespass and abduction of women; but the
battles between them are less murderous than might be expected, all
being great bullies, and perpetually vaunting of their grand
resolves, and the numbers they mean to kill; whilst it often
happens, that after their spears and boomerangs have been flying
about for an hour or two, both armies quit the field with
undiminished numbers.</p>

<p>A tolerable idea of their "manners and customs" may be formed
from an occurrence which took place within Mr. Meredith's
knowledge. An intimation being given by a neighbouring tribe to
that settled near Goulburn, that they would kill a certain old man
among the latter, a council was held forthwith on the subject, and
means discussed how this indignity should be prevented; when, after
much deliberation, the elders and fighting men decided on a most
strange and horrible expedient, being that the old man's <i>own
son</i> should kill him then, and so deprive their foes of the
pleasure! The young man immediately rose, took two spears, and gave
his miserable old father his death-wound as he sat, unconscious of
any harm, by his fire, although it was some hours before he
expired; his son meanwhile tending him with the utmost care and
affection. After his death his son and the whole tribe mourned and
howled over him several days; and then, taking their weapons, they
set forth to go and kill as many as they could of the other tribe,
to avenge the death of the old man. They were very successful,
leaving several of their foes dead; but the police magistrate of
Goulburn, annoyed by their fightings, threatened them with
punishment, which caused them to set off in a large body, and well
armed, on a peaceful visit to the Bathurst tribe, who received them
with all honour and civility, and gave a grand corrobbory on the
occasion, inviting the strangers to see them dance. The Goulburns
accepted, but came armed with all their weapons; which Mr. Meredith
observing, he asked them why they came to a dance armed as if for
battle. They evaded the question some time, at length saying, "If
we keep our weapons, very well, all go right; if we come without,
directly they <i>jump up coolar</i>" (pick a quarrel, or get
angry). A greater proof of the habitual treachery of these people
could not be given than this distrust and suspicion of their own
countrymen. From all I have heard, I am very much inclined to think
my husband's maxim is the prudent one:&mdash;"Never trust a savage: you
may serve them, and they may serve you; but never give them the
chance of an advantage."</p>

Harebell&mdash;Convolvulus&mdash;Everlastings&mdash;Peppermint
Tree&mdash;Opossums&mdash;Natives' mode of taking them.</p>

<p>I HAVE often wondered that constant intercourse with Europeans,
and experience of the comfort afforded by a permanent and
substantial shelter from the inclemency of the seasons in the
variable climate of New South Wales, has not induced the natives to
make some rude attempt at building themselves huts, especially as
they are always very glad to enjoy the benefit of dwelling in those
of the settlers. But their idleness is wholly unconquerable; the
uttermost effort they ever make towards the formation of a
residence being to raise a few strips of bark slantingly against a
tree, under which they crawl during bad weather. Had not these
primitive erections been pointed out to me as "natives' huts," I
confess I should not have had an idea that they were anything more
than accidental heaps of bark.</p>

<p>One very wet miserable day a black was crowding in the warm
chimney-corner of a "squatter's" hut, where my husband was present,
and some of the party were asking the native why he was so idle and
stupid as to go shivering about without a home, when he might soon
build himself a warm hut. He listened very quietly to all they had
to say, merely observing at last, with the air of a man who has
arrived at a most philosophical conclusion:&mdash;"Ay, ay! White fellow
think it best that-a-way&mdash;Black fellow think it best
<i>that</i>-a-way." "Then black fellow's a fool for his pains," was
the uncourteous rejoinder. "I believe so," returned the sable
stoic, and straightway folding his blanket around him, walked
calmly out into the pouring rain.</p>

<p>A native one day was wistfully eyeing a snug pigsty, where the
fat grunting inmates were awaiting their supper, which was being
cracked in a mill by a convict servant; doubtless their idle and
obese condition must have seemed to him the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of
luxury, for he thus feelingly apostrophized the pigs: "Ay, ay,
budgeree fellow you! sit in gunyon all day&mdash;white fellow grind for
you!" (Ay, ay, you 're a lucky fellow, can lie in a house all day,
whilst a white man grinds for you!)</p>

<p>The word "gunyon," or house, they apply to everything that seems
appropriated to contain any article. My husband had a silver
pipe-case for the pocket, and they used to say his pyook had a
"gunyon all along of himself." A dog-kennel would be "gunyon 'long
of dingo," &amp;c.</p>

<p>To make them industrious is utterly hopeless; nothing but the
present urgent want of anything can induce them to make the
slightest exertion. If a man have one "fig"* of tobacco, and you
promise him another if he will do such or such a service, you must
wait until his stock in hand is exhausted, before there is a chance
of his trying to earn more, though they are always anxious enough
to beg for "Pyook, nyook, owrangey bit o' bacco" (A pipe, and a
knife, and a little bit of tobacco).</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Mr. Meredith tells me that the term "fig of tobacco," so
general here, will not be understood at home, where the same
description is not used. That kept here for general use is
"Negrohead," and comes in large kegs, packed closely in layers of
twisted rolls, about eight inches long, and one inch broad; each of
these being technically termed a "fig." Idle smokers employ their
servants to cut it up and rub it, ready for use.]</p>

<p>A small kind of crayfish frequent the Macquarie, called by the
natives "morally," and I was desirous of obtaining some, to see and
taste, but nothing short of an exorbitant bribe could induce the
blacks to procure any. They are generally expert fishermen, and in
their methods of capturing their prey, making snares, and other
occupations requiring patience and ingenuity, they show
considerable intelligence and perseverance, despite their inherent
idleness.</p>

<p>The contrivance adopted by a tribe on the Murray river for
catching ducks is particularly clever. They place nets (very
similar to those used by wild-duck trappers at home) over a narrow
portion of the river or "creek" which the ducks frequent, and then,
by chasing and frightening them at a distance, gradually drive the
birds near to the snare; the risk is then that they may fly over
it; to prevent which, the blacks fling up three-cornered pieces of
bark high into the air, at the same time accurately imitating the
cry of a hawk, and the poor ducks, stooping to escape the supposed
enemy, dart into the snare and are caught.</p>

<p>A very fine and excellent fish is often taken in the Macquarie,
called the cod, and though not really a species of cod, greatly
resembles that fish in its general shape and appearance, though far
more delicious in flavour. The Macquarie cod sometimes weighs
seventy pounds or more. The natives catch them with spears made
expressly for the purpose, in the use of which they are very
adroit. These fishing-spears are twelve or fourteen feet long, made
of hard wood, usually some kind of Eucalyptus, well sharpened at
the end, but not barbed in any way. The native thus armed crouches
or lies down on the overhanging bank of the river, or on a fallen
tree or old log over the water, intently and motionlessly watching
his prey. He then slowly and stealthily glides his spear down
towards the water; then dips it a little way, then pokes it farther
and farther, so softly as not to alarm the fish; and when quite
certain, with one thrust runs it through the unfortunate cod, and
brings him up.</p>

<p>The hunting or war spear is quite a different weapon to this,
made of the same kind of wood, but much shorter and thicker, about
seven or eight feet long, and barbed for some distance from the
point, either by notches cut in the wood, or with sharp fish-bones,
or crystals securely bound on with kangaroo sinews. These are most
savage-like and fearful weapons, and are thrown to a distance of
from seventy to one hundred yards, but rarely with certain effect
beyond sixty. A great additional impetus is gained by the manner in
which they are thrown. A piece of wood called a "wammara," about
two feet long, has a notch or socket made in its upper end, into
which the blunt end of the spear is inserted before throwing. The
wammara is held in a slanting position with the spear horizontally
resting <i>in</i> its upper end, and <i>on</i> the hand of the
spearman, who, in flinging it, suddenly gives the wammara a
perpendicular position, and adds greatly to the force of the
blow.</p>

<p>The "nullah-nullah" is another fighting weapon, made like the
others, of hard wood, with a round handle widening towards the end
into a broad knob, well sharpened on the lower side, like the edge
of an axe. They have also formidable clubs, for which I do not know
the native name.</p>

<p>The "boomerang" had become familiar, by name at least, in
England before I left, although the toys sold in shops as
boomerangs are very unlike the real ones, the use of which is
extremely curious and ingenious. This weapon consists of a very
slightly curved, nearly flat piece of hard wood, about two and a
half feet long, and two and a half inches wide; its curve, weight,
and the manner in which it is feathered off to catch the wind,
being most accurately calculated for it to take the intended
direction when thrown, different ones being adapted for different
aims. It is never aimed at the object intended to be struck, but
thus:&mdash;suppose A, B, and C form a triangle; a man at A throws the
boomerang towards B, to which point it flies, strikes the ground,
and, rebounding, turns towards C, where it strikes (like a good
"canon" at billiards). The accuracy with which the natives can hit
any object with this singular weapon, and the ingenious invention
of it, seem worthy of a higher order of intelligent beings than
they are usually considered. I have heard of several persons who
have practised throwing the boomerang, but none could succeed so as
to bear comparison with a native.</p>

<p>The word "waddie," though commonly applied to the weapons of the
New South Wales aborigines, does not with them mean any particular
implement, but is the term used to express wood of any kind, or
trees. "You maan waddie 'long of fire," means "Go and fetch
firewood."</p>

<p>The shields used by the natives are pieces of solid wood about
two feet long, something in a long diamond shape, with a loop or
handle to hold them by, hollowed from the inner side. These they
use with extreme adroitness, fending off blows in every direction,
which perhaps may partly account for the non-murderous character of
so many fierce encounters among themselves. I have heard some of
their white friends confess to having found an hour's "excellent
sport" in shying at them cobs of Indian corn, from which the grain
had been threshed, but which would still inflict rather a heavy
blow; not one of which ever hit the sable target, so nimbly did he
ward off every cob with his shield, from his legs just as surely as
his head, jumping about and grinning all the time in high glee.</p>

<p>I believe these are all the weapons used by the natives of their
own manufacture, and these were formerly all cut and made with
sharp flints or crystals; but now those acquainted with Europeans
procure more convenient tools. The women make neat baskets and bags
of the fine long dry grass common in these colonies (and which I
have often thought would make beautifully fine plait for hats or
bonnets); they use the currijong bark, too, for the same purpose,
and carry about with them in these bags a most strange and useless
accumulation of trash. They also sew the skins of kangaroos and
opossums together (with sinews for thread, and fish-bones for
needles), and fashion these into garments, rugs, or bags. Many of
them procure English needles and thread from the sutlers, and sew
with tolerable neatness.</p>

<p>In the Macquarie, near Bathurst, I first saw the superb green
frogs of Australia. The river, at the period of our visit, was for
the most part a dry bed, with small pools in the deeper holes, and
in these, among the few slimy water-plants and Confervae, dwelt
these gorgeous reptiles. In form and size they resemble a very
large common English frog; but their colour is more beautiful than
words can describe. I never saw plant or gem of so bright tints. A
vivid yellow-green seems the groundwork of the creature's array,
and this is daintily pencilled over with other shades, emerald,
olive, and blue greens, with a few delicate markings of bright
yellow, like an embroidery in threads of gold on shaded velvet. And
the creatures sit looking at you from their moist, floating bowers,
with their large eyes expressing the most perfect enjoyment, which,
if you doubt whilst they sit still, you cannot refuse to believe in
when you see them flop into the delicious cool water, and go slowly
stretching their long green legs, as they pass along the waving
grove of sedgy, feathery plants in the river's bed, and you lose
them under a dense mass of gently waving leaves; and to see this,
whilst a burning, broiling sun is scorching up your very life, and
the glare of the herbless earth dazzles your agonized eyes into
blindness, is almost enough to make one willing to forego all the
glories of humanity, and be changed into a frog!</p>

<p>In the same pools I found some fresh-water shells, chiefly
belonging to the species <i>Unio, Lymnaea, Stagnalis,</i> and
<i>Physa</i>, and, I think, identical with my English specimens.
The moramies, or crayfish, live in holes in the muddy banks of
these pools; I saw many of their deserted shelly coats, but not any
living ones.</p>

<p>That most enigmatical of all the strange animals found in
Australia, the Platypus, or <i>Ornithorhynchus paradoxus</i>, is
also a dweller in the Macquarie, but, being extremely shy, is not
often found near Bathurst. So many descriptions have been published
of it, that I imagine it is nearly as well understood in England as
here. A full-grown specimen is twelve or fourteen inches in length,
and much the same shape and proportion as the common mole, with a
very thick, soft fur, dark brown on the back, and light coloured
beneath; the head and eyes are perfectly <i>animal</i>, but in lieu
of a mouth or snout, a small flat bill, similar to that of a duck,
completes the very odd countenance of this most paradoxical
creature. The short furry legs end in half-webbed feet, the hind
ones being armed with sharp spurs, which are perforated, and
through which, when the animal is annoyed, it is believed to eject
a poisonous fluid as it strikes an enemy; but this fact is still
doubted by some naturalists, and, like other anomalous
peculiarities, is still the subject of argument amongst the
learned, to whose information I regret that it is not in my power
to add. The creature is very rarely seen on shore, and is usually
killed by being shot from a high bank; but this is only practicable
when it swims very near the surface.</p>

<p>Among the few living things that frequented the dreary desert
plains of Bathurst during my sojourn there, were some flocks of the
spur-winged plover; beautiful little birds, whose plaintive cry
seemed unceasingly to bewail the dreariness of the spot. It seemed
such a miserable place for birds&mdash;the gay creatures we love to
watch fluttering, and coquetting, and sporting about in the green
leafy trees&mdash;flying in and out&mdash;circling and soaring high into the
air, then darting back into a thick shady covert, where only the
light quivering of the leaves [which] their quick wings fan into
motion tells of their hiding-place! Here were neither bush nor
tree&mdash;nor branches dancing in the sunlight&mdash;nor deep clusters of
rich dark leaves&mdash;nothing but a scorching sky and a desert earth,
and the poor plover's sad, melancholy cry, instead of the full,
varied choir of airy voices that fills the heart with gladness on a
day in spring in green, beautiful old England!</p>

<p>Here and there, amidst the scanty and withered herbage, where
the flocks of miserable sheep were vainly trying to pick the
fraction of a feed, gleamed up an eye of blue, a bright blue starry
flower, looking fearlessly to the fervid sky from its slight and
hair-like stem; but its bolder aspect did not prevent my claiming a
loving acquaintance with it as a relative of an ancient friend in
my own dear land, the harebell. The Australian harebell
<i>(Campanula gracilis)</i> is scarcely a <i>bell</i> at
all&mdash;rather a star&mdash;the corolla being very deeply cleft, and widely
expanded; but it is as beautiful: yes, with all my life-long love
of the English one, I must acknowledge her antipodean cousin to be
even as beautiful as the "poet's harebell," that so merrily dances
and waves over British heaths and hills.</p>

<p>In the same barren spots, too, I found a likeness of another old
friend, the small meadow convolvulus, the new one being far
brighter in hue than the sly, mischievous little sprite that frisks
over our English fields, and baffles the sagacity of the neatest
farmer when he strives to exclude it. The garb of my new friend is
veritable <i>couleur de rose</i>, with scarcely a tint of yellow or
a gleam of white. The plants were very small and quite compact; the
flower growing on a short footstalk, which sprung direct from the
root, without any climbing stem. This excessive dwarfishness was
probably the consequence of the withering droughts, as in Van
Diemen's Land I often gather the same kind in streamers half a yard
long, or more; but they usually run along the ground, instead of
twining up a bent of grass or any other support.</p>

<p>During our few drives and rambles among the nearest hills, to
the north-west of Bathurst, I found some pretty everlastings,
<i>Gnaphalium apiculatum</i>, and others, with the names of which I
am unacquainted. Some of the white ones were large, and grew in
handsome clusters, with the soft central florets yellow; looking,
at a distance, not unlike the English ox-eye daisy. Others were
entirely yellow, and larger than the white ones, growing singly on
the stalk, and very handsome, showy flowers, but from their wide
open, staring look, always reminded me of those full-blown
representations of the sun, so much patronized by country
sign-painters. The dry, harsh, juiceless everlastings seemed
exactly the kind of growth we might expect to meet in such an arid,
parched region as this. They seem as if they could be quite
independent of droughts, hot winds, and every other destructive
agent of this withering climate, and thrive just as well, or
better, on a whirl of dust, than in a shower of rain. I began
almost to dislike them for daring to blossom and flaunt in such
bright array, when so many fairer and sweeter things were drooping
and dying all around.</p>

<p>Some of the hills we climbed (having driven across the weary
plains to their feet) had really very pretty spots among their
little glens and slopes, being well clothed with trees living and
growing; and as green as trees in New South Wales usually are,
chiefly consisting of the common acacias, and various kinds of gum,
or Eucalyptus, all very much resembling each other, except two
species, one of which, the "blue gum," bears large, broad, rather
blunt leaves, with a pale blue bloom upon them, which makes a
pleasing contrast to the dark olive-green tint of the commoner
kinds. The peppermint-tree <i>(Eucalyptus piperita)</i> is also a
very distinct species, and usually a handsome tree; I have seen
some old ones that an artist would delight to sketch. The bark is
often very various in colour, the smooth white portions being
overlaid in places with a thin coat partially peeled off, tinted
with light and dark grey, red, fawn-colour, and brown of many
shades, whilst towards the ground the rough, thicker, more orthodox
kind of bark generally remains. The foliage is denser and casts
more shade than any other gum-tree; the leaves are small and very
narrow, both sides alike (as are those of the whole family), and
thickly, yet lightly grouped on the spray; their colour also is
much brighter and greener than the other kinds, and when in flower,
the tree is often a dense mass of blossoms, sweet,
luscious-smelling, white-fringed little stars, with myriads of
birds fluttering and chirping about them, sucking the honey, and
showering down bunches that they pull off in sport and mischief.
The scent of the leaves when rubbed, and also their taste, which is
very pungent, is exactly similar to that of our English herb
peppermint, and I should think an essence might be distilled from
them, to serve for the use of both the druggist and confectioner.
The leaves are commonly supposed to form the chief food of the
opossum both in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land.</p>

<p>These beautiful animals live in hollow trees, and are rarely
visible by day, unless, as I have sometimes done, you can see one
sitting at his front door (as I suppose we may term the entrance to
his habitation), usually a hole far up the tree, whence they
descend at night to feed on grass and herbs, and may be seen
scampering and playing about like squirrels among the branches. The
marks left by their sharp claws in climbing trees are constantly
seen, and on the trunks of large old gums tracks of scratches are
visible in such numbers as to prove them very favourite places of
resort. A full-grown opossum is larger and heavier than a very
large cat, with a pretty innocent-looking face, the expression of
which is both like that of the deer and, the mouse, the shape of
the nose and whiskers strongly resembling the latter. The eyes are
very dark and brilliant, the ears soft and delicate, the legs short
and strong, with monkey-like feet and long sharp claws. They sit
up, holding their food in the fore-paws, like a monkey. The tail is
eighteen or twenty inches long, about the thickness at the base of
a sable boa, and tapering to the end; the under side is quite
smooth and devoid of hair, the upper being covered with the same
thick woolly fur as the other parts of the body, the colour being
either black, dark grey, dark brown, or deep golden brown, like
very yellow sable, but always beautifully shaded off from the sides
towards the under part, which is lighter.</p>

<p>These different colours are most probably also distinctions of
species, as no blending or mixture of them is ever observed, which
would very likely be the case if they were merely accidental
varieties in the same animal, just as we see the common colours of
the domestic cat mixed indiscriminately. The tail is strongly
prehensile, and holds so tightly, that they often swing their whole
weight upon it, and when shot dead, sometimes hang for a minute by
it, before falling. Fine moonlight nights often prove fatal to the
poor creatures, being the time chosen for shooting them by scores,
either for the sake of their warm skins for rugs, or to feed dogs
with their luckless bodies. Sometimes they commit sad ravages among
the young corn, and then the war waged against them has certainly a
fraction more of justice in it; but too often they are, like my
poor favourites the Cape pigeons, shot in mere wanton cruelty,
which, to gild its villainy, assumes the name of "sport." All dogs
pursue them to the death, and often in the day-time find one who
has either been too idle or unsuspecting to run up his tree, who,
unless he can instantly climb one, falls a victim to his
imprudence, though not without a most vigorous resistance of sharp
bites and scratches, and many a shrill and piercing squeal of
agony: as is the general course in the world, either among men or
brutes, might is victorious over right, and poor "possey" rarely
escapes. The noise they usually make at night, when undisturbed, is
something like a very hoarse laugh, a kind of grating
throat-chuckle; and on a still night many of them may be heard
calling to and answering each other for a considerable
distance.</p>

<p>Like all other animals of their class, they are marsupial, and
have rarely more than one young one at a time, which the doe
carries about with her, at first in the pouch, and afterwards on
her back.</p>

<p>The blacks procure opossums by climbing trees where their holes
are, and have evidently some means of ascertaining whether the
animal is turned with its head or tail towards them, before
touching it; if the former, they frighten him, or by some means
induce him to turn round, when, instantly seizing the tail, they
forcibly drag him out. If the hole extends too far for them to
reach their prey, they cut a larger hole with an axe or
tomahawk.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Formerly these implements were made of flint
or crystal, but now the natives procure English ones.<br>
<br>
My omitting all allusion to the kangaroo may be deemed an
oversight, but the reason I do not describe them here, is, that I
did not see one in New South Wales, nor has Mr. Meredith, in all
his wanderings there, met with more than half a dozen. So
effectually is the race being exterminated. In Van Diemen's Land
they are much more abundant.]</p>

<p>They often show great brutality in torturing the unfortunate
animals they take, long before putting an end to their wretched
sufferings. Mr. Meredith on one occasion remonstrated with a black
who was cruelly and inhumanly maiming one of these poor harmless
creatures, but the only reply the savage made was by a broad grin,
and the cool remark, "Bel 'possum cry!"&mdash;(Opossum don't cry!) The
natives, like most savages, are very agile in climbing trees,
making small notches in the bark as they ascend, just large enough
to rest the end of the great toe upon, which member seems in them
particularly strong, for even in riding on horseback, which many of
them do, well and fearlessly, they never put the flat foot in the
stirrup, but only lay hold of it with the great toe.</p>

<p>Emus and native turkeys are not now seen near Bathurst, although
still very numerous in the less populous districts. The bush-turkey
is about the same size as a tame one; the colour dark brown, with
light grey feathers on the breast, and full plumage on the head and
neck. They are very shy and, being excellent eating, are much
sought after by both Europeans and natives. On foot it is all but
impossible to approach within gunshot of them, as they take wing on
the least alarm; but they will allow persons on horseback, or in a
vehicle of any kind, to come close to them, and by such means they
are usually taken.</p>

<p>A most extraordinary account is given by Mr. Gould and other
naturalists of the manner in which these birds provide for the
artificial hatching of their young, by scratching together a great
heap of vegetable matter, in which the females lay their eggs, and
leave them, trusting to the heat which the mass acquires during
fermentation, to bring out the brood. This, if true of any
Australian bird, is certainly a mistake as regards the turkey,
which frequents the wide, open plains of the interior, and forms
scarcely any nest, but in some accidental hollow lays several
bluish-spotted eggs, which afterwards become much darker in colour,
and are hatched in the usual manner. Were the birds to form so
large and conspicuous a receptacle for their eggs as I have seen
described, namely, a mound of rubbish thirty feet round, and eight
or ten high, none would escape discovery, and as both eggs and
birds are valued as food, the race would ere this be totally
extinct. I never had an opportunity of seeing the nest of a
bush-turkey, and therefore my account is but the transcript of what
I have been told; but of my informant's veracity and knowledge I
cannot entertain a doubt.</p>

<p>One staple article of consumption, both with emus and turkeys,
is the berry of the low-creeping prickly plant called the native
cranberry <i>(Astrohma humifusum)</i>, which is so very hard that I
should think their digestive organs must be akin to those of the
ostrich. This semblance of a fruit is about the size of a currant,
and with its peach-like bloom looks rather tempting, but a marble
covered with thin kid would best represent its flavour and
consistence. I remember the shock of disappointment I received on
attempting to taste some on a hot thirsty day, and have never since
deprived the emus of a single berry. The blossom is very pretty,
not unlike a small fuchsia, growing abundantly on the under-side of
the trailing sprays, and not often noticeable until a piece is
gathered, so closely they lie on the ground.</p>

<p>After a sojourn at Bathurst of about a month, we set forth on
our return to Sydney, and the summer being more advanced and the
heat much greater, the weariness and discomfort of the journey were
increased tenfold. The mountains were just as dreary as when we
crossed them in coming; the roads not quite so bad, the great holes
and reservoirs of mud in them being a little dried up, and the
really dry portions rising in continuous volumes of dust.</p>

<p>Equally annoying with the dust was the loud, incessant, and
indescribable noise of myriads of large and curious winged insects,
commonly and incorrectly called locusts, but which are totally
different from any kind of locusts I ever saw either represented in
books or in collections. They literally swarm in the summer time on
the gum-trees, and are seen flying about in immense numbers; the
noise they make when on the wing being a loud hum or buzz, not
nearly so disagreeable as their note when settled on a tree, which
most closely resembles the sound of a miniature watchman's rattle;
and when this is multiplied by thousands and millions of these
noisy creatures, the din is intolerable. A stocking or lace
manufatory is not more distressing to a person unaccustomed to the
rattling and riot of the machinery. Whilst we rested one day, a
couple of the locusts were caught, and I no longer wondered so much
at their loud notes, for they are powerful-looking creatures,
something the form of an enormous fly, with stout brown bodies two
inches long, six rough legs, a squarely shaped head like a
grasshopper's, half an inch or more in breadth, with large
prominent black eyes, and a long proboscis, which when at rest lies
very compactly under the chin. (I must pray entomologists to
forgive my unscientific descriptions, as I am unacquainted with
their technical phraseology.) On the front of the head are some
jewel-like markings of yellow and red; the wings are very large,
and as transparent as glass, traversed by some very strong and many
finer fibres in a beautiful net-work. Altogether they are very
handsome and most harmless-looking insects, and I liberated those
caught for me, as soon as I had well examined them.</p>

<p>Since leaving New South Wales, I have become rather better
acquainted with the locusts, as a species but slightly different
inhabits Van Diemen's Land. These are somewhat smaller, with
coral-red eyes, instead of black ones, and of a blacker colour
generally. They frequent certain kinds of Eucalyptus in countless
numbers, but only in particular localities; we sometimes drive
several miles without hearing one, and then suddenly find ourselves
in the midst of a whole swarm.</p>

<p>In both Colonies a kind of manna is found upon and lying beneath
the trees chosen by the locusts, in snow-white flakes, sometimes
soft, and often nearly as hard as a sugar-plum, with a sweet and
rather pleasant flavour; its medicinal properties being the same as
those of the manna sold by druggists. Children are very fond of it,
but I have never seen it in any quantity.</p>

<p>I have heard very many discussions as to the origin of this
manna and its connexion with the locusts, some persons believing
that the insects made it, as bees make honey, others that it was a
natural exudation from the tree, which attracted the locusts to
feed on it. But since I have had opportunities of observing the
matter more attentively, I have been convinced that neither of
these is the true solution of the mystery, but that the following
explanation, given me by our worthy medical attendant here (Van
Diemen's Land), Dr. Storey, is the true one.</p>

<p>Beneath the outer bark of some gum-trees is a sweet kind of
mucilage, free from the very strong aromatic flavour which pervades
the rest of the tree; and the locusts, perforating the outer bark
with their long, sharp proboscis, suck out the juice, which
continues to flow for a short time after they leave the aperture,
and drying in the sun, falls to the ground in flakes of manna.</p>

<p>I have had many corroborative proofs of this fact and, before
knowing it, had often vainly endeavoured to conjecture what the
locusts could be doing, when I saw them covering the smooth stem of
a tree for many yards, and the greater portion of them
motionless.</p>

<p>They evidently pass through one, if not more stages of
existence, preparatory to their becoming perfect winged insects. In
the summer, towards evening, it is common to see on the trunks of
trees, reeds, or any upright thing, a heavy-looking, hump-backed,
brown beetle, an inch and a half long, with a scaly coat; clawed,
lobster-like legs, and a somewhat dirty aspect, which is easily
accounted for, when at the foot of the tree a little hole is
visible in the turf, whence he has lately crept. I have sometimes
carefully carried these home, and watched with great interest the
poor locust "shuffle off" his mortal, or rather earthy coil, and
emerge into a new world. The first symptom is the opening of a
small slit which appears in the back of his coat, between the
shoulders, through which, as it slowly gapes wider, a pale, soft,
silky-looking texture is seen below, throbbing and heaving
backwards and forwards. Presently, a fine square head, with two
light red eyes, has disengaged itself, and in process of time (for
the transformation goes on almost imperceptibly) this is followed
by the liberation of a portly body and a conclusion; after which
the brown leggings are pulled off like boots, and a pale,
cream-coloured, weak, soft creature very slowly and very tenderly
walks away from his former self, which remains standing entire,
like the coat of mail of a warrior of old, ready to be encased in
the cabinets of the curious; the shelly plates of the eyes that are
gone, looking after their lost contents with a sad lack of
"speculation" in them. On the back of the new-born creature lie two
small bits of membrane doubled and crumpled up in a thousand
puckers, like a Limerick glove in a walnut-shell. These begin to
unfold themselves, and gradually spread smoothly out into two
large, beautiful, opal-coloured wings, which by the following
morning have become clearly transparent, whilst the body has
acquired its proper hard consistency and dark colour; and when
placed on a gum-tree, the happy thing soon begins its whirring,
creaking, chirruping song, which continues, with little
intermission, as long as its happy harmless life.</p>

<p>When the locusts happen to come out in the morning, the heat of
the sun often dries their unopened wings so suddenly that they
cannot expand, and thus, quite helpless, the poor things become a
prey to the numerous birds and swarms of ants that are always ready
to attack and devour them.</p>

<p>What state the locust passes through previously to its existence
as an underground beetle, I am not aware; but in newly-ploughed
peat land* great numbers of fat, white, inactive caterpillars or
grubs are constantly found, some of which, judging from their size
and shape, are probably locusts in their first state of being. I
find these grubs some inches below the surface, coiled round in
little cells exactly their own shape and size, hollowed in the
moist ground, whence they apparently derive their sustenance. When
disturbed, they slowly crawl under another piece of earth, where
they soon form a new cell, similar to the old one.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* In Van Diemen's Land.]</p>

<p>Another locust, resembling the one I have described, in every
respect except size, is perhaps the male insect, the body being
much slighter in proportion, and not exceeding an inch in length.
The circumstance of these two sizes in the locusts exactly
corresponding with those of two kinds of the ground-grubs, induces
me to think that the latter are locusts in their first or lowest
form; but my opinions, being formed solely from observation,
without that aid which a previous knowledge of entomology would
afford me, may very probably be erroneous. The cruelties which all
persons learned in that science are perpetually guilty of and, as
it seems, irresistibly tempted to commit, always rendered it
abhorrent to me, and consequently I am now nearly if not wholly
useless as an observer of my interesting neighbours of the insect
kingdom in this populous region; but lest my modest fear of telling
what is already known should by any possibility nip some wondrous
discovery in the bud, I simply detail my small sums of knowledge,
only regretting that the total amount is not greater.</p>

<p>As we journeyed on, we found it convenient to rest one night at
the Rivulet Inn (the scene of such bacchanalian orgies during our
up-journey). The inmates were certainly not <i>so</i> tipsy, and
more of them were visible than before; but as to
<i>cleanliness</i>, the word and the meaning seemed equally unknown
within, though the paint outside was as bright as ever, reminding
one so much of a newly-furbished-up caravan at a country fair, that
I almost expected to see a picture of a giant and dwarf in the
veranda, or to hear a great drum. On our retiring for the night (in
company with a dark-brown fat candle that smelt most insufferably
ill, as it fizzled and flared by turns) to a freshly painted room
with very scanty furniture, and a most sombre coloured,
hide-the-dirt kind of bed, I instituted an examination into the
state of the linen, and believe that half a dozen unwashed
chimney-sweeps occupying the same bed for a fortnight could not
have left evidences of a darker hue than presented themselves to my
horror-stricken eyes. The blankets corresponded well in colour, but
as to exchange those was totally hopeless, we dispensed with their
services, and after great difficulty, and most eloquent grumbling
from the rum-inspired landlady, I obtained some coarse cotton
sheets (linen ones being rarely seen in the Colony), the dampness
of which was satisfactory, as it proved they had been acquainted
with the wash-tub.</p>

<p>Thrusting the other sable and not inodorous coverings into the
farthest corner of the room, I washed my hands, and re-arranged the
bed, and had begun to think of sleep, when a loud knocking at the
door aroused us&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who's there?"</p>

<p>"If you please, ma'am. Missus wants them sheets you pulled off
your bed, for a gentleman as is just come in!"</p>

<p>With my parasol I poked the things out on the landing, inly
congratulating the happy man destined to enjoy such sweet repose;
but I could not help thinking, at the same time, how many pairs of
sheets might have been bought with the money the household were
drinking at our previous visit; or even that a white-washed house
<i>with</i> clean linen would have been preferable to gilding and
rainbow paintings without that humble luxury.</p>

<p>The beauty of the vale of Clwydd had become much enhanced during
the interval of our visits by the blossoming of the young
gum-trees, and the greater degree of verdure generally perceptible.
I gathered many flowers by the road-side that were quite new to me,
including several orchideous plants, and a bright rich blue flower,
with gold and black stamens, growing on a straggling branched stem
from out a large tuft of tall reedy leaves. I named it then the
"Knight of the Garter," and have often met it since in both
Colonies.</p>

<p>Mount Victoria, too, towered above far greener glens and ravines
than when we had crossed the pass before; but once again amidst the
forests of those dreary, black Blue Mountains, and all improvement
was at an end. Burned trees, bare ground, and interminable hills
once more surrounded us; the scorching heat of the sun was to me
almost overpowering, and, reflected as it was by the dusty,
shadeless road into our faces and eyes, became absolutely painful.
Still the time and the journey wore on, and we reached the
Weatherboard inn, then wholly at our service, and where an ever
memorable luxury awaited us, in the shape of a capacious dish of
young potatoes at tea, being the first vegetables we had seen for
some time. Here we also found a clean bed, though the possession
thereof seemed a point of dispute with its numerous tenantry; but
this is an almost universal evil in New South Wales, and in wooden
houses like the one in question is, I believe, incurable. A
tolerably neat and productive garden adjoined the house, and
everything about bore an air of more comfort than the generality of
such places in the Colony.</p>

<p>After an early breakfast the following morning, we set forth on
foot to visit a waterfall. Entering a little valley with low hills
on either side, we soon reached the borders of a bright brook,
that, as it gurgled and glittered over its rocky bed, spoke to me
of many a lovely valley and verdant meadow at home, where, instead
of being, as here, precious as a fount in the desert, such a stream
would be but one among the thousands that gladden the teeming
earth. After our dry and parching journey, it was delightful to
walk close beside it&mdash;to be quite sure that it <i>was</i>
water&mdash;and when wetted feet did not suffice, to stoop and dabble in
it&mdash;and scoop it up in tightly-clasped hands to drink&mdash;and to step
over on its large dry stones, with no very great objection to a
splash if one's foot slipped. All the valley was <i>green</i>
too,&mdash;think of that! And how exquisitely refreshing such moist
greenness was to our dust-blinded eyes! Tall rushes grew there, and
half-immersed water-plants, from amidst which we heard the sonorous
"clop, clop" of the great green frogs; and bright dragon-flies
darted about among the high waving reeds; and there were gay
flowering shrubs with pleasant odours, and the delicate "fringed
violet," a gem worthy to grace Titania's rarest crown. It is an
humble lowly flower, about the size of a violet, growing alone on a
thin transparent stem some two or three inches high, of a deep
bluish lilac rather than purple, and somewhat the shape of the
iris, having also the same peculiar lustre, so well described by my
poet-friend Mary Howitt&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">"As if grains of gold in its petals were set."</p>

<p>The sepals of the flower are edged with the finest fringe, like
that which adorns our English bog-bean. It fades so very soon after
being gathered, that I could not even carry one alive to the inn,
and never meeting with it again, had no opportunity of sketching
it.</p>

<p>As we walked on, a group of slender young gum-trees attracted my
attention by their very graceful forms and polished verdure; and
when opposite to them, we saw, as through a purposed entrance, that
they formed a nearly circular bower, beneath whose leafy canopy
dwelt a sisterhood of queens&mdash;a group of eight or ten splendid
waratahs, straight as arrows&mdash;tall, stately, regal flowers, that
with their rich and glowing hue,</p>

<p class="poem">"Making a sunshine in the shady place,"</p>

<p>seemed like the magic jewels we read of in fairy-tales, that
light up caverns by their own intrinsic lustre.</p>

<p>It would have seemed a small sort of sacrilege to disturb this
beautiful picture, this temple of the mountain nymphs; so I
contented myself with gathering some less fine flowers of the
waratah that grew near, and we pursued our way still along the
green little valley, and close beside the streamlet, which, as we
advanced, flowed much more swiftly, and a sound of pouring water
reached us, the cause of which was soon explained by one of the
most stupendous scenes I ever beheld, bursting unexpectedly upon
us.</p>

<p>Suddenly we found ourselves standing on the brink of a
tremendous precipice; for though I have spoken of traversing a
<i>valley</i>, be it remembered that this was on one of the highest
parts of the Blue Mountains, and the valley itself merely a
watercourse. I know not how to describe the scene without a
comparatively insignificant simile, namely, a theatre, but
supposing a space of three or four miles between the centre of the
audience-portion and the back of the stage, with a proportionate
width. We stood, as it were, in the front of the gallery, which was
the summit of a colossal amphitheatre of precipitous and most
picturesque cliffs, rising in many places above the point where we
stood, and in others broken by rugged ravines, fantastically
adorned with trees, that seemed to hold on, like the natives, by a
great toe only. At a depth of some hundreds of feet below us lay a
thickly wooded undulating vale, a billowy ocean of verdant foliage,
stretching far away, and rising again in the distance, until
bounded by a towering wall of rocks, their sharp outlines telling
in strongly marked light and shade against the clear, deep blue
sky.</p>

<p>On our left hand, the bright waters of the mountain stream
poured over the rocks in one smooth, glassy, unbroken torrent for
some distance, and then, scattered by projecting crags into smaller
jets, were lost to view amidst the overhanging trees that fringed
the sides of this natural Colosseum.</p>

<p>That portion of the rock near us seemed certainly of an igneous
origin, and some more distant parts had much the aspect of basalt,
being apparently columnar. Some of the small fragments I picked up
had a beautifully crystalline structure, and glittered like
"ruby-blende."</p>

<p>I much regretted the impossibility of remaining to have a day or
two's exploration about this grand and interesting spot. I should
have liked to visit the foot of the cliffs as well as the brow, but
this would have incurred a circuit of many miles, and too much
fatigue for me to dream of; and with excessive reluctance I
retraced my steps to the "Weatherboard," whence we immediately
started on our onward journey.</p>

<p>Near the inn we saw some lories, the most brilliant of all the
parrot tribe; the back and upper portion of the body being a bright
gleaming blue, whilst the breast and under parts are the most
intense rose-colour, or <i>ponceau</i>. Gay as were all the parrots
I had previously seen, I gazed on these in sheer wonder, scarcely
believing they could be <i>real</i>, as they rose in a flock from
the road before us and flew past, brightening the very sunshine
with their glorious colours.</p>

Parramatta&mdash;Steamboat&mdash;Scenery on the "River"&mdash;Sydney Christmas
Tree&mdash;Christmas Day&mdash;Tippling Servants.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we encountered a storm of lightning, thunder,
and rain, just before reaching Lapstone Hill, and whilst we wound
down it we enjoyed as perfect a picture of a landscape as ever eye
beheld. How I wished, and wished in vain, for some rare artist to
see it with us!&mdash;and fancied the versions of its beauty that
Constable, Creswick, Copley Fielding, Cox, or Turner might give to
an admiring world. I have before endeavoured to describe Lapstone
Hill (Chapter VII.): but if beautiful then, how much more so was it
now,&mdash;with tall and graceful gum-trees loaded with their white and
honied blossoms, lifting up their garlanded heads from the deep
ravine,&mdash;amidst groups of the delicate, feathery-leaved acacia,
whose countless clusters of pale-golden, hawthorn-scented flowers
were bending with the heavy rain-drops, that glittered and sparkled
like diamonds on the shrubs, trees, and deep-crimson waratahs on
the rocks above us! Before us lay the green Emu Plains, the broad
Nepean, and town of Penrith; the view being bounded on either side
by the rocky gorge through which we looked. One half of the sky was
black as night, with the yet unspent wrath of the thunder-clouds,
whose artillery still reverberated grandly amongst the mountains;
the other half of the Janus-faced heaven was blue, and bright with
sunshine: and over both, like a beautiful spirit of concord,
blessing alike the darkness and the light, beamed a most brilliant
rainbow. The whole scene was so indelibly painted on my mind, I can
fancy now that I see each individual rock and tree that helped to
make up the beautiful whole.</p>

<p>Crossing the Nepean as before, in the punt, we took up our
quarters again at the Ferry Inn, and early the next day continued
our journey. Seeing a tolerably large house by the roadside, with
stacks, cows, pigs, and other farm-like things about, and a tall
sign-post, or what appeared such, in front, we alighted, to see if
we could procure a glass of milk, and entered a room, evidently in
the "public" line of business, smelling dreadfully of rum and
tobacco, and garnished with pipe-ashes, dirty glasses, and empty
bottles in abundance. A continuance of loud knocking brought a
stupid, dirty, half-dressed, slipshod woman from an inner room, in
which, as she left the door open, I could see several messy, unmade
beds, soiled clothes all about the floor, and three or four more
women of different ages, and of as unpleasing aspect as the one who
had obeyed my summons, and who, after some delay, brought me a jug
of nice sweet milk, and a dirty glass to pour it into; seeming to
me as if she had ably assisted in the bottle-emptying of the
preceding evening. This universal addiction to drink, and the
consequent neglect of all industry and decency, are truly shocking.
Here was a substantial farm-house (sometimes performing in another
character, it is true), with the female inmates half-drunk and
scarcely out of bed at ten o'clock on a summer's morning, rooms
unswept, beds unmade, and the whole establishment telling of
plenty, sloth, and drunkenness.</p>

<p>We reached Parramatta about noon, and remained, in luxurious
idleness, at the pretty inn I had so much liked on our previous
visit, for a day or two, until lodgings were prepared for us in
Sydney. We then embarked in a steamboat named the <i>Rapid</i> or
the <i>Velocity</i>, or some like promising title, on the
Parramatta river (<i>alias</i> Port Jackson), and moved away from
the wharf at a most funereal pace, which I for some time accounted
for by supposing that other passengers were expected alongside, but
at length found, to my dismay, that it was the best speed with
which this renowned vessel could travel without fear of an
explosion. One advantage it gave us was a good and deliberate view
of the scenery on either side; a moderately quick draughtsman might
have drawn a panorama of it as we slowly puffed along.</p>

<p>Some of the cottages and villas on the banks are very prettily
situated, with fine plantations, gardens, and orange-groves around
them, and nice pleasure-boats moored beside mossy stone steps
leading to the river. As we neared Sydney the banks became much
more rocky and picturesque, skirted and crowned with pretty native
shrubs, with here and there a fantastic group of crags, like a
little fort or castle, perched among them.</p>

<p>The animation of the scene in the harbour, the numerous vessels
at anchor, and the busy little boats plying in every direction,
gave by no means unpleasing evidence of our return to the
Australian metropolis. Viewed from any point, Sydney cannot fail to
strike a thinking mind with wonder and admiration, as being the
creation of so comparatively brief a space. A large and well-built
town, abounding with all the expensive luxuries of civilized
life&mdash;streams of gay equipages and equestrians traversing the wide
and handsome streets&mdash;throngs of busy merchants, whose costly and
innumerable goods are being landed from whole fleets of noble ships
that bring hither treasures from all climes&mdash;all this, and
more&mdash;where, but a few years ago, the lonely native caught, and eat
his opossum, or paddled his tiny canoe across the almost matchless
harbour!</p>

<p>Not without strong misgivings as to the equity of such
appropriations generally, do I make these remarks; but, in the
cruel annals of colonization, I believe that of New South Wales to
be the least objectionable. For the most part it has been
peacefully effected, and the great disproportion of the scanty
aboriginal population to the vast extent of habitable country still
leaves a superfluous abundance to the natives, of both land and
sustenance. Unlike the nobler and far more abused natives of New
Zealand, they attach themselves to no particular spot, but within a
certain wide boundary, which separates them from other aboriginal
tribes, they wander about, without attachment or interest in one
portion of country more than another, so that they can find
abundance of food, the vicinity of Europeans' residences being
sought and preferred for that reason.</p>

<p>We now made a few weeks' sojourn in Sydney, which, could we have
laid the dust, moderated the heat, and dismissed the mosquitoes and
their assistants, would have been very pleasant; but as it was, my
colonial enjoyments were limited to our usual drives, and when able
to walk at all, an idle, languid stroll in the beautiful Government
gardens. For some days before Christmas, in our drives near the
town, we used to meet numbers of persons carrying bundles of a
beautiful native shrub, to decorate the houses, in the same maimer
that we use holly and evergreens at home. Men, women, and children,
white, brown, and black, were in the trade; and sometimes a horse
approached, so covered with the bowery load he bore, that only his
legs were visible, and led by a man nearly as much hidden; carts
heaped up with the green and blossomed boughs came noddingly along,
with children running beside them, decked out with sprays and
garlands, laughing and shouting in proper Christmas jollity. I
liked to see this attempt at the perpetuation of some of our
ancient homely poetry of life, in this new and generally too
prosaic Colony, where the cabilistic letters £. s. d. and RUM
appear too frequently the alphabet of existence. It seemed like a
good healthy memory of <i>home</i>; and I doubt not the decked-out
windows and bouquet-filled chimney in many a tradesman's house gave
a more home-like flavour to his beef or turkey, and aided in the
remembrance of old days and old friends alike numbered with the
past.</p>

<p>The shrub chosen as the Sydney "Christmas" is well worthy of the
honour (the rough usage it receives rendering the quality of the
post it occupies rather problematical, by the way). It is a
handsome verdant shrub, growing from two to twelve or fifteen feet
high, with leaves in shape like those of the horse-chestnut, but
only two or three inches broad, with a dark green, polished, upper
surface, the under one being pale. The flowers, which are
irregularly star-shaped, come out in light terminal sprays, their
chief peculiarity being, that they completely open whilst quite
small, and of a greenish white colour; they then continue
increasing in size, and gradually ripening in tint, becoming first
a pearl white, then palest blush, then pink, rose-colour, and
crimson: the constant change taking place in them, and the presence
of all these hues at one time on a spray of half a dozen flowers,
has a singularly pretty appearance. Their scent when freshly
gathered is like that of new-mown hay. Great quantities of the
shrubs grow in the neighbourhood of Sydney, or I should fear that
such wholesale demolition as I witnessed would soon render them
rare.</p>

<p>The "Christmas dinner" truly seemed to me a most odd and
anomalous affair. Instead of having won a seasonable appetite by a
brisk walk over the crisped snow, well muffled in warm winter
garments, I had passed the miserable morning, half-dead with heat,
on the sofa, attired in the coolest muslin dress I possessed,
sipping lemonade or soda-water, and endeavouring to remember all
the enviable times when I had touched a lump of ice or grasped a
snowball, and vainly watching the still, unruffled curtains of the
open window for the first symptom of the afternoon sea-breeze.</p>

<p>I have heard persons who have lived for years in India say that
they found the climate of Sydney by far the most oppressive; and I
partly account for this by the better adaptation of Indian
habitations to the heat, and their various contrivances for relief,
which English people, choosing to build English houses in an
un-English climate, never dream of providing. The only cool
arrangement generally adopted is the substitution of an oiled cloth
or matting for a carpet on sitting-room floors; some of the
mattings are fine and rather pretty-looking, but the oiled cloth
has always a kind of hair-dresser's-shop look about it, which not
the most elegant furniture of every other description could
reconcile to my old-world prejudices; and the noise which the
softest step makes upon it is always unpleasant.</p>

<p>The prevailing vice of drunkenness among the lower orders is
perhaps more resolutely practised at this season than any other. I
have heard of a Christmas-day party being assembled, and awaiting
the announcement of dinner as long as patience would endure; then
ringing the bell, but without reply; and on the hostess proceeding
to the kitchen, finding every servant either gone out or rendered
incapable of moving, the intended feast being meanwhile burned to
ashes. Nor is this by any means a rare occurrence; as the crowded
police-office can bear ample testimony.</p>

<p>In January, 1840, we removed to "Homebush," an estate within
eleven miles of Sydney, on the Parramatta river, where we proposed
residing for a year or two; and rendered the ill-arranged and
dilapidated old house a tolerably comfortable home. It contained
two good rooms and five smaller ones; the veranda in front was one
hundred feet long, by twelve in width, and was carried round the
ends of the house in the same proportion, the whole neatly flagged;
at the back, the line was broken by the two wings, leaving a
shorter veranda in the centre, with the garden (or rather
wilderness) before it, commanding a beautiful view of the river (a
creek of which ran up towards the house), the opposite shores, and
several wooded jutting points on our own side.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* On one of these was a school for young
ladies, and any one addressing the principal by letter would be
somewhat amused at the very alarmingly soft nature of the
superscription, which would run thus:<br>
"Mrs. Love,<br>
Harmony House,<br>
Concord,<br>
Near Kissing Point!"]</p>

<p>Homebush was a fair specimen of a New South Wales settler's
residence, possessing many of the Colonial peculiarities. The house
stood on the highest ground in the estate, and for some hundreds of
acres all around not a native tree nor even a stump was visible, so
completely had the land been cleared, although not worth
cultivation. This desert bareness was a little relieved close to
the house, by three magnificent Norfolk Island pines, which towered
far above the roof; and by the then broken and ruined fruit-trees
of what had been two very large orchards, which were formerly well
stocked with mulberry, plum, cherry, pear, apple, peach, orange,
and loquat trees, but at the time of our taking the place, after
its being vacant some years (or only occupied by a drunken
overseer), the cattle had free ingress through the broken fences,
and the fine orchards were utterly destroyed.</p>

<p>A curving road, nearly half a mile long, and some twenty yards
wide, with a good four-rail fence on either side, led from the
entrance gate, on the public road, to the house, and this, being
unadorned by a single tree, was, according to a Colonial stretch of
courtesy, termed the "Avenue;" much to my mystification, when, on
inquiring for Mr. Meredith one day, a servant told me, "Master had
just gone down the 'aveny.'" I pondered this announcement some
moments, and not being able to recollect any thing of the kind near
the place (for I confess my thoughts were wandering in search of
some gum-tree likeness of the stately aisles of elms and limes that
I loved so well at home), I was compelled to inquire where this
"<i>terra incognita</i>" lay; and having once discovered that we
<i>had</i> an "avenue," I never failed to remember its style and
title.</p>

<p>Proceeding, then, along the avenue towards the house, a stranger
might be apt to fancy he had entered at a wrong gate, for he would
find himself led into the midst of all the farm-buildings;
stock-yards, cow-sheds, barn, stable, and piggeries ranging on his
left hand, whilst huts for the farm servants lay on his right; and
in front, commanding a full view of all these ornamental edifices,
the hall door of the house! Such being the almost universal
arrangement in the Colony; and, as compared with many other
settlers' houses, this was rather aristocratic. Why the approach to
a farm-house here should be so much more dirty, unpleasant, and
intrusive than in England, I know not; but certain it is that in
visiting a colonist you are generally obliged to inspect every
other portion of the establishment before you can reach the
apartments of the family.</p>

<p>Another universal inconvenience is, that you never see a
<i>gate</i>, or so rarely as only to be the exception to the rule.
"Slip-rails" are the substitute; five or six heavy long poles
loosely inserted in sockets made in two upright posts. They may be
stepped over by a horse if only lowered at one end, but to allow
any vehicle to enter, each one has to be lifted out and put aside;
and it often happens that four or five of these troublesome and
slovenly contrivances occur in the approach to one house, with the
invariable additional charm (in winter) of a deep squashy pool of
mud around each one; yet, most probably, when you do gain your
destination, if a dinner-party be the occasion, you find a table
spread with abundance of plate, glass, damask, and costly viands,
and a profusion of expensive wines. Such inconsistencies
perpetually struck me, showing the general preference for glitter
and show, rather than sterling English comfort. A settler will
perhaps keep two or three carriages, and furnish his house in a
costly style, yet grudge the labour of a carpenter to convert some
of the useless wood around him into gates for his farm and grounds.
Homebush did possess a gate, but, as was requisite, to be in proper
Colonial "keeping," one half was off its hinges, and the
companion-moiety never consented to open unless it was lifted;
therefore, on the whole, it was remarkably convenient.</p>

<p>During nearly the whole time of our residence here the public
road near us was infested by a gang of bush-rangers, or rather
footpads, who committed many robberies on persons travelling past;
but although we and our servants constantly traversed the dreaded
road, we were never molested. Possibly the shelter and concealment
they very probably found in some of the dense scrubs and thickets
which skirted part of our ground near the scene of their exploits,
induced them to adopt the fox's policy, who rarely "robs near his
own den;" but the constant depredations we heard of rendered our
drives far less pleasant to me, although a double-barrelled gun
usually accompanied us. One day we met the clergyman of Cook's
River,* who, on his way to dine with the Governor at Parramatta,
had been stopped by three of the party, who took his money and a
very valuable watch. He had directly ridden to the nearest
public-house, not a quarter of a mile off, and, with some of the
inmates and an old musket, had diligently scoured the bush in
pursuit, but without again seeing the gang, who within an hour
robbed some persons in another road. They one day took from a poor
woman even her wedding-ring, and for several months continued the
same practices on this, the most frequented public road near
Sydney, almost without an attempt being made for their capture; for
so constantly were they "at work," that had the police been
desirous of taking them, they could not have failed. In the case of
the more formidable gangs of bush-rangers, who by their outrages
often become the terror of a wide rural district, the "mounted
police" is an excellent and efficient force. It consists of picked
and well-paid volunteers from the regiments in the Colony, and the
officers are generally brave and intelligent young men, who, when
they look for a bush-ranger, generally <i>find</i> him; two terms
by no means synonymous among the constabulary.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Cook's <i>River</i> is an arm of the
<i>sea</i>, running inland from Botany Bay, and on its banks are
many pleasant residences, and the prettiest church in the
Colony.]</p>

<p>During our stay at Bathurst, a party of the mounted police went
in search of a very daring gang of bush-rangers, or, as they are
sometimes called, "bolters." After some search, the officer in
command, Lieut. Hilliard (of the 86th or 28th, I forget which),
divided his force, taking one route himself, accompanied by a
single trooper, and sent the rest in an opposite direction. He had
not gone far before he found the gang of seven desperadoes
comfortably bivouacking, with eleven stand of arms, loaded, beside
them; and by a sudden and gallant attack, secured them all, and
brought them into Bathurst; his prowess being duly appreciated by
the settlers, who presented him with a valuable token of their
gratitude.</p>

<p>The plan usually pursued by the bush-rangers in robbing a house
(which I imagine they very rarely do without collision with the
servants) is to walk quietly in, and "bail up," i.e. bind with
cords, or otherwise secure, the male portion, leaving an armed
guard over them, whilst the rest of the gang ransack the house,
taking all firearms, money, plate, or valuables, together with what
clothes or stores they require. Resistance is out of the question,
silence or death being the alternative. One friend of ours on such
an occasion sprang across the room to seize his gun, the moment the
bush-rangers entered, but they fired, and he was severely wounded,
without gaining his object; another gentleman had several fingers
shot off, but the wretches seldom commit murder if their victims
quietly submit to their peremptory demands.</p>

<p>Another unpleasant class of neighbours were the native dogs, or
dingoes, evidently a species of wolf, or perhaps the connecting
link between the wolf and dog. These creatures were very numerous
around us, and their howling or yelling at night in the
neighbouring forests had a most dismal, unearthly kind of tone.
They are more the figure of a Scotch colly, or sheep-dog, than any
other I can think of as a comparison, but considerably larger,
taller, and more gaunt-looking, with shaggy, wiry hair, and most
often of a sandy colour. Their appearance is altogether wolfish,
and the expression of the head especially so, nor do their
ferocious habits by any means weaken the likeness.</p>

<p>We had a number of calves, which, for greater safety from these
savage animals, were folded at night in one of the old orchards
adjoining the house; but several of the poor little ones fell
victims to the dingoes. Shortly after our arrival at our new
residence, we were one night alarmed by a fearful outcry among the
calves, and Mr. Meredith, who instantly divined the cause, got up,
and found several dingoes dragging along one of the youngest of the
herd; as they ran away he fired, but the night being thickly dark,
the brutes escaped. The cries of terror among the poor calves had
brought all the cows to the spot, and the indescribable moaning and
bellowing they continued until morning showed their instinctive
knowledge of the danger. The poor wounded calf was so much injured
that it died the following day, and its unhappy mother, after
watching and comforting it as long as life remained, never ceased
her cries and moans till she entirely lost her voice from
hoarseness: I have rarely seen anything more distressing than the
poor animal's misery; and to prevent such an occurrence again, the
youngest calves were always locked in the stable at night.</p>

<p>The dingoes rarely kill their victim at once, but coolly
commence <i>eating</i> it, at whatever part they chance to have
first laid hold of, three or four often gnawing at the unfortunate
animal together, whilst its agonised cries do not seem to disturb
their horrible feast in the slightest degree; and unless by chance
a vital part is destroyed, the maimed creature probably lingers
during hours of protracted and unimaginable torture.</p>

<p>Their audacity, too, is quite equal to their other engaging
qualities. Finding that our veal was not to be obtained, a party of
them made an onslaught on our pork, and very early one morning
carried off a nice fat pig, nearly full grown. Luckily pigs are not
often disposed to be silent martyrs, and the one in question made
so resolute a protest against the abduction, that the noise reached
Mr. Meredith, who immediately gave chase, and soon met the main
body of porkers trotting home at a most unwonted speed, whilst the
voice of woe continued its wail in the distance; on coming to the
spot, he found two dingoes dragging off the pig by the hind legs
towards a thick scrub; he fired, wounding one, when both released
their victim and made off, the poor pig trotting home, telling a
long and emphatic story of its wrongs and sufferings, from which it
eventually recovered. In about two hours after this, a lame white
dingo, the same which had been so lately shot at, boldly chased my
two pet goats into the veranda!</p>

<p>On one occasion Mr. Meredith was travelling from one station to
another with a number of cattle, both old and young, and at night
had, as usual, placed them in a secure stock-yard, the calves being
with the cows. On going to see them turned out in the morning, the
peculiar moaning of a cow struck him as being similar to that of
one which had lost her calf; but knowing they were all right the
night before, he paid little attention to it, until, on observing a
skin and fresh blood just outside the rails, he examined more
closely, and found that the dingoes had contrived to drag a young
calf through the bars of the stock-yard, and had devoured it
(doubtless nearly alive) within a foot or two of the miserable cow,
who could see and hear, but not help, her poor little one.</p>

<p>Frequently, when their visits are interrupted, a foal or calf is
found with a limb half-eaten away, and the utmost vigilance is
requisite to protect the yet more helpless sheep from their
ravenous jaws. All flocks are folded at night and watched. Two
yards or folds are usually erected near together, between which the
watchman has his box, and a large bright fire, and frequently
during the night he walks round with his dogs.</p>

<p>I had not the satisfaction of seeing any of the marauders about
us taken, though they were continually seen by the servants
skulking about, early in the morning, and I have seen them pass
through our veranda before sunrise, followed by our own dogs,
barking and growling their evident dislike of the intruders. The
dingoes do not bark, but howl and yell most dismally. The
Cumberland hounds meet occasionally in the neighbourhood of
Homebush, and I hoped they would find and destroy some; but though
repeatedly on the scent, they did not succeed, and the members of
the "hunt" seemed generally to prefer having their fox (dingo) in a
bag, to the trouble, or, as I should have supposed it, sport of
finding one in the forest.</p>

<p>The "flying fox" of New South Wales is an animal I do not
remember to have seen any published account of, yet it is a very
remarkable one. I had often heard Mr. Meredith speak of the
quantities of these creatures that he had seen on the shores of the
Hunter's River, but was not aware we had any of them near us, until
one moonlight night, whilst initiating an English friend into the
barbarous mysteries of opossum-shooting familiarly termed
"possumin", he heard a great flapping and rustling amongst the
branches and leaves above his head, and firing, brought down a very
fine specimen of the flying fox.</p>

<p>I forget the dimensions which Dr. Buckland assigns to the
pterodactyle, the gigantic bat of a former world; but this seemed a
not unworthy representative of the species, the wings measuring
between four and five feet at their full expansion, and the body
being larger than that of a well-conditioned rat. The head more
resembles that of a dog than a bat, covered, like the middle and
hinder portions of the body, with thick black hair, that round the
neck being fox-coloured. The claws and limbs of the wings are very
strong, and the membrane very tough and elastic.</p>

<p>These giant bats are especially destructive in orchards, as they
have a great penchant for ripe fruit, particularly peaches, and
their mode of gathering their dessert not being economical, they
knock off great quantities while buffeting about in the trees;
added to which, their scent is so exceedingly unpleasant that no
fruit they have once touched is eatable.</p>

<p>I never saw any other large bats here. Several of a small kind,
apparently very similar to the common little English bat, used to
flit about the house in an evening; but I liked them too well to
molest them.</p>

<p>One dead specimen of the flying opossum was brought to me. The
head greatly resembles in its gentle expression those of the other
kinds of opossum, and with a still greater length of prehensile
tail. The fore and hind legs on either side are enclosed in the
soft, elastic, furry membrane, which spreads like a bat's wing from
the back, leaving only the sharply clawed feet exposed. On having
the body skinned, I observed that this membrane was double, and
easily separated, but without the slightest particle of any other
substance between the two thin, almost transparent textures. The
upper portion was covered with warm black fur; the under part had a
thinner covering of soft, greyish white hair.</p>

<p>Several of the mischievous little animals commonly called native
cats <i>(Dasyurus &mdash;&mdash;?)</i> were destroyed by our dogs. They seem
to occupy the same place in Australia that the weasel and ferret
family do at home, being terribly destructive if they can get into
the henhouse; not only killing to eat, but continuing to kill as
many fowls or turkeys as they have time for, leaving a sad
spectacle of mangled corpses behind them. They are pretty, but have
a sharp, vicious countenance, very different to the deer-like
expression of the herbivorous animals here. Their common colour is
grey, finely spotted with white; the tail thin, covered with rather
long, wiry hair, which forms a sort of tassel at the end. They are
about the size of a lean, half-grown domestic cat, very agile,
fierce, and strong, and extremely tenacious of life. Dogs seem to
have a natural propensity to destroy them, but sometimes find the
engagement rather more equal than they might wish.</p>

<p>Very few birds came near our house, but among those few was the
robin <i>(Petroica phoenicea?)</i>, as much more beautiful in
plumage as he is inferior in note to our winter darling in England,
but with exactly the same jaunty air and brisk, quick manner. His
attire is, I really think, the most exquisite of all the feathered
creatures here: the breast is the most vivid geranium-colour,
softening to a paler shade towards the wings, which are glossy
black, with clear white markings across them; the back is also
black, with a white spot on the crown of the head, and the
tail-feathers are also barred with white. The colours are so clear
and distinct as almost to convey the idea of different garments put
on and fitted with the most exquisite taste; whilst the gay,
frolicsome air, and intelligent, bright, black eyes of the little
beau tell you that he is by no means unconscious of the very
favourable impression his appearance must create. He hops about,
sings a few notes of a soft, lively little song; flies to a rail or
low tree, and arranges some fancied impropriety in a wing-feather
and then surveys the glossy spread of his tail as he peeps over his
shoulder, and after a few more hops, and another small warble, very
sweet and very low&mdash;a passing glance, like the flash of a tiny
flambeau, and he is gone!</p>

<p>Some robins, which I supposed the females, have a less vivid
scarlet on the breast, though similar in all other respects.</p>

<p>When we first came to Homebush, I observed fragments of many
swallows' nests in the veranda, and marks where others had been,
but had wholly crumbled away, the constant heat so drying the mud
that it could not stick, and the poor birds were in constant danger
of losing both their patient labour and their helpless young. To
obviate this sad distress, I had a few little shelves nailed up in
the most retired part of the veranda, as foundations for the nests,
and soon had the satisfaction of seeing a nice strong
superstructure raised on one of them, from which in process of time
five downy little heads emerged, opening very wide mouths for the
food constantly supplied by the parent birds. Only one family
placed themselves thus under our immediate protection, but many
others built in the old barn and other outhouses.</p>

<p>One bird which frequently came near the house has a very
singular note, which has gained for him the Colonial
<i>sobriquet</i> of the "knife-grinder;" a portion of his song
bearing a most accurate resemblance to the sound of grinding a
knife on the grindstone, giving exactly the crrew&mdash;&mdash;whiss-ss-ss-,
but in a most musical and dulcet tone. His attire, as befitting an
artisan, is somewhat sober and plain.</p>

<p>Another equally singular voice among our feathered friends was
that of the "coachman," than which no title could be more
appropriate, his chief note being a long clear whistle, with a
smart crack of the whip to finish with. Although I have often heard
his fine clear voice sounding far above me, from his favourite
perch in the top of the highest tree near, I never had a distinct
view of Mr. Jehu.</p>

<p>The "bell-bird" has, as may be supposed, won its appellation
from the resemblance of its deep full voice to the tones of a bell;
and that general favourite, the "laughing jackass," equally well
merits the first portion of his title, by his merry and most
musical peals of laughter; but why he should be called a
"<i>jackass</i>" at all, I am at a loss to divine. Under this name,
however, he is generally respected in the colony, being an adroit
destroyer of snakes, guanas, and other reptiles. When many of these
merry birds congregate together, the effect is extremely droll:
first one begins alone, and laughs lustily out at the top of his
voice; a second, third, and fourth then take up the strain, like
glee-singers, till the whole party are fairly off, and the very
trees seem to peal out along with them. I am half inclined to fancy
that Martini's popular laughing chorus, "<i>Vadasi via di qua</i>,"
must have been suggested by the voices of my friends the Australian
jackasses; certain it is, that both songs have an equally
infectious spirit, and set the most gloomy-minded listener laughing
in concert, whether he will or no. The poor birds often fall
victims to their own accomplishments, for, being much esteemed as
"pets," they are frequently maimed to prevent their escape, and
tied by the leg or closely caged, whilst their less human
persecutors spoil their naturally merry voices by teaching them a
few lame bars of some London-alley tune; and "All round my Hat,"
"Jump Jim Crow," or "Sich a getting up Stairs," tells a melancholy
story of their miserable fate.</p>

<p>Many small birds, with which I am not sufficiently acquainted to
describe them, inhabited our woods; and one or two kinds of
"larks," as they are called, used to rise in considerable numbers
from the dry grass-tufts, as we walked over the cleared land. A few
quail, a chance wild duck or teal, and one solitary snipe, formed
our list of game at Homebush, and I scarcely saw a parrot during
our stay.</p>

<p>The Norfolk Island pine <i>(Aracauria excelsa)</i>, of which, as
I have before remarked, we had three magnificent specimens close to
the house, is certainly the most noble and stately tree of all the
pine family that I have ever seen, beautiful as are they all. The
tall, erect, and tapering stem (seventy or eighty feet high), the
regularity of the circling branches, lessening by small degrees
from the widely-spread expanse below, to the tiny cross that crowns
the summit of the exquisite natural spire, and the richly verdant,
dense, massive foliage clothing the whole with an unfading array of
scale-armour, form altogether the finest model of a pine that can
be imagined. The cones too are worthy to grow on such a tree; solid
ponderous things, as large as a child's head&mdash;not a <i>baby's</i>
head, neither&mdash;with a fine embossed coat of mail, firmly seated on
the beam-like branches, as if defying the winds to shake them.</p>

<p>Mr. Meredith climbed very nearly to the summit of our tallest
pine, and said he had never seen anything more beautiful than the
downward view into and over the mass of diverging branches spread
forth beneath him. He brought me down one cone, with its spray, if
so I may call the armful of thick green shoots that surrounded it,
and I was gazing at it for half the day after; it was so different
from anything I had seen before, so new, and so grandly beautiful.
The rigidity of the foliage had a sculpture-like character, that
made me think how exquisitely Gibbons would have wrought its image
in some of his graceful and stately designs, had he ever seen the
glorious tree.</p>

<p>One of those at Homebush grew near to the front veranda, and
some of its enormous roots had spread under the heavy stone
pavement, lifting it up in an arch, like a bridge.</p>

<p>When the cones ripened, the large winged seeds fell out in great
numbers; they require to be planted immediately, if at all, as the
oil in them quickly dries out, and with it the vegetative
properties are lost.</p>

<p>Close under the towering pines grew a common English pear-tree;
a crooked, wide-spreading, leafy, farm-house-garden sort of
pear-tree, that won my especial love, from the good old-fashioned
pictures of gable-ended houses and neat garden-orchards it brought
into my mind, and the glory and delight of its spring-time blossoms
was an earnest and most child-like joy to me. Surely never was
pear-tree so watched and gazed on, both morning, evening, and
moonlight!&mdash;for Sydney moonlights are like tropical ones, so clear,
so silver-bright, that I could see to read small print as well as
by day&mdash;and the old pear-tree shone out in them like a beautiful
vision of home, telling store of pleasant stories in each
fluttering leaf that fell from its thousands of flowers&mdash;telling of
bloomy fragrant gardens, with velvet turf paths, and shady arbours,
and singing birds, and little running brooks, <i>one</i> of whose
silver threads near our thirsty home would have been a priceless
treasure&mdash;oh! it was an exhaustless remembrancer of pleasant
by-gones was that old pear-tree!</p>

<p>Its rival in my home-loving regards was a little root of the
double daisy, which, as a great treasure, my husband brought me one
day from a gardener's. It lived, as very few daisies do at home, I
can tell them, in a pot by itself, and was carried into the shade,
and watered daily, and tended with as much solicitude as any
<i>rara avis</i> of the choicest conservatory. It bore two nice
pinky-white daisies, just like real English ones; and then, during
an illness I had, in which I could not attend to it, it withered
away, and my first glance into the garden showed me the scorched
remains of my poor favourite.</p>

<p>Many very pretty native flowers and shrubs adorned our "bush,"
or rather forest, and the graceful native indigo crept up many
bushes and fences, sometimes totally hiding them with its elegant
draperies. Another handsome climber of the same family
<i>(Kennedia)</i> has rich crimson flowers, very long in the part
called the keel, with bright yellow stamens protruding from its
point. This species climbs to a height of twenty or thirty feet,
and the dark leaves and drooping flowers hang down in elegant
pendulous wreaths. But the most beautiful climbing plant I have yet
seen in Australia, I know not the name of, nor can I find any
botanical description to suit it, except that of <i>Bignonia
Australis</i>, which it possibly is. The leaves resemble those of
the jessamine in form, but are much larger, and of a rich glossy
green; the flowers fox-glove shaped, in long axillary sprays, their
colour being a delicate cream-colour, beautifully variegated within
by bright purple markings. I only found one plant of it, in a
(comparatively) cool moist thicket in our Homebush wood.</p>

<p>Great quantities of a tall, handsome, herbaceous plant, commonly
called the "mock-cotton tree," grew near us, and by the roadsides
around Sydney, it having at one time been introduced as a probably
profitable speculation, but the cotton was not found to be a
marketable article. The clusters of white flowers are extremely
beautiful, having very much the structure of the <i>Hoya
carnosa</i>, and are full of clear honey. I used to put them to a
very ignoble use, namely, as fly-cages, to attract the troublesome
swarms from our picture-frames, which the honey-laden blossoms
effected to a great extent.</p>

<p>The seed-pods are large, and full of most beautiful soft
filaments, like white floss silk, which before they are ruffled by
the wind have a bright and silvery gloss, that might well tempt a
trial of so fair a material in manufactures. It looks as if it
might be spun into an exquisite stuff between cambric and satin;
and I think still, that some clever genius of the spinning-jennies
might weave us a most dainty and gossamer fabric of its fine and
even threads, which are the wings of the seeds, and being so light
and long, waft them an immense distance, often to the annoyance of
the agriculturist, who would by no means partake in my idle
admiration of his insidious foe. I suppose it is a species of
<i>Asclepias</i>.</p>

<p>Small shrubs with yellow and orange papilionaceous blossoms
abounded everywhere, some clinging to the ground like mosses, and
others, with every variety of soft and hard, smooth and prickly
leaves that can be imagined, growing into tall shrubs, all very
pretty, but with so strong a family likeness that I grew fastidious
among them, and rarely gathered more than two or three. A small
scentless violet and a bright little yellow sorrel (which is an
excellent salad-herb) made some few patches of the dry earth gay
with their blue and golden blossoms, and the ground convolvulus and
southern harebell seldom failed to greet me in our rambles. Various
kinds of epacris also abounded, with delicate wax-like pink and
white flowers.</p>

<p>The trees called by the Colonists "he-oak" and "she-oak"
<i>(Casuarina stricta</i> and <i>C. torulosa)</i> form a remarkable
feature in Australian scenery. They are usually of rather handsome
forms, with dark, rough, permanent bark, and brownish-olive
foliage, resembling in structure the "horse-tails" of English
brooks, consisting of long tufts of jointed grassy branchlets,
hanging down like coarse hair, or a horse's tail. The he-oak has
much shorter tresses than the she-oak, which may perhaps have given
rise to the absurd Colonial distinction of the species (as they
belong to the order <i>Monoecia</i>). The blossoms in spring appear
like a small crimson fringe on portions of the branches, and the
succeeding cones are the size of a pigeon's egg, very roughly
tubercled. Perhaps none of all the novel trees in this Colony have
so completely strange and un-English an aspect as these; and in a
moderate breeze the tones uttered amongst their thousands of
waving, whispering strings are far from unmusical, and reminded me
of the lower, wailing notes of an Aeolian harp. However luxuriant
may be the foliage of one of these singular trees, the skeleton
form of the branches is never hidden, but every twig shows itself,
making a drawing of one rather a puzzling affair to so humble a
limner as myself.</p>

<p><i>She-oak</i> is especially liked as fuel. It is said that this
name has been borrowed from the <i>sheac</i>, or cheoak, of
America, in consequence of some resemblance in the wood.</p>

<p>The zamia, now so well known in English stoves, I have often
observed near Sydney, with its handsome coronet of palm-like leaves
gracefully spreading round the central cone. Near the road to
Cook's River they grow very numerously.</p>

<p>The name, and some resemblance in form between the seed-vessel
and the fruit, form all the likeness which the famed "wooden
pear-tree" of Australia bears to its more useful namesake at home.
One or two large specimens of the wooden fruit which I saw were the
size of a good Jargonelle pear. When ripe, they split open from end
to end, showing a solid wooden structure, with the thin winged
seeds scaling off the inner sides. Several other shrubs bear
similar seed-vessels of a smaller size.</p>

<p>The "native cherry" <i>(Exocarpus cupressiformis)</i> has no
better claim to its borrowed title than the pear-tree, being in
foliage more like a cypress, but of a brighter and yellower green
than the generality of trees in this ever-brown region. Its form is
usually handsome, although it seldom attains a large size, and the
wood is remarkably close, hard, and finely grained, well adapted
for turning or carving. The fruit, so celebrated among Antipodean
contrarieties for having the "stone outside," is like a small
yew-berry, but still less pleasant in flavour, with a hard seed
growing from its end, fancifully termed the stone. Of all countries
or climates, I think that of Australia must be the most barren of
useful natural products of the vegetable kingdom; for this
miserable "cherry" is the best specimen of its indigenous fruits,
if not the only one; nor am I aware of any one edible grain or root
fit for human food. Some florid descriptive writers have, I know,
luxuriated in depicting imaginary gardens of "parsley and wild
carrots," amidst which the cattle are said to revel in abundance;
but whilst in the Colony I never heard of such things. Perhaps the
wretched root which, as I have before mentioned, the aborigines dig
for when all other sustenance fails them, may be the "carrot" in
question; but it is too hot, stringy, bitter, and small to be of
the slightest use to Europeans.</p>

<p>Some of the insect-architects here are most extraordinary
creatures; but I grieve to say I know comparatively little about
them, my chief acquaintance being with their deserted houses, of
which I have several kinds. Some of these are formed of straight
twigs, the sixth or eighth part of an inch thick, and from two to
four inches long, placed side by side in a circular form, and very
strongly webbed together within, so that it is impossible to tear
them asunder without breaking the twigs, the ends of which usually
project beyond the closed portion of the cell, which is suspended
by a strong web woven over the spray of a tree or shrub, so as to
let it swing with the wind. I have sometimes seen a large white
caterpillar inside an unfinished cell, and on one or two occasions
have observed a bush or tree so full of these pendent berths as to
give them the appearance of a good crop of some fruit or seed; but
(very stupidly) I always limited my collection to the vacant ones,
or I might have learned much more of their economy. How such a
creature could cut off, and carry to their destined place, pieces
of twig four or five times its own weight, I cannot imagine: that
they were cut expressly for the purpose is evident from the neat
manner in which the ends are rounded off: they are left of uneven
lengths, and not webbed on the outside, which, together with their
being hung so as to wave with the leaves of the tree, seem all
precautions against discovery.</p>

<p class="cp"><img alt="" src="1600201h-images/insect-architecture.jpg"></p>
<p class="caption"><b>Insect Architecture</b></p>

<p>Some are formed in the same manner of much smaller twigs; others
are pointed bags of strong web, with small bits of stick fastened
at intervals on the outside; and some are formed of a webbed bag,
to which quantities of small dead leaves are attached by one end
only, so as to cover it entirely, and flutter like a withered bunch
of leaves; but all are hung upon trees as much resembling the nests
in colour and aspect as possible. Those I have opened are lined
within with the smoothest white silken web, the outer portion being
brown or ash-coloured, to correspond with the tint of the twigs or
leaves.</p>

<p>I have two examples of another kind of cell, like a very small
bird's egg, of a brown ash-colour, with one end open and the other
firmly attached to a twig. At first it might be mistaken for the
empty seed-vessel of a plant (had I not gathered it from a
pod-bearing shrub); but on inspection the cell seems evidently
built upon, not grown out of, the spray. The egg-shape is perfect,
and the open end smoothly finished. Both those I found were empty,
their texture was quite smooth and hard, the same substance to all
appearance as the bark on which they were so firmly lodged.</p>

<p>I saw very few butterflies in New South Wales, not more than two
species, I think, both of a finely spotted copper colour. Large
moths are more numerous; but of these I did not notice many
remarkable ones. Whilst we were at Bathurst, the settlers were
complaining of a kind of white grub which infested the roots of the
corn, and by eating through the stalks destroyed the crops; I have
seen half a dozen, or more of them, at one root. Before we left
Bathurst, a prodigious number of small copper butterflies were seen
flying about, and I had strong suspicions of their being identical
with the destructive grubs.</p>

<p>The ground-spiders may well be ranked among the wonderful native
architects of Australia; they are of various sizes, and differ in
their colour, form, and markings. They hollow a circular hole in
the earth, adapted to the size of their body, and more beautifully
formed and perfectly round than any engineer with all his
scientific instruments could have made it. Within, it is nicely
tapestried with the finest web, woven closely over the wall of this
subterranean withdrawing-room, the depth of which I never
accurately ascertained, as at a certain distance they seem to
curve, or perhaps lead into a side-cell, where the feelers of fine
grass I have introduced could not penetrate. Some of these tunnels
terminate at the surface with merely a slight web spun over the
grains of soil close to the aperture, as if to prevent their
rolling into it; the holes being from one-sixth of an inch to an
inch or more in diameter. Some of them boast the extraordinary
luxury of a front door; these I imagine to be rather first-rate
kind of spiders, and their doors are as beautiful instances of
insect skill and artifice as any that our wonder-teeming world
displays to us. When shut down over the hole, nothing but the most
accurate previous knowledge could induce any person to fancy they
could perceive any difference in the surface of the soil; but,
perhaps, if you remain very still for some minutes, the clever
inhabitant will come forth, when you first perceive a circle of
earth, perhaps the size of a wedding-ring or larger, lifted up from
beneath, like a trap-door; it falls back gently on its hinge side,
and a fine, hairy, beautifully pencilled brown or grey spider pops
out, and most probably pops in again, to sit just beneath the
opening, and wait for his dinner of flies or other eatable
intruders. Then we see that the under side and the rim of his
earthen door are thickly and neatly webbed over, so that not a
grain of soil can fall away from its thickness, which is usually
about the eighth or tenth of an inch, and although so skilfully
webbed below, the upper surface preserves exactly the same
appearance as the surrounding soil. The hinge consists also of web,
neatly attached to that of the lid and the box. I have the greatest
respect and admiration for these clever mechanics, and though I
very often, with a bent of grass or a soft green twig, try to
persuade one to come up and be looked at (which they generally do,
nipping fast hold of the intrusive probe), I never was guilty of
hurting one. I have picked very large ones off ground that the
plough had just turned over, and have carried them to places
unlikely to be disturbed: and I generally have two or three
particular friends among them, whom I frequently take a peep at.
They often travel some distance from home, probably in search of
food, as I have overtaken and watched them returning, when they
seldom turn aside from hand or foot placed in their way, but go
steadily on at a good swift pace, and, after dropping into their
hole, put forth a claw, and hook the door to after them, just as a
man would close a trap-door above him when descending a ladder.</p>

<p>The tarantula is not quite so great a favourite with me, as I
hare strong suspicions of its bite being venomous. At first I
understood them to be harmless, although servants and ignorant
people hold them in great abhorrence, and, unless too frightened to
approach, always kill them when discovered. Certainly the
appearance of a full-sized tarantula is by no means prepossessing.
An oval body nearly an inch long, and a proportionably large head
and shoulders, are surrounded by eight bent-up legs, two or three
inches long, covered, as are also the head and body, with thick,
fine, brown, hair-like fur. When disturbed they scramble along at a
rapid rate, and are very frequent residents behind pictures or
furniture against the wall, often causing terrific screams from
one's housemaid, which are somewhat alarming, until, on inquiry,
the dreadful words "A <i>Triantelope</i>, Ma'am!" are gasped out,
and the tragedy ends in the death, or, as I usually arrange it, the
careful expulsion of the intruder.</p>

<p>Not being learned in entomology, I know not if the tarantula is
a spinning spider or not, but I never saw one in a web, or detected
any thread attached to their bodies. Out of doors their favourite
haunts are old trees, where they live between the loose bark and
the wood, or in cracks of wooden fences; and from the large
families of several generations which I have sometimes discovered,
I imagine their habits to be somewhat patriarchal.</p>

<p>Several persons of education and intelligence have assured me of
their dangerous nature, but I have never yet witnessed an instance
of it, and they are such patient and industrious fly-catchers, that
so long as they confine their perambulations to the ceiling, or the
upper portion of the walls of a room, I never disturb them.</p>

<p>Many other large kinds of spider are common, and frequently in
the woods I have found some with immense webs of dark yellow silk,
which would bear a tolerable pull without breaking; the threads
being far thicker and stronger than those of the silkworm, and
often stretched from tree to tree, in a length of several yards.
The weavers of these are very handsomely marked spiders of various
colours, bright green being a prevalent one. If, as I remember
hearing some years since, spiders' web can be spun into gloves and
lace, the manufacturers would do well to procure a supply of the
raw material from Australia.</p>

<p>We once found what appeared to be the first essay of a numerous
family of young spiders at setting up in life on their own account.
The large parent web, of strong bright silk, was spread out in all
its exquisite and regular divisions across a path, with the portly
owner daintily arrayed in green, with leopard-spot markings,
staidly poised in the centre; and close by, scattered amongst the
twigs and leaves of the thick shrubs, hung a multitude of
<i>little</i> starry webs, with a little spider seated in the midst
of each, all exactly the same size, and bearing a strong filial
resemblance to the large one.</p>

<p>The scorpion is a far more truly formidable creature than the
tarantula, and, as it frequently lives in old wood, is apt to be
brought into the house with the fuel. It is the real, orthodox,
zodiacal scorpion, with its hideous scaly, claw-armed body, and
long jointed tail, ending in a fearful sting, a wound from which is
severely painful, and often of dangerous consequence. It is,
without doubt, the most horrible-looking of all the creeping and
crawling fraternity that I am acquainted with; and even my
philanthropy cannot defend the detestable scorpion, which I
ruthlessly kill whenever an opportunity offers. Those I have seen
in these Colonies are about two inches long, the tail being about
half the entire length; and when the creature is disturbed, this
diabolical tail seems to turn on a dozen pivots, darting in every
direction, until, when hard pressed or wounded, the creature most
assuredly stings itself (even without being "girt by fire"), but
whether accidentally, or with intent to commit <i>felo de se</i>,
of course no one can decide, unless some vicious, venomous
individual who <i>was</i> a scorpion "in Pythagoras' time" can
throw light on this poesy-honoured question!</p>

<p>On several evenings I was driven from the veranda, where we
commonly sat for some time after sunset, by the sudden appearance
of great numbers of large hornets flying in all directions; and the
cattle and horses seemed, by their half frantic demeanour and loud
cries, as well aware as ourselves what dangerous visitors had
arrived, although we did not find that any of the animals were
stung. All the fences near the house were thickly occupied by the
hornets, who seemed, by their loud buzzing and rapid movements, to
be themselves in a state of great excitement. These tumultuous and
most unpleasant assemblies took place for several evenings in
succession, but fortunately the terror of all our household
sufficed to keep every one as much within doors as possible, and we
all escaped being stung. I did not even see a single hornet in the
house, which, with such countless swarms careering through the air
all around, and even in the veranda, seems rather singular.</p>

<p>Mosquitoes used to rise in positive clouds from the banks of the
creek in the evening, and if I dared to remain then near the water,
they severely punished my temerity, their long sharp proboscis
piercing like a fine needle through shoes, gloves, dress, or shawl,
and the shrill hum of some hundreds round my face seeming to
promise a still further increase of their delicate attentions. A
precipitate retreat was my only resource, for most fortunately we
were rarely annoyed by them within doors, and there at least I
could escape the torments.</p>

<p>But the house, as if no place in this Colony could be free from
nuisances, was assailed by myriads of ants, that made their way
into every description of sweet stuff, through every kind of
barrier; jars, canisters, boxes, and papers were alike unavailing;
whatever I touched seemed alive with ants, and their industry was
unwearied; day and night the "runs," or paths they traversed, were
always black with their countless millions, like a miniature
Cheapside or Ludgate Hill, and none of our destructive or
protective measures seemed to make the least difference. If one
million were scalded, two more supplied their place, and I have met
some of the little foragers with bits of sugar in their mouths far
down the garden, showing their plans of business to be on a most
extensive scale.</p>

Matters&mdash;Embarkation for Van Diemen's Land.</p>

<p>Many large kinds of guanas inhabit New South Wales; some, which
have been described to me, must be enormous reptiles. I have only
seen two species, the most common being generally called the
sleeping lizard, and is found also in Van Diemen's Land. It is
about a foot or fourteen inches in length, the body dark coloured,
fat, and bloated-looking; the tail short and thick; the head broad,
with a snaky expression, and a long blue tongue, which gives the
poor animal a terrible reputation among the vulgar, who declare
that so blue a tongue must be a proof of its venomous nature. I
believe, if the poor stupid creatures had the sense to keep their
ill-hued tongues out of sight, many hundreds would escape violent
deaths. Contrary to the habits of most lizards, which are
remarkable for their extreme activity and timid alertness on the
approach of a footstep, or the slightest noise, the sleeping guana
is often seen lying in the midst of the road, and frequently the
crushed body of one bears disastrous evidence of the fatal
consequences of indolence. Sometimes we have turned aside to avoid
driving over them, or have bestowed a light lash of the whip in
passing, which only caused them to crawl slowly away, as if our
friendly hint were a most officious and impertinent proceeding, and
they had rather a preference for being trodden or rolled to death.
They are most undeniably ugly creatures, although without the
hideous pouch-cheeks of the West Indian guanas; but we always
considered them quite harmless, until a little incident which
occurred since our residence in Van Diemen's Land led us to suspect
them of being at least capable of mischief.</p>

<p>One day, last summer, we found one lying in our path, during a
bush-ramble; and without any intention to hurt or annoy the animal,
but merely to intimate that its place of repose was an unsafe one,
Mr. Meredith touched it gently with the barrel of his gun, when,
instead of retreating as might be expected, it turned fiercely
round, and snapped repeatedly at the gun, just as a savage dog
would do, and bit so sharply and strongly as to cut into the solid
iron with its teeth, as deeply as a hard stroke of a diamond cuts
into glass. Had a hand or foot been in the place of the gun, a
fearful wound must have been inflicted. Still, as they appear only
to act on the defensive, I see no reason for wantonly destroying
them, although I would not advise any one to incur their bite.</p>

<p>My other acquaintance in the guana family is a far less
loathsome creature; I have only seen one specimen, which Mr.
Meredith shot, as it was swiftly climbing a tree, with only its
head exposed, watching his movements. The head and body of this
together were not more than ten inches long, but the slender
tapering tail measured more than twice as much. The head had no
pouch-cheeks, but was a sharp, knowing-looking lizard's head,
covered with small, close, hard scales, as were the entire body,
tail, and legs; the feet had long toes, and long, sharp, black
claws, evidently well adapted for climbing trees, and seeming as
if, like the natives' yahoo, it could turn its feet any way
required. The whole of the creature was most beautifully piebald
black and white, and in some parts the old scaly coat was shelling
off, leaving a brighter new one below. This guana had moveable
teeth, like those of the snake, but, I need scarcely say, we were
not anxious to experimentalize upon their qualities. By the
ignorant, and even by some persons who might be supposed to know
better, these animals are termed goannas, and I have heard of a
"great pianna" among them.</p>

<p>Numbers of a small kind of lizard, about five or six inches
long, used to frequent the garden as well as the "bush," and two
took up their abode in my china-pantry, where I often saw them
crouching motionless on the dresser, watching the flies till one
came near enough to be snapped up in their nimble jaws. Flies were
so great a torment, that I respected anything which aided to
destroy them, and accordingly never molested the lizards; but my
housemaid, who, I fear, was destitute of all taste for natural
history, had a great dread of my poor friends, and either used to
run shrieking away, or fling something at them whenever they
ventured into her sight. They were agile, delicate little
creatures, with bright black eyes, slender long-tailed bodies of a
mottled grey and pale brown colour, and extremely fine small feet
and toes. Still, they were reptiles, and the common prejudice
against their race extended even to these very harmless little
creatures.</p>

<p>With the snake tribe in New South Wales, I am happy to say my
personal acquaintance is very limited, for I fully partake in the
horror usually and very reasonably entertained of them. Our
servants had frequently raised an alarm about a "large black
snake," which lived in an unoccupied hut near the house, but it
always vanished before a gun could be brought, and we rather
discredited the story, until on one occasion the alarm being, I
suppose, more quietly given, Mr. Meredith succeeded in shooting it
through the head, to the extreme satisfaction of the whole
household. It was not a large snake, not being more than four feet
long, of a purplish black colour, with a kind of damson-bloom on
the skin, instead of a polished appearance, which most of them
have, and down each side was a streak of dim red. The extreme
tenacity of life in these reptiles, or more probably the long
continuance of muscular power and motion, even after the head has
been wholly severed from the body, has given rise to a common idea
that at whatever time of the day a snake may be <i>killed</i>, it
cannot <i>die</i> until sunset. The extraordinary activity with
which the tail-end of the creature will leap and jump about, whilst
the head is swiftly travelling in another direction, is horrible to
see; it seems as if every joint had a vitality of its own, entirely
independent of brains, or spinal cords, or any other imagined seat
of life.</p>

<p>One of our men-servants told a story of a large black snake
which lived in his hut a long time, and used to lie on his bed at
night, until he took unto himself a wife, who, very naturally,
demurred at the presence of so suspicious a bed-fellow, and induced
him to kill it. The large kind called the diamond snake is (for a
snake) as handsome a creature as can be conceived, being most
exquisitely adorned with various colours, like mosaic-work. Could a
lapidary imitate its varied markings in a girdle or bracelet of
gems and gold, his fortune would be made.</p>

<p>During our walks in the forest we frequently saw a smaller kind
of snake, about two feet long, and so exactly similar in colour to
the dead sticks and leaves with which the ground was covered, as
not to be observed until they moved: I several times have most
narrowly escaped treading on them, which, as all the snakes known
in this Colony are venomous, would be a dangerous accident. Some
species are far more fatal than others, and of a few the bite is
certainly mortal. Among the latter, the small one commonly called
the whip-snake, or death-adder, is the most rapidly fatal of all.
Several instances of immediate death from its bite were related to
me. On the victims in two cases, my informant, our friend Mr. Dunn,
of the Hunter River, had, as coroner for the district, held
inquests; the evidence proving that in one instance death ensued in
seven minutes after the bite, and in the other in eight, the
sufferers being scarcely conscious of having been hurt, so very
slight had been the puncture, and so wonderfully subtle the poison.
It may well be imagined that these dreadful occurrences did not
tend to diminish my terror of snakes.</p>

<p>One portion of our land at Homebush consisted of salt-water
marshes, covered in high tides, and producing immense quantities of
a species of samphire. Through these marshes deep drains had been
cut and embankments formed, evidently at an enormous expenditure of
labour, but for what purpose we never could divine. One of these
drains, which, being very old, had become quite natural-looking,
with shrubs, trees, and all kinds of growth adorning the banks, had
a sort of wide flood-gate next the creek, through which the tide
flowed and ebbed, bringing with it quantities of fine fish, bream
and mullet especially. A couple of narrow logs formed something of
an "Al Sirat" across the deep channel, which was about twenty feet
wide, and on this crazy bridge Mr. Meredith used to station himself
to fish; but not being a votary of the so <i>called</i> "gentle
craft" of quaint old Izaak Walton, he found a spear armed with a
strong barb a more efficient weapon than the rod, and often caught
some very fine fish.</p>

<p>I, meanwhile, read, sketched, or more frequently idled away an
hour or two in watching the myriads of small crabs with which the
muddy banks were thickly peopled. At a certain state of the tide
they might be seen scrambling out of the water by thousands, and
often reminded me of a hungry cargo of stage-coach passengers, to
whose dinner only a limited time can be allotted; for the whole
troop, after sidling a short distance from the water, immediately
commenced eating most expeditiously, picking up some mysterious
comestible from the soft rich mud, first with one claw and then
with the other, and continually carrying the supplies to the mouth,
which, being situated in the broad central region, always gave the
idea of a person very busily engaged in filling his
waistcoat-pockets; and the effect of some thousands of these odd
little bodies all engaged in the same manoeuvres was droll in the
extreme. If disturbed, they instantly began turning round and round
on one claw, as it seemed in a kind of <i>pirouette</i>, using
themselves as an auger to work their way down, and in an incredibly
short time were all lost to view. Occasionally, two happened to fix
on the same spot to bore into, or probably old holes remained in
the mud, only slightly hidden by the last tide, and access to the
known sanctuary was disputed; in this case there was usually a
great deal of clawing and turning under and over, which ended in
the combatants both waltzing away together under the mud. These
crabs were of various colours, some red, others black, and some
dark green. On the sandy beaches near Sydney I have seen some very
small ones, of a fine blue, just as busy pirouetting into the white
sand as my Homebush friends were in the black mud. The larger ones
had bodies the breadth of a dollar, whilst some of the small were
not bigger than a fourpenny-piece.</p>

<p>A disgusting tenant of most of the shores around Sydney, and of
ours in particular, is the toad-fish: most admirably named; it
looks precisely like a toad elongated into a fish, with a tough,
leathery, scaleless skin, and a bloated body, dark mottled brown
above and white beneath. It is usually about five inches long, and
disproportionately broad, but swims very swiftly, and is, for its
size, as bold and voracious as the shark. When I said Mr. Meredith
<i>did</i> not fish with a line and rod, I might have added that he
<i>could</i> not, for the toad-fish, which swarm everywhere, no
sooner see anything dropped in the water, than they dart towards it
by dozens, and fight among themselves for the honour of swallowing
your hook, generally taking the precaution to bite off the line at
the same time. This extreme anxiety to be caught might perhaps be
pardoned were the greedy little wretches fit to eat, but they are
highly poisonous; and although I should have thought their
disgusting appearance sufficient to prevent their being tried, I
know one instance, at least, of their fatal effects, a lady with
whose family I am intimate having died in consequence of eating
them. As they thus effectually put a stop to our angling, by biting
off every hook dropped in the water before any other fish had time
to look at it, they especially enjoyed the benefit of the
fishing-spear, upon which many hundreds, if not thousands, must
have been impaled in succession.</p>

<p>This sounds very wantonly cruel, I doubt not, but let no one
pronounce it so who is not well acquainted with toad-fish; from
those who are, I fear no reproof. When speared, they directly
inflate their leathery skins to the shape of a balloon, and eject a
stream of liquid from their mouths, with a report as if they had
burst. If flung again into the water, however wounded, they
instantly swim about and begin eating; and should one be a little
less active than his fellows, they forthwith attack and eat him up.
Even my poor little harmless friends the crabs become their
victims; when these usually well-armed troops have just got their
soft new coats on, and are almost defenceless, then come the
cowardly, ravenous toad-fish, and make terrible onslaughts among
them&mdash;an attention which, I believe, the crabs eventually repay
with interest.</p>

<p>A tree which we, I know not if correctly, called the mangrove,
grew very luxuriantly on the brink of the salt-water all along the
embankments. Many of the trees, from their gnarled and twisted
appearance, seemed very old, but all were clothed in a rich glossy
verdure, something like the laurel, the leaves not being quite so
large. In the too-completely cleared space around Homebush these
belts of green trees skirting the water were of great value in our
view, and the sailing boats which daily passed up the creek,
glancing behind and between the groups of mangroves, added
infinitely to our home-pictures, and served to build many a
pleasant little fiction upon as they gaily glided past; distance
rendering all blemishes invisible. After a time, however, these
"light barks" were stripped of half their interest and all their
romance by an officious friend, who heartlessly remarked, when I
one day pointed out a particularly nice effect of light and shade
on the white sails of one, he "did not know before that Jones's
<i>brick-boats</i> came up that creek!"</p>

<p>Twice a day too the Parramatta steamer puffed in sight, as she
passed the mouth of the wide creek down which we looked towards the
estuary. And with a telescope, on a Sunday morning, we could
plainly see the carriages and pedestrians going to the new church
at Kissing Point, on the opposite shore; besides having a view of
the half-way signal-staff; and on a still night hearing the drums
beat at the Parramatta barracks. Thus, in our quiet retreat, "the
contingent advantages" were almost as extraordinary as those which
the inimitable Dick Swiveller discovered in the apartments of Mr.
Brass. Often, when we have sauntered in the garden and veranda late
in the evening, especially on a dark moonless night, I have
listened for a long time to the wild tones and voices that rose
from the forest and the marsh, whilst the wind, gently sweeping
through the string-like foliage of the casuarina, made a soft
flowing music in unison with them all. From the marsh arose the
multitudinous, incessant gurgling, croaking chorus of the lesser
frogs, with at intervals the deep sonorous <i>clop, clop</i>, of a
great one, the Lablache of the small fry, whose note is extremely
melodious and solemn withal, not unlike a single stroke on a very
mellow musical bell. The long clear treble note of the shy curlew
often came from many points at once, now near, now distant&mdash;calling
and answering each other. Many persons dislike their cry, but to me
it has a most plaintive, melodious tone, and sometimes the
concluding cadence is fer from melancholy. I often tried to see the
curlews, but they retreat on the slightest sound or motion, and,
except the tame ones at Parramatta, I only knew them as an airy
voice heard in the "stilly night." The least pleasing part of our
natural concert was that taken by the troops of dingoes, and
unfortunately it was often the most prominent. Their indescribably
wild and dismal yelling and howling seemed like the cries that evil
and tortured spirits might utter in their dire agony, and often
drove me within; for though not usually a "nervous" person, they
made me feel positively uncomfortable, and conjured up all the
fearful stories of ravenous wolves in howling wildernesses, and
packs of jackals, and all the natural-history-book horrors that I
used to shudder over when a child.</p>

<p>Some of the vineyards and orange-groves near us were extensive
and very beautiful. The large orange-trees, gay with their golden
fruit and exquisitely fragrant bridal-blossoms, are among the
noblest of all the acclimatized products here, and, with the many
other exotics common in every garden near Sydney, were quite a
delight to me to see. The handsome bushy pomegranate, adorned with
quantities of its large red fruit, is tempting in appearance, but
its beauty is very deceptive. The rind is thick and as hard as
wood, containing nothing but seeds, each enveloped in a thin coat
of acid astringent pulp; but the tree is always highly ornamental,
with its rich glowing scarlet blossoms and handsome foliage. The
large-leaved magnolia-like loquat is beautiful, whether laden with
its pendent clusters of fragrant blossoms or their succeeding
bright amber fruit. The mandarin orange is an elegant dwarf
species, with fine, smooth, bitter fruit the size of an Orleans
plum. The lemons grown in this colony resemble a Seville orange in
their rough, deformed shape, although well flavoured. Huge bushes
of the delicate oleander are very common, and how lovely, they are
may well be imagined. Geraniums of the old-fashioned kinds are
almost like weeds, but very few good varieties have reached the
colony.</p>

<p>That magnificent indigenous flower the gigantic lily (Doryanthes
excella) is often and easily cultivated in gardens, and well
deserves a place in the stateliest. From the centre of an immense
group of long, broad, curving leaves the flower-stalk rises to a
height of fifteen or twenty feet, and of proportionate thickness,
crowned with a great cluster of the gorgeous crimson lilies. It is,
truly, a colossal flower.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The following little poem, written for a
juvenile work (not yet completed), may perhaps be permitted a place
here:&mdash;<br>
<br>
THE GIGANTIC LILY.<br>
<br>
Who loves to cull gay flowers?<br>
Come hither, all, to me;<br>
I'll show ye rare and strange ones,<br>
On grass and shrub and tree.<br>
<br>
Do ye love the modest lilies,<br>
Each shrouded in its leaf.<br>
And hanging down its gentle head<br>
As full of fear, or grief?<br>
<br>
I have a lily here,<br>
A nobler one than those;<br>
The tulip may not vie with it,<br>
Nor the dahlia, nor the rose.<br>
<br>
Its long broad leaves are spread<br>
Down curving to the ground;<br>
And I doubt if, as they grow,<br>
Four yards would span them round.<br>
<br>
One stem from out the centre<br>
Of those bright leaves ascends;<br>
As straight as is an arrow,<br>
It neither twists nor bends.<br>
<br>
Month after month it higher grew.<br>
We watched it day by day,<br>
Impatient to behold the flower<br>
In all its bright array.<br>
<br>
It grew above the cottage eaves,<br>
Full fifteen feet in height,<br>
Before one bud had shown a streak<br>
Of hidden treasure bright<br>
<br>
At length our wondering eyes beheld<br>
The tall stem richly crowned<br>
With silken-petalled lilies, all<br>
In one bright cluster bound.<br>
<br>
But not the pale and timid flowers<br>
Of northern climes are these;<br>
Not shrinking from the temp'rate sun,<br>
Nor trembling in the breeze.<br>
<br>
In robe of regal hues they're drest.<br>
And to our fervid sky<br>
With bold, unblenching gaze, is bent<br>
Each bright and glowing eye.<br>
<br>
They scorn to share with humbler flowers<br>
Kind Nature's smile or tear.<br>
And proudly above all their kin<br>
Their crowned heads uprear.<br>
<br>
In lofty, solitary state<br>
They ope, and fade away;<br>
Whilst far below, their scorned friends<br>
Dwell socially and gay.<br>
<br>
The bright pomegranate's smiles reflect<br>
The oleander's blush,<br>
And roseate passion-flowers lend<br>
Pale clematis a flush.<br>
<br>
The twining indigo enwreaths<br>
Full many a gentle flower,<br>
That dwell together lovingly<br>
In some acacia bower.<br>
<br>
The humble and the lowly, all<br>
Contented, happy, gay.<br>
Laugh on, whilst in their lonely pomp<br>
The lilies fade away.<br>
<br>
But think&mdash;how grand they are!<br>
How tall, and how arranged!<br>
How far beyond those little bells<br>
That tremble in the shade!<br>
<br>
Choose ye between the two&mdash;<br>
And then I'll truly tell<br>
If ye in lordly pride and pomp<br>
Or in happier love would dwell.]</p>

<p>Gardens in this neighbourhood might be small editions of
Paradise, had they sufficient and regular moisture; but the
uncertainty of the seasons, and the impossibility (not to mention
the expense) of supplying the deficiency by artificial means,
render the most industrious and anxious attention to them a source
of annoyance rather than pleasure. The <i>want of water</i> is a
drawback of which no dweller in England can imagine the curse. I
well remember my husband's admiration of our English rivers,
brooks, and the little narrow, trickling lines of bright water that
traverse our meadows and gardens; and when I used to laugh at so
much good enthusiasm being thrown away on a <i>ditch</i>, he would
say, "Ah! only wait until you have lived a few years in a dry
country, and then you will better understand the inestimable value
of such <i>ditches</i>!"</p>

<p>Our whole and sole dependence whilst at Homebush for a supply of
water on the estate consisted of two or three holes, like old
clay-pits, which were about half filled during heavy rains, and as
no shade was near them, very rapidly evaporated in warm weather. At
these the cattle and horses drank, and we had a water-cart to
convey the daily supply to the house; but in the heats of summer
these water-holes were completely dry, and then our unfortunate
cattle and horses were driven three or four miles to another
clay-pit, where we also sent the cart, with, of course, the
constant fear lest, with so many claimants on its bounty (for all
our neighbours were in as ill a plight as ourselves), even that
source should fail us too. Some of our friends were at the same
time sending five and eight miles for water, and <i>such</i> water!
I did indeed then bethink me of the English meadow <i>ditches</i>,
and how luxurious a draught their fair bright streamlets would
afford. And as I commiserated our poor cows and oxen, parching
amidst dry, brittle hay, for it were absurd to call it grass,
without a chance of slaking their thirst till their daily toilsome
pilgrimage along the dusty road, I used to think of the deep shady
rivers at home, where I have seen whole herds stand in the summer
noons with the rippling water often meeting over their sleek backs,
and green, juicy herbage nodding at them from the banks, and such a
world of luxury around as made the heat seem but a means for its
enjoyment.</p>

<p>I would have all discontented grumblers in England, who growl
alike at November fogs and April showers, and who always carry
umbrellas by way of an implied reproach to the seasons of their
native land&mdash;I would have all such sent to New South Wales on a
"probation" system: let them enjoy sunshine, since they like it so
much; let them really luxuriate in a veritably "dry atmosphere" for
a few years, and then see if their hydrophobia will not wonderfully
abate!</p>

<p>When a winter rainy fit does assail the sky in this land of
extremes, it certainly takes care to leave no doubt of its
intentions,&mdash;for down comes such a thorough, right-earnest deluge,
as not only washes away half your garden, but generally inundates
the house, parched and warped as every part is by the previous
baking process of the summer months. We enjoyed two visitations of
this kind at Homebush, each of about a week's duration, and giving
us the healthful advantage of an unexpected shower-bath in nearly
every room. Every imaginable vessel was enlisted in the
water-catching service; the tide in the clay-pits rose several
feet, and our spirits in proportion; but the old dry, exhausting
weather soon returned.</p>

<p>A large well in front of the house, which had been closed over,
excited our curiosity, for although we were told the water in it
was salt, still, at so considerable an elevation, this seemed
improbable, and we opened the well. To describe the anxious
excitement which pervaded the assembled household as the first
bucketful was slowly drawn up, were impossible&mdash;perhaps Wilkie
might have <i>painted</i> the scene, had he witnessed it: even our
favourite old pointer stood wagging his tail, and pretending to
lick his thirsty lips, as he by turns looked down into the well or
wistfully into my face:&mdash;the housemaid ran for a cup that "Missis
might taste first," but I was compelled to confess that the
singular variety of unpleasant flavours the liquid combined left me
quite in doubt whether it were salt or fresh.* Every one so
ardently wished it fresh, that very daring anticipations were
formed of the effect which the air might have on it, and various
other possibilities; but the experience of a week fully proved that
our labour had been in vain. When poured into the trough, some of
the pigs and one old horse used to drink the brackish water, but
for aught else, save washing kitchen-floors, it was useless. The
salt must have been derived from some saline beds in the soil, for
the bottom of the well, though very deep, was far above the
sea-level. Another half-closed well remained in one of the
orchards, showing that every pain had been taken to find good
water, but in vain.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Some years since, Mr. Meredith and an old
servant, being out together on some expedition, were seeking fresh
water near the coast, for themselves and their horses, and after
vainly trying the qualities of many small pools, Grodbold
dismounted to test another, but instantly began spitting out the
water again with a sad wry face. "Is <i>that</i> fresh?" inquired
my husband. "Fresh to <i>me</i>, Sir, for I never tasted any thing
so bad before!"]</p>

<p>After all my own grumblings at the climate of Sydney, which my
impaired health and languid frame proved to be not without reason,
I must give its two months of winter unqualified laudation, for
then existence is no longer a burthen, nor walking exercise
absolutely unpleasant. The early morning is often frosty, with a
light white rime on the grass and a bracing sharpness in the air,
making a bright fire very good company at breakfast-time. By nine
o'clock the frost entirely vanishes, and a warm sun and clear
Italian sky tempt us to desert the fire and sit by open windows, or
ramble about without even an additional shawl over a light morning
dress. Towards evening we begin to notice the darkness of the
hearth, and a pile of blazing logs merrily lights up the
dining-room. In some houses grates and Colonial coal are used as a
luxury, but after being accustomed to a cheerful, broad, good
humoured-looking hearth of logs, they seem to me very dull and
sulky by comparison. The coal which I have hitherto seen used is
less bright itself and emits less blaze than what we should term
good coal in my native county of Warwick. It comes, very
appropriately, from Newcastle, on the Hunter's River, a part of New
South Wales I much wished to visit, and had a land-journey been
easy, might perhaps have enjoyed the trip; but to make a sea
voyage, however short, for <i>pleasure</i>, is an anomalous
proceeding I cannot comprehend.</p>

<p>One great pleasure we enjoyed at this time, but have since been
wholly deprived of, was that of having plenty of books, as we
subscribed to the Australian Library in Sydney, and could send for
a fresh supply once or twice a week. We did not obtain many new
works of fiction, but of less fashionable literature, as
Biographies, History, Travels, &amp;c., we had abundance. Neither
were we by any means deficient in society, but, with a few
memorable exceptions, I soon found that Colonial ladies seldom
speak of aught besides dress, and domestic events and troubles,
"bad servants" being the staple topic. And most gentlemen have
their whole souls so felted up in wools, fleeces, flocks, and
stock, that I have often sat through a weary dinner and evening of
incessant talking, without hearing a single syllable on any other
subject. Some of our friends had been among the early adventurers
who made the perilous overland journeys to Adelaide, with large
herds of cattle and sheep, and their narratives were always highly
interesting, seeming like a romance, often a most sad one
too&mdash;after the dull wool-gatherings of more every-day people. Far
be it from me, in these slight remarks, to imply want of respect
for the worthy enthusiasts in wool; still there are times and
places for everything. In English society the lawyer does not carry
his brief and special pleadings into the drawing-room; the
physician dreams not of occupying the attention of a dinner-party
with his last wonderful cure; even the author refrains from
volunteering a recitation of his new book; and surely, according to
our old-world notions of propriety, the wool-merchant also should
sometimes divest himself of the "shop," and not be always
encompassed and engrossed by his bales and fleeces.</p>

<p>However fascinating may be the company of his "fine-woolled
sheep" and peerless breed of Merinos, he should not insist on
taking them out to dinner. I had to endure a perpetuity of mutton
in the wool; whilst choice "samples," tied and labelled with most
fond accuracy, were passed from hand to hand, and contemplated with
the profound and critical air of a connoisseur passing judgment on
a masterpiece of art. So long as the conversation conveyed
intelligence respecting different parts of the Colony, as connected
with sheep-farming or other occupations, I could derive amusement
and knowledge from it, but the eternity of wool, wool,
wool&mdash;wearied my very soul. Perhaps some excuse is admissible for
this unsocial style of conversation in Colonial gentlemen, from the
rarity of Colonial ladies who are disposed to take a part in any
topic under discussion, and many, though not disposed or qualified
to express an opinion on general subjects, would feel insulted if
you asked their advice how to make butter or cure a ham; thus
rendering it difficult to know what they would like to talk about
when the servant-stories are exhausted, which usually prove lengthy
and very circumstantial.</p>

<p>I alluded to "bad servants" as being a constant source of
complaint amongst my friends, and I am well aware that in most
families the relative comfort or discomfort may pretty nearly be
proportioned to the scarcity or number of servant-women in the
establishment. Free women usually demand such exorbitant wages, and
are here such apt illustrations of the proverb, "Evil
communications corrupt good manners," that the generality of
married persons apply for prisoner-women to be assigned to their
service. Among these, a few prove willing, good servants, some
tolerable, many very middling, and the largest portion totally
unfit for a respectable place, not only from their inability to do
good, but from their inherent propensities to do evil, every shape
of vice and depravity seeming as familiar to them as the air they
breathe. We were fortunate in having two decent emigrant families,
the men as head farm-servants, and their wives and one daughter as
cook, dairy-woman, and housemaid; being honest, sober, valuable
servants, I was thus spared much of the annoyance suffered by
others. I certainly had one very bad specimen in an old nurse, and
who, although free at the time of her being recommended to me, had
been doubly convicted formerly, and at the end of her five days'
sojourn carried off with her several articles of value; for at that
time I had not become accustomed to the vigilant care of my locks
and keys, which is imperatively necessary here, and was, to me,
extremely difficult to acquire. Having in various instances
purchased experience somewhat dearly, I have since made
considerable progress in this essential and troublesome
accomplishment, and now as systematically lock my drawers,
work-box, and other similar temptations, as if they were caskets of
untold diamonds.</p>

<p>Wine or strong liquor of any kind is never safely left
accessible to servants. The unlimited allowance of good beer common
in English households is here scarcely credited, nor could such a
custom be practised, for not a soul on the establishment would quit
the barrel so long as any liquor remained in it. Tea, at every
meal, is the Colonial kitchen beverage, with a good allowance of
Cape wine on extraordinary occasions; but the quantity of meat
eaten at least thrice a day may well compensate for the loss of
beer. The fryingpan is in perpetual requisition, and seems to have
scarcely time to cool between its performances; that, and a small
iron pot in which the tea and coarse sugar are boiled together,
form the sole cooking utensils of many a labourer's household: his
bread is "damper," baked in the ashes, and varied occasionally by a
"fat cake" done in the fryingpan, vegetables being rarely cared
about. In stock-keepers' huts, and others where candles are not
attainable, a light is procured by a bit of rag rolled up, stuck
into an old cup or pannican full of dripping, and lighted.
Home-made mould candles are generally used in houses where
wax-lights are dispensed with, and certainly vary more in quality
than any other article of domestic manufacture; but nothing beyond
common care and attention is required to make them equally good
with those sold by English chandlers.</p>

<p>Various circumstances having combined to determine us on
quitting New South Wales, and permanently settling in Van Diemen's
Land, we prepared for our removal thither and, in October, 1840,
again returned to Sydney for a few days which, as if to confirm my
dislike of the place and increase my joy at quitting it, were the
most disagreeable I had ever passed there. The heat, even at that
early period, was most oppressive, and the detestable mosquitoes
(with their horrible allies) besieged us in swarms, cruelly
tormenting my poor child, whose chubby face and fair fat arms were
covered with their mountainous bites, despite of all my care and
contrivances.</p>

<p>We embarked in a lumbering Colonial-built vessel named the
<i>Sir George Arthur</i> (since wrecked off Bermuda), and once more
passing the beautiful coves and bays of Port Jackson, sailed forth
through its mighty gates on our way to a new home in Tasmania.</p>
