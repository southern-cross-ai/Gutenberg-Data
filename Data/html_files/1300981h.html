  <h2><a id="intro"
     name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">APART from numerous novels, most of which are accessible
  on-line at Project Gutenberg Australia and Roy Glashan's Library, Fred M.
  White published some 300 short stories. Many of these were written in the
  form of series about the same character or group of characters. PGA/RGL has
  already published e-book editions of those series currently available in
  digital form.</p>

  <p>The present 17-volume edition of e-books is the first attempt to offer the
  reader a more-or-less comprehensive collection of Fred M. White's other short
  stories. These were harvested from a wide range of Internet resources and
  have already been published individually at Project Gutenberg Australia, in
  many cases with digitally-enhanced illustrations from the original medium of
  publication.</p>

  <p>From the bibliographic information preceding each story, the reader will
  notice that many of them were extracted from newspapers published in
  Australia and New Zealand. Credit for preparing e-texts of these and numerous
  other stories included in this collection goes to Lyn and Maurie Mulcahy, who
  contributed them to PGA in the course of a long and on-going
  collaboration.</p>

  <p>The stories included in the present collection are presented
  chronologically according to the publication date of the medium from which
  they were extracted. Since the stories from Australia and New Zealand
  presumably made their first appearance in British or American periodicals,
  the order in which they are given here does not correspond to the actual
  order of first publication.</p>

  <p>This collection contains some 170 stories, but a lot more of Fred M.
  White's short fiction was still unobtainable at the time of compilation
  (March 2013). Information about the "missing stories" is given in a
  bibliographic note at the end of this volume. Perhaps they can be included in
  supplemental volumes at a later date.</p>

  <p>Good reading!</p>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY ALEC BALL</h3>

  155-162</h3>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">THE tragic death of Lord Mornington, and the dramatic arrest
  of his nephew, Guy Windsor, in connection with the mysterious affair, formed
  one of the most exciting police episodes of last year. It will be just as
  well, perhaps, in the first instance, to set out the facts briefly and
  succinctly.</p>

  <p>As everybody remembers, the late Lord Mornington had been an eccentric
  nobleman, a great collector of works of art, and a man who was known to be
  enormously rich. But for his ungovernable temper and arbitrary manners he
  probably would have occupied a high place in politics. He was by no means
  popular. He had practically no friends. He was a confirmed mysogynist. He
  made no secret of the fact that he trusted no one, believed in no one, and
  suspected everybody of an inclination to rob him. The only individual who
  succeeded in any way in keeping on fair terms with his Lordship was a nephew
  of his, Eric Kearton by name. Kearton was a young man of the greatest
  respectability. He had an even temperament and was one of the meek and mild
  type of people who invariably wear spectacles, and have a weakness for
  University extension lectures and such serious frivolities. Probably because
  here was a man he could bully and browbeat, Lord Mornington had given this
  relative of his the ran of his cottage.</p>

  <p>It was near this cottage on the Yorkshire coast that the crime took place.
  From time to time Lord Mornington would quit London or his magnificent family
  seat near Chester, for a lonely spot on the Yorkshire coast, not very far
  from Hull, where he did entirely for himself, even to the cooking of his own
  food. He frequently stayed here for months, refusing to see anybody, with the
  exception of Kearton or Guy Windsor, and never so much as drawing a cheque.
  As a rule, when on these excursions, he drew three or four hundred pounds in
  cash, and used this till it was exhausted. The figure of the sturdy old man
  with his string bag and brown-paper parcels was a familiar one in Hull. It
  was quite a usual thing to see him striding out of the town with half-a-dozen
  herrings in one hand and a packet of groceries in the other. People had come
  to take Mornington quite as a matter of course, so that he was left to the
  solitude which he seemed to desire.</p>

  <p>The old man's title devolved naturally upon his nephew Guy. But the
  estates were not entailed, and Lord Mornington could leave his property where
  he pleased. He had been understood to say that he meant to will it all to
  charities, but he was precisely the kind of man who dies eventually without
  making a will at all, thus enabling his legal heirs to come into their own at
  last.</p>

  <p>In the meantime both nephews were poor enough. There was nothing wrong
  about Guy Windsor, but he appeared disinclined to settle down to anything; he
  spent most of his time in idle pleasure, and frequently knew what it was to
  be hard up for a sovereign. It was just at this time that affairs reached a
  crisis, and he conceived the idea of calling upon his uncle for assistance.
  The upshot was inevitable. The old man refused the request in the coarsest
  and plainest terms, and Guy Windsor, who was anything but a prudent young
  man, lost his temper and made use of threats which, unfortunately, were
  overheard by other people. The same day he left the cottage, saying that he
  was going to Hull on particular business, and that he meant to cross over to
  Holland the next day. An hour or two later, Eric Kearton, who had finished
  some literary work for his uncle, left the neighbourhood also, with a view to
  going over the Border for a day or two's fishing in one of the Scottish
  trout-streams.</p>

  <p>At eleven o'clock the next morning the body of Lord Mornington was found
  in a thick mass of furze on a lonely spot near the edge of the cliffs. The
  cliffs were high and rugged here, portions of them were cut off from the
  mainland in the shape of spurs and rugged promontories, and here the
  sea-birds nested in great quantities. The spurs were almost inaccessible,
  therefore there were many rare and curious birds here which were not seen
  elsewhere, and which had become nearly extinct in the British Isles. It was
  one of the bird-hunters who found the body of the murdered man.</p>

  <p>That he had been murdered there was no doubt. He lay on his back within a
  few feet of the edge of the cliff just away from a screen of gorse bushes.
  There was a deep stab over the region of the heart, wdiich had been fatal in
  its effect. So far as the police could judge, robbery was not the motive, for
  the old man's purse and watch and rings were intact; his papers had not been
  disturbed. The whole thing caused the greatest excitement in the
  neighbourhood, which excitement was doubled later on in the day as the
  intelligence came to hand that Guy Windsor had been arrested in Hull and
  charged with the commission of the crime. His threats were remembered now,
  and, what was more to the point, he had in his possession over three hundred
  pounds in gold, while only the day before he was known to be absolutely
  penniless. The young man had protested vigorously against the action of the
  police. He told an almost impossible story to account for the possession of
  so much money. He had been chosen&mdash;or so he said &mdash;by an old friend
  of his family to go to St. Petersburg at once, with a view to saving an
  Englishman there from serious disgrace. It was only a matter of hours,
  Windsor said. It was necessary that the money should be placed in the
  mysterious individual's hands, or a well-known family would be dishonoured.
  In ordinary circumstances this explanation would pass easily enough, but it
  was not good enough for the police. From their point of view it merely made
  matters worse.</p>

  <p>It was in vain that Windsor raved and protested&mdash;in vain that he
  offered to find surety for his appearance. But the police were deaf to all
  his entreaties, and the next morning Guy Windsor was brought before the local
  magistrate charged with being concerned in the death of Lord Mornington.
  There was little or no evidence at the first hearing, but the police promised
  to bring forward further testimony, and Windsor was removed in custody till
  the next day.</p>

  <p>As was only natural in the circumstances, the affair caused a tremendous
  sensation. The next day's papers teemed with details. The news was flashed
  from one end of the country to the other. In a few hours the whole nation was
  discussing the death of Lord Mornington.</p>

  <p>From the first it was felt that the police had put their hands upon the
  guilty man.</p>

  <p>Guy Windsor did not look in the least like a criminal as he stood in the
  dock the next morning. He listened with more or less impatience to the police
  evidence. The case dragged itself wearily along. One witness after another
  came forward, but the packed audience seemed to be doomed to disappointment
  in their expectations. It was nearly two o'clock before the chairman of the
  Bench hinted that the case had better be further adjourned, whereupon the
  barrister who defended the prisoner protested.</p>

  <p>"At any rate, your Worships, I must ask for bail," he said. "I am prepared
  to admit that appearances are against my client, but nothing has actually
  been proved against him yet. And there is nothing to connect liim with the
  crime."</p>

  <p>"The possession of all that money," the chairman suggested, "The prisoner
  is a poor man?"</p>

  <p>"We can account for that," the lawyer said. "Professor Stewart, the
  eminent naturalist, will come down and give evidence on Tuesday, if
  necessary, and he will tell you exactly where the three hundred pounds found
  on my client came from. We shall prove that not a penny of it was ever in the
  possession of Lord Mornington. It is on these grounds that we demand
  bail."</p>

  <p>There was a stir amongst the audience at this. Professor Stewart was a man
  of world-wide reputation. As an authority on birds and their habits he stood
  unrivalled. For the last three or four months he had more or less lived upon
  the cliffs, and Guy Windsor had been his constant companion. There was a
  certain amount of risk and hazard attached, which appealed to a young man of
  sporting instincts, and the great ornithologist had found him invaluable.</p>

  <p>"And why is not Professor Stewart here?" the chairman asked. "He was in
  the neighbourhood two days ago."</p>

  <p>Counsel for the prisoner proceeded to explain. The Professor had had some
  trouble with his bird-camera. He had gone off hot-foot to set it right.
  Besides, there were a lot of plates which he had recently exposed that he
  wished to have developed. They were still elaborating this point when
  Windsor's solicitor rushed into court, evidently labouring under some great
  excitement. He raised a telegram above his head.</p>

  <p>"I have just heard from Professor Stewart," he cried. "I have had this
  long telegram from him. I know this interruption is out of order, your
  Worships, and I hope you will pardon me. Professor Stewart wires that he has
  just read all about the case, and that if you will adjourn till Tuesday, he
  pledges his word to bring forward such evidence as will clear the accused
  beyond the shadow of a doubt. You may see the telegram for yoursslves."</p>

  <p>The flimsy paper was passed from hand to hand along the Bench, and each of
  the magistrates scanned it gravely. It was quite evident that the contents of
  the telegram had shaken them in their certainty of the prisoner's guilt. A
  man with the unrivalled reputation of Professor Stewart would scarcely have
  indited a message like that unless he had been absolutely sure of his ground.
  Not the least pregnant part of the telegram was the concluding line to the
  effect that the money found on the prisoner had been paid to him by the
  Professor himself, and that it was on the Professor's business that Windsor
  was going to St. Petersburg.</p>

  <p>"After that," counsel said in tones of quiet triumph, "my application for
  bail must succeed. I will ask for an adjournment till Tuesday, so as to
  enable Professor Stewart to make all the necessary arrangements. Meanwhile,
  my client can get to St. Petersburg and back by that time."</p>

  <p>"We shall want substantial bail," the chairman said hesitatingly. "Two
  securities of five thousand each."</p>

  <p>The securities were tendered on the spot, and Guy Windsor left the court
  with his friends. To a certain extent the whole thing was irregular, but then
  the moral pressure was great, and just for a moment the police authorities
  were too staggered to protest. Naturally enough, this strange and startling
  evidence gave a new fillip to the interest which had been taken in the
  Mornington tragedy. It was late the same night before Professor Stewart
  returned to his own quarters, which consisted of rooms in a farmhouse on the
  side of the cliff. Amongst the distinguished man's first visitors was the
  inspector of police.</p>

  <p>"I hope you won't mind my troubling you, sir," Inspector Wild said, "but I
  am greatly worried over this case. I wish to be fair. But the Bench had no
  business to grant that bail this morning. Of course, if you really think that
  your evidence will be conclusive--"</p>

  <p>"I don't think anything about it," the Professor said, with a gleam behind
  his spectacles. "I am absolutely certain. On Tuesday morning I shall prove
  beyond the shadow of a doubt that Mr. Guy Windsor is absolutely innocent,
  which ought to satisfy even your scruples. But I shall go further than that.
  I shall be able to point out the actual murderer and hand him over to your
  custody. The whole proofs form a strange instance of the power of modern
  science, aided by a distinct intervention on the part of Providence. Now, my
  dear inspector, do you know anything about birds?"</p>

  <p>"Well, no," said the inspector, somewhat disconcerted, "though I had a
  fine collection of eggs when I was a boy."</p>

  <p>"Ah, in that case, you know most of the rare feathered visitors here,
  then. Did you ever hear, for instance, of a beautiful bird called the
  Swallows-tailed Kite?"</p>

  <p>"He was a tradition when I was a boy," the inspector said. "But I don't
  think one of them has been seen for years. They are extinct."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, a pair of these birds are at present nesting on Steeple
  Crag. Steeple Crag, as you are aware, is one of the sharp spurs of cliff just
  off the mainland, where the body of Lord Mornington was found. I have seen
  them for myself, and between ourselves, if those birds hadn't been there, it
  is highly probable that young Guy Windsor would have been hanged for a crime
  he never committed. Now you can go home to supper and work the matter out for
  yourself. You won't get a single word out of me till Tuesday."</p>

  <p>Left to himself, the Professor proceeded to the impromptu dark-room which
  he had made for himself in one of the cellars of the farmhouse. Apparently
  his work pleased him, for he returned presently with a bundle of photographs
  in his hand which he proceeded to lock carefully away in his safe. The whole
  of the next day he appeared to be closely occupied with his bird studies on
  the cliffs, but in reality he was searching for something which he appeared
  to have some difficulty in finding. He came upon it presently in a rugged
  cart-track leading to the heart of the moors, and then he chuckled to himself
  as he followed the trail till he struck a deserted road facing due north. He
  walked down to the village and despatched half-a-dozen telegrams. It was
  nearly midnight before a powerful-looking motor drove up in front of the
  farmhouse, and Stewart came out without delay. He was used to coming and
  going in this way, so that the farmer and his wife expressed no surprise.</p>

  <p>Late on Monday evening, before Stewart returned, when he got into his
  rooms, he found Eric Kearton awaiting him. The latter appeared to be somewhat
  nervous and excitable. He removed his spectacles from time to time and wiped
  them, as if the beads of moisture thereon interfered with his sight.</p>

  <p>"I came to see you. Professor," he said, "in response to your telegram. I
  am afraid that my evidence will not be of the slightest use; and if I gave
  it, I should probably do poor Guy more harm than good. You see, I left here
  very early on the day of the tragedy, and I have been fishing ever
  since."</p>

  <p>"One never can tell," the Professor said cheerfully. "You see, I happen to
  know something, and I don't agree with you. Between ourselves, we shall
  manage to get Windsor off with flying colours. Now, you see if I don't prove
  to be a true prophet."</p>

  <p>Once more Kearton wiped his spectacles nervously.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">NATURALLY enough the little court-house was crammed to
  suffocation when Guy Windsor surrendered to his bail on Tuesday morning.
  People had come from far and near. Most of the leading newspapers had sent
  special reporters. The expectation of something out of the common did not
  appear likely to be gratified at first, for the prosecution began by the
  calling of Eric Kearton. Anything less like tragedy or anything more like
  middle-class mediocrity it was impossible to imagine. The shy little man
  stood in the witness-box wiping his spectacles nervously. The reporters leant
  back in their seats and studied the quaint rafters of the old Sessions House.
  Here was more material for descriptive matter than they were likely to make
  out of the witness.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, Eric Kearton had very little to say. He could testify
  to the fact that Lord Mornington and Guy Windsor were not on the best of
  terms. He had been present and had heard most of the quarrel between the
  deceased and the accused man. At the end of a quarter of an hour counsel for
  the Crown waved the witness aside with an air of more or less contempt, and
  intimated that he might stand down. With a look of intense relief on his
  face, Kearton prepared to leave the witness-box.</p>

  <p>"One moment, please," the defending barrister said suavely. "I should like
  to ask you a few questions. For instance, are you a single or a married
  man?"</p>

  <p>A sudden hush fell upon the assembled spectators. Some instinct seemed to
  tell them that they were on the verge of the sensational. The reporters took
  up their pencils again.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I beg your pardon," Kearton stammered.</p>

  <p>"I asked you a plain question. Are you married or not?"</p>

  <p>"I don't see," the witness said hesitatingly, "why--"</p>

  <p>"Are you married or not?" counsel thundered.</p>

  <p>The witness was understood to say that he was. He glanced in a timid,
  apprehensive way at his tormentor.</p>

  <p>"Very good," the latter went on. "You are a married man. I put it to you
  that yours is a secret marriage, and that none of your friends know anything
  about it. I put it to you that you had good reason for concealing the fact
  from Lord Mornington."</p>

  <p>"I deemed it wiser," Kearton murmured.</p>

  <p>"Very good. I understand that your wife is a variety actress."</p>

  <p>"That is so," the witness replied.</p>

  <p>"Ah, well, now we understand. A secret marriage which had to be kept from
  your relative. You naturally had hopes of sharing some of his money? You know
  perfectly well that if you had disclosed the fact that you had made a
  <i>mésalliance</i> of this kind, you would never have been under your uncle's
  roof again?"</p>

  <p>"There is no harm in it," the witness pleaded.</p>

  <p>"Oh, certainly not," counsel said drily. "Are you on friendly terms with
  your wife? Haven't you rather neglected her of late? And didn't she threaten
  to write to Lord Mornington? As a matter of fact, now, didn't a letter from
  her to Lord Mornington arrive the day before his death? Now, please be
  careful, because I know what I am talking about, and I want a plain
  answer."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I believe so," Kearton confessed.</p>

  <p>"Thank you. Now, we will go a little further. Early on the morning of Lord
  Mornington's death, or late the night before, you went north for the purpose
  of fishing. I understand that till late last night you did not return to this
  neighbourhood. Now, sir, on your oath, are you prepared to swear that you
  were nowhere in the neighbourhood on the day the crime was committed?"</p>

    <img src="1300981h-images/TheEyeOfTheCamera1.jpg"
         title="'Are you prepared to swear...">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Certainly I was not!" the witness cried.</p>

  <p>"Very well. Now, how did you go to Scotland, and how did you return? I
  mean in what way did you travel?"</p>

  <p>"Why, in the ordinary way. By train, of course."</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed! You didn't go either way by motor, I suppose? You didn't hire
  a motor in the first instance to take you to Scotland?"</p>

  <p>The witness shook his head, but did not speak.</p>

  <p>"In that case," the counsel went on, "you have never heard of Messrs.
  Greatorex, of Hull, the motor-garage people?"</p>

  <p>Again the witness shook his head. He seemed bereft of the power of speech.
  He wiped his spectacles again.</p>

  <p>"I have no further questions to ask for the present," the counsel said. "I
  shall be able to prove to your Worships later on that the witness hired a
  motor-car to take him to Scotland and bring him back again, and that he was
  actually seen within ten miles of here within an hour or so of Lord
  Mornington's death. It will save a great deal of time and trouble if I place
  Professor Stewart in the box without further delay. I rely upon him entirely
  to prove my case for me. Call Professor Stewart, please."</p>

  <p>There was no studying the carved roof of the Sessions House now, for
  everybody was on the tiptoe of expectation. It was felt that here was a
  startling development which might change the whole current of public opinion.
  The Professor stepped into the box coolly and confidently. There was nothing
  in his manner to indicate what was going to take place.</p>

  <p>"I believe you are a friend of the accused?" counsel asked.</p>

  <p>"I know him very well, indeed," the Professor replied.</p>

  <p>"And you have formed some estimate of his character, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Well, yes, sir. He is a most intelligent young man. He takes a great
  interest in outdoor life and pursuits. I have found him very keen in regard
  to natural history; indeed, he has been of the greatest assistance to me in
  my study of bird life and in taking my photographs. I cannot speak too highly
  of him."</p>

  <p>"You have found him trustworthy and reliable?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear me, yes. Unfortunately Mr. Windsor has no inclination for indoor
  work. This is possibly his misfortune more than his fault. He has been
  brought up to do nothing, but I emphatically deny that he is the loafer that
  Lord Mornington took him to be. I have, besides, the highest opinion of his
  integrity."</p>

  <p>"For instance, you would trust him with money?"</p>

  <p>"I have already done so, sir," the Professor said calmly. "It was on
  behalf of a relative of mine that Mr. Windsor took his trip to St. Petersburg
  last vfeek. It was absolutely necessary that a certain young man should have
  the sum of three hundred pounds placed in his hands within something like
  twenty -four hours. You will excuse me going into details. As I could not
  undertake the journey myself, I asked Mr. Windsor to do so. The money found
  in his possession at the time of his arrest was paid over to him by me, and I
  can produce the cheque, which was cashed into sovereigns in Hull, if the
  Court would care to see it. For obvious reasons I must decline to give the
  name of the drawer."</p>

  <p>Something like a mild sensation foUowed this statement. It was felt that
  one of the main props of the prosecution had been knocked away, and that the
  Crown case was considerably weakened. Everybody listened closely now.</p>

  <p>"I don't think that will be necessary," counsel went on. "I understand.
  Professor, that you can tell us a good deal more about this matter. You have
  formed a theory--"</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," the Professor interrupted. "I have no theories at
  all. What I shall lay before the Court is actual fact. I wish to produce, for
  the consideration of the Bench, a photograph which will establish beyond
  doubt the identity of the murderer."</p>

  <p>"One moment," Windsor's lawyer said. "Touching this photograph, is it one
  that you took yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Well, more or less," the Professor explained. "But perhaps I had better
  go into details. I have been fortunate enough since I have been here to
  obtain photographs of many rare birds that nest on the spurs and crags just
  off the mainland. These birds are perfectly safe where they are, for they can
  lay their eggs with impunity, a fact which doubtless brings so many of them
  here. A little time ago, and by the aid of my glasses, I saw that a pair of
  Swallow-tailed Kites were actually nesting upon Steeple Crag. I determined,
  by hook or by crook, to get a photograph of these birds.'</p>

  <p>"How did you manage it?" counsel asked.</p>

  <p>"I am just coming to that. Having located the exact nesting-spot, with the
  aid of an air-gun, I threw a fine line right across some bushes on the edge
  of the nest; in fact, I threw half-a-dozen of these lines, the ends of which
  were attached by a string to the shutter of my special camera by means of
  which I take these photographs. The Kites were so wild that it was useless
  for me to try and snap them myself. Therefore I hid my camera in a bunch of
  gorse bushes, with all my mechanical arrangements perfectly made, so that
  directly one of the birds dropped upon one of the strings the shutter would
  be released and the successful exposure made."</p>

  <p>"Where was the camera placed?" counsel asked.</p>

  <p>"In a patch of gorse bushes some twenty yards from the edge of the
  cliff."</p>

  <p>"Leaving plenty of room for anybody to pass by, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, certainly; you see, I had to run the risk of that. The string was
  only the matter of a few inches from the ground, and anybody who had gone
  that way might have stumbled over it."</p>

  <p>"And thus released the shutter, which possibly might have ended in the
  passer-by taking his own photograph."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," the Professor said in quiet tones. "Any wanderer kicking his
  foot against the string could easily have taken his own photograph. If he had
  fallen heavily on the string, he probably would have pulled the camera down,
  and there would have been an end of my experiments for the time being."</p>

  <p>"And did anything of the kind happen?" counsel asked.</p>

  <p>"Something of the kind did take place," the Professor said solemnly. "When
  I went to regain possession of my camera, I found it lying face downwards in
  the bushes, and the plate had evidently been exposed. At first I naturally
  concluded that someone blundering along had done this, and I made my plans to
  lay my trap again. But certain information had come to my ears in the
  meantime, and it occurred to me that possibly the one exposed plate would
  tell me something which would throw a light upon the tragic death of Lord
  Mornington. You see, it so happens that his Lordship's body was picked up
  just in front of the gorse bushes where I had planted my special camera.
  Don't let Mr. Kearton go!"</p>

  <p>The last words were uttered in a quick, impatient tone of voice. The
  disappearing figure of Kearton had paused in the doorway.</p>

  <p>He muttered some excuse as he came back to his seat again. He was wiping
  his spectacles with trembling hands.</p>

  <p>A queer sort of cry escaped Kearton's lips. The man in the dock stood
  there gripping the rails with convulsive force. As the Professor handed up to
  the Bench a glass negative and some printed photographs, there was a silence
  in the court-house which was absolutely felt.</p>

  <p>It was a forcible and dramatic picture that was thus presented for
  inspection. In the background were the rugged cliffs with the spur of Steeple
  Crag standing out rude and ragged, the nesting birds upon it were visible
  from every part of the room. In the foreground were patches of gorse, and
  beyond a square of flat, even turf dotted with sea-pinks. In the centre of
  this stood two men, one old and grey, the other young and slender, his pale
  features set and white, his eyes half hidden behind spectacles. The old man
  had staggered back almost to his fall, his right arm was upraised to ward off
  a blow from the younger man, whose right hand was drawn back with a long
  knife held in his fingers. A spontaneous and startled cry broke from the
  spectators who lived in the locality. They had not the slightest difficulty
  in recognising the reeling figure of Lord Mornington, or in making out the
  features of his nephew, Eric Kearton. The photograph spoke for itself. It
  seemed to the onlookers that they were actually present at the tragedy which
  had excited the whole of England.</p>

         title="The old man had staggered back.">
  </div>

  <p>Windsor's lawyer looked appealingly at the Bench and shrugged his
  shoulders. It would have been an anti-climax now for him to say anything. As
  if by instinct two policemen walked across the court and stood on either side
  of Kearton. He swayed backwards and forwards with his hand to his throat, as
  if something were choking him. With a queer, strangled cry he fell to the
  ground and lay there still and unconscious...</p>

  <p>"A close call that," said Windsor's counsel half an hour later, as he sat
  at lunch with his client and the Professor. "Altogether it was a lucky thing
  for my young friend here."</p>

  <p>"Lucky!" the Professor cried. "I should call it a direct intervention of
  Providence."</p><br>

     name="story2">2.&mdash;THE NIGHT EXPRESS</a>&lt;&lt;br&gt; <small>THE
     STORY OF A BANK ROBBERY</small></h2>

  <h3>Published in<br>
  <i>Golden Stories: A Selection of the Best Fiction by the Foremost
  Writers</i>,<br>
  The Short Stories Company, New York, 1909</h3><br>

  <p class="first">A PELTING rain volleyed against the great glass dome of the
  terminus, a roaring wind boomed in the roof. Passengers, hurrying along the
  platform, glistened in big coats and tweed caps pulled close over their ears.
  By the platform the night express was drawn up&mdash;a glittering mass of
  green and gold, shimmering with electric lights, warm, inviting, and
  cozy.</p>

  <p>Most of the corridor carriages and sleeping berths were full, for it was
  early in October still, and the Scotch exodus was not just yet. A few late
  comers were looking anxiously out for the guard. He came presently, an alert
  figure in blue and silver. Really, he was very sorry. But the train was
  unusually crowded, and he was doing the best he could. He was perfectly aware
  of the fact that his questioners represented a Cabinet Minister on his way to
  Balmoral and a prominent Lothian baronet, but there are limits even to the
  power of an express guard, on the Grand Coast Railway.</p>

  <p>"Well, what's the matter with this?" the Minister demanded. "Here is an
  ordinary first-class coach that will do very well for us. Now, Catesby,
  unlock one of these doors and turn the lights on."</p>

  <p>"Very sorry, my lord," the guard explained, "but it can't be done. Two of
  the carriages in the coach are quite full, as you see, and the other two are
  reserved. As a matter of fact, my lord, we are taking a body down to
  Lydmouth. Gentleman who is going to be buried there. And the other carriage
  is for the Imperial Bank of Scotland. Cashier going up north with specie, you
  understand."</p>

  <p>It was all plain enough, and disgustingly logical. To intrude upon the
  presence of a body was perfectly impossible; to try and force the hand of the
  bank cashier equally out of the question. As head of a great financial house,
  the Minister knew that. A platform inspector bustled along presently, with
  his hand to his gold-laced cap.</p>

  <p>"Saloon carriage being coupled up behind, my lord," he said.</p>

  <p>The problem was solved. The guard glanced at his watch. It seemed to him
  that both the bank messenger and the undertaker were cutting it fine. The
  coffin came presently on a hand-truck&mdash;a black velvet pall lay over it,
  and on the sombre cloth a wreath or two of white lilies. The door of the
  carriage was closed presently, and the blinds drawn discreetly close.
  Following behind this came a barrow in charge of a couple of platform police.
  On the barrow were two square deal boxes, heavy out of all proportion to
  their size. These were deposited presently to the satisfaction of a little
  nervous-looking man in gold- rimmed glasses. Mr. George Skidmore, of the
  Imperial Bank, had his share of ordinary courage, but he had an imagination,
  too, and he particularly disliked these periodical trips to branch banks, in
  convoy, so to speak. He took no risks.</p>

  <p>"Awful night, sir," the guard observed. "Rather lucky to get a carriage to
  yourself, sir. Don't suppose you would have done so only we're taking a
  corpse as far as Lydmouth, which is our first stop."</p>

  <p>"Really?" Skidmore said carelessly. "Ill wind that blows nobody good,
  Catesby. I may be overcautious, but I much prefer a carriage to myself. And
  my people prefer it, too. That's why we always give the railway authorities a
  few days' notice. One can't be too careful, Catesby."</p>

  <p>The guard supposed not. He was slightly, yet discreetly, amused to see Mr.
  Skidmore glance under the seats of the first-class carriage. Certainly there
  was nobody either there or on the racks. The carriage at the far side was
  locked, and so, now, was the door next the platform. The great glass dome was
  brilliantly lighted so that anything suspicious would have been detected
  instantly. The guard's whistle rang out shrill and clear, and Catesby had a
  glimpse of Mr. Skidmore making himself comfortable as he swung himself into
  his van. The great green and gold serpent with the brilliant electric eyes
  fought its way sinuously into the throat of the wet and riotous night on its
  first stage of over two hundred miles. Lydmouth would be the first stop.</p>

  <p>So far Mr. Skidmore had nothing to worry him, nothing, that is, except the
  outside chance of a bad accident. He did not anticipate, however, that some
  miscreant might deliberately wreck the train on the off chance of looting
  those plain deal boxes. The class of thief that banks have to fear is not
  guilty of such clumsiness. Unquestionably nothing could happen on this side
  of Lydmouth. The train was roaring along now through the fierce gale at sixty
  odd miles an hour, Skidmore had the carriage to himself, and was not the
  snug, brilliantly lighted compartment made of steel? On one side was the
  carriage with the coffin; on the other side another compartment filled with a
  party of sportsmen going North. Skidmore had noticed the four of them playing
  bridge just before he slipped into his own carriage. Really, he had nothing
  to fear. He lay back comfortably wondering how Poe or Gaboriau would have
  handled such a situation with a successful robbery behind it. There are
  limits, of course, both to a novelist's imagination and a clever thief's
  process of invention. So, therefore....</p>

  <p>Three hours and twenty minutes later the express pulled up at Lydmouth.
  The station clock indicated the hour to be 11.23. Catesby swung himself out
  of his van on to the shining wet platform. Only one passenger was waiting
  there, but nobody alighted. Catesby was sure of this, because he was on the
  flags before a door could be opened. He came forward to give a hand with the
  coffin in the compartment next to Skidmore's. Then he noticed, to his
  surprise, that the glass in the carriage window was smashed; he could see
  that the little cashier was huddled up strangely in one corner. And Catesby
  could see also that the two boxes of bullion were gone!</p>

  <p>Catesby's heart was thumping against his ribs as he fumbled with his key.
  He laid his hand upon Skidmore's shoulder, but the latter did not move. The
  fair hair hung in a mass on the side of his forehead, and here it was fair no
  longer. There was a hole with something horribly red and slimy oozing from
  it. The carpet on the floor was piled up in a heap; there were red smears on
  the cushions. It was quite evident that a struggle had taken place here. The
  shattered glass in the window testified to that. And the boxes were gone, and
  Skidmore had been murdered by some assailant who had shot him through the
  brain. And this mysterious antagonist had got off with the bullion, too.</p>

  <p>A thing incredible, amazing, impossible; but there it was. By some
  extraordinary method or another the audacious criminal had boarded an express
  train traveling at sixty miles an hour in the teeth of a gale. He had
  contrived to enter the cashier's carriage and remove specie to the amount of
  eight thousand pounds! It was impossible that only one man could have carried
  it. But all the same it was gone.</p>

  <p>Catesby pulled himself together. He was perfectly certain that nobody at
  present on the train had been guilty of this thing. He was perfectly certain
  that nobody had left the train. Nobody could have done so after entering the
  station without the guard's knowledge, and to have attempted such a thing on
  the far side of the river bridge would have been certain death to anybody.
  There was a long viaduct here&mdash;posts and pillars and chains, with
  tragedy lurking anywhere for the madman who attempted such a thing. And until
  the viaduct was reached the express had not slackened speed. Besides, the
  thief who had the courage and intelligence and daring to carry out a robbery
  like this was not the man to leave an express train traveling at a speed of
  upwards of sixty miles an hour.</p>

  <p>The train had to proceed, there was no help for it. There was a hurried
  conference between Catesby and the stationmaster; after that the electric
  lamps in the dead man's carriage were unshipped, and the blinds pulled down.
  The matter would be fully investigated when Edinburgh was reached, meanwhile
  the stationmaster at Lydmouth would telephone the Scotch capital and let them
  know there what they had to expect. Catesby crept into his van again, very
  queer and dizzy, and with a sensation in his legs suggestive of creeping
  paralysis.</p>

  <p>Naturally, the mystery of the night express caused a great sensation.
  Nothing like it had been known since the great crime on the South Coast,
  which is connected with the name of Lefroy. But that was not so much a
  mystery as a man hunt. There the criminal had been identified. But here there
  was no trace and no clue whatever. It was in vain that the Scotland Yard
  authorities tried to shake the evidence of the guard, Catesby. He refused to
  make any admissions that would permit the police even to build up a theory.
  He was absolutely certain that Mr. Skidmore had been alone in the carriage at
  the moment that the express left London; he was absolutely certain that he
  had locked the door of the compartment, and the engine driver could testify
  that the train had never traveled at a less speed than sixty miles an hour
  until the bridge over the river leading into Lydmouth station was reached;
  even then nobody could have dropped off the train without the risk of certain
  death. Inspector Merrick was bound to admit this himself when he went over
  the spot. And the problem of the missing bullion boxes was quite as puzzling
  in its way as the mysterious way in which Mr. Skidmore had met his death.</p>

  <p>There was no clue to this either. Certainly there had been a struggle, or
  there would not have been blood marks all over the place, and the window
  would have remained intact. Skidmore had probably been forced back into his
  seat, or he had collapsed there after the fatal shot was fired. The
  unfortunate man had been shot through the brain with an ordinary revolver of
  common pattern, so that for the purpose of proof the bullet was useless.
  There were no finger marks on the carriage door, a proof that the murderer
  had either worn gloves or that he had carefully removed all traces with a
  cloth of some kind. It was obvious, too, that a criminal of this class would
  take no risks, especially as there was no chance of his being hurried, seeing
  that he had had three clear hours for his work. The more the police went into
  the matter, the more puzzled they were. It was not a difficult matter to
  establish the bona fides of the passengers who traveled in the next coach
  with Skidmore, and as to the rest it did not matter. Nobody could possibly
  have left any of the corridor coaches without attracting notice; indeed, the
  very suggestion was absurd. And there the matter rested for three days.</p>

  <p>It must not be supposed that the authorities had been altogether idle.
  Inspector Merrick spent most of his time traveling up and down the line by
  slow local trains on the off-chance of hearing some significant incident that
  might lead to a clue. There was one thing obvious&mdash;the bullion boxes
  must have been thrown off the train at some spot arranged between the active
  thief and his confederates. For this was too big a thing to be entirely the
  work of one man. Some of the gang must have been waiting along the line in
  readiness to receive the boxes and carry them to a place of safety. By this
  time, no doubt, the boxes themselves had been destroyed; but eight thousand
  pounds in gold takes some moving, and probably a conveyance, a motor for
  choice, had been employed for this purpose. But nobody appeared to have seen
  or heard anything suspicious on the night of the murder; no prowling
  gamekeeper or watcher had noticed anything out of the common. Along the Essex
  and Norfolk marshes, where the Grand Coast Railway wound along like a steel
  snake, they had taken their desolate and dreary way. True, the dead body of a
  man had been found in the fowling nets up in the mouth of the Little Ouse,
  and nobody seemed to know who he was; but there could be no connection
  between this unhappy individual and the express criminal. Merrick shook his
  head as he listened to this from a laborer in a roadside public house where
  he was making a frugal lunch on bread and cheese.</p>

  <p>"What do you call fowling nets?" Merrick asked.</p>

  <p>"Why, what they catches the birds in," the rustic explained. "Thousands
  and thousands of duck and teel and widgeon they catches at this time of year.
  There's miles of nets along the road&mdash;great big nets like fowl runs. Ye
  didn't happen to see any on 'em as ye came along in the train?"</p>

  <p>"Now I come to think of it, yes," Merrick said thoughtfully. "I was rather
  struck by all that netting. So they catch sea birds that way?"</p>

  <p>"Catches 'em by the thousand, they does. Birds fly against the netting in
  the dark and get entangled. Ducks they get by 'ticing 'em into a sort of cage
  with decoys. There's some of 'em stan's the best part of half a mile long.
  Covered in over the top like great cages. Ain't bad sport, either."</p>

  <p>Merrick nodded. He recollected it all clearly now. He recalled the wide,
  desolate mud flats running right up to the railway embankment for some miles.
  At high tide the mud flats were under water, and out of these the great mass
  of network rose both horizontally and perpendicular. And in this tangle the
  dead body of a man had been found after the storm.</p>

  <p>There was nothing really significant in the fact that the body had been
  discovered soon after the murder of Mr. George Skidmore. Still, there might
  be a connection between the two incidents. Merrick was going to make
  inquiries; he was after what looked like a million to one chance. But then
  Merrick was a detective with an imagination, which was one of the reasons why
  he had been appointed to the job. It was essentially a case for the
  theoretical man. It baffled all the established rules of the game.</p>

  <p>Late the same afternoon Merrick arrived at Little Warlingham by means of a
  baker's cart. It was here that the body of the drowned man lay awaiting the
  slim chances of identity. If nothing transpired during the next eight and
  forty hours, the corpse would be buried by the parish authorities. The
  village policeman acted as Merrick's guide. It was an event in his life that
  he was not likely to forget.</p>

  <p>"A stranger to these parts, I should say, sir," the local officer said.
  "He's in a shed at the back of the 'Blue Anchor,' where the inquest was held.
  If you come this way, I'll show him to you."</p>

  <p>"Anything found on the body?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely nothing, sir. No mark on the clothing or linen, either.
  Probably washed off some ship in the storm. Pockets were quite empty, too.
  And no signs of foul play. There you are, sir!"</p>

  <p>Casually enough Merrick bent over the still, white form lying there. The
  dead face was turned up to the light, Rembrandtesque, coming through the
  door. The detective straightened himself suddenly, and wiped his
  forehead.</p>

  <p>"Stranger to you, sir, of course?" the local man said grimly.</p>

  <p>"Well, no," Merrick retorted. "I happen to know the fellow quite well. I'm
  glad I came here."</p>

  <p>Until it was quite too dark to see any longer Merrick was out on the mud
  flats asking questions. He appeared to be greatly interested in the
  wildfowlers and the many methods of catching their prey. He learned,
  incidentally, that on the night of the express murder most of the nets and
  lures had been washed away. He took minute particulars as to the state of the
  tide on the night in question; he wanted to know if the nets were capable of
  holding up against any great force. For instance, if a school of porpoises
  came along? Or if a fish eagle or an osprey found itself entangled in the
  meshes?</p>

  <p>The fowlers smiled. They invited Merrick to try it for himself. On that
  stormy east coast it was foolish to take any risks. And Merrick was
  satisfied. As a matter of fact, he was more than satisfied.</p>

  <p>He was really beginning to see his way at last. By the time he got back to
  his headquarters again he had practically reconstructed the crime. As he
  stood on the railway permanent way, gazing down into the network of the
  fowlers below, he smiled to himself. He could have tossed a biscuit on to the
  top of the long lengths of tarred and knotted rigging. Later on he telephoned
  to the London terminus of the Grand Coast Railway for the people there to
  place the services of Catesby at his disposal for a day or two. Could Catesby
  meet him at Lydmouth to-morrow?</p>

  <p>The guard could and did. He frankly admitted that he was grateful for the
  little holiday. He looked as if he wanted it. The corners of his mouth
  twitched, his hands were shaky.</p>

  <p>"It's nerves, Mr. Merrick," he explained. "We all suffer from them at
  times. Only we don't like the company to know it, ye understand? To tell the
  truth, I've never got over that affair at the Junction here eight years ago.
  I expect you remember that."</p>

  <p>Merrick nodded. Catesby was alluding to a great railway tragedy which had
  taken place outside Lydmouth station some few years back. It had been a most
  disastrous affair for a local express, and Catesby had been acting as guard
  to the train. He spoke of it under his breath.</p>

  <p>"I dream of it occasionally even now," he said. "The engine left the line
  and dragged the train over the embankment into the river. If you ask me how I
  managed to escape, I can't tell you. I never come into Lydmouth with the
  night express now without my head out of the window of the van right away
  from the viaduct till she pulls up at the station. And what's more, I never
  shall. It isn't fear, mind you, because I've as much pluck as any man. It's
  just nerves."</p>

  <p>"We get 'em in our profession, too," Merrick smiled. "Did you happen to be
  looking out of the window on the night of the murder?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and every other night, too. Haven't I just told you so? Directly we
  strike the viaduct I come to my feet by instinct."</p>

  <p>"Always look out the same side, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, on the left. That's the platform side, you understand."</p>

  <p>"Then if anybody had left the train there&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Anybody left the train! Why we were traveling at fifty miles an hour when
  we reached the viaduct. Oh, yes, if anybody had left the train I should have
  been bound to see them, of course."</p>

  <p>"But you can't see out of both windows at once."</p>

  <p>"Nobody could leave the train by the other side. The stone parapet of the
  viaduct almost touches the footboard, and there's a drop of ninety feet below
  that. Of course I see what you are driving at, Mr. Merrick. Now look here. I
  locked Mr. Skidmore in the carriage myself, and I can prove that nobody got
  in before we left London. That would have been too dangerous a game so long
  as the train was passing any number of brilliantly lighted stations, and by
  the time we got into the open we were going at sixty miles an hour. That
  speed never slackened till we were just outside Lydmouth, and I was watching
  at the moment that our pace dropped. I had my head out of the window of my
  van till we pulled up by the platform. I am prepared to swear to all this if
  you like. Lord knows how the thing was done, and I don't suppose anybody else
  ever will."</p>

  <p>"You are mistaken there," said Merrick drily. "Now, what puzzles you, of
  course, is the manner in which the murderer left the train."</p>

  <p>"Well, isn't that the whole mystery?"</p>

  <p>"Not to me. That's the part I really do know. Not that I can take any
  great credit to myself, because luck helped me. It was, perhaps, the most
  amazing piece of luck I have ever had. It was my duty, of course, to take no
  chances, and I didn't. But we'll come to that presently. Let it suffice for
  the moment that I know how the murderer left the train. What puzzles me is to
  know how he got on it. We can dismiss every other passenger in the train, and
  we need not look for an accomplice. There were accomplices, of course, but
  they were not on the express. Why didn't Mr. Skidmore travel in one of the
  corridor coaches?"</p>

  <p>"He was too nervous. He always had a first-class carriage to himself. We
  knew he was coming, and that was why we attached an ordinary first-class
  coach to the train. We shouldn't do it for anybody, but Lord Rendelmore, the
  chairman of Mr. Skidmore's bank, is also one of our directors. The coach came
  in handy the other night because we had an order from a London undertaker to
  bring a corpse as far as here&mdash;to Lydmouth."</p>

  <p>"Really! You would have to have a separate carriage for that."</p>

  <p>"Naturally, Mr. Merrick. It was sort of killing two birds with one
  stone."</p>

  <p>"I see. When did you hear about the undertaking job?"</p>

  <p>"The same morning we heard from the bank that Mr. Skidmore was going to
  Lydmouth. We reserved a coach at once, and had it attached to the Express.
  The other carriages were filled with ordinary passengers."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't I hear of this before?" Merrick asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. It doesn't seem to me to be of much importance. You might
  just as well ask me questions as to the passengers' baggage."</p>

  <p>"Everything is of importance," Merrick said sententiously. "In our
  profession, there are no such things as trifles. I suppose there will be no
  difficulty in getting at the facts of this corpse business. I'll make
  inquiries here presently."</p>

  <p>So far Merrick professed himself to be satisfied. But there were still
  difficulties in the way. The station people had a clear recollection of the
  receipt of a coffin on the night of the tragedy, and, late as it was, the
  gruesome thing had been fetched away by the people whom it was consigned to.
  A plain hearse, drawn by one horse, had been driven into the station yard,
  the consignment note had been receipted in the usual way, and there was an
  end of the matter. Lydmouth was a big place, with nearly a quarter of a
  million of inhabitants, and would necessarily contain a good many people in
  the undertaking line. Clearly it was no business of the railway company to
  take this thing any further.</p>

  <p>Merrick admitted that freely enough. It was nearly dark when he came back
  to the station, profoundly dissatisfied with a wasted afternoon.</p>

  <p>"No good," he told Catesby. "At the same time there are consolations. And,
  after all, I am merely confirming my suspicions. I suppose your people here
  are on the telephone. If so, I should like to send a message to your head
  office. I want the name of the firm in London who consigned the coffin here.
  I suppose the stationmaster could manage this for me."</p>

  <p>An hour or so later the information came. Merrick, at the telephone,
  wanted a little further assistance. Would the Grand Coast Railway call up the
  undertaker's firm whilst he held the line and ask the full particulars as to
  the body sent from London to Lydmouth. For half an hour Merrick stood
  patiently there till the reply came.</p>

  <p>"Are you there? Is that Inspector Merrick? Oh, yes. Well, we have called
  up Lincoln &amp; Co., the undertakers. We got on to the manager himself. He
  declares that the whole thing is a mistake. They have not sent a corpse over
  our trunk system for two months. I read the manager the letter asking for
  special facilities, a letter on the firm's own paper. The manager does not
  hesitate to say the whole thing is a forgery. I think he is right, Inspector.
  If we can do anything else for you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Merrick hung up the receiver and smiled as if pleased with himself. He
  turned to his companion, Catesby.</p>

  <p>"It's all right," he said. "Is there any way we can get back to London to-
  night? The whole thing is perfectly plain, now."</p>

  <p>Though Merrick returned to London thoroughly satisfied, he knew that the
  sequel was not just yet. There was much conjuring work to be done before it
  would be possible to place all the cards on the table. The Christmas holidays
  had arrived before Merrick obtained a couple of warrants, and, armed with
  these, he went down to Brighton on Boxing Day, and put up at the Hotel
  Regina, registering himself as Colonel Beaumont, sometime of the United
  States Field Forces. Merrick could pose as an authority on Cuba, for on one
  occasion he had been there for six months on the lookout for a defaulting
  bank manager. He had made certain changes in his appearance, and just now he
  bore little resemblance to Inspector Merrick of New Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>The big hotel on the front was full. There was a smart dance that same
  night, preceded by a children's party and Christmas tree. The house swarmed
  with young folks, and a good many nationalities were represented. On
  occasions like these somebody generally takes the lead, and by common consent
  the part of the chief of the events had been allotted to the Marquis de
  Branza.</p>

  <p>To begin with, he was immensely rich. He had vast estates in Italy. He had
  been staying at the Regina for the past month, and it was whispered that his
  bill had reached three figures. He entertained lavishly; he was the soul of
  hospitality; he was going to buy a palace in Kings' Gardens, and more or less
  settle down in Brighton.</p>

  <p>In addition to all this the Marquis was a handsome man, very fascinating,
  and a prime favorite with all the boys and girls at the Regina. He had his
  little peculiarities, of course&mdash;for instance, he paid for everything in
  gold. All his hotel bills were met with current coin.</p>

  <p>Merrick had gleaned all this before he had been a day at the Regina. They
  were quite a happy family, and the Colonel speedily found himself at home.
  The Marquis welcomed him as if he owned the hotel, and as if everybody was
  his guest. The dance was a great success, as also were the presents in
  connection with the cotillon promoted by the Marquis.</p>

  <p>At two o'clock the following morning the Marquis was entertaining a select
  party in the smoking-room. The ladies had all vanished by this time. The
  Marquis was speaking of his adventures. He really had quite a talent in that
  direction. Naturally, a man of his wealth was certain to be the mark for
  swindlers. Merrick listened with an approving smile. He knew that most of
  these stories were true, for they had all been recorded from time to time at
  Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>"You would have made an excellent detective, Marquis," he said. "You have
  made it quite clear where the police blundered over that Glasgow tragedy. I
  suppose you read all about the Grand Coast Railway murder."</p>

  <p>The Marquis started ever so slightly. There was a questioning look in his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Did you?" he said. "Naturally one would, Colonel. But a matter the most
  inexplicable. I gave him up. From the very first I gave him up. If the guard
  Catesby was not the guilty person, then I admit I have no theory."</p>

  <p>One by one, the smoking-room company faded away. Presently only Merrick
  and the Marquis remained, save one guest who had fallen asleep in his chair.
  A sleepy waiter looked in and vanished again. The hotel was absolutely quiet
  now. Merrick, however, was wide awake enough; so, apparently, was the
  Marquis. All the same, he yawned ostentatiously.</p>

  <p>"Let us to bed," he said. "To-morrow, perhaps&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No," Merrick said somewhat curtly. "I prefer to-night. Sit down."</p>

  <p>The last two words came crisply and with a ring of command in them. The
  Marquis bowed as he dropped into a chair and lighted a fresh cigarette. A
  little red spot glowed on either of his brown cheeks, his eyes glittered.</p>

  <p>"You want to speak to me, Colonel?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Very much indeed. Now, you are an exceedingly clever man, Marquis, and
  you may be able to help me. It happens that I am deeply interested in the
  Grand Coast Express murder; in fact, I have devoted the last two months to
  its solution."</p>

  <p>"With no success whatever, my dear Colonel?" the Marquis murmured.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, my dear Marquis, with absolute satisfaction. I am quite
  sure that you will be interested in my story."</p>

  <p>The Marquis raised his cigarette graciously.</p>

  <p>"You are very good to give me your confidence," he said. "Pray
  proceed."</p>

  <p>"Thank you. I will not bore you with any preliminary details, for they are
  too recent to have faded from your memory. Sufficient that we have a murder
  committed in an express train; we have the disappearance of eight thousand
  pounds in gold, without any trace of the criminal. That he was on the train
  at the start is obvious. That he was not in any of the carriages conveying
  ordinary passengers is equally obvious. It is also certain that he left the
  train after the commission of the crime. Doubtless you read the evidence of
  the guard to prove that nobody left the train after the viaduct leading to
  Lydmouth station was reached. Therefore, the murderer contrived to make his
  escape when the express was traveling at sixty miles per hour."</p>

  <p>"Is not all this superfluous?" the Marquis asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, not quite. I am going to tell you how the murderer joined the train
  and how he left it after the murder and the robbery."</p>

  <p>"You are going to tell me that! Is it possible?"</p>

  <p>"I think so," Merrick said modestly. "Now, Mr. Skidmore had a compartment
  to himself. He was locked in the very last thing, and nobody joined the train
  afterward. Naturally a&mdash;well&mdash;an amateur detective like myself
  wanted to know who was in the adjoining compartments. Three of these could be
  dismissed at once. But in the fourth there was a corpse&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A corpse! But there was no mention of that at the inquest."</p>

  <p>"No, but the fact remains. A corpse in a coffin. In a dark compartment
  with the blinds down. And, strangely enough, the firm of undertakers who
  consigned, or were supposed to consign, the body to Lydmouth denied the whole
  business. Therefore, it is only fair to suppose that the whole thing was a
  put-up job to get a compartment in the coach that Mr. Skidmore traveled by. I
  am going to assume that in that coffin the murderer lay concealed. But let me
  give you a light&mdash;your cigarette is out."</p>

  <p>"I smoke no more," the Marquis said. "My throat, he is dry. And
  then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, then, the first part is easy. The man gets out of the coffin and
  proceeds to fill it with some heavy substance which has been smuggled into
  the carriage under the pall. He screws the lid down and presently makes his
  way along the footboard to the next compartment. An athlete in good condition
  could do that; in fact, a sailor has done it in a drunken freak more than
  once. Mind you, I don't say that murder was intended in the first instance;
  but will presume that there was a struggle. The thief probably lost his
  temper, and perhaps Mr. Skidmore irritated him. Now, the rest was easy. It
  was easy to pack up the gold in leather bags, each containing a thousand
  sovereigns, and to drop them along the line at some spot previously agreed
  upon. I have no doubt that the murderer and his accomplices traveled many
  times up and down the line before the details were finally settled. Any way,
  there was no risk here. The broken packing cases were pitched out also,
  probably in some thick wood. Or they might have been weighted and cast into a
  stream. Are you interested?"</p>

  <p>The Marquis gurgled. He had some difficulty in speaking.</p>

  <p>"A little dangerous," he said. "Our ingenious friend could not possibly
  screw himself down in the coffin after returning to his compartment. And have
  you perceived the danger of discovery at Lydmouth?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely," Merrick said drily. "It is refreshing to meet with so
  luminous a mind as yours. There were many dangers, many risks to take. The
  train might have been stopped, lots of things might have happened. It would
  be far better for the man to leave the express. And he did so!"</p>

  <p>"The express at top speed! Impossible!"</p>

  <p>"To the ordinary individual, yes. But then, you see, this was not an
  ordinary individual. He was&mdash;let us suppose&mdash;an acrobat, a man of
  great nerve and courage, accustomed to trapeze work and the use of the diving
  net."</p>

  <p>"But Colonel, pardon me, where does the net come in?"</p>

  <p>"The net came in at a place near Little Warlingham, on the Norfolk coast.
  There are miles of net up there, trap and flight nets close by the side of
  the line. These nets are wide and strong; they run many furlongs without
  supports, so that an acrobat could easily turn a somersault on to one of
  these at a given spot without the slightest risk. He could study out the
  precise spot carefully beforehand&mdash;there are lightships on the sands to
  act as guides. I have been down to the spot and studied it all out for
  myself. The thing is quite easy for the class of man I mean. I am not taking
  any great credit to myself, because I happened to see the body of the man who
  essayed that experiment. I recognized him for&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You recognized him! You knew who he was?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly. He was Luigi Bianca, who used to perform in London years ago,
  with his brother Joseph, on the high trapeze. Then one of them got into
  trouble and subsequently embarked, as the papers say, on a career of crime.
  And when I saw the body of Luigi I knew at once that he had had a hand in the
  murder of Mr. Skidmore. When the right spot was reached the fellow took a
  header in the dark boldly enough, but he did not know that the storm had come
  with a very high October tide, and washed the nets away. He fell on the sands
  and dislocated his neck. But I had something to go on with. When I found out
  about the bogus corpse I began to see my way. I have been making careful
  inquiries ever since for the other criminal&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The other criminal! You mean to insinuate&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I insinuate nothing," Merrick said coldly; "naturally enough I wanted to
  find Joseph Bianca. He was the man who picked up the gold; he was the man who
  hired a car in London from Moss &amp; Co., in Regent Street, for a week. This
  was to recover the gold and incidentally also to take up the thief who stole
  it. I wanted to find Joseph Bianca, and I've done it!"</p>

  <p>The Marquis leaped to his feet. As he did so the man in the distant chair
  woke up and moved across the room.</p>

  <p>"Don't make a fuss!" Merrick said quietly. "You will be able to explain
  presently&mdash;perhaps what you are doing here posing as a Marquis, and
  where you got all that ready money from. Meanwhile, let me inform you that I
  am Inspector Merrick, of Scotland Yard, and that this is Sergeant Matthews.
  Joseph Bianca, you are my prisoner, and I have a warrant for your arrest as
  an accessory before and after the fact for the murder of Mr. George Skidmore.
  Ask them to call us a cab, Matthews!"</p><br>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">Philip Stenning asked the question twice without getting a
  reply.</p>

  <p>"I think we had better understand one another, Mabel," he said. "I have
  come all these thousands of miles in response to your letter, because I
  refuse to accept your suggestion as final. And, as to your liking Archer
  King, the mere suggestion is ridiculous."</p>

  <p>Mabel Larchester found her voice at last.</p>

  <p>"It seems so utterly hopeless," she murmured. "Isn't it four years since
  you went out to Australia, Phil? People suppose that my father is prosperous,
  but, when things come to be investigated, he will have to confess&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh," Stenning said in the same calm, constrained voice, "I think I begin
  to understand. You have grown old enough to see the advantage of throwing me
  over for a rich man like Archer King."</p>

  <p>The girl looked swiftly up into his face. He could see how her lips were
  trembling, how she was trying to force herself to say something other than
  what he wished to hear. She twisted her hands together painfully.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it isn't that," she cried. "If it were nothing but money, I shouldn't
  care. Even for my father I couldn't marry a man like Archer King."</p>

  <p>"This is just what I feared," Stenning went on. "Is it a large amount that
  your father has&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," Mabel said miserably.</p>

  <p>"Now, listen. I don't want anybody to know that I am back here. I walked
  over from Rothesay Junction on purpose to avoid people. But you are not going
  to marry Archer King. Is he in the village now?"</p>

  <p>"I saw him this afternoon," Mabel murmured.</p>

  <p>A clock somewhere in the distance was chiming the hour of ten. Most of the
  houses in the little village were in darkness by this time. At some distance
  away on the hillside two windows gleamed brightly yellow through the
  gloom.</p>

  <p>"That is Rothesay House," Phillip said, as if speaking to himself. "And
  those windows are in Archer King's library upstairs. I have been there more
  than once, and I am going there again this evening. When I come away you will
  be free."</p>

  <p>He stooped, and lightly brushed her forehead with his lips. Then he turned
  and plunged into the darkness and gloom of the shrubbery. Just for a moment
  or two Mabel hesitated. She knew by this time that the servants in the house
  had gone to bed. She knew that for the next hour or two it would be very
  little use to expect her father. It would be safe to follow Stenning. There
  would be no risk in leaving the house open to the world; in a quiet place
  like that there was no one to take precautions against. And Phillip Stenning
  had embarked upon a dangerous errand. She feared for him more for his courage
  and resolution than she did for the results likely to accrue to herself. A
  clock somewhere was striking eleven, as she turned into the drive leading to
  Rothesay House. She pulled up and stood in the shadow, waiting patiently for
  she knew not what.</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">Philip Stenning walked round the house twice in the shadow
  of the darkness. He knew the place almost as well as he knew his own home.
  Years before it had come into the possession of King, he had been a welcome
  guest there as a boy. He could see now that the lights were out all over the
  house, save for the two gleaming windows upstairs, which gave light to the
  library. Just for a moment Phil stood there with his hand on the bell-pull.
  He had proved to himself that the servants were all upstairs. It was fair to
  assume that King would answer the summons himself. But this did seem
  sufficiently dramatic to please Stenning. He wanted to take the man utterly
  off his guard, entirely by surprise, to frighten him into giving up that
  suspected document before he could recover his nerve and cunning. It might be
  just possible, Stenning thought, to get into the house other than by the
  front door. He moved round to the side entrance. He fumbled over the
  window-sash. It seemed to him that one of the catches was broken. The window
  yielded to the pressure, and a moment later he was inside.</p>

  <p>All this had taken time, and, just as Stenning entered the house, he heard
  the clock on the staircase strike the three-quarters after eleven. He stood
  there in the velvety darkness trying to recall his knowledge of the house. In
  the daylight it would have been easy enough. But now it was somewhat of a
  different matter.</p>

  <p>Slowly the pieces of the puzzle came together in his brain. He groped his
  way along until he came at length to the big square hall. He could feel the
  soft carpet under his feet. He was beginning to make out the outline of the
  objects there. A thin slit of light lay like a lance along the stairs and
  across the floor. Evidently the library door was open, and this faint streak
  of illumination came from there. Stenning stood at the foot of the staircase,
  listening intently. His four years of Australian training was standing him in
  good stead now. He was not in the least afraid, not in the least nervous. He
  had himself under perfect control. And yet it seemed to him that he could
  hear stealthy whispers somewhere, and the creaking of the old oak stairs, as
  if someone were creeping up them. The little slice of light glimmered on the
  banisters, and then Stenning could have sworn that he saw a hand, dull and
  brown, laid on the glittering oak just for a minute. It was not the hand,
  white or brown, of an Englishman; it seemed to Stenning to be of a dull
  copper hue. But of that he could not be certain, for the light was not strong
  enough, and a moment later the dusky fingers vanished. Just as he had
  anticipated, the library door was open. He could see a lamp gleaming on the
  table. He could make out the form of Archer King there bending over his
  correspondence. He sat with his left cheek resting on his hand. His right arm
  appeared to be moving, as if his pen were travelling over the paper. Stenning
  stepped across the room and tapped smartly on Archer King's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"I want a word with you," he said. "Do you hear?"</p>

  <p>The man sitting by the table made no sign or motion. He sat there, without
  moving a muscle. His pen had dropped from his fingers.</p>

  <p>"Oh, take your time," Stenning went on. "'I have come for that document
  you hold&mdash;the paper which gives you such a power over George
  Larchester."</p>

  <p>Still, there was no sign from the man by the table. Nothing but a quiet
  chuckle which was almost instantly suppressed. With his open hand Stenning
  dealt King a blow on the side of his head. He fell from his chair, and
  crashed upon the floor. There was no great noise, the blow was not so heavy
  as all that. But King lay there with his head curiously twisted under his
  left shoulder. He lay there still and motionless, without a sound.</p>

  <p>Was the fellow dead? It was a chance in a million. He might have fallen
  like that 10,000 times without injury. But there was no recalling it now. The
  man had pitched head-long upon the polished floor. A broken neck? He was gone
  beyond hope of surgery, and Stenning stood there knowing that he was this
  man's murderer.</p>

  <p>He was out in the garden now, hurrying across the lawn. He did not seem to
  be aware for a moment or two that Mabel Larchester was by his side. She
  reached and touched his wet, clammy hand.</p>

  <p>"What has happened?" she whispered. "What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Archer King is dead," Stenning said hoarsely. "And I have killed him.
  Nothing seems to matter after that."</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">Stenning sat in his hotel, thinking of his recent ride
  through the darkness along the coast line, to the big town he had now safely
  reached. It was Mabel's idea that his discarded bicycle should be pushed over
  the cliffs into the sea, where it would lie unheeded till it rusted beyond
  recognition. It was Mabel who suggested that Stenning should go from thence
  to London, back to the hotel where he had left his belongings. He had started
  in his head-long way, and everything had gone smoothly, the more so, perhaps,
  because Stenning was reckless and desperate, and took few precautions. That
  had been five days ago, now, and yet nothing had happened. The papers were
  more or less full of the Rothesay affair. It was just the kind of thing that
  appealed to the popular imagination. The inquest that day was eagerly being
  looked forward to. Stenning could hear the boys in the street shouting it
  oot. He stepped into the roadway, and bought one of the damp sheets.</p>

  <p>"Miss Mabel Larchester was the next witness. Her story was to the effect
  that on the night of the tragedy, she had occasion to go from her own house
  as far as the residence of the deceased gentleman. It was very late when she
  started, so late, indeed, that she did not arrive outside Rothesay House till
  a few minutes before twelve. The clock had struck twelve before she rang the
  bell; which she did three times before she made anybody hear. On the butler
  tardily appearing, she asked to see Mr. King. The butler went upstairs to the
  library and returned a few moments later with the horrifying intelligence
  that Mr. King was dead.</p>

  <p>"The Coroner: 'Now, did you happen to see anything to arouse your
  suspicions? Little things are sometimes of importance.'</p>

  <p>"'There is only one thing. As I said before, it was just a few minutes
  past twelve when I rang the bell of Rothesay House. As I crossed the lawn I
  looked up at the library windows, and I saw a figure cross between the light
  and the blind. It was not the figure of Mr. King. That would be, as far as I
  recollect, about six minutes past twelve. I am quite sure of this because I
  heard the stable clock strike the midnight hour.'"</p>

  <p>Stenning dropped the paper at this point, and allowed himself to think.
  Surely, it seemed to him that Mabel was mistaken. Perhaps she had placed the
  hour at past twelve to shield him. There was not much more besides the
  evidence of the doctor, which went far to disprove the theory of King's death
  being due to an accident. The doctor declined to believe that a man could
  have fallen from his chair and broken his neck in this fashion. A broken neck
  was instantaneous death, of course, so that he could not have crawled into
  the room.</p>

  <p>"The Coroner: 'You feel quite convinced that the deceased man met with
  foul play?'</p>

  <p>"'I think so. At any rate, I think there is something mysterious in this
  matter which calls for investigation.'</p>

  <p>"At this point Inspector Dainton appealed for a week's adjournment. He
  claimed to have discovered an important document which seemed to throw light
  upon the mysterious affair.</p>

  <p>"The inquest was accordingly adjourned till the next Friday, when, we are
  informed, sensational developments are likely to arise. In the meantime the
  police are exceedingly reticent. Inspector Dainton informs us that he has not
  the slightest doubt of a satisfactory solution at almost any moment."</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">There was nothing for Phillip Stenning to do but to possess
  his soul in patience. He went in and out of his hotel much like any other man
  who might have business in the big city; he only came back late in the
  evening. He was killing time as best he could. No word or sign had come from
  Mabel, nor had he made any attempt to communicate with her. This had been an
  understood thing between them. Possibly, the evening papers on Friday
  afternoon would have something sensational to say. Not that it in the least
  mattered, Stenning told himself. Archer King was dead, and he had killed him,
  and the most ingenious police theory could not alter the fact. It was nearly
  six o'clock on Friday night before the Rothesay House tragedy was on
  everybody's lips again. The whole of London seemed to ring with it. As
  Stenning walked along it seemed as if those voices were mocking him. Stenning
  passed his hand across his eyes. He thrust sixpence into the hand of one of
  the newsboys. He hurried along to his hotel, and locked himself in his room.
  Then, with a shaking hand, he tore open the paper.</p>

  <p>"Important Arrest&mdash;Sensational Statement by Inspector Dainton. The
  Prisoner in the Dock&mdash;Full Confession of the Crime."</p>

  <p>Then he began to read.</p>

  <p>"One of the most extraordinary disclosures of modern times took place this
  morning before the local magistrates in the case of the mysterious murder at
  Rothesay House. Lallah Rehn, described as a native of Borneo, was placed in
  the dock charged with the wilful murder of Mr. Archer King, on the 5th inst.
  The arrest had been kept profoundly quiet, and the courthouse was more or
  less deserted when Inspector Dainton got up to tell his extraordinary story.
  It would be as well, perhaps, to give the narrative in his own words.</p>

  <p>"'As your worship is aware,' he said, 'the inquest on Mr. King was
  adjourned at my request, so that I could follow up a certain clue which I had
  come upon in an examination of Mr. King's private papers. In the course of my
  search, I found a large foolscap envelope duly sealed with a superscription
  to the effect that it was only to be opened in case of the owner's death by
  violence. Being more or less satisfied that Mr. King had died by violence,
  the packet was opened by myself in the presence of Mr. King's solicitor. In
  it we found a number of letters written to Mr. King from some place in
  Borneo, the letters being signed by one Lallah Rehn. I should like your
  worship to read these letters which are all the more illuminating because, as
  a methodical man, Mr. King had placed in the envelopes copies of his replies.
  It seems that at one time the prisoner and Mr. King were in a sort of
  partnership. They had obtained important concessions relating to the rubber
  industry, out of which, I gather, Mr. King made a large fortune. It seems,
  also, from a careful perusal of these letters, that Mr. King had treated his
  partner exceedingly shabbily. In fact, I may go so far as to say that the
  prisoner was deliberately cheated out of his just due. This seems to have
  affected his mind to a certain extent, and in more than one of his letters he
  threatens Mr. King with a peculiar kind of death, doubtless some native form
  of murder, which Mr. King probably was aware of. I may tell your worship that
  these letters were meant to fall into the hands of the police, in case
  anything happened to Mr. King, and in one of Mr. King's communications placed
  in the envelope he says so quite cynically. I presume his idea was that the
  prisoner should not escape, in case he was successful in his attempt to take
  the life of his late partner. We are not altogether successful in saying how
  the crime was committed, but, in the course of time, witnesses may be able to
  clear up that point.</p>

  <p>"'Immediately after reading these letters, I caused inquiries to be made,
  and last night the prisoner was arrested in Hull. I shall be able to prove to
  you that he was at Rothesay House the day before the murder, where he was
  accidentally seen by one of the servants, and that the butler saw him again
  in the grounds when he returned to the house about ten o'clock. Other
  evidence will be given you to connect the prisoner with the crime. There is
  nothing more for the present, except that I should like a remand until
  to-morrow morning to enable the authorities to perfect their case.'</p>

  <p>"The Chairman: 'I suppose the prisoner is not represented? Does he happen
  to know any English?'</p>

  <p>"Inspector Dainton: 'The letters I spoke of, sir, are written in English.
  The prisoner is a man of some education. Probably, he will want to employ a
  solicitor.'</p>

  <p>"At this point the prisoner raised his head. He had apparently been taking
  no interest in the proceedings. He displayed a countenance of considerable
  intelligence. His features appeared to be rather prepossessing than
  otherwise.</p>

  <p>"'I want no counsel, your Worship,' he said. 'It is all exactly as your
  chief of the police says. King, he was my partner. King, he was a great
  scoundrel, and robbed me of all that I possessed. He left me penniless, he
  refused to do anything for me. It is all at his door that the death of my
  wife and daughter lie. And I have waited all this time for my revenge. Oh, I
  would have got away if I could. I never expected that King would leave these
  letters behind him. I saw King the day before he died, but he laughed at me.
  I pretended that I did not care. I went away as if everything were hopeless,
  but I came back the next night, and got in through the scullery window. I
  crept to the library. I killed him there and then, as he sat bending over the
  desk. You would like, perhaps, me to show you how it is done, and I will show
  you.'</p>

  <p>"The few people in court followed the prisoners movements with breathless
  interest. He took from round his waist a soft silk sash, which he proceeded
  to fold and place across his throat. He knotted the two ends firmly to the
  rail of the dock, and he proceeded to twist his right arm in the folds behind
  him.</p>

  <p>"'You have heard of the Thugs in India?' he explained. 'The white man
  thinks that Thugs are extinct, but that is not so. You throw your scarf round
  the victim's neck; then, with your knee in his back, you pull him backwards,
  and you twist the silk just so, and his neck snaps like a twig, and your
  enemy lies dead at your feet. If you will watch me, you will see how easy it
  is. It was half-past eleven when I entered King's house. When the clock
  struck the quarter after twelve, I was a mile away, and in that time he died
  without a word, and no one could say how he perished. And as I do not wish to
  linger in one of your English gaols, and a life is nothing for me, why, all I
  have to do is this, and&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"The horrified spectators saw the unfortunate man give a quick wrench of
  his body to the left, whereupon he imediately fell prostrate upon the floor
  of the dock, where he lay till a doctor could be summoned. It subsequently
  transpired that his neck was broken, that he had taken his own life just in
  the same manner as that in which he had destroyed Mr. King. There were
  absolutely no marks of violence, and, but for these sensational developments,
  there is little doubt that the murderer of Mr. Archer King would have
  remained amongst the unsolved mysteries of which there have been far too many
  of late."</p>

  <p>The paper fell from Stenning's hand. He saw it all clearly now. It came
  back to him vividly. He shuddered as he pictured himself standing behind
  Archer King, and pouring out his wrath and scorn upon a dead man. He
  recollected the brown hand on the banister. It seemed to him that he could
  never forget the noise of King's fall from the chair. And then the mist
  cleared from Stenning's eyes, and he saw that he was free. There would be no
  more hiding and mystery for him. He could go back in the course of time with
  his head high in the air. He could claim his wife. Then he dropped his head
  on his hands, and slept soundly for the first time for many
  days.&mdash;"M.A.P."</p><br>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">IT WAS all very well for the General to assert his
  independence, to proclaim the fact that he was not going to be put upon by
  anybody, but it was none the less awkward for Ethel Lance, who was mainly
  responsible for the maintenance of law and order in the old fire-eater's
  family. This was not the first time the same thing had happened, but it had
  never taken place on Christmas Eve before. To make a long story short,
  General Francis had been quarrelling with his servants, and one word leading
  to another, the upshot ot the mischief was that the domestics left in a body,
  to the General's great delight and the corresponding dismay of Miss
  Lance.</p>

  <p>"It's all very well," she said, "but what are we going to do now? Do you
  know there is absolutely not a single servant left in the house? Do you
  understand that?"</p>

  <p>"And a good thing, too, my dear, General Francis chuckled. They are the
  plague of one's life. If I had known how things had altered since my young
  days I would have spent the rest of my life in India. No trouble with them
  out there."</p>

  <p>Which was precisely the source of all the mischief. General Francis had
  spent more years than he cared to count in the service of his country and he
  had not yet succeeded in bringing himself in line with modern British ideas.
  It was, no doubt, a fine thing to take out his cheque book and pay them off
  grandly one at a time; but who was going to take their places? Seagrave
  Grange was by a means a large house, but it required at least half a dozen
  servants to run the place properly, added to which it was some twenty miles
  from the nearest town. Between now and Christmas Day it would be absolutely
  impossible for Ethel to supply a fresh domestic staff. More than this, casual
  help was at a premium. Even the humblest of cottager's wives liked if
  possible to spend Christmas in the bosom of their family. It was fortunate,
  perhaps, that the few expected guests were all relatives, who could be put
  off by telegram.</p>

  <p>"Well, there is only one thing for it," Ethel said resignedly. "We shall
  have to send messages to everybody not to come, and we shall have to do the
  best we can for ourselves. I suppose you understand what that means, uncle?
  You must make your own bed and get your own breakfast. I don't suppose it
  will be any particular hardship to an old campaigner like yourself, and, no
  doubt, I can manage. But it is impossible that there should be cooking of any
  kind in the circumstances."</p>

  <p>The General drew himself up erect. The smile of the conqueror was on his
  face. For the moment he stood on the hearthrug in front of the dining-room
  fire, feeling that he had done well by his country. But the mood would pass
  presently, as Ethel very well knew, for the General was a man who had a
  weakness for his dinner and the other good things of this life.</p>

  <p>"Where there's a will there's a way," he said cheerfully. Oh, no doubt you
  will find somebody to come and give you a hand. I daresay there are plenty of
  deserving women in the neighbourhood who have been cooks and all that kind of
  thing in their younger days. I don't want much myself just a bit of fish, and
  a bird and a savoury for dinner. It's hard luck if an old soldier like myself
  can't make shift, and do without a parcel of inefficient servants."</p>

  <p>In spite of her perplexity Ethel laughed aloud. She was wondering where
  the genius was to come from, capable of cooking the little dinner which the
  General had sketched out so airily for himself. There were, doubtless,
  working men's wives in the neighbourhood who eked out a scanty living by an
  occasional odd day's work, but from a gastronomic point of view, they were
  hardly likely to satisfy the General's modest requirements. And despite her
  annoyance, Ethel could not really find it in her heart of hearts to be angry
  with her uncle. He seemed to take everything for granted. He seemed
  absolutely certain that he had done the right thing. Ethel stood there for a
  moment or two, looking out through the windows across the snowy landscape
  lying white and silent outside. There had been two heavy falls of snow
  lately, so that it was a matter of some difficulty to reach the nearest
  village and if something had to be done, that same must he done speedily, and
  before darkness fell. The bare trees were swaying wildly in the wind, the
  leaden-grey sky gave promise of more snow to come. The General turned away
  from the fire and rubbed his hands briskly.</p>

  <p>"It's setting low," he muttered. "Why aren't there any logs here? And the
  coal scuttle is empty. Confound the people. They might have taken the trouble
  to see to this before they went."</p>

  <p>"And now you'll have to see to it yourself." Ethel laughed. "Do you happen
  to know where the coal and wood are kept? because if you don't I must show
  you. And whilst you are about it, you had better get in a good supply or we
  shall have the kitchen fire out, too, to say nothing of the drawing-room and
  the bedroom."</p>

  <p>"I've got to do that?" the General said in a choking voice.</p>

  <p>"Well, of course," Ethel responded sweetly. My dear uncle, you hardly
  expect <i>me</i> to do things of that sort!"</p>

  <p>General Francis snorted furiously. A deep pink spread over his cheeks. He
  was beginning faintly to realise that he was likely to pay a penalty for his
  headstrong folly. All the same he followed Ethel quietly and grimly enough
  down the stone-flagged passages until they came to a large square yard
  surrounded by outhouses. The were five or six inches of wet snow on the
  pavement, and the General breathed a silent prayer that his chronic
  rheumatism might escape the fruits of his rashness.</p>

  <p>"You'll find all you want over there," Ethel went on. "You can amuse
  yourselfby filling up all the buckets and baskets and carrying them into the
  kitchen. You had better get in a big supply, because it looks like more snow,
  and goodness knows how deep it will be before morning. As to myself, I will
  go as far as the village and see if I can get some sort of assistance."</p>

  <p>It was no far cry to the village, but the task was a little more difficult
  than Ethel had anticipated. The fine snow had drifted by the wind into masses
  here and there, so that progress was slow and painful. Ethel shuddered to
  herself as she thought how dangerous the way would be if she happened to be
  detained in the village till after dark. But she put these gruesome thoughts
  from her mind now, and trudged bravely on till at length the place was
  reached.</p>

  <p>It was just as she had anticipated. News of the exodus from Seagrave
  Grange had already reached the villagers, and some of them were disposed to
  be amused over the trouble which had overtaken General Francis. Some, on the
  other hand, were sympathetic enough, but the same story came to Ethel's ears
  with wearisome monotony. Everybody who cared to turn out had been engaged for
  the festive season. And as to the rest, they made no secret of the fact that
  Christmas Day was a sacred one to them, so far as their families were
  concerned. It was very annoying and very disheartening, but there was nothing
  else for it, and Ethel turned disconsolately homeward in the gathering dusk.
  She had been detained by more than one forlorn hope, so that at length when
  she turned her back upon the glowing red lights of the village the darkness
  had nearly fallen. It was strange how weird and unfamiliar the landscape had
  grown, how all the well-known marks seemed to become merged in the snow. Yet
  Ethel had walked that same path hundreds of times before. She have been
  almost ready to have attempted it blindfold. Yet now she felt all misty and
  confused, with a certain horror lest she had taken a wrong road. The darkness
  shut down, too, with appalling swiftness. The trees were rocking in the wind,
  a stinging powder of snow tingled on the girl's face, until she winced in
  positive pain. She turned her back to the gale for one moment while she
  fought for breath, then she staggered on again till the great white drift
  rose up beyond her knees, and further progress became impossible. It seemed
  to the girl that her mind was going now, and that she was sinking into a
  dreamless sleep. She remembered in a vague kind of way tales and stories of
  travellers lost in the snow, and how they had actually lain down and perished
  within a stone's throw of warmth and safety.</p>

  <p>With a great effort she struggled to her feet and attempted to push her
  way forward. It was just a chance now whether she made her way through or
  not, for the darkness was thick and black as velvet. She could feel nothing
  but the tingle of the snow on her face. All she knew was that whatever
  happened she must keep upon her feet, that the least weakness or fear on her
  part would bring the end about. She braced herself up presently and cried
  aloud for help. Surely it was possible that somebody was abroad in the
  neighbourhood, for, dark and desolate as it was, she was yet within half a
  mile of the village, and almost within hearing distance of civilisation. She
  bitterly regretted that she had not accepted the offer of a lantern which one
  of the villagers had tendered her. Once more she opened her lips and cried
  aloud, and this time it seemed as if her call was not in vain. Surely she
  could hear someone coming whistling down the road. Surely that spot of light
  dancing before her eyes must be a lantern carried by some guardian angel in
  the shape of a villager. Once more the scream for assistance broke
  distractedly from the girl's lips.</p>

  <p>"All right!" a welcome voice said cheerfully. "I'm coming. Stay where you
  are and I am certain to find you."</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">Ethel's heart seemed to stand still for a moment, then the
  blood rushed back to her veins again, the feeling of numbness and sleepiness
  passed away. A moment later she was looking up into the face of the man who
  carried the lantern, and he was gazing concernedly into her own. A light of
  recognition came into his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Why, Ethel," he exclaimed. "What are you. doing here? Don't you know how
  dangerous it is to be out in a storm like this To think I should run against
  you like this the very day I come home. But perhaps you have not yet forgiven
  me."</p>

  <p>"Oh, take me back to the Grange," Ethel moaned. "Thank heaven you came in
  time. It is only a few minutes since I left the village, and yet I am
  absolutely exhausted. I came down here to see if I could find some
  assistance. All our servants have gone away, and the General and myself are
  quite alone in the house."</p>

  <p>Roger Keene suppressed a smile, for the General's queer notions of
  discipline were well known to the young sailor, who was now hastening home to
  his father's house. Sir Roger Keene's residence lay fairly close to Seagrave
  Grange. There had been a time, two years ago, when Roger and Ethel had been
  something more than friends, but some stupid misunderstanding had arisen
  between them, and a long voyage in the Chinese seas seemed to have nipped the
  romance in the bud.</p>

  <p>"And so you are absolutely dependent upon yourselves," Roger said
  cheerfully. "How like the General it is. Nobody but he would have chosen a
  time like this to get rid of all his servants. But I dare say we shall find
  some way out of the difficulty. The first thing is to get you home again.
  Just you lean on my arm and trust to me to pull you through. It is a precious
  lucky thing that I thought of borrowing a lantern in the village. I don't
  believe I should have got home without it."</p>

  <p>"But you will be snowed up yourself," Ethel protested. "And they will be
  anxious about you at home. And, besides, I don't see why you should go out of
  your way like this for my sake, especially after the way in which I..."</p>

  <p>Ethel broke off in some confusion. It seemed to her that Roger pressed her
  arm to his affectionately.</p>

  <p>"I think I know what you are going to say," he whispered. "But we will go
  into all that later on. As a matter of fact, my people won't he in the least
  alarmed, because they don't expect me till to-morrow, which is Christmas Day,
  and lots of things might happen between now and then. You are not to say
  another word till you are warm and comfortable again and have had some hot
  food. You are under my protection now. How stupid we have been, Ethel."</p>

  <p>Ethel made no attempt to deny the charge. She was feeling strangely happy-
  and comfortable, despite their slow progress and the sting of snowflakes on
  her cheeks. They managed to pick their way between the snowdrifts, thanks to
  the friendly light of the lantern, until presently Seagrave Grange loomed out
  of the darkness, and the warmth of tho dining-room was reached at length, A
  great fire blazed upon the hearth. General Francis had managed to light the
  lamps, both of which were smoking horribly. The anxiety cleared from his face
  as Ethel came into the room.</p>

  <p>"I was beginning to feel terribly worried," he said. "Hallo, Roger, is
  that you? How did you come here?" Roger Keene proceeded to briefly explain.
  Without ceremony he extinguished one of the lamps and relighted it
  dexterously. In a few moments both lamps were burning brightly.</p>

  <p>"Now you go off to your room at once," said Roger, cheerfully. "By the
  time you get downstairs I will make you some tea. I dare say you have got a
  kettle and hot water somewhere. If you don't know where it is, I can find it.
  But don't you worry, General. You just sit down and smoke a cigar and leave
  it to me. One doesn't knock about for two or three years in a coasting
  squadron without learning a thing or two. I flatter myself I can show you a
  way to do without servants altogether. After we have had tea we'll overhaul
  the larder and see if I can't cook you a dinner which, at any rate, will have
  the charm of novelty. It is a lucky thing that I happened to come along just
  at the rjght time."</p>

  <p>For once in his life the General yielded up the reins of office to a
  younger man than himself. After all was said and done, they seemed to have
  ways of managing things in the Navy which certainly did not apply to the
  sister service. In an incredibly short space of time Roger had tea on the
  table. He had found bread and butter foraging about the kitchen, and
  presently the tea was flanked by a pile of hot buttered toast, to which all
  did ample justice.</p>

  <p>"Upon my word, this is a unique experience," the General cried. "I have
  spent some queer Christmas Eves in my time, but never one like this before. I
  begin to feel almost glad that I got rid of those servants now. Better tea
  never tasted."</p>

  <p>Roger Keene smiled discreetly. He knew the General well enough to feel
  that once the novelty had worn off he would soon be hungry again for the good
  things of life.</p>

  <p>But for the present it was pleasant enough; it was pleasant to sit there
  round the glowing wood fire with the curtains tightly drawn, listening to the
  howl of the gale outside and the angry swish of snowflakes on the windows. It
  was, in sooth, a strange Christmas Eve, but the very strangeness of it added
  to its charm and piquancy. Ethel sat there in a big armchair, her eyes
  half-closed. She was still dwelling upon her miraculous escape; her heart was
  full of gratitude and tenderness towards Roger. But for him, she shuddered to
  think where she might be by this time.</p>

  <p>Cut off from the world as they were, the evening passed swiftly enough,
  and Roger's impromptu dinner was voted as successful as his tea. There was
  one part of the meal which the absence of servants could not mar, and that
  was the wines. The General brought them up from the cellar himself. He
  decanted some curious old port with a reverence and respect which became its
  great age. He was beaming with delight now. He did not look in the least like
  the culprit who had brought all this about.</p>

  <p>"Your very good health, Roger," he said, "and may this be the least
  pleasant moment in our lives. If you can possibly run over to-morrow and cook
  our meals for us, I daresay we shall get along till we can man the garrison
  again."</p>

  <p>"I think I have a better plan than that," Roger said demurely. "I shall
  have to leave you to get your own breakfast, but you shall see me later in
  the day."</p>

  <p>And Roger was quite as good as his word, for early in the forenoon on
  Christmas Day a comfortable-looking omnibus ploughed its way through the snow
  to Seagrave Grange, and Sir Roger Keene, followed by his son, alighted, and
  made their way into the house.</p>

  <p>"A merry Christmas to you," the Baronet said heartily. "My dear General,
  why on earth did you not let me know what was going on? Here we are in that
  big house of mine with, no Christmas guests, for once in a way, except Roger,
  with enough, and more than enough, for a whole village, and you are actually
  starving here, with no one to help you. I am not going to listen to a single
  word. I'll send over a caretaker to look after the house, and meanwhile Miss
  Ethel and yourself are coming over to my place to stay till you can get
  settled again. Now, don't waste any time, because the sooner we're off the
  better. Just go upstairs and pack what you want, and we can get away in time
  for a bit of shooting before lunch."</p>

  <p>There was no denying the breezy hospitality of the speaker, and half an
  hour later the 'bus was rolling down the drive again in the direction of Sir
  Roger Keene's house. They pulled up at length under the big portico; the huge
  doors were thrown open, and the cosy hall sent out an inviting warmth. Roger
  stretched out his hand and helped Ethel to the ground.</p>

  <p>"As my future wife," he whispered; now, promise."</p>

  <p>And the look in Ethel's eyes answered the question.</p><br>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">"That," said Ethel Marsh judicially, "is the least stupid
  remark you have made during our five weeks' acquaintance."</p>

  <p>"Which means that I am improving," John Chesney murmured. "There is hope
  even for me. You cannot possibly understand how greatly I
  appreciate&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The sentence trailed off incoherently, as if the effort had been all too
  much. It was hard to live up to the mental brilliance of Ethel Marsh. She had
  had the advantage, too, of a couple of seasons in town, whilst Chesney was of
  the country palpably. She also had the advantage of being distractingly
  pretty.</p>

  <p>Really, she had hoped to make something of Chesney. It seemed to her that
  he was fitted for better things than tennis playing and riding and the like.
  It seemed strange that he should prefer this little cottage to the broader
  delights of surveying mankind from China to Peru.</p>

  <p>The man had possibilities, too. For instance, he knew how to dress. There
  was an air about his flannels, a suggestion in his Norfolk suits. He had the
  knack of the tie so that it sat just right, and his boots... A clean cut
  face, very tanned, deep, clear, gray eyes, very steady. He was like a dog
  attached very much to a careless master. The thing had been going on for five
  weeks.</p>

  <p>Ethel was staying with the Frodshams. They were poor for their position,
  albeit given to hospitality&mdash;at a price. Most people call this kind of
  thing taking in paying guests. It was a subject delicately veiled. Ethel had
  come down for a fortnight, and she had stayed five weeks. Verily the
  education of John Chesney was a slow process. Chesney was a visitor in the
  neighbourhood, too, he had a little furnished cottage just by the Goldney
  Park lodge gates, where a housekeeper did for him. As for the rest, he was
  silent. He was a very silent man.</p>

  <p>It was too hot for tennis, and the two had wandered into the woods. A tiny
  trout stream bubbled by, the oak and beech ferns were wet with the spray of
  it. Between the trees lances of light fell, shafts of sunshine on Ethel's
  hair and face. It was at this point that Chesney made the original remark. It
  slipped from him as naturally as if he had been accustomed to that kind of
  thing.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid you have got that from Mr. John Kennedy," Ethel said. "I am
  sure that you have seen Mr. Kennedy's comedy, 'Flies in Ointment.' Confess
  now!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I have," Chesney confessed accordingly. "I&mdash;I saw it the night
  it was produced. On the whole it struck me as rather a feeble thing."</p>

  <p>"Oh, really? We are getting on, Mr. Chesney. Let me tell you that I think
  it is the cleverest comedy I have ever seen."</p>

  <p>"Yes! In that case you like the part of Dorothy Kent?"</p>

  <p>Ethel's dainty colour deepened slightly. She glanced suspiciously at the
  speaker. But he was gazing solidly, stolidly into space&mdash;like a man who
  had just dined on beef. The idea was too preposterous. The idea of John
  Chesney chaffing her, chaffing anybody.</p>

  <p>"I thought perhaps you did," Chesney went on. "Mrs. Kent is a bit of a
  butterfly, a good sort at the bottom, but decidedly of the species
  lepidopteroe&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stop!" Ethel cried. "Where did you get that word from? Whence comes it in
  the vocabulary of a youth&mdash;a youth? Oh, you know what I mean."</p>

  <p>"I believe it is a general name for insects," Chesney said humbly. "Mrs.
  Kent is a good sort, but a little conceited. Apt to fancy herself, you know.
  Young widows of her type often do. She is tired of the artificial existence
  of town and goes off into the country where she leads the simple life. She
  meets a young man there, who, well, upon my word, is rather like me. He was a
  bit of an ass&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He was nothing of the kind," Ethel cried indignantly. "He was splendid.
  And he made that woman love him, he made her acknowledge that she had met her
  match at last. And he turned out to be one of the most brilliant&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear Miss Ethel, after all it was only a play. You remind me of 'Mrs.
  Kent,' and you say that I remind you of the hero of the play who&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I didn't, Mr. Chesney. I said nothing of the kind. It is unfair of
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"When the likeness is plain enough," Chesney said stubbornly. "You are
  Mrs. Kent, and I am the hero of the comedy. Do you think that there is any
  possibility that some day you and me&mdash;of course, not yet,
  but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Miss Marsh sat there questioning the evidence of her coral-pink ears. She
  knew that she was furiously angry because she felt so cool about it. She knew
  that the more furious one was, the more calm and self-contained the senses
  become. The man meant nothing, either&mdash;one could see that by the
  respectful expression of his eye. Still&mdash;-</p>

  <p>"You are quite wrong," Ethel said. "You have altogether misunderstood the
  'motif' of the play. I presume you know what a 'motif' is?"</p>

  <p>"I think so," Chesney said humbly. "It is a word they apply in music when
  you don't happen to understand what the composer&mdash;especially the modern
  composer&mdash;is driving at."</p>

  <p>"Oh, let it pass," Ethel said hopelessly. "You have misunderstood the gist
  of the play, then! Walter Severn' in the comedy is a man of singular points.
  He is a great author. Instead of being that woman's plaything, he is her
  merciless analyst. The great scene in the play comes when she finds this out.
  Now, you do not for a moment presume to put yourself on a level with Walter
  Severn, do you?"</p>

  <p>Chesney was bound to admit the height of his audacity. His eyes were fixed
  humbly on his Minerva, he was Telamachus seated at the feet of the goddess.
  And even yet he did not seem really cognisant of the enormity of his offence.
  He saw the sunlight on that sweetly serious face, he saw the beams playing
  with the golden meshes of her hair. No doubt he was fully conscious of his
  own inferiority, for he did not speak again. It was for him to wait. The
  silence deepened, in the heart of the wood a blackbird was piping madly on a
  blackthorn.</p>

  <p>"Before you go away," Chesney hazarded, "I should very much
  like&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But I am not going away, at least not yet. Besides, I have a purpose to
  serve. I am waiting until those impossible people leave Goldney Park. I
  understand that they have already gone, but on that head I am not sure. I
  want to go over the house. The late owner, Mr. Mainbrace, was a great friend
  of my family. Before he died he was so good as to express a wish that the
  heir to the property should come and see us, and&mdash;but that part is
  altogether too ridiculous. And as an only daughter&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I see," Chesney said reflectively. "The heir and yourself. It sounds
  ridiculous. Now, if you had been in the least like the romantic type of young
  woman, perhaps&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How do you know that I am not? Am I like Byron's woman: 'Seek roses in
  December, ice in June.' Well, perhaps you are right. After all, one doesn't
  find ice in June. However, the heir to the Goldney Park estate and myself
  never met. He let the place to those awful Gosway people for three years, and
  went abroad. There was not even the suspicion of a romance. But I am curious
  to see the house all the same."</p>

  <p>"Nothing easier, Miss Marsh. Let us go and see it after luncheon. The
  Gosways have gone, you may take my word for that, and only a caretaker is in
  possession. Will you come with me this afternoon?"</p>

  <p>The prospect was not displeasing. Miss Marsh poised it in her mind for a
  few moments. There was Chesney's education to be thought of as well. On the
  whole, she decided that there might be less pleasant ways of spending a hot
  August afternoon.</p>

  <p>"I think I'll come," she said, "I want to see the old furniture and the
  pictures. I love old furniture. Perhaps if the heir to the property had gone
  on his knees whilst I was seated on a priceless Chippendale settee, I
  might&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You might, but I don't think you would," Chesney interrupted. "What ever
  your faults may be I am sure you are not mercenary."</p>

  <p>"Really! How good of you! The thing that we are apt to call
  depravity&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is often another name for the promptings of poor human nature."</p>

  <p>Miss Marsh turned and stared at the speaker. Really, his education was
  progressing at a most amazing rate. Without the least sign of mental distress
  he had delivered himself of an epigram. There was quite a flavour of
  Piccadilly about it. And Chesney did not appear in the least conscious of his
  achievement. Ethel rose and shook out the folds of her dainty muslin
  dress.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it getting late?" she asked. "I'm sure it is lunch time. You can
  walk as far as the gate with me, and I will meet you here at three
  o'clock."</p>

  <p>She passed thoughtfully across the lawn to the house, her pretty brows
  knitted in a thoughtful frown. Was she giving her pupil too much latitude?
  Certainly he had begun to show symptoms of an audacious presumption, which in
  the earlier days had been conspicuous by its absence. Whereupon Miss Marsh
  sighed three times without being in the least aware of the painful fact.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">"This," said Chesney, "is the Norman Tower, built by John
  Mainbrace, who was the original founder of the family. The first two trees in
  the avenue of oaks that leads up to the house were planted by Queen
  Elizabeth. She also slept on several occasions in the house, indeed, the
  bedroom she occupied is intact to this day. The Virgin Queen seemed to pass
  most of her time apart from affairs of state, in occupying bedrooms, so that
  the descendants of her courtiers might be able to boast about it afterwards.
  Those who could not give the royal lady a shakedown had special bedrooms
  fitted up and lied about them. It was an innocent deception."</p>

  <p>Miss Marsh eyed her pupil distrustfully. The educational progress was
  flattering, and at the same time a little disturbing. She had never seen
  Chesney in this gay and frivolous, not to say, excited mood before. The man
  was positively glib. There were distant flashes of wit in his discourse, too.
  And where did he get so close and intimate a knowledge of the old house
  from?</p>

  <p>He knew every nook and corner. He took her through the grand old park
  where the herd of fallow deer were grazing, he showed her the Dutch and
  Italian gardens, he knew even the history of the sun-dial on the terrace. And
  yet they had not been within the house, though the great hall door stood
  hospitably open. They moved at length out of the glare of the sunshine into
  the grateful shadows. Glint of armour and gleam of canvas were all there.
  Ethel walked along in an ecstacy of quiet enjoyment. Rumour had not lied as
  to the artistic beauties of Goldney Park. The Mainbraces must have been a
  tasteful family. They had it all here from the oaken carvings of the
  wandering monks down through Grinling Gibbins and Pugin, and away to
  Chippendale and Adam, and other masters of the Georgian era. They came at
  length to the chamber sacred to the Virgin Queen, they contemplated the
  glorious view from the window in silent appreciation tinged with rapture.</p>

  <p>"It's exquisite," Ethel said in a low voice. "If this were my house I
  should be very much tempted to commit an act of sacrilege. I should want this
  for my own room. I'm afraid I could not resist such an opportunity."</p>

  <p>"Easily done," said Chesney. "No trouble to discover from the family
  archives that a mistake had been made and that Elizabeth of blessed memory
  had not slept in this room. Being strong minded she preferred a north aspect,
  and this is due south. You would get a reputation for sound historical
  knowledge as well."</p>

  <p>Certainly the education was progressing. But Ethel let it pass. She was
  leaning out of the latticed windows with the creamy roses about her hair, she
  was falling unconsciously under the glamour of the place.</p>

  <p>"It is exquisite," she sighed. "If this were only mine!"</p>

  <p>"Well, it is not too late. The heir will be here before long probably. You
  have only to introduce the name of Mr. Mainbrace and say who you are, and
  then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no. If I happened to be in love with a man&mdash;what am I saying? Of
  course, no girl who respects herself could possibly marry a man for the sake
  of his position. Even 'Mrs. Dorothy Kent,' to whom you compared me this
  morning was above that kind of thing. She married the man she loved after
  all, you know. But I forgot&mdash;you did not think much of the comedy."</p>

  <p>"I didn't. I thought it was vague and incomplete. I am certain of it now.
  This is the real thing, the other was merely artificial. And when the hero
  brought 'Dorothy Kent' to the home of his ancestors he already knew, that she
  loved him. And I am glad to know that you would never marry a man like that
  because it gives me courage&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Gives you courage! Whatever for?"</p>

  <p>"Why, to make a confession. You laughed at me just now when I presumed to
  criticise your favourite modern comedy. As a matter of fact, I have every
  right to criticise it. You see, I happen to be the author. I am 'John
  Kennedy!' I have been writing for the stage, or trying to write for the stage
  for years. I got my new idea from that old wish of my uncles that you and I
  should come together. It struck me as a pretty suggestion for a comedy."</p>

  <p>"Stop, stop," Ethel cried. "One thing at a time, if you please. Positively
  you overwhelm me with surprise. In one breath you tell me that you are 'John
  Kennedy' and then, without giving a poor girl a chance, you say you are the
  owner of Goldney Park."</p>

  <p>"But I didn't," Chesney protested. "I never said anything of the
  kind."</p>

  <p>"No, but you inferred it. You say you got the idea from your uncle&mdash;I
  mean the suggestion that you and I&mdash;oh, I really cannot say it."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I'm but a poor dramatist after all," Chesney said lamely. "I
  intended to keep that confession till after I had&mdash;but no matter. At any
  rate, there is no getting away from the fact that my pen name is 'John
  Kennedy.'"</p>

  <p>"And you wrote 'Flies in Ointment?' And you have been laughing at me all
  this time? You were amused because I took you for a simple countryman, you
  whom men call the Sheridan of to-day! After all the pains I took with your
  education."</p>

  <p>Ethel's voice rose hysterically. Points of flame stood out from the level
  of her memory of the past five weeks and scorched her. How this man must have
  been amused, how consumedly he must have laughed at her! And she had never
  guessed it, never once had she had an inkling of the truth.</p>

  <p>"You have behaved disgracefully, cruelly," she said unsteadily.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," Chesney said coolly. "After all is said and done, we
  were both posing, you know. You were playing 'Mrs. Kent' to my hero. It
  seemed a pity to disturb so pleasant a pastoral. And no harm has been
  done."</p>

  <p>Ethel was not quite so sure of that. But then for the nonce she was
  regarding the matter from a strictly personal point of view.</p>

  <p>"I hardly think you were playing the game," she said.</p>

  <p>"Why not? I come down here where nobody knows me. It is my whim to keep
  quiet the fact that Goldney Park belongs to me. As to my dramatic tastes,
  they don't concern anybody but myself. I take a cottage down here until those
  tenants of mine are ready to go. They are such utter bounders that I have no
  desire to disclose my identity to them. And so it falls about that I meet
  you. Then I recollect all that my uncle has said about you. I cultivate your
  acquaintance. It wasn't my fault that you took me for a countryman with no
  idea beyond riding a horse and shooting a pheasant. Your patronage was very
  pretty and pleasing, and I am one of those men who always laughs or cries
  inside. It is, perhaps, a misfortune that I can always joke with a grave
  face. But don't forget that the man who laughs inside is also the man who
  bleeds inside, and these feel the worse. Come, Ethel, you are not going to be
  angry because you have lost the game playing with your own weapons."</p>

  <p>The education was finished, the schoolmaster was abroad&mdash;very much
  abroad. In his cool, masterful way Chesney had taken matters into his own
  hands. He was none the less handsome because he looked so stern, so sure of
  his ground.</p>

  <p>"You are a man and I am a woman," she faltered.</p>

  <p>"Of course, how could the comedy proceed otherwise? Now where shall we
  move these Elizabethan relics? After what you said just now they could not
  possibly remain here. Among the family archives I dare say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Chesney paused, he was conscious of the fact that two large diamond drops
  were stealing down Ethel's cheeks. It seemed the most natural thing in the
  world for him to cross over and take her hands in his.</p>

  <p>"My dear child, what have I said to pain you," he said. "I am truly
  sorry."</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;you take too much for granted," Ethel sobbed. "You make me feel
  so small and silly. And you have no right to assume that I&mdash;I could care
  for anybody simply because he happens to possess a p&mdash;p&mdash;place like
  Goldney Park&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But, my darling, I didn't. I was delighted when you said just now that
  you would never marry a man you did not care for, even if he could give you
  Chippendale for breakfast, so to speak. I watched your face then. I am sure
  that you were speaking from the bottom of your heart. I have been watching
  you for the last five weeks, my sweetheart. And they have been the happiest
  weeks in my life."</p>

  <p>"Laughing at me, I suppose. It's all the same if you do laugh inside."</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think I laughed," Chesney said thoughtfully. "I only know
  that I have been very much charmed. And besides, see how useful it has been
  to me to be in a position to hear all the weak points in my literary armour.
  When I come to write my next comedy it will be far in advance of 'Flies in
  Ointment.' I have learnt so much of human nature, you see."</p>

  <p>Ethel winked the tears from her lids, her eyes were all the brighter for
  the passing shower, like a sky in April, Chesney thought. A smile was on her
  face, her lips were parted. As a lover Chesney was charming. She wondered how
  she was playing her part. But she need not have had any anxiety. There was
  nothing wanting in the eyes of the man opposite, and his face said so.</p>

  <p>"You are going to put me into it?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Why, of course. There is no other woman so far as I can see. Why are you
  pulling my roses to pieces like that? Do you know that that rose-tree was
  planted a hundred years ago by Thomas a'Beckett, after the battle of
  Agincourt? My dear, I am so happy that I could talk nonsense all day. And I
  say, Ethel&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The girl broke off one of the creamy roses and handed it shyly to
  Chesney.</p>

  <p>"Vae victis," she said with a flushing smile. "It is yours. You have
  conquered."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but I want all the fruits of victory. I ask for a hand and you give
  me a rose. Am I not going to have the hand as well as the rose, dear?"</p>

  <p>He had the hand and the rose and the slender waist, he drew her towards
  him in his strong, masterful way, and his lips lay on hers in a lingering
  pressure. It was a long time before the girl looked up, then her eyes were
  full of shy happiness.</p>

  <p>"What are you thinking about, darling?" Chesney asked.</p>

  <p>"'Mrs. Kent,'" Ethel said demurely. "I know now why she met her master.
  And I know now why I met mine. And the new comedy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Will be played out here between you and me, and it will never be written
  for the sake of a dull and indiscriminating public, sweetheart. I'll play my
  part&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And I'll try to play mine," Ethel whispered, as she laid her head cosily
  on the shoulder of her lover. "I will not be very original, Jack, and I hope
  you will not be disappointed."</p>

  <p>"No fear," Jack said pithily. "No fear of that&mdash;'Mrs. Kent.'"</p><br>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Otago Witness</i>, New Zealand, 24 Mar 1909, page

  <p>THE ROOM was in that artistic semi-darkness which adapts itself to the
  well-appointed dinner table. The meal was there, too, cooling under silver
  dishes half-hidden amongst a mass of green asparagus fern and flaming red
  tulips. One of the crimson blossoms had fallen out of place, and Mark Crunden
  stepped across and replaced it mechanically.</p>

  <p>"I might have guessed you would do that," his wife said bitterly. "It is
  so typical of you. Ever you have been wasting your life and mine upon
  trifles."</p>

  <p>"I have done my best for you and the child," Crunden murmured.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I know," Kate retorted. "Four years ago we were fairly well off.
  This house belonged to us. It was a joy and a pleasure to furnish it as we
  have done. And now how do we stand? The house has been sold, every stick and
  stone here is in the hands of the moneylenders, indeed, I was hard put to it
  to get the flowers for the dinner-table to night. And this, all because
  you've forgotten wife and child in pursuit of a theory. You are just as bad
  as the man who gambles away everything at Monte Carlo. But you need not look
  at me like that&mdash;our friends are not coming here to-night. I put them
  off by telegram, and now I'll go. You can take off your dress coat and go
  back to your books again. And as for me, well, I have friends who will be
  glad enough to have me for the present. And that is all arranged. I have
  ordered a cab to be at the door in half an hour for Nest and myself. We
  shan't trouble you any more. If you cared for me as you should... if you had
  ever cared for me as you should&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are quite wrong." Crunden said quietly. "You will not believe me when
  I say that I have never ceased to care for you," although perhaps&mdash;but
  tell me why you have made up your mind to leave me in this drastic fashion?
  What have I done to-day that is worse than yesterday or the day before?"</p>

  <p>For answer, Kate Crunden took from her pocket a small square of yellow
  cardboard. She tossed it half bitterly, half contemptuously amongst the
  flowers on the table. Crunden lifted it from the table, and his sensitive
  face flushed.</p>

  <p>"Where did you get this from?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I found it," his wife said. "It dropped out of your pocket when I was
  clearing up your dressing-room this morning. It relates to a pearl cross,
  pawned by you for £150. And I am taking the child with me. Of course, I know
  that, legally speaking&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A moment later, Mark Crunden was alone. He stood there in the
  perfectly-appointed dining room, trying to realise what he had lost. And now
  suddenly he had come to his senses. He was utterly and entirely ruined; he
  would have to leave that luxurious flat and start life entirely afresh.</p>

  <p>In the course of the last four years there was only one sensible thing he
  could recollect having done. He had insured his life for £10,000, and by some
  extraordinary stroke of luck he had managed to keep up the premiums. Two days
  before he had recollected that the next premium was due, and that he had not
  as many pence as he required pounds to keep the policy alive. He had taken
  the cross and For one whole day he had sat in his study thinking the matter
  out. Gradually and by slow degrees he began to see his way. He was a failure,
  he had spoilt his own life, and he had dragged his wife's down to his own
  level. And then he began to see his way. It would be quite a simple thing to
  cheat the insurance company. There were ways of doing that to a scientific
  man like himself. For instance, there was his friend Bashford, who had the
  flat immediately below.</p>

  <p>Bashford was a bacteriologist&mdash;in his laboratory there were scores of
  cults&mdash;on those little gelatine tablets death in a thousand hideous
  forms lurked. Really, the thing was ridiculously easy. Bashford was away for
  the day, and Crunden I had the run of his flat. It might mean anything from a
  long, lingering illness to a sudden death, and then Kate would be free.</p>

  <p>Crunden did not care to question the morality of his action over the pearl
  cross. That was past and done with, at any rate. All he had to do now was to
  go down to Bashford's flat and choose his own method of settling his great
  account. He had Bashford's spare latchkey in his pocket. He knew that the
  latter would not be back until midnight, and he was quite aware of the fact
  that Bashford's deaf old housekeeper would be in bed by this time. Really,
  there was nothing in the way.</p>

  <p>He was in the laboratory at length; he switched on the electric light.
  Everything was exactly as he had expected to find it. In an air-tight glass
  case rows of tubes were half filled with opaque masses of gelatine. Crunden
  studied them all studiously and coldly. He opened a glass case presently and
  took out one of three tiny tubes which were labelled with the mystic formula
  represented in plain English by "Asiatic Cholera." He slipped this into his
  pocket, and made his way back into his own study.</p>

  <p>He stood there just a moment with the tube in his hand, trembling
  violently from head to foot. He wiped away the perspiration which streamed
  down his face; he wondered vaguely why he could be curious enough to listen
  to what a newsboy was shouting in the street below...</p>

  <p>He dropped the broken pieces of the phial into the heart of the fire. He
  sat down calmly to read and smoke. He could hear the servants clearing away
  the unused dinner things now. A parlourmaid came into the library presently
  and asked if anything further was wanted before she went to bed. She had
  three or four letters on a tray, and Crunden asked her mechanically when they
  came.</p>

  <p>"By the 9 o'clock post, sir," the girl explained. "I heard you go out,
  sir, just now, and I thought that you had taken them in yourself."</p>

  <p>Crunden stretched out his hand for the letters. He recollected that he had
  seen them in the box. He opened them carelessly, with a smile. Really,
  letters did not much matter to him now. Two of them were peremptory requests
  for payment of accounts, a third was an invitation to dinner, and the last
  letter bore the imprint of a firm of solicitors who transacted all the
  business on behalf of Crunden's uncle, James Broadwood. Crunden cast his eye
  over it carelessly enough then he leapt to his feet and held the letter to
  the light.</p>

  <p class="letter">Dear Sir,</p>

  <p class="letter">With much regret we have to inform you, of the death of
  your uncle Mr James Broadwood, which took place at Nice on Monday last week.
  One of our representatives was with him at the time, having been summoned for
  the purpose of making our late client's will. Mr Broadwood died in a
  painfully sudden manner before this could be done, and, as he himself had
  destroyed his last will, we have to inform you that the whole ot the property
  reverts to you. As you are aware, this amounts to something over £100,000,
  and we await your instructions in the matter. Would you kindly give us a
  call? &mdash;Yours faithfully,</p>

  <p class="letter"><small>HARTOPP AND EVANS.</small></p>

  <p>The intense silence of the flat rang in Crunden's ears as if the whole
  place were full of ghostly machinery. It seemed to him presently that he
  could hear the sound of a latchkey in the front door, and that he could hear
  his wife's voice, and the eager tones of the child as if speaking through
  tears. It was no effort of his imagination; the whole thing was real
  enough.</p>

  <p>Crunden groaned. "She has come back again. What, what is going to happen
  now?"</p>

  <p>At that moment Crunden came nearer to common sense and absolute sanity
  than he had been for years. It was wonderful how plainly he saw things now.
  His outlook was none the less lucid, because it was too late to repair the
  mischief.</p>

  <p>He would have to bear the thing as best hs could. He knew perfectly well
  that he had seen the last of his wife. She might have come back to the flat
  for some pressing reason or another, but not to see him. He clenched his
  teeth tightly together, and made up his mind that no agony shou!d force
  itself from his lips.</p>

  <p>Why, he asked himself, had Kate come back again? He was very soon to learn
  that. He could hear everything that was going on in the dining room.</p>

  <p>"And now you must go to bed," Kate was saying. "It is quite time all
  little children were fast asleep."</p>

  <p>Crunden could hear the child laugh.</p>

  <p>"But I am not sleepy," she protested. "You said you weren't coming back
  again here yet. And why didn't we stay with Aunt May? And what was she crying
  about? I saw her."</p>

  <p>"Did you, dearie?" Kate asked absently. "Well, you see, she is in great
  trouble. She is just as fond of her little girl as I am of you. And just
  before we got there the doctor came to see Dorothy, and he was very much
  afraid that she is going to have a horrible thing that they call scarlet
  fever. That's why we couldn't stay there, and that's why Auntie May made me
  come back here for the present. And, you see, I haven't got any money to go
  anywhere else. You must try not to be disappointed."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am not," the child said cheerfully. "I am sorry for Dorothy, but
  not a bit sorry for myself. And so long as I have you and daddy, the rest
  doesn't matter a bit."</p>

  <p>"You mustn't worry daddy," Kate went on. "You see, he's very busy just
  now, and there are many things&mdash;now you got to bed."</p>

  <p>"Not without seeing daddy," the child said firmly.</p>

  <p>Crunden crossed the floor swiftly and locked the door. He was beginning to
  realise now that there was a torture and a mental pain which was equal at
  least to the rack and stress of the body. He quivered as he heard the child
  tap gently at the door. He called out in a muffled voice that he would come
  to Nest's bedroom presently.</p>

  <p>He heard the small feet patter away disconsolately, then he bent forward
  once again as the pain gripped him once more. This time the spasm was longer
  and more acute. When it had passed away he had barely strength to raise
  himself from his chair.</p>

  <p>He would not let things go on like this Kate must really know. It would be
  better in the long run that she should know. He dragged himself across to the
  writing table and commenced to scrawl a few words hurriedly on a sheet of
  notepaper. The letter was not addressed to his wife, but to Bashford. It was
  chaotic enough; only a few words&mdash;barely legible, but it seemed to
  Crunden that it would serve his purpose. It would be sufficient at any rate
  to tell Bashford what had happened, and why this hideous thing had been
  done.</p>

  <p>There was also a hint to the effect that the writer had received a letter
  from his solicitors intimating that there would be more than sufficient for
  Kate and the child. Crunden managed to scribble the address of this firm,
  then the pains were upon him again, and for the next five minutes his mind
  seemed almost to leave him.</p>

  <p>Once more the trouble passed; once more he was able to see clearly. He did
  not know that the letter was crushed tightly in his left hand, and he was
  quite under the impression that it was still lying on the table. He managed
  to unlock the door. It occurred to him at that moment that a locked door
  might be regarded with some suspicion. He was absolutely out of control now.
  He had no longer any grip upon himself. He lay there clutching at the carpet;
  he realised presently that Kate was bending over him and trying to lift him
  from the floor.</p>

  <p>"What can I do?" she whispered. "What is the trouble?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," Crunden said faintly. "Bashford&mdash;send for Bashford.
  Go and fetch, him."</p>

  <p>"And leave you here like this! Oh, I cannot!"</p>

  <p>Kate flew from the room, closing the door behind her, and the next moment
  she was hammering at the door of Bashford's flat.</p>

  <p>"My husband!" she gasped. "He is asking for you. I am sure he is dying.
  Will you come at once?"</p>

  <p>Bashford looked grim and hard as he bent over the prostrate body of his
  friend. His quick, keen glance took in the creased edge of the paper which
  Crunden was convlusively clenching in his left hand.</p>

  <p>"Hot water," he said, curtly. "Hot water at once. Try and keep cool;
  everything depends upon your courage now. Yes, I know exactly what has
  happened. Crunden has been a little too enthusiastic in his scientific
  researches. Now, please."</p>

  <p>Kate hurried off. Directly she had left the room Bashford stooped down and
  forced Cvunden's frozen fingers open. He ran a quick eye over the scrawled
  words he raced to his flat and hurried across to the glase case where the
  specimen tubes were placed. It needed only a glance to see which one of them
  was missing; then Bashford was in full possession of the facts, as if Crunden
  had told him everything.</p>

  <p>"I shall be just in time," he murmured. "It is perhaps a fortunate thing
  that that particular phial should have contained a cultus a little less
  virulent than the others. And now for the remedy. I didn't expect such a
  speedy opportunity of trying my new cure. Still&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bashford was back in Crunden's flat a moment later, with a tiny bottle of
  some dark-coloured fluid, and a hypodermic syringe.</p>

  <p>He bared the arm of the patient; he saw the slight shiver that ran through
  Cnmdsn's body as the needle pricked, him, then gradually the rigid limbs
  began to relax, and the patient breathed freely.</p>

  <p>When Kate came in a few minutes later with the hot water she could see by
  the expression of Bashford's face that he was satisfied. She wondered perhaps
  why it was that he paid no attention to the hot water</p>

  <p>"There is no occasion for that now," he said. "All we have to do is to get
  Crunden to bed and keep him warm. I will come in again the first thing in the
  morning, but I am quite sure that he will go on all right now."</p>

  <p>"You are very good," Kate murmured.</p>

  <p>"Oh, how glad I am that I was at home. And I am only here quite by
  accident. And he might have lain here and died, and I should have been none
  the wiser. But won't you tell me what it is? Won't you tell me what my
  husband has been suffering from?"</p>

  <p>"I will tell you a great deal presently," Bashford said, with a certain
  grim emphasis. "Only you must help me to get him to bed first. You needn't be
  in the least afraid. He will sleep quite soundly, till morning now, and if
  you want me, I shall be close at hand. Now let us get him to bed."</p>

  <p>It was an hour later before Bashford left, and in that time he had had a
  deal to say. Usually he was a man of a few words enough, but now he was
  eloquent. Kate Crunden listened with close attention, and when at length the
  door had closed behind Bashford she sat down in a chair in front of the fire,
  seeing stranger pictures in the glowing coals than ever she had seen before.
  For it is not an easy thing for a woman to admit after all these years that
  she might have been wrong.</p>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p>Crunden opened his eyes and stared feebly about him. He was wondering
  where the light came from he lay there waiting for the next pain to grip him.
  He could not quite understand how he came to find himself in bed like this,
  and why the sun was shinng so brightly. A cool breath of air blew over bis
  face; it seemed to him that he could smell violets somewhere. He felt
  somewhat weak, too; he had a difficulty in raising his head. Then he saw that
  he was in his own room.</p>

  <p>The place was more trim and tidy than, he had ever seen it before. There
  wae no litter of discarded clothing upon the floor as usual. Probably he had
  managed to drag himself to his voom and to get into bed, and for some
  extraordinary reason, he had slept till morning.</p>

  <p>He began to wonder what had happened the previous night. He could not get
  rid of a haunting idea that his wife had found him there; he could still feel
  the touch of her arm about his neck. And here she was, bending over him with
  a quivering smile on her face, and asking him, with deep anxiety in her
  voice, how he felt.</p>

  <p>Why, she had not spoken to him like that for two whole years. She looked
  just the same as she had done in the happy days which he had thought he had
  put behind him for ever. He could feel her hands under his head lifting his
  pillow, he could feel the caress of her cool fingers on his hair. And, above
  all, there was the tender glorious smile which he never ought to have lost,
  and which was his at one time for the asking. And, the wonder of it all was
  that here it was back again, and he had done absolutely nothing to deserve
  it.</p>

  <p>"Kate," he murmured dreamily, "Kate."</p>

  <p>She bent over him suddenly and kissed him. His arms were not so weak now
  they were not too weak to hold her to him for a moment. Then in some sudden
  way he knew that she understood, and that the whole story was hers as if he
  had told her. Here was something far better, then, than all those illusive
  phantom searches into the unattainable. He could see now how little it
  profited him to risk his own happiness in pursuit of the impossible. It was
  some little time before be spoke.</p>

  <p>"Who told you, dear?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Kate sat there smiling and happy now.</p>

  <p>"It was Mr Bashford firet," she said. "It was only last night it all
  happened. I have come back because&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know all that," Crunden interrupted. "I heard you telling Nest
  when you returned. And I was afraid to see the child because I felt that I
  was dying them. Perhaps I shall make you understand in time that
  I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh I understand now," Kate went on. "I suppose you came to your senses. I
  suppose you realised your folly when it was almost too late. I don't know if
  we should really have found out if it hadn't been for that letter which Mr
  Bashford found in your hand. It is wonderful to see how he puts things
  together, but he didn't understand why you had done this thing, for he knew
  nothing about the pearl cross, for example. And now let me see if I can guess
  why you took the cross. You took it so that you could pay the premium on your
  insurance and leave little Nest and myself in comfort. Then after you had
  done this thing, after you had gone down to Mr Bashford's laboratory and
  possessed yourself of the awful stuff, you received a letter from the
  solicitors. I know all about that, because one of the firm has been inquiring
  for you this morning. And thank Heaven you are all right again now; you will
  be yourself again in a week or two. It was a noble thing to do."</p>

  <p>"Most people would think not," Crunden said. "As a matter of fact, it was
  a cowardly thing to do. Still, if you will try to forgive me for what I have
  done&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Kate smiled through her tears.</p>

  <p>"Forgive you," she cried. "Why, you never asked for it. If you had only
  uttered one word of regret, I should have known then what I know now, that in
  spite of all I have never ceased to care for you. And, besides, how could I
  feel anything but affection for a man who loves Nest too?"</p><br>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY ALEC BALL</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. XXIX, Apr 1909, pp
  647-654</h3><br>

  <p class="first">THE true story of the loss of the great pearl necklace has
  yet to be written. Of course, at the time it occupied the gossipy Society
  papers almost to the exclusion of everything else. Many journalists of the
  paragraphic type professed to give the authentic details, but as every paper
  varied in these matters, the general public felt that it had yet a good deal
  to learn. And the general public was right, because in no instance had a
  single one of those veracious journals come anywhere near the truth.</p>

  <p>Of course, everybody knows the parties concerned in the story. For
  instance, there were Sir David Cordy and his daughter, together with Mr.
  George Goldsack, the wealthy American who subsequently married Miss Maud
  Cordy, but of Peter Prouse no mention was made. And as he was practically the
  hero of the romance, it will be seen at once that any true history of the
  missing necklace must be incomplete without him. But it was to Peter Prouse
  and nobody else that the whole merit of the scheme was due. But it will be
  just as well at this point, perhaps, to recapitulate the main facts, for the
  public has a short memory in these matters, and is apt to forget one
  sensation in the presence of another.</p>

  <p>As everybody knows, Sir David Cordy is an exceedingly rich man. It really
  doesn't matter very much how he got his money, seeing that he was in absolute
  possession of it, and that he was the owner of one of the most magnificent
  houses in London. He was the owner, too, of many houses elsewhere, which
  embraced some of the finest partridge and grouse shooting in the country. He
  also possesses a steam-yacht which is a perfect dream in its way, and as he
  is inclined to lavish hospitality, he has a large and increasing circle of
  friends. In public, at any rate, nobody would venture to speak of Sir David
  as an unscrupulous and cold-blooded scoundrel, but there are a good many hard
  business men in the City of London who would not have the slightest
  hesitation in applying that epithet to him. Still, he has always managed to
  keep within the limits of the law; in fact, he employs half-a-dozen tame
  lawyers whose business it is to find out exactly how far he can go without
  bringing himself within reach of the lasso of the law. He is an exceedingly
  rich man, he gives great entertainments, and therefore he has no trouble
  whatever in finding himself welcome everywhere. There are a score of such men
  to-day, and some of them are not without honours, parliamentary and
  otherwise.</p>

  <p>It was about this time that the announcement of the engagement between
  Miss Maud Cordy and Mr. George Goldsack was announced. Apart from the
  importance of the affair and the prominent position of the engaged couple,
  there were novel features which appealed to the Society press. For instance,
  Mr. Goldsack was one of the richest men in America, and for once he was
  reversing the programme. He was the rich American who was seeking a wife in
  England. He had just pulled off some big scheme of a corner in food of some
  sort; in fact, he had been successful in one of those rascally operations in
  which a certain type of American business man seems to delight. But as he had
  been succeasful, instead of emerging with disgraceful bankruptcy, Society
  clutched him to its bosom, and he found himself made much of. This was going
  to be the plutocratic marriage of the Season, and Sir David expanded
  accordingly. It was his bounden duty to give his daughter a present the like
  of which had never been seen before. There was no doubt from the first as to
  what form the present would take, seeing that a man of Sir David's
  antecedents and instincts can never possibly soar outside the regions of
  costly jewellery. Finally it was decided that the gift should take the shape
  of a pearl necklafce. Sir David had been dealing in pearls lately, and by
  means of a peculiarly sharp "spec" he had managed to get possession of some
  sixty pearls of remarkable purity far below their market value. They were
  honestly worth a thousand pounds apiece, even at their wholesale price, which
  fact Sir David did not conceal from such journalists as came along and asked
  personal questions. Long before the wedding-day everybody knew that Miss
  Cordy was going to have this unique thing amongst necklaces, and, indeed, it
  had been exhibited in the window of a Bond Street jeweller. It had been
  photographed too, for some of the illustrated papers.</p>

  <p>In his dingy lodgings out Soho way, Peter Prouse read all about these
  things. He was getting on in life now, and his prospects were not so good as
  they might have been. He was a brilliantly clever man in his way, but like so
  many other brilliant men, he had managed to make a failure of his life.
  Incidentally he had been in jail, where he had served three years' penal
  servitude for a fraud in which he always argued he had been little or none to
  blame. One or two of his intimates were told that the real culprit was a man
  now rolling in wealth and luxury. And though he discreetly mentioned no
  names, there were certain people who knew quite well that Sir David Cordy was
  the man aimed at. And though it doesn't matter for the purpose of this story
  how far this is correct, it may at once be said that this was substantially
  true, and that, but for Cordy and certain forgotten transactions, Prouse
  would have probably been moving in very different circles to-day. As it was,
  he had a precarious and doubtful existence, more or less connected with
  advertisements and the cheaper press. Sometimes these led to comparative
  affluence, sometimes they left Prouse stranded on a very barren shore indeed.
  These adventures necessitated a constant change of address and a modest
  concealment of name under initials and other aliases of that sort. But for
  the last ten years Prouse had managed to evade the police, and at the time
  the story opens he was in a position of comparative affluence.</p>

  <p>He sat there reading the papers and smoking cigarettes and discussing
  matters generally with his wife. She was considerably younger than himself,
  rather dainty and refined and innocent-looking. But it must not be inferred
  from this that she suffered any pangs of conscience or passed sleepless
  nights thinking of the ill-spent life of the man whom she was supposed to
  love, honour and obey. On the contrary, she was proud of his talents, and on
  more than one occasion §he had proved exceedingly useful in Prouse's little
  schemes of relieving the general public of the necessity of looking after its
  superfluous cash.</p>

  <p>"What a world it is!" Mr, Prouse said. "Now, if this chap had his deserts,
  he would be in jail long ago. Instead of which, he's got more than he knows
  how to do with, and now he's going to marry his daughter to a man richer than
  himself. And he's going to give her a present which will be worth £60,000.
  Like to have a look at it, Maria? Here's a photograph of it in <i>The Looking
  Glass</i>. There's going to be a big reception in Park Lane next week so that
  the girl's friends can inspect the presents, and I see about sixty favoured
  guests are dining afterwards. I should like to get hold of those pearls! Why,
  they'd sell for a thousand pounds apiece anywhere. If I had that little lot,
  I could make at least £50,000, and then we could go and buy ourselves a
  little place in the country, same as you're always talking about. Upon my
  word, Maria, if I could do that man out of that necklace, I'd feel inclined
  almost to give it away. I'd like to get even with him. It's a different man
  I'd be if I had never come in contact with David Cordy."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Prouse murmured her sympathy. She had heard this story a score of
  times before. But the prospect of comparative wealth and the little place in
  the country appealed to her. She recognised the fact that Peter was getting
  on in life, and that as yet he had made no provision for his old age.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that's out of our reach," she said regretfully. "Besides, it's
  altogether too big a thing."</p>

  <p>"I'm not altogether sure of that," Prouse said thoughtfully. "I was
  thinking about it last night. They say that hatred sharpens one's wits. Not
  that I am much of a fool at any time. How much money do we happen to
  have?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, we haven't been lucky lately," Mrs. Prouse replied. "I suppose I've
  got a matter of about seventy pounds upstairs."</p>

  <p>Prouse smiled approvingly.</p>

  <p>"That's good enough," he said. "I suppose I can count upon you if you're
  wanted?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Prouse's pride was properly up in arms. She wanted to know if there
  had ever been a time when her husband could not count upon her. She reminded
  him pungently of the one or two occasions upon which her courage and resource
  had been the means of averting considerable trouble. Prouse duly apologised.
  He surveyed his wife's dainty prettiness and demure innocence with approval.
  Should he tell her his scheme or not? he asked himself. Perhaps it would be
  just as well not to trust her too far, for even the cleverest of women are
  apt to develop hysterical symptoms in moments of crises.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said, "you shall know all about it later on. Meanwhile, I
  shall want about forty pounds of the money you've got upstairs, and if that
  forty pounds don't multiply itself by a thousand before the week's out, then
  my name isn't Peter Prouse. It's the right time of the year, too, and, so far
  as I can see, everything is in our favour. Now, don't ask a lot of questions,
  because I'm busy. All you've got to do is to act just as I tell you, and you
  shall have your little place in the country yet. As for me, I'm going down to
  St. Albans this evening, and I mayn't be back till to-morrow morning. Let's
  have the coin, old girl."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Prouse fetched the money without protest, and discreetly refrained
  from asking unnecessary questions. Prouse duly returned from St. Albans the
  following day, apparently on the best of terms with himself. He asked if a
  big parcel had come for him, and Mrs. Prouse replied in the affirmative. She
  saw her husband leave the house presently neatly dressed and clean shaven,
  with his eyes smiling blandly behind gold-rimmed spectacles. He looked for
  all the world like a shopwalker or gentlemanly assistant in a West-end
  business, as his wife did not forget to inform him. The remark seemed to
  please him, for he muttered something to the effect that that was exactly
  what he meant to convey.</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p>Sir David was busy, as usual, and he was slightly annoyed to be stopped in
  this way at the moment when he was leaving his house for the City. But
  possibly this smooth-spoken young man represented some West-end
  establishment, and Sir David was graciously pleased to give him five minutes
  of his time.</p>

  <p>"My name is Balin,sir; I represent the firm of Messrs. Larkspur and Son,
  of Paris," the discreet young man murmured. "No doubt. Sir David, you have
  heard of Larkspur. The famous Paris florists, you know. We've just opened a
  branch in London. I thought, perhaps, if you haven't given your orders for
  the flowers for Miss Cordy's reception next Thursday&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I can't be bothered with that," Cordy grunted.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me just for the moment, sir. You see, we work on different lines
  to the English florists. We supply flowers of an infinitely superior quality,
  and we make arrangements to take them back again. I can assure you, sir, that
  we can do you at half the price you paid Collins and Sons for the flowers for
  the big dance which you gave last week. I believe the scheme then, sir, was
  roses, was it not? For less money than that we will undertake a scheme which
  calls exclusively for the use of orchids. You see, sir, we could use the
  orchids again, as they are flowers which last a wonderfully long time, and
  nobody would be the least the wiser, if you care to favour us."</p>

  <p>Sir David was just a little impressed. In spite of all his money, he
  dearly loved a bargain, and he would have gone a long way to save a sixpence.
  And the suggestion of the scheme of orchids appealed to him.</p>

  <p>"I don't dislike your idea," Sir David said patronisingly, "but
  unfortunately my arrangements&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"One moment, sir, just one moment. We are exceedingly anxious to get the
  custom of anyone like yourself. If you will permit me, I shall be exceedingly
  glad to decorate the tables where Miss Cordy's presents appear entirely with
  the green and gold orchids which created such a sensation last week in Paris,
  when the President was entertaining his royal visitors. These orchids are
  quite new, and cannot be bought for money. If you will permit me, I will
  decorate the tables with these flowers, and subsequently they can be moved to
  the dining-room for your dinner-party. I will send one of the cleverest of
  floral designers in London, and we shall be only too pleased to send the
  flowers and fetch them away without any charge whatever. The advertisement
  will more than repay us for the trouble we are taking."</p>

  <p>Sir David promptly closed with the offer. It was one that appealed to his
  business instincts. It would cost him nothing, and it would be quite a
  piquant little item for the newspapers afterwards. He stood there chatting on
  the steps with the gentlemanly representative of Larkspur and Son for quite a
  long time. It was arranged, at length, that the flowers should come in the
  following Thursday, the day before the wedding, about three o'clock, so that
  there would be plenty of time to get the scheme properly set out before Miss
  Cordy's guests began to arrive for the inspection of the wedding presents. As
  it was cold March weather, the orchids would be sent in specially constructed
  vans which the firm always used for that purpose.</p>

  <p>"I am greatly obliged to you, sir," Mr. Balin said. "Perhaps you might be
  good enough to drop a hint to your detective. I mean, sir, to the man from
  the private inquiry agency who always attends these functions to keep an eye
  on the presents."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I haven't forgotten that, you may be sure," Sir David said. "Yes, my
  good man, you are quite right. My detectives on these occasions always come
  from Parker and Lee, of Charing Cross. I generally have the same man&mdash;a
  most reliable creature of the name of Taddy. Perhaps you have met him?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, sir," Balin said. "We have frequently met in great houses in the
  West End. And I am really most grateful to you, sir. You may rely upon my
  absolute attentions."</p>

  <p>Cordy went his way with the air of a man who has done a good stroke of
  business. He was not quite so pleased, however, when he reached home early on
  the following Thursday afternoon to find that as yet there was no sign of the
  gentleman from Messrs. Larkspur or the deft-fingered young lady whose
  business it would be to arrange the orchids. Sir David fretted and fumed, for
  a man in his position naturally resents these little pin-pricks on the part
  of Providence. As a rule, they do not come into the scheme. But as the guests
  were beginning to arrive, and the dainty Society butterflies began to hover
  round the Empire tables on which the presents were laid out, Sir David was
  forced to control himself. The huge drawing-room was one blaze of electric
  lights now, the room was gradually filling with a chattering mob, and on the
  centre table furthest from the door lay the great pearl necklace. It was not
  much brighter than the many bright and envious eyes which were turned upon
  it, and as Sir David began to realise the importance of the occasion he
  expanded visibly. At the same moment half-a-dozen gorgeously attired footmen
  came in solemn procession bearing on silver salvers a really unique and
  beautiful collection of orchids. There was something so fine and
  distinguished about these gorgeous flowers that even the presents were
  forgotten for the moment. Behind the glittering cavalcade came the
  gentlemanly manager of Larkspur and Son, followed by a shrinking,
  modest-looking girl dressed in black, and apparently frightened and
  bewildered by the scheme of splendour in which she found herself.</p>

  <p><a id="pic3"

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300981h-images/TheLanguageOfFlowers1.jpg"
         title="On the centre table lay the great pearl necklace.">
  </div>

  <p>"It is quite the fault of my assistant, Sir David," Mr. Balin said. "She
  foolishly forgot my instructions. Now, Miss Gordon, please get to work at
  once."</p>

  <p>With this explanation, Mr. Balin vanished, and the shrinking girl
  proceeded to lay out her lovely flowers to the best advantage. She was
  dexterous enough in her work, and with a deft touch here and there proceeded
  to beautify the tables beyond recognition.</p>

  <p>Sir David looked on approvingly. So also did the dark, clean-shaven man in
  the frock-coat and black tie who hovered near the table with the air of a
  waiter who is not quite sure that his handiwork will meet with complete
  approval. He was disguised as a guest, of course, but obviously enough he was
  a man sent there by Parker and Lee for the purpose of keeping an eye on the
  presents.</p>

  <p>"Yes, they really are marvellous flowers," Sir David said pompously to an
  admiring guest. "I understand they were imported by my people especially from
  Paris. The collection originally belonged to an Oriental monarch. They tell
  me that this lot is worth a fabulous sum; that mixture of green and gold is
  superb. I understand they look far better on the dining-table. But you will
  have an opportunity of seeing that for yourself, my dear fellow. I must
  confess, for my own part, that I like something out of the common. If these
  things don't run to too great an amount, I think I shall buy them."</p>

  <p>The demure little assistant smiled. She quite appreciated the situation.
  It was so like the man there to boast that he had another collection of these
  famous orchids besides the glorious wealth of bloom on the table. At this
  moment the crowd surged back from the tables, for another set of gorgeous
  footmen came in with the tea. It was at this point, when the scene was at its
  best and brightest, that the light suddenly went out and the brilliant
  assembly was plunged in darkness.</p>

  <p>"Shut the door, sir," a voice said. "It's Taddy speaking to you. Sir
  David. I don't say it isn't all right, sir, but it's just possible that this
  is an impudent dodge&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Cordy waited to hear no more. He plunged headlong across the room and
  closed the door with a bang. Some man in the crowd produced a box of matches
  from his pocket, and one of the gorgeous footmen remembered the gas which was
  in the drawing-room besides the electric light. It was never used, but still
  the brackets were retained in case of accidents. But it was a minute or more
  before the flickering lights faintly illuminated the big saloon, but in that
  moment the mischief was done. Taddy gasped in dismay as he pointed to the
  centre table, where the big pearl necklace was now conspicuous by its
  absence.</p>

  <p>It is impossible adequately to convey the scene which followed. It was
  impossible too, to accuse anyone of the theft. For the next half-hour the
  bewildered guests huddled together, exchanging glances. And when the police,
  who had been frantically telephoned for, put in an appearance, they were
  equally at fault. As for Mr. Taddy, he could tell them nothing. The demure
  florist, standing by the table where she had been putting the finishing
  touches to the work, had seen and heard nothing whatever. Indeed, she seemed
  too utterly bewildered to understand what had happened. The sudden change
  from the brilliant light to the pitch darkness had had its effect on
  everybody there, but it was useless to stand idly discussing this great
  calamity. The thing was done, and there was an end of it, and the authorities
  were plainly of opinion that Miss Cordy would be lucky if she ever saw her
  necklace again. In the language of the paragraphists who pursued her so
  unceasingly, "she was utterly prostrate with grief." One or two intimates
  stayed to administer what consolation they could, but save for the idea of
  immediate bed and eau-de-cologne, no practical balm for Miss Oordy's stricken
  feelings emanated from that frivolous crowd.</p>

  <p>"What's the good of that?" the demented young woman asked. "Besides, we've
  got a dinner-party to-night, and if those dreadful people have taken my
  necklace, why, then, my father must buy me another one. But please tell that
  young woman to take those dreadful orchids away. I shall never see an orchid
  again without thinking about this terrible afternoon."</p>

  <p>The pretty little assistant stood there, blushing and trembling. She
  glanced appealingly to Sir David, who very naturally demurred to this
  exhibition of sentiment on his daughter's part. The orchids had cost him
  nothing, it is true, but then he had been looking forward to boasting and
  swaggering about them at his dinner-table later on, and this was one of the
  things which he enjoyed above everything. But for once in his life he had to
  give way.</p>

  <p>"Better remove them," he muttered. "At any rate, I suppose I can have them
  on another occasion. Here, one of you men, go and order a cab and bring this
  young woman's baskets back. Pack them up and get them away at once. I can
  call round to your shop in the morning and explain."</p>

  <p>It took some little time to pack the flowers, for the room was mainly
  occupied now by the police force, who were searching everywhere for the
  missing pearls. The little florist appeared to watch them with dazed
  fascination. Presently she realised that her curiosity was out of place, so
  she proceeded to entwine the stems of her flowers with cotton-wool, and to
  place them in their mossy boxes with almost loving care. It was really
  marvellous to see in how small a space those long trails and clusters of
  blooms folded when they were handled by expert fingers. A detective,
  evidently with a passion for flowers, watched the work with frank
  admiration.</p>

  <p>"I didn't think you could have possibly done it, miss," he said. "Why,
  when we came in, those tables were one mass of glorious blooms, and now
  you've got them all packed away so that they would go into a good-sized
  dressing-case. They are very light, too."</p>

  <p>"Yes, aren't they?" the assistant said, with a shy smile. "And I wonder
  how I managed so well, because I've never known my hand shake so much as it
  did just now. And I do hope that pretty young lady will get her necklace back
  again. It seemed such a horrible trick to play upon her. Do you suppose it
  really was a planned affair? Isn't it just possible that some guest took
  advantage of the accident?"</p>

  <p>The speaker pulled up as if ashamed of her audacity in making such a
  suggestion. The detective shook his head meaningly. He was bound to admit, he
  said, that he had heard of such things. The little assistant sighed as she
  demurely left the room and made her way into the street. She was infinitely
  obliged to the gorgeous footman who had called her a cab, but really, she
  didn't want one, she had such a little distance to go, and she much preferred
  to walk. She disappeared down the street, and presently was crossing the Park
  in the westerly direction. Almost at the same moment one of the leading
  lights from Scotland Yard arrived at Park Lane with the demand to see Sir
  David at once.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid it is a put-up thing, sir," he said. "I've been down to
  Parker and Lee's making inquiries. The man you had here just now was not
  their man at all. They couldn't send you Taddy, because he met with an
  accident, but they sent you another man equally reliable, who had
  instructions last night to be here at three o'clock. We have just found out
  that he never went home last evening at all. You may depend upon it that he
  has met with foul play. Probably he was lured into some den and heavily
  drugged. The man who came here and personated him, beyond all doubt was the
  thief. Of course, we can't tell quite how he managed it, and up to now we
  have found nothing wrong with the main switches of the electric light. But no
  doubt he managed to establish a short circuit somewhere, and directly the
  light went out he popped the necklace in his pocket."</p>

  <p>"The scoundrel!" Sir David groaned. "I suppose you'll manage to get hold
  of him. He is sure to be some well-known criminal."</p>

  <p>"Oh, of course," the inspector said soothingly. "We shall lay hands upon
  him right enough. I know it must have been intensely dark for the moment, but
  it's rather odd that the assistant from the florists didn't notice anything.
  She was actually arranging the flowers at the time. I don't suppose she can
  give us any information, but I should like to speak to her."</p>

  <p>"You don't mean to suggest," Sir David cried, "that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear, no, sir. There's no shadow of doubt in my mind as to who the
  thief is, but one never knows."</p>

  <p>"The girl's gone. I wanted her to rearrange the flowers in the dining-room
  for to-night's dinner, but my daughter wouldn't hear of it."</p>

  <p>The inspector murmured that the matter was of little importance, and
  meanwhile the innocent florist was making her way by the circuitous route to
  the obscure lodging in Soho where Mr. Peter Prouse lived. He smiled largely
  and blandly as he saw the parcel which she was carrying in her hand.</p>

  <p>"This is better luck than I expected," he said. "I thought we should have
  had to wait for those flowers at least till to-morrow morning. I thought we
  should have had to fetch them."</p>

  <p>"Oh, the girl took a dislike to them," Mrs. Prouse explained. "She said
  she never wanted to see an orchid again, so Sir David told me to pack them up
  and take them back to the shop, and here I am. And now I am dying with
  curiosity&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Right you are," Prouse said immediately. "Unpack the flowers; do it
  carefully and lay them on the table."</p>

  <p>"Just as if I should do it carelessly. I am too fond of flowers for
  that... There, now. And now tell me what possible connection there can be
  between these blooms and the disappearance of Miss Cordy's pearl
  necklace."</p>

  <p>"That's quite easy enough," Prouse said. "Now, just pass me those three
  large sprays of blooms. Thank you. Now, I take this pair of tweezers and
  insert it in the gold and green cup at the base of this flower, which looks
  so exactly like a mouth&mdash;or, rather, like a glorified snapdragon. And
  from it I produce this pearl, which is worth at least a thousand pounds. You
  see, I go on doing this with the tweezers till I remove all the pearls which
  you see before you. See how beautifully they fit into the receptacles and how
  utterly impossible it would be to guess where they were. My idea, of course,
  was that the flowers would be removed by you to the dining-table, and when
  all those swells were discussing the loss of the pearls, they would be under
  their very eyes all the time. Then you would have gone round to the house
  to-morrow morning to fetch the flowers away, just as if they really did
  belong to Larkspur and Son, and as if you were an assistant in the shop. It
  was a million to one against Cordy's suspecting that there was anything wrong
  as far as you and the orchids were concerned. Now, I didn't tell you what the
  game was as far as you were concerned, and what risks you had to run, because
  it would have made you too horribly nervous. You would never have got out of
  the house all right if you knew you had the pearls in your possession. I
  wanted you to think the flowers were only part of the blind."</p>

    <img src="1300981h-images/TheLanguageOfFlowers2.jpg"
         title="'From it I produce this pearl.'">
  </div>

  <p>"I did think so," Mrs. Prouse said. "And you are quite right, Peter, I'm
  glad I didn't know."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's all right," Prouse said. "The rest was quite easy. You see, I
  had to get that private detective out of the way, and that was no great
  trouble. I managed to drug him all right, and then of course I had to take
  his place. It was easy for me to pose as the representative of Larkspur and
  Son, but it was not quite so easy to take you into the drawing-room of Park
  Lane and then to slip out of the house again and come back five or ten
  minutes later freshly made up to take the part of the Parker and Lee's
  detective. But I had been there in that role in the morning, so that the
  servants might get familiar with me. Still, an old hand at the game like
  myself managed to slip into a lavatory when all the servants were busy and
  alter my make-up a little. When I came back into the drawing-room, I studied
  exactly how the land lay, and almost before the lights were out I had my hand
  upon that necklace. I had only to cut the string, and all the pearls slipped
  into my hands. It didn't take me long to feel for the orchids and slip the
  pearls into those little green and gold mouths."</p>

  <p>"But the light?" Mrs. Prouse asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that was the easiest of the lot. When I was in the drawing-room early
  in the afternoon, I took one of the lamps off from a cluster near the table.
  When the time came, I had only to take my knife out of my pocket and touch
  the negative and positive poles in the lamp-socket with the steel blade. That
  short circuited it at once, and blew out the fuse. The rest was quite easy.
  But it's a pretty little scheme altogether, and I am quite proud of it. At
  any rate, I'm even with Cordy now. The only thing I regret is that I can't
  tell him whom he had to thank for the loss. But you can't have
  everything."</p><br>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY ALEC BALL</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. XXIX, May 1909, pp
  803-810</h3><br>

  <p class="first">BY and by the two men would be making Empire. Later on, with
  any luck, that unknown portion of Africa would be added to the map and duly
  painted red. Then, perhaps, in the fulness of time, Stanning and Ridsdale
  would be largely in the newspapers, with C.B.'s after their names, and
  possibly fat commissionerships in the not remote future. It is a fascinating
  game, and has been played with brilliant success ever since the days of Drake
  and Frobisher and Hawkins. If the thing is successful, then these adventurers
  are patriots and explorers; if the thing fails, then they are no better than
  pirates, and are treated accordingly. And nobody understood the rules of the
  game better than Stanning and Ridsdale. They had gone into it with their eyes
  wide open; they had tired of the ordinary amusements of an effete
  civilisation, and, besides, they were both getting on in life. There were
  wrinkles under their eyes and grey patches on their temples, and a peculiar,
  nervous jerk of their hands which told its own story.</p>

  <p>There were about two hundred and fifty of them altogether. As to the
  natives, they didn't count at all. They had been more or less pressed into
  the service; they were so many black cattle in a country where it was
  impossible to obtain mules. The Europeans were a mere handful, and of them
  the less said the better. For the most part, they would have preferred it
  that way. They were all in possession of antecedents, of course, but on this
  head they displayed a unanimous and striking modesty. Probably most of them
  had been in jail, and they all deserved to be, but they were just the sort of
  men that Ridsdale and Stanning wanted, for they knew no fear, and adventure
  was as the breath of their nostrils. It looked like being a big thing,
  too.</p>

  <p>In the first place, no white man had ever been here before. The country
  was rich in produce; there was ivory to be had for the asking, and if the
  stories told by the natives were true, there was indiarubber back yonder
  behind the place where the chief of the tribes lived. Of course, there was
  the awful climate&mdash;the hot, steamy days and the heavy nights, when the
  fog fell like a blanket, and perspiring humanity shivered under its cold
  touch. There were fever and dysentery and all the rest of it, and no man knew
  what to-morrow would bring forth. But it was beautiful in its way, too. There
  were orchids here hanging from the trees, which collectors away in England
  would have given an ear to call their own. Provided the little force was not
  wiped out prematurely, then Stanning and Ridsdale began to see the outline of
  great possibilities. Probably, later on, they would reap their reward for all
  this; there were no newspaper correspondents present, so that they might
  carry out the campaign in the usual way. It is an axiom in the making of
  geography that dead men tell no tales.</p>

  <p>And yet, somehow, things were not going quite so smoothly as they might,
  for here was a tribe that refused to come in. The men of it were not to be
  moved by blandishments or glass beads or biscuit-tins, and Winchester rifles
  appeared to have no terrors for them. More than one brush had ended in an
  undecided fashion, and progress was getting slow, until it began to dawn upon
  the leaders of the expedition that they were in a tight place. Their sentries
  were picked off at nights, and though they had every intention of moving in
  one direction, it gradually began to dawn upon Stanning and Ridsdale that
  they were being shepherded into quite another place. It was all very well to
  try and believe that their movements were made for strategic reasons, and
  because of the force of the foe who kept at respectful distance. But these
  two leaders had been in South Africa, and they recognised that there was
  method behind all this. There was something almost murderously civilised
  about it. The lesson had come right home that afternoon, when an advance
  party had been fallen upon and cut off to a man in a little ravine leading
  out into the plain. And when the advance party came to be buried, Stanning
  stood there whistling softly and scratching his head with a ruminative
  fore-finger. He was the more observant of the two, and he was seeing things
  now which were lost upon Ridsdale. When the two sat down gloomily to smoke,
  it was Stanning who pointed out certain things of moment.</p>

  <p>"This is a serious business," Ridsdale said.</p>

  <p>"My boy, it's more serious than you think," Stanning replied. "Now, just
  look at this. I picked it up this afternoon&mdash;in fact, I picked up a
  couple of dozen of them. If those chaps of ours find any of them, they won't
  move another yard."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Ridsdale asked languidly. He lay there half suffocated by
  the moist heat; his face seemed to be bathed in a kind of yellow varnish.
  "What have you got there?"</p>

  <p>Stanning passed over a little, shining, brass cylinder for his companion's
  inspection.</p>

  <p>"No reason to ask you if you know what this is," he said. "You've been
  through the Boer war, and you've seen the thing for yourself. It's the shell
  of a Mauser cartridge, my boy, and I've got a score more in my pocket. And
  every one of those poor devils we buried just now was shot with a No. 2
  Mauser rifle of the very latest pattern. Why, it hasn't been out more than
  six months. Lord knows how it was that those chaps didn't notice. I suppose
  they thought that our little lot was picked off by a lot of old gas-pipes
  just in the usual way. I tell you, I don't like it, Ridsdale. I could have
  sworn that we were the first white men here, and yet that's impossible. Fancy
  coming across niggers in the middle of Africa armed with Mausers! And that's
  not the worst of it. Here's another shell. I picked it up quite by accident.
  You won't want to run your eye over it more than once to see that it's a
  Maxim cartridge. Fancy a nigger chief right off the map here with a force
  behind him armed up to date in this way! No wonder he refused to come into
  treaty with us. And the beggar's clever, too. He's running this little scrap
  quite on European lines. He's a kind of Cronje in the bud. And instead of us
  being marching on to Maryland and all that sort of thing, we are in a
  devilish tight place. I only began to realise it yesterday, and that
  confounded nigger knows it, too. If something out of the common doesn't
  happen, your mother and mine will never see their blue-eyed boys again."</p>

  <p>"So you've spotted it, too?" Ridsdale asked. "I didn't like to say
  anything about it till I was certain. And so far as I can see, there is only
  one thing left to be done."</p>

  <p>"'The good old rule, the simple plan,'" Stanning quoted&mdash;"the great
  game of bluff which has built up the British Empire and made it what it is.
  We shall have to wave the flag, my boy. We shall have to pose as a British
  force, and offer this mahogany Napoleon here the protection of the Union
  Jack. It may come off all right; on the other hand, it mayn't. If it does,
  then we shall get our little reward later on, and if it doesn't, then
  Portland prison may be our portion for some little time to come. We will send
  our friend an ultimatum. We will send something neat and not too gaudy in the
  way of a mission, asking the chief to come and see us. You write it&mdash;you
  are better at that sort of thing than I am&mdash;and make it flowery, old
  chap, whatever you do. Throw in a lot about the Empire on which the sun never
  sets."</p>

  <p>Ridsdale dragged himself wearily in the direction of his tent. He sat
  down, and at the end of half an hour had evolved something satisfactory. It
  was finely decorated with some imposing looking pictures taken from packets
  of cigarettes. It was just the sort of thing to fill the heart of a simple
  savage with wonder and delight.</p>

  <p>"I think that will do the trick," he said. "Those regimental colours from
  the cigarette packets come in fine. It looks like the work of a boy in a
  Council school. And now, I suppose, the best thing we can do is to send it
  off. With any luck, we ought to get some sort of a reply before sunset."</p>

  <p>It was not a particularly easy matter to procure volunteers for the proud
  position of bearing the proclamation. But the thing was accomplished at
  length by a judicious admixture of threats and bullying, together with a
  couple of bottles of something peculiarly atrocious in the way of whisky. The
  deputation started presently under the guidance of a big ex-convict, who had,
  amongst other talents, the gift of tongues. He swayed slightly in his walk;
  he was filled contemporaneously with the importance of his mission and the
  lion's share of the aggressive whisky. The little company departed presently,
  and Ridsdale and Stanning sat down to await events. Even their spirits were
  damped by the outlook. The heat beat down upon them furiously; they lay there
  groaning and sweating, anxious to be up and doing something, and yet held in
  the grip of that enervating moisture. Presently it became too hot to smoke;
  they could only lounge there half torpid and almost too listless to fight the
  flies which hung round them in black, humming clouds. It was nearly sunset
  before a solitary native came in sight, the only one of the deputation,
  apparently.</p>

  <p>"Where are the rest of them?" Stanning demanded.</p>

  <p>The native made a motion by drawing his hand across his throat. He was
  absolutely livid under his black skin, his yellow eyeballs rolled in a fine
  frenzy of fear.</p>

  <p>"All gone, master," he said&mdash;"all done for. I saw it. First one, then
  the other, and the lord of the black beard last of all. Me they spared, me
  they sent with a letter."</p>

  <p>This was the gist of the story he had to tell, told in his own words. It
  was adorned with wild gesticulations and a certain fluency of description
  from which the listeners picked out the prominent features. Apparently,
  without waiting for any explanation, the native chief had had the deputation
  promptly murdered, with the exception of the fortunate individual saved from
  the holocaust to bring back a reply to Ridsdale's work of art.</p>

  <p>"Did it seem to annoy him?" Ridsdale asked.</p>

  <p>"He read," the native said. "He put up the one glass to his eye, same as
  my lord here--"</p>

  <p>"What?" Stanning cried. "Here, steady on! Do you mean to tell me that this
  nigger wears an eyeglass like mine? Oh, the man's mad&mdash;frightened to
  death!"</p>

  <p>But the native stuck stoutly to his story. He had gone alone into the
  presence of the mysterious great chief, all dressed in his feathers and his
  paint, and the great gold ring through his nose, and the great chief had read
  that illuminated address, and he had laughed and laughed till the tears ran
  down his face. Then he had summoned a woman, who came muffled to the eyes,
  and she had read and laughed, too, in tones like those of the bell-bird when
  he is calling to his mate. And after that the big chief had written something
  with a pen on a sheet of paper, and he had tossed it to the messenger,
  bidding him contemptuously to be gone and take it to the white men who had
  dared to send him there.</p>

  <p>"Oh, tho man's raving!" Ridsdale said. "He's either that or he's a born
  journalist without knowing it. I suppose you could find novelists in this
  part of the world even. If this chap were only educated, he would knock some
  of those writing chaps at home silly. Still, it's clever. He's a humorist.
  Just think of a nigger with a ring through his nose and an eyeglass! And that
  touch about the fair female with a voice like a set of silver bells!"</p>

  <p>"And the pen and paper," Stanning said. "Now, my son, produce the
  love-letter. Let's have the cream-laid note and the violet ink. Hand it
  over&mdash;the letter, you fool, the letter!"</p>

  <p>The anguished native promptly dived his hand into his loin-cloth and
  produced a note. Surely enough it looked just the sort of letter to come from
  any civilised being with a nice taste in notepaper and a firm, neat
  handwriting. The letter was addressed to the commander of the British force,
  and inside was a short and pithy message couched in ironical phrase in an
  absolutely perfect grammar. Stanning gasped as he read it.</p>

  <p>"The gist of it," he said faintly, "is: 'Don't you wish you might get it!'
  And it's written in French, of all languages in the world! Oh, we've gone
  mad, old chap! This infernal climate has been too much for us, and, for the
  time being, Reason totters on her throne. The dusky warrior who murders the
  envoy in cold blood is all right enough, for we've met him before, but the
  savage chief who has an eyeglass and writes letters upon notepaper with the
  Army and Navy Stores' imprint on the flap of the envelope must be a creature
  of imagination. He couldn't exist; the whole thing is impossible."</p>

  <p>"Well, there it is, anyway," Ridsdale said. "I suppose we don't happen to
  have blundered on a tribe of white men who have been lost sight of for a few
  generations? No, that's quite impossible. I don't think a white man would
  have an embassy chopped up in that cold-blooded way. Still, the thing's
  pretty weird, old man. It gives me a queer sensation down my spine. I'd give
  something to get out of this!"</p>

  <p>Stanning was emphatically of the same opinion. There was nothing for it
  now but to await the course of events. The darkness fell presently, and with
  it the night became sensibly cooler. It was possible to stand up now and to
  think and to act energetically. For an hour or more the two friends debated
  the matter, at the end of which time they decided that it would be better to
  fall back the way they had come. A long night march might take them outside
  the zone of danger. But here they were mistaken. A murderous fire broke out
  presently from both sides of the ravine, and the small advance guard fell
  back in confusion. Evidently it was too late to do anything now, and the only
  thing left was to concentrate forces and await the onslaught, which Ridsdale
  and Stanning knew now would come before morning.</p>

  <p>They could only hope for the best. They could only clench their teeth with
  the determination to fight it out to the bitter end. It was a couple of hours
  before the dawn when the attack broke upon them from all sides with startling
  suddenness. A great searchlight flared amongst the trees; the wood seemed to
  be alive with black figures, some of which were armed with a Mauser rifle.
  Their fire was concentrated and murderous; they closed in more fiercely, till
  at length Ridsdale and Stanning and a couple of natives alone remained. A
  gigantic black figure came bounding through the undergrowth, and pointed a
  revolver at Ridsdale, but at that very moment another huge figure appeared
  from out the gloom, and snatched the weapon from the big fellow's hand. In
  the same instant a hoarse command rang out from somewhere, and the firing
  ceased and the searchlight died away. It was impossible to see a yard ahead
  in the intense darkness.</p><br>

         title="A gigantic black figure...">
  </div>

  <p>It was no time to wait and argue what this policy meant. Stanning clutched
  his companion by the arm, and together they staggered on through the night.
  They fought their way steadily with a grim courage and despair, knowing
  little where they went and what lay before them. But presently it seemed to
  them that the noise was dying away, and that for the time being, at any rate,
  they had reached a haven of safety. The first glimpse of the dawn was coming
  up now as they threw themselves down, spent and exhausted, upon the thick
  herbage.</p>

  <p>"We've done it now!" Stanning gasped. "I should say that we were the only
  two left. So far we are lucky to be together. But where's it going to end?
  How are we going to find our way back again? Why, we haven't got so much as a
  revolver and a cartridge between us!"</p>

  <p>Ridsdale had no suggestion to make; he was too utterly tired and worn out.
  Stanning's eyes were closing, too, and they lay there in a deep sleep of
  utter exhaustion hour after hour, until, when they woke again, the sun was
  beginning to slope behind the dim outline of the distant hills. So far as
  they could judge, according to English time, it must have been about six
  o'clock. And then came the knowledge simultaneously to both of them that they
  were ravenously hungry. Still, they had to get on, and that speedily. They
  were far enough away from their own camp, even if they had known the
  direction in which it lay. But by this time, no doubt, the camp had been
  wiped off the face of the forest, and little trace of it would remain. They
  had nothing beyond what they stood up in, no arms, and no provision to make a
  fire, even if they possessed the food to cook.</p>

  <p>"We shall have to manage it somehow or other," Stanning said. "We can't
  sit quietly here and starve. What do you say to prospecting around till we
  can find a village? We can't be so very far away from a human
  habitation."</p>

  <p>"Come along," Ridsdale said. "Anything's better than this."</p>

  <p>It was a difficult and a hazardous matter, but they managed it at length.
  They found a village presently, lying on a high plateau of land, and in the
  background an imposing group of buildings&mdash;quite a small palace in its
  way&mdash;which evidently was the residence of the chief of the tribe. So far
  everything had gone well, and there was nothing for it now but to possess
  their souls in patience until such time as the village slept, and it would be
  possible to steal into one of the huts and procure food. It might be possible
  also to assimilate a rifle or two and a box of cartridges.</p>

  <p>The darkness fell presently, and dim lights began to twinkle out in the
  village. Then the open windows of the imposing palace in the background burst
  into scores of points of gleaming flame. Ridsdale clutched his companion's
  arm.</p>

  <p>"It's a land of magic," he whispered. "Electric lights, as I'm a living
  soul! Oh, there's no doubt of it! Look and see for yourself. Why, you can see
  the clusters on the ceiling! What on earth does it mean?"</p>

  <p>"Come and see for yourself," a quiet voice came out of the darkness. "Now,
  don't move, gentlemen; I've got you covered with my revolver. I've been
  watching you for some time."</p>

  <p>Ridsdale and his companion resigned themselves to the inevitable. They
  were too dazed and bewildered to make any resistance; besides, this was
  emphatically a case where discretion was the better part of valour. They
  walked circumspectly and discreetly, for on that point their guide was
  emphatic. They came presently to the outer gate of the palace, which was
  immediately closed behind them. Once inside, they gazed round them with a
  feeble mixture of admiration and surprise. Here was a large, wide hall
  furnished in luxurious fashion, perhaps a little reminiscent of Tottenham
  Court Road, but with an absolute eye to comfort for all that. The electric
  lights gleamed everywhere behind the yellow silk shades; there were pictures
  on the walls, and oriental vases and bowls filled with masses of white and
  gold and purple orchids. The feet of the weary adventurers sank luxuriously
  into thick carpet; their tired eyes turned wearily from the splendour and the
  luxury of it all. Ridsdale turned recklessly to his guide. The man was a
  European like himself, with the suggestion of a Frenchman about him.</p>

  <p>"What's the name of this hotel?" Ridsdale asked. "I say, you might show us
  where the bathroom is. And if you can give us a pick-me-up before dinner, we
  should be obliged."</p>

  <p>"A little patience," the guide said calmly. "Perhaps you would like to see
  the bathroom first. This way, please."</p>

  <p>They followed, still marvelling, across a wide passage with many rooms
  leading out of it. The adventurers could see that there was a well-filled
  library as they passed, and further on a billiard-room, and again a
  music-room.</p>

  <p>They were alone together presently in a large apartment lined with white
  tubs and fitted with two baths with silver appliances. They stood and grinned
  at one another.</p>

  <p>"The Arabian Nights, by Jove!" Ridsdale cried. "Where's the one-eyed
  Calendar with the scented soap and the hot towel? Upon my word, if they give
  us a good dinner and show us the nigger with the eyeglass afterwards, I shall
  be quite prepared to die happy. Pity we didn't bring our dress-clothes with
  us, wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>Stanning responded in a reckless mood. He was feeling now as if he cared
  little what happened; after this, life could possess no further surprises for
  him. They fairly revelled in the luxury of a bath. They came out presently,
  to find razors and shaving tackle awaiting them. Then their guide reappeared
  and conducted them down to a drawing-room which would have been worthy of
  Belgravia. And here, awaiting them, was a tall, graceful woman in
  evening-dress. She was dark and handsome enough in a way&mdash; she might
  have been some five-and-forty years of age&mdash;and she had a fascinating
  smile which rendered her face extremely youthful.</p>

  <p>"I am very glad to see you," she said. "Which is Mr. Ridsdale and which is
  Mr. Stanning?... Oh, yes, it is quite delightful to see a white face again!
  It is thirteen years now since I spoke in English or French to anyone but my
  husband. I see you are wondering who my husband is. He was a little late in
  going to his dressing-room this evening, but he will be here presently to
  explain things for himself. He is the chief of the tribe, you know. I fancy
  one of you gentlemen owes his life to the prompt intervention of my husband
  last night--"</p>

  <p>Stanning started and stammered something. Usually he was cool and
  collected enough, but he looked flushed and uncomfortable now.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I don't understand," he blurted out.</p>

  <p>The dazzling vision smiled sweetly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, there are lots of things you don't understand," she said. "But you
  will get over your surprise in time. Of course, if you will come here, you
  will have to put up with the consequences. If you had both perished last
  night, you would have had nobody to blame but yourselves. Why can't you
  English leave people alone? Surely, if one likes to come all this way from
  civilisation, one has a right to a little peace and quietness. Oh, I don't
  blame you, but I know exactly what you were after. In a short time you find
  some excuse to quarrel with the natives, then you run up the British flag and
  build a light railway, and then you go home and write a book, and your
  Government gives you a knighthood and perhaps makes you a governor of some
  important island. I never pick up one of the English society papers without
  reading some charming little biography of this kind. It is only when you fail
  that you are called a thief and an adventurer. Still, I bear you no grudge,
  especially as you are going to make no geography out of this little affair.
  And it really was good of you to come all this way and give us a little
  variety in our monotonous lives. Now, I haven't the slightest intention of
  telling you who we are, and what strange freak of fortune brought us here,
  but there was a time when I knew the Park and Ascot and Cowes quite as well
  as you do. And I should be frightfully interested after dinner to hear all
  about my old friends. But here is my husband."</p>

  <p>There came into the drawing-room at that moment the striking figure of a
  man in evening-dress. He was splendidly proportioned, a veritable mass of
  sinews. His face was burnt almost black, his blunt, short nose and somewhat
  sensual lips had a suggestion of the negro about them. Dyed and stained and
  dressed in the appropriate feathers, he would have passed even in the
  searching daylight for the very model of a negro chief. Looking at him
  carefully, Stanning could see where the nose had been pierced, and where on
  occasions this amazing specimen of humanity wore the heavy gold ring which
  the native envoy had spoken of. But there were no signs of it now, for the
  strange host carried his glass in his right eye as if to the manner born.
  Just for the moment a flicker of malicious amusement fell on his face, and
  his eyes grew hard and merciless. Beyond a doubt, this man had been reared in
  civilisation, but, all the same, he was a tiger. And at that moment Stanning
  could read clearly enough what was likely to happen. They had been brought
  here to amuse this savage and his wife, but that they were likely to return
  to civilisation to tell their story was a contingency so remote that it was
  not worthy of thought.</p>

  <p>"I am exceedingly glad to meet you, gentlemen," the chief said in a harsh,
  grating voice. "I managed to save you last night at some little risk to
  myself. To a certain extent I am like the man in the Scriptures who spared
  Agag and the best of the spoil. Still, it was worth taking the risk. I knew
  it would amuse my wife and afford her a pleasant change. But, really, I owe
  you a grudge for coming here like this, because for many reasons strict
  privacy is essential to us. We won't talk about that; let us go in to dinner.
  We can play at society, at any rate, for the time being."</p>

  <p>It was an excellent dinner; indeed, it seemed to Stanning and his
  companion that they had never sat down to a better. Here were the same
  luxuries which they would have found at the Carlton or the Savoy, here was
  the finest of champagne, the most curious thing in the way of liqueurs, and
  cigarettes which had been expressly manufactured for Royalty itself. And the
  table left nothing to be desired. There were three or four well-trained
  servants who did their work excellently.</p>

  <p>"Ex-convicts," the strange host explained, when the coffee and cigars had
  circulated. "They are French, for the most part. And three out of the four
  have escaped from Toulon. But they serve our purpose excellently well, and
  for obvious reasons they are quite content to stay here. Of course, I need
  not tell you that the tribe which I have the honour to reign over does not
  dream of the way in which its chief spends his evenings. No nigger of the lot
  of them has ever been in here. But that only adds to the mystery and gives me
  greater hold upon them. Now, what do you gentlemen say to a game of
  billiards? We can talk and play at the same time, and I can give you any
  information you need. Not that it is likely to be of any service to you, but,
  still, out of courtesy to my guests--"</p>

  <p>The smile was pleasant enough, but the tone none the less menacing. And,
  on the whole, it was a pleasant evening. The dramatic, unexpected suddenness
  of it alone gave it piquancy and charm in the eyes of the guests. It was only
  later on, in the seclusion of the bedroom, that the grimness of it appealed
  to them.</p>

  <p>"Where's this going to end?" Ridsdale asked gloomily.</p>

  <p>"It will end," Stanning said grimly, "when that tiger and his mate have
  had enough of it. It will end on the knot of a rope or at the impact of a
  bullet. You don't suppose that chap's going to let us get back to
  civilisation, do you? Not a bit of it, my boy. Do you know who he is? Because
  if you don't, I can tell you. He's George Templemore. I found that out last
  night. Of course, I should never have guessed if we hadn't got that letter
  which our envoy brought us. And when I saw the little exploit last night, it
  flashed upon me like a shot. You remember Templemore, don't you? He used to
  live in Paris years ago. One of the most awful blackguards I think I ever
  came across. But you seem to have forgotten the scandal."</p>

  <p>"By Jove!" Ridsdale exclaimed. "Do you mean to say--"</p>

  <p>"I do, my boy. And the charming lady who has been entertaining us to-night
  used to be known in the world of fashion as Marie Chesterton. Templemore
  robbed Chesterton of all he had, and then finally murdered the man who had
  been such a friend to him. And to make the thing all the more horrible, that
  fiend of a woman fled with her husband's murderer. They took any amount of
  loot with them. And they vanished in the most extraordinary manner. At any
  rate, although the police of Europe were looking for them everywhere, they
  were never found. And this is just the sort of wild, mad, plucky sort of
  thing that Templemore would do. Why, that chap would have walked into a den
  of lions if he had been dared to do it.; After seeing him, you can quite
  understand how he managed to get his influence over this tribe. You see, they
  didn't know anything about Mauser rifles when he came here first. And, mind
  you, he was perfectly safe here so long as the gangs of pirates like
  ourselves, masquerading as the forces of civilisation, did not come too far.
  In any case, we're not safe here, and the sooner we get out of it the better.
  I don't suppose our friend will get tired of us before the week's out, but I
  managed to find out where the arms were kept, and I know where the stables
  are, too. There are rifles and cartridges in the little room off the
  billiard-room and some really good horses in the stable. Now, is it good
  enough to stay here on the off-chance of that blackguard changing his mind at
  any moment, or would you like to make a move in the direction of England,
  home, and beauty without delay? It's very nice to sit down to a good dinner
  and to enjoy a good bath&mdash;and though we are pirates, we know
  it&mdash;but it isn't quite good enough to sit down again with a cold-blooded
  murderer."</p>

  <p>"Soon as you like," Ridsdale whispered.</p>

  <p>It was an hour or so before the dawn that they crept cautiously through
  the house, after helping themselves liberally to the chief's weapons. Then
  presently they led two horses out of the stables, making a detour of the
  village, after which they rode on hour after hour, till the sun was high in
  the heavens and all chance of pursuit was at an end.</p>

  <p>"I think we can stop now," Stanning suggested, "and perhaps we are safe,
  after all. There's one thing in Templemore's favour. When we get home and
  tell this story, nobody will believe us. I know I shouldn't if anybody told
  it to me."</p><br>

     name="story9">9.&mdash;THE EMPTY HOUSE</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Queenslander</i>, Brisbane, Australia, 19 Jun
  1909</h3><br>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">"I was sent to you," Mrs. Allardyce explained, "by Lady
  Moreland, who tells me that it is part of your business to let houses which
  are suffering from an evil reputation. There is 19, Aubrey Gardens, for
  instance, the place has now been empty for five years, and I am told that it
  ought to fetch at least six hundred a year. With a limited income like mine
  the matter is serious."</p>

  <p>Mr. Bruce Abbey murmured his sympathy, and intimated that Mrs. Allardyce
  could do no better than to give him the details.</p>

  <p>"Very well," she said. "The last tenant was a rich young man connected
  with the city. He was about to be married, the house was just furnished when
  one evening he came back rather earlier than usual, and when he went to bed,
  locked the door behind him. The next morning his man could not make him hear,
  and burst the door open. To his surprise, the room was empty, and my tenant
  has not been seen since. And here comes the really strange part of the
  mystery. My tenant's fiancee was discovered dead in her bed, though there was
  no suspicion of foul play attaching to the matter. After this, all sorts of
  complications arose, and finally we came to a kind of compromise by leaving
  the dead man's furniture at No. 19, so that my lawyers might let the house
  ready furnished. By a strange coincidence, Mr. Bentley Allen, the actor, and
  his wife became tenants of the house&mdash;the coincidence being, that they
  were cousins of my mysterious tenant. At the end of the week, Mrs. Allen
  declared that she would not stay in the house another moment, as she had seen
  the ghost of James Hartopp. Unless you can explain all this, I shall never
  make a penny out of the place again."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Allardyce departed, leaving Abbey to grapple with his facts. In the
  course of the day he elicited the information that the missing man was the
  son of one George Hartopp, who some years before was head of a flourishing
  business in the city. Latterly, the Hartopp connection had fallen off
  considerably, so that the young man was hardly justified in taking a house
  like 19, Aubrey-gardens. Also, he had been mixed up in rather a shady set,
  which tended towards a certain theory which was shaping itself in Abbey's
  mind. The first thing was to discover the name of the lady to whom Hartopp
  had been engaged. Investigation showed that she was a certain Selina Snow,
  only daughter of Mrs. Snow, of Lexington-crescent, the widow of the notorious
  Chicago millionaire of that name. Abbey smiled as he read the letter
  containing these facts.</p>

  <p>"Here, what a slice of luck," he muttered, "Fancy finding Mrs. Snow again!
  Evidently she is a cleverer woman than what I took her for. I think I'll run
  round and see Mr. Bentley Allen."</p>

  <p>The comedian was busy in his flat looking over a new play. He listened
  gravely as Abbey stated his business, and professed himself ready to do
  anything which would lead to the clearing up of the mystery surrounding James
  Hartopp.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you want to know all about my wife and her delusion over the
  ghost of James Hartopp," he said. "It was on the fifth evening after we had
  taken up our abode at Aubrey Gardens, and my wife had gone to her room to
  dress for dinner. The bedroom is behind the drawing-room, and I was in my
  dressing-room when I heard a fearful scream. I found my wife terrified and
  impressed with the belief that she had seen the ghost of James Hartopp. Of
  course, it sounded very absurd, but she said that he was pale and unshaven,
  and that he was smoking a cigarette. Strange to say, the place smelt strongly
  of smoke, and there was a pile of ashes by the door."</p>

  <p>"What do you make of it?" Abbey asked.</p>

  <p>"Overwork," Allen said. "We had a very long tour in the South, and my wife
  is far from well. I look upon the whole thing as nothing more than a
  delusion."</p>

  <p>"I don't agree with you," Abbey said, quietly. "I am firmly convinced that
  she did see James Hartopp. Now, tell me, what do you suppose Miss Snow died
  of&mdash;I mean the girl to whom your cousin was engaged?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, there was no doubt about that!" Allen exclaimed. "Beyond all question
  she was suffering from an old-standing complaint&mdash;heart failure, and all
  that kind of thing."</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't wish to contradict you," Abbey said; "but I am sure that
  you are altogether wrong. You may laugh at me, if you like, but it is my firm
  conviction that Miss Snow is not dead at all, and I shall be in a position to
  prove it to you before many days have passed. This is one of the strangest
  cases I have ever handled."</p>

  <p>"Well, I wish you luck with it," Allen said. "And now, if I can't tell you
  anything else, I shall be glad to be alone again, for I am exceedingly
  busy."</p>

  <p>Abbey took the hint and departed. By the time he reached his office he had
  pretty well worked the matter out. It seemed quite plain. Hartopp had
  vanished from his locked bedroom, probably because his creditors were getting
  importunate. And Abbey knew a great deal about Miss Selina Snow and her
  sudden death. The girl and her mother had come within his influence in
  connection with quite another matter, and, this being so, Abbey saw his way
  how to act.</p>

  <p>It was nearly dark when he left his office and walked in the direction of
  Aubrey Gardens. There was no caretaker in No. 19; but Abbey had the keys in
  his pocket. With the aid of an acetylene lantern he hoped to make one or two
  useful discoveries before long. His first visit was, naturally, to the
  bedroom where the ghost had appeared. By the side of the bed was a small
  ventilator let into a stained-glassed window some two feet square. With the
  aid of a chair. Abbey proceeded to investigate. The little window looked
  sheer down into the hall, as the lane of light in the gulf of darkness
  clearly showed. Abbey smiled to himself as he walked on towards the dressing
  room; he saw that somebody had dropped some cigarette-ash on the fender. The
  end of the cigarette had fallen inside. He picked it up and chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Ah," he said. "This is Perique tobacco mixed with Havannah. Corelli and
  Co. on the end, Bond-street. Unless I am mistaken, Corelli have only had a
  Bond-street branch for a year or so, and this house has been empty more than
  twice that time. I wonder if it is possible, that the electric light has been
  left connected?"</p>

  <p>The light flared out, and yet when Abbey went down in the basement he
  found the meter had been cut off. But a bare wire had been attached to the
  main close to the back door. A bit of clumsy amateur work, but enough to show
  Abbey that the house had been used. A moment later and Abbey was in Cornell's
  shop in Bond-street asking questions as to the cigarette end which he carried
  in his hand. A very gentlemanly assistant recognised the brand, but explained
  that it was never stocked, seeing that the cigarettes contained opium and
  were more or less of a sedative. As a matter of fact, the cigarettes were
  only made to order, and, doubtless, the stump that Abbey held in his hand had
  been one of a lot recently supplied to a lady who had called only yesterday
  for a further supply.</p>

  <p>"Would you mind telling me where your customer lives?" Abbey asked,
  boldly. "As a matter of fact. I know her and her habits, and that is why I
  came here to inquire. I know that my request is somewhat unusual, and if you
  object&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The assistant volunteered the address without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Panton-street is quite a respectable thoroughfare, as Abbey well
  knew&mdash;a street once inhabited by doctors and lawyers and the like, but
  now given over to the letting of superior lodgings. A day later, and Abbey
  was established on the second floor suite for a more or less indefinite
  period, at the outlay of something like twenty-five shillings, payable in
  advance. Beyond a pair of blue spectacles, he had no disguise whatever.</p>

  <p>The second day passed and the evening came with no practical results
  whatever. It was summer time, and Abbey appeared to have a weakness for
  smoking cigarettes in the gardens opposite, what time he wore a pair of
  tennis shoes. He was thus engaged on the second evening, when the door of his
  temporary lodgings opened and a tall, dark woman emerged. She pulled a veil
  over her face, and started as if on some definite errand up the road.</p>

  <p>"My woman for a million!" Abbey murmured. "I felt certain of it. And if
  she is not going to 19 Aubrey Gardens, I'll eat my tennis shoes. Nice,
  comfortable wear they are for an evening like this, too."</p>

  <p>Abbey chuckled as he prepared to follow. It was exactly as he had
  expected. The woman in the veil was fairly close to 19 Aubrey Gardens now. A
  street hawker selling music of the pirate variety was importuning the veiled
  figure to buy. Presently she tossed a coin to the fellow, and he rammed a few
  sheets of vilely-printed music into her hand. He turned away and passed
  Abbey, whistling as if he had other work to do. Abbey gave him a quick,
  suspicious glance as he passed.</p>

  <p>"Gustave Markel, the banknote paper thief," Abbey muttered. "I hope the
  recognition was not mutual. Ah, there she goes."</p>

  <p>Very coolly, the woman in the veil let herself in No. 19 with a latchkey.
  The darkness was gathering fast now, and Abbey was conscious that his heart
  was quickening. He crossed over to No. 19, and gently inserted his key in the
  door. It gave as silently as the grave, and the next instant Abbey was
  groping along like a cat in the velvet throat of darkness.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">Bruce Abbey stood there in the midst of the purple shadows.
  He could discern very dim outlines here and there, for the shutters were
  closed, and there was no gleam of light from without. There was danger here,
  too, how great a danger he had not fully realised till he had recognised the
  identity of the pseudo vendor of street music. It was four years since Abbey
  had come across Gustave Markel, in connection with the disappearance of
  certain parcels of banknote paper, and Abbey knew what a poisonous scoundrel
  he had to deal with here.</p>

  <p>Abbey shut his teeth tightly together, and resolved to see this affair
  through personally. There were deeper and more serious matters here than the
  mere solution of the mystery of the empty house. The intruder listened
  intently for a time, but no sound broke the dumming silence of his ears.
  Greatly daring, he produced his acetylene lamp, and flashed a quick lance of
  light around. The lambent flame picked out the stairway, and Abbey took a
  rapid mental photograph of his bearings. It seemed to him that he could hear
  something overhead. Very quietly he crept upwards. Surely enough somebody was
  busy in one of the rooms, somebody else was talking, there was a steady thud
  like the rattle of a hand printing-press. But the door of the room was locked
  as Abbey's nervous fingers discovered.</p>

  <p>How to get those rats to move was the next problem. It would have been
  easy to call in the police, but Abbey's first duty was to his client, and be
  did not want any scandal if it could be avoided. The little man's brains were
  working rapidly. He wanted to disturb those people upstairs, but he desired
  to do it by natural means, something in the way of a plausible accident.</p>

  <p>Illumination came at length with the recollection that the locked room
  overhead was brilliantly lighted. Abbey had seen that through the keyhole.
  Those people upstairs were doing something that required a good light, hence
  the way in which the electric wires in the basement had been manipulated. Why
  not cut that light off? It only required to remove a lamp from anywhere in
  the house, and short circuit the current by the application of a knife blade
  to the positive and negative poles in the lamp socket. This would instantly
  blow out the fuses and render every lamp inoperative. There would be nothing
  here to arouse suspicion.</p>

  <p>With the aid of the acetylene lantern. Abbey unshipped a lamp and applied
  the blade of his knife to the poles. A second later, and there came the
  shuffle of feet overhead, and then footsteps coming down the stairs. A match
  scratched, a man's voice quietly swore. Abbey could hear a woman saying
  something also.</p>

  <p>"Fuses gone," the man muttered.</p>

  <p>"I told you they were not strong enough. Anyway, we can soon put that
  straight. Wait here till I run round to the nearest ironmonger's and get some
  fine copper wire. It is a confounded nuisance, all the same!"</p>

  <p>The front door opened and closed quietly, there was pitchy darkness once
  more. Quite rigid, Abbey stood by the door of the dining-room; it seemed to
  him that he could hear the woman moving about quite close to him. As he
  stepped back instinctively, his foot touched a chair that scraped against the
  polished surround of the carpet, there was a muttered exclamation, and a hand
  touched Abbey on the breast. Instantly he grasped a supple white wrist, as
  quickly his arm was about the figure of the woman.</p>

  <p>"I should strongly advise you not to cry out," Abbey said, breathlessly.
  "I should have preferred for the present to have remained hidden. But since
  you have discovered me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" the woman whispered. "Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"Who I am is absolutely immaterial&mdash;your identity is quite a
  different matter. I should advise you not to struggle. I grant you that the
  situation is a strange, not to say alarming one, but that is surely nothing
  for Miss Selina Snow."</p>

  <p>The woman merely gasped, but she was too absolutely astonished to
  struggle.</p>

  <p>"I know all about you," Abbey went on. "Miss Selina Snow, only daughter
  and heiress of the late Ezra Snow of New York. The late Ezra was a clever
  man, but he died a little before his time, so that he left absolutely
  nothing. But you were too wise to let anybody know that, otherwise you would
  not have dragged your mother to England and posed here as a woman of great
  wealth. Do I interest you?"</p>

  <p>The woman in Abbey's grasp shivered. It was horrible to be there in the
  velvet darkness in the grip of this stranger, who seemed to know
  everything.</p>

  <p>"I do interest you." Abbey resumed. "It was a good time while it lasted,
  eh? But even London tradesmen get tired of giving credit. You had to look
  about you. You decreed to become the wife of Mr. James Hartopp. You thought
  one another rich; when you found out your mistake it was almost too late.
  That is why you two hit upon the desperate course of blackmailing Lord
  Rentonby, who put the case in the hands of a certain solicitor. His lordship
  was young, and having a distinguished political career before him, he decided
  to pay. But unhappily for you, the blackmail game seemed so good that you
  played it also on Sir Charles Gavern, who came to the same solicitor. Then to
  use a vulgarism, all the fat was in the fire. When Sir Charles discovered
  what was taking place he lost his temper, and instead of leaving it to the
  lawyer he came to your house and made a scene. He was not satisfied with
  that, but he must needs go and call on your lover and confederate, James
  Hartopp, hence the disappearance of the latter, hence your unhappy
  demise."</p>

  <p>"Selina Snow was buried, and a proper certificate given," the woman said,
  sullenly.</p>

  <p>"I do not doubt the certificate," said Abbey. "To my certain knowledge at
  least three of your servants were confederates. Long before you had planned a
  good and certain way of escape if the police ever wanted you. Near your house
  was a doctor whose name has since disappeared from the 'Medical Register.' He
  was one of the black sheep of a noble profession. I knew him, and the lawyer
  who I alluded to just now knew him also. We saved an innocent young girl's
  reputation from that scoundrel. And when I heard that he had given the
  certificate of Miss Snow's death from heart failure and that no inquest was
  necessary, I knew what to think."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you are a clever man," the woman said, bitterly. "Go on!"</p>

  <p>"Is there any need?" Abbey asked. "I could have opened the eyes of the
  police, but really it was no business of mine to do so, seeing that our
  clients had got off scot-free. I might have done the same as regards James
  Hartopp, but again it was no business of mine."</p>

  <p>"Then why are you worrying me now?" the woman asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, now I am acting for a client, the lady who owns this house. She
  desires this mystery to be all cleared up, about the ghost that appeared to
  Mrs. Allen, and so on. Well, it was easy to guess who the ghost was. Of
  course, Hartopp wanted something from the safe in his dressing-room, and he
  chose the wrong time to steal into the house. He was smoking a cigarette at
  the time, you recollect. Well, that cigarette end interested me, but not
  nearly so much as the discovery of the other cigarette ends made by Corelli
  and Co., of Bond-street. As Corelli and Co. have only been in Bond-street
  for&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What a fool I have been!" the woman cried. "I had quite forgotten."</p>

  <p>"Of course you had. But you are still wondering. You see, I was the
  confidential clerk of Mr. Ashton King, and it was I who interviewed you for
  Lord Rentonby. On that occasion you gave me a certain cigarette of Perique
  and Havannah tobacco. An soon as I found those stubs manufactured by Corelli
  and Co., I saw everything. This house was empty: it had a bad reputation;
  Hartopp possessed the key. There was a fine secret place to carry on any
  little conspiracy, such as banknote forgery and the like."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" the woman gasped. "You are a fiend! Go on."</p>

  <p>"Presently, perhaps. But unless I am greatly mistaken, that is Mr. Hartopp
  coming back. Now, I have no sentimental feeling in the case, and care nothing
  for your forgery, though I did see Gustave Markel pass you that bank paper
  to-night. Do as I ask you, and you are free to leave the house presently, but
  understand that I am going to lay Hartopp by the heels. The production of the
  pretty rascal is absolutely necessary for the welfare of my client. Mr.
  Hartopp is calling you. Please reply."</p>

  <p>The woman obeyed without the slightest hesitation. Hartopp wanted a
  candle, and he was directed where to find one. A few minutes later and the
  light came up once more; a long ray of it shot down the stairs from the room
  above. Hartopp ran up nimbly, calling to his confederate to follow him.</p>

  <p>"If I were you," Abbey said, grimly, "I should do nothing of the kind. I
  should quietly slide out of the front door and vanish discreetly. Let me go
  upstairs."</p>

  <p>The woman drew a deep breath as Abbey released the grip on her arm. She
  appeared to display no feeling or emotion whatever; she knew quite well when
  she was beaten, for her companion in crime she cared nothing. There was a
  rustle of drapery, a little puff of cool air, and the front door opened and
  closed gently.</p>

  <p>"I made no mistake in my judgment of her," Abbey muttered. "Now for my
  bird."</p>

  <p>Hartopp stood in the centre of a blaze of light examining a sheet of crisp
  paper with an air of critical approval.</p>

  <p>"I don't think they could be bettered, Selina," he said.</p>

  <p>"Really, I don't think they could," Abbey said, coolly. "Miss Selina Snow
  has ceased to take an interest in engravings, however valuable, preferring
  scenery and travel at present. Now, I am armed, and the police are not far
  off. Sit down, James Hartopp, and take it quietly, or it will be all the
  worse for you. If you prefer to fight&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But there was no fight, not an ounce left in the detected criminal. He
  listened quietly enough whilst Abbey recited the main heads of his
  discoveries, and he ticked them off with frequent raising of his dull
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"What do you require of me?" he said at length.</p>

  <p>"Why, to accompany me to Bow-street." Abbey explained. "Subsequently, the
  police can come here and take care of those little efforts of yours. James
  Hartopp's sensational story will make fine copy for the papers to-morrow.
  Come along. In a few weeks' time from now, Mrs. Allardyce can pick and choose
  her own tenants for this house. Curious phase of human nature, but there it
  is."</p>

  <p>As Abbey had prophesied, the strange case of James Hartopp made a fine
  sensation in the cheaper press. Within a few days Abbey was the richer by a
  hundred pounds, and Mrs. Allardyce had secured a tenant, in every way
  desirable at a rent considerably in excess of any previous amount paid for
  that desirable mansion known as No. 19, Aubrey gardens.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE flavour died out of James Costard's cigar. There was a
  taste in his mouth like that of ashes. It was not altogether, perhaps, the
  fault of the cigar, which was one usually retailed, if you are extravagant,
  at nine for the shilling. Costard was particular about his tobacco, but at
  the present moment he had something else to think about.</p>

  <p>He sat there with his head on his hands gazing fixedly at the stage. His
  breath came with quick gasps through his short black teeth. A plentiful bead
  of moisture oozed out of his somewhat grimy features. Those strong, square
  thumbs were trembling, so were the brutal lines of the hard mouth. The
  stentorian noise of Costard's breathing roused the indignation of the lady
  behind, and the feathers in her large hat trembled in indignation. She wanted
  to know audibly why a certain class of people came to a music-hall merely for
  the sake of spoiling other people's pleasure. But Costard heard nothing of
  it, otherwise he would have been ready enough with repartee of a pungent and
  personal nature.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere around him Was thick and dank. Behind the halo of
  tobaoco-smoke the stage loomed aggressively garish. A group of more or less
  competent actors were playing a boiled-down melodrama with all the intentness
  befitting their occupation. There was nothing particularly bright or fresh or
  oiiginal, not too much of the holding of the mirror up to Nature, so to
  speak; but, after all, the play is the thing, and it had gripped James
  Costard to the centre of his shrivelled soul. He turned to his companion, a
  man singularly like himself, who also for the time being had relaxed his grip
  upon his cigar and was regarding the stage with distended eyes.</p>

  <p>"Joe," Costard said hoarsely, "I'll thank you to give me a pinch, old
  pard. Pinch me 'ard in the fleshy part of the thigh, if you'll be so good.
  I'll wake up presently and find it no more nor a bloomin' dream.""</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" Joe Slagg growled unsympathetically.</p>

  <p>Costard shut up accordingly. After all, there seemed to be nothing in the
  stage performance to fill with fear the heart of a man who boasted, not
  without justice, that he didn't know what nerves were. To a certain extent,
  too, the story was commonplace enough. Here was the persecuted heroine, whose
  delicate husband was falsely accused of stealing the family diamonds from a
  hard-hearted uncle who had cast him adrift to die of consumption all alone in
  the hard-hearted world. Here, again, was the heroine compelled to toil as
  private secretary to the said hard-hearted uncle, so that she might find the
  means to keep the consumptive hero alive somewhere in the South of France.
  Apparently there was nothing to cause that unpleasant suggestion of dryness
  in the back of Jim Costard's throat, or to deprive Joe Slagg's tobacco of its
  exquisite flavour. And yet they were both following the performance as
  carefully and earnestly as if they were standing in the dock together charged
  with some heinous crime, and counsel for the Crown was unfolding some
  flawless indictment against them. There were others in the packed music-hall,
  either brutally indifferent, or critical, or damply tearful, according to
  their various temperaments. But in no case did the play grip a solitary
  spectator as it gripped those two friends and partners, James Costard and
  Joseph Slagg.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to see the end of it," Costard muttered.</p>

  <p>"So you will, you fool!" Slagg responded. "You've only got to wait another
  ten minutes. Not but what it's queer, as I own freely. Why, it's exactly the
  same as it was that night three years ago "</p>

  <p>It was fortunate, perhaps, that the lady in the liberal hat behind
  appealed once again for silence. Slagg's reminiscences might have become
  dangerous, they might have even proved interesting to any plain-clothes
  police oflicer in the immediate vicinity. But, as a matter of fact, neither
  of the partners was in the least conscious of what was going on around them.
  They sat there breathless and perspiring, waiting with an excitement akin to
  pain for the development of the story.</p>

  <p>It was reaching the acute stage now. In ten minutes more, at the outside,
  they would know the best or worst of it. And then, just as the heroine was
  taxing her maid with an act of perfidy which had admitted a predatory lover
  to the house of sorrows, a thin curl of blue smoke rose from the wings, a
  tiny tongue of flame zigzagged up the prompt flat&mdash;then, as if by magic,
  the whole thing burst into a dazzling blaze, and a thick, acrid smoke hid the
  stage from view. For the fraction of a second there was a dead silence, then
  the sound of a woman screaming shrilly in the gallery, and a second later the
  trampling rush of many feet in the direction of the exits. It was singular,
  perhaps, that the only people who kept their heads in that headlong stream
  were Costard and his partner. It was they who rose with one accord, uttering
  hoarse commands and shrieking lurid jibes and crimson insults. It was they
  who contrived to beat some spark and semblance of manhood into the cowards
  who were fighting there, heedless of women and children, for their own
  safety. Then, as the fireproof curtain came down and the spirals of smoke
  were whirled upwards, something like order was restored. The women ceased to
  cry and scream, the shrill treble of childish voices died away. From behind
  the fireproof curtain could be heard the steady thud-thud of a manual engine,
  the hiss of water on flame resounded through the emptying theatre.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>They were all outside presently, a white-faced mob talking in whispers, a
  handful of helmeted policemen, a busy doctor here and there, a few
  ominous-looking ambulances. Costard and Slagg pushed their way through the
  huddled sheep and turned with common accord into a public-house not far off.
  They nodded to one another. It seemed to each that this was the time for
  heroic measures.</p>

  <p>"A large brandy, with just a spot of water," Costard suggested
  tentatively, "that's mine."</p>

  <p>"You were always one to think of things," Slagg coincided.</p>

  <p>The necessary refreshment was procured and supplemented before Costard
  began to speak. He produced a fresh cigar and lighted it deliberately.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you think of it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I dunno," Slagg replied. "My mind's all of a whirl, it is. It ain't the
  long arm of coincidence, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"What's that?" Costard asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's something what I 'eard in a play years ago. Sort of bad
  luck&mdash;you know what I mean. You think everything's goin' right, when all
  of a sudden somebody turns up as you thought was dead, or the night
  watchman's on the premises when you think as 'e's takin' 'is 'olidays. Just
  the same what 'appened in the play I'm talkin' about. Just as everything was
  goin' right and 'e was goin' to lead a honest life, up turns somebody as 'e
  couldn't out without gettin' 'is neck stretched, and 'e says, says 'e, 'The
  long arm of coincidence is reached for me.' Seems to have reached for us,
  too, don't it?"</p>

  <p>Costard nodded moodily.</p>

  <p>"That's about it," he grunted. "Three years ago it is since we got 'old of
  them stones at Darchester Terrace. Three years ago it is since them sparklers
  came into our 'ands in the way of business. You remember 'ow it 'appened,
  don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Why, certainly," Slagg replied. "Old gent livin' more or less alone with
  three servants in Darchester Terrace. 'E ain't got much money, but 'e's got
  some family diamonds, what possesses what those newspapers call 'istoric
  interest, and one of them is engraved. We makes up our minds as we're goin'
  to 'ave them, and you, bein' a better-looking man than me, goes along, and in
  a short time you manages to win the affections of a nice-looking young female
  as possesses more beauty than commonsense "</p>

  <p>"'Ere, 'old 'ard," Costard interrupted. "Don't forget you're talkin' of
  the lidy who 'as the honour to be my missus."</p>

  <p>"I'd forgotten," Slagg said penitently. "And it's true, all the same.
  Well, you gets into the 'ouse, and you gets the stones, never knowin' for the
  moment as 'ow the old man 'as a nephew about the place. And I don't say it's
  your fault 'as the nephew was found subsequently lyin' at the bottom of the
  stairs, and that, so to speak, 'e's never been the same man since. Seein' as
  you'd got the stones in your pocket, and seein' as what your personal safety
  was in danger, you couldn't do nothing less than out 'im, though I don't 'old
  with violence myself. I didn't ask no questions at the time; I never asked
  what became of them stones "</p>

  <p>"I've got 'em now," Costard said hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"Never dared to part with 'em. And why? Because I was watched all the
  time; night and day those detectives had their eye upon me. Why, they even
  made a pretence of searching my room when my back was turned, and shammed
  that they was thieves all the time. For the best part of a year I couldn't
  move without bein' followed; not that it mattered, neither. 'Ow was the
  police to know that the very next night we was in the 'ouse of that old miser
  at Netting Hill, what we found dead in his bed? I've 'ad a bit of luck in my
  time, Joe, but nothin' like that. Why, there the poor old beggar lay dead,
  and all we 'ad to do was to 'elp ourselves to his money and securities; and
  when they found 'im afterwards, why, there was nothing to be said or done
  except bury 'im. They couldn't find no relative and they couldn't find no
  friends. And they comes to the natural conclusion that he couldn't have no
  money, and there we were on velvet, with a matter of ten thousand pounds
  between us, and not a soul the wiser."</p>

  <p>Slagg chuckled greasily.</p>

  <p>"And then we sets up in partnership, coal and corn dealers and general
  contractors. We turns our back upon a life of crime, and now we're honoured
  and respected and makin' more money than whatever we did on the cross. Why,
  bless you, with any luck, we shall be members of the Board of Guardians
  yet."</p>

  <p>"Not me," Costard said contemptuously. "No Board of Guardians for me. It
  pays us a sight better to contract with 'em for coal and supplies. But that's
  business. That's the way to become honoured and respected, and perhaps finish
  up with a knighthood. But we're wandering from the point, as the newspaper
  chaps say. What about the long arm of coincidence? And what about the play
  we've been watching to-night? 'Ere we are with the old story set out. Why,
  the very 'set' is a copy of the room in Darchester Terrace, the same
  diamonds, 'ere's the same persecuted 'eroine secretly married to the old
  man's nepliew, 'ere's the 'eroine tumbling to the fact that the maid what she
  trusts so implicitly is at the bottom of the 'ole business. I don't like it,
  Joe. I don't like it a bit. Somebody knows all about it, and somebody's put
  it all into a play. And somebody'll be coming along to you one of these days
  doin' a little bit of blackmail. And you know what blackmail is."</p>

  <p>Slagg grinned uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"I did it once," he muttered, "but it didn't pay. Leastways, it didn't pay
  the second time. I shouldn't have expected as 'ow such a slim-lookin',
  soft-spoken chap could 'ave been so 'andy with 'is fists. Knocked me about
  something cruel, he did. But you're quite right, mate, that there blackmail
  is a good business when you've got something to go on. And if these people
  start about us, we'll have nothing left in twelve months' time. But perhaps
  you're only frightenin' yourself unnecessarily. P'raps that long arm of
  coincidence "</p>

  <p>"Long arm be 'anged!" Costard growled. "'Ow long is it since that little
  business at Darchester Terrace?"</p>

  <p>"Three years," Slagg said promptly, "and a month."</p>

  <p>"Very well, then, just look at your programme for to-night's show. Look at
  your programme and tell me what's the name of that 'ere play as we see this
  evenin'."</p>

  <p>Slagg took the programme from his pocket and unfolded it.</p>

  <p>"Whew!" he exclaimed. "It's called 'The Thirty-Seventh Month,' and this is
  the thirty-seventh month. You're quite right, mate. This thing means
  blackmail. Makes me feel cold up and down my spine. And yet I dunno. Seems to
  me as we should have been better off if we'd seen the end of the play. Been
  able to grip the situation, p'raps. And now it'll probably be months before
  the music-'all will be fit for another audience. And meanwhile "</p>

  <p>"Ah, meanwhile," Costard said ruminatively. "That's the point of the 'ole
  thing, Joe. What we've got to find out is who wrote that little play, and all
  about 'im. I dare say that in the fire to-night the book of the play will be
  destroyed. But the cove what wrote it will certainly 'ave a copy, and we've
  got to find out who 'e is. We've got to make him safe. We've got, if
  necessary, to take steps to induce him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Costard paused significantly; for a respectable tradesman and a man of
  some substance, his expression was decidedly murderous. The man was
  frightened, too; of that there could be no question. His hard, strong mouth
  was twitching; thin beads of perspiration trickled down his face, carrying
  channels of dirt with them. For some little time the two men sat moodily
  sipping their brandy, until a third man came in and nodded as he passed their
  table.</p>

  <p>"This is a bit of luck," Slagg murmured. "That's Tom Carver, stage
  carpenter at the music-'all, 'e is. I dare say 'e can give us a bit of
  information. Let's ask 'im over 'ere and stand 'im a drink."</p>

  <p>The stage carpenter was nothing loth, and over his refreshment he had
  certain information to impart. The damage done to the stage had been
  considerable, most of the property had been burnt out, and there was no
  likelihood that the music-hall would open its doors again for at least two
  months.</p>

  <p>"It's a pity," Costard said musingly. "It's 'ard on the artistes, and it's
  'ard on those what gets a livin' by writin' them plays. Pretty little thing,
  that, you put up to-night. New author, ain't he? What's 'is name?"</p>

  <p>"Party of the name of Braybrooke," the carpenter explained. "I don't know
  him myself. 'E's one of them amateurs, I'm told. 'E'll 'ave to' write that
  play all over again now. All the manuscript was burnt&mdash; in fact, there's
  precious little left except what happened to be in the manager's safe. But I
  dare say 'e's got a copy."</p>

  <p>Costard and Slagg exchanged glances.</p>

  <p>"'Appen to know where 'e lives?" the latter asked.</p>

  <p>"Matter of fact," the stage carpenter went on, "I've got a letter to post
  to 'im in my pocket. Given me by the manager this evenin', it was. 'Mr.
  George Braybrooke, 15, Bodington Road, Kensington.' P'raps you wouldn't mind
  slipping it into the post for me. No, I won't 'ave another, now. I must get
  back to the theatre. P'raps I shall manage to get 'ome by daylight with any
  luck."</p>

  <p>The speaker rose reluctantly and departed, leaving the letter on the
  table. Without wasting further words. Costard called for a Post Office
  Directory. The volume in question proved to be an old one, and contained no
  such address as Bodington Road in the Kensington postal district.</p>

  <p>"More County Council interferences," Costard growled. "Depend upon it,
  they've been changin' the name of the street. Let's go round to the
  post-office and 'ave a squint at an up-to-date volume."</p>

  <p>They found what they wanted presently, and Costard fluttered over the name
  in the road. A queer expression came over his face as he laid his dirty thumb
  on the open page.</p>

  <p>"'Ere, this long arm of coincidence of yours seems to be busy," he said.
  "'Ere we are right enough. Bodington Road, Kensington, lately known as
  Darchester Terrace, and the number is 15, and it's the same 'ouse where we
  'ad the little adventure over the diamonds three years a,go. Good old
  coincidence! Why, this is like some of them stories you read in the Sunday
  papers. What luck!"</p>

  <p>"Don't see it," Slagg growled uneasily. "Makes it all the worse, don't it?
  I'd give five pounds to know 'ow this play ended. Five pounds! I'd give
  fifty."</p>

  <p>Costard dragged his companion to the comparative seclusion of the street.
  He seemed easier in his mind now.</p>

  <p>"You're goin' to know," he said. "You must keep your money in your pocket.
  Do you suppose the same people are still in that 'ouse? Not they. Just
  consider the look of it. It's a risk, Joe, that's what it is, a risk, and I'm
  goin' to take it. For one night only, as they say on the concert bill, I'm
  goin' to depart from the strict paths of virtue. I'm goin' to do a little bit
  of burglary again. Oh, it's safe enough. Why, I remember that 'ouse as well
  now as if I'd only been there last week. And I'm going to find that play, and
  I'm goin' to read it for myself, and I'm goin' to act accordingly. None of
  your blackmailin' for me. I'll know what to do when the time comes."</p>

  <p>"Better wait," Slagg suggested.</p>

  <p>"Not me," Costard said truculently. "Forewarned is forearmed. Besides, I'm
  curious to see this Mr. George Braybrooke. 'E knows a sight too much for me.
  'E knows all about it, and 'e's poor, of course."</p>

  <p>"'Ow do you know that?" Slagg asked.</p>

  <p>Costard looked contemptuously at the speaker, "^</p>

  <p>"'Ow do I know.''" he asked. "Why, ain't all those writer fellers poor.
  Look at Chatterton and Keats and forty more of 'em; they never 'ave a penny
  to bless themselves with. Now, you come round to-morrow night about seven
  o'clock, when the missus is out, and we'll settle this little matter."</p>

  <p>"All right," Slagg said with an air of reluctance. "I suppose I must. Good
  night, James, and pleasant dreams."</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">JAMES COSTARD sat before the fire in his sitting-room, an
  unusual prey to unusually gloomy thoughts. Had he been a man of culture, he
  would possibly have called himself an optimist; as it was, he seldom suffered
  from what he would have called the "'ump." But this was one of those rare
  occasions, for his glass of peculiarly strident whisky stood untasted by his
  side, a mass of documents, relating to an exceedingly profitable and
  therefore particularly rascally contract, were unheeded. In a curious way he
  was proud of his new respetability. He was proud of his broadcloth suit, of
  his heavy gold watch-chain and diamond ring. He was proud of his house and
  his wife and her furs. He was proud, too, to find better and honester men
  than himself addressing him as "sir" and taking off their hats to him, and
  now he stood to lose everything.</p>

  <p>The venture seemed safe enough. Mrs. Costard had retired to bed and would
  be fast asleep by this time. With any luck, Costard would be back home again
  in a couple of hours, and nobody any the wiser as to the result of his little
  trip. It would be no difficult matter, either, to procure the necessary
  tools. The coast had been carefully surveyed, and the time for action had
  arrived.</p>

  <p>Costard let himself quietly out of the house and closed the door behind
  him. For the first time in his life he felt a certain dryness in his throat
  and a peculiar sensation in the region of his heart. A year or two ago these
  distressing symptoms would not have manifested themselves. If he had had no
  friends, he had, at any rate, no enemies, and in those days James Costard had
  no position to forfeit. But now things were different entirely. He would not
  like to admit that he was afraid, but it was a fact, all the same.</p>

  <p>He came at length to Bodington Road, late Darchester Terrace, and stood
  there for a minute or two, to make sure that no inquisitive policeman was
  lingering in the neighbourhood. The street appeared to be absolutely quiet,
  most of the houses were now discreetly draped in darkness, there was nothing
  to be seen but an adventurous cat as Costard stole down the area of No. 15.
  He paused just for a moment to draw a pair of indiarubber overalls over his
  square-toed, respectable boots; he wanted no dark lantern, and as to the
  premises, he remembered them perfectly. His bump of locality amounted almost
  to genius, which was, perhaps, the chief cause why he had never yet actually
  come within the grip of the law. With a thin-bladed knife he pushed back the
  catch of the front kitchen window, and a moment later he was in the
  house.</p>

  <p>It was all familiar enough now; his courage was coming back to him, a
  sense of elation filled him, much as it might have filled a reformed drunkard
  indulging, after the lapse of time, in a glass of spirits. He felt his way up
  the stairs, gliding along in the black, velvety darkness until lie reached
  the hall.</p>

  <p>He stopped there to listen, but no sound broke the stillness of the house
  save the lazy ticking of the grandfather's clock somewhere on the first
  landing. The atmosphere was warm and clinging and familiar&mdash;not a stuffy
  atmosphere, but a clear and slightly fragrant one that Costard closely
  associated with old silver and jewels and watches of price. The very scent of
  it brought vividly back the recollection of more than one brilliantly
  successful midnight raid. So to speak, it was like the smell of the battle to
  the warhorse. All Costard's smug respectability dropped from his shoulders
  now. It would go hard, he told himself, if he did not take toll as recompense
  for all his trouble.</p>

  <p>Not that he forgot his errand. He would have to look for something in the
  shape of a study where this mysterious George Braybrooke did his literary
  work. Costard had been reading the magazines of recent years. He had got to
  know something of the habits of the literary man from the perusal of more or
  less veracious illustrated interview's with writers of mark. Therefore, he
  did not expect to find himself confronted with any serious
  obstacle&mdash;such, for instance, as a fireproof safe. A brief investigation
  of the ground apartments with the aid of an electric torch showed him that he
  would have to look further afield. There was danger here, as he told himself,
  creeping up to the second floor.</p>

  <p>The sweat was running down his face now as he cautiously tried one room
  after another. They were bedrooms, for the most part unoccupied, and there at
  last, at the end of a little corridor by the side of the bathroom, was the
  very thing he was looking for.</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest doubt about it," Costard told himself. Here was a big
  table littered with papers and proofs, on the opposite side was an American
  roll-top desk with the flap pulled back. The room was lined with books. On
  the table stood an electric lamp connected by a flex to a wall plug.
  Undoubtedly Costard's luck was in now. Beyond any question he was in Mr.
  George Braybrooke's library. He could not quite understand the presence there
  of a hat and jacket, indicative of the fact that somewhere in the house was a
  lady who at that moment was in deep mourning. But this, though it might not
  have been indifferent to a Sherlock Holmes, was nothing to James Costard. It
  was a mere detail outside his province. What he had to do now, if possible,
  was to find the complete manuscript of "The Thirty-Seventh Month," and read
  it to the end.</p>

  <p>It was not such an easy matter as he had expected, but presently he found
  it. The manuscript Was a rough copy, certainly, but in happened to be typed,
  and not for the first time in his career James Costard had to bless modern
  skill and modern advancement.</p>

  <p>Yes, here it was, right enough. He hastily ran his eye over the first few
  pages, eith which he was already familiar. He came at length to that portion
  of the play which had been interrupted by the unfortunate fire at the
  theatre, and the further Costard read the more frightened and bewildered did
  he become,</p>

  <p>"It's all here," he muttered to himself as he wiped the gathering beads
  from his forehead. "Every bit of it. And what's more, the writer of this
  stuff knows the part that my missus took in the business. And 'ow did 'e know
  I was fool enough to write Mary a letter? I told her to destroy it... Ah, she
  seems to have done so... And left a piece of it on the study floor. This Very
  same study as I'm in now too. Oh, this is worse than I anticipated! This 'ere
  Braybrooke seems to know everything&mdash;? every mortal thing, and no
  bloomin' error about It, I should like to see that chap, I should like to see
  him very much indeed. I wonder what 'e's like? I wonder if 'e's a cove what
  would be easily frightened! I wonder if I could manage to lure him down my
  way some night&mdash;but, no, a chap as clever as that wouldn't be a
  blithering fool. I'd give a 'undred pounds to know what 'is little game is.
  I'd give a trifle to know 'ow it was that the business of those diamonds
  never got into the papers. But what's the use of talkin' like this? Anyway,
  it couldn't be worse. And that chap's goin' to bide his time like they do in
  the story books. 'E'll wait till I've got more money. 'E'll wait till I'm Sir
  James Costard or something of that sort, and then 'e'll come along asking for
  ten thousand pounds, bold as brass. And I'll have to pay it, too. I only wish
  I'd got 'im 'ere!"</p>

  <p>There was no doubt as to the sincerity of Costard's desire. At the moment
  he was ready for anything. He had raised his voice unconsciously. So absorbed
  was he in his work, with the aid of the electric torch, that he heard nothing
  at all of a sudden creaking on the stairs outside. He did not seem to realise
  for a full minute that the reading-lamp on the table had suddenly burst into
  flame, or that the two brackets over the fireplace were also flooding the
  room with a soft yellow radiance.</p>

  <p>When he did so, a great and overwhelming: fear gripped Costard by the
  heart and heldl him there. Like most of the class, he was; not fond of light
  except in connection with a public-house or a music-hall. He stood there
  trembling and sweating in a ludicrous; state of terror, and glancing
  apprehensively in the direction of the door, as if he fearedl the advent of
  some tremendous presence. He regretted that he had not brought his. revolver
  with him, but profound cogitation: had resulted in the abandonment of any
  policy of that kind. He stood there breathing heavily, he saw the door swing
  back, and then there entered a tall, slender girl dressed from head to foot
  in the deepest mourning.</p>

  <p>She had a singularly beautiful and refined face, none the less beautiful
  and refined because it had traces of considerable sorrow and suffering. But,
  all the same, the blue eyes were quite steady, and the little red mouth was
  absolutely firm.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here?" the girl asked.</p>

  <p><a id="pic7"
     name="pic7"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300981h-images/The37thMonth2.jpg"
         title="'What are you doing here?' the girl asked.">
  </div><br>

  <p>For the moment Costard's repartee failed him. He had nothing to say, no
  ingenious argument to advance to account for his presence in a strange house
  at one o'clock in the morning. Much cleverer individuals than Costard would
  have found themselves at a loss for an argument in similar circumstances.</p>

  <p>"What's that got to do with you?" he growled.</p>

  <p>It was a futile sort of question, but it was. the best that Costard could
  put on the spur of the moment.</p>

  <p>"This is my house," the girl explained.. "I should like to know what this
  conduct means,"</p>

  <p>Costard was understood to say that he was looking for a gentleman named
  Braybrooke. He ventured to remark that he had found the front door open, and
  seeing that he himself and Mr. George Braybrooke were on friendly, not to say
  affectionate, terms "</p>

  <p>"But this is absurd," said the girl, with a slight suggestion of a smile.
  "I am George Braybrooke&mdash;at least, that is the name I adopt for my
  literary work."</p>

  <p>Costard caught his lip between his teeth, and this successfully strangled
  a curse of bitter disappointment.</p>

  <p>"You wrote that little piece called 'The Thirty-Seventh Month'?" he
  exclaimed. "Why&mdash;why&mdash;why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You have seen it?" the girl asked quietly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have seen it," the discomfited Costard said. "And that is
  why&mdash;but you can understand."</p>

  <p>Once more the girl smiled strangely.</p>

  <p>"I think I do," she said. "Do you happen, for instance, to be a married
  man? Oh, yes, I see you are. Now, shall we assume that your wife's Christian
  name is Mary. I am right again, I presume. Let me guess again, and suggest
  that her name was Mary Winslow."</p>

  <p>Costard wiped his heated forehead. The girl stood looking at him out of
  the depths of her blue eyes as if she were trying to read his inward
  thoughts.</p>

  <p>"This is remarkable," she went on, "most remarkable. Do you know that for
  the last two years or more I have been engaged as private secretary to an
  uncle of mine, who, by the way, is dead now&mdash;in fact, we buried him a
  fortnight ago, and the contents of this house belong to me. I stayed on here
  as secretary to my uncle because I happen to have an invaUd husband whose
  state of health until quite recently has necessitated his living in the South
  of France. But you know all that, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"I've seen something like it," Costard said earnestly. "I've seen
  something like it in that little play of yours."</p>

  <p>"Of course. That is precisely why you are here this evening. But we will
  come to that presently. I made that story into a little stage play because it
  struck me it had strong dramatic possibilities. I will ask your opinion
  presently, seeing that you have witnessed the play as far as Fate allowed it
  to go. The cause of my husband's unfortunate state of health lies in the fact
  that he was nearly murdered three years ago by a ruffian who came here in
  search of some diamonds which belonged to my uncle. The diamonds disappeared,
  and my uncle took it into his head to believe that my husband stole them. In
  the face of facts, it was a ridiculous assumption, but te%re is no accounting
  for the vagaries of an old man in his second childhood. Much as I disliked
  it, I remained with my uncle so that I could keep my husband alive. But
  <i>I</i> guessed where the diamonds were. I dare say you wonder why the
  police were never put on the track of the mystery but, then, you see, my
  maid, Mary Winslow, was a great favourite of mine&mdash;she was my
  foster-sister, and on one occasion she saved my life. It is not for me to
  judge her, it is not for me to wonder that a girl like herself should give
  her heart to a man&mdash;well, like you, for instance. But it was all in the
  play. I needn't tell you any more about it, because I see you have already
  read it for yourself. You feared that someone who had got possession of your
  secret might blackmail you, and you wanted to see exactly how matters stood.
  Well, they say that truth is stranger than fiction."</p>

  <p>"But how did you guess?" Costard stammered.</p>

  <p>"I don't guess," the girl said. "I know. That is one of the advantages of
  possessing an artistic temperament. And so you are Mary Winslow's husband;
  you are the man who stole my uncle's jewels; you are the man who was nearly
  responsible for my husband's death three years ago. You don't look like a
  burglar now, you look like a man who is testing the virtues of
  respectability. And so you thought that I would blackmail you?"</p>

  <p>"Lots of people would," Costard said defiantly.</p>

  <p>"Very likely. Perhaps I may yet. It is entirely in your hands. There was
  no fuss made over the outrage I allude to, it never got into the papers, but
  the police had the matter in hand all the same. And I could have told them a
  deal more than I did, only I thought of the foster-sister of whom I was so
  fond, and I held my tongue. But I don't think you ever disposed of those
  diamonds&mdash;at least, the police said that the man they suspected, which,
  of course, was you, had not dared to make the attempt. Now, I have only to
  close the door and lock you in, and then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"'Ow much?" Costard said hoarsely. "Name your price."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am going to. My price is the diamonds which you have been unable to
  dispose of. Come, they are of no use to you, and they will make all the
  difference in the world to my husband and myself. Turn out your pockets. Give
  me your watch and chain and notebook. Put them on the table and leave them
  here, and I will wait till you return with the stones. I think it is a fair
  bargain."</p>

  <p>Very slowly Costard did as he was directed. He breathed hoarsely, and his
  face shone in the lamplight.</p>

  <p>"It's only fair," he muttered, "and I'll do it. And just you wait 'ere an
  hour and I'll be back again."</p>

  <p>"I am sure of that," the girl said significantly. "And now go. If you lose
  no time, my husband and I will be able to catch the morning express to Paris
  to-morrow."</p><br>
